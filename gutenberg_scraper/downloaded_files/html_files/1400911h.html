  <p class="first">FORD DUANE, tall and lank and wearily stooped, slowly
  threaded a shadowy labyrinth of tall bookstacks. Outside, the hush of dusk,
  gray with quiet melancholy, brooded between the drab facades of the ancient
  loft buildings that line the Fourth Avenue block so completely given over to
  the sale of dog-eared, tattered volumes it is known as the Port of Missing
  Books.</p>

  <p>Elsewhere New York was astir with the bustle of home-seeking thousands,
  was alive with the roar of traffic, the chatter of many voices, the tramp of
  many footfalls. Here the wide-flung turmoil was muted to a dull, rumbling
  growl that disturbed not at all the street's dusty drowse.</p>

  <p>Here the threat of Death brooded. Within this somnolent shop peril lurked
  tigress-like; a gray, indomitable shadow waiting for the inevitable instant
  when momentarily its quarry's guard must relax. It would leap then, a gray
  flash, and strike steel claws into Ford Duane's flesh, sink tearing fangs
  into his throat.</p>

  <p>Duane came to the pamphlet-hung door of the store, reached a slow hand to
  the switch that would light the single cluttered display window. The street
  lamps blinked on, abruptly necklacing the quiet block with high-hung, bright
  topazes...</p>

  <p>A lilting whistle sprayed the hush with the first notes of 'Pennies from
  Heaven'. Shuffling footfalls were startingly loud, coming along the
  sidewalk.</p>

  <p>Duane's fingers hesitated for an eyeblink of time, then clicked over the
  switch tumbler. The dingy luminance from his window streamed across the
  pavement. The bookseller had tensed, almost imperceptibly.</p>

  <p>His lids drooped a bit more, as if the better to hide the sudden keen stab
  of blue eyes beneath them. A shadow blotted the cracked concrete and then the
  whistler came into the frame of the doorway.</p>

  <p>He was a boy, a gamin of the gutters shabbily clothed, his freckles almost
  hidden by grime, his hatless hair unkempt and startlingly red. Duane knew at
  once, though he seemed not to see him at all, that the youngster's shoes were
  broken, that his frayed knickers had been clumsily patched at the knees, and
  that there was a rather awkwardly wrapped small package in one dirty
  hand.</p>

  <p>The alpaca-smocked shopkeeper relaxed. Nothing to worry about... The boy
  turned and slouched toward him past a trestled box with the sign YOUR
  CHOICE&mdash;15¢ 2 for 25.</p>

  <p>"Dis Duane's bookstore?" he asked. "Yuh Mr. Duane?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, son."</p>

  <p>"A guy over on Toid Av'noo gimme dis package ter bring yuh." The lad made
  no move to hand it to Duane. "He said he found it w'ere he woiks in de
  Brighton cafeteria and yuh must uh lost it dere when yuh came in for a cup uh
  coffee this afternoon. He said ter say Pat found it and decided he'd better
  send it."</p>

  <p>"Pat? Oh, yes. The bus-boy!" Duane had not left his store that day. He
  knew no one in the Brighton Cafeteria named Pat. "I'll have to give him a tip
  next time I see him." But the letters composing that name&mdash;P-A-T&mdash;had
  a startling meaning to him. "And here's a quarter for you." As
  the initials of the title of a book offered for sale, as the first letters of
  a peddler's cry, in many other forms, they had presaged the delivery of a
  message to Ford Duane, had each time presaged a bout with danger, with
  death.</p>

  <p>Hitherto it had been the death of others those letters had prefaced. This
  time it might mean his own.</p>

  <p>He fished in his pocket, exchanged a worn silver disk for the string-tied
  bundle. "T'anks, mister," the youngster grunted, and darted away, his whistle
  jubilant.</p>

  <p>DUANE did not move from the doorway. His veiled look furtively probed the
  deepening twilight. Across the street, in an unlighted vestibule between two
  shops differing from his only by the scabrously lettered names on the
  unwashed glass of their windows, a man dawdled.</p>

  <p>Holding the package, Duane went out and straightened the contents of his
  sidewalk boxes. He was clearly visible in the light from his store, in the
  illumination of the nearest street lamp. He tore the paper from the bundle,
  crumpled it and tossed it into the gutter. He shook out the folded fabric
  about which it had been wrapped.</p>

  <p>The thing was a worn and shabby silk scarf of a nondescript gray that
  exactly matched the drabness of his appearance. Fumbling absent-mindedly, he
  adjusted a cardboard sign; NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICS 10¢; and wandered slowly back
  into his store.</p>

  <p>Set back from the entrance, but still exposed to the view of the lounger,
  there was a flat-top desk. Duane switched on a goose-necked lamp so that its
  light fell brightly on the desk's cluttered surface, negligently tossed down
  the scarf. As if by accident the silk band spread itself as it fell, so that
  it lay smoothly over a pile of dog-eared catalogues, under the lamp.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane let himself down into a creaking swivel chair before the desk,
  picked up a book that had been lying face down and open, among the chaos of
  dusty papers. He took a spectacle case from the pocket of his smock, adjusted
  them to his eyes and settled back to read.</p>

  <p>If the lounger across the street had been able to peer through Duane's
  glasses, he would not have seen the page of the volume the bookseller was
  apparently perusing, but the hem of the scarf he seemed to have
  forgotten&mdash;startlingly magnified. He would have seen the stitches
  binding the silken hem stand out like heavy twine against he gray background,
  and he would have seen that those stitches were by no means of the same
  length.</p>

  <p>There were long stitches and short ones, four close rows of them, and
  there did not seem to be any pattern to them, nor any reason for the
  variation save that the hem had been sewn by hand rather than machine. But
  Ford Duane read them as dots and dashes forming letters in the Continental
  Morse code; forming words...</p>

  <p><i>"Warehouse rear of three six three Ave E investigate and spot leaders
  but take no action."</i></p>

  <p>The glint of excitement in Duane's hidden orbs died away as he read the
  three last words of that message. He would chafe, he knew, at the leash they
  place upon him. But he was a soldier, and he must obey orders.</p>

  <p>He was a uniformed soldier in the invisible army that unceasingly,
  unendingly fights a hidden war against hidden enemies. Victory means for the
  men&mdash;and the women&mdash;of that army no medals, no plaudits, no parades
  before a grateful, cheering nation. Defeat means for them&mdash;death. A
  lonely death at the hands of their country's furtive enemies, and an
  anonymous grave.</p>

  <p>They are the great gray army of peace. Unnamed, unhonored, they battle
  eternally against a host of silent, grey invaders who gnaw constantly at the
  foundations of our commonwealth, preparing in time of peace for the war their
  masters hope sometime to force upon us, when we have been weakened
  enough.</p>

  <p>Duane's head nodded over his book, as though it had sent him to sleep. The
  man in the vestibule across the street strolled away. After awhile Ford Duane
  roused himself to take in the sidewalk boxes; to lock his door, and turn out
  the light in the window.</p>

  <p>He wandered back to the rear of the store, where a half-open curtain
  marked off but did not conceal the narrow alcove that a rumpled camp cot and
  a two-burner gas plate atop an upended box marked as his living quarters. He
  turned on a light there, made his frugal meal, ate it. Then he rose, pulled
  the curtain together.</p>

  <p>Behind the cot there was a frosted window. If anyone were watching that
  window, he would have seen Duane's shadow move back and forth, undressing. He
  would have seen the silhouetted form of the bookseller lie down on the cot at
  last, a book propped up on his chest. He would have waited long, and after
  awhile gotten tired of waiting, to see that shadow move again.</p>

  <p>A flitting smile relieved the gravity of Ford Duane's countenance as he
  glanced up from the floor at the dummy he had arranged on the camp cot. He
  crawled along the floor till he had reached a certain spot to one side of the
  cubicle. He pressed on a certain board, on another.</p>

  <p>There was the rasp of wood on wood. There was, quite suddenly, a square
  black hole in the floor. The swift slither of a lithe body, the rasp of wood
  on wood once more, and the hole was gone. There was no form any longer in the
  back room of Ford Duane's Secondhand Bookshop, except the unmoving, dummy
  figure on the bed.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN a dark, waterfront alley that should be deserted at
  night, a tall, lank shadow moved briefly. It merged with the impenetrable
  black along the wooden wall of a one-story shack that leaned wearily against
  the high dark loom of a warehouse whose few windows were sightless eyes in
  its streaked brick facade.</p>

  <p>Sounds came into that alley. The swish of roiled river water close by. The
  chug, chug of some motorboat prowling the darkness, and the far-off,
  melancholy hoot of some ferryboat nearing its wharf.</p>

  <p>Nearer, within the alley itself there was another sound.</p>

  <p>Dull, wall-muffled, it was a rhythmic thud, thud, thud. It was a single
  repeated sound like the pound of a huge machine and yet it was somehow too
  widely dispersed to be made by a single object. It seemed to come from behind
  the full width of the warehouse wall. It was now louder, now almost
  inaudible, as though that which caused it approached the brick cliff, receded
  from it, approached it again.</p>

  <p>There was somehow something ominous about that sound.</p>

  <p>The rotted roof boards of the wooden lean-to creaked whisperingly. The
  shadow that had been in the alley drifted across it. A chink of light showed
  in the warehouse wall.</p>

  <p>The rhythmic sound cut short. The shadow crouched against the rust-frayed
  iron shutter through which filtered that yellow light-thread. It was
  man-form, but it had no face.</p>

  <p>Within the warehouse, partitions had been ripped out, making one huge
  room. The glare of two five-hundred watt lamps hung from the high ceiling
  filled the enormous chamber. Beneath them a long double-line of men in vivid
  green shirts stood stiffly, heels together, stomachs in, chests out.</p>

  <p>The lines were ruler straight, as was the serried hedge of sticks, like
  unpainted canes without ferrules or handles, slanted across the men's
  shoulders. Each individual had a white arm-band just above the bend of his
  elbow, and each arm band was marked in black with the insignia of a certain
  world-power whose leader only the day before had orated fulsomely concerning
  the friendship between his country and America.</p>

  <p>A hulking, square-shouldered, square-featured man faced the motionless
  ranks. His hair was a white, stiff pompadour bristling the flat top of his
  skull. His eyes were small, piglike, below a beetling, corrugated brow. His
  shirt was also green, but the arm-band on its sleeve was black, the insignia
  white.</p>

  <p>Black Band's square jaw was thrust out. His gross lips barked a
  command.</p>

  <p>Two rows of left legs slanted up and out, stiff-kneed, jerked down. Right
  legs came up in perfect unison, jerked down. Two lines of manikins moved
  forward&mdash;<i>thud,</i> thud,&mdash;<i>one,</i> two, <i>one,</i>
  two&mdash;<i>thud,</i> thud, <i>thud,</i> thud.</p>

  <p>The lines thudded across the bare, splintered floor as if long, rigid rods
  ran through the men's waists, their heels. They weren't men. They were
  machines. They were one machine, everything human blasted out of them.</p>

  <p><i>Thud,</i> thud. <i>Thud,</i> thud. Black Band snapped an order. The
  company front broke into fours, was a column of fours&mdash;<i>thud,</i>
  thud, <i>thud,</i> thud&mdash;right-angled along a corner, angled again,
  formed twos. Black Band drove them, wove intricate patterns of them all over
  the expanse of gray, clean-swept wood&mdash;<i>thud,</i> thud, <i>thud,</i>
  thud. The legs flashed up and down again, pistonlike up and down. The bodies
  moved like cogs on a conveyor belt, like a machine. The heels hammered on the
  floor, pounded on the wood, hammered out hate; hammered out war; shaped
  death; forged destruction. <i>Thud,</i> thud. <i>One,</i> two. <i>One,</i>
  two. <i>Thud,</i> thud, <i>thud...</i></p>

  <p>Black Band barked, and the lines were immobile once more, frozen. Black
  Band wheeled sharply, clicked heels together, was a ramrod stiff, rigid
  statue. His right arm angled to his forehead, its fingers stiffly
  horizontal.</p>

  <p>Narrow, ladderlike stairs pitched sharply down from a square opening in
  the ceiling. A short slender man stood halfway down the stairs; round thick
  lenses making owl-like his sharp, rapacious features. His pinch-nostrilled
  nose was a hooked beak. The tiny black dab of a mustache under it only
  accentuated the sexless cruelty of his colorless lips.</p>

  <p>The newcomer went up again through the ceiling. Black Band wheeled,
  barked. The lines broke. The machines were men again; shabby except for the
  green shirts from whose sleeves they tore the arm bands as they poured across
  the loft toward where clothing was piled in a long heap against the wall.
  Black Band strode to the stairs, climbed out of sight.</p>

  <p>The men were overcoated, hatted, and they looked like two-score young men
  who had been attending a meeting of some social club that now was breaking
  up. They seemed in no hurry to leave, but the group steadily
  dwindled.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN the alley there was the sound of a cautiously opened
  door, the sound of cautious feet slinking toward the river. After a space
  during which one might count ten the same sounds once more disturbed the
  murky silence.</p>

  <p>When the great loft had been thus entirely drained of its occupants, the
  lights blinked out. The room was absolutely dark, absolutely lifeless.</p>

  <p>Just over the threshold of hearing, metal clicked against metal. Rusted
  hinges rasped briefly. There was a whisper of movement in the blackness. A
  stair tread creaked, as though the warehouse's old timbers were settling a
  bit.</p>

  <p>There was no longer any shadow on the lean-to roof.</p>

  <p>On the floor above that where a secret company had drilled, the darkness
  was just as intense, but here there was a low murmur of voices from somewhere
  far back, and a sense that the space was filled to its ceiling by huge black
  hulks.</p>

  <p>Jute-covered bales were piled there, through whose burlap a probing hand
  might manage to feel round hard objects; the size of coconuts and as
  round.</p>

  <p>They were not coconuts. They were too regularly corrugated for that, and
  the chill of metal penetrated through the jute. They were bombs in those
  mounded bales, thousands of hand grenades that needed only the release of a
  tiny lever to blast all about them into fragments. Beyond them were high
  stacks of flat cases, just the length of rifles, and beyond those, other,
  stubbier cases that might quite possibly contain ammunition for those
  rifles.</p>

  <p>At the rear of this storage room with its curious contents, a small space
  was partitioned off by a solid board wall that reached to the ceiling. Within
  the windowless chamber thus formed was a table on which a large and detailed
  map of the United States was outspread, a map studded by pins with
  varicolored heads, by tiny, multihued flags.</p>

  <p>A great slate slab was bracketed to the room's rear wall, its surface
  gleaming with copper bus-bars, with bright switches, with the white-faced
  dials of gauges. Black wires coiled from the slab to another, smaller table
  whose surface was entirely covered by the orderly tangle of a radio telephone
  receiver and transmitter.</p>

  <p>A wizened, pasty-faced little man crouched over this table, perched
  tensely at the very edge of a chair, the round black disks of ear-phones
  clamped to his head. There were chairs near the larger table, but the three
  men clustered around it were on their feet, and they were bent over the map
  for all the world like the General Staff of an army in the midst of a long
  battle, planning the next day's strategy.</p>

  <p>"Reports from the West Coast," Owl-Eyes said, "are very satisfactory." His
  voice was sexless as his mouth. "Friday the longshoremen will again go on
  strike. The seamen will join them."</p>

  <p>"That will go well enough now without more help from us." Black Band spoke
  with thick-tongued, guttural satisfaction. "They are stubborn, those brutes
  who load and unload the vessels and those who handle them, and the
  ship-owners are just as stubborn. There will be trouble. This time, with the arms
  and bombs with which the strikers have been supplied from a mysterious source
  about which they have not asked many questions, that trouble will not be over
  till America no longer has a merchant fleet on the Pacific."</p>

  <p>"In the coal mines," Owl-Eyes' white, slim hand gestured across the map's
  east central portion, "they have been sitting down for a week, but the
  governors of Pennsylvania and West Virginia have almost brought the union and
  the owners together."</p>

  <p>"Tonight that is true," Black Band agreed, "but here," his spatulate thumb
  pressed down a pin in Pennsylvania's Carbon County, "at dawn tomorrow, a
  company guard will be shot at from the entrance of mine. He will not be
  injured, because he is one of ours, but he will fire back, and before what
  that commences is ended the flame of riot will be a conflagration and there
  will be no hope of peace between miners and operators."</p>

  <p>"We have enough trained men on both sides to make certain of that," Owl
  Eyes explained.</p>

  <p>Both men, their perfect English only slightly marred by a vaguely foreign
  intonation, were quite evidently speaking for the benefit of the
  third.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE was shorter than either, and so grossly obese that his
  torso was a flabby sphere. His hair was thin on his glistening scalp and the
  great billows of fat that formed his cheeks and his grotesquely narrow neck
  swamped his queerly tiny features, so that only his shrewd little eyes seemed
  alive. His columnar arms ended in hands that were crudely shaped blobs the
  color of dough which a child's grimy fingers have kneaded, an unhealthly hue
  that was repeated in his expressionless countenance.</p>

  <p>He nodded, this Third Man, but made no other acknowledgment of what had
  been said to him.</p>

  <p>"In the oil fields," Owl-Eyes began again, "it is as yet quiet. But Carlit
  has made plans for them."</p>

  <p>"There they have not been easy to fool," Black Band took up the gambit
  just passed to him. "There are too few unreasoning laborers, too many skilled
  and intelligent workers, for the American agitators or our own emissaries to
  stir them up. In Texas, in California, I have started infiltrating my Green
  Shirts among them, have been establishing caches of rifles and machine-guns.
  They are yet too few, but in a month..."</p>

  <p><i>"A month!"</i> The Third Man's tones were soft and without inflection.
  "That is not soon enough by thirty days." They came from a wee rose-bud mouth
  so small as to be almost infantile, and issuing out of that tremendous bulk
  there was something&mdash;dreadful&mdash;about them.</p>

  <p>"You two, Carlit, Horon, are too slow, entirely too slow, in your
  preparations. That is why I was sent here, that is why I hastened to this
  place as soon as I landed.</p>

  <p>"We have drained ourselves dry, have poured gold into our sea fleets and
  our fleets of the air; into shells, and munitions, and gas. Today we are
  ready to strike, and you, you who for two years have had time to enfeeble
  this land, to stir up class against class, brother against brother, to
  prepare for our onslaught so that when we do strike there shall be no doubt
  of our quick and complete victory&mdash;you prate to me of months.</p>

  <p>"Months!"</p>

  <p>"Those oil fields must be aflame three days from now. The railroads must
  be wrecked, the mines destroyed. Three days from now your Green Shirts must
  be on the move, for three days from now our airplane carriers will be within
  two hours' flight of the Eastern Seaboard, those of our allies as near the
  Western, and our leader will give the signal for hostilities to begin."</p>

  <p>"But that is impossible," Owl-Eyes, Horon, jerked out. "We cannot be
  ready."</p>

  <p>"The last contingents of Green Shirts are not sufficiently trained,"
  Carlit groaned. "You have seen those I myself have drilled..."</p>

  <p>"I have seen them," the Third Man responded, in that soft, terrible voice
  of his. "They are better trained than our soldiers. You will send them at
  once to that Texas of which you speak. You will give orders at once for the
  Green Shirts in the other centers across the continent of which you have told
  me to be on the move to their posts. You will have your transportation units
  begin at once the distribution of the munitions from your caches, like this
  one outside."</p>

  <p>"At once..."</p>

  <p>"And you will inform everyone that the signal for them to go into action
  will be the appearance over them of the black-winged planes of our land.
  Three days from now America must be in flames."</p>

  <p>"But," Carlit gasped, "our communications system has not yet been
  perfected. Once our forces begin moving, there will be no way to recall them.
  If the Leader should change his mind, should decide to delay..."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Third Man shot one grim look at Carlit, silencing the
  protest. Then he spoke slowly.</p>

  <p>"The Leader cannot change his mind. He dares not delay. The women of our
  land are awake at last, the mothers.</p>

  <p>"They point to their starving babies, their famished children and cry out
  against the Leader. 'We cannot feed them with gunpowder,' they cry. 'We
  cannot clothe them with the gray steel of your battleships. The coal they
  need to warm them is in the bunkers of your fleets, you grease the motors of
  your airships with the butter for the lack of which they die. We want no
  World-Empire, no conquests. We want milk for our babies. We want bread for
  them. We shall have them, if to gain them we must rend you limb from
  limb.'</p>

  <p>"Their ultimatum lies on the Leader's desk. A week from now the mothers
  will be on the march, mothers enraged and battling for their children."</p>

  <p>"A week!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think any army in the world can stop a host of maddened mothers?
  Do you think anything can stop them if the Leader cannot say to them, a week
  from now; 'Here. Here are the wheat fields of America, the riches of the New
  World for your babies, and for their babies. You have starved that never
  again shall our people starve.'"</p>

  <p>The others stared, silent.</p>

  <p>"No? I thought not. Give the signal! You there at the wireless! Send the
  signal out!"</p>

  <p>The pasty-faced man turned his head and looked questioningly at Carlit.
  Owl-Eyes nodded. The radio man's finger touched a switch and vacuum bulbs
  glowed into sudden light on the table. The finger moved again, reaching for
  the telegraph key that would send out a signal for America's destruction, a
  signal that could not be recalled...</p>

  <p>The radio man slithered down in his chair, thudded from it to the floor. A
  fine, pungent mist followed him down, a mist that had jetted in that final
  instant across the room.</p>

  <p>"Hold it!" husked from the partition door, flung open now. "Just as you
  are. Move a muscle and I let you have it!"</p>

  <p>The shadow that had prowled the lean-to roof was poised, black, ominous,
  in the doorway. The blackness was that of an ebon-hued cloak enveloping a
  tensely vibrant form. A black felt hat was pulled low over a countenance
  faceless because it was completely hidden behind a stygian mask through which
  only eye-glint showed. One black-gloved hand was visible, menacing Carlit and
  Horon and the Third Man with the curiously thick-barrelled pistol from which
  the spray had jetted that had paralysed the radio operator.</p>

  <p>The fingers that grasped the butt of that odd weapon were black. That
  which was curled about the pistols trigger was red, the red of spurting,
  arterial blood!</p>

  <p>"Red Finger!" the Third Man gasped, staggering back a pace as if stunned
  by the sight of that scarlet digit, then freezing at a menacing dart of the
  thick-mouthed gun. "Red Finger!"</p>

  <p>"Red Finger it is," the shadow's ghastly voice agreed. "The one man in
  America your schemers could not fool. Red Finger, here to greet the new
  ambassador from...."</p>

  <p>"The second reason for my being sent here," the Third Man interrupted.
  "The Leader has empowered me to offer the headship of his American Secret
  Service when we shall have conquered the United States, at a million dollars
  a year."</p>

  <p>A short mocking laugh came from beneath the black mask.</p>

  <p>Mask, robe, that scarlet trigger finger, were the badge of America's
  greatest counter-spy. Known only as Red Finger, he was execrated in half the
  chancelleries of the world. It might have been the blood of his country's
  enemies with which was dyed the digit that gave him his name, so many of them
  had died because of him.</p>

  <p>"Your leader will never conquer the United...."</p>

  <p>A noose, flicking out of the darkness behind him, closed on Red Finger's
  throat and choked the sentence off. Another went lower, pinioning his arms,
  in the same brief instant a hand, darting past his elbow, slashed his gas gun
  from his hand. He was caught at last! Red Finger was fairly caught at
  last!</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Third Man laughed, his great belly shaking jelly-like.
  "The one American we did not fool," he spluttered. "The great Red
  Finger."</p>

  <p>The other two moved forward.</p>

  <p>The counter-spy made no attempt at a fruitless struggle. He stood erect,
  seeming somehow supremely unconquered though the tight lariat cut into his
  arms, though he must be half-strangled by the noose on his throat.</p>

  <p>"It was too easy," the Third Man chuckled. "When I stepped back at your so
  melodramatic entrance I stepped into the invisible beam of a photo-ray
  apparatus that alarmed the watchers at the door below. You did not think we
  conferred here blissfully without protection of any sort, did you?"</p>

  <p>"No," Red Finger managed to push through his clamped larynx. "No."</p>

  <p>There was no longer any humor in the Third Man's high voice, none in his
  face. "And so the career of Red Finger is over. My mission is indeed a
  success."</p>

  <p>"Shall I let him have it now, Your Excellency?" The gruff question came
  from behind Red Finger. "I have a knife. I can slit him here, under the left
  shoulder, and he won't bleed at all."</p>

  <p>The Third Man's wee mouth twitched. "No," he said softly. "Not just yet.
  First he shall watch us send the signal that means his country's end. Carlit.
  You can manipulate that wireless, can you not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, your Excellency," Black Band responded.</p>

  <p>"Then go ahead."</p>

  <p>Black Band turned, thumped stiff-legged toward the instrument...</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Red Finger snapped. "Don't touch that key if you do not wish to
  die!"</p>

  <p>Lashed and helpless as he was, something in the way he said that carried
  utter conviction. Momentarily at least. Carlit hesitated, half-turned...</p>

  <p>The Third Man peered at the counterspy intently.</p>

  <p>"I've got one of your Mills bombs in my other hand," Red Finger continued,
  "under this cloak. The pin is out and the lever is held down only by my
  thumb. If you move another inch I'll let go&mdash;and the explosion will set
  off all the bales of them on this floor."</p>

  <p>"You lie," Carlit growled.</p>

  <p>"Move and see... You in back of me, I feel your knife against my back.
  Sink it, if you dare. A dead thumb will not hold the grenade lever down."</p>

  <p>What little color there had been was drained from Owl Eyes' face. "You
  will be the first to die. There are thousands of bombs out there, they'll go
  off..."</p>

  <p>"None of us will have to be buried," Red Finger agreed. "But that signal
  of yours will not be sent.</p>

  <p>"No." His faceless head moved to the Third Man. "I did not imagine that
  your conference was unguarded. It was too easy for me to approach and
  eavesdrop on it, so I took my precautions. The game's up, Your Excellency,
  and you know it."</p>

  <p>The Third Man blinked.</p>

  <p>"What is it you wish me to do?"</p>

  <p>Red Finger spoke briskly.</p>

  <p>"You have a choice. Order your man Carlit to send a message I shall
  dictate, give me your parole of honor that Carlit and Horon will go back
  across the sea on the first available steamer, and remain there, and I will
  permit you to go to Washington and take up your duties as ambassador. Refuse,
  and I lift my thumb from the lever."</p>

  <p>The fat-thickened lids slitted, so that the tiny eyes beneath them almost
  vanished. There was a moment of brittle silence, while the fate of two
  nations hung in the balance of one man's decision. Then:</p>

  <p>"What is the message you wish sent?" the Third Man sighed. "It will be
  sent exactly as you wish." There was something magnificent in the way he
  accepted defeat.</p>

  <p>Red Finger shrugged. "I shall be sure of that. I can read the
  code&mdash;in any language. Ready Mr. Carlit?"</p>

  <p>Black Band nodded, his face purple with a rage that did not permit speech,
  his hand on the instrument's key.</p>

  <p>"Here is the message. 'To all Green Shirt units wherever located. Our
  plans have been countermanded by the Leader.'" The whistling signal was
  clearly audible from the ear-phones that had been jerked from the operator's
  head as he fell. "'All previous orders are cancelled. Destroy all munitions
  caches. Destroy all weapons in your possession. Disband all units. By
  authority of the Leader's personal ambassador.'"</p>

  <p>It was finished. The Third Man spread his gross arms wide, in a gesture
  almost pathetic. "What now, Red Finger?"</p>

  <p>"Now," the shadow answered, "you will order these ropes removed from me
  and we shall go down, single file, out of this place, Horon carrying the
  radio man. Then I shall bid you goodbye."</p>

  <p>The Third Man nodded slowly, gestured to Carlo and Horon, and led the way
  from the room.</p>

  <p>Five figures slithered out of a riverfront alley's mouth, paused in the
  center of the wide cobbled street that was now deserted, though in a few
  hours it would resound with the roar of traffic.</p>

  <p>"Where's Red Finger?" Horon inquired. "Where's...." His voice was drowned
  by a thunderous explosion, by a red flame spurting high into the
  heavens....</p>

  <p>"I don't know where Red Finger went," the Third Man husked, "but there
  went the end of a dream of empire."</p><br>

  <p class="first">A WEEK after the events related herewith, Ford Duane stood
  in the door-way of his second-hand bookshop on Fourth Avenue. It was a
  glorious morning and even in that dusty thoroughfare the sun was a white
  glory.</p>

  <p>Duane held a newspaper in his hands.</p>

  <p>The headlines across its outspread page read:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">COAL MINE AGREEMENT SIGNED,<br>
  LONGSHOREMEN VOTE NO STRIKE.<br>
  PRESIDENT'S FIRESIDE CHAT HAILS DAWN<br>
  OF NEW ERA OF INDUSTRIAL GOOD WILL.</p><br>

  <p>Down near the middle of the sheet, just below the fold, a much smaller
  headline announced that a certain incoming ambassador to Washington, having
  presented his credentials, in a special interview had predicted a lessening
  of war tension.</p>

  <p>And at the bottom of the page, a brief cabled dispatch from that envoy's
  country described the "return from maneuvers" of the dictator's armed aerial
  forces and the dispersal of their pilots and observers to civilian
  life....</p>

  <p>A brief smile flicked across the gaunt bookseller's weary face and faded.
  He turned, and moved slowly to his desk.</p>

  <p>A grey silk scarf was arranged in a swirl beneath the goose-neck lamp. On
  the scarf there rested a corrugated metal ball the size of a coconut, a tiny
  lever wired down to its surface.</p>
