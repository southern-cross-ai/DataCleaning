<P class="first">
IT is a natural thing for the humanitarian to say, of any man convicted of
wilful murder, that he could not have been sane when he performed the act; and
when murder is done in such circumstances and in such an atmosphere as that
which marked the destruction of Emily Beilby Kaye, more profoundly does the
mind of a balanced man grow bewildered.</P>

<P>Yet all things were possible with Patrick Herbert Mahon, whose form of
insanity took the shape of a colossal vanity. Mahon was a man of pleasing
address, popular with women and with his fellow men. For all his anti-social
acts, he was in the way of being a social success in certain circumstances in
those circles to which he had the <I>entr&eacute;e</I>.</P>

<P>He was born in Liverpool; one of a large family of struggling middle-class
folk&mdash;a boy of some small talent and an assiduous attendant at Sunday
school.
So he became an office boy, ultimately a junior clerk. He continued to go
regularly to church and took a vivid interest in its social affairs. He
displayed some prowess in athletics and was particularly fond of football,
becoming indeed a prominent member of one of the local church teams. His early
mode of life is described as having been a model for all young men.</P>

<P>At school he first met the pretty, dark-haired girl to whom his life was to
become so tragically linked. She was two years younger than he, and their
school friendship developed into something warmer at a later stage. Indeed,
they were both in their teens when he first proposed marriage. There was strong
opposition by both families and it was two years after this&mdash;in
1910&mdash;that they
were married. He was then twenty and the girl eighteen.</P>

<P>Perhaps it was a reckless marriage. But this at least should be said. If
any woman could have deflected Mahon from the path that was to lead to the
scaffold, it was Mrs. Mahon. With singular devotion she held to him through the
black and anxious years to the end. Hers is the real tragedy of this story.</P>

<P>Within a year of their marriage he had forged and uttered cheques for £123
on the firm which employed him. With this money he took a girl to the Isle of
Man. He was traced, brought back, and bound over. Mrs. Mahon forgave him and
they left Liverpool to start life anew.</P>

<P>Ultimately he obtained a position with a dairy firm in Wiltshire. There is
no doubt that he had a fund of business ability, and this, with an apparent
genial vivacity of manner, served him well for a time. He was still a
&#8216;sportsman&#8217;, and played football for a local team.</P>

<P>About this time a little girl was born. Hard upon this Mahon was arrested
for embezzling £60 from his employers and was sentenced at Dorchester Assizes
to twelve months&#8217; imprisonment.</P>

<P>Upon his release he is known to have lived for a while in the neighbourhood
of Caine, Wiltshire. There was a mysterious epidemic of burglaries in this
neighbourhood, and it may or may not have been a coincidence that Mahon
suddenly decided to seek other quarters.</P>

<P>He is next heard of at Sunningdale, where he was employed by a dairy. This
time there were some love affairs which provoked a little scandal. Again Mahon
was thrown out of work. There is a gap here which the imagination may easily
fill in. Mahon had become interested in racing, and, when opportunity offered,
attended race meetings in many capacities&mdash;preferably as a bookmaker&#8217;s
clerk.</P>

<P>However that may be, it fell on a day in the early part of 1916 that a
branch of the National Provincial Bank at Sunningdale was entered at night. A
maid-servant who interrupted the intruder was ferociously attacked with a
hammer. When she regained consciousness she found herself in the arms of Mahon,
who was kissing her. Later Mahon, who had dodged to Wallasey, was arrested and
tried at Guildford Assizes for the offence. It was brought plainly home, and
after he had been found guilty he made a whining appeal to the judge to be
allowed to join the Army. Lord Darling sternly retorted that he was a thorough-
paced hypocrite whom the Army could do without, and sentenced him to five
years&#8217; penal servitude.</P>

<P>That term he served. A boy was born in 1916, but died a year or two later
without having seen his father. Mrs. Mahon, left to her own resources, with
indomitable courage sought a living for her little girl and herself. She
obtained a post with Consols Automatic Aerators Ltd., which had a factory at
Sunbury. Her efficiency and energy soon attracted the attention of the heads of
the firm, and she was promoted to a responsible position.</P>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<P class="first">MAHON came back from prison&mdash;full of promises of reform,
anxious to be
again with his wife. Observe that he always came back&mdash;that Mrs. Mahon
always
took him back. Superintendent Carlin of Scotland Yard made a shrewd observation
on this trait: &#8220;He was keenly disposed to &#8216;philandering&#8217; or having &#8216;affairs&#8217;
with this or that woman casually as they attracted him. But he never, I am
convinced, wished to sever his connection with his domestic hearth. He felt in
his his own mind that the woman he had married was his sheet anchor; that, if
he cast off from her, he would be adrift.&#8221;</P>

<P>They settled down in a flat in Pagoda Avenue, Richmond, and Mrs. Mahon used
her influence to procure him a berth as a soda-fountain salesman with her firm.
Mahon did well&mdash;so well that when in May, 1922, the business was put in the
hands of a Receiver he was appointed sales manager.</P>

<P>Now it chanced that the Receiver of the Company, a member of a firm of
chartered accountants, in the beginning of 1923 engaged as a typist a
woman&mdash;
she can scarcely be described as a girl, since she was then thirty-seven years
old, Miss Emily Beilby Kaye.</P>

<P>Miss Kaye had maintained herself by her own efforts for many years. She was
a competent, experienced woman, not uncomely, who lived at a bachelor girls&#8217;
club, and had managed to put by a sum of money, considerable for one in her
position. She was not in the least averse from a flirtation with the handsome
sales manager, this suburban Lothario, with whom business circumstances now
brought her in contact.</P>

<P>The affair developed rapidly. She at least fell violently in love. Mahon
may have thought that it would end as other episodes of this kind had before
ended for him. But Emily Kaye was not easily discarded, I think we may accept
Mahon&#8217;s own words on this point:</P>

<P>&#8220;Just before Christmas, Miss Kaye was dismissed from the office where she
was employed, and, as a result, had a lot of time on her hands, and she wished
me to see her more frequently which I was unwilling to do for several reasons.
She reproached me on several occasions as being cold, and told me quite plainly
that she wished my affection and was determined to win it if possible. I felt
sorry for the fact that she had been dismissed and did, as a result, meet her a
bit more frequently. I temporized in the hope of gaining time, but from that
moment I felt more or less at the mercy of a strong-minded woman, whom, though
I liked her in many ways, I did not tremendously care for.&#8221;</P>

<P>Mahon was embarrassed&mdash;perhaps a little scared. But he went on, and
there
were certain dabblings with francs in which he was proved to have had some
concern, with Miss Kaye&#8217;s money. He asserted that some of his own money had
been used in these transactions, but there can be no question that the funds
were provided by the woman. Miss Kaye was for a short while in employment, but
again fell out of work and some time in February, 1924, she probably became
aware that she was pregnant. Said Mahon:</P>

<P>&#8220;She became thoroughly unsettled and begged me to give up everything and go
abroad with her&#8230;. I plainly told her that I could not agree to such a course. I
agreed to consider the matter, however, in the hope of gaining some time, but
she suggested I should take a holiday and go away with her for a week or two,
and take a bungalow, where we would be alone together, and where she would
convince me with her love that I should be perfectly happy with her.&#8221;</P>

<P>This was the immediate prologue to the tragedy. Miss Kaye was not as some
of the other women Mahon had made his playthings. She could not be easily
thrown aside.</P>

<P>Apart from this episode, Mahon felt the ground solid beneath his feet. His
income was more considerable than it had ever been and, added to that of his
wife, allowed a very comfortable existence. He was happy in his work; he was
popular among his social acquaintances in Richmond and the neighbourhood. He
had become secretary of a local bowling club. Save to his wife, his past was
utterly unknown. The future looked full of promise. All this would have to be
jettisoned, his career, his friends, his home&mdash;and he had a sort of
attachment
to his wife and little girl&mdash;if he yielded to Miss Kaye and took to
flight with
her.</P>

<P>He fought weakly to save himself. Even so, he might have succeeded, had not
fate put into the hands of Emily Kaye somewhere about this time a weapon
against which he felt impotent. It was the first of a number of strange
coincidences with which the case was marked. No reference was made to it at the
trial, nor did it leak out in the newspapers.</P>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<P class="first">EMILY KAYE was clearing a drawer of some of her belongings.
At the bottom
of the drawer someone had placed a sheet of newspaper. And as she took it out
her eye lighted casually on the name of Patrick Mahon. Thus she read of his
trial at Guildford Assizes.</P>

<P>It may be assumed that she used this knowledge in her interviews with
Mahon. She pressed the idea of &#8216;a love experiment&#8217;, and he gave way. He engaged
a bungalow on the stretch of lonely beach between Eastbourne and Pevensey Bay
for two months, using the assumed name of Waller. This bungalow, known
indifferently as &#8216;Officer&#8217;s House&#8217; and &#8216;Langney Bungalow&#8217;, had formerly been
the official residence of the officer in command of a coastguard station.</P>

<P>This was at the beginning of April, 1924. Miss Kaye received the news with
some coldness. She had not intended the &#8216;experiment&#8217; to last longer than a few
days. However, she sold out her remaining shares, and went down to stay at
Eastbourne by herself while she looked over the place. Mahon was to join her
later.</P>

<P>He was very worried: &#8220;I felt in myself very depressed and miserable, and
did not wish to spend the three or four days together as she desired, but as I
had given my word, and as I felt that I could definitely prove&#8230; how foolish the
hope was on her part to expect to keep my affection, even could she gain it, I
thought I had better go through with it.&#8221;</P>

<P>Yet the ruling passion was still strong in him. Two days before he was to
take possession of the bungalow with Miss Kaye he met Miss Duncan&mdash;a
stranger&mdash;
in the street at Richmond, and although it was a wet night walked with her most
of the way to her home at Richmond. He remarked that his married life was a
tragedy, and invited her to dine with him on the following Wednesday. The
episode gives a clue to the psychology of the man. Murder must have been very
close to his mind at that time, and yet he could philander with still another
woman.</P>

<P>On April 12 he purchased a saw and knife at a shop in Victoria Street, and
travelling down to Eastbourne met Miss Kaye at the station. They took a cab to
the bungalow, and so the &#8216;love experiment&#8217; started. So far as his home and his
firm was concerned Mahon was supposed to be travelling &#8216;on business&#8217;.</P>

<P>Miss Kaye had set her heart on eloping to South Africa. She had informed
her friends that she was engaged&mdash;she had shown some of them a ring-and
that
her fianc&eacute; had a good post at the Cape. In a letter written to a friend
on April 14 she said that she and &#8216;Pat&#8217; intended to spend a little time in
Paris before going out. This was the last communication that any of her friends
or relatives had from her.</P>

<P>On Tuesday, April 15, the two travelled to London together. Mahon had
agreed to apply for a passport, but when they met in the evening to return to
Eastbourne he told her that he had not done so, and did not intend to do so. A
quarrel broke out in the train.</P>

<P>If Mahon&#8217;s story is to be credited the woman presented him with an
ultimatum when they reached the bungalow. She insisted that he should write to
friends that he intended going to Paris and thence to South Africa. Mahon
refused, and Miss Kaye, in an access of ungovernable fury first threw a coal
axe at him, and then attacked him with her bare hands. In the
struggle&mdash;this is
Mahon&#8217;s version&mdash;they fell, and she struck her head on a coal cauldron. A
little later he realized that she was dead.</P>

<P>I mention Mahon&#8217;s explanation, but few people will be found to believe that
it was other than a cold-blooded and premeditated murder. Clearly he knew that
he would be free the following evening, for he had during the day wired to Miss
Duncan making an appointment.</P>

<P>His story of consternation and horror has a genuine ring. Mahon was a man
of temperament and he felt the reaction. He was face to face with the problem
that has confronted many murderers&mdash;the disposal of the body. And
although he
seems to have formed his plans beforehand&mdash;witness the purchase of the
saw and
the knife&mdash;he had not the nerve to put them into immediate execution. He
carried the body to a spare bedroom and covered it with a fur coat.</P>

<P>That night he spent in Eastbourne, and on the next evening he dined in
London with Miss Duncan. He remarked that he was staying at a charming bungalow
and induced her to agree to pay him a visit two days later&mdash;on Good
Friday. He
confirmed this the following day by a wire from Eastbourne, &#8216;Meet train as
arranged, Waller,&#8217; and sent a telegraphic money order for four pounds.</P>

<P>This was on the face of it the act of a lunatic. The body was still at the
bungalow. The man was taking a grotesque chance&mdash;for what? He himself
gave the
answer: &#8220;The damned place was haunted; I wanted human companionship.&#8221;</P>

<P>Unquestionably Mahon&#8217;s nerve was badly shaken and yet to all outward
appearance he gave no sign. Miss Duncan does not appear to have had any
suspicion and she went down to Eastbourne on Good Friday afternoon and was met
by Mahon and taken to the bungalow. That day before her arrival he had
commenced a sinister work, and there was one room that was barred to his
visitor. He told her that it contained valuable books.</P>

<P>The next day he left her at Eastbourne and went by himself to Plumpton
Races. Here he was noticed by an acquaintance who attached no special
significance to the meeting, although it proved to be of vital importance in
the chain of circumstance that was to betray the murderer.</P>

<P>Mahon realized by now that the presence of Miss Duncan was going to
embarrass him. So he concocted a telegram in a fictitious name and despatched
it to himself as Waller at the bungalow, making an appointment in London for an
early hour on Tuesday morning. Thus he was afforded an excuse for cutting short
Miss Duncan&#8217;s stay. They returned to town on Easter Monday, and somewhere about
midnight Mahon arrived back at his home at Kew.</P>

<P>He was back at the bungalow on Tuesday. Here I may tell a curious story
which did not come out in evidence. He had already partly dismembered the body,
and he now set to work with the intention of disposing of the remains
piecemeal. The day was dark and heavy. He built a huge fire in the room and
upon this placed the head. At that moment the storm broke with an appalling
crash of thunder and a violent flash of lightning. As the head lay upon the
coals the dead eyes opened, and Mahon, in his shirtsleeves as he was, fled
blindly out to the rain-swept shingle of the deserted shore. When he nerved
himself to return the fire had done its work.</P>

<P>It was an extraordinary coincidence that whilst he was giving evidence at
his trial a thunderstorm was also raging. He gave calm denial when he was asked
if he had desired the death of Miss Kaye. Almost on his words the court was
illumined by lightning and re-echoed with the crash of thunder. Those who saw
his face and knew the truth will never forget that moment when the sound of the
storm brought back to his mind that fearful midnight scene. He was a broken man
when he faced the deadly crossexamination of Sir Henry Curtis Bennett.</P>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<P class="first">MAHON discovered that with every method his ingenuity could
suggest the
disposal of the body was likely to be a long job. Meanwhile he had to show
himself at his office and his home. He returned to his home on the Tuesday
night, and during the rest of the week he had to be at his work. On Saturday
and Sunday he renewed his labours. On Sunday he conceived the idea of
distributing some pieces of the dismembered body from a railway carriage
window.</P>

<P>He spent some time over the gruesome business of packing a Gladstone bag.
No chance seems to have offered itself on the journey to London that evening
but he did succeed in getting rid of some portions between Waterloo Station and
Richmond. But he was unable completely to empty the bag, and he decided to go
on to Reading. The night he spent at an hotel in that town.</P>

<P>The next day&mdash;Monday&mdash;he returned to London. The bag was now
empty save for
the wrappings he had used and a cook&#8217;s knife. These he probably intended to
destroy later. He was acute enough to realize that if he had thrown them away
they might have been identified.</P>

<P>The bag he left at one of the cloakrooms at Waterloo Station and went home.
Now, although Mrs. Mahon had forgiven more than most women would have done, she
was a person of intelligence. Mahon&#8217;s strange comings and goings of late, his
messages by telegram, his stories of business out of town, did not altogether
impose on her. She knew him too well. Still, although she could not fail to be
suspicious, no glimmer of the real truth was present in her mind. Someone had
mentioned casually that he had met Mahon at Plumpton Races and she feared that
this was an explanation. Her husband had been previously mixed up with
bookmaking and, in spite of his promise to her, it was possible that he had
gone back.</P>

<P>She found the cloakroom ticket in one of his suits. She took a friend into
her confidence&mdash;he had been formerly connected with the railway
police&mdash;and
asked him to discover what it referred to. She had a belief that it might be
some of the paraphernalia used by bookmakers. Thus it came about that the bag
was closely examined. It was locked, but by pulling at the one end some
indication of its grim secret was revealed.</P>

<P>Scotland Yard was immediately informed, and Chief Detective-Inspector
Savage had men posted to watch the cloakroom. Mrs. Mahon was informed that
there was nothing to suggest that her husband was bookmaking.</P>

<P>Mahon returned for the bag on the Friday evening (May 2). As it was handed
to him a detective stopped him.</P>

<P> &#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; "he exclaimed when told that he would be taken to a police
station. This little touch of bravado did not help him. He was taken to the
station and later to Scotland Yard. The bag was opened and was found to contain
a cook&#8217;s knife which had been recently used, two pieces of silk, a towel, a
silk scarf, a pair of torn knickers, and a brown canvas racquet case marked
EBK. Most of these things were blood-stained, and the whole contents of the bag
had been heavily sprinkled with a disinfectant.</P>

<P>Savage confronted his prisoner with these things and asked for an
explanation. Mahon explained, lamely, that he had carried meat for the dogs in
the bag. </P>

<P>&#8220;That will not do,&#8221; said the Inspector. &#8220;These stains are of human blood.&#8221;
</P>

<P>&#8220;You seem to know all about it,&#8221; retorted Mahon.</P>

<P>For a quarter of an hour or more there was silence. Then Mahon spoke. &#8220;I
wonder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you can realize how terrible a thing it is for one&#8217;s body
to be active and one&#8217;s mind to fail to act.&#8221;</P>

<P>Apart from one other muttered remark there was again silence for three-
quarters of an hour. Mahon came to a resolve. &#8220;I suppose you know everything,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I will tell you the truth.&#8221;</P>

<P>He was cautioned, and then he told for the first time his version of the
tragedy. I have drawn upon this and his subsequent statements in this account
of the affair.</P>

<P>The Scotland Yard experts and the East Sussex Constabulary at once got to
work. A search of the bungalow revealed many traces of the crime. There were
portions of the body, and evidence of the attempt to get rid of it. But two
very important parts of the body were missing. No trace of the head could be
found. This, in all probability would have shown exactly how the murder was
committed. There was no trace of the uterus.</P>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<P class="first">THE trial opened at Lewes Assizes during July, 1924, before
Mr. Justice
Avory, an experienced and strong criminal judge. Sir Henry Curtis Bennett led
for the Crown, and Mr. J. D. Cassels, K.C., for the defence.</P>

<P>The point taken by the defence was that the death of Miss Kaye was an
accident, that either during a struggle between Mahon and Miss Kaye she had
died from striking her head against a coal-scuttle, or that in fighting her off
he had unintentionally strangled her. Mr. Cassels handled the case with notable
skill, but he had to fight some deadly and almost irresistible inferences.</P>

<P>Although Sir Bernard Spilsbury, the pathologist, refused to commit himself
to an opinion on the precise manner of death he was definite in his assertion
that it could not have been caused by the woman striking her head against the
coal-scuttle, which was of fragile construction. He was able to say that Miss
Kaye, had she lived, would have become a mother.</P>

<P>All the shifts and deceits of Mahon during his intrigue with Miss Kaye were
exposed to the jury. It was shown that over £500 of Miss Kaye&#8217;s savings had
disappeared. Three one- hundred pound notes, which had been in her possession,
were shown to have been changed by Mahon in false names at various places.
Overwhelming motives were shown by which he might have been actuated to
murder.</P>

<P>The judge&#8217;s charge to the jury was a lucid, perfectly fair, but damning
summary of the case. Within half an hour the jury had found Mahon guilty.</P>

<P>You may say, as has been said, that none but a lunatic could have acted as
he did; but apart from the deed, Mahon acted like a sane, calculating man.</P>

<P>I have referred to Mahon&#8217;s vanity: it is a peculiar trait in all the
&#8216;great&#8217; murderers that they desire to be thought well of. He cannot bear the
thought of leaving a stunned servant maid with a bad opinion (not unnatural) of
the man who assaulted her. He is at all times anxious to be considered by his
respectable companions as a man of substance and a prince of good fellows, a
self-described &#8216;Broth of a bhoy&#8217;.</P>

<P>There was never a more cold-blooded murderer except perhaps George Joseph
Smith, than this unspeakable villain. Even at the end, when he confessed his
guilt to the prison officials, he begged that they would not make public his
confession for fear of the &#8216;bad impression it might make&#8217;.</p>
