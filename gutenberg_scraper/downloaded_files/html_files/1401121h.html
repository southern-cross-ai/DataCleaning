        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">OF ALL modern pictures, this at least held poetry, beauty,
  and a certain grandeur: an airman, bareheaded and youthful, skimming the
  fringe of a lonely shore.</p>

  <p>The sunlight of late afternoon struck the waves at a fast-lengthening
  angle; sand hills mounted into tropical forests that merged inland into a
  line of mountains already darkening in the east.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the picture had one big flaw, known only to the airman
  himself; he had a raging toothache. It had begun about midday, soon after
  leaving Singapore, and had grown worse steadily until, over that golden
  beach, it became sheerly unbearable. Which accounted for the fact that, on a
  suitable stretch of sand, the machine planed down to make a skillful but not
  too easy landing.</p>

  <p>The airman clambered out and lay down in the shadow of one of the wings,
  his chin dolefully in his hands. Presently there came along a much older man;
  heavily built, wrinkled, and yellowed by hot days out of doors. He asked
  briefly what the matter was. The youth looked up, his dumb misery quenching
  any surprise he might have felt that the spot was not as deserted as it had
  looked. "I've got the most hellish toothache," he began, "so I came down to
  see if it would go off if I rested a while."</p>

  <p>"And has it gone off?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"That's too bad. You'd better come along to my place&mdash;it's only a few
  minutes away. We'll see what we can do."</p>

  <p>"If you could give me something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure. They say essence of cloves with a drop of brandy is good. Let's
  try."</p>

  <p>They clambered over the shingle beyond the sand and pushed their way along
  an upward track that wound through heavy undergrowth. The youth was drenched
  with sweat before he had walked many yards; the jungle held the air in warm
  moist pockets. He was vague in mind from the pain of his tooth and from the
  sudden unaccustomed silence in his ears. He was tall and slim and had young,
  proud features&mdash;just a boy not yet twenty.</p>

  <p>When they reached the crest of a low rise, a bungalow came into view,
  perched halfway down a farther slope and looking across a valley littered
  with the sheds and gear of some mining enterprise. It was decently built,
  with wide verandas and a roof of native thatch.</p>

  <p>"I'm alone here," said the older man. "I'm a sort of caretaker&mdash;the
  mine's shut down till the price of tin goes up again. Maybe if there's
  another war&hellip; My name's Carson."</p>

  <p>"I'm David Clair."</p>

  <p>"You say that as if I ought to have heard of you, so I must apologize.
  It's an out-of-the-way place and I don't get much news. The only flying name
  I know is Lindbergh."</p>

  <p>The youth forced a smile. "That's all right. You wouldn't know me if
  that's your standard."</p>

  <p>Carson led the way into a cool dark room furnished comfortably if
  shabbily; a search in a cupboard produced the necessary medicines, and a
  search in another cupboard some other bottles. "Soak this cotton in the oil
  and stick it on the tooth&mdash;don't mind if it hurts a bit at first. And
  then have a drink and make yourself at home."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, but I won't have the drink and I'll try the oil without the
  brandy."</p>

  <p>Carson gave him a quizzical glance which dissolved into a friendly but
  puzzled smile. "As you wish," he said. "I'll leave you to it." When he had
  gone David persevered with the oil and after ten minutes of no noticeable
  improvement the pain suddenly ceased altogether. He got up then with the
  half- frightened joy that such relief always brings. Carson was on the
  veranda, smoking a cigar.</p>

  <p>"Hello, young man&mdash;better? That's fine. We dine at seven&mdash;out of
  cans. You'll stay the night, of course."</p>

  <p>"Looks as if I shall have to&mdash;it's good of you not to mind. I rather
  think I strained my undercarriage in landing and I can't overhaul it till
  daylight."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right. I like company."</p>

  <p>"There's just one thing. I noticed you've a phone. I wonder if I could get
  through to Rangoon&mdash;the airport people there ought to know I'm delayed,
  otherwise they'll be up all night keeping the place lit for me."</p>

  <p>"Sure. You go on resting&mdash;I'll tell 'em all about it."</p>

  <p>The toothache did not recur, and David rested till Carson called him from
  another room. Dinner was served&mdash;certainly out of cans, but agreeably
  tasty and refreshing. "You know," David said, eating hungrily, "I really
  oughtn't to be enjoying myself like this."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I should have been in Rangoon tonight. By the way, you <i>did</i> ring up
  the airport, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all fixed. But why the hurry to get there?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had hoped to lower the Singapore-London record, but I'm afraid
  tonight's delay means I won't have much chance."</p>

  <p>"Is it an awful disappointment?"</p>

  <p>"Not so bad as if I'd <i>nearly</i> done it and then been held up on the
  last lap. As it is, I can just go back to Singapore and try again. But I'll
  see a dentist first."</p>

  <p>"And carry a flask of brandy with you on your next trip, I should advise,
  even if you are teetotal."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not. It's only for this trip. A man in Australia offered me a
  thousand pounds if I made a record flight without touching alcohol, as he
  called it. He thought it would be a good prohibition ad."</p>

  <p>Carson laughed. "You should have gone to the whisky people. They might
  have offered you more."</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't. I tried them."</p>

  <p>Carson laughed again. "Did you, by Jove? What sort of a racket is this,
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if you don't have any money you have to get someone to back you.
  Most of the things that are done in the world seem to be paid for by people
  who don't want to do them themselves."</p>

  <p>"True."</p>

  <p>David flushed embarrassedly. "I've often thought it out like that. On a
  long flight, you know, there's hours and hours for thinking things out."</p>

  <p>"I guess there must be. And who's backing you on this trip?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty much as usual. The fuel company supplies the juice and you sell
  your story in advance to some newspaper, and then you can always make a bit
  extra by saying what you've eaten&mdash;somebody's chocolate or meat-cubes or
  something."</p>

  <p>"And do you really eat them?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. They're all right as a rule. I don't find it matters much what I
  eat, so long as I don't get toothache."</p>

  <p>"Is there much money in the game?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless you strike it lucky. Of course that's what you always hope
  for. There's a sporting chance."</p>

  <p>"Like mining for men of my generation, I suppose. What made you take it
  up?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing else to do. I'd always been interested in cars and engines, and
  when my boss bought a plane I used to fly him about on the cattle station. In
  Queensland, that was. I flew first when I was sixteen&mdash;I've sort of
  grown up with it. My boss had land seventy miles across, so a plane was more
  use than a car. Then he lost all he had in the wool slump and I found a job
  with an air- mail company. Nothing else for me&mdash;flying is all I can do.
  I was never any good at school."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>After a pause David added. "So I think in the morning I'll get back to
  Singapore and make plans for having another shot&hellip; The worst of it is,
  the big firms get tired of you after a time if you don't have any luck."</p>

  <p>"And haven't you&mdash;yet?"</p>

  <p>"Six months ago I was the first person to fly solo from Broome to
  Surabaya."</p>

  <p>"That sounds pretty good."</p>

  <p>"I know. But I was a fool&mdash;I just did it without any fuss, and the
  result was, there <i>wasn't</i> any fuss."</p>

  <p>"I'm just beginning to wonder whether you're really a very simple or a
  very shrewd young man."</p>

  <p>"Both, I daresay." David smiled, accepting a cigar and puffing luxuriously
  as he added: "Thank heaven nobody paid me not to smoke."</p>

  <p>"You evidently keep your promises."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes. It's kind of fair, I think. And after all, it's not for long.
  Take the bad with the good, that's my motto. And better luck next time. I'll
  go back to Singapore tomorrow, anyway."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure that you will," Carson told him.</p>

  <p>"Why, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Carson replied slowly: "I'm afraid you've got to prepare yourself for an
  item of bad news."</p>

  <p>"About my machine?" David looked up with sharp alarm. "It's all right,
  surely? I left it well above the tide mark."</p>

  <p>"Your machine's all right. It's something a bit more serious than
  that."</p>

  <p>But the relief on David's face conveyed the distinct impression that
  nothing at all could be more serious than that. "What then?" he asked,
  composedly.</p>

  <p>"I delayed telling you because you couldn't possibly get away tonight, in
  any case, and I didn't want to spoil your meal. The fact is, when I rang up
  Rangoon to tell them about your being here, they asked me if you were the
  David Clair who was flying a Speedmore Hornet. I said I supposed you
  were."</p>

  <p>"That's right."</p>

  <p>"It seems there was a cable for you that arrived at Singapore just after
  you left, and they wired it on to Rangoon. Rather bad news from home."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"Your father. He's ill and they want you to get home as soon as you
  can."</p>

  <p>After a pause David answered, calmly: "If that's so, I'd better fly on,
  then."</p>

  <p>"Looks to me as if you had. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>David stared at the table. After another pause he added: "Good of you to
  break it gently. Actually, though, I haven't seen much of my family for quite
  a time."</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>"Living in Australia, you know, since I was a kid. Matter of fact, I never
  got on with them&mdash;went to live with an uncle in Brisbane. Father and
  mother were both traveling all the while&mdash;I shouldn't have seen much of
  them, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Traveling all the while, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He's a concert pianist. Quite a good one, I'm told."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever visit Bucharest?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be surprised&mdash;he went to most places, especially before
  mother died."</p>

  <p>"Francis Clair&mdash;that's the name?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's <i>his</i> name. You've heard him?"</p>

  <p>"More than that. I think I once met him. In Bucharest."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE two men faced each other during a short silence. David
  was slightly excited, aware of some special drama in the occasion. Gazing
  through the blur of lamplight at the tropic sky into which the moon was just
  rising, he said, contemplatively: "Rather a remarkable character, my father,
  from all accounts. I wish I'd known him better. When did you meet him?"</p>

  <p>"Long before you were born. I was in Rumania, working for an oil company.
  One morning I had to call at a Bucharest newspaper office on business, and
  while I was talking to the editor a big man came striding into the room in a
  tremendous temper about something or other. That was your father."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right. A big man. And a temper, too. I remember that
  much."</p>

  <p>"Well, he talked in bad German first of all, but when he heard me talking
  English he poured out his troubles to me. It was something about a piece of
  music criticism that had appeared in the paper about one of his concerts.
  Some word which he thought was insulting. He was in a fine rage about it, and
  the editor didn't know what to do except to send for the man who had written
  the criticism, and as soon as this fellow appeared your father turned on
  <i>him</i>. He had a temper, too. and before I properly realized what was
  happening they were exchanging cards and fixing a duel&mdash;all the silly
  palaver, you know. And for a quarter of an hour I did my best&mdash;but in
  vain&mdash;to prevent your father from being a damn' fool."</p>

  <p>David began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"Because duels were strictly against the local law, and if by chance
  anyone got killed there would be the devil to pay. I didn't like to see an
  Englishman getting into such a mess."</p>

  <p>"He isn't an Englishman. He's an Irishman&mdash;at least his father
  was&mdash;his mother was Russian. And he was born in Shanghai."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a magnificent mixture. Anyhow, he fought that duel."</p>

  <p>"What with?"</p>

  <p>"The usual sort of sword or rapier or whatever they call it. And it was
  pretty clear to me that your father had never handled the weapon before and
  that his opponent was an expert. Yet&mdash;by some almighty fluke&mdash;your
  father won. Full of impetuousness, he dashed in with a few terrific lunges,
  one of which pinked the other fellow in the arm. Honor having been thus
  satisfied, your father shook hands with everybody and went off full of smiles
  and good will.</p>

  <p>And that's the last I ever saw of him."</p>

  <p>"It's all very funny."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;quite a piquant situation, me telling you something about your
  father that you'd no idea of. And more than that, I can tell you something
  that even he&mdash;to this day&mdash;may have no idea of himself. It's a sort
  of ironic postscript to the whole incident. The editor and I were friends and
  afterward we came to the conclusion that your father must have been entirely
  mistaken about the insult he complained of. It was really a complimentary
  adjective that was just different by a letter or so from the other word he
  must have imagined it to be. Like <i>poison</i> and <i>poisson</i> in French,
  you know. <i>That's</i> funny too, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty damn' crazy when you come to think about it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a crazy world."</p>

  <p>They talked on and went to bed rather late.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN THE morning David was up at daybreak and went down to the
  beach to overhaul and test his machine. There was only slight damage, which
  he was soon able to repair. When all was ready he returned to the bungalow
  for coffee; then Carson saw him off. The two men stood for a few moments by
  the ticking engine; they did not say much, except to exchange good
  wishes.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll be in time&mdash;take care of yourself&mdash;look me up if
  you're ever this way again&mdash;goodby!"</p>

  <p>"Goodby," shouted David, against the roar of the engine as the plane began
  to move. It ran a little way along the beach, lifted, soared above the sand
  and shingle, and then set a course.</p>

  <p>A brilliant morning, cloudless, and cool over the sea. David flew at a
  thousand feet, keeping the land well in sight, though he would cut corners
  across the bays and inlets. With the new eye of the new race of flying men he
  memorized the look of the country as he passed over it&mdash;a cape here that
  the seafarer never approaches, a river there whose width the landsman can
  never visualize. There was something Elizabethan in the way he thought of the
  world&mdash;as a place of virgin spaces and untried dangers, where a youth
  was already a man, and where a man might find death or fame by equal hazard.
  That was the dream; the business was to make it pay. And whether the dream or
  the business predominated in him at any given moment was largely a matter of
  mood.</p>

  <p>He came down at Rangoon in the morning, filled up his tanks, and snatched
  a light meal. As the weather looked promising he decided to aim direct for
  Calcutta, flying across the Bay of Bengal. Within a few moments of setting
  off he was out of sight of all land, for there was a touch of mist in the
  air. He then settled himself, as he was fairly well used to doing, to a spell
  of purely automatic flying, keeping his eye on his instruments while his mind
  wandered at will among his private preoccupations.</p>

  <p>These were mostly financial. He was really on the edge of personal penury,
  and had been for months, but it did not seem to matter except as a mere
  fidget for odd moments.</p>

  <p>He didn't really worry about money, but he passionately wanted the extra
  freedom that money would confer; and when, on land, he met the kind of people
  he must beg favors from, he suffered a cold rancor that left him, in
  sympathies, estranged from the world of streets and cities. He didn't care
  two hoots about kings and princes and Fascism and Communism and disarmament
  and all the other issues that the newspapers talked about, and his
  patriotism, so far as he had any, was centered upon Australia rather than
  upon the British Empire, and even upon Queensland rather than upon
  Australia.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE TOOK an airman's view of life in general, and noted with
  unconcern the landsman's growing fear of bombs; there even passed across his
  mind occasionally a strange daydream of a world that bombs had made safe for
  lordly boys to fly over.</p>

  <p>Cruising steadily now at an even height above the sea, all the shabbiness
  of earth contacts vanished, and he was left, in mind and body, remote. This
  remoteness gave him a sensation of physical well-being, of gladness to be
  alive, even of gladness to be afraid. For he was, always, a little afraid
  when he crossed a stretch of open sea.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, amidst his musings, a lift of wind swung the machine out of its
  even progress, and his nerves tightened automatically in response. The
  horizon ahead was still bright, though rather mistier, and up to now he had
  been flying well with a steady following wind. That was what puzzled him, for
  the gust had come head on.</p>

  <p>Winds were incalculable things; someday, perhaps, they would be charted
  like sea currents; till then, every flyer was an explorer feeling his way.
  But with such experience in exploration came a sixth sense of warning, a
  lightning response to unfamiliar behavior; and this gust had evoked such a
  response.</p>

  <p>Then, almost as quickly as if a curtain had been drawn across the sea, the
  mist darkened into a cloud and the cloud rolled and swelled over the sky with
  a spreading core of black. He felt cold fear creeping on him. He had flown
  through storms before and had always had fear. On land he could avoid them by
  detours or emergency landings, but there was no hope of avoiding this one,
  because it guarded the whole landward arc of the horizon; to turn tail would
  have been to face the open ocean. No option, therefore. And all that
  complicated mass of human machinery&mdash;brain, nerve, muscle,
  spirit&mdash;braced itself for the ordeal; the boyish features became a man's
  in resolution, the frown deepened to face the frowning sky. David Clair, whom
  no one had heard of, who had no money, no position, no social importance, was
  facing a storm in the Indian Ocean&mdash;alone.</p>

  <p>He climbed higher, giving himself a safer distance from the sea, the
  surface of which was already green-dark and troubled. But at a couple of
  thousand feet the machine crashed into an almost solid wall of water that
  sent it reeling; in an instant he was drenched to the skin and water came
  pouring into the cockpit before he could close the side windows.
  Simultaneously the sky turned pitch-black. A shaft of panic transfixed him,
  but his nerve answered the call and drove it away; he switched on the light
  that illuminated the instrument panel, and lost height a little, hoping to
  emerge into rainless daylight.</p>

  <p>But the darkness persisted, great ramparts of water fell against the
  machine, straining every strut and buffeting the wings like fist-blows. David
  held firm, peering at his instruments, countering every gust with the
  appropriate operation of the controls, fighting with every atom of mind and
  will and body. Suddenly a great glare streaked the sky and the rain glittered
  ahead like a limitless Niagara. Instinctively he ducked and was momentarily
  blinded; for a few seconds he was sure the plane had been struck.</p>

  <p>"My God&hellip;" he muttered. "My God&hellip;" It was the conventional
  expression of terrified astonishment he had heard other people say, in plays
  and movies, and at such a moment it was easiest to be true to fiction. The
  darkness closed around him again, and all at once he knew, from a change in
  the note of the engine, that it was running less perfectly. He was done for.
  It came to him quite simply and naturally that within half an hour he would
  be dead.</p>

  <p>He was calm about it at first, and then abruptly and rather incongruously
  angry. He was angry, not against Fate or Luck, which he respected, but
  against the world that hadn't lent him money enough to buy the radio
  equipment that might save his life, against the multitude of smug and snug
  newspaper readers who, if the couple of lines about his death should catch
  their eye, would murmur "Poor fellow" to themselves, and never think of him
  again. Not that he wanted them to, and yet&mdash;there he was, sinking to his
  death, and nobody gave a damn.</p>

  <p>Well, why should they? he countered, self-contemptuously, and then, as he
  felt the machine sagging farther and farther and the engine sputtering
  against its rhythm, he had a sudden vision of his father, as Carson had
  described him, prancing about with foils in a park near Bucharest&hellip;
  Glad I know that story, he thought; you had pluck, father, anyway&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then the miracle happened; a gray light spread below, and through a gap in
  the grayness came the sight of mud and crops in soaked fields.</p>

  <p>He came down, waited for the rain to stop, tuned his engine, and flew on.
  All in a day's work. He reached Calcutta by dusk.</p>

  <p>It was toward its latter stages that David began to realize that his
  flight might not pass entirely unnoticed after all. He had been making good
  time, and at Karachi had given an interview to a journalist. Among various
  questions and answers had been the following:</p>

  <p>"What sort of weather have you been having during the trip?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not too bad on the whole."</p>

  <p>"Any exciting incidents?"</p>

  <p>"I ran into a storm over the sea between Rangoon and Calcutta, but I
  managed to get out of it again."</p>

  <p>"Just a storm&mdash;I see&hellip; Now, Mr. Clair, I wonder if you could
  tell me why you are doing this trip. Are you hoping to break any
  records?"</p>

  <p>"No, not particularly&mdash;at least, that's not the chief idea just now.
  You see, my father in England is ill and I was cabled for in Singapore. I'm
  just getting home as fast as I can, that's all."</p>

  <p>That was all, but that was enough. The flight, though not a record one,
  acquired what even record flights so often lack&mdash;the human touch; by the
  time David reached Bagdad it had become "Son's Air Dash to Dying Father"; at
  Athens the photographers and newspapermen were lined up at the airport; at
  Marseilles David discovered that he had become the hero of a "Grim Race with
  Death." He was desperately tired, and torn between a desire to make what he
  could out of the suddenly evoked sensation, and a secret disgust with the
  whole business.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN he arrived at Croydon Airport he was utterly exhausted
  and had to be lifted out of the cockpit. He didn't hear much that was told
  him; a few reporters did their best to make him say what they wanted him to
  say, photographers photographed him, and he couldn't get a drink because, in
  the curious manner of England, it was against the law at that particular
  hour. The airport authorities asked him if he wished to fly on to his
  father's home at Little Bigbury, Hants, but he said no, he was too tired; but
  the real reason was that he didn't know the way, and thought it would seem
  funny to say so. He knew the routes to Cairo and Bushire and Allahabad and
  Port Darwin, but from London to Little Bigbury was <i>terra
  incognita</i>.</p>

  <p>He rested for a few minutes while customs officers examined his plane for
  smuggled heroin or Pekingese; then, because he really wanted to evade
  publicity, he actually succeeded in doing so. Few heroes want it as much as
  that; but for David there was the simple devastating fact that his toothache
  had begun again. All the way to Bigbury in a hired car it got worse and
  worse, driving out of his mind all satisfactory thoughts of headlines and oil
  company bonuses, and putting in their place the somber conviction that the
  whole affair was somehow shabby and depressing and unworthy; just think, to
  have one's father's illness turned into a publicity stunt; far better to face
  a storm in the Indian Ocean than newsmen and bulb-exploders plus toothache.
  And his clothes were dirty, and he had only nine shillings in his pocket; he
  felt ill and miserable and his eyes were red-lidded and sore.</p>

  <p>The conquering hero! He had never been to Little Bigbury and didn't know
  how to find his father's house; he hadn't seen any of his family for seven
  years, and seven years is a long time to a youth who has flown from Singapore
  to London in six days, who has fought a three-hour battle with a typhoon, and
  stared into the face of death itself for a couple of minutes.</p>

  <p>He found the house and rang the doorbell. A girl answered it; at first she
  did not realize who he was. "I'm David," he began, in his Australian voice;
  then she exclaimed: "David&mdash;oh, David&mdash;we've read about you! I'm
  your sister Monica&mdash;I don't suppose you remember me!" He hardly did; she
  had been only a little girl. Now she gazed at him bewilderedly, for he was so
  tall and brown and strange-looking.</p>

  <p>In the hall he heard the sound of a piano upstairs, and presently, with
  Monica preceding him, he climbed to a door that opened upon a flood of music.
  A gray-haired, fine-looking man was playing. He did not see anyone at first,
  and went on playing. Then he saw David and stopped.</p>

  <p>"I'm David," said David.</p>

  <p>The old man swung around with eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>"So you're David, are you? Then perhaps you can tell me what's all this
  damned nonsense about you flying here because I'm supposed to be dying? D'you
  know I've been badgered and pestered by all sorts of people these last few
  days? Wanting to know if I'm dead yet! I'm not, thank Heaven. I had a chill,
  that was all, but your damn' fool sister got the wind up and cabled you. She
  shouldn't have done it, I told her so at the time&hellip; Still, don't think
  I'm not glad to see you. Of course I am. Sit down. What would you
  like&mdash;I mean, what do you do&mdash;drink, smoke&mdash;anything?"</p>

  <p>"There's just one thing," said David, struggling hard.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;what's that?"</p>

  <p>"I've&mdash;I'm afraid I've got the most awful toothache. Could you put me
  on to a good dentist round about here?"</p>

  <p>The old man stared hard, then swung round to the piano. "Monica, call up
  Borrows and make an appointment for him to see this young man immediately.
  Tell him he's come all the way from Singapore to Little Bigbury to see a
  dentist&hellip; And you lie down on that couch, my boy&mdash;I'll play you
  some Bach while you're waiting&hellip; Lord, this is a crazy world."</p>

  <p>"I know," said David, smiling.</p>
