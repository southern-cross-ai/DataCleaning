  <h3>First published in <i>The Manchester Guardian</i>, May 19, 1924<br>
  Reprinted in <i>The Living Age</i>, July 5, 1924,</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">WHEN Mr. Plender, aged fifty, became a clerk at Murdock's he
  told nobody that twenty-five years before he had actually written a novel.
  And yet this was, and always would be, the central fact in his life, though
  his pride in it was subtly compounded with shame at his subsequent decline in
  the world. It was not only that he had failed&mdash;the best people did that
  sometimes; it was that he, personally, was a failure. He knew it. At thirty
  he had been able to deny it; at forty there had been perhaps a shadow of
  doubt; but at fifty there could be no doubt at all. Luckily it was not hard
  to preserve an incognito at Murdock's. Nobody there had ever heard of <i>The
  Wind in the Rushes</i>; indeed, nobody at Murdock's seemed at all interested
  in books of any kind.</p>

  <p>At fifty-five Mr. Plender was still incognito, and still, moreover, a
  clerk with the same rank and salary. Many of the staff openly ridiculed him,
  and all, from the office-boy upward, treated him as of no account. He did not
  play golf; he never used slang; he had no obvious pastimes or enthusiasms; in
  short, he was an old fogy.</p>

  <p>And then one morning came young Snaith, the first new member of the staff
  since Plender himself. Snaith was a shy, bright-faced, eager-eyed, almost
  girlish-looking youngster in his early twenties, and at the end of his first
  day, as he passed Mr. Plender in the porch, he said, 'Good night, sir.'
  Possibly he mistook him for somebody important. But it was the first mark of
  respect that anybody had shown Mr. Plender for years, and even the likelihood
  that it had been due in part to a misapprehension could not take away all its
  power. Plender warmed to it. That night he dreamed dreams of a deep
  friendship springing up between himself and young Snaith, a friendship as of
  a father for a youngest son.</p>

  <p>The very next day fate seemed to play into his hands, for during the lunch
  interval he saw young Snaith studying a typed manuscript, and a casual
  inquiry elicited the rather shy answer, 'Oh, it's only a story I've written.
  I try&mdash;sometimes, you know&mdash;to get things in the papers.'</p>

  <p>'Really?' exclaimed Mr. Plender, his heart beating wildly within him. 'Do
  you? Now that's extremely interesting. I&mdash;I wonder if I could&mdash;help
  you&mdash;at all. I do&mdash;I have done&mdash;just a little in that line
  myself.' But he added warningly: 'I wouldn't tell any of the others if I were
  you. They'd only scoff.'</p>

  <p>He asked Snaith to tea in his rather dingy furnished rooms. In a
  conspicuous place on his bookshelves was his own private copy of <i>The Wind
  in the Rushes</i>. The boy&mdash;for he thought of him merely as a
  boy&mdash;had promised to bring along some of his work, and he intended to go
  over it with him, making suggestions and giving general literary advice. And
  then, as a final sensation, he would tell him his own strange
  secret&mdash;about the novel that was the one solitary achievement of his
  life. He waited for that moment as a starved man waits for a meal. Somebody
  would respect him at last; somebody would be interested in him&mdash;would
  not think him so ordinary and humdrum and insignificant.</p>

  <p>Snaith came, bringing his manuscript, and as soon as Mr. Plender began to
  look at it he perceived that it was very bad indeed. He was quite frank.
  'You've a long way to travel yet, my lad. This'&mdash;he patted the
  manuscript as benevolently as years before a hopeful publisher had patted
  his&mdash;'this shows undoubted promise, but more than that I should not care
  to affirm. To begin with, you must avoid the cliché. You should never write
  such phrases as "by dint of an almost superhuman effort" and "fell with a
  sickening thud." And, in general, I think there is far too much action in
  your work and not enough psychology. Of course, no doubt I am rather
  old-fashioned.' He paused, smiling, and reached down <i>The Wind in the
  Rushes.</i> 'Now here's a little thing of my own which I published&mdash;oh,
  quite a number of years ago. I will lend it to you, and perhaps when you read
  it you will see more clearly what I mean. Especially the chapter entitled
  "Nymphs and Fauns." Only please don't show or mention it to any of the office
  people. They have no interest in literature.' He added softly: 'You&mdash;and
  I&mdash;are in a different world.'</p>

  <p>A week later Snaith returned the book with a vague and slightly
  embarrassed 'Very nice. Awfully good of you to lend it me.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' murmured Mr. Plender. 'Oh, not at all. I hope it may have
  helped you in your own work. Had any luck yet?'</p>

  <p>'Not yet.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Plender smiled. 'Ah well, as I said, you have a long way to travel
  yet. Keep at it&mdash;keep at it. And come to me whenever you want any
  help.'</p>

  <p>But young Snaith did not come to Mr. Plender for help, nor did the
  friendship prosper as the latter had hoped. And one morning Mr. Plender
  arrived at the office to find Snaith surrounded by a crowd. He had had a
  story accepted by the <i>Purple Magazine</i>, and was telling everybody about
  it. And they, the Philistines, were shouting, 'Splendid!' and 'Congrats, old
  man!'</p>

  <p>'I am very pleased,' Mr. Plender forced himself to say. 'Though I am
  afraid I don't know the&mdash;er&mdash;the <i>Purple Magazine</i>.' But
  nobody took any notice of him; perhaps nobody even heard him.</p>

  <p>A fortnight later Murdock sent for him. 'Ah, Plender&mdash;I shall want
  you to manage Snaith's work for a short time, till we get somebody else.'</p>

  <p>'Why&mdash;is he leaving?'</p>

  <p>'<i>Leavin</i>? I should jolly well think he's <i>not</i>! I'm givin' him
  a chance as my private secretary. Enterprisin' young feller&mdash;deserves
  encouragement. Had a story in some magazine the other day&mdash;damned good,
  I thought it. Interestin' hobby, <i>and</i> profitable. Everybody ought to
  have some sort of a hobby. <i>You</i> ought to, Plender.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Plender to-day, at the age of sixty, can reflect that his unfavorable
  opinion of Snaith's literary capacities was quite correct. The story in the
  <i>Purple Magazine</i> was a mere fluke, and anyhow, as deputy-head of
  Murdock's, Snaith has not the time, even if he had the desire, for
  story-writing. When he sees Plender now he would not dream of calling him
  'Sir'; he just nods curtly and says,' Morning, Plender.' His own private
  opinion&mdash;also correct&mdash;is that Plender is a failure.</p>
