<h2><a name="ch-00" id="ch-00"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In the historical sketches here offered I have sought to govern
myself by restrictions no less rigid than those under which the
sketches collected in two earlier volumes of this series were
composed. Only the manner is that of fiction. The matter deals with
facts, in so far at least as it is possible to arrive at facts from
the surviving records of past transactions. Invention has been
avoided, and imagination has been employed only with the aim of
creating a sense of actuality and confined to details of those
circumstances of which the suggestion is implicit in the events
themselves. The only exception to this is the occasional employment
of imagination to penetrate those obscure corners into which the
surviving records fail to cast any light.</p>
<p>It has been said that history is the richest mine of romantic
situations, and that these, by the unexpectedness of their
development, commonly surpass all that may be conceived by the
talent of the most fertile romancer.</p>
<p>The student of history might accept this as true if he were not
commonly brought to suspect that it is precisely this talent of the
most fertile romancers that has so often been engaged in the
composition of the records upon which he depends.</p>
<p>The elements for the compilation of any history are to be sought
in the writings coming down to us from contemporary chroniclers of
events. But it is necessary to remember that chroniclers are
commonly biased. It is in fact the bias, the strong feelings
excited in these writers, the desire to present a case as they
prefer to see it, the virulence of faction, that urges them to
become chroniclers. The interpretation given to events in our own
time by an historian of, say, a couple of centuries hence, will
depend upon whether, when he comes to the mass of material left
him, he prefers to follow writers of the right or of the left.
Neither of these groups can be acquitted of falsifying events. The
members of each are concerned to present the side with which they
are in sympathy in the most favourable, and the opponent side in
the most odious, light. Propaganda today is accepted as a more or
less legitimate weapon of warfare between nations and between
political parties, and falsehood, deliberate and calculated, is
accounted by propagandists a moral poison gas of the same
expediency as the physical poison gas employed on the field of
battle.</p>
<p>This is no new thing. Isaac D'Israeli, commenting on it a
hundred years ago, wrote: 'When one nation is at war with another
there is no doubt that the two governments connive at, and often
encourage, the most atrocious libels on each other, to madden the
people to preserve their independence and contribute cheerfully to
the expenses of war.' And he traces the practice back into the
mists of antiquity. Elsewhere in the same essay (<i>Political
Forgeries and Fictions</i>), the whole of which may be read with
profit by the historical student, he charges political calumny with
converting forgeries and fictions into historical authorities.</p>
<p>As it is now, as it was in Isaac D'Israeli's day, so it has
always been; for in man's moral outlook no material change is
discernible in historic times. And just as nation deals with nation
in times of strife, so party deals with party, and individual with
individual. It is no easy matter, therefore, to reach the absolute
truth of any past event, upon which the evidence is commonly
conflicting.</p>
<p>If we are so fortunate A to be able, as a preliminary, to
establish the credibility of our witnesses, then the task is
comparatively simple. But instances in which this is possible are
the exception rather than the rule. Consequently the historical
writer in his process of sifting is largely dependent upon&mdash;we
might almost say, the victim of&mdash;his own instincts,
predilections, and prejudices.</p>
<p>The history of King Henry VIII of England, touched upon here in
'The King's Conscience,' is very much a case in point. It will be
seen that I adopt the view of Sir Walter Ralegh, by no means a
negligible authority and one who is certainly not to be suspected
of propagandism in his criticisms of that monarch. The fact
remains, however, that so varied are the judgments advanced on the
character of Henry VIII and on the events of his life and reign,
that a modern writer will not lack for authorities to support any
point of view which he happens to prefer. Arguments have been put
forward to account on the loftiest grounds for his matrimonial
adventures, arguments which by their ingenuity and more or less
solid foundation upon contemporary evidences could not fail to
carry conviction if they did not first outrage common sense.</p>
<p>'The Tragedy of Madame' is another instance in which the
conflict of evidence brings the student to despair. Those
acquainted with Saint-Simon's encyclopaedic <i>Mémoirs</i> and
Madame de La Fayette's <i>History of Henriette d'Angleterre</i>
will perceive the main sources from which I have drawn. These two
furnish us, one with the cause and the other with the effect; and
since cause and effect, being as they are the two sides of a fact,
are necessary for the proper presentation of any narrative, whether
of fact or of fiction, it is only by the welding of the two that we
obtain a plausible view of this case. On the poisoning, Madame de
La Fayette is non-committal. She reports Henrietta's own suspicions
and the rumours that were current. Her real contribution is her
account of the events which by exacerbating the relations between
Henrietta and her husband supply a possible motive for the crime.
Saint-Simon it is who, in very positive terms, denounces the
poisoning. He is notoriously a scandalmonger, and he was a child at
the time of the affair. But he gives as his authority Purnon, the
<i>maitre d'hôtel</i> of Monsieur, from whom he tells us that he
had the tale. No living man could be of greater authority than
Purnon in this matter, and it is difficult to suppose that he
should have lied, considering the extent to which his narrative
incriminates himself.</p>
<p>Against this we have the evidence of the medical men&mdash;some
English, brought in by the British Ambassador, and some
French&mdash;who made the post-mortem, discovered no poison, and
declared that Madame had died of cholera morbus; and we know that
their finding satisfied Charles II, to whom it was reported. This,
however, is to be discounted by the fact that little reliance can
be placed on the findings of seventeenth-century physicians. Their
denial of the presence of poison was based upon no chemical tests,
but simply upon the appearance of the organs. It should be
remembered also that only evidences of poisoning so overwhelming as
not to leave in doubt their limited powers of detection could have
silenced a judgment dictated by the most urgent political
expediency.</p>
<p>In 'The Victor of Vendémiaire' I present, purely as an instance
of the lengths to which political falsehood will go, a story that
we know to be so untrue that its inclusion in this collection would
be inadmissible if it were not lifted entirely from one of those
sources from which history is supplied. Beyond sketching in the
background and such details as I account necessary so as to lend
life and movement to the tale, I merely repeat it as it comes to us
in the <i>Mémoirs</i> of Barras, who was himself a leading actor in
the little comedy.</p>
<p>We know that this was not at all the manner of Bonaparte's first
meeting with Josephine de Beauharnais. That meeting was anterior to
the events of Vendémiaire, and had taken place at the house of
Madame Tallien, to which Barras had introduced him. We also have
every reason to believe that the command of the Army of Italy
bestowed on Bonaparte was&mdash;although Bonaparte must have been
far from suspecting it&mdash;the dowry of a mistress of whom Barras
had wearied. The fact is that this vain, corrupt, and dishonest
member of the government, recognizing the force and genius of the
young Corsican, promoted him so that he might afterwards lean upon
and use him. Bonaparte's refusal to be so used, his thrusting aside
of the worthless ladder by which he had climbed, engendered in
Barras a rancour which expressed itself in calumnies of which this
is a conspicuous example. The tale of La Montansier is only a part
of the false account Barras gives of the events of Vendémiaire. In
the rest of it he is concerned to glorify himself and to diminish
Bonaparte's share in the suppression of the revolt, representing
him as no better than an aide-de-camp. But in the matter of La
Montansier, he desires to show him contemptibly venal, and, in the
conclusion of it, as a ruthless, egotistical ingrate. It is a
cruel, heartless little comedy, of the kind of which many that are
not so easily refutable may have found an abiding place in
history.</p>
<p>The spirit of comedy presides also, but less bitterly, over the
episode I have selected from the lively career of Catherine of
Russia. My choice of the Poniatowski affair is dictated by the fact
that nothing in the resourceful career of the Empress shows her as
more fully deserving the title of 'Madame La Ressource,' and also
because the episode does not seem to me ever to have been given in
her biographies the prominence which it deserves as a revelation of
character.</p>
<p>In 'The Vagabond Queen,' I have ventured a tentative elucidation
of the queer mystery surrounding the murder of Monaldeschi by that
tragicomic figure, Christine of Sweden. In this account imagination
has been permitted to transcend the limits elsewhere imposed upon
it.</p>
<p>You are, of course, entitled to reject as pure invention the
motive here advanced. I can only plead that a close study of all
the circumstances strongly suggests it to have been something of
this kind, and, so far as I am aware, no other attempt to discover
a motive has ever been published. Apart from that the narrative
keeps close to fact, and the circumstances of Monaldeschi's brutal
end are as I present them.</p>
<p>The remaining sketches follow lines that are more or less
accepted, each, however, presented from the angle that brings
sharply into view factors which may not have been regarded as
possessing the cardinal importance which I attribute to them in
directing the course of the events. The greatest liberty I permit
myself in this respect is in 'The Secret Adversary.' In this
account of the rise and fall of Struensee I advance the theory that
the directing mind was that of the crafty Queen Juliana, and I
discern in Struensee himself no more than an accidental
interruption of her schemes, an interruption which her astuteness
ultimately turned to good account.</p>
<p>R. S.<br>
CLIFFORD, December, 1937</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>THE KING'S CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>From his aspect you would never have suspected the refinements
of mind and the tender susceptibilities of conscience that were
his. A mountain of a man, with elephantine legs that were bowed
under the weight of his hogshead of a body, and a head that must
have seemed disproportionately small but for the black-bearded
pendulous cheeks that made it wider at the jaws than at the brow,
he looked an entirely and grossly carnal fellow. His actual
countenance must have been nothing short of terrible, since even
its lifeless reproductions in paint on canvas, that look down upon
you from the walls of Hampton Court today, must fill the sensitive
with a sense of dread and Loathing. Observe the fleshly and yet
beak-like nose, with the evil wrinkle at its base, flanked by
small, wide-set owlish eyes under high-arching brows. He looks
predatory, cruel, repellent. Observing him, if you agree with
Spenser, that</p>
<p>'...of the soul the body form doth take,<br>
For soul is form and doth the body make,'</p>
<p>you may arrive <i>per saltum</i> at a wrong conclusion. You had
jest remember that this superman, whom a pope magnified with the
title of Defender of the Faith, was not merely the physical but
also the spiritual head of a great state. It is true that Sir
Walter Ralegh has said of him that he pared no man in his anger and
no woman in his lust. But we have the word of King James II for it
that Sir Walter was too saucy in his criticism of princes. It is
also true that someone&mdash;though not in his own time&mdash;has
called him the English Tiberius, and others have compared
him&mdash;entirely to his own disadvantage&mdash;with Nero and
Caligula. Against this, however, we are to remember that someone
else has said of him that had his elder brother lived, this Henry
Tudor might well have become Pope&mdash;meaning that if he had been
disposed to it, his superlative mental gifts must irresistibly have
swept him to Saint Peter's throne.</p>
<p>Even as it was, and though confined by destiny to a merely
temporal sovereignty, his polemical talents were not stifled. We
know his delight in the writings of the Fathers of the Church and
particularly those of the great Thomas Aquinas, and we see the rich
fruit of these studies in his own memorable work, <i>A Treatise on
the Seven Sacraments Against the Heresiarch Martin Luther, by the
Illustrious Prince Henry VIII.</i> It was a fulmination that should
have shrivelled Martin Luther into ashes, and so it must have done
had Martin Luther possessed a proper sense of the awesomeness of
illustrious princes. But that irreverent iconoclast not only
neglected to be shrivelled; he actually went the length of
answering the unanswerable, and&mdash;from Germany, where the
esteem of Henry Tudor was much less than anything Henry Tudor could
have believed&mdash;he answered him in terms that comprised the use
of epithets that are not commonly applied to princes, such as
'liar,' 'fool,' 'blasphemer,' and 'ass.' It was very well for
Martin Luther that he was safe in Germany, or the history of
European civilisation might be other than it is today.</p>
<p>Nor was divinity Henry's only talent. He had, for instance, a
very pretty taste in music, and&mdash;and here we reach at last my
most immediate concern&mdash;a very pretty and quite insatiable
taste in women. He has been called, because of his many marriages,
the English Bluebeard. But that is to fail utterly to do justice to
his sensitive conscience and polemical mind.</p>
<p>That conscience of his,' in matters matrimonial, was shaken out
of its slumbers one pleasant summer morning in the fair garden of
Hever Castle, Sir Thomas Boleyn's Kentish residence. It was, as it
were, awakened by the touch of as sweet and sprightly a lady as any
to be found in England at that time.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, a grandson of the Earl of Ormond and married to the
daughter of the Duke of Norfolk, was not only a well-born,
well-connected gentleman, but an ambassador of skill who in that
capacity had served his sovereign with distinction. Reason enough
in this, perhaps, why the King should visit him; but not all the
reason, by any means. Sir Thomas had a daughter, Mary Boleyn, who
had captured the royal fancy and had yielded to the impetuous
ardour of that elephantine wooer, as became a loyal loving
subject.</p>
<p>There you have the true lodestone that had drawn him to Hever
Castle.</p>
<p>And now, round a corner of the massive boxwood hedge on which
brilliants of dew still sparkled in the morning sun, you behold him
suddenly face to face with his host's younger daughter, Mistress
Anne, lately home from France&mdash;a slim, tall, lively,
brown-haired creature, with sparkling mischievous eyes and the
reddest lips in all the world, just such a creature as by the laws
of the attraction of opposites could not fail to inflame material
so combustible as our Defender of the Faith.</p>
<p>He came to a halt with an oath of sheer amazement, his huge legs
wide-planted, his arms akimbo, and stood insolently to appraise
her. Was he not master of all? And she on her side stood also at
gaze, a little awed by the massive bulk of him, and dazzled by his
slashed and bejewelled gaudiness. His great voice rumbled.</p>
<p>'Come hither, child.'</p>
<p>It was a very proper form of fatherly address, for he was
nearing forty and looked more, whilst she was but one-and-twenty
and scarcely looked as much. But there was nothing fatherly in his
mind.</p>
<p>She came, and, leering, he kissed her&mdash;one of the minor
royal prerogatives this, where beauty is concerned. She laughed a
little nervously, whereupon he held her from him at arm's length,
and considered her again.</p>
<p>'Why hath Sir Thomas kept you hid&mdash;the fairest jewel, by my
faith, in all his casket?' he demanded.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, following at his royal master's heels, made shift to
answer. But the maid forestalled him.</p>
<p>'Not hid, sire, but displayed. Used like the jewel that your
grace conceives me for the adornment of a crown.'</p>
<p>'Anne!' cried her father in reproof. 'Forgive her, sire. She's
but a child, and this is the forwardness they use in France.' And
he explained her meaning. She had gone overseas eight years ago
with the Princess Mary when the latter went to wed King Louis, and
after Louis's death she had remained at the Court of France as a
lady in waiting to the Queen of King Francis. But for the war she
would have been there still.</p>
<p>'Then is she the first of the gains by which this cursed war
shall make us richer,' protested the burly monarch. 'Nor shall she
waste her loveliness amid your Kentish turnips, good Sir Thomas.
The Court is her proper setting.'</p>
<p>It was a command, and whatever may have been Sir Thomas's
misgivings, considering what already lay between the King and the
knight's elder daughter, whatever the feelings of that elder
daughter herself, obedience to Henry Tudor was not a matter over
which prudent men could hesitate. So within a little while Mistress
Anne Boleyn was brought to Greenwich to be a maid of honour to
Queen Catherine as she had been maid of honour of two queens
already. At Court her beauty, her accomplishments, and her
sprightliness, which her long sojourn in France had spiced with a
Gallic flavour, made her speedily the admired of all. Almost she
held a court within a court, and of all the gallants who flocked to
do her homage it would have been hard to say which was the most
assiduous. There was the gay Sir Henry Norris, Groom of the Stole,
and there was young Percy, the Earl of Northumberland's son, either
of whom might have carried off this prize, but for a broad hint
that the King had other views. Percy was discreet. Upon a word in
season from his father, to whom the King had spoken, he effaced
himself. Norris, a man of stouter fibre and more reckless humour,
was removed by military duties the honour of which was suddenly
thrust upon him.</p>
<p>Anne was nowise perturbed. Though these departed, others
remained; and she was fancy-free, esteeming still the courting
above the courtier.</p>
<p>To Wolsey the King pronounced her an angel of wit full worthy of
a crown. And the arrogant prelate's mouth twitched in a smile of
fullest understanding. If Queen Catherine grew uneasy at the royal
devotion to her maid of honour, that was no matter for distress to
the great Cardinal. He had no love for Catherine, who had openly
denounced him for the cruel death of Buckingham, and whose nephew
the Emperor had fooled him in the matter of the papacy, to which
this swollen, ambitious, accomplished son of an Ipswich butcher was
aspiring. So Wolsey looked on complacently, taking satisfaction in
this humbling of the Queen by the royal wooing, open and unabashed,
of the maid of honour. But for all the impetuous ardour that he
used, King Henry found success receding ever in a measure as he
advanced. The maid was too elusive. She laughed and jested all he
would. She delighted, as it seemed, in fencing with him, but
handling her weapons with a rare address saw to it that whilst he
winded himself in his endeavours to pursue, overtake her he never
should. It may be that her notions of virtue were narrower than her
sister Mary's. It may be that her ambitions were less restrained.
When his importunities grew such as to tax her beyond her powers of
resistance, she used her health as a last buckler, and falling
opportunely ill, withdrew from Court and went back to Hever Castle
and the Kentish turnips.</p>
<p>Thither he wrote to her: 'My mistress and friend, I and my heart
put ourselves in your hands, begging you to recommend us to your
favour, and not to let absence lessen your affection for us,' with
much more in the same strain, which he subscribed 'Your servant and
friend.'</p>
<p>And now it was that his sensitive conscience, so lately
awakened, began to stir with real vigour. He took stock of his
married life; he looked back upon the eighteen years of it, and he
was appalled to perceive at last the state of sin in which the
pursuit of a headstrong youthful passion had brought him so
complacently to live. Catherine of Aragon, his brother's widow, had
been a handsome noblewoman of six-and-twenty when Henry, himself a
lad of nineteen, had succeeded to the throne. Agreeable in her
person and the daughter of the most powerful sovereigns in Europe,
there had been every reason, personal and political, why he should
marry her; the degree of affinity in which he stood to her had been
overcome by a special bull of dispensation from the Pope. But now
he remembered that Archbishop Warham, at the time, had ventured to
denounce his marriage as unlawful, and in his married history he
came to see evidence of the justice of that denunciation. In the
first eight years of their marriage Queen Catherine had borne him
four sons and two daughters. Of the four sons, two had been
stillborn and two had expired within a few days of birth. Of the
daughters, the Princess Mary was the only one born alive and still
living. There had also been some miscarriages in between those
futile births. To be left after that succession of pregnancies
without a son, and with only a sickly girl to succeed him, was to
be mocked. What could he see in this&mdash;now that at last his
eyes were open&mdash;but a sign of Heaven's displeasure? For
guidance, he went back to his studies of divinity, and overwhelmed
by what he found in Leviticus, he sat down in a chastened,
conscience-stricken spirit to write a book that should prove his
marriage to be unlawful and incestuous.</p>
<p>He took counsel in the matter with his friend and mentor, the
powerful minister Wolsey. The great Cardinal, seeing here a chance
of superlatively avenging himself upon Queen Catherine, went to
work in his crafty way to do the pleasure of his prince. Peace with
France was now restored, and an alliance was concerted that should
be cemented by the marriage of Henry's daughter Mary with the
Dauphin. Wolsey whispered a word in the ear of the Bishop of
Tarbes, and as a result of it that churchman suddenly asked a
formidable question: Was the legitimacy of the Princess Mary beyond
every legal and canonical doubt, having regard to the marriage of
which she was the offspring?</p>
<p>Here was evidence for him that doubts of the canonical quality
of his marriage were stirring elsewhere than in his own troubled
conscience.</p>
<p>'This,' he cried, 'shows how blind we have been to a fact that
is apparent even to strangers!'</p>
<p>After that, of course, measures must be taken to right that
monstrous wrong. Wolsey was sent as ambassador to France upon
matters concerned with the new treaty, and whilst there,
considering now the divorce inevitable, he looked about him for a
new queen for his royal master. Secretly he fixed upon the Princess
Renée. But in the rest of the matter he practised secrecy not at
all. He openly announced his quest, and went so far as to give more
than a hint of the manner in which the alliance should presently be
consolidated.</p>
<p>That astute and penetrating mind had made here the mistake of
underweighing the part to be played by Anne. He returned from
France to find her back at Court with the title of Marchioness of
Pembroke, a powerful faction growing up about her, directed by her
uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and her father, who had by now been
created Earl of Wiltshire. It daunted the Cardinal, who had never
dreamed or intended that she should be more to the King than a
mistress, and it appalled him presently to hear from Henry's own
lips that he had settled that Mistress Anne should be Queen
Catherine's successor.</p>
<p>Wolsey perceived the mischief that in his absence had been
wrought, and he perceived no less the danger in which he now stood,
as a result of the freedom with which he had talked in France. When
that should become known, he must have a more dangerous enemy in
Anne Boleyn than ever in Queen Catherine. Like a gambler who,
seeing half his fortune gone, risks the remaining half in the hope
of recovering it, he flung himself upon his knees before the King,
and pleaded with him at long and earnest and eloquent length
against an alliance so unworthy of his high estate. Skilfully he
played upon Henry's monstrous vanity, by means of which he had
known hitherto how to lead him as he pleased. But for once he
failed. Though vanity was strong in Henry, here was something that
was stronger still. What Henry desired, Henry must have, at
whatever cost; and since Anne was not to be had on any terms but
marriage, marry her he would. There was no more to be said.</p>
<p>Wolsey lumbered up from his knees, received his orders to
co-operate towards the desired end, and withdrew a sadly shaken
man.</p>
<p>Henry's view was simple and direct. What Pope Julius had done,
Pope Clement must undo, revoking the dispensation which should
never have been granted. That was his demand. But the Pope was
hardly master of his soul just then. The legions of the Emperor
were in Italy, and the Emperor was Queen Catherine's nephew. Having
no mind to see his aunt wronged and slighted, Charles V put his
sword to Pope Clement's throat, commanding the Pontiff to remain
insensible to the urgent bellowings of that English bull.</p>
<p>The utmost, therefore, that His Holiness would do was to order a
commission to inquire into the validity of the dispensation granted
by Julius, and to revoke it if it were found to have been by any
means surreptitiously obtained. And so in October of 1528 there
arrived in London for that purpose an aged, able ecclesiastic named
Campeggio. The impatient Henry courted him, and overwhelmed him
with gifts, but made no apparent impression and could gain no hint
of the judgment which the impenetrable Campeggio was likely to
pronounce. Followed delays that must have rent the soul of a
conscientious prince eager to purge him of his sin. But at last in
the following June, in the Parliament Chamber at Blackfriars, the
matter was brought to trial, and it ended in a declaration by the
King's Counsellors that the marriage was proven unlawful, the
dispensation having been obtained by false pretences and a
concealment of facts. Campeggio was summoned to deliver judgment.
But Campeggio on the Pope's behalf had played for time, and time
had served him well. The summons came too late. A peace had been
signed between the Pope and the Emperor. The commission was
revoked, and Campeggio was recalled. He departed, leaving matters
where they had been. From Rome, it was plain that Henry could look
for no help in this matter of clearing his overburdened
conscience.</p>
<p>His fury, directed by the Boleyn faction, vented itself upon
Wolsey, and Wolsey tumbled headlong from the great heights of power
to which he had climbed. His head, too, would have
fallen&mdash;since Henry never did these things by halves&mdash;had
not his broken health forestalled the axe.</p>
<p>This, however gratifying in itself, was no help towards the
divorce. Time moved on, leaving Henry groaning under a load of
scruples which none could lighten for him, and furiously sighing
his longings for the delectable Anne, whose motto might well have
been, <i>Aut Regina, Aut Nihil</i>.</p>
<p>At last the clergyman Cranmer came to his rescue with the
suggestion that the learned bodies of Europe should be asked the
question: 'Is it lawful for a man to marry his own brother's
widow?' If&mdash;as Cranmer opined&mdash;the answer were in the
negative, the Pope would be compelled to pronounce a sentence in
accordance with it. Henry clutched eagerly at this plank of
salvation. The universities of Europe were canvassed and gold was
spent to inspire their voices. But the body of pronounced opinion
nowise justified Cranmer's sanguine hopes, and matters got no
further.</p>
<p>And then at last arose that bold genius Thomas Cromwell, whose
shrewd wits had been sharpened in the service of the great Wolsey,
to point out a very clear and simple course. Let the King,
following the example of the Princes of Germany, throw off the yoke
of Rome, and declare himself head of the Church in his own
dominions.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous step, leading no man knew whither. But it
was not Henry's way to hesitate or count the cost when it was a
question of obtaining what he wanted. As Herbert has said of him,
'His character was never to look farther than the present object.'
To obtain his Anne he was ready to plunge the country in war and
sacrifice a thousand precious lives. That was an immediate
consequence, to the probabilities of which he was not blind by any
means.</p>
<p>Boldly, with this sword of Cromwell's forging, Henry slashed
through the Gordian knot. And since thus the way was made clear,
and the matter of his marriage depending upon no will but his own,
he was secretly married at last to Anne at Greenwich in January of
1533. Of that marriage Elizabeth was born in the following
September. But by then the secret had been fully disclosed. For in
a court held at Lambeth during May, Cranmer, now Archbishop of
Canterbury, declared the King's marriage with Catherine of Aragon
to be null and void from the beginning, and, therefore, that the
marriage contracted in January with Anne was legal, good, and
valid.</p>
<p>Thus, at last, after five years of passionate striving, moving
heaven and earth, threatening the peace of kingdoms and rending the
ancient bonds of the Church that he might possess himself of Anne,
the royal conscience found peace in the fair haven of those slim
young arms. The ardour of the chase at first, and then for a season
the intoxication of possession, had blinded him, perhaps, to
certain factors which, growing later apparent, could not be
reconciled with his tender conscience.</p>
<p>The Queen reclined on a day-bed in the embrasure of a window of
Greenwich Palace, overlooking a river that was touched to silver by
the pale sunshine of early spring. Beside her sat her royal
husband, vast and gaudy, the evil wrinkle at the base of his nose
deeper than usual, lending his great countenance a look of
moodiness and discontent. But the Queen's eyes sparkled, and her
lips smiled. She was happy, and with reason. There had been dark
moments in the romance of her young life. There had been a time,
not so long since, when she had feared that the fires of the King's
passion were burning low, when he had seemed less the 'loyal and
assured servant' he had subscribed himself in the romantic letters
he had written as a lover, than the master who took no pleasure in
his slave. But those days were overpast. Of late he had given
abundant proof of the sincerity and depth of his affection in the
long hours he came to spend here in her bower, sitting beside her,
putting off his royal dignity and becoming again the pleasant
affable fellow who had been ready to wreck half a world to win
her.</p>
<p>Something sang joyously within her breast today. Soon now she
was to be a mother for the second time, and the conviction grew in
her that she would bear him at last the boy for which he longed,
and thus rivet his affections irrevocably to herself. She put out
her long, white, tapering hand to take his own&mdash;a great
fleshly hand, with yellow crinkled skin and puffy fingers that were
heavily beringed, a hand that at a little distance looked like a
great jewelled toad. He let it lie, the wrinkle deepened in his
nose, his little eyes momentarily flickering away from the
half-dozen maids of honour in the background. Pressing that hand of
his, she smiled.</p>
<p>'It will be a boy, Hal,' she whispered fondly. 'How should it be
other? Have I not prayed that I may be so blessed? Could Heaven
deny my prayer and your desire? It will be a boy. I know it.'</p>
<p>The heavy face lighted with eagerness. He loosed her fingers
that he might pat her cheek.</p>
<p>'It were a treason in you to do less,' he growled
good-humouredly. He rose and stretched himself. 'See to it,
Anne.'</p>
<p>'Ah, do not leave me, Hal. Sit here awhile and&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Nay, nay, I must go,' he broke in. 'I have tarried here too
long, and Sir Thomas and my Lord Archbishop stay for me. But I'll
come soon again. Meanwhile, be thou careful, Anne.'</p>
<p>It was less the recommendation of a solicitous lover than the
stern injunction of a king and master. He stooped and brushed her
brow with his bearded lips, then rolled out of the chamber with a
step that made the windows rattle. But not even his brusqueness,
which after all was a normal part of him, could ruffle her glad
serenity that day. She lay back upon her cushions, sighed her
content, and smiled, pensively happy.</p>
<p>But to disturb her came odd sounds from the room beyond. A
patter and shuffle of feet, a tiny half-stifled squeal of laughter,
the crash of something falling&mdash;a chair, perhaps&mdash;and
then silence.</p>
<p>'God 'a' mercy, what is that?' The Queen sat up.</p>
<p>None answered her. Her maids of honour remained in frozen
attitudes, regarding her with oddly apprehensive faces. And
suddenly she observed that where there had been six there were now
but five.</p>
<p>'Why, where is Jane?' she inquired, intrigued. 'Who gave her
leave?'</p>
<p>Receiving no answer beyond that curious perturbed stare from
those five pairs of eyes in the scared faces of her women, the
heart in her bosom that had been so warm and glad a moment since
turned suddenly to ice. That which for weeks had been a matter of
open gossip to the entire Court broke upon her at last as a dread
suspicion. In an instant she was on her feet, white and breathless,
and then the maids moved forward fluttered by a plurality of
alarms.</p>
<p>'Your grace...!'</p>
<p>'Oh, madame, bethink you!'</p>
<p>'Sir William hath said you must not walk alone!'</p>
<p>'Because Sir William hath said it,' she broke in, her musical
voice now harsh, 'it is supposed that I am a prisoner here, and
so&mdash;Out of my way.'</p>
<p>She swept on, staggering a little. They would have stayed her,
and her favourite, Madge, who was betrothed to Sir Henry Norris,
went so far as to set hands upon her. She flung her off, and
considering at once her rank and her condition none dared to exert
force against her. They hung dismayed about her, pleading still
whilst she swept onward, and pulled wide the door.</p>
<p>A moment stood she staring there. Then with a faint catch in her
breath she reeled forward, and pulling the door after her, to shut
out her maids, she leaned against it faint with shame and anger to
consider closer that which had shattered her gladsome dream.</p>
<p>Fond fool, she had beguiled herself with the assurance that the
King's frequent and protracted visits were proofs of his reviving
devotion to her. Here was their true object now revealed. Here sat
the King, and on his massive knee, held fast by the great arm
encircling her, the pretty, lively maid of honour, Jane.</p>
<p>'Ah, rogue,' she heard him say, 'would you elude your king?
Would you dare be less than a loyal, loving subject?'</p>
<p>And then Jane, perceiving the Queen, had screamed and writhed in
the arm that held her yet a moment, until he too became conscious
of this witness. They broke apart on that, and Jane fled away
towards the window, weeping. His grace scowled, heaved himself up,
and balanced himself on wide-planted feet.</p>
<p>'What make you here?' he bellowed furiously. 'By what right do
you walk at such a time, when you've been told&mdash;'</p>
<p>'And what make you here?' she interrupted him in fury.</p>
<p>'What make you here, whilst Sir Thomas and my Lord Archbishop
stay for you? Shall I tell you what you make, you and
that&mdash;'</p>
<p>She broke off in terror of him. He was rolling towards her, and
the evil in his face robbed her of that royal courage begotten of
her anger. She screamed and choked. She beat the air with her hands
a moment, fighting for breath, then reeled forward swooning. He
caught her as she fell, and so eased her to the ground. Then he
flung wide the door of her bower, and trumpeting like an elephant
gave his orders to the terrified maids of honour.</p>
<p>That done, and finding in all this a matter that nowise helped
his royal dignity, he rolled out still bellowing and cursing.</p>
<p>And so the event to which she had looked for so much joy fell
out prematurely and in sore affliction. Her heart had told her the
truth. The child of which she was next day delivered was a boy. But
it was dead.</p>
<p>She lay there on her bed of anguish in the darkened room through
which pitiful attendants moved on tiptoe, and saw in this calamity
a sign of Heaven's wrath, a punishment on him and her: on him for
his infidelity and deceit, on her for what was past and done. Just
as she, a maid of honour, had ousted a queen, so was she, a queen,
being ousted by a maid of honour.</p>
<p>He came to her when he learnt the dread news, came with
blundering heavy step, taking no thought for her condition, and
bade them harshly unmask the windows so as to give him light. Grim,
scowling, and of a yellow pallor he stood beside her bed.</p>
<p>By his lights there was reason for his fury. Was he still being
mocked, and was even a change of wives to make no difference? Was
every son he could beget still to be brought lifeless forth? In the
case of Queen Catherine he had come to perceive the reason in the
incestuous quality of the union. It did not occur to him&mdash;or
if it did, he gave no sign of it&mdash;that the present union with
the sister of a sometime mistress might be in the same case. Still
less did it occur to him that the trouble might spring from the
same source as the intermittently troublesome sinus in his leg.
Syphilis, so lately imported from the New World, was flaming over
Europe, and to the King's infection may be attributed these
successive puerperal misadventures. In the existing state of
medical science there was no one to enlighten him, assuming that if
there had been any would have dared to suggest that the blame for
the present mischance lay anywhere but in the Queen's disregard of
her first duty.</p>
<p>'O 'sdeath!' he bellowed. 'Do you see what you have done? Do you
see how you have cheated me? To rob me of my boy! To lose me the
son I have so desired!'</p>
<p>Stung by his monstrous cruelty, the love he had known how to
kindle in her, almost in defiance of the laws of nature, was
reduced to ashes. She looked up out of her piteous white face, a
feverish glitter in the lovely eyes, and stabbed him with her
mercilessly just answer:</p>
<p>'Do not dare to upbraid me for what is your own guilty
work&mdash;yours and that wretch Jane Seymour's. Between you, you
have murdered my son.'</p>
<p>He fell back raging, loathly, monstrous, but too deeply stricken
to make a coherent answer. If he did not kill her with his hands
there and then, it must have been because he knew that he did not
lack for murderers who would do his pleasure.</p>
<p>She made a good recovery, in body, and because her nature was
light and gay, because her love for him was dead as dust, she made
an equally good recovery in spirit. By early April she was again
about the Court, which no longer knew Jane Seymour, gracing masque
and dance as blithely as of old&mdash;or so at least it seemed.
That gaiety and almost wanton lightness, implanted in her by nature
and fostered by her rearing at the Court of France, had ever kept
her from donning with the garments of a queen the aloofness of that
lofty station. Some there were who knew her for arrogant and
overbearing; but these were they who by their loosely veiled
hostility provoked it. But she had ever treated as on equal terms
with those who had been her friends and equals when herself she had
been a maid of honour. It was her way, it had ever been, to use the
officers of the royal household familiarly, and great was her
friendship for Brereton and Weston, Mark Smeaton, the King's
musician, and that gay accomplished knight Sir Henry Norris, who
was now back at Court.</p>
<p>That Norris dared to love her is not to be denied. But that she
was ever more than his queen to him is not to be asserted. Of late
his affection may have been less hopeless.</p>
<p>Perhaps it had begun to soar upon pinions supplied by her own
relations with the King on the one hand, and the fact that Henry
was a prey just then to that dangerous ulcer in the leg which might
yet slay him. The fact that Norris was betrothed to one of Anne's
maids rendered it natural that he should be one of the courtiers
most assiduous in frequenting her receptions.</p>
<p>At a masque in the second week of that fateful April, he hovered
near her chair after she had pointedly neglected to command him to
dance with her. She was ill-at-ease and nervous, and gently desired
\him to remove himself. The reason was that Weston had hurriedly
whispered a warning that the King was watching. Conscious of no
evil in herself, and having nothing to conceal, it would never have
entered her mind to use circumspection. But to know that conduct
however innocent is being made to wear the garment of suspicion is
in itself disturbing. Anne had looked at the King when Norris drew
near her. Racked though Henry was by the pain of his ulcer, he
would not forgo attendance at these revels. She beheld him huddled
in his great chair under a cloth of state, one massive leg across a
stool, and his baleful eyes upon her. They were dead as the eyes of
a snake, and in them dwelt something of the evil paralysing
fascination that is alleged to be a quality of the reptile's eye.
She felt herself turn cold, and shivered. Then Norris came, nor
would he go again when she implied that he was not welcome.</p>
<p>'Your grace, in what have I offended?' he asked her, genuinely
aghast.</p>
<p>'I have been warned,' she answered him, 'that it is being said
you are too often in my presence.'</p>
<p>Tall, lithe, and handsome stood he there beside her. His eyes
flashed scorn; scorn rang in his laugh.</p>
<p>'When evil tongues will be at work, why they will be at work
whether they have aught to work upon or not. But this! Does not all
the world know that I am to marry Madge?'</p>
<p>'It is being asked, sir, why do you not go on with your
marriage. Will you give me the answer?'</p>
<p>He looked at her, his lips tight-pressed. Then his glance
strayed across to the sick King; very faintly he smiled.</p>
<p>'Why,' he answered, 'it is that I would wait awhile.'</p>
<p>He spoke on such a curious note that she searched his face, for
confirmation of the meaning she suspected.</p>
<p>'You look for dead men's shoes?'</p>
<p>'And if I did?'</p>
<p>'You mean that if aught but good should come to the King, you
would look to have me. That is what you would have me
understand?'</p>
<p>He paled under his tan. 'And if I did?' he asked again.</p>
<p>'It is madness,' she answered breathlessly. 'Don't you see that
I could undo you if I would?'</p>
<p>'I am not blind, your grace. I see it clearly, and what you do I
shall account your answer.'</p>
<p>It was a gambler's throw this daring lover made, setting thus
boldly his very head upon the board. She drew back a little, and in
that moment caught again the King's evil, lowering glance. Henry
was leaning forward, chin in palm, considering them. She shivered
again.</p>
<p>'Go, go!' she bade him. 'In Heaven's name!' And there was such a
sudden ring of terror in her voice that out of pity he obeyed
her.</p>
<p>The Imperial Ambassador Chapuys had been accounting it his duty
to his master to do what he could to avenge Queen Catherine. He had
resorted to slanders of the virtue of her supplanter which at
another time might have come to cost him dear. In the present
season, however, it was convenient to suppose them at least
deserving of investigation, and this by means of rack and cord.</p>
<p>It would be a week or two later, on the first of May, that Mark
Smeaton, a groom of the King's chamber and a skilled lute-player to
whom Anne&mdash;herself an accomplished musician&mdash;had shown
much favour, was subjected in the privacy of Thomas Cromwell's
house to the horrible torture of woolding. Under this the
confession was torn from the unfortunate young man that he had
received presents from the Queen. It was enough to make a
beginning.</p>
<p>The Queen on that same day was bearing the King company in the
gallery above the tilt-yard to witness the tournament that was the
Court's contribution to the May-Day revels.</p>
<p>Her brother Rochford and Sir Henry Norris were to ride a course,
and as Sir Henry in flashing armour, lance on thigh, spurred his
charger towards the royal gallery, the Queen leaned forward upon
the rail. Whether by accident or design the kerchief that she held
escaped her fingers. The King at the moment was scanning a letter
that had just been put into his hand. Sir Henry caught the
handkerchief, bore it to his lips&mdash;which was a very ordinary,
knightly devoir&mdash;and on the point of his lance returned it,
standing in his stirrups. She laughed as she recovered thus her
piece of cambric. And then the laugh perished on her lips. With a
resounding oath the King heaved himself to his feet, and with no
further word spoken stamped out of the gallery, followed by his
gentlemen.</p>
<p>Sir Henry was summoned to accompany the King to London. He went,
to discover that the object was to cajole from him a confession
that should incriminate the Queen. For his bold repudiation of the
suggestions he found himself under arrest and on his way to a
lodging in the Tower.</p>
<p>As for the Queen, having stared in terror after the
tempestuously departing King, she sank back to her seat. Thus she
remained amidst her scarcely less terrified maids, until an officer
of the household brought her the royal command to go with him,
informing her that a barge was waiting.</p>
<p>'A barge?' she cried. 'For what a barge? Whither am I to go,
then?'</p>
<p>'To lodgings in the Tower, may it please your grace.'</p>
<p>Her terror mounted. Some of her maids had fallen to weeping, and
all about her the tilt-yard hummed with excitement. For a moment it
seemed to her that she was living in some evil dream. Then she
recovered. This was but done by the King to try her. He could not
mean her harm, who herself was harmless. Obediently she went,
summoning patience and fortitude to help bear this trial that the
King imposed upon her.</p>
<p>But even as she mounted the barge she heard that her brother,
Viscount Rochford, had been arrested for treason at the barriers.
Her fears welled up again to whelm her last illusion. Soon she was
to learn of Smeaton's fate and of the arrest of Weston, Brereton,
and Sir Thomas Wyatt, all friends of hers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, journeying thus in state by river to the Tower, she
may have thought of that other progress she had taken thither but
three years ago in this same month of May, when she had gone to be
crowned. Perhaps she thought of Queen Catherine, who had died last
January, and whose death had seemed to make her at last&mdash;as
she, herself, had said&mdash;a queen indeed.</p>
<p>And meanwhile those ambitious men who looked to advance
themselves by procuring for the King in defiance of justice and of
pity whatsoever he desired, were already at work. Thomas Cromwell,
who had cut the earlier baffling matrimonial knot, applied himself
with an equal zeal and greater infamy to the severing of this one.
Norris, Smeaton, Weston, and Brereton were put upon their trial for
the alleged offence against the life and honour of their sovereign
lord, entailed in being, as they were alleged to be, the lovers of
the Queen. In default of evidence against them they must be brought
to provide that evidence themselves. They were invited to confess,
and to quicken them they were tortured, but all without avail. And
then to each of those racked and broken men a document was brought
incriminating the Queen and himself, and he was offered his pardon
if he would sign it. Three refused with scorn to earn their lives
by so foul a perjury. But the fourth, the musician Smeaton, tempted
by the lure of life, his body tortured already to the full sum of
its endurance, signed. It availed him nothing, as he might have
known. He served their turn; but in serving it, he closed against
himself the door of life to which they had falsely promised him
that his signature should prove the key. He perished with the
rest.</p>
<p>Norris, whom the King esteemed, they tempted insistently with
the like offer.</p>
<p>'In my conscience,' he answered firmly, 'I believe her grace
entirely guiltless. For my own part, in any case, I can accuse her
of nothing, and I would sooner die a thousand deaths than
calumniate an innocent woman.'</p>
<p>'And is it so?' said Henry, when they brought him word of that
firm answer. 'Hang him up, then! Hang him up!'</p>
<p>Accounting that the sacrifice of those lives was not yet enough
to justify the King in the eyes of his conscience for the course
upon which he was set, her own brother, too, must be included in
that gallery of lovers.</p>
<p>And so on the tenth of May at last came the great trial of
Viscount Rochford and the Queen his sister on a charge of incest,
overwhelmingly established to the satisfaction of the accusers by
the fact that this brother had once remained for a long time alone
with his sister in her room.</p>
<p>Brave and self-possessed, the Queen stood to answer in person
the dread indictment, and by her spirited defence so utterly routed
the forces arrayed against her with their trumpery charge that the
rumour ran through the city that she had saved herself. They should
have known better, those citizens of London; they should have known
that among those five-and-twenty peers who sat to try her was none
who dared run counter to the wishes of his king.</p>
<p>Judgment was given against her brother and herself. Her sentence
was that she should be burnt or beheaded at the King's pleasure.
She had no emperor for her nephew, and they might do with her as
they listed without fear of provoking war with any foreign
power.</p>
<p>Maintaining still her fortitude, she lifted up her hands to
heaven and cried, in the presence of them all: 'O Father! O
Creator! Thou Who art the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Thou
knowest that I have not deserved this fate.'</p>
<p>Henry signed her death-warrant that very day, and sent the
supple Cranmer to confess her. The King was in haste to wed Jane
Seymour, and that fine conscience of his required that the obstacle
to that sacrament should be removed as speedily as possible. It
required even more, and Cranmer was charged with the business.</p>
<p>He found the Queen composed, and at her devotions.</p>
<p>'Madame,' he told her, 'I come as a messenger of hope.' And as
she swayed before him, he unfolded the matter. 'The adultery for
which you stand convicted were no adultery could it be shown that
there had been no marriage.'</p>
<p>Wide-eyed she stared, her cheeks white, her bosom
fluttering.</p>
<p>'No marriage? How, my lord?'</p>
<p>'His grace would deal mercifully, so that you make it possible.'
He explained himself more fully. She grasped at that plank of
salvation with both hands. If she had earlier boasted that no power
on earth could prevent her from dying a queen, eagerly she seized
this chance to live a commoner.</p>
<p>When Cranmer departed, her ladies found a flush on her cheeks, a
sparkle in her eyes. She was not to die, she told them. She had
consented to do that which should save her life, and she should be
sent instead to Antwerp. On the next day to purchase the royal
mercy by unwiving and dethroning herself she was privately conveyed
from the Tower to Lambeth Palace. There she submitted voluntarily
to a judgment that her marriage with the King had been no marriage,
and was therefore null and void from the first. It was Cranmer,
himself, who had examined the marriage and pronounced it valid, who
pronounced it invalid now. Thus was King Henry served, for had he
not said in public that if any spoke of him or his actions in terms
which became them not, he would have them know that he was master,
and there was no head so fine but he would have it off? Thus, then,
it followed logically that the adultery of which she had been
convicted was no adultery, since there can be no adultery where
there has been no marriage. At the price of this dishonouring of
herself and of her child she purchased life; and life the King
might have accorded but for the sensitiveness of that conscience of
his.</p>
<p>He must ask himself: What if after all the present judgment
should be mistaken? Being delivered, it answered his purposes well
enough. But what if, in spite of it, his marriage with Anne should
be canonically good? Could he run the risk of committing bigamy?
Clearly he could not.</p>
<p>Sentence had been passed upon her on the thirteenth of May; on
the fourteenth had followed her renunciation; and now on the
fifteenth, whilst she sat awaiting the order of release which she
had purchased at so bitter a price, word was brought her by the
Lieutenant of the Tower that she was to die on the nineteenth. She
owed that delay of four days entirely to the clemency of the King,
who because of what she had been to him could not bring himself to
deal with her one jot more harshly than the circumstances
inevitably demanded. For four days would he curb his impatience to
marry Jane, so that he might show Anne the utmost mercy. As a
further mark of his clemency he had ordained that she should not be
burnt but beheaded, and to minimise her suffering, this
tender-hearted monarch had sent to Calais for an executioner who
was singularly skilled. Hence the delay.</p>
<p>The news almost stunned her. But she made a quick and gallant
recovery. She smiled wistfully upon her dismayed and weeping ladies
and upon the white-faced Lieutenant who stood there regarding her
with such piteous eyes. The ready wit which the King had so admired
expressed itself in wistful sarcasm now.</p>
<p>'Convey to his grace,' said she, 'my acknowledgement of the
obligations which I owe him for thus uniformly continuing his
endeavours for my advancement. From a private gentlewoman, he first
made me a marchioness, and then a queen; and now, since he can
raise me no higher in this world, he sends me to be a saint in
heaven. Tell him that.' She caressed her neck and smiled. 'The
executioner, I hear, is very expert, and my neck is very slender.
It should be quickly done.'</p>
<p>She never faltered from her gallant gentle courage which
sustained her even on the scaffold. She refused to be blindfolded,
and there is a story that when that skilled practitioner from
Calais, wielding a two-handed sword, approached her to do his
office, he was momentarily palsied by the soft glance of those eyes
regarding him from the comely young head that was pillowed on the
block. Feeling himself unable to strike with those eyes upon him,
he went apart, beyond her range of vision, and putting off his
shoes, signed to one of his knaves to walk towards her heavily from
the other side. And then whilst her glance was so drawn off him, he
advanced softly on tiptoe, and shore away her head in a single
sweep of his great sword.</p>
<p>The poor lovely body was cast into an arrow-chest made of elm,
and so buried without honours within the precincts of the
Tower.</p>
<p>On the morrow Henry married Jane Seymour. He waded to those
nuptials through the blood of five gallant, innocent gentlemen and
one poor lady martyred to his lust. But at least his conscience was
at peace. There could be no doubt that he was free to marry.</p>
<p>I like to think of her as the saint in heaven that she said he
made her, and Henry in the part of Dives vainly pleading for a drop
of water. There are times when our sense of justice takes comfort
in the belief in a material hell.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>JANE THE QUEEN</h2>
<p>She never really took root on earth. The main concerns of her
brief life were concerns of the spirit, and of a spirit very nobly
endowed and very richly equipped. At the age of sixteen, when she
steps upon the stage of history, we are told that she wrote Greek
with fluency and was studying Hebrew, whilst of the perfection of
her Latinity we are afforded evidence by her letters to the Swiss
Reformer, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
<p>In learning, her spirit had discovered that limitless liberty of
movement denied the flesh, and such exalted joys that she could
look compassionately upon those to whom hunting, hawking, dancing,
and the like were necessary beguilements of the tedium of their
narrow lives.</p>
<p>'When I am in the presence of either father or mother, whether I
speak, keep silent, sit, stand, eat, drink, be sewing, dancing,
playing, or doing anything whatsoever, I must do it in such weight
and measure and number even so perfectly as God made the world,
else I am so sharply taunted as I will not name for the honour that
I bear them. But when I read, none interferes with me. I may read
as I choose and what I choose. Therefore that which is accounted
play is to me a toil, and that which others account a toil has
become my play.'</p>
<p>But whilst this learning enriched her mind, it supplied little
or none of the worldly wisdom which alone would have helped the
little Lady Jane Grey to read the signs before her. She had become
a centre of mysterious doings, which she perceived but could not
understand. Perhaps she made no real effort to that end. Perhaps
she was by nature submissive to the destiny which had assigned her
in this tragedy a part entirely passive, even when she held the
centre of the stage.</p>
<p>The vagueness in which she felt that she had been moving was, at
last, dispelled abruptly by a command that she should marry.</p>
<p>Although but sixteen years of age, this was not the first time
that marriage had been discussed for her.</p>
<p>It had been mentioned when she was no more than eleven, by the
Lord High Admiral, the handsome, audacious Thomas Seymour, who had
married the Queen-Dowager, Katherine Parr. The Lady Jane was then
residing (and this had been another mystery to her) in the
Admiral's household. His talk, however, had been vague; a
possibility, no more, had been foreshadowed that she might one day
wed the frail boy who was Seymour's nephew, her own cousin and King
of England.</p>
<p>Even for so unworldly a maid there was glamour in being Queen of
England, and no repugnance to the person of young Edward, whom she
held in a child's innocent affection. No suspicion of ulterior
motive on the part of the splendid Seymour came to cloud her mind.
The project seemed the natural expression of a warm-hearted,
generous uncle's desire for the happiness of two children whom he
loved.</p>
<p>But the Lord High Admiral had lost his head four years ago upon
the scaffold, and since his death the innocent dream he had
encouraged in the Lady Jane had gradually been fading. What
remained of it was now blotted out by this peremptory summons to
marry a stranger.</p>
<p>Her mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, that Lady Frances who was
the daughter of the late King's sister, Mary Tudor, brought her the
announcement in terms that invited thanksgiving. Instead, it
momentarily startled the girl out of the passivity to which the
stern ruling of her life had trained her.</p>
<p>'Because I know, madam, that only my good is sought, I am
grateful. But it is not a benefit that I desire.'</p>
<p>The Duchess, who had inherited with other Tudor attributes their
broad, harsh-featured countenance, was formidable when she frowned.
She was frowning now.</p>
<p>'That you desire! God a' mercy! It is a benefit that your father
and I desire for you.'</p>
<p>'But if I do not desire it for myself, then it can be no
benefit.'</p>
<p>Darker grew the frown of King Harry's sister. 'It is for us to
judge, child.'</p>
<p>'But it would be for me to endure.'</p>
<p>'Will you be pert and forward with me, Jane?'</p>
<p>'God forbid, madam!' Nevertheless she ventured gently to urge
her views: that she was too young for marriage, and that in any
case it would be unnatural to accept for husband this Lord Guilford
Dudley, who she had never seen, and of whom she knew nothing save
that the Duke of Northumberland was his father. She did not
add&mdash;as she might have done had she, indeed, been
forward&mdash;that in her eyes this was nothing to the proposed
bridegroom's credit.</p>
<p>'You know also,' said her mother, keeping a tight grip upon her
Tudor temper, 'that he is the husband chosen for you by your
father, and that should be knowledge enough to warrant a maid's
obedience.'</p>
<p>'Surely in such a matter a maid's own choice is also to be
weighed.'</p>
<p>'It has been weighed for you.' The Duchess tightened her
obstinate mouth. 'And it has been settled.'</p>
<p>There was first reproach and then a blur of tears in the soft
hazel eyes. Suddenly lonely and afraid, the girl ached to cast
herself for comfort and protection upon the vast bosom of this
mother in whom she had found little more than a taskmistress.</p>
<p>The Duchess reported to the Duke. Suffolk, a large man,
good-natured and weak, was rarely permitted by his masterful wife
to take the preferred line of least resistance.</p>
<p>'Wait until she has seen the lad,' he counselled. 'Jane's a
woman, I suppose.'</p>
<p>The Duchess agreed that Guilford Dudley's physical attractions
might help to conquer her daughter's perversity, and Guilford, a
well-grown, comely lad of seventeen, was brought by his father that
same afternoon to Suffolk House.</p>
<p>He came, arrayed like a bridegroom, in shimmering white satin.
But not the Archangel Gabriel himself could have found favour in
the eyes of the Lady Jane if thus thrust upon her. And although the
tall lad seemed as gentle and amiable as he was certainly handsome,
it remained that he was the son of a man who had ever aroused dread
and aversion in her sensitive soul.</p>
<p>He was standing before her now, at his son's side, this sturdy,
athletic man of fifty, who was Duke of Northumberland, Master of
the King's Household, Lord President of the Council, and virtually
King of England. For the frail boy who lay sick at Greenwich was no
more than a mask for the dominant John Dudley.</p>
<p>The Lady Jane stood mute and abashed under his prominent, bold
eyes, without response to the pleasantries with which he sought to
ingratiate both himself and the smiling boy beside him. When her
mother, between jest and earnest, bade her not to play the ninny,
Northumberland's deep voice was raised in her defence. Shyness on
such an occasion was to be looked for in a maid, boldness to be
contemned. Thus with a laugh and a heavy hand upon her shoulder, in
a friendliness under which she shuddered. When the formal visit had
ended and Northumberland and his son had again departed, the
defiance barely repressed in their presence broke forth again. Her
parents, she declared to her mother, wasted their time in
concerting a marriage to which she would never be a party.</p>
<p>The Duchess strove with her indignation.</p>
<p>'Ungrateful child! Has all your studying taught you no better
than to be undutiful?'</p>
<p>'There is,' she gently protested, 'a duty to my immortal soul,
which marriage against inclination would imperil.'</p>
<p>This was something in which the wits of the Duchess could not
keep pace with those of her daughter. A dispute began in which her
grace found herself no match for the well-tutored girl. Worsted
polemically, she yet prevailed physically by boxing the child's
ears, and then went off in exasperation to the Duke.</p>
<p>His grace was annoyed. It was ever the fate of this man who was
fundamentally ease-loving to be swept into strife by wills stronger
than his own.</p>
<p>'Perhaps, if she were told what is really at issue...' he
ventured, but got no further, being withered there by her grace's
scorn.</p>
<p>'By God's Mother, that is the advice I might expect from you.
Will you publish it before the proper season, and so ruin all? Go
reason with your daughter. Like Satan, she may quote Scripture to
her needs. She's stuffed with piety. She has every kind of it, save
filial piety. Your duty is to birch her into a proper understanding
of the Second Commandment.'</p>
<p>The flabby Suffolk went to try his hand. He was met by arguments
which bewildered him and intercessions which distressed him. But he
went in awe of his Duchess and Northumberland, who were set upon
the match. He pulled her to him with a kindly roughness, and trod
upon forbidden ground.</p>
<p>'My dear, great issues hang upon this union.'</p>
<p>'Great issues!' The distressed little countenance was raised to
his. 'Great to whom?'</p>
<p>'To whom?' He was disconcerted. 'To whom but to you, child?'</p>
<p>'What great issue to me can hang upon marriage with a
Dudley?'</p>
<p>In seeking the answer to that question Suffolk discovered that
he had uttered only a half-truth. The greatness for her was but a
shadow of the substance that Northumberland would grasp.</p>
<p>She pressed him. 'What mystery do you make with me?'</p>
<p>'Mystery!' The words scared him, and he was driven by fear to
violence.</p>
<p>All was not accomplished yet to conquer a reluctance that was
founded partly upon religious and partly upon romantic scruples.
But in the end her parents broke it down, and not, it is said, by
argument alone. Her father is accused of beating her into
submission. And so, she was driven, <i>tanquam ovis</i> (as her
scholarly cousin, the Princess Elizabeth, might have said) to the
sacrificial altar, on Whitsunday of that year 1553, at Durham
House, Northumberland's great palace in the Strand.</p>
<p>The mystery which Lady Jane had sensed in her marriage of
constraint became a mystery within a mystery when at the same time
her sister, Katherine, was made the wife of Lord Pembroke's heir,
and Northumberland's daughter took Lord Hastings to husband.</p>
<p>The Lady Jane had not lived so aloof from the world that she did
not perceive in these alliances a consolidation by the terrible
Northumberland of his great position.</p>
<p>That triple marriage at Durham House rings down the curtain on
the first act of the tragedy of this little maid.</p>
<p>It rises again on the second act, in the palace at Greenwich, a
few days later.</p>
<p>There in a room whose embayed window overlooks the river, the
sickly yellow-haired boy of sixteen who is King of England lies
mortally ill. The imminence of his death, unsuspected as yet by the
general, is a grave and perilous matter to many, and to none more
grave and perilous than to John Dudley.</p>
<p>A war to end war had been fought with France in the late King's
reign. But no sooner had they signed the peace that was to be
everlasting, than in England men were at one another's throats on
the subject of the manner in which God should be worshipped. The
worst offences against the moral law became venial by comparison
with errors of opinion. The Reformation had divided the country
sharply into two parties; and at the head of the Protestants,
feared and mistrusted though he might be, John Dudley had placed
himself as masterfully as he had placed himself at the head of the
State.</p>
<p>As matters stood, the death of the King must mean his ruin; for
by the dispositions of the will of Henry VIII, confirmed by Act of
Parliament, Edward would be succeeded by his sister Mary, a woman
so bitterly hostile to the new forms of worship that Dudley could
look for no favour or even mercy from her. But Dudley, who in war
had proved himself a thunderbolt and in council was as formidable
by subtlety, would not go down in ruin without a struggle. To the
uttermost would he employ the power he had won, taking measures to
forestall events and avert disaster. The marriage of his son to the
Lady Jane Grey had been one of these measures.</p>
<p>He stood now, squarely built and vigorous, beside the day-bed
set near the window, so that the sufferer might look out upon the
river and the shipping.</p>
<p>'How fares your highness this morning?'</p>
<p>The boy smiled up at him from light-coloured eyes that were too
bright. A hectic patch of colour on each cheekbone served but to
stress the milky pallor on which it flamed.</p>
<p>'Better and stronger. Am I not, good Master Owen?'</p>
<p>The black-gowned doctor on his other side gravely bent his grey
head. 'Indeed, sire.' He addressed the Duke: 'I have assured his
highness that if he continues thus he will not tarry long at
Greenwich.'</p>
<p>'I shall go to Windsor, where I can hunt,' the boy
announced.</p>
<p>But Northumberland had understood that Doctor Owen alluded to a
longer journey.</p>
<p>He expressed his satisfaction, then dismissed the doctor and the
others who were in attendance.</p>
<p>Alone with the King, he drew up a stool, and sat down familiarly
by the couch. He talked awhile of what His Majesty should do
presently, when more advanced in a recovery which he knew would
never take place.</p>
<p>'Monsieur de Noailles is asking for an audience, sire. I shall
rejoice both him and his master, the King of France, with the news
that very soon now&mdash;perhaps next week&mdash;your highness will
be strong enough to receive him.'</p>
<p>From this he shifted the talk to dogs and horses, and the
hunting awaiting the King at Windsor, and thence at last came
tip-toeing to the real matter of his visit.</p>
<p>'Kings, sire, are not as other men. Their vast responsibilities
do not end with life, as I have already shown your grace. Whilst we
pray and believe that a long and glorious reign awaits you, yet
even on the threshold as you stand of jocund life, it is your duty,
sire, to your loving subjects, to provide for the time when God may
call you to His mercy.'</p>
<p>The boy nodded. 'I have given thought to it.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' The Duke stroked his dark spade-beard. His prominent eyes
were intently upon the solemn young face. 'Then your highness will
not have failed to perceive your duty not only to England but to
God. The glorious work that you have done for your subjects and for
religion, the reformation of the Church in which you have so nobly
and wisely carried forward the great achievements of your splendid
father, may all be destroyed unless you make due provision.'</p>
<p>In these implications of great powers wisely exerted there was a
subtle flattery that drew a transient flush to the wasted face.</p>
<p>'I must be mindful of the welfare of my people,' said the child.
'This English fold must not lie at the mercy of Roman wolves.'</p>
<p>'A brave phrase, sire. A kingly phrase. Would that your great
father could have lived to hear you utter it. Would that he could
be in my place here to tell you that there is no security against
those Roman wolves in the succession as it now stands. The Word of
God is in danger. The Church you have set up is in jeopardy. The
Lady Mary's mind you know, sire. She is a capital and principal
enemy of God's Word. Her devotion to Rome will lay in ruins the
temple you have laboured so gloriously to build.'</p>
<p>Again the boy nodded, the shadow of thought upon his
countenance.</p>
<p>'Do I not know? Has it not been a trouble to me ever since I
heard of her harsh obstinacy with Master Ridley? I give thanks to
God that at least there are no Roman gyves upon my sweet sister
Temperance.'</p>
<p>'The Lady Elizabeth?' Northumberland's eyebrows arched
themselves. His great eyes were wide and sad. 'Can your grace be
sure? And even if so now, what if hereafter she should marry a
foreign prince? You will perceive the danger to your realm in
that.'</p>
<p>The King raised himself feebly on his elbow, so as to look
squarely at the Duke. 'But if neither of my sisters, whom then can
I trust?'</p>
<p>Northumberland rose. Majestic and compelling he stood over the
dying boy, and his deep voice became vibrant with authority.</p>
<p>'There are those who under the will of your glorious father
follow upon the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth: the descendants
of Your Majesty's aunt, her grace of Suffolk, whom you know to be
firm and steadfast in their loyalty to God's Word. Should Your
Majesty&mdash;which Heaven forefend&mdash;die childless, it were
best that the crown should pass to them and their lawful issue,
going over those who being by Parliament pronounced illegitimate
should never have been included in the succession.'</p>
<p>At this, however, the boy frowned, and his voice grew haughty
from displeasure.</p>
<p>'Do you censure my father's dispositions, my lord?'</p>
<p>The bold eyes of Northumberland stared him down. 'Where those
dispositions are opposed to the welfare of your people and the
service of the Church you have built up, I should be unworthy to
advise your grace if any fear restrained my speech.' His words were
those of a dutiful servant; but his tone was that of the
master.</p>
<p>The child's defiance was subdued. He sank back wearily upon his
pillows, his hands, emaciated to translucency, plucking at the rich
bearskin rug that covered his legs.</p>
<p>'We will consider further,' he said. 'There is no haste in
this.'</p>
<p>'In the service of God and the realm, may it please your grace,
there is always haste.'</p>
<p>'Come to me again in a day or two, my lord,' he was answered, as
if in agreement. 'Lying here I will ponder it all, God guiding me.
You shall know my pleasure.'</p>
<p>The Duke bowed himself out.</p>
<p>It required some further persuasion, skilfully employed so as to
dupe the boy into believing that he acted independently, before he
drew up what he called a 'device' for the succession: a wordy
document, which you still may read as set down in his own hand,
taking for starting-points the premonstrance that 'the ladie Mary
and the ladie Elizabeth' were 'illegitemate and not lawfully
begotten.'</p>
<p>In its original form it was not at all as Northumberland would
have it. To the reasons of illegitimacy he had urged for passing
over the Ladies Mary and Elizabeth, the boy had added yet another
reason, of his own: that no woman should reign in England, where no
woman yet had reigned. Therefore his device provided that failing
male issue of his own body, the crown should go to the male heirs
of his aunt's descendants.</p>
<p>But this was not at all what Northumberland required. Frowning
still, he sat down to amend the matter. When at last he departed
from the presence of a sick child, worn out with argument and
bewildered into agreement, the wording of the device as it applied
to his son's wife had been altered from 'the Lady Jane's heirs
males,' to 'the Lady Jane and her heirs males.'</p>
<p>As he had dominated the King, so Northumberland presently
dominated the Council. Naturally there was opposition, fiercely
stubborn at first, born chiefly of fear of the storm which this
tampering with the succession might provoke. But with the stout
support of Pembroke and Northampton, Northumberland masterfully
stood his ground. When all was said, he had an argument to which
there was one only answer.</p>
<p>'Have you weighed the alternative to yourselves?' he asked them
with a touch of scorn. 'Have you considered what will happen if
that Romish bigot Mary comes to the throne? Whose hands amongst you
will she regard as clean? Suffer my bluntness. The rewards of your
labours have come to you from the Church which you have
dispossessed. Her view will be that you are gorged with
sacrilegious plunder. What mercy will she show you? Consider and
resolve yourselves. And make haste. The King is dying fast.'</p>
<p>He had made them understand that for their own sakes they must
see the King's will drawn as he would have it.</p>
<p>But now the lawyers made a difficulty. Conducted by
Northumberland to the King, they stood aghast at his command that
they should embody in letters patent the device which he disclosed.
There were five of them&mdash;the Lord Chief Justice Montague and
another judge, the Chancellor of the Augmentations, the
Attorney-General, and the Solicitor-General. Sir Edward Montague
expressed the mind of all in what he said.</p>
<p>'May it please your grace, it is impossible. No letters patent
can set aside an Act of Parliament. This would be treason.'</p>
<p>The boy's light eyebrows knit.</p>
<p>'Treason! When I will it? I, the King?'</p>
<p>From Northumberland, standing at the royal pillow, came a gust
of angry laughter. 'Are you answered, master lawyer? Or have you
not law enough to know that the only treason here is that which you
have uttered?'</p>
<p>'That is well said, as my father would have made you feel,'
piped the child. 'God of mercy! Not on your life durst you have
spoken so to him. He would have had your head for less.'</p>
<p>Old Sir Edward stood unabashed. 'We who are the servants of the
law...'</p>
<p>He was interrupted. 'God's death! Are you not my servants?'</p>
<p>'Most dutiful servants, may it please Your Majesty. And it is
our duty and service to expound the law. It is set forth in the Act
of Succession that any person going about interfering with the
succession as therein ordained shall be guilty of high
treason.'</p>
<p>Northumberland advanced a step, his hands clenched, his voice
rough.</p>
<p>'Where is your law, you fool? Where your wits? "Any person," you
say. Does that cover the King's majesty? The "interference" will
not be your act, but the King's, to whom you are as the quills he
writes with. Can the King then commit treason?'</p>
<p>Although he trembled before the fury of the terrible Duke, Sir
Edward still avoided a direct answer.</p>
<p>'It remains, my lord, that whatever we do is useless against an
Act of Parliament. Only another Act of Parliament can alter
that.'</p>
<p>The boy interposed, to cut the Gordian knot, the Tudor
peremptoriness aroused in him. 'Then I'll call a Parliament to
ratify what I now bid you do. You have my commands. Make a book for
me of this my device, and make it without delay. No more.
Away!'</p>
<p>A fit of coughing shook and tore him. Doctor Owen and a page,
who had remained at hand, ran to ease his posture and support him.
Northumberland waved the lawyers out.</p>
<p>They departed to study the Act of Succession, but found no
comfort in it. In their difficulty they leaned upon the fact that
whilst the King lived there could be no treason in obeying him. But
to cover them thereafter, they demanded an order under the Great
Seal, signed by all the members of the Council, and when this had
been obtained they complied at last.</p>
<p>That happened in mid-June, and some three weeks later the last
Tudor king expired.</p>
<p>Northumberland took his measures briskly, keeping the death
secret until he should have secured the person of the Lady Mary,
who, at large, might stir up mischief. To Hunsdon went a message
that her brother, desperately ill, was insistently asking for her.
She set out at once; but at Hoddesdon she was met by word from
Arundel, who secretly playing the traitor so as to make himself
safe whatever happened, informed her that the King was dead. At
once she perceived the trap, and took measures to avoid it.</p>
<p>Edward VI died on the evening of Thursday the sixth July. On the
morning of the following Sunday, the Lady Jane was summoned from
the Duke of Northumberland's house at Chelsea, where she was then
residing, to go at once to Sion House to receive a message from the
King. She obeyed eagerly, spurred by affection for her royal cousin
and anxieties for his health.</p>
<p>In a splendid room of that splendid palace at
Isleworth&mdash;yet another of the great properties wrested from
the Church&mdash;Northumberland and his Duchess came to her, and
with them came the Lady Jane's parents, the Earl of Pembroke,
Northampton and his lady, Huntingdon, and the double-dealer
Arundel. An atmosphere of portentousness overhung the assembly.</p>
<p>Some ten days earlier, at a ball at Durham House, the Lady Jane
had discerned a subtle change towards her, a deeper deference than
had ever yet been paid to her by these great nobles. That, however,
did not prepare her for their present attitude of veneration. The
splendid Pembroke was kneeling to kiss her hand.</p>
<p>Her father-in-law, after a fleeting smile for her almost scared
bewilderment, gravely began the overwhelming explanation.</p>
<p>'The King has been called by God to His mercy.'</p>
<p>She cried out at this, interrupting him. 'Dead! Edward dead!'
White-faced, she looked round from one to another of those grave
countenances, her lip trembling, her eyes aswim in tears. 'Edward!'
she repeated, and added softly, 'God rest his gentle soul!'</p>
<p>'Amen!' said Northumberland. 'A godly life has come to a godly
end. Let that console our sorrow. To protect the realm from false
opinions, to guard it from his unworthy sister, he well weighed the
statute under which the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth had been
cut off from the succession as bastards born, and he has bequeathed
the crown to his cousin the Lady Jane and to her sisters after her,
should she die childless.'</p>
<p>Thereupon Northumberland, too, went down upon his knees; and the
others, kneeling with him in homage to Jane the Queen, made solemn
oath to defend her title with their lives.</p>
<p>The girl in sudden terror, flinging forth both hands in a
repelling gesture, cried out: 'No! No!' A moment she stood shaking
as with a palsy, then rustled down without further warning into a
little unconscious heap.</p>
<p>She recovered in the arms of her mother, with the Duchess of
Northumberland and Lady Northampton in close attendance. Beyond
these stood the lords in a concerned semicircle. Someone had set
wide a window to let air into the room, where the heat had been
oppressive.</p>
<p>Returning consciousness of her position quickened by hearing
herself addressed as 'Majesty,' she covered her face with her
hands.</p>
<p>'No, no!' Her tone was piteous. 'That is not for me. It may not
be. My head could never bear the burden of a crown.'</p>
<p>The Duchess of Northumberland frowned and pursed her lips. She
had never forgiven, and never would forgive, the reluctance to wed
her son which Jane had displayed. Was this prim girl, her head
stuffed with useless learning, still further to prove a fool by a
similar reluctance to accept a crown?</p>
<p>Cunning Northumberland, however, knew when to cajole and when to
storm. He was grave of countenance and of voice.</p>
<p>'Your Majesty's courage may well falter. There is no person of
worth but would find the burden heavy. But since it is imposed upon
you by God's will, and for the welfare of the realm, we call upon
Your Majesty to bear it cheerfully in the assurance that you will
be supported stoutly and loyally, as we have sworn.'</p>
<p>When he spoke of it as God's will he was less untruthful than
may appear. There are good grounds for assuming that Northumberland
was his own God.</p>
<p>She wrung her hands in distress. 'If you love me sincerely and
in good earnest, you will rather wish me a quiet fortune than this
exaltation for which I am insufficient.'</p>
<p>Then Pembroke, on the note the Duke had struck, gently chided
her.</p>
<p>'That is to want for faith, Your Majesty. God who has called you
to this great destiny will not forsake you in it.'</p>
<p>She drew a hand across her brow in a gesture of helpless
bewilderment.</p>
<p>'It comes to me in a message of affliction. It only deepens my
distress at the death of the King. Let me&mdash;let me at least
take thought before I decide.'</p>
<p>'Decide?' cried Northumberland. But at once he cast the sudden
harshness from his voice. 'It is decided for Your Majesty. This is
not a choice that is offered, but a sacred duty that is
imposed.'</p>
<p>Thus they talked on until her enfeebling resistance was
completely broken down, until she fell on her knees, and clasping
her hands, announced her surrender in terms of prayer.</p>
<p>'I humbly beseech God that if what is given me is in truth
legitimately mine, He will grant me grace and power to govern to
His glory and service and for the good of this realm of
England.'</p>
<p>Thus the general tension was eased at last. The lips of
Northumberland's Duchess relaxed from their hard lines. Thereafter
whilst those men were about the measures necessary to make all
safe, her mother and her mother-in-law took charge of the child's
education in what lay ahead.</p>
<p>At the steps of the Tower, in the sunshine of the following
afternoon, Jane, her inward awe overlaid by the demure calm that
was normal to her little person, was handed by Northumberland from
the state barge which had brought her from Richmond.</p>
<p>A great crowd had gathered on the wharf, but a crowd which gaped
in silence, without a welcoming cheer for the slight figure muffled
in its regal trappings.</p>
<p>This silence, and the silence which elsewhere greeted the
heralds' proclamations of Queen Jane, may have conveyed a warning
to Northumberland of a factor outside his calculations: the natural
sense of justice of the people.</p>
<p>Queen Jane, looking for no acclamations, did not find it strange
that only the archers of the guard should cry, 'God save the
Queen!' and that no echo of it should come from the assembled
multitude.</p>
<p>Stepping daintily on the arm of the scarlet-cloaked
Northumberland, her mother, King Harry's portly sister, bearing her
ponderous train, she passed to the destiny carved for her by the
ambitions of others, and the Tower gates closed behind her.</p>
<p>She had suffered herself to be raised to the throne as passively
as to be conducted into wedlock.</p>
<p>That very night she was to begin to understand why both these
things had happened to her. She had retired to her room, with her
gentlewomen Catherine Tilney and Eleyn, and tired and listless she
was about to prepare herself for bed, when the Marquis of
Winchester, who was Lord Treasurer, sought her with the crown.</p>
<p>He had thought to gratify her by the request that she should try
it on. He was shocked by her indifference. Gently he used
insistence.</p>
<p>'Nay, nay, madam. Take it boldly, so that if it does not fit, it
may be altered whilst the other crown is being made for your
husband.'</p>
<p>He had succeeded at least in dispelling her listlessness. 'For
my husband?' She was staring at him.</p>
<p>'Why, madam, for the King.'</p>
<p>'The King? There is no king in England, my lord.'</p>
<p>'No king, madam. But My Lord Guilford, then&mdash;'</p>
<p>'My Lord Guilford?' It was now that understanding came to her.
She was suddenly endowed with a frosty dignity. 'My Lord Guilford
was not mentioned in King Edward's will. No second crown will be
required.'</p>
<p>Hitherto Winchester, like the others had beheld in her only
timidity. This unexpected display of firmness shook him profoundly.
Northumberland being absent, his lordship sought Northumberland's
lady with his dismay.</p>
<p>With Guilford at her heels, and waiving ceremony, the Duchess
invaded the Queen's apartments. She stormed in to prove that when
emotion governs, a duchess is as much a woman as a fishwife.</p>
<p>'What's this my Lord of Winchester reports?'</p>
<p>The Lady Jane had never failed to stand in the presence of her
mother-in-law. Jane the Queen remained seated. Conscious of the
need to exert the authority which had been thrust upon her, she
preserved her calm whilst the ranting Duchess invoked her son to
call his wife to her duty.</p>
<p>'The Queen,' said Jane, 'is above the wife, and the Queen's duty
above the wife's. It is not for me to make kings. That is not
within my prerogative. Gladly will I make Guilford an earl or a
duke if he wishes; but no more.'</p>
<p>This set Guilford storming, too. 'A duke! You offer me a
dukedom!' In his mortification the tall lad seemed on the point of
tears. 'I am your husband, Jane; and a queen's husband must be a
king.'</p>
<p>Jane, understanding now that it was to make his son a king that
Northumberland had made him her husband, was all strength and
dignity in her sense of right.</p>
<p>'You do not know what you are saying. Only an Act of Parliament,
following upon my consent, could make you King; and that consent it
is my duty&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;to withhold.'</p>
<p>Baffled, the raging Duchess caught her son by the arm.</p>
<p>'Come away. Come away from a wife so ungrateful and undutiful.'
And she dragged him out.</p>
<p>But Jane the Queen having prevailed, Jane the woman softened.
Was Guilford really more than her fellow-victim? She sent for him
again, and comforted the spoilt boy's chagrin. He should have at
least some outward panoply of royalty. He should be styled 'your
grace,' should preside at the Council, and should dine alone in
royal dignity. Let the question of his future title wait.</p>
<p>There was more reason in that decision than was yet apparent to
her who uttered it. Whilst the heralds were proclaiming Queen Jane
to the silent crowds in London, Queen Mary was being proclaimed
with acclamation in Norfolk. Katherine of Aragon's daughter might
not be lovable or loved, and her rule might indeed bring the
dangers of which preachers were thundering, but the country's sense
of justice was outraged by the highhanded action of Northumberland,
who was feared and hated. In the days that followed, the news of
nobles flocking to Mary's standard became so alarming that
Northumberland had no choice but to ride out in arms against
her.</p>
<p>That happened on Friday. Five days later&mdash;on the afternoon
of the following Wednesday&mdash;the Duke of Suffolk abruptly
invaded the room where his daughter sat with her gentlewomen. His
countenance was pale, his eyes were wild, his limbs trembled. He
strode forward, a man whom fear had rendered mannerless, and tore
away the canopy of state under which his daughter was
enthroned.</p>
<p>'Away with these distinctions. They are not for you. It is
finished. You are Queen no longer. Northumberland is a prisoner.
Queen Mary is being proclaimed in Cheap-side. Her men are at the
gates demanding the keys of the Tower.' Thus, in short, sharp,
pregnant sentences he barked out the dreadful tidings.</p>
<p>She rose, not merely calm, but with the air of one from whom a
burden has been lifted. Her relief, and the words in which she
announced it, were fuel to his distraction. 'This news, my lord, is
more welcome than that in which the crown was offered to me. I give
thanks to God for His mercy. I am happy, indeed, to go hence.'</p>
<p>She was to learn that her thankfulness was premature: that to
lay down a crown is as perilous as to take one up. It is true that
on the morrow she departed to return to Sion House, after an
absence of ten days during nine of which she had been Queen of
England. But three days later, on the following Sunday, she was
brought back to the Tower, this time as a prisoner, and with her
came Guilford Dudley and his mother.</p>
<p>Played and lost was Northumberland's desperate game with Fate,
in which he had set upon the board not only his own life but the
innocent life of the Lady Jane among some others. Himself he paid
that forfeit promptly on Tower Hill.</p>
<p>The Lady Jane and Guilford Dudley lay under a sentence of death,
which it began to seem would never be enforced. Months passed, and
within the precincts of the Tower the young prisoners who had
disputed about a crown enjoyed a certain liberty of movement which
they were given reason to hope would presently be increased. And so
no doubt it would have been but that once more the hopes and
aspirations of others came again to affect the passive existence of
the Lady Jane.</p>
<p>The country was disturbed and restive under Mary's religious
intolerance and at the prospect of the marriage with Philip of
Spain upon which she had decided, and for which the starved soul of
that old maid was filled with passionate, impatient longing.
Because of disturbances, Philip postponed his coming. Because of
her impatience, her intolerance increased and bred increased
disturbances. They reached a climax early in the following year
with the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt, which aimed at replacing
Mary by Elizabeth. It was crushed; but it had been within an ace of
succeeding; and as a result the coming of the passionately awaited
Philip seemed postponed more indefinitely than ever.</p>
<p>Simon Renard, the Emperor's ambassador, was at Mary's elbow, to
fret her with the assertion that whilst a danger of turbulence
existed, Philip could not trust his precious person in England. Not
until all those whose lives were a menace to the peace of the realm
had been removed would Philip come; and amongst those the Emperor
gave a prominent place to the Lady Jane. It was a matter of
imperial misapprehension; but lest it should continue to keep the
eagerly awaited husband from her arms, Mary agreed that this
innocent obstacle should be removed and Guilford Dudley with
her.</p>
<p>Of that royal decision word was brought to the Tower on Thursday
the ninth February. Mary's messenger was a priest named Feckenham,
her chaplain and the new Dean of Saint Paul's.</p>
<p>The Lady Jane sat reading by the oriel window of the room in
Partridge's House in which she had been lodged. Mistress Catherine
Tilney was in attendance. She closed the book on her finger when
the priest entered, and greeted him with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>He bowed low. 'I am from the Queen, madam.'</p>
<p>'God save Her Majesty,' he was softly answered. She had reason
to hope for the best. 'You bring a message?'</p>
<p>The old man looked at her long in silence, wounding his own
sensitive soul with pity. Such a child she appeared, so slight and
innocent and sweet, as she sat there in a patch of February
sunlight.</p>
<p>'Alas, madam!' There were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>It was enough. If she lost some colour that was all she lost.
Her tranquillity was scarcely impaired. She inclined her head a
little.</p>
<p>'God's will be done,' she said steadily. 'I will take my death
patiently whenever Her Majesty desires it.' She paused before
asking, When is it to be?'</p>
<p>He choked as he answered her: 'Tomorrow morning.' And he went on
to explain that he had been chosen by her royal cousin to bear this
message so that at the same time he might care for the salvation of
her soul.</p>
<p>Quietly she shook her head. 'The time is short. Too short.'</p>
<p>Misunderstanding her, taking her literally, the good man hurried
back to the Queen, and won for the Lady Jane a respite of three
days, most of which he spent with her. His modest sincerity made it
impossible for her to deny herself to him, and his learning made
him a welcome companion even whilst his endeavours at conversion
failed.</p>
<p>Sunday night she spent in writing, and a beautiful letter
survives that she addressed to her father, then lying similarly
under sentence.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, calm and passive as she had ever been, this
gentle, unoffending victim of the ambitions and desires of others
prepared to meet her end.</p>
<p>From the window of her lodging she beheld Guilford Dudley pass
on his way to Tower Hill. She saw the lad's long body return in a
cart, his head in a cloth, before she was herself led forth by the
Lieutenant of the Tower.</p>
<p>To the scaffold, set up on the green in the shadow of the White
Tower, the Lieutenant conducted her, followed by her weeping
gentlewomen, but herself demure, dry-eyed, and passive as ever. On
that scaffold she stood forth unabashed, a manual of English
prayers in her hands, to address the assembled people.</p>
<p>'Good people, I am come hither to die, by law condemned to the
same. The fact, indeed, against the Queen's majesty was unlawful
and the consenting thereunto by me. But touching the procurement
and desire thereof by me or on my half, I do wash my hands thereof
in innocence before God and the face of you good Christian people
this day.'</p>
<p>After that declaration, she invited the spectators to assist her
with their prayers, and kneeling down she recited in English the
Miserere. Then rising again, she handed her kerchief and gloves to
Mistress Tilney, and to the Lieutenant her book, in which she had
written a message for him.</p>
<p>With steady fingers she untied her gown. The headsman would have
helped her, but she waved him back, claiming the assistance of her
weeping gentlewomen. She removed her coif, letting down her hair
and casting it forward over her eyes. There she bound it with the
blindfolding kerchief which Mistress Tilney gave her.</p>
<p>She was ready.</p>
<p>The headsman, having knelt to beg and receive her forgiveness,
desired her to stand upon the straw. There she went down upon her
knees.</p>
<p>'I pray you dispatch me quickly,' she begged, and added the
question: 'Will you take it off before I lay me down?'</p>
<p>'No, madam,' he answered her.</p>
<p>Thereupon, on her knees, blindfolded, with arms outstretched she
groped before her for the block. 'What shall I do?' she asked.
'Where is it?'</p>
<p>An archer of the guard guided her, and so the fair little head
found its last pillow, her gentle lips spoke their last words:
'Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.'</p>
<p>She was seventeen years of age, and had sinned against none.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>THE 'CROOKED CARCASE'</h2>
<p>A peacock of a man not so much in his plumage&mdash;he was
almost careless in the matter of raiment&mdash;as in the soul of
him was Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex: a man of overweening
vanities, intolerant of superiors, insensately jealous, something
of a braggart-captain, marring what gifts he possessed by
insistence upon them.</p>
<p>Fortune and the ageing Queen had shaped him so.</p>
<p>His father, Walter Devereux, dying in Ireland, had written to
Her Majesty begging her protection for his children. My Lord of
Leicester, who had married the elder Devereux's widow, had brought
the young earl to Court. Further to recommend him there was his
kinship with Her Majesty; for he was a great-grandson of Mary
Boleyn, who had been Elizabeth's aunt. Then, too, there was his
magnificent height and handsome virile countenance to thrust him
upon the notice of this woman who loved to have fine men about her
and whose infatuation it was to desire their worship. For with all
her shrewdness and all her kingcraft, not content with dominion by
virtue of her office, she was hungry also for dominion by virtue of
her sex. It was at once her weakness and her strength, perhaps the
secret of her persistence in her maidenhood. Belonging to none, she
could command the adoration of all, and the service of a maiden
queen was in itself an incentive to chivalrous endeavour for all
upon whom she smiled as she would no longer have smiled had she
been a wife. To the power so gained and held she sacrificed her
muliebrity, cheating it the while with extravagant flirtations, in
which her demands of fidelity and devotion were exorbitant, since
they were fidelity and devotion to a simulacrum. And she had been
so sung and flattered by romantics and by sycophants as to persuade
her that had she not been born to sovereign estate her charms must
still have rendered her sovereign amongst women. The persuasion had
become so ingrained that not even age&mdash;against whose ravages
she entrenched herself by every means of art&mdash;could weaken
it.</p>
<p>She was a woman in the middle fifties when this handsome,
well-grown lad of twenty-two who was Earl of Essex came to receive
from her a favour even more intimate than that which she had
accorded to Leicester, Ralegh, Christopher Hatton, and some others.
He responded, as they had done, by worshipping the woman whilst
reverencing the Queen. Leicester had schooled him, and patterns of
conduct abounded, from the graceful, gifted Ralegh, the Captain of
her Guard, who did not boggle at describing her now as Dian, now as
Venus, and now even as Orpheus. She may have presumed a little upon
the kinship to permit herself rather more licence with Essex than
with any of the others. She made him almost at the outset Master of
the Horse, and she would keep him at cards, or at one game or
another, the whole night through, so that he did not return to his
own lodging until the birds were singing in the morning. And he who
in his vanity was ready enough to parade his kinship with Her
Majesty was in his vanity as ready to forget it for the more
flattering conviction that he owed the favours showered upon him to
his irresistibility as a man. He presumed upon it early. His nature
was too arrogant for the perfect courtier. He permitted himself,
upon the slightest provocation, petulances and waywardnesses which,
providing her with a novel experience, may merely have sharpened
her desire to have him at her feet. So that his very faults
enhanced him in her eyes. His troublesome explosions of jealousy
she condoned as springing from a fondness so deep that it could
brook no rivals.</p>
<p>One of his meaner displays of this was made at the expense of
young Charles Blount, who had earned by a success in the tilt-yard
the gift of a gold chess-queen from Her Majesty. Proud of his
token, the young man came on the morrow to the privy chamber
wearing it dangling from his arm.</p>
<p>Essex was lounging there with Greville and some others who paid
court to him. He scowled upon the lad, who stood fully as tall as
himself, with, moreover, a grace of deportment which nature had
denied the Earl.</p>
<p>'Ha! Here's a new mode,' said he. 'That thing upon his arm. What
is it?'</p>
<p>'Sh!' murmured Greville. 'It is the Queen's favour, sent him
yesterday after the tilting.'</p>
<p>Essex laughed unpleasantly and his voice was loud. 'So! Now I
perceive that every fool must have a favour.'</p>
<p>Blount turned and smiled. 'Just as every empty head must still
have a tongue to proclaim its emptiness.'</p>
<p>The Earl took a quick step forward, breathing fire. Then he was
checked. The door of the bedchamber had been thrown open. The
scarlet yeomen of the guard who kept the threshold grew as rigid as
their ordered halberts. Her Majesty was coming.</p>
<p>She entered, a woman of middle height, her leanness dissembled
by her swelling farthingale. She came fresh from the hands of her
tirewomen, the wrinkles smoothed from her thin, painted cheeks; her
yellow wig entwined with pearls; the tall lace collar an effulgence
of jewels. She was in white silk, sewn with pearls as large as
beans, and over this was hung a black silk mantle shot with silver.
In her carriage there was still, thanks to her tough vigour, the
grace of youth.</p>
<p>The courtiers knelt.</p>
<p>Her advent spoilt the beginnings of a very pretty quarrel. But
it did not quench the flame that had been kindled. That afternoon
in Mary la Bonne Park, Charles Blount and the Earl pursued their
argument, and my Lord of Essex received a sword-thrust in the thigh
for his impertinence.</p>
<p>When next, a fortnight or so later, he came limping into the
privy chamber, his young lordship was in no good humour. It had
been reported to him that when the Queen heard of the encounter,
instead of distress on his dear behalf and indignation against
Blount, she had exclaimed:</p>
<p>'By God's death, it is fit that someone should take the Earl
down, otherwise there would be no ruling him.'</p>
<p>She could not, however, be really angry with him, since her
vanity was sweetly flattered to perceive that it was for her that
he had fought. So presently she carried him off to her closet,
there to enjoy the luxury of fondly chiding him.</p>
<p>'This was ill done, sir,' she deplored. 'And what is worse, the
quarrel began in the palace here, and might have gone further but
for my coming when I did. Will you make a bear-pit of my privy
chamber?'</p>
<p>Behind his fair curling beard his teeth were displayed in an
acid smile.</p>
<p>'It would be your Captain of the Guard who bore that tale.'</p>
<p>To sneer at Ralegh was no new thing in him. There was none who
so moved his spleen as the lofty imperturbable Sir Walter. He had
expressed it more than once in rudeness unpardonable, actually
bidding Her Majesty to choose between them, insolently threatening
to withdraw himself from her service if Ralegh were suffered to
continue in it. Yet because of the adulation of the jealousy behind
his humours she had forgiven the effrontery. Thus her vanity and
his own were in alliance to dig a pit for his ultimate ruin.</p>
<p>He was being bitter now. He was presuming to reproach her. She
heeded, lie complained, what every unscrupulous tongue might say
behind his back. God knew what profit his enemies had made in these
last two weeks. It was too great a torment for him. He would leave
the court. He would go his ways and trouble her no more.</p>
<p>The sudden light of fear in her small, dark, piercing eyes
encouraged him to go on.</p>
<p>Some day, if he remained, some such knave as Ralegh would so
poison her mind against him that she would drive him forth in
obloquy, or worse. Far better that he should go now, whilst he
retained some measure, however shrunken, of that esteem that was as
the very breath of his body to him.</p>
<p>By such arts he brought her at length to intercede with him. She
coaxed him with fair words, her fingers caressing his cheek; and
because he was still unyielding, she drew from one of those
delicate fingers a ring set with a lozenge diamond.</p>
<p>'Wear this for me, Robin, and let it be a talisman. If ever such
a thing should come to pass, that by any evil chance you should
lose my favour, send me this ring again, and I swear to you by my
soul's salvation that it shall at once restore you. Are you safe
now?'</p>
<p>It was enough. In the moment of victory, he would be generous
with the vanquished, with this fond old woman whom he perceived to
be as wax for his moulding. On his knees he swore to her that he
valued his life only for the service he might render her and the
joy he took in that service.</p>
<p>Yet for all such professions, his airs were ever those of a
master rather than a servant, and for ten years his jealousies and
pretensions were constantly to try the patience and strain the
infatuation of his sovereign.</p>
<p>Because not all his lordship's backbiting could prejudice her
against Ralegh, he would, but for her vigorous intervention, have
fought Sir Walter as he had fought young Blount. A challenge
actually passed between them, but had no sequel because of the
vigorous intervention of the Queen. Because Norreys was given the
command of the troops for France, Essex departed the court in a fit
of temper. Because the credit of the Cadiz expedition was accorded
to the Lord Admiral, Lord Thomas Howard, with whom he had sailed on
that adventure, he was so infuriated that he went about like a
roaring captain, offering to fight any gentleman of the name of
Howard. Because Lord Cobham was given the wardenship of the Cinque
Ports, he again went off in a pet, and to coax him back Elizabeth
made him Master of the Ordnance. As a further solatium to his
temper she created him Earl Marshal, in violation of the hereditary
rights of Thomas Howard.</p>
<p>But not all the honours and all the wealth she showered on this
spoilt darling could reconcile him to her favour to others, or
beget in him a proper gratitude sufficient to stifle his secret
scorn of her person and even of her affection. Nor was it always
secret. There were moments of irritation in which his insolence
would permit it to become manifest; and once in the council
chamber, under opposition, by behaving as offensively as an
unbirched schoolboy, he provoked her into correcting him as if he
had been just that.</p>
<p>'Go and be hanged,' she said, and boxed his ears.</p>
<p>She was a woman, she was his sovereign, and in some sort he
stood to her as a lover. Yet under the blow the wayward fool must
snatch at his sword-hilt, and if the Lord Admiral had not got
between them and laid hands upon him, he would have drawn the
weapon. Though what he would have done with it when he had drawn
it, is not to be surmised. But whilst the Lord Admiral could thus
restrain the fellow's hands, he could not restrain his feckless
tongue.</p>
<p>'As God's my life,' he roared, 'I would not have taken that blow
from the King your father,' which only serves to show how little he
knew about the King her father. But he was encountering something
now of that King Henry's spirit in the eyes of King Henry's
daughter, hearing it in the harsh, mannish voice that stormed back
at him, cursing him roundly. For he had roused the Tudor lioness by
conduct that deeply wounded at once her affection and her
pride.</p>
<p>'God's death, fool,' she ended her tirade, 'you'ld have it
thought that you rule this realm of mine.'</p>
<p>He glared at her and at the shocked countenances of the five who
stood there. Then he ranted: 'Let Solomon's fool laugh when he is
stricken. Let those who mean to take their profit of princes show
no sense of princes' injuries. As for me, this is an indignity I'll
not suffer: not even from a King in petticoats.'</p>
<p>'Ha! A King in petticoats!' cried she. 'Why, you fishwife in
breeches, get you hence with your railing. Hence, and learn to mend
your manners, or by God's Son, I'll make you the most pitiful
fellow in England. Hence!'</p>
<p>He went out with violence.</p>
<p>This, the worst yet by far of their lovers' quarrels, took some
months to heal. Essex would heed no advice that he should sue for
pardon to a Queen to whom he owed so much. For months he kept aloof
in sullen resentment. He had her ring and her oath; but he would
not avail himself of them. He trusted that her fondness in the end
would bring her to beg of him a forgiveness which in his arrogance
he would not beg of her.</p>
<p>It is not clear who made the first move towards a
reconciliation. But five months later, towards the end of that year
1596, he was back at court, though not for long. His grasping
jealousy again curtailed his sojourn there.</p>
<p>All Ireland was in flagrant rebellion under the able military
leadership of the Earl of Tyrone, and a Lord Deputy was to be
appointed to go over and reduce it to submission. Essex raised such
objections to every man proposed for the office that in the end he
found it thrust upon himself, and he took it only because he could
not brook that it should be bestowed upon another. Yet having taken
it, he lamented a fate that must banish him from the Queen's side,
and by his lamentations, in which this man who loved himself so
dearly, ranted of self-hatred and the desire for death, he
succeeded in reawakening all her tenderness. The melancholy in
which he came to kiss her hand in leave-taking was seen to move her
deeply.</p>
<p>Apart from this, his departure was something of a triumph.
Crowds assembled to see him pass in his martial glory and to
acclaim him. For he was in high favour with the populace. Unlike
Ralegh, who openly despised the rascal multitude, Essex had ever
studied to win its regard, and in his dealings with it displayed
none of the arrogance which he used towards his peers.</p>
<p>In the conduct of affairs in Ireland he followed his own
judgment rather than obeyed instructions. He kept an almost regal
state and freely bestowed the accolade of knighthood, which, whilst
according with the laws of chivalry, had come to be regarded as the
sole prerogative of the sovereign. Adverse criticisms of his
military measures reaching him from the council merely angered a
spirit impatient of criticism. Disregarding them, he held
obstinately to his course, negotiating with Tyrone instead of
fighting; and so he came under suspicion of treason, and was at
last made aware of it by an angry letter from the Queen. A sudden
fear now battled with his fury. He persuaded himself that those
rascals Ralegh, Cobham, and Cecil were traducing him, poisoning the
Queen's mind against him so as to achieve his ruin. He would come
home, he wrote, and justify himself. Sternly ordered to remain
where he was, he came nevertheless. But for Sir Christopher Blount,
his present stepfather, who was with him, he would have returned in
arms, with a body of troops at his heels, the better to assert
himself.</p>
<p>In the early hours of a foul morning of late September the
insubordinate gentleman reached Lambeth, and with a half-dozen
companions, among whom were Blount and Harington, the Queen's
godson, he rode hard for London Bridge and Nonsuch Palace, so as to
take Her Majesty by surprise before anyone should prevent him.</p>
<p>It was striking ten when he reached the palace. In his
impatience ignoring etiquette and never staying to remove the mud
from his clothes, or even the splashes of it from his face, he
stalked breathlessly into the privy chamber with his gentlemen.
Finding that the Queen had not yet come forth, he went boldly
forward under the startled eyes of the assembled courtiers. The
stalwart guards dared not lower their halberts to form a barrier.
For his lordship was one of a half-dozen intimates who enjoyed the
rare privilege of the freedom of the bedchamber.</p>
<p>The Queen, in a bedgown, was about to deliver herself into the
hands of her tirewomen to be made ready for the day. Turning to see
who dared break in upon her so impetuously and noisily, she
stiffened at sight of him, and her brows met.</p>
<p>'You! Who gave you leave to come here?'</p>
<p>Before she could say more he was on his knees at her feet.</p>
<p>He had caught her hands, those lovely hands of which she was so
vain, and he was kissing them passionately, mumbling inarticulately
the while. At last he grew coherent.</p>
<p>'Ah, most sweet lady, slay me if you will; but not with your
frown. I must come to you, even though my head should pay for my
disobedience. If I am to die, better that I should die here in the
bright beams of your presence than out yonder of grief at your
displeasure. For no heart was ever more true to you than mine, no
soul had ever such a perception of your perfections. The fear that
my enemies were leading you to believe me less than the devoted,
loving slave I am, was become anguish unbearable. Here at your
feet, sweet mistress, which is ever the place I seek, here, full of
pain, full of sorrow, I must be importunate of death if your favour
be irrevocable.'</p>
<p>He had well rehearsed it all; and with passion throbbing in his
voice as not for years she had heard it, he stirred her tenderness
for him to its depths. Her anger melted and vanished like snow
under the warmth of those impassioned protests. And when he had
done with words, he was stroking her hands and raining kisses on
them once more, so profoundly moving her that all else was
forgotten, herself, her queenship, her circumstances. She saw only,
and this through a mist of tears, this handsome, stalwart fellow so
humbly the plaintive lover at her feet. She released one of her
hands and set it caressingly on his bowed head. Her fingers toyed
with the fair curls that clustered on his brow, damp from the haste
he had made.</p>
<p>'How shrewdly you plead, Robin,' she murmured on a sigh.</p>
<p>'Truth is shrewd, madam.'</p>
<p>'So, so.' She was very gentle. 'Go rest you now. We will talk
again anon, Robin.'</p>
<p>Fervent lips were pressed to her hand once more. Then,
enheartened, sure of his victory, he went out backwards, her dark
eyes following him fondly, her lips parted in a fond smile.</p>
<p>When he had vanished she fetched a sigh. Absently she beckoned
her tirewomen to their work, and still smiling turned to confront
her mirror. What it showed her recalled her to herself and to the
forgotten moment. She went stiff with horror as she looked at the
sapless old woman there reflected: the ashen, wrinkled face, about
which the thin grey hair hung in wispy rags; the faded eyebrows
which the pencil had not yet revived; the dark teeth behind those
parted lips on which the smile had frozen now into a grin; the
yellow stringy neck; the pursed gullet; the withered breast which
the loose bedgown all too clearly revealed.</p>
<p>And he had seen her thus. Thus! She closed her eyes so as to
shut out that dreadful spectre of senility. But still she saw it,
as he would see it ever now for as long as he had brain to hold a
memory. Henceforth what could she be but loathly to that cherished
lad of less than half her years? Suddenly in a royal rage the blood
leapt scarlet to her cheeks, and glowed there like fire through
ashes.</p>
<p>'Who keeps my door?' she roared. 'The devil damn them! I'll have
the rascals flogged till they bleed. I'll&mdash;' Her anger choked
her. She reeled, sat down abruptly, and plucking at her bedgown
with her fingers&mdash;the fingers of those hands that had survived
the ravage time had made of all the rest of her&mdash;she fell to
mumbling and muttering under the scared eyes of her attendant
women.</p>
<p>It was noon before she came forth to the waiting, wondering,
speculating courtiers who had seen Essex depart so jauntily, and
when she appeared she was more than ordinarily gorgeous. She was in
red brocade with a gold embroidery of lizards. Her stomacher blazed
with diamonds, as did the tall, gold-broidered collar, spread like
a fan to make a background for her face and neck from which paint
and cosmetics had removed a dozen years. Advancing with an unusual
haughtiness in her regal port, she came face to face with her
godson Harington, who had come with Essex and had remained waiting
there. She checked and frowned.</p>
<p>'What! Did the fool bring you, too? Get back to your
business.'</p>
<p>Then as he fell on his knees before her, she stooped and took
him by the girdle, as if she would have pulled him up and flung him
out with her own hands.</p>
<p>'By God's Son, I am no Queen,' she stormed. 'That man is above
me. Who gave him command to come here and bring you with him? Get
you out of my sight. Go home, before I lodge you in the fleet.'</p>
<p>And, says Harington, 'I did not stay to be bidden twice. If all
the Irish rebels had been at my heels, I could not have made better
speed.'</p>
<p>Word of this may have checked the newborn confidence of Essex.
It was extinguished when he sought Her Majesty that evening. The
tender woman of the morning had withdrawn into the stern,
uncompromising queen.</p>
<p>On the morrow he appeared before the Council to face the charges
preferred by Mr. Secretary Cecil of disobedience to Her Majesty in
Ireland, of presumptuous letters to her thence, of making so many
idle knights, of contempt for duty in returning without leave, and
of being overbold in seeking Her Majesty's presence in her
bedchamber.</p>
<p>However inwardly he might rage, prudence urged him to walk
delicately, realizing how insecure was the ground under his
feet.</p>
<p>He answered soberly and civilly, and was told that his words
would be submitted to Her Majesty. Until she should make known her
pleasure he was committed to the charge of the Lord Keeper Egerton
at York House. There he took to his bed&mdash;an old ruse when he
was out of favour&mdash;and wrote an impassioned plea to the Queen,
in the course of which he paraded as usual his weariness of life.
Receiving no answer, he grew worse: at least, he summoned no fewer
than eight doctors to his bedside, and talked of making his will.
By the second week in December he gave out that he was dying, and
in view of this impending dissolution he sent Her Majesty his
patents as Master of the Horse and Master of the Ordnance. As there
was still no sign of melting from the irate but shrewd
Elizabeth&mdash;who had heard him cry 'Wolf!' too often
already&mdash;he had prayers offered up for himself in all the
churches of London, and upon the nineteenth December there was
actually a report of his death, and the bells were tolled for
him.</p>
<p>Seeing that even this did not move her, he resuscitated himself
sufficiently to write to her again, protesting that 'if mine humble
letters find no access, no death could be so speedy as it shall be
welcome to me.'</p>
<p>Her only reply to this was to have him removed to his own house
as a prisoner, and some months later he was yet again writing to
her, this time to explain why he had not died. It had seemed to
him, he said, that he heard Her Majesty's gracious voice commanding
him: 'Die not, Essex; for though I punish thine offence and humble
thee for thy good, yet I will one day be served again by thee.'</p>
<p>From this she might have assumed that she had reached at last
her avowed purpose, which was to teach him to know himself and his
duty to her. But she desired to drive the lesson home. If he had
discovered the decay of the woman, he should discover now, as an
offset, the full vigour and majesty of the Queen. So she had him
brought before the Star Chamber to answer her commissioners on the
charge of treason.</p>
<p>After that she kept him in suspense, let him feel that his fate
was at the mercy of her whim, until following August. Then, at
last, his liberty was restored to him, but with an intimation that
he must not attempt to approach the Queen's person or the Court.
Whilst the torturing memory remained vivid of how he had beheld her
on that morning at Nonsuch Palace she could not bear that his eyes
should rest upon her again. Loving him for himself, she yet hated
him for the vision of her which he must carry in the eyes of his
mind. Torn thus, whilst showing herself bravely gay in public, she
was become in private a woman of sorrows. When after a while the
canker of grief began to eat away her vigour, she sought comfort in
the pleading, dutiful letters she continued to receive from him.
She was softening at last, yielding to her own eagerness to believe
him sincere, when a letter reached her in which he begged for the
renewal of his monopoly of sweet wines, worth to him the enormous
sum of fifty thousand pounds a year, but suspended since the Star
Chamber proceedings. It rent a veil for her. She beheld in it the
reason for all the humility, affection, and dutifulness of the
letters that had been its forerunners. Her heart was hardened once
more. Contemptuously she sent him the answer that when horses
become unmanageable it is necessary to tame them by stinting the
measure of their corn.</p>
<p>Of a reckless extravagance, he was heavily in debt, and this
refusal so enraged him that he threw off his sackcloth and ashes
and at once became his own proud, arrogant, braggart self again.
With characteristic rashness he heaped odious epithets upon the
Queen, to whom a week or two before he had been vowing an eternal
and selfless devotion. Some of his injurious phrases were carried
to her, and one of these&mdash;that 'her conditions were as crooked
as her carcase'&mdash;turned her to stone.</p>
<p>So, that was what he thought of her, the Dian, the Venus, the
Gloriana of better men. Ah, but then he had seen so much more than
they. In her shame and anger she wished him dead, so that the
vision of his mind's eye might perish also, and in this knowledge
give her peace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was not confining his rashness to mere words. He
became active in his hostility. He plotted with James of Scotland
on the subject of the succession. He plotted with malcontents to
whom he threw open his house, and trusting to the popularity he had
always cultivated with the masses, he plotted to seize the Tower
and the palace, so that he might dictate to the Queen and insist
upon the dismissal of those whom he conceived the enemies that
intrigued against him. If this were refused, he would summon a
parliament to correct disorders and redress his wrongs. He would
insist upon justice.</p>
<p>Justice, however, was to be done him without this. Justice was
already on his heels; for the Queen was fully informed of his
plots, down, to the details which had been settled, and he received
a summons to appear before the Privy Council. Instead he took to
arms, and with some three hundred followers as crazy as himself
rode forth into the City with the cry: 'England is sold to Spain by
Cecil and Ralegh. A plot is laid for my life. To arms!'</p>
<p>Finding that, instead of flocking to his banner as he expected,
prudent men disappeared from the streets through which he was
parading, he changed his cry to: 'Citizens of London, arm for the
Queen! For the Queen my mistress! For the Queen!'</p>
<p>But although he shouted himself hoarse and waved his sword till
his arm ached, not a man was mad enough to join him.</p>
<p>In a black rage of disillusion he went back with his desperate
following to fortify himself in Essex House against what he knew
must follow upon this failure. There the arrival of a train of
artillery convinced him of the futility of resistance. After some
parleys, he surrendered at ten o'clock at night to the Lord
Admiral, and he was sent to the Tower.</p>
<p>It was the end of him. Not even the Queen, without doing
violence to the law, could stay his trial, in which ten days
later&mdash;on the ninth February, 1601&mdash;he was convicted of
the high treason of which he was so clearly guilty. But the royal
prerogative of mercy was still hers, and she may have desired
little in life so much as to exercise it in favour of one whom she
had so dearly cherished. All that she asked now was that he should
sue for it. Let him to that extent put aside the pride and
arrogance by which he had so grievously sinned against her, and she
would thankfully grant his prayer.</p>
<p>Waiting she postponed the signing of the warrant for his
execution. As the days passed and no message came from him to
dispel the gloom in which she moved, she took it for a sign that he
had come to loathe her, preferring even death to her favour. It
must be so, or he could never have used those heartless words about
her 'crooked carcase,' the carcase he had seen undight that morning
at Nonsuch Palace. Then mortified shame once more set her
trembling. To extinguish his memory of that, was to go some way
towards extinguishing the thing itself. Let him perish then in his
proud, heartless obduracy. In a gust of passion she signed the
warrant. But, having signed it, swaying again from hate to love,
she postponed execution, still waiting, still hoping.</p>
<p>After all, it was so easy for him. He did not even need to write
or beg. He had her ring and her royal word, given to him in a
tender moment ten years and more ago. Let him but send the ring,
and she must keep the oath she had sworn to restore him to her
favour.</p>
<p>But the days flowed on, and still he made no sign.</p>
<p>Her melancholy deepened, and alternated with interludes of rages
upon the least provocation. She grew careless even of her
appearance, this woman of a hundred wigs and a thousand gowns, who
hitherto had laboured so strenuously to preserve in her externals
some illusion of her vanished youth and of the beauty men had
sung.</p>
<p>Postponed and postponed again, the execution was to take place
on the twenty-fifth February unless she postponed it once more.</p>
<p>Let it go. When the Lieutenant of the Tower should appear to
summon Essex to the scaffold, perhaps he would think better of it,
and on the very brink of death bend his stubborn neck at last. Yes.
It needed that imminence of a doom in which perhaps, trusting to
her erstwhile fondness, he would not let himself believe. Thus,
then, would she subdue him. That should be her victory.</p>
<p>That Ash Wednesday, the twenty-fifth, dawned grey and misty, and
she was afoot with that grey dawn, feverishly awaiting the
messenger she was convinced must come.</p>
<p>The Lady Scroop and two other of her ladies were in attendance,
silently watching her, as she now sat, now stood, now restlessly
paced that very chamber in which a year and half ago he had
surprised her disarray.</p>
<p>Again she beheld him kneeling there, heard his dear pleading
voice, felt his kisses hot upon her hands, saw his eyes upon
her&mdash;upon her 'crooked carcase.'</p>
<p>She shuddered, and with an oath banished the vision, and resumed
her pacing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, at a moment or two after eight o'clock, a dull boom
reverberated on the morning air.</p>
<p>She stood abruptly arrested at the sound. Her lips parted, her
old eyes were wide and scared.</p>
<p>'What was that?'</p>
<p>She had to repeat the question. 'God's death! What was that, I
say?'</p>
<p>Fearful, in tears, the Lady Scroop answered her: 'The Tower gun,
madam.'</p>
<p>'No, no!' The negative broke from her in a scream. She clutched
her heart, and staggered, entangling her feet in the train of her
gown.</p>
<p>Her ladies rushed to her as she sank to the ground in a moaning,
nerveless heap.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT</h2>
<p>On a boisterous afternoon in the spring of 1611, a gentleman
riding from Barnet to London who had lately passed the Gatehouse
Tavern on the heights of Highgate was compelled to draw into the
hedge so as to give passage to an imposing train that was breasting
the southern slope.</p>
<p>There were, in all, five coaches, and to each of the two
foremost of these vast machines of wood and leather four horses
were harnessed. Outriders in plain liveries headed the column; a
body of mounted grooms brought up the rear. With cracking whips and
groaning axles the train came toiling up the hill, past our
gentleman, who conceived that here, if not royalty itself, came at
least some great nobleman on his travels: perhaps the all-powerful
minion Rochester, or perhaps the Secretary Sir William
Cecil&mdash;now my Lord Salisbury&mdash;journeying to Hatfield.</p>
<p>Humanly inquisitive where the great were concerned, our
gentleman grew more attentive as the leading coach came abreast
with him. The leather curtains were close-drawn, but the escutcheon
with a mitre surmounting it that was displayed upon the panel
announced to him the Bishop of Durham. Thereupon his interest was
fading, when it was quickened again to behold upon the panel of the
second coach the royal arms. And there was more than this to give
true cause for wonder. From behind its tight-drawn curtains came
the lamentations of a woman in the last abandonment of grief.
Surprised and affected by the pitiful sound, the arrested horseman
made so bold as presently to ask a question of one of the grooms of
the escort. He was shortly answered that the afflicted traveller
was the Lady Arabella Stuart, on her way, by the King's command, to
Durham in my Lord Bishop's keeping.</p>
<p>'Poor lady!' exclaimed our gentleman, and he added with some
fervour: 'God keep her!'</p>
<p>He continued there, upon his stationary horse, for some little
time after the train had passed him, looking over his shoulder to
follow it with compassionate eyes. As it reached the summit he saw
it swing aside in the direction of the Bank and the fine stately
mansion of Sir William Cornwallis, now tenanted by a Mr. Conyers, a
house that more than once already had afforded shelter to royalty
on its travels. Then he fetched a sigh. 'Poor lady!' he said again,
aloud. On that he touched his horse with the spur, and rode slowly
and thoughtfully down the hill.</p>
<p>The commiseration aroused in him by the Lady Arabella's plight
was shared by every person of sensibility acquainted with her
story. It was the topic of the hour and a fruitful subject for many
a ballad-stringer.</p>
<p>Liberty had been a thing denied her almost from childhood. In
the last eight years, since the accession of King James, its
curtailment had been more rigorous than before. The cages in which
she was kept might be gilded so brightly that they scarcely looked
like cages; but cages they were, and not merely to confine her
slight delicate body, but her very soul as well. And the reason of
it was merely that in her veins ran the royal blood of Henry VII,
and that by virtue of it her claim to the throne was by some deemed
as good as, by others even better than that of King James himself.
It mattered nothing that no desire to urge such claims had place in
the modest dreams of a nature so gently gay and a mind so sweetly
graceful as the Lady Arabella's. Her elegant ambitions were fully
to be expressed by her needle and her pen, and it is greatly to be
doubted if she could ever have been persuaded to barter either for
a sceptre. We certainly know that she had rejected, with as much
scorn as was possible to so amiable a person, the one attempt to
thrust a sceptre upon her.</p>
<p>But that she should have no desire to press her claim did not
weigh with the crapulous, jealous James against the fact that a
claim she had. He could not forget the frights Elizabeth had given
him, when&mdash;with the object of keeping him
subservient&mdash;she had used Arabella as a bogey, threatening to
appoint her to the succession. A shadow sufficed to frighten him,
and like all cowards he was cruel. Moreover, to quicken his
memories and his terrors there had been the conspiracy in which
Brooke, Cobham, Ralegh, and Grey were implicated, which had for its
avowed object to supplant him by this daughter of his father's
brother. And although it was she herself who had discovered the
plot to her royal cousin, by sending him Brooke's letter, yet not
even so clear a proof of loyalty had weighed with James against the
fact that the conspiracy had set its hopes in her.</p>
<p>Gloomily mistrustful, he had marked his gratitude by placing a
further restraint upon her liberties.</p>
<p>She was comely and accomplished and she made friends easily. His
own queen&mdash;to whom, so as to keep her under close
surveillance, she had been appointed maid of honour&mdash;was
deeply attached to her, as were his children. But there were other
attachments against which she must be jealously guarded, and
against none so jealously as those which aimed at marriage. He
shared with Henry VIII and Elizabeth the opinion that those who
were near the crown 'should be narrowly looked into for
marriage.'</p>
<p>Arabella might be as content as she appeared with her
broideries&mdash;in which, like his unfortunate mother, Mary Queen
of Scots, she was exceptionally skilled&mdash;and with her
verse-making in which she excelled, displaying the rare elegancies
of her mind. But a husband might desire her to seek a wider field
for her talents, and awaken ambitions that as yet appeared to
slumber, ambitions which might imperil James and his succession. It
was a danger so remote and shadowy as never to have been perceived
by a prince of any magnanimity. But it so far sufficed for James
that so as to make himself quite safe, he resolved that she must
never marry.</p>
<p>Suitors there had been in plenty, and amongst them such princely
ones as the King of Poland and the Duke of Guelders; but all had
been denied. So long as the suits were merely political in their
character, the Lady Arabella was little fretted or concerned by the
fate that overtook them at the hands of James, nor was she
conscious even of the bonds&mdash;light as gossamer but strong as
steel&mdash;in which her liberties were captive. But there appeared
at length a suitor who was altogether in different case; one who
did not submit himself to royal approbation through the offices of
ambassadors, but came in person, as a lover should, to prostrate
himself before his mistress.</p>
<p>This was the spirited, handsome, flaxen-haired young William
Seymour, the grandson of the Marquis of Hertford. Already Arabella
and he were old friends. They had been playmates ten years ago at
Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire when Seymour, a boy of thirteen, had
visited the place where Arabella had her residence in those days.
She had then conceived a tenderness for the straight-limbed,
flaxen-haired lad, who was ten years her junior. And if the
disparity in their years had been a barrier to his full
reciprocation then, yet now that grown to man's estate he came to
Whitehall, and found her much as he had last seen her at Sheriff
Hutton, the disparity seemed to have vanished. Later in life it
would, of course, appear again. Meanwhile all that he discerned was
that she was desirable, sweet, and gently witty, and that her
tenderness for him shone in her eyes when they rested on his
well-grown comeliness. Love awakening in him in response to the
call of the love he inspired, he declared himself and they were
secretly betrothed.</p>
<p>But for all their circumspection the secret was discovered, and
it threw James into the worst panic he had yet known concerning
her. For just as Arabella was in royal blood but one degree
inferior to James, so was Seymour but one degree inferior to
Arabella. More than that: he descended from Henry VII's younger
daughter; and because Henry VIII had settled the descent, in the
event of failure of his own issue, upon his younger sister Mary
there were some who considered Sir William's claim to the throne a
better one than James's. Now, if the claim of each was in itself
enough to disquiet James, consider how formidable a menace in his
timid eyes must result from the merging of those two claims
together.</p>
<p>The lovers were summoned before the Privy Council, to be
hectored there and chidden like a couple of misbehaving children.
It was pointed out to them that the betrothal of Princes of the
Blood without the consent of their King was an offence but one
degree inferior to the high treason into which their marriage would
convert it. And they were given clearly to understand that only by
a sincere undertaking to submit themselves to the will of His
Gracious Majesty could they avert the punishment incurred.</p>
<p>Sir William stood forward with such dignity as in this
undignified position he could summon to make answer that no other
intention had ever been theirs.</p>
<p>'When I so boldly intruded myself into her ladyship's chamber on
Candlemas Day, and she graciously entertained my hopes, yet it was
with the caution that we should not proceed to any final conclusion
without His Majesty's most gracious favour first obtained.'</p>
<p>'Which but serves to show,' he was answered by the Secretary
Cecil, 'that you were full conscious of your offence.'</p>
<p>'By your lordship's leave, not of offence,' the young man
defended himself. 'I conceived that this noble lady might, without
offence, make choice of any subject within this kingdom. And what
more am I?&mdash;a younger brother, unknown to the world, of mean
estate, not born to challenge anything by my birthright.'</p>
<p>The plea, and its sincerity, disposed the Council to deal
leniently, and the far-sighted Cecil would be very far from wishing
to arouse for them the sympathy that might follow upon persecution.
But it was only upon their promise not to push this matter further,
or to seek to marry without the King's consent, that they received
their pardon and liberty to depart.</p>
<p>How far their grave undertaking may have been sincere when given
no man can say. But sincere or not, the sequel need not be
surprising. Imperious love is not to be harnessed or constrained.
Nor can privy councils prevail against the privier counsels of
Cupid. The promise uttered under stress in February was broken
beyond remedy in the following July.</p>
<p>The lovers, although closely watched&mdash;for James was not the
man to trust to promises&mdash;yet contrived to make opportunities
for secret meetings, wherein each might ease by a little the pain
of their separation. And then, because love like hate grows by what
it feeds on, the situation becoming intolerable to both, and also
because the lady's character had somewhat suffered from the gossip
that had followed that business of the Privy Council, they mutually
resolved to choose the lesser evil and risk the King's displeasure.
They argued, as other lovers similarly placed have argued, that
once the thing were done beyond recall, it would have to be
condoned. There would be storms, of course; there would be
censures; and the disgrace and banishment of both from Court would
no doubt follow. But of what account could be such things as these
when weighed in the balance against their longings?</p>
<p>And so one clear summer's midnight when the Court was at
Greenwich, all being prepared, Sir William slipped out of the town
unobserved by any spies and made his way on foot to the palace.
Admitted secretly by those whose sympathies he had enlisted and
whose scruples he had bribed, he was received by Crompton, the Lady
Arabella's chamberlain, and by him conducted to the apartments of
the maid of honour.</p>
<p>He was ushered into a panelled room, faintly lighted by the
tapers in a candlebranch that stood near a bowl of roses whose
perfume hung upon the air like an emanation of her ladyship's own
sweet spirit. Here by the table stood the Lady Arabella all in
bridal white. Behind her were Mrs. Bradshaw, her waiting woman, and
three other confidential servants, together with an elderly man in
the black garments and white bands that announced the cleric.</p>
<p>Sir William cast his muffling cloak, and sped forward to do
homage on the knee to his lady. Pale, and trembling a little,
between delight and fear, she raised him up and beckoned the parson
forward to do his office.</p>
<p>As the first pale sheen of the early summer dawn glimmered on
the river's face, the furtive bridegroom slipped out of the palace
as unobserved as he had come, and sped back to his Greenwich
lodging, no whit perturbed by the thought that the lovely thing he
had done was at law accounted treason.</p>
<p>In the weeks that followed the happiness of the twain lay in the
knowledge rather than in the fact that they possessed each other.
Their meetings were few and fleeting, and ever were there prying
eyes to watch them and report. And then, at length, the secret that
they were man and wife began to stir about the Court. It reached
the King and threw him into a rage&mdash;the hideous rage that has
its roots in fear. He ordered their arrest.</p>
<p>Seymour, for his contempt in marrying a lady of the royal family
without the leave of the King, was taken to the Tower. The Lady
Arabella was consigned into the keeping of Sir Thomas Parry at
Lambeth.</p>
<p>At first they bore their duress with equanimity and without real
apprehension. That which had happened was no more than they had
known must happen as a prelude to their united happiness. King
James could not forever hold them captive for no worse offence than
theirs. Public opinion, after all, was not utterly to be flouted
even by one who ruled by divine right. And since what was done
could not be undone by any power on earth, His Majesty must
presently accept the fact and punish it by nothing worse than
banishment, which would be far from difficult to bear.</p>
<p>But they did not know King James, or else they must have argued
otherwise. And because others did not know him, and therefore
thought as they did, there were not wanting those who did what
little it lay in their power to do so as to mitigate the lovers'
present pain of separation. Sir Thomas Parry proved the kindliest
and most considerate of gaolers. He treated the Lady Arabella as an
honoured guest, and averted his eyes at awkward moments lest he
should surprise evidence of the correspondence her ladyship was
secretly conducting with the prisoner in the Tower.</p>
<p>One of those letters survives in which occurs the phrase:
'Wheresoever you be or in what state soever you are, it sufficeth
me you are mine.' She has heard that he is not well, and she urges
him: 'For God's sake let not your grief of mind work upon your
body.' And she closes on a note of gentle wifely submission: 'I do
assure you nothing the State can do with me can trouble me so much
as this news of your being ill doth; and you see when I am
troubled, I trouble you too with tedious kindness; for so I think
you will acount so long a letter, yourself not having written to me
this good while so much as how you do. But, sweet sir, I speak not
this to trouble you with writing but when you please. Be well, and
I shall account myself happy in being&mdash;your faithful loving
wife.'</p>
<p>Nor were love letters, of which this is an ensample, the only
letters from her fluent pen in those wintry days at Lambeth. She
wrote repeatedly to the King, asserting her cause with a firm and
noble dignity.</p>
<p>'If,' she says in one of these letters, 'it were now as
convenient in a worldly respect as malice make it seem, to separate
us, whom God hath joined, Your Majesty would not do evil that good
might come thereof, nor make me, that have the honour to be so near
Your Majesty in blood, the first precedent that ever was, though
our princes may have left some as little imitable, for so good and
gracious a king as Your Majesty, as David's dealing with
Uriah.'</p>
<p>But the good and gracious King was not to be moved to
compassion. The good and gracious King was over-scared on his own
behalf. He was as unmoved by Arabella's eloquent petitions as by
the entreaties of his queen or the representations of the Prince of
Wales and the Princess Elizabeth on behalf of their sweet friend
and cousin. To all, the tyrant's unvarying answer was:</p>
<p>'She hath eaten of the forbidden tree.'</p>
<p>Yet the hopes of all concerned, though languishing, did not
perish until it was shown how foolishly generous had been the
judgment of the King which imagined that he would deal
magnanimously in the end, once his anger had been given time to
cool.</p>
<p>One of her fond letters to her husband was intercepted,
revealing in itself the extent of their correspondence. The fact
that they could conduct it in spite of their imprisonment showed
James how numerous and ready were their friends and sympathisers,
and cast him into deeper panic and more cruel anger than before.
You conceive how soundly Sir Thomas Parry was rated for his
carelessness and what censures were heaped upon the Lieutenant of
the Tower. Nor was this all. His Majesty determined upon measures
that should be more effective. William James, the Bishop of Durham,
was on the point of setting out for his see in the far North.
Thither with him should go the Lady Arabella, thus rendering her
separation from her husband, and from all who might be moved to
importune His Majesty on her behalf, more complete and
absolute.</p>
<p>The announcement bereft her of her last tenacious hope of
clemency. Its execution plunged her into a despair so utter and so
frenzied that the sounds of her anguish assailed the ears of those
who passed her coach as it was proceeding to Highgate&mdash;on the
first stage of that northward journey. Because of the condition to
which this wild grief had reduced her, the physician travelling
with the train did not deem it prudent that she should go farther
for the present. He announced this opinion to my Lord Bishop, and
the latter, a gentle old man of seventy who himself had been three
times married, must have agreed that his charge was being made to
suffer overmuch for the sin of having married once. He took it upon
himself to pause at the Highgate mansion until the King should be
advised of her state, and to this end he dispatched the physician
to Whitehall.</p>
<p>James heard the tale of her prostrate condition and dull
irregular pulse, betokening the exhaustion that had succeeded her
active anguish. He combed the thin beard about his loose mouth as
he made answer:</p>
<p>'She maun gang till Durham if I am King.'</p>
<p>The physician bowed gravely. He knew the ways of courts.</p>
<p>'We make no doubt of her obedience, sire,' said he.</p>
<p>His Majesty delivered himself oracularly: 'Obedience is that
required which being performed, I will do more for her than she
expecteth.'</p>
<p>But he, nevertheless, consented that she should remain for a
month at Highgate, in confinement, to mend her health and fit her
to resume her journey. Highgate was famous for its salutary air.
Norden, some twenty years before in his <i>Survey of Middlesex</i>,
had praised its health-giving qualities for those who have been
'visited with sickness not curable by physick.' The Lady Arabella
was singularly within this description.</p>
<p>The physician returned to the house of Mr. Conyers with news of
the respite gained. It revived a spark among the ashes of Lady
Arabella's hopes. She was blessed with faithful friends who had
urged her cause, and who would continue to urge it; and perhaps in
the course of this precious month they might succeed in softening
the monarch's stony heart.</p>
<p>One of these friends, the best and staunchest perhaps of all,
her aunt the Countess of Shrewsbury descended upon her at Highgate
on the second day of her confinement there.</p>
<p>She found her niece taking the air on an improvised couch that
had been set for her in the April sunshine. From the eminence of
that fair garden there was a clear view of the city of London and
its neighbourhood, from Westminster on the far right to Greenwich
on the farther left; whilst southward, beyond the silvery Thames,
the eye might range over the Surrey hills to the hazy horizon. It
is doubtful if of all this fair prospect spread before her under
the cloudless sky of that day of early spring, my lady saw more
than the white turrets of the grim fortress that held her lover,
who in name already was her husband.</p>
<p>'Child!' cried the Countess, shocked by the woebegone
countenance of her niece. 'How pale you are!' She folded the slight
figure to her ample bosom, and in that embrace both ladies shed
some tears.</p>
<p>In the background, Mr. Conyers&mdash;a gentleman of
sensibility&mdash;considerately removed himself, taking the
physician with him. The Countess watched him out of sight.</p>
<p>'Come now,' she said. 'You must be of better cheer. This respite
shall be turned to good account. Lord! What a mercy it is that you
took ill before the Bishop had you in the wilds of Durham!'</p>
<p>'You mean, madam, to employ the time in moving His Majesty to
clemency?'</p>
<p>The Countess sniffed her scorn. 'Move Jamie to clemency! The
only way to move his sowship to anything to which he is not
naturally disposed is the way thought of by Guy Fawkes&mdash;with
gunpowder. Nay, now; we'll better employ the time in trusting to
our own endeavours.'</p>
<p>The gentle sad eyes looked up to ask a question. Lady Shrewsbury
answered it.</p>
<p>'We must contrive to get you out of Jamie's claws&mdash;both you
and Seymour&mdash;and ship you off to France.'</p>
<p>The colour leapt to the pale cheeks; alarm and eagerness were
blended in the tender eyes.</p>
<p>'Oh, madam! Oh, but how? I fear it is impossible.'</p>
<p>'Impossible? When I am in it The scornful quality of her
ladyship's confidence had an inspiriting sound. 'The means are yet
to be contrived. But I'll contrive them, never doubt me.'</p>
<p>'And the consequences to your ladyship?'</p>
<p>'Consequences? Ha!' Her scorn assumed a sharper note, her
confidence a firmer ring. 'Why, Jamie'll squeal and slobber, to be
sure, and be more foul-mouthed than ever; but that won't daunt me.
It needs more than Jamie Stuart's tantrums to daunton Mary
Shrewsbury&mdash;the Lord be praised! Your sweet Seymour doesn't
want for friends, and amongst them they'll bring him safely out of
the Tower when the time is ripe. And as for money, that shall be my
care. Meanwhile, child, it will be for you to lull their vigilance
here by aping resignation. Let it be gradual, of course. That's all
I ask of you now. In what's to follow I'll instruct you later.'</p>
<p>The Lady Arabella clasped her hands, and looked up at her aunt
with eyes aswim in tears.</p>
<p>'Oh, madam, you bring me such hope as I had never thought to
know again. I have no thanks for so much loving kindness.'</p>
<p>'Which is as well,' said the Countess dryly, 'for here come your
gaolers back again, and my Lord Bishop with them.' She raised her
voice so that it might carry to their ears. 'And I do enjoin you,
child: do not let the unquiet of your spirit heap indisposition on
your body. Remember and take comfort in His Majesty's gracious
promise to do more for you than you expect so that you are
obedient.'</p>
<p>'Ah, there's sound advice for your ladyship!' was the
approaching Bishop's unctuous commendation. He moved forward with a
gravity of tone and manner that matched his sedate and portly
person.</p>
<p>The Lady Arabella turned to answer him. 'I so little doubt it,
sir, that I mean to follow it. Therein, indeed, lies my only hope.
I thank you, madam, from my heart for the comfort you have brought
me in my affliction, and for the confidence you give me in His
Majesty's clemency. It shall be my study to deserve it.'</p>
<p>The bishop, poor man, misunderstood the twinkle in Lady
Shrewsbury's eyes as she replied: 'My faith! That is the proper
spirit to display.'</p>
<p>In conducting the great lady presently to her coach&mdash;'I
vow,' said he, 'that your ladyship has wrought a miracle.'</p>
<p>'It is nothing to the miracle I shall work before all's done. I
shall probably surprise you.' She laughed, enjoying a jest in which
he had no part. 'I shall come soon again.'</p>
<p>'We shall all be grateful, madam. None could be more welcome.
Your ladyship's wisdom should bring solace to that afflicted
child.'</p>
<p>'Solace is what I intend, my lord,' said she, and left him
wondering was there a flash of irony in her parting smile.</p>
<p>She came again before the week was out, and very frequently
thereafter as the month wore on. But their plans, meanwhile, were
far from mature enough to warrant action. Thus anxiety came
creeping back to cloud again the hopes that had run high. These
clouds, her ladyship's ready wit dispelled. Arabella's affected
resignation and submission to the royal will had been duly reported
to His Majesty. Because of this he lent an ear to my Lady
Shrewsbury's plea that his cousin be allowed to remain for yet
another month at Highgate with Mr. Conyers, since her health was
gathering such signal benefit from its salubrious air.</p>
<p>Even that second month was drawing to an end before all their
dispositions had been completed. Already it was settled that on
Tuesday the fifth June the Lady Arabella should resume at last her
journey to the North, and the Bishop set out ahead on the Saturday,
so as to make all ready for the reception of his charge.</p>
<p>Within an hour of his departure the Countess came to pay her
farewell visit to her niece. She brought with her on this occasion
a man in the plain garb of an unliveried servant. He followed her
to the Lady Arabella's room bearing a bundle that
contained&mdash;so her ladyship announced&mdash;some trifling
parting gifts of clothes. In the few moments during which they were
alone, the Countess presented her companion.</p>
<p>'This is our good friend Mr. Markham. You will take him into
your service in the place of Crompton, who, together with your maid
Bradshaw, since they no longer desire to be removed from London,
shall go back with me in my coach.' Steps were approaching. The
Countess dropped her voice, and added hurriedly: 'Markham will
instruct you and escort you. All is ready. The ship is waiting for
you at the Nore. It is for Monday. Sh!'</p>
<p>Mrs. Conyers came into the room. She curtsied deeply to the
Countess, then sympathetically commended her charge:</p>
<p>'She bears up bravely, poor lady. But then the separation will
not be for long. All will come right at the last.'</p>
<p>'Ah! Who can say?' quoth the Countess dramatically, whereupon
the Lady Arabella incontinently burst into tears.</p>
<p>It was an entirely unrehearsed effect. It had needed but a word
to release the pent-up emotion of that anxious surcharged heart,
and by accident the word had been supplied. With compassion in her
face, Mrs. Conyers ran to comfort this troubled lady, who had the
power to inspire affection in all who approached her. The subtle
Countess was quick to see here a chance to overcome the worst
barrier to the escape. Promptly she took it.</p>
<p>'It is the thought of going so far from her husband without so
much as a word of farewell that is her present grief.'</p>
<p>'Poor lady! Poor dear lady!' murmured Mrs. Conyers, visibly
affected.</p>
<p>'If only that little crumb of comfort were accorded her, she
would bear her cross with fortitude, I know. And it is so
easy&mdash;and such a little thing!' her ladyship sighed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Conyers looked up: 'How?' she asked, between surprise and
concern.</p>
<p>'Why should she not go in secret to see him at the Tower on
Monday?'</p>
<p>'God save us!' ejaculated Mrs. Conyers.</p>
<p>'Why, what's to fear? None need ever know, and if it would bring
comfort to her and to him...' She spread her hands, leaving the
sentence unfinished.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Conyers was profoundly shocked. It would be treason,
surely.'</p>
<p>'Treason? Such a little thing! Tchah! If it were treason be sure
you'ld not find me as eager to commit it as I am.'</p>
<p>Here was an argument of some weight to ally the major fears of
Mrs. Conyers. She stood now mumchance, balancing between compassion
and her sense of duty. The Countess shrewdly observed her.</p>
<p>'Short of this treason you have mentioned there's nothing I
wouldn't do to help her to her parting kiss, poor child. But
there...God help me! Alone I cannot procure her that harmless
blessing.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Conyers displayed her growing weakness in the desire to
know more as to how this blessing could be procured. And almost
before she knew it she had been persuaded by the Countess to give
the Lady Arabella the opportunity to take that last farewell. A
victim at once of her own merciful heart and Lady Shrewsbury's
guile, that opportunity Mrs. Conyers afforded.</p>
<p>For the rest, the vigilance relaxed as no longer necessary in
view of the Lady Arabella's resignation made things easy.</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon between three and four o'clock two men
stepped unobserved from a side door of the High-. gate mansion, and
turning their faces to the south, walked briskly away and down the
hill in the direction of Saint Pancras. One of these was a
well-set-up man very plainly dressed, but armed and booted. This
was Mr. Markham. The other was a mere stripling, delicately built
and standing no higher than Mr. Markham's shoulder; he was wrapped
in a black cloak thrust up behind by the tilt of his rapier; he
wore russet thigh-boots with red tops, and a broad-brimmed hat with
a trailing feather. Under the hat flowed the ringlets of a full
black wig that framed the delicate oval face of the Lady
Arabella.</p>
<p>She stepped out manfully beside her companion, repressing the
alarm that kept her heart fluttering in her throat to hamper her
breathing, and the fatigue that from walking briskly in this state
soon began to gain upon her. By the time they had covered a
distance of a mile and a half, and come to an inn, where her
faithful lackey Crompton was awaiting her with horses, she was on
the point of sinking from exhaustion. But a pause here was
unthinkable. At any moment her flight from Highgate might be
discovered, Mrs. Conyers notwithstanding, and bring pursuers on
their heels. She staggered forward as the horses were brought out.
But when the ostler held the stirrup for her, she sank against the
nag as if without strength to mount.</p>
<p>'Why, what ails you, sir?' quoth the ostler in concern.</p>
<p>She made a supreme effort. 'Nothing,' she answered shortly and
hoarsely so as to dissemble her voice. She stood forth again, and
this time got her foot to the stirrup. But it required a vigorous
heave from the lusty young ostler to lift her to the saddle. He
turned to her companions, shaking his head.</p>
<p>'I doubt the young gentleman will hardly hold out to London,' he
warned them.</p>
<p>Their short vague answers conveyed they did not share his
apprehension; and on that they rode off with the false young
gentleman between them. As they went Crompton supplied her with the
medicine she most needed and the lack of which was as responsible
as anything for her weakness&mdash;news of Mr. Seymour.</p>
<p>'All goes well,' he told her. 'A cart went to the Tower this
noon with firewood for Sir William's apartments. Under the billets
there's a lout's suit with a black wig and black whiskers. Mr.
Rodney's servants are the carters, and they'll bring Sir William
away in the cart like one of themselves. To help matters Sir
William has given out that he is sick and keeps his bed. On that
pretext his servant will deny admission to anyone who should seek
him there today. Mr. Rodney is in waiting at Tower wharf with a
boat in which to carry Sir William to Lee where the French ship
lies. Another boat stays for your ladyship at Blackwall. Mrs.
Bradshaw is there with your luggage and Sir William's. So courage,
my lady! You'll be on your way to France together before
morning.'</p>
<p>Be it the news or be it the brisk pace of the horses, the colour
returned now to her ladyship's cheeks and the sparkle to her eyes.
They rode so well that by six o'clock they were at the Blackwall
tavern, where Mrs. Bradshaw and a chambermaid awaited them,
together with a servant of Mr. Rodney's. News of Sir William,
however, there Was none. But since this was not altogether expected
her ladyship did not permit herself to be troubled. In a room of
the tavern she rid herself of her male attire and with the
assistance of Mrs. Bradshaw resumed her proper habit. Then,
muffling her face in a veil, she came forth to the waiting boat.
She took leave of Mr. Markham, very gratefully, and then
accompanied by Crompton and Mrs. Bradshaw got aboard, and started
in the dusk of that summer evening for the Nore.</p>
<p>It was, of course, an anxious journey; and its inevitable
anxieties were heightened by delays. First the watermen were for
landing at Greenwich; but upon being bribed they consented to pull
on to Lee. Yet at Tilbury again they called a halt, this time from
very weariness. They would go no farther until they had refreshed
themselves. Insistence was vain, and so the fugitives were forced
to wait with what patience they could whilst the oars were drinking
ashore.</p>
<p>Day was breaking when at last they got to Lee, and in the grey
morning light they made out a ship at anchor a mile beyond them,
which Crompton pronounced at once the French barque that had been
hired. They boarded her, and Crompton was confirmed by the master,
a sturdy bow-legged fellow who rolled forward hat in hand to pay
his homage to her ladyship.</p>
<p>She leaned against the shallow taffrail, panting in her
excitement, and marvelling that no one else came to receive her.
Her feverish glance swept the ship's deck from poop to prow.</p>
<p>'But Sir William?' Breathlessly she got out the question. 'Where
is he?'</p>
<p>'Milor', 'e 'ave not yet arrive', madame.'</p>
<p>'Not yet arrived?' Her voice was husky with sudden fear. 'Not
yet arrived?' She reeled, and but for Crompton's steadying arm she
might have fallen.</p>
<p>The French shipmaster talked volubly. Milord was late. Madame
herself had been late. He had been kept waiting already longer than
was safe. He explained at length his obvious grounds for
apprehension, and his reluctance to stay a minute longer. Yet he
would take some risk for her nobility. He would wait yet a
half-hour&mdash;until sunrise. And whether Sir William Seymour
should have come by then or not he would be compelled for his own
safety's sake as well as hers to put to sea.</p>
<p>You conceive the horror of that half-hour following upon the
strain of that anxious night and all the anguish that already this
poor lady had been called upon to bear. It sped away on the swift
wings of time, and still Sir William had not come. The bo'sun's
pipe summoned the men to the windlass; the anchor was heaved to the
cat-heads, and with creak of blocks the brown sails were hoisted.
The wind was freshening against the tide, and the waves were
running high.</p>
<p>It was in vain that the Lady Arabella pleaded for delay. The
master dared not stay and did not fear to say so. Crompton agreed
with him that it was dangerous, and strove hard to comfort her. He
argued that even if Sir William had failed to win free she must not
linger now. But he did not believe that Sir William could have
failed. He must have been delayed. No doubt but he would follow
presently, and finding that the barque had sailed without him, he
would hire another vessel. He was well supplied with means. He
would rejoin her within a day or two at Calais. Let her set her
doubts at rest. Thus Crompton.</p>
<p>She strove to believe him, as she stood there on the canting
deck, and watched the receding land grow ghostly and melt away in
the morning mist. Had it but been clearer her romance might have
ended differently. For within a quarter of an hour of their
barque's setting sail, Sir William Seymour's boat came surging
through the whipped-up water almost to the very spot where the
French barque had ridden at anchor. His delay had been in leaving
the Tower. The cart of firewood had been late in coming. Yet once
it had arrived there had been no hitch. Dressed in a tawny, yokel's
suit, with a black wig over his yellow hair and a false black beard
to muffle his face, the young gentleman had walked boldly at the
cart's tail out of the Western entrance. Thence he had proceeded by
Tower Wharf, by the warders of the South Gate, and so to the Iron
Gate, where Rodney waited with his oars.</p>
<p>It was from another French barque riding near at hand that Sir
William learned that he came just too late, and that his lady was
already on her way to France. If it vexed him, yet his vexation was
as naught to that of the Lady Arabella. He knew the worst, and his
case was by no means hopeless, provided that he could find a ship
in which to follow. But she, poor soul, was tormented by imaginings
of what might have befallen him.</p>
<p>He boarded a collier, and bargained with her master to carry him
over to France for the sum of forty pounds. They set sail. Wind and
weather drove the little vessel so far north that at last she was
forced to put in to Ostend. There Sir William landed, and set out
eagerly thence to search his bride along the coast. He searched in
vain.</p>
<p>The master of the barque that carried Arabella had been
justified of his impatience at the delay in sailing. Her flight had
been discovered late on Monday by Mr. Conyers, and in terror of the
consequences to himself, he had ridden hard to London and my Lord
Salisbury with the news. Too late the Secretary sent orders to the
Tower to set a straight guard over Sir William Seymour, for Sir
William was gone already; but not too late were his simultaneous
orders to the Admiral of the Narrow Seas. A fast pinnace lying in
the Downs put out at once, and coming up with the Frenchman
half-channel over, signalled him to lie to.</p>
<p>But the little bow-legged master proved as resolute now as
earlier, and held to his course. Not until the pinnace had fired
thirteen shots across his decks did he strike his colours, and
surrender the Lady Arabella to those who came to lead her back to
the captivity imposed upon her out of fear by a craven tyrant
because she had 'eaten the fruit of the forbidden tree.'</p>
<p>This time she was sent to the Tower, and deprived of even the
company of her devoted servants, robbed of all hope of happiness in
this life. The only balm Fate left her for her broken heart was the
knowledge that her husband, who never now would be husband to her
in more than name, was at least safe in exile from the
pusillanimous cruelty of Jamie Stuart. For four years she endured
this last and cruelest captivity. Then Death delivered her.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER</h2>
<p>A large, fair man in russet velvet, jewelled like a courtier,
booted and spurred like a soldier, his right hand on the hilt of
his sword, his left on a mullion of the window, the Duke of Guise,
Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom and Grand-Master of the King's
Household, stood a little in the background, like a symbol of the
force to be employed should the persuasions of his priestly brother
fail. His aquiline face, disfigured by the scar of the terrible
wound taken at the siege of Calais, in the course of a campaign
which had made him the idol of the soldiery, remained impassive;
but his watchful eyes never left the countenance of the
Queen-Mother whilst his brother was addressing her.</p>
<p>The Cardinal of Lorraine, nobly handsome of face, engaging of
manner, and insinuating of tone, a man using high intellectual
gifts to further a remorseless ambition, was mellifluously veiling
threats in terms of deepest solicitude. No lover could more gently
have remonstrated with his mistress than he with the
Queen-Mother.</p>
<p>'We implore you, madame, with no interest but your own before
our eyes, out of the love we bear you, to give no heed to any
proposals that may reach you from these unhappy men of the new
religion.'</p>
<p>Catherine de Medicis interrupted him without heat. Her tone was
as phlegmatic as her aspect.</p>
<p>'You preach, sir, to the converted. Could I so neglect my duty
as a true daughter of the Church as to suffer myself to be
approached by men whose impiety fills me with horror? Sometimes I
think that you forget that I am a Pope's niece. Be sure that I do
not.'</p>
<p>The Cardinal's glance sharpened. Was she thus&mdash;alluding to
powers which she might invoke&mdash;emulating his own subtlety, and
giving him back covert threat for covert threat? Her prominent,
myopic brown eyes met his own with a baffling candour. He inclined
his head a little.</p>
<p>'Your Majesty reassures us. I am relieved of my fears for
you.'</p>
<p>'Fears for me?'</p>
<p>He spread his elegant hands. 'Your own piety will show you where
you might stand if even a suspicion should touch you of trafficking
with these heretics.' His tone deeped in slyness. 'In Your
Majesty's own interest&mdash;so as to abstract you from the danger
of public execration&mdash;we might be constrained to advise your
return to Florence: a calamity even greater for us who esteem you
so highly than for Your Majesty's own self.'</p>
<p>Immobile, bolt upright in her tall chair, this woman, the depth
of whose craft stood to his as the depth of a well to that of a
goblet, gave no sign that she was conscious of the steel under the
velvet in which he muffled it. Her heavy-lidded eyes turned slowly
from one to the other of the brothers who so despotically wielded
the power they had usurped. The sleepiness of her glance was
pierced by no gleam of the rage within her. She even permitted
herself one of her eternal yawns. Her voice droned lazily.</p>
<p>'It is a calamity you have no cause to apprehend.' And upon that
she dismissed them, to go ask each other if there might be a hidden
meaning in her words as there had certainly been in theirs.</p>
<p>Alone in her cabinet, her figure lost its stiff uprightness. Her
body, which now in her fortieth year, as a result of continuous
child-bearing and gluttonous habits, had reached, as Brantôme tells
us, a rich embonpoint, sagged together; and her hands, which the
same witness declares to have been of an unparalleled loveliness,
clenched the arms of her chair as fiercely as\if they had been the
throats of those gentlemen of the House of Guise. Despite her high
courage, her soul was sick within her. The ability within herself,
which she never doubted, seemed doomed to frustration by the
trammels which the Cardinal of Lorraine and his brother imposed
upon her. She was little better than a prisoner in their hands.
Their spies observed her every moment. Queen-Mother of France, she
was hobbled like a cow.</p>
<p>Sitting there now with the memory of the veiled threats of that
interview, she felt herself almost at the end of her patience, the
terrible patience with which for a quarter of a century, in the
shadow, neglected and almost despised, she had awaited
opportunity.</p>
<p>She had thought that it had come a year ago, in July of 1559,
when the King, her husband, had been cut off by a death-wound
accidentally taken in the tilt-yard. It is not easy to believe in
the sincerity of the overwhelming grief by which the event
prostrated her, or of the mourning she was to wear to the end of
her days. For even in that fatal tourney, Henri II rode his courses
in the black and white that were the colours of Diane de Poitiers,
the mistress who had been the real queen, the woman who swayed
policy and to whom court was paid by all, whilst in the background
Catherine de Medicis merely bore the King's children. She had borne
him ten in all, of whom seven survived, and if as a wife she was
without authority, at least as a mother her empire had been
absolute. It was upon this that she had counted in the hour of
Henri's death. Her son François, who was then sixteen and had for a
year been married to Mary Stuart, was no longer a minor&mdash;the
Kings of France attained their majority at the age of
fourteen&mdash;and therefore there could be no question of a
regency. But of her power and skill to rule and guide him, and
through him the kingdom, she had no doubt. At last she would be
something more than a queen in name only, and the world should be
made conscious of the ability with which she knew herself
endowed.</p>
<p>Her eagerness made her cut short the period of seclusion
prescribed in France for a widowed queen. She hastened from Paris
to François at Saint Germain so as to be at her son's side. But
despite this haste, which might have rendered her vulnerable to
criticism, already she came too late. The feeble-minded, sickly
boy, completely under the spell of the adorable Mary Stuart, had
already surrendered at her bidding the helm of state to her uncles
the masterful Guises.</p>
<p>That this was a check to her aspirations Catherine at once
perceived, but not yet the extent of it. She did not yet suspect
that secret ambition of these Lorrainers to possess themselves
ultimately of the very throne of France, on the grounds of their
descent from Charlemagne.</p>
<p>Their power was firmly planted in the fertile soil of religious
strife which the Reformation had produced. By assuming the
leadership of the Catholic party, the Guises assured for their
following a majority which, properly handled, should steadily grow
until nothing could stand against their might. The Duke by his
military talents had won the worship of the soldiery; the Cardinal
of Lorraine educated public opinion through the monastic orders
that were spread over the face of France. He was blindly obeyed, by
men who perceived nothing of his ambitious designs for his house,
and believed him concerned only for the greater honour and glory of
God.</p>
<p>Catherine, whilst overawed by the strength in which she found
them established, was partly deceived by the protestations of duty
with which they received her, and at first, in her loneliness and
lack of a party of her own, she was glad enough to lean upon them.
They won her confidence by supporting her demands for the
comparative banishment of Diane de Poitiers and the restitution by
the late King's mistress of the crown jewels and the rest of the
plunder in her hands. In return she had supported them in procuring
the dismissal from office, on the score of his years, of the
powerful Constable, Anne de Montmorency, and in the assumption by
the Duke of Guise of the vacated Grand-Mastership of the King's
Household.</p>
<p>Disillusion followed quickly. Her authority with her son sapped
by the Guises through their pliant and dutiful niece, she found
herself relegated once more to the background from which she had
begun to emerge. The Guises treated her, in the nothingness to
which they doomed her, with a courteous pretence of deference that
was a bitter mockery. She was again, as in the late King's
lifetime, merely the woman who had borne the royal children; and
into such contempt was she fallen that the sixteen-yearsold Mary
Stuart, Queen of France and Scotland, and accounting herself also
Queen of England, did not hesitate sneeringly to allude to her
mother-in-law as the Florentine merchant's daughter whose marriage
into the royal house of France had constituted a
<i>mésalliance</i>. Even Catherine's compatriot, the Duchess of
Guise, a daughter of the House of Este, made her feel that she was
looked down upon as an upstart.</p>
<p>A lesser woman might have ruined herself by open revolt against
these indignities, might have flung herself into reckless
reprisals, which must completely have delivered her into the hands
of those who to their own profit denied her all her rights. But
Catherine, with that inexhaustible patience which is the stamp of
genius, waited, sluggish and phlegmatic of aspect, in her funereal
apparel relieved only by the ermine collar, and in her peaked cap
covering the hair which, from golden that it once had been, was
turning coppery with the years. Thus she moved, chill-eyed and ever
yawning, a woman resigned to her negligible rôle of
Queen-Mother.</p>
<p>But within that seemingly sleepy corpulence, her mind remained
vigorously active. In casting about her for a weapon against those
of her own faith by whom she was oppressed, she was beset by the
temptation to employ the powerful Protestant party. She perceived
how she might create just such a situation as would naturally have
arisen if the degenerate, sickly son to whose uxoriousness she owed
her present humiliation had not been of age.</p>
<p>The way had been paved for her by the revolting cruelty of the
wholesale execution of Huguenots after the march on Amboise by La
Renaudie and his following of armed Reformers. The Duke of Guise,
who had prevailed upon the King to create him Lieutenant-General of
the Kingdom, had so abused the powers of that exalted office in his
ferocious anxiety to strike terror into all opponents, that he had
not only hardened Huguenot hostility, but had lost the adherence of
those Catholics who were clear-sighted enough to perceive that
these Lorrainers employed religion as an instrument for their own
worldly advancement.</p>
<p>Shrewdly espying her opportunity, Catherine had gone stealthily
to work through some few who out of hostility to the Guises were
willing enough to act as her agents.</p>
<p>A rumour was already abroad to the effect that the young King,
who actually was suffering from eczema, had been attacked by
leprosy. Logically out of this, as it seemed, came a sudden clamour
for a convocation of the States General, to the end that, owing to
the ill-health and feeble-mindedness of the King, a regency should
be appointed.</p>
<p>The demand startled the Guises, representing as it did an attack
upon a flank on which they were vulnerable. By the law of France
regency was permissible to none but Princes of the Blood, which,
for all their boasted descent from Charlemagne, the Guises were
not. Indeed, they were scarcely looked upon as French, Lorraine
being a fief of the German Empire. If the clamour prevailed and the
Estates supported the demand, the choice of a regent must fall upon
Antoine de Bourbon, the elder of the Bourbon Princes and King of
Navarre, who, being of the reformed religion, was the natural head
of the Huguenot party and therefore the natural opponent of the
Guisards.</p>
<p>None suspected that the clamour had been inspired by the
Queen-Mother, but to discover its source the Cardinal's network of
monkish spies grew active. It transpired that amongst those who had
stirred up the trouble were one or two whose relations with the
Queen-Mother made it possible that they might have been acting with
her consent. Now the Guises well knew that as the mother of the
King, Catherine was not as negligible in the eyes of the country as
in those of the court, and consequently that if she were to declare
herself on the side of their opponents, the difficulties of the
situation might not so easily be met.</p>
<p>Hence that probing interview to which they had subjected her,
culminating in the covert threat of banishment should they discover
in her the rashness to conspire against them.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, there at Amboise, she was made to
feel at once their mistrust of her and their power. Whilst
outwardly their manner preserved the deference due to her rank,
they did not trouble to conceal how closely they watched her, or
how, by a vigilance which suffered only those to approach her of
whom they approved, they kept her virtually in duress.</p>
<p>It was only from Fontainebleau in the following spring that, at
last, she so far contrived to elude their watchfulness as to send a
message to the Prince of Condé. For whilst the King of Navarre
might be the nominal head of the Huguenot party, his pusillanimous
nature was content to leave the actual leadership to his bold
soldierly brother, Condé. The message was a very guarded one,
expressing on the surface no more than a desire to learn the true
facts of the affair of La Renaudie, which has been described as the
Tumult of Amboise. But between the lines of it was plainly to be
read a hint that she might be persuaded to enter into relations
with the party of Reform.</p>
<p>The Huguenots responded promptly. An innocent-seeming messenger,
the son of her furrier Le Camus, penetrated the cordon drawn about
her by the Guises. The pretext of soliciting orders for his father
gained the young man admission to her cabinet, where he placed in
her hands a lengthy memorial which bore for signature the borrowed
name of 'Théophile.' This memorial protested in the strongest terms
that the allegations that the affair of Amboise had been hostile to
the King or any Prince of the Blood was a false pretext for cruelty
and oppression by those who tyrannically usurped the royal power,
in violation of all laws and statutes in France established. They
had been constrained to meet with violence the violence of those
who employed the forces of the King for their destruction. It
petitioned that to avert fresh troubles a royal council be set up,
not in accordance with the wishes of Messieurs de Guise, but in
accordance with the ancient constitution, and it demanded for those
of the reformed religion liberty to live in accordance with their
own confessions of faith. To these ends the memorial humbly invoked
the favour of the Queen-Mother.</p>
<p>She raised her heavy eyes from the document and considered the
lean, alert young man in black who stood anxiously before her.</p>
<p>'You are aware of what is in this?'</p>
<p>He bowed low. 'I am empowered, madame, to receive Your Majesty's
answer by word of mouth.'</p>
<p>She sat in thought a while. Then, at last, she fetched a sigh
and showed him a countenance charged with sorrow.</p>
<p>'Say to those who invoke my aid that it is rather for me, who am
little better than a prisoner here, to invoke theirs. Tell them
that I do not forget those who serve me, and that from me they may
count upon that liberty to worship after their own fashion which
these tyrants have denied them. Say to them&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Madame!' It was a cry of warning from Le Camus. Having uttered
it, he went on quickly: 'The ermines this year are costlier than
ever before, for there is a scarcity of good pelts such as would be
worthy of Your Majesty.'</p>
<p>She understood, and her heart had momentarily tightened.</p>
<p>She looked over her shoulder. Behind her the gilt-panelled door
had softly opened. Arrested on the threshold stood a slender
golden-headed girl, delicately featured, with gleaming eyes above
which the brows were now sternly knit. It was the Queen.</p>
<p>Catherine's glance lost none of its drowsiness. It betrayed
neither fear nor resentment of this unannounced intrusion.</p>
<p>'Give me leave yet a moment, child.'</p>
<p>But Mary Stuart, ignoring the dismissal, came boldly
forward.</p>
<p>'Leave to do what, madame?' Her tone was pert. 'What is that
document? And who is this young man? What is his traffic? Pelts or
treason?'</p>
<p>Had she been less anxious to assert her shrewdness and
authority, she might have led Catherine into a trap. But forewarned
that too much had been overheard, the Queen-Mother on the instant
resolved upon her course. It was detestable, but unavoidable. The
luckless young furrier was inevitably to be sacrificed. To attempt
to shield him would be merely to destroy herself with him.</p>
<p>Queen Mary, a little behind her, could not see her
mother-in-law's eyes or the message of pain and compassion which
they flashed upon Le Camus, preparing him for her answer
discounting for him its ruthlessness.</p>
<p>'You may well ask that question. Never was a more impudent
document set before the niece of a Pope. Let someone summon
Monsieur de Guise and the Cardinal.'</p>
<p>Whilst they waited, Queen Mary read the memorial, of which she
had calmly possessed herself and which had been as calmly
surrendered.</p>
<p>Le Camus stood straight and tense and a little defiant, to meet
the doom that he beheld approaching.</p>
<p>The Guises came quickly. Some archers followed them as far as
the anteroom. And it was from the hands of his niece that the tall
Duke received the compromising document. There was a bitter little
smile on the lips of that fair child.</p>
<p>The Cardinal stood beside his brother, to read with him; and on
his lips, too, there was a faint smile as he read, whereas on the
Duke's brow a thundercloud was swelling.</p>
<p>'Who is this? Who is the coward who hides himself under the name
of "Théophile?"'</p>
<p>The Queen-Mother shrugged her ample shoulders. 'I know as much
as you do. You had better ask this messenger of treason.'</p>
<p>'Do you pretend, madame, that you do not know?'</p>
<p>'Pretend!' Her tone was sharp, for not only had the offensive
word stabbed her, but the young Queen had turned the knife in the
wound by laughing. Catherine seemed to swell visibly before them.
'Have you the presumption to question me, Monsieur le Duc?'</p>
<p>He grunted ill-humoured impatience. But the smooth Cardinal
hastened to the rescue.</p>
<p>'Have patience with my brother, madame. As the King's
Lieutenant-General he is responsible for the peace of the realm,
and in matters of treason it becomes his duty to question even Your
Majesty.'</p>
<p>'But not to affront me by ill-judged assumptions. He has the
memorial and the man who brought it. God knows I have made no
concealment of either.'</p>
<p>'Do not be hoodwinked,' cried the young Queen. 'As I entered I
heard her say&mdash;'</p>
<p>Contemptuously Catherine interrupted her. 'Had you remained at
the keyhole a little longer you would have heard me say a deal
more, all with the object of extracting from this traitor the very
information you now seek. That is the pity of it, messieurs. Your
spy in her zeal has ruined my chances of discovering what it
imports the King to know.'</p>
<p>White to the lips under an insult the more intolerable because
it accurately stated the unworthy part her uncles had put upon her,
Mary Stuart cried out in a choking voice:</p>
<p>'Madame! Do you forget that I am Queen of France?'</p>
<p>The Queen-Mother laughed in her throat, sardonically.
'<i>Vraidieu!</i> And of Scotland, and of England, too. But I see
little in your conduct to remind me of this triple queenship.'</p>
<p>'My conduct was not learnt in the market-place of Florence. You
may find yourself back there presently, madame, with your merchant
relatives.'</p>
<p>Her eyes heavy with scorn, Catherine merely shrugged for answer,
whilst the Cardinal, smooth of voice, put an end to the squabble by
a question.</p>
<p>'You do not think, madame, that "Théophile" might stand for
Condé?'</p>
<p>'It is possible. Anything is possible. What do I know? Ask him.'
And she indicated Le Camus.</p>
<p>The Duke undertook the interrogation. But he could extract from
the young man no more than that he was the messenger. Coming to the
Queen-Mother in the pursuit of his trade, he had been asked by La
Roche Chandieu to bear the letter. He did not know who had written
it.</p>
<p>He was arrested, and taken away by the archers. The Guises
followed with their niece, and the Queen-Mother was left alone with
her bitter secret chagrin and sense of defeat.</p>
<p>The detention of Le Camus, however, did not check the activities
into which Condé had been goaded by the recent persecutions. Whilst
issuing a call to arms on the one hand, on the other he was
secretly preparing an indictment of the Guises with the intention
of bringing them to trial by the Estates for <i>lèse-majesté</i> in
their usurpation of the royal power, as well as for pillage,
peculation, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Of these activities and their threatening extent the Guises had
at last evidence in the following August, when they captured
Condé's secretary La Sague with letters upon him which showed how
very diligently the armed rising was being organized.</p>
<p>At the time the elections to the°States General, convoked for
December, were fiercely agitating the country. The Guises, massing
armed forces in Orleans, where the States were to be held, had
yielded to the demand because confident of controlling the issue
and thus consolidating the position which their enemies dreamed of
shaking.</p>
<p>Prompt measures became necessary if they were to curb the Condé
menace, and these prompt measures the Guises took in their own
high-handed fashion. From François II the King of Navarre received
a summons to bring his brother Condé to answer a charge of
sedition. Antoine de Bourbon was given to choose between obedience
and open revolt, and warned that in the event of the latter he
would be taken in the rear by Philip II of Spain with the troops of
Spanish Navarre. The high-spirited Condé urged him to obey, since
as a Prince of the Blood, and counting upon trial by his peers, he
had no anxieties touching the issue.</p>
<p>In this, however, Condé reckoned without the unscrupulous and
tyrannical craft of the Guises. He was arrested immediately on
arrival at Orleans, and the Lieutenant-General illegally decreed
that his cause be judged by a commission which the Guises
themselves appointed. It was in vain that the intrepid hunchback
refused to plead before a tribunal which he rightly denounced as
incompetent to judge him. He was found guilty of
<i>lèse-majesté</i> and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>To Catherine that sentence brought despair. It revealed how
completely, through their ascendancy over the invertebrate King,
the Guises held France in the grip of their mighty tentacles. It
quenched all hope in her that the Huguenot party, deprived thus of
its vigorous head, could be employed as an instrument for her own
deliverance by dislodging the Queen's uncles from their usurpation.
The very daring and ruthlessness of their action was calculated to
strike terror into all who might dream of opposing them, and to
show the world that who opposed them opposed the King, who had no
will but theirs.</p>
<p>For this very reason Catherine did not even attempt to appeal to
her son on Condé's behalf. For her the situation was the same as
when she had allowed Le Camus to be taken. Not merely would any
appeal of hers be profitless to the condemned prince, it would
betray her to the vengeance of the Guises, supplying a pretext for
banishing her, or worse. And her wretched son, she knew, would no
more bestir himself to save her than he bestirred himself to save
Condé.</p>
<p>She was doomed, it seemed, to the perpetuation of the
humiliating nullity which she had endured ever since, twenty-five
years ago, she had become Queen of France.</p>
<p>And then, abruptly, there fell a blow that completely changed
the face of affairs.</p>
<p>The signs of its imminence, abundant enough, had been overlooked
by all the schemers whose attention was engrossed by their own
intrigues.</p>
<p>At Vespers in the Church of the Jacobins on Sunday the 15th
November, the sickly young King fell into a syncope. On recovering
consciousness in his own apartments in the Palace of the Bailliage,
he complained dolefully of a violent pain in the left ear. He was
in a raging fever, and whilst some doctors and surgeons diagnosed
an abscess and others a tumour, all were agreed that be it one or
the other, there was no hope of saving the King's life.</p>
<p>Momentarily the Guises stood aghast, for it seemed to them that
in the doom of François they heard the doom of their own dominion.
For without his royal authority to serve them for a mask their
power was at an end. The Duke of Orleans would succeed to the
throne; and the Duke of Orleans being but ten years old, a regency
must be appointed by the Estates. Not all their power and influence
could earn for either of them that position, since not being
princes of the blood they were constitutionally excluded. Therefore
they must build themselves a future security by the power they
still held, before the death of François made it crumble in their
hands. They perceived that a solution might lie in using the
browbeaten Queen-Mother as a bridge across which they might convey
their usurpation unimpaired from reign to reign. With this intent,
and in a renewal of confidence, they sought her.</p>
<p>The Cardinal took the initiative. 'Madame, you will forgive this
intrusion upon a mother's grief by men who share it deeply. It is
scarcely the hour to consider policy. Yet our duty to the Faith
demands it. You are vouchsafed an opportunity to uphold the
religion you have so fervently professed. Should it now please God
in His wisdom to call the King to His mercy, the country will be in
grave peril of coming under the sway of a heretic regency of the
King of Navarre during the minority of your second son.'</p>
<p>Her mother's heart was not so bowed down by sorrow as to have
clouded her wits. She observed the signs of the anxiety in which
they approached her, as clearly as she surmised the source of it.
She was conscious of quickened heart-beats. Yet as she looked at
them never had her eyes seemed more heavy and dull, never had her
face with its overshot jaw seemed more vacuous. She nodded
slowly.</p>
<p>'It is more than a peril. Constitutionally I believe it is
inevitable.'</p>
<p>'Inevitable, indeed unless we join hands to avert it. As the
mother of the future King Charles you have a natural claim to the
regency, and this claim we will support with all our weight and all
our strength.'</p>
<p>'And you will remember, madame,' the Duke added, 'that I can
count upon upwards of a thousand gentlemen and their following, and
all the troops that were with me in Piedmont.'</p>
<p>'You give me comfort in this evil hour,' she droned in her flat
voice. 'You show me how the calamity may be met. But when all is
said I am no more than a weak and perhaps stupid woman, ill-fitted
for government. If I am to take up this burden, I shall need your
close assistance, my friends.'</p>
<p>Her friends seemed to draw breath more freely. The dull creature
was saving them trouble; they smiled upon her almost tenderly.</p>
<p>'You may count upon that, madame,' the Duke assured her. 'As
Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom I shall not lack the power, just
as I shall not lack the will loyally to uphold you.'</p>
<p>She nodded ponderously. Then she thrust out a lip in doubt.</p>
<p>'The Bourbon Princes&mdash;' she began, like one who hesitates,
and left the question there.</p>
<p>The Duke shrugged confidently. 'They need not trouble us. Condé
is under sentence of death. As for that poltroon, the King of
Navarre, it should be easy to intimidate him into acquiescence. If
not&mdash;' He ended on a gesture grimly significant.</p>
<p>She nodded slowly. 'Perhaps that might be left to me. I do not
think it will be difficult to bring Antoine de Bourbon to reason.
The real danger is Condé. The hunchback is not so easily curbed.
And although under sentence of death, the King is no longer in case
to sign the warrant for his execution, and the Chancellor, I
understand, will not take the responsibility.' She sighed, and
shook her head. 'It serves to show the dangers of delay. This
should have been done before.'</p>
<p>She expressed a welcome, reassuring sentiment. The Cardinal made
light of the matter. 'It means no more than a slight postponement.
What King François cannot sign, Your Majesty can sign presently as
regent for King Charles.'</p>
<p>She showed them a countenance of understanding and relief. 'Of
course. You see how dull I am, and you thrust a regency upon me.
But you make all clear. You must continue to do so, my friends,
should my poor child succumb as the doctors&mdash;' Her voice
faltered into silence. She put a handkerchief to her eyes with one
hand, whilst with the other she gently waved a dismissal.</p>
<p>From an interview to which they had come in grave misgivings
they departed in triumph, and in a contempt for the woman who had
made it so easy, which was equalled only by that woman's secret
contempt for them.</p>
<p>In the days that followed the King grew steadily worse, and lay
for the most part unconscious. The scaffold that had been built for
Condé's execution waited. His royal brother, the King of Navarre,
waited too, wondering what the future might now hold. At last the
Queen-Mother summoned him to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Anxious and haggard, Antoine de Bourbon came to the closet she
had appropriated to herself at the Bailliage, and where she had
disposed that there should be no intruders or spies upon the
interview. She rose to receive him, thus, Queen though she was,
paying a deference to his rank of which he had received little
since coming to Orleans.</p>
<p>'I have sent for you, sire, in the matter of your brother, whose
situation fills me with concern.'</p>
<p>'Messieurs de Guise,' he answered bitterly, 'are singularly
thirsty for Bourbon blood. But by God's grace they may yet be
disappointed. I have the Chancellor's word that he will not sign
the warrant.'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes. Monsieur de l'Hôpital leans strongly towards the new
religion.'</p>
<p>'And as strongly towards justice, madame.'</p>
<p>'Unfortunately he is not the final arbiter.' She sat down again,
and carefully disposed her black velvet gown, against which her
hands showed white as alabaster. 'As you have said, the Guises are
thirsty for Bourbon blood; and unless we go warily they will have
it; your own as well as your brother's.'</p>
<p>That shook him up. His good-humoured plebeian face showed a
deepening agitation. For if unlike his brother, he was straight and
tall, also unlike his brother, his features, framed in a sparse
untidy beard, had none of the high-bred beauty of Condé's.</p>
<p>'If the King should die, as they say, madame...' he began
impetuously, and there broke off, suddenly remembering that he
spoke to the King's mother.</p>
<p>Her calm seemed to him unnatural. 'The King will die. Very soon.
Perhaps tomorrow or the next day. But that will not profit either
you or your brother if the Duke of Guise remains where he is.'</p>
<p>'He will not, madame.' His Majesty of Navarre was vehement. 'The
Estates must uphold my right to the regency during the minority of
King Charles. They cannot help themselves. It is the law.'</p>
<p>She smiled slowly, sadly. She spoke in the same dull, level
tones.</p>
<p>'Don't you see what would happen to the regency of a declared
Huguenot in these days of religious bitterness? It would supply the
Guises with the very opportunity they'll need. Using religion as a
pretext, they would raise the country against you. That is, if they
did not take the shorter road of having you assassinated.'</p>
<p>His eyes betrayed his quaking spirit. He stammered as he
spoke.</p>
<p>'But if not I&mdash;I or Condé&mdash;who then? There is no other
Prince of the Blood. Certainly not this Lorrainer.'</p>
<p>'There is myself,' she answered gravely. 'Yours may be the legal
right. But a mother possesses a natural right over her son during
his minority. The Estates could be brought to recognise it.'</p>
<p>'The Estates, perhaps. But could the Duke of Guise?' He was
derisive.</p>
<p>'Even Monsieur de Guise would be glad to do so since he cannot
hold the office himself, and rather than see you in it.</p>
<p>That turned him thoughtful. He fingered his straggling
beard.</p>
<p>'I see,' he said at last. 'I see. You are asking me to forgo my
rights in your favour?'</p>
<p>'And to your own advantage, sire, and that of Monsieur de Condé.
I promise you that it is the one sure way to save your
brother.'</p>
<p>'God knows I'ld do much to accomplish that. But are we not
reckoning without the host, madame? Decision rests with the
Estates. Would they agree to my renunciation in your favour?'</p>
<p>'Could they oppose it when they perceive in it the certain way
to avoid a civil war? For what I have in mind amounts to an
alliance between us, an alliance between the two great parties in
the State, thus ending the disorders that now distract the land.'
She took up a folded paper from the table at her elbow. 'So sure am
I that good sense will guide you that I have prepared a document
which, if you see fit to sign it, the Chancellor de l'Hôpital will
present to the Estates as soon as it may have pleased God to end
the sufferings of my son François.'</p>
<p>He was taken aback by these assumptions that he would renounce
his rights, and he hesitated a moment, frowning, before accepting
the paper that she proffered. But when he had read it his
expression changed; and it required little persuasion from her
thereafter to bring him to call for a pen.</p>
<p>François II died three days later, on the fifteenth December in
the forenoon. By then the old Constable de Montmorency, secretly
summoned by Catherine, was in Orléans with six hundred men, and
immediately, in the exercise of his office, appointed the guards at
the Bailliage and elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the morrow of the King's death the Estates met to take order
for the government of the realm during the minority of King Charles
IX, and the Chancellor put forward for ratification a document in
which the King of Navarre formally renounced his right to the
regency in favour of the Queen-Mother. The document's further
provision that Antoine de Bourbon should assume the office of
Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom so as to cooperate with the
regent revealed the nature of the alliance between the two great
parties in the State to which Catherine had alluded. Since the
measure carried, as she had said it would, a promise of internal
peace, it was instantly welcomed by all but the Guisards, and
ratification of the document was immediately accorded.</p>
<p>Upon the Duke of Guise, whom it dispossessed of his great
office, and to the Cardinal of Lorraine, this measure which
Catherine had kept secret until it was too late for them to
intervene fell like a thunderbolt. Livid at finding himself thus
stripped in favour of Antoine de Bourbon of the
Lieutenant-Generalship upon which he now depended for the
continuance of his power, the Duke was getting to his feet to voice
his fury and challenge the appointment, when the Cardinal pulled
him down and restrained him.</p>
<p>'In God's name!' he begged. 'Do nothing provocative. That
accursed Florentine woman has tricked us. But wait. Things may not
be as bad as they seem.'</p>
<p>In this he was unduly sanguine. How bad things were they were to
learn fully when they came, after the sitting of the Estates, to
the great hall of the Bailliage.</p>
<p>The Queen-Mother in her deep mourning, accompanied by the weedy
lad in black who was now King Charles IX and closely followed by
the burly old Constable, the King of Navarre, and the handsome
hunchback the Prince of Condé, who had already been released, was
slowly passing through the mourning throng of courtiers, when the
Duke of Guise, breaking from his brother's restraint, put himself
directly in her path.</p>
<p>As the tall, imposing soldierly figure surged before her, she
checked. But it was with the ghost of a smile that her sleepy eyes
were raised to that wrathful, scarred face.</p>
<p>'Madame,' he said, 'I am asking myself the meaning of what we
come from witnessing.'</p>
<p>For all his anger and his habitual arrogance he kept his voice
to a sullen mutter, so that only those immediately about him heard
his words. Catherine's answer, however, was delivered without any
such restraints.</p>
<p>'It means, Monsieur le Duc, that your reign is over. It has
ended together with that of your niece upon whom it depended. For
her there is still a kingdom&mdash;in Scotland. For you, there is
what your loyalty may deserve of us.</p>
<p>On that she motioned him aside. And before the newfound majesty
emanating from this Florentine woman who had waited five and twenty
years for queenship, Monsieur de Guise, abashed, bowed low and
retreated backwards.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>THE KING OF PARIS</h2>
<p>The King of Paris. That was the title bestowed upon him in
bitterness by Henri III when His Majesty found himself all but
besieged in his Palace of the Louvre by the forces which rallied
round the tall, blond, debonair Duke of Guise.</p>
<p>The massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Eve had been justified in
the eyes of its organizers by the assumption that it would remove
the shadow of civil strife and bring peace to a country distracted
by religious war. Its ultimate effect, as might have been foreseen,
was the very opposite.</p>
<p>After Charles IX died in his blood-sweat, haunted by visions of
corpses floating in the Seine, Henri III, his brother and scarcely
less crazy successor, found it impossible to bring Catholic and
Protestant to lie down in peace together. It was not in the power
of the indolent, decadent voluptuary, engrossed in his mignons and
the adornment of his rachitic person, to supply a head to a body so
refractory as that of his kingdom. His choice of the line of least
resistance, his insincere attempts to be conciliatory without
reassuring the Huguenots, exasperated the Catholics. When Henry of
Navarre and the Duke of Anjou kindled anew the torch of war, and
took to arms with the support of German mercenaries, the Catholic
faction, seeing no provision from the supine monarch, took steps to
provide for itself. The League came into existence, with the
gallant, splendid, and undoubtedly ambitious Duke of Guise at its
head.</p>
<p>The death of Anjou in 1584, leaving the Protestant Henry of
Navarre lawful heir to the throne of France, produced a climax. The
Leaguers constrained from the King an edict under which the
practice of the new religion was forbidden. He gave it grudgingly,
offended, not so much by the edict, which his bigotry must approve,
as by the compulsion imposed upon him which brought him the
humiliating understanding that whilst he might be King he was not
master.</p>
<p>Thus was the kingdom split, not merely into two, but into three
parties, of which the King's was the most impotent. Almost he came
to look favourably on the Huguenots as the least formidable of his
opponents.</p>
<p>Paris, the headquarters of the League, mistrusting him more and
more, fell into a condition of revolt. It governed itself by a
commission of sixteen representatives of the sixteen quarters into
which the city was divided, and Henri found himself the subject of
daily attacks and insults, alike from mob orators at street-corners
and from preachers in the pulpit.</p>
<p>Most active in the inspiration of all this fury was the Duke of
Guise's sister Catherine, the handsome, fiery Duchess of
Montpensier. She headed processions, she subsidised poets to write
lampoons, she harangued the people from the balcony of her palace,
and by every means that wit could invent and zeal encompass this
lovely Maenad applied spurs to the popular wrath. One of her most
noteworthy pieces of propaganda was a great picture the painting of
which she directed, displaying Elizabeth of England in the act of
torturing her Catholic subjects. Set up in the Cemetery of Saint
Séverin, it proved a great and inflammatory attraction. It was
dangerous in other ways, and when the King heard of it he felt it
necessary to take action. He issued his orders one night, and on
the following morning the picture had disappeared, and among the
tombstones in front of the space where it had stood lay a frail
little tonsured fellow in the white habit and black cloak of the
order of Saint Dominic with a broken, bleeding head.</p>
<p>Solicitous hands came at last to raise him and to bathe his
wound. He revived, and told his tale. He had been in the cemetery
when the Swiss sent by the King attacked the picture. He had made a
futile protest against the action, and then of his body a still
more futile shield. He had had his head broken for his pains by
those ministers of the powers of evil.</p>
<p>The people about him were raising the cry of 'Sacrilege!' when
the Duchess arrived. Tall, golden, commanding, in all the glory of
her youth and beauty, she swept through the little crowd. Nobly
impulsive, her arms enfolded the frail little hero, who at contact
with her started as if scorched, and fell away muttering and
mumbling, his eyes, after one terrified upward glance, intent upon
the ground. Weakly he sat down upon a tombstone.</p>
<p>Madame de Montpensier waved the people back, and went to sit
beside him.</p>
<p>'Little brother, this was a noble folly for which God will
reward you.'</p>
<p>He kept his eyes upon the ground. He fetched a sigh. 'Not noble.
No. Nor yet a folly, unless it be a folly to seek a martyr's crown.
I did my duty. If it had pleased God that the blow that stunned me
had ended my miserable life, it would have been very well. I could
not die better.'</p>
<p>'But we want you to live, my brother. We need such lives, such
heroic lives as yours, to battle for the glory of the Faith.'</p>
<p>He drew the cowl over his tonsured bandaged head as he answered
her.</p>
<p>'Not heroic. No. I am not heroic. That is wrong.' He was in
evident distress. 'I am a poor sinner who seeks to expiate a great
sin. I will not be misunderstood or glorified for what I have
suffered here. I will not.' He became fierce. The smouldering eyes
bred a suspicion that he had a fever.</p>
<p>'I am one who but for the mercy shown me should have been
stripped of the blessed habit of Saint Dominic, so heavy was my
sin.' He seemed to take satisfaction in this self-denunciation.
'The penance imposed with absolution was nothing. That I have
performed. But my soul knows that it can be purified only by some
great sacrifice that shall redound to the honour and glory of the
Faith. I thought when I fronted those men here that the chance of
expiation was offered to me at last. That is all. I am not brave. I
am not strong. I am weak and cowardly by nature.'</p>
<p>'I do not think that I have ever met a braver man, little
brother,' said the Duchess tenderly, and the gaping crowd, creeping
ever nearer in their curiosity, offered a murmuring chorus.</p>
<p>The young friar rose to his feet. 'You do not understand. You do
not understand,' he complained. 'I had hoped to expiate in full. I
have been cheated. It must be that I am not yet worthy.'</p>
<p>He staggered forward, signing with emaciated hands to be allowed
to pass. The crowd, a little in awe, opened before him, and with
bent head and faltering, uncertain step he took his departure.</p>
<p>The Duchess rose, drawing her ruby-coloured cloak about her.
There were tears in her eyes. 'There goes a saint,' she said
softly; and then, being an opportunist, she employed the emotions
of the moment as a text for a sermon upon the heinousness of the
King.</p>
<p>For his salvation's sake, she told her listeners, there was but
one thing to be done with Henri III of France, who sent his
mercenaries to break the heads of God's true servants. He must be
shut up in a convent to do penance for his evil life. She displayed
a pair of golden scissors, holding them aloft for all to see. These
she had specially procured, she announced, so that she might
tonsure the King's majesty when the time came. The crowd roared its
approving laughter, but some who mingled with it bore the tale of
these doings to the Louvre.</p>
<p>When Henri heard how Madame de Montpensier proposed to dispose
of him, he was confirmed in the suspicion that her brother aimed at
nothing less than making himself King of France.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Henry of Guise was King of Paris, and into this
kingdom, where he was idolized, he daringly adventured himself when
the ferment was at its height. He came with only a half-dozen
attendants, muffled in a cloak, his face in the shadow of a
slouched hat. But his tall inches and superb carriage betrayed him,
and once the rumour of his identity was sped, the mob pressed about
him, showered flowers upon him, kissed his cloak, his very boots.
They compelled him to unmask, to disclose the abundant fair hair,
already white at the temples although he was only in the middle
thirties, and the proud face, still handsome despite the scar from
a bullet that had ploughed his left cheek at Port-à-Binson, a scar
which made him the more lovely in their eyes, being that of a wound
taken in the saintly cause. The streets rang with their
acclamations:</p>
<p>'Vive Guise! Vive le pilier de l'Église!'</p>
<p>Affable, winning, he smiled upon them, he waved to them, he
shook hands with those nearest, indifferent to their quality. It
could matter little to his safety that he should have disclosed
himself. Thus hedged about by friends, it was inconceivable that
harm could touch him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was the Queen-Mother, Catherine de Medicis, he
must first visit. He trusted her shrewd sense to see that no
violence was offered to him by the King. And so, with the mob for
escort, he made his way to the Hôtel de Soissons, behind the Corn
Market, where she was in residence.</p>
<p>She saw him from a window as he crossed the courtyard, an
apparition so incredible that this woman who accounted herself
endowed with second-sight, who mingled shrewd ability with
superstition, dabbling in necromancy and the like, imagined herself
at her visions.</p>
<p>They had been with her a good deal lately, those visions. She
was a little ghost-ridden in those days, and because of this
assumed now that Guise was dead and that here came his ghost
walking her courtyard. The assumption persisted until he stood
before her, very solid flesh.</p>
<p>'I am forced to seek you, madame. It is of the very greatest
importance that I see the King. I implore you, madame, to employ
your influence so that he may pay heed to the counsel I have to
offer, for I assure you that if he is to save his crown, it is
absolutely necessary that he should change his course, and at
once.'</p>
<p>Knowing his power in Paris, her shrewdness perceived in his
refraining from using it an evidence of his honesty. So the big
woman of seventy, with her sleepy eyes and underhung jaw, sent word
ahead to the King, and herself accompanied Guise to the Louvre.</p>
<p>Henri, in his private closet, tottered to a chair when her
message reached him. His weak knees bent under him and he sat down
in anger and panic. Like Guise, he was in the middle thirties. But
in nothing did he resemble that virile gentleman. Of middle height,
and very thin, especially in the legs, he was a picture of
nauseating effeminacy: overdressed, scented, diamonds in his ears,
his fingers crowded with gems. He was white-faced, rather than
pale, and underhung like his mother, but in him the defect was
partly dissembled by a little pointed brown beard. For all his
feebleness, he had a resonant voice. He raised it to address
Monsieur de Saint-Prix, with whom he was alone.</p>
<p>'I have forbidden him Paris, and he comes. He dares! If you were
in my place, Saint-Prix, and you had given this order, and he had
disregarded it, what should you do?'</p>
<p>Softly Saint-Prix asked: 'Sire, do you hold Monsieur de Guise
for your friend, or your enemy?'</p>
<p>The King twirled nervous fingers. To Monsieur de Saint-Prix this
was an answer.</p>
<p>'Sire, give me the honour of this charge, and I will, without
further trouble to Your Majesty, lay his head at your feet. There
shall be no disturbance. I pledge my life and honour on that, and
place them in your hands.'</p>
<p>That is how courtiers talk, hoping, it must be supposed, that
they will not be called upon to perform as they promise. Saint-Prix
certainly was not.</p>
<p>The King's dark, Italian eyes gleamed; but his jewelled hands
trembled.</p>
<p>'Wait,' he said, and issued orders for the Duke's reception.</p>
<p>They were of such a character that when Monsieur de Guise
arrived with the Queen-Mother, he passed up the grand staircase
between two files of drawn swords. In the antechamber the bows with
which he greeted the startled courtiers were disregarded. He lost
none of his countenance on that account, and passed majestically
into the presence, piloted ever by Catherine. As he bowed low from
his magnificent height, the King started up.</p>
<p>'Why are you here?' he snapped. 'Why have you come?' And without
waiting for an answer he stepped aside and turned his back upon the
Duke.</p>
<p>Guise straightened himself. He fingered his pointed beard. His
eyes were calm as they sought Catherine, but he was thinking of the
drawn swords on the staircase.</p>
<p>The Queen-Mother heaved herself forward, heavy-footed, to the
rescue. She took her son by the arm, and drew him aside, to a
window. Her voice, muffled and sounding like the drone of an
insect, was busy for a moment. Then she drew aside the curtain and
let Henri become aware of the rabble that, following in the wake of
Guise, had come to pack the courtyard of the palace. She droned a
few words more, and leaned upon the window-ledge.</p>
<p>The King in turning away disclosed a face of chalk. His legs
were trembling. Monsieur de Guise understood that no arguments he
might have employed could have been half as convincing as the thing
Catherine had shown her son. He perceived no need to linger. The
swords on the staircase would not be likely to hinder his
departure. He bowed again.</p>
<p>'Madame, I leave it in your hands to make my peace with His
Majesty.' His tone was so quiet that he might have been suspected
of irony. He moved backwards to the door, and went out.</p>
<p>Three days later he came again. By then he had collected his
followers, and had set up headquarters in his hotel. He brought
with him now a train of four hundred gentlemen, all of them armed.
It was very impressive. And the King was so impressed that after
the Duke's slightly swaggering departure he sent an order that the
main body of his Swiss Guards, quartered in the outskirts, should
come at once to Paris.</p>
<p>As things stood it was a foolish order. When the news of this
spread through the city it was borne of course on the wings of a
rumour that the Swiss were coming to massacre the Catholics. There
was to be another Saint Bartholomew's Eve. That was enough. The
King's last friends among the people deserted his cause; barricades
sprang up in the streets; the entire populace was under arms; and
the menace grew so dreadful that in his panic the King, who had
spent a night with armed guards about his royal bed, was driven to
appeal to Guise, a circumstance for which it was impossible that he
should ever forgive the Duke.</p>
<p>The Duke, debonair, smiling, deprecatory, denied all cause for
royal apprehension. The people's action was a simple defensive
precaution; they were good children; they meant no harm.</p>
<p>Majesty was not reassured, nor did Guise intend that he should
be.</p>
<p>The people took possession 4 the Hôtel de Ville and the Arsenal.
The storm raged on. Madame de Montpensier rode through the streets
like a Valkyrie. The very Louvre was barricaded.</p>
<p>Hitherto Henri had thought of his royal dignity. Now it was time
to think of his royal skin. He slipped quietly away.</p>
<p>From outside the walls of Paris, he cursed the perfidious and
ungrateful city, and made a solemn vow that he would never return
to it save through a breach in those same walls. After that he set
out for Chartres, and thence, for still greater safety, removed
himself to Rouen. There, brought to bay, he at last capitulated,
and signed the treaty dictated by the League. It provided that the
Protestant succession of Henry of Navarre should be renounced, that
the Duke of Guise should be created Lieutenant-General&mdash;as
once his father before him had been&mdash;and recognised as heir to
the crown, and that the States General should be convoked.</p>
<p>This convocation took place at Blois in the following November,
and the members of the League who formed part of the composition of
the States came charged with reform.</p>
<p>As with all nations in a state of decadence, the multiplication
of public offices in France had reached fabulous proportions. Their
ruthless curtailment was now demanded. This and the insistence upon
'One Religion' were the chief embarrassments that troubled the
King. His Majesty was in need of supplies. But the States could not
meet the need. They treated him insolently. He appealed to Guise,
whom he had created his Grand Master, to move the Leaguers to meet
his financial necessities. Guise agreed with a laugh that was an
insult, and nothing followed.</p>
<p>Henri raged; and he raged now more or less in secret. He no
longer had the support and guidance of his shrewd mother. Himself
he had discarded it. Since leaving Paris he had emancipated himself
from her tutelage, and although she was with him he no longer
confided in her, which filled her with dread of the blunders he
might perpetrate. Guise, on the other hand, had never been more
intimate with her than in those wintry days at Blois when her
health was pathetically failing.</p>
<p>The King, with all the jealousy and suspicion of his weak,
feminine nature, observed this intimacy, drew unwarranted
conclusions from it, and sank more deeply into rancour. Then he
played a scene that can hardly have imposed upon that astute,
discerning woman.</p>
<p>He made a solemn declaration to the States that he was resolved
to relinquish the reins of government to his mother and his cousin
of Guise. He was done with the world, he declared. Henceforth he
desired to take no thought but for the salvation of his soul and to
do penance for his sins. Upon the Host and the Altar he swore a
perfect reconcilement with the Duke of Guise and oblivion of all
past quarrels.</p>
<p>If this seemed excessive, yet it was an excess in a neurotic
from whom the world was accustomed to excesses: excesses of
libertinism alternating with excesses of devotion.</p>
<p>He had no sooner taken that oath than, on the Sunday before the
Feast of Saint Thomas, he sent for the Maréchal d'Aumale and
Monsieur de Rambouillet.</p>
<p>'Either Guise or I must die,' he told them. 'Otherwise life
becomes impossible.'</p>
<p>Neither of those gentlemen betrayed surprise. D'Aumale's
suggestion was that they should proceed by arrest and trial.
Rambouillet was for killing Guise out of hand. So was the King. He
merely wanted someone else to propose it. Since this had happened,
he now sent for that famous swordsman and perfect courtier,
Monsieur de Crillon, and offered him the task.</p>
<p>'It would enchant me, sire! to have the opportunity of killing
Monsieur de Guise in a duel,' said Crillon. 'But I cannot murder a
man.'</p>
<p>'Bah! He would not take your challenge. He accounts himself
royal.'</p>
<p>It may have been true. But it was no reason, as Crillon
understood things, why he should become a bravo. So the matter was
not further pressed upon him.</p>
<p>His Majesty had never studied caution, and the walls of old
castles notoriously have ears. On the Wednesday of the Feast of
Saint Thomas, King and Duke met as they came from Mass. Henri, very
gracious, threaded an arm through an arm of his Grand Master, to
whom he had sworn reconcilement upon the Host and the Altar and
whom he had invited Monsieur de Crillon to murder. His Majesty drew
him to walk in the dreary, leafless garden. He was all smirks and
smiles and sweetnesses, like a coquettish woman, until the blond
Duke, looking down upon him from his splendid height, put a
question.</p>
<p>'What, I ask myself, does this affability conceal?'</p>
<p>'Conceal!' Majesty was shocked.</p>
<p>'That was my word. What do you hatch against me? To cover what
purpose did you perjure your little soul so publicly?'</p>
<p>'You forget that I am your King.'</p>
<p>'That is what I wish to forget. I desire to leave your
service.'</p>
<p>This was really alarming. It might mean departure; and the King
did not desire that Guise should quit Blois just then. He attempted
to be conciliatory in his smile. He achieved sickliness. 'Come,
come. We grow heated where there is no need. You cannot contemplate
resigning your offices.'</p>
<p>'If it please you, sire.'</p>
<p>'Then I must know your reasons. I demand to know them.'</p>
<p>'Seek them in your own heart, sire,' said Guise. 'Give me
leave.' Without waiting for it, he swept the King a bow, and
departed.</p>
<p>On the morrow he sent in his resignation of the offices of
Lieutenant-General and Grand-Master. Nevertheless he lingered on in
Blois, for two reasons: he desired to continue to attend the
deliberations of the States General, and he was fast in the toils
of that famous syren Madame de Sauves.</p>
<p>Two days later, on the twenty-second December, as he sat down to
supper, he found a note in his napkin.</p>
<p>'The King,' an unknown hand had written, 'intends to kill
you.'</p>
<p>He smiled, called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote underneath:
'He would not dare.' Then he cast the note under the table, and
supped with a good appetite notwithstanding that this was the fifth
warning he had received that day.</p>
<p>After supper he sauntered off to keep his assignation with
Madame de Sauves. It amused him that anyone should suppose he was
to be deprived by foolish threats of enjoying her delectable
society.</p>
<p>He rose at eight on the following morning, and dressed himself
with care in a new grey satin suit. With a short cloak worn
jauntily over the shoulder, he went forth to attend a meeting of
the Council that should even then be assembling. It was raining
outside, and the gallery along which he walked at a leisurely pace,
his attendants following, was plunged in gloom. A gentleman going
in the opposite direction brushed against him and left a note in
his hand.</p>
<p>He laughed softly. 'Ah! Thank you. That will be the ninth this
morning.' It was scarcely necessary for him to unfold it so as to
discover what was written; nevertheless he did so, and read:
'Depart at once or you are a dead man.' He laughed again, and
strolled on.</p>
<p>At the head of the stairs leading down to the Council Hall, the
Captain of the Guard saluted him with exaggeration. If Guise
noticed it, he did not heed it, nor that in coming, as if
respectfully after him, with his men, the Captain had cut him off
from his own followers, saving only his secretary Péricard, who
entered the hall immediately upon his heels.</p>
<p>The gloom in the hall was deeper than it had been in the
gallery; and there was, too, a gloom that was not merely of that
cheerless December morning. A hush had fallen upon the assembled
deputies when he entered. They were staring at him out of long
faces, with eyes laden with dismay.</p>
<p>Whether from this, or from the cold, damp atmosphere, or from
both, a chill struck through him and he shivered. His left eye,
immediately above the scar, began to water, as it did with him in
moments of mental or physical discomfort. He put his hand in his
pocket.</p>
<p>'Péricard, I have come without a handkerchief. Will you be so
good as to fetch me one?'</p>
<p>He watched Péricard out, saw the door close upon him, and
shivered again. 'How cold it is.' He waved a hand towards the
hearth on which the logs were piled. 'Let a fire be lighted,' he
commanded, and passed on to take his seat.</p>
<p>There was a rustle of papers. Then again silence. The Duke
looked about him. Again he put his hand in his pocket. This time he
drew forth his sweetmeat-box. It was in the shape of a shell,
silver-gilt. He raised the lid. The box was empty.</p>
<p>'My people,' he said gently, 'have not given me my necessaries
this morning. But there is every excuse for them. They were too
much hurried. Monsieur de Morfontaines, be so kind as to ask
Monsieur de Saint-Prix to let me have a few damsons or a little
preserve of roses, or some trifle from the King's cupboard.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Morfontaines took the box, and went out.</p>
<p>A deputy who had been speaking upon the salt tax when Guise
entered, and who had remained standing, now resumed his discourse,
until he was again interrupted by the entrance of Monsieur de
Saint-Prix with the Duke's comfit-box. This contained four
Brignolles plums, one of which Guise ate whilst the deputy took up
his thread once more.</p>
<p>Then Péricard returned. But he was not suffered to enter. The
handkerchief was taken from him, and brought to the Duke. A moment
later the unfortunate exponent of matters connected with the salt
tax was interrupted yet again. This time it was by the sudden
entrance of Monsieur Révol, the Secretary of State. His face was
ghastly. He seemed to tremble, and his voice almost failed him as
he addressed the Duke.</p>
<p>'Monsieur, the King wants you. He is in his old cabinet.</p>
<p>Guise stood up, perfectly calm and unconcerned. He emptied his
comfit-box onto the council table. 'Gentlemen, who will have
any?'</p>
<p>He pulled up his cloak, so as to wrap it about him, and took his
hat and gloves.</p>
<p>'Adieu, messieurs,' he said, which in a way was considered odd.
Yet his tone was unconcernedly courteous.</p>
<p>Calm, tall, elegant, commanding, he crossed the hall, and passed
out by the door held for him by Monsieur Révol. On the threshold,
the officer guarding it, one of the forty-five guardsmen, trod on
his foot with a significance as unmistakable as that of his glance.
Guise smiled faintly into those friendly solemn eyes, and went
on.</p>
<p>A dozen gentlemen, all of them members of the Forty-Five,
saluted him with a frigid courtesy as he passed through the
antechamber.</p>
<p>His hand was on the tapestry, masking the door of the King's
cabinet, when he paused, and, perhaps instinctively, half-turned.
He was just in time to see Monsieur de Montsérine advancing upon
him with dagger raised. He attempted to ward the blow with the hand
that held the comfit-box. But the blade sank into his breast.
Instantly four others were upon him.</p>
<p>'Oho, my friends!' he cried out before their daggers took him in
neck and back and reins.</p>
<p>His sword was entangled in his cloak, his legs were seized, and
he was half-choked by blood. Nevertheless by an exertion of his
superb strength, bearing his assailants with him, he staggered
across the room, and down the little passage that led to the King's
bedroom. There, in a great voice that carried as far as the Council
Hall, he cried out:</p>
<p>'My God! I am dead! Have mercy on me!'</p>
<p>On the words he crashed down at the foot of the King's bed, and
on a last hoarse, rattling sigh expired.</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the Forty-Five picked his pockets of such money
as he had upon him, and filched the jewels from his person. Someone
placed a cross of straw upon his breast, and someone else
derisively hailed him as 'the glorious King of Paris.'</p>
<p>Then His Majesty, livid of face and with trembling, jewelled
fingers plucking at his beard, tiptoed in and up to the fallen
Duke. Since four o'clock that morning he had been waiting in
agitation for this moment. Himself he had led a train of priests to
his oratory with instructions to pray for his success in an
enterprise the nature of which he did not dare to tell them. His
almoner was in attendance by his orders, waiting to confess him
when the thing should be done. It was so easy, after all, he
imagined, to cheat God.</p>
<p>He stood there shivering as he stared.</p>
<p>'How tall he is!' He spoke softly, in a hushed voice of awe. 'He
seems even taller than when he was alive!' Then a note of gaiety,
more horrible far than that of horror, came into his voice. 'I am
the only King now.'</p>
<p>He turned away from the body, and sped down to his sick mother
in her room on the floor below.</p>
<p>'Madame, how are you this morning?'</p>
<p>'None too well, my son,' she answered plaintively. 'But I am
very well,' he crowed. 'I am King of France. I have killed the King
of Paris.'</p>
<p>The folly of it plunged her into panic. It broke her spirit. It
may well have hurried her along the path she was treading, to her
death, thirteen days later.</p>
<p>She saw too clearly what her son had still to learn: that to be
a king something more than the ability to murder is necessary. She
perceived that the League which he had thought so easily to destroy
would, on the contrary, be cemented into greater strength by the
blood of Henry of Guise.</p>
<p>And so it befell. Guise's brother, the fat Duke of Mayenne, was
summoned by the League to place himself at its head, and when he
hesitated, being a man who loved his ease, there was his ardent
irresistible sister, Madame de Montpensier, to drive him to it.</p>
<p>The news of the murder had been quick to reach Paris. It was
there by Christmas Eve. In announcing it from the pulpits, the
preachers denounced the murderer. The widowed Duchess of Guise,
and, more conspicuously, Madame de Montpensier showed themselves in
trailing black, and by the spectacle of their grief inflamed the
people to madness. The Sorbonne, that august body of enormous
ecclesiastical influence, practically excommunicated the King for
his deed by declaring all Frenchmen released from their allegiance
to him.</p>
<p>On the night of Christmas a hundred thousand men with torches
went in procession through Paris. At a given signal the torches
were extinguished, and out of the darkness rose the voice of the
multitude: 'May God thus extinguish the House of Valois.'</p>
<p>When Henri heard of it and that the army of the League was in
the field under Mayenne, it seemed to him that he looked into the
face of doom. Drowning, he must clutch at whatever offered.</p>
<p>'At need,' he swore, 'I will make use of heretics, or even of
Turks.'</p>
<p>Turks there were none available. But there was a goodly body of
heretics under Henry of Navarre, and the King of France flung
himself and his fortunes into their arms for safety.</p>
<p>In the following July, at the head of an army of forty-two
thousand, Mayenne and his Leaguers having been signally defeated,
Henri, master of the situation, was at Saint-Cloud, lodged in the
house of the Comte de Retz, whence he could look out upon Paris,
which he was besieging; the ungrateful and perfidious city, which
soon now he would enter as he had vowed, through a breach in her
walls.</p>
<p>Within that city, determined to resist to the last, there was
now little hope, save in divine intervention. Madame de
Montpensier, like an angel of wrath, stimulated the sixteen
representatives into continued resistance, whipped up the passions
of the people, led processions to Nôtre Dame and elsewhere to
beseech a miracle. And, as she believed, the miracle happened.</p>
<p>One stifling July day as she rode across the Pont Neuf at the
head of a contingent of clamouring suppliants, she espied in one of
the embrasures of the bridge a slight figure in the black and white
of a Dominican. Looking more closely, she recognized the abject
little sinner who went in quest of expiation, the little friar who
had sought to defend her picture of Queen Elizabeth's victims in
the Cemetery of Saint Séverin.</p>
<p>She drew rein, beckoned him to her stirrup, and bending down
spoke to him.</p>
<p>That night he waited upon her at her house. With hands meekly
folded within the sleeves of his habit, with eyes downcast, lest
they meet the disturbing effulgence of her beauty, he stood before
her. Her voice, soft, musical, pleading, inspiring, recited a
well-considered message. In silence he listened, apparently
unmoved. There was a pause when she had done. It endured. So she
added something.</p>
<p>'What an expiation would not that be! Accomplish this, and if
you succeed, not only will you have won Heaven's absolution of your
sin, whatever it may be, but great rewards will await you here.
Even a cardinal's hat may not be beyond your deserts.'</p>
<p>He spoke at last, to interrupt her. The slight figure seemed to
swell before her and gather strength.</p>
<p>'No hat. No. No hat. A crown! A martyr's crown, madame.'</p>
<p>Abruptly on that he turned and went, leaving her to stare after
him, and wonder.</p>
<p>This happened on the evening of Monday the thirty-first July. On
the morning of Tuesday, soon after the King had risen, he heard an
altercation in his antechamber. Annoyed, he sent Monsieur de
Saint-Prix to discover the meaning of it.</p>
<p>'It's a friar,' the first groom of the chamber came back to
report. 'A friar who says that he has a letter for you from the
Comte de Brienne, who is a prisoner in Paris. The guards won't let
him pass.'</p>
<p>'Won't let him pass? And he a friar?' The King frowned.
'<i>Ventredieu!</i> I'll have it added to my iniquities that I
withhold myself from men of God. Bid him in.'</p>
<p>A young Dominican, a slight frail wisp of a man, was introduced.
He advanced to the King, who, half-dressed, had pulled a bedgown
about him. He proffered a letter. The King took it, and broke the
seal.</p>
<p>'I have a message also, sire,' said a gentle voice. 'But it is
for your ear alone. It is of great importance, sire.'</p>
<p>There were several persons in attendance. The King waved them
carelessly into the background. His eyes were on the letter.</p>
<p>'The message?' he snapped.</p>
<p>The little friar drew close, so as to be quite private.</p>
<p>'It is this,' he said, and drove a long knife to the haft into
the royal bowels just below the waist.</p>
<p>The King reeled back. Ah, scoundrel monk!' In a spasmodic effort
he wrenched the weapon from the wound, and flung it in the face of
the Dominican. The point of it gashed the little man's eyebrow as
it passed him. 'He has killed me! Kill him! Kill him!' He sank
back, helpless, moribund, into the arms of an attendant, whilst a
dozen others flung themselves upon the friar.</p>
<p>The young Dominican fell back before them to the wall. Against
this he stood cruciform with arms outstretched, and as their steel
tore his entrails, his breast, his throat, he lifted up his eyes
and a joy ineffable broke upon his pallid face.</p>
<p>He had expiated.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>THE TRAGEDY OF MADAME</h2>
<p>Monsieur, the King's brother, bounced forward, his long full
face more than ordinarily pale, his fine eyes&mdash;the only fine
feature of that weak unhealthy countenance&mdash;malevolent.</p>
<p>'You do not rehearse today.'</p>
<p>It was a command; but Monsieur de Guiche preferred not to
understand it. He raised his eyebrows in languid impertinence.</p>
<p>'Your highness is mistaken; I do. It is the more necessary since
the King plays in the ballet.'</p>
<p>Monsieur flushed and bit his lip. Almost he seemed on the point
of tears.</p>
<p>'At least you do not rehearse with Madame. I forbid it.</p>
<p>'Monsieur forbids that which the King commands! Monsieur sees
that he places a poor courtier in an impossible position.'</p>
<p>'The fault, sir, is your own.'</p>
<p>'If Monsieur would condescend to say how!' begged de Guiche,
imperturbable.</p>
<p>Monsieur writhed visibly. He swung about as if to appeal for
assistance to his dear friend, the Chevalier de Lorraine.</p>
<p>But because the Chevalier was of those who prefer that their
hands shall not be visible in the things they do, he proffered no
assistance, made no response to that mute appeal. Therefore
Monsieur could do no more than repeat himself.</p>
<p>'I have said that you do not rehearse at Madame's.'</p>
<p>'I heard your highness. But since that is where His Majesty
desires the rehearsal to be held, I do not see how I am to rehearse
elsewhere.'</p>
<p>'You mean that you will defy me?' The Prince's voice shrilled,
he squared himself, his fists on his hips, to confront with almost
hysterical truculence the man who until now had been one of his
closest friends.</p>
<p>He was not formidable to the eye, with his powdered black wig,
his painted cheeks, his foppish gaudy dress, his fluttering
ribbons, his rings and bracelets, and the ridiculous heels by which
he sought to add length to a short figure that already in early
youth&mdash;he was barely twenty&mdash;inclined to portliness.</p>
<p>'I mean, your highness, that I cannot keep Madame waiting.'</p>
<p>'Monsieur, you are insolent.'</p>
<p>'Monsieur, you are fatuous!'</p>
<p>For an instant Monsieur de Guiche had lost his self-control, and
in that instant he had answered thus. Having answered, he added to
the affront by stalking out of the room without waiting to be
dismissed. He left behind him a gaping Prince, and a scowling
Chevalier.</p>
<p>As usual the Prince turned to the Chevalier for guidance in his
difficulty. Tight-lipped, the Chevalier considered the case of the
Prince whom he at once served and ruled. He was a handsome sinister
figure this swarthy hawk-faced young Guise. Combining in his nature
the haughtiness of the men of his breed with their guile and craft,
he knew how to make himself feared and respected not only by the
invertebrate Philip of Orleans, but even by the dominant Louis XIV.
He was imbued with that greed of authority and power that was also
a characteristic of his race; and his dominion over
Monsieur&mdash;a mere puppet to dance as he should
pipe&mdash;afforded him the means of gratifying some of his
boundless ambition. Seeing this dominion threatened by Henrietta of
England&mdash;the daughter of the unfortunate Charles I&mdash;whom
Philip had taken to wife, Monsieur de Lorraine conceived that his
interest lay in sowing discord between the pair. It was not a
difficult task. The marriage was entirely a political one&mdash;the
union of a Princess of the Blood of England to a Prince of the
Blood of France&mdash;and affection had played no part in it. If,
as Madame de Lafayette tells us, it was not reserved for any woman
to inflame the heart of the absurd and epicene Philip, it certainly
was not reserved for him to inflame the heart of any woman, least
of all a woman of the gifts of mind and person that were the
delectable Henrietta's. The King, her brother-in-law, held her in
affection and esteem, not only on account of her sprightly
attractiveness, but also because of her intelligent usefulness. She
was the agent&mdash;the real ambassador&mdash;at the Court of
France of her brother, Charles II of England, and she made herself
the channel through which Louis and Charles conducted a
correspondence on State matters of the utmost secrecy, from which
the talkative numskull Philip was excluded.</p>
<p>Had anything been wanting further to embitter and alarm the
Chevalier de Lorraine, that circumstance supplied it. Philip's own
conception of affairs of State was that they were the family
affairs of the royal house of France; this conception the Chevalier
steadily fostered. The effect might have satisfied him because of
the utter frigidity it introduced into marital relations that
hitherto had been merely chilly. But soon there was more to serve
his evil ends and render the estrangement more complete.</p>
<p>The Court was plunged fathoms deep into frivolity and gaiety.
There was no thought for anything but masques and dances and
elaborate ballets in the fairy setting of the garden-theatre beside
the lake at Fontainebleau&mdash;ballets in which the Sun King
himself took a leading part, and in which Madame delighted
everybody by her beauty, her elegance, her sprightliness, and her
histrionic talent. De Guiche was one of the foremost figures, one
of the leading spirits, in that troupe of noble actors, and the
Chevalier de Lorraine slyly invited Monsieur to observe that the
young man's passion was too ardent to conceal itself.</p>
<p>When it fell to his lot to play the lover to Madame, he did so,
the Chevalier opined, with an unnecessary and suspicious ardour. It
was difficult to believe that this was mere acting.</p>
<p>Inflamed by that broad hint, Monsieur considered it due to his
dignity to set a term to what suddenly appeared a scandal. You have
seen the attempt he made, and how it had fared with his dignity in
the matter. Shaking with anger, he besought guidance of his mentor,
the Chevalier. The Chevalier counselled him to carry a plaint to
the King, and away the fellow sped on his high heels to his royal
brother.</p>
<p>He wept and screamed as he poured out his rage and
jealousy&mdash;for although he may have had no love for his wife,
he had a considerable amount of affection for himself, and jealousy
may have&mdash;and commonly has&mdash;no other source than
self-love.</p>
<p>The august majesty of Louis XIV listened, frowning. In itself
his brother's paroxysm disgusted him. He was reluctant to deal
harshly with de Guiche. For it happened that de Guiche had been
aspiring to the hand of Mademoiselle de la Vallière at the time
that Louis fell in love with her. De Guiche, like a dutiful
subject, had retired in favour of his king. Therefore Louis had a
tenderness for him. And he had also a tenderness for Madame. He
perceived that she was by nature a coquette, to whom admiration and
devotion were as breath to her nostrils, with the result that she
offered herself to all whilst giving herself to none. Sooner or
later it was inevitable that she should compromise herself in this
dangerous game of dalliance, most dangerous in that loose,
licentious, pleasure-seeking Court of France. And now, if he were
to credit the rantings of Philip, it looked as if the inevitable
were imminent, if it had not already happened.</p>
<p>His Majesty soothed his absurd brother by a reluctant promise
that the brilliant de Guiche should be removed from the danger
zone. Thereafter he passed into Madame's salon, where the noble
players were already assembled, de Guiche amongst them, awaiting
the advent of the royal protagonist. The gloom of the august
countenance under its heavy curled black wig chilled the gaiety of
that gathering. There was a portentous wrinkle between his brows,
and the heavy Austrian lip which he inherited from his mother
seemed thrust forward more than usual. The light chatter died down,
the laughter perished.</p>
<p>'Sirs and ladies, we shall not rehearse today. You have leave to
go.'</p>
<p>The natural harshness of his voice was unusually pronounced, his
haughtiness was more than ever forbidding. They withdrew,
wondering.</p>
<p>He remained closeted with his sister-in-law, so that he might
read her a little homily on seemly circumspection. And despite the
gentleness he brought to his ungentle theme, although he tempered
his chidings by expressions of his own deep affection for her, she
was in tears when at last he took his departure.</p>
<p>It is not to be doubted that already in these early days de
Guiche had earned her regard. What we may doubt is whether it would
have developed as it did but for the obstacles now thrown in its
path. Love, as we all know, is not only impatient of barriers, it
is challenged and stimulated by them.</p>
<p>Love's agent now was Mademoiselle de Montalais, one of Madame's
maids of honour, a handsome, intriguing creature, to whom she was
deeply attached. Her part in the affair is curious: complex in
itself, it introduces another of those complexities with which this
story abounds.</p>
<p>Among the several moths fluttering around the candle of Madame's
coquettish beauty was another of Monsieur's gentlemen, the
handsome, guileful, unscrupulous Count de Vardes. Now Monsieur de
Vardes was secretly betrothed to Mademoiselle de Montalais, and
Mademoiselle de Montalais, whose sight was quickened by jealousy,
detected that which de Vardes kept sedulously concealed. With the
object of definitely engaging Madame's attention elsewhere, the
astute, intriguing maid of honour offered her services to de Guiche
for the advancement of his desperate suit. De Guiche was on the
point of departure, dismissed by the King from Fontainebleau on the
ground of his having been wanting in respect to Monsieur.</p>
<p>As a result, on the morning after that affair of the rehearsal,
you behold La Montalais closeted with Madame, telling her in moving
accents the sad story of de Guiche's banishment to Paris. Madame
was touched. She was but eighteen. She sighed.</p>
<p>'We shall miss him,' she said. 'Ah!&mdash;How we shall miss him!
What will our parties be without him?' She sighed again, and her
blue eyes grew pensive, wistful. 'Poor de Guiche!'</p>
<p>'You would say so, indeed, if you could have seen him. The poor
fellow was in desolation.'</p>
<p>'Ah? Does he then love the gaiety and frivolity of Fontainebleau
so much?'</p>
<p>La Montalais' face expressed astonishment. 'Your highness is
pleased to be cruel.'</p>
<p>'You find me cruel? In what?'</p>
<p>'Does your highness need to ask? Why, then, you'll find the
answer here.' And abruptly she proffered a letter.</p>
<p>Madame shrank back, a little scared, as if the touch of the
thing must have burned her.</p>
<p>'Why? What is it?'</p>
<p>This poor de Guiche's heart, the distillation of its passion
poured out for you. Take it, Madame, of your pity. I promised him
you should. In his despair he would have killed himself if I had
not promised.'</p>
<p>'Monsieur de Guiche presumes to write to me?' She frowned. 'What
can Monsieur de Guiche wish to say to me?'</p>
<p>'Does your heart whisper nothing, Madame?'</p>
<p>'Oh, you are mad, Montalais! I will not touch it. Take it away.
Give it back to him.'</p>
<p>'He has gone, Madame, gone into exile with his load of longings,
cheered only by the conviction that this would reach you.'</p>
<p>'Then send it after him.'</p>
<p>'That were to kill him, Madame, this unfortunate boy who loves
you to distraction. Would you rob him of the little crumb of
comfort he has taken to sustain him against despair?'</p>
<p>'I will not touch the letter.' Madame spoke with decision, and
turned away.</p>
<p>'Very well. Do not touch it. Do not receive it. But hear it. At
least hear it.' And the impudent maid of honour broke the seal.</p>
<p>'What are you doing?' cried Madame, in genuine alarm.</p>
<p>'I will not be a party to his death.' La Montalais spread the
sheet. 'Hear it, Madame.' And she began to read: 'Madame, On my
knees I beseech you to heed the piteous lament of an unfortunate
condemned to dwell in darkness, since to him all places are dark
that are not lighted by your radiant presence.'</p>
<p>From that poetical beginning you surmise the rest. I need quote
no more.</p>
<p>Madame was blushing furiously before that reading was done, and
there was a moisture about eyes that had become oddly tender. She
had breathed an incense that few women can, resist; and lovelessly
bound as she was to a creature utterly unloving and unlovable, this
incense intoxicated her a little. But for all her youth and
coquetry, she had a deal of good sense and worldly wisdom, and she
perceived the dangers that might await her did she go the way this
passionate rhetoric beckoned. Valiantly she steeled herself against
it, and so that she might not further be exposed to its
allurements, she firmly refused in the days that followed to
receive the further letters with which love's exile in Paris kept
bombarding La Montalais.</p>
<p>About a fortnight later it happened that as a result of a chill
that Madame had contracted in that garden theatre, her physician
found her ailing. He pronounced the air of Fontainebleau unsuited,
recommended that she should return to Paris.</p>
<p>As she was setting out, La Montalais approached her litter,
tossed into her lap a bundle made up of all those unread letters
that had been arriving from de Guiche, and fled before Madame could
thrust them back upon her. Madame was thus left with the letters
for travelling companions. The journey was long and tedious. She
may have resisted awhile the temptation they offered. But in the
end she read them. Their fervour and worship so went to her head
that by the time she reached the Tuileries she forgot to be angry
with La Montalais.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this, de Guiche now daily presented himself at the
Tuileries. He did not succeed in seeing her because she was ill,
but he continued to write, and his letters reached her through La
Montalais. Distractions were devised for her by her ladies, and one
day, to beguile the tedium of her confinement, a fortune-telling
old woman, lean and bowed, was introduced to her apartments. In a
cracked, raucous, and quavering voice the sibyl startled Madame by
the tale of passion on her behalf that was slowly killing a young
man, whom she described in detail. The portrait thus painted
resembled beyond possibility of misapprehension Armand de
Guiche.</p>
<p>Madame lay back on her pillows dreaming, whilst the
fortune-teller was yielding to the importunities of the maids of
honour, and lifting for each a corner of the veil of Fate. Madame
de Valentinois had been staggered by the accuracy of the
revelations made to her, and then Madame de Soissons was being
similarly astounded, when suddenly there was an outcry from one of
the maids of honour, and the mention of a name that made Madame
tremble. She sat up in time to behold the fortune-teller in flight,
no longer bent double, but erect, with petticoats raised to the
knees to give freedom of action to a pair of legs too shapely and
muscular for an aged sibyl. It was de Guiche, the rash, imprudent,
noble actor, who had undertaken this rash travesty that he might
approach the lady of his sighs.</p>
<p>Despite the secrecy to which Madame passionately pledged her
ladies, the story got abroad, so that presently, when the Court
returned to Paris, nothing else was talked of. It alarmed several
persons, and none more than de Vardes, who realised that in de
Guiche he had a rival whose recklessness would stop at nothing. As
his friend, de Vardes approached de Guiche's father, the Marshal de
Gramont. He represented to him the grave danger into which Armand's
unrestrained passion was leading him, and urged the Marshal, as he
loved his son, to remove him. As a consequence, the Marshal applied
to the King to give de Guiche, whose valour and military talents
were famous, command of the troops of Lorraine at Nancy. Thus, for
safety, the young man was to be sent into the firing-line.</p>
<p>The King, welcoming this solution of a difficult situation, very
readily granted the application. Himself, Louis informed Madame,
stating, for her good as he believed, that the appointment had been
granted to de Guiche as a means of gratifying his boundless
military ambition.</p>
<p>That Madame loved de Guiche could hardly yet be said. But at
least she found the flattery of his devotion very sweet, and she
was capable of jealousy of any rival, not excluding military
ambition. She unburdened herself to La Montalais.</p>
<p>'Now we know the real worth of this great devotion, this
master-passion which Monsieur de Guiche's letters protest!' She
smiled bitterly. 'He casts it aside very readily for military
glory, too readily to convince me ever again of its sincerity. I
hope that he will never presume to write to me or to approach me
again.'</p>
<p>From this attitude La Montalais could not move her. The fact
itself was more convincing far than any argument La Montalais could
urge. Therefore the maid of honour sought de Guiche with the report
of it, and from de Guiche returned to Madame with the young man's
passionate answer.</p>
<p>'It is false that he solicited the command. Though at any other
time he must welcome so great a chance of military distinction, at
present he accounts it the greatest hardship that could befall him.
The appointment has been thrust upon him at the instances of his
father, to remove him from the dangers which his love for your
highness are creating for him here. But he bids me say that since
you regard as a desertion that which to him is the cruelest of
exiles, he will inform the King that he declines an appointment
which he has not requested.'</p>
<p>Madame started up at that in genuine alarm. 'But that would be
to ruin himself!'</p>
<p>'So I told him,' said La Montalais. 'But he vows that he will
gladly be ruined rather than have you doubt him.'</p>
<p>'It must not be. It must not be!'</p>
<p>'Will you see him, Madame, and tell him so?'</p>
<p>'See him?' Madame was breathless, appalled. 'How could I dare,
after all that has happened? You must bring him to reason,
Montalais.'</p>
<p>'Madame, he will listen to no persuasion but your own. You do
not yet know him or the strength of his devotion.'</p>
<p>This brought Madame to wring her hands in distress. Finally she
compromised by writing to him.</p>
<p>That first letter from her, written to save him from ruin,
filled him at once with joy and despair, with joy that it showed
her solicitude on his behalf, with despair that it desired him to
retain the appointment and go to Nancy. He consented, but only with
the condition that she should accord him an interview before he
left.</p>
<p>Montalais conveyed the message. It was an indiscretion that
Madame was reluctant to commit. But she was, in a sense, in check.
Unless she did as he demanded he would deliberately and irrevocably
ruin himself with the King, and she must have his ruin on her
conscience.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that one day at noon, La Monta-lais
introduced the muffled de Guiche by a back stair into the Palace of
the Louvre, where the Court was then in residence, and shut him up
in an oratory.</p>
<p>Presently, dinner being at an end, and on the pretext of
resting, Madame withdrew to a gallery upon which this oratory
opened.</p>
<p>To her, leaning for support on the overmantel of the great
cowled chimney above the empty fireplace, came the ardent young
lover. He cast himself upon his knees so that in that becoming
posture he might pour out some of the passion that for months had
been consuming him.</p>
<p>And then, abruptly, whilst he was still at the beginnings of
that tender tale, La Montalais, who had placed herself on guard,
rushed in upon them with the alarming news that Monsieur was
approaching.</p>
<p>De Guiche leapt to his feet, pale now with fear for Madame, who
must be so deeply compromised. Escape was impossible. To seek
concealment in the oratory was but to increase the dangers that
must wait upon discovery. Madame, white to the lips, looked at him
with eyes of despair.</p>
<p>And then in the last second, his ready wit availed him. He went
up the chimney, to the havoc of the shimmering suit of ivory satin
in which he had come to that assignation.</p>
<p>Limp and almost hysterical, Madame sank to the nearest chair as
the doors opened to admit Monsieur. He came alone. He stood at gaze
a moment, on the threshold, raking the gallery with his furious
glance. Then, baffled, he stepped slowly forward. Madame controlled
herself to regard him with inquiry.</p>
<p>'You are alone, Madame?'</p>
<p>'Not quite, Monsieur. Mademoiselle de Montalais is with me, as
you perceive.'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes&mdash;Mademoiselle de Montalais!' The little fop almost
snarled as he uttered the name of the maid of honour. 'And no one
else, of course?'</p>
<p>'Do you perceive anyone else, Monsieur?'</p>
<p>Monsieur looked about him again, a frown wrinkling his brow.</p>
<p>'It is very odd,' he said. He took a turn in the gallery. He
came to the door of the oratory, pulled it open abruptly, and
peered in.</p>
<p>'You are seeking something, Monsieur?'</p>
<p>He slammed the door of the empty oratory, and turned. A mirror
confronted him. Inevitably he considered himself, posturing a
little.</p>
<p>'I am seeking your lover, Madame,' he snapped, with venom.</p>
<p>'You should not look in the mirror for him, Monsieur.'</p>
<p>He started and crimsoned under his rouge, partly because
detected in self-worship, partly because of the satirical
implication in the words.</p>
<p>'I have long been aware of it, Madame.' He came forward and
stood over her chair. It was a moment or two before he spoke again.
'You are trifling with me, I think.'</p>
<p>'In what way, if you please, Monsieur?'</p>
<p>He still looked about, and even peered under the furniture. 'You
had a visitor. No use to deny it. Where is he?'</p>
<p>By now she had made a good recovery of her self-possession. She
regarded him calmly.</p>
<p>'I came here to rest, Monsieur. I have a slight headache. I
should be glad to be spared these impertinences.'</p>
<p>'Ah! But you do not deny that you had a visitor?'</p>
<p>'You told me, I think, that it would be no use to deny.'</p>
<p>'Tchah!' Monsieur was becoming really angry. He swung away from
her. A patch of soot lay on the bare hearth. His eye considered
it.</p>
<p>Observing this, Madame shivered. Observing her shiver, he smiled
unpleasantly.</p>
<p>'You are cold, Madame. You should order them to make you a
fire.'</p>
<p>The panic of her glance must have betrayed her to a man of
vision. But Monsieur was not possessed of any. The patch of soot
was just a patch of soot to his dull mind. He retired baffled and
savage. He knew that he had been fooled; for the information
afforded by his spies admitted of no doubt.</p>
<p>Some of his rage he vented upon the maid of honour. It lay in
his power to remove her from attendance upon Madame, and remove her
he did, packing her off to a convent at Fonterrault. Then he
complained furiously to the King, and procured as a result His
Majesty's intervention. Louis extracted a promise from his
sister-in-law that she would make an end of her relations with de
Guiche, who by then had already departed for the wars.</p>
<p>Events conspired to help her to keep that promise&mdash;events
and de Vardes. With the object of curing the young man of his
infatuation, this friend wrote to inform him that Madame's coquetry
had readily found for him a successor, and later he added that this
successor had been sent into exile on her account. These letters
came to fill de Guiche, now campaigning with distinction in
Lorraine, with a fury of jealousy and disdain. In the heat of
passion, and to vent his bitter feelings, he wrote back to de
Vardes unforgivable things of Madame in a letter which did not
reveal how these expressions had come to be provoked. That letter
the intriguing de Vardes showed to Madame. Into the ready ear of
the anger thus aroused, he whispered a suggestion that such a man
as de Guiche was dangerous. If it should happen that he had in his
possession any letters from Madame, she would be wise to take
immediate steps for their recovery. In her alarm and urgent need of
a friend, Madame availed herself of de Vardes' offer to recover
those letters. He wrote for them in such terms that de
Guiche&mdash;conceiving himself heartbroken and
disillusioned&mdash;returned them instantly. If anything had been
wanting to complete Madame's assurance that she had reached the end
of a poetical but dangerous romance, it was this. That ready
surrender of those precious letters wounded her deeply.</p>
<p>And now de Guiche, grown reckless of his life, distinguished
himself at the war, and the court rang with the stories of his
exploits. The fall of Marsal brought his work in Lorraine to a
victorious end, and he might have returned home. Instead, however,
driven to seek forgetfulness in action, and conceiving that life
had now nothing to offer him beyond military glory, he obtained
permission to go to Poland, and there engaged himself in the war
with the Muscovites.</p>
<p>His name and a mention of his deeds arose one night at the
King's supper-table, when Monsieur, Madame, de Vardes, and the
Chevalier de Lorraine were of the party. It was the latter who, to
indulge his hatred of Henrietta, maliciously introduced the Count's
name, praising his exploits as a commencement.</p>
<p>'I hear,' he said, 'that there is no man so reckless of his life
in all the Polish army.'</p>
<p>'But a charm protects him,' put in Monsieur de Vieuville, who
was a friend of de Guiche's. 'That, too, is notorious. In fact, at
this moment he owes his preservation to a miracle.'</p>
<p>'A miracle!' echoed Lorraine. 'That is a little strong.'</p>
<p>'Judge for yourself. In a recent engagement, he was struck over
the heart by a Muscovite bullet. He was saved by a lady's portrait
in a stout gold case, which covered the part it mainly affected.
The portrait and the case were smashed to fragments, but de Guiche
went unscathed.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Lorraine sneered. 'It is not often that gallantry
serves a man so well. May one ask the name of the lady to whom he
may be said to owe his preservation?'</p>
<p>He spoke with an eye on Madame, who sat forward with parted lips
and startled glance. The King interposed harshly.</p>
<p>'That is a question the inquisitive will ask, but no gentleman
will answer.'</p>
<p>'I thank you, sire,' said Vieuville.</p>
<p>The Chevalier stifled a yawn.</p>
<p>'Well, well,' said he, this poor de Guiche's exploits are not
likely to continue to afford us entertainment, unless another
miracle occurs.' Again his glance sought Henrietta's pale face.
There was the faintest smile about the corners of his lips. And
then, to relieve the general suspense, he delivered his evil news.
'We have just learnt that after performing prodigies of valour, he
is cut off with a portion of the Polish army, and so reduced that
it is impossible he should ever save himself. They say&mdash;' He
broke off, and sprang up in feigned alarm. 'Madame, you are
ill!'</p>
<p>Ashen-faced, she had sunk back in her chair with closed eyes,
her breathing momentarily suspended. Alarm at the attention drawn
so maliciously to her condition stimulated her to an effort to
regain control of her lapsing senses.</p>
<p>She looked round at those countenances&mdash;sneering,
malicious, grave, concerned&mdash;beheld as through a mist, and
faltered something of the stifling heat of the room.</p>
<p>Whether Monsieur de Lorraine had deliberately overstated the
case to shock her into self-betrayal, or whether de Guiche's
courage and resource were of a quality to overcome all
difficulties, the fact remains that the young Count did not die in
Poland. Within a few months, towards the end of that year 1664, he
was back at last in Paris, safe and sound but for the loss of two
fingers of his right hand. He was about the Court, but it was long
before he made any attempt to see Madame. When eventually, spurred
by the tale of the events at that royal supper-table, he
endeavoured to do so, Madame, out of loyalty to her pledge to the
King, refused to receive him.</p>
<p>Other reasons apart, she had cause at the moment to do nothing
that should jeopardise her good relations with Louis. She enjoyed
his confidence in State matters, and she was acting by now as the
agent at the Court of France for her brother Charles II. She was
employing her active wits to bring about between England and France
an alliance desired by both sovereigns, and she made herself the
channel through which Louis conducted with Charles a correspondence
on secret State matters from which the talkative numskull Philip
was excluded.</p>
<p>Had anything been wanted further to embitter the relations
between herself and her contemptible husband, this circumstance
supplied it. Philip's conception of affairs of State was that they
were the family affairs of the royal house of France, and behind
Philip to foster this conception was Philip's master, the arrogant,
ambitious Chevalier de Lorraine. To find himself excluded from
matters which were not merely divulged to his wife, but in which
his wife was invited to discharge an important part, was more than
Philip's vanity could endure without protest. Protest he did,
loudly and vehemently, supported by Monsieur de Lorraine and the
Queen-Mother, and as a consequence the most violent and unseemly
quarrels came to trouble the harmony of the royal family.</p>
<p>To make an end, the exasperated and never long-suffering Louis
sent Monsieur de Lorraine into exile. It was in vain that Philip
screamed, wept, and finally fainted in the violence of his
affliction at this separation from his dearest friend. Louis had
spoken, and Lorraine must go&mdash;and go Lorraine did, to chew the
cud of his rancour in Italy.</p>
<p>Louis soothed the grief of his brother by material
gifts&mdash;as we soothe a child for the loss of one toy by the
bestowal of another. In part he succeeded, and he would have
succeeded entirely but for Lorraine's foresight and provision. The
Chevalier had taken care to leave two of his creatures behind him
in Philip's service, his equerry, d'Effiaut, and Beuvron, who held
the office of Captain of Monsieur's guards.</p>
<p>Through these agents, the exiled Chevalier&mdash;who attached
the whole blame of his banishment to Madame, and hated her the more
in consequence&mdash;continued to maintain his dominion over
Philip. Through them he urged Philip, when presently the project
arose, to oppose his wife's going to England with Louis to
negotiate the secret treaty between France and Charles II.</p>
<p>But by then other things had happened to widen the breach
between husband and wife. Fate interfered to frustrate all Madame's
intentions never again to see Monsieur de Guiche.</p>
<p>It happened that Madame de Vieuville gave a masked ball at
Versailles, which Monsieur elected to honour with his presence,
desiring Madame to bear him company. To ensure their remaining
unrecognised, they went in a hired coach very plainly dressed. They
found the room thronged with maskers, with whom, at Monsieur's
suggestion, they indiscriminately mingled. Among these Fate had
placed the masked de Guiche. Suddenly his nostrils were assailed by
a faint perfume as of lilac, an unforgettable perfume that
intoxicated him with the memories it aroused. He tracked it to a
slight woman in a black, dissembling cloak, and in his momentary
exultation he caught her hand in his. And just as the unusual
perfume that she used announced to him her identity, so did his
crippled hand, reminding her that de Guiche had lost two fingers in
Poland, proclaim his identity to her.</p>
<p>There may have been more than these poor physical indications.
There may have been some subtler current set in motion by that
contact. Suffice it that in that moment each knew the other, and
that as hand in hand they advanced together, and ascended the great
staircase, they were so overcome by emotion that neither could find
a word to say.</p>
<p>Thus at first. But presently de Guiche, now reckless, drew his
masked companion to an alcove in the gallery above the stair.
Explanations followed. The portrait that had preserved his life in
Poland was her own.</p>
<p>'Better,' he cried, 'that it should not have saved me if I have
only lived to find the original cruel. But then I heard that when I
was accounted lost, you showed distress. I have hoped from
that&mdash;hoped that we should one day come face to face as we are
now, and the blessed truth should bridge the gulf that falsehood
and misfortune have dug between us.'</p>
<p>And then, as once before, in the gallery at the Louvre, they
were warned of Monsieur's approach, warned by his shrill, querulous
voice. He was advancing unmasked, on his host's arm, seeking the
duchess.</p>
<p>In her alarm, Madame swung round and sprang away. Her high heel
caught in a rug at the entrance of the alcove, and she was suddenly
precipitated forward. But for the promptitude of de Guiche's action
she must have fallen. As it was, he caught the slender, graceful
figure in his arms. Thus, fortuitously, they came by their first
and last embrace, and this under the very eyes of Monsieur, who at
that instant stepped round the angle of the gallery fully into
view.</p>
<p>There are appearances which it is worse than idle to attempt to
explain away. The scandal was terrible, and it made an end of even
the semblance of harmony between that ill-mated pair. Philip as
usual went bleating for vengeance to his omnipotent brother. Louis
sought Henrietta, and reproached her with having broken the pledge
she had given him. She met his reproaches with the exact account of
what had happened, and was believed.</p>
<p>The old Marshal de Gramont, terrified by the event, made
arrangements to pack off his son to Holland, and de Guiche, abed
with a fever just then, yielded to his father's entreaties and
consented to go so soon as he should be well enough to take the
road.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the King was preparing for his journey to England,
and Madame was making ready to accompany him in spite of the
continued opposition of Monsieur (prompted ever by the absent
Chevalier de Lorraine). A few days before departure, as her
carriage was entering the Louvre, it was arrested by the signal of
a man who wore the livery of La Vallière. This lackey, as if to
deliver a message, approached and opened the carriage door.</p>
<p>Surprised by this, Madame looked up, and barely repressed an
outcry. The supposed lackey wore the countenance of Armand de
Guiche. It was a countenance deathly pale, with dark stains about
eyes aglitter with the fever that was consuming him, and in spite
of which he had left his bed.</p>
<p>'Monsieur!' she gasped, clutching her heart, herself blenching.
Yet she controlled her voice, so that her grooms should not
overhear her. 'Ah, Dieu, what an imprudence! You will ruin us
both!'</p>
<p>'Madame!' he answered her, with grave sorrow, 'it may be for the
last time. You are going to England, and I am going to Holland,
lest by remaining in France I should be driven in my despair to do
that which might recoil to your hurt. It is possible, Madame, that
we may never meet again. But I could not go without seeing you once
more, without a word of farewell, without telling you that in thus
exiling myself I am giving you proof of a love and devotion which
is ready to make the last sacrifice for your good.'</p>
<p>Emotion suffocated her. She pressed his hand in silence. Tears
sprang to her eyes.</p>
<p>'Ah, do not weep, Madame. Do not...' His senses swam. His
despair and the fever so wrought upon him jointly that he reeled
back, sagged together, and sank down, unconscious.</p>
<p>Perhaps her greatest suffering lay in that she dared not obey
the impulse to step down to his assistance. She sat there in agony
whilst her grooms raised him. In agony she went on, leaving him
still unconscious, since to have betrayed a greater interest in
this pseudo-lackey must have led to his recognition.</p>
<p>They never met again. A few days later, in May of that year
1670, she set out for England with her royal brother-in-law. As far
as Lille they made a great train, being accompanied by the Court,
and travelling through a deluge of rain. Here at Lille, Philip took
his leave of her. There was in his farewell no relenting of the
cold hostility that, beginning with the exile of Lorraine, had
since grown steadily, nourished by the subsequent events.</p>
<p>'You go then in spite of all that I can say, in defiance of my
wishes?' he challenged her sourly.</p>
<p>'Since it is the will of His Majesty, and since my going may be
of advantage to both England and France. What choice have I?'</p>
<p>It was to stab him in his most tender spot, this reminder of the
bitter fact so often stated by Lorraine, that she was of importance
in State matters, in which he was of less than none. He winced, and
looked her over sneering.</p>
<p>'You are pale,' he said. 'I don't believe your health is very
good.'</p>
<p>'I am none too well, Monsieur.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' A smile broke over his painted face. 'An astrologer once
told me that I shall have several wives. When I look at you,
Madame, I can well believe it.'</p>
<p>That was the amiable tenor of their leave-taking. She was three
weeks at Dover with the two kings, and it was known on her return
that a treaty had been negotiated whose import, however, still
remained a secret. She came back to her husband and her loveless
married life at Saint-Cloud towards the end of June.</p>
<p>On the very evening of her arrival there she complained of pains
in the stomach. In spite of them, however, she pursued her ordinary
life, and on Friday the twenty-seventh June, which was very hot,
she went to bathe in the river as was her custom. She was taken ill
on the evening of the following Sunday, soon after drinking her
usual glass of chicory water. Her ladies put her to bed in great
pain, and presently Monsieur came to pay her a visit. Writhing in
agony, she told him that she was poisoned&mdash;she believed by the
chicory water&mdash;and implored them to give her an antidote.</p>
<p>Madame de Lafayette, who was present, tells us that Monsieur
looked neither concerned nor embarrassed. Calmly he ordered that
the water should be tried on a dog, and that oil and an antidote be
administered to Madame. We do not know what happened to the dog, or
whether the experiment was made. Upon Madame the suggested remedies
were of no effect. Her agony continued.</p>
<p>The King came in alarm and grief, bringing his physicians, who
found themselves completely baffled by her condition. It was seen
that she was dying. Yet her brave spirit sustained her. She smiled
at Louis, and permitted herself in that supreme hour a jest at the
expense of the etiquette by which every act of the royal life was
governed.</p>
<p>'I will do my best, sire, to die according to rules.'</p>
<p>Louis left her bedside in tears.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the morning, in the very prime of life, at
the early age of twenty-six, she died, declaring that her only
regret in leaving this life was concerned with the pain it must
cause her brother, Charles of England, whom she had so dearly loved
and for whom she had unremittingly laboured.</p>
<p>Scarcely was the news of it carried to the afflicted Louis than
he summoned Brissac, the captain of his guard, and ordered him at
once and in secret to fetch Purnon, the master of Madame's
household.</p>
<p>The trembling man was introduced to the room where the agitated
King paced to and fro in long strides. Louis came to halt before
him, terrible of voice and mien.</p>
<p>'Listen carefully, my friend. Tell me the whole truth of what I
wish to know, and whatever your own part in it, you shall be
forgiven, and the matter shall never be mentioned again. But
conceal the least thing, and you are a dead man. Madame has been
poisoned?'</p>
<p>Terrified on the one hand by the sternness of the royal threat,
fortified on the other by the royal promise, the man answered
promptly as required.</p>
<p>'Yes, sire!'</p>
<p>'By whom and how?'</p>
<p>'The Chevalier de Lorraine sent the poison to Beuvron and
d'Effiaut. It was put into Madame's chicory water.'</p>
<p>Not a muscle moved in the King's face. But it had grown deathly
pale, and there was a gleam of sweat on his brow.</p>
<p>'And my brother? Did he know of this?'</p>
<p>'No, sire. None would be fool enough to tell him. He can keep no
secret. He would have ruined us all.'</p>
<p>It was an answer of uncommon daring, but it carried conviction
as nothing less could have done. The King caught his breath audibly
in inexpressible relief, like a man to whom on the point of
stifling air is suddenly restored.</p>
<p>'Ha!' He paused, and then dismissed the fellow. 'That is all I
wanted to know.'</p>
<p>To satisfy his desperate need to know how far his brother might
be implicated, he had pledged his royal word that he would take no
action. Because of this, and because also she was the sister of the
king with whom the alliance sought might be rendered difficult,
there could be no admission that she had been poisoned. But the
rumours of it were abroad, and reached the ears of her sorrowing
brother in Whitehall. They moved him to a passion expressed in such
terms to the French ambassador that he feared a breach of the
alliance upon which it might almost be said that the life of
Charles depended. Louis sent an embassy to tranquillize him and
convince him that his dearly loved Minetta had died of cholera.</p>
<p>Thus Henrietta remained unavenged.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>THE VAGABOND QUEEN</h2>
<p>In the long chamber known as the Gallery of the Stags in the
Palace of Fontainebleau, two gentlemen who detested each other
paced in talk. They were Monaldeschi, the equerry, and Santinelli,
the chamberlain of her vagabond Majesty of Sweden. They were the
chief members of a retinue pathetically shrunken to a few
foreigners of small account since Queen Christina, by embracing the
Catholic Faith, had alienated the Swedes of birth who at first had
made up her court in exile.</p>
<p>Monaldeschi dissembled his hatred in amiabilities. He was
naturally of a fawning and effusive manner, and the sallow aquiline
face, framed in a heavy black periwig, had settled almost
permanently into smiling creases. His voice was drawlingly
caressing.</p>
<p>'To be condemned to the flat dullness of Fontainebleau at this
time of year! For myself I can support it. I matter little. But I
grieve for Her Majesty, dishonoured by this shabby hospitality. Oh,
and I grieve for you, my dear Carlo. Dio Santo! Your brightness was
never meant to rust in this provincial neglect.'</p>
<p>Santinelli scarcely troubled to be civil. The younger and taller
of the twain, a man slenderly athletic, he carried in his narrow,
handsome face the gloom of a saturnine reserve.</p>
<p>'You are too amiable,' he protested; but his tone was flat. 'I
was always of the opinion that it was a mistake to return so soon
to France.'</p>
<p>'How wise you always are,' fawned Monaldeschi. 'I would I had
your foresight, dear Carlo.'</p>
<p>'I would you trusted it. Then you might have helped me to
dissuade Her Majesty.'</p>
<p>'You have the right to reproach me.' The equerry sighed in
humility. 'But who could have foreseen this contemptuous treatment,
this relegation to the wilderness? I vow to God the King of France
is forever shamed by it.'</p>
<p>The Count shrugged. 'How is the King of France concerned? It is
Mazarin, the ignoble lay priest, the un-tonsured Cardinal, who puts
this humiliation upon Her Majesty.'</p>
<p>'A low fellow,' said Monaldeschi heartily. 'An upstart
vassal.'</p>
<p>He would have added more but for the interruption of a summons
brought by a lackey in a livery of blue and yellow.</p>
<p>In instant obedience they passed from the gallery into a small
room that was hung with sombre tapestries, and the presence of a
seated person whom at first glance you might have supposed to be a
man. A man's wide black hat, with a trailing red plume covered a
man's black periwig, rather out of curl. A man's coat, untidily
worn, of black satin with gold and silver embroidery, clothed the
body to the throat, and a man's shirt displayed its full sleeves
from the elbow and bulged in male fashion at the waist. Below this
a short petticoat corrected the first impression and proclaimed the
real sex. The face would scarcely have done so but for its plaster
of pomatum and powder to overlay its gipsy tint. It was a big face,
slightly pockmarked, with bold features: the mouth was wide and
full-lipped, and of the nose Bachaumont has said that it was as
long as her foot. The eyes, large and lustrous, alone attracted
where all else repelled.</p>
<p>This astonishing, androgynous person was Christina of Sweden in
the thirty-first year of her age.</p>
<p>It was four years since she had startled Europe by abdicating
the splendid heritage from her great father, Gustavus Adolphus, who
in collaboration with the famous Chancellor Oxenstierna had raised
Sweden to the position of one of the greatest powers of Europe. The
glory achieved had rendered Gustavus Adolphus the more eager for a
son who might continue it. As if to cheat his disappointment during
the few years by which he survived Christina's birth, he had reared
her and treated her as if she had been a male. After he was killed
at Lutzen, this treatment was continued from respect for what may
have been conceived his wishes, and his daughter was given an
education entirely masculine and subjected to a virile discipline
concerned with masculine accomplishments.</p>
<p>Unsexed thereby, her perspective falsified, she grew up an
egomaniac, with an exaggerated sense of her talents, which were by
no means inconsiderable, and of her royal consequence. Her fierce
jealousy of Oxenstierna's genius counterbalanced in its results the
good that it was in her to perform. The difficulties she created
for that great statesman, the intemperance of her spirit, and her
vainglorious prodigality wrought such havoc in Sweden that her
abdication, which the great Chancellor welcomed in the end, would
never have been resisted by him, as at first it was, but for his
mistrust of her cousin Charles Gustavus, who was next in the
succession.</p>
<p>The avowed motive of that abdication was a desire for freedom so
that she might devote herself to the arts and sciences; whilst the
insatiable desire to be a focus for the eyes of the world spurred
her onward in a renunciation so startling and magnificent that she
conceived it must leave humanity aghast.</p>
<p>But whilst renouncing active sovereignty, it was no part of her
intention to surrender any of its advantages. To support her royal
rank abroad there was a pension from a treasury which she had all
but reduced to bankruptcy. n addition, she carried off with her a
shipload of plunder in the shape of pictures, bronzes, jewels, and
gold and silver plate, as coolly as if this furniture of the Kings
of Sweden had been her personal property. Since the coveted
residence in Rome would have been uncomfortable for a heretic, she
supplied Europe with yet another sensation by embracing the
Catholic Faith. The step was taken with great pomp at Innsbruck. As
readily would she have become a Buddhist if it could have profited
her. Nor had she any illusions on the score of her attitude towards
religion.</p>
<p>'If there is really a God it may be very awkward for me,' she is
reported once to have confessed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile things were quite awkward enough as a result of her
change of faith. Her subsidy from Sweden had immediately ceased,
and as her extravagance had already dissipated the plunder she had
carried off, she would have been in desperate case had not the
Pope's Holiness conceived it proper to compensate her by a pension
for having chosen&mdash;as her action was construed&mdash;to
exchange a corruptible earthly crown for an incorruptible one
hereafter.</p>
<p>And now, at the end of four years of wandering and after some
startling vicissitudes, she sat at Fontainebleau in the chill of a
November day with a bitter sense that her royal mantle, already a
little threadbare, was being trailed in squalor. She had been made
aware of it by a letter from Cardinal Azzolini.</p>
<p>The Cardinal wrote from Rome in deep concern, to warn her that
the Eternal City was agog with stories of her transactions, so
defamatory that they might come to raise an obstacle to her return.
His eminence entered into details. One of the stories accused her
of scandalous relations with Don Antonio Pimentel, who had been
ambassador of Spain to Sweden, and who, after her abdication, had
been constantly at her side in Brussels.</p>
<p>She could laugh at the absurd malice that assigned her as a
lover the elderly, bald-headed, flat-faced Don Antonio, who
actually had been the chief agent of her conversion to Rome and who
had ensured her the friendship of the Pope.</p>
<p>There were other matters, however, in the letter at which she
could not laugh. It did not amuse her to read that she was widely
reported to be mistaking for fame the absurd notoriety she had won,
and for homage the curiosity which her eccentricities everywhere
excited. Nor did it amuse her to learn that a derisive story was
being made of her torchlight entrance into Paris a year ago, in
male attire, astride of a white horse. But there was something
infinitely worse. There was matter that rubbed salt into the wound
her vanity had suffered from her present reception in France,
cruelly publishing a humiliation which she was most anxious should
be hidden from the outer world.</p>
<p>The intimate accuracy of the details confirmed Cardinal
Azzolini's suggestion that her defamer must be some person closely
in her confidence. Closest in this, as in her favour (which was the
source of the bitter rivalry between them), were Monaldeschi and
Santinelli. Her soul revolted against suspecting either of them.
Her attenuated following included further a half-dozen other
gentlemen, all from the States of the Church, any of whom knew
enough of her situation to be the author of those infamous reports.
Yet in her search for the culprit she must begin with the two who
enjoyed her special intimacy, with the two who dared to combine
service to the Queen with ardent devotion to the woman.</p>
<p>Her heavy jaws were grimly set and her big handsome eyes had no
smile for them as they stood now before her.</p>
<p>'My friends,' she said, her voice harsh and masculine, 'I have
sent for you on a plaguey unsavoury matter. There is a betrayer
about me, an accursed Judas who eats my bread whilst he defames me,
tarnishing my glory with the infamy of the reports he is sending to
Rome.'</p>
<p>She looked searchingly from one to the other of them. Both faces
had lengthened. Monaldeschi's eternal fawning smile had vanished.
He seemed even to have turned a deeper shade of yellow. But
distress might be the cause of this. He was the first to speak.</p>
<p>'It defies belief, madame. Who is the villain?'</p>
<p>She showed her dark teeth in an angry smile. 'If I knew
that...<i>Mort Diable</i>! I'ld&mdash;' She broke off to ask
him:</p>
<p>'What would you do, Monaldeschi?'</p>
<p>'Kill him with my own hands.' He was gustily fierce. 'Death is
the only punishment.'</p>
<p>Her eyes sought Santinelli's face. 'And you?'</p>
<p>The chamberlain shrugged. It was never easy for him to agree
with Monaldeschi. 'It would be rash to pronounce before knowing the
nature and extent of the betrayal.'</p>
<p>Enraged by the implied rebuke, Monaldeschi almost spat at him.
'Rash, do you say? Betrayal is betrayal.'</p>
<p>He would have pursued the theme, but her gesture checked him.
She spoke coldly, frowning upon Santinelli.</p>
<p>'For a treason that bespatters my royal escutcheon there can be
no mercy. I should not need to tell you that, Count. You'll have
heard of <i>lèse-majesté</i> and what it entails. But since you are
so nice in your judgments that you must first know the nature and
extent of the thing, it has been reported to Rome that I am an
unwelcome guest in France; that I have been ordered to remain here
at Fontainebleau; that the King will not receive me. With this I am
being held up to Roman scorn, to the mockery of the Roman rabble.
That is what my betrayer has done.'</p>
<p>She confined herself straitly to that part of the offence which
had most deeply wounded her. To the matter of Pimentel and the
lesser scandals she made no allusion, deeming them by comparison of
little account.</p>
<p>'What is your judgment now, Santinelli?'</p>
<p>Monaldeschi answered for him, vehemently. 'What judgment can
there be, madame, but that which I have pronounced?'</p>
<p>Since Monaldeschi was so hot, Santinelli must perforce remain
cold. 'It does not seem to follow that it must be someone in your
train. This may be common gossip at the Court of France,
and&mdash;'</p>
<p>He was violently interrupted. '<i>Mort Diable</i>! Did I not
mention details? There are details that leave no doubt.'</p>
<p>'Do they give a clue to the scandal-monger?'</p>
<p>'No. But I shall know how to find him. God will never suffer
such a villain to escape. Meanwhile there is something even more
important than discovering him. It is to slay this defamatory
rumour, to cleanse myself of its stain, by showing it to be false.
Cardinal Mazarin will perceive it. He must. He knows too well what
is due to a Queen to permit me to lie under this shadow. You shall
go to him at Compiègne at once, Santinelli, with a letter from me.
To that letter you will add such arguments as you find necessary
and loyalty prompts, so as to persuade him to remove all barriers
and have the King receive me immediately at court.'</p>
<p>Santinelli was fervent. 'Madame, you may depend upon my devotion
to spare no effort. His eminence shall yield to it.'</p>
<p>She nodded gloomily. 'Whilst you make ready, I'll prepare the
letter. Go now.'</p>
<p>He bowed and went; and whilst her brooding glance watched his
departure, Monaldeschi's glittering eyes observed in her
countenance the suspicion which his rival's manner had aroused. He
was emotionally voluble thereafter full of angry grief for his dear
mistress. Presently she rose, a woman of middle height and ungainly
build. She leaned upon his shoulder familiarly.</p>
<p>'Your fervour, Marquis, comforts me a little. Whilst I am
writing this letter, go and help Santinelli to make ready. I shall
want him to set out at once.'</p>
<p>With his effusive smile he answered her. Santinelli will
scarcely welcome my help.'</p>
<p>'It is my wish that you should render it.' The peculiarity of
her tone made him seek its meaning in her eyes. What he found there
brought a craftiness into his smile, and he departed at once upon
an errand, whose real purport he thought he understood. The Queen
did not desire that Santinelli should be left alone to prepare for
his departure other than by assembling the effects he would
require. He must have no leisure in which to destroy any evidence
that might conceivably exist if he were, indeed, the person guilty
of those letters.</p>
<p>In quest of such evidence, armed with a little bag of keys,
Christina went alone and secretly in the dead of that night to the
absent Santinelli's room. A double purpose had inspired her
dispatch of him upon that mission to the Court at Compiégne.</p>
<p>The search she made was long and thorough. Some letters in a
secretaire detained her for an hour or more. In a heavy fur-edged
mantle wrapped tight against the cold, she sat and read them line
by line. Some were from Santinelli's mother and some,
affectionately couched, from a woman in Pesaro. They answered
letters of his, and they showed that in these he gave news of his
life in the train of the Queen of Sweden; but nowhere could she
discover an indication that the news he gave was of a kind
injurious to her. Rather the contrary, indeed. Satisfied at last,
she replaced the letters where she had found them, and rose. She
had closed the secretaire and turned the key, when her attention
was caught, by a soft patter of steps approaching along the
corridor. She stood alert, listening. Discovery here, if this were
someone seeking Santinelli's room, would betray her purpose, and
give warning to others by whom she intended a similar
investigation. Hastily taking cover behind the curtains of the
great canopied bed, she extinguished her candles.</p>
<p>Through the loose web of the tapestry she saw light reappear in
the room as the door was softly opened and then closed again. With
his\ back against it stood a man in a brocaded bedgown, his head
swathed in a kerchief, holding aloft a candle so as to survey the
chamber. It was Monaldeschi. At that first glimpse of him a glow of
gratitude and affection suffused her. She assumed his purpose to be
the same as her own. Under the spur of his devotion to her he was
at work to discover her betrayer. If her second thought had not
been that rather, perhaps, he acted under the spur of his rivalry
with Santinelli, she would at once have disclosed herself and so
spared him the pains he was about to take.</p>
<p>To her amazement these pains, when taken, seemed utterly
inadequate to his task. His searching eyes had settled immediately
on the secretaire, and he had gone straight to it. As he set down
his candle, she caught the sound of a little cluck of laughter. He
found his task simplified by the key, which in her precipitate
retreat she had left in the lock. She heard the click of it. She
saw his broad back as he bent over the gaping space; she heard the
rustle of his rummaging, the silken swish of an inner drawer being
opened, a crackling of papers, and again that soft little cluck of
laughter. Then, to her surprise, without further search, he closed
and locked the secretaire again, and was departing. But he did not
yet go. He checked, came back, drew the key from the lock, and
after looking about him undecided for a moment, went to deposit it
in the drawer of a clothes-press that stood between the
windows.</p>
<p>Mystified, she waited until the receding sound of his steps had
finally faded. Then softly she crept from her hiding-place. She was
in darkness, but she still clutched her candlestick, and it was
equipped with tinder-box. She struck steel against flint, and blew
upon the smouldering match until it flamed. With her twin candles
once more alight she recovered the key, and, back at the
secretaire, she was seeking what Monaldeschi must have deposited
there. She found it among those papers which once already she had
so carefully sifted: three letters in a pointed, feminine hand,
each superscribed to Count the Most Illustrious Santinelli, Grand
Chamberlain to Her Majesty Queen Christina of Sweden, each dated
from Rome, each beginning Beloved Carlo,' each bearing the
signature 'Anna,' and each in fond terms that announced them for
the letters of a mistress.</p>
<p>She spread the first of them, and as she read her breathing
quickened into gusts of rage.</p>
<p>'I have wept with laughter over your description of the
reception in France of the grotesque woman you serve. She has
earned this contempt by the fanfarronading follies of her previous
visit, when, as you told me, she rode into Paris by torchlight, in
breeches and astride of a white horse. She will have cut as
ridiculous a figure as on that other occasion when she rode a white
horse here in Rome to review the Pontifical troops. Cardinal
Mazarin shows himself a truly faithful guardian of the young King's
dignity in denying this woman a second access to his august
presence and in forbidding her the Court. All Rome is convulsed by
the tale of it. Never a squib of Pasquino's has excited so much
laughter.'</p>
<p>In the second letter that her shaking fingers unfolded, she
read, after the nauseating amorousness of its opening terms: 'I
marvel, dear Carlo, that you should continue in the following of
this extravagant vagrant, who is royal without being noble. It is a
poor service to keep you from my side. She is best left to the
attendance and the gallantries of that old fool the ambassador from
Spain, with whom she made so free in Brussels. You are not to
suppose me jealous. You are not old and bald and ugly like Don
Antonio Pimentel that you should be content to be the lover of such
a humpbacked harridan.'</p>
<p>The third letter was even more scurrilously explicit in the
allusions to her relations with Pimentel which made up a part of
it.</p>
<p>The Queen sat back, chin' in hand, a deep furrow between her
brows. She was almost physically sick from what she had read, and
from the discovery so clear at first that Santinelli, to whom these
vile letters were addressed, was responsible for her defamation in
Rome. But as the heat of her anger cooled, the matter became less
clear. It was Monaldeschi who had placed these letters where she
found them. How had he come by them? Had he forestalled her in that
quest, and having discovered those letters taken them away to read
them? On a sudden thought she leaned forward again, scanning that
pointed feminine hand as if for a key to the puzzle. Here and there
upon it some grains of the pounce with which the writing had been
dusted glinted in the candlelight. Now this was odd in a letter
that had travelled so far and had been freely handled. Mechanically
she rubbed some grains away with her finger. Then, with a catch in
her breath, she held the sheet nearer to the light. There was the
thin nest of black smears where her finger had passed. Under the
pounce the ink had not yet been quite dry. Her quest was at an
end.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning, which was Tuesday the sixth
November of that year 1656, Father Le Bel, the gentle old Prior of
the Mathurins at Fontainebleau, was haled from his convent by a
command to wait upon Her Swedish Majesty.</p>
<p>In her man's coat and hat and wig, as she advanced upon him with
a long mannish stride that partly dissembled a slight lameness,
swinging an ebony cane such as captains carried, this young woman
was a disconcerting sight to Father Le Bel. But he bowed low,
assuring her of his humble obedience.</p>
<p>'You will consider this interview, Father, as under the seal of
confession.'</p>
<p>He bowed again. He stood in proper awe of royalty, even when
abdicated and so fantastically accoutred. 'Your Majesty may trust
me as if I were blind and dumb.'</p>
<p>She handed him a sealed package. 'You will keep this for me
until I send for you again, and you will observe the time and the
day that it is.'</p>
<p>Upon that he was dismissed, and Her Majesty sought distraction.
The weather being bright and crisp, she elected to ride in the
park, and she took Monaldeschi for sole companion, using him with
more than ordinary affection. That evening at supper he presumed
upon this, and in a languishing manner became almost possessive.
Her lack of resentment, the minor familiarities she permitted him,
went far to assure him that at long last, and after many
vicissitudes, he was establishing over her the empire that should
make his fortune.</p>
<p>Fawning of manner, caressingly drawling of speech, with deep
creases about the dark, crafty eyes that closely flanked his
aquiline nose, he came to speak of the betrayal she had
suffered.</p>
<p>She smiled. 'It has ceased to preoccupy me. The mystery is
solved. I have the villain under my hand. In my own time he shall
be brought to expiation.'</p>
<p>'You have discovered him! Now God be thanked.'</p>
<p>'I have returned thanks already. I was oddly guided.' He leaned
across the table, towards her. 'His name, madame?'</p>
<p>Her smile underwent a subtle change as she looked into his
eyes.</p>
<p>'It would startle you, Marquis, if I told you.'</p>
<p>'Not&mdash;?' He paused, grave-eyed. 'Ah, but no. I cannot
guess.'</p>
<p>Beseech it though he might, she would not tell him. But he had
other ways of ascertaining. Late that night he paid another visit
to Santinelli's room, and when he found that the letters from
'Anna' had been taken, he knew that Her Majesty had acted precisely
as he calculated.</p>
<p>No shadow came to trouble his blithe spirit in the next three
days, and then, on the morning of Friday, Count Santinelli
returned, and Monaldeschi laughed in the soul of him as he saw the
young chamberlain, still with the dust of the road upon him, pass
alone into the presence of Her Majesty to render his accounts. He
had so performed his errand that he was confident success must
follow.</p>
<p>His interview with the Queen was long protracted. But the
Marquis Monaldeschi, pacing in the Gallery of the Stags, was
without impatience.</p>
<p>Two of Her Majesty's gentlemen, Giasone and Gattinara, came in
and joined him. They had an unusual air of gravity.</p>
<p>'What is afoot?' Giasone asked him uneasily. 'Do you know?'</p>
<p>'Afoot?' said he. He shrugged. 'Santinelli has just returned
from Compiègne.'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes,' said Gattinara. 'But it's not on that account that
we are bidden to wait here and to come armed.'</p>
<p>'Armed?' The equerry displayed a surprise that was purely
histrionic. He perfectly understood that this would be a precaution
against violence in Santinelli.</p>
<p>He was still in talk with the courtier when an elderly man in a
cassock was ushered into the gallery. A moment later the Queen
entered abruptly. She was followed by Santinelli, still under the
dust of travel, booted and spurred and girt with a rapier. The
Marquis, observing that his face was pale and that there were
troubled lines between his brows, was amused to think that
presently he would be paler still.</p>
<p>Her Majesty addressed the priest. 'You have brought my package?
That is well.' She took it from him, tucked her ebony cane under
her arm, set a foot on a chair, displaying with reckless immodesty
a vigorous leg, and leaned an elbow on her knee. 'Marquis,' she
called.</p>
<p>Monaldeschi went forward promptly. The two gentlemen fell away
into the embrasure of a window. Santinelli, moving deliberately,
crossed to join them.</p>
<p>Under her equerry's eyes the Queen broke the seals of the
package. From it she drew and handed him one of the letters signed
'Anna.'</p>
<p>'Have you ever seen that before?'</p>
<p>His eyes were scanning the sheet. 'Oh, infamy!' he suddenly
burst out. 'Oh, vileness!'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes,' said she. 'That we realise. But that is not what I
asked you. Have you ever seen that letter before?' He became a
little out of breath.</p>
<p>'How could I, madame?'</p>
<p>'Or this?' She handed him a second one, and whilst he was still
reading it she thrust the third upon him. 'Or yet this one? Have
you seen any of them before?'</p>
<p>'But what a question, madame! I do not understand. How should I
have seen them?'</p>
<p>'I'll tell you that in a moment.'</p>
<p>His mouth fell open; in the sickly yellow of his countenance his
eyes seemed to turn blacker and blacker as he stared. And now,
calmly, quietly she was proffering yet a fourth sheet. 'This one,
of course, you will acknowledge.'</p>
<p>It was a letter to Monaldeschi in a pointed feminine hand, a
love-letter from a Roman woman named Gianetta, one of a score of
love-letters that he kept locked in a little ebony coffer. The
Queen's possession of it revealed to him that Santinelli's had not
been the only room she had searched. Monaldeschi's heart was
tightened by a sudden sense of peril. It required all the effort of
which he was capable so as to preserve his self-command.</p>
<p>'Why should I deny it? It holds nothing of which I need to be
ashamed. It has nothing in common with these other infamies.'</p>
<p>'One thing, I think. Look again. Look closely. Did not that
crabbed, woman's hand supply the model for the writing?'</p>
<p>'The model! That is a strange fantasy.' He actually laughed, but
there was a quaver in his voice. 'Your Majesty imagines Oh, but it
cannot be. It is I who imagine something in Your Majesty's mind
that can have no place in it.'</p>
<p>'Comedian!' She withered him with contempt, took her foot from
the chair, with an abruptness that sent it sliding a yard across
the polished floor. 'The Devil damn you for an impudent, smooth
liar. I'll tell you when last you saw those letters. When you
placed them in Santinelli's room for me to find them there, so that
you might cover your own guilt by ruining him.'</p>
<p>He was trembling from head to foot, yet had the wit to make it
seem that it was indignation shook him. 'Madame! Madame! Such a
suspicion! It is&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Fool,' she broke in. 'It is no suspicion. I saw you. With these
eyes I saw you, you crawling muckworm.' And she told him precisely
how. For a moment it shattered what was left of his
self-possession. For a moment it left him hangdog as a detected
pickpocket. Then he braced himself, and looked at the matter
squarely. He had made a cunning throw to destroy a detested rival,
and by a mischance outside his calculations the dice had fallen
against him. If his dismissal must follow, he would bear himself
like a good loser. But audacity might yet save him even now.</p>
<p>He cloaked in a tone of great dignity the baseness of his
admission. He shrugged, he spread his hands, he was
supercilious.</p>
<p>'I freely confess a fault for which the source is to be sought
in my deep devotion to Your Majesty.'</p>
<p>'What? Will you brazen it?'</p>
<p>'Ah, madame, you do not know the corrosive power of jealousy.'
He sighed artistically. 'In the despair it begets, it can bring the
noblest nature to stoop to baseness. In my love, madame, in my
greed of your smiles, it was torture to me to see you give so much
of your favour to another. If you can conceive my sufferings you
will deal gently with me for the fault into which I was
betrayed.'</p>
<p>Her smile was enigmatic. 'You keep to the offence against
Santinelli. But is there no offence against me?'</p>
<p>'None, madame. Of that I am incapable. None, as God hears
me.'</p>
<p>'Hush!' she said. 'Do not add perjury to the rest. You have
admitted that you forged these letters. Admit now that it was you
who sent to Rome those dishonouring reports of me.'</p>
<p>'Ah! That, no! That, never!'</p>
<p>'Fool! The evidence is in those forgeries. How else could you
have known so exactly what is being said in Rome?'</p>
<p>'But from yourself, madame,' he protested. 'Your Majesty forgets
that you told Santinelli and me what Cardinal Azzolini had
written.'</p>
<p>'Did I, indeed? Did I mention the infamous scandal linking me
with Don Antonio Pimentel? Did I mention the matter of the
torchlight entrance into Paris? Yet these and other things find
place here in your counterfeits.'</p>
<p>Whilst he stood wild-eyed, stricken to perceive how in his
frenzy to supply full evidence against Santinelli he had supplied
it against himself, she was turning to the priest. 'Father, there
is a man here who is to die. Pray do your office, and prepare him
to meet his Maker.'</p>
<p>The priest changed colour, aghast at such an order, delivered
with such inhuman calm, whilst Monaldeschi, after a gasp of fearful
amazement, fell on his knees.</p>
<p>'Madame! Madame!' Terror made him shrill. 'You cannot mean to
Oh, my God, madame!'</p>
<p>She looked down at him, and her big eyes were cold. 'It is the
sentence yourself pronounced upon the man so vile as to have
betrayed my trust. I merely order its execution.'</p>
<p>Whilst the Marquis, wildly incoherent, whimpered in panic, the
priest, enlightened at last, was gravely intervening. 'Your Majesty
cannot order a murder.'</p>
<p>She threw up her head, frowning. 'Sir, you are oddly bold.' Her
voice was big with pride. 'Do you presume to question my royal
rights? This man's crime, let me tell you, is one for which he
should be broken on the wheel.' Peremptorily she added: 'Do your
office, sir, and shrive him.'</p>
<p>But her peremptoriness did not daunt the stout heart of the old
priest.</p>
<p>'If he is, indeed, a criminal, there is a justice in France
which Your Majesty can invoke.'</p>
<p>This merely increased her haughty resentment. Do you forget that
I am a Queen? With power of life and death over my subjects? I
require no justice but my own.'</p>
<p>'But to put a man to death. In Heaven's name, madame, bethink
you. Whatever he may have done, Your Majesty is in France,
and&mdash;'</p>
<p>Her impatience could endure no more. She was breathing noisily.
'Is this a new thing in France? <i>Mort Diable</i>! Have you never
heard how the great Duke of Guise was put to death at Blois by
Henri III? And are there not other instances?'</p>
<p>Still Father Le Bel held his ground. 'What Henri III and other
princes may have done, at least they did in their own country,
where they were masters. Here Your Majesty is in the house of the
King of France, who may well be offended by such an act.'</p>
<p>'You speak as if I were a refugee or a captive, instead of an
honoured guest of the King of France. Am I any the less royal
because I am not in my own kingdom? The power of life and death is
mine by right of birth. Absolute and sovereign justice resides in
me. I am a Queen, answerable for my actions to God alone. Do you be
as mindful that you are a priest. Perform your duty and prepare
this man for death.'</p>
<p>The prior could do no more. But Monaldeschi, in his frenzy of
terror, forced to believe this almost unbelievable thing, this
sudden doom out of all proportion to his offence, still on his
knees was clawing her petticoat, and so preventing her
departure.</p>
<p>'Mercy, madame! Mercy! You shall know all. I will confess all.
And when you have heard, you will be moved to pardon.'</p>
<p>She paused. 'You observe, Father,' she said to the priest, 'how
far I am from all impatience with this wretch.'</p>
<p>'Ah, hear me,' Monaldeschi desperately begged, and poured forth
again the passionate plea&mdash;in which there was a deal of
truth&mdash;that a rage of jealousy had made him mad. In that
madness he had blindly sought to avenge the wounds she had dealt
him in preferring another to himself.</p>
<p>He may have supposed that a plea of having sinned through love
was one that no woman could withstand. What he overlooked was that
Christina of Sweden was scarcely a woman, and that an egomaniac
knows no mercy for injuries to vanity. When his piteous prayer was
exhausted, she turned once more to the priest in a frozen calm.</p>
<p>'Be witness, Father, that I have denied this traitor no
opportunity to justify himself. I leave you to care for his
soul.'</p>
<p>Then the good priest, stifling indignation, himself knelt to beg
her mercy for an unfortunate whose offence, whilst grave and
hideous, scarcely deserved to be atoned in death. Gently but firmly
she denied him.</p>
<p>'It is not for you to judge of that, Father.' She turned to give
a sharp order to Santinelli, and having given it, shook off the
clawing hands of Monaldeschi, and went striding from the
gallery.</p>
<p>The Marquis would have gone after her but that he found his way
barred by Santinelli and the other two, whom the Count had summoned
to his side. They had drawn their swords, and the Count, grim of
face, was presenting the point to the distraught equerry.</p>
<p>'Get yourself confessed,' was his stern admonition.</p>
<p>At the mercy now of this man whose doom little more than an hour
ago he thought he had assured, Monaldeschi realized the futility of
hope. He attempted to brace himself to meet an inevitable fate. He
took Father Le Bel apart, and actually knelt to him and began to
confess himself. Then, starting up again in revolt against death in
such cold blood, he filled the place with his wild cries,
protesting that he would not be assassinated, and wildly beseeching
the priest again to intercede for him with the Queen. Le Bel,
shocked by the events and profoundly touched by the young man's
agony, sternly ordered those gentlemen to hold their hands whilst
he went upon that errand.</p>
<p>Wrapped in the mantle of Rhadamanthus, Christina listened to his
piteous intercession, to dismiss him coldly with the answer that
from the judgment she had passed upon a traitor there could be no
appeal.</p>
<p>Revolted by this inhumanity, yet in despair, Le Bel returned to
the gallery. Compassionately he stood before the anguished Marquis.
He spoke in a strangled voice.</p>
<p>'My son, it is necessary to die. <i>Il faut mourir</i>. Offer up
your death as a penance for your sins, trusting to the infinite
mercy of God.'</p>
<p>The rest was a scene of horror between a victim in wild
rebellion against his fate and the executioners impatient to be
done. Not until at the foot of the painting of the Château of
Saint-Germains the Marquis lay bleeding to death was his shriving
completed. Then Santinelli passed a sword through his throat to end
the matter.</p>
<p>Christina received the report of what had been done with the
same judicial lack of emotion which had horrified the priest,
content in the persuasion that the assassination she had ordered
was a proper exercise of the divine right to which she had been
born. Her egregious vanity so magnified the offence that her
conscience was easy on the score of the punishment.</p>
<p>It was a shock to her when Cardinal Mazarin, that supple
statesman whose ways were ever obsequious, wrote to her that in
view of what had happened at Fontainebleau he could not, in her own
interest, open the way to Court for her, since her appearance there
must certainly now be attended by humiliations. It was in vain that
she essayed with him the Rhadamanthine tone. She was answered that
her only hope of condonation lay in repudiating responsibility for
the deed and placing it on the shoulders of the man who had been
her instrument. Infuriated by this, she refused to deny an act of
royal justice for which she proclaimed herself answerable to none.
But Mazarin was insistent, and compelled her to abate her pride at
least to the extent of sending Santinelli out of France. He
rejoined her later, when, herself departing in the chagrin of a
guest who has been made to realise that she is not wanted, she
retraced her steps to Rome.</p>
<p>Years afterwards, when this vagabond Queen was weary of foreign
wandering and of subsistence upon means inadequate to her pride in
her royal station, and disillusioned by ridicule and humiliations
where she had looked to excite wonder and enthusiasm, she repented
an abdication now irrevocable. Further disillusioned by a cold
repulse of her offer to return to Sweden as regent during the
minority of the child of her cousin Charles Gustavus, yet seeking
desperately to grasp once more the substance of royalty, she
offered herself as a Queen to Poland, which just then was about to
elect a sovereign. Her candidature was supported by the Pope and by
Cardinal Azzolini, the Pope's Secretary of State. Stress was laid
upon the virile qualities of Queen Christina, and the will of the
Holy See must have prevailed had not the ghost of Monaldeschi risen
up at the eleventh hour to thwart her.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the election, the Diet required her to
justify the murder committed at Fontainebleau.</p>
<p>At this questioning of her royal rights of life and death, she
flung into a passion.</p>
<p>'I am not disposed,' she answered, 'to justify to the Polish
Diet the death of an Italian in my service. I provided that he
should receive the sacraments before being put to death, so that no
reproach can rest upon me.'</p>
<p>Thus Monaldeschi from his unhonoured grave at Fontainebleau
avenged himself by dooming her to the end of her days to a
vagabondage of ever-decreasing lustre.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT</h2>
<p>When Leopold I, Holy Roman Germanic Emperor, lay upon his
death-bed, the War of the Spanish Succession was still being
fought. But so persuaded was the old gentleman, who for nine and
forty years had reigned as emperor, that the issue of that war must
establish the rights of the House of Hapsburg to the throne of
Spain, that he made his testamentary dispositions accordingly.</p>
<p>He divided the vast Hapsburg possessions between his two sons.
To Joseph, the elder, went the Archduchy of Austria, the Kingdoms
of Bohemia and Hungary, and some states of Italy, whilst to
Charles, the younger, went the throne of Spain. Should either of
the brothers die without male heir, his share in that splendid
heritage should pass to the survivor. Only if both should die
without male issue could the succession go to a female, and in that
case the daughters of Joseph must take precedence of the daughters
of Charles.</p>
<p>Having sown these seeds of mischief, as so often happens when
men seek to control from beyond the grave the destinies of the
living, the Emperor Leopold passed peacefully away in the
persuasion that he had wisely provided for every emergency.</p>
<p>Charles duly ascended the throne of Spain, and for seven years
struggled desperately to maintain himself in that uncomfortable
seat. In 1711, when his brother suddenly died of smallpox, he
inherited the Empire, but he was con strained by the Treaty of
Utrecht to renounce the Spanish crown.</p>
<p>Joseph left no male issue. His only children were two girls,
Maria-Josepha and Maria-Amalia. When in the fullness of time
Charles was brought to the doleful recognition of his own
incapacity to produce a son, his paternal affection for his
splendid daughter Maria-Theresa urged him closely to review his
father's testamentary dispositions and to consider the
interpretations of which they might be susceptible.</p>
<p>He perceived quite clearly that his was a case which the
circumstances had altered. The loss of the throne of Spain had been
something outside his father's calculations. Moreover, in disposing
for the second generation Leopold had exceeded his imperial rights,
infringing as he did upon the rights of every emperor (rights now
vested in Charles) to designate a successor.</p>
<p>In these arguments he found an abundant justification for
bestowing the Hapsburg heritage upon Maria-Theresa. But he knew his
world well enough to realise that something more than the
expression of his will was necessary to induce others to see the
matter with his own eyes. His nieces, whom it might be argued that
he thus dispossessed, were married, one to the Elector of Saxony
and the other to the Elector of Bavaria, either of whom might claim
the heritage for his wife and the imperial crown for himself.
Charles, therefore, set about bribing these and other interested
parties to ratify the pragmatic sanction under which he established
the precedence of his own daughter.</p>
<p>The worldly-wise Prince Eugène expressed his scorn to see the
Emperor thus exhausting his resources.</p>
<p>'A standing army of two hundred thousand men,' said he, 'would
be worth a deal more than all the pragmatic sanctions in the world,
and would cost you less.'</p>
<p>But Charles VI, with that trust in human nature and faith in the
word of princes which supplied his besetting weakness, continued
his pursuit of ratifications.</p>
<p>The most expensive to obtain was, of course, that of
Frederick-Augustus of Saxony, who having married Maria-Josepha, the
late Emperor's elder daughter, had a clear claim under Leopold's
will. He required as his price nothing less than the throne of
Poland. But France had a claim to that throne, and having involved
Charles VI in a ruinous war to establish it, Louis XV consented to
waive it in favour of Frederick-Augustus, but only if France
received in compensation the rich Duchy of Lorraine, which was a
fief of the Empire.</p>
<p>Louis XV could have demanded nothing that the Emperor would be
less willing to surrender, or the surrender of which would cost him
a more bitter humiliation.</p>
<p>Francis of Lorraine, the reigning Duke, a courtly, travelled,
accomplished young prince, educated partly at the Court of Vienna
and now acting as the Emperor's representative in Hungary, was
known to have inspired a romantic passion in the heart of the
Archduchess Maria-Theresa, eight years his junior, and himself to
entertain for that lovely, vivacious child the tenderest regard.
Whatever might be the wishes of the young people, the Emperor
himself was far from persuaded that the Duke of Lorraine was a
suitable husband for the Archduchess. But the young Duke's
ratification was necessary for that cession of Lorraine to France.
Without this there would be no throne of Poland with which to bribe
Frederick-Augustus of Saxony to forgo any rights to Austria which
his wife might be claimed to possess.</p>
<p>So Bartenstein was dispatched by the Emperor to Pressburg to
arrange the matter with Francis of Lorraine. A rude, blunt fellow,
Bartenstein's discharge of his errand is remarkable for its lack of
circumlocutions.</p>
<p>'It is your highness's hope, is it not, to marry the
Archduchess?'</p>
<p>The young Duke required a moment or two to recover from the
shock of that staggering question. Then, whilst still bewildered,
he answered simply and seriously: 'It is my fondest hope.'</p>
<p>'Give me welcome, then. For I bring you word that you may
realise it.' Bartenstein slapped down a document. 'Sign this, and
on my return to Vienna the Emperor will announce the
betrothal.'</p>
<p>The proud, fair face of the Duke went dark and stern as he
scanned the paper.</p>
<p>'That never,' he said, at last, and flung it back at
Bartenstein.</p>
<p>The corpulent minister raised his black brows. 'That means that
you don't want the Archduchess.'</p>
<p>'It means that I will not be a party to a cession of rights
which it is my duty to maintain.'</p>
<p>'Very fine and lofty, to be sure,' Bartenstein agreed. 'But it
comes to the same thing.'</p>
<p>They stared at each other, the Duke breathing hard, the swarthy,
corpulent minister as impassive as a clay idol.</p>
<p>'It is, then, a choice that is offered me?' said Francis.</p>
<p>'It is; and in your highness's place I should not decide
hastily. You renounce a duchy; but as the husband of the
Archduchess you may aspire to the imperial crown.' He coughed.
'Better sign.' And he proffered a pen.</p>
<p>The Duke took it from him merely to fling it across the room.
Utterly unmoved, the minister picked up a second one.</p>
<p>'So long as you merely throw away a pen, I can offer you
another. But if you throw away this chance of sovereignty and
happiness, that will be irrevocable.'</p>
<p>Francis took time to consider, but in the end he signed, and
everybody was happy: Maria-Theresa, the Emperor, the King of
France, and Frederick-Augustus of Saxony.</p>
<p>It followed inevitably, however, that renunciation of
Maria-Josepha's husband cleared the way for a claim by her sister
Maria-Amalia, whose husband, the Elector of Bavaria, now reared his
head. It was a loutish flaxen head with pale bovine eyes, behind
whose dull phlegm none would have suspected the activity of greed
and ambition.</p>
<p>He, too, had to be bribed to put aside his sudden dreams of
empire, and to ratify the pragmatic sanction which established the
succession of Maria-Theresa.</p>
<p>But five years later, in 1740, by when Maria-Theresa was
twenty-three and had been four years a wife, the Emperor's death
discovered the folly of his trust in human nature.</p>
<p>The Elector of Bavaria let it be known that he had so little
regard for his engagement under the pragmatic sanction as to have
an eye on the Hapsburg heritage.</p>
<p>Maria-Theresa regarded his menace with contempt until the
mischief was aggravated by Frederick II of Prussia.</p>
<p>Little Fritz, so despised by his father for a worthless rascal,
the flute-player, the poet, the friend of wits and men of letters,
was suddenly beset by an itch not only for soldiering, but for
downright brigandage.</p>
<p>His Grand-Marshal von Götter, a handsome, arrogant, swaggering
fellow, appeared suddenly in Vienna as the Brandenburger's
envoy-extraordinary. Because Maria-Theresa at the time was being
brought to bed of the fifth of the sixteen children she was
destined to bear, von Götter to his infinite regret must deliver
himself to Francis of Lorraine instead. He had learnt by heart the
beautiful address which Fritz, the man of letters, had so carefully
composed, trusting that justice would be done to his authorship by
the histrionic gifts of his Grand-Marshal.</p>
<p>It began by the seductively delusive assurance that the troops
and resources of the King of Prussia were at the disposal of the
House of Austria. It dwelt upon the power and extent of these, and
then passed on to name the price desired by Fritz for an alliance
which had not been solicited. It was nothing less than the cession
to him of the Province of Silesia. So necessary to him was this
that he was compelled in any case to enter it, and if the cession
were not made, his troops and his resources would be employed to
further the aims of Charles-Albert of Bavaria.</p>
<p>Thus, from protestations of friendship, through an offer of
alliance to unblushing blackmail.</p>
<p>Francis of Lorraine, shocked by the impudence of both message
and messenger, controlled himself with difficulty to inquire
whether he was to understand that Prussian troops had already
entered Silesia. Insolently von Götter announced that they had, and
that whether they remained there as friends or as enemies of the
House of Austria, it was for Her Majesty to decide.</p>
<p>In the absence of any declaration of war, this was simply an act
of robbery under arms. Frederick had neglected to declare war in
just the same spirit as a burglar neglects to knock at the
door.</p>
<p>From her bed the indignant Maria-Theresa returned through her
husband the only possible answer. So long as a Prussian soldier
remained in Silesia, there could be no discussion of any kind, and
not an inch of soil, in any event, would the House of Austria cede
to Frederick.</p>
<p>Recourse to arms became necessary so as to drive back the
Prussians, who were already advancing on Breslau. Neipperg was
entrusted with the command of the Austrian forces, and at Mollwitz,
where the armies met, little Frederick (later to be known as the
Great) received his baptism of fire. He liked it so little that it
almost made an end of his soldiering. In the clash of the first
encounter, the Prussian cavalry which he commanded was scattered by
Neipperg's squadrons, and Frederick, quaking to the little soul of
him, galloped hell-for-leather from the field followed by an
attendant troop, nor drew rein until he had reached Löwen, a dozen
miles away.</p>
<p>There he was found by General Schwerin, on that April evening,
in the room of an old mill, seated at a cold hearth, with his head
in his hands and dejection in his soul, lamenting the irreparable
ruin with which his rashness had overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>The astounded Schwerin, who had remained in command after the
King's flight, could scarcely at first persuade His Majesty that,
far from having suffered disaster, the Prussian army had gained a
complete victory. When this startling fact at last penetrated his
gloom, Frederick pulled himself together.</p>
<p>'So! That should be warning to young soldiers against losing
hope too soon.'</p>
<p>To the world the defeat of mighty Austria by the hitherto
insignificant little State of Prussia was matter for amazement. To
Maria-Theresa it was a matter not only for bitterest chagrin, but
very soon, in the sequel, for the gravest alarm.</p>
<p>This sequel was supplied, of course, by the bovine Elector of
Bavaria. It was nothing to Charles-Albert that he had been
handsomely paid to ratify the pragmatic sanction; even less that he
had pledged his honour to support it. Whilst Austria reeled under
the blow sustained he perceived an opportunity of which, by his
lights, he would be a fool not to take advantage. He went off to
invite the assistance of Louis XV; and Louis XV&mdash;or rather
Cardinal Fleury, who governed France for him&mdash;perceiving the
advantages of placing Charles-Albert on the imperial throne and
thus creating an emperor who would be his vassal and puppet, chose
similarly to ignore how handsomely he had been bribed to support
Maria-Theresa.</p>
<p>The very rumour of this coalition was enough to strike terror
into the group of elderly incompetent men who formed
Maria-Theresa's ministry. With the single exception of the
stout-spirited Bartenstein, all urged her in this peril to make
peace with Frederick at the price of surrendering Silesia. Even
Francis of Lorraine, who counted upon the imperial crown for
himself, and who desired for this the suffrages of the King of
Prussia, added his persuasions to the others.</p>
<p>There was famine in Vienna at the time, and the mutinous spirit
which never fails to spring from it was intensified by the rumour
that Frederick had joined the Franco-Bavarian coalition, and was
preparing to invade Austria. The people were muttering against the
Queen, attributing all their ills to the fact that a woman was on
the throne, and already a party was growing that was actually
prepared to welcome the Elector of Bavaria.</p>
<p>Maria-Theresa's truly royal spirit remained unshaken. She
refused to be stampeded by panic. Peace with Frederick and the
sacrifice of Silesia would not, as things stood, enable her to deal
with this treacherous Elector of Bavaria, who aimed at dismembering
Austria and Bohemia, and whom she now accounted her chief
enemy.</p>
<p>In her present urgent need it was to her Kingdom of Hungary that
she turned for help. Two factors were in her favour. There was
little love lost between Hungarians and Austrians, and the fact
that among her own immediate subjects Maria-Theresa was finding
insubordination was enough to predispose Hungarians in her favour.
That gallant seventy-year-old soldier, John Palfy, who had been her
ambassador to Hungary, where he commanded the vast influence of a
man universally worshipped, was loyally devoted to her.</p>
<p>To these factors, however, precious as they were, she had yet
another infinitely more precious, upon which Palfy confidently
counted when he urged her to come and throw herself into the arms
of her Hungarian subjects: it was the dominant influence of her own
splendid personality and radiant muliebrity. Herself, she was
neither insensible to the value of these nor reticent in displaying
them to the best advantage. She possessed a measure of that
histrionic gift without which no leader has ever attained to
greatness.</p>
<p>Twenty-four years of age, not merely tall, but statuesque of
shape, glorious of countenance with her regular features, large
luminous eyes and luxuriant tresses, innocent of powder that would
have dimmed their golden lustre, never was queen endowed with a
more regal aspect, never was woman more richly equipped by nature
to command the worship of men. Magnificently mistress of the black
stallion on which she rode up the hill at Pressburg to her
coronation as Queen of Hungary, she was a figure to arouse the
chivalrous enthusiasm of the noble concourse that attended her.</p>
<p>When the crown of Saint Stephen was placed on her head and the
ragged mantle on her shoulders, the swords of the Magyars flashed
from their scabbards to the resounding cry of:</p>
<p>'Long live our mistress and King Maria-Theresa!'</p>
<p>And the Queen, smiling upon them with shining eyes, answered in
her resonant, musical voice:</p>
<p>'Hungary shall find in me a father as well as a mother.'</p>
<p>Of the wonder and pride in her which she had thus sown it became
necessary, as the months passed and her dangers became more
pressing, to harvest the fruits.</p>
<p>Already the armies of France and Bavaria were on Austrian soil,
investing Lintz, when, in September, she appeared again before the
Hungarian Diet assembled in the great hall of the Palace of
Pressburg, and from the throne addressed them upon her needs.</p>
<p>Lip-service is one thing; to take up a burden, quite another.
The admiration in which they held her was suddenly curbed by the
call upon them to express it in action. Their spreading coldness
chilled her to the heart. Unless she could stir them out of it, she
was lost indeed. To this she addressed herself. She passed from
appeal to argument. She expounded how the very existence of
Hungary, with the predatory Turk upon her borders, depended upon
the cohesion of the Hapsburg heritage. In fighting now for her,
they would be fighting for one upon whom they could count in the
hour of need, for one who hereafter would never spare herself in
upholding and defending their own liberties. Whilst some were won
by her advocacy, more remained aloof, and a few even broke into
hostile denunciation.</p>
<p>To these last she was deaf. The moment had come to supply a
climax, to stake all upon a single throw, in which she would engage
all that there was of her and something more.</p>
<p>From her dear Francis of Lorraine, standing in the background at
the foot of the throne, she received their infant son, the future
Joseph II, now six months old. Advancing to the edge of the dais,
with the babe in her arms, amid the surprised silence which that
odd proceeding imposed, she held him out to them.</p>
<p>'Here is my son, your future King.' Her voice broke a little.
The glorious eyes were suddenly filled with tears. But if the
mother wept, the Queen remained swathed in majesty. Steadying
itself, the rich voice rang out. 'He belongs to you as to me, and
it is to you, my brave Hungarians, that I now entrust him.'</p>
<p>It was a challenge to their knightliness, and before the
combined appeal of glorious woman, noble mother, and majestic
queen, opposition was shamed and crumbled into dust. Enthusiasm
awoke and soared, swelling as it ascended. Again, as on the hill of
her coronation, she had conquered by the enchantment of her
personality, and by her ability to exert it so as to inflame
imagination. Again the swords of the Hungarian nobles flashed
aloft, and this time the cry was:</p>
<p>'We will die for our King Maria-Theresa.'</p>
<p>And the emotional vow was backed by the practical measure of an
immediate vote to raise an army of a hundred thousand men.</p>
<p>That triumph of hers at Pressburg had its repercussions in her
own native Austria. It aroused a pride in her which stamped out all
notion of supplanting her by Charles-Albert of Bavaria. It had its
repercussions, too, in Prussia. The crafty and quite unscrupulous
Frederick perceived in this arming of Hungary an unforeseen danger,
as well as an opportunity, by breaking faith with his French and
Bavarian allies, to make for himself an advantageous peace. And now
that the circumstances had altered, Maria-Theresa was herself
willing to pay the price that would enable her fully to deal with
the arch-enemy Charles-Albert.</p>
<p>Once more it was the massively elegant von Götter, his
wine-coloured dolman stiff with bullion, who came as the envoy of
Frederick. This time he was not denied. Maria-Theresa received him
in a room of the Hofburg that glittered with Hapsburg
splendours.</p>
<p>Enthroned in a tall gilded chair, supported by Francis of
Lorraine, by the statesman Bartenstein and by her generals von
Traun and Kervenhüller, she seemed to the Prussian an incarnation
of all the glory of womanhood and all the majesty of her proud
house. The swaggerer was moved to reverence. As he bowed before
her, his heels together, her voice seemed to fill the room with
music.</p>
<p>'We need lose no time, sir. We will sign this treaty ceding
Silesia to the King of Prussia, with one condition.'</p>
<p>He was deferentially deprecatory.</p>
<p>'Conditions, Majesty, create delays.'</p>
<p>'Not this one, I think. All that I ask is that for the present
the treaty shall remain a secret.'</p>
<p>Von Götter was perplexed. 'A secret, Majesty? Your Majesty asks
for secrecy when all the advantages lie in publication, when
publication will give pause to your enemies, already on Austrian
soil?'</p>
<p>'We do not wish to give them pause.'</p>
<p>In deepening bewilderment the flamboyant soldier looked at the
grave-faced men who made a background for that calm, august figure.
He hesitated a little as he spoke. 'I do not understand,' he
confessed. 'A French and Bavarian army under Marshal de Belle Isle
is already marching to invade Your Majesty's Kingdom of
Bohemia.'</p>
<p>She smiled upon his bewilderment. 'It would cease to march if we
were to announce this treaty of peace with Prussia.'</p>
<p>'Exactly, Majesty. Belle Isle advances confidently because he
depends upon uniting forces with my master. The King of Prussia's
withdrawal from the coalition would be to the Bavarians a signal of
retreat.'</p>
<p>'We do not wish them to retreat. We wish them to push on, so
that caught in Bohemia without the Prussian support upon which they
are counting, they shall never return. Do you understand? We want
to make sure that they will not come to the assistance of their
Elector, now at Lintz, who may soon be sorely in need of
assistance. We do not desire to see the Bavarians retreat in such
good order that the Elector will be left in strength to begin
again.' She uttered a grimly scornful little laugh. 'In fancy
Charles-Albert of Bavaria, who in contempt of his own pledges so
treacherously invades my kingdom, has already dethroned me and sits
here in my place. His ally, the no less faithless King of France,
abetting him in this, is pressing the electors to bestow the
imperial crown upon this Bavarian marionette. That he may have if
the electors so decide, but of Austrian, Hungarian, or Bohemian
soil he shall have no more than he may need for a grave.</p>
<p>'Now, sir,' she ended, 'perhaps you understand the sentiments
that move me to resign myself to the sacrifice of Silesia. If you
are prepared to pledge the King of Prussia to secrecy, we sign the
treaty; but not otherwise.'</p>
<p>Plenipotentiary though he might be, von Götter hesitated. The
reverence she had earlier aroused in him was now deepened almost to
awe by her grasp of the situation and the boldness of her plan. His
every inclination was to accede at once. Only the fear of
Frederick's disapproval restrained him. He said so frankly.</p>
<p>Maria-Theresa shook her golden head. 'He will not disapprove
unless he is a fool, and of that I have seen no signs. If Austria
is dismembered, Prussia may have France for her neighbour. What
security would your master then enjoy?'</p>
<p>'I am entirely of Your Majesty's opinion. But I cannot pledge
the King of Prussia in so grave a matter. I must consult him. In
doing so Your Majesty may regard me as your advocate.'</p>
<p>'We thank you. Lose no time, sir. And tell your master that I
require of him not only secrecy, but all the appearances of
maintained hostility, so that the existence of an understanding may
not even be suspected. Let him march upon Neisse, and make a
pretence of besieging it.'</p>
<p>Von Götter departed with a vague feeling that it was to him, who
had come so confidently to dictate terms, that the terms had been
dictated.</p>
<p>When, still under the spell of that irresistible woman, he laid
her plans before Frederick, the little Brandenburger brigand swore
as he laughed.</p>
<p>'What a woman! And to think that but for the barrier of religion
I might have married her. Lord God! Between us we could have ruled
the world.'</p>
<p>It was not, however, out of any such sentimental considerations
that he yielded to her demands, but entirely because it suited his
own interests to contribute to the destruction of allies who if
successful might come to prove dangerous to him.</p>
<p>Having secured his agreement to her conditions, Maria-Theresa
set vigorously about completing the work in which that was the
first step. The main force of Bavarians and their French allies
were already besieging Prague when she dispatched thither an army
of Austrians and Hungarians, some sixty thousand strong, nominally
under Francis of Lorraine, but actually commanded by General von
Traun. If they did not arrive too late to prevent the fall of the
Bohemian capital, at least they came in time to cut off the retreat
of the army under Belle Isle and to hold it desperately entrenched
in Prague, vainly waiting for Frederick of Prussia to come to its
relief. Of that brilliant army, some forty thousand strong, only
the wreckage, amounting to some seven or eight thousand men, ever
returned home.</p>
<p>Whilst the main Bavarian forces, facing doom in the north, were
thus immobilized by von Traun, a smaller Austrian army under the
briliant veteran Kervenhüller was advancing westwards, sweeping the
enemy out of the country. In pursuit of them, and in accordance
with the instructions of his royal mistress, the Austrian commander
crossed the frontiers of Bavaria, and whilst Louis XV was exerting
pressure upon the electors to bestow the imperial crown upon
Charles-Albert, Charles-Albert's kingdom was steadily being
conquered by Kervenhüller. At last, as a climax of irony, on the
twelfth February of 1742, the very day on which the Elector of
Bavaria was at last proclaimed Emperor, the Austrians established
themselves in his capital of Munich, so that the mantle of the Holy
Roman Germanic Emperor fell upon the shoulders of a man who,
landless and destitute, was mocked by the emptiness of an honour
acquired at so desperate a price.</p>
<p>For Maria-Theresa this was one of the great moments of her life.
In an hour of black adversity she had boldly confronted an imminent
and ruinous defeat. By her wit and courage she had turned it into a
triumph that earned her the wonder and respect of Europe.</p>
<p>The broken Elector of Bavaria, now the Emperor Charles VII, had
been driven to exist almost upon charity in Frankfort. The
dispossessor had succeeded only in being dispossessed, and was now
an object of pity to the world.</p>
<p>But he aroused no pity in the stern heart of the woman he had
sought to ruin.</p>
<p>'If,' said Maria-Theresa to the ambassador of King George of
England, who came to plead with her on the lackland Emperor's
behalf, 'if, so as to defend myself from his unprovoked attack, I
was constrained to give up Silesia, it is proper that I should
compensate myself by taking possession of Bavaria. If you tell me
that the Kingdom of Bavaria is worth many times the value of the
province of Silesia, I answer you that that is the fortune of war,
and that the Elector of Bavaria who sought this war must abide by
the fortune of it.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>THE SECRET ADVERSARY</h2>
<p>A very subtle gentleman was General Count von Rantzau-Aschberg.
He was endowed with that superlative gift of intrigue which lies in
employing others as if they were pawns upon a chessboard.</p>
<p>The historians generally seem to have done him less than
justice. This, perhaps, because of the subtlety of his methods; for
humanity will ever be mistrustful of force that displays itself
otherwise than in direct action.</p>
<p>As a soldier he had given proof of his great attainments, and
consequently, and deservedly, no man in Denmark in his time enjoyed
a higher credit with the army. And it is possible that as a
statesman he might, given opportunity, have proved the Danish
Richelieu he seems to have believed himself to be.</p>
<p>He is commonly believed to have been a self-seeker. But there is
really no evidence that in attempting to seize the reins of
government and guide the feeble-minded, feeble-bodied young King
Christian, he sought to do more than discharge the duty imposed
upon him by the late King Frederick, whose trust and friendship he
had enjoyed.</p>
<p>He was thwarted at the outset by the Queen-Dowager, Juliana of
Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel; and if he did not realise this as soon as
he should have done so, it is because Juliana was of a subtlety
that matched his own, and addicted to a similar obliquity of
methods.</p>
<p>The very generous and tolerant may spare a little sympathy for
Juliana, too, when all the facts are considered. The second wife of
the late King, she was the mother of a stocky lad on whose behalf
maternal ambition silenced scruples. She had come to found high
hopes for her offspring upon the frailty, physical and moral, of
her stepson Christian, and she was of those who perceive the
futility of awaiting in idleness the fruition of a hope. A natural
profligacy in the degenerate King should, if properly encouraged,
speed his descent of the abyss which his sickly health had already
opened for him. And since that stocky son of hers, Prince
Frederick, stood next in the succession, she conceived it her
maternal duty to see that Christian was supplied with all the
encouragement necessary.</p>
<p>Under her hand she had&mdash;for in her widowhood her morals do
not appear to have been any better than they should have
been&mdash;a group of minions who formed the nucleus of her own
particular court. Of these the ablest, as he was certainly the most
engaging and dissolute, was the handsome, elegant young Count von
Holckt; and since in personality, tastes, and accomplishments he
seemed the likeliest agent of her motherly and stepmotherly
designs, she placed him in the position of mentor to the young
King.</p>
<p>Von Holckt devoted himself with zeal to the duties of a
mentorship which he perfectly understood. If as a preceptor in vice
his equal could hardly have been discovered, it is certain that he
could not have found a pupil more apt and enthusiastic than
Christian. The results of the riotous excesses he prescribed were
soon discernible in the further impairment of the royal health and
the further deepening of the royal imbecility.</p>
<p>It began to look as if complete success must soon crown von
Holckt's endeavours, when General Count von Rantzau-Aschberg
perceived the necessity of applying a check unless he were prepared
to relinquish the ambition which he conceived that duty imposed
upon him of constituting himself the power behind the throne. He
moved the Council of State to insist that the King, now nineteen
years of age, should marry and ensure the succession.</p>
<p>This was the last measure desired by Juliana, who considered the
succession sufficiently ensured by the existence of her son
Frederick. At the same time it was not a measure that she dared to
oppose. Nor, for that matter, was it one that need seriously
perturb her. The extent to which, under von Holckt's masterly
guidance, persistent excesses had by now debauched Christian's
constitution, left her persuaded that it was beyond his wasted
strength to achieve paternity.</p>
<p>So a queen was found for Christian in the seventeenyear-old
Princess Matilda, the sister of King George III of England, and in
the year 1767 this frail, flaxen-haired boy of eighteen received
the bride chosen for him by von Rantzau, and bestowed upon him by
the Council of State with the same apathy with which he discharged
all the other functions of his exalted office.</p>
<p>Rantzau founded stout hopes upon the undeniable charms of this
buxom, ruddy-haired English princess. Her fragrant freshness might
well captivate the senses of the young voluptuary, and her strength
of character, her rigid decorum, her insistence upon the stern
etiquette in which she had been reared, might accomplish the
removal of those evil forces which had fastened upon the King. Thus
should Rantzau step into the place which he accounted his own at
the King's side.</p>
<p>At first it looked as if he were justified of his hopes.
Matilda's beneficent influence made itself felt not only with the
King, but with the entire court to which she restored a dignity
that had been well-nigh lost. So superbly did she queen it there,
so completely did she win its regard and become the arbiter of its
courses, that soon her will became supreme; and the plump and still
comely though gooseberry-eyed Juliana found herself, before the age
of forty, thrust into the background of a stage of which for a
dozen years and more she had held the centre. If this was a bitter
draught for such a woman, there was worse to follow. Matilda had
the temerity, against every expectation, to create an obstacle to
Prince Frederick's succession by bringing forth a son.</p>
<p>Whilst fawning upon Matilda in public, the Queen-Dowager raged
in secret. But she was not the woman to resign herself, nor did she
yet despair of von Holckt.</p>
<p>In a measure as the novelty of Queen Matilda's attractions for
Christian wore itself out, the young nobleman was regaining his
ascendancy. Soon there was an end to the regeneration of the King
which Matilda had been accomplishing. A little later and the
relations between the royal couple became strained. Christian's
successive and shamelessly open infidelities, the very vulgarity of
their nature, the coarseness of his habits, which included the fact
that he was seldom sober, soon came to inspire his decorous young
queen with a disgust she did not trouble to dissemble. Since her
recriminations wearied him, he ended by utterly neglecting and
ignoring her.</p>
<p>The watchful Juliana, plump and bland as an Eastern idol,
perceived infinite possibilities in such a situation. A neglected
wife not yet twenty years of age, the centre of a court in which
gallantry was not unknown, was in a position of singular peril. And
for all the girl's decorum, in her full lips, high cheek-bones, and
rich muliebrity of frame Juliana read an ardent temperament. She
could afford to wait whilst her indefatigable agent von Holckt
widened the breach.</p>
<p>But once again Rantzau, who does not appear to have suspected
that it was Juliana with whom he was striving, came to the rescue.
The Council of State was again his weapon, and the Council under
his direction prescribed a grand tour for the young sovereign.
Christian was to visit several of the courts of Europe, and in the
observation of foreign manner and the foreign conduct of affairs
improve his hitherto very indifferent education in kingcraft. An
attractive picture of the distractions awaiting him in the foreign
capitals was submitted to His Majesty. For, after all, Christian
was an absolute monarch, whose will was not to be constrained. He
succumbed, and agreed to go. But Juliana parried the stroke. Von
Holckt would accompany the King, and upon this&mdash;once it had
been suggested to him&mdash;the King insisted.</p>
<p>It was now that Rantzau perceived the necessity of striking at
what he supposed to be the very root of the evil. The influence of
the profligate minion must be destroyed.</p>
<p>And that is how John Frederick Struensee, the physician, the son
of a simple country clergyman, came to step from the obscurity of
his station into the pages of history.</p>
<p>Count Rantzau had been attended by him, and had formed the
highest opinion of his medical skill. Even higher was the opinion
he had formed of his force of character and dominant personality.
He perceived in him, too, a restlessness of ambition, which now
suggested him to the Count's mind as a proper and willing
instrument. He came promptly in answer to the Count's summons: a
large, athletic man in the late thirties, florid of complexion,
breezy of manner and of undoubted personal attraction.</p>
<p>To receive him the Count unbent from his habitual austerity.
Rantzau was now in his sixtieth year, but very straight and spare
and tall, and of a fastidious if sombre elegance in his dress. The
black powder he used for his carefully clubbed hair, whilst
intensifying the pallor of his lean, aquiline, deeply lined face,
lent it an air of youthfulness that was obviously spurious.</p>
<p>Seated at his library table, one of his long delicate hands,
half smothered in a foam of lace, waved the doctor to a chair. He
came straight to what appeared to be the point.</p>
<p>'Such is my regard for your skill, Struensee, that I have
requested Count von Holckt, the first gentleman of the bedchamber,
to appoint you physician to His Majesty.'</p>
<p>The doctor was rendered breathless. Some of the high colour
faded from his bold face. His blue eyes seemed to increase in
prominence. His full, sensuous lips parted, but it was a moment
before he could speak, and then it was only to falter expressions
of his sense of the great, the unexpected honour which opened to
him the door to fortune.</p>
<p>'I take it, then, that you accept. That is almost all that is
now necessary. There is just one thing more. In mentioning your
skill, I had something more in mind than your skill as a physician,
although without this the rest would be naught. His Majesty, as you
are aware, is in a precarious state of health. His constitution has
been sadly undermined, and the attentions of a skilful physician
are urgently demanded. Now I need not tell you, doctor, that a
truly skilful physician sets about the cure of a disease by
removing the cause. The chief cause here is Count von Holckt. It is
to this gentleman that you will find it necessary to apply the
cautery.'</p>
<p>Rantzau paused. The doctor, who had not yet recovered his
colour, was steadily regarding him. 'You mean that I am to poison
him?'</p>
<p>The Count was more shocked by the cold matter-of-fact tone of
the question than by the question itself. The ghost of a smile
flitted across his bleak countenance.</p>
<p>'It would be effective,' he admitted. 'But it had not occurred
to me. And we are in Denmark, not Italy. It will not be necessary
to go to such extremes. In the course of the foreign tour upon
which you will accompany the King, and in the intimate association
with him resulting from your position, it should not be difficult
for a man of your attainments and force of character to obtain an
ascendancy over a mind so enfeebled as that of His Majesty. In the
sequel it should be easy for you to employ it so as to procure the
disgrace and dismissal of this corrupt associate, to whom so much
of His Majesty's condition is to be attributed. After that it will
be your duty to replace the evil influence by a beneficent one, and
restrain the King in those courses which at present are destroying
his body and his soul. There is nothing in this proposal that may
be said to lie outside a doctor's province. It is upon your
confidence in your ability to perform the task that your
appointment now rests.'</p>
<p>Struensee's answer was prompt. 'That confidence I certainly
possess. Your lordship may account the task as good as
accomplished.' Then he permitted himself a short, cynical laugh.
'And it is Count von Holckt who appoints me, you said. The
situation has its ironies.'</p>
<p>What ironies it was to hold Rantzau was not to discover fully
until some months later when His Majesty returned from that tour,
completely under the tutelage of the physician, who had certainly
made good his promise. Von Holckt's dismissal by the King, at
Struensee's instigation, had followed within a month of their
departure from Copenhagen. But having so speedily and successfully
accomplished the first part of his task, the doctor paused to
consider where he stood, before proceeding to the regeneration of
the monarch in his care. A door had been opened to his ambition as
a doctor when he had been appointed physician to the King. Now that
in obedience to his instructions he had acquired such an ascendancy
over his charge that Christian was become as a puppet in his hands,
the creature of his will, he perceived that a door stood open also
to his ambitions as a man. If he set about rebuilding the young
King's burnt-out strength of body, restoring with it some vigour to
his mind, Struensee would remain the royal physician. But if,
instead, he were to continue the King in his present effete
languor, Struensee's empire over him might be a source of almost
unbounded power; such power as von Holckt had possessed, but had
lacked the wit to employ. Struensee suffered from no such lack. He
had a high confidence in himself in matters other than medicine,
and all the contempt of the clever man of humble origins for those
whom birth alone exalts. Thus he doomed the degenerate prince in
his charge to a continuation of the pursuits so largely responsible
for his imbecility. In these pursuits, Struensee, who under all his
strength was himself something of a voluptuary, encouraged him by
precept and example as vicious as had been von Holckt's. The result
was that when the King came home from that foreign tour, in the
course of which he had covered himself with ignominy, he was
infinitely feebler than when he had set out, and he had now no will
that was not the will of Struensee.</p>
<p>Afire with indignation, Rantzau sought his faithless agent in
the splendid apartments which the doctor had appropriated to his
own use in the Christianborg Palace. And for half an hour that
great nobleman, General Count von Rantzau-Aschberg, was kept
cooling his heels among the clients crowding Struensee's
antechamber.</p>
<p>When at last he was admitted, it was to find himself received
with affable condescension by a large man in mulberry velvet laced
with gold and glittering with jewels, in whom it was not easy to
discover the plain, sober downright man whom a few months ago he
had appointed physician to the King. Without even rising to greet
his exalted visitor, Struensee extended languidly a powerful
hand.</p>
<p>'Ah, my friend! In what am I to have the honour of serving
you</p>
<p>The pallor of Rantzau's face under its black-powdered hair was
deathly. His eyes were points of steel. Standing stiff and
straight, he ignored the extended hand.</p>
<p>'Friend!' he echoed. 'I do not number lackeys among my friends,
Struensee. Be good enough to remember it. I am here to ask of you
an account of your stewardship.'</p>
<p>The full red lips smiled. But the prominent blue eyes were full
of malice.</p>
<p>'What a tone, Count! And to scorn a friendship that you may yet
need! You have a grievance, I suppose. On what grounds? Have I done
less than I undertook to do? Have I not removed the evil influences
that were about His Majesty?'</p>
<p>Rantzau was at a disadvantage. 'By what have you replaced them?'
was all that he could rejoin.</p>
<p>Struensee spread his jewelled hands. 'By an influence that will
be to the advantage of Denmark, as I shall hope soon to show. A
strong hand was needed here to guide the King in his
government.'</p>
<p>The Count's stare was hard. 'You cannot have the temerity to
suggest that you aspire to supply it.'</p>
<p>'They are wise, Count, who range themselves on my side. In my
antechamber you will find some nobles as stiff-necked as yourself.
Their example is one that you might profitably follow.'</p>
<p>Rantzau choked. 'Impudent buffoon! Do you forget that it is I
who placed you' where you stand? Rascal! Do you imagine that the
hand that raised you up cannot pull you down again? I shall see the
King today, and&mdash;'</p>
<p>'You will not see the King.' Struensee's voice was as calm as it
was hard. Master of the situation, he could afford to keep his
temper. 'The delicate state of His Majesty's health does not permit
him to grant audience at present save as may be sanctioned by his
physician.'</p>
<p>'You insolent buffoon!' raged the quivering Rantzau.</p>
<p>'Ah! Now I really think you go too far.'</p>
<p>'I am prepared,' said Rantzau, 'to go a good deal farther, as
you shall find.'</p>
<p>Struensee reached for a bell that stood on the small table at
his elbow. A chamberlain appeared at once.</p>
<p>'The door!' he said in a voice of iron. 'Count von
Rantzau-Aschberg to the door.'</p>
<p>And so, almost ignominiously, that great nobleman was thrust
from the presence of the upstart doctor.</p>
<p>On an inspiration he sought the young Queen at once, and was
graciously received by that handsome stately woman, whose clear
eyes were haunted by a wistfulness the disillusions of her marriage
had procured her.</p>
<p>He went to exhort her, with a calm under which the anger
seething in him was not to be suspected, to the effort which she
alone could make to break the shackles with which the King was
being loaded. It was an exhortation that at first merely cast her
into a deeper wistfulness. Sadly she shook her red-gold head.</p>
<p>'It was my hope, Count, that you came to help me. Instead, you
merely urge me, who am helpless, to help myself.'</p>
<p>'Madame, you are not helpless. You are the mother of the heir to
the throne. In this and in the love and reverence of the nation
lies your strength. This villain Struensee has overreached himself
in his blind conceit. He isolates His Majesty on the grounds of
health. If the King is too ill to grant audience to those who have
the right to approach him, it follows that he is too ill to govern.
A regency must be appointed to rule until he is restored to health;
and the proper regent, the regent Denmark will uphold, once this
state of things is disclosed, will be Your Majesty.'</p>
<p>Excitement brightened her eyes and quickened the heave of her
full breast in its rigid, low-cut corsage. 'You think I could
accomplish that? You are not overlooking the hold which Struensee
has secured?'</p>
<p>The Count's smile was scornfully confident. 'You need but to
inform him of your intention, and you will see him shrivel.
Whatever his hold upon the King, he cannot prevent you from
convening the Council of State, and of the Council's support I, as
one of its members, can confidently assure you.' Quietly he added:
'I trust, madame, that once the regency is in your hands, your
first act will be to break this impudent adventurer. After that,
the guidance of the King will be Your Majesty's care.'</p>
<p>Thus Rantzau showed her how the neglected wife of a King might
become a Queen <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>To a woman in her case the prospect was uplifting. Without loss
of an hour she commanded Struensee to attend her.</p>
<p>She received him alone in that same little boudoir so French in
character, with its gilt furnishings and striped brocades, in which
her interview with Rantzau had taken place. Seated at her little
inlaid escritoire, the doctor in his courtly finery standing before
her, she disclosed the project of establishing a regency.</p>
<p>In dismay he perceived that the only avenue of retreat before
this attack had been blocked by his own pronouncements upon the
royal health. It remained only to go boldly forward. Of his dismay
no shadow came to overcast the florid, not unhandsome countenance,
and there was only acquiescence in his answer.</p>
<p>'It is most reasonable, madame, considering His Majesty's
condition. As a physician it is my duty to be frank with Your
Majesty. The King's sickness is not only of the body, but also of
the mind. A regent becomes, therefore, a necessity; and there is no
regent, if I may presume to say so, fitter than Your Majesty.'</p>
<p>She considered him searchingly, unable to dissemble from her
glance all the surprise with which this unexpected acquiescence
filled her. Tall and athletic he stood, with submissiveness to her
orders in every line of him. Rantzau, she thought, had been right
to say that there would be no resistance. And yet, she wondered,
had Rantzau been altogether right? Here was no cringing of defeat,
no hangdog look of a villain foiled. Whilst her eyes still searched
his candid countenance he spoke again.</p>
<p>'It is desirable, too, for the King's own sake. In the heavy
task I have undertaken, it has not helped me that affairs should
come to set their strain upon a mind unequal to them. I have done
what I could to ease the burden. Perhaps in this, in transcending
the strict limits of my physician's office, I may have done wrong,
and I may have been misunderstood. I shall be glad to be delivered
from such a situation. Also, once His Majesty is relieved of these
cares, it may be easier for me to repair the ravages to his health
and to restrain him in the regrettable excesses which may be as
much the cause as the result of his condition.'</p>
<p>She was borne from amazement to amazement by his words. Without
any apparent intent to do so, he was affording her an explanation
of circumstances hitherto attributed to sinister designs of his
own. She began to ask herself, as she listened to that rich
persuasive voice, upon what grounds those conclusions had been
reached. Finding the evidence slender and vague, she was moved to
wonder whether injustice might not have been done him. When from
this, she came once more to examine his attitude in the matter of
the proposed regency, she was all but convinced that Struensee had
been cruelly misjudged.</p>
<p>'I am glad, doctor, that you take this view.' She spoke slowly,
quietly. 'The Council of State, too, will I am sure welcome your
confirmation of the prudence of this measure.'</p>
<p>'The Council of State?' There was a faint note of surprise in
the question. Then, almost imperceptibly he shrugged. 'The opinion
of the Council of State is of less significance to me than that of
Your Majesty, whom I regard as the only person really
concerned.'</p>
<p>'The Council of State is equally concerned, since it must share
the responsibilities of the regency.'</p>
<p>It was now, when she no longer looked for it, that she beheld
dismay upon his countenance. 'The Council!' he ejaculated. 'Lord
God!'</p>
<p>Her stare hardened. 'What is in your mind, sir?'</p>
<p>'Fear, madame,' he answered promptly, almost tragically. 'Fear
that for all your wit and perspicacity you may become a tool in the
hands of a group of self-seekers who will urge you to their own
ends.'</p>
<p>'You are frank,' she told him, with cold displeasure. 'Something
too frank, I think.'</p>
<p>He showed distress. He advanced a little. His fine, bold eyes,
whilst pleading, yet held an oddly compelling power. 'Set it down
to my reverence and regard for Your Majesty. In studying the
anatomy of the body, the physician learns something of the anatomy
of the soul. It is not easy to withhold such knowledge when there
is an overmastering anxiety to serve.'</p>
<p>'I...I do not think I understand,' she said. But under his
hypnotic gaze, her tone already was less distant.</p>
<p>He hesitated, still looking at her, with an intentness almost
wistful.</p>
<p>'I must risk Your Majesty's reproof again. If you take the
Council of State to assist your regency, you will be in danger of
placing the power in hands that may unscrupulously misuse it. I am
acquainted with these men.'</p>
<p>'You may know as much as you claim of the anatomy of the soul.
But you can know little of the anatomy of government, or you would
realise that a regency could be established on no other
foundation.'</p>
<p>'Not an avowed regency. But where is the need to avow it? Since
it is in Your Majesty's power to become a regent in fact, why be
content with being a regent in name? You will best wield a regent's
power by not actually assuming the office. The acts of government
will be yours; only the signature the King's. Your influence with
His Majesty will make this easy.'</p>
<p>'My influence with His Majesty! Do you venture to mock me?'</p>
<p>'God forbid, madame. None grieves more deeply or sincerely than
I at the King's insensibility to the inestimable blessing which
descended upon him when Your Majesty became his consort.' The
booming voice gathered fervour as he proceeded. 'If his mind were
less diseased he would thank God on his knees night and morning for
a queen who in every sense is far above the deserts of any king in
Europe. Forgive me, madame, if my tongue betrays too deep a
feeling. It moves me so profoundly to sorrow and to anger to see
your incomparable worth neglected, that I cannot...I cannot...' His
throbbing accents faltered. He made a little gesture of despair.
'Forgive me, madame. Forgive me!'</p>
<p>The blue eyes that regarded him were moist. The girl's lips,
full and sensuous as his own, were suddenly tremulous. 'Hush,
Struensee! This...this is very nearly treason, my friend.'</p>
<p>The word produced an agitation in him. 'You recognise me for
your friend, madame. Now God be praised that you should see so
clearly. I am your friend and servant now and always and in all
things.'</p>
<p>She made an effort to retreat before this spiritual onslaught,
to entrench herself in the stiff formal dignity of the courtly
etiquette upon which her training had made her ever insistent. But
she only half succeeded.</p>
<p>'We are straying from the point, I think. We were concerned with
my influence with His Majesty. Yourself, you have admitted that it
does not exist.'</p>
<p>'But it can so easily be established. Not the influence of the
wife, I admit. But the influence of the Queen, which is all that
Your Majesty's aims require. Trust me to bring him to perceive that
he could have no deputy more competent than Your Majesty, and to
persuade him to place the reins of government in your hands. His
indolent, self-indulgent inclinations will make it easy, and for
Your Majesty's enactments the King's signature will be readily
forthcoming. And this without any Council of State to hamper
you.'</p>
<p>She rose from her writing-table. The Queen cast aside all the
panoply of etiquette. It was the woman who approached him, aglow at
the prospect of wielding such undisputed power. It was no vain
boast of Struensee's that he understood the anatomy of the
soul.</p>
<p>'How we may be mistaken!' she murmured. 'You prove yourself the
first true, selfless friend I have known since I came to
Denmark.'</p>
<p>Impulsively she held out her hand to him. As impulsively he fell
on his knees. 'My Queen!' he said, and devoutly bore her fingers to
his lips.</p>
<p>On the morrow Matilda sent for Rantzau, for the purpose of
disabusing his mind on the subject of Struensee. She awaited his
coming in some disquiet, fearing his opposition to the amended
project under which she proposed to act without a Council. To her
surprise, and perhaps to her relief, she learnt that he had
suddenly left Copenhagen. She was not told that on the previous
evening he had received an order bearing the King's signature,
requiring him to depart the capital within twelve hours and
withdraw to his estates of Aschberg in Holstein.</p>
<p>To Rantzau the hand of Struensee had been plain in this. He had
perceived in it the defeat of his attempt to influence the Queen;
and his first indignant impulse was to resist the order. Then,
realising that his arrest and possible effacement must follow
disobedience, he decided that he would live to fight another day,
and so departed.</p>
<p>To Aschberg he was followed in the succeeding months by rumours
of events ever more startling and incredible in the affairs of
Denmark. First came word that John Frederick Struensee, the doctor,
son of the simple country clergyman, had been ennobled, and then
that, as Count von Struensee, he had assumed the office of First
Minister of the Crown and was become the virtual ruler of Denmark,
and the acknowledged lover of Queen Matilda.</p>
<p>To General Count von Rantzau-Aschberg this last was the most
incomprehensible feature of all. He remembered the reserved Matilda
he had known, so calm of eye, so stately of movement, in all things
decorous and formal, and he contrasted that memory of her with the
almost hoydenish reported actuality of a woman who brazenly
flaunted her passion for the upstart she had helped to elevate.</p>
<p>After that every report reaching Aschberg from the capital told
of Struensee's steadily growing power: of the revolution he was
effecting in the system of government; of the offices he abolished,
and the new ones he set up; of the despotism he had established
jointly with Queen Matilda and in the shadow and name of a king who
daily deepened in imbecility. There came, too, incredibly
scandalous stories of the court over which Struensee and Matilda
presided, and of the flagrant wantonness of the once rigidly
decorous young Queen, who now adapted herself familiarly to the
raffish company that now made up her court at Hirscholm, a court
festering with all the vices of Versailles, but adorned by few of
Versailles' superficial graces. It was accepted as an epitome of
her degradation that when she hunted nowadays she rode impudently
astride, in breeches, a garment flagrantly ill-becoming the rich
muliebrity of Her Majesty's figure.</p>
<p>The King, too dull and feeble to realise his own shame or to
resent the terrible dominance of his wife's lover, moved
listlessly, an object of contempt and derision in that disreputable
court.</p>
<p>It is in the way of upstarts to overreach themselves, and it was
in thus outraging the feelings of a staid and almost puritanical
people that Struensee came to render himself vulnerable by bringing
into contempt with the nation a Queen upon whom he depended for his
power.</p>
<p>General Count von Rantzau-Aschberg, the one man in whose
position and influence lay the strength to take advantage of this
vulnerability, and in whose ambition lay the will to do so, might,
in his retirement, have overlooked the opportunity had he not been
sought at Aschberg by a gentleman still young, of a surpassing
elegance in all his appointments, and suavely master of
himself.</p>
<p>'Count von Holckt!' For once Rantzau was almost out of
countenance at the appearance of this unexpected visitor, in whom
it was impossible for him to see a friend.</p>
<p>'I take you by surprise.' There was a disarming smile on the
dark, clear-cut face of that notorious libertine. The smile
broadened; it became a little twisted. 'You did not use me very
well when you induced me to bring Struensee into the royal
household. But whatever my faults&mdash;and, God forgive me, they
are many&mdash;I was never a creature of resentments. And even if I
were, the present would not be the season to indulge them. The
times demand that gentlemen should stand together. Our supreme need
of you must stifle idle resentments.'</p>
<p>Rantzau covered his contempt of the minion by a mechanical
urbanity. He took the delicately proffered hand, he set a chair for
his visitor.</p>
<p>'In what is it my honour to serve you?'</p>
<p>'It is not a question of serving me, my lord. That is something
I could never presume to ask of you. It is a question of serving
Denmark and the King. I am here as the agent of Queen Juliana.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' The fine brows were raised on that pallid face. A touch of
irony was not to be excluded from his tone. 'The stepmother becomes
solicitous!'</p>
<p>Von Holckt tossed back the laces from a fine hand in a gesture
that was almost of intercession. 'Do not permit a thought of that
relationship to prejudice you, my lord. You may believe in the
Queen-Dowager's concern for the King without believing in her
affection for him. All that you need to believe is that the
Queen-Dowager's own danger is her main concern.'</p>
<p>'That will offer no difficulty, once I perceive the danger.'</p>
<p>'A knowledge of what is happening in Copenhagen will make it
obvious. His Majesty's condition is deplorable.'</p>
<p>A little warmth crept at last into Rantzau's manner. 'I am aware
of that. You are not to suppose that the tongue of scandal is not
heard at Aschberg.'</p>
<p>'I doubt if even scandal can have made you realise all the ugly
actuality. It makes credible the widespread, well-founded opinion
that this scoundrel Struensee, your lordship's sometime friend, is
employing his skill as a physician slowly to poison the King.'</p>
<p>'My God!' Rantzau was shaken from his calm. 'But to what end,
sir? What more can that villain desire than he already grasps?'</p>
<p>In his pleasant, level modulation of voice, von Holckt
explained. Struensee's clear aim was to set up a regency, composed
of himself and the Queen, his mistress, to govern the kingdom
during the minority of the Crown Prince, who was now three years of
age.</p>
<p>'But how will that increase the power he already grasps?'</p>
<p>'It will not. But it will add security to his position. The
King, however feeble, is still the King. Nothing material can be
accomplished without his consent and signature. As long as the King
lives there will always be the danger that what Struensee has done,
another might do: obtain over His Majesty an ascendancy akin to
that now held by Struensee. I admit that it would not be easy. But
once the King were dead, it would be impossible.'</p>
<p>'I see,' said Rantzau, and he shivered a little. With his chin
in the ruffles he moved slowly, thoughtfully across to the open
fireplace. Mechanically he held out one of his delicate hands to
the blaze of the piled logs. 'I see,' he said again, in deepest
gloom. Then on a sudden thought he asked: 'But you spoke of danger
to the Queen-Dowager?'</p>
<p>'It is not to be supposed that the Danish nobles look on
complacently. Struensee is aware of it. He must ssume that the
Queen-Dowager will supply, as indeed she would, a natural
rallying-point for those who are hostile to the regency. Unless she
forestalls him, she may have to face exile, or worse, for herself
and her son.'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes. That becomes clear.' Rantzau set his back to the fire,
and tall and straight, faced his visitor. 'But what do you seek
from me?'</p>
<p>Deliberate, almost languid, von Holckt drew forth a gold
snuffbox on the lid of which an alluring Aphrodite was enamelled.
'That you attempt,' said he, 'to undo some of the mischief you have
done, now that you perceive how great the mischief is.'</p>
<p>For all his self-control Rantzau winced under that airy
impudence. His dark eyes considered the graceful minion, who
composedly and delicately helped himself to snuff.</p>
<p>'Having gone from Scylla to Charybdis, we are now to return to
Scylla. Is that the purpose?'</p>
<p>Von Holckt snapped down the lid of his box. 'The purpose is to
steer the ship of state safely between the two, and if there is in
Denmark a man who can still accomplish it, that man is General
Count von Rantzau-Aschberg.</p>
<p>'You give me news, sir. If I believed this, do you suppose that
I should have sat idle here, bewailing my futility?'</p>
<p>Von Holckt raised his brows. He fetched a sigh. 'Thank God I was
never troubled by modesty. You show me how it may distort a man's
vision.' He rose, shaking out the whaleboned skirts of his sky-blue
coat. 'Is it for me to remind you of the great influence of your
name in Denmark? Must I tell you that nowhere is that influence
more powerful than with the army?'</p>
<p>'Struensee controls the army,' Rantzau interrupted. 'I have
informed myself of that.'</p>
<p>'Ah! Then you have not been quite idle. Your mind at least has
already turned to the notion I came to arouse. That is to the good.
Struensee controls the army, yes. But he controls it only because
that control has never been disputed by the one man who can
successfully dispute it. If General Count von Rantzau-Aschberg were
to offer himself as a leader to deliver our unfortunate King from
his position of ignominy and dishonour, there is not a soldier in
Denmark who would not rally to him. If we have the army, Struensee
will be helpless; and if we have you, my lord, we have the
army.'</p>
<p>Rantzau looked at him in silence for a spell, and his eyes
smouldered in that white, bleak face. At last: 'It is an odd thing,
sir, that you should be the agent to point out to me how the King
is to be saved.'</p>
<p>The young man shrugged. His little twisted smile reappeared.</p>
<p>'Fate's revenge upon you, my lord, for your rashness in
appointing Struensee to supplant me.'</p>
<p>Humbled a little by the situation, the old nobleman had no
resentments for this light impudence, or even for the circumstance
that he was entering into alliance with this young profligate whom
he despised.</p>
<p>On the morrow, with von Holckt beside him in his great
travelling-carriage, followed by an almost royal train that
included his chaplain, his doctor, his secretary, his chamberlain,
his valet, his cook, and a posse of grooms and footmen, Rantzau
rolled out of Holstein in a December mist, and descended upon
Copenhagen in defiance of the ban under which he lay.</p>
<p>There, in her Palace of Fredensborg, whither von Holckt
conducted him, Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel received him
graciously and in complete oblivion of all past animosities.</p>
<p>She was attended by the uncouth, untidy General Eichstedt, by
her secretary, Guldberg, and her son, Prince Frederick, the dull,
stocky lad of eighteen, who had inherited her gooseberry eyes and
muddy complexion.</p>
<p>She was a plump, florid woman, not yet forty, with a
heavy-lipped, haughty mouth, pale, prominent eyes, and a resolute
chin. Once Rantzau had sneeringly said of her that she was never
more dangerous than when she was effusive. She was effusive
now.</p>
<p>'My dear Count!' She held out both hands to him. 'Never could
you be more welcome. Your coming brings us the assurance of
victory: to me and to these few good, loyal friends of His
Majesty's, who will not spare themselves in serving with you to
thwart those wretches.'</p>
<p>'Wretches, madame?'</p>
<p>'Struensee and his accomplice, Christian's faithless wife.'</p>
<p>There was an edge to her tone in that allusion to Matilda. It
reminded him of this German woman's hostility to her
stepdaughter-in-law from the time when there had been no just
grounds for it. The gallantry for which in his younger days Rantzau
had been famous, had with age been transmuted into chivalry. This
glimpse of feminine hatred repelled him. Its effect was to deepen
his compassion for the misguided Matilda. He expressed it
frankly.</p>
<p>'I regard Her Majesty, madame, as a victim, not an accomplice.
Any action of mine must aim as much at her deliverance as the
King's.'</p>
<p>There was a tightening of Juliana's heavy mouth, a solemnity in
the eyes of those about her. The ready-witted von Holckt suavely
saved the situation.</p>
<p>'But, of course. That is the view of each of us. The only
possible view. But concern for His Majesty must not blind us to the
dangers of leaving the Queen at liberty.'</p>
<p>'At liberty!' Rantzau was shocked. 'Is it proposed to confine
her?'</p>
<p>Von Holckt spread his hands, a gentle air of regret in his
handsome eyes.</p>
<p>'Unless we do so, we leave her with power to avenge upon us the
fate of the scoundrel who has abused her youth and
inexperience.'</p>
<p>'I honour you, von Holckt, for your view of her case. But once
Struensee has been pulled down, what power will the Queen
retain?'</p>
<p>General Eichstedt cut in impatiently, roughly. 'The power which
Struensee now yields. The power that lies in the impotent hands of
the King. Instead of Struensee, it will be Queen Matilda who will
make Christian dance like a puppet. And what tune do you suppose
she will call? Answer that for yourself.'</p>
<p>'And there is something more,' said Juliana, from her gilded
chair. 'You are not to forget that the Danes are a prudish people.'
She sighed heavily. She spoke as one weighed down by sorrow.
'Perhaps it has not reached Holstein what scandalous frivolities
Struensee has brought into Court life and what deep offence they
have given. The people speak of Matilda as another Messalina. You
may hear at any street-corner the name they have for her Palace of
Hirscholm. The fear of Struensee is their only restraint. Once he
is removed, the indignation may explode, and this unfortunate
Matilda may have to face the violence of the mob. Could we suffer
that?'</p>
<p>It was a reason that stifled his deep repugnance. He passed to
other matters. He desired to know what plans they proposed, what
measures they had considered. Guldberg, the secretary, informed
him. It was proposed to proceed by arresting Struensee upon an
indictment for high treason, usurpation, and abuse of power. This,
once the conditions permitting it should be ripe; and Rantzau was
plainly shown by the others that they depended upon him to ripen
the conditions.</p>
<p>Erect and cold of manner, he received the flatteries with which
in this respect they plied him. Before engaging himself finally, he
desired to know what measures of government were to follow if the
conspiracy succeeded. The Dowager answered him.</p>
<p>'A council, of course, will be formed, to guide His
Majesty.'</p>
<p>'Have you determined its composition?'</p>
<p>Juliana's effusive smile was spread for him once more. 'We have
determined only that the proper Lord President for such a council
must be a nobleman of your eminence, influence, and attainments,
Count.'</p>
<p>Any lingering doubt he may have had of their complete integrity
was dismissed before an assurance such as this. He bowed to their
will, consented to shoulder the task, and thereafter with quiet,
indefatigable zeal set about accomplishing it.</p>
<p>Throwing open his splendid house in Copenhagen, he entertained
almost prodigally. He renewed and widened his associations with
that army of which once he had been so splendid an ornament.</p>
<p>It was not to have been expected that the despotism of an
upstart such as Struensee could be accepted without deep
resentment. The revolutionary changes he had made, the rights he
had infringed, the privileges he had destroyed had rendered him
detestable to every member of the Danish nobility, whilst the
licentiousness of his private life and the seduction of the Queen
had earned him the odium of the people. But so shrewdly had he
contrived, and so strong was his grip of power, that all this
hatred seethed in secret. Openly no man dared avow it for fear of
betrayal by his neighbour. To obtain these avowals required all
Rantzau's skill and even a certain measure of reckless
self-exposure. But he obtained them so fully as to be assured that
all that was needed here was a leader for the great multitude of
secret malcontents.</p>
<p>From the moment that he offered himself in this capacity matters
moved so rapidly that within three weeks of Rantzau's arrival in
Copenhagen there was scarcely an officer in the capital who was not
pledged to bring his men to the movement once the signal were
given. And the signal must be given soon. There was no time to
lose. If any rumour of these activities should reach Struensee
before they were ready to deliver the blow, Ran tzau knew that his
head would be lost to him.</p>
<p>And Struensee was not asleep. Rantzau's bold emergence from his
Holstein retirement, his open house in Copenhagen, and above all
the amity of his present relations with the Queen-Dowager, were
matters to draw the minister's attention; for Struensee could have
no illusions on the score of Rantzau's real feelings towards him.
His friends, too, were vigilant, and from more than one of them he
received a hint that the army might not be as well affected as he
supposed.</p>
<p>For all his power, he hesitated to move against so influential a
nobleman as General Count von Rantzau-Aschberg without some better
justification than that of the old ban, for which no real reason
could be supplied. That justification should be found: his spies
would find it for him. Meanwhile, however, he ordered the
Falkenschjold Regiment, upon every man of which he knew that he
could depend, to be brought at once to Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Warned of this, Rantzau perceived in it the signal for action.
He and his associates must strike before the Falkenschjold Regiment
arrived. He spent a feverish day on his final dispositions.</p>
<p>That January night he showed himself at Court attending a ball
at the Palace of Christianborg, whither the King and Queen had now
removed from Hirscholm. Moving through the glittering, courtly
throng, the spare, elegant, faintly sinister Count Rantzau came
face to face with the all-powerful Struensee, a massive figure in
incongruous pink and silver. He saw the florid countenance lose
something of its bonhomie as their eyes met. Nevertheless, the
minister hailed him airily, with a lift of the hand.</p>
<p>'Ah, Lord Count!'</p>
<p>Rantzau bowed stiffly. 'At your excellency's orders.'</p>
<p>The blue eyes narrowed under their reddish brows. The smile was
faintly sneering. 'Here's humility.' He stood squarely before the
Count. 'I wonder should I beware of that quality in you. I suspect
you of avoiding me. You must come and see me, Count. We should have
much to say to each other.'</p>
<p>'Your excellency is gracious.'</p>
<p>Struensee's sneer became more marked. 'No compliments between
old friends. When will you come?'</p>
<p>'Perhaps sooner than you expect me.'</p>
<p>'Eh?' Suddenly stern, Struensee gripped him by the shoulder. His
tone hardened to command. 'You will wait upon me tomorrow morning,
if you please, Count.'</p>
<p>'I shall not fail, excellency.' Rantzau bowed, and passed on,
followed by the suspicion-laden glance of those hard blue eyes.</p>
<p>Sauntering through the crowd, Rantzau came to a settle, set a
little apart, on which a slight, almost boyish figure, in
saffron-coloured satin, glittering with orders, was loosely
sprawling. The Count bowed low over the limp hand extended to
him.</p>
<p>'You are not merry, sire. You do not dance. Your air is
weary.'</p>
<p>A pallid, wasted face, with deep brown stains about the dull
eyes, was slowly raised. 'Ah, Rantzau! Is it you? Weary, eh? On my
life, does it surprise you? Matilda imagines that this is gay; that
this is life. This dressed-up pretence. Pack of play-actors! Give
me men and women who are flesh and blood. No ceremony. No silly
etiquette. Freedom. That's what I lack. That's why I'm pale and
ill. I swoon among these stinking perfumes. My God! I stifle. I
perish of weariness. And there's none to lift a finger to help me;
to open a door to let a poor King out of this damned gaol.'</p>
<p>Rantzau bent lower; his eyes were gleaming. The mood he had
stirred in this flaxen-haired half-wit who responded so readily to
suggestion could not better serve his immediate need.</p>
<p>'There is myself, sire. It is to open just such a door that I am
here.' More he dared not say. 'Let me come to you soon, sire.'</p>
<p>The young man's eyes lost some of their dullness. 'You can't
come too soon for that, Rantzau. On my faith, you can't.'</p>
<p>'That is a command, sire.' Rantzau bowed low, and then, aware
that the Queen and Struensee, now together, were sharply observing
him he took his leave, and passed on.</p>
<p>Christian, who had told him that he could not come too soon,
little suspected how prompt would be the Count's obedience. Three
hours later, just as His Majesty had been put to bed, he was
disturbed by an altercation in the antechamber. It ended in the
abrupt entrance, together, of the King's valet and Count
Rantzau.</p>
<p>The King sat up in bed. Below his swathed head, his fair pallid
face looked startled in the candlelight. Rantzau thrust past the
valet, who still would have restrained him. 'Your Majesty sees that
I lose no time in obeying your command. And there is no time to
lose. You are in gravest danger, sire.'</p>
<p>'In danger!' His Majesty's voice shook. 'I am the King. How can
I be in danger?'</p>
<p>Rantzau was as emphatic as he was brief.</p>
<p>'Count von Struensee is destroying your kingship, your state,
your honour, your very life. It is time to act, sire.' Shortly he
presented arguments to penetrate those poor wits, dulled almost to
extinction, ending on an appeal to vanity. 'Will you rouse
yourself, and be a king? Or will you allow yourself to be destroyed
by this scoundrel who has already rendered you a despised, obedient
puppet?'</p>
<p>'A puppet!' Christian's voice was shrill with sudden fury. 'Do
you dare to call me that?'</p>
<p>'God forbid, sire. I tell you what this villain has taught your
subjects to call you.'</p>
<p>The lad fell into blasphemy, and after some incoherencies, 'I
take God to witness,' he cried, 'I'll have his head if that is
true. His head.'</p>
<p>Rantzau presented a paper and a pen. 'Sign, sire, and the truth
of it shall be established.'</p>
<p>But the King shrank back. 'What is it? I am always signing. God
knows what I sign. What is it?'</p>
<p>Rantzau thrust the pen into his hand. He became sternly
dominant. 'It is an order of arrest. Sign, sire.' The King signed,
grumbling foolishly the while.</p>
<p>'And now this.' Rantzau presented a second paper.</p>
<p>'What? Another? What is this?' He held it to the candlelight,
and as he read the name upon it, panic leapt to his eyes. 'Lord
God! Matilda! Arrest Matilda? Are you mad? Do you know how angry
she would be? Do you know?' He became abject. He thrust it from
him. 'No. No. Take it away. Take it away.'</p>
<p>For a moment Rantzau trembled. Without the warrant no officer
would dare to arrest the Queen, no prison would open to receive
her; and as long as she remained at liberty he knew that the arrest
of Struensee was worse than idle, a mere precursor of ruin. Her
dominion over Christian would constrain from him a signature that
would deliver Struensee, and might even now send Rantzau and his
associates to the headsman.</p>
<p>All the strength of his soul was in Rantzau's eyes, all the
force of his will in his voice. 'I pledge my word that this is no
more than a measure for Her Majesty's safety. No evil is intended
her. I pledge my word. Now sign, sire.'</p>
<p>And the weakling, under a dominance that at least was being
exerted for good, shrugged and signed.</p>
<p>Eichstedt, who waited in the antechamber, was dispatched by
Rantzau to execute the warrant upon the Queen. Himself he went down
the staircase to the mezzanine where Struensee had his apartments.
In the gallery before Struensee's door he was awaited by Colonel
Kohler Banner of the guards and four of his men.</p>
<p>The page who opened to their knock was silently overpowered.
Treading softly, the six men entered the gorgeous bedchamber.</p>
<p>A candle burning on a bedside table showed the bulky frame of
the sleeper on the opulent bed. A book that he had been reading
when slumber overtook him lay on the floor where it had fallen.</p>
<p>Kohler Banner stepped forward, and took him by the shoulder. He
started up with incoherent mutterings. Then, as his eyes caught the
gleam of steel and alighted on the gold-laced white uniforms, and
his awakening senses gathered some significance from this portent,
he thrust a leg from the bed, gasping.</p>
<p>'What is it? What is it? Kohler Banner! What are you doing here?
Great God, what is it?'</p>
<p>Through the line of white uniforms stepped a tall dark figure
with a pallid deeply lined face that in the candlelight looked
almost ghostly.</p>
<p>'It is I, doctor. I am here according to your command.'</p>
<p>'My command?'</p>
<p>'To wait upon you this morning. I trust that I am early enough.
It has just struck four.'</p>
<p>Struensee scowled from a pallid, angry face. 'The jest is out of
season. I'll know who admitted you, by&mdash;'</p>
<p>'We commanded admission in the King's name. Colonel Banner has a
warrant for your arrest.'</p>
<p>Struensee, stricken with an unreasoning fear that shattered his
high confidence, stared at him with bulging eyes. Then he
rallied.</p>
<p>'A warrant!' He was scornful. 'You've gone mad, I think. Whose
signature is on this warrant?'</p>
<p>'The King's.' He made a sign to Banner. 'Perform your duty,
Colonel.'</p>
<p>But at the touch of Banner's hand upon his shoulder, Struensee
bounded, bellowing, from the bed.</p>
<p>'What is the charge in this worthless warrant, my masters?' he
demanded.</p>
<p>'High treason, doctor. The usurpation of powers to which you
have no licit title.'</p>
<p>Struensee's livid face broke into a grin that displayed his
teeth.</p>
<p>By God, Rantzau, I'll have your head for this. Banner, you fool,
do you want to go the same way? Your warrant is so much waste
paper. And even if it were not, the King's signature tomorrow shall
make a mock of his signature tonight.'</p>
<p>'It might,' said Rantzau, 'if it could be procured. But who is
to procure it?'</p>
<p>'The Queen, you fool,' was the confident answer. 'The Queen, as
you shall discover to the cost of your neck.'</p>
<p>Rantzau sourly smiled. 'The Queen, doctor, is herself being
placed under arrest at this moment.'</p>
<p>The big man stared a moment in sheer incredulity. Then he
actually laughed.</p>
<p>'Has your madness really carried you so far? <i>Quem Deus vult
perdere</i>...! You make arrests, then, without charge?'</p>
<p>'Oh, no, doctor. The charge is, as in your own case, high
treason. For in a queen adultery is high treason. In your reckless
effrontery you seem to have forgotten that. It has woven the rope
for your scoundrelly neck, Struensee.'</p>
<p>The usurper, abruptly robbed of all the confidence he had been
steadily recovering, reeled back with terror in his eyes.</p>
<p>'You...you will have to prove it,' he faltered foolishly.</p>
<p>'It will not be difficult to prove what is already notorious.'
Rantzau stepped past him, past the bed, to the wall, where a
tapestry hung depicting the taurine wooing of Europa. He swept it
aside from the door which it masked. He opened the door, and
disclosed a narrow staircase. Then he turned and looked at
Struensee, who crouched as he watched him.</p>
<p>'Take him away, Colonel,' he commanded.</p>
<p>By that secret staircase Rantzau ascended to the Queen's
apartments. Her voice, shrill with anger, met him as he
approached.</p>
<p>The uncouth Eichstedt was performing his task without
delicacy.</p>
<p>Aroused by her women, wrapped in a blue velvet cloak, her hair
in disorder, her countenance inflamed, Matilda had swept into the
antechamber to bombard the General with furious demands of an
explanation. When he had curtly supplied it, derision became blent
with her fury. She overwhelmed him with threats of physical
violence which she looked robust enough to execute. Then
peremptorily she clamoured for Struensee, ordered one of her women
to bring him to her.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Rantzau entered. 'Doctor Struensee,
madame,' he coldly informed her, 'has been arrested upon a warrant
from the King.'</p>
<p>Her fury was checked less perhaps by that calm, commanding
presence than by the fact that seeing him enter from her bedroom
informed her of the way by which he had come. Then in redoubled
fierceness she sobbed and panted. 'You have dared!' she cried. 'My
God! This will cost you your head.' She swung to Eichstedt again.
'Stand away from that door. Let me pass. I am going to the
King.'</p>
<p>It was Rantzau who answered her. 'The King, madame, has retired.
He is not to be disturbed. His wishes are expressed in the warrant
General Eichstedt is here to execute. But I beg, madame, that you
will not be alarmed. This arrest is a measure for your safety.
Doctor Struensee has brought upon you some of the resentment which
he has deserved at the hands of the people. There may be
disturbances when his arrest becomes known.'</p>
<p>'Disturbances! My God, sir, I promise you that.'</p>
<p>'We desire,' he continued quietly, 'to place you in safety until
peace shall have been restored.'</p>
<p>She would listen to no more. She raged at him. She hurled at him
a costly piece of Sévres that missed his head and went to crash
against the brocaded wall. Dishevelled she flung this way and that,
a volcano of threats.</p>
<p>'Madame, I beg that you will calm yourself, and accept a
situation contrived for your own good. I pledge you my word,
madame, that your confinement shall be of the briefest.'</p>
<p>'And I pledge you mine that you shall hang for this, you
scoundrel.' He bowed low, crossed the room, and passed out, leaving
her to General Eichstedt.</p>
<p>The General was less ceremonious. 'I have a carriage waiting,
madame, to take you to Kronenburg. Will you have your women dress
you, or shall I order in my men to do it? I don't doubt they'ld
relish the job.'</p>
<p>'Kronenburg!' she echoed, chilled by the name of that grim
fortress. And then, commanding herself at last, she asked the
pertinent question: 'Upon what grounds do you pretend to arrest
me?'</p>
<p>Eichstedt, firmly planted on his thick, booted legs, looked her
squarely in the face. His puritanical soul had abominated all her
ways. 'High treason, madame,' he answered her. 'It should not
surprise you. It must have been within your knowledge that in a
Queen adultery is high treason.'</p>
<p>The splendid figure seemed to wilt before them, to shed,
quivering, all its stateliness. His brutal words had brought her at
last to perceive the legal reality behind what she had been
regarding as merely high-handed violence. She grew afraid, and in
fear there was an end of her resistance.</p>
<p>Had she remained in Copenhagen she must have come to see for
herself that Rantzau uttered no more than the truth when he spoke
of this arrest as a measure necessary for her safety. When the news
of that night's happenings was out, and the awe of Struensee
effaced by it, the people made mutinous holiday, parading the
streets in their thousands, voicing aloud the ribaldries concerning
Struensee and Matilda which hitherto they had barely dared to
whisper among themselves.</p>
<p>The demonstration was at its height when Juliana drove through
the crowded streets, to show herself to the mob, with her stodgy
son, Prince Frederick, seated beside her.</p>
<p>Rantzau's first news of this piece of opportunism on the part of
the Queen-Dowager was the sound of the acclamations greeting these
usurpers of a place that in such an hour belonged to the King and
his little son, the Crown Prince. He was not only indignant. He was
profoundly uneasy. He felt that faith was being broken with him.
And not even when, in the days that followed, he found himself, as
had been promised him, presiding over the council that now held the
reins of government, was his mind entirely at peace.</p>
<p>This council's first concern was with the indictment of
Struensee. After the too ambitious physician's execution, in the
following April, Rantzau gave thought to the word he had pledged to
the unfortunate Matilda who still languished at Kronenburg. Popular
feeling had by now died down, and her further detention was
unnecessary. To insist upon her release, he came one morning to the
Council Chamber in the Christianborg Palace. He found the Council
already assembled when he arrived. But not until he had made his
request was he informed by the Queen-Dowager that the existing
Council proposed to set up a regency to govern during the minority
of the Crown Prince. The fate of Queen Matilda, she added, would
become the concern of the Regent.</p>
<p>Rantzau was aghast. 'The Regent,' he echoed. 'But we have a King
in Denmark.'</p>
<p>'We had a King in Denmark,' she answered him, with a quiet
smile, 'when you proposed a regency to Queen Matilda. What you
accounted lawful then, you cannot account unlawful now.'</p>
<p>He was momentarily at a loss. There was this morning an
unctuousness about that fair, plump German woman that awakened all
his old mistrust of her.</p>
<p>'That,' he said, 'was so as to wrest the power from the hands of
the usurper.'</p>
<p>Eichstedt answered him: 'Another usurper might arise. We must
guard against a repetition of that.'</p>
<p>Rantzau began to suspect that it was himself they had in mind.
He had the sense of being attacked; hard-pressed.</p>
<p>'And His Majesty,' Grunberg was adding, 'is known to be unfit
for the responsibilities of government.'</p>
<p>'But it is for us, his Council of State, to guide him,' Rantzau
countered.</p>
<p>The falsely demure Juliana sighed. 'That, my lord, can never be
anything but a pretence. No Council can guide His Majesty. It can
merely legislate in his name. No, no'&mdash;she firmly shook her
head. 'A regent has become necessary, and the people in the streets
of Copenhagen today have as good as elected him by their
acclamations. It is fortunate that by birth he should be the proper
person to fill the office and govern in the place of his
unfortunate brother.'</p>
<p>An approving murmur ran the length of the board. But not on that
account did Rantzau mince his terms.</p>
<p>'I see. We substitute for a King who is unfit to govern, a boy
who is equally unfit. Prince Frederick to be regent for King
Christian, and Your Majesty to be the regent of Prince Frederick. I
see. And you expect my concurrence?'</p>
<p>'We hope for it, Count.' Her eyes were malicious. 'We hope for
it, for your own sake.'</p>
<p>He pushed back his chair, and rose. 'The hope, madame, is an
insult. When I risked my life to break the shameful bondage of the
King, it was not to replace one usurpation by another.'</p>
<p>There was an explosion of anger about the table. Colonel Banner
and von Holckt came to their feet to give more pointed effect to
their indignation. By a gesture, Juliana restrained them.</p>
<p>'After that, Count von Rantzau, there is no more to be said; and
no place for you here.'</p>
<p>Thus dismissed, he stood looking at them for a long moment in
silence, and in that moment, although he remained erect and
unshaken, the signs of age seemed to sharpen in his long pale face.
Then he bowed to them, without another word, and departed as he was
bidden.</p>
<p>At their invitation he had used all his credit and influence to
organise and execute, confronting all its dangers, the <i>coup
d'état</i> which had overthrown Struensee, merely so as to render
possible this further <i>coup d'état</i> which gave the royal power
to Juliana. He should have remembered, he told himself, the
character traditionally borne by stepmothers. He should have known
that no real goodwill to Christian actuated her. But he would not
yet own defeat. What had been done by his credit and influence, his
credit and influence might yet undo.</p>
<p>Juliana, however, was as fully aware of this as he was, and
Juliana had not yet played her last card. That followed next day,
after the Regency had been proclaimed; and it was the elegant Count
von Holckt who was sent to play it on the Queen-Dowager's behalf.
As the emissary of the Regency, he bore to Count von Rantzau an
order of perpetual banishment, to be instantly obeyed.</p>
<p>Seated at his library table, Rantzau read the order bearing the
signature of the puppet-regent whose authority he had made
possible. He was given six hours in which to quit Copenhagen, a
week in which to depart from Denmark.</p>
<p>His glance, laden with an infinite weariness, was levelled upon
von Holckt.</p>
<p>'I suppose none doubts that I shall obey?' he said.</p>
<p>'I could not wrong your perspicacity by such a doubt. You will
realise that the alternative would be a prison. This because at
large you could be very dangerous. Risings against established
authority do not happen spontaneously, whatever the feeling, as we
have seen in the case of Struensee. They need to be organised; and
Her Majesty the Queen-Dowager accounts it prudent that so skilful
an organiser as your lordship should not remain amongst us.'</p>
<p>Rantzau's sombre eyes continued steadily to regard him. 'Do you
know, sir, that I find the message less surprising than the
messenger?'</p>
<p>'Is it possible that you bear malice, Count? Surely you see that
I do no more than discharge a debt. Your employment by me to pull
down Struensee makes us quits for your employment of Struensee to
supplant me. I bear you this message, merely so that I may seize
the opportunity of taking my leave of you now that the end is
reached.'</p>
<p>'The end!' Rantzau received a sudden illumination. 'But where
was the beginning? Shall we place it in the time when, chosen by
Queen Juliana for your mastery of vice and profligacy to be
Christian's minion, you first initiated him into the excesses which
have consumed the little wit he had, and accomplished his ruin?</p>
<p>'Then, as now, you were the vile agent of that German woman.
That was the beginning to which this supplies the end, as you say.
And there was more. It was in the design that Queen Matilda should
be ruined, too. The excesses, the drunkenness, the lechery in which
you so ably engaged Christian were so to disgust her that she would
be ready to fall into the arms of the first adventurer bold enough
to become her lover. It has all happened as you plotted. Both the
King and the Queen have been removed from the path of Madame
Juliana. The word I pledged to Queen Matilda is dishonoured. And
you, who in all this have been the agent of that German woman, come
here to leer in pride. That is because you, who have the soul of a
lackey, are too contemptible to know how contemptible you are.'</p>
<p>Livid under the insult, tortured by that unmasking, despite his
shamelessness, von Holckt's suavity left him. But he had no answer.
He could only snarl as he departed:</p>
<p>'An escort of Falkenschjold's dragoons will be here at six this
evening, to conduct you to Holstein. A pleasant journey, Count von
Rantzau.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>MADAM RESOURCEFUL</h2>
<p>A shadow detached itself from the deeper shadows about the
little doorway to a back staircase that led to the apartments of
the Grand Duchess at Oranienbaum, and vanished among the pines that
rendered fragrant the tepid summer night. Above the silken rustle
of the sea came a sound of swift feet and then a raucous voice.</p>
<p>'Who goes there?'</p>
<p>'The Grand Duke's tailor.'</p>
<p>Six tall Holsteiners closed about the shadow. It was wrapped in
a long Venetian cloak and covered by a wide hat. When presently in
the light of the hall cloak and hat were unceremoniously pulled
away there emerged from this black chrysalis a young gentleman in
blue satin and silver, whose golden hair was elegantly clubbed.</p>
<p>The German sergeant was sardonic. 'Righteous Lord God! You look
like a tailor.' Then they dragged him off to General Brockdorff's
quarters, and the sergeant, stiff upon his gaitered legs, made his
report.</p>
<p>The General listened, startled eyes upon the handsome figure. At
the end he peremptorily waved a hand. 'That will do. You can
go.'</p>
<p>He thrust back his chair, and rose as the door closed upon the
soldiers. 'Monsieur Poniatowski, what does it mean? What are you
doing here?'</p>
<p>Save that he was breathing a little faster than usual, the young
gentleman showed no distress. As a member of the <i>corps
diplomatique</i> (he had come to St. Petersburg in the train of the
British ambassador, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams) he was protected
by privilege. Nevertheless, when after a moment he answered, his
air of mild defiance was enough to betray his uneasiness.</p>
<p>'I was taking the air.'</p>
<p>'At Oranienbaum! At two o'clock in the morning? Twenty versts
from St. Petersburg? You came a long way to take the air, sir.'</p>
<p>'Account it an eccentricity.'</p>
<p>'It's not for me to account it anything, but for you to explain
it. And to the Grand Duke, if you please. Come along, sir.'</p>
<p>With despair in his heart, but composure on his features, he
suffered himself to be conducted to a vast room, amid the gloom of
which there was a gay island of light. Here, at a table sparkling
with silver and glass and bright with the colours of fruit and
flowers, sat a man and a woman. There were no servants present.</p>
<p>At the opening of the door, the man turned his head in peevish
wrath.</p>
<p>'In the name of hell...' He broke off. Brockdorff! What the
devil do you want? And who's this bantam?'</p>
<p>He got up, so untidily and unsteadily that his chair crashed
over. He was short and slight, and below powdered hair displayed a
face, flushed now with wine and annoyance. It was an ill-natured
face, of an insignificant natural ugliness aggravated by the scars
of smallpox. Of little chin and less brow, it formed in profile a
rectangle with its apex at the nose. A star of diamonds gleamed on
the breast of his yellow coat. His gold-embroidered waistcoat was
unbuttoned. Prominent red-rimmed eyes glared malice at the
intruders.</p>
<p>Brockdorff explained, and drew his companion forward so that the
light more completely revealed him.</p>
<p>'Oh, to be sure. I recognise him now.' The Grand Duke's speech
was slurred. He hiccoughed loudly. 'And what may you be doing here,
Monsieur Poniatowski?'</p>
<p>Poniatowski answered him as he had answered the General. 'I was
taking the air, highness.'</p>
<p>The woman, who had remained seated, facing them, her elbows on
the table, laughed. A short lumpy girl, whose flat, coarse face,
like the Grand Duke's, was pockmarked, she was the niece of the
Vice-Chancellor Vorontsoff; but despite her birth and the splendour
of her gown and jewels, she had the air of a dressed-up
peasant.</p>
<p>'You hear?' growled his highness. 'The freiline laughs at you;
but I don't laugh, I. By God, you are insolent to answer me so.
Taking the air, you fool! Pish! I know more than you suppose, my
cockerel. Very little happens that I don't know. Very little. Among
other things, you have the impudence to be too friendly with my
wife. But that's no matter. It's your other attachments that matter
to me; the other interests you serve. Ah! That startles you,
jackanapes. You think I see nothing.' He strutted forward on his
spidery legs. 'Let me tell you that little escapes me. I know all
about you. You're a man of Austrian sympathies. An enemy of
Prussia. And who is the enemy of Prussia is my enemy. My enemy!' He
shrank back on the thought and the implications it brought into his
addled brain. 'Righteous God! How do I know that you have no
designs against me? Against me?' He moistened his lips. He screwed
up his mean eyes. 'Why are you prowling round Oranienbaum at two
o'clock in the morning? Eh? Were you lying in wait for me? Answer,
by God!'</p>
<p>Poniatowski actually showed relief. 'Highness, the thought is
monstrous.'</p>
<p>'Monstrous? Why do you grin? Damn you! You'll have pocket
pistols.'</p>
<p>'But what a suspicion, highness!'</p>
<p>'Search him, Brockdorff.'</p>
<p>Poniatowski drew himself up. The course the Grand Duke's
suspicions were taking gave him ease of mind and a full courage.
'Highness! That would be an outrage. I am an accredited
ambassador.'</p>
<p>'Accredited to cut my throat, maybe. Search him, I tell you.</p>
<p>Brockdorff was aghast. 'Highness!' he protested. 'Search him,
devil take you!'</p>
<p>Brockdorff looked almost imploringly at the young man. 'Your
excellency permits?'</p>
<p>Poniatowski laughed and submitted. He was without weapons. 'You
see, highness. And your other suspicions are just as unwarranted. I
am associated with the English ambassador, Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams, and England has made alliance with Prussia. How can I be
supposed attached to Austrian interests?'</p>
<p>His highness was pulling foolishly at his nether lip. The woman
spoke.</p>
<p>'Peterkin, you're a blunderer. Here.' She beckoned him
ungracefully, and obediently he went, for the empire over him of
this his latest mistress was already firmly established. She took
him playfully by the ear and drew it down to the level of her lips.
She whispered into it at length. Knowing her malice, Poniatowski
watched in dread. Knowing the Grand Duke's malice, the fellow's
grin as he broke away from her increased his fears.</p>
<p>Arms akimbo, with feet planted wide, the Grand Duke stood again
before him and leered into his face.</p>
<p>'Aren't you a great fool not to take me into your confidence?
Thousand devils, man! Did you think I'ld play the jealous husband?
Do you think that is why I set a guard? Numskull, those precautions
are for the security of my own person.'</p>
<p>Miraculously Poniatowski kept his wits. He played on the fool's
notorious vanity. 'Whatever their object, highness, the
dispositions bear witness to high military talent.'</p>
<p>'Aha!' The Grand Duke purred under the gross flattery. He threw
a chest. 'I am a soldier, my friend, not a trifler.' Smiling, he
took Poniatowski by the arm. 'He stays with us, Brockdorff.
Be\off.' He drew the young man forward to the table. The
Vorontsoff's coarse vivid lips were smiling broadly. 'Now that we
understand each other, now that we're good friends, you shall stay
to supper. We'll make a party. Wait.'</p>
<p>He rolled out of the room with a cackle of imbecile laughter.
With another cackle he came to the bedside of the Grand Duchess.
She was peacefully slumbering, her cheek upon her softly rounded
arm. He pulled the arm away. She opened her eyes, and as
consciousness grew in them so grew dread.</p>
<p>'Get up,' he ordered. 'You're wanted. Get up.'</p>
<p>It was not the first time she had been aroused to witness some
buffoonery, to be cursed in obscene barrack-room terms, to be
cuffed, even, if she displayed reluctance. Mistrustful of this
joviality, she rose at once, a woman of middle height, still
beautifully shaped, although by now, in this her twenty-eighth
year, inclining to plumpness. Her skin was of a dazzling whiteness,
and her face with its aquiline nose and lofty brow, from which the
luxuriant chestnut hair was now drawn back, was irresistibly
attractive. Intelligence and power dwelt in her fine dark eyes.</p>
<p>She had drawn a Batavian bedgown over her shoulders, and was
seeking her stockings when Peter lost patience.</p>
<p>'Come, come. What the devil! Leave the rest. We're friends
together. You'll do very well.' He caught her wrist in his rough
red paw, and dragged her forth.</p>
<p>She suffered the indignity so that she might be spared worse;
but not in any fear. That emotion was no longer hers. But it was
aroused again when in that island of light about the gleaming table
she beheld her lover standing straight and tense.</p>
<p>The Grand Duke slyly watched her stupefaction, then exploded
into malicious laughter.</p>
<p>'To table, madame. To table. Here we are all friends.'</p>
<p>Only then, as she came forward like a somnambulist, did she
become aware of the presence of the Vorontsoff, who, for all her
insolence, would have risen, but that the Grand Duke waved her
down.</p>
<p>'No ceremonies. No pestilent etiquette. All friends
together.'</p>
<p>Then Catherine thought she understood. A cynical bargain was
being forced upon her. She was to bend her proud neck and sit at
table with the Vorontsoff, whom hitherto she had refused to
tolerate, in exchange for a complacency that made Poniatowski safe.
For her dear lover's sake she must accept; and so for an hour and
more, like an automaton, she played her part in that queer
supper-party, her face a smooth mask upon her inward rage.</p>
<p>Poniatowski, too, was smoothly master of himself. He accepted
the situation at its face value, ascribing its queerness to the
drunken eccentricity of his host.</p>
<p>At last, as the daylight was beginning to filter through the
curtains, the Grand Duke rose, drawing the Vorontsoff with him.
Blear-eyed he contemplated the Grand Duchess and the young
Pole.</p>
<p>'Well, well, my children, it's clear you have no need of us. Nor
we of you.'</p>
<p>He reeled out, giggling, on the arm of his mistress. The door
slammed so that the windows rattled. Then there was silence.
Catherine and Poniatowski were alone. They looked at each other in
the light of the guttering candles. A smile broke on the fair,
handsome face of the young Pole. He leaned towards her, a hand
extended.</p>
<p>'What the gods send&mdash;'</p>
<p>But there he checked. For she shrank quickly from the intended
caress, her dark eyes dilating with a fear that she no longer
troubled to dissemble. She lifted a finger in warning, her ears
straining to listen. She knew the malice of Peter, and suspected
here a trap. After a moment's silence she quietly rose, and swept
barefooted to the door. Perhaps it was no more than her alarmed
fancy that created a patter of retreating footsteps beyond it. She
flung it wide, and called. She had to call again before a sleepy
lackey shambled forward. She asked for General Brockdorff, and
remained in the open doorway until he came, no word passing between
herself and Poniatowski.</p>
<p>'His highness has retired,' she informed the general with the
gracious dignity she used. 'I beg that you will see our guest upon
his way.'</p>
<p>Thus tamely ended the last of Poniatowski's secret visits to
Oranienbaum during the remainder of her highness's sojourn there
that summer. But not on that account was it the end of his
clandestine relations with her, relations which were not only those
of a lover, but also of a political associate. Indeed, it was on
state matters that Poniatowski had first sought her highness, and
it was in the course of those meetings that the intimacy had sprung
up between them.</p>
<p>She was, when he came into her life, a woman who had suffered
bitterly, whose nature had been moulded and hardened by this
suffering as steel is tempered in fire. She was no longer the
gentle, awed little German princess of the insignificant house of
Zerbst-Anhalt, whom the Empress Elizabeth had summoned to Russia so
that she might become the bride of her nephew and heir, that other
German, of the House of Holstein. She owed her destiny to the
sentimentality of the Empress, who had been robbed by death of a
betrothed she never ceased to lament in the person of the brother
of Catherine's mother.</p>
<p>Coming from a house that had no place in history, the daughter
of a father who had to work as a soldier for his living, the great
prospect opened out to her was dazzling until she made the
acquaintance of the crapulous degenerate she was to marry. Yet it
was only after marriage that she fully discovered his
loathsomeness. Coarse in manners as in appearance, addicted to low
company, rarely sober, obscene in speech and habits, he inspired
her with horror.</p>
<p>Vicious by nature, he ill-treated her for the sheer pleasure of
inflicting pain. He hated her for an intelligence which made him
recognise her superiority; yet in doubt or difficulty he would fly
to her whimpering for advice. Her shrewd wit had led him to
nickname her <i>Madame la Ressource</i>&mdash;Madam
Resourceful.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Catherine had been educating herself. She read deeply
and widely; she worked hard to learn Russian; and she learnt other
things that went to enrich her mind and increase her
self-confidence.</p>
<p>Her fresh young beauty and her ready wit made life possible by
creating for her a court within the court; and in a society whose
morals were the most lax in Europe there was no lack of
enterprising young gallants, like Soltykoff and Narychkine, to
pursue her with their ardours. Had she been weak, it still remained
that she was too closely spied upon and guarded to have yielded to
her weakness.</p>
<p>The Empress was kind to her, but rendered impatient by
Catherine's failure to perform her obvious duty and produce an heir
to the throne of Russia. At last, however, in the autumn of 1754,
nine years after her marriage, it did come to pass that the Grand
Duchess was delivered of a son, and all was well.</p>
<p>Thereafter she resumed with an increased assurance her place at
Court. And there were greater things in store. A slight stroke of
apoplexy suffered by the Empress reminded the all-powerful
Chancellor, Bestucheff, that since his mistress was not immortal he
must be looking to his future. The vicious imbecilities of the
Grand Duke made it impossible to contemplate him as a master.
Bestucheff entered into secret relations with the Grand Duchess. He
would contrive that before the Empress died Her Majesty should set
her signature to a deed bestowing the throne jointly upon Peter and
Catherine. The deed should be slipped among other documents for
signature at a time of vagueness in the imperial mind.</p>
<p>Things had been in this pass when Stanislas Poniatowski made his
first appearance at St. Petersburg with Sir Charles Williams. He
was twenty-two at the time, a nephew of the Czartoryskis, the most
powerful house in Poland. He was handsome, travelled, accomplished,
enriched in nature by the Italian and the Jewish blood in his
veins. The fine correctness of his conduct lent him a particular
distinction in a court where so much coarseness was discernible
once the eyes ceased to be dazzled by the superficial glitter.</p>
<p>Williams entrusted Poniatowski with the task of winning the
Grand Duchess to their policy. England had now joined hands with
Prussia and it was desired to bring Russia into the alliance.</p>
<p>Thus began the relations between the wife of the apelike heir to
the throne and the handsome young Pole who captivated her by
elegancies of mind, expressed in the language of Voltaire, that
matched the elegance of his person. Understanding ripened between
them imperceptibly. Opportunities for protracted meetings were
created. For as a result of her understanding with Bestucheff she
was delivered from the vigilance that had hampered her movements in
the past.</p>
<p>As their intimacy grew she contrived secret excursions with
Poniatowski on the water or through the woods on horseback, when
she rode in male attire. All that she had suffered here in Russia
seemed but a little price to pay for the happiness of those days.
To all she appeared radiant, gay, and sparkling as never before. If
the Court guessed the cause, yet there was no flagrant scandal
until the tale came to be told of that night scene at Oranienbaum.
After that the lovers were doomed to starve in the greater
circumspection into which, for love's sake, they had been scared.
She vowed, nevertheless, that in her this love should perish only
with life itself.</p>
<p>She vowed it at a time when he was passionately urging her to
fly with him from a misery that had endured too long already. But
to a woman in her station the step was unthinkable, and the
consequences might fall terribly upon him.</p>
<p>These he pronounced himself ready to defy.</p>
<p>'I'll gladly take the chances which your fears exaggerate, my
Catherine. Come with me to France. There we shall be safe. Put an
end to the indignities you have been suffering for years from this
evil, drunken toad. Will you drive me mad with the thought of your
bearing these infamies until you die?'</p>
<p>A curious smile took shape on her lips. 'That will not
happen.'</p>
<p>'Not happen? If he is what he is whilst awe of the Empress
restrains him, what will he become when he is Emperor and holds the
whip? And that will happen soon.'</p>
<p>'I have provided.' Something in her calm and in the
inscrutability of her smile almost made him tremble. 'It is a great
secret, Stanislas. I tell you of it so as to quiet your fears.' And
she told him of the secret understanding with Bestucheff. 'So you
see, my dear,' she ended wistfully, 'I must remain to pour the wine
that has been poured for me.'</p>
<p>That wine was becoming less bitter than it had been, as a result
now of the completeness of her estrangement from the Grand Duke.
Engrossed in the Vorontsoff, in whom he found a companion entirely
to his taste; a woman who spat and swore like a dragoon, and who
was even willing to get drunk with him, Peter pursued his
indifferent way. In the following spring, when the Grand Duchess
was delivered of a daughter of whom all the world believed
Poniatowski to be the father, the Grand Duke set the court rocking
with laughter at his seriocomic lament.</p>
<p>'I can't think where my wife finds all her pregnancies.' Then,
abruptly, jests and quips were silenced, attention deflected from
the lovers.</p>
<p>Bestucheff, the powerful Chancellor, was arrested on a charge of
having been bought by the King of Prussia. He was blamed for the
treacherous retreat of General Apraksine when Frederick the Great,
beaten to his knees at Gross Jaegersdorff, lay at Russia's
mercy.</p>
<p>The arrest sowed dismay throughout the Court, and terror in the
heart of Catherine. It was no trumped up charge, as she well knew,
for she had been an active party to the intrigue. So much had
Poniatowski accomplished. And there was that other intrigue,
touching the future joint sovereignty, by which Madam Resourceful
was safeguarding her future. Letters had passed between her and
Bestucheff. If any were now discovered that would be the end of
her. A grim mirage of Siberia loomed before her. Yet she kept her
courage, raddled her pale cheeks, carried her head high, and showed
herself to the Court serene as ever. Thus for some days. Then one
evening whilst she sat at faro, Poniatowski came to stand beside
her as if to watch the game. As he bowed low over the hand he bore
to his lips, she felt a folded paper pressed into her palm. It went
into her white bosom, and stayed there until she had retired for
the night.</p>
<p>It contained but two lines: 'Fear nothing, madame. I have burnt
everything.' It bore no unnecessary signature. It was from
Bestucheff. She breathed freely again. The old fox had espied the
hunt whilst it was still afar, and he had taken his measures.
Something did come to be found, it is true, among his papers; but
not enough seriously to compromise her.</p>
<p>If, however, the tragedy she had feared was averted, a tragedy
scarcely less black was to overwhelm her. Poniatowski had been able
to bring her that note because he was in communication with
Bestucheff. In this he continued until it came in the end to be
discovered: a foreign diplomat in relations with a man charged with
high treason. The offence was grave. Poniatowski had abused his
office.</p>
<p>He was given his passports and ordered to leave Russia
instantly. He was to take no farewells, to hold intercourse with
none, and he should be thankful that no worse befell him.</p>
<p>When Catherine heard of it, he had already gone. He exhibited
his desolation in a note which Sir Charles, taking pity on his
despair, consented to deliver to her.</p>
<p>Her spirit broke completely. Sir Charles witnessed the
beginnings of a paroxysm in which she called for death as the only
anodyne. Her soul was rent by anguish. It was the end of the world
for her. Nothing could ever again arouse her interest. What was
ambition, what was power, what was anything that existence could
offer, when love was ravished from it She likened now her life to a
corpse tricked out with glittering jewels. In her despairing
sorrow, in her widowhood, as she regarded it, she kept her
apartments, took to her bed, gave out that she was ill. The Court
had no illusions on the nature of her indisposition.</p>
<p>Only after some days did she begin to master her grief. She read
again and again the pathetic little note which protested an undying
love, the writing all besmeared by the tears that had fallen on it,
and gradually she began to lean upon the confidence it breathed
that some day they must be reunited, and so take comfort. Destiny
could never have the cruelty to ordain otherwise. And so she wrote
to him from the depths of her poor, broken heart that she would
wait for him to the grave and beyond it. Having procured a courier
and dispatched her letter, she found her courage greatly increased.
She would face life again, since she must live for that
reunion.</p>
<p>She came forth a rather wistful figure, with a haunting sadness
in those great dark eyes that seemed now bereft of their magnetic
power. But in the following spring they settled on a young officer
lately returned from the Prussian campaign, in which he had covered
himself with glory, and some of the wistfulness was observed to
fade from them, some of their magnetism to be recovered. The
officer's name was Gregory Orloff, and the tale of his deeds at
Zorndorf, where he had taken three wounds, made him now the hero of
the hour. For the rest, with the blond head of an angel on the body
of a Hercules, he was certainly a man to hold the eye. He was one
of five brothers, all of them officers in the Guards; all of them
tall, powerful fellows; all of them handsome, saving that the
beauty of Alexis had been marred by a scar; all of them worshipped
in their regiments for their physical perfections and their
prowess.</p>
<p>When he was presented to Catherine, she found him as dull as he
was handsome. Of poor intellect and no education, he was a man whom
nothing could ever startle, because to his simple unimaginative
nature nothing held any implications. He saw what he saw, but never
what it meant. He was reputed a hard drinker, a reckless gamester,
and of as boundless an audacity in affairs of gallantry as in all
else.</p>
<p>In all things he was the very opposite of the courtly, polished,
poetical Poniatowski; and it may have been this very contrast which
came to lend him interest in her eyes. He promised such very
different experiences. His influence with the Guards, too, was not
to be overlooked by an intelligent woman whose ambitions
Bestucheff's intriguing had vaguely aroused. Whatever the future
might hold for her, nothing would be lost by attaching this young
giant to her person. And as for the present might he not supply a
balm for her poor lacerated heart? Might he not fill the empty,
aching place, and help her to bear with fortitude her desolation?
And did she not owe fortitude to Poniatowski as well as to herself?
You conceive her arguing thus.</p>
<p>Audacious in gallantry though he might be, he would hardly have
ventured to plunge into the arms of the Grand Duchess if she had
not very clearly invited him to do so. The spiritual companionship
which she craved and which Orloff could not supply, she found at
about this time in the young Princess Dashkoff, that other niece of
the Vice-Chancellor Vorontsoff. She was far from suspecting that
these two&mdash;Gregory Orloff and the Dashkoff&mdash;were the
tools by which her destiny was to be shaped.</p>
<p>This destiny, however, did not begin to emerge until the
following year, when the Empress Elizabeth died. And its chief
architect, when all is said, was Peter himself. He lost no
time.</p>
<p>As he strutted behind the hearse, in his tight Prussian gaiters,
he disgusted the populace by his imbecile levities. After that he
offended the clergy by decreeing the secularisation of Church
property, and he scandalised all orthodox Russians by announcing
his intention of returning to the Lutheran religion. Lastly, this
worshipper of Frederick the Great enraged the Guards by putting
them into uniforms of Prussian design and subjecting them to an
iron Prussian discipline with its dreadful floggings.</p>
<p>Whilst he was making enemies and arousing contempt on every
hand, Catherine, never more prepossessing than now, in her
thirty-third year, was winning the respect of all by her gentle
dignity, her affability, and her displays of quick
intelligence.</p>
<p>From Peter her estrangement was now complete. They occupied
apartments at different ends of the palace, and neither crossed the
threshold of the other. This was fortunate, because she was again
about to become a mother, and only by agonies of tight lacing did
she succeed in dissembling the fact in public. So well did she
contrive that when she was delivered of a son, her intimate
Princess Dashkoff was as far from suspecting it as she was from
suspecting the extent of Catherine's relations with Orloff. And yet
between these two&mdash;the eager, vivacious little princess and
the handsome, stolid guardsman&mdash;there was a sort of
collaboration. They were engaged in tempting the young Empress to
make herself mistress of the situation. The little Dashkoff's
notion was a revolution that should dethrone Peter in favour of the
Tsarevitch Paul, now eight years old, with his mother Catherine as
regent. This project the astute Panine, the new Chancellor, was
prepared to support. Orloff, more simple and direct, took no
account of the Tsarevitch.</p>
<p>Catherine listened to them, dreamed, and postponed. It might
come to be necessary to do something. But not yet. They, however,
were already at work: the Princess in court circles, Orloff and his
brothers with the already disaffected Guards.</p>
<p>But Catherine herself hung back, in spite of abundant
provocation from the Emperor, in spite even of rumours of sinister
intentions concerning herself. Thus until she was sharply spurred
by an intolerable public insult.</p>
<p>It happened in June of 1762, at a splendid banquet spread in
Peter's new palace to celebrate the treaty of peace with
Prussia.</p>
<p>At the head of the great table, the Emperor gave the toast of
the Imperial Family. When the brave company of four hundred guests
rose to honour it, Catherine alone remained seated. Peter's
ape-like face empurpled. His eyes bulged at her. As the company
rustled down again, she found the aide-de-camp Godovitch at her
elbow. The Emperor desired to be informed why Her Imperial Majesty
had not risen.</p>
<p>There was a hush, a sense of evil in the air. Catherine
commanded herself. She was calm and smiling.</p>
<p>'The Imperial Family being composed only of the Emperor, myself,
and our son, I did not account the homage necessary.'</p>
<p>Godovitch bore the message, and was sent back to tell the
Empress that she was an imbecile and should have known that the two
princes of the House of Holstein who were present, and were the
Emperor's uncles, formed part of the Imperial Family. Lest
Godovitch, lacking audacity to deliver the message precisely in
those terms, might suppress the word 'imbecile,' Peter leaned
forward, fixing her with his evil eyes, and hurled at her the
insulting word for all to hear.</p>
<p>'Doura!'</p>
<p>Hers in that moment was the only face that still smiled,
although tears stood in her eyes. She turned to Strogonoff at her
elbow.</p>
<p>'You are mute, sir. Tell me something to amuse me.'</p>
<p>But there was still more to follow. When the Emperor rose from
table, mouthing and grimacing in rage, he was heard to order Prince
Bariatinsky to place the Empress under arrest. Only the firm
intervention of Prince George of Holstein averted so scandalous a
conclusion to the feast.</p>
<p>Back in her own apartments, with Skourine, her faithful,
confidential servant, on guard, she sat deeply pensive, whilst the
plump black-haired little Dashkoff, quivering with anger,
stimulated her to action.</p>
<p>'Will you strike whilst you are free? That may not be long.
Tonight you have had a very near escape. Elizabeth Vorontsoff will
see that you don't escape again. She has her heel on the Emperor's
neck. It is she who commands. And she is determined to be
Empress.'</p>
<p>Catherine sat up sharply. 'What do you mean? Do you seek to
drive me by fear? Or have you gone mad?'</p>
<p>'She is to be Empress.' The Princess repeated her words slowly.
'Empress. It is already common talk. The Emperor is to divorce you,
shut you up in a nunnery, marry the Vorontsoff, and send the
Tsarevitch to Kronstadt.'</p>
<p>Catherine was still rejecting belief in anything so monstrous,
when Skourine ushered in the two Orloffs, Gregory and Alexis. With
them came the elegant, frivolous, but devoted Narychkine.</p>
<p>Ahead of his companions, Gregory, resplendent in a guardsman's
uniform that was plastered with bullion, cherubic of head and
countenance, stood stolidly before her.</p>
<p>'Who is the father of the Tsarevitch?' he asked, with the same
abrupt indifference in which he might have asked: 'Who made that
gown?'</p>
<p>Whilst the Princess gasped in horror, Catherine merely laughed
at a question so incredible.</p>
<p>'I have thought that it might be the Emperor,' she said. Orloff
explained himself. 'If that is so, then His Imperial Majesty is a
liar as well as an idiot.'</p>
<p>Narychkine chortled. 'Whether he's a father or not, he's
certainly everything else that you say.'</p>
<p>Orloff went on without heeding him. 'I overheard him swear to
Prince George that before he packs you off to a cloister and sends
the Tsarevitch to rot in Koenigsberg, he'll have you paraded
through the streets with a placard on your breast&mdash;"Mother of
the Bastard."'</p>
<p>She laughed no longer. She was on her feet, pale and tense, her
every breath a sob. Her hands were clenched, her dark eyes blazed,
her nostrils were quivering. 'Is that his mind? And not only
myself, but my son is to feel his cruelty! So! I have been too
patient. We must cross the Rubicon.' She flung wide her arms in a
gesture of appeal. 'I am in your hands, my friends.'</p>
<p>The Princess uttered an ejaculation of relief. Narychkine prayed
God that it might not be too late already, and swore roundly that
Her Majesty should have made up her mind a month ago. But the
Orloffs had no misgivings, having no imagination. That was their
strength: a stupid courage that supplied their complete lack of all
the other qualities necessary to guide so dangerous an
enterprise.</p>
<p>'A week,' Gregory assured them, 'is all we need. The train is
laid.'</p>
<p>Fortunately, whilst Orloff had exaggerated nothing of the
Emperor's avowed intentions, His Majesty was not prompt to execute
them. There was another banquet on the morrow, followed by
fireworks, and yet another on the morrow of that. And on the next
day, the twenty-fourth June, Peter went off with the Vorontsoff to
his summer residence at Oranienbaum, ordering Catherine to
Peterhof, which was midway between Oranienbaum and St. Petersburg.
She obeyed him to the extent of going, but she left the
conspirators very active.</p>
<p>One great advantage at such a moment Gregory Orloff derived from
the fact that he was paymaster of the Guards. He plunged his hands
deeply into the regimental cash-box and scattered lavish bribes
among the men. Of the officers, in the main, he had made sure
already.</p>
<p>The conspirators were still at their preparations when the
betrayal that must inevitably wait upon their blundering lack of
caution came to take them by surprise. Any but the Orloffs would
have decamped at once, accounting themselves lost. Instead, they
resolved to strike the iron, although it was still cold. The burly
Alexis drove away in the dawn to Peterhof. He reached the palace at
five o'clock in the morning. Without ceremony, thrusting aside
attendants, he marched into Her Majesty's bedroom, and tore apart
the curtains of her massive, gilded bed.</p>
<p>'It's time to get up. We shall have to proclaim you at
once.'</p>
<p>That is all that he thought it necessary to say. He was even
less loquacious than his brother.</p>
<p>The Empress, thus rudely aroused, sat up startled, drawing the
lace of a flimsy night-rail over her lovely breast.</p>
<p>'Proclaimed? At once? But&mdash;'</p>
<p>He interrupted her. He remembered something. 'Pas-sek has
betrayed himself. He's been arrested. There is no time to lose. We
must go.' He displayed no more excitement than if he had been
summoning her to breakfast, and from this stolidity she may have
gathered courage.</p>
<p>She rose, dressed hurriedly, and then, in the carriage that had
brought Alexis, they set out at the gallop for St. Petersburg. With
them Her Majesty took her waiting-woman and her French hairdresser
Michel, who arrived just as they were leaving.</p>
<p>It is twenty miles from St. Petersburg to Peterhof, and the
horses, with which Alexis had covered the journey once already,
were at the point of foundering when, at three miles from the
capital, they were met by Gregory and Bariatinsky. The Empress and
her little following transferred themselves to Gregory's carriage,
and thus, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, having
set out at the bidding of a subaltern, driven by her lover and
escorted by her waiting-woman and her hairdresser, Catherine
entered St. Petersburg to take possession of the greatest empire in
the world.</p>
<p>They drove into the courtyard of the Ismailofski Barracks, and
at Gregory's order the drums were set at once to beat the assembly.
The guardsmen came tumbling out half-dressed and half-asleep, to be
ordered to shout, 'Long live the Empress!'</p>
<p>Bethinking them of the gold received and of a probable
distribution of vodka to come, they shouted lustily. A priest was
found and dragged forth in panic. He, too, did as Orloff bade him.
He raised a cross aloft and administered to the regiment an oath in
terms which proclaimed Catherine sole Empress and autocrat of all
the Russias. Smiling, fresh, rosy, sparkling of eye, she proved an
intoxication to the men. They pressed about her to kiss her hands,
her feet, her dress, and at last set out to bear her to the Church
of Our Lady of Kazan.</p>
<p>On the way they were joined by the Sieminofski Regiment, by the
Horse Guards, who had placed their Colonel, Prince George of
Holstein, under arrest, and at the last by the Fourth Regiment of
Guards, the Preobrajenski, which momentarily had hesitated.</p>
<p>To the ringing of bells and the cheering of the uncomprehending
but excited populace, Catherine entered the Church of Our Lady of
Kazan to receive the oaths of fidelity of her subjects. Thence,
amid ever-growing excitement, she passed to the Winter Palace,
which had been the scene of so many humiliations, but whither the
nobles, the Senate, the Synod, and even the new and masterful
Chancellor, Panine, hastened in that rash hour to do her
homage.</p>
<p>Thus in a fever of emotion the long summer day which had seen
the miracle of this bloodless, crazy, revolution sped to its close.
In the cool of eventide the ardours also cooled. It was remembered
that they had yet to hear from Peter. He had with him at
Oranienbaum his fifteen hundred Holsteiners. He had with him and
devoted to him the foremost Russian soldier of the day, Marshal
Munich; and in Pomerania he had an army which there were no
handsome Orloffs to corrupt.</p>
<p>The Emperor had gone that day to Peterhof. There, at three
o'clock, he received the shock of the news. He bestirred himself.
He commanded manifestoes to be edited. He ordered his Holsteiners
to join him. He remembered that he was a soldier, not a trifler. He
dressed himself in his Prussian uniform: big boots, spurs, sword,
and decorations. He would open the campaign by seizing Kronstadt,
across the water. In the dusk he went aboard a galley with his
courtly attendance, which included more than a dozen ladies, and
they set out, as if for a water-party. They were gay. Peter had
recovered his spirits by now. He strutted and swaggered in his
Prussian uniform. He was conscious that militarism was in his
blood, and he was intoxicated by this chance to play the soldier in
earnest; to handle soldiers who were living men, and display the
military talents perfected with tin soldiers and cardboard castles
which even in manhood had been his constant playthings.</p>
<p>The great fortress loomedgrim and vast in the moonlight. From
the ramparts a sentry challenged the approaching galleys.</p>
<p>'Who goes there?'</p>
<p>'The Emperor.'</p>
<p>But Catherine's emissaries had forestalled him.</p>
<p>'There is no longer an Emperor. Pass on.'</p>
<p>At Peter's elbow, by the companion-head, old Munich shook with
anger.</p>
<p>'Nevertheless, we land, sire,' he announced firmly.</p>
<p>'They will never dare to fire upon you. At the worst&mdash;'</p>
<p>But Peter was no longer at the Marshal's side. At the suggestion
that they might be fired upon, he had gone down the companion with
a terrific clatter of sword and spurs, to seek shelter in the
bowels of the galley. There his livid panic set the ladies
screaming.</p>
<p>The vessel was ordered about, and Munich spent most of the night
in urging the obvious upon his palsied master. Let him embark in a
ship of war, go to place himself at the head of his army in
Pomerania, and return to crush this mutiny. But the momentary
contact with the actualities of conflict had scattered Peter's
dreams of soldiering. He was not to be persuaded. In this, at
least, he displayed great firmness. He would go back to
Oranienbaum, and open negotiations.</p>
<p>He got there in time to learn that the four regiments of the
Guards were preparing to march upon him and his Holsteiners.</p>
<p>The Guards had no love for these Holsteiners. They set out
eagerly at daybreak to prove it. They had cast off the detested
Prussian livery lately imposed upon them, and had resumed the old
uniforms of Peter the Great.</p>
<p>At their head, riding astride, in a uniform borrowed from an
officer of the Sieminofski Regiment, went the Empress, a crown of
oak leaves entwined about her sable cap, her chestnut hair
streaming loose in the breeze, her face alight and eager. At her
side, similarly accoutred, rode the plump little Dashkoff.</p>
<p>Presently they were met by Prince Galitzine with a proposal from
Peter which amounted to a capitulation. He offered to share the
imperial power with Catherine. She pushed on without troubling to
answer.</p>
<p>They were reaching Peterhof when a second envoy met them. This
one bore the Emperor's abdication. There was, then, no need to go
farther. Catherine dismounted and entered the palace.</p>
<p>There, to Peterhof, later in the day Peter was brought to her.
The evil little wretch, who for years had terrorized her, insulted
her, and beaten her, and who had been proposing to make an infamous
show of her before dispatching her to a nunnery or to Siberia, came
now in a slobber of tears, pitiful, abject, to kiss her hands and
mumble intercessions that at least he might not be separated from
his mistress. He begged also for his pet monkey and his fiddle. And
the insolent Vorontsoff, responsible for so much, who had schemed
so remorselessly in her lust of empire, crawled on her knees to sue
for the mercy of being allowed to continue with her lover.</p>
<p>They were separated, for all their whimperings. Elizabeth
Vorontsoff was sent to Moscow, Peter to a house at Ropcha, pending
the preparation of quarters for him in the fortress of
Schlüsselburg. His pet monkey and his fiddle, however, were
conceded him.</p>
<p>The strain was over. The revolution so crazily undertaken was
incredibly accomplished. Catherine could repose at last.</p>
<p>The Princess Dashkoff, proudly excited by her share in these
glorious events, invaded the privacy of Her Imperial Majesty. In
the imperial antechamber she found Gregory Orloff stretched booted
upon a divan, as much at his ease as if he were in a taproom.
Scandalised, she pursed her full lips.</p>
<p>'Her Imperial Majesty?'</p>
<p>The blond giant grinned. 'In there.' With a careless jerk of the
thumb he indicated the open door of a farther room. 'Taking off her
breeches.'</p>
<p>The Dashkoff gasped. Then she saw what he was at, and gasped
again. At his elbow there was a table, and on this a pile of
letters whose appearance proclaimed their official nature.
Nonchalantly he was breaking the seals.</p>
<p>'What are you doing?' she cried in horror. 'Those are State
papers. No one may touch them but the Empress or those she
appoints.'</p>
<p>'Just so,' said the languid Orloff. 'She told me to run through
them.'</p>
<p>Thus the Princess reached understanding of what was presently to
be understood by all. If she was shocked, nevertheless she stayed
to supper with them.</p>
<p>One evening later in that fateful week, by when Catherine's
capable hands had taken a firm grasp of the reins of government,
Her Majesty was disturbed at her toilet by the entrance of Alexis
Orloff. He was as abrupt and unceremonious as on that morning when
he had torn her from her bed. He showed signs of wear. His
disordered clothes were covered with dust, his scarred face
glistened with sweat. He went down on one knee to make his
announcement.</p>
<p>'I am from Ropcha. It is finished, <i>matouchka</i>. He is
dead.'</p>
<p>Very slowly she set down the mirror she was holding, and turned
so that she might face him squarely. Her long, dark eyebrows were
raised on that lofty brow, her dark eyes were wide.</p>
<p>'Dead?' Her voice came almost in a whisper. 'Dead?' Then
abruptly, leaning over him, sharply she asked: 'How did he
die?'</p>
<p>'Of a colic,' said the terse Alexis.</p>
<p>Her eyes searched the impassive face. 'You are sure?'</p>
<p>'Sure. Of a colic.'</p>
<p>She sank to a stool before her mirror. Mechanically she took up
a silver comb. She issued an order to him. 'Not a word of this
tonight. Not a word. I' will make the announcement tomorrow.'</p>
<p>What tears she had to shed were shed officially next day in
public, after the Senate had proclaimed the event. On the night
that the news reached her, she appeared serene and radiant to the
Court, and the handsome Gregory Orloff towered beside her in a
possessiveness not to be mistaken.</p>
<p>In those days of her intoxication she even entertained a thought
of marrying her guardsman, and broached the matter to Panine.</p>
<p>The spare, dry Chancellor bowed with the utmost respect. 'The
Empress of Russia may do as she pleases. But Madame Orloff will
never be Empress of Russia.'</p>
<p>She was not distressed. She perceived that it was better so. To
take a husband was to surrender something of her vast power, to
concede to another a measure of dominion over her. As things stood,
this lover, as her subject, would belong to her, not she to him.
But at least she need not stint her favour to this young soldier
whom she had used to distract her from anguished thoughts of her
lost love, and who had played no inconsiderable part in the events
that had placed her where she stood.</p>
<p>'And I'll repay you, Gregory. My favour shall make you glorious.
Ask what you will of me.'</p>
<p>'Huh, <i>matouchka!</i>' said the laconic Gregory, and enfolded
her in his massive arms.</p>
<p>Her delicate body thrilled in that bear-hug. The tender, courtly
Poniatowski had been but a pale ghost of a lover compared with this
vigorous young giant. During those summer days she wore him openly
and proudly as her lover, and she was content.</p>
<p>Then, like a thunderbolt upon her serenity came a letter from
Poniatowski. The ardent fidelity of that romantic soul expressed
itself lyrically. \The man announced himself as about to set out
for St. Petersburg, so that now that all was changed, now that she
was no longer a wife, now that no obstacle stood between them, they
might reap together the reward of their constancy, and repay each
other for the starved years of separation.</p>
<p>In a panic she dispatched a courier to Warsaw with her answer
that began: 'I cannot tell you what obstacles there are to your
coming.' So much, at least, was true. She could not tell him.
Therefore she did not make the attempt.</p>
<p>His frenzy was merely increased. He wrote again, and yet again.
He would not be denied; he could not read between the lines of her
chilly letters. His fond persistence drove her to despair.</p>
<p>In the bitter dread aroused by this complication she turned to
the Dashkoff, who possessed so much of her confidence.</p>
<p>'The fool'&mdash;thus, in her exasperation, she alluded to the
erstwhile object of a worship she had sworn should be
eternal&mdash;the fool will not understand that he is inconvenient;
that he belongs to the past; that this romance is dead and
buried.'</p>
<p>'If you were to write and explain that to him&mdash;' the
Dashkoff was beginning.</p>
<p>'Explain it thundered Majesty, white and shaking. 'That would
merely bring him the more surely. This man presumes to think that
he has claims upon me. If he comes, as he threatens, I know how he
will behave. It will be ruinous. Ruinous!'</p>
<p>The Princess shook her head. 'Surely Your Majesty exaggerates
the danger. After all, you are Empress. There is no limit to your
power.'</p>
<p>'No limit?' Catherine was derisive. But even as she sneered, her
countenance lighted with sudden inspiration. There were, indeed, no
limits to the power she wielded, and not only in Russia. This vast
power reached beyond her frontiers, into Poland, where, too, her
will was law. And the throne of that elective kingdom just then
stood vacant.</p>
<p>'<i>Pardi!</i>' she cried out. 'I have it!' She laughed, and
clapped her hands together. 'I have it! I'll make him King of
Poland.'</p>
<p>The Dashkoff stared in a round-eyed amazement that grew to
horror. 'Poniatowski! King of Poland! But he is of no account; he
has no faintest claim. It is ludicrous, madame. The nobles will
never accept him.'</p>
<p>'Will they not?' Her smile was almost savage. 'They shall choose
between having him for their King and me for their enemy. I'll send
instructions today to my ambassador in Warsaw.' She sat down, and
laughed in her relief. 'So that is settled.'</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by that stupendous gift, which deflected his mind
from its inconvenient amorous longings, Stanislas Poniatowski
returned thanks from the depths of his amazed soul, conceiving this
to be an earnest of the great love she bore him. He never suspected
that Madam Resourceful tossed him a throne as a keepsake merely
because she could discern no other way of compelling him to remain
in Poland.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>THE VICTOR OF VENDÉMIARIE</h2>
<p>In one way and another she had lost, through the Revolution,
considerably over a million francs, and would of a certainty have
lost her life as well had not the events of Thermidor come sharp
and suddenly to ring down the curtain on the Terror.</p>
<p>Her offence lay not only in the vast wealth which she had known
how to amass in theatrical and other enterprises&mdash;and to be
inordinately wealthy, unless you happened to be a peculative member
of the government, was in itself an advertisement of civic
shortcomings&mdash;but further in the fact that her theatre in the
Palais Royal had brought her in the old days into relations with
despots, aristocrats, and such-like brigands that were far too
intimate for a patriotic-minded woman. The ci-devant ladies of the
<i>ci-devant</i> court of the now happily decapitated despots had
flocked to that theatre of hers, there to study the fashions in
which they would squander the nation's wealth whilst good patriots
went in want of bread. Grave as was the offence, could it be
conceived that it had ended there? Was it to be imagined that
Mademoiselle Montansier who set the fashion in clothes&mdash;worn
by the distinguished actress La Contat, and interpreted to the
Court by the Queen's dressmaker, La Bertin&mdash;did not also set
the fashion in many other even more infamous luxuries?</p>
<p>Thus the Argus-eyed Robespierrists.</p>
<p>It was in vain that now that the civil old régime had been
happily swept away, La Montansier had renamed her playhouse <i>Le
Théâtre de la Montagne</i>&mdash;the Theatre of the
Mountain&mdash;in honour of the party of the Mountain which
included all the truly progressive deputies, whose prophet was
Robespierre himself. That was but dust in the eyes of Argus. And
Argus has too many eyes to be easily reduced to total blindness,
even by so effective a dust as that of flattery.</p>
<p>So it was resolved that the Citoyenne Montansier should go the
way of those to whom she had set the fashion. She was to follow for
once the fashion they had set for her. And of a certainty she would
have sneezed into the sack but that the Mountain that doomed her
was itself doomed, and its end came about abruptly, before it had
time to encompass her own.</p>
<p>Barras, the handsome, sybaritic Provençal nobleman who had
thrown in his lot with the Revolutionaries and had become a man of
consequence in the Convention&mdash;though never of such
consequence as in those days of Thermidor&mdash;went in person to
deliver his old friend from the prison of the Conciergerie and
restore her to her considerable property in the Palais Royal, which
in addition to her theatre comprised a number of shops and dwelling
suites in the Arcade. Her gratitude was such as you would bestow
upon one whom you considered the preserver of your life,
particularly if you loved your life as the Citoyenne Montansier
loved hers, despite the seventy years it counted. To look at her
you would never have suspected her age to be above fifty, so
well-preserved and graceful still was her plump figure, and so
attractive her countenance&mdash;in which the resources of Thespian
art, no doubt, were enlisted to dissemble the ravages of nature.
With this apparent youthfulness of body, the alertness of her mind,
the vivacity of her manners, and the fresh tenderness of heart and
soul combined to make up a personality of unusual charm.</p>
<p>Casting about her for means to express her consuming gratitude
to the citizen-representative, and having discovered that he was
but indifferently lodged in a house in the Rue Neuve des Petits
Champs, she placed at his disposal one of the handsome suites of
rooms in her arcade in the Palais Royal, and thither Barras&mdash;a
man of ever-increasing importance in these days of Thermidorean
reaction&mdash;presently transferred himself.</p>
<p>Thither in quest of the august representative came one day early
in the following year&mdash;by when France had grown accustomed
again to breathing freely, the shadow of the red horror no longer
oppressing her&mdash;a slight brown-skinned, lantern-jawed wisp of
a young man in an extremely soiled and shabby uniform, whose
badges, however, proclaimed him a brigadier-general.</p>
<p>Barras received him with the suave affability that became your
true republican. Great sombre, glowing eyes considered the
representative out of that gaunt boyish face.</p>
<p>'It is not possible that you should remember me,' said he, his
voice harsh, almost fierce, with a contempt that seemed to take
himself and the citizen-representative and, indeed, all the world,
into its embrace. 'Two years ago&mdash;'</p>
<p>The suavely smiling citizen-representative interrupted him.</p>
<p>'On the contrary. I remember you perfectly. You are my little
artillery captain of Toulon. How can I serve you, General
Bonaparte?' And he offered the shabby soldier a chair. The soldier
ignored the offer.</p>
<p>'I have been in prison,' he answered with increasing fierceness,
and added: 'I am hungry.' It was as if he made Barras personally
responsible for these misfortunes. 'My family depends upon me, and
my family is without bread. I have ability; none knows better than
you that I have ability. That is why I come to you. I have ability;
yet I have no bread. That was a common enough state of things under
the despots. But a revolution makes equal chances for
all&mdash;otherwise what is the good of a revolution?'</p>
<p>The representative considered him through narrowing eyes,
drawing his breath sharply. 'You have ability...' he agreed slowly,
musingly. His mind had carried him back to the siege of Toulon two
years ago, when he had gone there as the people's representative to
superintend the operations.</p>
<p>He had asked one day for the services of an artillery subaltern
to carry out certain notions of his own with regard to the
emplacement of a battery. They had sent him this young Corsican,
shabby and out-at-elbows then as now, but alive with energy and
intelligence. So well had he carried out Barras' wishes and so
masterly was the report he presented that the
citizen-representative had made him a captain on the spot. Further
he had continued to keep an eye on him to such good purpose that
this young man of twenty-four stepping quickly to commander, and
colonel had gone back to the Army of Italy a few months later with
the rank of brigadier-general.</p>
<p>Barras, who knew his world, knew that if only you oblige a man
enough you persuade him that he may look to you for further
obligations. It did not therefore surprise him that this unemployed
young artilleryman should turn to him in his present extremity. But
there were certain things about him that Barras did not like. His
air of intractable fierceness, his harsh tone that was almost one
of reproach, should be softened.</p>
<p>'You have ability,' he repeated. 'I admit it; but you lack
discretion. You are still the terrorist, even now when the Terror
is out of fashion. That does not help people to forget your
ultra-revolutionary incendiarism, your fire-breathing pamphlets,
your "<i>Souper de Beaucaire</i>," your support of the younger
Robespierre. Instead of inveighing against the fact that you were
cast into prison, be thankful that you have escaped the guillotine.
It still operates, you know, for men who insist upon disturbing the
world with Robespierrist notions. I say this as your friend, my
general.'</p>
<p>My general's blue-grey eyes lost some of their glowing
fierceness, his manner became less intractable. At last he
remembered that Barras had offered him a chair, and he sat down,
placing a shabby hat across the knees of his soiled and shabby
breeches of leather that once had been white. He passed a hand
across his massive brow, brushing aside the wisps of his black
hair, that hung straight and lank.</p>
<p>'If it were for myself alone...' he muttered, and seemed to
apologise for his earlier manner. 'But there is my family. I want
work, citizen-representative. I have told you that I am
hungry.'</p>
<p>'You shall stay to breakfast,' said Barras. 'And we'll see what
can be done. I have some friends coming who may be able to help
us.'</p>
<p>Bonaparte stayed, and thereafter it became a habit of his to
drop in daily upon Barras to inquire whether the
citizen-representative had anything yet to offer him. Usually he
came at breakfast-time. Usually, too, he would accept the genial
Barras' invitation to return to dinner. Yet beyond these very
opportune meals, days grew into weeks and Bonaparte derived no
profit from his assiduous attendance at the Palais Royal. And this
notwithstanding that at Barras' hospitable table, he met many men
of influence in the Convention; for Barras kept open house in that
<i>garçonnière</i> of his, and seldom sat down to table without
company. But Bonaparte made no friends amongst them. They found him
taciturn and <i>gauche</i>. He presented an odd combination of
mistrustfulness, shyness, and ferocity that rendered him now
unpleasantly caustic, now almost as unpleasantly servile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the year dragged on into summer; to the threshold of
Vendémiaire, when first were heard the mutterings of the sections
in revolt against the Convention, and preparing a revolution of
their own.</p>
<p>By now Bonaparte's fund of patience, never very deep, was
exhausted and his importunities grew more insistent. Yet Barras
bore them with an equable indolent good-humour based upon his
liking for the Corsican.</p>
<p>'But what can I do, my friend?' he cried. 'I have done as you
wished. I have recommended and presented you to the Committee of
Public Safety. Unfortunately their knowledge of your antecedents
outweighs their regard for my recommendation. Nevertheless, Aubry
is willing to appoint you to a regiment of the line.'</p>
<p>The Corsican snorted fury and impatience. 'The line!' he
exclaimed in affronted horror. 'Oh, it is the end! There is nothing
to be done with these fools&mdash;nothing! I am going.'</p>
<p>'Where?' quoth Barras.</p>
<p>'Where people have sense; where they know a man. I shall offer
myself as an artilleryman at Constantinople. They'll make me
welcome there.'</p>
<p>'Come, come, my general,' the representative soothed him. 'You
have talent, ability, courage, and patriotism&mdash;'</p>
<p>'There is no employment in France for a man with those
qualities.'</p>
<p>'You are wrong. You are too impatient and violent. Sooner or
later you will find and take your proper place. Patience, then;
patience!'</p>
<p>'Patience!' He hurled the word back at Barras. Then, rendered
inarticulate by fury, he thrust his great black hat down upon his
brow and stalked out. But he came back to dinner that evening.</p>
<p>The notion of Constantinople, however, persisted. More calmly
some days later he told Barras that he was resolved; that life
offered him no alternative, since short of seizing that opportunity
he must submit to utter destitution. In changing the young
Corsican's mind on that subject, Barras was not to guess that he
was changing the very destinies of the world.</p>
<p>'You are wrong to say there is no alternative. There is,' said
Barras. 'There is marriage.'</p>
<p>Bonaparte stared at him. 'You think that starving in company is
more amusing than starving alone?'</p>
<p>'Not at all. I am speaking of a marriage of convenience, of the
kind that was regularly contracted under the old regime. Your
ruined gentleman, or your gentleman who having come into the world
without fortune had never had the chance of ruining himself, knew
how to make himself snug with the daughter of some wealthy
bourgeois&mdash;banker, merchant, or financier. Since you are so
impatient&mdash;'</p>
<p>'And where shall I find this accommodating nabob's daughter who
will relieve my neediness and set me on the road to fortune?' The
soldier was sneering.</p>
<p>'They exist&mdash;in plenty,' the representative assured him.
'Of course you must not be too exigent on the score of other
attributes so long as the endowment is satisfactory. Let me look
round for you. I may be able to help you better in this than in
other ways.'</p>
<p>Bonaparte shrugged contempt of the notion. Perhaps he attached
no importance to it, accounting it merely an idle subterfuge to
turn his mind from the spoor it so obstinately and importunately
followed. And then the door of the elegant salon was opened by
Barras' servant, and Mademoiselle Montansier stepped across the
threshold and into Bonaparte's life.</p>
<p>Her friendship with Barras was such that all ceremony was set
aside between them, and she was in the habit of walking in upon him
at all hours. She checked now in the doorway, perceiving that he
was not alone; and she would have withdrawn again but that he
sprang forward to welcome her and lead her forward. Thereafter he
presented to her his little artillery general, who thanks to the
representative's generosity was no longer quite the tatterdemalion
of a little while before. His blue coat was now tolerably fresh;
his white leather breeches were tolerably clean.</p>
<p>She was very elegant in a rich <i>déshabille</i> gown of rose
brocade; she came straight from the hands of her hairdresser,
elaborately coiffed and not without more than a suspicion of
powder, which left one in doubt as to the actual degree of greyness
of her hair. She curtsied in response to the Corsican's bow with
all the grace acquired by years of studied deportment across the
footlights, and the charm of her personality went forth to dispel
still further the impression that she was an old woman.</p>
<p>In her hand she carried a copy of the <i>Moniteur</i> fresh from
the press. The grave news contained in it was the reason of this
matutinal visit.</p>
<p>'My friend, have you seen?' she cried, her voice rich still and
musical. 'But it is terrifying. This revolt of the sections grows
and grows; thousands are rallying to them daily. We are threatened
with another revolution&mdash;another Terror.'</p>
<p>He soothed her. These gazettes lived by sensations. They
magnified all things that they might magnify their own sales. Let
her not give heed. The Convention, acting through General Menou, in
command of the Army of the Interior, would know how to stamp out
these last smouldering embers of insubordination.</p>
<p>She sighed, but half-convinced, as she took the chair that
Barras was proffering.</p>
<p>'You are men and soldiers,' said she. 'You naturally look
lightly on the peril. For you there is glory or death. But for
us&mdash;for a poor woman living alone, with no one to lean
upon&mdash;what is there? Pillage and all manner of evils. We are
the property of the conqueror always. Ah, citizens, I have endured;
I have seen; I know. It is sad to be a woman and alone.'</p>
<p>'Madame has no husband?' said Bonaparte, with such deep concern
of tone and glance that Barras perceived him to be touched by the
charm of this lovable septuagenarian.</p>
<p>'Of course not, since she is a spinster,' said the
representative.</p>
<p>'At least,' added the Corsican, 'mademoiselle cannot lack
friends who will defend her.'</p>
<p>'Ah, that is true. I am very fortunate in the friendship of
Monsieur Barras. I was in prison, and he delivered me. But for
him&mdash;but for his ridding us of that monster
Robespierre&mdash;I must have perished.'</p>
<p>The soldier bowed, his great solemn eyes considering her.
'Mademoiselle, who would not count himself honoured in defending
you? There are not wanting those who will gladly follow the Citizen
Barras' example.' His tone implied that he was to be counted
amongst them.</p>
<p>Flattered surprise and pleasure crossed her gentle face.</p>
<p>'Ah, but that is not to be refused, monsieur,' she cried. 'I
rejoice that Monsieur Barras' friends should be mine. I am
reassured by the knowledge that I may rely upon them.' And
playfully, with the familiarity to which her years entitled her
towards one who in age might have been her grandson, she tapped his
brown cheek caressingly with two fingers of her exquisite hand.</p>
<p>Association with the Court had given her courtliness; she
carried with her an air of that charmed world that was but a name
to Bonaparte; and so she was to him a phenomenon in human nature
before whose apparent superiority to his own kind he
bowed&mdash;terrorist that he had been and still was at
heart&mdash;without being conscious of the true reason of his
submission.</p>
<p>When on the morrow Barras, reverting to the matter of a marriage
of convenience, asked him what he thought of Mademoiselle
Montansier, the young Corsican was taken aback. Reflection,
however, absorbed the shock.</p>
<p>'Of course,' he said slowly, 'one would never really give her
the age she has; she is gay and amiable, and no doubt talented.' He
considered further. 'That she is good and obliging can be seen at a
glance...' He fell to musing, staring through the window, shoulders
hunched and brows furrowed in thought.</p>
<p>Barras spoke of her fortune, informing his protégé that despite
her losses she was still mistress of at least a million and a
quarter.</p>
<p>'To come to facts&mdash;frankly now&mdash;would you wish to
marry her?'</p>
<p>Bonaparte wheeled to face him. 'Would she marry me?' he asked,
on a note of doubt.</p>
<p>'That is to ascertain&mdash;after you have answered my
question.'</p>
<p>Back into his musings went the Corsican, muttering the
while:</p>
<p>'This requires thought, citizen.' He began to pace to and fro.
'There is nothing to be said against her personal
appearance&mdash;no. There is this disproportion in our ages. But
after all, it is like so many things one has no time to notice in
revolutionary times. And then her fortune&mdash;'</p>
<p>He broke off, and pondered silently, pacing ever. At last he
stopped before his patron, who reclined at his ease upon a
couch.</p>
<p>'Marriage,' he delivered himself with the air of having made a
profound discovery, 'is a very serious thing.'</p>
<p>'Maybe,' said Barras, 'but frankly I don't know much about it. I
married in a hurry, and left my wife in a still greater hurry two
days later, since when I haven't seen her. That was many years
ago.'</p>
<p>But Bonaparte either didn't hear or didn't heed him, engrossed
in his own problem, weighing those ideal things which youth has the
right to demand of marriage against the ponderously real things of
which marriage with this old lady would undoubtedly make him
master. At last he turned away again.</p>
<p>'It becomes easier for a man to go about his military duties
once he has properly settled his affairs,' he said presently, and
Barras took this for an expression of acquiescence.</p>
<p>He rose. 'Then leave this now to me. I will proceed in an
orderly way. I will first ascertain if Mademoiselle Montansier is
disposed to marry; and then, if she is disposed to marry you.'</p>
<p>Very humbly, very chastened this morning, Bonaparte thanked him,
and departed leaving Barras to act as he proposed.</p>
<p>The citizen-representative waited that day upon the lady, and
tactfully broached the subject of marriage to her.</p>
<p>'I should ask nothing better,' she answered him with the perfect
frankness that was one of her many charms. 'In these times a woman
sorely needs a protector&mdash;particularly a woman no longer
enjoying the activity of youth. And there, my
friend&mdash;alas!&mdash;is the difficulty. Time is woman's most
relentless enemy.'</p>
<p>'Then Time for once has succumbed in his contest with you. Look
now'&mdash;and he took her hand&mdash;'what you need is a
soldier.'</p>
<p>'Truly&mdash;a soldier, yes, a soldier.' And she pressed his
hand.</p>
<p>'Then, if you wish it, the matter is as good as settled.'</p>
<p>It took her breath away. 'I...I don't understand,' and there was
a shadow of alarm in her kindly old eyes. 'What do you mean? Whom
have you in mind?'</p>
<p>'The young soldier you met in my salon. Did you not observe how
greatly he noticed you, with what devotion he addressed you? That
devotion he now asks the chance to prove.'</p>
<p>She dropped his hand, and fell back a pace.</p>
<p>'But he is a boy,' she exclaimed. 'He can't be thirty.'</p>
<p>'True. But what, after all, have years to do with age? He
carries an old head on his shoulders. At Toulon he revealed his
quality; and given the opportunity, he will be sure to distinguish
himself. I answer for him.'</p>
<p>Beginning thus, Barras came at last to persude her to give
favourable consideration to his protégé. To explain his success in
this he says in his memoirs: 'Little eloquence is needed, when the
question of disproportion between the ages is set aside, to
interest in a young man the heart of a sensitive woman who has
already reached the maturity of old age. One's last love is no less
ardent and sincere than one's first one. We feel that it is all
that remains to us, and that we must cherish it. Were we to lose it
where should we find another?'</p>
<p>It may be as Barras says. But I prefer to think that he does
Mademoiselle Montansier something less than justice. I prefer to
think that touched by the spontaneous and immediate devotion
manifested for her by the young brigadier at their one meeting, and
touched also by the magnetism of his compelling personality, it was
to a maternal rather than to a lover's instinct that this lady
responded in consenting to consider him as a husband. He would
bring her the companionship, the protection, perhaps even the
tenderness that she craved, as all human beings crave it&mdash;as
none crave it more ardently than the aged; and in return she would
give him tenderness and the power of her wealth to help him
upwards. He would be as a son to her; he would give her life a new
interest; in his youth she would renew her own that was now
departed. Since marriage was the only link by which a relationship
that she found so desirable could be permanently established and
legalized, she would consent to marriage.</p>
<p>It but remained to bring the couple together, and so Barras
asked them both to dinner. The tinge of mutual embarrassment that
marked this meeting, and the interest of a more searching kind with
which each now considered the other, were for the
citizen-representative sources of secret entertainment. To him this
meeting was amusing and nothing more. Like all easy-going
voluptuaries he had never plumbed the mysterious depths of the
human heart. Love to him was a shallow, unvarying, physical
phenomenon easily comprehended.</p>
<p>But he observed the etiquette. He placed Mademoiselle on his
right, and her suitor opposite, whence he could glower upon her out
of those fierce, hungry Corsican eyes. After dinner he discreetly
left them to improve their acquaintance.</p>
<p>How well they improved it we are to gather by what passed when
at length the little brigadier took his leave.</p>
<p>'I hope, mademoiselle, very soon to have the honour of making
you acquainted with my family. My mother, mademoiselle, will not
fail to appreciate a lady so distinguished as yourself.'</p>
<p>She answered him becomingly, visibly affected. Then taking
Barras into their confidence, as was surely his due: 'We may go to
live in Corsica,' she told him.</p>
<p>'A delightful climate,' said Barras.</p>
<p>And very healthy,' Bonaparte added. 'People live to a good old
age there.' It was not perhaps the most tactful of remarks. But he
swept on to other matters. 'It is a new country where, given a
little capital, fortunes can quickly be made and doubled.' From
which the citizen-representative gathered that his protégé was
considering abandoning the military career that had already all but
abandoned him, and devoting his undoubted talents to other
enterprises.</p>
<p>As a matchmaker Barras had every reason for self-satisfaction.
Further meetings followed between the betrothed&mdash;they were no
less by now. The good understanding between them, their esteem for
each other, steadily increased. Mademoiselle, rejuvenated, more
<i>soignée</i> than ever in those days of exaltation, spoke of
Bonaparte quite frankly as her future husband.</p>
<p>And now at last, quite unexpectedly, Barras was able to override
the Committee of Public Safety's prejudices against General
Bonaparte. They were in Vendémiaire, and the tide of revolt in the
sections&mdash;led on by some returned émigrés and other
counter-revolutionary fanatics&mdash;was rising so rapidly and
powerfully that it threatened to overwhelm the Convention and sweep
it utterly away. The Lepelletier Section took the lead and the
other sec-. tions were arming to follow, in all some forty thousand
strong, to which the Convention could oppose but some five thousand
bayonets. General Menou, commanding the Army of the Interior,
proved unequal to the task of disbanding these rebels, wherefore
the Convention deprived him of his command, and in its terror sent
for Barras, the man of Thermidor.</p>
<p>Barras hastened to the Tuileries, and there condescended to make
the attempt to save the imperilled nation. He knew, he told them,
the very man to replace the spineless Menou.</p>
<p>'His name! His name!' roared the assembly.</p>
<p>'Brigadier-General Bonaparte, lately of the Army of Italy, a man
of energy and resource who greatly distinguished himself at
Toulon,' says Barras.</p>
<p>Had Barras named the devil himself, the Convention in this
extremity would have accepted him. True, there are certain deputies
who seem to have heard this name before. Wasn't Bonaparte the
intriguing Robespierrist, deprived of his command and arrested soon
after Thermidor? Well, well, the moment isn't one for objections
upon matters that are over and done with. Let Bonaparte get them
out of this mess, and they on their side will let bygones be
bygones.</p>
<p>So on that twelfth Vendémiaire (fourth October, <i>style
esclave</i>) Barras departs to headquarters in the Carrousel, which
is already being put into a state to withstand a siege from the
insurgents, and sends for Bonaparte. It takes hours to find him. He
is not at his lodgings, nor at any of the cafés he usually
frequents. Barras is not to guess that his young friend is at the
headquarters of the Lepelletier Section, whither&mdash;impervious
to any sentiments but those of egoism and ambition&mdash;this
Corsican opportunist has gone to see upon what terms the insurgents
will acquire his services. The value he sets upon these services is
higher than that at which the sections rate them. Because of this
he fails to make a bargain. And so at nine o'clock that night he
presents himself at last to the exasperated and fretted Barras at
the Carrousel.</p>
<p>'Where have you been?' the representative explodes at sight of
him.</p>
<p>'Waiting for orders,' is the cool answer, and not to give the
representative time for more awkward questions, Bonaparte sweeps
truculently on: 'And, anyway, what have you to offer me?'</p>
<p>Above all time is of value, too precious to be frittered away in
recriminations or in questions upon matters that no longer signify.
So Barras tells him. Barras, nominally Commander-in-Chief of the
Interior, is empowered by the Convention to appoint Bonaparte his
aide-de-camp, his executive arm, as it were. Bonaparte understands
perfectly. He nods his acceptance, and gets to business. What
forces have they? He is told in detail.</p>
<p>'Well, well! We shall be one against ten. No matter.' He sits
down. 'They will attack,' he says, 'at four o'clock tomorrow
afternoon&mdash;'</p>
<p>'How the devil do you know that?' cries Barras.</p>
<p>The Corsican looks at him inscrutably. 'How? Ha! I have been
busy,' he explains, which is true enough, and he goes on: 'That
gives us time to make dispositions. What artillery have we?'</p>
<p>'None.'</p>
<p>'None?' He is on his feet, the expression of his face entirely
changed. Artillery is, above all, the thing he understands. He
knows how it can neutralise odds, and here the odds require very
urgently to be neutralised. Almost he wonders has he been rash in
breaking off negotiations with the Sections. Barras is
explaining.</p>
<p>'I have just seen Menou. He informs me that the guns are at the
camp at Sablons.'</p>
<p>'At Sablons!' It is an expression of amazement and vexation.
'<i>Dieu de Dieu!</i> How many?'</p>
<p>'Forty cannon.'</p>
<p>'Are they guarded, at least?'</p>
<p>'By fifteen men&mdash;so Menou reports.'</p>
<p>The little Corsican wheels about, snarling. Has he walked into a
rat-trap? His smouldering eyes fall upon a stalwart, handsome major
of chasseurs in the little group of attendant officers.</p>
<p>'You!' he calls him crisply. 'Take three hundred men and ride to
Sablons for these guns. Fetch them here as fast as you can gallop.
<i>Allons!</i> Ride for your life, man.'</p>
<p>What he really meant was: Ride for my life.' The major of
chasseurs, Murat by name&mdash;later to achieve fame as the <i>beau
sabreur</i>, and later still to rise to royal dignity&mdash;salutes
and departs briskly.</p>
<p>By six o'clock next morning&mdash;the thirteenth
Vendémiaire&mdash;he was back in the courtyard of the Tuileries
with the fortyy guns, and Bonaparte could get to work in
earnest.</p>
<p>The details of the attack and its particular topography are
matters of history. When the insurgent columns, forty thousand
strong, rolled threateningly down upon those five thousand
defenders of the Convention, Bonaparte sought his orders from
Barras, the Government's representative on the field.</p>
<p>'A discharge of grape in the air should suffice to frighten
them,' said Barras. They are but Pompey's dandies afraid of getting
their faces scratched.'</p>
<p>Bonaparte went back to his post in a ruined building of the Rue
du Bac. Along the Quai des Théatins rolled the insurgent flood,
firing desultorily now as they advanced. That was enough. Bonaparte
unmasked his guns, the gunners standing by with lighted fuse.</p>
<p>Tight-lipped, grim-eyed, he looked a moment. Then he spoke.</p>
<p>'Fire!'</p>
<p>Volley of grape followed volley of grape, tearing red gashes in
those serried ranks. The insurgent mass, taken aback by this hot
reception, wavered a moment, then broke and retreated in a
precipitate confusion of sheer panic.</p>
<p>By six o'clock that evening the revolt was, at least
temporarily, quelled, and the attack upon the Convention had been
abandoned by the sectionaries. Bonaparte reported to Barras in the
Carrousel.</p>
<p>Barras was out of humour. 'I told you to fire over their heads,'
he reproved him.</p>
<p>The Corsican shrugged. 'That would have meant a useless waste of
life.'</p>
<p>The war was carried into the Sections to prevent their factious
members from re-forming, and on the morrow began the work of
systematically depriving them of arms, so as to ensure their future
good behaviour. That evening, when the work was done, Barras
carried Bonaparte off to the Palais Royal to dine with Mademoiselle
Montansier by her invitation.</p>
<p>She received him effusively, entirely without reserve now,
displaying pride in him, for his name was today on the lips of
Paris, and congratulating him upon his achievement in so swiftly
stamping out so threatening a revolt. Barras had recommended to a
grateful Convention that it should permanently confirm Bonaparte's
appointment to the Army of the Interior, left vacant by the failure
of Menou, and a grateful Convention had shown itself eager to
secure the future services of so able a defender of its
existence.</p>
<p>Thus the Bonaparte who sat down to table that evening was by no
means the Bonaparte who had last dined in La Montansier's company.
Then he had been an out-of-work soldier of fortune rendered
desperate by the threat of utter destitution. Now he was a man
made; the reins of power were in his hands. And it may have been to
these altered circumstances rather than to the fatigue occasioned
by his Herculean exertions that was due the reserve, amounting
almost to taciturnity, in which he sat enveloped.</p>
<p>When issuing her invitation that day, Mademoiselle had asked
Barras how soon he thought her marriage could take place, and
Barras had urged that she'should without more ado put the question
to her betrothed himself. It was with this intent that she had
invited him tonight to dinner. But his frigid mood scarcely seemed
to encourage her, although she had done her best both in the
decking of her own person and in the dinner she had provided to
urge him into a frame of mind proper to the subject to be
discussed. Barras tells us that the dinner was magnificently and
splendidly served, and the epicurean representative was something
of a judge in these matters. Yet Bonaparte's compliments to his
hostess upon this were of the most perfunctory. Nor did he thaw to
any great extent when, raising her glass at dessert, she beamed
upon him and toasted him as 'the Victor of Vendémiaire.' She could
but assign his gloom and reticence to the fatigue occasioned by his
Herculean exertions.</p>
<p>They were still at table when Junot, an aide-de-camp of
Bonaparte's, was announced. The General went to see him in the
anteroom. Junot reported a fresh outbreak of trouble with the
sectionaries, demanding the General's instant presence at his post.
Without hesitation Bonaparte went to make his excuses to his
hostess, and then, pressed by Barras, promised to return as soon as
he should have made the necessary dispositions.</p>
<p>Those dispositions were quickly completed, and, assured that
everything was in order, Bonaparte was on the point of quitting the
Carrousel again, to return to Mademoiselle Montansier's table, when
Junot detained him with the announcement that 'a lady accompanied
by a young boy was asking to see him immediately. Impatiently he
consented to receive her. She came in, followed by a slender lad of
thirteen or thereabouts. But it is doubtful if Bonaparte so much as
saw her companion. His great eyes considering this woman saw
nothing else.</p>
<p>She was perhaps some three years older than himself, tall and
beautifully proportioned; and she bore herself with almost regal
dignity. Had not a future-telling negress in far-off Martinique
prophesied for her that she should be 'more than queen'?
Olive-skinned, with dark, liquid eyes and luxuriant brown hair, she
was to Bonaparte&mdash;and not to him alone&mdash;the loveliest
woman that he had ever seen. Spellbound, in silence, utterly
mannerless, he stared and stared, standing beside his table, and
making no attempt to break the silence by inviting her to speak. In
the end she spoke unbidden.</p>
<p>'General, I come to make a plaint.'</p>
<p>Still those staring eyes considered her, aglow, and still he
said nothing. She continued, therefore&mdash;though now a little
abashed by that discomposing silence and still more discomposing
stare.</p>
<p>'I am Josephine Beauharnais&mdash;widow of General Beauharnais.
This is my son. Your men today, in the course of disarming the
section in which we reside, invaded my house and took thence my
late husband's sword. General Beauharnais' son comes, General, to
beg you to repair an error committed in the general confusion, and
to restore to him that honoured blade.'</p>
<p>It was some seconds after she had finished speaking before he
shook himself out of his trance to consider the meaning of the
words he had but subconsciously heard. Then he bowed very low.</p>
<p>'Madame,' he said, 'to serve you were the highest honour. The
sword shall be returned.' And without drawing breath he continued,
oddly emphatic: 'Myself I'll bring it to you. Where do you live,
did you say, madame?'</p>
<p>He snatched up pencil and paper, and scrawled hastily the
address she gave. Then he escorted her to the door, and there bowed
low again.</p>
<p>When she had gone, it seemed as if he had been suddenly reduced
by the loss of some vital part of him. He paced slowly back to his
table, and sat down, a man bemused.</p>
<p>There Barras found him two hours later when at last he came.</p>
<p>'Why did you not return?' the representative reproved him.</p>
<p>Bonaparte raised a vacant face.</p>
<p>'Eh? Return? Where? Oh! Ah...I was busy.' The firm lips snapped
tightly.</p>
<p>'Mademoiselle,' Barras informed him, 'was deeply disappointed.
She has a delicate question to ask. But it will keep until
tomorrow. You are to dine with her again.'</p>
<p>Bonaparte looked at him inscrutably. 'Tomorrow?'</p>
<p>'Tomorrow.'</p>
<p>'I can't, tomorrow.'</p>
<p>'I will tell her, then, to restrain her impatience until the
next day.'</p>
<p>'Nor the next day,' said Bonaparte.</p>
<p>'When, then?' demanded Barras, in sharp surprise.</p>
<p>'Never,' said the Victor of Vendémiaire, who had found his
destiny.</p>
