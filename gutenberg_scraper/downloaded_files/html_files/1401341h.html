  <h3>A NICHOLAS GOADE STORY</h3>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">BY the side of one of those winding byways which connect a
  few scattered hamlets upon the lower fringe of Exmoor with the important town
  of Market Bridgeford, a man stood painting an execrable water colour. A few
  yards away, drawn up in the shade of the high hedge, was an ancient Ford car;
  seated by the side of the man, and obviously bored with the whole proceeding,
  was a small, fat, white dog of the Sealyham type. The man had not the
  appearance of an artist, as indeed he was not. He was powerfully built,
  somewhat ruddy of complexion, with shrewd, blue eyes and an indomitable jaw.
  A physiognomy which might have been on the heavy side was redeemed by a
  humorous mouth. He had masses of dark brown hair&mdash;rather too much of it
  for careful arrangement&mdash;and the fingers which gripped his brush were
  the fingers of a sculptor rather than of a painter. His name was Nicholas
  Goade. He was thirty-eight years old, and he was enjoying his first long
  holiday&mdash;earned in somewhat singular fashion&mdash;since he joined the
  force. A month earlier he had arrested single-handed a criminal who for five
  years had defied the police of New York and London, and had simultaneously
  been handed a cheque for twenty-five thousand dollars from the former and six
  months' leave of absence from English headquarters. Hence this long-planned
  vacation.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the peace of the early summer afternoon was curiously disturbed.
  Flip, the first to realise the approach of the unusual, sat up with a short,
  warning bark. Goade turned his head, and, with his hand shading his eyes,
  gazed down the road. A riderless horse was galloping towards them, the
  thunder of its hoofs becoming each second more distinct. In the far distance,
  where the road wound its way in to the hills again after a short
  disappearance in the valley, was a little cloud of dust. There was no other
  sign of life or movement in this dreaming landscape.</p>

  <p>Nicholas Goade thrust his precious canvas into the car and stood for a
  moment in the middle of the road without any very clear idea as to his course
  of action. He was a humane man, but he was also a man of common sense, and he
  had no intention of risking his life or even a serious injury for the sake of
  a runaway horse who would probably come to a standstill of its own accord as
  soon as its energies were spent. As a matter of fact, action on his part
  became unnecessary. The horse, as soon as it caught sight of him, slackened
  speed, looked around for a moment nervously, and then came on at a walk. It
  was still terrified, its ears laid back, its coat bathed in sweat, the
  stirrups jangling against its heaving sides; but it seemed to recognise in
  the man who confronted it a soothing influence. Goade patted its streaming
  neck, examined the great weal down its flank, led it on to the turf by the
  side of the road, and then, climbing into his car, drove in the direction
  from which the runaway had come.</p>

  <p>About half a mile back, on the edge of the common which skirted the road,
  he came to the spot from which the animal had apparently started. The figure
  of a man in ordinary riding clothes was lying stretched upon the turf, face
  downwards and motionless. Goade bent over him, and, accustomed though he was
  to terrible sights, he felt a little surge of horror at the nature of the
  injuries to the man's head and neck. He returned to the car, fetched his rug,
  and, after another glance at the prostrate figure, covered it over. Then,
  with the instinct which belonged to his profession, he looked around for
  signs of some struggle between the man and the horse. He was puzzled to find
  none. The turf was nowhere cut up and, soft and yielding though it was, bore
  only the imprints of the lightest of hoof marks. The scene of the tragedy was
  a little inlet of turf, surrounded by gorse bushes&mdash;an inlet on to which
  the horse had presumably turned from the road for some reason. About twenty
  yards away was a small shed&mdash;apparently a shepherd's shelter. There was
  no human being in sight, nor sign of any vehicle. Goade bent once more over
  the man's body and felt it with a practised hand. It was still warm. Death
  could only have taken place a few minutes before. He turned round at the
  sound of horse's hoofs, slow now and faltering. The animal had followed him
  up the hill, and, after standing for a moment shivering on the edge of the
  road, advanced slowly, whinnied, and thrust its head down as though it
  recognised its prostrate master. Goade examined once more the weal on its
  side, patted its neck gently, and climbed on to a small hillock. The little
  cloud of dust on the ribbon of road skirting the hillside had vanished. There
  was no sign anywhere of pedestrian or vehicle. After a few moments'
  reflection, he slipped off his shoes, led the horse quietly to the other side
  of the road, and commenced a closer examination of the little semicircle of
  turf upon which the accident seemed to have happened. In a quarter of an
  hour's time he stood upright again and looked around. There was still no sign
  anywhere of the assistance which was necessary before he could move the dead
  man. He put on his shoes and made his way along the narrow path towards the
  shed.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SOON after the little cloud of dust upon the hillside had
  vanished, George Unwin turned in at the drive of his pleasantly situated,
  small country home, brought his car to a standstill at the front door, and
  rang the outside bell which would summon the chauffeur from the garage. He
  paused for a moment, drawing off his gloves and looking around him as though
  enjoying the prospect&mdash;a pleasant one enough: a vision of a trimly kept
  lawn with a paddock behind, a profusion of flowers, everywhere signs of
  well-being and comfort. Humming lightly to himself, he felt one of the back
  tyres and gave instructions concerning it to the chauffeur, who came hurrying
  up from the garage. Afterwards he nodded pleasantly to the parlour maid who
  had opened the door in response to his ring, laid his hat and gloves upon the
  hall table, and, still humming under his breath, strolled with his habitual
  air of dignified composure into the room which was given over to him as a
  study. There was nothing in his manner to denote that within the last quarter
  of an hour he had committed a brutal murder.</p>

  <p>"Is your mistress in, Rose?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"The mistress is resting, sir," the maid replied. "She ordered the little
  car for this afternoon, but changed her mind. She was complaining of a
  headache after lunch."</p>

  <p>Her master nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll have a whisky and soda," he decided. "Bring me the things
  and I'll help myself."</p>

  <p>The maid hastened to obey, and George Unwin mixed himself a drink with
  steady fingers. Nevertheless, as soon as the girl had departed, he doubled
  the quantity of whisky and drank half the contents of the tumbler at a gulp.
  Afterwards he stood and looked at himself carefully in the mirror. There were
  no signs of any disturbance either in his face, his attire, or the prim
  arrangement of his collar and tie. He was dressed&mdash;as became a
  respectable solicitor with a large practice&mdash;neatly and with a certain
  decorum which might be taken as a tribute to his profession. His tie was
  arranged almost as a stock, his collar, spotlessly white, a trifle higher
  than was altogether customary for country wear. His clothes were of dark
  serge, quietly fashioned and well fitting. He continued to examine himself
  with the utmost care. His black hair was unruffled, his eyes perhaps a little
  brighter than usual, and there was even a faint tinge of colour in his
  ordinarily pallid cheeks. Satisfied with his scrutiny, he approached a
  bookshelf, and, withdrawing a volume entitled <i>Practical Criminology</i>
  from a selected series dealing with the same subject, seated himself in an
  easychair and buried himself in its contents. He knew the exact chapter of
  which he was in search, and turned to it eagerly&mdash;a chapter containing
  the confessions of a criminal who had planned a murder for three months,
  planned and thought out every detail with scientific accuracy, but through
  some strange chain of circumstances had left one single clue. He devoured the
  few pages, then, half closing the book, with his finger in the place, gave
  himself up to thought. Was there anything that he had done or left undone?
  One by one he went over the events of the afternoon. He had left his office
  in the neighbouring market town earlier than usual, it was true, but during
  the summer months this was by no means an unusual occurrence. No one had seen
  him turn off the main road which would have been the quickest route to his
  abode, nor had he encountered a single soul along that stretch of lonely
  byway where, somewhere or other, he knew that he would meet the man whom he
  sought. They had come together just as he had planned and desired, within a
  few yards of the shed. He went over in memory the brief words which had
  passed between them, then the sudden throwing away of the hypocrisy of years,
  the lurid outburst when once he was sure of his man, the restrained passion
  of months, blazing in a torrent of words, nerving his arm to that
  unforgettable deed. It had been almost easier than he had expected. Even a
  strong man, half stunned, is not so very difficult to kill. George Unwin sat
  in his chair and gloated. The silent hatred of those miserable months, so
  well concealed, had spent itself in those wild moments. He became more and
  more exultant. He told himself that he had made no mistake, that he was safe,
  and that that silent, gnawing agony at which no one had guessed, which had
  made his life a hell, had gone. It was early days yet for the new horror to
  be born.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of light footsteps in the hall, and his fingers
  stiffened upon the volume which he was holding. He threw it down upon the
  table just as the door opened and his wife entered. He half rose to his feet
  as he greeted her. His manners were always precise.</p>

  <p>"You're home early, George," she remarked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There was very little doing at the office. I hope Rose is going to give
  us tea in the garden."</p>

  <p>"Of course she can."</p>

  <p>He watched her covertly as she stood with her finger upon the bell. She
  was a woman of negative complexion, with a graceful figure, lips unusually
  scarlet, and eyes of elusive colour. She had the air of being a foreigner,
  although, as a matter of fact, she had been born and lived most of her life
  in the neighbouring village. As he watched her he remembered some of the
  legends of the Spaniards who had made a settlement in the vicinity hundreds
  of years ago. Without a doubt there was foreign blood in her&mdash;perhaps in
  him too. He felt very un-English this afternoon. He felt very unlike George
  Unwin, Esquire, of Unwin, Brooks &amp; Calvert, solicitors, Clerk to the
  County Council, Under-Sheriff of the County, the holder of many other public
  offices. That legend of foreign blood was probably true, or George Unwin, so
  much respected as the embodiment of legal distinction and upright living,
  would never have felt the fierce joy he was feeling at that moment.</p>

  <p>"I thought perhaps that I should find you motoring," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I don't go out every afternoon," she answered carelessly.</p>

  <p>A lie, he told himself. He knew&mdash;for days he had known&mdash;all
  about those picnic luncheons, little excursions to the wood, the telephone
  first to his office to be sure of his movements. He knew very well why he had
  found her at home that afternoon. From the extension to his office he had
  listened to her casual enquiry outside to the clerks, heard the reply given
  according to his instructions&mdash;"Mr. Unwin will be coming home early." It
  had been necessary to keep her out of the way that afternoon. Would she ever
  guess? he wondered.</p>

  <p>She gave him tea in the shade of the cedar tree, and they spoke of
  indifferent things&mdash;their neighbours, a coming tennis tournament. Then,
  without a tremor in his voice, he introduced the name of the man who was
  lying dead by the roadside.</p>

  <p>"Seen anything of Sir Michael the last few days?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"How should I?" she asked. "He very seldom calls unless you are here."</p>

  <p>"Liar!" he thought to himself. He studied her with a new and strange
  interest. Such perfect deceit was in itself an attribute of the science which
  for years had been his hobby. What a criminal she herself would have made.
  Perhaps if he had not discovered her secret by the merest chance, he might
  himself have been her victim. A woman who could deceive like that could also
  kill.</p>

  <p>"Shall we walk down to the hayfield?" she suggested. "Crask says that we
  shall have quite a crop."</p>

  <p>He strolled along by her side, smoking the cigarette which he usually lit
  after tea&mdash;the one cigarette which was to last him until dinner time.
  Again they spoke of indifferent matters, pleasantly and with no apparent lack
  of interest. No one could have guessed at the wall between them, the wall
  which he had seen growing day by day in ever deepening despair. Now and then,
  as they paraded their little domain&mdash;the domain, he reflected, where
  they were to spend the rest of their lives together&mdash;he looked down the
  drive and along the road. The postman came and went without news, a baker
  delivered bread, a motor-cyclist friend waved a casual greeting. After all,
  it was a lonely spot where the man lay dead!</p>

  <p>He dressed for dinner with slow deliberation, studying himself the while
  in the mirror. He had a long, lean face, not unpleasing, although his cheeks
  were a little sunken&mdash;not the face of a murderer, he thought, as he
  arranged his tie. That was a thing no one would ever believe of him. Well, no
  one would ever know it. He smiled grimly to himself as he thought of the
  future&mdash;thought of himself fulfilling with dignity all the various
  offices of the law, a well-respected man in his world, a trifle austere and
  parchment-like perhaps, in his dealing with human beings; certainly not a
  person to be suspected of temper, of passion, of the courage which arms a
  man's will to kill. There was scarcely a soul in the county who would not
  have laughed at the idea of numbering him amongst that ghostly little company
  who had qualified for the scaffold&mdash;some of whom had walked those few
  fatal steps, and some who had escaped. He belonged there, all right, but
  nobody would ever know.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AT dinner time and afterwards the devil entered into George
  Unwin. He ordered champagne, and he talked to his wife as he had not talked
  for months past, not since he had guessed, not since he had known. He watched
  her growing uneasiness&mdash;realised, too, that it made her more beautiful.
  Afterwards they walked in the garden together. His arm went around her waist.
  He took her hand in his, and, notwithstanding the warmth of the June evening,
  her fingers seemed icy cold. A nightingale sang, and they paused to listen.
  He could feel her trembling in his grasp. A torturer's sense seemed born in
  him in those few moments. He found no pleasure in holding her to him, in the
  kiss he forced from her shrinking lips, yet he played the expectant lover and
  felt a horrible joy in her sufferings. In the house she escaped, but he
  followed her to her little drawing-room. Her respite came by terrible means.
  He knew what it meant, the ringing of the bell at that unexpected hour. Did
  she guess, he wondered, that something might have happened, for her eyes
  shone strangely as she listened to the heavy footsteps in the hall? Rose
  bustled in with an air of importance.</p>

  <p>"The police sergeant would like to speak to you, sir," she announced.</p>

  <p>Even then he would not spare her. Malice was ablaze in him that night.</p>

  <p>"Ask the sergeant to step in," he directed carelessly.</p>

  <p>The sergeant presented himself&mdash;a large man, excited and perspiring.
  He saluted Unwin with the deep respect due to the arch-representative of the
  law. He looked towards Mrs. Unwin and made mysterious signs.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Sergeant?" Unwin asked. "Speak up."</p>

  <p>"It's a fair nasty business," the man answered, turning his cap over. "I
  was thinking maybe the lady mightn't like to hear."</p>

  <p>She leaned forward in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Sergeant," she insisted.</p>

  <p>"There's been a bad accident&mdash;a real bad 'un."</p>

  <p>"Any one hurt?" Unwin asked.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" his wife demanded, in a whisper which seemed to crackle
  through the twilight of the room.</p>

  <p>"It's Sir Michael, sir and lady," the man confided ponderously. "Met with
  an accident while he was out riding, seemingly."</p>

  <p>"Seriously hurt?" Unwin enquired.</p>

  <p>The sergeant shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He were stone dead when they found him, sir. A tourist gentleman from
  London had been sitting by the body for an hour and more, waiting for someone
  to pass. It were down on the Cudfield Lane, where not many do find their
  way."</p>

  <p>George Unwin held a glass of water to his wife's lips, but she waved it
  away. She was deathly pale, but she showed no signs of fainting.</p>

  <p>"You mean that he is dead, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"That surely is so," the man admitted reluctantly. "And a terrible thing
  for all of us, for a better man or landlord never was. He must have fell on
  his head, they reckon, and that bay mare of his got obstreperous and kicked
  him as he lay."</p>

  <p>"This is terrible news," George Unwin said, wondering at the solemnity of
  his own tone. "Where have they taken the body, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"That's just what I'm here for, to know your wishes, Mr. Unwin. A farm
  wagon was all that come along, and they moved 'un to the Red Cow at Cudfield,
  and laid 'un in the parlour there. The inspector, he sent me up right away to
  know if you'd any special wish about the inquest, or if it could be held
  there."</p>

  <p>For a single moment Unwin almost lost control of himself. Strange, with
  his perfect memory, his grasp of detail, his careful consideration of all
  that had happened, of all that might happen, he had forgotten one
  thing&mdash;he was the coroner, and it was his office to send this man to his
  grave!... When he spoke, however, it was after not undue hesitation, though
  he scarcely recognised his own voice. It seemed to come to him from a long
  way off.</p>

  <p>"The body had better remain where it is," he directed. "The inquest can be
  held in the market room at the inn."</p>

  <p>The sergeant took his leave and departed under the escort of the
  parlourmaid for entertainment in the kitchen. George Unwin and his wife were
  left alone in the room. It seemed to have grown darker during the last few
  minutes. Unwin bent over the lamp. He was stopped by his wife's staccato
  cry.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that, George. I can't bear it. Listen! Turn towards me. I want
  to see your face."</p>

  <p>He turned around without hesitation, even with deliberation. Their eyes
  met: hers afire with passionate, hysterical questioning, his face a mask.</p>

  <p>"You knew?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Be reasonable," he answered. "How was it possible? Besides, why should I
  have kept it from you all this time?"</p>

  <p>She said nothing more. Presently she looked away from him. She seemed to
  be gazing through the walls, and there was a horror in her face which awed
  him in spite of himself. He moved uncomfortably about.</p>

  <p>"You take this hardly, Julia," he said. "He was an old friend and
  neighbour, of course, but, after all, we saw very little of him."</p>

  <p>She made no reply. There was something about her dumbness which for the
  first time brought a tremor of icy fear into his heart.</p><br>

  <p class="first">GEORGE UNWIN had never more perfectly embodied the dignity
  and sufficiency of the law than at the inquest over which, in due course, he
  presided. It was he himself who, in the little room where the remains of the
  dead man had been placed, drew the sheet from his face, and, with the doctor
  by his side, explained the injuries. In his seat at the head of the long
  table in the market room afterwards, his grave, sympathetic voice seemed
  almost to have attained a new note of humanity.</p>

  <p>"This is a case, gentlemen," he said, glancing down at the little
  company&mdash;five farmers, one gamekeeper, a retired school-master, a
  labourer, and village tradespeople&mdash;"which will, I think, present no
  difficulties to you. The doctor will tell you that the injuries from which
  our dearly loved and respected neighbour died were undoubtedly caused by the
  iron shoe of a horse. How Sir Michael came to be thrown, we shall
  unfortunately never know, but it seems to me most probable that his horse
  stumbled, that they both fell, and that the kicking took place without any
  viciousness on the part of the animal whilst it was struggling to regain its
  feet. That, however, must remain a matter of speculation. It is just one of
  those terrible accidents which happen sometimes and for which we cannot
  altogether account. We were to have had here as a witness the gentlemen who
  discovered the body, but I imagine that he will have little further light to
  throw upon what has happened. Your verdict will naturally be one of
  'Accidental Death', and I trust that you will add to it the customary
  expression of condolence with the relatives of the deceased."</p>

  <p>There was a subdued murmur of acquiescence.</p>

  <p>" 'Accidental Death' it be, sure enough," one of the farmers observed,
  "and a cruel, unlucky thing. It do seem a queer business to me, though, that
  Sir Michael should have been thrown. He were a rare 'un on a horse."</p>

  <p>"What probably happened," Unwin pointed out, "was that the animal,
  startled by something in the lane, shied sideways on to the little piece of
  turf where the body was found. He probably stumbled in mounting from the
  lane&mdash;there is a slight incline&mdash;and then fell. The finest horseman
  in the world can do nothing with a stumbling horse."</p>

  <p>"That be true, sir," one of the farmers agreed.</p>

  <p>"What about the gentleman as found the body? Us'd like to have seen him,"
  someone else interposed.</p>

  <p>"He was summoned to the inquest," Unwin explained, "and, as you know, we
  waited ten minutes for him. It seemed scarcely worth while, in view of the
  fact that he can have nothing fresh to tell us, to adjourn, but, if you
  gentlemen wish it, we can easily do so. I am only anxious not to take up
  another afternoon just about harvest time."</p>

  <p>There was the sound of a motor horn outside. George Unwin looked up
  quickly. To him there was a note of something sinister in its shrill hooting.
  His composure, however, never wavered.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps this is our missing witness," he said, leaning back in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence, and then a knock at the door, which was
  opened by the police sergeant. Nicholas Goade entered, followed by a tall,
  slight man of military appearance.</p>

  <p>"Here be Chief Constable," one of the farmers whispered, nudging his
  neighbour. "What be he wanting, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>The coroner greeted the newcomers with dignity, and chairs were provided
  for them.</p>

  <p>"We have been hoping for your evidence, sir," he remarked, addressing
  Nicholas Goade. "You were summoned for two-thirty."</p>

  <p>"I must offer my apologies," was the quiet reply. "I was told
  three-thirty. In any case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off and turned towards his companion. The Chief Constable
  whispered in Unwin's ear, and there was silence for several moments in the
  room. Unwin inclined his head once or twice as though in sympathy with the
  words to which he was listening. Once he half-started and glanced towards
  Goade. At no other time did his face betray the slightest emotion. Finally he
  turned to the jury.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "Captain Faulkener here has laid before me certain
  facts which I think should be investigated. He points out that you have not
  had an opportunity of visiting the scene of this terrible accident.
  Personally I admit that I scarcely thought it necessary, but, as Captain
  Faulkener thinks otherwise, I am afraid I must trouble you to make the
  journey. Would tomorrow afternoon be suitable?"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of assent.</p>

  <p>"Then let it be to-morrow," Unwin decided. "Conveyances shall be here at
  the inn at two o'clock. That is agreeable to you also, Captain
  Faulkener?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," the Chief Constable replied. "I am sorry to have to interfere
  in the matter at all, Unwin. It certainly seems a clear enough case, but
  there are one or two minor points which I think had better be cleared up. Our
  friend Mr. Goade here must be considered."</p>

  <p>"It is my wish," George Unwin concluded, with a dignified little bow, "to
  conduct these proceedings strictly according to the law and with due
  consideration to any theories which you gentlemen may have to advance.
  Gentlemen of the Jury, I need not detain you longer. The inquest is adjourned
  until two o'clock to-morrow afternoon."</p>

  <p>There was nothing to call George Unwin to his office in Market Bridgeford
  that afternoon, but on leaving the inquest he deliberately made his way there
  instead of homeward. He sat in his private room, transacting insignificant
  business until the last of his clerks, with an apologetic cough, ventured to
  suggest that the hour for closing had arrived. At the Crown Hotel, where his
  car stood in the yard, he entered the bar parlour amidst many respectful
  salutations, and drank a glass of old sherry. He was a person of consequence
  in the little company, and was treated as such. The general topic of interest
  naturally enough was the adjourned inquest. He waved the subject away with a
  gesture of depreciation when it was mooted.</p>

  <p>"After to-morrow," he told them, "we can discuss the matter. Until then
  '<i>sub judice</i>.' You understand?"</p>

  <p>No one understood, but they shook their heads solemnly. Presently he lit a
  cigarette, and departed amidst a chorus of friendly farewells&mdash;a man
  highly thought of amongst them all, a man who upheld the dignity of the law,
  taking his place with the Bank, the Church, and the Squire amidst the Forces
  of the County... He reached home only a short time before dinner. Again he
  scrutinised his face as he leaned towards the mirror to straighten his tie.
  Was it his fancy, he wondered, or were there really shadows under his eyes?
  The heat, he told himself. It had been a trying day, and that sudden break in
  the middle of the inquest was, to say the least of it, disturbing. He would
  have liked that verdict of "Accidental Death" safely recorded.</p>

  <p>Julia was late for dinner&mdash;wandering in the garden, it
  seemed&mdash;he wondered whether with the object of avoiding him? During the
  service of the meal they spoke only of the heat, the crop of hay, the roses.
  Afterwards he felt suddenly weary. He had no longer the enterprise for
  wandering through the gardens, or the devilment for playing the torturer. He
  sat on a seat under the cedar tree and sipped his coffee. His wife, after a
  few minutes' hesitation, seated herself by his side. It was not, however,
  until the twilight deepened that she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Is it all over?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "The inquest is adjourned."</p>

  <p>He heard the quick intake of her breath&mdash;a little stabbing sound
  through the silence.</p>

  <p>"Adjourned? Why?"</p>

  <p>He knocked the ash from his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Faulkener, the Chief Constable, arrived with the man who found the body
  just as the jury were giving their verdict. Faulkener thought it better that
  the jury should visit the spot. They are going there to-morrow
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Who was this man who found him?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"His name, if I remember rightly, was Nicholas Goade. He called himself an
  artist."</p>

  <p>A flash of summer lightning opened the sky.</p>

  <p>She gave a little moan.</p>

  <p>"I think that there is a storm coming," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I too," he acquiesced. "Shall we move indoors?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she whispered, "what does this adjourned inquest really
  mean?"</p>

  <p>Their eyes met. It seemed to him in that awful moment that each knew the
  other's secret.</p>

  <p>"Simply a waste of time," he assured her briefly. "Nothing more will ever
  be known of the manner of Sir Michael's death than is known at this
  moment."</p>

  <p>For a long time she sat in silence. A jagged tongue of black cloud crept
  across the sky. Once more the heavens opened, and this time the thunder
  followed. Large drops of rain fell upon them. He rose to his feet and held
  out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come along!" he insisted. "Quickly! You know that you are frightened of
  lightning. Come!"</p>

  <p>She shrank still farther back in her chair, and he knew that it was no
  longer the lightning which she feared. He turned and left her. The rain,
  beating through her thin garments, wetted her to the skin. As soon as he had
  disappeared, she rose and made her way into the house by the back
  entrance.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE was a remarkable metamorphosis in the lonely
  Devonshire lane when, on the following afternoon, the four motor cars came
  sobbing up the hill and stopped opposite that semicircular piece of turf. A
  dozen policemen were there, holding a cord which enclosed seventy or eighty
  yards of common and included the shed. The members of the jury stood
  aimlessly about, looking down at the turf, still uncertain as to why they had
  been brought there. Captain Faulkener passed his arm through George Unwin's
  and drew him a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"Before we go any further, Unwin," he said, "I think you'd better get a
  grip of this business. Our friend Goade here, who happened in upon this
  affair, is quite a famous detective from Scotland Yard&mdash;the man, by the
  way, who got the twenty-five thousand dollars' reward for arresting Ned
  Bullivant. He came over to see me yesterday morning and drew my attention to
  certain facts. I must confess that at first I was inclined to consider his
  theory ridiculous. In the end, however, he converted me."</p>

  <p>"And what might be his theory?" George Unwin enquired, a little
  formally.</p>

  <p>"In the first place," the other continued, "the wounds upon Sir Michael's
  head are of a somewhat curious shape. As Mr. Goade has pointed out, they
  appear to have been made by a horseshoe, but scarcely by the rear portion of
  it. He has instituted a thorough search amongst the gorse bushes around, and
  about twenty yards away one of the men whom I have detailed over here
  discovered a loose horseshoe, upon which were marks of blood at a spot
  exactly coinciding with the worst of the wounds. They found the horseshoe, as
  I told you, about twenty yards away&mdash;just about the distance, you see,
  that a man might throw it from the scene of the accident."</p>

  <p>"You have the horseshoe?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. It is there for production before the jury. Further, as Goade
  has also pointed out, there is no sign whatever of the turf being cut up by
  the struggling of a fallen horse. On the other hand, there are marks of two
  distinct sets of footprints. Sir Michael, too, notoriously never used his
  whip, yet on the side of his mare there is to-day&mdash;I have seen her in
  the stables&mdash;a tremendous weal."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"Goade made a thorough search of the place whilst he was waiting. You see
  that little shed?"</p>

  <p>Unwin glanced at it and away again almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Underneath a stone there," the Chief Constable confided, "I found
  this."</p>

  <p>Unwin took the scrap of paper into his hand. The words suddenly danced
  before his eyes. The sweat from his fingers smudged the ink. He stared at the
  four words scrawled on a half sheet of his own notepaper, battling all the
  time with a sickly horror. His death warrant written in the frail caligraphy
  he knew so well!</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><i>"Be careful. George suspects!"</i></p><br>

  <p>"From all this, as you may imagine," Captain Faulkener continued, glancing
  over his shoulder at the little group of men standing about in the sunlight,
  "Goade has elaborated a perfectly reasonable and, to my mind, convincing
  theory. He found distinct traces of a car in the road which came just as far
  as here and no farther. His theory is that Sir Michael&mdash;poor old
  Michael; we all know that his reputation was none of the best&mdash;has been
  making assignations here with some young woman of the neighbourhood. Her
  husband or lover got jealous. She took alarm and left this note for him in
  the shed, which was without a doubt their meeting place. He came up as usual
  and found the husband or lover lying in wait. The murderer, whoever he may
  be, attacked Sir Michael with this horseshoe, stunned him with it
  unexpectedly, deliberately killed him, struck his horse that terrible blow so
  that it should gallop off, and left him lying here, apparently the victim of
  an accident. What do you think of that, Unwin?"</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" was the toneless reply. "Really, I must express my
  congratulations to Mr. Goade."</p>

  <p>"Don't hurry for a moment," the Chief Constable begged. "He is showing the
  jury the shed. Here they come."</p>

  <p>"They have seen now everything that is necessary," Unwin declared. "We
  will go back to the village and reopen the inquest. I must confess that in
  the light of all this my instructions to the jury were ill-founded. 'Wilful
  Murder against some Person or Persons Unknown' it will have to be this time,
  I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>Captain Faulkener shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>Glancing around, Unwin was suddenly aware that two of the attendant
  policemen had drawn a little closer to him. His hand disappeared for a moment
  into his waistcoat pocket, and afterwards his fingers rested upon his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily unknown, I am afraid, Unwin," his companion said
  solemnly. "The writing on that slip of paper&mdash;your stationery, by the
  by&mdash;has already been identified as the writing of your wife. The marks
  of the car which drew up here have been traced to your drive. The
  blood-stained horseshoe thrown into the gorse bushes was one you stopped to
  pick up just outside Cudfield village. This is a very painful duty for me,
  Unwin, but I am afraid I must ask you to consider yourself under arrest."</p>

  <p>The handcuffs were on his wrists before he could move. He followed with
  his eyes the winding road through the valley and around the hills to where he
  could catch a distant glimpse of his own house. The road seemed suddenly to
  stagger before his eyes. Two larks were singing directly above his head. A
  puff of hay- scented breeze was wafted across the road to mingle with the
  perfume of the sun-warmed gorse and wild thyme. The skies began to dance.
  Inside he felt the breaking of the waves. They were looking at him curiously
  now, crowding up towards him&mdash;his jury! He summoned all his
  strength.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen of the Jury," he faltered, "your verdict must be 'Wilful Murder
  against George Unwin.' I killed him. Thank God I killed him!"</p>

  <p>"A strange fellow," they decided at the Farmers' Dinner on the following
  Saturday. "For five-and-twenty years a stern, law-abiding, conscientious
  official of the law, and then&mdash;a murderer!"</p>

  <p>"Criminologically an amazingly interesting study," his successor, the
  deputy coroner, declared.</p>

  <p>"A drop of foreign blood somewhere," one of the twelve jurymen
  insisted.</p>
