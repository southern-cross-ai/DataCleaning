  <h2><a name="pre"
     id="pre">PREFACE TO THE FIRST GERMAN EDITION</a></h2>

  <p>IT was in Rome itself, in the sublime solemnity of the Colosseum, among
  the ruins of the palaces of the Caesars and crumbling pillars of the temples
  of the gods, that the first dreamy outlines rose before my fancy of the
  figures here offered to the reader's contemplation. Each visit added strength
  to the mysterious impulse, to conjure up from their tombs these shadows of a
  mighty past, and afterwards, at home, where the throng of impressions sorted
  and grouped themselves at leisure, my impulse ripened to fulfilment.</p>

  <p>I will not pause here to dwell on the fact, that the period of Imperial
  rule in Rome bears, in its whole aspect, a stronger resemblance to the XlXth
  century than perhaps any other epoch before the Reformation; for, without
  reference to this internal affinity, we should be justified in using it for
  the purpose of Romance simply by the fact, that hardly another period has
  ever been equally full of the stirring conflict of purely human interest, and
  of dramatic contrasts in thought, feeling and purpose.</p>

  <p>I must be permitted to add a word as to the notes.* I purposely avoided
  disturbing the reader of the story by references in the text, and indeed the
  narrative is perfectly intelligible without any explanation. The notes, in
  short, are not intended as explanatory, but merely to instruct the reader,
  and complete the picture; they also supply the sources, and give the evidence
  on which I have drawn. From this point of view they may have some interest
  for the general public, unfamiliar with the authorities.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p>IT was the morning of the 12th of September in the Year of Our Lord 95;
  the first cold gleam of dawn was shining on the steel-grey surface of the
  Tyrrhenian sea. To the east, over the gently undulating coast of Campania,
  the sky was tinged with that tender dewy-green which follows on the paling of
  the stars; to the west the waters still lay in impenetrable darkness. Their
  almost unruffled face was swiftly parted by a large trireme,<a href=
  "#1">1</a> just now making its way from the south and opposite to Salernum,
  between the Posidium<a href="#2">2</a> promontory and the Island of
  Capreae.<a href="#3">3</a> The oars of the crew, who sat in rows on three
  ranks of benches, rose and fell in rhythm to a melancholy chant; the
  steersman yawned as he looked into the distance, hoping for the moment of
  release.</p>

  <p>A small hatchway&mdash;fitted with silver ornaments&mdash;now opened on to
  the deck from the cabin between decks; a fat round head with short hair
  showed itself in the opening, and a pair of blinking eyes looked curiously
  round in every direction. Presently the head was followed by a body, of which
  the squat rotundity matched the odd head.</p>

  <p>"Well, Chrysostomus, is Puteoli<a href="#4">4</a> in sight yet?" asked the
  stout man, stepping on to the deck and looking across to the blue-black rocks
  of Capreae.</p>

  <p>"Ask again in three hours time," replied the steersman. "Unless you can
  succeed in looking round the corner, like the magician of Tyana,<a href=
  "#5">5</a> you must need wait till we have the island yonder behind us."</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed the other, drawing a little ivory map<a href="#6">6</a>
  from his tunic.<a href="#7">7</a> "Are those rocks only Capreae?"</p>

  <p>"Thou sayest, O Herodianus! Out there on the heights to the right, hardly
  visible yet, stands the palace of the glorified Caesar Tiberius.<a href=
  "#8">8</a> Do you see that steep cliff, straight down to the sea? That was
  where such useless fellows as you were dropped over into the water by
  Caesar's slaves."</p>

  <p>"Chrysostomus, do not be impudent! How dare you, a common ship's-mate,
  make so bold as to scoff at me, the companion and confidential friend of the
  illustrious Caius Aurelius? By the gods!<a href="#9">9</a> but it is beneath
  me to hold conversation with you, an ignorant seaman&mdash;a man who carries
  no wax-tablets<a href="#10">10</a> about him, who only knows how to handle
  the tiller and not the stylus&mdash;a common Gaul who is ignorant of all
  history of the gods&mdash;such a man ought not even to exist, so far as the
  friend of Aurelius is concerned."</p>

  <p>"Oho! you are dreaming! you are not his friend, but his freedman."<a href=
  "#11">11</a></p>

  <p>Herodianus bit his lip; as he stood there, his face flushed with anger and
  turned to the growing day, he might have been taken for an ill-natured and
  vindictive man. But good temper and a genial nature soon reasserted
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"You are an insolent fellow," he said laughing, " but I know you mean no
  harm. You sea-folks are a rough race. I will burn a thank-offering to all the
  gods when this accursed sea-saw on the waves is over at last. Was there ever
  such a voyage! from Trajectum<a href="#12">12</a> to Gades<a href=
  "#13">13</a> without landing once! And at Gades hardly had we set foot on
  shore, when we were ordered on board again! And if Aurelius, our noble
  master, had not had business to settle in Panormus<a href="#14">14</a> with
  his deceased father's host, I believe we should have made the whole voyage
  from His&shy; pania to Rome without a break. I will dance like the
  Corybantes,<a href="#15">15</a> when I am once more allowed to feel like a
  man among men! How long will it be yet before we reach Ostia?"<a href=
  "#16">16</a></p>

  <p>"Two days, not more," replied Chrysostomus.</p>

  <p>"Aphrodite Euploia be most fervently thanked!"</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about? Who is that you are blessing?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure, my good Chrysostomus," replied the other with a triumphant
  smile, "I was forgetting that a seaman from the land of the Gauls is not
  likely to understand Greek. Euploia, being interpreted, means the goddess who
  grants us a good voyage. Do not take my observation ill, but surely you might
  have picked up so much Greek as that in the course of your many voyages with
  the lamented father of our lord Aurelius."</p>

  <p>"Silly stuff!" retorted Chrysostomus. "Besides, I never sailed in the
  Greek seas. Ten times to Ostia, eight times to Massilia,<a href="#17">17</a>
  twelve times to Panormus and a score of times northwards to the seas of the
  Goths up by the land of the Rugii<a href="#18">18</a>&mdash;that is the sum
  total of my annals. But Latin is spoken everywhere; even the Frisii<a href=
  "#19">19</a> can make themselves understood more or less in the language of
  Rome; among the Rugii, to be sure, we talked in Gothic."</p>

  <p>"A poor excuse!" said Herodianus pathetically. "However I have talked till
  I am thirsty! I will be on the spot again when the master appears."</p>

  <p>He carefully replaced his little ivory map in the bosom of his under-
  garment, and was about to withdraw, when a tall youth, followed by two or
  three slaves, appeared on the steps from below. The ship's crew hailed their
  master with a loud shout, and Caius Aurelius, thanking them for their
  greeting, went forward while the slaves prepared breakfast<a href=
  "#20">20</a> under an awning over the cabin roof; only one of them followed
  him.</p>

  <p>It was by this time broad daylight; the whole eastern sky glowed with
  flame behind the blue Campanian hills, a light breeze curled the no less
  glowing sea into a thousand waves and ripples, and the prow of the galley,
  which was decorated with a colossal ram's-head<a href="#21">21</a> in brass,
  threw up the water in sparks of liquid gold. The palace of Tiberius on the
  top of the rocky isle seemed caught in sudden fire, at every instant the
  glory spread lower, kindling fresh peaks and towers, and up rose the sun in
  all the majesty and splendor of his southern might from behind the heights of
  Salernum.</p>

  <p>Herodianus, who had taken his place officiously close to his master,
  appeared to promise himself immense satisfaction in interpreting the young
  man's mood of devout admiration by a long quotation of Greek poetry. He had
  already thrown himself into a pathetic attitude and laid his finger
  meditatively on his cheek, when Aurelius signed to him that he wished to be
  left undisturbed. The freedman, somewhat offended, drew back a step or two
  while Aurelius, standing by the side of his favorite slave Magus,<a href=
  "#22">22</a> who preserved a discreet silence, leaned over the bulwark for a
  long space lost in thought, letting his eye wander over the open sea and
  linger for a while on the fantastic shapes of the rocks and mountains, which
  constantly shifted in form and grouping as the swift galley flew onwards.</p>

  <p>Capreae was already on their right hand, and the broad bay of
  Parthenope,<a href="#23">23</a> with its endless perspective of towns and
  villas, opened before them like a huge pearly shell; the dark ashy cone of
  Vesuvius<a href="#24">24</a> stood up defiantly over the plain where, a short
  time since, it had engulfed the blooming towns of Herculaneum, Pompeii and
  Stabiae. Now there rose from its summit only a filmy cloud of smoke, ruddy in
  the light of the mounting sun. Farther on, the quays of Puteoli were
  discernible, the stately buildings of Baiae<a href="#25">25</a> and the
  islands of Aenaria and Prochyta.<a href="#26">26</a> On the left hand the
  distance was un&shy; limited; vessels laden with provisions from
  Alexandria<a href="#27">27</a> and merchant-ships from Massilia slowly
  crossed the horizon like visions; others, with every sail set, flew across
  the bay to disembark their precious freight in the emporium of Puteoli,
  whence it would be carried to lay at the feet of Rome, the all-absorbing and
  insatiable mistress of the world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the slaves had laid the table under the awning with fine cloths,
  had arranged couches and seats and strewn the spot with a few flowers, and
  were now standing ready to serve the morning meal at a sign from their young
  master. The weary night-rowers had half an hour ago been relieved by a fresh
  crew, and the fine boat flew on with double rapidity, for a fresh breeze had
  risen and filled the sails. In an instant the whole face of the waters had
  changed, and as far as the eye could reach danced crest on crest of foam.</p>

  <p>Aurelius wrapped himself more closely in his Tarentine
  travelling-cloak<a href="#28">28</a> and involuntarily glanced at Magus, the
  Gothic slave who stood by his side; but Magus did not seem to see his
  master's look, he was gazing motionless and with knitted brows in the
  direction of Baiae. Then he shaded his eyes from the glare with his right
  hand.</p>

  <p>"<i>Hva gasaihvis.</i><a href="#29">29</a> What do you see?" asked
  Aurelius, who sometimes spoke in Gothic to the man.</p>

  <p>"<i>Gasaihva leitil skip,</i>" answered the Goth. "A little boat out there
  not far from the point. If it is the same in your southern seas, as in our
  northern ones, these good folks would be wise to get their cockleshell to
  shore as fast as may be. When the sea is covered with eiderdown in such a
  short time, it generally means mischief."</p>

  <p>"You have eyes like a northern sea-eagle. It is indeed, a small boat,
  hardly visible among the tossing waves, it cannot have more than eight
  oarsmen at most."</p>

  <p>"There are but four, my lord," said the Goth. "And with them three
  ladies."</p>

  <p>The wind was rising every instant; the trireme parted the water like an
  arrow, and the prow, now rising and now sinking on the billows, dipped in
  them far above the large metal ornaments.</p>

  <p>"It may indeed be a serious matter," said Aurelius; "not for us&mdash;it
  must be something worse than this that puts the proud 'Batavia'<a href=
  "#30">30</a> in peril&mdash;but for the ladies in that little bark..."</p>

  <p>He turned round. "Amsivarius," he cried to the head oarsman. "Tell your
  men to give way with a will; and you, Magus, go and desire Chrysostomus to
  alter our course."</p>

  <p>In a few seconds the vessel's head was turned round a quarter of a circle
  and was making her way straight into the bay. The accelerated thud of the
  time- keeper's hammer sounded a dull accompaniment to the piping wind; the
  sea surged and tossed, and the deep-blue sky, where there still was not a
  cloud to be seen, beamed incongruously bright over the stormy main. They were
  now within a hundred yards of the small boat, which was one of the elegant
  pleasure-barks used by the gay visitors to Baiae for short excursions in the
  bay. As the trireme came up with them, the rowers gave up their futile
  struggle with the raging elements and only tried to avoid being capsized. The
  ladies, it could be seen were much agitated; two of them, a richly-dressed
  woman of about forty and a young and blooming girl sat clinging to each
  other, while the third, tumbled into aheap at the bottom of the boat, held an
  amulet<a href="#31">31</a> in her hand, which she again and again pressed
  fervently to her lips.</p>

  <p>Aurelius gave a shout from the trireme, which the boatmen eagerly
  answered, and a sailor on board the Batavia flung a rope with a practised
  hand to the foremost of the men in the smaller vessel&mdash;the slave hastily
  tied it fast and cried out "ready," the sailor pulled firmly and steadily,
  the rope stretched taut, the little boat came on and in a few minutes lay
  under the lee of the galley like a fish judiciously hooked and landed. In two
  minutes more it was fast to the side of the trireme, and the ladies and the
  crew were placed in safety.</p>

  <p>Aurelius, leaning against the stern-bulwark, had watched the proceedings
  with anxious interest and now, as the ladies, exhausted by the tossing they
  had had, sank on to the couches under the canopy, he politely went forward
  and invited his unexpected visitors to go down into the more sheltered cabin
  rooms of the trireme. The younger lady rose at once, and with a dignified
  eagerness expressed their thanks. Nor was it long before the elder had quite
  recovered herself; only the old woman who held the amulet hid her pale face
  in the pillows as if she were stunned, while she trembled and quaked in every
  limb.</p>

  <p>"Come, stand up, Baucis," said the young girl kindly. "The danger is
  over."</p>

  <p>"Merciful Isis<a href="#32">32</a> save and defend us!" groaned the old
  woman, turning the amulet in her fingers. "Preserve us from sudden death and
  deliver us in danger! I will offer thee a waxen ship,<a href="#33">33</a> and
  sacrifice lambs and fruits as much as thou canst desire!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you superstitious simpleton!" said the girl in her ear. "How am I to
  bring you to your senses? Pray rather to the almighty Jupiter, that he may
  enlighten your ignorance! But come now&mdash;the noble stranger who has taken
  us on board his ship is growing impatient."</p>

  <p>A shrill cry was the only answer, for the vessel had given a sudden lurch
  and the old woman, who was sitting with her legs under her on the couch, was
  thrown off somewhat roughly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Isis of a thousand names!" she whimpered piteously. "That has cost me
  two or three ribs at least and a score of weeks on a sick-bed!
  Barbillus&mdash;you false priest&mdash;is that all the good your amulet is?
  Was it for this that I had my forehead sprinkled with water out of the sacred
  Nile,<a href="#34">34</a> and paid fifty sesterces<a href="#35">35</a> for
  each sprinkling? Was it for this that I laid fresh bread on the altars? Oh
  woe is me, what pain I am in!"</p>

  <p>While she was thus besieging heaven with complaints, Magus the Goth had
  with a strong hand picked up the little woman and set her on her feet.</p>

  <p>"There, leave off crying, mother," said he goodhumoredly. "Roman bones are
  not so easily broken! But make haste and get below; the storm is increasing
  fast. See, my master is leading your ladies down now." And as Baucis gave no
  sign of acting on the slave's advice, she suddenly found herself lifted up
  like a feather in his strong and sinewy arms and carried to the hatchway, to
  the great amusement of the bystanders.</p>

  <p>"Madam," said Aurelius to the elder lady, when his guests were snugly
  under shelter in the eating-room, "I am a Roman knight<a href="#36">36</a>
  from the town of Trajectum in Batavia, far north of this, not far from the
  frontier of the Belgae. My name is Caius Aurelius Menapius, and I am on my
  way to Rome as being the centre of the inhabited world, in order to improve
  and extend my knowledge and perhaps to serve my mother-country. May I venture
  now to ask you and your fair companion, to tell me who you are that kind
  fortune has thus thrown in my way?"</p>

  <p>"My lord,"<a href="#37">37</a> said the matron, with a gravity that was
  almost solemn, "we can boast of senatorial rank. I am Octavia, the wife of
  Titus Claudius Mucianus,<a href="#38">38</a> the priest of Jupiter, and this
  is our daughter. We have been staying at Baiae since the end of April for the
  sake of my health. The sea-air, the aromatic breath of the woods and the
  delightful quiet of our country-house, which is somewhat secluded, soon
  restored my strength, and I take a particular pleasure in morning excursions
  on the bay. We started to-day in lovely weather to sail as far as Prochyta;
  then the storm overtook us, as you know, at some distance from the shore, and
  we owe it to you and to your good ship, that we are so well out of the
  danger. Accept once more our warmest thanks, and pray give us the opportunity
  of returning in our villa at Baiae the hospitality you have shown us on board
  your galley."</p>

  <p>"With the greatest pleasure," said Aurelius eagerly, "and all the more so,
  as I purposed remaining to rest at Baiae&mdash;" but he colored as he spoke,
  for this was not the truth&mdash;he looked round in some embarrassment at
  Magus, who was standing humbly in a corner of the room and preparing to serve
  some refreshment. The eyes of the master and the slave met, and the master
  colored more deeply, while the slave laughed to himself with a certain
  satisfaction. Two other servants placed seats round the table in the old
  Roman fashion, for the custom of lying on a couch at meals was by no means
  universal in the provinces, and Aurelius knew that even in Rome women of high
  rank and strict conduct contemned this luxurious habit.</p>

  <p>The rocking of the vessel had ceased, for it had been steered into a
  sheltered cove of the bay, and before long a tempting breakfast was spread on
  the embroidered cloth; fish, milk, honey, eggs, fruit and a dish of boiled
  cray- fish, of which the scarlet mail contrasted picturesquely with the
  artistically- embossed silver-platter on which they were served.</p>

  <p>Aurelius begged his guests to be seated and led Octavia to the seat of
  honor at the upper end of the table. On her left hand her daughter, the fair
  Claudia, took her seat; Aurelius sat on the other hand and at the side of the
  table. Herodianus and Baucis, who was still very much discomposed, took their
  places at the other end of the table and at a respectful distance.</p>

  <p>"You must take what little I can offer you, ladies," said the Batavian. "
  We Northmen are plain folks..."</p>

  <p>"You are joking!" interrupted Octavia. "Do you imagine, that all the
  inhabitants of the imperial city are gourmands after the fashion of Gavius
  Apicius?"<a href="#39">39</a></p>

  <p>"Well," said Aurelius in some confusion, "we know at any rate that Rome is
  the acknowledged mistress of all the arts of refined enjoyment, and above all
  of the most extravagant luxury in food..."</p>

  <p>"Not half so much so as you believe," said Octavia. "You gentlemen from
  the provinces fall, without exception, into that strange mistake. A Roman
  lady in the same way is to you the type of all that is atrocious, because a
  few reckless women have made themselves talked about. You forget that it is
  in the very nature of virtue to remain concealed and ignored. But tell me, my
  lord, whence do you procure this delicious honey?"</p>

  <p>"It comes from Hymettus,"<a href="#40">40</a> replied Aurelius, who was
  somewhat disconcerted by the lady's airs and manners. "My friend here, the
  worthy Herodianus, procured it at Panormus."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Octavia, raising a polished emerald<a href="#41">41</a> mounted
  in gold to her eye, for she was short-sighted: "Your friend understands the
  subject, that I must confess&mdash;do you not think so, Claudia my love?"</p>

  <p>The young lady answered with vague abstraction, for some minutes she had
  sat lost in thought. She had hardly touched the delicacies that had been set
  before her, and she now silently waved a refusal to the slave who offered the
  much-praised honey. Even the vigorous struggle in which Herodianus was
  engaged with an enormous lobster<a href="#42">42</a> failed to bring a smile
  to her lips, and yet her expression had never been brighter or more radiant.
  Once and again her eyes rested on the face of the young Batavian, who was
  engaged in such eager conversation with her mother, and then they returned to
  the loop- hole in the cabin roof, where the pane of crystal<a href=
  "#43">43</a> shone like a diamond in the sunshine.</p>

  <p>Octavia was talking of Rome, while Herodianus entertained Baucis with an
  account of Menander's<a href="#44">44</a> comedies; thus Claudia could pursue
  her day-dream at her pleasure. She was in fancy again living through the
  events of the last hour&mdash;she pictured herself in the small open boat
  tossed on the angry waves; far away across the seething waters she saw the
  tall trireme&mdash;saw it tack to enter the bay. It was all vividly before
  her. And then the moment when the slave flung the rescuing rope! who was the
  man who stood, calm and proud, leaning over the bulwarks, undisturbed by the
  wrath of Nature? She remembered exactly how he had looked how at the sight of
  that noble figure, which seemed as though it could rule the storm, a sudden
  sense of safety had come over her, like a magical spell. Then, when she found
  herself on board! At first she had felt ready to sob and cry like Baucis; but
  the sound of his voice, the wonderful look of gentle strength that shone in
  his face, controlled her to composure. Only once in her life had she ever
  felt like this before; it was two or three years since, when she was out on
  an excursion to Tibur<a href="#45">45</a> with her illustrious father. Their
  Cappadocian horses<a href="#46">46</a> had shied, reared, and then galloped
  off like the whirlwind. The driver was flung from his seat&mdash;the chariot
  was being torn along close to the edge of a towering cliff&mdash;her father
  had seized the floating reins just in time, and quietly saying: "Do not be
  frightened, my child;" in five seconds the horses were standing still as if
  rooted to the spot. The feeling she had had then, had to-day been vividly
  revived&mdash;and yet, how dissimilar were the two men in age, appearance and
  position!&mdash;It was strange. And once more she glanced at the face of
  their host, which was glowing with animation as he talked.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the head oarsman's time-marking hammer ceased; the bright spot of
  light cast by the sun through the glass skylight on to the panelled wall,
  described a brief orbit and then vanished; the vessel had swung round and was
  at anchor.</p>

  <p>"Madam," said Aurelius to Octavia, "allow me to offer you my services. We
  Northmen rarely use litters,<a href="#47">47</a>&mdash;still on the principle
  that a wise man should be ready for all emergencies&mdash;Herodianus has
  provided my galley with that convenience."</p>

  <p>"And the litters are already awaiting your commands on deck," added the
  freedman.</p>

  <p>"You have surpassed yourself, Herodianus! Well, then, whenever it is your
  pleasure..."</p>

  <p>"Then it is settled," said Octavia, going to the door. "For a few days you
  will be my guest."</p>

  <p>"For as long as you will allow," Aurelius would have said; but he thought
  better of it and only bowed in answer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p>THE squall had completely died away; the waves were still tossing and
  tumbling in the bay, but the streamers of the crowd of barks, which lay under
  the shore, hardly fluttered in the breeze, and the fishingboats were putting
  out to sea in little fleets.</p>

  <p>Gay and busy was the scene on the quays of Baiae; distinguished visitors
  from every part of the vast empire were driving, riding or walking on the
  lava- paved<a href="#48">48</a> seawall, and the long roads round the harbor.
  Elegantly&shy; dressed ladies in magnificent litters were borne by
  Sicambri<a href="#49">49</a> in red livery,<a href="#50">50</a> or by
  woolly-headed Ethiopians.<a href="#51">51</a> Lower down a crowd of sailors
  shouted and struggled, and weather-beaten porters in Phrygian caps urgently
  offered their services, while vendors of cakes and fruit shrilly advertised
  the quality of their fragrant goods. Behind this bustling foreground of
  unresting and eager activity rose the amphitheatre of buildings that composed
  the town. Aurelius had been charmed with Panormus and Gades, but he now had
  to confess that they both must yield the palm in comparison with this, the
  finest pleasure-resort and bathing-place in the world. Palace was ranged
  above palace, villa beyond villa, temple above temple. Amid an ocean of
  greenery stood statues, halls, theatres and baths;<a href="#52">52</a> as far
  round as the promontory of Misenum the shores of the bay were one long town
  of villas, gorgeous with the combined splendors of wealth, and of natural
  beauty.</p>

  <p>The two ladies and their cort&egrave;ge proceeded for some distance along
  the shore of the harbor, and then turned up-hill in the direction of
  Cumae.<a href="#53">53</a> In front walked eight or ten slaves<a href=
  "#54">54</a> who cleared the way; then came Octavia, her litter borne by six
  bronze-hued Lusitanians.<a href="#55">55</a> Claudia shared her litter with
  Baucis, while Herodianus, Magus, Octavia's rowers, and a few servants with
  various bundles followed on foot. Atirelius had mounted his liispanian horse
  and rode by the side of the little caravan, sometimes in front, sometimes
  behind, and enquiring the way, now of Octavia and now of Claudia and
  Baucis.</p>

  <p>"Our villa is quite at the top of the ridge," said Claudia. "There, where
  the holm oaks come down to the fig gardens."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Aurelius in surprise. "That great pillared building, half
  buried in the woods to the left?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," said the girl laughing; "the gods have not housed us so
  magnificently. To the right&mdash;that little villa in the knoll."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried the Batavian; the disappointment was evidently a very pleasant
  one. "And whose is that vast palace?"</p>

  <p>"It belongs to Domitia, Caesar's wife. Since she has lived separate from
  her imperial lord, she always spends the summer here."</p>

  <p>The road grew steeper as they mounted.</p>

  <p>"Oh merciful power!" sighed the worthy Baucis, "to think that these fine
  young men should be made to toil thus for an old woman! By Osiris! I am
  ashamed of myself. To carry you, sweet Claudia, is indeed a
  pleasure&mdash;but me, wrinkled old Baucis! If I had not sprained my
  ribs&mdash;as sure as I live...! But I will reward them for it; each man
  shall have a little jar of Nile- water."</p>

  <p>"Do not be uneasy on their account," said Herodianus, wiping his brow.
  "Our Northmen are used to heavier burdens!" Then, turning to Magus, he went
  on: "By all the gods, I entreat you&mdash;a draught of Caecubum!<a href=
  "#56">56</a> I am bound to carry this weary load," and he slapped his round
  paunch, "this Erymanthian boar,<a href="#57">57</a> like a second Hercules,
  to the top of the hill on my own unaided legs! and I am dropping with
  exhaustion."</p>

  <p>The Goth smiled and signed to one of the slaves, who was carrying wine and
  other refreshments.</p>

  <p>"The wine of Caecubus," said Herodianus, "is especially good against
  fatigue. Dionysus,<a href="#58">58</a> gracious giver, I sacrifice to thee!"
  and as he spoke he shed a few drops as a libation<a href="#59">59</a> on the
  earth and then emptied the cup with the promptitude of a practised
  drinker.</p>

  <p>In about twenty minutes more they reached Octavia's house; in the
  vestibule<a href="#60">60</a> a young girl came running out to meet them.</p>

  <p>"Mother, dear, sweet mother!" she cried excitedly, "and Claudia, my
  darling! Here you are at last. Oh! we have been so dreadfully frightened,
  Quintus and I; that awful storm! the whole bay was churned up, as white as
  milk. But oh! I am glad to have you safe again! Quintus! Quintus!..."</p>

  <p>And she flew back into the house, where they heard her fresh, happy voice
  still calling: "Quintus!"</p>

  <p>"My adopted daughter,"<a href="#61">61</a> said Octavia, in answer to an
  enquiring glance from Aurelius.</p>

  <p>"Lucilia," added Claudia, "whom I love as if she vere my own real
  sister."</p>

  <p>Aurelius, who had sprung from his horse, throwing the bridle to his
  faithful Magus, was on the point of conducting Octavia into the
  atrium,<a href="#62">62</a> when a youth of remarkable beauty appeared in the
  door-way and silently clasped this lady in his arms. Then he pressed a long
  and loving kiss on Claudia's lips, and it was not till after he had thus
  welcomed the mother and daughter, that he turned hesitatingly to Aurelius,
  who stood on one side blushing deeply; a sign from Octavia postponed all
  explanation. The whole party entered the house, and it was not till they were
  standing in the pillared hall, where marble seats piled with cushions invited
  them to repose, that Octavia said to the astonished youth with a certain
  solemnity of mien:</p>

  <p>"Quintus, my son, it is to this stranger&mdash;the noble and illustrious
  Caius Aurelius Menapius, of Trajectum, in the land of the Batavi&mdash;that
  you owe it that you see us here now. He took us on board his trireme, for our
  boat was sinking. I declare myself his debtor henceforth forever. Do you, on
  your part, show him all the hospitality and regard that he deserves." Quintus
  came forward and embraced Aurelius.</p>

  <p>"I hope, my lord," he said with an engaging smile, "that you will for some
  time give us the honor of your company and so give us, your debtors, the
  opportunity we desire of becoming your friends."</p>

  <p>"He has already promised to do so," said Octavia.</p>

  <p>Lucilia now joined them, having put on a handsomer dress in honor of the
  stranger, and stuck a rose into her chestnut hair; she sat down by Claudia
  and took her hand, leaning her head against her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"But tell us the whole story!" cried Quintus. "I am burning to hear a full
  and exact account of your adventure."</p>

  <p>Octavia told her tale; one thing gave rie to another, and before they
  thought it possible, it was the hour for dinner&mdash;the first serious meal
  of the day, at about noon&mdash;and they adjourned to the triclinium.<a href=
  "#63">63</a></p>

  <p>Under no circumstances do people so soon wax intimate as at meals.
  Aurelius, who until now had listened more than he had spoken, soon became
  talkative under the cool and comfortable vaulted roof of the eating-room, and
  he grew quite eager and vivacious as he told of his long and dangerous
  voyage, of the towns he had visited, and particularly of his distant home in
  the north. He spoke of his distinguished father, who, as a merchant, had
  travelled eastwards to the remote lands east of the peninsula of the
  Cimbri<a href="#64">64</a> and to the fog-veiled shores of the
  Guttoni,<a href="#65">65</a> the Aestui<a href="#66">66</a> and the
  Scandii;<a href="#67">67</a> indeed Aurelius himself knew much of the wonders
  and peculiarities of these little-visited lands, for he had three times
  accompanied his father. Many a time on these expeditions had they passed the
  night in lonely settlements or hamlets, where not a soul among the natives
  understood the Roman tongue, where the bear and the aurochs fought in the
  neighboring woods, or eternal terrors brooded over the boundless plain.</p>

  <p>These pictures of inhospitable and desert regions, which Aurelius so
  vividly brought before their fancy, were those which best pleased his
  hearers. Here, close to the luxurious town, and surrounded by everything that
  could add comfort and enjoyment to life, the idea of perils so remote seemed
  to double their appreciation.<a href="#68">68</a> When they rose from table
  the ladies withdrew, to indulge in that private repose which was customary of
  an after&shy; noon. Lucilia could not forbear whispering to her companion,
  that she would far rather have remained with the young men&mdash;that
  Aurelius was a quite delightful creature, modest and frank, and at the same
  time upright and steady&mdash;a rock in the sea on which the Pharos of a
  life's happiness might be securely founded.</p>

  <p>"You know," she added earnestly, while her eyes sparkled with excitement
  from under her thick curls, "Quintus is far handsomer&mdash;he is exactly
  like the Apollo in the Golden House<a href="#69">69</a> by the Esquiline. But
  he is also like the gods, in that he is apt to vanish suddenly behind a
  cloud, and is gone. Now Aurelius, or my soul deceives me, would be constant
  to those he loved. It is a pity that his rank is no higher than that of
  knight, and that he is so unlucky as to be a native of Trajectum."</p>

  <p>"Oh! you thorough Roman!" laughed Claudia. "No one is good for anything in
  your eyes, that was not born within sight of the Seven Hills."<a href=
  "#70">70</a></p>

  <p>She put her arm round her gay companion, and carried her off half-
  resisting to their quiet sleeping-room.</p>

  <p>Neither Quintus nor Aurelius cared to follow the example of the
  ladies&mdash;not the Roman, for he had slepr on late into the day&mdash;nor
  the stranger, for the excitement of this eventful morning had fevered his
  blood. Besides, there was the temptation of an atmosphere as of Paradise,
  uniting the glory and plenitude of summer with the fresh transparency of
  autumn. During dinner Aurelius had turned again and again to look through the
  wide door-way at the beautiful scene without, and now he crossed the
  threshold and rilled his spirit with the loveliness before him. Here was
  not&mdash;as in the formal gardens of Rome<a href="#71">71</a>&mdash;a
  parterre where everything was planned by line and square; here were no
  trained trees and hedges, circular beds or clipped shrubs. All was free and
  wholesome Nature, lavish and thriving vitality. The paths alone, leading from
  the villa in three directions into the wood, betrayed the care of man. The
  whole vegetation of the happy land of Campania seemed to have been brought
  together on the slope below. Huge plane- trees, on which vines hung their
  garlands, lifted their heads above the holm- oaks and gnarled quinces. The
  broad-leaved fig glistened by the side of the grey-green olive; here stood a
  clump of stalwart pines, there wide-spreading walnuts and slender poplars.
  Below them was a wild confusion of brushwood and creepers; ivy, periwinkle
  and acanthus entangled the giants of the wood with an inextricable network.
  Maiden-hair hung in luxuriant tufts above the myrtles and bays, and sombre
  evergreens contrasted with the brilliant centifolia. In short the whole
  plant-world of southern Italy here held an intoxicating orgy. Quintus seemed
  to divine the thoughts of the young Northman, and put his hand confidingly
  through his guest's arm, and so they walked on, taking the middle path of the
  three before them, and gently mounting the hill.</p>

  <p>"I can see," said Quintus, "that you are a lover of Nature; I quite
  understand that a garden at Baiae must seem enchanting to you, who came
  hither from the region of Boreas himself, where the birch and the beech can
  scarcely thrive. But you can only form a complete idea of it from the top of
  the hill; we have built a sort of temple there and the view is
  unequalled..."</p>

  <p>"You are greatly to be envied," said Aurelius, "And how is it that Titus
  Claudius, your illustrious father, does not enjoy himself on this lovely
  estate, instead of living in Rome as I hear he does?"</p>

  <p>"As priest to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus<a href="#72">72</a> he is
  tied to the capital. The rules forbid his ever quitting it for more than a
  night at a time. Dignity, you see, brings its own "burdens, and not even the
  greatest can have everything their own way. Many a time has my father longed
  to be away from the turbulent metropolis&mdash;but no god has broken his
  chains. Unfulfilled desires are the lot of all men."</p>

  <p>He spoke with such emphasis, that the stranger glanced at him.</p>

  <p>"What desire of yours can be unfulfilled?"</p>

  <p>A meaning smile parted the Roman's lips.</p>

  <p>"If you are thinking of things which gold and silver will purchase,
  certainly I lack little. Everything may be had in Rome for money;
  everything&mdash;excepting one thing; the stilling of our craving for
  happiness."</p>

  <p>"What do you understand by that?"</p>

  <p>"Can you ask me? I, here and as you see me, am a favorite of fortune, rich
  and independent by my grandfather's will, which left me possessed of several
  millions at an early age&mdash;as free and healthy as a bird&mdash;strong and
  well-grown and expert in all that is expected of a young fellow in my
  position. I had hardly to do more than put out my hand, to acquire the most
  influential position and the highest offices and honors&mdash;to become
  Praetor or Consul.<a href="#73">73</a> I am well received at court, and look
  boldly in the face of Caesar, before whom so many tremble. I am betrothed to
  a maiden as fair as Aphrodite herself, and a hundred others, no less fair,
  would give years of their lives to call me their lover for a week&mdash;and
  yet&mdash;have you ever felt what it is to loathe your existence?"</p>

  <p>"No!" said Aurelius.</p>

  <p>"Then you are divine, among mortals. You see, weeks and months go by in
  the turmoil of enjoyment; the bewildered brain is incapable of following it
  all&mdash;then life is endurable. My cup wreathed with roses, a fiery-eyed
  dancer from Gades<a href="#74">74</a> by my side, floating on the. giddy
  whirl of luxury, as mad and thoughtless as a thyrsus-bearer<a href=
  "#75">75</a> at the feast of Dionysus&mdash;under such conditions I can bear
  it for a while. But here, where my unoccupied mind is thrown back upon
  itself..."</p>

  <p>"But what you say," interrupted Anrelius, "proves not that you are
  satiated with the joys of life, so much as&mdash;you will forgive my
  plainness&mdash;that you are satiated with excess. You are betrothed, you
  say, and yet you can feel a flame for a fiery-eyed Gaditanian. In my country
  a man keeps away from all other girls, when he has chosen his bride."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes! I know that morality has taken refuge in the provinces," said
  Quintus ironically. "But the youth of Rome go to work somewhat differently,
  and no one thinks the worse of us for it. Of course we avoid public comment,
  which otherwise is anxiously courted&mdash;but we live nevertheless just as
  the humor takes us."</p>

  <p>Aurelius shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said Quintus. "You good folks in the north have a stricter
  code&mdash;Tacitus describes the savage Germanic tribes as almost equally
  severe. But Rome is Roman.&mdash;No prayers can alter that; and after all you
  get used to it! I believe Cornelia herself would hardly scold if she heard...
  Besides, it is in the air. Old Cato has long, long been forgotten, and the
  new Babylon by the Tiber wants pleasure&mdash;will have pleasure, for in
  pleasure alone can she find her vocation and the justification of her
  existence."</p>

  <p>"And does your bride live in the capital?" asked Aurelius after a
  pause.</p>

  <p>"At Tibur," replied Quintus. "Her uncle, Cornelius Cinna, avoids the
  neighborhood of the court on principle. The fact that Domitia resides here is
  quite enough to make him hate Baiae&mdash;although, as you know, Domitia has
  long ceased to belong to Caesar's court."</p>

  <p>Aurelius was silent. Often had his worldly-wise father warned him never to
  speak of affairs of state or even of the throne, excepting in the narrowest
  circle of his most trusted friends; under the reign of terror of Domitian,
  the most trivial remark might prove fateful to the speaker. The numerous
  spies, known as delators, who had found their way everywhere, scenting their
  prey, had undermined all mutual confidence and trust to such an extent that
  friends feared each other; the patron trembled before his client, and the
  master before his slave. Although the manner and address of his host invited
  confidence, caution was always on the safe side, all the more so as the young
  Roman was evidently an ally of the court party. So the Northman checked the
  utterance of that fierce patriotism, which the hated name of Domitian had so
  painfully stirred in his soul. "Unhappy Rome!" thought he: "What can and must
  become of you, if men like this Quintus have no feeling for your disgrace and
  needs?"</p>

  <p>The next turn in the path brought them within sight of the little temple;
  marble steps, half covered with creepers, led through a Corinthian portico
  into the airy hall within. The panorama from this spot was indeed
  magnificent; far below lay the blue waters of the bay, with the stupendous
  bridge of Nero;<a href="#76">76</a> farther away lay Baiae with its thousand
  palaces and the forest of masts by Puteoli; beyond these, Parthenope,
  beautiful Surrentum,<a href="#77">77</a> and the shining islands bathed by
  the boundless sea; the vaporous cloud from Vesuvius hung like a cone of snow
  in the still blue atmosphere. To the north the horizon was bounded by the bay
  of Caieta<a href="#78">78</a> the Lucrine lake and the wooded slopes of
  Cumae. The foreground was no less enchanting; all round the pavilion lay a
  verdurous and luxuriant wilderness, and hardly a hundred paces from the spot
  rose the colossal palace of the Empress, shaded by venerable trees. The
  mysterious silence of noon brooded over the whole landscape; only a faint hum
  of life came up from the seaport. All else was still, not a living creature
  seemed to breathe within ear-shot...</p>

  <p>Suddenly a sound came through the air, like a suppressed groan; Aurelius
  looked round&mdash;out there, there where the branches parted in an arch to
  form a vista down into the valley&mdash;there was a white object, something
  like a human form. The young foreigner involun&shy;tarily pointed that
  way.</p>

  <p>"Look there, Quintus!" he whispered to his companion.</p>

  <p>"That is part of the Empress's grounds," replied the Roman.</p>

  <p>"But do you see nothing there by the trunk of that plane-tree? About six
  eight paces on the other side of the laurel-hedge? Hark! there is that groan
  again."</p>

  <p>"Pah! Some slave or another who has been flogged. Stephanus, Domitia's
  steward, is one of those who know how to make themselves obeyed."</p>

  <p>"But it was such a deep, heartrending sigh!"</p>

  <p>"No doubt," laughed Quintus; "Stephanus is no trifler. Where his lash
  falls the skin comes off; then he is apt to tie up the men he has flogged in
  the wood here, where the gnats..."</p>

  <p>"Hideous!" cried Aurelius interrupting him. "Let us run down and set the
  poor wretch free!"</p>

  <p>"I will take good care to do nothing of the kind. We have no right in the
  world to do such a thing."</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate, I will find out what he has done wrong. His torturer's
  brutality makes me hot with indig&shy;nation!"</p>

  <p>So speaking he walked straight down the hill through the brushwood.
  Quintus followed, not over-pleased at the incident; and he was very near
  giving vent to his annoyance when a swaying branch hit him sharply on the
  forehead. But the native courtesy, the urbanity<a href="#79">79</a> or town
  breeding, which distinguished every Roman, pre&shy;vailed, and in a few
  minutes they had reached the laurel-hedge. Quintus was surprised to find
  himself in front of a tolerably wide gap, which could not have been made by
  accident; but there the young men paused, for Quintus hesitated to trespass
  on the Empress's grounds.</p>

  <p>The sight which met his eyes was a common one enough to the blunted nerves
  of the Roman, but Aure&shy;lius was deeply moved. A pale, bearded
  man,<a href="#80">80</a> young, but with a singularly resolute expression,
  stood fettered to a wooden post, his back dreadfully lacerated by a stick or
  lash, while swarms of insects buzzed round his bleeding body.</p>

  <p>"Hapless wretch!" cried Aurelius. "What have you done, that you should
  atone for it so cruelly?"</p>

  <p>The slave groaned, glanced up to heaven and said in a choked voice:</p>

  <p>"I did my duty."</p>

  <p>"And are men punished in your country for doing their duty?" asked the
  Batavian frowning, and, unable any longer to control himself, he went
  straight up to the victim and prepared to release him. The slave's face
  lighted up with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, stranger," he said with emotion, "but if you were to release
  me, it would be doing me an ill&shy;turn. Fresh torture would be all that
  would come of it. Let me be; I have borne the like before now; I have only
  another hour to hold out. If you feel kindly tow&shy;ards me, go away, leave
  me! Woe is me if any one sees you here!"</p>

  <p>Quintus now came up to him; this really heroic resignation excited his
  astonishment, nay, his admira&shy;tion.</p>

  <p>"Man," said he, waving away the swarm of gnats with his hand, "are you a
  disciple of the Stoa,<a href="#81">81</a> or your&shy;self a demi-god? Who in
  the world has taught you thus to contemn pain?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," replied the slave, "many better than I have endured greater
  suffering."</p>

  <p>"Greater suffering&mdash;yes, but to greater ends. A Regulus, a Scaevola
  have suffered for their country; but you&mdash;a wretched slave, a grain of
  sand among mil&shy;lions&mdash;you, whose sufferings are of no more account
  than the death of a trapped jackal&mdash;where do you find this indomitable
  courage? What god has endowed you with such superhuman strength?"</p>

  <p>A beatific smile stole over the man's drawn features.</p>

  <p>"The one true God," he replied with fervent emphasis, "who has pity on the
  feeble; the all-merciful God, who loves the poor and abject."</p>

  <p>A step was heard approaching.</p>

  <p>"Leave me here alone!" the slave implored them. "It is the overseer."</p>

  <p>Quintus and Aurelius withdrew silently, but from the top of the copse they
  could see a hump-backed figure that came muttering and grumbling up to where
  the slave was bound, released him presently from the stake and led him away
  into the gardens. For a minute or two longer the young men lingered under the
  pavilion and then, lost in thought, returned to the house. Their conversation
  could not be revived.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p>THE second serious meal of the day, the coena<a href="#82">82</a> or
  supper had begun; the party had betaken themselves to the cavaedium,<a href=
  "#83">83</a> where it was now beginning to grow dusk. This airy
  colonnade&mdash;the handsomest portion perhaps, of an old Roman
  house&mdash;was here very pleas&shy;ingly decorated with flowers and plants
  of ornamental foliage. The arcades, which surrounded the open space in the
  middle, were green with ivy, while an emerald grass-plot, with cypresses and
  laurels, magnolias in full bloom, pomegranates and roses, filled up half the
  quad&shy;rangle. Twelve statues of bronze gilt served to hold lamps, and a
  fountain tossed its sparkling jet as high as the tallest trees.</p>

  <p>For some time the party sat chatting in the dusk; then two slaves came in
  with torches and lighted the lamps of the twelve statues; two others lighted
  up the arcades so that the painted walls and their purplish backgrounds were
  visible far across the court-yard. A flute-player from Cumae now played to
  them in a tender mode; she stood in the entrance, dressed in the Greek
  fashion, with her abundant hair gathered into a knot and her slender fingers
  gliding up and down the stops of the instrument. Her features were sweet and
  pleasing, her manner soft and harmonious; only from time to time a strange
  expression of weariness and absence of mind passed over her face. When she
  had done playing, she was conducted by Baucis to the back gate. She took the
  piece of silver which she received in payment with an air of indifference,
  and then bent her way down the hill to&shy;wards Cumae, which already lay in
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"Allow me to ask," said Herodianus to Quintus, "what is the name of this
  tunefully-gifted damsel?"</p>

  <p>"She is called Euterpe, after the muse who presides over her art."</p>

  <p>"Her name is Arachne," added Lucilia, "but Euterpe sounds more
  poetical."</p>

  <p>"Euterpe!" breathed the worthy Herodianus. "Heavenly consonance! Is she a
  Greek?"</p>

  <p>"She is from Etruria, and was formerly the slave of Marcus Cocceius Nerva,
  who freed her. She married in Cumae not long since."</p>

  <p>"As strictly historical as the annals of Tacitus," laughed Claudia.</p>

  <p>"I heard it all from Baucis."</p>

  <p>"Wretched old magpie!" exclaimed Quintus, inten&shy;tionally raising his
  voice. "If she could not gossip, she would lose the breath of life."</p>

  <p>"By all the gods, my lord!" exclaimed Baucis, laying her hands on her
  heart, "you are calumniating me greatly&mdash;do you grudge me a little
  harmless chat? All-merci&shy;ful Isis! am I to close my lips with wax? No, by
  Typhon<a href="#84">84</a> the cruel! Besides, I must instruct the
  daugh&shy;ters of the house; it is for that that I eat the bitter crust of
  dependence in my old age. Oh! Baucis knows her duties; have I not taught
  Claudia to sing and play the cithara? Have I not taught Lucilia more than a
  dozen Egyptian formulas and charms? and now I add to this a little sprinkling
  of knowledge of the world and of men&mdash;and you call it gossip! You young
  men of the present day are polite, I must say!"</p>

  <p>"Then you sing to the cithara?"<a href="#85">85</a> said Aurelius,
  turn&shy;ing to Claudia. "Oh, let me, I beg of you, hear one of your
  songs!"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," said the girl coloring slightly. "With your permission,
  dear mother...?"</p>

  <p>"You know my weakness," replied Octavia. "I am always only too glad to
  hear you sing. If our noble guest's request is not merely politeness..."</p>

  <p>"It is a most heartfelt wish," cried Aurelius. "Your daughter's voice is
  music when she only speaks&mdash;in singing it must be enchanting."</p>

  <p>"I think so too, indeed," added Herodianus. "Oh, we Northmen are
  connoisseurs in music. The Camenae visit other spots than Helicon and the
  seven hills of Rome; they have taken Trajectum too under their
  pro&shy;tection. Had I but been born in Hellas, where Zeus so lavishly decked
  the cornucopia of the arts with such pure and ideal perfection..."</p>

  <p>"Herodianus, you are talking nonsense!" interrupted the young Batavian. "I
  am afraid that the old Falernian we drank at dinner, was too strong for your
  brain."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon! that would be very unlike me. Since Apollo first laid
  me in my cradle, temperance has been my most conspicuous virtue..."</p>

  <p>A slave girl had meanwhile brought in the nine&shy;stringed cithara and
  the ivory plectrum; Claudia took them from her with some eagerness, put the
  ribbon of the lute round her neck and sat upright on her easy-chair. She
  turned the pegs here and there to put the instrument in tune, struck a few
  chords and runs as a prelude, and began a Greek song the delightful
  Spring&shy;greeting of Ibycus the Sicilian:<a href="#86">86</a></p>

  <p class="poem">"Spring returns, and the gnarled quince<a href=
  "#87">87</a><br>
  Fed by purling and playful brooks<br>
  Decks its boughs with its rosy flowers<br>
  Where, beneath in the twilight gloom,<br>
  Nymph-like circles of maidens dance;<br>
  While the sprays of the budding grape<br>
  Hide 'mid shadowy vine leaves.</p>

  <p class="poem">Ruthless Eros doth disregard<br>
  Spring's sweet tokens and hints of peace.<br>
  Down he rushes like winter blasts<br>
  Thracian storms with their searing flash&mdash;<br>
  Aphrodite's resistless son<br>
  Falls on me in his fury and fire&mdash;<br>
  Racks my heart with his torments."</p>

  <p>Claudia ceased; the accompaniment on the cithara died away in soft full
  chords. Caius Aurelius sat spell&shy;bound. Never had he dreamed of the
  daughters of the fever-tossed metropolis as so simple, so natural, so
  genu&shy;ine and genial. The strain almost resembled, in coy tenderness,
  those northern love-songs which he had been wont to hear from the lips of
  Gothic and Ampsivaric maidens. In those, to be sure, a vein of rebellion and
  melancholy ran through the melody and pierced through the charm, while in
  this all was perfect harmony, ex&shy;quisite contentment&mdash;an
  intoxicating concord of joy, youth and love. In this he heard the echo of the
  smil&shy;ing waves below, of the glistening leaves, and of heart&shy;stirring
  spring airs.</p>

  <p>"A second Sappho!" exclaimed Herodianus, as his master sat speechless. "I
  can but compare the sweet&shy;ness of that voice with the luscious Falernian
  we drank at dinner. That was a nectar worthy of the gods! Besides,
  indeed&mdash;the Hispanian wine&mdash;out there, what do you call the
  place&mdash;you know, my lord&mdash;what is the name of it&mdash;that was
  delicious too&mdash;and seen against the light What was I saying...? I had an
  aunt, she sang too to the cithara&mdash;yes she did, why not?&mdash;She was
  free to do that, of course, quite free to do it and a very good woman too was
  old Pris&mdash;Pris&mdash;Priscilla. Only she could not endure, that any one
  should talk when she blew the cithara..."</p>

  <p>Octavia was frowning; Aurelius had turned crimson and nodded to his Gothic
  slave, who was standing aside under the arcade. Magus quietly came up to
  Herod&shy;ianus and whispered a few words in his ear.</p>

  <p>"That shows a profound, a remarkably profound power of observation!" cried
  the freedman excitedly. "In fact, what does music prove after all? I play the
  water-organ,<a href="#88">88</a> and&mdash;hold me up, Magus. This floor is
  remarkably slippery for a respectable cavaedium. It might be paved with eels
  or polished mirrors!"</p>

  <p>"You are a very good fellow," muttered the Goth as he led him slowly away,
  "but you carry it a little too far..."</p>

  <p>"What? Ah! you have no sense of the sublime? You are not a philosopher,
  but only a-a-a-a man. But, by Pluto! you need not break my arm. I&mdash;take
  care of that, that... Will you let go, you misbegotten villain!"</p>

  <p>But the Goth was not to be got rid of; he held the drunken man like an
  iron vice and so guided him in a tolerably straight course. When they
  disappeared in the corridor leading to the atrium, Aurelius was anxious to
  apologize for him, but Octavia laughed it off.</p>

  <p>"We are at Baiae,"<a href="#89">89</a> she said, "and Baiae is famous for
  its worship of Bacchus."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to be vexed with him," added Lucilia; "he is so
  exceedingly funny, and has such a confiding twinkle in his eyes."</p>

  <p>"I am only annoyed," said Aurelius, "that he should have disturbed us at
  so delicious a moment. Indeed madam, your voice is enchantment; and what a
  heavenly melody! who is the musician who composed it?"</p>

  <p>"You make me blush," said Claudia: "I myself put the words to music, and I
  am delighted that you should like it. Quintus thought it detestable."</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay&mdash;" murmured Quintus.</p>

  <p>"Yes indeed!" said the saucy Lucilia. "It was too soft and womanly for
  your taste."</p>

  <p>"You are misrepresenting me; I only said, that the air did not suit the
  words.. It is a man who is here complaining of the torments of love, while
  what Clau&shy;dia sings does not sound like a Thracian winter storm, but like
  the lamentations of a love-lorn maiden."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" laughed Lucilia. "Love is love, just as air is air! whether
  you breathe it or I, it is all the same."</p>

  <p>"But with this difference, that rather more of it is needed to fill my
  lungs than yours. However, for aught I care the song is perfect."</p>

  <p>"You are most kind, to be sure! And you may thank the gods that you have
  nothing to do but to listen to it. , I have no doubt, that at the drinking-
  bouts of some of your boon companions the songs have a more Titanic ring and
  roar."</p>

  <p>"You little hypocrite! Do you want to play the part now of a female Cato?
  Why, how often have you confessed to me, that * you would give your eyes to
  be one of such a party if only it were permissible!"</p>

  <p>"Mother," said Lucilia, "do not allow him to make a laughing stock of me
  in this heartless way. 'If only I were a man,' you mean, not 'if it were
  permissible.'"/p&gt;</p>

  <p>"Very good!" replied Quintus.</p>

  <p>Caius Aurelius now expressed a wish to hear Claudia sing a Latin song, and
  she selected one of which the words were by the much-admired poet
  Statius,<a href="#90">90</a> who at that time was, with Martial,<a href=
  "#91">91</a> the reigning favorite in the taste of the highest circles. With
  this the stranger seemed equally delighted.</p>

  <p>When Claudia had ended, he himself seized the in&shy;strument and
  plectrum, and with eager enthusiasm in a full, strong voice sang a
  battle-song. The powerful tones rang through the evening silence like the
  rush of a moun&shy;tain torrent. His hearers saw in fancy the swaying
  struggle&mdash;the captain of the legion is in the thick of the
  fray&mdash;"Comrades," cries one of the combatants, "our chief is in danger!
  Help! help for our chief!&mdash;One last furious onslaught, and the battle is
  won!"</p>

  <p>The two girls shrank closer to each other.</p>

  <p>As the notes slowly died away, a figure appeared high above them in the
  moonlight, leaning over the parapet of the upper story.</p>

  <p>"By the gods! my lord!" cried Herodianus, "I am coming!&mdash;If only I
  knew where Magus has hidden my sword! Hold your own, stand steady, and we
  will beat them yet!"</p>

  <p>The party burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"Go to bed, Herodianus!" shouted his master. "You are talking in your
  dreams!"</p>

  <p>"Apollo be praised then!" stuttered the other, "but I heard you with my
  own ears, shouting desperately for help." And with these words he withdrew
  from the parapet, still muttering and fighting the air with his arms; and
  Lucilia declared that she should positively die of laughing if this
  extraordinary sleep- walker went through any farther adventures. The moon was
  already high in the sky, when the party separated. Quintus led his visitor to
  the strangers' rooms, wished him good&shy;night, and went to his own
  cubiculum<a href="#92">92</a> where his slaves stood yawning as they waited
  for him. For a time, how&shy;ever, he paced his room in meditation; then
  pausing in his walk, he looked undecidedly through the open door&shy;way and
  asked: "What is the hour?"</p>

  <p>QUINTUS CLAUDIUS. 43</p>

  <p>"It wants half an hour of midnight," replied Blepyrus, his body-
  servant.</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;I do not want to sleep yet. Open the window; the air here
  is suffocating. Blepyrus, give me my dagger."</p>

  <p>"The Syrian dagger?"</p>

  <p>"A useless question&mdash;when do I ever use any other?"</p>

  <p>"Here, my lord," said Blepyrus, taking the dagger out of a closet in the
  wall."</p>

  <p>"It is only as a precaution. Lately all sorts of wild rabble have haunted
  Baiae and the neighborhood. I am going to take a walk for an hour or so," and
  he went to the door. "But mind," he added, "this late ex&shy;pedition is a
  secret."</p>

  <p>The slaves bowed.</p>

  <p>"You know us, my lord!" they said with one ac&shy;cord.</p>

  <p>Quintus went out again into the arcades. The colon&shy;naded court lay
  white and dream-like in the moonshine, the shadows of the statues fell
  blackly sharp on the dewy grass-plot and the chequered outlines of the mosaic
  pavement. Quintus hastened noiselessly to the postem&shy;gate, which led from
  the peristyle into the park; he pushed back the bolt and was out on the
  terrace. Com&shy;plete silence reigned around; only the very tops of the
  trees bent to the soft night-breeze. Quintus looked down upon Baiae. Here and
  there a light twinkled in the harbor; otherwise it was like a city of the
  dead. Then he looked down the black darkness of the shrubbery paths into the
  wilderness and seemed to waver, but he drew a little letter out of the belt
  of his tunic and studied it, meditating.</p>

  <p>"In fact," said he to himself, "the whole affair wears the aspect of a mad
  adventure; it would not be the first time that malice had assumed such a
  disguise! But no! Such a scheme would be too clumsy; what warranty would the
  traitor have, that I should come alone? Be&shy;sides, if I have any knowledge
  of love-intrigue, these lines were undoubtedly written by a woman's
  hand."</p>

  <p>He opened the note,<a href="#93">93</a> which was written on pale
  yel&shy;low Alexandrian paper with the finest ink. The red silk that tied it
  was sealed with yellow wax, and bore the im&shy;pression of a finely-cut
  intaglio. The handwriting be&shy;trayed practice, and the whole thing looked
  as if it had come from the hands of a cultivated and distinguished fine lady.
  The contents answered to this supposition; the style was marked by
  aristocratic affectations and rhetorical grace, while it revealed that vein
  of eager, jealous passion, which stamps the Roman woman to this day.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about it," muttered Quintus, when he had once more
  carefully examined every detail. "This is in hot earnest, and she commands me
  to meet her with the assurance of a goddess. And with all her domineering
  confidence, what sweet coaxing&mdash;what in&shy;viting tenderness! It would
  be treason to the divine influences of Venus to hesitate. Nay, fair
  unknown!&mdash;for you must surely be fair&mdash;beautiful as the goddess
  whose inspiration fires your blood! Nothing but beauty can give a woman
  courage to write such words as these!"</p>

  <p>He replaced the note in his bosom and took the same path that he had
  trodden a few hours since with Aurelius; listening sharply on each side as he
  got farther into the thicket, and keeping his hand on his dagger, he slowly
  mounted the hill. All nature seemed to be sleeping, and the distant cry of a
  night-bird sounded as if in a dream. Before long he had reached the spot
  where the path turned off to the pavilion. The little temple stood out in the
  moonlight as sharply as by day against the dark&shy;blue sky, like an
  erection of gleaming silver and snow; the light seemed to ripple on the
  marble like living, trans&shy;lucent dew&mdash;and, in the middle, the
  goddess sat&mdash;en&shy;throned! a tall form robed in white, her face
  veiled, motionless as though indeed a statue. Quintus paused for an instant;
  then he mounted to the top and said bowing low:</p>

  <p>"Unknown one, I greet thee!"</p>

  <p>"And I thee, Quintus Claudius!" answered a voice that was tremulous with
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"You, madam, have commanded, and I, Quintus Claudius, have obeyed. Now,
  will you not reveal the secret I am burning to discover?"</p>

  <p>The veiled lady took the young man gently by the hand and drew him
  tenderly to a seat.</p>

  <p>"My secret!" she repeated with a sigh. "Can you not guess it? Quintus,
  divinest, most adorable Quintus&mdash;I love you!"</p>

  <p>"Your favors confound me!" said Quintus in the tone of a man to whom such
  phrases were familiar. His unknown companion threw her arms round him, leaned
  her head on his shoulder, and burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"Oh, happy, intoxicating hour!" she breathed in a rapturous undertone.
  "You, the noblest of men, my idol, whom I have thought of so long, watched
  with such eager eyes&mdash;<i>you</i>, Quintus, mine mine at last! It is too
  much happiness!"</p>

  <p>Quintus, under the stormy fervor of this declaration, felt an uneasy
  mistrust which he tried in vain to repress. This despotic "mine&mdash;mine"
  gave him a sensation as of the grip of a siren. He involuntarily rose.</p>

  <p>"My good fortune takes my breath away!" he said in flattering accents;
  doubly flattering to atone for the hasty impulse by which he had stood up.
  "But now grant my bold desire, and let me see your face. Let me know who it
  is, that vouchsafes me such unparalleled favors."</p>

  <p>"You cannot guess?" she whispered reproachfully. "And yet it is said, that
  the eyes of love are keen. Quintus, my beloved, Fate denies us all open and
  un&shy;checked happiness; it is in secret only that your lips may ever meet
  mine. But you know that true love mocks at obstacles&mdash;nay more, the
  flowers that blossom in the very valley of death are those that smell
  sweetest."</p>

  <p>Quintus drew back a step.</p>

  <p>"Once more," he insisted, "tell me who you are?"</p>

  <p>The tall figure raised a beautiful arm, that shone like Parian marble in
  the moonlight, and slowly lifted her veil.</p>

  <p>"The Empress!"<a href="#94">94</a> cried Quintus dismayed</p>

  <p>"Not 'the Empress' to you, my Quintus&mdash;to you Domitia, hapless,
  devoted Domitia, who could die of love at your feet."</p>

  <p>Quintus stood immovable.</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing," she said smiling. "No listener is near to desecrate the
  perfect bliss of this moonlit night."</p>

  <p>"Fear?" retorted Quintus. "I am not a girl, to go into fits in a thunder-
  storm. What I resolve on I carry out to the end, though the end be death!
  Besides, I know full well, that your favors bloom in secret places&mdash;as
  silent and as harmless as the roses in a private garden."</p>

  <p>Domitia turned pale.</p>

  <p>"And what do you mean by that?" she asked shud&shy;dering.</p>

  <p>"You live far away from Caesar, your husband; you are served by spies;
  your palace is a labyrinth with a hundred impenetrable chambers..."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Domitia, controlling her excitement. "But still, I saw you
  start. What dismayed you so much, if it was not the suspicion of danger?"</p>

  <p>"You know," answered the young man hesitating, "that I am one of those who
  are ranked as Caesar's friends.<a href="#95">95</a> A friend&mdash;though
  merely an official friend&mdash;cannot betray the man he is bound to
  defend."</p>

  <p>Domitia laughed loudly.</p>

  <p>"Fine speeches, on my word!" she exclaimed scornfully. "Friendship, for
  the executioner who cuts your head off! Fidelity to a bloodthirsty ruffian!
  No, Quin&shy;tus&mdash;I know better. You are staunch, but not from
  fidelity&mdash;from prudence!"</p>

  <p>Quintus struck his breast proudly with his hand.</p>

  <p>"You force me," he said, "to speak the truth, in spite of my desire to
  spare you. You must know then, that Quintus Claudius thinks better of himself
  than to stoop to be the successor of an actor!"</p>

  <p>"Mad fool! what are you saying..."</p>

  <p>"What I was bound to say. You thought I was afraid; I am only proud. No,
  and if you were Cypris<a href="#96">96</a> in person I should disdain you no
  less, in spite of every charm. Never will 1 touch the lips, that have been
  kissed by a buffoon&mdash;a slave."<a href="#97">97</a></p>

  <p>Domitia did not stir; she seemed paralyzed by the fury of this
  attack.&mdash;At last, however, she rose.</p>

  <p>"You are very right, Quintus," she said. "It was too much to expect. Go
  and sleep, and dream of your wed&shy;ding. But the gods, you know, are
  envious. They often grant us joys in our dreams and deny the reality. But
  now, before you go, kneel to the Empress!" and as she spoke a stiletto
  flashed ominously in her hand. Quintus, however, had with equal swiftness
  drawn his dagger.</p>

  <p>"Fair and gently!" he said drawing back. "The honor of being stabbed by
  the fair hand of Domitia is a temptation no doubt..." She colored and dropped
  the weapon.</p>

  <p>"Leave me!" she said, going to lean against the balus&shy;trade. "I do not
  know what I am doing; my brain is reeling. Forgive me&mdash;forgive me!"
  Quintus made no reply, and&mdash;casting a glance of furious hatred at
  him&mdash;she hurried down the steps, glided through the gap in the brushwood
  into the deserted park, and vanished among the shrubs.</p>

  <p>Quintus stood looking after her.</p>

  <p>"One foe the more!" said he to himself. "Well, what does it matter? Either
  to be made an end of by the knife of an assassin or to live on, my very soul
  sickened with it all... Pah!"</p>

  <p>And he made his way homewards, singing a Greek drinking-song as he
  went.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p>NEXT morning Quintus was up long before the sun, while in the atrium the
  slaves were still busy cleaning the walls and the mosaic pavement, so he
  lingered for a while in the peristyle. His eye dreamily watched the soft
  swaying of the trees in melancholy relief against the blue-green sky; light
  fleecy clouds floated in the trans&shy;parent air, and here and there above
  his head a star still twinkled fitfully. Quintus sat on a bench with his head
  thrown back, for he was tired and over-excited; an un&shy;wonted restlessness
  had brought him out of bed. How calm and pure was this early gloaming! In
  Rome, so thought Quintus, there was something uncanny and dreary in the early
  morning&mdash;the grey of dawn came as the closing effect of a wild night of
  revelry. Here, on the hills of Baiae, the stars winked like kindly eyes and
  the twilight soothed the spirit! And yet, no; for here too was the great
  capital; here too were storms and unrest. Rome, that monstrous polypus,
  stretched its greedy arms out to the uttermost ends of the world, and even
  into the calmest and most peaceful solitudes. Even here, by the sea,
  wantonness had spread its glittering snares; here too duty and truth were
  forsworn, and in&shy;trigue and inhumanity held their orgies. Quintus thought
  of the tortured slave... That pale and pain&shy;stricken face had sunk deep
  into his soul; strangely enough! for his eye had long been accustomed to such
  sights of anguish and horror. The bloody contests of gladiators had never
  roused him to any other interest than that in a public entertainment. But
  this particular picture forced itself on his memory, though&mdash;from the
  point of view of any Roman of distinction&mdash;it had no interesting
  features whatever, for of what account in the Roman Empire was a slave? And
  especially in the sight of Quintus, rich, handsome and brilliant? It was in
  short most strange&mdash;but that white, bearded face, with its lofty,
  unflinching expression never faded from his memory, and his inward eye found
  it impossible not to gaze upon it. Then, suddenly another figure stood side
  by side with it: The white-armed Cypris Domitia, the passion-stirred Empress.
  Here were pain, misery, silent abnegation&mdash;there were feverish desires
  and passions, reckless, greedy, all-absorbing selfishness... By the
  gods&mdash;there they stood before him&mdash;the slave and the imperial
  woman&mdash;both so distinct that he could have touched them as it
  seemed.&mdash;The slave had broken his bonds and put out his hand with a
  smile of beatitude, while the woman shrank away and her white arms writhed
  like snakes of marble. She threw herself on the earth, and her fair gold hair
  fell loose over the bleeding feet of the slave...</p>

  <p>Quintus started up, the murmur of the fountain had lulled him to sleep,
  and now, as he rubbed his hand across his eyes, a woman's figure was in fact
  before him, not so stately and tall as the moonlighted Domitia, but as fresh
  and sweet as a rose.</p>

  <p>"Lucilia! Up so early?"</p>

  <p>"I could not sleep and stole away softly from Claudia's side. She is still
  asleep, for she came to bed very late. But you, my respected
  friend&mdash;what has brought you out before daybreak? You, the latest
  sleeper of all the sons of Rome?"</p>

  <p>"I was just like you. I think the strong liquor we drank at supper last
  night..."</p>

  <p>"A vain excuse," said Lucilia. "When ever did good wine rob you of a
  night's rest? Sooner could I believe that you were thinking of Cornelia!"</p>

  <p>"What should make you think that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it is a natural inference. For what else are you her betrothed? To
  be sure you do not play the part with much zeal."</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"Well, do you not go to see Lycoris just as much now as ever you did?"</p>

  <p>"Pah!"</p>

  <p>"'Pah!' What need have you to say 'Pah!' in that way? Is that right? Is
  that horrid, shameless crea&shy;ture, who seems to turn all the men's heads,
  a fit com&shy;panion for a man who is betrothed? I know you <i>love</i>
  Cornelia but this is a spiteful world, and supposing Cornelia were to
  learn..."</p>

  <p>"Well, and if she did?" said Quintus smiling. "Is it a crime to frequent
  gay society, to see a few leaps and turns of Gades dancers and to eat stewed
  muraenae?<a href="#98">98</a> Is there anything atrocious in fireworks or
  flute- playing?"</p>

  <p>"How eloquent you can be! You might almost make black seem white. But I
  abide by my words; it is most unbecoming, and if you would but hear reason
  you would give this woman up."</p>

  <p>"But pray believe me, there never was a pretty girl for whom I cared less
  than for Lycoris."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! and that is why you are as constantly in her house as a client in
  that of his patron."<a href="#99">99</a></p>

  <p>"The comparison is not flattering."</p>

  <p>"But exact. Why should you frequent her house so constantly, if you are so
  indifferent to her?"</p>

  <p>"Child, you do not understand such matters. Her house is the centre of all
  the wit and talent in Rome. Everything that is interesting or remarkable
  meets there; it is in her rooms that Martial<a href="#100">100</a> utters his
  most pregnant jests, and Statius reads his finest verses. Everyone who lays
  any claim to talent or wit, whether statesmen or courtiers, knights or
  senators, uses the atrium of Lycoris as a rendezvous. Last autumn I even met
  Asprenas<a href="#101">101</a> the consul there. Where such men as these are
  to be seen, Quintus Claudius, at three and twenty, may certainly be allowed
  to go."</p>

  <p>"Quite the contrary," cried Lucilia. "If you had grey hair, like Nonius
  Asprenas, I would not waste words on the matter. But as it is, the Gaulish
  Circe will end by falling in love with you, and then you will be past praying
  for." Quintus looked gaily at the girl's smiling, mocking face.</p>

  <p>"You mean just the reverse," he said. "For I know you regard me as far
  from dangerous. Well! I can bear even that blow."</p>

  <p>"That is your new mood! There is no touching you in any way. If you had
  only half as much con&shy;stancy of mind as Aurelius!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! you like him then?"</p>

  <p>"Particularly. Do you know it would be delightful if he could remain here
  a little longer&mdash;I mean for six or eight days. Then he could travel with
  us to Rome."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said Quintus significantly.</p>

  <p>"Now, what are you thinking of?"</p>

  <p>"I? of nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"Go, there is no doing anything with you. Do not you see that I only
  meant, the long days of travelling all by ourselves&mdash;Claudia turns over
  a book, and you, you old lazy-bones, lie on a couch like an invalid&mdash;I
  find it desperately dull. A travelling companion seems to me to be the most
  desirable thing in the world&mdash;or do you dislike Caius Aurelius?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. If only his trireme had wheels and could travel over land."</p>

  <p>"His ship will take care of itself. He can come with us in the travelling
  chariot, and then he will be able to see part of the Appian way.<a href=
  "#102">102</a> It is a thousand times more interesting than a sea-
  voyage.&mdash;Now, do it to please me and turn the conversation on the
  subject at dinner to-day."</p>

  <p>"If you like," said Quintus.</p>

  <p>A slave now appeared on the threshold of the pas&shy;sage, which led from
  the peristyle to the atrium.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said: "Letters have arrived from Rome&mdash;and for you too,
  Madam..."</p>

  <p>"Then bring them out here."</p>

  <p>They were three very dissimilar letters, that Ble&shy;pyrus handed to the
  two young people. Lucilia's was from the high-priest of Jupiter; Titus
  Claudius Mucianus wrote as follows to his adopted daughter:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Health and blessings!<a href="#103">103</a> I promised you
  lately, through Octavia, your excellent mother, that my next letter should be
  addressed to you, my dear daughter. I know that you value such proofs of my
  fatherly remem&shy;brance, and I am glad that it should be so. However, what
  I have to write does not concern you alone, my sweet Lucilia, but all of you.
  The preparations for the magnificent Centennial Festival,<a href=
  "#104">104</a> which the Emperor Domitian&mdash;as you know&mdash;proposes to
  hold in the course of next year, have so completely taken up my time during
  the last few weeks, that I am sorely in need of the rest and comfort of
  regular family life. In addition to this, political disturbances of all kinds
  have oc&shy;curred. Caesar has sent for me six times to Albanum,<a href=
  "#105">105</a> and I assure you it has been incessant travelling to and fro.
  The matter is an open secret; all Rome is discuss&shy;ing the decrees from
  the Palatine<a href="#106">106</a> against the Naza&shy;renes.<a href=
  "#107">107</a> You may remember&mdash;that superstitious sect of whom Baucis
  spoke to you a revolutionary faction, who, a score or so of years since,
  stirred up the whole city and gave occasion for the stern enactments of the
  divine Nero? Now again they are stirring up revolt as if they were mad; they
  are shaking the very foundations of society, and threaten to overturn all
  that we have till now held most sacred. I must be silent as to personal
  affairs; enough to say that I am weary and overwrought, and that my heart
  longs to see you all again. I beg you therefore to make ready to start and
  return as soon as possible to the City of the Seven Hills. Your mother is now
  tolerably well again&mdash;thanks to all- merciful Jupiter&mdash;and Quintus
  will not be vexed to learn that Cornelia is now staying in Rome again. People
  are quitting their country homes somewhat early this year; it is long since I
  have passed the month of September so endurably. I shall expect you then, at
  latest, by Tuesday in next week. Allowing three days for the journey, I thus
  give you two days to prepare for it.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Pray greet your mother and your sister lovingly from me.
  This letter will, I hope, find you all in perfect health. I, for my part, am
  quite well.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Written at Rome, on the 11th September, in the year 848
  after the building of the city."</p>

  <p>The second letter was from Cornelia, Quintus' betrothed, and ran as
  follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Cornelia embraces her dear Quintus a thousand times. Here
  I am in Rome again, my beloved! My term of banishment to that odious desert
  at Tibur is ended. But, woe is me! Rome is dead and deserted too since you,
  my treasure, my idol, linger still far from the Seven Hills! Oh! how glad I
  am to hear from your father, that he is recalling you from Baiae sooner than
  was intended. Oh! Quintus, if you felt only one thousandth part of what I
  feel, you would fly on the wings of the storm to the arms of your love-sick
  Cor&shy;nelia. The days at Tibur were more dreary than ever. My uncle seemed
  to me so depressed and tormented by gloomy thoughts. To crown my misery, old
  Cocceius Nerva<a href="#108">108</a> must come and pay us a visit of eight
  mortal days. I shall never forget that week as long as I live! You know that
  when those two old men sit together, the house is as silent as a tomb; every
  one goes about on tiptoe. This Cocceius Nerva has the worst effect on my
  uncle. Only fancy what happened on the day when he left. My uncle had
  accompanied him to his chariot, and when he came back into the house he
  happened to pass my room, where Chloe was just putting some fresh roses into
  my hair. When he saw this, he fell into an indescribable fit of rage. 'You
  old fool!' he exclaimed pushing my good Chloe aside: 'Have you women nothing
  to think of but finery? Do you deck yourselves out like beasts for sacrifice?
  Away with your rubbish! the house of Cornelius Cinna is no place for roses!'
  And then he turned upon me in a tone which expressed volumes 'Wait a while!'
  he said. 'You will soon be able to do whatever pleases your fancy!' You
  under&shy;stand Quintus, he meant to refer to you. His words cut me to the
  heart, for I have known a long time that my uncle is not pleased at our
  connection. If my blessed mother had not made him swear, on her
  death&shy;bed, that he would leave my choice perfectly free, who knows what
  might not have happened. Nevertheless, it is always a fresh pang to me when I
  see how he cherishes a bitter feeling against you&mdash;for, in spite of
  everything, I respect and love him.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Take good care of yourself, dearest Quintus, till we meet
  again, soon, on the shores of the Tiber. Greet your circle from me, and
  particularly lively Lucilia. I remember her fresh, frank nature with special
  affection."</p>

  <p>The third letter, also addressed to Quintus, was from Lucius
  Norbanus,<a href="#109">109</a> the captain of the Praetorian Guard."<a href=
  "#110">110</a></p>

  <p class="letter">"Have you taken root in your horrid country villa"&mdash;so
  wrote the officer in his rough fun&mdash;"or have you drowned, in Vesuvian
  wine, all remembrance that there is such a place as the Roman Forum? How I
  envy you your unbridled wild-horse-like liberty! You live like the swallows,
  while I&mdash;it is pitiable! Day after day at my post, and for the last few
  weeks leading a perfect dog's life! Almost a third of the legion are new
  recruits, for again every hole and corner seems haunted. To-day, I breathe
  again for the first time, but alas! my best friends are still absent. Above
  all Clodianus,<a href="#111">111</a> who lately has never been allowed to
  leave Caesar's side. I am commissioned by our charmer Lycoris, to inform you
  that Martial's recitation<a href="#112">112</a> on the sixteenth of October
  is proceeding to admiration. A hundred epigrams, and half Rome lashed by
  them! The banquet, which is to close the recitation, is to be magnificent. I
  can take her word for it; we know our fair Gaul. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>"That is capital!" said Quintus, folding up the letter. Lucilia retired
  with her adopted father's letter to the sleeping-rooms, where Claudia and
  Octavia must by this time be up. Quintus went into the atrium and sat down by
  the fountain, to wait till Caius Aurelius should appear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p>THE day of their departure came. Aurelius had hailed the idea of
  travelling with his new friends with an eagerness, that had brought a saucy
  smile to the lips of the shrewd Lucilia. But he had nevertheless preferred
  the more comfortable sea-voyage to a journey by land, and he had urged it so
  pressingly and yet so modestly that Octavia, after some hesitation, had
  yielded.</p>

  <p>The second hour after sunrise<a href="#113">113</a> had been fixed for
  their start, and before daybreak the slaves were already busied in packing
  the baggage mules and preparing the litters in the forecourt. The noise and
  bustle aroused Quintus, and being unable to get to sleep again he rose,
  dressed for the journey, and went out to the pillared court, where Lucilia
  was overlooking the slaves at their work and urging the dilatory to haste in
  cheerful tones.</p>

  <p>"Restless being!" said Quintus in Greek: "Are you pursued by the gadfly of
  Juno,<a href="#114">114</a> that you set all the house in an uproar in the
  darkness of dawn? You must be afraid lest Aurelius' vessel should row off
  without us."</p>

  <p>"And do you complain of my carefulness?" retorted Lucilia. "Punctuality is
  the first virtue of a house mistress."</p>

  <p>"Aha! and since Lucilia's ambitions aim at that high dignity..."</p>

  <p>"Laugh away! A well-ordered home is very desir&shy;able for you; and it
  will be a real mercy when you get married. Since you have lived alone, you
  have got into all sorts of mischief. But what is it that you want here, you
  ugly Satyr? Do you not see that you are dreadfully in the way? There, now you
  are treading on the trav&shy;elling-cloaks! I entreat you leave the room to
  the household gods!"</p>

  <p>"What! I am in your way? That is your view of the matter; but it is you
  who are really the spoil-peace, the eternally restless storm who have so
  often come sweeping down on our idyllic calm. Of all the things, which remind
  us here of Rome, you are the most Roman. You have nothing but your little
  snub-nose to redeem you a little. But, by Hercules! when I see you bustling
  around here, I can picture to myself all the fevered tur&shy;moil of the
  great city<a href="#115">115</a> with its two million inhabitants. Well, I
  will taste the sea-breezes once more&mdash;once more, for a brief space,
  enjoy peace and quietness."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"I will wait for sunrise at the top of the hill, where the road turns down
  to Cumae. In Rome it rises through smoke and mist; while here oh!&mdash;how
  grandly and gloriously it mounts from behind the cone of Vesuvius..."</p>

  <p>"And rises there through smoke and mist!" laughed Lucilia. "Well, make
  haste and come back again, or we shall set off without you."</p>

  <p>She turned once more to the slaves. Quintus wrapped himself in his ample
  lacerna,<a href="#116">116</a> waved his hand to her, and went out.</p>

  <p>The high-road was absolutely deserted; he drew a deep breath. It was a
  delicious morning. His wish to bid farewell, as it were, to the sun and air
  of Baiae was not affected; like all Romans he raved about the sea. 117 Its
  shore was to him the one real <i>Museion</i>&mdash;as Pliny the
  younger<a href="#118">118</a> had once expressed it&mdash;the true abode of
  the Muses, where the celestial powers seemed nearest to him; here, if
  anywhere, while watching the waves, he found time and opportunity for
  self-study and reflection. He had now been living with his family in their
  quiet villa ever since the end of April, and had spent many hours in serious
  meditation, in congenial literary pleas&shy;ures and diligent study. He had
  once more learned the real value of retirement, which in Rome was so
  unat&shy;tainable. A long winter of dissipation had left him satiated, and
  Baiae's aromatic air, a simple existence in the bosom of his family, and the
  spirit of Greek poetry had combined to restore his palled senses and
  over&shy;excited nerves. And now, as the moment of return ap&shy;proached, he
  was seized more and more with the old spirit of unrest. He felt that the
  omnipotent sway of that demon called Rome would drag him back again into the
  vortex of aimless tragi-comedy, and now a last glance at the smiling and
  slumbering sea was a positive craving of his heart.</p>

  <p>He slowly climbed the hill. At about a hundred paces up, there was a spot
  whence he could see over the roofs of the tallest villas and down into the
  valley. His eye, though his purpose was to look far away and across the sea,
  was irresistibly riveted by an object that was quite close at hand. To his
  right a by-path led down towards the palace of the Empress, and the huge
  portico, with its Corinthian columns, gleamed pale and visionary in the
  doubtful light. But what attracted the young man's attention was a little
  side- door, which slowly turned on its pivot<a href="#119">119</a> with a
  slight noise, letting a female figure in Greek dress pass out into the road.
  Quintus recognized Euterpe, the flute-player. Limp and weary she climbed the
  steep slope, her eyes fixed on the ground, and as she came closer, Quintus
  could see that she had been weep&shy;ing bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, all hail!" he cried, when the young woman was within a few
  steps of him. Euterpe gave a little cry..</p>

  <p>"It is you, my lord!" she said with a faint smile. "Returning so late from
  Cumae?"</p>

  <p>"No, my good Euterpe. I am up not late, but early. But what in the world
  have you been doing at this hour in Domitia's palace? Has she been giving a
  feast? You do not look as if you had gathered a har&shy;vest of gold or
  flowers."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, my lord, no!" replied Euterpe, again melt&shy;ing into tears. "I
  have been to visit a friend, who is suffering terribly. Down in Baiae, where
  I was playing at night in the house of the wealthy Timotheus, Agathon the
  seer gave me herbs and salves&mdash;they cost me a heavy sum and since then I
  have been in there... Oh! his wounds are horrible... But what am I talking
  about! He is only a slave, my lord; what can Quintus Claudius care?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?" said Quintus, interrupting the agitated speaker. "But I
  am not made of stone; I know full well, that though among slaves there is
  many a scamp, there are also worthy and excellent men. And if, to crown all,
  he is the friend<a href="#120">120</a> of so charming a creature..."</p>

  <p>"Nay, my lord, you will have your jest&mdash;but if you could only see
  him, poor Eurymachus! If you could know how faithful he is, and how
  noble!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I call that being desperately in love!"</p>

  <p>Euterpe colored. "No," she said modestly. "I can accuse myself of many
  sins, but Eurymachus&mdash;no evil thought ever entered his mind."</p>

  <p>"Is love a sin then?"</p>

  <p>"I am married."</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;you were not wont to be so strict!"</p>

  <p>"And the greater pity! If I had always known Eurymachus, as I know him
  now..."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! and how do you know him now?"</p>

  <p>"He has opened my eyes; I know now how deeply I have sinned..."</p>

  <p>"He is a philosopher then, who converts fair sinners from their evil
  ways?"</p>

  <p>"He is a hero!" exclaimed Euterpe with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"You do not stint your praise. Does he belong to the Empress?"</p>

  <p>"To her steward, Stephanus. Ah I my lord, he is a tyrant..."</p>

  <p>"So they say."</p>

  <p>"How he treated the poor fellow! It beats all des&shy;cription. For one
  single word he had him flogged till he was raw, and then tied him up in the
  park in the noontide sun. The gnats and flies..." But at the woman's last
  words Quintus had gone nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said hurriedly: "I believe I know your Eurymachus&mdash;a
  pale face with a dark beard&mdash;quiet, contemning pain&mdash;standing by
  the stake like a martyr..."</p>

  <p>"You saw him?" cried Euterpe, smiling through her tears. "Yes, it was he
  indeed. No one else has that ex&shy;traordinary power of defying every
  torment. Now he is lying half-dead on his bed; his whole back is one dreadful
  wound, and yet not a complaint, not a word of reproach! Fortunately the
  gate-keeper is my very good friend. He sent me a message; otherwise very
  likely Eurymachus might have died in his misery, without my knowing it. But I
  hope, I hope the charm may save him."</p>

  <p>"Listen, child," said Quintus after a pause: "You shall see, that I know
  how to value courage, even in the person of a slave. Here, take this gold and
  spend it for the benefit of the sufferer, and by and bye, when he is well
  again, write to me in Rome; then we "will see what can be done next,"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lord!" cried the flute-player vehemently, "you are like the gods
  for graciousness and kindness. Do I understand rightly, that we may hope from
  your goodness..."</p>

  <p>"Understand all you please," interrupted the youth kindly. "The chief
  point is, that you should remind me of it at the right moment. In Rome a man
  forgets his nearest relations."</p>

  <p>"I will remind you," said Euterpe, radiant. "Sooner should I forget to eat
  and drink. About the middle of next month I am going to the capital with
  Diphilus, my husband. He is a master-carpenter, and will have work to do on
  the grand erections for the Centenary Festival. If you will allow me, I will
  myself remind you in person."</p>

  <p>"Do so, Euterpe."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lord! I thank you from the bottom of my heart. The man who is
  protected by Quintus Claudius, is as safe as a child in its cradle."</p>

  <p>Joy lent so sweet an expression to the young crea&shy;ture's face, that
  Quintus was irresistibly moved to stroke her cheek, and in the excess of her
  delight she submitted to the caress, though, as we know, she had vowed
  hence&shy;forth to give Diphilus no cause for complaint.</p>

  <p>At this moment a magnificent litter, borne by eight gigantic negroes,
  appeared on the highest level of the road. It was escorted by four
  men-at-arms, and in it, leaning on the purple cushions and only half-veiled,
  re&shy;clined Domitia. The seething fever of her passion and anger had driven
  her to seek the air soon after midnight, and for hours the slaves had to
  carry her about the wooded ravines of the landward side of the hills, or
  along the deserted roads, until, wearied out at last, she was fain to turn
  homewards. Quintus, somewhat abashed, withdrew to one side; not so quickly,
  however, but that Domitia had observed his light caress of Euterpe. She
  turned pale and looked away. The young man, who made ready to bow to the
  Empress, remained unnoticed, and Euterpe stood as if turned to stone.</p>

  <p>Quintus looked coolly after her as she was borne away, and shrugged his
  shoulders; then he took Euterpe by the hand.</p>

  <p>"It is a bargain then," he said in distinct tones. "You will find me in
  Rome! Now, farewell till we meet again."</p>

  <p>He turned towards home; sea and sunrise were alike forgotten. Euterpe
  hurried down to Cumae, and disap&shy;peared behind the ridge at the same
  instant as the Em&shy;press within the Corinthian portico of the palace.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the Claudia family were sitting in the triclinium to take
  a slight breakfast before starting. Octavia was thoughtful; her husband's
  letter had made her anxious. She knew how stern a view Titus Claudius took of
  his duties, and how much would devolve upon him in these agitated times.
  Claudia too was graver than usual. Only Aurelius and Lucilia looked bright
  and contented. Lucilia, warm and rosy from her busy exer&shy;tions in the
  court- yard and atrium and in her excite&shy;ment she would not give herself
  time to do more than drink a cup of milk and swallow a morsel of
  sesame-cake.<a href="#121">121</a></p>

  <p>The respectable Herodianus too, against his custom, was silent. What could
  be so absorbing to that simple and garrulous nature? From time to time he
  frowned and stared at the ceiling, moving his lips in silent speech like a
  priest of the Pythian oracle. The honey, generally his favorite
  dainty&mdash;he left untouched; the egg he was about to empty with a
  spoon<a href="#122">122</a> broke under his fingers. Aurelius was on the
  point of taking the matter seriously, when the mystery found a natural
  solution. When, presently, Blepyrus appeared to announce that it was time to
  start, the ponderous ponderer rose, went to the door, and began to exclaim
  with terrible pathos a valedictory poem of his own composition. It was based
  on the model of the world-renowned Hymenaeus 123 of Catullus; 124 and its
  climax was the most extravagant refrain, that the Muse of occasional verse
  ever hatched in mortal brain.</p>

  <p>For a few minutes the party listened in respectful silence to the cadences
  of this solemn effusion; but as it went on and on, apparently endless,
  Lucilia, who from the first had had great difficulty in keeping countenance,
  broke into a fit of laughter, and Aurelius good-naturedly put a stop to the
  freedman's recitation.</p>

  <p>"I mean no offence, my excellent Herodianus; but though poetry is said to
  be the mirror of reality, it must not interfere too much with the progress of
  real events. Twelve times already have you resolutely asserted: 'Far must we
  wander, far from hence!' but our feet are still rooted to the spot. You may
  give us the rest of your poem on board the vessel, but for the present make
  way and take this ring as the prize for your effusion."</p>

  <p>Herodianus, who had at first been half inclined to take the interruption
  in ill-part, felt himself fully indem&shy;nified by his master's gift, but
  his gaze lingered for a while in silent protest on Lucilia. However, he
  presently joined the rest of the party, who were mounting their horses or
  settling themselves in litters, and soon they were all fairly in motion.</p>

  <p>They went down the hill in a long file. Baiae, now in full sunshine,
  seemed to nestle in a golden shell; the sea was as smooth as a mirror, and
  the clear atmosphere promised a prosperous voyage. They soon reached the
  stone quay, where the motley crowd of the harbor was already at high tide of
  noise and bustle. There lay the proud trireme before their surprised eyes,
  gaily dressed out like a bride waiting for the bridegroom. Long gar&shy;lands
  of flowers floated from the spars, tied with purple knots and blue streamers;
  magnificent carpets from Al&shy;exandria and Massilia hung from the poop, and
  the crew were all dressed in holiday garments. When they had got into the
  boats and were fast approaching the vessel, strains of music were heard
  greeting the visitors. Claudia colored deeply; she recognized her own
  song&mdash;that im&shy;passioned address to the Spring, which she had sung
  the first evening in the peristyle.</p>

  <p>In ten minutes the Batavia had weighed anchor and was being rowed in
  majestic style past the quays and mole. Quintus, Claudia and Lucilia leaned
  silently over the side, while Aurelius sat under the awning with
  Oc&shy;tavia, talking of Rome. Beautiful Baiae sank farther and farther into
  the background with all its palaces and temples. Still, above the trees, a
  corner of the snug villa they had left was visible, and to the left Domitia's
  palace. Then the vessel shifted its course, and the shin&shy;ing speck grew
  smaller and smaller till it was lost to sight.</p>

  <p>Claudia wiped away a stealing tear, while Lucilia in a clear, ringing
  voice shouted across the waters:</p>

  <p>"Farewell, lovely Baiae!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p>THE house of Titus Claudius Mucianus, the high&shy;priest of Jupiter,
  stood at no great distance from the precipitous Capitoline Hill,<a href=
  "#125">125</a> looking over the Forum Ro&shy;manum<a href="#126">126</a> and
  the Sacred Way.<a href="#127">127</a> Simple and yet magnificent, it showed
  in every detail the stamp of that quiet, self-sufficing and confident wealth,
  that ease of distinc&shy;tion, which is so unattainable to the
  <i>parvenu</i>.</p>

  <p>It was now October. The sun was just appearing above the horizon. There
  was a motley turmoil in the house of the Flamen; the vast atrium positively
  swarmed with men. Most of these were professional morning
  visitors&mdash;waiters in the ante-chamber&mdash;known also from the gala
  dress in which they were expected to ap&shy;pear, as "Toga-wearers;" the poor
  relations of the house, clients and proteg&eacute;s.<a href="#128">128</a>
  Still, there were among them not a few persons of distinction, members of the
  senate and upper-class, court officials and magistrates. It was a scene of
  indescribable variety and bustle. The world of Rome in miniature. Petitioners
  from every point of the compass eagerly watched the slaves, on whom their
  ad&shy;mission depended. Rich farmers, who desired to bring a private
  offering to Jupiter Capitolinus, sat open&shy;mouthed on the cushioned marble
  seats, gaping at the handsomely-dressed servants or the splendid
  wall-paint&shy;ings and statues. Young knights from the provinces, whose
  ambition it was to be Tribune of a legion,<a href="#129">129</a> or to obtain
  some other honorable appointment, and who hoped for the high-priest's
  protection, gazed with deep admiration at the endless series of ancestral
  images<a href="#130">130</a> in wax, which adorned the hall in shrines of
  ebony.</p>

  <p>And in fact these portraits were well worthy of study, for they were an
  epitome of a portion of the history of the world. Those stern, inexorable
  features were those of Appius Claudius Sabinus, who, as consul, wreaked such
  fearful justice on his troops. Beside him stood his brother, the haughty
  patrician, Caius Claudius, knitting his thick brows&mdash;an embodiment of
  the protest of the nobles against the rights contended for by the popular
  party. There was the keen, eagle face of the infamous Decemvir, the
  persecutor of Virginia&mdash;a villain, but a daring and imperious villain.
  Claudius Crassus, the cruel, resolute foe of the plebeians&mdash;Appius
  Claudius Caecus, who made the Appian Way&mdash;Claudius Pulcher, the witty
  sceptic, who flung the sacred fowls into the sea because they warned him of
  evil&mdash;Claudius Cento, the conqueror of Chalcis&mdash;Claudius Caesar,
  and a hundred other world-renowned names of old and modern times... What an
  endless chain! And just as they now looked down, head beyond head from their
  frames, they had been, all without exception, stiff-necked contemners of the
  people, and staunch defenders of their senatorial privileges. A splendid,
  defiant and famous race! Even the tattooed native of Britain,<a href=
  "#131">131</a> who came to offer fine amber chains<a href="#132">132</a> and
  broken rings of gold,<a href="#133">133</a> was sensible of an atmosphere of
  historic greatness.</p>

  <p>One after another&mdash;the humbler folks in parties
  to&shy;gether&mdash;the visitors were led from the atrium into the carpeted
  reception-room, where the master of the house stood to welcome them in robes
  of dazzling white&shy;ness<a href="#134">134</a> and wearing his priestly
  head- gear.<a href="#135">135</a> He had already dismissed a considerable
  number of impor&shy;tant personages, when a tall officer, stout almost to
  clumsiness, was announced and at once admitted, inter&shy;rupting as he did
  the strict order of succession. This was no less a person than Clodianus, the
  adjutant of Caesar himself. He came in noisily, embraced and kissed the
  priest and then, glancing round at the slaves, asked if he might be allowed a
  few words with Titus Claudius in private. The priest gave a sign; the slaves
  withdrew into a side room.</p>

  <p>"There is no end to it all!" cried Clodianus, throw&shy;ing himself into a
  large arm-chair. "Every day brings some fresh annoyance!"</p>

  <p>"What am I to hear now?" sighed the high-priest.</p>

  <p>"Oh! this time it has nothing to do with the out&shy;break among the
  Nazarenes and all the troubles of these last weeks. We can detect here and
  there extraordinary symptoms, and fabulous rumors... for instance... but,
  your word of honor that you will be silent!"</p>

  <p>"Can you doubt it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, for instance, it sounds incredible... but Par&shy;thenius<a href=
  "#136">136</a> brought it all from Lycoris the fair Gaul... It is said that
  this Nazarene craze has seized the very highest personages... They even
  name..."</p>

  <p>He stopped and looked round the room, as if he feared to be overheard.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said the high-priest.</p>

  <p>"They name Titus Flavius Clemens,<a href="#137">137</a> the Consul..."</p>

  <p>"Folly! a relation of Caesar's. The man who spreads such a report should
  be found out and brought to condign punishment..."</p>

  <p>"Folly! that is what I said too! Infernal nonsense . Still the story is
  characteristic, and proves what the people conceive of as possible..."</p>

  <p>"Patience, patience, noble Clodianus! Things will alter as winter
  approaches. The wildest torrent may be dammed up. But we are
  digressing&mdash;what new annoyance?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! to be sure," interrupted Clodianus. "Then nothing of it has reached
  your ears?"</p>

  <p>"No one has mentioned anything to me."</p>

  <p>"They dare not."</p>

  <p>And why?"</p>

  <p>"Because your views are well known. They know that you hate the
  populace&mdash;and the populace yester&shy;day achieved a triumph."</p>

  <p>"And in what way?" asked Claudius frowning.</p>

  <p>"In the circus.<a href="#138">138</a> I can tell you, my respected friend,
  it was a frightful scandal, a real storm in minature! Caesar turned
  pale&mdash;nay he trembled."</p>

  <p>"Trembled!" cried Claudius indignantly.</p>

  <p>"With rage of course," said Clodianus in palliation. "The thing occurred
  thus. One of the charioteers<a href="#139">139</a> of the new
  party&mdash;those that wear purple&mdash;drove so magnificently, that Caesar
  was almost beside himself with delight. By Epona, the tutelary goddess of
  horses!<a href="#140">140</a> but the fellow drove four horses that cannot be
  matched in the whole world. Incitatus,<a href="#141">141</a> old Caligula's
  charger, was an ass in comparison, and the names of those splendid steeds are
  in every one's mouth to-day like a proverb: Andraemon, Adsertor, Vastator and
  Passerinus<a href="#142">142</a>&mdash;you hear them in every market and
  alley; our poets might almost be envious. And the charioteer too, a free
  Greek in the service of Parthenius the head cham&shy;berlain, is a splendid
  fellow. He stood in his quadriga<a href="#143">143</a> like Ares rushing into
  battle. In short it was a stupend&shy;ous sight, and then he was so far ahead
  of the rest I tell you, no one has won by so great a length since Rome was a
  city. Scorpus<a href="#144">144</a> is the rascal's name. Everyone was fairly
  carried away. Caesar, the senators, the knights&mdash;all clapped till their
  hands were sore. Even strangers, the watery-eyed Sarmatians<a href=
  "#145">145</a> and Hyperboreans<a href="#146">146</a> shouted with
  delight."</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Titus Claudius, as the narrator paused.</p>

  <p>"To be sure&mdash;the chief point. Well, it was known that Caesar would
  himself grant the winner some per&shy;sonal favor, and every one gazed at the
  imperial tribune in the greatest excitement. Caesar ordered the herald to
  command silence. 'Scorpus,' said he, when the up&shy;roar was lulled, 'you
  have covered yourself with glory. Ask a favor of me,' and Scorpus bowed his
  head and demanded in a firm voice, that Domitian should be re&shy;conciled to
  his wife."</p>

  <p>"Audacious!" cried Titus Claudius wrathfully.</p>

  <p>"There is better still to come. Hardly had the charioteer spoken, when a
  thousand voices shouted from every bench: 'Dost thou hear, oh Caesar? Leave
  thy intrigue with Julia!<a href="#147">147</a> We want Domitia!' There was
  quite a tumult,<a href="#148">148</a> a scandalous scene that defies
  descrip&shy;tion."</p>

  <p>"But what do the people mean? What has so suddenly brought them to make
  this demand?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Clodianus, "I see through the farce. The whole thing is merely
  a trick on the part of Stephanus, Domitia's steward. That sly fox wants to
  regain for his mistress her lost influence. Of course he bribed Scorpus, and
  the gods alone know how many hundred thousand sesterces the game must have
  cost him. The spectators' seats were filled on all sides with bribed
  wretches, and even among the better classes I saw some who looked to me
  suspicious."</p>

  <p>"This is bad news," interrupted the high-priest, "&mdash;And what answer
  did Domitian give the people?"</p>

  <p>"I am almost afraid to tell you of his decision."</p>

  <p>"His decision could not be doubtful, I should sup&shy;pose. By giving
  Scorpus leave to ask what he would, he pledged himself to grant his prayer.
  But how did he punish the howling mob that stormed around him? I too regret
  our sovereign's connection with his niece, but what gives the populace the
  right to interfere in such matters?"</p>

  <p>"You know," replied the other, "how tenderly these theatre and circus
  demonstrations have always been dealt with. Domitian, too, thought it prudent
  to smother his just anger and to show clemency. When the herald had once more
  restored order, Caesar said in a loud voice: 'Granted,' and left his seat.
  But he was deeply vexed, noble Claudius."</p>

  <p>"Well and then?" asked the Flamen in anxious suspense.</p>

  <p>"Well, the matter is so far carried out, that in the secretary's<a href=
  "#149">149</a> room to-day an imperial decree was drawn up, calling upon
  Domitia<a href="#150">150</a> to return to her rooms on the Palatine, and
  granting her pardon for all pasl offences."</p>

  <p>"And Julia?"</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" laughed Clodianus. "With regard to Julia, Caesar made no
  promises."<a href="#151">151</a></p>

  <p>"Then I greatly fear, that this reconciliation will only prove the germ of
  farther complications."</p>

  <p>"Very possibly. It has been the source of annoy&shy;ance enough to me
  personally. Caesar is in the worst of humors. Do what you can to soothe him,
  noble Clau&shy;dius. We all suffer under it..."</p>

  <p>"I will do all I can," said the priest with a sigh. Clodianus noisily
  pushed back his chair. "Domitian is waiting for me," he said as he jumped up.
  "Farewell, my illustrious friend. What times we live in now! How different
  things were only three or four years ago!"</p>

  <p>Claudius escorted him to the door with cool formal&shy;ity. The slaves and
  freedmen now came back again into the room, and ranged themselves silently in
  the background, and the "<i>nomenclator</i>" the "namer," whose duty it was
  to introduce unknown visitors, came at once to Claudius and said
  hesitatingly:</p>

  <p>"My lord, your son Quintus is waiting in the atrium and craves to be
  admitted."</p>

  <p>A shade of vexation clouded the high-priest's brow.</p>

  <p>"My son must wait," he said decisively; " Quintus knows full well, that
  these morning hours belong neither to myself nor to my family."</p>

  <p>And Quintus, the proud, spoilt and wilful Quintus, was forced to have
  patience. The Flamen went on calmly receiving his numerous friends, clients
  and petitioners, who retired from his presence cheerful or hanging their
  heads, according as they had met with a favorable or an unfavorable
  reception. Not till the last had vanished was his son admitted to see
  him.</p>

  <p>Quintus had meanwhile conquered his annoyance at the delay he had been
  compelled to brook, and offered his father his hand with an affectionate
  gesture; but Titus Claudius took no notice of his son's advances.</p>

  <p>"You are unusually early," he observed in icy tones, "or perhaps you are
  but just returning from some cheer&shy;ful
  entertainment&mdash;so-called."</p>

  <p>"That is the case," replied Quintus coolly. "I have been at the house of
  Lucius Norbanus, the prefect of the body-guard. The noble Aurelius was also
  there," he added with an ironical smile. "Our excellent friend Aurelius."</p>

  <p>"Do you think to excuse yourself by casting reflec&shy;tions on another?
  If Aurelius shares your dissipation once or twice a month, I have no
  objections to raise&mdash;I have no wish to deny the right of youth to its
  pleasures. But you, my son, have made a rule of what ought to be the
  exception. Since your return from Baiae, you have led a life which is a
  disgrace alike to yourself and to me."</p>

  <p>Quintus looked at the floor. His respect and his de&shy;fiant temper were
  evidently fighting a hard battle.</p>

  <p>"You paint it too black, father," he said at last, in a trembling voice.
  "I enjoy my life&mdash;perhaps too wildly; but I do nothing that can disgrace
  you or myself. Your words are too hard, father."</p>

  <p>"Well then, I will allow that much; but you, on your part, must allow that
  the son of the high-priest is to be measured by another standard than the
  other youths of your own rank."</p>

  <p>"It might be so, if I lived under the same roof with you. But since I am
  independent and master of my own fortune..."</p>

  <p>"Aye, and that is your misfortune," the priest inter&shy;rupted. "Enough,
  you know my opinion. However, that which caused me to require your presence
  here to&shy;day, was not your course of life in general. A particular
  instance of incredible folly has come to my ears; you are playing a wicked
  and dangerous game, and I sent for you to warn you."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, father, you excite my curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Your curiosity shall at once be satisfied. Is it true that you have been
  so rash, so audacious, as to address love-songs to Polyhymnia, the Vestal
  maiden?" <i>152</i></p>

  <p>Quintus bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "and no. Yes, if you consider the superscription of the
  verses. No, if you imagine that the poem ever reached her hands."</p>

  <p>The priest paced the room with wide strides.</p>

  <p>"Quintus," he said suddenly: "Do you know what punishment is inflicted on
  the wretch, who tempts a Ves&shy;tal virgin to break her vows?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"You know it!" said the priest with a groan.</p>

  <p>"But father," said Quintus eagerly: "You are branding a jest as a crime.
  In a merry mood, inspired by wine, I composed a poem in the style of
  Catullus, and to complete the audacity of it, instead of the name of Lycoris,
  I placed at the beginning that of our highly&shy;revered Polyhymnia. And now
  report says&mdash;Pah! it is ridiculous! I grant you it was impudent,
  unbecom&shy;ing, in the very worst taste if you will, but not calumny itself
  can say worse of it than that."</p>

  <p>"Well, it certainly sounds less scandalous from that point of view.
  Quintus, I warn you. Now, if at any time, be on your guard against any deed,
  any expression, which may be construed as an insult to the religion of the
  state! Do not trust too much to the influence of my position or of my
  individuality. The law is mightier than the will of any one man. When what we
  are now planning takes form and life, severity, inexorable as iron, will
  decide in all such questions. That reckless jest sprang from a mind, which no
  longer holds dear the eter&shy;nal truths of religion. Beware, Quintus, and
  conceal this indifference; do not come forward as a contemner of the gods.
  Once more I warn you."</p>

  <p>"Father "</p>

  <p>"Go now, my son, and ponder on what I have said."</p>

  <p>Quintus bowed and kissed the stern man's hand. Then he left the room with
  a quick, firm step, and a look of devoted love, of passionate paternal pride
  fol&shy;lowed him as he crossed the room, so tall, lovely and handsome.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p>LYCORIS, the fair Gaul, was giving a splendid enter&shy;tainment. Valerius
  Martialis, the greatest wit of the city of the Seven Hills, had recited his
  newest and most poignant epigrams with loud applause, and the
  company&mdash;more than a hundred persons&mdash;were reclining at sup&shy;per
  on cushioned divans in the lavishly-decorated eating&shy;room. The young
  Massilian lady presided. With her neck and shoulders half-veiled in
  transparent gauze<a href="#153">153</a> from Cos, her magnificent
  golden-yellow hair knotted up at the back of her head and wreathed simply
  with ivy, she smiled radiantly from the head of the table, the object of
  silent worship to many, and of eager admiration to all. A number of slaves,
  in handsome Alexandrian dresses, moved quickly and silently about the
  handsome hall, while across the supper table the conversation each instant
  grew more lively.</p>

  <p>Among the guests was Caius Aurelius, the young Batavian. He had yielded to
  the pressure of curiosity or of fashion&mdash;particularly when the name of
  the famous epigrammatist had weighed down the scale.</p>

  <p>"Really," he was saying to his neighbor Norbanus&mdash;the commandant of
  the Praetorian Guard&mdash;"really, Norbanus, till this hour I had esteemed
  myself rich, but here I feel by comparison a beggar. What splendor, what
  lavish outlay! Pillars of alabaster, enormous gold plates,<a href=
  "#154">154</a> carpets worth an estate&mdash;my senses reel. Everything which
  elsewhere would appear rare and choice is here in every day use. By Hermes!
  but the father of Lycoris must have been a favorite of fortune."</p>

  <p>"Not so loud!" interrupted Lucius Norbanus. "See, Stephanus is looking
  this way with a meaning glance."</p>

  <p>"Stephanus!<a href="#155">155</a> The Empress's steward? What has he to do
  with Lycoris?"</p>

  <p>"Ha! well, I will tell you that another time," said the officer filling
  his mouth with a fine oyster,<a href="#156">156</a> "between ourselves, you
  know. Meanwhile, I strongly advise you to taste those delicious mollusks. If
  you are like me, laughing has made you ferociously hungry."</p>

  <p>"You certainly laughed most heartily," replied Aurelius accepting some of
  the praised dish from a slave; "but I, for my part, cannot get up any taste
  for this kind of verse. Martial is full of wit and humor, but this perpetual
  mockery, this making a business of holding up all society to ridicule and
  contempt&mdash;no, my dear Nor&shy;banus, I cannot like it. More particularly
  does the way in which he speaks of women displease and vex me. If he is to be
  believed, there is not in all Rome one faithful wife, or one innocent
  girl."<a href="#157">157</a></p>

  <p>"Pah!" said Norbanus, with his mouth well filled: "There are some of
  course, but they are scarce, my dear Aurelius, remarkably scarce."</p>

  <p>"What is amusing you so much, Norbanus?" asked Quintus from his place
  opposite.</p>

  <p>"The old theme&mdash;women! Aurelius thinks, that our laurel-wreathed poet
  has sinned basely against the ladies of Rome, by hinting in his epigrams his
  doubts of their virtue."</p>

  <p>"Who? What?" cried the poet himself, hastily look, ing round. "What
  Ravidus<a href="#158">158</a> is here, to take up the cudgels against my
  iambics?"</p>

  <p>This quotation from Catullus, the favorite poet and model of the
  epigrammatist, did not fail of its point, for every one, with the single
  exception of the blushing Aurelius, was reminded by it that Ravidus was, in
  that passage, called a "crazed and witless wretch."</p>

  <p>"It was I," said Aurelius coolly. "But it was not your verse that I
  criticised, but... however, you heard. If a woman is no more to you than the
  beetle, the snake that wriggles in the dust, I can but pity your
  experience."</p>

  <p>"Yours then has been more fortunate?" laughed Martial.</p>

  <p>"I should hope so, indeed!"</p>

  <p>Lycoris, who, though at some distance, must have heard every word, was
  chatting vehemently with Stephanus, her neighbor on her left, who kept his
  gaze alert, though with an air of reserve and dignity. Two of her companions,
  pretty but by no means maidenly personages, stared contemptuously at Aurelius
  as if to say: "Well, what a booby!"</p>

  <p>"Here is to your health, worthy Cato of the North!" cried Martial
  mockingly. "Reveal his name to me, O Muse! and I will dedicate to you five
  and twenty epi&shy;grams on his virtue."</p>

  <p>"He has a sharp muzzle," muttered Norbanus to Aurelius. "You will get the
  worst of it."</p>

  <p>"No doubt of that," said Aurelius. "Fencing with words was never my strong
  ground."</p>

  <p>"Just my case; and I cannot stand his accursed ribaldry. These fellows are
  like eels, it is impossible to hold them. It is the city tone, my dear
  friend! Our Stephanus now&mdash;only see how the man is made up&mdash;now,
  full in the light. By Castor! he is touched up and painted like a
  wench&mdash;Stephanus again, is a master in the war of words. But he gives
  you a pebble for a gem; everything about him is false, even his hair. But
  beware of him; he will try to make mince-meat of you."</p>

  <p>"I say, Martial," said a harsh voice: "Who is going to publish the
  epigrams you gave us to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I do not yet know. Possibly Tryphon."<a href="#159">159</a></p>

  <p>"And when, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"Well, in the course of the month."</p>

  <p>"So soon? Listen, when the book comes out, may I send to you to borrow a
  copy?"</p>

  <p>"You are too kind, my dear Lupercus; but why should you give yourself and
  a slave so much trouble? I live quite high up on the Quirinal.<a href=
  "#160">160</a> You can get what you want much nearer to you. You pass every
  day by the Argiletum. There you will find a very interesting shop, exactly
  opposite the Forum of Caesar. Atrectus, the bookseller, will feel himself
  honored in selecting a beautiful copy for you&mdash;almost given away too, as
  I may say, for with purple letters and smoothly pumiced it costs but five or
  six denarii."<a href="#161">161</a></p>

  <p>"Six denarii!" exclaimed Lupercus. "That is too dear for me. I have to be
  saving with my money."</p>

  <p>"And I must be saving with my books."</p>

  <p>"It is not every one, who knows how to be obliging!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, do not give up all hope," retorted the epi&shy;grammatist
  scornfully. "Make your wants known at all the street-corners,<a href=
  "#162">162</a> and perhaps some costermonger<a href="#163">163</a> will lend
  you a copy."</p>

  <p>"Why is Martial so hard upon him?" asked Aurelius of the Praetorian
  Guardsman. "This Lupercus seems to be in narrow circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Norbanus. "With an income of two hundred thousand
  sesterces..."</p>

  <p>"Impossible! how can a man be at once so rich and so mean?"</p>

  <p>"You are in Rome, Aurelius&mdash;do not forget that you are in Rome. Here
  extremes meet; here everything is possible, even the impossible."</p>

  <p>It was now growing dusk, and in a few minutes hun&shy;dreds of costly
  bronze lamps were lighted, some hang* ing in candelabra from the ceiling,
  some elegantly arranged round the pilasters and columns. Indeed it was not
  till this moment, that the banquet really assumed the aspect intended by the
  artistic and extravagant im&shy;agination of the hostess. The beaten silver
  of the mas&shy;sive bowls<a href="#164">164</a> and platters gleamed brightly
  under the wreaths of flowers and garlands of foliage, while the huge
  wine-jars and costly Murrhine vases,<a href="#165">165</a> the jovial and
  purpled faces of the guests, the splendid dresses, the pearls and
  gems&mdash;all were doubly effective under the artificial light.</p>

  <p>One costly delicacy was followed by another; all the productions of the
  remotest ends of the earth met at the banquet of Lycoris. Fish from the
  Atlantic ocean, Muraenae from Lake Lucrinus, Guinea-fowls from
  Nu&shy;midia,<a href="#166">166</a> young kids from the province of
  Thesprotis<a href="#167">l67</a> in Epirus, pheasants from the Caspian
  Sea,<a href="#168">168</a> Egyptian dates,<a href="#169">169</a> dainty cakes
  from Picenum,<a href="#170">170</a> figs from Chios,<a href="#171">171</a>
  pistachio nuts<a href="#172">172</a> from Palestine&mdash;were all here of
  the choicest quality and elaborately prepared. Euphemus,<a href=
  "#173">173</a> Caesar's own head-cook, could have done no more. Nor could
  anything be more perfect, than the grace with which the handsomely-dressed
  slaves offered each dainty on long slices of bread. After each dish had gone
  round, little boys with wings brought in magnificent onyx jars filled with
  perfumed water, which they poured over the hands of the guests. The long
  flowing hair of a female slave<a href="#174">174</a> served to dry them, in
  the place of the more usual linen or asbestos napkin. In such trifles as
  these Lycoris loved to be original.</p>

  <p>During the meal an intermezzo had now and then interrupted the eager
  conversation. Black-haired girls from Gades and Hispalis<a href=
  "#175">175</a> had come in, dancing to the cadence of castanets<a href=
  "#176">176</a> and cymbals; flute-players, singers and reciters had given
  highly-applauded evi&shy;dence of their talents. But now, when the business
  of eating was over and the <i>commissatio</i>, as it was called, the drinking
  in short, was about to begin, as was hinted by the distribution to the guests
  of fresh wreaths and of perfumed oils, a buffoon or jester<a href=
  "#177">177</a> made his appearance, and soon filled the hall with Homeric
  laughter. His small and muscular form was clothed in gaily-colored scraps of
  raiment, and his face was painted in strong colors. Entering the room with a
  hop, skip and jump, he performed a series of somersaults with great skill;
  then leaping high over the guests' heads, actually on to the table, he placed
  himself in front of Lycoris and began thus in a high, shrill voice:</p>

  <p>"Highly-esteemed friends of this illustrious house, now that your empty
  stomachs are duly replenished your minds too are to be no less delightfully
  satisfied. 1 offer you the feast of self-knowledge; to each one of you here I
  will shortly and plainly tell your fortune. If I appear to you over-bold,
  attribute it to the functions of my office; for audacity is my vocation, as
  it is that of the most honored Martial."</p>

  <p>A storm of applause rang through the banqueting&shy;hall, and Martial
  himself even laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"Capital, capital!" he exclaimed to the little man. "Your beginning is
  admirable and promises much," and he stroked his grizzled beard with much
  complacency; the jester bowed and went on with his privileged
  imper&shy;tinences. He flung some epigrammatic and pointed remark at one and
  another of the company, and was each time rewarded by more or less eager
  applause. When he came round to the young provincial, he grinned with vicious
  impudence.</p>

  <p>"Oh, noble vestal virgin!" he exclaimed, holding his hand before his face
  in affected coyness. "How much a hundred weight does propriety cost in
  Trajectum?"</p>

  <p>His former jests had been happier and more pointed, but not one had been
  so readily taken; the company laughed so immoderately, that the buffoon had
  some difficulty in making himself heard again. Aurelius, though he was
  disgusted with the fellow, had discretion and tact enough not to draw
  attention to himself; he laughed and applauded as heartily as any one. Not
  so, however, Herodianus, his freedman, who reclined at the lower end of the
  table and had given himself up to silent and unlimited enjoyment of the
  Caecubum.</p>

  <p>"What, you foul-mouthed scoundrel!" he exclaimed in a voice of thunder.
  "Who are you scoffing at? My dear friend Aurelius compared to a woman! Go
  home, and let your mother teach you manners."</p>

  <p>The company were in so jovial a mood, that they at once turned this
  interference into account. When the Batavian was about to reprove Herodianus,
  he was talked down, while the indignant freedman was spurred on by half-
  ironical appeals and challenges.</p>

  <p>"Let him alone," said the captain of the guard: "He will serve the
  jester's turn well enough."</p>

  <p>"Aye, that he will!" exclaimed another. "Only look at him knitting his
  brows. Is not he just like the Silenus in Stephanus' dining-hall?"</p>

  <p>"Just be so good as to hold your tongues," cried Quintus, who had been
  excessively amused by Herodi&shy;anus' pugnacity. "The little man on the
  table is going to answer him."</p>

  <p>"Silence for the jester!" shouted a chorus.</p>

  <p>The buffoon stood still with his hand up to his ear.</p>

  <p>"Did I not hear a pug-dog barking?" he said with inimitable comic gravity.
  "Yes, there he lies, a Mal&shy;tese pug! Come, Lailaps, come I Here are
  Lucanian sausages!"</p>

  <p>Looking impartially at the freedman's face, it was impossible to deny that
  the resemblance was well hit, but Herodianus could hardly be expected to take
  this unprejudiced view of the matter. Forgetting where and with whom he was,
  he sprang from his couch, struck his fist on the table, and shouted out,
  crimson with rage:</p>

  <p>"Come on, you braggart, if you dare! I will teach you, I will show you
  that... that... By Hercules! if you do not jump down this minute, you are the
  most cowardly, contemptible toad under the sun."</p>

  <p>The little man sprang like lightning over Stephanus' head on to the floor,
  turned up the sleeves of his parti&shy;colored shirt and shouted in
  mockery:</p>

  <p>"Come on, Lailaps, come on! I will give you a thrashing."</p>

  <p>For a moment Herodianus seemed to hesitate; then he suddenly flew at the
  jester like the storm of wind suggested by his Greek dog-name. The jester,
  however, slipped on one side as quick as lightning, and Herodi&shy;anus, who,
  indeed, was not very steady on his feet, fell at full-length on the floor. In
  an instant the buffoon was sitting astride on his back.</p>

  <p>"Pug, you are snappish!" he exclaimed in a trium&shy;phant tone, and he
  began vigorously to belabor every part of the hapless freedman, that he could
  reach with his powerful fists.</p>

  <p>"The dog must be broken!" he exclaimed at each blow. "Quiet, Lailaps,
  down, my noble cur!"</p>

  <p>Herodianus, who, besides, had in falling damaged his knees and elbows,
  roared like one possessed; in vain did he try to throw off his tormentor. The
  dwarf clung to him tightly with his legs. The whole scene was as irresistibly
  comical as though it had been planned for the delectation of a blase" and
  overwrought party of drinkers. But Aurelius could no longer contain himself;
  he rose and went up to the combatants with well-as&shy;sumed coolness.</p>

  <p>"You are going too far," he said. "Be off with you, you little
  rascal."</p>

  <p>The jester paying no heed to these orders, found himself suddenly picked
  up by the girdle and with one effort lifted high into the air. His struggles
  and yells were of no avail; Aurelius carried him like a feather to the table,
  and there set him down among the cups and wine-jars. The strength and
  promptness of the pro&shy;ceeding diverted it of any vexatious interference;
  the dwarf, completely quelled, stood on the table like a stork that has had
  its wings cut, looking round half-frightened and half-angry. The young
  Northman's grip had fairly taken his breath away, and a sign from Lycoris
  that he might withdraw was evidently welcome to him. He vanished between the
  crowd of slaves like a startled deer.</p>

  <p>Aurelius had hastened to the rescue of Herodianus, who now, having been
  helped on his feet by some of the servants, found the greatest difficulty in
  keeping on them.</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow!" he said kindly. "But you are really quite
  incorrigible."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lord!" groaned Herodianus, "it was only on account of the Vestal
  virgin! I should not have cared about being called a pug! Oh ye gods! my
  knees."</p>

  <p>"I will take you in my litter. My own head aches, till it might
  split."</p>

  <p>"What! are you going?" said Quintus Claudius, coming up to him. "Do you
  not know that Lycoris has planned a magnificent surprise for her guests?"</p>

  <p>"I know it, but I must beg to be excused. These sports are not to my
  taste. Farewell till we meet again."</p>

  <p>So speaking, he beckoned his Gothic slave, who took the limping freedman
  round the body and held him up with his usual strength of arm. The pair went
  first, and Aurelius followed them. All the company had by this time left
  their places, so his disappearance was almost unremarked; but the fair
  hostess kept her eye fixed on him, till she lost sight of her ungracious
  guest in the throng. Then, with an insidious smile, she turned to Quintus,
  laid her hand on his shoulder, and whispered maliciously: "What sort of
  foolish philosopher is that who comes here, of all places, to plead the cause
  of women and take up the cudgels for a freedman?"</p>

  <p>"Your foolish philosopher," replied Quintus, "is one of the noblest souls
  I ever knew, and beyond a doubt, the very noblest of the men who cross your
  threshold."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Lycoris, somewhat abashed. "Well, we shall have time by and
  bye to discuss this paragon of merit!" And with a coquettish toss of her head
  she turned from Quintus and mingled with the crowd of guests, who were now
  streaming out into the illuminated gardens.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p>OUTSIDE, under the branches of the elm and syca&shy;more-trees, which
  stretched in long avenues up the Vim&shy;inal and down again on the farthest
  side, an ingenious intendant had devised much such an entertainment as in our
  days would be given under corresponding circum&shy;stances. Thousands of
  colored lamps hung in long fes&shy;toons from tree to tree. The quaintly-
  clipped laurel and yew bushes, that stood between the six great avenues, were
  starred with semicircular lights, and the bronze and marble statues held
  torches and braziers of flame. The open space between the two centre avenues
  was screened by an immense curtain of purple stuff, which was fastened to two
  tall masts and waved mysteriously in the night air, casting strange
  reflections; to the right and left also a space was enclosed and screened
  from prying eyes by boards hung with tapestry.</p>

  <p>"This promises something delightful," said Clodianus, addressing Quintus
  for the first time during the evening. "She is a splendid creature, this
  Lycoris! Always ready to spend millions for the pleasure of her guests. Did
  you ever see handsomer hangings? Nero's enor&shy;mous velarium<a href=
  "#178">178</a> was not more costly."</p>

  <p>"Oh! gold is all-powerful!" Quintus said absently. "Listen," he went on,
  taking the officer on one side, "quite in confidence.&mdash;Is what I heard
  to- day at the baths of Titus<a href="#179">179</a> true?&mdash;that you had
  really been to Domitia?"</p>

  <p>"As you say."</p>

  <p>"It is true then?"</p>

  <p>"And why not? You know what happened in the Circus?"</p>

  <p>"Of course; but I thought..."</p>

  <p>"No, there was no help for it this time. I solemnly and formally offered
  her the hand of reconciliation in Caesar's name?"</p>

  <p>"And Domitia?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow she will return an answer to her husband's message; but, of
  course, she is only too ready."</p>

  <p>At this moment the fair Massilian came up to them.</p>

  <p>"Quintus, one word with you," she begged with an engaging smile. "You will
  excuse him, Clodianus?"</p>

  <p>The officer bowed.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Lycoris, as she drew Quintus away, u you must tell me all
  you can about your provincial friend. The man is unbearable with his
  strictness and sobriety, and yet there is something in him&mdash;how can I
  explain it?&mdash;something that is wanting in every one of you others
  without exception; a balance of mind, a steadfast certainty one may as well
  give in as soon as he opens his mouth."</p>

  <p>And as she spoke she laid her hand familiarly in the young man's arm.</p>

  <p>"Very true," he said coldly. "Aurelius is not much like those oiled and
  perfumed gallants, who think them&shy;selves happy to kiss the dust on your
  sandals. But that boy is waiting to speak to you."</p>

  <p>Lycoris looked round; a young slave, who had slowly followed her, glanced
  at her significantly.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "everything is ready."</p>

  <p>"Ah?" said the lady. "The actors are ready? Very good; then let the music
  begin."</p>

  <p>The slave bowed and vanished. Lycoris imperceptibly guided her companion
  into a thickly overgrown sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"We have time to spare," she said, "and the music sounds much better from
  here than up there from the terrace. What were we talking about?...oh! the
  Batavian... Why did you not bring your strange specimen to my house
  sooner?"</p>

  <p>"Because he has not long been in Rome."</p>

  <p>"In Rome..." repeated Lycoris vaguely. Her eyes were searching the
  shrubbery. Then, recollecting herself, she went on talking vivaciously. Thus
  the couple lost themselves farther and farther in the recesses of the garden;
  their conversation ceased, and they listened involuntarily to the Dionysiac
  hymn which reached them in softened tones from the distance. Out here even,
  in this remote alley, everything was festally illuminated; every leaf, every
  pebble in the path, shone in many&shy;colored hues. And yet, how deserted,
  how lonely it was, in spite of the lights! there was something uncanny and
  ghostly in their doubtful flicker and sparkle. Suddenly Lycoris stood
  still.</p>

  <p>"By the Styx!" she exclaimed. "I have lost my most valuable ring. Not two
  seconds since I saw it on my finger! Wait, you must have trodden on it; it
  cannot be twenty paces off and must be lying on the ground." Before Quintus
  fairly understood what had happened, she had vanished down a side path. The
  young man waited. "Lycoris!" he called out presently.</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>He went back to the turning&mdash;of Lycoris, not a sign.</p>

  <p>"This is strange!" thought he. "What can it mean?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stood stock-still, for in the middle of the path stood a
  girlish form, small, but well made and of the sweetest grace. She pressed her
  finger mysteriously to her rosebud lips, and then made unmistakable signs to
  the youth that he was to follow her.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Quintus, going up to her.</p>

  <p>"Above all things&mdash;silence," said the girl. "My errand is to you
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Speak on then."</p>

  <p>"Nay, not here, noble Quintus; consider a moment&mdash;with impenetrable
  hedges on each side of us! If any one came upon us, how could we escape?"</p>

  <p>"And who are you?" asked Quintus with a mean&shy;ing smile.</p>

  <p>"Only a slave&mdash;named Polycharma. Will you come with me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Polycharma, I follow you."</p>

  <p>About a hundred yards farther on a small circular clearing opened to their
  right; the entrance to it was decorated with gold-colored festoons. Just
  before reach&shy;ing this spot the path became so narrow, that a stout man
  could hardly pass along it; the wall of yew on each side had overgrown three-
  quarters of its width. Poly&shy;charma drew the folds of her dress more
  closely round her slim limbs, while the young man pushed aside the branches
  to the right and left. He looked round once more to see if he could discover
  Lycoris, but behind him all was silent and deserted. Even the sound of the
  music was only heard faintly and as if in a dream. Having reached the round
  plot, the slave girl took a let&shy;ter out of her bosom. "My lord," she
  said, "I must exact a solemn oath from you..."</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>"That you will keep my errand an absolute secret,, and return me this
  letter when you have read it."</p>

  <p>"Good, I swear it by Jupiter!"</p>

  <p>Polycharma handed him the note; the mere sight of it filled him with a
  suspicion of its origin. He hastily broke the seal and the silk thread, and
  by the light of the colored lamps which lighted the place, he read as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"She who is wont only to command, humbles herself to the
  dust&mdash;so terrible is the power of love to change us. The cruel wretch
  who scorns me&mdash;he is the god of my aspirations! Have pity, O Quintus!
  have pity on the miserable woman, who is dying of love for you. Caesar, my
  husband, holds out his hand to me in recon&shy;ciliation. It costs me but one
  word, and I shall be again, as I have been, the mistress of Rome and
  sovereign of the world. But behold, beloved Quintus, all this might and all
  this splendor I will cast from me and go into the remotest banishment without
  a tear, if you will give me, for one second only, the happy certainty of your
  love. Crush me, kill me, but ere you kill me say you are mine! Quintus, I
  await my sentence. At a sign, a glance, from you I reject all
  reconciliation."</p>

  <p>The young man was stunned; he stared speechless at the letter, which
  declared in such plain terms a con&shy;suming passion. And yet, in spite of
  the answering emotion which any love&mdash;even though it be
  rejected&mdash;must rouse in the recipient, he could not shake off the
  feeling which he had already experienced at Baiae. A dull, unutterable
  loathing remained paramount in his soul, and the foppish figure of Paris, the
  actor, rose clearly before his fancy. Had not the ear of that slave drunk in
  the same flattering words, as were now intended to intoxicate and ravish him?
  Miserable, contemptible woman ah! how differently and how truly beat the
  proud heart of his Cornelia!</p>

  <p>Cornelia! The thought of her turned the balance finally; Quintus drew a
  wax tablet out of his bosom and wrote on it:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"I feel and acknowledge the greatness of the sacrifice,
  which your Highness proposes to make; but, as a true patriot, I must prefer
  the advantages which will ensue to the state from the reunion of the
  sovereign couple, even to the duties imposed by gratitude."</p>

  <p>He folded the tablet in the letter, tied it up again and gave it to
  Polycharma, who swiftly vanished. "When her steps were no longer audible,
  Quintus pressed his hand over his eyes and sat down on a marble bench to
  reflect. Oh! that sly, intriguing Lycoris!' She too, then, was paid by the
  Empress as well as by Stephanus! Subsidized by both, and a traitoress to both
  for so much at any rate was certain: Stephanus knew nothing qf this nocturnal
  meeting. He, the real instigator of the scene in the circus, could evidently
  have no part in an intrigue, of which the issue would be diametrically
  op&shy;posed to his own efforts.</p>

  <p>Sunk in gloomy reflections on these unpleasing de&shy;tails, Quintus sat
  staring at the ground. Suddenly he heard footsteps, and confused cries were
  audible in the distance, mingled with the clatter of swords and arms. The
  next minute two dark figures ran across the entrance to the rotunda, and up
  the narrow path towards the top of the hill. They were followed by two
  others, who came less rapidly than the first.</p>

  <p>"Leave me, for Christ's sake, I can go no farther!" groaned a piteous
  voice, which touched the young man strangely, and at the same time the light
  of the lamps fell on a pale and suffering face. Quintus recognized the victim
  he had seen at Baiae tied to the stake.</p>

  <p>"Courage, Eurymachus," whispered his companion, a square, thick-set man
  who held him stoutly up. "Hang on to my shoulders; a hundred steps farther,
  and you are safe." And they disappeared among the shrubbery.</p>

  <p>Quintus was not a little bewildered.</p>

  <p>"What is going on here?" thought he, rising and quitting the open plot for
  one of the side paths. "Is this park peopled with demons?"</p>

  <p>Again he heard steps and voices, more numerous and wrathful than before.
  "This way, men! There, up the path between the hedges!"</p>

  <p>"Do not let them get away. Ten thousand sesterces to the man, who brings
  the villains back alive!"</p>

  <p>And shouting thus in loud confusion, a party of armed men came in sight,
  running in breathless haste through the narrow paths. The foremost of them
  was now standing in front of Quintus.</p>

  <p>Make way, my lord!" he exclaimed in eager hurry: "We are seeking a
  criminal," and he tried to push past Quintus.</p>

  <p>Strange! but Quintus, the proud and high-born Quintus, suddenly felt an
  unaccountable impulse to pro&shy;tect and shield the wretched and contemned
  slave.</p>

  <p>"Insolent knave!" he exclaimed in well-feigned indignation: "Would you
  dare to touch Quintus Claudius?" And seizing the astonished man by the wrist
  he flung him violently from him. Meanwhile the others had come up. Quintus
  still barred the way simply by stand&shy;ing there. The band of men looked
  doubtfully now at the young nobleman, and then at their comrade, who got up,
  grumbling, from the stones. Thus a precious moment was gained. At last
  Quintus thought it as well to un&shy;derstand the situation.</p>

  <p>"Idiots!" he exclaimed. "Why did you not explain at once what you wanted?
  instead of that, you storm and rave like madmen..." And he stood aside.</p>

  <p>The pursuers rushed by him in breathless fury.</p>

  <p>"On with you!" he said to himself, as he looked after the armed men. "But
  unless I have reckoned very badly, the game has this time escaped the
  hunters."</p>

  <p>Quintus found the company in the greatest excitement; they were standing
  in agitated knots vehemently discussing something; uncertainty, alarm, and
  conster&shy;nation were visible in all. The only man who appeared altogether
  calm and indifferent was Stephanus, haggard and diplomatic ally reserved. He
  was sitting apart, not far from the spot where the avenue by which Quintus
  returned, opened on to the terrace. A man of athletic build was lying on the
  ground, bleeding from numerous wounds; in his right hand he held the hilt of
  a broken sword and his left was pressed in speechless anguish to his breast,
  where the enemy's blade had pierced him. Five or six slaves, who had carried
  him hither, were standing round him with expressive gestures, while Stephanus
  was making a pitiable abortive attempt to cross-examine the dying man. At
  about forty paces far&shy;ther away four slaves, fearfully injured, were
  lying in their blood. One had had his skull cleft to the neck, and the others
  were covered with hideous and gaping wounds. All four were dead.</p>

  <p>On the spot too, where just now the curtain of gold-tissue had waved,
  there was the greatest confusion. The curtain<a href="#180">180</a> had been
  lowered the fanciful decorations of one side had been overthrown and nearly
  half-burnt, while hammers, nails, ropes, fragments of dresses, and rubbish of
  every kind strewed the stage. In the midst of this hideous disorder a tall
  cross<a href="#181">181</a> stood upright.</p>

  <p>It was some time before Quintus could get any con&shy;nected account of
  what had happened; at first ten voices were raised at once to their highest
  pitch of ex&shy;planation. Lycoris was sulky and peevish, because the best
  effect of her whole programme had been spoilt. Her friend Leaina, on the
  contrary, swore by Hercules that Quintus had lost the finest sight in the
  world. His wily acquaintance Clodianus, who took every oppor&shy;tunity of
  assuming airs of frank bluntness, railed in threatening bass tones at the
  audacity of the rascals, and others wandered off into questions, so that
  Quintus at last lost patience. He went to the captain of the Praetorian
  Guard, took him by the arm, and asked al&shy;most angrily:</p>

  <p>"Norbanus, will you tell me in plain words? I was absent, in the remotest
  part of the wood, and on my re&shy;turn I find a perfect chaos. What does it
  all mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means one more sign of the times. Rome is be&shy;come a perfect
  Vesuvius; there are rumblings and mut&shy;terings on every side and in every
  corner. What do you think? We were sitting here very contentedly on the
  garden seats, enjoying the pleasures of digestion. Well, I was just wondering
  to myself what this Massilian bay mare could still have in reserve, and
  somewhat excited with curiosity, when the curtain was lowered. A grand burst
  of music! and a fellow dressed in scarlet came to the front and informed us
  in well- turned trimeters,<a href="#182">182</a> that a devilish funny piece
  was about to be performed, the capital punishment of a criminal slave<a href=
  "#183">183</a> named Eury&shy;machus..."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Quintus&mdash;horrified.</p>

  <p>"As I tell you the execution of the slave Eurymachus, who had sinned
  gravely against his illustrious master Stephanus, and so had forfeited his
  life."</p>

  <p>"An execution as a garden comedy? This is something new, by Jupiter!"</p>

  <p>"New indeed! hardly heard of since the days of the divine Nero."</p>

  <p>"Well, and what next?"</p>

  <p>"The speaker announced that Lycoris had obtained leave from Parthehius,
  the head chamberlain, to have the execution carried out in the semblance of a
  jest be&shy;fore the eyes of her illustrious and noble guests; he begged our
  indulgence for the performers, bowed, and the entertainment began. You know
  me, Quintus, and that I am no lover of such horrible buffoonery. I fought for
  many years against the Daci<a href="#184">184</a> and Germami, and the gods
  know that the sight of death turns me cold. Merely to see an unarmed wretch
  butchered&mdash;do you know, Quintus, it always reminds me of slaughtering
  swine. When I sit there at my ease, looking on, a lump rises in my throat,
  even in the amphitheatre. It may be outrageously simple and quite out of
  fashion, but for the life of me I cannot help it."</p>

  <p>"Go on, go on!" cried Quintus in growing excite&shy;ment.</p>

  <p>"Well then; the performance began. They dragged the man in, half-naked and
  crowned with roses. I cannot say he looked to me like a dangerous character;
  quite the contrary even at that moment, when his life was at stake, he was
  quite quiet; only his paleness betrayed that the proceedings were not
  altogether pleasant to him. Then all sorts of mocking and games began at his
  ex&shy;pense; men scourged him or kicked him all with con&shy;summate grace
  and half-naked girls danced and leaped round him like mad things, nipped and
  pinched him, boxed his ears, and played all kinds of stupid tricks. This went
  on for about ten minutes. Then the execu&shy;tioners set a ladder by the
  cross there, flung a rope round him under the arms, hauled him up, and the
  first blow of the hammer was on the point of hitting the nail in, when a part
  of the side scene fell in with a tre&shy;mendous crash. Four men, with their
  faces blackened with soot, rushed in like a thunder-storm, seized
  Eury&shy;machus who was as pale as death by the arms, and were gone before
  the pack of slaves had recovered their senses. The spectators thought at
  first that this was part of the entertainment, till they were enlightened by
  the angry shouts of Stephanus and Lycoris. Then it oc&shy;curred to the
  half-stunned executioners, that they might pursue the men. But then they
  perceived, that in the breach made by the fallen scenery a tall giant of a
  man was standing. He received the pursuers with a per&shy;fect storm of
  sword-strokes. Rhodius, the gardener's son, fell without a cry, and the
  second man fared no bet&shy;ter; the uproar was general, and the scenery
  broke out in flames. The whole gang of them fell back before the one with a
  howl, like dogs before a wolf at bay. The tall fellow, however, retired
  through fire and smoke till he was safe outside it all, and then he planted
  himself up above at the entrance of the avenue of elms, sword in hand. Eight
  men rushed upon him at once, but for fully five minutes not one could get at
  him. Three of the assailants bit the dust, before a well-aimed thrust pierced
  the Hercules through the breast. He started, once more gathered himself
  together, and a fourth man fell in front of him, cleft through the skull.
  That was the last of it."</p>

  <p>"A noble ending truly to a friendly festival!" said Quintus glancing at
  Lycoris, who still was fuming over the disaster. "And the rash defender is
  dead?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said Clodianus joining them. "Stephanus is questioning him. But
  as the fellow refuses to give any information, they propose to torture him to
  make him speak."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" cried Quintus furious. "His wound is mortal, he fought like
  a hero. At any rate leave him to die in peace!" Clodianus shrugged his
  shoul&shy;ders.</p>

  <p>"Settle that with Stephanus! If the villain will not confess, it is
  certainly permissible to egg on his loquacity."</p>

  <p>Quintus frowned. After a few minutes of reflection he went up to
  Stephanus, at the very instant when two slaves came on to the terrace with a
  steaming cauldron of water.</p>

  <p>"A very painful incident!" said Claudius coolly.</p>

  <p>"Most painful!" replied Stephanus in the same tone. "I mean to try,
  whether the error may not be remedied." And as he spoke he gave a highly-
  significant nod to the slaves, who had set the cauldron down on the ground
  close to him. Quintus involuntarily stepped forward and put out his hand in
  remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"I hope, my good friend," he said, still perfectly coolly, "that you only
  intended to frighten this villain&mdash;good taste alone must
  prohibit..."</p>

  <p>Stephanus changed color slightly, and the slaves looked terrified into his
  face. The tension of the situa&shy;tion was interrupted by the return of the
  armed men, who had been sent after the fugitives and now came back breathless
  and streaming with sweat.</p>

  <p>"My lord," the foremost began, "we return as jaded as a pack of hounds,
  but with empty hands."</p>

  <p>"So I see," said Stephanus in chill tones. "And what tavern did you stop
  at, and what wenches did you stop to kiss."</p>

  <p>"Forgive us, my lord!" groaned another sinking on to his knees, partly
  from exhaustion, and partly from terror. "We rushed up the hill like blood-
  hounds,<a href="#185">185</a> but they had too much the start of us."</p>

  <p>Stephanus looked down.</p>

  <p>"Was the gate on to the Patrician Way<a href="#186">186</a> locked?" he
  asked frowning.</p>

  <p>"Fast locked."</p>

  <p>"It is well. I will speak to your mistress. Woe to you, if you are in
  fault!"</p>

  <p>"My lord," the first speaker began again. "Grant me to say one word of
  explanation. In spite of the start the fugitives had gained, we might have
  caught them if an accident..."</p>

  <p>He broke off and glanced at Quintus, who smiled and told him to go on.
  "Speak fearlessly," he said kindly. "Accuse me, if you think well to do
  so&mdash;in fact, you have every right."</p>

  <p>The slave went on to relate how Quintus had delayed him and his comrades
  in the narrow hedge-grown pas&shy;sage. At each word Stephanus grew paler,
  and Quintus became more and more scornful in air and demeanor.</p>

  <p>"Are this man's assertions founded on fact?" asked Stephanus as the slave
  ceased speaking.</p>

  <p>"How am I to interpret such a question?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly as I ask it. I am interested to know whether a son of the noble
  Claudia gens can so far&mdash;condescend, as to abet the flight of a
  criminal?"</p>

  <p>"That I did not say!" cried the slave, shocked.</p>

  <p>"Never mind!" said Quintus reassuringly, to the ex&shy;cited narrator.
  "You have spoken the truth, and I will vouch for it at any moment. When I was
  loitering in the gardens of our fair hostess, how should I guess that
  cer&shy;tain persons, who came upon me quite suddenly, were chasing a runaway
  slave? And even if I had guessed it, what is there to compel me to step among
  the thorns and briars, in order to make way for your thief-catchers?"</p>

  <p>"Politeness and a due regard for the interests of the commonwealth,"
  replied Stephanus drily. "However, what is done cannot be undone. It is all
  the more necessary to act promptly, in what yet remains to be done."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he went close up to the blood-stained Hun, who, with his last
  remaining strength, lifted him&shy;self up and cast a wild glance round
  him.</p>

  <p>"You hardened hound," he said in a rough, hoarse voice, "I will soften
  you! Do you see that cauldron? I ask you once more: Who are you? Who are your
  fellow-conspirators?" The gasping man's breast heaved more rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Will you speak?" repeated Stephanus furiously. And now, for the first
  time the victim spoke; till now he had not uttered a sound.</p>

  <p>"No!" he cried with his last remnant of strength, and he sank back
  groaning.</p>

  <p>"Very well; then abide by your destiny." At this moment Quintus Claudius
  stepped up to the slaves who held the cauldron, his arms crossed on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"Enough of this horse-play!" he said curtly and vehemently. "Begone
  indoors, you parcel of idiots! I, Quintus Claudius, command you to go."</p>

  <p>"And I, Stephanus, command you in the name of your mistress: remain and
  obey! Rufus, Daedalus, lay hold!"</p>

  <p>"We will solve this dilemma, as Alexander did in Gordium," said Quintus
  scornfully, and with these words he pushed the slaves aside and gave the
  cauldron a mighty kick, so that the contents poured steaming out all over the
  terrace.</p>

  <p>"This is violence!"<a href="#187">187</a> exclaimed Stephanus,
  involuntarily raising his hands.</p>

  <p>"The violence of reason against bad taste and coarse feeling!" said
  Quintus with a scowling look. "I should advise you, freedman,<a href=
  "#188">188</a> to keep your hand hidden away in the folds of your robe, or in
  the depths of your coffers and money-boxes, or Quintus Claudius might happen
  to squeeze that hand rather more tightly than you would like!"</p>

  <p>At the word "freedman" Stephanus had turned as pale as a corpse. He closed
  his eyes and staggered. His lean fingers trembled and twitched, as if he were
  feeling for a dagger. Then, mastering his agitation with an almost superhuman
  effort, he said faintly:</p>

  <p>"I do not altogether understand what it is that you mean, so I will not
  trouble myself to answer... you. Meanwhile you have only given the slaves
  some un&shy;necessary extra labor.&mdash;To work, men!&mdash;refill the
  cauldron."</p>

  <p>"Too late," said Quintus. "Your victim has escaped you."</p>

  <p>"He is dead!" cried the slaves.</p>

  <p>Stephanus muttered something unintelligible between his teeth; then he
  ordered that the body should be re&shy;moved.</p>

  <p>"Antinous," said he to one of the slaves, a remarkably beautiful young
  fellow: "I look to you to report all that has happened here, fully and
  exactly to the authorities. If Eurymachus is delivered up to me alive, I
  promise you a hundred thousand sesterces. Here comes Lycoris with the
  soldiers of the town- watch.<a href="#189">189</a> Speak to them; tell them
  all you know, and offer them gold; that will inspire the most dilatory."</p>

  <p>"I hear and obey, my lord."</p>

  <p>"I am tired and shall withdraw. In ten minutes I shall expect to see
  you."</p>

  <p>"I shall be with you in five."</p>

  <p>The file of men at arms&mdash;a division of a military body, who performed
  the duties of a town-watch, com&shy;bining the functions of our modern
  firemen and police&mdash;came up just at the right moment to verify the death
  of the unknown victim, to take the statements of the as&shy;sistants and
  spend an hour verv comfortably in the atrium. The guests of the fair Lycoris
  had soon re&shy;covered from the unpleasant impression produced by the
  untoward incident. Amusements and sports of every kind effaced the last
  traces of its remembrance, and for a long time after the tones of luxurious
  music sounded through the starry night</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p>THE morning was already grey over the distant Sabine hills<a href=
  "#190">190</a> when Quintus, followed by his clients and slaves,<a href=
  "#191">191</a> left the scene of festivity. With him came Clo&shy;dianus and
  the poet Martial; the former accompanied, like himself, by a number of
  dependents and satellites, the latter by a single slave, whose smoky little
  lamp looked absurd enough by the side of the handsome lan&shy;terns and
  torches of the rest of the escort.</p>

  <p>"A mad night!" sighed Martial, looking up. "The stars are already
  twinkling like eyes dim at leave-taking. Illustrious Clodianus, you will make
  my excuses to my patron, the chamberlain Parthenius, if I should fail to
  offer my morning greeting. Getting up early is my greatest torment,<a href=
  "#192">192</a> even when I have crept between the coverlets at betimes, and
  to-day, after this unpardonable dissipation...</p>

  <p>Clodianus laughed.</p>

  <p>"I will explain it to him," he roared out in the fresh morning air.
  "However&mdash;I shall hardly see him before noon. I am as tired myself, as
  if I had been sawing stone all night."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is frightful to be so tired! I would give ten years of my life,
  if I might only sleep half the day. But on the contrary, before cock-crow, I
  must be out of bed, fling my toga over my shoulders, and be bowing to
  noblemen! By Castor! if I were not an ass, I should long since have fled to
  the peace and quietness of my native town!"</p>

  <p>"Well, sleep to-day till sundown! Just now Par&shy;thenius will be most
  willing to excuse you, for his head is so full of business, and Caesar makes
  such incessant claims upon his time, that he is glad when his best friends
  leave him in peace."</p>

  <p>"I heard the same thing from my father," added Quintus. "Some great stroke
  seems to be in hand. Is nothing known of the facts?"</p>

  <p>"Pah! it is the talk of the town. Plots dangerous to the state, treason to
  religion and society, conspiracies against Caesar..."</p>

  <p>"But the facts&mdash;the details...?"</p>

  <p>"You know," said Clodianus laughing, "that in affairs of state, silence is
  as important, as valor is in battle!"</p>

  <p>"Well said!" cried the poet.<a href="#193">193</a> "With a little suitable
  embellishment, that may be turned into a brilliant epigram. Now, noble
  friends, I will bid you farewell Our roads are no longer the same. I must
  climb up here to the temple on the Quirinal, while you go down into the
  valley. In life it is just the reverse. Apollo preserve you!" He hastily
  turned up the street, while Clodianus and Quintus went on along the 'Long
  Way.'</p>

  <p>"Aye!" said the crafty Clodianus. "I have constantly to remind myself of
  the duty of silence; more than once has my rash tongue run away with me. I
  come of an easy-tempered race, which are apt to talk without stopping to
  think. It is wrong, by Hercules!&mdash;it is wrong!"</p>

  <p>They had now reached the Subura.<a href="#194">194</a> The height of the
  five, six, or more-storied houses,<a href="#195">195</a> and the narrowness
  of the way here, only allowed the day to dawn slowly and late, and deep gloom
  still prevailed in the numerous taverns<a href="#196">196</a> and entries. At
  the same time busy life was already stirring on all sides; itinerant
  bakers<a href="#197">197</a> were wan&shy;dering from door to door crying
  their fresh bread. Pedagogues,<a href="#198">198</a> with their writing
  implements and clay lamps, were leading files of boys to school. Here and
  there, from a side alley, might be heard the croaking chant of a teacher, and
  the babble of spelling children.<a href="#199">199</a> Groups of worshippers,
  on their way to perform their morning devotions in the neighboring temple of
  Isis, hurried across the loudly-echoing pavement.</p>

  <p>"Day is coming upon us apace," said Quintus, as he stopped in front of the
  entrance to the "Cyprius street"<a href="#200">200</a> and held out his hand
  to the adjutant.</p>

  <p>"Our roads part here, and we must make haste if we mean to reach home
  before sunrise."</p>

  <p>"Will you be at the Baths at about noon?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly. If I get up in time."</p>

  <p>"Well then&mdash;let us hope that the wine-cup of Lycoris may leave you
  free of headache."</p>

  <p>"The same to you! Farewell." And with these words Quintus went on his way,
  while Clodianus turned off to the right.</p>

  <p>"Cyprius street" grew at every step more select and consequently more
  deserted; to the left the Baths of Titus stood up, a sharply-defined mass,
  against the rose&shy;tinted sky. Each time that Quintus Claudius walked up
  the street, this vast pile seemed to have a fresh spell for him. The contrast
  between the ponderous mass, and the tender flush of Autumn dawn behind him,
  filled him with pleasurable admiration, and his eye followed a flock of
  pigeons, which for some few minutes soared to and fro above the great
  building and then, with sudden swift&shy;ness, flew across the road.</p>

  <p>"They came from the left," said he to one of his companions. "Now, if I
  believed in augury from the flight of birds, I should be forced to suppose
  that some evil was hanging over me."</p>

  <p>He was still speaking, when from the same side, where a narrow path came
  down from the great Baths, a muffled figure rushed upon him and hit him a
  blow with a bare poniard. Happily the ruffian at the same instant slipped on
  the sloping pavement&mdash;which was rendered even more slippery by the early
  morning dew&mdash;so that the dagger missed its aim, and instead of
  pierc&shy;ing the young man's throat, passed across his left shoul&shy;der
  and through the folds of his toga, which it cut through as sharply as a
  razor. And before Quintus quite understood what had happened, the assassin
  had glided away between the slaves with the suppleness of a pan&shy;ther, and
  vanished in the direction of the Subura. The young man gazed at his arm,
  where the toga and under&shy;garment hung in long strips; the wound was but
  skin&shy;deep, a spot of blood had here and there oozed out.</p>

  <p>"Let it be!" said Quintus to the slaves, who had crowded round him when
  their first stupified astonish&shy;ment was over. "I know very well where
  that blade was sharpened, and for the future I will be more cautious. But one
  thing I must say to you; my good people, each and all, be silent as to this
  attack. You too, my excel&shy;lent friends and clients&mdash;you know how
  easily my noble father is alarmed. If he knew that there was in all Rome a
  villain, who had threatened my life, he would never know another moment's
  peace."</p>

  <p>"My lord, you know us!" exclaimed the slaves and freedmen, and the clients
  too professed their devotion.</p>

  <p>"His revenge is prompt!" thought Quintus, as he went onwards. "I always
  knew him to be an example of audacity and ruthlessness&mdash;still, such
  impatience as this is somewhat a surprise to me."</p>

  <p>Then suddenly he stood still, as a new and almost impossible idea flashed
  across his mind. "If it were... supposing... Could Domitia...?"</p>

  <p>He pressed his hands over his eyes, and that which had at first seemed so
  plain, intelligible and obvious, now sank back into the mists of doubt and
  conjecture.</p>

  <p>The slaves had by this time extinguished their torches and lanterns. Broad
  daylight shone in cloudless beauty over the widely-spread city of the Seven
  Hills. The great temple of Isis lay flooded with gold; a procession of
  priests,<a href="#201">201</a> bearing the image of the goddess, came
  marching down the street.</p>

  <p>"Get on!" cried Quintus. "I am tired to death. It was a folly, Blepyrus,
  to dismiss the litters."</p>

  <p>"It was wisdom, my lord!" said the slave. "If I still am honored with your
  confidence, I would again repeat..."</p>

  <p>"Ah well!" Quintus interrupted. "Very likely you are right&mdash;you
  leeches are always right.<a href="#202">202</a> If only you attain a
  proportionate result! But if exercise were every&shy;thing, I should be the
  lightest-hearted man in Europe. Nay, my good Blepyrus, this dissatisfaction,
  this intol&shy;erable sense of ill lies deeper..."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes they had reached home. The ostiarius<a href=
  "#203">203</a> was standing at the door, as if the master of the house were
  impatiently expected. Quintus was about to cross the threshold, when he heard
  himself loudly called by name.</p>

  <p>"What do I see? Euterpe! All hail to you&mdash;so soon returned to
  Rome?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord, since yesterday," answered the flute&shy;player hastily.
  "And ever since I came, I have been incessantly trying to find you. Do you
  still remember," she went on in a low voice, "what you promised me at
  Baiae?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my pretty one. Quintus Claudius sticks to his bargain...
  besides... But who is the grey-headed old man with you there? Your husband or
  your father?"</p>

  <p>"My husband is young, and my father is dead. This is Thrax Barbatus,
  Glauce's father."</p>

  <p>"And who is Glauce?"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;did I never tell you about Glauce&mdash;out there, on the
  hills by Baiae? I must have forgotten in the midst of all my trouble. Glauce
  is to be married to our Eurymachus..."</p>

  <p>"Ah! the heroic sufferer, that Stephanus had flogged?"</p>

  <p>"The very same, my lord! And you promised me to remember..."</p>

  <p>"True, true come to me in the course of the afternoon..."</p>

  <p>"Ah! my lord, but that will be too late. Eurymachus is in danger of his
  life..."</p>

  <p>"What, again!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! be merciful, most noble Quintus! Give us only five minutes audience!
  You alone can save him."</p>

  <p>"Come in, then!"</p>

  <p>He led the way through the atrium into his private room.</p>

  <p>"My lord," the flute-player began again, "I will tell my story shortly.
  Eurymachus rebelled against the Empress' steward, who wanted to persuade him
  to all sorts of disgraceful conduct. Stephanus flogged him first, and then
  obtained permission to crucify him at the next festival. This I heard from
  the gate-keeper. But there was no festival fixed for yesterday, so there is
  still some hope, and we entreat you..."</p>

  <p>"Be calm&mdash;for the present your friend is in safety."</p>

  <p>"Impossible&mdash;he is lying in chains..."</p>

  <p>"He <i>was</i> lying in chains. His execution was fixed for yesterday, but
  at the last moment he was snatched from the jaws of peril."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Thrax Barbatus, speaking for the first time. "Did I hear you
  rightly, snatched from his fet&shy;ters! Then Glauce was able to carry out
  what she pro&shy;posed."</p>

  <p>"Free?" said Euterpe, looking up at Quintus in be&shy;wilderment.</p>

  <p>"As I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, now I see it all!" cried Thrax Barbatus. "This pretended journey to
  Ostia&mdash;what had your husband to do in Ostia? And Philippus, my son, who
  has hardly been in Rome a week&mdash;why should he want to accom&shy;pany
  Diphilus..." Then, seized with terror, he sank on the ground before Quintus
  and threw his arms round his knees.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lord! do not take advantage of the rash words of a miserable
  father!" he exclaimed vehemently. "Do not betray, what my tongue let slip in
  my fear and anxiety."</p>

  <p>"Be easy, old man!" said Quintus benevolently. "I am not one of the spies
  of the city-guard. Your friend is a hero, and courage always commands my
  sym&shy;pathy."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, thanks!" sobbed the old man, covering the young noble's hands
  with kisses. "But tell me, pray, how it all happened; how is it possible
  that, in the midst of such a crowd of servants..."</p>

  <p>"All is possible to those who dare all. What I heard&mdash;and the merest
  accident prevented my being an eye witness&mdash;aroused as much astonishment
  in me, as in you. All the bystanders seemed to have been paralyzed. It was
  like an eagle in the Hyrcanian mountains, 204 swooping down on a lamb. One
  man&mdash;particularly, a stalwart, broad-shouldered fellow, did wonders of
  valor..."</p>

  <p>Thrax Barbatus drew himself up with the elasticity of youth. Happy pride
  sparkled in his eyes, and an expression&mdash;a radiance, as it were, of
  beatific affection illuminated his rugged and strongly-wrinkled features.</p>

  <p>"That was Philippus, my son!" he said with a trem&shy;bling voice. "Oh! it
  was not for nothing, that he fought for years against the Dacians, not in
  vain that he endured frost and heat. There is not a man in all the legion
  that is his match in skill and strength; not one that can beat him in running
  or in lance-throwing. But speak, my lord; you look so grave, so sad! What is
  it? Oh, for God's sake, in Christ's name&mdash;it is impossible! My son, my
  Philippus! but he could stand against twenty&mdash;speak, my lord, or you
  will kill me..."</p>

  <p>"Poor old man," said Quintus much moved, "what good will it do to conceal
  the truth from you? Your son is dead. Scorning to fly, he exposed himself too
  long to his foes. He died like a hero."</p>

  <p>Thrax Barbatus uttered a soul-piercing cry, and fell backwards to the
  ground; Euterpe flung herself upon him and clasped his head to her heart,
  weeping bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Thrax&mdash;dear, good friend," she sobbed out: "Con&shy;trol yourself,
  collect yourself! Show yourself strong in this terrible trouble! Consider,
  you will have Glauce, and Eurymachus, who loves you like a son."</p>

  <p>The old man slowly pulled himself up; he pushed Euterpe violently aside,
  and then sinking on to his knees, raised his hands in passionate appeal to
  Heaven. His lips moved in prayer, but no sound was heard. Quintus, lost in
  astonishment, stood leaning against a pillar, while Euterpe wept silently,
  her face buried in her arm. A terrible storm seemed to be raging in the old
  man's soul; his breast rose and fell like a wind-tossed sea, and a wild fire
  glowed in his eyes. But by degrees he grew calmer, and his features assumed
  an expression of sorrowing and silent resignation. It was as though a tender
  and beatific ray of forgiveness lighted them up, growing clearer each moment.
  After a time he rose.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, my lord," he said slowly. "I was stricken down by the vastness
  of my grief. He fell like a hero, you said? And Eurymachus is safe?"</p>

  <p>"He escaped," replied Quintus, "which, alas! is not quite the same thing.
  Every effort will be made to re&shy;cover possession of the fugitive. Well,
  we must see what can be done. Accident has enlisted me on your side, and I
  will play the part out to the end. For the present leave me; I am tired out,
  and a tired man is of no use as an adviser; but this evening, about the
  second vigil, <a name="205"
     id="205">205</a> I will find my way to your dwelling, unaccompanied."</p>

  <p>"Father in Heaven, I thank Thee!" cried Thrax Barbatus vehemently.
  "Blessings, oh! blessings on the head of this noble and generous youth!
  Farewell, my lord! Never, never will I forget your gracious kindness to us
  helpless wretches."</p>

  <p>With these words he left the room, and Euterpe followed him. Quintus went
  at once to his curtained cubiculum,<a href="#206">206</a> undressed with the
  help of the faithful Blepyrus and soon fell asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p>"REALLY, Baucis, you are very clumsy again to-day!" cried Lucilia, half-
  vexed and half-saucily. "Do you want to pull that fine, luxuriant hair, that
  the greatest poet might rave about, all out by the roots. I have shown you a
  hundred times how the arrow is to be put through, and you always tousle my
  hair as old Orbilius<a href="#207">207</a> does the schoolboys!"</p>

  <p>"Ingratitude for thanks, all the world over!" muttered the old slave,
  casting a last glance at Lucilia's curls, her successful handiwork. "I
  suppose you would like to stick a pin into me.<a href="#208">208</a> Really,
  the young peo&shy;ple of the present day are like babies or dolls. And if the
  gold pin slips and the plaits come down, then it is the old woman who is to
  blame and there is no end of the fuss. Ah! you naughty girl,<a href=
  "#209">209</a> how do you expect to get on when you are married, you
  impatient little thing! Many a time will you have to sigh, when your husband
  is out of temper! Many a time will you say to yourself: 'Ah! if only I had
  learned a little patience when I was younger!'"</p>

  <p>"You are greatly mistaken," said Lucilia in a declamatory tone. "The days
  are over when the husband was master over everything in the house. What woman
  now-a-days will submit to a wedding with offerings of corn?<a href=
  "#210">210</a> We have grown wiser, and know what such offerings are meant to
  symbolize&mdash;we are to surrender our liberty to the very last grain! So I
  should think! If ever I marry... But what are you about? Will you ever have
  done fidgetting with that tiresome necklace? Do look, Claudia, how she is
  tormenting me!"</p>

  <p>Claudia was sitting in holiday attire in front of a handsome citrus-
  wood<a href="#211">211</a> table, holding in her hands the ivory roller of an
  elegantly-written book. When Lucilia spoke to her she absently raised her
  soft, fawn-like eyes, laid the roll aside and stood up.</p>

  <p>"You look like Melpomene," cried Lucilia enthusiastically, while Baucis
  draped her <i>stola</i>.<a href="#212">212</a> "If I were Aurelius, I should
  have my head turned by the sight of you. How well the folds of your dress
  fall, and how admirably the border lies on the ground, oh! and your hair! Do
  you know I am quite in love myself with that hair; it goes so beautifully
  with the soft brown of your eyes. That dark fair hair, with a kind of dim
  lustre, is too lovely; my stupid, every-day brown looks no better by the side
  of it than a cabbage next a rose. Of course, too, Baucis takes three times as
  much pains with you as with me. Tell me yourself, is not this arrow all askew
  again?"</p>

  <p>So speaking she took a polished metal mirror<a href="#213">213</a> from
  the table, and studied her coiffure first from the right and then from the
  left, while one of the young slave-girls, who stood round Baucis, came to her
  assistance with a second mirror.</p>

  <p>"It is quite horrid!" she said crossly. "In short every single thing is
  wanting in me to-day, that could please the fancy of any human being. Never
  was my fatal snub-nose so short and broad, never was my mouth so wide and
  vulgar. And listen, Claudia, in spite of all its beauty, I can do without
  going to Baiae for the future. I gained twenty pounds in weight there, and
  brought home three dozen freckles. It is a lucky thing, that I have a
  philosophic soul! If I were in love now with some son of the gods, by
  Socrates' cup of hemlock I should be desperate with rage!"</p>

  <p>"You are only fishing for praise," said Claudia, strok&shy;ing her
  sister's cheek. "But you know I am but ill&shy;skilled in the art of paying
  compliments."</p>

  <p>"Silly girl!" said Lucilia. "As if praise could mend an evil. Do you
  suppose I want to do as the young law students do, who hire flatterers to
  praise them?<a href="#214">214</a> Nay, no bribery is possible, when we stand
  before the Centumvirate<a href="#215">215</a> who judge of beauty. And, my
  good Baucis, what are you staring at now, like a country cousin at a circus.
  Make haste and get dressed, you old sinner, or Cinna's cook will have burnt
  the pasty."</p>

  <p>"I shall be ready in an instant," replied Baucis. "At my time of life
  dressing need not take long. Who looks at the hawthorn, I wonder, when roses
  are in bloom?" and she hurried away.</p>

  <p>Lucilia and Claudia went out into the colonnade svhere, arm in arm, they
  slowly paced the gleaming marble pavement. As they turned the farther corner
  of the quadrangle, they saw their mother coming towards them at a leisurely
  pace.</p>

  <p>"Quintus is ready and waiting," she said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"And you, dear mother?" asked Lucilia. "Do you really mean to stay at
  home?"</p>

  <p>"It is such a pity," added Claudia. "We are ac&shy;customed, alas! to my
  father's never accompanying us to see Cornelia, but you&mdash;what need you
  care about the debates in the senate? Besides, Cornelius Cinna is
  re&shy;lated to your family. Your views as to what contributes to the
  prosperity of the Roman people differ no doubt..."</p>

  <p>"In Jupiter's name, child!" cried Octavia horrified. "Claudia, what are
  you saying? If your father were to hear you..."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear mother," answered the girl, "I am only speaking the truth.
  There are many very estimable men..."</p>

  <p>"Be silent&mdash;when and where did you pick up such notions? Attend to
  your music and your poets, give your mind to the flowers you twist into your
  hair, but never meddle with the mysteries of state-craft."</p>

  <p>The young girl looked down in some confusion.</p>

  <p>"Do not pay any heed to it, mother dear!" said Lucilia. "She chatters
  without thinking. But, once more&mdash;do come with us. Cornelius Cinna will
  very likely not be visible; you know how strangely the old man behaves. Come,
  mother&mdash;and remember, dear little mother, it is Cornelia's birthday. She
  will certainly feel hurt, if the mother of her future husband lets the day
  pass without going to embrace her."</p>

  <p>"It is of no use; your father's wishes have always been my law. Believe
  me, my sweet child, the utmost I can do is to allow you to visit at that
  house..."</p>

  <p>"Come, that would be too bad, mother! I really be&shy;lieve, that if he
  had not formally released Quintus from his filial bondage, he would have been
  capable of forbid&shy;ding the marriage."</p>

  <p>"It is quite possible," replied Octavia. "That noble soul places the
  commonwealth above every other con&shy;sideration. You can hardly imagine,
  how unswervingly he goes on the road he believes to be the right one."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes! I know his resolute nature," said Claudia, "and I honor and
  admire it. Say no more, Lucilia; mother is right. A man must never yield even
  a hand&shy;breadth, and silent obedience is a wife's first duty."</p>

  <p>"You are my dear good child," said Octavia much touched. "And believe me
  when I say, that the fulfilment of this duty, hard as it seems, is a
  heartfelt joy when such a man as your father is the husband. He is strict and
  firm, but not a tyrant; he is always ready to listen to reason, and to take
  council with the chosen com&shy;panion of his life. Nay, he is not above
  learning from the humblest. On one point only he stands like a rock against
  which the surf beats in vain, and that point is Duty."</p>

  <p>"Here comes Baucis!" cried Lucilia with a laugh of saucy amusement. "Hail,
  oh fairest of brides, clad in the garb of rejoicing! Baucis in sky-blue! If
  this does not procure her a Philemon, I must despair of the fate of
  humanity."</p>

  <p>"You hear, mistress, how shamefully she mocks your waiting-woman," said
  Baucis in lamentable tones. "I can never do anything right. If I wear grey,
  she hints at an ass; if I put on a handsome dress, she laughs at me to my
  face. However, what I had to say is, that the litters are at the door and the
  young master has asked three times if his sisters were coming."</p>

  <p>"We are quite ready," said Claudia.</p>

  <p>A dense crowd had gathered outside the vestibule. Quintus, with only three
  of his slaves, was waiting im&shy;patiently in the entrance. The twelve
  litter-bearers in their red livery stood by the poles, and eight
  negroes&mdash;the van and rear-guard of the procession&mdash;were staring
  vacantly into the air. A number of idlers had collected round these the
  inquisitive gapers who always swarmed wherever there was anything to be seen,
  however trivial. These were the class who, not choosing to work, lived on the
  corn given away by the state;<a href="#216">216</a> the uproarious mob who
  filled the upper rows of seats in the theatres and circus; the populace whose
  suffrages no Caesar was too proud to court, since it was among these that
  arbi&shy;trary despotism had its most staunch adherents, in the struggle
  against the last remnants of a free and freedom&shy;loving aristocracy.</p>

  <p>"Oh! how handsome she is!" ran from mouth to mouth among the loiterers, as
  Claudia stepped into the foremost litter; Lucilia took her place by her
  adopted sister's side. The second litter was to carry Baucis and a young
  slave girl.</p>

  <p>"Make way!" cried the principal runner, stepping among the crowd, who fell
  back, and the procession set out. Quintus followed on foot at a short
  distance.</p>

  <p>Their way led them through the Forum and past the venerable temple of
  Saturn, where the Roman state&shy;treasure was kept. To the right on the
  Palatine, spread the enormous palaces of the Caesars, and among them the
  capitol and the splendid but scarcely-finished resi&shy;dence of Domitian.
  Proceeding but slowly, they reached the Arch of Titus<a href="#217">217</a>
  and then, leaving the fountain of the Meta Sudans<a href="#218">218</a> and
  the vast Flavian Amphitheatre<a href="#219">219</a> to the right, they turned
  into the street leading to the Caelimontana Gate.<a href="#220">220</a> The
  throng of humanity, which in the neighborhood of the Forum defied all
  description, here became somewhat thinner; and the litter-bearers mended
  their pace. In about ten minutes they stopped at a house, which in point of
  magnificence was hardly inferior to that of the Flamen Titus Claudius
  Mucianus. In the vestibule, beside the door-keeper, there stood a stout
  lit&shy;tle woman, who hailed the visitors from afar with a broad grin, and
  was most eager to be of use to the young ladies as they alighted. This little
  woman was Chloe, Cornelia's maid; her mistress now appeared on the scene, a
  tall and finely-made young girl, with hair as black as night, dressed
  entirely in white and wearing no ornament but a string of large,
  softly-gleaming pearls. The girls embraced each other warmly.</p>

  <p>Quintus had by this time joined them; with a tender light in his eyes he
  went straight up to his betrothed and kissed her gravely on the forehead.
  "All health, happi&shy;ness and blessing on you, on your birthday,<a href=
  "#221">221</a> my sweet Cornelia!" he said affectionately; then taking her
  hand he led her into the atrium. This was festally decorated with flowers; in
  the middle stood a hearth<a href="#222">222</a> after the old fashion, but
  there were no images of the Lares and Penates. Cornelius Cinna held the
  opinions and views of the world at large, which had been taught by
  Lucretius<a href="#223">223</a> and Pliny the Elder;<a href="#224">224</a> he
  thought it folly to enquire curiously as to the form and aspect of the
  Divinity, or even of any particular god or goddess; since, if there be indeed
  a Power beyond and behind Nature, that Power must be Force and Wisdom pure
  and simple. Hence he contemned all the ordinary household gods.</p>

  <p>Eight or ten guests were already assembled in the atrium, among them Caius
  Aurelius and his faithful follower Herodianus.</p>

  <p>The young Batavian did not at first seem to observe the new arrivals. He
  was standing in grave conversa&shy;tion with the master of the house, whose
  gloomy and almost sinister countenance by no means harmonized with the gay
  decorations of the hearth and the Corin&shy;thian columns.</p>

  <p>"I thank you," said Cinna offering the young man his hand. "Your words
  have done me good. But now, ask no farther..."</p>

  <p>"As you desire..."</p>

  <p>"One thing more, my dear Caius&mdash;Quintus Claudius too must know how
  strongly I feel on this point. After dinner bring him, as if by chance, into
  my study..."</p>

  <p>"Trust to me."</p>

  <p>"Very good; and now for a few hours I will try to banish these memories
  from my soul. As you see me, Caius, you may think it a miracle that I am not
  choked by the insult! And not a soul that could sympathize with me! Nerva, my
  old friend, was absent. Even Trajan was so far off as Antium"..." 225</p>

  <p>"And Caius Aurelius was too young and too much a stranger?" said the
  Batavian laughing.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I must confess that it was so. From the first, it is true, I saw you
  to be an admirable youth, and I thank my friend at Gades, who sent you with
  letters of introduction to me; but I could not guess how early ripe and truly
  noble your whole nature was, how fervent your patriotism and how
  unconquerable your pride.&mdash;But in all truth, Aurelius, from this day
  forth&mdash;here comes Quintus and his sisters; we part for the present, but
  do not forget!"</p>

  <p>His face, which had brightened somewhat as he spoke, fell again to the
  expression of grave, almost sinister determination, which characterized his
  strongly-marked features. He crossed the atrium to the entrance where the
  young people, surrounded by their guests, were chatting gaily. Cinna pressed
  the hand of his niece's lover&mdash;kindly, but yet with a certain
  reserve&mdash;and ad&shy;dressed a few half-jesting words to the girls; but
  when Claudia attempted to offer such apology as best she might for her
  mother's absence, he turned away as if he did not hear.</p>

  <p>At this moment the noble figure of an old man ap&shy;peared in the
  doorway; with a gleaming white toga over his shoulders and flowing snowy
  locks, his towering height gave him a majestic presence.</p>

  <p>"Cocceius Nerva," whispered the Batavian to Herodianus, who came up to him
  to ask.</p>

  <p>"By Castor!" said the freedman, "but if I had met this man on arriving
  here, I should have said that he and no other must be the ruler of the
  world."</p>

  <p>"Remember, we are in Rome, and you will do well to keep such ideas to
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Cornelius Cinna led the illustrious senator to a hand&shy;some marble seat
  covered with carpets, and a circle of reverent friends formed round him at
  once.</p>

  <p>"By all the gods," muttered Herodianus, "may I perish if that marble seat
  does not look for all the world like a throne; and they stand round him like
  the guard round Caesar.&mdash;And now, as he raises his right hand! If he
  were but thirty years younger, he would be like that image of Zeus we bought
  a while since in Gades; he only lacks the thunderbolt."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" repeated Aurelius angrily. "You have had no wine yet to-
  day&mdash;what will you not say when you have played your part at dinner, if
  you are as thirsty as usual?"</p>

  <p>"I will not say another word," replied the freed&shy;man.</p>

  <p>Claudia, who till this instant had been talking eagerly with Ulpius
  Trajanus, a Hispanian friend of Cinna's, of Cocceius Nerva's&mdash;too
  eagerly, Aurelius thought&mdash;now went off with Cornelia under the
  colonnade to see the birthday gifts which, in accordance with an old Roman
  custom, had been sent to Cornelia early in the day. They were tastefully laid
  out in the arcade on brazen tables; gold brooches and necklaces among
  exquisite flowers; tissues mixed with silk;<a href="#226">226</a> handsome
  books with purple edges, rolled on cylinders of amber and ebony; little
  slippers worked with pearls; beaten silver vessels from the hand of
  Mentor,<a href="#227">227</a> the esteemed silversmith; Arabian and Indian
  perfumes from the stores of Niceros,<a href="#228">228</a> the famous
  druggist; ribbons and trimmings of amethyst- purple;<a href="#229">229</a>
  stuffed birds, fruits from Asia Minor, and a hundred other costly trifles
  from every quarter of the world made up the tribute sent to this spoilt
  daughter of a senatorial house.</p>

  <p>Aurelius took advantage of the opportunity, and went to join the young
  girls. Claudia affected great surprise at seeing him, but immediately after
  gave the young man her hand with frank warmth, as though ashamed in truth of
  any disingenuous coquetry towards such a man as Aurelius. Still, the
  conversation they began was not particularly lively; they stood in front ot
  the tables and made the usual remarks&mdash;this present was charming, that
  offering was splendid. Cornelia declared, that prettiest of all were the
  exquisite roses<a href="#230">230</a> that Quintus had given her&mdash;and
  Claudia sighed, very softly, still she sighed.</p>

  <p>At this moment a grinning head appeared in the frame of a door close by.
  This was Chloe, Cornelia's maid.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," she said with comical impor&shy;tance. "But if I
  disturb you, it is from sheer necessity. The steward of the tables<a href=
  "#231">231</a> cannot arrange the places for the company."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, how is that?" asked Cornelia severely. "Did I not give him full
  and exact instructions? He seems to have a short memory."</p>

  <p>"Excuse us, dear mistress&mdash;but he had not counted on Cocceius Nerva.
  Come and help us, pray."</p>

  <p>Cornelia frowned, but did as she was requested; her pallid face colored
  scarlet; such a question seemed to her vulgar and trivial, and she felt that
  shock to her taste which jars on a superior nature, when the details of daily
  life intrude on a moment of exalted feeling. Those roses from
  Paestum,<a href="#232">232</a> that thought of Quintus! what a delicious
  flood of happy feeling they symbolized! And Chloe's appearance, in the very
  midst of this beauty and happiness, wounded her like the empty farcicality of
  an Atellanian buffoon.<a href="#233">233</a></p>

  <p>Aurelius and Claudia were left to gaze at the display of birthday gifts
  with redoubled attention; you might have fancied they had never before seen
  such things as flowers or bracelets.</p>

  <p>"How delicious!" said Claudia breathing the per&shy;fume of a splendid
  rose-bush.</p>

  <p>"Delicious!" echoed Aurelius, putting his face close to the flowers. "And
  look at this strange bird! How naturally it sits with its wings spread
  out&mdash;exactly as if it were alive."</p>

  <p>"It is a parrot from the banks of the Indus."</p>

  <p>"Or a phoenix...?"<a href="#234">234</a></p>

  <p>"A phoenix? I thought that story of Tacitus' was a mere fable."</p>

  <p>"Nay, not altogether. The marvellous bird, which burns its father or
  itself and then rises from its ashes in renewed youth, is no doubt a myth.
  But does not Pliny tell us of a real phoenix, which builds its nest at the
  sources of the Nile and shines like pure gold?"</p>

  <p>"What, seriously?" and she gently stroked the neck of the stuffed bird
  with her finger.</p>

  <p>"How soft it feels!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Like crape from Cos,"<a href="#235">235</a> said Aurelius, doing the
  same. His hand touched hers, and Claudia colored. She hastily stooped over a
  book lying close by&mdash;the "Thebais" of Statius&mdash;and read the title,
  written in gold on the outside of the roll.</p>

  <p>"A capital work," said the Batavian, "I read it some time since in
  Trajectum."</p>

  <p>"And to me, a Roman, it remains unknown."</p>

  <p>"If you only desire it, I will go to-morrow morning to the bookseller in
  the Argiletum and bring you the best copy I can find."</p>

  <p>"Oh! you are too kind!" replied Claudia.</p>

  <p>Then there was a pause, while Aurelius examined with the greatest interest
  the quality of some flaxen cloth from Cordova. At last he began
  hesitatingly:</p>

  <p>"If you will not think it too bold, allow me to pro&shy;pose..."</p>

  <p>"Speak on," said Claudia, again bending over the "Thebais."</p>

  <p>"I should be only too happy, if I might be allowed to read this
  masterpiece of Statius aloud to you. With&shy;out wishing to boast, I have
  had a good deal of practice in reading and declamation, and,&mdash;as you
  know, epic 236 poetry was originally intended for recitation."</p>

  <p>"Of course; it is for that very reason called epic. I may own too, that
  there is nothing I like better than to hear good reading. Quintus reads very
  well, but he rarely has time or is in the humor."</p>

  <p>"You will allow me then?"</p>

  <p>"I beg you to be so good."</p>

  <p>"And when?"</p>

  <p>"That we will settle presently; just now, I see, they are going to
  table."</p>

  <p>"Where have you hidden yourselves?" cried Lucilia flying into the hall as
  lightly as a deer. "I have been seeking you everywhere. Come, make haste; I
  am des&shy;perately hungry."</p>

  <p>"She is hungry!" thought Claudia with a glance up to heaven. "I hardly
  know whether to envy her or to pity her!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p>THE meal was ended; Cocceius Nerva had proposed the health of Cornelia as
  the heroine of the day. After offering a libation, according to the ancient
  custom, he invoked the favor and mercy of the Immortals on the young girl;
  then he rose and left the triclinium. The whole company followed him, to
  listen to the sweet tones of soft music in the fresher air of the peristyle,
  and to walk up and down on the inlaid marble floor, chatting in low tones.
  Bronze lamps shed their light from between the Corinthian pillars, and the
  stars shone down from the cloudless skies; in the court itself a confidential
  twilight prevailed.</p>

  <p>"Now, my sweet Claudia, tell me, how do you like Trajan?"<a href=
  "#237">237</a> whispered Lucilia in her sister's ear as she stood
  meditatively by the fountain.</p>

  <p>"I have only seen him to-day for the third time&mdash;how can I
  judge?"</p>

  <p>"To me he is quite too delightful. What a pity that he is already
  married.&mdash;To be sure, even then he would be too old..."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?" said Claudia absently.</p>

  <p>"Why, you seem to have forgotten that he was consul a long time ago."</p>

  <p>"Was he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, with Glabrio. How often your father has spoken of
  him."</p>

  <p>"I do not happen to remember it."</p>

  <p>"To be sure, we were still in the nursery, and stories of Cupid and
  Psyche<a href="#238">238</a> interested us more than the virtues of a
  statesman."</p>

  <p>Claudia sighed: "Happy childhood!" she said sadly.</p>

  <p>"Nerva even&mdash;old Nerva&mdash;thinks great things of him," Lucilia
  went on, without observing this diver&shy;sion. "He calls him his son, and is
  always ready to lis&shy;ten to his counsels&mdash;and in fact it is well
  worth while to listen to what Trajan has to say. You cannot think how
  cleverly, how wisely and judiciously he can talk. And at the same time he is
  so honest, so simple, so un&shy;pretentious! No one would imagine from his
  appear&shy;ance, that he once was the commander-in-chief of all the forces in
  Germany, with unlimited authority, and *on a glorious victory."</p>

  <p>"Where in the world did you acquire all this infor&shy;mation as to his
  merits?&mdash;Whenever I looked across at you, you were chatting with Caius
  Afranius."</p>

  <p>"Cneius, not Caius."</p>

  <p>"I thought it was Caius. Considering it was your first meeting, your
  conversation with this Afranius was somewhat eager."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I had met him before&mdash;a week or more ago; do you not remember?
  The day you had a headache. He is intimate with Cornelius. He has been in
  Rome since the beginning of March, and is already beginning to play an
  important part in the Forum."<a href="#239">239</a></p>

  <p>"Is he a jurist?" asked Claudia.</p>

  <p>"A defender of the oppressed and accuser of the criminal!" answered
  Lucilia warmly. "He has even gained a cause, quite lately, against Clodianus,
  Caesar's adjutant. His eloquence and powerful argument won him the victory,
  in spite of all his adversary's art, and the impression he made was so
  tremendous, that for the moment every one forgot how dangerous it is to have
  Clodianus for an enemy. The whole Basilica<a href="#240">240</a> shook with
  the applause."</p>

  <p>"Did he himself tell you this?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not! I heard it from Ulpius Trajanus."</p>

  <p>"And that no doubt is what makes you think Trajan so amiable?"</p>

  <p>"Silly child! Do you suppose...? You know, my dear, that when folks are in
  love, they see the whole world from one point of view."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean that you would say with Theognis of Megara, that amiable
  poet:<a href="#241">241</a></p>

  <p class="verse">'Temper the pangs of love and assuage the torments, O
  Goddess,<br>
  That gnaw my heart! Oh! restore my joy and contentment.'"</p>

  <p>"You are incorrigible!" said Claudia.</p>

  <p>But Lucilia, with a merry twinkle in her eye, laid her hand on her
  companion's shoulder, saying softly: "Ah! fluttering heart, it is vain to try
  concealment! Your Lucilia's experience and knowledge of mankind can see
  through every disguise. 'Restore my joy, bring Aurelius to my side.' It is
  the wolf in the fable&mdash;he comes softly down on his prey with a tender,
  elegiac grace! Sigh again&mdash;with Sappho this time:</p>

  <p class="verse">'Woe is me! my tremulous heart beats faintly<br>
  Thou art near! My faltering voice refuses utterance even!'"</p>

  <p>And she glided off, while Claudia stood gazing fixedly at the sparkling
  water in the basin. In her somewhat hasty retreat, Lucilia ran up against the
  broad back of Herodianus, who was clinging convulsively to the back of a
  chair with both hands, and leaning over it gazed up, as if spellbound, in
  silent contemplation at the star&shy;spangled sky.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, old sinner,"<a href="#242">242</a> said the girl
  saucily, as she passed on; but a deep sigh from the freedman made her
  pause.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, oh! boon companion from the North? Are you suffering
  from apoplexy? or do you wish to become a mathematician?<a href=
  "#243">243</a> Why are you staring so dolefully up at the Pleiades?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! sweet mistress what is it the Greek sage says? 'All things flow
  away.'<a href="#244">244</a> I too am flowing away. I do not know how I
  feel."</p>

  <p>"The wine-cup could answer that perhaps," suggested Lucilia.</p>

  <p>"No indeed&mdash;my feeble constitution to be sure&mdash;and that Caecubum
  was excellent. Perhaps it has flowed through all my limbs&mdash;but with all
  respect be it said, I am used to that.&mdash;And a sense of
  propriety&mdash;but you see, mistress, I cannot stir from the spot, and at
  the same time&mdash;oh no! it is not the wine, for I feel full of lofty
  ideas; my head is clear&mdash;uplifted, I might say, to Olympian
  heights&mdash;like Pelion piled on Ossa. Oh fair lady! you who are kindness
  itself, allow me to ask you one question!"</p>

  <p>"Speak, you shameless toper; but first sit down, for I foresee the moment
  when, if you do not, the chair will slide away on the polished pavement and
  you will fall on the top of it."</p>

  <p>"You are right, mistress&mdash;and it is all in my knees! my miserable
  legs&mdash;you are very right, the pavement is slippery. Why are pavements so
  polished, I wonder? Very well, then I will sit down. Excuse me if I seem to
  have some difficulty in doing so.&mdash;The gods have doomed the fat to labor
  and sweat.&mdash;There, now I am seated."</p>

  <p>"By Lyaeus,<a href="#245">245</a> but you are a scandal! Here, even here,
  in the house of Cinna, where temperance reigns supreme..."</p>

  <p>"Temperance is good&mdash;I knew that long ago, fair Lucilia.&mdash;But
  now, lend me your ear. Who&mdash;who&mdash;was that magnificent creature that
  splendidly-developed woman who sat at the end, quite at the bottom of the
  table, not far from your worthy&mdash;your&mdash;what is her
  name&mdash;Baucis. She wore a brown dress&mdash;an elegant bracelet clasped
  her arm..."</p>

  <p>"Who can you mean?" asked Lucilia, looking round her; Herodianus also
  looked about.</p>

  <p>"There, there she is," he whispered rapturously: "She is talking to Ulpius
  Trajanus. Ye gods! what a form! what grace and dignity!"</p>

  <p>Lucilia made a desperate effort and swallowed her laughter.</p>

  <p>"That?" she said, irresistibly tempted to carry on the jest: "That short,
  stout woman by the pillar?"</p>

  <p>"Just going into the hall."</p>

  <p>"That is Chloe, who brought up our sweet friend Cornelia. She is a native
  of Antium, the daughter of a freedman, six and thirty years of age,
  unmarried, and possessor of a little fortune&mdash;what more can heart
  desire? In truth, Herodianus, I admire your distin&shy;guished taste: that
  round face, that short fat throat, that wide mouth&mdash;wider even than
  mine&mdash;are these not heaven-sent gifts from Cypris herself?"</p>

  <p>"To me she is divine. Past the first bud of youth, mature in body and
  mind; Chloe stirs my soul to feel&shy;ings, which till this hour I had never
  appreciated. Fifty years old&mdash;and even now unblest with the joys of
  family life! Oh Chloe! Chloe! If only you had crossed my path earlier!...
  I... I might not have drunk so much Caecubum and Falernian! When Hymen opens
  his bosom to receive us, the rock of offence fades away... Alas mistress, if
  the spring-tide of life could but blossom for me once more! If I could again
  rest my head on the bosom of a loving woman...! Tra&shy;jectum, city of my
  heart, home of my youth! I remem&shy;ber to this day how my mother for the
  last time cut my hair. It was up in the little corner room. How long, long
  ago! Oh! if only I were away, far away from here! What have I left to live
  for in this world? A cup of wine! Oh! woe is me!"</p>

  <p>And he began to cry copiously, but noiselessly.</p>

  <p>Lucilia thought it advisable to leave the man's strange mood to run its
  course. "Is it in earnest or a mere craze?" she thought, as she shook her
  head. Then she danced off to join Cornelia, who was sitting under the arcade,
  listening with half indifferent attention to the muttered counsels of
  Baucis.</p>

  <p>"What Pythian wisdom are you uttering now, O blue-robed Baucis?" asked
  Lucilia, patting, the slave&shy;woman lightly on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Wisdom that you would do well to profit by," retorted Baucis. "A new veil
  or an amusing book is, I know, dearer to you far than the most sacred
  oracles."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? Who told you that? Chatter away in all confidence!&mdash;on the
  contrary&mdash;if what you told me the other day about Barbillus,<a href=
  "#246">246</a> the priest of Isis, is true..."</p>

  <p>"I was just speaking of that very thing. Our noble Cornelia is astounded
  at the extraordinary miracle. Exactly at the very moment, that Barbillus had
  foretold, I fell in a swoon, as he had r,aid, and saw the myste&shy;rious
  vision. I saw the goddess floating above me in shining white. O, ye
  immortals! I knew of course that it was not she herself, only her image in a
  dream; for how should Isis, the all powerful, condescend to come down to me,
  a humble slave, and to speak with me&mdash;and in Greek too! Still, I could
  almost have sworn that it was she, I saw her so plainly&mdash;the folds of
  her silvery robe, and her noble and gentle face, so lovely,, oh, so lovely!
  as beautiful as you are, noble Cornelia. Xo, I maintain it; I will never
  apply to any other priest than Barbillus, the favorite of the gods. He will
  reveal my whole future life to me&mdash;only think, noble Cornelia, for the
  ridiculously small price of two hundred sesterces&mdash;but I did not happen
  to have so much about me just then. Besides&mdash;what can I expect should
  happen to me at my time of life? My dear Quintus has his sweet Cornelia; our
  darling Claudia sooner or later&mdash;well, well, I meant nothing&mdash;and
  you, bright Lucilia&mdash;I cannot be anxious about you. You bear your own
  happiness in yourself. Well, so I said very; humbly: 'Oh! my lord,' said I,
  'no future lies before me. But I will tell the fair Cornelia, betrothed to
  our Quintus, that you are a true prophet&mdash;our Cor&shy;nelia, who is so
  full of melancholy fancies, and who prays so fervently and humbly to the
  beneficent god dess.' Then Barbillus gave me this precious amulet.&mdash;It
  is only made of horn, but the power that resides in it makes it
  precious."</p>

  <p>Cornelia had listened to her in silence, and her face was as pale as
  death.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she began after a pause: "You are advanced in age and rich in
  experience, and for many a year you have had to do with the chosen servants
  of the goddess. What do you advise me? Last night I had a dream<a href=
  "#247">247</a>&mdash;a mysterious dream. I was standing alone on a vast
  untilled plain; everything was deserted and silent. There was not a tree, not
  a shrub, not a herb&mdash;rotting bones and nothing else lay hideous on the
  ground, but far away on the horizon shone the walls and towers of a splendid
  town."</p>

  <p>"That is full of meaning," observed Baucis.</p>

  <p>"Listen to the end. As I gazed at the distant and radiant city, I felt my
  heart swell with fervent and un&shy;speakable longing. I struggled
  breathlessly to get for&shy;wards, but my feet seemed rooted to the ground. I
  was seized with terror, and trembling with fear I looked up&shy;wards; there
  I saw Quintus, high above me, but coming across the waste like Helios in the
  sun- chariot, and beckoning to me lovingly. I struggled, I groaned, I
  screamed. In vain! I held up my hands and cried out with the fervor of
  anguish: 'Isis, mother of the universe! Isis, save me!'&mdash;But the goddess
  was deaf. At last, after a long agony, I heard Chloe's voice; the good soul
  was standing by my bed. I awoke groaning..."</p>

  <p>"A hideous dream," said Baucis.</p>

  <p>"And when I question my heart, it seems to me that it bodes evil."</p>

  <p>"Folly!" laughed Lucilia. "I have dreamed worse things than that a hundred
  times, and no great event has ever happened to me. What does it mean? Why,
  that you were lying uncomfortably, or had read some&shy;thing the day
  before..."</p>

  <p>Cornelia rose gravely.</p>

  <p>"My dearest, you are not cross with me?" cried Lucilia following her.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Cornelia with a polite smile. "No, indeed, certainly
  not," she added less coldly, as her eyes met Lucilia's affectionate glance.
  "Come, let us be moving. Such discourse ill-beseems a festival, and to-day is
  to be a festival, my birthday."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Caius Aurelius had found a pretext&mdash;in agreement with his
  promise to Cinna&mdash;for taking Quin&shy;tus Claudius into his host's
  study, and a minute later Cinna himself came in, accompanied by Marcus
  Cocceius Nerva.</p>

  <p>"At last!" cried Cinna when all were seated. "It has been sticking in my
  throat like a mouthful of poison. Quintus, you too must hear what I have to
  say. The facts are perhaps known to you, for the house of Titus Claudius is
  ultimately allied with the palace..."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing, I can assure you," interrupted Quintus, somewhat
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"Well then, hear them now. I know you to be a young man of proved courage
  and of excellent understanding.&mdash;Until now you have taken the darkness
  for light and bitter for sweet, as not discerning them; your father's strong
  spirit has influenced you, and his errors of judgment have descended to you.
  But now, my friend, use your own judgment, and ask yourself on your honor: Is
  Rome still Rome?"</p>

  <p>"You really excite my curiosity," said the young man, with more reserve
  than ever.</p>

  <p>Cornelius Cinna shut the doors; then he went on in a mysterious and
  trembling voice:</p>

  <p>"It was last night. Happily for you, Nerva, your ailing health had taken
  you into the country, and so saved you from the worst. I was lying in bed,
  but I could not sleep; I was tormented by a ceaseless whirl of confused
  thoughts, and was on the point of calling to Charicles, that he might read to
  me. Suddenly I heard heavy blows on the house door... 'Porter, wake up, make
  haste, a message from Caesar!'"</p>

  <p>Cocceius Nerva leaned forward eagerly in his chair; his breath came
  quicker and deeper as he listened. Cornelius Cinna went on.</p>

  <p>"My bedroom door was opened, so I heard every word. I heard the porter
  refuse admittance. 'Caesar requires your master's presence at the palace,'
  said a voice outside. I sprang up and ordered him to open the door. I had
  hardly time to throw on my toga, when Caesar's messengers came into the
  atrium&mdash;men at arms belonging to the Praetorian Guard. 'Our god and
  mas&shy;ter Domitian<a href="#248">248</a> requires you to attend
  immediately,' said the officer. 'Is the state in danger?' I asked angrily.
  The soldier shrugged his shoulders; 'I do not know,' he said; 'our orders are
  to fetch you; no reasons were given. Do not delay, noble Cinna, the litter is
  at the door.'"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;Unheard-of!" murmured Nerva, passing his fingers through his grey
  hair.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to refuse; my own chair and bearers were ready&mdash;'That will
  not do,' said the soldier: 'You are to come alone, with no followers.' Cinna
  with&shy;out followers! I considered a moment, but only for a
  moment&mdash;then I had decided.&mdash;The situation was serious, I looked on
  the whole thing as a plot 'Caesar,' said I to myself, 'counts on your defying
  him, and hopes thus to find a pretext for your destruction&mdash;long since
  determined on. He will avail himself of that. He shrinks from dealing you an
  arbitrary blow for no reason at all, for he knows that the Romans love you,
  and he dreads the public resentment. Hence, if you refuse to obey, you will
  supply him with an excuse...!' Well&mdash;I obeyed... Cornelius Cinna obeyed!
  And after all it might concern the weal or woe of the state.&mdash;As a
  pre&shy;caution, however, I hid a phial of poison in my dress and then I told
  the men at arms that I was ready."</p>

  <p>"You acted very wisely," said Cocceius Nerva.</p>

  <p>"It was the wisdom of necessity. Now, listen to what seems incredible.
  When I reached the palace, I was received by slaves dressed all in black;
  they led me into a hall hung with black, where I found all the leading men of
  the senate and of the knightly order assembled and waiting in agonized
  expectation. They all, like me, had been abruptly fetched from their beds and
  brought thither in litters sent by Caesar. Presently we were desired to sit
  down, and a black column was placed in front of each man, with his name
  engraved upon it. Two sepulchral lamps were then lighted and youths, dressed
  in black, performed a solemn dance, and a funeral banquet,<a href=
  "#249">249</a> served on black dishes, closed the hideous farce. Caesar
  himself, calm and haughty, took the head of the table. Every one seemed
  paralyzed; each one expected to meet his death the next instant. Sextus, who
  sat by my side, was sobbing like a woman. I whispered to him to be
  calm&mdash;that the whole thing was a mere brutal jest, but he was not to be
  convinced and broke into tears."</p>

  <p>"He is but a coward&mdash;I know him well!" said Nerva.</p>

  <p>"A stammering child! As for me, I really do not know myself, what gave me
  a conviction from the very first, that we were in no danger. Caesar would
  talk of nothing but things which referred to death and murder and yet, in
  spite of that, my confidence grew each mo&shy;ment. But I was burning with
  rage, with revengeful fury, that I could scarcely control or conceal."</p>

  <p>"I wonder indeed that you could bear it," cried Nerva, drawing a deep
  breath. "Knowing you as I do, it is nothing less than a miracle."</p>

  <p>"A miracle indeed! But the Fates would not have it that Cornelius Cinna
  should fall into so stupid a trap.</p>

  <p>&mdash;I mastered myself. At last Caesar rose from the table and dismissed
  us, and the guard escorted us home again.&mdash;I was choking with shame and
  wrath. What am I, my friend Nerva, that I am to submit to such treatment? Am
  I a Roman or no? Am I Cornelius Cinna&mdash;or a slave, a dog? Was such base
  buffoonery ever heard of even under a Nero, or Caligula? Nay, my endurance is
  at an end! Sooner would I be a street porter in the meanest suburb,<a href=
  "#250">250</a> than remain senator under the burden of this intolerable
  yoke!"</p>

  <p>He sank back in his chair with a groan, and covered his face. There was a
  long pause, which Quintus was the first to break.</p>

  <p>"What!" he said with a scowl. "Did Caesar dare to do such things? I have
  long known, that he was liable to fits of extravagant whims and fancies,
  but&mdash;as I understood&mdash;only in his treatment of the foes of the
  throne. I believed in the wisdom of my venerable and learned father, when he
  assured me that some injustice, both apparent and real, was inevitable in the
  conduct of so vast an empire; that the good of the commonwealth was paramount
  over the fate of individuals.&mdash;But now, by the gods, Cinna! but if your
  indignation has not painted the picture too darkly "</p>

  <p>"Too darkly!" exclaimed Cinna starting up. "To be sure, you are the son of
  Titus Claudius. But hear me to the end. Hardly had Charicles once more put
  out the lamp, when I again heard a knocking at the door. Would you believe
  it? another message from Caesar. His gracious majesty this time sent me the
  fel&shy;low who had led the dance in black as a present, and begged to know
  how I had liked the midnight supper. By the great name of Brutus! A tipsy
  reveller never spurned a beggar with more utter contempt;<a href=
  "#251">251</a> in the first burst of anger I could have flung the boy on the
  ground. But I recollected myself. Cornelius Cinna will never let the weapon
  atone for the arm that wields it..."</p>

  <p>Nerva rose and clasped his excited and angry friend in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Be calm," he said in a deep voice. Then, going up to Quintus he said
  loftily:</p>

  <p>"And you, noble youth, give me your right hand in pledge of silence! Not
  that Cornelius Cinna has said anything that need shun the light of
  day&mdash;but you know the danger to which freedom of speech is exposed. His
  indignation and bitter feeling must remain a secret..."</p>

  <p>"A secret? and why? To-morrow I propose seeing Caesar at his great
  reception. I will hear from his own lips the meaning of this mysterious
  midnight banquet. I will insist on satisfaction for Cinna..."</p>

  <p>"Madman, what are you thinking of?" cried Nerva horrified.</p>

  <p>"Of my duty&mdash;rely on my discretion. Caesar owes something to
  me..."</p>

  <p>"Domitian owes you something!" laughed Cinna scornfully. "Do you not know,
  that he hates those most who have rendered him a service? Do not I know it by
  my own experience?"</p>

  <p>"It is worth trying, at any rate," said Quintus. "But now allow me to
  breathe the fresh air; I am suffocating in here." And as he spoke he unbarred
  the door and quitted the room.</p>

  <p>"You must dissuade him!" said Nerva, as the door closed upon him.</p>

  <p>"He is mad," said Cinna, Then, turning to Aurelius, he went on: "You, my
  friend, go now and mingle with the guests. Amuse yourself, refresh and rest
  your&shy;self. You are young, and youth claims its dues.
  To&shy;morrow&mdash;you know&mdash;at the house of Afranius..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," answered Aurelius, drawing a deep breath, "and I thank you,
  noble friends, for honoring me by admitting me to your society and
  confidence."</p>

  <p>He went slowly out into the atrium, where the dark&shy;ness was but dimly
  broken by a few lamps hanging un&shy;der the colonnade. A cold chill fell on
  his heart, for, from the peristyle, he heard a girl's voice singing a
  grace&shy;ful melody to the chords of a cithara. It was the same air that had
  charmed his heart before now, at Baiae&mdash;the Spring song of Ibycus; it
  was the same voice&mdash;the voice of his beautiful, adored and peerless
  Claudia. These few weeks had wrought an entire change in him. He had been
  unresistingly drawn into the vortex of two en&shy;gulfing passions. On one
  hand was the noble girl whom he worshipped and perhaps might never win, on
  the other were the proud nobles men inspired with the most fervid patriotism,
  who had taken him spellbound as by some sacred magic; the champions of
  liberty, of manly dignity, of proud Roman virtue, among a degen&shy;erate
  rabble of slaves. What a storm and whirl of feel&shy;ing in the present, and
  what a struggle to be fought in the future!</p>

  <p>He stood still to listen; a faint murmur coming up through the peaceful
  night, was all that could be heard of the tumult of the busy city that
  surrounded them, and the sweet girlish voice rose clear and strong&mdash;as
  pure and holy as though in all the earth there was no such thing as sorrow,
  as remorse and crime. The song, as it soared up fresh and strong from the
  innocent soul, seemed to rise to heaven in atonement for the infinite
  wickedness of the two million souls in the city, and for the foul and bloody
  deeds of its tyrants. Aurelius quivered in every nerve, and tears sprang to
  his eyes; but he instantly struck his breast resolutely and defiantly, and
  dashing his hand across his wet lashes, went through the corridor into the
  peristyle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p>IT was the middle of the second vigil&mdash;between ten and eleven o'clock
  at night by our reckoning of time&mdash;and the house of Cornelius, Cinna was
  sunk in silent re&shy;pose. The lamp in the peristyle was extinguished, and
  the last guests&mdash;Claudia, Lucilia and Quintus&mdash;had left about half
  an hour since</p>

  <p>There was a sound of steps in the colonnade soft, cautious, and
  mysterious. Two women wrapped in large cloaks went to the back door,<a href=
  "#252">252</a> followed by a sturdy slave.</p>

  <p>"Oh! my sweet mistress," whispered Chloe, as she opened the little gate,
  "you may believe it or not, but my knees shake beneath me. If your uncle were
  to dis&shy;cover us...! It would be the death of me!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" replied Cornelia. "My uncle is sound asleep. And even if he
  were to find out..."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes! I know very well, you are not afraid of his anger. And in fact
  what could he do to you? But I&mdash;ye merciful gods!&mdash;Are you quite
  certain that the priest expects us?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly certain. Aspasia brought me a quite distinct message."</p>

  <p>"Well then&mdash;I wash my hands in innocence. It is fearfully dark out
  here&mdash;I shall be truly thankful, if nothing dreadful happens to us."</p>

  <p>"Silly thing! The Temple of Isis is quite near at hand, and Parmenio is
  with us."</p>

  <p>Chloe closed the door behind her and sighed deeply; still she made one
  more attempt to stop her mistress. "Must it be to-day?" she said
  plaintively.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this very hour. When the day is done in which the dream was seen,
  the seer's power is gone. You heard Baucis say so."</p>

  <p>"Baucis!" said Chloe contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"She only repeated the priest's words. Make haste; minutes are precious.
  Go in front, my good Parmenio."</p>

  <p>They went down the street and turned to the right along a narrow alley,
  which zigzagged between high walls and led them to the back of the temple of
  Isis. They presently reached the vestibule of Barbillus, where a slave was
  waiting behind the door with a gilt lantern; he bowed low and led them,
  without speaking a word, to an upper room.</p>

  <p>Barbillus&mdash;a man of marked eastern type, handsome and tall, with
  waving locks, like an oriental Zeus&mdash;received his guests with an
  admirable combination of affability and dignified reserve. He desired Chloe
  and the astonished slave to wait in an outer room, while he opened a side
  door and led the way into another.</p>

  <p>Cornelia followed him with a beating heart, through a perfect labyrinth of
  dimly-lighted rooms and corridors, till at length they came into a hall
  mysteriously fitted up as a sanctuary, and well calculated to impress the
  senses with a magical spell. Dark curtains, embroidered with dead silver,
  hung over the walls on every side, and in a niche, on a silver pedestal, sat
  a statue of the god&shy;dess closely wrapped in veils, while, to the right
  and left of the figure, magnificent censers stood on brazen tripods. A lamp
  hanging from the star-spangled ceiling cast a ghostly blue light on the
  scene.</p>

  <p>"Pray here, my daughter," said Barbillus in a deep voice; " beseech the
  all-merciful mother of the universe to enlighten our spirits; mine, that I
  may see and speak, thine, that thou mayest hear and learn. I will leave thee
  to meditate alone, fair Cornelia." And he quitted the room, slowly closing
  the tapestried door.</p>

  <p>Hardly had he left her, when Cornelia sank on her knees in fervent
  devotion. The mystical surroundings, the dim blue light, the perfume of
  incense,<a href="#253">253</a> which loaded the air with stupifying
  sweetness, and the veiled and silent presence of the divinity&mdash;all
  combined to impress her profoundly. Her heart was full to bursting.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the air was filled with a sound as of the music of the spheres. A
  delicious harmony seemed to proceed from the walls, the floor beneath her,
  and the statue itself, and to cradle her soul in lulling witchery; while, at
  the same instant, pale tongues of flame broke out over the two censers and
  danced fitfully, but, as it seemed, lovingly up to the shrouded goddess.</p>

  <p>"Isis! O Isis!" sobbed the girl, raising her snowy arms to the divinity.
  "First-born of the ages!<a href="#254">254</a> Highest among the Immortals!
  Sovereign lady of departed souls! One and perfect revelation of all the gods
  and goddesses! Almighty Queen, whose nod the heavens and earth obey! Eternal
  Power, who art blest under a thousand forms and by a thousand names, by the
  sages of every land! Hear, O hear me! I have all thou canst bestow of earthly
  joys; I am young, fair and rich, and have the love of the noblest and best
  heart that beats among the youth of Rome! And yet, one thing is lacking to
  me, O Goddess! One thing, which I crave of thy mercy with floods of tears:
  Peace, inward, all&shy;sufficient peace of heart. Isis! mother of heaven,
  hear me! Over my head there lowers a forecast of evil; my spirit wanders
  groping in darkness. Thou hast sent me a dream, a warning; but alas! thine
  ignorant child strives in vain to read it.&mdash;Teach me thyself to know thy
  will; reveal thyself to me! Give me peace and the calm beatitude, the grace
  of heaven! Save, oh! save me! All that I dare call mine must ere long
  fade.&mdash;The storms of time must sweep it away! Give me salvation, the
  true love which is eternal! Isis, all-loving Isis, have pity on me!"</p>

  <p>The goddess's veil was lifted a little from her face; half-appalled, half-
  fascinated, Cornelia gazed up at it. A tender radiance like moonlight fell
  upon the pale, marble features, and a benevolent smile parted the lips. But
  be&shy;fore the tremulous worshipper was fully aware of what was happening,
  the light vanished, the veil was softly dropped it was all gone like a dream,
  and the music as suddenly ceased. Cornelia was aware of a violent shock as of
  an earthquake. Hardly mistress of herself, she closed her eyes and pressed
  her forehead against the pedestal of the statue. When she looked up again,
  Bar&shy;billus was standing by her side in a white robe<a href="#255">255</a>
  made of byssus tissue, and he smiled as he held out his hand to her.</p>

  <p>"The goddess has heard your prayer," he said in an agitated voice. "Tell
  me now what the vision was, and listen to the words of her servant."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he drew the curtain aside from a stud&shy;ded door, and led
  Cornelia up a narrow stair to an attic room, where he carefully closed the
  shutters and desired Cornelia to be seated on a couch. No sooner had she
  obeyed, than the tapers on a small altar were lighted&mdash;as the censers
  before had been&mdash;without any visible agency.</p>

  <p>Barbillus knelt down, bowing his face over a sacred book which lay
  unrolled between the tapers, and he re&shy;mained in this position, while
  Cornelia related her dream. Then, after putting up a silent prayer, he
  suddenly went up to the girl, bending down over her in such a way that she
  could perceive the small tonsure<a href="#256">256</a> on the crown of his
  head in the middle of his dark curls.</p>

  <p>"Daughter!" he said, as he drew himself up again, "your dream betokens no
  good. A fatality is hovering over you and yours, which can only be averted by
  the direct intervention of the goddess. To this end it is needful that you
  should, for the next four weeks, bring an offering daily at the same hour as
  to- night. Gold, in&shy;cense and roses are pleasing in the eyes of the
  divinity."</p>

  <p>"I knew it, oh! I knew it," groaned Cornelia. "Not for nothing has my
  heart been held in a cold and death&shy;like grasp! But, tell me, what is the
  meaning of the desert place, of the shining city, and of my lover's
  ap&shy;pearance?"</p>

  <p>"All this I will tell you, when the month is out. Trust me, daughter, and
  do that which you are en&shy;joined."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I will do it!" cried Cornelia ecstatically, and she pressed the
  priest's hand to her lips. "My pearls, my jewels&mdash;everything will I
  sacrifice joyfully, if only I may appease Fate. Ah! my lord, you could never,
  never guess how sad my soul is! Tell me only one thing, I entreat you, does
  the danger threaten me through my beloved Quintus?"</p>

  <p>The priest closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I dare not answer you," he said with an effort. * My part is only to
  announce inevitable doom; when I am still permitted to hope that the favor of
  the all&shy;gracious mother may yet prevail, silence is the first duty of my
  office."</p>

  <p>"Well then, I must submit. Meanwhile&mdash;as a proof of my infinite
  gratitude&mdash;accept this trifling offering. Pray for me, Barbillus,
  intercede for me with the almighty goddess."</p>

  <p>She gave him a costly brooch set with rubies, emeralds and
  chrysolites,<a href="#257">257</a> and as she stood&mdash;her eyes cast down
  in maidenly shyness&mdash;she did not see the flash of greed that sparkled
  under the Asiatic's long fine lashes, giving place immediately to the lofty
  and dignified expression, that usually characterized him.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, my daughter," he said graciously. "I will offer the gifts on the
  shrine of the goddess. And you too, my child, do not fail to entreat the
  immortals that all may yet be well."</p>

  <p>He gave her his hand, and led her by a circuitous route" back again to the
  anteroom, where Parmenio stood in a corner, as upright as a soldier on guard,
  while Chloc had gone to sleep in her comfortable seat. "Come," said Cornelia,
  shaking her by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>Chloe started up.</p>

  <p>"You have been a long time," she exclaimed. "It cannot be far short of
  midnight."</p>

  <p>Just as the three were about to step out into the street again, a female
  form flew past them, and close be&shy;hind, puffing and panting, ran a man,
  while farther away, where the streets crossed, they heard loud laughter.</p>

  <p>"Give it up, the roe is too fleet 1" cried a coarse bass voice, and the
  pursuer turned on his heel, while two other men slowly came to meet him. All
  three were wrapped in thick cloaks,<a href="#258">258</a> with the hoods
  pulled down in spite of the heat. For a second Cornelia hesitated; then she
  boldly went forth and walked past the strange trio. They were talking
  together in an undertone, and yet not so softly but that Cornelia could hear
  a few words.</p>

  <p>"By Pluto!" said one. "There goes a beauty! I saw her face, as the boy's
  lantern lighted it up."</p>

  <p>"Aphrodite is gracious," said the second, "to give us a substitute for the
  one who has escaped. I am just in the mood for an adventure. Let us follow
  the fair one."</p>

  <p>Cornelia hastened her step, but before she had reached the main road she
  was surrounded.</p>

  <p>"Well, pretty pigeon," a harsh voice croaked in her ear. "Out and about so
  late! And where are you fly&shy;ing, if I am allowed to ask?"</p>

  <p>Cornelia was at once aware, that .these were not highway plunderers, but
  idle adventurers, and evidently men of rank and position. This at once
  restored her presence of mind, and she walked on faster than ever. But in
  vain. The man who had addressed her, a stout figure of medium height, with an
  extraordinarily confident and swaggering address, came close up to her and
  laid his left hand on her shoulder to detain her. Furious in&shy;dignation
  boiled in her soul; she shook herself free and stood still.</p>

  <p>"Parmenio," she said resolutely, "as you love your life, do as I bid
  you&mdash;I, the niece of the illustrious Cor&shy;nelius Cinna. The first man
  who dares to lay a finger on the hem of this robe&mdash;strike him dead."</p>

  <p>"That can be done in no time!" cried Parmenio, taking the bold intruder by
  the throat. The other two started back as if struck by lightning.</p>

  <p>"Mad fool, you shall die on the cross!" shrieked the man he had seized,
  directing a well-aimed blow with his fist. The slave dropped his arm in
  terror. There was a ring of such wild and tiger-like ferocity in the harsh
  tones, that the sturdy nature of the man was for the mo&shy;ment paralyzed.
  Cornelia and Chloe meanwhile had reached the high-road; Parmenio caught them
  up in a few strides, and they reached home safely under cover of the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"You helpless idiots!" exclaimed the worsted victim, feeling at his
  throat. "What do you mean by staring as if it were a good joke, when a
  villain throttles me? You, Clodianus, have I loaded you with every honor and
  heaps of gold, that you should leave me in the lurch in this fashion? Take
  that for your loutish cowardice!"</p>

  <p>And Domitian flew at him with the fury of a panther, and struck him a
  tremendous blow in the face. Clodianus shrank back.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me!" he stammered, groaning with pain and rage. "I was so
  confounded at the man's dar&shy;ing..."</p>

  <p>"Away! traitor.&mdash;Never let me set eyes on you again."</p>

  <p>"Nay, pardon, my lord!" entreated the other, forgetting all else in his
  dread of losing his place. "Pardon and grace, my lord and god, I beseech
  thee. Do not withdraw thy favors from the most faithful of thy
  ser&shy;vants."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord and god," added Parthenius, the chamberlain. "Forgive us,
  for nothing but reverence and consternation could have betrayed us into such
  a crime. Do not let it spoil a jovial night. It is the first time for long,
  that we have wandered through the streets in disguise, and shall a spiteful
  accident..."</p>

  <p>"You are right," interrupted the Emperor. "I was in the best of
  humors..."</p>

  <p>"Then bid it return. Even his moods must surely obey the sovereign, whose
  sway extends over the whole world</p>

  <p>"Curse it all! To think that of all women in the world... Cinna's
  niece?... I did not even know, that the old fool had a niece. Whose house had
  she come out of?"</p>

  <p>"That of Barbillus, the priest of Isis."</p>

  <p>"Ah ha! One of the praying ninnies, that the jug&shy;gler knows how to
  beguile so well! Capital! The girl pleases me. I should like&mdash;if it were
  only to spite the old curmudgeon&mdash;I hate Cinna like poison. He wants a
  lesson&mdash;he always carries his head as high as a con&shy;queror in a
  triumph. As if it were not in my power to see those haughty iron features
  flung in the dust at my feet&mdash;Parthenius, we will talk of that again.
  But now, away with all gloomy reflections, and long live folly!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, all thanks!" cried Clodianus, kissing the sovereign's hand.</p>

  <p>"Pull the hood over my face, so&mdash;now my cloak over my chin&mdash;and
  we will go back into the streets. I should like to see the man, who can
  discover Caesar in such a guise. We must find an adventure yet,
  Par&shy;thenius&mdash;<a href="#259">259</a> some mad and absurd diversion,
  if it were only that the lips, which pronounce the fate of nations, should
  kiss some swarthy negress."<a href="#260">260</a></p>

  <p>He led the way, and the others followed. Domitian did not see how his
  companions clenched their fists under their cloaks, nor hear the bitter
  curses, hardly ut&shy;tered by their quivering lips.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p>AT the hour when Cornelia was setting out on her expedition to the temple
  of Isis, Lucilia and Claudia, escorted by their brother, reached home. The
  Flamen was still at work in his study; his grave and anxious face could be
  seen through the half-open door, bowed over his table. Even the sound of
  steps, which rang through the silence of the atrium, did not interrupt his
  busy labors.</p>

  <p>Quintus hesitated; he would gladly have gone in to embrace his father, but
  after brief reflection he decided not to interrupt his late studies. He bid
  his sisters good&shy;night, waved his hand affectionately towards the
  motion&shy;less figure that leaned over the desk, and left the house. His
  slaves and freedmen were waiting for him outside.</p>

  <p>"All go home!" he said shortly.</p>

  <p>His people were accustomed to his moods, and no one was surprised. But
  Blepyrus reminded him, with a shudder, of the attack in the Cyprius
  street</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing," replied Quintus; "I am armed. Besides, who could expect to
  meet me to-night in the streets."</p>

  <p>So his followers went on their way through the <i>Forum Romanum</i>, which
  was still crowded with people, while Quintus turned northwards across the
  <i>Circus Flaminius</i><a href="#261">261</a> and the Field of Mars. He soon
  found himself in the heart of that city of marble, which Caesar Augus&shy;tus
  had created here as if by magic. A sombre blue overarched the labyrinth of
  pillars and domes, of friezes and statues, of groves and glades, where by day
  such motley crowds were busy. No light but the pale glim&shy;mer of the
  stars&mdash;whose mist-veiled brightness gave warning of the autumn
  rains&mdash;fell on the chaos of ill&shy;defined forms; the moon had not yet
  risen. Utter soli&shy;tude, utter silence prevailed. The listener could
  almost fancy he heard the rush of the river Tiber past the piers of the
  Aelian Bridge<a href="#262">262</a>&mdash;or was it only the plash of water
  in one of the many aqueducts<a href="#263">263</a> which, at that time, were
  so splendid a feature of the city? A myste&shy;rious dreamy whisper!</p>

  <p>Possessed by the sense of this stilly solitude, Quintus Claudius went on
  till nearly on the shore of the river. Under the avenues of trees it was
  blackly dark, and the air came up chill and damp from the stream; Quintus
  shivered slightly. Then he turned off in the direction of the <i>Via
  Lata</i>&mdash;the Broad Way, now the Corso. He did not know what mysterious
  influence had driven him out into the darkness and silence. He had felt as
  though he must fly from the vast mass of Rome, from its numberless market-
  places, its proud temples and basilicas&mdash;and now he was seized with
  homesickness for the familiar, beloved and hated hive of two million human
  souls. He shook himself. All that was most dissatisfied and contradictory in
  his nature rose clearly before his conscience. It was exactly in this way,
  that he had worked through all the systems of philosophy in turn&mdash;now
  flying from what at first he had eagerly run after, and now craving for what
  he had but just cast from him; one day an enthusiastic disciple of Epicurus,
  and the next a follower of the Stoics. But in neither of these views of the
  world could he find rest and refreshment for his truth-seeking soul. Zeno's
  contempt for all the joys of life seemed artificial to his ardent and poetic
  fancy, while the method and practice of Epicurus, ingeniously wreath&shy;ing
  the mouth of the pit with roses to cover the depths below, stirred in him an
  irresistible impulse to sound those depths. That old Sphinx we call Life
  offered him a fresh riddle at every step, while forever denying all
  possibility of answering them. Thus, by degrees, he had wandered into that
  moral <i>Via Lata</i>&mdash;that broad way along which almost every educated
  Roman of that day walked, for better or for worse; that path of
  scep&shy;tical indifference, which made short work of every meta&shy;physical
  belief, and lived so literally from day to day. Only a few men, like Titus
  Claudius the Flamen, clung to the old Latin religion and fulfilled its
  precepts in their highest sense, and so had effected a compromise with the
  needs of the times; most men looked down with contempt on the myths of
  popular belief without, however, being able to replace them by anything
  better. Nay, even the women of the educated class found no satisfaction in
  the worship they had inherited; they turned in crowds to the mystical rites
  of the old Egyp&shy;tian goddess Isis, to whom a number of magnificent
  temples had been erected so early as at the time of the first Caesars.
  Quintus himself had drank of that shallow stream, but had found no comfort in
  it.</p>

  <p>The shortest way to the house of Thrax Barbatus would have been across the
  <i>Alta Semita</i><a href="#264">264</a> and past the temple on the Quirinal.
  But Quintus made a detour; after his late experiences he was anxious to avoid
  the less deserted streets; and not merely because fate had made him the
  accomplice in a deed, which by the laws of Rome was punished with the utmost
  severity;. he could now no longer doubt that Eurymachus, Thrax Barbatus and
  Euterpe were attached to the sect of Nazarenes, and just at this very time
  the most stringent measures were in contemplation to suppress the disciples
  of the Nazarene. Indeed, if his father's views met with appro&shy;bation in
  the Senate, nothing short of a regular persecu&shy;tion must ensue. In that
  case his share in the escape and rescue of a Christian slave might very
  likely be con&shy;strued as treason against the safety of the state; and
  though Quintus felt no fears as to what might be the is&shy;sue for himself,
  the thought of his father's grief filled him with anxiety.</p>

  <p>He wrapped himself more closely in his ample cloak, and looked cautiously
  about him as he hastened along the northwestern declivity of the Quirinal
  hill. A company of the city-guard marched past him with an echoing tread, the
  smoke of their torches<a href="#265">265</a> blew hot in his face, but no one
  noticed or recognized him. The streets grew narrower and more tortuous, the
  houses more squalid, the whole neighborhood was visibly ple&shy;beian. At
  last he reached the old wall,<a href="#266">266</a> built so tradition said
  by Servius Tullius; this quarter, in the time of the emperors, was of the
  worst repute in all Rome. Quintus stole cautiously along under the wall, for
  a few drinking-shops were still open and busy. Wretched girls from Syria and
  Gades here plied their shameful trade by the light of flickering clay lamps,
  while wrinkled and watery- eyed old hags poured the muddy wine of
  Veii<a href="#267">267</a> out of red jugs. Drunken men lay snoring under the
  tables, and coarse songs were roared out from hoarse throats, half-drowned,
  however, by the uproarious shouts of two fellows who were playing the
  favorite game of odd and even<a href="#268">268</a> with copper coins.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the noise became three times louder than ever; there was a wild
  uproar, and piercing shrieks. The gamblers had fallen out over their petty
  stakes. After a short squabble one had drawn his knife on the other and
  stabbed him in the side. The wounded man fell, howling, on the ground and the
  assassin took to his heels. But the dancing girls, heedless of the
  catastrophe, began at once to rattle their castanets once more, and sway and
  whirl in their disgraceful pantomine.</p>

  <p>Quintus hurried on, filled with loathing. Never had the heartless turmoil
  of the great capital seemed so hide&shy;ous as at this moment, in this
  obscure lair of humanity. Was not this squalid tragedy a reflection of all
  Rome&mdash;of the vast and mighty metropolis, with all its crimes, its
  contempt for the suffering of others, its mad lust of pleasure? It was but a
  short while since he had wit&shy;nessed the very same scene, with more
  splendid surround&shy;ings and distinguished actors. For, had the events in
  Lycoris's garden been at all less horrible? Had not a man lain there too,
  bleeding and dying, while a prosti&shy;tute&mdash;aye! for the brilliant and
  elegant Gaul was nothing else&mdash;had bewitched a heartless crowd by her
  fascinations? There, no doubt, were all the splen&shy;dor and luxury of
  wealth&mdash;here the foul brutality of misery; but, at the bottom, they were
  the self-same thing, at the bottom each was a sign, easy to read, of
  degeneracy, decrepitude and decay.</p>

  <p>And suddenly Quintus felt transported, as it were, from the life which
  surrounded him, into a new and un&shy;familiar atmosphere and light; and,
  strangest thing of all, that light seemed to shine forth from a pale face
  that he had seen but twice in his life; from the face of the humble and
  despised slave, who had so loftily smiled down on his persecutors and
  executioners. Could it be that such a thing existed as some supernatural
  magic? Or was it only admiration for the fortitude of a heroic nature?</p>

  <p>It was about midnight, when Quintus readied the house the flute-player had
  described to him. It was one of those tall, ill-constructed houses,<a href=
  "#269">269</a> built by speculators to let in floors, and which abounded in
  the poorer parts of the city to the great risk of the public. Fairly
  sub&shy;stantial as to the ground floor, story towered over story till the
  topmost floor consisted of a single room, hardly better than a booth built of
  boards at a fair. The walls were cracked and sprung in many places, and here
  and there, where the wretched structure threatened to fall, the inhabitants
  had tried to prop them with beams, thus adding to their unsafe
  appearance.</p>

  <p>The musician met the young man at the entrance; ninety steps&mdash;which,
  but for Euterpe's little lamp, he could never have mounted without
  mishap&mdash;led him to her habitation.</p>

  <p>"Stop here!" said Euterpe, as Quintus was about to go up to the topmost
  floor. "Thrax Barbatus does not live quite under the tiles;"<a href=
  "#270">270</a> and as she spoke she knocked at a door. Thrax Barbatus opened
  it, looking calm, almost cheerful.</p>

  <p>Quintus entered a room, of which the neat and com&shy;fortable aspect
  quite delighted him. A three-branched lamp hung from the low ceiling; the
  walls were neatly colored of a reddish brown; small, but
  beautifully-exe&shy;cuted paintings of flowers and fruit, showed brightly and
  prettily against this background. The floor was covered by a carpet, somewhat
  worn, but so handsome as to tell of better days in the past. A table, a
  chair, a few low seats and a small chest of dark oak composed the
  furni&shy;ture&mdash;humble, no doubt, in the eyes of a Roman of rank, but
  still much better than Quintus had expected after climbing to such a
  height.</p>

  <p>"You are welcome to your servant's house," said the old man, to whom
  Quintus gave his hand. "We have looked for you with longing. I was almost
  afraid you might have repented..."</p>

  <p>"You had my word that I should come," said Quintus.</p>

  <p>He sat down on a wooden bench, and Thrax Barbatus went to a door at the
  other end of the room, which he opened. and called out: "Glauce."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes a young girl came into the room. Her face was sweet and
  pleasing, but bore traces of weeping; her brown hair fell loosely over her
  shoulders, and her tunic was ungirdled. Worn out with the anxiety and grief
  of the last few days, she had sunk on her bed and fallen asleep, and now,
  standing in the door-way, dazzled by the light and confused by the presence
  of the noble stranger, she was a pretty picture of maidenly bashfulness and
  timidity.</p>

  <p>"Come, my sweet child, and welcome the protector of Eurymachus," Thrax
  began in caressing tones; "this noble youth is Quintus Claudius, the friend
  of the help&shy;less. He will save the persecuted victim, and obtain his
  freedom from Stephanus, and procure him Caesar's pardon."</p>

  <p>Glauce stood motionless for a moment; a faint flush tinged her cheeks.
  Then, weeping loudly, she flung her&shy;self into her father's arms and hid
  her face on his shoul&shy;der. Euterpe, meanwhile, had set a wine-jar and a
  dish of fruit on the table.</p>

  <p>"It is but little, but heartily offered," she said smil&shy;ing, "and
  after your late walk you will not refuse such slight refreshment."</p>

  <p>Then, taking a pine-log from the hearth-place, she struck the floor three
  times at short intervals.</p>

  <p>She listened&mdash;all was still.</p>

  <p>"He is asleep," she said to Thrax, who had soothed his daughter's sobs,
  and now took a seat by the brightly&shy;lighted table.</p>

  <p>"He has earned it!" said Glauce.</p>

  <p>Euterpe repeated the knocking, and this time with better success. Some one
  could be heard moving below. In two minutes the stairs creaked, and a
  weather-tanned figure of middle height cautiously entered the room. Euterpe
  met him and respectfully introduced him to Quintus. "This, my lord, is my
  husband," she said modestly. "He too had a share in the bold attempt in the
  park, for he has the greatest reverence for Eury&shy;machus."</p>

  <p>"To be sure&mdash;I recognize you! It was you, who offered the fugitive
  your arm to help him up the narrow path to the top of the ridge."</p>

  <p>Diphilus gazed astonished into the young man's face.</p>

  <p>"It is true, my lord," he said hesitatingly. "But how should you know
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I was nigh at hand. If I had come forward, I could easily have
  stopped the way."</p>

  <p>Diphilus sank on to the seat by the side of Thrax -with an expression of
  unconcealed astonishment, fixing his eyes on the young man's face, as if to
  stamp the fea&shy;tures of this mysterious ally indelibly on his memory.</p>

  <p>Thrax Barbatus now solemnly extended his bony hand over the table, like a
  speaker beginning his dis&shy;course. Then he said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"Above all, my friends, remember that in Rome every stone has eyes and
  ears,<a href="#271">271</a> and the thin walls of a lodging-house are as good
  as a spider's web to the spy."</p>

  <p>The flute-player drew closer to her husband's side.</p>

  <p>"It is only too true," she said with a sigh, "I could almost have
  sworn..."</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Diphilus.</p>

  <p>"That our pursuers are on our traces already."<a href="#272">272</a>
  "How?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, it is only my feeling about it. I am always in a state of mortal
  terror."</p>

  <p>Thrax Barbatus shook his head doubtfully. "Your fears are unfounded," he
  said emphatically. "Not a man in Rome knows of our intimate relations with
  Eurymachus. My poor son, who left his home when he was hardly more than a boy
  and did not return for twenty years, when his own father scarcely recognized
  him&mdash;no, Euterpe, the still face of the dead will betray nothing." He
  passed his hand over his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I know," replied the flute-player. "And yet..."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked the old man glancing hurriedly round.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" said Euterpe, "I am afraid I was rash. Scold me, but I could not
  help it; when I heard that Philippus had been buried in the ground set apart
  for criminals and outcasts,<a href="#273">273</a> my heart was fairly broken,
  and I vowed that his grave should not be left bare of some pious offering. So
  this evening, at the end of the first vigil, I stole out to the Esquiline
  hill, carrying a conse&shy;crated palm-branch hidden in my dress to lay on
  his grave. I found it after a short search, laid the palm upon it, said a
  short prayer, and came away. Suddenly I heard steps and voices; I hurried on,
  but they followed me, and as chance would have it I met a Htter with
  torch-bearers. The light fell full on my face, though I turned away. At the
  same moment I heard one of the men, who followed me, begin to run. Then I was
  seized with mortal terror; by the temple of Isis in the <i>Via
  Moneta</i><a href="#274">274</a> I turned off to the left, and ran so fast
  into the next street, that I could hardly get out of the way of two women,
  who were at that instant coming out. The darkness protected me; I escaped and
  got home by a roundabout way. If the men who followed me were the city-watch,
  it does not matter. But supposing they were some of Stephanus' people; they
  all knew me at Baiae, where I often played before their master. Oh! tell me,
  most illustrious patron, what shall we do if my fears are realized?"</p>

  <p>These words were addressed to Quintus, for she saw that Thrax Barbatus was
  deeply touched by her loving attention to the dead, and she wished to escape
  being thanked.</p>

  <p>Quintus Claudius, notwithstanding his strong sympathy with Thrax and
  Eurymachus, could not feel quite at his ease in his new and strange position.
  The idea that he&mdash;the member of a senatorial family, the son of one of
  the noblest houses in the empire&mdash;should make common cause with
  artisans, freedmen and slaves, was so preposterous in the state of society
  then existing, that even a lofty and magnanimous nature required time to
  enable it to subdue the sense of strangeness and even of repulsion. After
  some hesitation he addressed himself to Thrax, asking him&mdash;as though
  half conscious of a wish to justify himself in his own eyes:</p>

  <p>"And will you answer for the perfect innocence of Eurymachus, on your
  solemn oath and pledge?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Barbatus, "he is as innocent and pure as the sun in the
  sky. I will swear it by the soul of my dead son! Ah, you do not know his
  persecutor, the ruthless Stephanus&mdash;if you did, you would have no doubts
  in the matter. The crimes that man has com&shy;mitted during the last ten
  years, cry to God for ven&shy;geance like the blood of the massacred lamb of
  Bethle&shy;hem! I, as you see me, have been the victim of that wretch!"</p>

  <p>"You too? How did that happen?"</p>

  <p>"In the way which might be called 'the way of Stephanus.'<a href=
  "#275">275</a> I had inherited a little fortune from my father, and had laid
  it out at interest; I intended to save it and add a little to it for Glauce,
  for I could earn my living as a smith. You know, my lord, how badly free
  labor is paid in Rome; however, no pressure of want had ever made me touch
  that little dowry. I only spent the interest even during five or six years,
  to make a comfortable home for Glauce and give her some educa&shy;tion. Well,
  one day Stephanus produced a forged will, by which the money was left to him
  under some trivial pretext. He was a beginner in those days and tried his
  hand on small game, but since then he has grown greedy and gorges the
  fortunes of men of higher rank. How&shy;ever, everything turned out as was to
  be feared&mdash;false witnesses, cunning lawyers and bribed judges&mdash;I
  lost everything I possessed."</p>

  <p>"Atrocious!" exclaimed the young noble. "And did no one come forward to
  stand up for you? Did no young advocate defend the truth for truth's
  sake?"</p>

  <p>"No one. Oh! Stephanus went to work more craftily than you fancy. He
  bribed those, who might have opposed him, with imaginary legacies from the
  tes&shy;tator&mdash;some he frightened with mysterious threats&mdash;but in
  short, he has grown rich, a perfect Croesus, and all by forged wills.
  Hundreds of his victims have per&shy;ished in despair and misery. He shuns
  neither violence nor treachery; and he sins unpunished, for he has
  pow&shy;erful supporters. It is said that Parthenius, the
  cham&shy;berlain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough!" interrupted Quintus. "His hour too will come; it would be well
  for your safety, no doubt, that it should strike soon."</p>

  <p>"We are not idle," said Glauce. "My father has now found what he long
  hoped for in vain; a just and learned patron, whose liberality shrinks from
  no sacrifice. You must have heard of Cneius Afranius?"</p>

  <p>"Cneius Afranius? I know him very well, and have met him repeatedly in the
  house of Cornelius Cinna. He is making himself talked about..."</p>

  <p>"He has spoken in the Forum five or six times," interrupted Thrax with
  eager warmth. "His success was splendid.&mdash;Ah! and what a feeling soul!
  What a heart overflowing with noble unselfishness. Merely for the sake of
  right and enthusiasm for the truth, he is inde&shy;fatigable in his attacks
  on Stephanus, often as that cun&shy;ning fox has succeeded in parrying the
  stroke. Twice, when Afranius was on the very point of opening his case in due
  form, some inscrutable power has intervened to stop him.&mdash;However, if it
  is true, that dropping water wears away a stone, even Stephanus must some day
  come to grief."</p>

  <p>Quintus sat silent for some time; he seemed to wish to reflect at leisure
  on all he had heard, and no one dis&shy;turbed him.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said at last: "I too am ready to help you in my way, as
  honestly as Cneius Afranius&mdash;but first tell me one thing. Is Eurymachus
  still in Rome?"</p>

  <p>"In the neighborhood."</p>

  <p>"And you will not send him farther off as speedily as possible?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible, my lord," said the old man sadly. "Stephanus has set
  every means to work. Hundreds of watchmen and slave-catchers are on the
  alert; notices on the walls offer large sums for the apprehen&shy;sion of the
  fugitive; even appeals have been made to the Vestal virgins<a href=
  "#276">276</a> to pronounce their ban, so that he may be spellbound within
  Rome. In short, discovery would be certain..."</p>

  <p>"It is so indeed, my lord," added Diphilus. "And do you know why Slephanus
  is making this mighty stir? Eurymachus knows some secret of his life, some
  hide&shy;ous crime, worse than all the rest he has ever committed. And it was
  for that reason, that even on the scene of his execution Eurymachus was
  gagged."</p>

  <p>"And moreover," added the old man, "in his flight that night he wounded
  his foot badly. He could not leave his hiding-place at present, even if he
  wished it."</p>

  <p>"And what can I possibly do for you in these cir&shy;cumstances?"</p>

  <p>"Procure his pardon, my lord!" cried Glauce, lifting her hands
  imploringly.</p>

  <p>11 Or a mild punishment," added Diphilus.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Thrax went on, "you might even be able to help Afranius,by
  removing some of the obstacles which hinder the course of justice. Your
  illustrious father&mdash;cannot he do anything he chooses in such matters?
  And will not his generosity pardon Eurymachus for escaping, if you are his
  advocate? I know, of course, that Titus Claudius is the foe of the common
  herd; often, indeed, he has exercised the sternest severity towards guilty
  slaves; still, he is wise and far-seeing&mdash;at fitting times he can be
  merciful too..."</p>

  <p>"I will see what can be done."</p>

  <p>"God's blessing rest on your head!"</p>

  <p>Quintus looked keenly at the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said after a short pause; "am I mis&shy;taken, or do you
  belong&mdash;as appearances would indicate&mdash;to the sect of
  Nazarenes?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Barbatus, "in speaking to the gen&shy;erous preserver of
  our Eurymachus, I may surely forget that prudence compels us to keep our
  religion a secret. Yes&mdash;I will freely confess it, I am one of those
  highly&shy;favored ones, whom the people designate as Nazarenes. We are
  Christians&mdash;I and mine&mdash;for so we call our&shy;selves after the
  founder of our sacred religion, who suf&shy;fered death under Pontius Pilate.
  Diphilus and Euterpe too have received baptism, the act of dedication which
  seals our reception under the covenant of faith. We are Christians, my lord,
  and no power on earth will ever lead us back to the altars of your idolatrous
  worship. Caesar may revive the times of Nero, he may stigmatize as criminals
  humble and innocent beings, whose only ambition is righteousness; he can
  never stay the spread of the Kingdom of Heaven. Nay, indeed, most noble
  youth, but I tell you that every drop of blood that is spilt, raises up new
  witnesses to the eternal and divine truth of our belief."</p>

  <p>The old man ceased. His withered cheek was flushed.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Quintus, looking down. "But tell me one thing; does not your
  creed contain the dangerous doctrine of equality? Does it not remove the
  ancient landmarks between the high-born and the lowly, between the freeman
  and the slave? Does it not aim at the subversion of society and the
  destruction of the ex&shy;isting state of things?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord; we do aim at the destruction of all that must inevitably
  fall, if the Kingdom of the Lord is to come. We teach the equality, freedom
  and brother&shy;hood of all men born of woman. But what is this but a return
  to primitive truth, to undisguised nature? Nothing can oppose us, but the
  power of custom or of self-interest; God himself, and all that is best in
  man, is for us. Where and when did a higher power ever give you chosen ones a
  right to cast your brethren into fetters? Where is it written: 'You are the
  master, and this other man, who feels joy and pain as you yourself do, is
  your slave and shall bow down to you?' It sounds bold, I know, O Quintus; but
  I ask you: What essential dif&shy;ference is there between the son of the
  Claudia family and the hapless Eurymachus? That which sets you above him is
  purely fortuitous; that which constitutes your equality, is the divine will
  and act of God. Or do you really believe, that a slave can never be wiser,
  cleverer, more virtuous, courageous, and generous than the offspring of a
  senatorial house? Supposing you had been changed in the cradle, do you
  imagine that all the world would have read the slave's humble birth stamped
  on his brow? Nay, noble youth! The distance between you, that looks like a
  gulf, is merely an artificial division, an illusory effect of fancy, which
  must vanish before the light of the new revelation. We, even we, the sons of
  the people&mdash;even those who are bondsmen and slaves, who toil and suffer
  in your factories and prisons<a href="#277">277</a>&mdash;all, all are alike
  called to be the sons of God. 'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy
  laden,' saith the Saviour, 'and I will give you rest.' Yea, and his call
  shall not be in vain. Thousands and thousands answer to it.<a href=
  "#278">278</a>&mdash;In remotest Asia, in Egypt, in Greece, nay, even in
  Hispania and Lusitania, whole armies of mar&shy;tyrs are suffering for the
  cross&mdash;our symbol and token, to you Romans an ignominious instrument of
  death, but to us the emblem of hope and promise!</p>

  <p>"And you too&mdash;the rich, the noble, the sovereigns of the world do you
  need no comfort, no healing, no saving light? Are you indeed so happy in your
  splen&shy;dor? Have you no secret craving for something, that shall be
  eternal? The time will come, when you too shall bow the head before the tree
  of disgrace and mar&shy;tyrdom, when you too shall know how gloriously the
  carpenter's son of Nazareth has solved, for us, the dark riddle of human
  existence. You will soar above the dim confusion of the fleeting present, to
  the realms of hope and faith and divine grace."</p>

  <p>It was with a strange feeling of spellbound astonish&shy;ment, that
  Quintus gazed into the speaker's face, which was radiant with solemn but
  triumphant peace. Glauce had gently leaned her head on her father's shoulder,
  as though it was in him that she sought and found her mainstay in the
  struggle with life; and in spite of the mournful feeling which still left its
  traces round her lips, silent contentment lay on the pure young brow. She sat
  with downcast eyes, her hands folded in gentle ex&shy;haustion. Euterpe and
  Diphilus hung in rapt reverence on the lips of the old man, who, to them,
  seemed to stand in the light of a radiance from heaven.</p>

  <p>Quintus was unutterably impressed by the individu&shy;ality of this
  strong, resolute and triumphantly happy believer. His aversion to this new
  doctrine of the uni&shy;verse began to melt like snow on Soracte in a spring
  breeze. Vigorously as self-love rebelled, conviction proved the stronger. In
  his hours of solitude the same reflections had often occurred to him, and
  commended themselves to his feelings, but the denunciation of the existing
  state of things had never before been so boldly presented to him. It must be
  a stout heart and a pow&shy;erful mind, that could deny the intrinsic
  justification of a social order so complete as that of the Roman empire, and
  cry to a nation of nobles and slaves: "All men are brothers!" It would be
  worth while to see and hear more of this Nazarene Gracchus,<a href=
  "#279">279</a> and to sound the depths of the mysterious power, which gave
  such staunch vitality to the new doctrine, even after the fearful
  per&shy;secutions of Nero.</p>

  <p>All these reflections rushed in a tumultuous torrent through the young
  patrician's soul. He could no longer bear the confinement of the low, hot
  room. He rose, trying to conceal under a smile of careless politeness how
  deeply he had been interested and absorbed; he paced up and down the little
  room once or twice, and then said with a certain condescension:</p>

  <p>"I should be grateful to you if, at an early opportu&shy;nity, you would
  tell me more concerning your doctrine; I am always glad to gain information
  at the fountain&shy;head. For the present I bid you farewell. Early
  to&shy;morrow morning I shall do my utmost for Eurymachus; pray to your God,
  that He may crown our efforts with success."</p>

  <p>Euterpe conducted the visitor down stairs again, and then flew back to the
  little room where Glauce and Diphilus had already moved the table and
  arranged a little altar for an offering for the dead, on behalf of the
  luckless Philippus.</p>

  <p>While these good souls were kneeling in silent sorrow before the cross,
  Quintus walked homewards through the darkness with a throbbing heart; his
  head ached and a mighty struggle, such as he had never before
  experi&shy;enced, seemed to rend his heart. At the top of the Esquiline he
  came to a stand-still, and as he leaned against the basin of a fountain
  graced with spouting tritons, he gazed westwards over the night-wrapped city,
  which lay spread abroad at his feet, like a colossus prone in rest. He could
  scarcely distinguish theliuge build&shy;ings the Flavian Amphitheatre, the
  palaces and the capitol. Mons Janiculus<a href="#280">280</a> stood out like
  a darker storm-cloud against the blue-black sky, and a dull moan and murmur
  rose upon the air like the breathing of the sleep&shy;ing giant. A sense of
  infinite desertedness, of unspeak&shy;able longing and inexplicable dread
  fell upon him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ye noble souls!" he groaned, covering his face with his hands. "I
  will return&mdash;I will soon rejoin your peaceful and blissful circle! By
  all the anguish I ever suffered, by all the torment that gnaws at my heart, I
  swear I will return!"</p>

  <p>And with a sigh of relief like that of a man, who finds himself well again
  after long sickness, he went down into the valley.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p>ON a purple couch, her right hand supporting her handsome head, while her
  left played mechanically with the folds of her robe, lay the Empress Domitia;
  Poly-, charma, her favorite slave, sat in silence on the floor, holding in
  her lap a red and blue bird, which now and then flapped its wings and gave a
  loud, strange cry. All else was silent, oppressed by sultry gloom and the
  steamy stillness of the air. In spite of its nearness, the noise of the Forum
  was dulled to a murmur like that of wind-rocked trees. The marble statue of
  Venus<a href="#281">281</a> by the door-way looked sleepily down under her
  drooping lids; even the little Eros with his lightly-tilted jar, seemed
  touched with melancholy. Outside, in the corridors and antechambers, there
  was scarcely a sound. The slaves glided cautiously about on tiptoe, and spoke
  in whis&shy;pers or expressed themselves by signs. Their imperial mistress's
  melancholy mood seemed to fill the very atmosphere with a subtle malaise and
  anxious fore&shy;bodings.</p>

  <p>A few hours since, the first meeting had taken place between the
  reconciled couple. They had met with dignity and a calm semblance of friendly
  regard on both sides; but between them lay the unspoken but bitter certainty
  that, after all that had passed, no real recon&shy;ciliation could ever be
  possible. Caesar's suspicious nature recoiled from Domitia's superiority of
  intellect and vehement temper&mdash;which flashed ominously in her eyes in
  spite of conventional smiles and smoothness&mdash;and from the scathing irony
  of her proud and revenge&shy;ful spirit. She, on the other hand, knew the
  Emperor's hatred and implacable malice; she knew that, once aggrieved,
  Domjtian had the tenacity of a tiger in am&shy;bush, never weary of watching
  for an opportunity for the fatal spring. Added to this there was the
  remembrance of her own humiliations&mdash;her banishment from the palace, the
  execution of Paris, and the emperor's passion for his niece Julia. And now,
  to be forgiven by him whom she so thoroughly despised&mdash;to accept the
  clem&shy;ency of Domitian this was the worst and deepest humiliation of
  all...</p>

  <p>So, listless and silent, she lay on her pillows, reviewing in imagination
  the events of the last few hours in pictures that seemed to mock her as they
  passed. The Apollo-like figure of the young patrician, who had fired her
  fancy at Baiae, seemed to smile at her contemptu&shy;ously; she sighed and
  closed her eyes, as though to escape the vision. Till a few hours ago, she
  had be&shy;lieved that she had conquered that madness. Her spirit had found
  strength in resolving on revenge, and she had felt like a goddess bent on
  punishing the presumption of a mortal. But now&mdash;in this new
  mood&mdash;she was con&shy;scious of a subtle change, the desire for revenge
  re&shy;mained, but now there was nothing lofty, no sense of superiority in
  the feeling the&mdash;goddess had given place to a vain, lovesick woman, full
  of annoyance and petty spite. This change was a result of her altered
  cir&shy;cumstances; the sight of her husband had reminded her of the fact
  which she had striven to the utmost to ignore; that one word from that adored
  youth would have sufficed to make this reconciliation an impossibility. Shame
  and hatred, rage and passion, seethed in her soul, and her self-tormenting
  fancy painted alternately the most enchanting and the most horrible pictures.
  As in some hideous dream, the form and features of Quintus were mixed up with
  those of her former lover, the exe&shy;cuted actor. She saw herself in tears,
  kneeling wildly at his feet&mdash;he raised her, kissed her, her senses
  reeled. Then he scornfully flung her from him&mdash;she shuddered from head
  to foot, and stabbed him desperately with her poinard</p>

  <p>Then again she recalled the occasion, when Polycharma had returned to her
  with the little tablet that Quintus had given to the slave-girl in the park,
  the an&shy;swer to her last passionate letter that tablet had been her death-
  warrant but&mdash;no, not hers&mdash;his! "He must die!"&mdash;she seemed to
  see the words traced between those fatal lines.</p>

  <p>Then everything faded from her vision like a landscape shrouded in mist.
  Instead of the slave-girl, it was the flute-player, who stood before her with
  a triumphant sparkle in her eyes, as her cheek flushed under the traitor's
  touch&mdash;as she had seen her stand, the bold hussy, on the hill at
  Cumae&mdash;happy, no doubt, in the love that she, the Empress, pined
  for.</p>

  <p>The thought was intolerable; the miserable woman writhed under the clutch
  of the demon of jealousy. She groaned and struggled for breath. Polycharma
  started to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Lady, mistress&mdash;what is the matter?" she asked, gazing helplessly at
  Domitia's distorted features. But the sound of a voice broke the spell;
  Domitia controlled herself. Not a soul on earth, not even this trusted slave,
  should ever know how low she could be brought. She would hold herself proudly
  and defiantly&mdash;aye, though she should suffocate in the effort.
  Polycharma should suppose that the adventure in the gardens of Lycoris was a
  mere whim, a comedy; never would she betray the anguish of her unrequited
  passion and deep humili&shy;ation.</p>

  <p>She raised herself on the pillows and sighed deeply again, as if to prove
  that the groan which had escaped her had not been involuntary.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she said in a low voice, "that I am too much accustomed to
  liberty, ever to make myself happy again within the bars of this golden cage.
  I have too long been a free and unfettered woman, to have re&shy;tained any
  talent for being Empress. The marble walls of a palace weigh upon me like
  lead. Ah! Polycharma! I am longing already for my quiet retreat on the
  Quiri&shy;nal, or for Baiae and its delicious wilderness."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I understand that," exclaimed the girl. "Par&shy;ticularly for
  Baiae&mdash;is there a more heavenly spot on earth? The bench under the hedge
  of bay, with that lovely view over the blue sea! And when the full moon rises
  over the hill&mdash;it is beyond words, And do you remember the young knight
  from Mediolanum,<a href="#282">282</a> who recited to us the woes of Queen
  Dido,<a href="#283">283</a> and whom you permitted to kiss this white hand as
  his reward? He trembled like an aspen in the evening breeze. Ah! and
  Xanthios, the beautiful young Greek from Cumae! How desperately the boy was
  in love with me!"</p>

  <p>Domitia tried to smile.</p>

  <p>"Poor child," she said sadly. "And you too will find out what it is to
  live at Caesar's court."</p>

  <p>"Ah well!" said Polycharma airily, "by the grace of the gods, we will be
  able to retain some fragment of our lost freedom. Your steward is a very
  shrewd and clever man, and he will see what can be managed. And for your
  sake, Sovereign Mistress, he would be ready to burn down Rome."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;of course we all have our own ideas.&mdash;Stephanus lives and
  toils for nothing but your Highness, and for the glory of your name. It was
  he, who con&shy;quered Caesar's obstinacy and made your return possi&shy;ble.
  And confess, gracious mistress&mdash;Baiae may be lovely, and the evening
  hours in the park there were in&shy;deed delightful, but to share the throne
  of Caesar, the ruler of the world&mdash;that is yet more lovely and
  de&shy;lightful!"</p>

  <p>"Who can tell..." said Domitia.</p>

  <p>"Stephanus, at any rate, thought so."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean that he has always done his best..."</p>

  <p>"But it seems to me, that it is no more than his duty."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Still, there is a way of doing one's duty&mdash;a
  devotedness..."</p>

  <p>"What are you aiming at?" asked the Empress. "First you speak as if you
  wanted to keep silence, and then you break off as if you wished to
  speak..."</p>

  <p>"I only thought..."</p>

  <p>"Speak out boldly, Polycharma, and have done with this mysterious
  behavior, which is like the incoherence of a sibyl."<a href=
  "#284">284</a></p>

  <p>"By the gods! but I dare not. Besides I only guess at it; he could never
  be so bold..."</p>

  <p>"You are talking in riddles. Speak out; I command you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried the girl contritely. "How am I to say it? Stephanus is
  consumed by a hopeless passion. He is dying of silent love for the charms of
  his imperial mis&shy;tress."</p>

  <p>Domitia's features did not show a shade of feeling, and Polycharma glanced
  in terror at the expressionless face, for not the twinkle of an eyelash, not
  a twitch of the lips, betrayed what emotion might have been roused by this
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," replied the Empress after a long pause. "My steward is
  a faithful servant, and his zeal and devotion are seen by your youthful fancy
  in a too poetical light.&mdash;Go, have done with your foolish
  im&shy;aginings; take your lute, and sing me one of your gayest songs."</p>

  <p>The girl retired a little distance, and an arch smile lighted up her
  shrewd little face. She fetched the cithara out of its carved case and
  returned, lightly tuning the strings.</p>

  <p>"Some one is knocking," she said pausing, and she went to the door. "What
  is it? You know, Strato, that our mistress does not choose to be
  disturbed."</p>

  <p>A short whispered colloquy was carried on outside the curtain, that hung
  before the entrance; then Poly&shy;charma came to announce that Stephanus
  begged an audience on a matter of great importance.</p>

  <p>Domitia did not at once reply. Then she suddenly looked up, as if struck
  by some new idea.</p>

  <p>"Desire him to come in," she said eagerly. "Poly&shy;charma, leave us
  together."</p>

  <p>The same meaning smile again parted the girl's lips. She quietly leaned
  the lute against the wall and hastened to the door, where she lifted the
  curtain with mock ex&shy;aggeration of respect and let the steward pass in
  front of her. Then she slipped out, shut and fastened the door and joined two
  other slave-girls, who were sitting in the anteroom on red leather cushions,
  and carrying on a laughing flirtation with a flaxen-haired Sicambrian
  belonging to the Praetorian Guard.</p>

  <p>Stephanus stood just within the door and bowed low. It was difficult to
  recognize in him the cool and un&shy;blenching man, never at a loss in his
  perfect knowledge of court manners and gossip, and accomplished in the arts
  of intrigue. In Domitia's presence the freedman was a slave again; all his
  presence of mind, all the easy demeanor he had acquired in the school of
  life, he had left outside that door. The man, who went forward in obedience
  to a nod from the Empress, was a servile, creeping slave, a pitiable wretch,
  who tried in vain to find utterance.</p>

  <p>"What ails you?" asked the Empress with a fascin&shy;ating smile. "You
  look as pale as if you had lain awake all night. I fear your zeal prompts you
  to work too hard."</p>

  <p>"Gracious mistress," replied Stephanus, "I am distressed indeed if I
  intrude..."</p>

  <p>"I am always ready to listen to the faithful servant, who toils for me so
  devotedly. What brings you here, Stephanus?"</p>

  <p>The freedman was startled; if he had read aright Polycharma's cunning
  glance, this reception promised him such happiness, that the mere thought of
  it turned him giddy.</p>

  <p>"You hesitate," the Empress went on. "I understand&mdash;you fear lest
  there should be listeners in the anteroom. Your errand is serious and
  important."</p>

  <p>She rose and led the way to a side chamber. Ste&shy;phanus followed. The
  fairy-like fittings of the beautiful room had exercised an intoxicating charm
  over the senses even of a spoilt courtier like Stephanus. The whole boudoir
  was like a luxurious bouquet&mdash;walls, floor, ceiling were all hung and
  covered with diaphanous rose-colored stuff, on which sparkling stones were
  sprinkled like dew-drops. A tender twilight and the heady scent of roses
  completed the irresistible witchery of the scene.</p>

  <p>The beautiful creature, who stood in the midst of all this dazzling
  splendor, with her white arms faintly tinged with the rosy reflection, and
  her flowing drapery clinging closely to the grand forms of her limbs, might,
  without any great effort of fancy, have been taken for Aphrodite, the goddess
  of love, incarnate in this adorable person.</p>

  <p>Stephanus breathed hard; the empress sank on to a rose-colored couch, and
  beckoned him to approach.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said graciously, "we are alone, proceed."</p>

  <p>"Sovereign lady," said Stephanus, hardly possessed of all his senses, "my
  duty... An hour ago your humble servant was with Lycoris. She... I know not
  how...but lately we have met with some obstacle... it was only with the
  greatest difficulty that I succeeded... The cham&shy;berlain is this evening
  to be her guest... She promised me... but she made conditions..."</p>

  <p>"It matters not," said Domitia. "You will strain every nerve to engage
  Parthenius on our side, I know, and that is enough for me. The details I
  trust to your acumen. If you do not succeed the first time, you will try
  again. A failure, even a blunder, needs no excuses. You have my unlimited
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"I am overwhelmed by the greatness of your favors."</p>

  <p>He bowed to the ground and humbly kissed the hem of her robe, which fell
  in ample folds, leaving a small part of her sandal and snowy foot bare. A
  strange mix&shy;ture of pain and triumph lurked in her eyes, as the thought
  flashed through her mind: Ah, why, hapless, adoring wretch, are you not
  Quintus? But then a ter&shy;rible satisfaction gained the upperhand; her lips
  moved as she swore to herself an unspoken vow&mdash;she clenched her fist as
  though she held a dagger&mdash;a dagger for hatred and revenge. Stephanus
  could not know, that at that moment she had formed a sinister resolve.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;not that!" she whispered insinuatingly, as Stephanus rose
  again. "That is service to the gods. Among friends a frank and honest hand-
  shake..."</p>

  <p>As she spoke she offered the astonished steward the tips of her ringers.
  He looked into her eyes like one dazed. What a change! This unapproachable
  woman, this divinity&mdash;till this hour so cold and repellent, was now all
  melting softness, dreamy and tender gracious&shy;ness.</p>

  <p>"Adored lady!" he groaned, pressing her hand to his pale lips. "Kill me,
  but I can no longer conceal it! Death would be bliss as compared with the
  torment of silence. Glorious Domitia&mdash;more beautiful than
  Cypria&mdash;herself I love you!"</p>

  <p>He fell at the feet of the haughty sovereign, as though stunned by his own
  audacity, and leaned his forehead on her footstool. His brow by chance
  touched her foot, which she hastily withdrew with an involuntary gesture of
  aversion. But again a gleam of triumphant delight passed over her
  features.</p>

  <p>"Stand up," she said, dissimulating her excitement. "Your confession has
  taken away my breath. I hardly know whether I should be angry, or whether
  this heart&mdash;too tender, alas!&mdash;should forgive your boldness. You
  love me! It sounds sweetly simple, like the greeting of a friend but think
  out the whole meaning of that short and simple word, and tell rne then, if
  you do not tremble like a pine tree before the gale. Love craves for a
  return&mdash;answer me, Stephanus, do you esteem yourself so favored by the
  gods, as to dare to hope for Domitia's favors?"</p>

  <p>The freedman had slowly risen to his feet. His thin hair, artificially
  darkened, hung loosely over his throb&shy;bing temples; his eyes were fixed
  and glazed.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said in hollow tones, "that I am un&shy;worthy of your grace.
  But the gods themselves choose blindly, without any regard for merit and
  worth. Their mercies are dispensed blindfold not only Ares the slayer, but
  the humble Anchises..."<a href="#285">285</a></p>

  <p>"Enough!" said Domitia, who fancied she could still feel the hot, bald
  forehead against her foot. "If the gods have chosen, you need entreat no
  more. Lis&shy;ten to me, Stephanus. I too will be gracious&mdash;Call it a
  whim or sympathetic tenderness, as you please;&mdash;it is all the same. You
  shall clasp the Empress in your arms and be happy, Stephanus&mdash;on one
  single condition you shall realize your dream. But it will require the
  ut&shy;most exertion of your talents..."</p>

  <p>Stephanus heard no more; overpowered by this dazzling vision of happiness,
  he had fallen back on one of the rose-colored seats. His head thrown back,
  his eyes closed, he lay a pitiable image of human passion and weakness. The
  haze of unconsciousness veiled the strange and erratic brain, that was so
  unceasingly tossed and torn by cruelty, ambition, avarice, and sensual greed.
  The corpse-like figure, in its long Tarentine toga, was an object of
  unutterable horror in the beauty&shy;loving eyes of Domitia&mdash;the sharp
  chin, the eagle nose, the hard, fleshless brow, now no longer vivified by the
  sparkle of the fiery eyes, all filled her excited senses with the horror,
  that blooming and joyous youth feels for the bony hand of a skeleton. She
  almost repented of her decision. Still, the recollection of Quintus, gave her
  strength to deny herself the craving of her inmost nat&shy;ure, and to
  persist in the road she had set out on. Perhaps, too, she had a lurking hope
  that she might cheat the tool of her vengeance, of the promised reward.</p>

  <p>The steward did not remain unconscious more than a minute; when he opened
  his eyes, Domitia was mis&shy;tress of herself and the situation. With her
  right hand she commanded silence.</p>

  <p>"You need rest," she said kindly. "And what I have to say can be said in a
  very few words. Quintus Claudius, the son of the Flamen, has insulted me
  mor&shy;tally. How, where, and when, must remain my secret. Help me to
  triumph over this hated and unpardonable foe, and Domitia shall be yours.
  Throw your toils round him, watch him wherever he goes, miss no
  oppor&shy;tunity of ruining him.&mdash;How you will be able to
  ac&shy;complish this I cannot even guess, but you, I know, can do anything.
  Will you fulfil this commission?"</p>

  <p>"I will, sovereign mistress!" cried Stephanus in a choking voice. "Your
  hatred is one with mine, for I too loathe this man as if he were plague-
  stricken. He shall die under the dagger of my meanest slave, and when he lies
  gasping in the dust, I will cry to him: Re&shy;member Domitia!"</p>

  <p>The Empress started to her feet, and put out her hands with a gesture of
  horror.</p>

  <p>"No, oh no!" she cried vehemently. "Death by the hand of an assassin, the
  mean fate of a merchant waylaid and flung from his cart by robbers near the
  Three Taverns&mdash;that would be a satisfaction too mean for this aching
  heart! I must feast my soul on his misery, set my feet upon his neck. A
  dagger- thrust&mdash;what is that to him? Do you know the man and his proud
  contempt of life? Look but once in his face, and ask yourself whether I am to
  be avenged by a stab. He would die, as another man would get up and take his
  leave at a banquet; he would die, and then it would be no worse for him, than
  if he had never breathed. No, Stephanus; go and devise some better plan than
  that! wound him, crush him in that which he loves best; overwhelm him with
  disgrace; break his towering pride then you will have done all I can ask of
  your skill and devotion!"</p>

  <p>"I will try. As yet I have not the faintest idea of the way to do it, but
  I have no doubt I can find it. And when I have fulfilled the task you have
  set me "</p>

  <p>"In conquering my enemy, you will conquer my heart," said Domitia smiling
  graciously.</p>

  <p>"I will conquer or perish."</p>

  <p>He flung his toga over his shoulder with an air, and went to the door. The
  Empress watched him with a fixed, almost a vacant stare. No sooner had the
  cur&shy;tain fallen and the door closed upon him, than she dropped into the
  nearest seat, sobbing convulsively, and set her teeth deep into the cushion
  in which she hid her face, while a torrent of scalding tears rushed from her
  half- closed eyelids.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p>BEFORE Stephanus went through to the anteroom, where Polycharma was
  waiting with the other slaves, he paused a moment to recover his breath. He
  drew him&shy;self up, and his face resumed its usual expression of
  super&shy;cilious indifference. He now could measure with calmer blood the
  extent of his success; that which, a few min&shy;utes since, had deprived him
  of his senses, now filled his spirit with elasticity, and he told himself
  that he had selected, with infinite psychological insight, the mo&shy;ment
  for realizing his long-cherished purpose&mdash;the mo&shy;ment in fact, when
  her first meeting with her husband had shaken the proud woman's nature to the
  founda&shy;tions. He believed, that the happy result was obviously to be
  ascribed to this fortunate coincidence, and this doubled his good opinion of
  his own judgment. His glance lingered with supreme satisfaction on the
  magni&shy;ficent room, the statue of Venus, the little Eros and the purple
  pillows on the divans. The inarticulate language of the smile, that played
  upon his thin lips, was easy to interpret it told of his hope ere long to
  rule as master in this apartment, as the declared favorite of its lovely
  mistress&mdash;lovelier and grander than the marble goddess there, and oh! a
  thousand times warmer and more gracious.</p>

  <p>He dropped his right arm, letting his white robe sweep the ground like the
  mantle of an eastern prince, and went on to the anteroom. He favored the wily
  Polycharma with a gracious nod, marching past the other girls with the strut
  of a promoted peacock. The Sicambrian stared at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>The steward's apartments were on the farther side of the peristyle, on the
  side towards the Circus Maxim us. His offices were lower down still, on the
  Quirinal, where the Empress had been living since her separation from her
  husband, excepting when she went every summer to her villa at Baiae. The
  elaborate paraphernalia of official papers made a prompt removal impossible,
  and only certain small branches of the steward's business had as yet been
  reinstated in the palace.</p>

  <p>Stephanus went into his private room, laid aside his toga, and stretched
  himself at full-length on a comfort&shy;able couch. His restless brain was
  already seething with a thousand plans, which chased each other like a flight
  of crows. Numbers of impressions and motives, which hitherto had lurked
  unheeded, started up in his memory as possible starting points for future
  operations; but foremost of all the figure of Eurymachus, as yet
  ir&shy;retrievably lost, occupied his thoughts. To judge from the reports of
  the slaves, who had followed the fugitive, the behavior of Quintus Claudius
  had been strange enough to suggest its connection with the slave's successful
  escape, even if no direct connection existed. Stephanus dimly felt, that here
  lay the fulcrum for his lever&mdash;but how could he use it? Well, he had
  solved harder problems than this in his time. The son of so influential a man
  as the Flamen was, no doubt, a more difficult subject to deal with than Thrax
  Barbatus, whose cries had easily been drowned; still&mdash;the higher the
  obstacle, the greater the triumph.</p>

  <p>He lay gazing thoughtfully at the tips of his fingers. Wholly possessed by
  the idea of avenging Domitia, he had forgotten for the moment, that the
  escape of Eurymachus was of importance to him on far graver grounds, than the
  use he could make of it to injure Quintus; now, this consciousness pressed
  with double weight on his soul. He would have given half his fortune, to
  learn that Eurymachus was silent forever. By some accident, which to
  Stephanus remained an unsolved mystery, Eurymachus had learned a momentous
  secret.&mdash;Sup&shy;posing that now, when he was no longer gagged, he
  should make himself heard&mdash;supposing he should shout it out in the ears
  of the world. A hundred times did the steward curse the fatal idea, of making
  the execution of his slave an entertainment for Lycoris' guests. Quietly
  strangled, or thrown into a tank to feed the lam&shy;preys&mdash;that would
  have been the rational thing, and more like his usual good sense. To be sure,
  hatred and rage had spoken loudly, and Lycoris had entreated him so
  earnestly.&mdash;Still it was folly, madness. Who could tell what Fate might
  bring out of it, if such precious material should happen to fall into the
  hands of Cneius Afranius&mdash;that cruel vampire who, for more than six
  months, had had his clutches on the steward's neck. His eyes were fixed
  vacantly on the ceiling, as the long train of his crimes passed before him.
  Each separate deed ap&shy;peared clothed in flesh and blood, incarnate in the
  form of Cneius Afranius, who seized him by the hair and dragged him before
  the Senate; till, at last, the direst deed of all came forth and cried to
  Heaven, till the great city shook to its foundations, and Domitian himself,
  the blood-stained tyrant, hid his face in horror.</p>

  <p>Stephanus started up.</p>

  <p>"Be still, mad brain!" he exclaimed, striking his fore&shy;head with his
  fist. "I have been too easy; a prudent man should strike and hold; till now I
  only kept out of the way of the arrows of Afranius, now&mdash;let him see to
  it, that he hides himself from mine. Quintus and he! The same stroke may by
  good hap fall on both at once."</p>

  <p>He paced his room uneasily; suddenly he stood still&mdash;before him stood
  a lad with soft and girlish features.</p>

  <p>"Antinous!" cried the freedman. "You glide about like a weasel."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, my lord, but I had asked three times to be admitted. I heard
  you speaking to yourself..."</p>

  <p>"You heard?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word, my lord. You muttered through your teeth&mdash;only
  disconnected words&mdash;I thought you were vexed and angry with the
  slaves..."</p>

  <p>"And you came to comfort me?" asked Stephanus smiling. "It is well that I
  have you; for the next few weeks you will have heavy work on hand. Shut the
  door and sit down on the couch there."</p>

  <p>"Heavy work?" asked the boy disconsolately. "What, am I to carry water; or
  till the fields? Am I to be as miserable as the others are?"</p>

  <p>Stephanus laughed, and patted the lad's beardless cheek.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, my boy. I have chosen you for something better than that. What I
  have for you to do is serious and very difficult, but amusing and
  interesting; and if you accomplish the task, you shall be&mdash;well, you
  shall be free. Do you hear, Antinous, free? And rich besides, for I will give
  you an estate..."</p>

  <p>"My lord, you know that my devotion is boundless. Only a few hours since I
  risked my life for two thousand miserable sesterces..."</p>

  <p>"Not too rashly, I imagine. You thought that dis&shy;cretion was the
  better part of valor!"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, but you are mistaken. I rushed down upon him, when he was
  surrounded by his clients and slaves; and if I had not slipped away at the
  very in&shy;stant "</p>

  <p>The boy shuddered.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" asked Stephanus.</p>

  <p>"I do not know, but I shiver whenever I think of it. As I struck him, I
  met his eye&mdash;so cool and contemptu&shy;ous.&mdash;If at that moment he
  had seized me, I should have been lost..."</p>

  <p>"You are childish, Antinous. I am afraid, that if you are so excitable you
  will not earn your freedom in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"What, again must I?"</p>

  <p>"No, his life is spared. You must do more than that."</p>

  <p>"More?" said the lad in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Aye, more, boy. Why any bandit from the Appian Way could stab him; what I
  want you to do requires not only zeal, skill and courage, but intelligence,
  readiness, and the craftiness of Ulysses.<a href="#286">286</a> Greek blood
  flows in your veins<a href="#287">287</a>&mdash;you are at once panther and
  fox. You shall hear the details in the course of the day; I shall expect you
  to dinner with me here in the study. Enough for the present. Now tell me
  where you have been so long? You had no sooner told me that your blow had
  missed, than you rushed away again. I waited in vain... You really abuse my
  kindness..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! my lord, are you angry?" said the boy coaxingly. "Indeed, if I
  sinned, it was not from insolence, but from fear. I felt irresistibly driven
  to his house; I mixed with the people, that I might learn whether
  in&shy;formation had reached the prefects of the attack upon him..."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Up to the present hour no one knows of it. Quintus Claudius seems
  inclined to keep it a secret. Even the gate-keeper, whom I began to talk
  to..."</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" interrupted Stephanus. "Do you want to find yourself
  imprisoned and crucified?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, my lord. Antinous does not go to work so clumsily. When I stopped to
  talk to the gate-keeper, I was in girl's clothes."</p>

  <p>"It is all the same; the whole thing was aimless."</p>

  <p>"Not altogether, an accident rewarded my daring. Only think, as I was
  standing there talking over the weather&mdash;he took me, as sure as I am
  alive, for some street hussy&mdash;a woman came towards us through the
  ostium, with an old man with a snow-white beard. As soon as I saw her, I knew
  her to be that saucy Euterpe, who so often played the flute for us at Baiae;
  do you not remember? The pretty girl from Cumae, who al&shy;ways looked so
  shy and stupid, when you praised her shape "</p>

  <p>"Well, and what does she matter to me?"</p>

  <p>"Euterpe? nothing whatever; but the old man.&mdash;As they came past us, a
  vague remembrance crossed my mind. I said to myself: I must surely know that
  man. Then he used some little gesture, and at once I had found the trace. It
  was none other than Thrax Barbatus, that obstinate fool who wanted, a little
  while since, to force his way in to see you..."</p>

  <p>"Thrax! with Quintus Claudius?" cried the steward horrified. "Ah! I
  understand now! Claudius and Afranius are plotting together, to restore the
  old idiot to his rights. The Flamen's son has long honored me with his
  hatred. A reason the more, for disarming and dis&shy;abling him..."Then he
  suddenly checked himself, pushed his fingers through his hair, and
  scowled.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he began eagerly. "I have an idea. Was it not Euterpe, who
  troubled herself so much about Eurymachus, when I had him flogged?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure, Euterpe, the pretty Cumaean! He was supposed to be her lover,
  and while he was laid up she brought him herbs and salves; and she
  cried..."</p>

  <p>Stephanus drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"What more do you know of all this?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," said Antinous. "In Baiae I had something better to do, than
  to trouble myself about anything so commonplace as the love affairs of a
  flute&shy;playing hussy. At any rate, the noble Eurymachus does not seem to
  have been very eager. Astraeus heard him once scolding her soundly."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"It had something to do with her salves and oint&shy;ments. She had bought
  the stuff of some Egyptian magician, and that vexed her lover..."</p>

  <p>Stephanus nodded, and a gleam of malicious satisfaction lighted up his
  vulture face.</p>

  <p>"Ahl I was not mistaken," he muttered between his teeth; then, turning to
  the slave, he added: u And is that all you learnt from Astraeus?"</p>

  <p>"All."</p>

  <p>"Very good, then I will question him myself; I foresee great results. Go
  now, Antinous; my head whirls with a multiplicity of wonderful possibilities.
  Claudius, Afranius, Thrax, Euterpe&mdash;you must watch them all with the eye
  of an Argus."</p>

  <p>"My lord, your confidence in me makes me vain. You have only to command,
  and I will obey. I will climb the Capitol like the invading Gauls;<a href=
  "#288">288</a> I will dive to the depths of the sea and bring you a message
  from Thetis.<a href="#289">289</a> But then, do not forget your promise."</p>

  <p>"I will keep it," replied Stephanus, stroking the lad's cheek. "Freedom
  and gold are the charms, that give wings to your services."</p>

  <p>"You are the kindest master<a href="#290">290</a> in the whole Roman
  Empire! Farewell."</p>

  <p>He nodded to Stephanus with saucy familiarity, danced across the room with
  a graceful step, leaped lightly over one of the broad couches, and slipped
  out of the door like an eel.</p>

  <p>"Hail, all hail to thee, Quintusl" Stephanus muttered mockingly. "This is
  a better beginning, than I dared to hope for. And if Fortune continues to
  favor me, I will raise on this foundation such a structure as you need not
  disdain to take your pleasure in."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p>QUINTUS rose very early the morning after his visit to Thrax Barbatus, and
  the stars were still sparkling brightly, when he got into his litter and in a
  weary voice bid the slaves carry him to the palace. He almost fell asleep
  again within the curtains, so coolly and indiffer&shy;ently could he look
  forward to his interview with the awe-inspiring Caesar, who was always
  treated with a degree of cautious respect, even by his intimates and
  favorites&mdash;somewhat as a tame tiger is treated by its keepers. This
  coolness he derived from a sense of the justice of his cause; he was still
  young enough to have preserved that noble simplicity of a lofty nature, which
  attributes irresistible power to Truth, and which cannot use the specious
  defences, with which vulgar humanity is content to arm itself.</p>

  <p>In the outer court of the palace a tumultuous crowd had already
  assembled&mdash;of magistrates, senators, and foreign ambassadors. Quintus
  gave one of the chamber&shy;lains on duty<a href="#291">291</a> a note from
  the Flamen Titus Claudius Mucianus, to deliver to Caesar in his audience
  chamber, and so powerful was the effect of this venerated name, that Domitian
  granted an immediate interview to the young patrician, in the midst of the
  terrific pressure of official receptions.</p>

  <p>Quintus entered the presence chamber with a fearless and independent mien,
  but with the calm dignity and winning courtliness of the Roman
  aristocrat.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said, as a sign from the emperor bid him speak, "it is as
  the son of Titus Claudius, that you have so readily granted me a hearing, but
  it is as the future husband of Cornelia, the niece of Cinna, that I craved an
  audience. I stand before you as a petitioner. Cornelius Cinna, the
  illustrious senator&mdash;whose intrinsic value you must certainly have
  discerned, even under the husk of some singularities&mdash;is suffering under
  the sense of an insult, as he deems it. That midnight banquet, of which all
  Rome is talking, was of course, no more than a harmless prelude to the
  Saturnalia 292&mdash;the overflow of festive whimsicality. But Cinna, who is
  rigid and im&shy;pervious to all joviality, regards the jest as a humiliation
  and dishonor. It lies in your power, my lord, to efface this painful feeling
  from the noble senator's mind. One gracious word of explanation..."</p>

  <p>Domitian did not let the bold youth finish his sentence. The mere mention
  of the name of Cinna had been enough to set his blood boiling. And now, what
  was this audacious, seditious, rebellious suggestion?&mdash;If he still kept
  some check on his anger, it was that the grave, steadfast figure of the
  Flamen floated, unbidden, before his eyes, and compelled his respect for all
  who bore his name. Still, the glance he threw at Quintus out of his cunning
  green eyes gave grounds for reflection.</p>

  <p>"My dear Quintus," he said with forced composure, "our time is too
  precious for such follies. It is not Caesar's business, either to console
  Cinna or to offer him explanations. Remember that. And now leave us, lest the
  welfare of the commonwealth should suffer." With these words he turned his
  back on Quintus.</p>

  <p>Quintus was speechless; he angrily quitted the audience chamber, feeling
  as if every slave must read in his face how insultingly the emperor had
  treated him. Incapable from indignation, to judge accurately and fairly, he
  felt as a bitter disgrace, what was, in fact, the inevitable result of a
  false assumption. Standing apart as he did from the life of the court, and
  strongly in&shy;fluenced by his father's views, he had always regarded Caesar
  in too favorable a light; still, he might have been shrewd and judicious
  enough, to have understood the folly and impossibility of his preposterous
  suggestion; he might have told himself that, even under the most favorable
  conditions, only those, who have sinned unin&shy;tentionally, ever make
  advances towards reconciliation.</p>

  <p>From the palace Quintus hastened on foot to his father's residence, which
  lay at no great distance. He desired his clients and slaves to wait in the
  vestibule, and went first to the women's large sitting-room, where he found
  his mother and the two girls, with Caius Aurelius in attendance. The Batavian
  was holding a book in his left hand, and with an awkward blush on his face
  was standing near the window, while the ladies leaned ex&shy;pectantly on
  their couches.</p>

  <p>A shade of annoyance flitted across Claudia's brow as her brother entered
  the room; the young Northman flushed a shade deeper, and dropped the hand
  which held the roll as he, not too warmly, returned his friend's
  greeting.</p>

  <p>"I am disturbing a recitation," said Quintus apolo&shy;getically.</p>

  <p>"Oh! the day is before us!" cried Lucilia, and Oc&shy;tavia asked her son
  what had brought him so early to the house.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of much importance," said Quintus vaguely; " a request to my
  father. I am only waiting, till the atrium is perfectly clear. Pray go on
  reading, Aurelius. I will sit quite still in this corner and listen for a
  time. Meanwhile, will Lucilia fetch me a cup of mead;<a href="#293">293</a>
  my tongue is literally parched."</p>

  <p>"'He spoke, and the dark-browed Kronion nodded assent!'"<a href=
  "#294">294</a> quoted Lucilia, going to a side door.</p>

  <p>"Baucis," she called out, and gave her orders in a lower voice. Caius
  Aurelius, obeying Octavia's glance of re&shy;quest, had already unrolled the
  book again, and he now began to read in a full and pleasant voice. In truth,
  the much-lauded Papius Statius might have been satisfied. He himself, a
  master in the art, could not have read his own poem better or more
  effectively. Quintus was as&shy;tonished beyond words. What delightful tones,
  what various modulation, and above .all what supreme intelli&shy;gence of
  interpretation! and though Lucilia now and then struggled with a yawn, it was
  evidently from sheer physical fatigue, for it had been past midnight before
  she had gone to sleep.</p>

  <p>When Aurelius had got to the end of the second canto of the poem, Quintus
  drank the remainder of his draught of mead and desired old Baucis to enquire
  in the atrium, whether Titus Claudius had not yet received the last of his
  morning visitors and, hearing that his father was alone, he took leave and
  hastened to the priest's study. He found his father deep in work, even at his
  son's greeting he only just raised his head.</p>

  <p>"Welcome," said he without interrupting himself: "One moment,
  Quintus"&mdash;and his reed<a href="#295">295</a> went gliding on over the
  yellow paper. Then he laid it across a little metal rest and rose.</p>

  <p>"You find me dreadfully busy, my dear Quintus, he said affectionately.
  "Hardly am I left apparently in peace, when I am overwhelmed with a mass of
  work, that will bear no delay. I must take advantage of every minute, for a
  decision on the great question of the day is now imminent."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for that, father, for I came to you as a petitioner."</p>

  <p>"Speak on," said the Flamen smiling. "I must find time for my son."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, but I fear that my petition may be too trivial, to
  engage your interest at this moment."</p>

  <p>"Nay, so much the better. Small matters need few words. Speak plainly and
  at once."</p>

  <p>"You know," Quintus began, going a step nearer, "that the Empress's
  steward Stephanus is in pursuit of a slave..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said the priest frowning: "A criminal, who was forcibly set
  free by some unknown hand. All Rome is horrified at such unheard-of
  atrocity."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly unheard of, that such an attempt should succeed. To
  escape in the midst of such a crowd&mdash;the cowardly crew of Lycoris'
  slaves seemed thunder-struck."</p>

  <p>"Pah! who can say, if they were not concerned in the abominable
  conspiracy? My word for it, Quintus, all these villains have a secret
  understanding; they wait only for a watchword to rise and strike as one man,
  and to overthrow everything we hold sacred. If the state does not ere long
  exercise its authority in earnest, we shall have a Spartacus<a href=
  "#296">296</a> on the throne of Rome."</p>

  <p>"You are jesting, father. Shall the Roman empire, borne by the eagles of
  her legions to the uttermost ends of the earth, the unconquerable daughter of
  Ares,<a href="#297">297</a> tremble before her own slaves?"</p>

  <p>"She has trembled before now," replied Titus Clau&shy;dius. "Read the
  chronicles of the historians. The gladiator, who escaped with a handful of
  rabble from the school at Capua, collected an army, before the Senate had
  realized the fact. He beat the praetors, he defeated the quaestor Thoranius,
  he overran almost a third of the peninsula..."</p>

  <p>"Then, and now; think of the difference," exclaimed Quintus, to whom the
  unexpected turn taken by the conversation was most painful. "That was
  possible in the time of the Republic, but the strong hand of Caesar will be
  able to protect us. Besides, the slaves of our day lack the one thing
  needful&mdash;the irresistible Spartacus."</p>

  <p>"He will be forthcoming, when the time is ripe. In&shy;deed, from all I
  hear, I fancy a candidate for the honor has already been discovered. He is
  called Eurymachus."</p>

  <p>"Really?" cried Quintus, who was fast losing all his presence of mind. "Do
  you really think...?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my son, I do think... Does not the very mode of his rescue show how
  great and dangerous his personal influence must be? And I hear on all sides
  of this man's defiant tenacity, contempt of suffering, strength and
  endurance. It is out of such rough wood as this, that a Spartacus is hewn.
  And a Spartacus to- day is more dangerous than his prototype; he can command
  a more mischievous force, against which sword and spear are wielded in vain:
  that of superstition. I can&shy;not fail to see this plainly; for years I
  have watched the tendencies of the commonalty with all the keenness of
  suspicion. The creed of the Nazarenes ferments and spreads&mdash;the next
  Spartacus will be a Christian."</p>

  <p>"Father," Quintus began after a pause, "I know that in this instance you
  are mistaken. This slave&mdash;I happen to know certainly&mdash;never
  conceived such a scheme. Besides, it seems to me, that the acumen of our
  statesmen is somewhat at fault, when it makes that sect responsible for
  everything that shocks or shakes society..."</p>

  <p>"You do not know them," interrupted his father, and I do. Enough&mdash;we
  have digressed. What connection has all this with your request? Speak, for my
  time is precious."</p>

  <p>Quintus stood undecided. What could he hope for in this state of things?
  Well&mdash;he could but try.</p>

  <p>"Father," he began hesitatingly, "I came to speak in behalf of the very
  man, whom you are making every effort to brand as a Spartacus. I saw him two
  or three times in Baiae; he pleased me greatly, and I then de&shy;termined to
  buy him of Stephanus. Then this most un&shy;lucky business occurred, and I
  lost the slave whom I had already begun to think of as my own. When I tell
  you, that Stephanus deliberately and maliciously tortured and punished him;
  when I swear to you solemnly, that the sentence of death..."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked his father coldly; "speak and have done."</p>

  <p>"Well, father; I want to become possessed of that slave at any price, and
  I ask you whether, in the event of his being captured, it would not be
  possible to miti&shy;gate the rigor of the law..."</p>

  <p>"You astound me! For a mere whim you would endanger the state, cut a
  trench in the dyke which alone is able to protect us against the flood of
  rebellion? And you ask me&mdash;ME&mdash;to be your accomplice in such a
  proceeding? I admit, that Stephanus is brutal and tyrannical, nay&mdash;from
  my point of view&mdash;criminal. But then, are there not laws to protect
  slaves against such barbarities?"</p>

  <p>"Laws, yes&mdash;" cried Quintus bitterly, "but they do not exist as
  against the rich and powerful."</p>

  <p>"Every earthly thing is of its nature imperfect. If Stephanus defies the
  law, that does not justify us in leaving the crime of Eurymachus unpunished.
  I lament deeply, that my own son should so utterly misunderstand the first
  and highest principles of my views of life. Go, my dear Quintus, and for the
  future consider twice, be&shy;fore you trouble your father with such follies.
  Eury&shy;machus must die by the hand of the executioner, though you should
  pledge half your estates to buy him. Go, my son, and do not altogether forget
  that you are a Roman."</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, Titus Claudius sat down again to his desk. Quintus stood
  for a moment as if in absence of mind; then he slowly went towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, father," he said, as he left the room. His voice was sad,
  almost gloomy, as though they were part&shy;ing for a long, sad interval.
  Titus Claudius, struck by the strangeness of his tone, raised his head in
  astonishment and gazed, like a man waking from a painful dream, at the door
  through which Quintus had departed; a vague presentiment fell on his
  spirit.</p>

  <p>"I was too hard," he said to himself. "His error springs from a noble
  source&mdash;from pity. I ought to have said a kind word to him before he
  went away," and he hastily rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Quintus, Quintus!" he called out into the hall. "Skopas, Athanasius, did
  you see my son?"</p>

  <p>The slaves flew into the vestibule, but Quintus had long since disappeared
  in the bustle of the street. The Flamen returned to his sitting- room,
  oppressed with melancholy foreboding.</p>

  <p>"I will tell him the very next time I see him.&mdash;He has the best and
  truest heart that ever beat, and the noblest souls are easiest
  wounded.&mdash;However, away with such thoughts now, and to work once
  more."</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius sat down again and bent over his table and, as he sat
  there, he might have been taken for a poet in the act of composition, for his
  fine face glowed with eager inspiration. But the words he wrote were not
  those which enchant the populace, but the eloquent flow of a mighty
  impeachment; what he was forging were not lines and verses, but terrific
  weapons against what he believed to be the most threatening foe of the Roman
  Empire; against Christianity."<a href="#298">298</a></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p>WHEN Caius Aurelius had finished the fourth canto of the Thebais, Octavia
  put an end to the reading; break&shy;fast was waiting in the little dining-
  room. The young man was invited to join them, and they passed a pleasant hour
  over the meal. They were all accustomed to their father's absence, for
  business had lately so completely absorbed him, that he would hardly give
  himself time to drink a glass of Falernian, as he sat at work, or to snatch a
  morsel of food. Octavia lamented it, but, on the other hand, she was proud of
  it as well; she rejoiced too in the confident anticipation of a long period
  of rest and enjoyment to succeed this last great effort. Lucilia found dinner
  without him very dull, as she took an op&shy;portunity of whispering very
  pointedly to her sister. This was, in fact, rather strange, for Aurelius,
  whose tongue seemed to have been loosed by the reading of the heroic poem,
  displayed the greatest aptitude for all the accomplishments of social life.
  The triclinium posi&shy;tively sparkled with good humor, even Lucilia belied
  herself, for more than once she broke out into a merry laugh, the very
  reverse of dull. Herodianus, who had come to escort his master home, and who
  had the honor of being invited to share the meal, was astonished at the
  brilliancy o the young man, who was usually so silent, and glanced
  suspiciously at the crystal cup, as if that might be accountable for so
  strange a phenomenon. And Baucis swore by the great Isis, that never in her
  life had she known a Roman knight with such delightful qualities as Aurelius,
  who had a kind word even for her, a stupid old woman, and who read poetry so
  divinely.</p>

  <p>The Batavian took his leave about mid-day; he sent his respectful
  greetings through Octavia to the master of the house, fearing to disturb so
  busy a personage at this hour of the day.</p>

  <p>"And what next?" cried Lucilia, as the door closed upon Aurelius. "Shall
  we lie down to sleep, sweet Claudia, or order the litter to go to the Campus
  Martius?"<a href="#299">299</a></p>

  <p>"Just which you please. The day is fine, and we might walk for an hour
  under the colonnade of Agrippa."<a href="#300">300</a></p>

  <p>"Will you come with us, dear mother?" asked Lucilia.</p>

  <p>"How can I," said Octavia smiling. "I must be on the spot, when your
  father leaves his work. If you are not content to go alone, Baucis
  may..."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no!" interrupted Claudia. "The worthy Baucis may remain at home.
  When we get into the laurel groves<a href="#301">301</a> we shall walk, and
  Baucis is so slow that she would be a hindrance."</p>

  <p>The litter was soon ready. Four Numidians, with waving feathers in their
  heads, marched in front, and they proceeded northwards, by the same way which
  Quintus had taken two days since, in the moonless night.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that we left Baucis at home," said Claudia in Greek. "We can
  talk undisturbed for once. You are so dreadfully sleepy, when we go to
  bed..."</p>

  <p>"And with good reason," replied Lucilia, also in Greek. "I am tired out
  and over-excited. The amuse&shy;ments of the last few days are telling on my
  nerves. First, there was the evening at Cornelia's; then a recita&shy;tion
  for two hours from the charming Claudia on the merits of Caius
  Aurelius..."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, but you are reversing the posi&shy;tion. It was
  mistress Lucilia, who went on talking about Caius Afranius."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! and why? Simply and solely as a coun&shy;terpoise, an antidote to
  Aurelius. Besides, with your kind permission, his name is not Caius, but
  Cneius Afranius. Of course, you have nothing but Caius run&shy;ning in your
  head."</p>

  <p>"That is just like you now," said Claudia with a sigh. "Lately there has
  been no speaking a rational word to you."</p>

  <p>"I am over-tired," Lucilia repeated. "Two cantos of Statius yesterday
  morning, two more again this morning; to-morrow, two cantos of Statius, that
  involves a fourth! It is a mercy, that the Thebais consists only of twelve
  altogether, so it must come to an end at last! Certainly, when we have done
  Statius, he might read us Virgil<a href="#302">302</a> and afterwards the
  'Battle of the Frogs and Mice.'"<a href="#303">303</a></p>

  <p>"Go, Lucilia&mdash;you are quite odious&mdash;and I wanted to confess
  something to you."</p>

  <p>"A confession? my darling Claudia, a confession?" cried Lucilia, seizing
  her sister's hand. "Will you own at last that you love him? That you are a
  perfect fool about him? Oh! silly child! did you not perceive, that I only
  wanted to punish you for trying to deceive me."</p>

  <p>Claudia colored deeply, and involuntarily drew the embroidered curtain, as
  if she feared that the litter-bear&shy;ers might read her secret in her
  face.</p>

  <p>"Not so loud!" she whispered, and -then she softly kissed her cheek.</p>

  <p>"You confess?" asked Lucilia. But the only an&shy;swer was a closer caress
  and a fervent kiss on her lips.</p>

  <p>"That is enough," said Lucilia. "Your kiss says everything. No girl gives
  such a kiss as that, who is not desperately in love. It was meant for Caius
  Aure&shy;lius."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Claudia entreated, laying her hand on the audacious girl's mouth.
  "Promise me..."</p>

  <p>"Not to mount the rostra<a href="#304">304</a> and proclaim in the Forum:
  Claudia is in love with Aurelius!? You little fool! Just the reverse; I will
  keep it a dead secret, and do all I can to clear the road for you. For things
  will not run so smoothly as you think. A mere pro&shy;vincial knight, and
  Claudia, the daughter of the first sen&shy;atorial house in Rome! You cannot
  take it ill in your father if he maintains the rights of his position, and
  intends his daughter to marry a consul."<a href="#305">305</a></p>

  <p>"But if his daughter objects?"</p>

  <p>"Then Titus Claudius must give way, or the gentle Claudia is not incapable
  of running away with Caius Aurelius."</p>

  <p>"What are you saying!" exclaimed Claudia horrified. Then she sat looking
  thoughtfully into her lap.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose," she said presently, "that his allusion, yesterday, to
  Sextus Furius was meant seriously?"</p>

  <p>"What else could it mean? The worthy man is three times too old for you,
  to be sure, but the names of his ancestors have been splendid for centuries.
  Only think of Furius Camillus, the glorious conqueror of the Volscians and
  Aequians. Sextus Furius, to be sure, has conquered no insurgent nations, but
  the consulate undoubtedly lies before him, and his wealth is enormous."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" sighed Claudia. "We Roman girls have a bad time of it. How rarely do
  we have a free choice in the tie which lasts one's life-long! A stern father
  or guardian brings a husband on the scene, before our hearts have a chance of
  deciding. Such a betrothal as that of Quintus and Cornelia is as rare as a
  white raven.</p>

  <p>How beautiful, how honest by comparison is the custom in the North, where
  the lover first wins the affection of a girl, and then seeks the approval of
  her parents. Aurelius has told me wonderful stories of the fidelity of the
  tawny-haired Rugian to the wife of his choice, and of how the treasure is
  often won in fights to the death, after years of constancy. It must be
  glorious to be loved and wooed in that northern fashion! Do you know that
  Aurelius has some Germanic blood in his veins?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said Lucilia surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes, really. His grandmother was a Frisian, from the shores of the
  Baltic, where the Weser falls into the sea. There are large and wealthy
  families among them, valiant warriors and chiefs, who will bow their necks to
  no Roman consul. If only they were of one mind, Aurelius says, Rome herself
  might tremble before these tribes. But, strangely enough, though in their
  family life they are so loving and constant, their feuds are perennial, tribe
  against tribe and prince against prince. It is only under stress of imminent
  peril, that they league themselves under one banner, and woe then to the foe
  they turn upon! You have read of Varus<a href="#306">306</a> and how his
  legions were cut to pieces in the Saltus Teutoburgiensis, while he fell on
  his own sword?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Baucis has told us the story. But after all who cares what goes on
  in Germania!&mdash;our legions are constantly engaged in fighting on the
  frontier, now against the Dacians and now against the Parthians<a href=
  "#307">307</a>&mdash;I do not trouble myself about the where and the why.
  Moral struggles, the battles we must fight at home, interest me far
  more..."</p>

  <p>"Particularly the law pleadings in the Senate, and before the court of the
  Centumvirate!" said Claudia smiling.</p>

  <p>"Certainly! out there, brute force decides the matter, but in the Forum it
  is superior intellect that wins the day."</p>

  <p>"And one of the boldest champions is Cneius Afranius."</p>

  <p>"It is quite true; his whole individuality, his un&shy;daunted honesty,
  his unfailing energy..."</p>

  <p>"Hey day! what eloquence. Before long we shall see you in the Basilica
  among the candidates for ap&shy;plause."</p>

  <p>"Laugh away, by all means! I assert my right and liberty to admire all
  that is noble. If I were better looking, I should very likely exert myself to
  achieve a conquest, for I frankly confess that I regard the future wife of
  Afranius as a woman to be envied."</p>

  <p>"You are frank indeed."</p>

  <p>"I always am. And I find it all the easier, since 1 do not allow my
  consciousness of my defects to destroy my peace of mind. The Gods are unjust?
  For aught 1 care! You have a mouth like a rose-bud, I have a muzzle like a
  Cantabrian bear!<a href="#308">308</a> Fate we call that, or Ananke!<a href=
  "#309">309</a>&mdash;Well, it is a lovely day for us both alike! Just see
  what a crowd and bustle there are out here; I think we had better walk. There
  is the portico with its hundred columns."</p>

  <p>Claudia stopped the bearers, and the two girls walked on to the
  magnificent hall of Agrippa, followed at a short distance by the Numidian
  slaves. Arm in arm they walked along the arcades, by the famous mural
  paintings,<a href="#310">310</a> representing in the highest style of art,
  scenes from the stories of the Greek divinities&mdash;the rape of Europa,
  Cheiron the Centaur, and the voyage of the Argonauts. To the right they saw
  the marble en&shy;closures&mdash;Septa<a href="#311">311</a> they were
  called&mdash;in the midst of which the Roman people assembled when the
  centuria<a href="#312">312</a> were called upon to vote. Lucilia hoped she
  might one day be present at some stormy debate here. Clau&shy;dia found it
  more interesting, to linger over the gay booths<a href="#313">313</a> and
  bazaar for luxurious trifles at the northern end of the portico, where the
  precious produce of the remotest provinces of the empire was displayed.</p>

  <p>Thus, chatting and laughing, they reached the shady avenues of plane and
  laurel, which extended almost to the shores of the river and, with their
  temples, columns, terraces and works of art, were the scene of enjoyment for
  a numerous throng of citizens. Here hundreds of handsome chariots&mdash;most
  of them with two wheels&mdash;rushed to and fro on a broad causeway; graceful
  horsemen dashed along the gravelled way, while the motley crowd of
  pedestrians slowly loitered along the side al leys. Here a following of young
  men pressed round the litter of some woman of rank; there a grave and
  morose-looking pedagogue led his flock to a grass-plot, where boys were
  exercising themselves in wrestling or throwing the discus.<a href=
  "#314">314</a> Pairs of lovers strolled away hand in hand to remoter bowers;
  slaves&mdash;male and female&mdash;with their owners' children, crowded round
  a juggler's booth, applauding the skill with which Masthlion<a href=
  "#315">315</a> balanced a heavy pole on his bare forehead, or the strength
  Ninus<a href="#316">316</a> displayed in supporting half a dozen boys upon
  his shoulders. Among the mob a legion of fruit and cake sellers wriggled and
  squeezed themselves; fortune- tellers twitched at the robe of the passer-by,
  urgently pressing their services on them; shipwrecked sailors sat begging by
  the wayside, with tablets on their knees<a href="#317">317</a> relating the
  history of their woes; flute-players piped their latest tunes from Gades j
  dark Egyptians exhibited tame snakes, which twined round the body, neck and
  arms of the owner to the measure of a dismal tom-tom.</p>

  <p>Lucilia and Claudia followed the shady alley, that ran parallel to the
  main road, greatly amused at the dazzling, noisy and ever-new scenes that met
  them at every turn.</p>

  <p>"Supposing we should meet your Aurelius&mdash;" said Lucilia.</p>

  <p>"My Aurelius! My sweet child, pray do not get into the habit of saying
  such things."</p>

  <p>"Well, then&mdash;Caius Aurelius."</p>

  <p>"It is not likely. He rarely comes now to the plain of Mars."</p>

  <p>"Indeed. What has he to attend to of so much im&shy;portance."</p>

  <p>"He is studying hard; and for the last few days he has been a good deal
  with Cornelius Cinna, who gener&shy;ally admits him at this hour. Cinna
  thinks very highly of him."</p>

  <p>"Well, for my part, I must confess I should prefer a ride here under the
  green trees, to all the harangues of that perverse old man."</p>

  <p>"Aurelius finds him most interesting; he considers him quite a
  genius."</p>

  <p>"What next? A genius in the art of seeing the whole world black!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, quite seriously. Cinna is initiating Caius into the mysteries of
  state-craft, teaching him philoso&shy;phy and history. Caius said, that in
  the few hours he had been permitted to converse with Cinna, he had learnt
  more than in many years of solitary study."</p>

  <p>"Well; then our Caius&mdash;you yourself called him simply
  Caius&mdash;will soon begin to wrinkle his brows and to scent ruin and misery
  in everything. Do you know, child, this Cinna..."</p>

  <p>She broke off suddenly, for some one called her by name; she looked round
  and saw Quintus, who came out from among the trees.</p>

  <p>"Well? Are you often to be met out here? And always close to the highway!
  You must take an extra&shy;ordinary interest in fine horses..."</p>

  <p>"We do indeed!" said Lucilia pertly. "For in&shy;stance, look at that
  noble grey just now turning into the avenue. What a head! what a mane!"</p>

  <p>Claudia squeezed her saucy sister's arm, for the rider, who came galloping
  towards them, was none other than Caius Aurelius. By his side rode
  Herodianus, rather roughly exercised on a tall, high-stepping steed; his
  empurpled face betrayed but little liking for the per&shy;formance. Aurelius,
  by contrast, looked all the more radiant, guiding his noble horse as if it
  were child's&shy;play among the throng of vehicles, and enjoying to the
  utmost the sense of power and security.</p>

  <p>He now caught sight of Claudia, and the blood mounted to his brow. He was
  so much occupied in looking at the two girls, to whom he bowed in agitated
  confusion, that he did not notice, that one of the very small horses, called
  by the Romans "mannie,"<a href="#318">318</a> was rushing towards him like an
  arrow. Its rider, a boy of about twelve, tried to turn the pony's head, but
  not soon enough to avoid the grey, which tossed its head aside. So the pony's
  mane just tickled the horse's lower jaw, and the boy only escaped a violent
  collision by duck&shy;ing widely on one side. The Batavian's horse, at all
  times an irritable beast, gave an ominous snort, and reared straight up,
  trembling in every muscle, and in the next instant would inevitably have
  fallen backwards if Quintus had not made a bold leap over the brushwood,
  seized the horse by the bridle, and after a short struggle brought him to a
  stand-still on all fours again. Herodi&shy;anus, meanwhile, who was
  frightened out of his senses, was thrown up from his saddle by a sudden
  spring of his steed, and reseated in front of it; he threw his arms round the
  beast's neck, and remained a comical picture of woe. After Quintus had
  quieted the Batavian's ex&shy;cited grey, he came to the freedman's help.</p>

  <p>"By Jove the avenger!" cried Herodianus, shuffling back into his saddle
  with much difficulty, "this wild horse of the Sun<a href="#319">319</a> was
  within a hair's breadth of trampling me under his hoofs. Thanks, earnest and
  warmest thanks, heroic Quintus Claudius! I will drink a dozen bowls to your
  health this evening."</p>

  <p>"I have to thank you too," said Aurelius with feel&shy;ing. If it is ever
  in my power to render you such a ser&shy;vice..."</p>

  <p>"By all the gods!" said Quintus. "It might be supposed..."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but I saw how close my horse's hoofs were to your head."</p>

  <p>"Really? However, do you know who the little dare-devil was who shot by
  you at such a pace? That was Burrhus, the son of Parthenius;<a href=
  "#320">320</a> a scatter-brained little rascal. He inherits it from his
  mother."</p>

  <p>"Burrhus?&mdash;the boy that Martial praises so extravagantly?"</p>

  <p>"The very same. He flatters the son, and so touches the father."</p>

  <p>"Well, if he hears that Burrhus nearly rode me down, it may perhaps afford
  him materials for fresh adulation. I, at any rate, have reason to be glad
  that his heroic at&shy;tempt was not altogether successful; that I owe to
  you, my valiant and fearless friend! As I say, if ever you are in a
  position..."</p>

  <p>"Say no more about such a trifle, I beg of you," said Quintus. "Though
  indeed," he added smiling, "it is not impossible, that I may claim your kind
  offices sooner than you expect, though not as a return for my performances as
  a horse-tamer."</p>

  <p>"I am happy to hear it. Come when you will, I am entirely at your
  disposal."</p>

  <p>"Very well (hen," said Quintus with emphasis; "expect me this evening by
  the end of the second vigil."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately I am engaged at that hour."</p>

  <p>"Later then, an hour before midnight?"</p>

  <p>"That will do; I will expect you," said Aurelius.</p>

  <p>The two girls had stood quite still during this short dialogue. Claudia
  was still struggling with the remains of her agitation, even Lucilia had
  turned pale. Aurelius now stammered out a confused apology, bid them
  fare&shy;well, and set spurs to his horse, while the freedman dragged with
  all his might at the wolf's-tooth bit<a href="#321">321</a> of his
  hard-mouthed jade. They vanished in the crowd, Aurelius as straight and free
  as a young centaur, and his companion like a clumsy bale of goods incessantly
  tossed and jolted.</p>

  <p>"You are a fine fellow!" cried Claudia, clasping her brother's hand with
  eager emotion. "What strength, what courage, what promptitude! Oh! my heart
  nearly stood still with terror, when the rearing brute's hoofs hung just
  above your head&mdash;I shall never forget it!"</p>

  <p>"I am sure I am very much obliged to you, my dear little sister. It is a
  long time, since I last heard you speak to me in such an enthusiastic key.
  Confess, Claudia&mdash;the fact that the rider's name happened to be Caius
  Aurelius, does not diminish your ardent apprecia&shy;tion of the feat?"</p>

  <p>"You may laugh at me, if you will. I respect and admire you, and forgive
  all your former sins."</p>

  <p>"Are you coming with us?" asked Lucilia.</p>

  <p>"For ten minutes; then I must turn back again. Clodianus expects me at the
  Baths."</p>

  <p>"And where do you dine to-day?" asked Claudia.</p>

  <p>"With Cinna."</p>

  <p>"It is a long time since you dined with us."</p>

  <p>"I will to-morrow, if it is convenient. I will see whether he will allow
  me to bring Cornelia with me..."</p>

  <p>"Hardly," said Lucilia. "Since the day before yes&shy;terday he has been
  in a desperately bad humor. This morning early I had a note from Cornelia,
  begging me to go and rescue her from the depths of melancholy."</p>

  <p>"What does Cornelia wish for?" said Quintus. "In my presence she is always
  cheerfulness itself."</p>

  <p>"That is the magic of love," replied Lucilia. "Its charms conquer all
  griefs."</p>

  <p>"You seem highly experienced!"</p>

  <p>"Theory&mdash;pure theory."</p>

  <p>They walked on towards the river. There they stood for a few minutes,
  watching the boats and gondolas, which gently drifted down to the Aelian
  bridge or struggled up stream under the stout strokes of the oarsmen. Beyond
  the opposite shore the beauti&shy;ful hills, strewn with gardens and villas,
  smiled inviting&shy;ly down on them, and farther off still rose the five
  peaks of Soracte.<a href="#322">322</a></p>

  <p>"They will soon be crowned with snow," sighed Claudia,</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is wearing into autumn," said Quintus.</p>

  <p>"But now, my children, you must amuse yourselves without me. Till we meet
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You fellows," said Claudia, turning to the Numid&shy;ians, when Quintus
  was lost in the crowd. "Do you know what? You ought to be ashamed of
  yourselves, down to the very ground. If it had not been for Quin&shy;tus,
  Aurelius would have been under the horse's hoofs. Cowards! By the gods, but I
  am minded to have you punished, that you may remember this hour!"</p>

  <p>The Africans opened their wide thick mouths, and stared at their mistress
  as if some marvel had happened. None of her slaves had ever heard such words
  before from Claudia's lips.</p>

  <p>"That comes of her being betrothed to that rich Furius," whispered one of
  them. "I always told you, that the gentlest turn haughty when there is a
  husband in sight."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p>IT was dark. In the dining-room of Cneius Afranius a small party had just
  risen from table. Six guests had shared the modest meal men&mdash;differing
  in age and position, but agreed in feeling, unanimous in their hatred of the
  imperial reign of terror, and alike in courage and strength of character.
  During the meal none but commonplace topics were discussed, con&shy;vinced as
  Afranius was of the fidelity of his slaves; un&shy;der Domitian's rule,
  suspiciousness had risen to the dig&shy;nity of a virtue. Even the
  <i>commissatio</i>&mdash;the friendly cup which, in accordance with time-
  honored custom, closed the meal&mdash;lent no impetus to the
  conversa&shy;tion. Each one was thinking of the discussion, that was now to
  follow.</p>

  <p>They all went into the colonnade, if the small and unpretending court-
  yard deserved the name. Cneius Afranius, the son of a poor family of knightly
  rank of Gallia Lugdunensis,<a href="#323">323</a> would probably have been
  ob&shy;liged to start on his career in Rome as a mere lodger in hired rooms,
  but that a childless friend of his father's had bequeathed to him a small
  legacy,<a href="#324">324</a> which enabled him to purchase a little house,
  which had formerly belonged to a seaman, on the right bank of the Tiber, and
  in the midst of a very humble quarter.<a href="#325">325</a> The situation
  was crowded and almost squalid, and the little villa was only rendered rather
  less unattractive, by the visible care bestowed on its arrangement by its new
  owner, and yet more by the pretty little garden in its peristyle.
  Afrani&shy;us was very conscious of its defects, but they did not distress
  him. That painful sensitiveness, which tor&shy;ments many men in narrow
  circumstances, when inter&shy;course with other men of greater wealth reminds
  them of their poverty, was unknown to him. And as his dress was always in the
  best style, though of plain materials, those who met him elsewhere than in
  his house considered him to be well-to-do; this impression was partly the
  result of his general appearance and de&shy;meanor. Aurelius, who had crossed
  his threshold to&shy;day for the first time, thought as he entered the
  vestibule, that he must have made a mistake; it seemed impossi&shy;ble that
  the self-possessed, easy-mannered Afranius could live in so humble a
  dwelling.</p>

  <p>The six men went slowly and in order from the dining room to the study.
  First came the tall figure of tjie grey-haired Marcus Cocceius Nerva, leaning
  on the arm of Ulpius Trajanus; Publius Cornelius Cinna followed with Caius
  Aurelius, and last came the host with an old centurion, who had long served
  in the wars in Germania and Dacia, and had lost his left arm in the service.
  Now, robbed by Domitian of a pension which had for&shy;merly been granted to
  him, he had for years earned his living wearily as a teacher in an elementary
  school kept by a retired physician, until Ulpius Trajanus had granted the
  veteran free quarters in his own house.</p>

  <p>The slaves were now strictly enjoined to admit no one to disturb the
  party, and Momus, the confidential servant of Afranius, posted himself at the
  door of the room, that no eavesdropping intruder might come too near.</p>

  <p>"My friends," began Marcus Cocceius Nerva, when they were all seated, "we
  have met expressly to hold pregnant and momentous council. Our aim is to find
  the ways and means of at last carrying into effect the steps, which we have
  been deliberating on for many months. The reign of terror of Domitian has
  from the first been well-nigh unendurable, and now his outrages, his
  unblushing insolence, have reached a pitch at which our very blood curdles in
  our veins. Two days since, we all heard from Cinna of the incredible insults
  offered by Caesar to the most illustrious members of the Senate and of the
  knightly order; since then other outrages have come to our ears. If
  Titus<a href="#326">326</a> once declared that he regarded a day as lost, in
  which he had done no good action, this, his degenerate brother,<a href=
  "#327">327</a> accounts each day as misspent, in which he has not trampled
  justice under&shy;foot, and crowned tyranny with boastful insolence. You all
  knew Junius Rusticus;<a href="#328">328</a> he was an excellent man,
  experienced in every branch of learning, generous, and of the loftiest
  morality. This illustrious philosopher was, yesterday, crucified. And why, my
  friends, why? Because he dared to assert that Paetus Thrasea, Nero's noble
  victim, was a man of blameless character. For this, and this alone, Junius
  Rusticus died the death of the basest assassin."</p>

  <p>A gloomy murmur rose from the audience. All, with the exception of
  Aurelius, already knew the facts, but they sounded with renewed horror from
  the lips of the venerable man.</p>

  <p>"Nor is this all," Cocceius" went on. "A second crime almost throws the
  murder of Rusticus into the shade. Not long since a man of fortune named
  Caepio,<a href="#329">329</a> of the order of Equites, died here. His heiress
  was his niece, a young girl of about fourteen. How&shy;ever, a man was found,
  who would declare openly that</p>

  <p>236 oriNirs CLAUDIUS.</p>

  <p>in Caepio's lifetime he had frequently heard him that Caesar was to
  inherit his fortune.<a href="#330">330</a> On the strength of this lie, the
  property was unhesitatingly ap&shy;propriated. The hapless girl, alone and
  inexperienced, fell into infamy. Sunk in wickedness, crushed by shame and
  sickness, a few days since she placed herself in the way, as Caesar was being
  borne to the Forum. She lifted up her hands to the throne on which he was
  car&shy;ried, and cried in desperate accents for justice. She was seized by
  the body-guard, and flogged to death this morning."</p>

  <p>"Death to her murderer!" cried Cinna, shaking his fists in the direction
  of the palace. "The fate of this poor child may fall on you, O Nerva! on you,
  Ulpius Trajanus, on you, Cneius Afranius. In the empire of this tyrant there
  is but one law: the mad whim of a blood-hound.&mdash;To-day his Falernian has
  gone to his head&mdash;a beck, a nod, and the daughters of our noblest
  families are stolen<a href="#331">331</a> for his pleasure. To-morrow he has
  eaten and is full&mdash;he must be amused, and Rome breaks out in flames. Ah!
  hideous, bottomless pit of disgrace! Decide as you will, my resolution is
  taken. In the Senate, in the Forum, in the theatre&mdash;meet him where I
  may&mdash;I will kill him."</p>

  <p>"Be easy, my dear friend," said Cocceius. "You are the last man, who would
  ever be allowed to get near enough. The suspicious tyrant, who has the walls
  of his sleeping-room lined with mirrors,<a href="#332">332</a> so that he may
  see what is going on behind him&mdash;he will know how to protect himself
  from Cinna. Besides, never let us stain our just cause with unnecessary
  bloodshed! The goal, that glimmers before us, can be reached without the
  murder of Caesar. If the revolted nation brings him presently before the
  judgment-seat of the Senate, he will be legally condemned tcr death, and then
  he may meet the fate he has merited a thousand times over. But we, whose
  purpose it is to open an era of freedom and jus&shy;tice, must, whenever it
  is in any way possible, keep out hands clean. We are conspirators against his
  throne, but not his executioners."</p>

  <p>Muttered words of approbation assured the orator, that he spoke the
  feelings of his friends. Even Cinna agreed.</p>

  <p>"You are right," he said frowning. "You are al&shy;ways clear and logical,
  when my heart seethes with rage. It is well, my worthy colleagues, that you
  did not put me at your head. I am good in action, or where ener&shy;getic
  decision is needed; but in the history of the world well- meditated plans and
  calm resolve weigh heavier in the scale."</p>

  <p>"And their union will suffice to break our bonds," added Afranius. "But I
  must confess I am burning to know how Ulpius has solved the problem.&mdash;I
  know how I should solve it..."</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Ulpius Trajanus. "You have "always been the silent member at
  our meetings. Perhaps I may be able to avail myself of what you have to
  sug&shy;gest, to strengthen my own web."</p>

  <p>"What I have to say is very little, but it seems to me all the clearer and
  more simple for that very reason. Rage, hatred, and desperation are
  fermenting in every soul. The fuel is piled, nothing is needed but the spark.
  Let us fling the spark in among the masses, Let us boldly and unreservedly
  call the people of Rome to open rebellion."</p>

  <p>"Moderation!" exclaimed Cocceius Nerva. "Wildly as our hearts may throb,
  let us take no step which calm wisdom cannot approve! We must not act from
  sentiment! You are in error, Afranius, if you think that the populace, which
  clamors for bread and the Circus, will ever feel any enthusiasm for liberty.
  What has this rabble of idlers, this self-interested mob, that lives on the
  largesse of the State, to fear from Caesar? Lightning blasts oak-trees, but
  not the brushwood that cumbers the ground. Whether Titus or Domitian rules,
  whether the Senate is respected or insulted&mdash;it is all the same to the
  herd, so long as there are wrestling, running, and fighting to be seen. They
  would sell themselves bodily to the first Barbarian, who would buy them, so
  long as they had bread and amphitheatres, and a Sicambrian is just as good in
  their eyes as the di&shy;rect descendants of Romulus. Alas! my friends, when
  I look out on the scene of confusion I am seized with sudden terror, and the
  outlook on the future waxes dim before my eyes. This indifference and want of
  patriot&shy;ism is spreading on all sides; it has even tainted the
  army.&mdash;If some change for the better does not soon appear, it may well
  happen that this haughty city may ere long crumble into ruins&mdash;aye, my
  friends, into ruins&mdash;destroyed and sacked by the insolent rout of
  Germanic tribes, who are already thundering at our gates. They will overcome
  the small remains of our virtue with the sword, and the vast host of our
  crimes with their gold."</p>

  <p>He ceased; an expression of deep grief clouded his handsome features.
  Then, turning to Afranius, he said: "And so what I meant to say was, that the
  mob of the capital must, come what may, be kept out of the game."</p>

  <p>"You say the mob," said Afranius, "but there is a class closely allied
  with the mob which, though small in number, is all the greater in force,
  high- mindedness , and dignity. Believe me, even among the third estate among
  the fishermen and dealers, the artisans and handicraftsmen, there still are
  Romans to be found."</p>

  <p>"Very possibly. But large schemes cannot take account of so small a
  factor. The very way in which the State has developed, has thrown the chief
  power into the hands of the troops, and he who is master c{ the soldiery, is
  master of Rome and the Empire. You know how completely the legions in the
  provinces are dependent on the impression of an accomplished fact. It can
  scarcely be expected, that any single division ol the army outside the walls
  of Rome will take up arms for Domitian, if once we have the metropolis in our
  power. We can gain over the Praetorian Guard with a word. Ulpius, my beloved
  son, make known to us now, what you have attempted and achieved in this
  direction."</p>

  <p>Ulpius Trajanus leaned back in his chair, and crossed his arms over his
  breast. His noble and frank countenance, stamped in every feature with
  generous honesty, suddenly grew anxious and grave. Lucilia had been right
  when she said incidentally, that Ulpius Trajanus reminded her of Caius
  Aurelius. Although considerably older and of a dark southern type, the
  Hispanian, like the young Northman, had that look of genuine human
  benevolence, which lends a bright and harmonious expression to any
  features.</p>

  <p>"My friends," began Ulpius Trajanus, coloring a little; "I can as yet, to
  my great regret, report nothing decisive. I came hither not to announce a
  success, but to hear what you had to say. Within the last few months many new
  recruits have joined the ranks of the Praetorians; magnificent gifts of money
  are distributed every week to the officers and men. Norbanus, the officer in
  command, is loaded with favors, so it would be difficult to find an
  opening&mdash;! Indeed, I am firmly convinced that Norbanus, who is an honest
  man, places the welfare of the country far above any other
  consider&shy;ation; however, up to this moment, all my efforts to fathom him
  have been in vain. He speaks out more frankly than many others, it is true,
  but his openness always bears upon trifling matters. He instinctively knows
  the limits of discretion. It would be waste of words to tell you of every
  detail. I have given myself no rest from labor or vigilance, and it is not my
  fault if the rock repeatedly rolls back into the gulf."</p>

  <p>"Promise him the consulate," muttered Cinna frowning, "trip him up,
  trample on him, hold the dag&shy;ger to his breast..."</p>

  <p>"The dagger's point might only too easily be turned upon us," said
  Trajanus smiling.</p>

  <p>"He is right, Cinna," Nerva threw in. "It is precisely his self-command
  and coolness, that fit him for the part assigned to him, and he must play it
  to the end in the spirit of those who have trusted him."</p>

  <p>"But self-command must come to an end and issue at last," said Afranius,
  leaning his round chin on his hand. "I have no thought of even hinting a
  reproach to our worthy Ulpius; I only mean, that if Lucius Norbanus persists
  in the part of the mysterious oracle, and Trajanus waits for the spirit to
  move him, without giving it a helping hand, our work of redemption will
  remain in the clouds. Besides, nothing is more dangerous than a long-planned
  conspiracy. Before you can turn round the palace will have caught wind of it,
  and by the day after to-morrow, the splendid museum of Domitian's victims
  will be increased by a few valuable specimens."</p>

  <p>Cornelius Cinna nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"Excess is mischievous in anything, even excess of caution," he said
  eagerly. "We must strike now, if not with the aid of the body-guard, why,
  then without it or, if need be, against it. There are troops enough in Gallia
  Lugdunensis,<a href="#333">333</a> to defeat the few cohorts of
  Nor&shy;banus. Cinna is thought highly of by the legions, and I myself have
  many devoted allies among the officers; while not a few of the soldiers will
  remember^ that I have always been a friend and supporter of the third
  estate."</p>

  <p>"I can answer for that," said the old centurion, who had till this moment
  sat silent in his easy-chair. "Nor am I altogether devoid of adherents,
  though I cannot compete with Cinna. I should think it would not be
  difficult..."</p>

  <p>"Enough!" interrupted Cocceius Nerva with a friendly wave of his hand. "I
  see that your opinions are divided. Allow me to make a suggestion. The danger
  of discovery does not seem so imminent, as to compel us to forego all attempt
  to rely on the support of Rome. Let us separate in the firm determination, to
  prepare and meditate everything that can help us ards our goal. I am chiefly
  thinking of Caius Atire&shy;lius, who made friends so rapidly with Norbanus,
  and who is regarded with less suspicion at the palace than Ulpius Trajanus.
  We will meet again fourteen days hence, here, in the house of Afranius, and
  at the same hour. If in the meanwhile our plan has made no pro&shy;gress, we
  will give up tlie City of the Seven Hills, and set to work in Gallia
  Lugdunensis."</p>

  <p>This proposal was unanimously agreed to.</p>

  <p>"Yet one thing more. It is quite possible, that in the course of these
  fourteen days events might occur, on which it is impossible to reckon
  beforehand. I am per fectly convinced, that not a soul in the palace suspects
  anything as yet; but spies are innumerable, and an ac&shy;cident, a heedless
  word, a glance, a gesture, might be&shy;tray us. Just at this time fresh
  suspicions have been roused in Caesar's court. Let us be ready to fly at a
  moment's notice."</p>

  <p>"To fly!" exclaimed Cinna. "Is that the road to victory?"</p>

  <p>"I only say in the worst extremity..."</p>

  <p>"That would indeed be the worst! Do you already know of any mischief? Do
  you know, that a spy has already betrayed us?"</p>

  <p>"No, my dear Cinna, I know nothing; I was only considering
  possibilities."</p>

  <p>"But that possibility is exactly what is not to be borne! I feel now,
  twice as strongly as before, that cur only safety is in action."</p>

  <p>But can you act?" asked Cocceius. "Is Nor&shy;banus our ally? Are the
  legions under your command? If so, act, and at once, Cinna! Stand up on the
  plat&shy;form in the Forum, and proclaim that Domitian is de&shy;posed."</p>

  <p>"You are very right," snarled Cinna. "Right as usual! but what is to
  happen if the possibility becomes a fact? When flight has dispersed us to all
  the four winds?"</p>

  <p>"Then, my friend, the essential point is to agree on a spot, where we may
  all quietly meet again. Let that spot be Rodumna,<a href="#334">334</a> the
  native town of Afranius. It is in every respect favorable&mdash;at only a
  short distance from Lugdunensis, and yet so small as to be out of the turmoil
  of the world. There will we meet, rouse the legions to our support, and march
  upon Rome!"</p>

  <p>"Good, good!" cried Cornelius Cinna.</p>

  <p>"Rodumna!" echoed the rest.</p>

  <p>Nerva rose.</p>

  <p>"One word!" implored Caius Aurelius.</p>

  <p>Ncrva, who had already grasped their host's hand in leave-taking, turned
  enquiringly to the young man.</p>

  <p>"Worthy friends," the Batavian went on. "Allow me to say, that down at
  Ostia lies my trireme. The captain and the crew are all men, whom we may
  blindly trust. If anything should occur to drive us hence, we could not do
  better than meet on board my bark and reach Gallia by sea."</p>

  <p>"That is a good idea," said Nerva. "But still one question arises. Does
  any one in Rome know of the existence of this trireme?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly a soul. The high-priest's family, it is true, were on board with
  me, when I came from Baiae. But here, in Rome, where there is so much to
  distract the attention, so trivial a circumstance would scarcely dwell in
  their minds."</p>

  <p>"But the slaves!" cried Cinna. "If you are suspected at the palace, they
  have been cross-examined ere now..."</p>

  <p>"I do not honestly believe, that I have been consid&shy;ered worthy of so
  much attention at the palace."</p>

  <p>"And even if it were so," Nerva added, "there is a way of escape. To-
  morrow morning, spread a report among your friends and acquaintances, that
  your vessel is on the point of starting to return to Trajectum. Go&shy;to
  Ostia yourself, and let her set sail with all ceremony; then, at night, when
  she is well out at sea, order the captain, instead of steering southwards, to
  make a de&shy;tour to the left and sail past the islands of Pontia<a href=
  "#335">335</a> and back to Antium, as if he had come direct from
  Messana.<a href="#336">336</a> There he may wait till we need him. By the
  Appian Way and Aricia<a href="#337">337</a> and Lanuvium,<a href=
  "#338">338</a> it is not more than twice the distance to Antium, that it is
  to Ostia. Give your captain the name of Rodumna as a password; whoever goes
  on board with that token is to he received unquestioned. What do you think of
  my plan?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be better arranged, it seems to me," exclaimed Cinna. "In
  this way we need neither fit out a vessel for ourselves, nor yet travel by
  land. The one would excite suspicion, and the other would be both dangerous
  and expensive. So let it stand: if the situation should seem in any way
  perilous, we meet on board the trireme in the harbor of Antium."</p>

  <p>The conspirators rose and slowly dispersed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p>ON the second day after the incidents just related dark clouds had risen
  over the Tyrrhenian sea and spread in long, heavy banks across the sky, which
  a short while since had been so deeply blue. A stiff south-westerly breeze
  blew up the stream of the Tiber, and tossed the little boats and
  flat-bottomed barges, which lay at anchor at the foot of the
  Aventine,<a href="#339">339</a> till they jostled and bumped each other.
  Sudden squalls of rain swept down at short intervals, and obliged the people
  to throw on their leather cowls or their long&shy;haired woollen
  cloaks.<a href="#340">340</a> All the life of the streets took refuge in the
  arcades and pillared halls; the atria, with their slippery marble pavements,
  were deserted, and the water from the guttered roofs dripped dolefully into
  the overflowing impluvia.<a href="#341">341</a> A strange atmosphere of
  discomfort and oppression lay over the whole city. Some great races, which
  were to have been run in the Circus Maximus, were postponed at the last
  moment. The flow and ebb through the palace gates was less persist&shy;ent
  than usual. The Senate even, notwithstanding the importance of the matters
  awaiting their debate, came in fewer numbers than usual to the sitting. In
  short, the air was full of that dull uneasiness, which infallibly accompanies
  the first symptoms of the decay of the year.</p>

  <p>The storm increased as evening fell. Quintus, who had dined with no other
  company than two of his clients, stood, as it grew dusk, at the door of the
  dining&shy;room, looking out at the dreary prospect. The clouds chased each
  other wildly, and the wind groaned and howled through the colonnade like the
  wailing of suffer&shy;ing humanity.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Quintus, turning back into the room. "And very good! The
  wilder the night, the better for our undertaking."</p>

  <p>He signed to the shrewd slave, Blepyrus, who at this moment passed along
  the passages with a brazier full of burning charcoal.<a href=
  "#342">342</a></p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" he asked doubtfully; and when the slave answered:
  "To your study, my lord," he said:</p>

  <p>"Very good, I am coming&mdash;but take care that we are alone."</p>

  <p>Blepyrus went on through the arcade, and when he had reached his master's
  private room, he carefully set the brazier on the floor. Two lads, who were
  standing idle, he promptly dismissed as Quintus came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Blepyrus," he began. "Just fancy for a moment, that to-day is the
  feast of Saturn.<a href="#343">343</a> Tell me your honest opinion, frankly
  and without reserve, just as if you were sitting at table after the old-
  fashioned custom, while I, your master, waited upon you?"</p>

  <p>The slave looked up at him in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"You do not seem to understand me," Quintus continued. "I want to hear
  from you, how far you are satisfied with your master. If I have been unjust,
  if I have hurt your feelings, or wronged you without cause&mdash;speak! I
  entreat you&mdash;nay, I command you."</p>

  <p>"My lord," Blepyrus stammered out, "if I am to speak the truth, you have
  said many a hard word to your other slaves, but to me you have never been
  any&shy;thing but a kind and just&mdash;indeed a considerate master. I could
  only say the same, even if the feast of Saturn really licensed me to
  complain."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you say so, my good friend. I mean well by you all, and
  if I ever... Ah! I remember now what you have in your mind. You are
  think&shy;ing of the evening, when I struck Allobrogus in the lace<a href=
  "#344">344</a> for breaking that precious vase.&mdash;You are right; the poor
  fellow's teeth were more precious than the broken jar. It was my first angry
  impulse. Believe me, Blepyrus, I have never hurt or injured any one of you
  out of ill-will; and you, especially, have always been a friend rather than a
  slave. You shared my earliest sports&mdash;do you remember by the Pons
  Milvius<a href="#345">345</a> how I sprang to your assistance, when your arm
  was suddenly cramped in swimming? And then again, on the wrestling-ground in
  the Field of Mars, where we enacted the fight of Varus against the Germans?
  You snatched me up and rescued me from my foes, like a young god of war, when
  the game suddenly became earnest..."</p>

  <p>"I remember, my lord," said the slave with a gratified smile.</p>

  <p>"Well," continued Quintus, "then tell me one thing. Are you still ready to
  stand in the breach for your mas&shy;ter? Understand me, Blepyrus&mdash;this
  time it is not a question of fisticuffs or even thrashed ribs. It is for life
  and death, old fellow. To be sure, your reward now should not be, as it was
  then, a saucerfull of Pon&shy;tian cherries, but the best of all you can
  ask..."</p>

  <p>"My lord," said the slave, trembling with agitation, "I will do whatever
  you desire."</p>

  <p>"Can you hold your tongue, Blepyrus? Be silent, not merely with your
  tongue, but with your eyes&mdash;your very breath? You have done me good
  service be&shy;ior now, I well remember, which required secrecy but only in
  trifling matters. This time it is not a tender note to the fair Camilla, not
  even an assignation with Lesbia or Lycoris. Swear by the spirit of your
  father, by all you hold sacred and dear, to be silent to the very death."</p>

  <p>"I swear it."</p>

  <p>"Then be ready; at the second vigil we must set out on an expedition out
  into the storm and dark&shy;ness. You can tell your comrades, that I am going
  by stealth to Lycoris. The rest you shall hear later."</p>

  <p>Three hours after this the little gate creaked open, which led from the
  cavaedium to the street, and Quin&shy;tus and the slave, both wrapped in
  thick cloaks, slowly mounted the Caelian Hill,<a href="#346">346</a> and then
  took a side road into the valley. Here, on the southern slope, the storm
  attacked them with redoubled fury; the blast howled up the Clivus Martis and
  the Appian Way. The streets were almost deserted; only a solitary
  travelling-chariot now and then rolled thundering and clattering over the
  stones.</p>

  <p>"We must mend our pace," whispered Quintus, as the slave paused a moment,
  fairly brought to a standstill at the corner of the Via Latina<a href=
  "#347">347</a> by a sudden squall of rain. "We have still far to go,
  Blepyrus; and we shall have it worse still out there in the open."</p>

  <p>They had to step cautiously on the slippery pave&shy;ment. The road
  gradually trended off to the right; that dark mass, that now lay to the left,
  was the tomb of the Scipios,<a href="#348">348</a> and there, in front of
  them, hardly visible in the darkness of night, rose the arch of
  Drusus,<a href="#349">349</a> through which the road led them. They were now
  out&shy;side the limits of the city itself&mdash;the fourteen regions, as
  they were called, of Augustus Caesar. But Rome, the illimitable metropolis,
  flung out her arms far beyond these prescribed boundaries. That undulating
  plain, which we now know as the Campagna, was then dotted over with villas
  and pleasure-gardens. The main artery of this straggling suburb was the
  magnificent Via Appia&mdash;the noble work of a Claudius&mdash;leading to the
  south. The greater number of these villas were at this time abandoned, and
  the tombs that stood by the road-side<a href="#350">350</a> on either hand
  were hardly more silent than the dwelling places of the living, before whom
  these stone witnesses were set to remind them, that life is fleeting and must
  be enjoyed to the full while it lasts.</p>

  <p>Quintus and his companion went onwards, still to the southwards. The
  country-houses became more and more scattered; they might now have walked
  about two Roman miles beyond the arch of Drusus. A heavily-laden wagon, with
  an escort of riders, had just driven past them, and the gleam of the lanterns
  was dwindling in the distance. Quintus stopped in front of a high-vaulted
  family tomb, of which the fa&ccedil;ade was decorated with a semicircular
  niche containing a marble seat.</p>

  <p>"If I am not mistaken in this Cimmerian blackness," he muttered, "this is
  the spot..."</p>

  <p>And at the same moment they heard, approaching from the opposite tomb, the
  sound of cautious steps.</p>

  <p>A broad beam of light fell on the young man's face.</p>

  <p>"God be praised!" cried a woman's voice; and in an instant Euterpe,
  darkening her lantern again, stood by the side of the two men. The young
  woman was trembling with wet and cold; her clothes clung to her limbs, and
  her hair hung in dark locks over her fore&shy;head and cheeks.</p>

  <p>* Are you alone?" asked Quintus.</p>

  <p>* With Thrax Barbatus. Here he comes."</p>

  <p>"In such weather!"</p>

  <p>"God bless you!" said the old man, coming up to Quintus. "Who is this with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Blepyrus, my trusted friend. He will not betray us."</p>

  <p>My lord, what return can I ever make..."</p>

  <p>"Go on, push on!" was the young man's answer. "Only look how the black
  clouds are driving over the hills; it gets worse every minute. Have we far to
  go?"</p>

  <p>"About three thousand paces," said Barbatus.</p>

  <p>"Then lead the way, my good Euterpe. Come, old friend, lean on me.
  Blepyrus, support him on the left."</p>

  <p>"You are too careful of me, my lord," said the old man, flinging his wet
  cloak over his shoulder. "A mer&shy;ciful Providence still grants me
  strength, that my white hairs belie, and I am used to rougher roads than you
  suppose. It is you, the son of a noble house, accus&shy;tomed to tread only
  on polished marble or soft car&shy;pets..."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense&mdash;why, even this storm is nothing to speak of."</p>

  <p>They turned eastwards, and leaving the high-road, soon reached a wooden
  bridge across the waters of the Almo,<a href="#351">351</a> a rivulet now
  swollen by the storm. From hence the path led them across the Via Latina and
  through a dense wood. The pine-tops sighed weirdly under the lashing wind
  that rocked and bowed them, while now and again, as one bough crashed against
  an&shy;other, there was a sound as of distant axe-strokes. They first
  followed a foot-path, which crossed the wood in a south-easterly direction,
  but presently&mdash;about half way through the pine forest&mdash;their guide
  pushed aside the boughs of a sturdy laurel that stood on the right side of
  the alley, and they plunged into the brushwood. Here another path was
  presently discernible, though overgrown by a seemingly impenetrable tangle of
  shrubs, and this presently brought them out close to a grass-grown mass of
  rocks. By walking round one of the huge boulders, they reached an opening
  into an old and long-disused stone-quarry. A low passage was vis&shy;ible,
  sloping down underground.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said Euterpe. A gleam from her lantern revealed a high-
  piled mass of debris. "I will go in first."</p>

  <p>She placed her lantern, half open, on a shelf in the tufa rock, at such an
  angle as to light up the passage; then, stooping down, she disappeared in the
  doubtful shadow cast by a natural buttress on the rocky wall. Thrax, Quintus,
  and Blepyrus followed, the slave bring&shy;ing the lantern in his hand. At
  the spot, where the flute-player had disappeared, the passage was cut in
  steps, which led abruptly downwards about thirty feet underground; then a
  broad and fairly lofty gallery ran about fifty paces on a level, opening into
  a cross gallery.</p>

  <p>Quintus signed to his slave to remain where these cross-roads met, while
  he followed Thrax Barbatus to the right, where a dim light was visible at
  some con&shy;siderable distance. Approaching nearer, he perceived that the
  source of this light lay somewhat on one side, where a large hall opened out,
  strangely decorated and lighted up by a few tapers. At the farther side,
  oppo&shy;site the entrance, stood an altar hung with black, and over it was a
  wooden image of the crucified Christ. To the left was a brick-walled hearth,
  where a bright fire was blazing. The smoke rose in a tall column to a square
  opening in the roof. On the floor, in a niche on one side,
  Eurymachus&mdash;the slave who had escaped from Stephanus&mdash;lay on a
  straw mat, his pale face rest&shy;ing on his hand. Glauce, his betrothed, was
  occupied in mixing the juice of some fruit with water, to make a drink for
  the fevered sufferer, while Diphilus, kneeling in front of a rough-hewn
  wooden stool, was folding a broad strip of stuff to make a bandage. He rose
  as the new-comers entered.</p>

  <p>"The Lord is merciful!" said Thrax to Eurymachus. "Greet our deliverer.
  All will be well. The night is stormy and dark; we can rest for a short while
  and dry our cloaks by the fire; then, by God's help, we will set forth with a
  good courage.&mdash;By mid-day you will be in safety."</p>

  <p>The sick man's features brightened; joyful surprise and eager gratitude
  sparkled in the dark eyes, which as suddenly closed again, as though dimmed
  by weakness. Euterpe had meanwhile taken the soaked and dripping cloaks from
  the shoulders of the two men, and had hung them over two seats in front of
  the fire. Then she fetched a little table and spread it with bread, and wine,
  while Glauce brought platters and cups from a cave in the wall.</p>

  <p>"Do us the favor of accepting a little refreshment," she said, pulling
  forward a bench.</p>

  <p>Quintus, whose walk through the stormy night, and still more his anxious
  excitement, had made very thirsty, emptied his cup at a draught, and then
  turned sympathetically to Eurymachus.</p>

  <p>"Do you know me again?" he asked smiling.</p>

  <p>The slave drew a deep breath, and said in a weak voice:</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord, I know you. In such a moment of torture a man's memory is
  sharpened. It was you, who on that awful day poured balm into my wounds, you
  and the fair youth with a grave, kind face..."</p>

  <p>"My word for it, but you put me to shame! It was not I, but my companion,
  who first made his way through the hedge&mdash;it was not I, but my
  companion, who gave you that human consolation."</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied Eurymachus solemnly. "Proud and haughty as you looked,
  in your heart there was some stirring of the sense of common humanity, which
  is our inheritance from our Heavenly Father. It was but a small matter that
  betrayed this impulse, but&mdash;I know not why&mdash;it sank deeper into my
  soul than even the brave words of your companion. In truth, noble Quintus,
  the touch of your hand, as you tried to drive away my greedy tormentors, fell
  like balm upon my heart; it fanned the dying spark of courage in my soul aye,
  and I remembered it when, in Lycoris' garden, they were preparing to nail me
  to the cross. You smile, my lord, and think me a raving enthusiast&mdash;but
  so it is. When you came towards me through the gap in the hedge, you appeared
  to me as the type of the illustrious Roman&mdash;handsome, haughty, absorbed
  in the natural desire for enjoyment, and with no heart to pity the
  suf&shy;ferings of the baser millions. But when you turned to go, you left me
  with a revived belief, that the gulf, which severs the classes of men, may be
  bridged over. Often have I discussed it with Thrax Barbatus.&mdash;He
  declares, that the doctrine of Nazareth is destined to be the belief of all
  mankind; I, on the contrary, maintain that it will never be the creed of any
  but the wretched and oppressed. For the noble and wealthy so I argue will
  naturally cling to their luxury-loving idols, to whom they attribute their
  power, dominion, and riches. But since that hour, when Quintus Claudius came
  up to me filled with pity, a divine revelation lives and shines in my soul.
  And has not the current of my own fate jus&shy;tified this presentiment? The
  wealthiest and haughtiest youth of the City of the Seven Hills, the son of
  the all&shy;powerful Flamen, is the deliverer of the wretched slave! Eerily,
  Quintus, I say unto thee: Thou art, though thou knowest it not, a follower of
  the crucified Jesus."</p>

  <p>"I?" said Quintus startled and bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Yea, my lord. 'Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, is my
  disciple,' saith Jesus of Nazareth, 'but he that doeth the will of my Father
  in Heaven.'"</p>

  <p>"I do not altogether understand what you mean; the mysteries of your
  religion are as yet unknown to me."</p>

  <p>"The doctrine of Jesus is simple and clear. The Master himself has summed
  it up in two laws: 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God above all things,' and
  the second is like unto it: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'"</p>

  <p>Quintus looked down in silence.</p>

  <p>"You speak of God," he said at last. "Which God do you mean, Eurymachus?
  Jupiter, whom our forefathers worshipped, is to you a mere idol. What name
  then do you give to the Divinity, who commands your love? And what proof have
  you, that he too is not a false God?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Eurymachus, "our God has no name by which he is known. A
  name is used for dis&shy;tinction, and to mark a difference from others of
  the same kind; but He is one alone and eternal from the beginning. He reveals
  himself to us through the myriad marvels of the universe, which would never
  cease to rouse our awe-struck admiration, but that custom has dulled our
  sense. He is manifest in the impulses and emotions of our own nature, in the
  ardent yearning for immortality&mdash;that home-sickness of the soul which,
  in the midst of all the joys and blessings of this life, makes us aware of an
  infinite void, a gulf which noth&shy;ing else can fill. It is He, whom we
  apprehend in the joy, that thrills us like a tender mother's kiss, when we
  lift up our hearts to contemplate Him by faith. We know Him by the strength,
  the constancy, the scorn of death, that He can inspire, when every nerve of
  our frail body is quivering with pain. Think of our fellow-believers, who
  were butchered by Nero the bloody slaughter in the Arena, the men burnt
  alive, buried alive! What upheld these martyrs through their un&shy;speakable
  torments? The grace of God, the Almighty and All-merciful, whom Jesus Christ
  hath taught us to know."</p>

  <p>"Amen!" whispered Glauce, with an admiring glance at her lover, whose face
  glowed with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Barbatus went anxiously up to him, and laid a hand on his brow.</p>

  <p>"Do not agitate yourself," he said with tender sympathy. "You have still
  much to go through."</p>

  <p>"Nay, it is well," replied Eurymachus. "I feel strengthened since I have
  set eyes on my preserver. Aye, noble Quintus, this is the God, whom the
  disciples of the Nazarene worship this is the faith, which your empire brands
  as a crime. Conspirators, they call us, and traitors. We conspire, it is
  true, but not against Caesar, to whom we freely render the things that are
  Caesar's, as our Master taught us; only against sin, against crime and
  evil-doing. We swear to each other by the memory of ihe Crucified,<a href=
  "#352">352</a> not to betray each other, nor to lie, nor steal, nor bear
  false witness, nor commit adultery. We hate no man for his faith's sake, for
  we know that grace is a gift of omnipotent God, and that, even in the shadow
  of the false god Jupiter, a gleam of divine truth may be seen. We are quiet,
  peaceful folk, who ask nothing more than to be allowed to live undisturbed in
  our faith and hope."</p>

  <p>"You forget one thing," exclaimed Barbatus, as Eurymachus paused. "Christ
  teaches us, that we are all the children of God. In his sight all differences
  of high and low, rich and poor, lofty and humble are as nothing; and we, as
  true disciples of the Redeemer, must strive to work out this principle. We
  must try to found a state of human society, in which all the distinctions
  which have hitherto existed are utterly dissolved."</p>

  <p>"Nay, you are in error," replied Eurymachus. "Those differences are not to
  be done away with. If you levelled them all to-day, they would originate
  again of their own accord to-morrow. Their form and as&shy;pect will be
  modified, but their existence is inevitable. Jesus of Nazareth never
  conceived of such changes. He only sought to revive in those, who have lost
  it in the varying chances and turmoil of life, some conscious&shy;ness of the
  intrinsic worth of all that is truly human. As soon as the great ones of the
  earth learn to see, that even slaves are their brothers, that even the
  base-born are the children of the Almighty, all the most violent contrasts of
  class will be smoothed away, and things that now weigh upon us as a yoke,
  will be turned into a bond of union. 'My Kingdom is not of this world,' said
  Jesus of Nazareth. He will indeed regenerate man, but through his heart and
  spirit, and not with force or violent upheaval."</p>

  <p>"Then you insist on being miserable, come what may?" cried Barbatus
  vehemently.</p>

  <p>"By no means. I only dispute the idea, that the teaching of Christ leads
  to such issues. Whether rich or poor, master or slave, matters not in the
  balance of our salvation. Many a one, who holds his head high and free, bears
  heavier fetters, than the convict in the mines of Sardinia."</p>

  <p>Quintus Claudius once more emptied the cup, which Glauce had filled. His
  brain was in a whirl, and his throat parched. The sight of this slave, lying
  on a straw mat and weighing the future destinies of man, and the mystery of
  existence, with such calm decision, troubled and excited him to an
  extraordinary degree. At this moment he was in a wilder fever than
  Euryma&shy;chus. He looked down with admiration&mdash;almost with
  envy&mdash;at the pale face, which looked so radiant in the midst of
  suffering, so sublimely happy in spite of wretch&shy;edness. And he himself?
  Did not the saying about the convict in the mines apply to him? Was he not in
  fact more fettered and bound, than this fugitive slave? What was the liberty
  that Rome&mdash;that the whole world was ready to offer to him? Had he ever
  been able really to purchase release from that dark melancholy, which
  oppressed him like an ever-present incubus? What a God must He be, who
  uplifted the slave to such serene heights!</p>

  <p>"It is time to start," he said at last, waking from a deep reverie. "The
  roads are bad; I fear we can proceed but slowly; besides, we must not keep
  Caius Aurelius waiting too long. He shares our danger, and is watching in
  anxious uncertainty."</p>

  <p>"Noble Sir!" exclaimed the slave, deeply moved, "are you really prepared
  again to risk your life? You know, Father, how strongly I set my face against
  this project; and even now, at the eleventh hour, I entreat you: Consider
  well what you are doing."</p>

  <p>"It has all been considered," said Thrax impatiently. "If you were to
  perish in this cavern, would not our fate also be sealed? Do you think, that
  Glauce would survive your death? Look at her; see how the mere thought
  frightens her."</p>

  <p>"But who talks of my dying? You should have waited eight or ten days, till
  the first fury of our perse&shy;cutors had cooled."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile you would have cooled, never to be warm again. Your wound,
  at first scarcely worth speaking of, has become so much worse in the
  unwhole&shy;some air of this vault..."</p>

  <p>"And your fever increases every day," interrupted Euterpe.</p>

  <p>"Waste no more words!" cried Thrax angrily. "Help him, Diphilus. You see
  he can hardly drag himself up."</p>

  <p>Diphilus, zealously seconded by Euterpe, lifted the wounded man from his
  wretched couch, and they car&shy;ried him carefully out into the gallery,
  where Blepyrus was wearily leaning against the rough-hewn wall. A litter was
  standing there with some thick woollen cover&shy;lets, and Eurymachus was
  laid upon it as comfortably as possible. Glauce, who had followed with a clay
  lamp, pressed a long kiss on his forehead, and then hur&shy;ried away, crying
  bitterly. Quintus had also accom&shy;panied them, and as soon as he saw that
  all was ready for the start, ran back to fetch his hardly-dried cloak. But he
  involuntarily paused at the entrance of the cavern; the sight that met his
  eyes was as pathetic as it was fair to look upon. The young girl had fallen
  on her knees before the altar, her slender hands uplifted in prayer; she
  gazed up at the cross in a transport of de&shy;votion, smiling ecstatically,
  though tears rolled down her pale cheeks. Her lips moved, at first inaudibly,
  but presently in a low murmur.</p>

  <p>"Saviour of the world," she prayed, "Thou who hast died for us on the
  cross.&mdash;If Thou requirest a victim, take me, and let me suffer a
  thousand deaths, but spare, oh spare my Eurymachus!"</p>

  <p>"Where are you, my lord?" called Blepyrus.</p>

  <p>"I am coming," answered Quintus in an agitated voice. "Forgive me, gentle
  worshipper, for interrupt&shy;ing your prayer. Your God will hear and grant
  it none the less."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke he went up to the fire-place, threw the cloak over his
  shoulders, and followed the litter which, borne by Blepyrus and Diphilus, had
  already reached the entrance of the quarry. Euterpe also was with the wounded
  fugitive. Only Thrax Barbatus re&shy;mained behind in the underground cavern,
  to help Glauce, who had now recovered her cheerful com&shy;posure, to deck
  the altar and throw wood on the fire. It was nearly midnight, the hour at
  which a little knot of believers in the Nazarene were wont to meet and keep
  the Feast of Love in memory of their Redeemer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p>THE little procession slowly made its way through the brushwood; Euterpe,
  indefatigable, led the way. In her left hand she carried the dark lantern,
  with which now and again she lighted up some especially perilous spot, while
  with her right hand she held aside the boughs of the shrubs. The gale was
  still blowing through the dripping trees, and squalls of rain swept over them
  with a rush and roar. After a short but diffi&shy;cult walk they reached the
  foot- bridge, and turned off to the east, leaving the brook Almo behind them,
  and then by degrees the forest grew thinner.</p>

  <p>When at last they reached the open, they saw be&shy;fore them the arches
  of the Claudian aqueduct,<a href="#353">353</a> stretch&shy;ing black and
  ponderous across the plains. The wind had parted the clouds here and there
  over the eastern horizon, and a few stars shone fitfully through the rifts,
  but this made the darkness, which brooded over the whole creation, all the
  more sensible.</p>

  <p>Again they went over a wooden bridge&mdash;then un&shy;der an arch of the
  aqueduct, and a few minutes after through that of another, the Aqua
  Marcia.<a href="#354">354</a> So far they had kept to the road. Now, however,
  they quit&shy;ted it, and for a time cut across fields and meadows, over wide
  pools and ditches, and through brushwood. A quarter of an hour, half an hour,
  a whole hour of this toil, and they had not yet reached the Labicanian
  Way,<a href="#355">355</a> towards which they were marching.</p>

  <p>Diphilus held out bravely, but Blepyrus, who was not of the strongest, and
  who was accustomed only to the lightest toil, panted so painfully, that
  Quintus could not bear to see it.</p>

  <p>"Give me hold," he said with rough good nature. "Why, you are groaning
  like a mule dragging blocks of stone."</p>

  <p>"My. lord!" said Blepyrus out of breath. "You see I can hold out a little
  longer."</p>

  <p>"I see just the reverse. Stop a minute, Diphilus&mdash;there! now get your
  breath again, Blepyrus, and fill your lungs. In ten minutes we will change
  again."</p>

  <p>"But, my lord, what are you thinking of?"</p>

  <p>"Do not talk, but save your wind."</p>

  <p>Euterpe, always thoughtful, offered the exhausted man a draught of mead.
  Blepyrus drank it eagerly, and the strange convoy went on its way again
  through the silent night.</p>

  <p>They were indeed a strange party for any one who could have seen them! A
  youth of senatorial rank serving as litter-bearer to one slave, while another
  walked idle by his side! Quintus thought of his friends and equals, and could
  not help smiling; but with his next breath he sighed, for he thought of his
  father. He knew indeed, that Titus Claudius would not have hesi&shy;tated to
  lend a hand if needed for the rescue of the meanest of his dependents; Titus
  Claudius, no less, would have bent his shoulder to the strap of a slave's
  litter in case of need. And yet, what bitter grief, what implacable
  resentment would that generous man feel, if only he could see&mdash;could
  guess...!</p>

  <p>Quintus gazed vaguely up at the driving clouds, that scudded wildly along
  like a host of uneasy spirits. They packed and tumbled together, hiding the
  few stars which had peeped forth in the dark sky.</p>

  <p>"I cannot help it," thought Quintus, tightening his lips. "I have no
  choice in the matter. If the whole world round me crumbles into eternal night
  I cannot help it!"</p>

  <p>The wounded man, exhausted by his too eager talk with Thrax, lay meanwhile
  silent and motionless on his couch. Even when Quintus slipped the straps on
  to his own shoulders he seemed indifferent to the fact; only a taint cry of
  surprise betrayed, that he had not swooned or lallen asleep.</p>

  <p>They had gained the Via Labicana at last, and were toiling up the slippery
  way. Blepyrus was just going to take his master's share of the burden again,
  when he suddenly became aware of a shade at a few paces distance, which at
  first stole stooping down close to the hedge, and then suddenly made for the
  open country, bounding across the road with long steps.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked Quintus, who had also ob&shy;served the noise and
  running figure.</p>

  <p>"Some wild creature perhaps," said Euterpe.</p>

  <p>"It was a man," said Eurymachus.</p>

  <p>Quintus stopped and gazed out into the darkness; then, turning to
  Eurymachus, he asked with evident anxiety:</p>

  <p>"When did you first see him?"</p>

  <p>"This minute, as we came upon the road."</p>

  <p>"I saw him before," said Blepyrus in a whisper, as though a similar shade
  might at any moment start forth in the gloom. "Out there, by that bush in the
  middle of the field something moved and scudded past. I thought it was some
  night-bird."</p>

  <p>"They are sitting snugly in their nests," said Diphilus. Blepyrus did not
  answer; he was considering.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said at length, "that I have seen that peculiar
  skulking walk and sudden disappear&shy;ance before. He vanished like
  lightning."</p>

  <p>"And he meant no good," added the flute-player. "In short, it was a spy
  sent out by the slave-catchers, and before we can reach the gate the
  town-watch will be upon us."</p>

  <p>"Then we must be doubly careful," said Quintus, forcing his pulses to beat
  more calmly. "We must toil across country again as far as the Via
  Praenestina.<a href="#356">356</a> It will be heavy walking, almost up to our
  knees in the soil.&mdash;But listen! is not that the tramp of horses? Coming
  from the city&mdash;not a thousand paces away."</p>

  <p>"Lord and Saviour!" groaned Euterpe. "The man must have flown like the
  wind."</p>

  <p>"He must indeed, if these horsemen have come at his call. No, the swiftest
  cannot be so swift as that. It it all the same; forewarned is forearmed. What
  is that to the right of the road?"</p>

  <p>"A fountain, or something of the kind," replied Blepyrus.</p>

  <p>"We will hide behind the wall, till the horsemen have passed."</p>

  <p>In a few seconds they had reached the fountain, of which the basin was
  raised about three feet above the ground. By day it would have been a
  perfectly un&shy;availing shelter, but in the darkness it was a sufficient
  cover. If the horsemen should have lanterns, to be sure&mdash;and this could
  not yet be seen for a rise in the ground&mdash;they might easily detect the
  track of the fugi&shy;tives across the weeds and grass, and then...</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life Quintus was aware of the presence of a
  great danger. Although he felt cer&shy;tain, that the unknown runner could
  not possibly have fetched the horsemen, who were now close upon them, there
  was an infinity of possibilities, of which the mere thought seized his heart
  with a cold grip. Even&shy;accident might here have played an important part.
  If the riders were really agents of the slave-takers, or even soldiers of the
  town- watch, the next few minutes were fateful indeed. The sinister vision
  that had passed them had made him anxious and undecided, and gloomy
  forebodings weighed on his mind. The thought flashed through his brain: How
  if you were now at home, standing by your own triclinium? Would you now
  appeal as you did to Blepyrus, or would you not rather seek some excuse for
  evading the work of rescue? But the question left him clear of all doubt; he
  did not re&shy;gret the step he had taken, and let what might await him, he
  would persist now in the road on which he had started. This short meditation
  restored his peace of mind; he still was anxious, but it was not on his own
  ac&shy;count; it was for the task he had undertaken, the fugitive who lay in
  silence on the drenched couch, the faithful and brave souls who crouched with
  him for shelter. Sud&shy;denly he felt a trembling hand clasp his own, and
  press it with passionate fervor to quivering lips. It was Etiry&shy;machus,
  whose heart, in spite of every dread, was over&shy;flowing with exalted
  feeling. The slave's grateful kiss fired a sacred glow through the young
  man's veins, and it was with a sense of supreme indifference to all the
  sports of fate, that he heard the trample of hoofs coming nearer and
  nearer.</p>

  <p>Blepyrus and the stalwart Diphilus held themselves in readiness to meet a
  possible onslaught. Euterpe sat on a low stone, half paralyzed; her heart
  beat audibly, her hands trembled convulsively.</p>

  <p>The horses were now close upon them. Quintus leaned forward, and saw five
  or six dark forms mounted on small, nimble beasts. They were riding
  cautiously, at a short trot. Now they were passing the spot where the
  fugitives had turned aside from the high-road&mdash;Quintus fancied he saw
  them check their pace, and hastily felt for the weapon in his bosom. But it
  was a mistake. The riders trotted on, and did not diminish their pace till at
  some distance to the south- east, where the road mounted a hill. The hated
  sound of hoofs gradually died away in the distance.</p>

  <p>"God be praised!" sighed Euterpe.</p>

  <p>Diphilus hastened to reload himself.</p>

  <p>"We might have spared ourselves the fright," he said to Eurymachus. "In
  this darkness..."</p>

  <p>"It was only on account of your fugitive," said Ble&shy;pyrus. "It may be,
  that the riders were only mer&shy;chants or other harmless folk..."</p>

  <p>"It is all the same," interrupted Quintus. "Any man is to be regarded as
  suspicious. Do not lose an&shy;other minute! Off! towards the Praenestian
  Way."</p>

  <p>And once more the little procession set forth across bog and briar. Thus
  they reached a foot-path, which led them past vineyards and at length down to
  the high&shy;road. The Via Praenestina was little frequented at night, even
  in fine weather; the main traffic led past the towns of Toleria and Aricia,
  So they went on, re&shy;lieved in mind, towards the town, which was still at
  about an hour's distance. By degrees the south-west&shy;erly gale spent
  itself and lulled, no longer rushing in wild blasts across the plain, but
  blowing softly and steadily, like a long-drawn sigh of respite. The black
  clouds rolled away to the east and north, and the wan&shy;ing moon showed a
  haze-veiled sickle on the horizon.</p>

  <p>Eurymachus as before lay in total silence; and neither Quintus, whose
  spirit was tossed by a thousand new and strange feelings, nor Blepyrus, who
  was straining every nerve to conceal his utter exhaustion, uttered a word as
  they walked on. Only Diphilus and Euterpe exchanged a few words in low tones.
  The flute-player described her terror; never in her life had she quaked so as
  on the stone by that fountain. After passing through such perils, she seemed
  to feel the need of showing all her love and good feeling to her worthy mate,
  and she even wished to relieve him of the litter straps, as Quintus had
  relieved Blepyrus, and harness her own shoulders. But Diphilus laughed
  shortly, and scorned the idea.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he growled good humoredly, "that is a good notion! You want to
  score your white shoulders with the marks of the strap. Think of business,
  child! Why, to-morrow you are to play at the house of the captain of the
  body- guard; you need not spoil your beauty to-night. It was mad enough, that
  you would not stay at home such a night as this."</p>

  <p>They were now close to the limits of the suburbs of Rome. The buildings on
  the Esquiline, dimly lighted by the moon, stood out sharper as they
  approached them against the western sky. Passing by the field, where
  Philippus, the son of Thrax Barbatus, lay buried, they made their way through
  the empty streets to the Caelian Hill, and at last reached the back entrance
  of the house inhabited by Caius Aurelius. The narrow path, which led to it
  across the hill, was entirely deserted; the houses stood detached, each in
  the midst of its garden, and shut off from the road by high walls.</p>

  <p>Quintus went forward and knocked three times at the postern gate. The bolt
  was instantly drawn, and Magus, the Gothic slave, came joyfully to meet the
  strangers.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my lord," he said in a whisper. "Your arrival relieves us of the
  greatest anxiety. I have been listening here at the gate these two
  hours."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;" said Quintus equally softly, "we are very late; but it
  could not be helped. Come, good people, make no noise&mdash;go in front,
  Magus."</p>

  <p>They all went into the garden, and the Goth barred the door again. Then
  they crossed the xystus<a href="#357">357</a> to the peristyle, and went
  along a carpeted corridor to the atrium. Here they were met by Herodianus,
  who with difficulty suppressed an exclamation of joy.</p>

  <p>"At last!" he said, bustling to and fro with delight, like a busy mistress
  receiving guests. "We had begun to think, that you must have met with some
  misfortune. Aurelius, my illustrious friend, is in the greatest anxiety. But
  softly, for pity's sake softly! everyone is sound asleep, and foresight is
  the mother of prudence."</p>

  <p>A light was shining in one of the rooms that sur&shy;rounded the court-
  yard; before they could reach it, Aurelius appeared in the doorway and
  hurried out to embrace Quintus.</p>

  <p>"What a fearful night!" he said with a sigh of relief. "How anxious I have
  been for you, my dear Quintus! A hundred possibilities, each more terrible
  than the last, have racked my brain. Be quick, Magus, lift the wounded man
  from his litter! Come, you must be quite tired out.&mdash;Such torrents of
  rain! Your cloak is as heavy as lead. And here is our sweet little
  musi&shy;cian, as tender as a baby.&mdash;Come, warm yourselves, refresh
  yourselves!"</p>

  <p>Herodianus had meanwhile hastened to open a cubiculum farther on in the
  corridor, while Magus took the place of Blepyrus, who was utterly exhausted.
  Eu&shy;rymachus was laid in bed and soon fell asleep, after Euterpe and
  Diphilus had applied a fresh bandage and given him a cup of refreshing drink.
  Blepyrus, inca&shy;pable of standing even a moment longer, threw off his
  cloak and sank at full-length on to one of the cushioned benches in the
  colonnade; he begged Herodianus, as he passed, to throw a coverlet over him.
  "I am more dead than alive," he said. "When my master goes home, wake
  me."</p>

  <p>The freedman tried to persuade him to go into one of the rooms and lie on
  a bed; but Blepyrus heard no rpore. Deep, blank sleep had overpowered him at
  once. So Herodianus fetched a couple of warm rugs, in which he carefully
  wrapped the weary slave and then he joined Aurelius and Quintus.</p>

  <p>The Gothic slave stayed to watch Eurymachus. Leaning back in a chair,
  resting his feet on a stuffed footstool, he sat gazing in the sleeper's face
  which, faintly lighted by the glimmer of a small bronze lamp, was the picture
  of worn-out nature, but at the same time, of contentment and peaceful rest.
  Magus knew all the history of the hapless slave. He knew how Domitia's
  steward had for years made life a burthen to him, and had at last condemned
  him to a martyr's death. The immutable steadfastness of the sufferer had
  excited the enthusiastic admiration even of the simple Goth, and strange
  thoughts were surging in his soul.</p>

  <p>"How still he lies there with his eyes tight shut," thought the Goth,
  "quite shut, and yet I could fancy he saw through the lids. Veleda,<a href=
  "#358">358</a> the prophetess, had just such eyes! When I was carrying him
  across the hall he looked up, and it was like a flash of fire, and yet soft
  and mild like the blue sea when the sun shines. If he were fair, he would be
  just like the priest in the grove of Nerthus.<a href="#359">359</a> He indeed
  was a favorite of the gods; he knew everything on earth and above the earth.
  I feel as if this man too must know all secrets, which make such men wise
  above all others. It is written on his forehead.&mdash;If only he were not so
  pale and feeble&mdash;if he had limbs as strong as mine, and hale northern
  blood in his veins! Odin should melt us down to make one man.&mdash;There
  would be a hero!"</p>

  <p>So thought the worthy Gothic slave, while his eyes remained fixed on the
  features of the sleeper; but before long his own eyes also closed, and the
  ideas that had roused him to unwonted excitement remained in his mind in the
  realm of dreams. He saw Odin, with his wolves and raven, rushing down through
  the woods on the shores of the distant Baltic. He himself, Magus, was
  standing in the shadow of a sacred beech-tree, hand-in-hand with the wounded
  slave, who had dragged him&shy;self painfully through the underwood. As the
  god rushed past them, he lightly touched them with his sword; and they flowed
  and melted, as it were, into one, each feeling as though this had been their
  destiny from the beginning of things. And now, as the newly-created
  two-in-one looked up, behold! the mighty sword of the god hung to a branch of
  the beech-tree. He put out his hand, took it down, and with a giant's
  strength, whirled it round his head. A flash of light shone through the
  grove, and the newly-formed being felt that he was stronger and mightier than
  all mortals, from the rising of the sun to the setting thereof.</p>

  <p>"A foolish dream!" Magus whispered to himself, as he suddenly started wide
  awake. He gave his charge, who had begun to stir, a draught of water, and
  then fell asleep again.</p>

  <p>Euterpe and Diphilus had meanwhile gone away, though the Batavian had
  begged them to take a change of clothes and rest under a comfortable roof for
  the rest of the night. After Quintus had changed his dress and refreshed
  himself with food and drink, he also wished to return home. But Aurelius
  detained him.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, in a tone of strange timidity: "With regard to our
  journey to-morrow to Ostia, I have a proposal to make to you. It is very
  true, that the mere fact that I am sending my ship off on her return to
  Tra&shy;jectum is a sufficient reason&mdash;still&mdash;people might... To be
  plain with you, my intimacy with Nerva and Cinna has attracted notice in
  certain quarters&mdash;I fear I may be watched, and therefore it would
  perhaps be better to give the whole affair the aspect of a pleasure
  excursion&mdash;if you only could persuade your sister, and perhaps your
  betrothed to accompany us. I have such a perfect disguise for Eurymachus,
  that neither of the young ladies can have the faintest suspicion.
  Besides&mdash;who troubles himself about a slave? It seems to me the plan is
  as admirable as it is simple."</p>

  <p>"It is masterly!" exclaimed Quintus. "Cornelia is crazy about the sea, and
  Claudia and Lucilia will have no objections. If only the weather
  improves..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! the day will be splendid," said Aurelius, going into the hall. "The
  wind has quite gone down, and the clouds are parting. I asked Magus just
  now."</p>

  <p>"The idea is delightful. The more openly and boldly we go to work, the
  better. About what hour should we start?"</p>

  <p>"I thought about three hours after sunrise."</p>

  <p>"Very good. I will let Cornelia and my sisters know; the rest I leave
  entirely to you, my dear Caius."</p>

  <p>"You shall not be disappointed," said Aurelius, radi&shy;ant with
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"And where shall we meet? Out beyond the tomb of Cestius?"</p>

  <p>"It will perhaps be better that you should come here, and we will proceed
  all together to the place where vehicles wait; that will look least
  suspicious and most natural."</p>

  <p>"So be it: we will go to the gates in a little party. Now farewell&mdash;I
  am very tired, and wish I had my litter."</p>

  <p>"Shall I...?" Aurelius began.</p>

  <p>"I should think so indeed! What! risk all that our exertions have so far
  accomplished for the sake of my selfish limbs! Nay, nay. I shall live through
  it, never fear. Farewell again, my dear Aurelius."</p>

  <p>The friends embraced. Blepyrus, awakened by Herodianus, who lent him a dry
  cloak, came dizzy with sleep, down the corridor and followed his master with
  a faint groan. Quintus, in spite of all he had gone through, walked on fresh
  and eager, and in five minutes they were at home.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p>IN the house of Cornelius Cinna a slave had just announced that it was two
  hours after sunrise.<a href="#360">360</a> Cinna, though he had slept but
  badly, had long been out of bed, he would not, however, receive any of the
  numerous visi&shy;tors, who were enquiring for him in the atrium, but was
  pacing the peristyle to and fro with his head sunk on his breast. Cornelia,
  who was taking breakfast in the dining-room with Chloe and one or two
  slave-girls, sent repeatedly to call her uncle.</p>

  <p>"Directly&mdash;in a minute," was all the answer, and Cinna began to walk
  up and down the colonnade.</p>

  <p>His mind was principally occupied with an incident, which certainly seemed
  significant. Shortly before mid&shy;night his slave Charicles had brought him
  a mysterious note, which had been left with the door-keeper by a man
  concealed in a cloak. The paper, which was doubly tied round for safety,
  contained but a few words: "You are surrounded by spies; be on your
  guard."</p>

  <p>There was no signature, nor did the large thick writing&mdash;a feigned
  hand no doubt&mdash;afford any clue. "Surrounded by spies!" This idea, stated
  with such uncompromising plainness, haunted his excited fancy with urgent
  persistency. He had long known, that under Domitian's rule espionage and
  underhand reporting everywhere spread their treacherous snares. And yet it
  came upon him now, as something impossible and shocking. In vain he racked
  his brain to guess who could be the sender of this mysterious warning, and at
  last he came to the conclusion, that the whole thing was perhaps the spiteful
  jest of some enemy&mdash;or a trap laid by Caesar himself.</p>

  <p>While her uncle thus paced the arcade in gloomy displeasure, Cornelia eat
  her breakfast in the best of humors. The early day shone so gaily and
  invitingly into the room, the air, purified by the night's rain, was so
  sweet! Besides, had not Cornelia, as she thought, the most particular reasons
  for seeing the whole world rose&shy;colored to-day? The soft light in her
  eyes showed that she had recovered a peace of mind, a happy confi&shy;dence,
  which for some time she had lost entirely.</p>

  <p>Chloe," she said at last, when the girls had left the room: "Did you not
  notice anything yesterday? I mean when I came back into the sitting-room,
  after offering sacrifice?"</p>

  <p>"Chloe raised her round head on her fat, short neck, and grinned like a
  simpleton. Cornelia, who was usu&shy;ally excessively annoyed by this
  behavior, seemed on the present occasion to be superior to all petty
  vexation. She went on pleasantly enough:</p>

  <p>"The faith in the universal Mother has its mysteries. At our third visit
  you yourself saw how Barbillus can work by means of his divine mission. You
  fell to earth in awe-stricken terror, but the goddess smiled on you as she
  did on me, the first time I knelt before her in the holy of holies. So I
  venture to tell you, that my heart is full of unutterable peace and joy. Did
  you not see yesterday, that I was quite uplifted with happiness?"</p>

  <p>Chloe grinned wider than ever.</p>

  <p>"No," she said witli incredible stupidity.</p>

  <p>"Then you must be stricken blind. I was almost beside myself; for Isis,
  the all-merciful, has bestowed on me the most precious of her gifts. She
  promises me protection against every danger, and in proof of her grace will
  send her divine brother Osiris to me with a message. He will lay his hands on
  my head, and so in&shy;spire into me a spark of his eternal light. Do you
  com&shy;prehend the immensity, the infinitude, of this celestial mercy? The
  divine miracle is to be accomplished at the next new moon, and then no
  farther penance or sac&shy;rifice will be needed. I shall henceforth be the
  sealed and adopted daughter of the goddess for ever."</p>

  <p>Chloe stared blankly in her face. "Yes," she said, after a few minutes
  silence. "Barbillus is a great man! At first there were many things I thought
  impossible; but now that I have seen them with my own eyes, I be&shy;lieve in
  everything.&mdash;Everything, everything! If he were to tell me he could cut
  the moon in halves, or bring Berenice's hair<a href="#361">361</a> down from
  heaven&mdash;I should not doubt, I should bow before the magician."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I am so happy!" said Cornelia, while the bright color mounted to her
  cheeks. "Only yesterday how sad I was; my heart was darker than the midnight
  sky, and the wailing of the storm found an echo in my soul. Now, to-day, all
  nature hardly smiles so brightly and happily as my refreshed and joyful
  spirit. This ex&shy;cursion to Ostia comes exactly at the right moment, as if
  I had planned it myself&mdash;it is as if Quintus had read my inmost soul. I
  want to be out in the open country by the everlasting sea, away, far away
  from this crush of houses... Ah! and with him!"</p>

  <p>"It is lucky then, that our stern master, your uncle, makes no
  difficulties. He is usually averse to all ex&shy;peditions, which may extend
  till nightfall. I almost think he was inclined to say: 'No.' It was not till
  he heard that Caius Aurelius was to be of the party..."</p>

  <p>"It is true," said Cornelia. "And I myself was surprised to find how he
  was silent at once at the name of the Batavian." She blushed scarlet. "It
  almost looks, as if he thought I needed some one to watch my behavior."</p>

  <p>"It is only that he is anxious," said Chloe. "And he has a high opinion of
  Aurelius."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I know&mdash;he has told me often enough. It would be a heaven-sent
  boon to him, if I would throw over Quintus and condescend to marry
  Aurelius."</p>

  <p>"That would be a bad exchange!" cried Chloe. "The senatorial
  purple<a href="#362">362</a> for the ring of a provincial knight."</p>

  <p>A slave now announced that Quintus Claudius was waiting in the atrium,
  that he sent his greetings, and wished to know whether Cornelia was ready to
  start, or whether Claudia and Lucilia should quit their litters and come into
  the house. Cornelia started up from her couch and flew to meet her lover.</p>

  <p>"My uncle is in a very bad humor," she said. "It will be best not to
  disturb him. Let us start without any leave-taking."</p>

  <p>"And Chloe?"</p>

  <p>"We will leave her at home."</p>

  <p>Quintus smiled; as they stood there in the narrow passage, lighted only by
  one small window, he threw his arm round the tall, fine figure and, unseen by
  the ostiarius, pressed a burning kiss on her lips&mdash;but Chloe appeared
  with travelling-cloaks and Tyrian rugs, and the little caravan set forth at
  once.</p>

  <p>There were four litters, one for each person, followed by a small escort
  of slaves. The Numidian guard of the Claudian household, and the Batavian's
  Sicam&shy;brians, who were to accompany them into the country, were awaiting
  them, mounted on good horses, by the pyramid of Cestius, where the carriages
  also were stand&shy;ing.</p>

  <p>They first stopped at the house of Aurelius, but here there was no delay.
  Hardly had they knocked at the door, when Aurelius came out to meet his
  friends, ready to start He was followed by a litter, in which lay a fair-
  haired, weather-beaten, somewhat haggard-looking man.</p>

  <p>"This is a seaman, who has brought me news from my native land," said
  Aurelius to the ladies. "In all the wind and rain last night, he came up from
  Ostia, and as his ship sails to-day for Parthenope and Greece, he wants to
  return to the port as quickly as possible."</p>

  <p>"A fellow-countryman!" exclaimed Quintus. "You Batavians are not too
  numerous in Rome, and I can imagine that the meeting must have given you keen
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Great pleasure!" said Aurelius, as he got into an&shy;other litter,
  "though the worthy Chamavus has found but ill-luck under my roof. Only think,
  as he came into the court-yard he slipped on the wet marble flags and injured
  his ankle. I begged him to remain and rest, but he assures me his voyage to
  Hellas admits of no delay..."</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow!" said Lucilia glancing back at the lit&shy;ter. "He does
  certainly look very suffering."</p>

  <p>The flaxen-haired German bowed silently to the ladies, and then turned to
  Aurelius with a resigned shrug, as though to say, what could not be cured
  must be borne.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile a crowd of idlers had, as usual, collected round the litters,
  and Aurelius felt his anxiety rising at every instant; he spoke almost
  angrily to one of the bear&shy;ers, who could not settle the fastenings of
  his scarlet tunic to his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>However, they were now fairly off. Past the temple of the Bona Dea<a href=
  "#363">363</a> they turned into the Delphian Way,<a href="#364">364</a> as it
  was called, and on the farther side of the Aventine reached the huge
  monument&mdash;then already a century and a half old&mdash;which has survived
  the storms of so many historical cataclysms to the present day, At that time
  the pyramid of Cestius, cased from top to bottom in white marble, did not
  present the dismal as&shy;pect it now wears&mdash;a pile of weather-stained
  basalt&mdash;standing in silent dignity on the cemetery-like desert of the
  Campagna. A busy population stirred at its foot, and the morning sun shone
  brightly on the gilt inscrip&shy;tion, which recorded that the deceased had
  been Prae&shy;tor, Tribune, and member of the body of High Priests.</p>

  <p>On the eastern side was a second inscription, less monumental and imposing
  than that on the north, but to Quintus and Aurelius of the most pressing
  interest. There was there an <i>"album"</i> as it was called, one of the
  large square stones on which public announcements or notices were written,
  and here, in tall, red letters, the following advertisement might be
  read:</p>

  <p class="sign">"STEPHANUS, THE EMPRESS' STEWARD,<br>
  ADVERTISES FOR HIS ESCAPED SLAVE, EURYMACHUS.<br>
  WHOEVER BRINGS BACK THE FUGITIVE, DEAD OR ALIVE,<br>
  WILL RECEIVE A REWARD OF 500,000 SESTERCES.<br>
  EURYMACHUS IS TALL AND SLIGHT, LEAN AND PALE,<br>
  WITH DARK EYES AND BLACK HAIR.<br>
  HIS BACK BEARS THE SCARS OF MANY FLOGGINGS.<br>
  IN ESCAPING, HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE INJURED HIS FOOT."</p>

  <p>The statement of the reward stood out bright and fresh, while the rest was
  somewhat washed out; the sum was increased every day, and had been doubled
  since the previous evening. Magus and Blepyrus made every conceivable effort
  to clear a way through the mass of people<a href="#365">365</a> that crowded
  round this notice, and almost blocked the whole width of the road, shouting
  and ges&shy;ticulating. In vain; the mob were so possessed by the one idea,
  that they had neither eyes nor ears for any&shy;thing else.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred thousand sesterces!"</p>

  <p>"More than a knight's portion!"<a href="#366">366</a></p>

  <p>"And how long ago did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"Four days."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"He must be above ground."</p>

  <p>"Bah&mdash;he has some patron who hides him."</p>

  <p>Pros and cons were discussed in loud confusion; the cries of the two
  slaves were lost in the storm of voices, and the procession came to a stand-
  still in the midst of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Use your elbows," said Aurelius in Gothic. Magus faced about with a
  shrug, as much as to say there was indeed nothing else to be done. Then, with
  a contemptuous glance at the mob, above which he towered, with slow but
  irresistible force he elbowed his way.</p>

  <p>"He works like a flail!" cried one, and " Oh! my ribs!" vailed
  another.</p>

  <p>"They are the daughters of Titus Claudius."</p>

  <p>"What do I care? the road is for every one."</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;for all alike. Let those who want to go on, get out and
  walk if the crowd is too great; it is only a hundred steps to the
  chariots."</p>

  <p>"Aye, get out!" cried a chorus. "We have as good a right to be here as our
  betters. Get out! Get out!"</p>

  <p>The mob closed upon them threateningly from both sides; Quintus Claudius
  turned pale. If he could not succeed in scaring off the people, and if this
  irresponsi&shy;ble populace insisted on having their own way, all must be
  lost. The lame foot of the pretended seaman must inevitably attract the
  attention and rouse the suspicion of a rabble, whose heads were full of the
  notice and de&shy;scription before them&mdash;discovery was inevitable.</p>

  <p>With a leap Quintus Claudius was standing on his feet, and went forward
  with calm dignity to face the tumult.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked sternly. "Why do you dare to stop the public
  way?"</p>

  <p>His cool self-possession worked wonders&mdash;their noisy audacity was
  quelled.</p>

  <p>"Make way," continued Claudius, while a faint flush rose to his brow. "I,
  Quintus Claudius, the friend of Caesar, command you."</p>

  <p>"Not Caesar himself would let our ribs be battered," shrieked a croaking
  voice.</p>

  <p>But the excuse came too late. Whether it was Caesar's name, or the
  imposing and attractive presence of the young patrician, who stood
  unapproachable as an avenging Apollo, looking calmly on the tumult of his
  antagonists the crowd parted with a dull murmur, and the road was free.
  Quintus and Aurelius had some dif&shy;ficulty in dissembling their joy.</p>

  <p>"Stupid creatures!" said Lucilia. "What queer fancies men take."</p>

  <p>Cornelia smiled with an expression of supreme con&shy;tempt. Nothing
  should have induced her to walk, she said, and she would have liked to see
  any one try to make her.</p>

  <p>They safely reached the spot on the road to Ostia, where the chariots
  awaited them. Here again they found an excited crowd. Driving inside the city
  walls was prohibited by day, and they here found not only the carriages of
  the wealthier citizens, but vehicles for hire in numbers, from the lightest
  chariots to the heaviest conveyances for travelling or pleasure parties. The
  drivers noisily and vehemently offered their services to the passers-by,
  while sellers of eatables and cooling drinks carried their baskets round with
  monotonous cries, and eating and drinking went on in the arbors by the
  roadside. Laughter and song, scolding and cursing were audible in a variety
  of tones.</p>

  <p>The party of excursionists got into a large four-wheeled chariot<a href=
  "#367">367</a> belonging to Caius Aurelius. The fugitive was helped by
  Blepyrus and Magus into a two-wheeled vehicle, known as a
  <i>cisium</i>,<a href="#368">368</a> which stood somewhat apart loaded with
  provisions,<a href="#369">369</a> but which had room on its back-seat not
  only for Eurymachus, but for his two faithful assistants.</p>

  <p>"He insisted on it," said the Batavian to Lucilia; "the worthy man was
  anxious not to intrude on our party."</p>

  <p>"That was very wise of him," replied Lucilia. "He is better off in a
  provision wagon with Magus and Ble&shy;pyrus, than in the most splendid
  chariot&mdash;and really, here with us there is scarcely room for
  him.&mdash;Besides, it would seem he brought no slaves with him from
  Ostia?"</p>

  <p>"All the crew were indispensable on board," replied Aurelius coloring
  slightly.</p>

  <p>Quintus felt that Aurelius could not carry on the deception any farther,
  without involving himself in inex&shy;tricable discrepancies. He tried to
  divert the conversa&shy;tion into a less dangerous channel, and soon
  succeeded in so completely engaging the gay Lucilia's talent for repartee,
  that the second vehicle and the traveller in it seemed entirely
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>With eight Numidians as outriders, the little party made their way
  smoothly and unhindered along the fine high-road. The Sicambrians followed as
  a rear-guard. That valiant equestrian, Herodianus, who had been quite upset
  by his deeds of prowess the night before, remained at home against his usual
  custom.</p>

  <p>Now again Quintus glanced back at Eurymachus, who had maintained a quite
  marvellous composure dur&shy;ing the scene at the pyramid of Cestius. His
  disguise was, in fact, most successful. None but the most prac&shy;tised eye,
  or the scrutiny of the most suspicious, could have detected the pale,
  enfeebled fugitive under the fair, curling hair and tanned, weather-beaten
  face of the mariner.</p>

  <p>The Cappadocian horses made a good pace. In an hour and a quarter they had
  reached the little town of Ficana,<a href="#370">370</a> and as soon as they
  had passed it they saw the marshes, which here border the coast of Latium and
  the distant houses of the seaport.</p>

  <p>During their rapid drive they had overtaken several carriages and
  horsemen, and now the Numidian vanguard galloped past a man, whose light
  travelling-cloak hung carelessly over his shoulders, while a broad
  Thessa&shy;lian hat<a href="#371">371</a> shaded his face from the sun, and
  who sat his horse comfortably rather than rigidly. Two slaves trot&shy;ted by
  his side on mules. As the carriage gained upon him he turned his head, and
  Lucilia exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"See, Quintus! there is Cneius Afranius!"</p>

  <p>Quintus was unpleasantly startled, for he knew how keen the eye of the
  lawyer was, and how great his skill in solving the riddle of the most
  involved mystery. But a glance at Caius Aurelius reassured him.</p>

  <p>"You know," said Aurelius, "that his mother lives at Ostia. Besides," he
  added in a whisper, "even if he were to notice... I pledge my word, that
  Afranius will not betray us."</p>

  <p>The carriage had now overtaken the rider. Afranius, surprised and
  delighted, waved a well-shaped, though rather large hand, and set spurs in
  his horse in order to keep up with the carriage. His horse jibbed and
  re&shy;sisted a little, but then fell into a steady canter.</p>

  <p>"What an unexpected meeting!" cried Afranius. "Are you going to
  Ostia?"</p>

  <p>"As you see," replied Quintus.</p>

  <p>"My trireme sails to-night," said the Batavian gaily. "I am staying longer
  in Rome than I had intended, so I am sending it back&mdash;home to Trajectum.
  Our friends here have come with me for the sake of the delightful expedition.
  What a splendid day it is!"</p>

  <p>Afranius nodded the Thessalian hat.</p>

  <p>"Quite delightful!" said Lucilia.</p>

  <p>"And you, my worthy friend Cneius," continued the Batavian, "what brings
  you here to Ostia? Do you suffer from your old longing to embrace your
  mother? Are you&mdash;escaping the noise of the city? Or have you business to
  attend to."</p>

  <p>"Something of all three. I am riding out as much from duty as for
  pleasure. You know of my proceed&shy;ings against Stephanus, Domitia's
  steward. All I have hitherto been able to do has been in vain; but now, at
  last, a person whose name I will for the present keep to myself, has revealed
  to me certain facts which very probably&mdash;well, I will say no more. But
  at any rate I propose this very day to hear what certain citizens of Ostia
  have to say. If only I could get at all the witnesses equally easily, then
  indeed&mdash;or at any rate one, the most important of all. Unfortunately I
  see no hope for it."</p>

  <p>"Why!" asked Quintus.</p>

  <p>"Because he has vanished and left no trace."</p>

  <p>"Then have him hunted up," said Lucilia.</p>

  <p>"Others are doing that already. Perhaps there were never before so many
  persons in search of one escaped slave, as there are after this wretched
  Eurymachus."</p>

  <p>Quintus turned pale, and even Aurelius felt a certain embarrassment at the
  sound of that name.</p>

  <p>"But how is it," asked Quintus, "that Eurymachus did not long since
  deliver his testimony? What can have induced him to spare his
  prosecutor?"</p>

  <p>"Eurymachus did not learn the facts he now knows, till within a few days
  of his flight, and it was his highly inconvenient knowledge which gave cause
  for his sentence of death."</p>

  <p>"But he might have spoken some days before his escape."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but he could not; he lay in chains with a gag in his mouth, that
  might have smothered the voice of Stentor."</p>

  <p>"And are you certain," persisted Aurelius, "that your informant did not
  deceive you?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly certain. So certain, that I would pay down five hundred
  thousand sesterces on the spot in hard cash&mdash;only unfortunately I do not
  own so much&mdash;if only I could have that daring rascal under my hand for
  five minutes. It is humiliating! Bah! Why need I lose my temper for nothing?
  He is safe on shore, by this time, at Utica<a href="#372">372</a> or
  Nicopolis<a href="#373">373</a> and I am heartily glad to think so. I only
  hope, that at the critical mo&shy;ment Stephanus may not follow his example.
  I am afraid, that model of all the civic virtues knows his way too, to
  foreign shores!"</p>

  <p>And he set spurs into his horse, as if suddenly pressed by some urgent
  business. His thoughts had involuntarily reverted to that greater Stephanus,
  whose misdeeds had filled an empire with horror. He reflected on the
  boldly&shy;planned conspiracy, of which the failure would clear the way for
  Domitia's minion, since it must inevitably lead to the death, or at least the
  banishment, of his accuser. All the more prompt and resolute then must their
  immediate action be against the steward. Perhaps some combination might be
  devised which, come what might, would be fatal to that criminal, whatever the
  issue might be as regarded Domitian, and such a plot and attack on
  Steph&shy;anus would have this additional advantage: that his foes would
  appear politically guiltless. Every one must confess, that a man who could
  fight so vigorously for distinction in the forum, could not at the same time
  be forging plots, which might risk his whole career.</p>

  <p>The lawyer's last words had greatly disturbed and agitated Aurelius, and
  he appeared to be on the point of whispering something to Quintus. He thought
  bet&shy;ter of it, however, and asked Cneius Afranius how it happened that
  Fabulla, his respected mother, still re&shy;mained in Ostia in spite of the
  advanced season.</p>

  <p>"It is strange, is it not?" answered Afranius. "With the metropolis of the
  world so near, to be so indifferent to it! Quite like Diogenes!"</p>

  <p>"Has she never been to Rome?"</p>

  <p>"Never once. She is accustomed to the quiet of Rodumna, and devoted to a
  country life, and she holds the City of the Seven Hills in invincible
  aversion. Ostia appeared to offer a suitable suburban residence; a cousin of
  hers, who has been staying in Egypt since March, has a small estate there,
  which she is taking care of in his absence, and is as happy doing it as Diana
  on the hill- tops; all the more so, as she fancies she would be a hindrance
  to my advancement, if she lived with me in Rome. However, when I am fairly
  launched and settled, I shall insist on her coming."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Aurelius; and he thought to himself: "You are waiting
  till our plot succeeds&mdash;or fails."</p>

  <p>Quintus, who was still very anxious lest Afranius might ride too near to
  the disguised slave and ask him unpleasant questions&mdash;though there was
  nothing to fear from the advocate&mdash;did his best to engage his friend's
  attention. He alluded to the last speech he had deliv&shy;ered before the
  centumvirate, paying him many polite compliments, which the other laughingly
  disclaimed; then the cause itself was discussed, and their debate became
  eager and almost business-like.</p>

  <p>Cornelia had been unusually talkative; not long before Afranius had joined
  them she had, with con&shy;siderable humor, given an account of an excursion
  to Pandataria,<a href="#374">374</a> that she had made not long since from
  Sinuessa,<a href="#375">375</a> with her uncle and the Senator Sextus Furius.
  Claudia and Lucilia too had chatted and laughed; only the two young men had
  been silent. Now the parts had suddenly changed, and Lucilia was almost
  cross, particularly as the lawyer, on his bony grey steed, would persist in
  talking to Quintus and Aurelius, instead of addressing Cornelia and Claudia
  as politeness&mdash;required not to mention herself; though even she, as it
  seemed to her, did not look so very badly to-day; for Baucis had coiled her
  hair with un&shy;precedented skill and precision, and her new gold pin, with
  a handsome ruby head, suited her dark hair to admiration To be sure, it was a
  pity that the careful folds in which she had arranged her stola to fall over
  her ankles could not be appreciated, while she sat in the carriage half
  covered by Cornelia's fuller drap&shy;eries...!</p>

  <p>"Listen, Quintus," she began, as her brother was again on the point of
  addressing Afranius: "You are frightfully uninteresting to-day. For the whole
  way you have hardly spoken a hundred words, and now, when Afranius has at
  last roused you from your drowsy dulness, you can talk of nothing but
  lawsuits."</p>

  <p>"You cannot imagine," said Claudia with a sly glance at Lucilia, "what a
  sworn foe she is to all that concerns lawsuits. The mere name of the
  Centumvirate cuts her to the heart, and if she hears of a speech being made
  which lasts more than two, or at the outside three hours by the
  water-clock,<a href="#376">376</a> she faints outright."</p>

  <p>Lucilia had colored scarlet.</p>

  <p>"You are quite mistaken," she cried eagerly. "But everything at the proper
  time! On the contrary, I am devoted to the pursuit of law and justice, but
  not under this glorious sun and within sight of the sea. The sins and strife
  of men belong to the Forum, to the Basilica, to the Senate-house. Here, where
  all is bright and beautiful, I expect gay conversation and happy
  laugh&shy;ter."</p>

  <p>"She is right," said Cornelia.</p>

  <p>Afranius drew himself up to a rigid and military bearing.</p>

  <p>"I crave your forgiveness, stern judge!" he said with mock gravity. "I am
  greatly grieved to have offended against so wise a clause in your code of
  social morals. I have justly merited your lecture, and could do no less than
  take myself off, if I were not humbly re&shy;solved to earn your forgiveness
  by proving my sincere penitence how sincere you will see by my entertaining
  and amiable behavior for the future. I only crave that you will grant me the
  opportunity of showing my repentance... Do me the favor then of allowing me
  to invite you, one and all, to pay a visit to my mother's little
  country-house. I can promise you, that you will be charmed, enchanted,
  inspired! It is a tiny villa, but in the loveliest garden&mdash;quiet, rural,
  idyllic. The muraena and Lucrine oyster are unknown there, to be sure, but as
  for salads lettuces as big as..." and with a flourish of his hand he
  described a vast circle in the air&mdash;"true Cappadocians, though grown at
  Ostia; and fresh eggs, pears as yellow as wax, and mighty loaves of country
  bread. A few pigeons or chickens are soon cooked... You spoilt town's-folk
  will positively revel in this rural simplicity! Then there are the alleys,
  where vines hang in wreaths from the trellis!"</p>

  <p>"It is heavenly!" cried Claudia, again glancing knowingly at Lucilia.
  "Quintus, we must really accept so tempting an invitation."</p>

  <p>"With pleasure; but first..."</p>

  <p>"I understand," interrupted Afranius. "I too must first attend to business
  here. But listen to what I propose. I will first conduct these ladies to my
  mother's house, and then I will fly on the wings of the wind to speak to the
  good citizens of Ostia. You meanwhile..."</p>

  <p>"Nay, that will not do," interrupted Aurelius. "Before my trireme weighs
  anchor, I have a communication to make to you."</p>

  <p>"To me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to you. A communication of the greatest importance, in connection
  with your action against Stephanus. Allow me, therefore, to amend your
  proposal. Write a few words of explanation to your mother on your wax
  tablets, and give it to your slave to deliver; he may then conduct the
  ladies. The men on horseback can escort them to her house, and then put up at
  the near&shy;est tavern. You, meanwhile, accompany us to the ship. And," he
  added after a pause for reflection as to what fiction he might put forward to
  the three girls, "we will, at the same time, see my fellow-countryman, the
  sea&shy;man from Trajectum, on board his own vessel, which is to sail to-day
  for the East."</p>

  <p>"Which seaman?" asked the lawyer looking round.</p>

  <p>"That I will explain presently."</p>

  <p>"Well, whatever is agreeable to the ladies, is agreeable to me..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! we are in the country here," said Cornelia, "and may dispense with
  ceremony. Only your mother will be startled "</p>

  <p>"Delighted, you mean. She can wish for no more agreeable surprise."</p>

  <p>"So be it then!" cried Aurelius; "and when all is settled, we will join
  the festivities."</p>

  <p>The first houses of Ostia were now visible on either hand, and the bustle
  and stir in the road grew busier. Seamen of every nation, fishermen with red
  worsted caps, porters, and barrowmen, pushed and crowded each other. In five
  minutes they had reached the quay; at the farther end of the mole lay the
  trireme, gaily dressed with flags, and towering majestically above the
  fishing vessels and barges. The young men got out, and the carriage rolled
  away, escorted by the Sicam-' brians and Numidians, as far as the embowered
  villa, which it reached in a few minutes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p>"Do not be uneasy, Quintus," Aurelius whispered, as Cneius Afranius
  dismounted and threw the bridle to his slave. "By all the gods, this man is
  as trustworthy as you and I are! It would be perfect madness, not to give him
  an opportunity for an interview with Eurymachus. His fight with Stephanus is
  in the interest of common humanity, and particularly in that of our
  prot&eacute;g&eacute;."</p>

  <p>"It is all the same; I do not like the business at all."</p>

  <p>"Then, so far as you personally are concerned, you can keep altogether
  aloof."</p>

  <p>Quintus looked enquiringly at him.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so surprised?" Aurelius continued. "It seems to me a very
  simple matter. I will put my&shy;self forward as his protector, and you can
  play the part of entire innocence. You need not frown, as if I had suggested
  some cowardly action; if the whole matter ever comes to be known, it will
  make wonderfully little difference, whether Afranius is in possession of the
  whole or only of half the truth. You will save yourself noth&shy;ing but
  immediate embarrassment. I, for my part, am so perfectly intimate with
  Afranius, so completely his friend..."</p>

  <p>"If you suppose..."</p>

  <p>"Only explain the case to your slave, Blepyrus. He must not be implicated.
  Your best way to avoid difficulties will be not to come on board. I could not
  even have invited you to come on with me, if I had not felt it a duty to
  inform you of my intentions."</p>

  <p>Quintus nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he said thoughtfully. "Then tell our friend, Eurymachus, not
  to mention my name. I, meanwhile, will part from Afranius as though I had
  business to attend to, and I will wait for you on shore. How long will you
  remain on board?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty minutes. Afranius must get through his examination as quickly as
  possible."</p>

  <p>This brief dialogue had been carried on in haste and in a whisper.
  Afranius had been giving instructions to his slave, as to how to treat his
  hired nag, which was somewhat overtired, and he now joined Quintus, while
  Aurelius hurried off to the two slaves, who carried, rather than led,
  Eurymachus. Three words sufficed to explain the situation. The wounded man
  cast a look of mourn&shy;ful gratitude at his preserver, Quintus, who bowed
  to him with feigned indifference; then he released Ble&shy;pyrus, and rested
  his arm on the Batavian's shoulder. Blepyrus turned to follow his master, who
  went off with long strides landwards along the high-street.</p>

  <p>By every human calculation the perilous work was now happily finished; all
  the rest might be considered and carried out at leisure. If Stephanus could
  be really unmasked in all his villany, they might yet succeed in bending the
  severity of the law in procuring the fugi&shy;tive's return, and in securing
  him the happiness of a free and independent existence. Quintus drew a deep
  breath; that would be a worthy end to his bold begin&shy;ning. He felt that
  Eurymachus, now that he had seen him again, was far more to him than a high-
  souled slave. He felt a spiritual sympathy, a sort of ideal friendship for
  him, like that of a disciple for his master. His last struggle to resist the
  overpowering urgency of this sentiment had died effete.</p>

  <p>After walking about ten minutes, Quintus turned back again, and just as he
  reached the strand the boat came to shore with Afranius, Aurelius, and the
  Goth. Eurymachus, then, was safe on board, and if the law&shy;yer's radiant
  expression did not belie him, his interview with the fugitive had yielded a
  rich harvest. As the men stepped on land, he turned eagerly to Aurelius and
  asked him when the trireme was to start.</p>

  <p>"Everything was made ready yesterday," replied Aurelius. "In five minutes
  they will be off with all the oars plied."</p>

  <p>He looked across the waters, and raised his right hand to wave a
  farewell.</p>

  <p>"Good-luck go with you?* he said in a low voice, but loud enough for
  Quintus to hear him. "Greet Trajectum fondly from me."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the trireme began to move. Slow&shy;ly at first she made
  her way through the crowd of mer&shy;chant and fishing-vessels, which lay at
  anchor. But the captain's hammer-strokes beat faster and faster, and the oars
  dipped deeper and more strongly in the dashing waves. Now, gliding past the
  jetty at the end of the quay, the trireme was afloat on the open sea, and
  rode the broad blue waters like a swan. The men still stood gazing after the
  proud and beautiful vessel&mdash;Aurelius, for his part, not altogether
  without a vague and melan&shy;choly homesick feeling. Although he knew, that
  within a few hours the trireme would turn aside from her course and steer for
  the roads of Antium, still, the dear north&shy;country and the image of the
  mother he had left behind him, suddenly seemed brought nearer to him. He had
  but spoken the name of his home&mdash;but it had filled his soul with
  yearning. He thought of the immediate fut&shy;ure.&mdash;Ere long he too
  might be a fugitive, weary and persecuted like Eurymachus, escaping on board
  that very ship, and thanking the gods if he might only flee unrecognized. And
  then Rome, and all that it contained of dear and fair, would be closed
  against him forever. All&mdash;Claudia? the thought sank down on his soul
  like lead. Claudia in Rome, and he hundreds of miles away, with the fearful
  certainty of never seeing her again! But if she loved him then indeed...! If
  she would follow him, as Peponilla<a href="#377">377</a> had followed her
  banished husband, amid the ice- hills of Scandia, or on the barren shores of
  Thule,<a href="#378">378</a> spring would blossom for him more exquisite than
  the rose-gardens of Paestum! But what was there to justify his hopes of such
  immeasurable hap&shy;piness? She had given him proofs of her friendship, no
  doubt, and when he was reading the Thebais, or when he spoke to her of his
  northern home, she had a way of listening&mdash;it had often brought light
  and warmth to his soul like a ray of promise&mdash;but then the revulsion had
  been all the more violent; her greeting would sound distant and measured, her
  smile would seem cold and haughty. Oh! if only he might have time to conquer
  this indifference.</p>

  <p>But a voice was now calling him to the scene of action, and if that action
  were to result in failure!&mdash;He almost regretted having so unresistingly
  yielded to the eloquence of Cinna and to his own passionate
  patriot&shy;ism&mdash;though indeed, as he told himself, his eager passion
  for Claudia was not the least of the motives that urged him to action, nay,
  but for that passion he might still have been hesitating. As it was, it had
  dragged him with the force of a possession into the whirlpool of conspiracy.
  He longed to stand before her&mdash;his chosen love&mdash;as a victor over
  tyranny, as a liberator of the empire, and say to her: "Now, noble heart, I
  may sue for thy love, for I have a grand advocate in the gratitude of my
  country."</p>

  <p>All this swept through his mind like a waking dream, as he gazed in
  silence at the immeasurable sea. Then, coming to 'himself, and turning round,
  his eyes met those of Quintus. They were the very eyes those dear, beautiful,
  unforgettable eyes&mdash;of his loved Claudia, only less sweetly thoughtful,
  less tenderly dreamy. Suddenly his resolve was taken. As soon as it should be
  possible, this very day if it might be, he would learn his fate from the
  woman he loved, and make an end of this miserable uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"Was all prepared?" asked Quintus, as Cneius Afranius withdrew to one side
  and wrote some notes on his tablets.</p>

  <p>"All quite ready," replied Aurelius. "He will be cared for, as if he were
  my own brother."</p>

  <p>"And what did he tell Afranius?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know; they were alone together. Afranius begged to keep it
  secret, until he had everything ready to complete his case against
  Stephanus."</p>

  <p>Afranius seemed to be entirely absorbed in thinking over what he had
  learnt on board the trireme, and Aurelius had to call him twice by name,
  before he roused him from his reverie.</p>

  <p>They were now walking along the quay in the direction previously taken by
  the chariot The two&shy;wheeled cisium, which had been waiting on the
  opposite side of the market-place in front of a tavern, followed them with
  Magus and Blepyrus, while Afranius' slave led the grey hack and his own
  mule.</p>

  <p>"What a tremendous crowd and bustle!" exclaimed the lawyer. "Not such an
  emporium as Puteoli, to be sure, but busy enough and not less noisy! Look at
  r that barge with those gigantic blocks of marble&mdash;each big enough to
  fill an average store-room! And there&mdash;that is really stupendous!"</p>

  <p>He pointed to a spot on the quay, where the crowd was thickest. A crane
  there stood up, from which a gigantic rhinoceros was hanging in mid-air,
  supported by broad bands and girths.</p>

  <p>"A cargo of beasts for the centennial games,"<a href="#379">379</a> said
  Quintus. "There, to the left, are a dozen of iron cages ready to receive
  them. Half Asia and Africa have been plundered for the amphitheatres."</p>

  <p>They went nearer, for an interest in wild beasts was a natural instinct,
  in all who had ever breathed the air of Rome. The hum and clatter of the
  seaport were dully drowned now and again by a hoarse roar&mdash;the growl of
  one of the lions from Gaetulia, restlessly pacing up and down behind the bars
  of their prison, which had just been landed.</p>

  <p>"That is something like a careful!" said the Batav&shy;ian.</p>

  <p>"The freight of two vessels," remarked Quintus, glancing at the two large
  ships, one of which had already unloaded and gone to its moorings. "Our
  gladiators may pray for good-luck."</p>

  <p>Another deep roar, as wild and hungry as ever resounded through the
  midnight desert, drowned his voice. They' were now within a few paces of the
  land&shy;ing-place, and from hence they could command a com&shy;plete view of
  the enormous array of cages, loaded on low trucks, which were waiting to be
  transported to their destination by road. Hyrcanian tigers pressed their
  glossy striped coats against the iron bars; Can&shy;tabrian bears, standing
  on their hind legs, poked their sharp muzzles between the railings; leopards
  from Mauritania, hyaenas, panthers and lynxes gnashed their blood-thirsty
  jaws; aurochs and buffaloes whetted their sheathless horns, or stared in lazy
  indifference on the strange surroundings. There were a few rhinoceroses too,
  a great rarity at Rome; and some enormous croc&shy;odiles, which excited the
  astonishment and curiosity of the maritime populace. Farther off, fastened
  together in long rows, were numbers of wild asses from the hills of Numidia,
  wild horses, giraffes and zebras; for even such beasts as these had their
  part in the mighty fights in the Flavian amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>Quintus and Aurelius lounged idly towards the cages, while Afranius
  studied the movements of the crane, which was now beginning to lower the
  grotesque monster. The two young men came to a stand in front of a lion of
  unusual size, which was snorting at the bars of its cage, and standing in a
  haughty and threatening attitude, its head and tangled mane held high in the
  air. It was, in fact, the same beast as had just now sent out that terrific
  roar. His keeper, leaning against the corner of the cage at a respectful
  distance, had tried to coax and pacify the brute, and as the two gentlemen
  approached the cage he respectfully withdrew to one side. The lion watched
  him as he moved, and then, as he turned his head and perceived the two
  strangers so close to the bars, he drew back a pace as if startled, bellowed
  out for the third time his thundering and appalling roar; and blind with
  fury, rushed at the iron railing.</p>

  <p>Quintus and Aurelius smiled and looked at each other&mdash;but they had
  both turned pale at the brute's un&shy;expected onslaught.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have some personal objection to me," said Quintus. "His fiery
  glare is steadily fixed on me. My word! but it increases my respect for our
  gladiators; to stand face to face with such a beast in the arena, must have
  an unpleasant effect on the nerves. Here we see nature in all its unmitigated
  ferocity."</p>

  <p>The lion was, in fact, standing with a burning eye fixed on Quintus, as
  though in him he recognized an old enemy.</p>

  <p>"Let us go," said the young man, frowning. "It is only a dumb, unconscious
  brute, and I am ashamed to have been so shaken by his mere roar. Aye, blink
  away, you hairy old villain. Thirty inches of steel between your ribs will
  reduce even you to silence, and that must be your fate at last, however
  wildly you may rage and foam over bleeding men first."</p>

  <p>"That is a thorough bad one," said the negro keeper, who spoke Latin with
  difficulty. "I have tamed more than fifty; but all trouble is thrown away on
  this one. He is one of the mountain lions, and his father was a magician. I
  saw that at once, when the hunters brought him, that black tuft on his
  forehead shows it plainly."</p>

  <p>And, in fact, a tangled lock of black hair hung from the brute's mane
  between his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is it your business to tame lions?" asked Quintus.</p>

  <p>"I tame the mildest, and the fierce ones are kept for the fights. I have
  brought up three tame ones for the centennial games&mdash;as high as
  this&mdash;and they do the most wonderful things that have ever been shown in
  Rome. They take live hares<a href="#380">380</a> in their jaws and carry them
  three times round the arena, without even squeezing them."</p>

  <p>But Quintus was not listening; he had turned away. The brute's scowl, as
  he kept his glaring eyes fixed on him, filled him with an uneasy feeling.
  Cneius Afranius appealed to him, too&mdash;with a pressing reminder, that a
  welcome was awaiting him&mdash;not to forget the young ladies and his mother
  in favor of rhinoceroses and giraffes; so they got away from the crowd and
  back to the high-road, where the chariot was waiting with the slaves.</p>

  <p>The venerable Fabulla had received her guests at the garden gate, and had
  conducted them with repeated effusions of delight and gratitude to her pretty
  little house, almost hidden among olives and holm oaks, and bowered in ivy
  and vines. Here the young girls were seated under an autumn-tinted
  arbor-porch, and helped themselves to the grapes which hung within reach
  over&shy;head. In front of them, on a round-table of pine-wood, stood a
  wicker basket of sweet-smelling wheat-bread, a half-emptied bowl of milk, and
  a dish of apples and pears. Near them lay a distaff, tied round with scarlet
  ribbons, and a spindle, for Fabulla was never for an instant idle, and spun
  her yarn even in the presence of such illustrious strangers.</p>

  <p>"Children," said Cneius Afranius, "this is the true Elysium... The shade,
  the dull green of the olives, the vine-garlands, the delicious air, the fresh
  milk&mdash;it is superb! But to feel fully equipped for the enjoy&shy;ment of
  it all, I must first get rid of all my business; for the present, then, I
  leave you to your fate. I must drink a cup of this milk&mdash;and then
  farewell. We shall live to meet again! Within an hour I shall be here again."
  And with the tragic air of an actor playing the dying Socrates, he took up
  one of the red clay cups and solemnly lifted it to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Stop, stop!" cried the good mistress. "You are taking mistress Lucilia's
  cup."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Afranius, replacing the cup he had drained on the table with
  mock penitence. "Mistress Lucilia will not be too severe, I hope, to forgive
  the mistake on the ground of my thirst and absence of mind... Mother, your
  cows are improving, decidedly improving. Never did this nectar taste so truly
  Olym&shy;pian as to-day. Great Pan himself must bless them."<a href=
  "#381">381</a></p>

  <p>And with these words he quitted them.</p>

  <p>When Quintus and Aiirelius had also refreshed them&shy;selves, they all
  rose to wander through the garden under Fabulla's guidance. Quintus and
  Cornelia led the way, followed by Aurelius and Claudia. The mistress of the
  house came last with Lucilia, who was in the highest spirits, and never tired
  of praising the beautiful curly kale and the splendid heads of lettuce, or of
  sing&shy;ing fantastical rhapsodies in praise of the autumn pears and late
  figs. She had at once detected the happy pride, with which Fabulla regarded
  the pretty little estate, a pride which found an unmistakable echo in
  Afranius' jesting praises. A strange impulse prompted her to humor this
  natural vanity, and give the worthy lady, whom she found particularly
  attractive, a simple and genuine pleasure. At the bottom of her heart
  agri&shy;culture and horticulture were as absolutely indifferent to her as
  any other form of human industry; but she had a happy gift of throwing
  herself into sympathy with every sphere of feeling. She spoke with delight of
  the charms of a country-life, and declared quite seriously, that the noise of
  the city was irritating and exhausting&mdash;an assertion to which her
  blooming appearance emphatically gave the lie.</p>

  <p>Fabulla was perfectly enchanted with the girl's ways and manners; she had
  never thought it possible, that so fresh, sweet, and unpretending a creature
  could come out of Rome that den of wickedness and perversion still less out
  of the house of a Senator, and under the very thunder-bolts, so to speak, of
  the Capitoline Jupiter. She took the bright, young creature to her heart with
  all the fervor of a convert; all the more eagerly because Claudia, though
  beautiful, was somewhat taci&shy;turn, and Cornelia, with all her
  graciousness, was still the unapproachable great lady, mysteriously shut up
  within an invisible wall against the advances of stran&shy;gers.</p>

  <p>Lucilia was, in fact, absolutely overflowing with ami&shy;ability and
  graciousness. When, after a quarter of an hour of wandering, Fabulla
  explained that she must now go indoors to make some arrangements for their
  mid-day meal, Lucilia begged to be allowed to make herself of use, and to
  take the opportunity for seeing the kitchen, the store-rooms, and the slaves'
  apartments. Fabulla was enchanted; she pressed a kiss on her new friend's
  brow, and said in a tone of melancholy:</p>

  <p>"You are just like my sweet Erotion!<a href="#382">382</a> She was not so
  pretty as you are, to be sure, nor so elegant, but her eyes were like yours,
  and she was just as bright, and had the same love for the garden and for
  house- keeping. Ah! and such a good heart! How often have I dreamed of future
  happiness for her when she has come, tired out with play, and sat on my lap
  and laid her head on my breast. Then she would go to sleep, and I would sing
  some old song, and sit dreaming and hoping till darkness fell. But the gods
  would not have it so! A handful of ashes in a marble urn is all that is left
  me of my sweet little girl."</p>

  <p>She ceased speaking, and wiped her kind, honest eyes with the back of her
  hand. Lucilia gazed thought&shy;fully at the ground.</p>

  <p>"It is a long time since," Fabulla added presently. "Twenty-two years next
  March; but every now and then a feeling comes over me, as if I had lost the
  dear child only yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Poor mother!" sighed Lucilia.</p>

  <p>Fabulla affectionately stroked her thick, waving hair.</p>

  <p>"Do not mind me!" she said; "such dismal reflections do not suit well with
  the gaiety of youth."</p>

  <p>"Mirth and sadness dwell side by side," replied Lucilia, "and to enjoy
  what is pleasant and endure what is sorrowful is the only sensible way."</p>

  <p>Then they went on between the box-hedged garden-beds.</p>

  <p>306 QUINTUS CLAUDIUS.</p>

  <p>The two couples meanwhile had wandered apart. Quintus and Cornelia were
  sitting at the farthest side of the orchard, on a rough stone bench in the
  deepest shade of the fruit trees, while Aurelius and Claudia re&shy;mained
  meditatively pacing up and down the main walk.</p>

  <p>"How happy I feel!" said Cornelia. "Quintus, my dear love, what more has
  the world to offer us? If it will only leave us undisturbed, so that we may
  enjoy the gifts of the gods in peace! But you are very silent,"my dearest;
  must I wake you from your dreams with a kiss? Has happiness struck you dumb?
  Only think&mdash;before the year is out I shall be your wife! Yes, your wife;
  and I may call you my own forever. I need never give you up again, as I must
  now, when every hour of happiness ends in a parting."</p>

  <p>She clung fondly to him, and looked into his face with radiant devotion.
  Her eyes glowed with feeling, and the fair marble of her throat and arms
  gleamed so softly bright, that Quintus, overcome by the inspiration of the
  moment, clasped her passionately in his arms, and their lips met in a long
  and eager kiss.</p>

  <p>"Cornelia&mdash;fairest and dearest of mortal creatures!" he whispered
  tenderly, as she released herself, "you draw the very soul out of my body
  with your perfect, heaven-sent love! Oh! my sweetheart, I too can
  pict&shy;ure no purer or more noble delight, than that of living one in
  spirit and hope with you. Aye, Cornelia, I am weary of the bustle of this
  fevered world, of the vacu&shy;ous comedy of ambition, of dominion, of all
  this parcel&shy;gilt vulgarity. I long for rest and solitude in a
  peace&shy;ful home. I ask no splendor, no pomp of triumphs, nor lictors with
  their fesces, I only want to be at peace with myself&mdash;I only seek that
  glorious harmony, which reconciles all the discords of life. And that peace,
  that respite and rest, I hope to find with you, my sweetest Cornelia."</p>

  <p>"My whole being, body and soul, are yours," replied Cornelia. "Do what you
  will with me. If love can bring peace, your hopes must certainly be
  fulfilled. But tell me, my dearest, do you really so utterly contemn fame and
  glory? Will you never make any effort to at&shy;tain what, merely as a
  Claudian, you must desire: the triumph of an immortal name? Are peace and the
  joys of love so absolutely antagonistic to the winning of laurels? Do not yet
  abandon the post, where the gods have placed you. Be all they have created
  you to be: a son of that glorious race, which, not so long ago, gave us an
  Emperor! You know me well, my dearest; you know I would worship you still,
  even if the Fates de&shy;prived you of all&mdash;everything; if you were a
  fugitive, a beggar, scorned, hated, I am still and forever yours. But, as it
  is, you are rich and noble, and why should I deny, that fame and pomp and
  splendor have a charm for me? Even the outward gifts of fortune are
  be&shy;stowed by the gods, and the best thanks we can offer is to enjoy."</p>

  <p>"Nay, do not misunderstand me, sweet soul! I do not wish to retire into
  the desert like an eastern peni&shy;tent, nor to fling away the last
  drinking- cup like the philosopher of Sinope.<a href="#383">383</a> It is
  only empty and fruitless activity that I long to escape, the mad whirl of a
  life which swallows men up to the very last fibre, and leaves them not a
  second for reflection. It is only from afar, that you know that heart and
  brain-consuming turmoil. Cinna is one of those who contemn it, and you have
  grown up under his roof. But I see it close, and I shudder at the sight. Is
  it worth while to have lived at all, when our last hour only cuts the thread
  of a tissue of follies? To what end this hollow, noisy and bewil&shy;dering
  drama? There would be more consolation and refreshment in studying the inside
  of an ant-hill."</p>

  <p>"You are so serious," said Cornelia. "What can be the matter with you? You
  used to say things like this, but only as a man out of conceit with his
  surround&shy;ings. And now you look so strange, so mysterious..."</p>

  <p>"You are right, dear heart; I am too grave for so sweet an hour. Forgive
  me, my darling. In time you will know better what it is, that I...I cannot
  explain to you at present."</p>

  <p>And he drew her once more to his breast, and kissed her passionately.</p>

  <p>Aurelius and Claudia had behaved with far greater coolness and propriety.
  Behind this moderation, it is true, lurked an unrest which now and again
  betrayed itself in small details. As the Batavian, by way of open&shy;ing the
  conversation, tried to paint the particular beau&shy;ties of the autumn
  season, a faint flush mounted to his brow, and Claudia made some observations
  on the noble dimensions of three pumpkins in a voice that trembled, as though
  she were craving some favor from Caesar. Both were in that mood of
  self-conscious confusion, which is peculiar to lovers in anticipation of an
  import&shy;ant explanation. And Claudia was still more obviously embarrassed,
  when Caius Aurelius observed that such gourds grew at Trajectum too.</p>

  <p>"It might happen," he went on after a pause, "that circumstances might
  require me to return home sooner, than I at first intended..."</p>

  <p>Claudia pulled the leaves off an olive-branch.</p>

  <p>"That would be a pity," she said in a constrained tone. Then she colored,
  and went on eagerly: " For, in fact, many interesting features of our
  metropolis are still unknown to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh," replied Aurelius, "I am not particularly de&shy;voted to seeing
  features of interest. What I far more regret, is taking leave of so many
  excellent friends, so many hospitable houses where I have passed hours of
  delightful intercourse, and heard so many noble ideas..."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, of course," said Claudia, breaking the olive-twig into little
  pieces. The Batavian sighed.</p>

  <p>"Above all," he went on, "I can never forget how kindly your illustrious
  father received me..."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Claudia.</p>

  <p>"And your mother You cannot imagine how deeply I reverence that noble
  matron, how grateful I am to her for allowing me daily admission and intimacy
  in her house. Ah! sweet mistress, how happy I have been in that family
  circle! Your brother, I may ven&shy;ture to believe, has become my best and
  truest friend; even Lucilia, who generally is so severely critical, has not
  been unkind to me... You may laugh at me, but I swear to you, that when I am
  forced to leave I shall leave a piece of my heart behind!"</p>

  <p>Claudia looked down and walked on in silence, her hand shook.</p>

  <p>"Madam," the young man went on, and his voice trembled with agitation,
  "when I am gone&mdash;forever, when miles of land and sea divide us will you
  sometimes think with kindness of the stranger...? Will you recall the hour in
  which we met, our happy days at Baiae, and this blissful time in Rome?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I shall," Claudia murmured almost inaudibly.</p>

  <p>They had now reached the southern end of the broad walk, where a brick
  wall was visible through a screen of shrubs; the patches of light, which the
  sun cast on the gravel through the leaves, were visibly aslant to the left,
  and the observation struck Aurelius to the heart; from the register afforded
  by this natural time&shy;keeper, he perceived that the best of the day had
  slipped by unused. He was suddenly seized with a kind of panic: these rays of
  light symbolized his happiness. It was escaping him, vanishing fast&mdash;he
  must lose it, if he did not then and there find some spell to command and
  keep it.</p>

  <p>He stood still</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he said with an effort. "I cannot help it... Before I go, I must
  ask you a question. I almost feel as though I could foresee the
  answer.&mdash;It is all the same, I must speak. Only one thing I would beg
  beforehand: Do not laugh at my blind self-deceit. You know me&mdash;I am
  neither highly gifted nor of noble birth, but I have a faithful nature and a
  heart full of never-failing devotion&mdash;and you are the object of that
  devotion. Therefore I must ask: could you bear to make up your mind to be my
  wife? I ask no promise, Claudia, no binding vows&mdash;only a word to give me
  hope, a single word of comfort and encouragement. If you can, oh Claudia,
  speak it! If you cannot, at any rate I shall be free from the anguish of
  uncertainty."</p>

  <p>Claudia had listened to him in rigid silence, but as he ended, she gave
  him her hand&mdash;looked up in his face&mdash;and smiled through her tears.
  Aurelius stood in speechless surprise; he tried to speak, but in vain. This
  transcendent happiness seemed to have paralyzed his powers.</p>

  <p>You dear, foolish man," said Claudia with glow&shy;ing cheeks. "What have
  I done, that you should put a poor girl like me to the blush? I, who have
  looked up to you in all humility..."</p>

  <p>"Claudia!" cried the Batavian, trembling with rapt&shy;ure. "Am I not
  cheated by a dream? You&mdash;mine? I am delirious&mdash;raving."</p>

  <p>"Nay, it is the truth. I am yours now and till death."</p>

  <p>"Quintus, Claudia, Cornelia," shouted a clear, girlish voice, "are you
  playing at hide-and-seek? or has some tricky god turned you all into trees?
  Come forth, Fauns<a href="#384">384</a> and Dryads!<a href="#385">385</a> The
  couches are ready in the triclinium, and a banquet is prepared, that is
  worthy of Olympus."</p>

  <p>Aurelius did not seem particularly interested in the information. How
  gladly would he have dreamed away the remainder of the day out here under the
  verd&shy;urous shade! But society asserts its rights, and love, particularly
  when it is a secret, must early learn to take patience.</p>

  <p>"Let us be prudent and say nothing of this," said Claudia as they went in.
  "My father has certain schemes in his head, as perhaps you know&mdash;he has
  not spoken out about them as yet, but Lucilia told me she was sure of it, and
  Lucilia has eyes like a Pannonian lynx.<a href="#386">386</a> Sextus Furius,
  the senator&mdash;you know him&mdash;wants, they say, to make me his wife,
  and my father is not averse to it. We shall have a fight for it, dear
  Caius..."</p>

  <p>"And you say it as calmly..."</p>

  <p>"Shall I worry beforehand over things I cannot pre&shy;vent? But I will do
  my utmost to win my father over. He is stern, but he loves me, and for his
  daughter's happiness he would make a sacrifice&mdash;a sacrifice I say
  advisedly, for you know how strictly he adheres to his principles, and one of
  his principles is a prejudice against the class of knights..."</p>

  <p>"And if your hopes deceive you&mdash;if all is in vain?"</p>

  <p>"Then I remember that the old saying: 'Where you, Caius, are, there will
  I, Caia, be,'<a href="#387">387</a> is a pledge no less sacred than obedience
  to parents; and I too am of the race of Claudius!"</p>

  <p>They had reached the open plot in front of the house, where Cneius
  Afranius was standing with Lucilia and his mother, cutting ripe grapes into a
  basket with a sharp knife. Dressed in a flowered tunic, the city law&shy;yer
  was humming the air of a Gaulish popular song; every now and then he
  interrupted himself with a cry of surprise at the huge size of the grapes, or
  a jesting woYd to the young girl, and all the time his jolly pleas&shy;ant
  face, ruddy with the exertion and with the October sun, shone like a living
  tribute to Bacchus.</p>

  <p>"There!" he exclaimed, as Quintus and Cornelia also appeared upon the
  scene, "now, a few leaves, and then Zeuxis<a href="#388">388</a> himself
  could not paint a prettier picture! Aha! here are our peripatetic<a href=
  "#389">389</a> philosophers! Come along, our country dining-room is quite
  ready! Come, Quintus, and see if Fabulla's spelt porridge and cabbage
  sprouts<a href="#390">390</a> are to your liking; I am credibly informed too,
  that there is a fish salad with chopped eggs and leeks. Such a cybium<a href=
  "#391">391</a> as my mother makes, you have never tasted. Even the great
  Euphemus, with all his art, must yield to that triumph of culinary skill.
  Walk in, most worshipful company, walk in, for here too the gods abide!"</p>

    <dd>The institution of slavery (<i>servitium</i>) which existed from
    ancient times, was an extremely important factor in the organization of
    Roman society. The slaves (<i>servi</i>) were the absolute property of
    their masters, who had unlimited control over their destinies and lives.
    (This right was not withdrawn until A.D. 61, when the law of Petronius
    prohibited the arbitrary condemnation of slaves to combats with wild
    beasts, etc.) The slave could then be released by the so-called
    <i>manumissio</i>, and was styled <i>libertus</i> or <i>libertinus</i>. His
    position depended upon the greater or less degree of formality with which
    the <i>manumissio</i> was granted. The most solemn manner bestowed all the
    rights of the free-born citizen, but even in this case he was socially
    burdened with the same stigma that rests upon the emancipated slaves in the
    United States. If a freedman attained power and influence&mdash;which under
    the emperors was very common&mdash;the haughty representatives of the
    ancient noble families paid him external respect, it is true, but the man's
    origin was never forgotten.</dd>

    the Black Sea. I thought it permissible, however, to make a Goth of the
    first century speak the language of Ulfilas, since there is nothing against
    it in the general analogies of language, and Gothic, in the form in which
    it remains to us, is so concrete and logical in its structure, that it is
    hardly credible that it should have varied to any great extent within a
    period of two or three centuries.</dd>

       id="36">36. ROMAN KNIGHT</a></dt>

    <dd>During the reign of the emperors the free population of Rome was
    divided into three orders: senators, knights, and people (third order). The
    order of senators was limited to Rome, and in its hands lay the real
    political power, which in the time of the republic had been exercised by
    the assembled populace. To the senate belonged the right of conferring and
    recalling sovereign power, that is, by appointing and deposing emperors, a
    right rarely exercised, it is true, but which the emperors formally
    recognized by allowing themselves to be confirmed by the senate. In their
    relation to this body, the emperors were only first among their peers, the
    members of this order being really their equals; a relation which, with the
    exception of Caligula, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus, the emperors during
    the first two centuries, more or less earnestly endeavored to maintain.
    (Friedl&auml;nder, <i>R&ouml;m. Sittengesch.</i> I, 3.) The number of the
    old senatorial families was comparatively small.<br>
    <br>
    The second order, the knights (<i>equites</i>), was scattered over the
    whole empire. A class specially designated for military service, it became
    in the time of the Gracchi, a body of rich men, each of whom possessed a
    fortune of 400,000 sesterces, and also fulfilled the conditions of being of
    free birth and descent, blameless reputation, and refraining from
    dishonorable or indecorous methods of making money. Loss of this fortune,
    whether by their own fault or otherwise, entailed loss of rank. In
    consequence of the confusion and dissolution of all legal regulations
    through the civil war, these conditions were largely abrogated. While many
    who had formerly been entitled to belong to the order of knights, lost
    their rank through loss of fortune, others, who though possessing the
    needful property, had none of the other requisites, assumed without
    opposition the external distinctions of the knights, especially the gold
    ring and the seat of honor in the theatre. (Friedl&auml;nder.) There were
    various degrees of rank in the order of knights, and also great diversity
    of fortune. Besides the poor titular knights, there were bankers, wholesale
    merchants, and the directors and members of great commercial companies and
    societies for mercantile enterprises of every kind.<br>
    <br>
    The third order comprised mechanics, small tradesmen, tavern-keepers,
    learned men, artists, etc., etc., except in cases where those who followed
    these pursuits were slaves, and also the immense body of proletarians, who
    subsisted almost exclusively on public alms.</dd>

    <dt><a name="37"
       id="37">37. MY LORD SAID THE MATRON</a></dt>

    <dd>Concerning the address "lord" (<i>domine</i>), see the minute
    discussions in Friedl&auml;nder's <i>Sittengeschichte</i>, I, Appendix. It
    was not so common as the modern "sir," but was used as an expression of
    special courtesy in the most varied relations of life. The emperors
    themselves used it in intercourse with persons to whom they wished to show
    attention. Thus Marcus Antoninus writes to Fronto: <i>"Have, mi domine
    magister."</i> According to Seneca (<i>Ep</i>. III, i.) it was already
    customary under Nero to greet persons, whose names could not be instantly
    remembered, by this title, in order not to appear uncourteous under any
    circumstances. The Fronto just mentioned calls a son-in-law
    "<i>domine</i>," and when Nero once played the cithara in public, he
    addressed the spectators as <i>"mei domini."</i><br>
    <br>
    Nay, the association of <i>domine</i> with the name, which to our ears has
    a very modern sound, is often found. Thus in Appuleius (<i>Met</i>. II,) we
    read: <i>"Luci domine,"</i>&mdash;"Lord Lucius." In this story, however,
    this association is avoided, as it might have produced the semblance of an
    anachronism. In accosting women <i>domina</i> (lady) corresponds with
    <i>domine</i>. The French, when referring to subjects connected with
    ancient Rome, reproduce the sound as well as the meaning of the word
    correctly by their madame (<i>meam dominam</i>).</dd>

    <dt><a name="38"
       id="38">38. TITUS CLAUDIUS MUCIANUS</a></dt>

    <dd>The Romans usually had three names. Titus is here the first name
    (<i>praenomen</i>) which was given sons on the ninth day after their birth.
    Claudius is the name of the <i>gens</i>, the family in the wider sense of
    the word (<i>nomen gentilicium</i>). Mucianus is the <i>cognomen</i>, the
    surname, the name of the immediate family (<i>stirps</i> or
    <i>familia</i>). Thus several <i>stirpes</i> belonged to a single
    <i>gens</i>. Daughters bore only the name of the <i>gens</i>; for instance
    the daughter of Titus Claudius Mucianus was called Claudia. If there were
    two of them, they were distinguished by the words <i>major</i> (the elder)
    and <i>minor</i> (the younger); if there were several, by numbers. The
    Claudia <i>Gens</i> was a very ancient and famous one. The principal
    characters of the story, belonging to the <i>stirps Muciana</i>, are purely
    imaginary.</dd>

    room with a comparatively small opening in the roof, and afterwards
    resembled a court-yard, was at first the central point of family life, the
    sitting-room, where the industrious house-keeper sat enthroned among her

    the Palatine Hill across the valley and up again as far as the gardens of

    <dd>Contempt for all who lived in the provinces was peculiar to all Romans,
    even the lowest classes of the populace. Thus Cicero says: <i>"Cum infimo
    cive romano quisquam amplissimus Galliae comparandus est?"</i> (Can even
    the most distinguished Gaul be compared with the humblest Roman citizen?)
    This prejudice extended to later centuries, though under the first emperors
    numerous inhabitants of the provinces attained the rank of senator and
    reached the highest offices. It is very comical, when Juvenal, a freedman's
    son, treats the "knights from Asia Minor," (<i>Equites Asiani</i>)
    condescendingly, as if they were intruders, unworthy to unfasten the straps
    of his sandals. Inhabitants of the other provinces were held in higher
    esteem than the Greeks and Orientals. But even Tacitus (<i>Ann</i>. IV, 3.)
    regards it as an aggravation of the crime committed by the wife of Drusus,
    that Sejanus, for whom she broke her marriage- vow, was not a full-blooded
    Roman, but merely a knight from Volsinii.</dd>

    <dd>The taste of the Romans in regard to the art of gardening resembled
    that shown at Versailles. The eloquence with which individual authors urge
    a return to nature (Hor. <i>Epist</i>. I, 10, Prop. I, 2, Juv. <i>Sat</i>.
    III, etc.,) only proves that the opposite course was universal. Clipping
    bushes and trees into artificial forms was considered specially
    fashionable. Thus Pliny the younger, in his description of the Tuscan villa
    (<i>Ep</i>. V, 6.) writes: "Before the colonnade is an open terrace,
    surrounded with box, the trees clipped into various shapes; below it a
    steep slope of lawn, at whose foot, on both sides of the path, stand bushes
    of box, shaped into the forms of various animals. On the level ground the
    acanthus grows delicately, I might almost say transparently. Around it is a
    hedge of thick closely-clipped bushes, and around this hedge runs an avenue
    of circular form, adorned with box clipped into various shapes, and small
    trees artisti&shy; cally trimmed. The whole is surrounded by a wall,
    concealed by box." Then towards the end of the letter: "The box is clipped
    into a thousand shapes, sometimes into letters, that form the name of the
    owner or gardener."</dd>

    persons, who not only regularly shared the social pleasures of the
    sovereign, but were invited to consult with him on all important government
    business. Within this group of friends there were of course inner, outer,
    and outermost circles. Quintus, who had little intercourse with the court,
    can only be included in the outermost circle of all, and even there more on
    account of his father, who was one of the emperor's most intimate
    "friends," than by virtue of his own relations with the palace. He of
    course had a right to appear at court, like all persons of his rank, even
    without a special "relation of friendship" to the emperor. When inner and
    outer circles of friends are mentioned, this must not be confounded with
    the different classes of friends. Belonging to the first or second class
    im&shy;plied a distinction of rank. Of course, in this sense, Quintus could

    became only poor parasites, in comparison with their rich masters. They

    place under Augustus, instead of from the very last, that was celebrated in

    estimates of ancient writers concerning the consumption of grain, which in
    the time of Josephus amounted to 60,000,000 bushels yearly. Here too, may

    <dd>Augustus appointed the so-called <i>legati</i> or <i>prafaecti
    legionum</i> (commanders of the legions). The <i>legatus</i> thus
    corresponded with our colonel. The next in rank to the <i>legati</i> were
    the <i>tribunes</i> (corresponding to our majors) who, however, with
    special qualifications, might undertake the command of a legion. Usually
    the tribunes did not have the reputation of possessing remark&shy;able
    military ability, as the sons of the knights and senators began their
    military career with this dignity. According to their age and experience,
    the tribunes were second lieutenants. The men next in rank to the tribunes
    were the centurions, the really experienced officers, who were held in high
    esteem on account of their superior knowledge. At the time of our story the
    pressure of the young men for tribuneships was so extraordinary, that the
    places actually at dis&shy;posal were not nearly sufficient to supply the
    demand. The Emperor Claudius had therefore created supernumerary
    tribuneships (<i>supra numerum, imaginariae militiae genus</i>. Suet.
    <i>Claud.</i> 25) a brevet-rank, which without claiming the performance of
    any duty, flattered the vanity.</dd>

    <dt><a name="139"
       id="139">139. CHARIOTEERS</a></dt>

    <dd>As the givers of entertainments could rarely furnish men and horses
    enough of their own for the games in the circus, companies of capitalists
    and owners of larger families of slaves and studs, undertook to supply
    them. As there were usually four chariots in each race, there were four
    such companies, each of which furnished a chariot for each race, and as the
    chariots and drivers had colors to distinguish them, each adopted one of
    these colors, hence they were called factions or parties.
    (Friedl&auml;nder, II, 192.) The colors of these four parties were white,
    red, green and blue. Domitian added two new ones, gold and purple. Like so
    many of Domitian's institutions, this circus innovation passed without
    leaving any trace, but the original parties, especially the green and the
    blue, lasted for centuries. The whole population of Rome, and afterwards
    that of Constantinople, divided into different parties, each of which sided
    with one of these circus factions. The eager, even passionate interest with
    which this was done, finds a feeble analogy at the present day in some
    phases of English and American popular life.</dd>

    of the Emperor Commodus had enraged the people by a series of the boldest
    frauds, during a period of great scarcity. Tust as the horses were starting
    for the seventh race a throng of boys, fed by a tall, formidable looking
    woman, rushed into the arena. The children loaded Oleander with the
    fiercest curses, the people joined them, all rose and rushed furiously
    towards the emperor's Quintilian villa. Commodus, a very cowardly man. was
    so terrified, that after a short struggle he com&shy;manded Oleander and
    his little son to be slain. The mob dragged the corpse of the chamberlain

    <dd>Such executions in theatrical form, especially pantomimic
    representations of them, were no rarity in the arena. Condemned criminals
    were specially trained for such performances. "They entered, clad in
    costly, gold- broidered tunics and purple mantles, and adorned with golden
    wreaths; suddenly, like the death-dealing robes of Medea, flames burst from
    these magnificent garments, in which the miserable creatures died a cruel
    death. There was scarcely a torture or terrible end known in history or
    literature, with whose representation the populace had not been entertained
    in the amphitheatre. Hercules was seen burning to death on Mt. Oeta, Mucius
    Scaevola holding his hand over the brazier of coals till it was consumed,
    the robber, Laure&shy;olus. the hero of a well-known farce, fastened to a
    cross and torn by wild beasts. At the same spectacle, another condemned
    criminal, in the character of Orpheus, ascended from the ground as if
    returning from the nether- world. Nature seemed enchanted by his playing,
    the rocks and trees moved towards him, birds hovered over him, countless
    animals surrounded him; when the scene had lasted long enough, he was torn
    to pieces by a bear." (Friedlaender II, 268. etc.) It can scarcely be
    termed an unwarrantable license, that Lycoris presents a similar spectacle
    for the amusement of her guests. The masters' right to dispose of the lives
    and persons of their slaves had been restricted in the first century, it is
    true; but the omnipotent Parthenius was doubtless superior to such legal
    edicts.</dd>

    <dd>With the sovereign contempt, with which so many Romans treated their
    slaves, this tone, addressed to the daughter of the house, might seem
    strange, but even under the emperors the relation between masters and
    slaves was in many respects a patriarchial one. The older slaves,
    especially, were permitted many familiarities in their intercourse with the
    children of the family, who often called them "little father," "little
    mother," allowed them to reprove them, and according to their personality,
    frequently permitted them to exercise no little authority. A beautiful
    example of cordial relations existing between the master and his slaves and
    freedmen is shown us in a letter from the younger Pliny to Paullinus
    (<i>Ep</i>. V. 19) where he says: "I see how mildly you treat your people,
    and therefore acknowledge the more frankly how indulgent I am to mine; I
    always remember the words of Homer: <i>'And was kind as a father...'</i>
    and our own 'father of a family' (<i>pater familias</i>). But even were I
    harsher and sterner by nature, I should be moved by the illness of my
    freedman Zosimus, to whom I must show the greater kindness, now that he
    needs it more... My long- standing affection for him, which is only
    increased by anxiety, affords a guarantee for that. Sorely it is natural
    that nothing so fans and increases love as the fear of loss, which I have
    already endured more than once on his account. Some years ago, after
    reciting a long time with much effort, he raised blood; so I sent him to
    Egypt, from whence he returned a short time since greatly strengthened by
    the long journey. But on straining his voice too much for several days, a
    slight cough served to remind us of the old difficulty, and he again raised
    blood. Therefore I intend to send him to your estate at Forojulium, having
    often heard you say that the air there was healthful, and the milk very
    beneficial in such diseases."</dd>

    at an age, when Romans were usually married women. For the ordinary
    marriageable age, see Friedl&auml;nder's detailed description in the
    appendix to the first part of his <i>"Sittengeschichte"</i>, where he gives
    a number of inscriptions taken from the tombs, where the age of the girl at
    the time of her marriage is either directly stated, or may be ascertained
    by deducting the years of marriage from those of life. Twelve of the wives
    mentioned mar&shy;ried before they were fourteen, four at fourteen, three
    at sixteen, one at nineteen, and one at twenty-five. We are, however,
    expressly told that marriages of girls under twelve were by no means
    rare.</dd>

    <dd>Even under the kings, the Romans were divided into five different
    classes, since the part taken by each individual in government affairs,
    especially concerning taxes and military service, depended on the amount of
    his property. Each of these classes consisted of a certain number of
    centurias, for instance, the first class contained eighty, the fifth
    thirty, etc. Centuria was the name originally given to a military division
    of 100 men, then to a certain number of citizens, from whose midst such a
    military organization could be formed. These centuries in a civil sense
    voted on public affairs in the <i>comita centuriata</i> (assembly of the
    centuries) each century having one vote.</dd>

    <dd>From ancient times the privilege of wearing a broad purple stripe upon
    the edge of the toga was one of the distinctions of the Roman senators. The
    second class (<i>equites</i>)&mdash;among other
    prerogatives&mdash;possessed the right to wear a gold ring on the finger.
    But at a very early period abuse of this privilege crept in, until members
    of the third class, nay, even freedmen, presumed to assume this badge of
    honor. The severest punishments, such as confiscation of property, etc.,
    could not prevent the misdemeanor. At the time of my story, the gold ring
    was actually as common as the use of the "von" in addressing simple
    citizens in Austria at the present day. See Mart. <i>Ep</i>. XI. 37, where
    the freedman Zoilus ventures to don a huge gold ring. The ring worn by
    Caius Aurelius&mdash;though legitimately&mdash;his must therefore have
    seemed all the more contemptible in comparison with the senatorial purple.
    By the way, it may be said, that in the time of Tiberius the use of the
    purple was also abused. See Dio Cass. LVI1. 13.</dd>

    <dd>A catalogue of animals dating from the time of Gordian III (238 to 244

    <dd>Pan, son of Hermes and a daughter of Dryops, or of Zeus and the
    Arcadian nymph Callisto, etc., etc., is a divinity of the fields and
    forests. Cneus Afranius here uses the adjective "great" in the sense of
    "powerful," "influential"&mdash;corresponding with the hyperbolical tone of
    the rest of his speech. The totally different expression, "the great Pan,"
    in the sense of a symbolical appellation of the universe, originates in a
    verbal error, according to which the word Pan is derived from the Greek as
    "all", "the whole," while it really comes from <i>&pi;&alpha;&omega;</i> (I
    graze.)</dd>

        To you do I commend my girl, my dear,<br>
        Lest pale Erotion tremble at the shades,<br>
        And the foul Dog of Hell's prodigious heads.<br>
        Her age fulfilling just six winters was,<br>
        Had she but known so many days to pass.<br>
        'Mongst you, old patrons, may she sport and play,<br>
        And with her lisping tongue my name oft say.<br>
        May the smooth turf her soft bones hide, and be<br>

        Thou, whoever thou mayst be,<br>
        That hast this small field after me,<br>
