  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Lead on, Jimgrim <i>sahib</i>. I have seen the
  day when stronger boars than that one bit the dust!&rdquo;</small></p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p class="first">AS a general rule when Major Jim Grim strode into the
  administrator&rsquo;s office in the former German hospice, now British
  headquarters in Jerusalem, it was to be greeted with that kind of confident
  familiarity that, from his official superior, warms the fiber of a
  man&rsquo;s being. Jim&rsquo;s standing in the administrator&rsquo;s favor
  was the cause of a good deal of jealousy; more than one British officer
  resented the frequent private consultations between Sir Henry Kettle and the
  American, although they could not prevent them.</p>

  <p>They might have felt less jealous if they had known of the wholesale
  disregard of personal feelings (Jim&rsquo;s especially) whenever the
  administrator considered him at fault.</p>

  <p>Jim walked into the administrator&rsquo;s private office three mornings
  after having run to ground the Dome of the Rock conspirators, rather
  expecting the usual smile and exchange of unusual jokes before broaching the
  day&rsquo;s business. But Sir Henry Kettle opened on him without formality,
  with blazing eyes and a voice like flint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Grim, what the&mdash;do you mean by this? I&rsquo;ve
  received complaint of insolence and insubordination, made against you by
  Brigadier-General Jenkins. It came in the morning mail from Ludd. Were you
  insolent to him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Insubordinate?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ud be a matter of opinion, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you realize that if he presses these charges there&rsquo;ll be a
  court martial, and you&rsquo;ll be broke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him what I thought of him because he was acting
  like a gentleman,&rdquo; Jim answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the point. Jenkins may be a lot of things without
  that excusing you in the least. What I demand to know is, how dare you risk
  my having to court martial you and lose your services?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was not any answer Jim could make to that, so he said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you under the impression that because an exception was made in
  your case, and you were recognized as an American citizen when given a
  commission in the British Army, that therefore you&rsquo;re at liberty to
  ignore all precedent and be insolent to whom you please? If so, I&rsquo;ll
  disillusion you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim knew his man. He wanted none of that kind of disillusionment. He
  continued to hold his tongue, standing bolt upright in front of the
  administrator&rsquo;s desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apply your own standards if you like. How long would insolence from
  major to brigadier be tolerated in the United States Army?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was another of those questions that are best left alone, like dud
  shells and sleeping TNT.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jenkins writes that you gave him the lie direct. Is that
  true?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I asked him a question he couldn&rsquo;t answer without telling
  a lie, or else retracting what he&rsquo;d said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He says he offered to fight him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not quite. He was afraid to go to you with a lame story, and wanted
  me to help soak Catesby with all the blame for losing that TNT. I know
  Catesby&mdash;know him well. I told Jenkins that if it&rsquo;ud make him like
  himself any better he might put the gloves on with me any time he sees fit.
  It was unofficial&mdash;not in front of witnesses&mdash;and it stands. He
  took me up; said he&rsquo;d give me the thrashing of my life. He also
  promised not to make a goat of Catesby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, he has charged Captain Catesby with neglect of duty in
  permitting those two tons of TNT to be stolen from a truck on a railway
  siding. Catesby is under arrest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I say what I think about that, just between you and
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not! But for your insolence to Jenkins I could have
  brought him to book over this business.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you see the predicament you&rsquo;ve put me in? This isn&rsquo;t
  the first time Jenkins has covered his own shortcomings by putting blame on a
  subordinate. I&rsquo;ve been watching my chance to turn you loose on him. He
  gives it to me by accusing Catesby, and you spoil it! You&rsquo;re the one
  man Jenkins is afraid of; but how can I send you to investigate him now
  without upholding a breach of discipline?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything to make amends that you would do, sir, if
  you stood in my shoes,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine myself in your shoes,&rdquo; Kettle retorted.
  &ldquo;I was never guilty of insubordination in my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe you never had reason,&rdquo; Jim answered. &ldquo;What I said
  to him was in private. There were no witnesses, but he promised not to make a
  goat of Catesby. It&rsquo;s his word against mine, and if he dares press that
  charge against me I shall call him a liar in open court, and take the
  consequences.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind. You&rsquo;ll go to Ludd at
  once, clear Captain Catesby if you can, find the real culprit, and do your
  utmost to whitewash Jenkins in the process.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving for Ludd by motor in twenty minutes myself. I
  shall see Jenkins and arrange that he&rsquo;ll accept an apology, which you
  will make to him the moment you arrive. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand I&rsquo;m to apologize. Yes, I&rsquo;ll do that, since
  you wish it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay at Ludd until you&rsquo;ve cleaned up,&rdquo; the
  administration added deliberately. &ldquo;There has been a lot of thieving
  down there that looks like organized conspiracy. Dig to the bottom of it.
  That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Outside the room Jim lit a cigarette and chuckled to
  himself. If there was one man on earth whom he despised and hated it was
  Brigadier-General Jenkins.</p>

  <p>Nor was he alone in that particular. He more than suspected that the
  administrator shared his feelings; and he knew for a fact that half the
  British Army in Palestine loathed the man for his blatant
  self-advertising.</p>

  <p>So to be told to go to work to whitewash Jenkins appealed to his sense of
  humor, the more so as he divined that underneath the administrator&rsquo;s
  actual words there lay another meaning. Jim and Sir Henry Kettle understood
  each other pretty accurately as a rule. Discipline was to be upheld at all
  costs. Well and good; he would apologize. But since half-measures formed no
  part of Jim&rsquo;s philosophy, he decided to carry out the
  administrator&rsquo;s instructions to the letter and to find some way of
  giving Jenkins such an elegant coat of white as should embarrass even that
  praise-hungry brigadier.</p>

  <p>Fair play and Sir Henry Kettle were synonymous terms. Therefore there was
  more in this than met the eye. Therefore&mdash;&ldquo;Forward,
  march!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He walked down the echoing corridor chuckling to himself, and almost ran
  into Colonel Goodenough, a commander of Sikhs who cherished a good soldier as
  he did a horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Morning, Grim. Got a K.C. B. or something? What&rsquo;s the good
  news? Share it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to Ludd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Ludd deliver us! Fleas&mdash;sand&mdash;centipedes&mdash;raw
  recruits&mdash;sick horses&mdash;thieves&mdash;and the man&rsquo;s happy! Are
  there any more at home like you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I need one of your men to go with me, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the joke, is it? Well, it&rsquo;s on you. You
  can&rsquo;t have him. I&rsquo;m short of men. There seem to be only two
  classes of people in universal demand in Jerusalem&mdash;Sikhs and jailbirds;
  jailbirds for the dirty work, and Sikhs to push perambulators. Every man in
  my regiment has two men&rsquo;s work to do. I won&rsquo;t spare one of
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lend me Narayan Singh, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;it, he&rsquo;s my best man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. That&rsquo;s why I want him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s priceless. If you want my private opinion he could run
  the regiment better than I can. Why, I use that man to teach my officers
  their business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reward him then,&rdquo; Jim answered. &ldquo;Give him a job after
  his own heart. Send him with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indefinite. I&rsquo;m to smell out the thieves at Ludd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it&rsquo;s true&mdash;that would be a picnic for Narayan
  Singh. He deserves a treat. But if you get him killed or seriously injured
  I&rsquo;ll murder you. Why, I spent all one night in No Man&rsquo;s Land at
  Gaza hunting for that man rather than lose him; I wouldn&rsquo;t have done as
  much for my grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That how you got the V.C.?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;it, yes. And Narayan Singh got nothing, although I
  recommended him until I was sick of writing letters. He&rsquo;d done ten time
  what I did. If you borrow him I want him back all in one piece marker
  &lsquo;perishable.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Watch that he doesn&rsquo;t get malaria down at Ludd. Don&rsquo;t
  overwork him. See that he gets regular meals. I tell you, that man&rsquo;s
  precious!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How soon can I have him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to the lines now. Come in my car and get
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They went down the Mount of Olives at Goodenough&rsquo;s
  usual speed, which was not based on such considerations as the view, or the
  nerves either, of Jerusalem, and brought up presently in a cloud of dust in
  front of a marquee behind a barbed-wire fence on the outskirts of the city.
  Two minutes later Narayan Singh, lean, enormous, bearded, looked straight
  into his colonel&rsquo;s eyes across the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to go with this officer, Narayan Singh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Atcha, sahib</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to bring him back from Ludd alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Atcha, sahib</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Otherwise do whatever he tells you to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Atcha,</i> colonel <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;March with your kit to the station and meet Major Grim there in
  time for the morning train. Dismiss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sikh saluted and fell away, but his brown eyes met Jim&rsquo;s with a
  flare of gratitude. It was almost ferocious, like the expression of a hound
  unchained for sport. Jim nodded to him, but neither said a word.</p>

  <p>Jim borrowed the colonel&rsquo;s car and drove to the junior staff
  officer&rsquo;s mess, where he went upstairs in a hurry. Finding nobody in
  his own room, he went on up to the attic and stooped over an enormous
  packing-case. Groping in it, he pulled out a black foot, followed by a small
  boy, whose wooly hair suggested the Sudan and a mother sold into Arab
  slavery. His features were certainly Arabic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You lucky, lucky little devil! Twelve hours&rsquo; sleep out of
  twenty- four&mdash;just think of it! Wake up now and pack you kit; roll it
  into your blanket and come with me to the station.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Jimgrim? Are we transferred?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to learn to ask no questions when you get your
  marching- orders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Jimgrim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Narayan Singh will inspect that kit when you get to the station.
  Better be careful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He left the boy sleepily arranging on a blanket all the odds and ends that
  had appealed to his eight-year-old imagination since Jim discovered him
  starving one winter night in the drafty archway of the Jaffa Gate. They were
  pretty much the same things that a small boy born in America would
  choose&mdash;a tin can, a broken knife, a mouth-organ, a picture out of a
  magazine, an incomplete pack of playing cards, some half-smoked cigarettes
  and a broken mousetrap&mdash;all frightfully important.</p>

  <p>Jim packed into his own kit three complete changes of native costume, and
  was ready first.</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh was the only one of Jim&rsquo;s friends who did not object
  to Suliman; the only one who took it for granted that the profit of fostering
  a small boy might outweigh the trouble, and who was thoroughly willing to
  share the trouble and forego all profit.</p>

  <p>The Sikh took charge of Suliman at the station, made him unroll his kit on
  the platform, rebuked him because the broken knife-blade was not clean,
  solemnly suggested proper ways of polishing the outside of a tine box, and
  invent on the spot the only moral and properly complicated way of packing
  such possessions in a blanket.</p>

  <p>In the flat-wheeled train that bumped and pounded through the gorge
  leading down from Jerusalem Narayan Singh came forward from the third-class
  end of the train to find Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The <i>butcha</i> will make a man, <i>sahib</i>,&rdquo; he
  announced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s his latest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I asked him what he supposes our <i>sahib</i> intends to do with
  him at Ludd.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Though I could hide in your beard, Narayan Singh,&rsquo; he
  said, &lsquo;and you have killed your man a dozen times, yet I shall be a
  soldier before you are. For though you do not know enough not know enough not
  to ask questions when you have had marching orders, nevertheless I know
  enough not to answer you.&rsquo; How is that, <i>sahib</i>, from a
  <i>butcha</i> hardly higher than my knee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He learns. But see he doesn&rsquo;t smoke too much, and when he
  swears beat him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brigadier-General Jenkins was on the station-platform at Ludd, cutting
  quite a figure, what with his upstanding bulk and the number of obedient
  subalterns grouped all about him. The set stage was obvious at once. The
  administrator&rsquo;s motor had evidently come faster than the train. Jenkins
  had been ordered to accept an apology, and for lack of any better means of
  showing spite had arranged to make it as public as possible.</p>

  <p>Jim, with Narayan Singh at his heels carrying all the baggage, walked
  straight up to him and saluted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Major Grim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I apologize.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins turned a little to one side in order better to include the
  crowd.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For presuming to speak to you as a man and my equal the other day
  instead of as a person of higher rank. I withdraw all I said, including the
  imputation. Do you accept?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins nodded. Having his orders from higher up, it was all he could do.
  The subalterns smirked as he turned on his heel, and two or three of them
  winked at Jim. Narayan Singh was the only one who spoke, growling into
  Jim&rsquo;s ear as he once more gathered up the baggage:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lead on, Jimgrim, <i>sahib</i>. I have seen the day when stronger
  boars than that one bit the dust!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;That was only an American devil. This is a
  Palestine one. They are much worse.&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE is one good thing, at any rate, about being
  commissioned under army regulations. It is true that you have to concede
  gentility to seniors sometimes ignorant of the crudest meaning of the word;
  but on the other hand you yourself remain a presumptive gentleman until the
  contrary is proven. You are liable to arrest at the whim of arrogance; but
  you don&rsquo;t have to find bail, or sit in a cell until your case comes up
  for hearing.</p>

  <p>So Jim found Catesby taking it easy in a deckchair in his tent&mdash;a
  pretty good tent, nicely hung with souvenirs of the East from Cairo to
  Bokhara, with soda-water siphons in a basket full of wet grass slung from the
  ridge-pole in the sun to keep them cool, and plenty to read.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, Uncle Sam. What are you doing here? Come in. Make yourself
  at home. I heard you were under arrest in Jeroosh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I apologized.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lucky devil. Wish an apology might fumigate my official rep. Afraid
  I&rsquo;m damned. How on earth did you manage it? Jinks had been bragging all
  over the shop that he&rsquo;d as good as broke you. Mother of me! D&rsquo;you
  mean to say you&rsquo;re at liberty and camping on Jinks&rsquo; trail?
  Oh&mdash;what was that word of Roosevelt&rsquo;s&mdash;oh, bully! Jimgrim, if
  you get Jenkins&rsquo; number I&rsquo;ll pledge myself to black your boots
  from now to doomsday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My orders are to whitewash him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, damn! That means good-by me. Home for me on a troopship to what
  used to be Merrie England&mdash;broke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Incidentally I&rsquo;ve orders to clear you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done, old man; not if the impeccable Jinks is to
  save his face. They tell me <i>sub rosa</i> that he&rsquo;s cooking up half a
  dozen extra charges to make sure of breaking me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo; Jim chuckled. &ldquo;All this firm
  asks is orders. Goods delivered while you wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But listen; we haven&rsquo;t an earthly. Two tons of TNT came in a
  truck consigned by mistake to this brigade. The R.T.O. (railway man) shot it
  into a sliding and notified Jinks, who probably lost the advice or lit his
  pipe with it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three days later the Air Force, who were expecting the stuff, began
  to make inquires&mdash;twisted the tail of the R.T.O. to help his
  memory&mdash;went to the siding&mdash;found the truck&mdash;seals
  broken&mdash;no TNT. Went to Jinks promptly. Jinks blustered as
  usual&mdash;denied all knowledge of the consignment&mdash;was shown a copy of
  the R.T.O&rsquo;s memorandum&mdash;remembered a few stale grudges against me,
  and swore he had give me orders to go and take charge of the stuff the moment
  it came. I was sent for, and it was the first I&rsquo;d heard of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In less than two minutes he had me under arrest to await court
  martial for culpable negligence and disobedience to orders. I shall plead not
  guilty, of course. He&rsquo;ll swear he gave me orders. I&rsquo;ll deny it.
  His word against mine. <i>Maalesh</i>&mdash;feenish!&mdash;as the Arabs
  say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What other charges can he bring against you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anything he pleases. What&rsquo;s the odds? There&rsquo;s so much
  thieving going on in this camp&mdash;no thieves caught or stuff
  recovered&mdash;that any sort of charge against anyone gets believed. How can
  you possibly checkmate a brigadier like Jenkins in the
  circumstances?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever kill a dog?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bullet. Poison. Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say there are more ways of killing them than by choking them
  to death with butter; but suppose we try butter just this once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jinks&rsquo;ll eat all the butter there is and yell for
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try him. Tell me what you know, or guess, or think,
  about that TNT. You know I&rsquo;ve discovered the stuff in Jerusalem? There
  was a Moslem plot to blow up the Dome of the Rock and blame it on the
  Zionists. Who&rsquo;s the worst fanatic in these parts?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the Hebron men are fanatics; you know that. They&rsquo;re the
  principal thieves. They hide all over the place, and grease themselves at
  night, and slip past the sentries. Once in a while one gets skewered with a
  bayonet or shot, but the look outweighs the risk, and for one that gets
  napooed twenty get away with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kettle told me it looked like organized conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. It&rsquo;s just half-brother Ishmael with
  his hand against every man and every man&rsquo;s hand against him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard of any sheik or priest or trader hereabouts
  who&rsquo;s getting rich and uppish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s simply a case of flies around a jam-pot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See you later,&rdquo; said Jim, grinning to hide from Catesby his
  own appreciation of the fact that the brigadier held all the trump cards.</p>

  <p>He continued to wear the grin by way of self-encouragement.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Every circumstance, condition, situation and characteristic
  has its advantage, only so few know how to look for them. Still, a more than
  normally alert man can stumble on advantage now and then; and if he has
  trained himself he can sometimes make the most of what turns up. Individuals
  seem to have special values in the eternal scheme. The especial merit of
  Suliman was that, being a small boy, he hero-worshiped and at the same time
  believed implicitly in bogies.</p>

  <p>The merit of a Sikh is different. He, too, worships heroes, but from
  another point of view; and the more he happens to believe in the unseen, the
  more suspicious he is of the unexplainable that can be seen and touched and
  heard. But this both Sikhs and small boys have in common, that they love the
  lines and the gossip of the lines.</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh, given no orders to the contrary, could not more have kept
  away from the tents where other Sikhs were idling the time away that Suliman
  could have done, orders to the contrary of not.</p>

  <p>Jim went to the row of tents reserved for visiting officers, discovered
  his bed already made and kit unpacked, but nothing of Narayan Singh or
  Suliman. There was a Sikh mounting guard at either end of the short line, but
  they knew no more than that Narayan Singh had come and gone again, taking the
  <i>butcha</i> with him. So he set off to explore the camp on his own
  accord.</p>

  <p>Ludd, which was Lystra when they wrote the Bible, is one of those places
  that fills the military mind with wonder at civilian complacency, and stirs
  civilians to murmur at the thoughtlessness of army men. The town itself is
  practically undefendable. Yet there has always been a town there, in a land
  where raid and robbery are the normal thing; and wherever Jew, Egyptian,
  Philistine, Syrian, Babylonian, Roman, Mongol, crusader and Turk in turn have
  razed the place, its inhabitants have always built it up again very much as
  ants rebuild a ruined hill.</p>

  <p>It sits on a sandy plain at the foot of the Judean Hills, from which
  plunderers can swoop down on it at their discretion. There is practically no
  water except in the rainy season, when there is a lot too much. There are
  snakes, mosquitoes, centipedes, bed-bugs, fleas and flies. And the largest
  army in the Near East was camped there, drawing its drinking-water all the
  way from Egypt through an iron pipe made in the U.S.A.</p>

  <p>The secret of that is that, although the surrounding hills are perfectly
  contrived by nature to be robbers&rsquo; fastnesses, and the plains below
  were manifestly meant for robbers&rsquo; meat, you can&rsquo;t supply and
  maneuver an army readily among the hills, whereas Ludd is not only a railway
  junction but is an excellent pushing-off place in every direction, with ample
  room for store- sheds, airplanes, cavalry lines and what not. So the army,
  depending on mobility for its security, tolerated the climate and conditions,
  while the thieves descended from places in the hills, like Hebron, and grew
  fat.</p>

  <p>Jim strolled about the camp enjoying himself more or less, as any man must
  who loves with devouring interest whatever lives. In an armed camp the very
  gun-mules learn a new intelligence; and the dogs, without which in dozens no
  British army&mdash;or American for that matter&mdash;could maintain its
  social self- respect, come nearer to being impudently human than in any other
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>There is tidiness, even among barbed-wire and prickly-pear entanglements,
  and a sense of getting the very utmost out of life (which is true humor as
  well as sound economy) that may become monotonous to those in camp, but
  thrill the new arrivals. And there are all the minor innovations made by
  individual commanding officers for making something out of nothing for the
  men&rsquo;s sake, to be admired, or criticized, if you are half-observant.
  Nothing much escaped Jim&rsquo;s eye or missed its lodgment in his memory.
  But there was nothing that looked like a cord for hanging Jenkins.</p>

  <p>At the end of an hour of all-observant sauntering he returned to the
  station to interview the R.T.O., a red-necked, overworked, opinionative
  despot (like the rest of them; it seems you can&rsquo;t run a military
  railway and be tolerant of other people&rsquo;s feelings). Someone in the
  early days of war had dug this man out from a freight-junction in a London
  suburb, put him in uniform, and he had done the rest. He did not mind who
  knew it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho! So you&rsquo;re another that wants to know about that TNT? I
  told all I knew the minute they asked me. Facts at my fingers&rsquo; ends.
  Made my report in writing. Nothing more to say!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But there are ways of getting under the thick skin even of an R.T.O.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much truth is there in the story that you get commissions from
  the thieves who loot the railway?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, me? Who says that? Hell&rsquo;s bells! This gang&rsquo;ud
  accuse their wet- nurse of selling milk! Anything missing? Blame the R.T.O.!
  Horse breaks away&mdash;sepoy get a dose of colic&mdash;general lose his
  shaving-brush? Require explanations in triplicate from the R.T.O.! Train two
  minutes late? Arrest the R.T.O. for mutiny! That&rsquo;s the life I lead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen. That TNT arrived in a truck. None o&rsquo; my business. I
  ain&rsquo;t the hen that laid the stuff. I wrote out an advice on the proper
  form and sent it up to Jenkins, ordered the truck into number nineteen
  siding, and says to myself, &lsquo;There, that&rsquo;s the end of
  that&mdash;damn it!&rsquo; and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned that <i>is</i>
  the end of it. I&rsquo;m busy. But if there&rsquo;s a man in Palestine from
  general downwards who wants to swap me two piasters against all the
  commissions I get from thieves or anyone, walk him up to my office and
  we&rsquo;ll make the trade. <i>Good</i> morning!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was nothing to be unearthed there. The man was obviously as honest
  as self-satisfied. Jim strolled back to the camp and through the mule-
  transport lines, where he found Narayan Singh squatting on the sand in deep
  converse with a dozen grooms. Six or seven tents away Suliman was smoking a
  cigarette and gambling with three Arab urchins of about his own age.</p>

  <p>He caught Narayan Singh&rsquo;s eye and nodded, passing on without
  disturbing the group to pounce on Suliman, turn him upside down and shake him
  until the unearthed increment of small coins fell into the sand to be fought
  for by the other three.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But not all that money was won from them!&rdquo; Suliman
  objected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. Teach you not to gamble.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Suliman had to run to keep up and lost breath in the process
  for the sand made heavy going. But he talked all the way, remonstrating at
  first about the loss of all that wit-won money, and, when remonstrance failed
  to produce the least effect, forgetting it in an intermittent flow of gossip.
  That being exactly what Jim wanted, there began to be abrupt replies that
  brought forth more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And, Jimgrim, this Ludd must be an evil place, although I like the
  mules and horses and dogs and men and everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with it, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is an <i>iblis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A devil, is there? What does the devil do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is captain of the thieves. He dances at night in the hills, and
  the thieves bring him what they steal. He is <i>abras</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A leper is he? Have to start to P.M.O. on his trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. They say the chief doctor is afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because besides being <i>abras</i> he is
  <i>mukaddas</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Holy, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a <i>derwish</i> (dervish). They say he bewitches men by
  dancing, and after that the sentries can&rsquo;t see to shoot them or kill
  them with bayonets. I am afraid of the <i>iblis</i> Jimgrim. You will have to
  let me sleep inside your tent, because it is too dangerous outside under the
  sky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me some more about the <i>iblis</i>. What is his
  name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say he has no name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nowhere&mdash;that is, everywhere! He comes and goes&mdash;first
  men see him in one place, then in another. They say he wears no clothes
  except a turban, and has beastly great marks of leprosy all over him. They
  say that if a soldier sees him, he can never shoot straight again, and when a
  man touches him, that man dies within the day. Oh, Jimgrim, suppose he should
  come in the night!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim sat down on the &ldquo;deckchair, officer&rsquo;s one&rdquo; provided
  by a thoughtful War Office, and grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me the right idea, youngster. Just for gambling
  you shall investigate this <i>iblis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allah forbid! I would not even go with you to look at
  him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Then you shall wear girl&rsquo;s clothes for a
  year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Aib! Ana bkul la!</i> (Shame! I say no!) Rather I will promise
  never to gamble again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve promised before. You have gambled again. Now
  you&rsquo;ve got to choose&mdash;forward like a man to find the <i>iblis</i>,
  or a girl&rsquo;s clothes for twelve months.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could run away to some village, Jimgrim. You would never find
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suit yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you were my age, Jimgrim, would you have gone to look for an
  <i>iblis</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Kizzab mutkarbik!</i> (You are a big liar!)&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hunted one before I was your age and found it was made of a
  pumpkin, a beanpole and a sheet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was only an American devil. This is a Palestine one. They are
  much worse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s bad unless you&rsquo;re afraid of it,&rdquo; said
  Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not gambling? I am not afraid of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re afraid of the consequences&mdash;girl&rsquo;s
  clothes for a year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suliman stamped his foot and swore a steady stream of brimstone
  Arabic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember, you&rsquo;re only allowed ten swears a day!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a man! I will not wear a girl&rsquo;s clothes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the <i>iblis</i> is a man when you lay hold of
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to find out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that moment Narayan Singh arrived silently, and saluted in the tent
  door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the camp is by the ears about a <i>shaitan</i> (devil),
  <i>sahib</i>. He is said to make thieves invisible and to cast a spell on
  soldiers so that they can never shoot or stab straight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I hear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say he may not be hunted because Moslems think his person is
  sacred. They say, too, he is a leper; yet the medical officer may not arrest
  him for the same reason. Yet some say he is captain of the thieves. Shall we
  two take him in hand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. First thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does your honor want him alive? What if I put his sacredness to the
  test with a bullet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better investigate him first; there may be others. Be ready to come
  with me after dark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Atcha, sahib</i>. Shall I place Suliman with friends who will
  look after him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>La!</i> (No)&rdquo; yelled Suliman. &ldquo;I am a better man
  that any Sikh! I tell you I go too!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Now I won&rsquo;t hear a word from you against
  Jenkins&mdash;not one word!&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">FROM a cursory inspection of that camp, such as any ordinary
  visitor might give it, the impression would have been gained that
  Brigadier-General Jenkins was supreme. That was because his brigade command
  chance to lie nearest to the station, and his notion of the only way to
  achieve success in life was through advertisement.</p>

  <p>Like many a commercial upstart of the type that he admired, advertisement
  had done a lot for him, and presently turned his head. To carry the metaphor
  further, he was becoming &ldquo;overextended,&rdquo; pyramiding
  &ldquo;futures&rdquo; on the sudden profits of a chancy past. There were
  others than the administrator in Jerusalem aware of his ambition and the
  meager grounds for it.</p>

  <p>For instance, there was Major-General Anthony V.C. etc., in supreme
  command at Ludd, whom the public had hardly ever heard of because he cared to
  serve his country only, not himself. Jim found him in his shirt sleeves in
  the great marquee that overlooked the whole camp from rising ground at the
  rear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Grim. Sit down. General Kettle was here this
  morning. He gave you some orders himself, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve apologized already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. You&rsquo;re in my bad books, though. I was absent in Egypt
  when that TNT was lost. That gave Jenkins a chance to shift the blame, and he
  made the most of it. Now, thanks to your recovering the stuff and your
  block-headed idiocy in falling foul of him, Jenkins gets a new lease.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between you and me, Grim, he is one of those&mdash;politicians.
  Friends in the War Office, you know, and all that kind of thing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There seems no way of getting rid of him. He reached his present
  eminence by being recommended for promotion by one C.O. after another, who
  couldn&rsquo;t endure him by didn&rsquo;t want to quarrel with his powerful
  friends.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His career is one long story of innocent fellows punished or broke
  to hide his shortcomings. Now, thanks to your infernal hot temper, he looks
  like breaking poor young Catesby, who&rsquo;s an efficient young officer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the logical man to have followed up that TNT business.
  You had it in hand and were successful beyond expectation. If you&rsquo;d
  held your idiotic tongue, instead of telling Jenkins what you thought of him,
  I could have turned you loose down here, and what with his dislike of you and
  your brains I don&rsquo;t doubt he&rsquo;d have tripped himself out of the
  Army in a week or so.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But imagine what a whip hand it would give Jenkins over me if it
  transpired that I had proceeded against him on charges brought by a major who
  had been ordered to apologize to him for insubordination only a few days
  before! Do you see what your hotheadedness has done?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I won&rsquo;t hear a word from you against Jenkins&mdash;not
  one word! You&rsquo;re to investigate the thieving that&rsquo;s going on down
  here, but I shall make a point of telling Jenkins myself this afternoon that
  you are here in his interest as much as anyone&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;is there anything I can do to simplify matters for you in
  any way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ought to have Catesby&rsquo;s assistance, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s under arrest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Catesby needs time and opportunity to hunt up evidence in his own
  defense, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has made no such request to me. It would have to come from him,
  not you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his next friend. If it comes to a court martial I shall
  defend him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. You propose to ignore my wigging and fall foul of the
  brigadier in that way, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely no, sir! I&rsquo;ll carry out your orders to the
  letter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll trust you. A note shall go to Jenkins asking
  him to release Captain Catesby&rsquo;s parole for fourteen days to enable him
  to look up evidence. Anything else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of the <i>iblis</i>, of course?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The leper who dances in the moonlight? Yes. He&rsquo;s quite a
  problem. I was for having him hunted and bagged alive. The P.M.O. wants him
  interned as a danger to the health of the whole neighborhood, though where
  the&mdash;he&rsquo;d intern him I don&rsquo;t know. But some politician has
  been pulling strings. It seems the leper is a religious mystic held in high
  regard by the Moslems, and orders have come that he&rsquo;s not to be
  interfered with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say in the lines that this <i>iblis</i> is the captain of the
  thieves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know they do. I&rsquo;ve known of things ten times more
  improbable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;whatever politician pulled
  the strings is probably interested in the thieving.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The order to let the leper alone came from Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not override it on the ground of military
  expediency?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because, the war&rsquo;s over, Grim, and the politicians are
  getting the upper hand. The way is being paved for civil government, and for
  every once that I override the political department I get ten defeats.
  I&rsquo;m disposed now to let the politicians mix their own litter and lie in
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim was a lot too wise to ask permission after that to tackle the
  <i>iblis</i>. It was sufficient that he had no orders not to tackle him. But
  he was more mystified than ever. Just as Sir Henry Kettle had done that
  morning, General Anthony seemed to be deliberately leaving the course
  unobstructed which, if Jim could find it, might lead to Jenkins&rsquo;
  undoing. Why in thunder couldn&rsquo;t they tackle Jenkins outright, he
  wondered.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He went straight to Jenkins&rsquo; ten and sent his name in
  by the orderly, but was kept waiting five minutes while the brigadier
  whistled a tune; for there is nothing like cooling a junior&rsquo;s heels,
  according to some folk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you tell me anything, sir, that might lead to the discovery of
  who stole the TNT?&rdquo; he asked when he was admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hah! So our wonderful, astute American has come for assistance, eh?
  I thought you were such an expert intelligence officer that you never needed
  anyone&rsquo;s advice? Glad to come to me after all, eh? What anticlimax! I
  dare say you wish now you&rsquo;d made that apology a little more humble and
  less technical?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no one else in the tent, although there might have been some
  eavesdropper listening behind it, for Jenkins knew no limits when his own
  advantage was in question. Jim took a grip on himself, and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been rebuked twice this morning for what I said to you
  the other day. Twice I&rsquo;ve pledged myself to make amends, if I can, buy
  getting all possible credit for you out of the clearing up of this thieving
  business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If there was one thing more than another on which Brigadier-General
  Jenkins prided himself it was his ability to read men and take advantage of
  their peculiarities. Next to that he considered his claim to success lay in
  swift appraisal of subsurface reasons&mdash;political judgement in other
  words.</p>

  <p>Jim Grim he assessed as one of those slaves of integrity, who value their
  own word above all other considerations; a slave, moreover, who had no
  influential backing. He did not doubt that whatever Jim had promised to do he
  would do, whoever might be discommoded in the process. There were only two
  men who could have made Jim promise&mdash;Kettle and Anthony&mdash;and only
  someone higher up still who could have actuated them; therefore somebody
  attached to headquarters in Cairo must have been pulling more than usually
  effective strings.</p>

  <p>There might even have come definite instructions from the Foreign Office
  in London that the way must be paved for Brigadier-General Jenkins&rsquo;
  appointment to a civil post. The day of civil government was rapidly
  approaching. He himself had worked all the backstairs wires. There were more
  unlikely things.</p>

  <p>Jenkins was no simpleton. He understood perfectly that both Kettle and
  Anthony detested and despised him; and, blinded by his own conceit, he
  supposed they would be willing to praise him with their tongues in their
  cheeks in order to get rid of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soho!&rdquo; he remarked, and whistled a bar or two.</p>

  <p>Jim, loathing him, skin, bone and stuffing, stood with a straight face,
  waiting while the brigadier turned his stalwart back to think.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re to pull together, are we, eh? Well&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  not vindictive. I&rsquo;d half a mind to ruin your career&mdash;d&rsquo;you
  know that? I won&rsquo;t stand insolence from any man. <i>Nemo me impune
  lacessit</i>; that&rsquo;s my motto. I&rsquo;ve got teeth, and I like the
  world to know it. However, as you seem eager to reinforce a lame apology by
  doing the right thing, I&rsquo;ll bet bygones be bygones and we&rsquo;ll
  forget the incident.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s memory was reputed to be a trifle more retentive that that,
  had Jenkins stopped to think, but the brigadier was full steam ahead already
  on the track of self-advancement with the terminus in view. The brakes
  weren&rsquo;t working.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down. Now this thieving that has been going on in the camp is a
  perfectly scandalous business. There&rsquo;s no excuse for it. Not counting
  that TNT, which was returned to store&mdash;thanks to some extent, I believe
  to your efforts&mdash;the Army has lost a hundred and nine rifles in three
  months, to say nothing of countless rounds of

ammunition&mdash;blankets&mdash;groceries&mdash;soap&mdash;underclothing&mdash;
  and stores of all kinds. Incompetence, of course. Best not to mention
  names.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between you and me, I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the Army auditor to
  check things up and discover how much is missing. That&rsquo;s done now. They
  know in Cairo just how much remissness there has been.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s the time, then, for somebody to get credit for changing
  that state of affairs. You&rsquo;re a man who&rsquo;s had rapid promotion;
  there&rsquo;s no need to tell you that the paving of the short cut consists
  of other men&rsquo;s mistakes. Very well. Somebody will have to pay; but what
  is that man&rsquo;s poison may turn out to be your meat and mine. D&rsquo;you
  get my meaning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a cigar. It&rsquo;s obvious to the meanest
  intelligence&mdash;or at least it ought to be obvious, you&rsquo;d
  think&mdash;that these thieves have a headquarters. Any general with half an
  eye would recognize signs of the thieves being organized. That means
  they&rsquo;ve got a leader&mdash;perhaps two or three men, but more likely
  one&mdash;directing all of them. Is that much clear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds obvious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is. My notion of a good commanding office is a man with his ear
  to the ground, who listens, and knows what the men are saying. Any man with
  only one ear, and that half full of wax, would know that it&rsquo;s common
  talk in this camp that the captain of thieves is a notorious leper. Have you
  heard of him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you heard any reasonable explanation as to why he&rsquo;s left
  at liberty? No, of course you haven&rsquo;t, for there is none. There&rsquo;s
  a reason given, of course, but it&rsquo;s childish. They&rsquo;re afraid of
  offending the Moslems. Now listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead. I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a drink. Help yourself. Now who would stand to gain most by
  stealing weapons? Eh? Who are they who want to possess a country owned by
  present by Arabs&mdash;who are being threatened everlastingly by
  Arabs&mdash;who have no weapons of their own, and whose grip on the country
  is only made temporarily possible by an army of occupation dependent on the
  whims of a Foreign Office? The Zionists, eh? D&rsquo;you get me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean this: The Arabs have lots of weapons hidden away. The
  Zionists have none&mdash;or had none until this thieving started. The
  Zionists believe, what I&rsquo;m quite sure of, that they&rsquo;re going to
  get left in the lurch by our Foreign Office sooner or later. So they&rsquo;ve
  hired Arabs to steal rifles for them, for Jews to use against Arabs later on.
  D&rsquo;you follow me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see the drift.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kettle and Anthony and the rest of them imagine that the Zionists
  are going to have it all their own way with the backing of the British
  Government. But I know better. I happen to have influential connections at
  home who keep me posted; and between you and me the Zionists are going to be
  told before long to paddle their own canoe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, the Zionists have their own friends at the Foreign
  Office, who keep them posted, too; they know as well as you and I do
  what&rsquo;s likely to happen, and that the minute it does they&rsquo;ll be
  at the mercy of the Arabs unless they can arm themselves in advance. Failing
  arms, they&rsquo;ll have to get out of the country. That&rsquo;s inevitable
  finally; they&rsquo;ll have to get out. You can take my word for it, the
  solution of this Palestine problem is going to be an Arab kingdom. The
  Zionists haven&rsquo;t a chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim saw no reason to argue with a man who chose to back a losing horse. He
  sat still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rather think General Anthony himself suspects this thieving is
  the work of Zionists,&rdquo; Jenkins went on. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s afraid of
  Zionists, as well as more than half in favor of them. I&rsquo;m not. I know
  which side my bread is buttered on, and I&rsquo;m pro-Arab to the core. Are
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely partial to Arabs,&rdquo; Jim answered
  guardedly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help liking them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll just take a fall out of the Zionists ahead of time,
  and let the Arabs know who their individual friends are, with an eye to the
  future. Get after that <i>iblis</i>, as they call him, Grim, as soon as you
  like. Scratch him and I think you&rsquo;ll find a Jew; if not, you&rsquo;ll
  discover a Jew somewhere back of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought of getting on his trail tonight,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good. Do. Report to me and to no one else. See you in the morning,
  then. So long.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ten minutes later Jim turned up at Catesby&rsquo;s tent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;home on a trooper&rsquo; for you, old man! This Jenkins
  bird is going to provide you with work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to whitewash the brute!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. The Lord alone knows how yet, but he shall have such an
  elegant ducking in white paint that it won&rsquo;t ever come off. Your
  parole&rsquo;s to be raised for fourteen days, and we&rsquo;ll work together
  to pump Jinks so full of self- importance that he&rsquo;ll burst. Meanwhile,
  I&rsquo;ll get some sleep. You do the same. Don&rsquo;t forget, if anybody
  asks, that you need liberty to hunt up evidence to clear yourself. So
  long.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Moreover, Jimgrim, you are my
  friend!&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">NO city in the world can vie with a great camp for binding
  spells, by night especially; for the city only represents what men have done,
  whereas the camp allures with what they mean to do. The policeman at a
  crossing signifies that what today approves tomorrow will repeat. The sentry
  with firelight dancing on his pointed steel denotes the alertness of
  unfolding destiny. The entertainment of a city is the fruit of things
  accomplished, growing rotten, but the thrilling murmur of a camp by night is
  the prelude to new heavens and a new earth.</p>

  <p>There was no moon when Jim led the way between the whickering horse-
  lines, followed by Catesby, Narayan Singh and Suliman. They were all dressed
  as Arabs, so that every sentry challenged them, and once a bayonet point
  pierced through Jim&rsquo;s garments to his skin before he could reply; for
  the Sikh on duty likes his ceremony swift, and takes no chances.</p>

  <p>Each time that Jim whispered the password the four were followed into the
  shadows by wondering, suspicious eyes; then, as if afterthought increased
  suspicion, the sentry&rsquo;s voice would call out harshly to the next ahead,
  and three times before they reached the camp gate an officer was fetched to
  quiz them.</p>

  <p>In no single instance did Jim give the names of his party, not even when
  the guard at the gap in a barb wire fence that they called the south gate
  held them up for five minutes and scoffed at the slip of paper he produced.
  He did not want his movements gossiped all over the camp.</p>

  <p>So they were all four submitted to search at the gate as presumptive
  thieves, by a Sikh <i>jemadar</i> who feared no writing nor regarded
  words.</p>

  <p>His disrespectful fingers uncovered naturally three loaded automatic
  pistols; and&mdash;ace of unexpectedness&mdash;a Gurkha kukri from under
  Suliman&rsquo;s shirt. That settled it, of course.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Into the lock-up with them until morning!&rdquo; he ordered, being
  one of those priceless guardians who are not afraid of responsibility.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The luck&rsquo;s not running my way,&rdquo; grunted Catesby.
  &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll give Jinks the finest chance the brute could ask for to
  show me up in a bad light. My name&rsquo;s Walker!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it. Cut loose, Narayan Singh,&rdquo; Jim
  whispered.</p>

  <p>There followed an interlude in the Jat dialect that restored
  Catesby&rsquo;s normal high spirits, it being one of the conventions of the
  British Army that an officer of Sikhs must understand the language of his
  men, whereas the men&rsquo;s knowledge of English is optional and rather
  rare. It ended in Narayan Singh disrobing in the guardroom light to show his
  steel bracelet, the steel dagger in his hair, and certain other peculiarities
  of Sikh attire to which he is more loyal than a Scotsman to his kilts. Those,
  the language, and an intimate knowledge of he <i>jemadar&rsquo;s</i> own
  personal, private and amusing immortal history proved at last convincing.</p>

  <p>But the <i>jemadar</i> kept the kukri. There was not explaining that
  away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How shall I hunt an <i>iblis</i> without that thing?&rdquo;
  demanded Suliman, appealing to Jim in the shadow much too wise to argue with
  the Sikh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where did you get it? Did a Gurkha lend it to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. The fool refused. So I stole it while he drank.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on. We&rsquo;ve wasted time enough. You must face the
  <i>iblis</i> with bare hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now Catesby led, for he knew the lie of the land. Jim
  followed him, and Narayan Singh brought up the rear in darkness so deep that
  it was all one could do to keep the leading man in sight. The sky overhead
  was clear, and the stars shone like scattered diamonds, but they were
  following a shallow <i>wady</i> (valley) between cactus, and the gloom of the
  night before the worlds were made seemed to have gathered in it. They went
  nearly a mile at a slow pace before Catesby stopped to take his bearings.
  Then Jim missed Suliman.</p>

  <p>He did not dare shout for him, for that would have brought to the scene
  every scrub-haunting thief in the neighborhood. He called once in a low
  voice, but all the answer was the ghoul-like laugh of a hyena, and a moment
  later he made out the brute&rsquo;s green eyes, very low to the ground and
  moving the way a lantern swings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I rather thought it was a mistake to bring that kid,&rdquo; said
  Catesby. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t like to question your judgement of course,
  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He comes. I hear him, <i>sahib</i>,&rdquo; Narayan Singh
  whispered.</p>

  <p>A moment later the hyena snarled and scampered off, looking as big as a
  lion when his outline showed against the sky. Then they heard whimpering and
  hard breathing. Something or somebody stumbled, sobbed, and hurried on again
  toward them. Then Suliman burst into their midst and threw himself face
  foremost on the earth, heaving for lack of breath. He had something heavy in
  his hand. Jim picked it up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The kukri again! You young <i>luss</i> (robber)! How did you get
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That <i>jemadar</i> gave it to a sentry to hold, and the sentry
  laid it beside him on the ground where he could feel it with his foot. So I
  pulled the skirt of his overcoat and took the kukri when he turned. Then I
  ran.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t shoot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, for I took care that he saw me. Sikhs don&rsquo;t shoot at men
  of my size, for I have tried before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jim, do you still think I was wrong to bring the
  kid? Lead on, Catesby.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They took to the top of a sandy ridge that lead gradually
  upward to a low hill covered with cactus, from which by daylight there would
  be a fair view of half the camp, although now they could see little more than
  scattered lights that made the darkness more confusing. There was a short
  bare ridge on the hilltop, sandy like the rest but free from cactus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose we lie here till moonrise,&rdquo; Catesby proposed.
  &ldquo;Last time I saw the <i>iblis</i> was from just this place. I was
  waiting for a chance at a leopard and friend leper came instead, scaring
  everything away for miles around. He pretty nearly scared me stiff. Most
  awful looking brute you ever saw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see that hill opposite? You can just make out the outline of it
  against the sky. He danced on that and made me feel so creepy I vowed
  I&rsquo;d never dance again. Later he passed along this ridge so close that I
  thought he&rsquo;d trip over me. Ugh! I was glad he didn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s
  leprous from head to foot. It beats me how he holds together when he
  dances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They lay down on a shoulder of sand that overhung the shallow valley; and
  now the Arab costume they were wearing proved its virtue, for they could
  cover faces, hands and ankles from the mosquitoes that attacked in mass
  formation. Hooded like that under loose robes they looked like dead men. A
  badger came and sniffed them, then a hyena, then several jackals, remembering
  perhaps the fat times when men were fighting and the carrion lay thick.</p>

  <p>They lay an hour until the moon rose, like a huge blotched lamp beyond the
  other hill, and by that time Suliman was fast asleep and snoring. Narayan
  Singh shook him awake&mdash;lest he frighten the <i>iblis</i> away, as the
  Sikh was careful to explain. The notion that the <i>iblis</i> might be afraid
  of himself was new to Suliman, and he sat up to consider it, fingering the
  edge of the heavy, curved Gurkha blade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The game is to catch this beauty alive if we can,&rdquo; said Jim,
  &ldquo;but above all we mustn&rsquo;t scare him and let him get away from us.
  Better watch him for a week than rush in and fail. The next most important
  thing is not to kill him&mdash;bear that in mind, Narayan Singh; even you
  can&rsquo;t make a dead man talk, you know!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will plunge this kukri in his belly and discover whether an
  <i>iblis</i> has entrails if he comes near me!&rdquo; vowed Suliman.</p>

  <p>But a moment later he returned the great knife to its sheath and crept up
  close to Jim, with the hair raising so that his turban actually lifted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Jimgrim! Look! The <i>iblis!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naked in the reddish moonlight&mdash;framed, in fact, exactly in the
  middle of the orb that rose behind him, about two hundred yards distant from
  where they lay across the <i>wady</i>&mdash;glistening here and there as if
  his carcass had been smeared with whitish slime, a tall, lean, muscular man
  stood motionless, gazing toward the lights that indicated Ludd
  encampment.</p>

  <p>The turban on his head but emphasized the nakedness of all the rest of
  him. Nowhere in the East is the mere absence of clothes remarkable as a rule,
  although the Arab likes to drape himself in amble, loose array for the sake
  of dignity and comfort. But the man&rsquo;s nakedness was
  ghastly&mdash;impudent&mdash;a calculated, sheer affront&mdash;deliberate
  indecency so flaunted that the moonlight and the loneliness could not absorb
  it, and it shocked grown men.</p>

  <p>He was well shaped. No crippled limbs or unnatural abortion helped to
  horrify. It was an arrogance of nakedness, made monstrous by the will to
  assert itself. If he had stood among a hundred naked men, he alone would have
  seemed unclothed, and if you had clothed him he might likely have seemed
  naked still because of the outrageous insolence that owned him.</p>

  <p>For minute after minute he stood gazing at the camp, with his stomach
  thrust out in an attitude of self-complacency and his arms folded across his
  chest. Then, as if the turban on his head were too much concession to the
  prejudice of other folk, he began to unwind the thing, coiling the yards of
  cloth around his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; whispered Catesby. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
  he a horror? Isn&rsquo;t he a gruesome swine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In my land there are millions with no more than a yard or two of
  rag apiece; but that thing there is an insult to the gods, and he should
  die!&rdquo; declared Narayan Singh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, remember what I said. Don&rsquo;t kill him,&rdquo;
  Jim answered. &ldquo;He thinks he knows something or he wouldn&rsquo;t like
  himself so much. Let&rsquo;s find out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man began to posture on the hilltop, taking attitudes suggestive of
  the figures on Egyptian temple walls. He seemed conscious of the fact that
  the rising moon served to spotlight as well as background, for his movements
  were deliberately calculated to show up in silhouette. They were slow and
  strong and snakelike, but little by little the snake idea gained ascendancy
  until his whole body writhed in serpentine contortions.</p>

  <p>Then he began to dance. You could not watch the man and tear yourself away
  or make a move against him. He had the faculty of stirring curiosity and
  holding it, so that each move was a fascinating prelude to the next and you
  had to wait to see.</p>

  <p>The dance began with a rapid repetition of the Egyptian poses, so
  skillfully done that the infinitely tiny pause between each movement served
  to fix each posture in the watchers&rsquo; vision, and the whole became a
  motion picture in staccato time.</p>

  <p>All that while he kept the turban draped about his arm and it looked like
  an excrescence&mdash;something or other horrible&mdash;sometimes as if he had
  three arms on his right side, two growing out of one. But all at once he
  began to whirl the thing about him like a lariat until it formed a Saturn
  ring, in the midst of which he spun like a top on tiptoe, dervish
  fashion.</p>

  <p>Whoever on the countryside saw that would understand the meaning of it.
  The whirling turban was only an added stroke of genius to emphasize his
  eminence among his kind.</p>

  <p>The dancing dervish claims that by spinning for a length of time on tiptoe
  he can rid himself of human limitations and see clearly into the infinite.
  The ordinary dervish apes an arrogant humility before he starts; this fellow
  was assuming to confer with spiritual essences with banner whirling in the
  breeze&mdash;that was the only difference. There might be Moslems after that
  who would question his claim to miraculous vision and sanctity, but not many
  of them, and they would be kept in order by the rest.</p>

  <p>Suliman, with the creed of his ancestors half-learned and wholly in his
  veins, was quite convinced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is truly an <i>iblis</i>,&rdquo; he whispered with chattering
  teeth. &ldquo;There is nothing for us to do but leave him,
  Jimgrim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Jim was thinking then too busily to quiet the superstitious qualms of
  a small boy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Narayan Singh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sikh crept closer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know the lie of the land here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, <i>sahib</i>. But I could crawl up close and rush the brute. If
  I may not slay, I could hold him until you come and bind him with the
  turban.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Catesby!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The three laid their heads together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there any way of coming up behind him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Not without making a circuit of more than a mile. This hill
  we&rsquo;re on juts out from a ridge that leads in a curve to his hill.
  There&rsquo;s a thirty- foot cliff of sand on this side of him, too steep to
  climb in the dark. If we follow the ridge he&rsquo;d see us coming, unless we
  could get there before he stops spinning, and at that he has likely got a spy
  or two on the watch. To come up from behind him through the cactus would take
  twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimgrim, <i>sahib!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh laid a hand on Jim&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I steady this automatic on my forearm,&rdquo; the Sikh
  continued, &ldquo;resting my elbow on the ground&mdash;thus&mdash;in three or
  four shots I can hit him in the leg with certainty. Then he will limp, and we
  can catch him. Only say the word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The last time I saw him he came straight along the ridge and passed
  me after he&rsquo;d finished the ballet,&rdquo; whispered Catesby.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give him a chance to do it again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> pirouetted interminably, gaining rather than losing
  speed, the ring of cloth spreading out around him in an ever widening circle.
  If he really was a leper, then the disease had made strangely little inroad
  on his stamina.</p>

  <p>And for all that whoever watched grew giddy, the <i>iblis</i> himself
  retained full consciousness. For there came cloaked figures of men, who
  dodged in the shadows from bush to bush; and as they drew near he was aware
  of them and began to slow down gradually, letting the turban droop in ever
  narrowing curves, until he stood stock-still again, back to the moon, like a
  statue, glistening with sweat that made him shine now from head to foot
  instead of showing sliminess in patches.</p>

  <p>After standing rigid for about two minutes he stretched out his right arm
  toward the camp, and suddenly his voice boomed like a tenor bell, cursing in
  Arabic, cursing in the name of Allah the Lord of Creatures, the Prince of the
  Day of Judgment, cursing man and beast and tent and mechanism&mdash;eye,
  hand, ear and brain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you make of him?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen his kind in the mosques of Mosul and Marash,&rdquo;
  Catesby whispered. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s simply a dancing dervish from up
  north, driven away very likely because of his leprosy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Jim, too, had been in Mosul and Marash and seen the dancing dervishes.
  He reserved judgment.</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> turned at last toward the hooded figures that were
  crouching near him; and now he stretched out both arms, but whether or not he
  blessed them was not clear, for he lowered his voice. However, after a minute
  or two it was quite plain that he urged them to a certain course, for he
  flung his right hand out like an emperor ordering armies, and his chin went
  up so imperiously high that he moonlight sheened on his fierce eyes.</p>

  <p>The hooded figures vanished. They had come from different directions, but
  as far as one could judge in the uncertain light they were headed one way in
  single file when they disappeared into the cactus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;!&rdquo; Jim muttered suddenly, and Narayan Singh crept
  close again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>sahib</i>? What is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see? The <i>iblis</i> has gone too&mdash;and the
  wrong way for us, durn him!&mdash;toward the moon&mdash;due east. If we chase
  him now he&rsquo;ll simply run.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can stalk him, <i>sahib</i>. He will never see me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. The others are coming straight along the ridge in the
  shadows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can do better than that. Catesby?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once again you might have laid a handkerchief on all three heads.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming one by one. Bag the last one alive. Narayan
  Singh, gag him; take Suliman&rsquo;s turban&mdash;have it ready in your hand.
  I&rsquo;ll pin his arms and get his knife away. I&rsquo;ll whistle to startle
  him, and then all three of us spring together, downing him at once in the
  shadow where his friends can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They stowed Suliman in a hollow just over the shoulder of the hill, and
  crawled into position where a foot-track passed between an anthill and a big
  cactus in a shallow, spoon-shaped depression of the hilltop. They had hardly
  hidden themselves when the first man came swinging along at a sort of
  dog-trot, the pace common to most savage and nearly savage people bent on
  adventure. He passed so close that they might have touched him, and the reek
  of cotton clothing soaked in oil was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>Six men passed, all going at the same pace, all smelling strongly of the
  same rancid unguent, with about ten yards between each, dog-trotting to the
  night&rsquo;s work and in no particular concern just yet to conceal
  themselves. The seventh man lagged a little, being heavier than the rest and
  not so free- breathing.</p>

  <p>As he drew abreast of them Jim whistled. But instead of checking his pace
  to look about him the man sprang into the air like a shot buck, and landed in
  his stride intent on sprinting.</p>

  <p>Jim, Catesby and Narayan Singh all sprang at the same instant, and crashed
  their heads together. But for Catesby&rsquo;s Rugby football days they would
  have missed their man; but instinct, born of following the ball though a
  whole pack pounce on him, sent Catesby&rsquo;s right arm shooting out of the
  scrimmage. Groping wildly at the air, he caught the Arab&rsquo;s ankle. It
  was greased, but the check before the Arab freed it tripped him, and before
  he could recover balance all three captors were on top of him, crashing
  together into the cactus bush.</p>

  <p>The Arab could not yell with agony, because Narayan Singh&rsquo;s steely
  wrist clapped on the cotton gag and held it in place, come life come judgment
  day. And the Sikh, being topmost, got fewest of the cactus stabs, so swore
  least. Catesby, underneath, with his arms about the fellow&rsquo;s legs,
  cursed like a wet cat, hissing canteen blasphemy between his teeth; and Jim,
  side by side with the prisoner in a bed of inch-long thorns, kept at his task
  in panting speechlessness that was just as eloquent. There are few points
  that hurt more acutely than those of a Holy Land cactus.</p>

  <p>Jim got the fellow&rsquo;s knife at last, and dropped it in the murderous
  mess of pikes they fought among. But to hold his arms was another matter. The
  Arab was greased from head to foot, and his clothes, which might otherwise
  have served to hold him by were rotten with the oil, tearing whenever they
  were seized. As the clothing came away from him in rags his naked skin
  slipped from the grasp more readily than ever; and he was stronger than a
  bear&mdash;sinewy and lithe and, for all his weight, able to wriggle any
  section of himself that wasn&rsquo;t pegged down tight.</p>

  <p>Three or four times he seemed about to slip away from them, struggling
  like an eel. But Narayan Singh&rsquo;s knee in his stomach combined with the
  unyielding gag to rob him of breath, so that at last they all rolled out into
  the open and Jim gasped out a request to Catesby to take his girdle off and
  bind the fellow&rsquo;s hands and feet.</p>

  <p>Catesby was only in the nick of time at that. Struggling to his knees, he
  was aware of something flashing brightly in the moonlight from behind the
  ruined cactus bush. He sprang into the shadow and caught Suliman&rsquo;s
  kukri in the act of descending on the Arab&rsquo;s undefended neck, whirled
  in both hands like an ax by the eight-year-old. He threw Suliman into the
  cactus to whimper and recover rectitude.</p>

  <p>Then when they had trussed their prisoner and had picked most of the
  thorns out of him they sat and operated on themselves by moonlight, using
  pocket-knives and fingernails and hard words, giving the Arab time to get his
  breath and think up some lies to tell them presently.</p>

  <p>It was no use trying to pretend they themselves were Arabs any longer, for
  they had sworn too lustily in English, to say nothing of Jim&rsquo;s
  instructions anent the girdle, and Narayan Singh&rsquo;s hoarse imprecations
  in another tongue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s as well,&rdquo; laughed Jim. &ldquo;Here,
  Catesby, be a good chap and dig this thorn out from behind my knee.
  He&rsquo;ll be so puzzled that perhaps he&rsquo;ll lie less, if we can get
  him to say anything at all. Where&rsquo;s Suliman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am here. I look for the kukri. It was not the act of a true
  <i>khawaja</i> (gentleman) to throw me in that cactus bush. If you are my
  <i>mutahid</i> (partner), Jimgrim, you will see that I have full
  vengeance!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll avenge you. Wait and see. Let&rsquo;s ask the prisoner
  what he thinks about it. Have you found the kukri?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suliman flourished it in the moonlight. Jim stooped over the prisoner and
  lifted him into a sitting attitude; at sight of the kukri whirling near his
  head he ducked and fell over again sidewise; for his hands were tied under
  his knees and one can&rsquo;t keep balance as well as struggle in that
  position. Jim lifted him again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said in Arabic, &ldquo;this child vows you are an
  <i>iblis</i>; and he has sworn by the beard of the Prophet to kill the first
  <i>iblis</i> that he sees. We are his friends, here to help him do it. What
  do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have caught the wrong one. I am no <i>iblis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You fight like one, and you smell worse than one. What then are
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a thief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man threw such pride into the assertion that Catesby and Narayan Singh
  both laughed. But Jim was too intent on something else. He shifted his own
  position so that the moonlight shore directly in the man&rsquo;s
  face&mdash;then nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at me carefully, Mahommed ben Hamza. Do you know
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimgrim! <i>Ilhamdilla!</i> (Thank God!) Now I am all
  right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not, you scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man without virtue I may be, since Jimgrim says it, who knows so
  much; but not for nothing did I help thee at El-Kerak, when a word from me
  would have ended thy career. I say I am all right.
  <i>Ilhamdilla!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m easy,&rdquo; Jim answered, &ldquo;but I tell
  you my friends here are ruthless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you and I will fight them. I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What brought you from thieving in the Hebron <i>suk</i>
  (market)?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What were you doing yonder?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim pointed to the hill two hundred yards away on which the leper had
  danced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What but obtaining magic against bullet and bayonet? What else
  could a dervish do for me? However, he forgot to bless me for ambushment by
  the way, or even you, Jimgrim, would not have been clever or strong enough to
  take me, with twice as many men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you think his dance is efficacious?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely. All the thieves go to him, and how many get caught? A very
  few get shot, and a very few get stabbed, but those are the ones who scoffed
  at him. He is a driver of hard bargains, but his magic works.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hard bargains, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leper&rsquo;s bargains. A man must leave two-thirds of all he
  steals, or the equivalent at a place appointed, or suffer the curse. None
  dares fail him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I drive still harder bargains,&rdquo; Jim answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, and keep them. Loose my bonds, Jimgrim; thou and I are old
  friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so fast. Are your wife and child at Hebron, Mahommed ben
  Hamza?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unless ill luck overtook them between yesterday and now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you still own the little vineyard&mdash;that profitable little
  vineyard beside the Jerusalem Road?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely. That was my father&rsquo;s legacy to me, his
  firstborn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the stone house in the Haret el-Akkabi (the quarter of the
  makers of goatskin water-bags)&mdash;does that belong to you
  still?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since I have caught you red-handed on your way to steal from Ludd
  Camp, and you have confessed in front of witnesses, do you not see I am in
  position to drive a very hard bargain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between friends?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Between a thief and one who can get that thief fined so heavily
  that there would be no more orchard paying profits on the Jerusalem Road, and
  no more home in the Haret el-Akkabi to bequeath to an only son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would not do that, Jimgrim!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I spoke of a bargain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is that leper to be found by daylight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None knows. None dares inquire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the place appointed for his share of the plunder to be
  left?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is never twice the same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where have you been told to leave two-thirds of what you proposed
  to steal tonight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend the Governor of Hebron keeps a nice, clean jail, it is
  true,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;And my friend Moustapha Aziz the auctioneer
  obtains good prices, too. There might be a little something left to you after
  the fine is paid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimgrim, if I though you were a liar I would take my chance. The
  court would never fine me all that much, for since the Turks left there is a
  law like mother&rsquo;s milk. But you are such a devil that I think you could
  arrange it. I suppose you know of other charges you could lay against me, and
  who shall stand against your persistence? Moreover, you are my
  friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Answer my question then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot describe the place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it near here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then lead us to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimgrim, I am afraid. That dervish who has no name is a capable
  fellow. He can curse!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I, who hold you prisoner, know all about your property. Which
  is the lesser evil&mdash;a curse that might miss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Inshalla!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or my flat promise to get after you in Hebron?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mahommed ben Hamza smiled as winningly as a child with a cause to
  plead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You I know of old, Jimgrim. The dervish is new and talks a lot, but
  his talking did not save me from being caught tonight. Besides, you are my
  friend. I will lead you to the place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Loose his feet, Narayan Singh. Then tie his hands behind his
  back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Jimgrim! Have I questioned your word once, or lied to you
  once? Did I lie to you at El-Kerak, when at a word from me they would have
  thrown you from the castle roof?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim hesitated. He did not want to be hampered by a prisoner on his hands
  that night, yet he would have had to return to camp in order to lock him up.
  But on the other hand he did not want the responsibility of letting him go.
  The best plan seemed to be to make a stipulation with definite limits, which
  the man would probably observe implicitly and then vamoose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just what do you promise?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will lead you to the place where the dervish told us we must
  leave his <i>bakshish</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Swear to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the holy mosque of El-Kalil&mdash;by the tomb of my father, on
  whom be blessings&mdash;by the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will do. Loose him, Narayan Singh&mdash;but keep a close eye
  on him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mashallah!</i> I could not run if I were minded,&rdquo; laughed
  Mahommed ben Hamza, stretching himself. &ldquo;I would rather a camel knelt
  on my belly another time than that fellow of yours who gagged me. This way,
  your honors.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He led them along the ridge toward the spot where the leper
  had danced, so brightly and at such an angle that whoever was abroad could
  hardly have helped seeing them the moment they should desert the scant cover
  of the scrub. Mahommed ben Hamza did not care; his own need of secrecy was at
  an end for that night, and his part of the bargain was to show the way; he
  deliberately chose the open path until Jim called a halt, midway along the
  ridge.</p>

  <p>There he left Catesby and Narayan Singh, bidding Suliman mark the place
  carefully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now down on your belly and crawl!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;And if
  you make a noise or show yourself you shall surely wish I was only a camel;
  I&rsquo;ll land on top of you like a troop of cavalry! You, too,
  Suliman&mdash;crawl!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On hands and knees, picking out the shadows of the cactus and taking their
  chance of snake, centipedes and scorpions, they crept up to the spot where
  the leper had danced, and Jim went aside to examine it, wondering what sort
  of hollow his pirouetting must have scooped out of the sand. But in place of
  a hole was an ancient Moslem tombstone long since fallen flat, and now worn
  smooth in the middle where the man&rsquo;s feet had rubbed it night after
  night.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come away, Jimgrim; the place is bewitched!&rdquo; Mahommed ben
  Hamza whispered.</p>

  <p>But Jim was not satisfied until he had worked his fingers under the stone
  and lifted it to see what might be underneath. For the next three minutes he
  was busy killing about a dozen of the little deadly vipers that infest the
  plains of Palestine, using the kukri snatched from Suliman&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; grumbled Mahommed ben Hamza. &ldquo;Did
  not I say it is bewitched?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After that they crawled downhill, scouting extremely carefully because the
  moon shone on a smooth surface of sand where cactus and shadow were scant. At
  the foot of the long slope was a winding nullah, and there, because of the
  shadow, they dared stand upright. Mahommed ben Hamza led along it to a sandy
  amphitheater a quarter of a mile away, and stopped in front of one of those
  open tombs with which all Palestine abounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, that is the place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Inside or outside?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We were to lay the loot inside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go in and see if the leper is in there now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allah forbid! Besides, Jimgrim, my bargain is finished. I was to
  lead to the place, that is all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Having kept my promise I am now free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee, that was foolish of me! I ordered Narayan Singh to keep an eye
  on you, and then left him behind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So now I go. Good-by, Jimgrim. Don&rsquo;t shoot, for the dervish
  might hear&mdash;and besides you are my friend!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But if I catch you away from Hebron before I visit the
  place,&rdquo; Jim answered, &ldquo;you shall wish I had shot you, do you
  understand? After all, I think&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He drew his automatic and cocked it very deliberately; but Mahommed ben
  Hamza was out of sight among the shadows almost before the spring of the
  pistol clicked.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Aye, father of reprimands, but
  where?&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">CATESBY and Narayan Singh waited interminably, watching the
  moon mount overhead and passing from mere impatient to restlessness to
  anxiety as more than an hour went by without any sign of Jim. Officer and
  enlisted man, Englishman and Sikh, they naturally kept their distance, each
  respecting the other&rsquo;s prejudices; and they lay low for fear of
  scouting desert thieves. Once they heard a shot ring out somewhere in the
  direction of the camp, but that was nothing unusual since thieves had become
  so busy.</p>

  <p>At last Narayan Singh crawled close to Catesby and with an upward jerk of
  his thumb toward the moon began to speak in that low voice which is so hugely
  better than a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Sahib</i>, I have orders to bring our Jimgrim back to Jerusalem
  alive!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you propose, Narayan Singh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My orders to take care of him was from my own colonel,
  <i>sahib</i>. It is good to obey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him ten more minutes. If he doesn&rsquo;t come
  then or send the boy for us we&rsquo;ll try to find him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh spent most of the ten minutes examining his pistol and a
  long, keen knife that he carried under his tunic, arranging both so that he
  could reach them instantly with either hand. But there remained ninety
  interminable seconds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me see your pistol, <i>sahib</i>. I have known these automatics
  to jam. Sand in the fodder kills mules and horses, but I have seen officers
  die more quickly for lack of a man to detect sand in their pistol
  locks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby laughed and handed the weapon over. It is only the raw subaltern
  who is too proud to be nursed by a war-wise enlisted man. Aware that his
  weapon was spotless clean, he was too wise to discourage the Sikh&rsquo;s
  thoughtfulness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now are the ten minutes not up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thirty seconds,&rdquo; said Catesby, glancing at his wristwatch.
  &ldquo;Pistol all right?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little heavy on the pull. Is it a new one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then take care to aim to the left, <i>sahib</i>, if it has to be
  used in a hurry. Now&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, come on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby led, but only for the sake of form. Narayan Singh&rsquo;s low
  voice from just behind did all the counseling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimgrim went first to the place where the <i>shaitan</i> (devil)
  danced. I saw him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The shadows were shorter now, and it was not so easy to keep cover and
  make rapid progress. On the hilltop they abandoned all effort to conceal
  themselves. Catesby stooped to examine the tombstone, and discovered some of
  the snakes that Jim had killed with the kukri. But Narayan Singh had seen
  them first.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beware, <i>sahib</i>! A snake dies slowly; cut in halves they can
  bite yet for an hour or two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He fidgeted until Catesby came away from them.</p>

  <p>Now the moon proved friend as well as enemy, for the Sikh&rsquo;s keen
  eyes picked up the trail Mahommed ben Hamza made in the sand, crossed once in
  a while by those of Jim and Suliman hurrying from bush to bush. But at the
  bottom of the long slope where the footsteps turned into the narrow
  <i>wady</i> they were confused by those of six or seven more men hurrying in
  single file in the same direction. In the one spot where the moonlight shone
  on the bed of the <i>wady</i> Narayan Singh stooped and scooped up a handful
  of earth. It was sticky. He beckoned Catesby into a hollow on one side of the
  track.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strike a match, <i>sahib</i>. Carefully! A match can be seen for
  miles. Thus&mdash;ah&mdash;blood it is, and almost warm&mdash;scarcely begun
  to harden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both examined every inch of the ground for ten or fifteen yards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was no fight in this place. Whoever bled got his punishment
  elsewhere. Perhaps they carried a wounded man&mdash;who can tell in this dim
  light? See&mdash;there is blood again, <i>sahib</i>. Shall we
  follow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was nothing else they could do in the circumstances. It was surely
  contrary to all the rules of warfare, civilized or guerilla, for two men in
  the dark to stalk seven down a narrow, winding <i>wady</i>, around any turn
  of which the seven might wait and pounce on them.</p>

  <p>But Catesby was no whit behind Narayan Singh in eagerness to serve his
  friend; and to turn back was unthinkable, for instance, as to let the Sikh go
  first into danger, even if his were the keenest eyes. There are prerogatives
  that no man willingly relinquishes. Catesby strode forward.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Fifty-four paces down the <i>wady</i>, by his own count, he
  tripped and nearly fell over an Arab corpse.</p>

  <p>For a minute they took cover near the corpse and listened. Then Narayan
  Singh knelt beside it and his long, brown fingers searched swiftly. Someone
  had covered up the face with the headdress and bound the covering fast. He
  tugged it off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God be praised, it is not Jimgrim!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;The
  body is quite warm&mdash;not dead ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His fingers searched inside the clothes and presently found the
  &ldquo;emergency exit&rdquo; through which the man&rsquo;s life had fled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He died by a bayonet, <i>sahib</i>. Come and feel. There is no
  mistaking that wound. Likely a Sikh did it, for the thrust forced the middle
  rib apart and broke the lower one. These were camp-thieves returning from the
  night&rsquo;s work, and one got more than he bargained for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fingers searched again, feeling skillfully for anything of value; but
  the man&rsquo;s friends had taken that precaution first, and even the usual
  amulets and necklace of prayer-beads were missing. However, the father East a
  man is born the more meticulously detailed is his genius for looting (so that
  the Punjaubi and the Jew from Bokhara can thrive where the Arab starves, the
  Chinaman can fatten on what they leave, and the Japanese out-thieves them
  all).</p>

  <p>Presently the Sikh covered the dead man&rsquo;s face again and waited for
  Catesby to lead on, but the Englishman hesitated. Thieves (supposing that
  they were thieves) who took such trouble to cover up a dead man&rsquo;s face
  were hardly likely to leave the body long at the mercy of jackals and
  hyenas.</p>

  <p>There was apparently only one possible way they could take returning. They
  might send two men back for the body, or return in force. He might leave
  Narayan Singh in hiding there to watch, and scout forward alone. Narayan
  Singh could deal alone with two or three men; but six or seven would
  overwhelm him.</p>

  <p>Finally he adopted the inevitable British compromise and, beckoning the
  Sikh to follow him, turned back a little way to avoid making more footprints
  on the sand. At the first place where the bank of the <i>wady</i> sloped
  fairly easily he began to climb it and discovered, as he expected, easy
  enough going at the top.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Narayan Singh, we&rsquo;ll scout along together as far as the
  last point from which we can overlook the <i>wady</i>. There I&rsquo;ll leave
  you and carry on. If I need you I&rsquo;ll fire my pistol. If you need me, do
  the same.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to see down into the <i>wady</i>, but if
  anybody comes along it you can hear; in that case scout closer. Shoot to kill
  if you want to, but mind you don&rsquo;t shoot Jimgrim <i>sahib</i> by
  mistake!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sikh&rsquo;s disgust and disappointment were as plain as if he had
  dared voice them. A hound would have submitted as cheerfully. He approved
  neither of dividing forces nor of squandering his own trained senses on any
  passive form of usefulness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forward, <i>sahib!</i>&rdquo; he urged; and the tone of his voice
  bordered on insolence. &ldquo;Shall Jimgrim and the <i>butcha</i> need us and
  we play vulture above a carcass?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby laughed dryly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do as I say,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

  <p>They were able to go quite a long way without losing sight of the black,
  velvet-looking belt of gloom that was the <i>wady</i> bottom, and
  Catesby&rsquo;s plan proved not so contemptible after all. Keeping a company
  of Sikhs in fighting trim for months past had given him a knowledge of all
  that countryside that could not desert him in the dark, and presently they
  reached a low eminence from which they could look down into the <i>wady</i>
  in either direction.</p>

  <p>By that time, too, the moon shone at such an angle that the darkness below
  them was considerably broken up and patches of sand were beginning to be
  visible in places. To their left, clearly outlined in the yellow light, lay a
  sandy amphitheater, and if they had only known it they could see the opening
  of the tomb to which the Arab had led Jim and Suliman.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless they seemed to have missed their opportunity, and Narayan
  Singh suddenly swore a streak of Indian oaths that would have made a mere
  comminating prelate shudder with mixed envy and dread. Down below them,
  passing in single file across a yellow sand-patch to their right, they caught
  sight of men&rsquo;s figures moving swiftly. Catesby counted five, the Sikh
  six, but there might have been more because of the shadows, and some might
  have crossed the patch of light before they saw the others. They were all
  swallowed in black night again before the brain could get any clear
  impression of their general appearance.</p>

  <p>Catesby made up his mind swiftly enough then, and Narayan Singh approved,
  since decision entailed action.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on! After them from the rear!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They slid down the sandbank into the <i>wady</i> and started to run,
  keeping in the middle where the track was loose and soft, so as to make less
  noise. Neither man knew exactly what they meant to do other than force the
  party ahead to stand and give an account of themselves. If that should entail
  a free fight, well and good; the Sikh, at least, would sooner fight than not,
  and Catesby had no objection.</p>

  <p>But the one paramount, essential objective was to get tidings of Jim Grim,
  and neither of them made a single stipulation as to ways of means. They
  simply ran.</p>

  <p>Whether or not they were gaining on their quarry they never knew; for
  suddenly, down the sandbank just abreast of them, panting, staggering,
  tripping, tottering, tumbling into their arms to sob and cling to
  them&mdash;Suliman came like a bolt out of the night&mdash;too scared and
  breathless to explain himself, kicking and punching at Narayan Singh because
  he should comprehend without words&mdash;too bewildered to speak English to
  Catesby, who had scant Arabic.</p>

  <p>Catesby was not much of a hand with children. He tried sternness to
  antidote hysteria, and succeeded only in making his victim cry. So Narayan
  Singh squatted in the <i>wady</i> as if time were no consideration, and took
  the boy in his lap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A brave fellow!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Truly a brave fellow! Out in
  the night alone and not afraid of leopards! A soldier in the making! A swift
  runner! A man of deeds, not words! A scout who knows friends in the dark and
  can find them! A skirmisher who takes a cliff-side like a warhorse galloping!
  Truly a proper friend for such a one as Jimgrim! And what said Jimgrim? I
  wager had had a message for Narayan Singh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curse you religion! Curse your mother and her family! What are you
  waiting for? Let me go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The youngster struggled, and struck the Sikh&rsquo;s face with his fists,
  but stirred no reprisals. Narayan Singh held on an laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aha! A ruffian! A fighting man! A very Rustum (a famous warrior) at
  the age of eight. I wager Jimgrim sent him out to fight the
  <i>iblis!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The word <i>iblis</i> loosened the floods of speech at last. Suliman spat
  into the Sikh&rsquo;s black beard and followed up the illustration with his
  text.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come and get him! Come quick! The <i>iblis</i> sits and spits at
  him! Jimgrim is bewitched. The <i>iblis</i> curses him. Jimgrim&rsquo;s
  pistol is bewitched; he can&rsquo;t use it. The <i>iblis</i> laughs. I ran to
  find you and you were gone, so I came back to kill the <i>iblis</i> with my
  kukri. Now you sit and grin, you son of sixty dogs, while the iblis murders
  Jimgrim. Have you no heart? Have you no courage? Jimgrim is in
  danger!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, father of reprimands! But where?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where? In the cave, of course! In the cave, idiot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which cave, O father of whirlwinds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which cave, Narayan Singh? As if there were more than one! Can
  Jimgrim be in two caves?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you lead us to the cave?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! I have lost my way!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That admission was altogether too much for Catesby, who was listening in
  shadow. He stepped closer to try again what stern authority might do. But
  Narayan Singh waved him back with an imploring gesture, and resumed the
  milder method.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such a scout! Such a father of long memories! I wager he has not
  forgotten what I taught him in Jerusalem. You were in the cave, Suliman? And
  you came out of the cave? Then on which side shone the moon&mdash;on this or
  that hand? This hand I wager. No? That one? Ah! And you crossed this
  <i>wady</i> to reach the place where I waited with the <i>sahib</i>? Ah! Then
  the cave is this way. Come!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He got up, took the child by the hand and led him along the <i>wady</i> in
  the opposite direction to that in which they had been running, Catesby
  following in agonies of impatience. At every projection Narayan Singh would
  stop and try to get the boy to recognize it, but it was not until they
  reached the open amphitheater that Suliman gave a gasp of sheer excitement
  and began to run.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There! There is the cave! I see it! Hurry, Narayan Singh! Curse you
  for a crawling beetle! Pick me up and carry me, I am
  <i>halas</i>&mdash;finish!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh gathered him up in his hairy arms, gentle as a
  woman&rsquo;s, but as strong as two pythons, and broke into a double. The
  moonlight shone straight into the cave mouth, and Catesby, having no load,
  reached it first. By the time Narayan Singh overtook him and had set down
  Suliman, Catesby was disappearing head first into a black hole, sending his
  voice ahead of him:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Grim! Hullo! Jim Grim! Hullo, Uncle Sam, are you there? The
  reserves are coming, Grim&mdash;hold on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suliman was next into the hole, charging under the Sikh&rsquo;s legs and
  pulling out his kukri as he scrambled, yelling too:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh Jimgrim! <i>Taib</i> (all right) Jimgrim! All right, Jimgrim!
  Coming! We are here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They plunged forward into utter darkness; and because Suliman was to busy
  shouting to think of warning them about the tricks of the place they all
  three took a header down a four-foot drop into the echoing home of
  blackness.</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh proved heavy, for it is bone and thew that weigh, not fat.
  It took Catesby two minutes to recover breath, and then at last he struck a
  match. He held it high over his head, and the light showed all four walls of
  a cavern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Grim! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cavern, with a row of sepulchers hewn into the walls, was empty. The
  echoes mocked them. Catesby struck match after match, and they peered
  together into every niche and cranny, finding nothing but a dollop of candle-
  grease to prove that anyone had ever been in there.</p>

  <p>Catesby burned his fingers with his last match, and the blackness of the
  womb of darkness shut them in again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late? Surely not too late?&rdquo; muttered Narayan Singh.</p>

  <p>Then Suliman lifted up his voice and yelled:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is gone! Oh, Jimgrim! Prince of men! That <i>iblis</i> has eaten
  him! Curse the <i>iblis</i>! Curse his religion and his mother and his eyes
  and his belly and his teeth! In the name of Allah, may his soul be flung into
  the fire that burns. May devils torture him forever. Oh, my Jimgrim!
  Oh-oh&mdash;ai-ee- ee!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He flung himself face down and beat the floor of the cavern with his
  fists, sobbing his heart out for his vanished hero.</p>

  <p>There are plenty of instances. Napoleon obsessed with the thought of
  lifting France out of the ruck of misery and restoring his country to her
  right place in the sun was invincible. Napoleon on a throne, scheming to make
  himself an ancestor of kings, was only dangerous. And Brigadier-General
  Jenkins was an immeasurable way behind Napoleon, without ever having
  possessed high ideals of any kind, although he could talk about them in a
  florid way that deceived some folk.</p>

  <p>At about the time when Jim left camp on the trail of the <i>iblis</i>
  Jenkins was burning overtime oil in the wooden shack that did duty for
  office, with a corner of one window left uncovered in order that the world
  might appreciate his devotion to duty.</p>

  <p>But he had given up sitting at the desk and rummaging through papers.
  Papers were the bane of his existence. Covering it under an air of lordly
  military scorn for trifles, he had been afflicted all his life with
  carelessness at odd moments, such as would account, for instance, for the
  R.T.O.&rsquo;s confidence in washing his hands of the stolen TNT. Jenkins had
  received a memorandum about that explosive and mislaid it; now he had lost
  another paper, and this time there was no one else on whom he dared lay
  blame.</p>

  <p>If it had been an official document he could certainly have pounced his
  clerk, but unfortunately it was something about which it was to be hoped the
  clerk knew nothing. If the clerk did know, then the sooner that unfortunate
  should leave for far-off parts the better. The worst of it was that he was
  expecting a visit that evening from the man who had signed the paper, and he
  had reasons for needing it to flourish under that individual&rsquo;s
  nose.</p>

  <p>He paced up and down the narrow office, casting huge shadows that made his
  mustache seem like a tea-pot handle and annoyed him, for he was vain of
  personal appearance as of everything else. Every now and then he paused to
  rap his forehead with a clenched fist, as if to shake into action that
  magnificent memory of which he boasted. Then the pacing was resumed, while
  his lower lip sucked at the corner of the red mustache to present the
  offending shadow.</p>

  <p>One incident kept recurring to mind that he hoped explained the loss away,
  but he would have given a month&rsquo;s pay to be sure of it. He remembered a
  soiled, creased, dog-eared hundred-piaster note that had come in halves and
  had to be stuck together. He had sat at his desk&mdash;he remembered that
  distinctly&mdash;clipped a strip of paper with the shears, gummed the strip
  and joined the two halves of the note.</p>

  <p>In all likelihood he had crumpled up the remainder of the piece of paper
  and thrown it into the box that did duty for waste-basket, but of that he
  could not be certain. It was possible that was the missing document. And he
  could not for the life of him remember to whom or for what purpose he had
  paid out the banknote, repaired with a strip of paper that might have Arabic
  handwriting on it.</p>

  <p>He might have paid a mess-bill with it, or settled a bridge
  account&mdash;although he very rarely lost at cards&mdash;in which case the
  note was probably long ago in circulation far enough away to be out of
  danger. That was to be hoped, but hope is often a fidgety weakling.</p>

  <p>An incident nagged his memory. He had paid one hundred piasters on a
  recent occasion to the man who was coming to see him tonight&mdash;the very
  man under whose nose he wanted to brandish the lost signature.</p>

  <p>As he turned for another worried beat up and down the room a Sikh sentry
  rapped on the door to announce his visitor. He went behind the desk and
  studied his appearance in the little canteen store looking-glass for a minute
  before answering, twisting his mustache straight and practicing a couple of
  grimaces. He believed as thoroughly in advertisement as any manufacturer of
  patent pills, and never overlooked the cover of the capsule.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">For an Arab the visitor seemed overconfident. He was a
  little man, dressed in expensive European clothes, but with a <i>tarboosh</i>
  at least a size too small for him so that it sat jauntily on a head that grew
  very suddenly narrow above the ears; and like many little men he walked
  mincingly, suggesting an insect&mdash;but an insect with a sting, for his
  smile did not succeed in hiding malice. He was the sort of man one would
  instinctively keep at a distance. But his voice was like oil on troubled
  waters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have nothing but good news for your honor,&rdquo; he began,
  smiling jubilantly. &ldquo;I confess myself more than ever amazed at your
  genius that suggested this plan to organize Arab thieves and blame their
  thefts on the Zionists. It works! Never was such a
  thieving&mdash;tee-hee-hee! And a fair proportion of the plunder is already
  stowed in a place owned by the Zionist Committee&mdash;hee-hee!&mdash;such a
  joke!&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it exquisite?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down! And listen to me, Charkas. How many times have I to tell
  you that I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with your plans? I won&rsquo;t have you as
  much as suggest it, even in private. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ibrahim Charkas folded one hand on the other, chose the edge of an
  uncomfortable chair and sat down facing him. The corners of his mouth looked
  meek, and his eyes immensely mischievous.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to help you Arabs, <i>sub</i> <i>rosa</i>, so to
  speak. And I&rsquo;m willing that it should be known in the right quarter at
  the right time that I have been your friend all along. But nothing
  indiscreet&mdash;you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly. Yes, indeed. And when the time comes you may rest
  assured we shall show ourselves most grateful&mdash;practically
  grateful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Um-m-m! By the way Charkas, do you remember a hundred-piaster note
  I gave you the other day for expenses? There was a hundred, and I think four
  fifties and ten tens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. You have been most generous. I was wondering tonight
  whether I might not ask&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you happen to have that hundred by you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a hundred piasters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean the original bank-note that I gave you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suspect it&rsquo;s a bad one. I&rsquo;d like to give you another
  for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tee-hee-hee! You need not worry, general. It has been passed on
  long ago. Whoever has it now may do the worrying. Hee-hee! But I would like
  some more money for expenses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn it! D&rsquo;you take me for a millionaire?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. Indeed I know better. But these agitators all need wages,
  and if we are to work up a proper feeling against the Zionists there must be
  plenty of paid men at work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you Arabs any guts, that you can&rsquo;t raise a
  campaign fund among you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h! We are mostly poor, and those who are not are inclined to
  keep out of trouble. My own little business in the <i>suk</i> (bazaar) is not
  profitable nowadays, because the soldiers buy all they require in the canteen
  at prices I cannot meet. Now if I had a few hundred piasters
  tonight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, Charkas; I&rsquo;ve no cash by me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But a check, general? A check made out to bearer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you take me for? How many times must I repeat that my name
  doesn&rsquo;t appear in connection with this business? Besides, I&rsquo;m
  getting sick of it. It&rsquo;s time to bring things to a head. Major Grim has
  been sent down from Jerusalem to inquire into the thieving, and he&rsquo;s
  one of those persistent men who generally get what they&rsquo;re after. The
  way to make the most of that is to let him discover the loot as soon as
  possible in the hands of Zionists, and then advertise it here, in Egypt, and
  in England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tee-hee-hee! Exquisite! As I said, a fair proportion of the loot is
  already&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know where it is. Don&rsquo;t tell me. News
  reached me by mail this morning that the feeling at the Foreign Office is
  turning strongly against the Zionists at present. The fools have been
  demanding too much, with the result that pro-Arab sentiment is gaining
  ground. Much the same story comes from Egypt. Anything just now that puts the
  Zionists in a more unfavorable light would be opportune. You may depend on
  it, Major Grim will run that loot to ground in short order, so you&rsquo;d
  better cover up your own tracks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my tracks are very well covered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a suggestion of insolence underlying the certainty in the
  Arab&rsquo;s voice that made Jenkins turn suddenly and face him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are powerful. I look to you for protection in case of
  necessity. Otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here! Are you fooling yourself by any chance? Do you suppose
  I&rsquo;d budge one inch to protect you? You people have no sense of
  proportion. To help the Arab cause&mdash;<i>sub rosa</i> as I said&mdash;is
  one thing; to ruin my whole career by becoming involved in your intrigues is
  another, and doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me at all. I&rsquo;d let you hang rather
  than lift a finger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He glared at Charkas with dark eyes that had cowed many a subordinate and
  rescued him in many an awkward moment. He had made a deliberate study of that
  frown and the attitude that went with it, growing expert in their use but
  rather overestimating their value on the strength of occasional
  successes.</p>

  <p>The Arab flinched like an animal under the lash. Jenkins turned his back
  on him. It was more from habit than intention that he strode behind the desk
  and faced the looking-glass.</p>

  <p>Ibrahim Charkas was less cowed that he chose to seem, being one of those
  men who can keep their wits alert under a protecting mask of physical fear.
  The moment Jenkins&rsquo; back was turned he leaned toward the desk and began
  searching the papers that lay scattered all over it in the confusion made by
  Jenkins himself half an hour previously. His fingers were as swift and supple
  as a card-shaper&rsquo;s, and his eyes, glancing every second at
  Jenkins&rsquo; back, as wary as a rat&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>In less than thirty seconds he had spotted a railway notice of
  consignments due to arrive. Watching his chance, he flipped it toward the
  corner of the desk. A second more and he had it in his pocket. Then Jenkins
  turned on him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give that back!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give what back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to argue. I watched you in the glass. Give it here.
  It&rsquo;s in that pocket. Out with it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With his head sunk between his shoulders, feet apart, ready to jump for
  his life, and his eyes looking like black shoe-buttons, the Arab laid the
  paper on the desk. Jenkins glanced at it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So-ho! So that&rsquo;s the way of it! Done it before half a dozen
  times no doubt! That&rsquo;s how they knew about the TNT, eh? You stole the
  memorandum off my desk. I remember now, you were in here that morning. What
  else have you taken?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing else, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean on other occasions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. I am no thief. I did not take any memorandum. As for this,
  it was unintentional&mdash;mere nervousness&mdash;I did it without
  thinking&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, piffle! Sit where you are. Now&mdash;look up at me.
  You&rsquo;ve been in here to my knowledge twice since the morning that TNT
  memorandum came.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the second occasion you followed up a letter you had written me.
  You said you had information too important to be put in writing. But you put
  a lot in that letter, didn&rsquo;t you? It was pretty compromising,
  wasn&rsquo;t it? And the additional information turned out to be so
  insignificant that I wondered why you bothered to come.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know now. I was looking for that letter tonight, and it&rsquo;s
  missing. It lay in this top drawer. You stole it back&mdash;now didn&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins fairly yelled the last words at him and Charkas nearly shrank out
  of his skin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not! On my honor, I swear I did not!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins reached for a whalebone riding-whip that hung from a nail on the
  wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Admit it, you&mdash;, or I&rsquo;ll thrash the life out of
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To Jenkins&rsquo; surprise, instead of capitulating and confessing the
  Arab grew suddenly calm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should I confess to what I did not do?&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;It is you who should be ashamed not I. If you have lost that letter
  you have betrayed me faithlessly, because anyone who finds it can make use of
  it to ruin me. If that is so, I hope it will ruin you too.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was addressed to you. Your name was on it. If I am arrested I
  shall denounce you. You would better let me get away from here. Give me some
  money and I will go to Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins laughed. But he returned the whip to its nail on the wall,
  recovering his temper with an effort.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know what happened to the letter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I tore
  it up the other day. I was testing you. Seeing you take that paper just now
  in your&mdash;ah&mdash;fit of nervousness, I naturally jumped to conclusions
  and suspected you of other thefts. That&rsquo;s an old trick, you know, to
  startle a man into confessing something he did do by accusing him of doing
  something you know he didn&rsquo;t. You stood the test, Charkas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go now, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s inviting
  suspicion to be found talking with you in here so late at night. Don&rsquo;t
  forget&mdash;Major Grim is already on the job; so cover up your tracks, and
  be ready to accuse the Zionists. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You gave me a severe shock to my nervous system, but&mdash;good
  night, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins whistled the sentry and gave him orders to escort the Arab to the
  gate. Then he blew out the lamp, locked the door, and went to his own tent,
  where he sat for a few minutes humming to himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So he stole that TNT memorandum, did he? I wonder if he took that
  letter too, or whether I destroyed it by accident. Um-m-m! So he thinks he
  can ruin me, does he? He&rsquo;s a mean little rat, and he might make
  trouble.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pity I accused Catesby, but that can&rsquo;t be helped now. I shall
  have to get Charkas on some other count&mdash;he&rsquo;s best out of the way.
  Um-m-m! Hullo, what&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A rifle shot spat out through the darkness near at hand, and was followed
  by a deal of shouting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thieves again!&rdquo; yelled a subaltern&rsquo;s voice, and there
  was a rush of officers from the mess marquee to lend a hand in the hunt.</p>

  <p>Jenkins buttoned up his tunic, buckled on his belt, and hurried after them
  to add to his laurels by being officious even if he reached the scene too
  late.</p>

  <p>Those night raids take place swiftly, and when discovered the thieves
  don&rsquo;t wait to be surrounded. He arrived in time to receive the report
  from three subalterns, all speaking together breathlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two of our Sikhs wounded, sir, but one of them swears he got home
  with his bayonet first. There&rsquo;s blood on the bayonet to prove it. The
  thieves got away with their dead man, and three rifles and some other stuff
  that they&rsquo;d snaffled before they were seen. That&rsquo;s all,
  sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite enough, too,&rdquo; snapped Jenkins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
  disgraceful business. I shall have an inquiry at once, and fix the blame.
  Perfectly disgraceful!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He himself passed on the report to General Anthony, who came hurrying up a
  moment later, followed by his aide.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been giving these rifle raids a lot of thought and close
  attention,&rdquo; he added in conclusion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief that
  when the facts are out you&rsquo;ll find Zionists are at the bottom of it
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anthony looked hard at him in the light of a sentry&rsquo;s lantern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anyone who could prove that would be entitled to great
  credit,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Have you seen that the wounded Sikhs
  have attention? No, never mind; I&rsquo;ll go myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;I can deal with twenty-five as easily as
  one!&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was Jim&rsquo;s intention, once he had found the
  leper&rsquo;s rendezvous and got rid of the rather embarrassing company of
  Mahommed ben Hamza, to return for Catesby and Narayan Singh, or perhaps to
  send Suliman for them if the boy could be induced to go alone.</p>

  <p>But there was something about the dark, open mouth of that tomb that fixed
  his attention for the moment. It did not differ particularly from a thousand
  others dotted here and there within a radius of a few miles; there was a sort
  of porch, perhaps a dozen feet deep, roughly hewn out of the hillside without
  any significant figures; and down in a corner of that was a dark hole of not
  more than half a man&rsquo;s height, leading no doubt into a natural cave
  beyond.</p>

  <p>But while he looked, wondering what attracted him, a distinct sound
  emerged from the hole. Noises in the night, propelled from a cave by the
  echoing walls, are not easy to recognize; but if it sounded like anything
  familiar it was a human hiccough.</p>

  <p>Any of a number of creatures might have made the noise; owls, jackals,
  hyenas, badgers, rats&mdash;for those old tombs, once robbers have plundered
  them, make the handiest imaginable dens for wild beasts, provided their
  opening stands above the waterline, as this one did.</p>

  <p>They business of being a hunter, whether of animals or men, produced two
  salient characteristics; a tendency to form opinion in advance as to what the
  hunted will most likely do, and an equally alert ability to throw preformed
  opinion to the winds at the first hint.</p>

  <p>Jim had made up his mind that the leper would hardly risk waiting at the
  rendezvous, and for several reasons. In the first place the cave was almost
  certainly a trap, with only one opening. Whoever waited inside it could form
  no notion of what was passing outside, and would be at the mercy of superior
  numbers; men who had risked their lives to steal rifles might likely balk at
  surrendering the booty to one lone individual within the narrow compass of a
  grave.</p>

  <p>To be morally afraid of a dervish dancing like a devil on a hill was one
  thing; to fear him at all when face to face within four walls would be
  another. A man with the knowledge of Arab human nature that the leper had
  displayed would appreciate that certainty.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, to wait at a little distance, watch for returning
  plunderers, perhaps even warn them sternly from an overlooking point of
  vantage, and come down to collect the booty after they had placed it in the
  cave and after making sure that the coast was clear, would be safe,
  circumspect and sane&mdash;cynical, in fact, in keeping with the cynicism
  that made use of the leprosy and religious emotion for unlawful ends.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s first idea consequently was to wait at a point of vantage,
  too, and descend on the leper in turn and catch him red-handed whenever he
  should descend to possess the loot.</p>

  <p>But there is no accounting for the recklessness of criminals, or the
  arrogance of men who think that fear gives them a hold over their
  accomplices. Cunning though he is, and careful though he is in a thousand
  ways, the charlatan who practices on superstition is once in a while more
  incautious than a sheep-fed wolf; like the wolf he takes outrageous chances
  after use has made the game seem simple.</p>

  <p>Jim sat down in front of the tomb and listened, while Suliman clung to him
  in the hysteria of small-boy terror of bogies. For a long time the only
  movement was Suliman&rsquo;s trembling, and the only sound the footfall of
  some small night animal borne on an almost imperceptible breeze. But then the
  cough, or sneeze, or belch, or whatever it was, was repeated and Suliman hid
  his face in Jim&rsquo;s <i>abyi</i> (long-sleeved Arab cloak), shuddering as
  if he hoped to crawl out of his skin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;we decide whether or not you wear
  girl&rsquo;s clothes for a year. I&rsquo;m going in there. Are you coming
  too?&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was an awful test of courage for a child of eight, with a
  shameful alternative. But Jim, whose own youth had been one long adventure
  with hardship and disadvantage, in which the only penalty he had learned to
  loathe was self- contempt, was not friend of compromise. Shameful
  alternatives were things he faced and turned his back on in New England at
  such an early age that decision had become a habit; and what a man has done
  repeatedly himself he finds it hard to believe another cannot do. Suliman
  knew perfectly well from grim experience that Jim would be as good as his
  word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a man, not a woman. I will not wear girl&rsquo;s garments.
  Must I go in first?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll lead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lead on then, Jimgrim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good for you, youngster.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Jim was minded to test him to the utmost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seeing you&rsquo;re willing, you may stay outside if you
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I am a man. Lead on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. But listen; not a word to me in English. Hold your
  tongue&mdash;listen with all your might&mdash;and try to take your cue from
  me. Now are you ready?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim produced a pocket electric torch and, stooping beside the black hole,
  flashed the light across the opening. Little by little, as nothing happened,
  he directed the light down into the hole, keeping himself out of the path of
  possible bullets. But it was a long passage and not straight, high enough
  inside for a man to stand without stooping and wide enough to carry in a body
  on a bier, but turning so abruptly after fifteen or twenty feet that there
  was nothing to be gained by peering in.</p>

  <p>The fact that the flashlight had not scared out any animal was possibly
  presumptive proof that a man was in there who had scared the usual denizens
  to flight already; but in that case all that he had certainly done so far was
  to give the man notice of his coming.</p>

  <p>So he crouched into the opening and stepped down and forward without
  further preliminary, flashing the light again and trusting to its glare to
  spoil the aim of any man or beast disposed to murder. Suliman, forgetting the
  solace of the kukri, clung to the skirts of his <i>abyi</i> and followed
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He took the turn in a hurry, for there is nothing to be gained by giving
  your enemy time to think until you have the weather gage of him so surely
  that thinking may induce him to surrender. But again nothing happened, and
  Suliman&rsquo;s teeth were chattering so loudly that Jim could not be sure
  whether or not he heard something moving in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Immediately beyond the turn the passage sloped steeply into a natural
  cave, with a sheer drop at the end of three or four feet to the cave floor.
  Somebody might easily be crouching there, so he switched the light off
  suddenly and took the last lap with a run and a jump, leaving Suliman at the
  corner, scared out of his wits but grimly silent. The instant his feet
  touched the floor he faced about and turned on the light again, rather
  expecting to see the leper rise from beneath the opening and start to
  scramble away. But again nothing happened, except that Suliman took hold of
  courage with clenched teeth and came charging down after him, blinded by the
  torchlight in his eyes and pitching into the cave head foremost, unhurt by a
  miracle.</p>

  <p>The tomb proved to be low, but long and wide&mdash;thirty feet at least
  each way, with a smooth floor showing traces of the chisel, although the roof
  was in its natural state. A swift examination of the walls by the torchlight
  showed deep recesses cut into the sides about four feet above the floor, each
  one doubtless in its day a separate sepulcher. Jim started to examine them
  one by one, commencing from the nearest to the entrance, and got no farther.
  His man was there&mdash;alive, alert, apparently amused.</p>

  <p>Squatting in the mouth of a hole that once held human bones, like an
  Indian idol, except that most of the Indian gods lack humor, the leper smiled
  and said nothing, resting his chin in the hollow of one hand and his elbow on
  one knee, blinking at the light.</p>

  <p>He looked abominably leprous. Whole patches of his skin from face to heels
  were glistening white and scaly. Yet his muscles seemed as firm as a
  horse&rsquo;s and as magnificently molded underneath the skin, while the
  expression on his face was not that of a man grown used to gnawing agony or
  the leprous local anesthesia. His eyes shown healthy in the torchlight, and
  except for the disgusting state of parts of his skin he looked more like an
  athlete in condition than a sick man.</p>

  <p>For two minutes no one spoke. Then the leper reached behind him with his
  left hand, and Jim covered him instantly with his pistol.</p>

  <p>But all that the groping hand brought forth was a candle-end and a match.
  The <i>iblis</i> set the candle-end on a ledge in the broken wall of the
  recess and lit it, never moving the rest of his body or shifting the position
  of his chin. So Jim put out the torch, to save the meager battery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shoot him, Jimgrim,&rdquo; Suliman whispered unable to bear the
  tension any longer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Sa&rsquo;id, ya Jimgrim!</i>&rdquo; boomed the <i>iblis</i>.</p>

  <p>Having snatched Jim&rsquo;s name out of the silence as it were, he saw fit
  to speak. Moreover, having apparently only his sharp wits for a weapon, he
  proposed to take the upper hand by assuming the role of questioner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What manner of name is Jimgrim? What sort of Arab prowls by night
  with such a name for the <i>diba</i> (hyenas) to laugh at?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man&rsquo;s voice was pleasant, though his consonants were hard and
  vowels coarse. Being an Egyptian his opinion on the subject of Arab names was
  certain to be at fault as well as unimportant. The Arabs themselves gave
  Jimgrim his name. Jim answered instantly, mocking him in turn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do the lepers of Egypt <i>all</i> smear on the sickness form a
  paint- pot?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> blinked steadily, still smiling, but saw fir not to
  answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And smear so clumsily that the pain peels off at the edges here and
  there?&rdquo; Jim asked again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of cursed mother of impudence brought thee forth?&rdquo;
  asked the <i>iblis</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One whose son can smell an Egyptian from half a mile away, and
  knows the look of paint, O father of unimportant questions,&rdquo; Jim
  replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come close. Touch me then, and count how many days until you too
  have leprosy!&rdquo; sneered the <i>iblis</i>.</p>

  <p>Suliman clutched at Jim to hold back, but Jim was no fledgling to take a
  dare and step within reach of those bronze arms. The man&rsquo;s fingers
  looked strong enough to pull out an opponent&rsquo;s muscles as an ape pulls
  off a chicken&rsquo;s head, and the candlelight was in his favor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shoot him, Jimgrim; shoot him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suliman, with no affairs of state to complicate the issue, could imagine
  only that one remedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you afraid to? Give me the pistol. I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> answered that by putting out his tongue between his
  teeth, screwing his face into a hideous likeness of the prince of darkness,
  and hissing like an angry cat. Suliman screamed and jumped back against the
  far wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shoot, Jimgrim! If he spits and it hits you, you will
  die!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> took the hint and spat, wide of the mark on purpose, as a
  warship fires an &ldquo;angry blank&rdquo; across another&rsquo;s bows. Past
  master of bluff and opportunity; he was too wise to spit straight and prove
  his ammunition harmless. It obviously disconcerted him that Jim stood
  still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing more than I can have,&rdquo; Jim answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; sneered the <i>iblis</i>. &ldquo;He who wants no more
  than that is like the rat that craves a bellyful. Get out of here. <i>Ruh min
  hene!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not until I have what I can have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Partnership.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thou&mdash;dog of an Arab&mdash;son of a mother of
  abominations&mdash;spat-upon offspring of sixty dogs&mdash;fuel for the fire
  of Eblis&mdash;partnership with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, with you, father of impotent curses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> laughed again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;No bullet can harm me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And whether the man really believed that or not Jim was at a loss to know.
  A deal of fanatical self-confidence goes to the attainment of such dancing
  and deviltry as his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The bark of the pistol will bring my friends in any case,&rdquo;
  said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The bark of a jackal summons the pack to eat carrion,&rdquo; the
  <i>iblis</i> answered; &ldquo;but one roar of a lion sends them
  scurrying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim pointed the pistol straight at him, and met his eyes along the blued
  steel barrel. The <i>iblis</i> did not flinch, and Jim felt in rather a
  predicament. He, too, was bluffing, for he had not the slightest intention of
  killing the man&mdash;even in self-defense if he could help it.</p>

  <p>Dead the rascal would be useless. Alive there was the possibility of
  making him uncover all the ramifications of his plans. If Jim managed to call
  Catesby and Narayan Singh they could easily capture the man between the three
  of them. By gagging him and waiting near the cave they might even secure a
  few of the thieves when they came to deliver loot.</p>

  <p>But Jim knew better than to suppose that this imitation leper was without
  influential backing, and he wanted the &ldquo;men higher up.&rdquo; One or
  two words that Jenkins dropped had convinced him that the brigadier was
  making use of the most tempting of all tools to the unscrupulous ambitious
  man&mdash;the criminal network of the underworld, and he did not propose to
  play into Jenkins&rsquo; hands by destroying the evidence too soon.</p>

  <p>He suspected that nothing would suit the brigadier&rsquo;s purpose better
  at the moment than to have this particular tool safely under lock and key.
  The <i>iblis</i> had served his purpose by producing a condition, out of
  which Jenkins proposed to get credit by destroying it and then attributing
  the blame to his superiors, adopting the U.S. brand of cheap city politics
  transported to another sphere, without quite all the subtlety or half the
  brains.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better shoot soon,&rdquo; grinned the <i>iblis</i>, probably
  mistaking Jim&rsquo;s deliberation for superstitious funk.</p>

  <p>Jim lowered the pistol. He decided to summon his two friends by other
  means.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suliman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come here a minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Suliman had had enough of it and had vanished, creeping like a ghost
  among the shadows. A moment later he heard the boy scramble out of the
  passage into the entrance and take to his heels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The child is wiser than the man,&rdquo; the <i>iblis</i> grinned
  maliciously.</p>

  <p>Jim went to the entrance and leaned with his back against the opening,
  cutting off the one way of retreat and hoping that the <i>iblis</i> might not
  force the issue by attacking him. For he was fully resolved not to shoot if
  that could be avoided by any means; and strong though he knew himself to be
  he suspected that the <i>iblis</i> had twice his strength.</p>

  <p>More depended on Suliman in the next few minutes than he cared to dwell
  on, and he went through the alternating cold chills and hot sweat that always
  attacked him when success or failure depended for the moment on someone else.
  It was Jim&rsquo;s besetting weakness that he could not rest easily unless
  the key to a given crisis were in his own hand, and he suffered more in such
  minutes than a victim on the rack.</p>

  <p>There were so many possibilities. Suliman might even be killed by a
  leopard. A hyena might overcome natural cowardice sufficiently to attack a
  boy of that size. Or he might lose his way.</p>

  <p>Catesby and Narayan Singh might have grown impatient and have tried to
  follow, in which case Suliman might fail to find them. Perhaps they were
  already scouting in the wrong direction. Or lurking thieves might make away
  with the boy. If the camp-thieves should return and catch him alone with the
  <i>iblis</i> he would be in a fine predicament.</p>

  <p>And all the while the <i>iblis</i> sat quite still, blinking beside the
  candle in what, if not amusement, was a most astounding bluff at it.
  Insolently naked, impudently confident, he seemed aware of hidden resources
  of which Jim knew nothing.</p>

  <p>He was certainly an unusual malefactor. Nine criminals out of ten caught
  in a corner and held at pistol-point would have at least pretended to
  consider that partnership proposal, if only with a view to subsequent
  treachery. In fact, all that redeemed the proposal itself from treachery was
  certainty that the <i>iblis</i> would never dream of playing fair. Jim might
  have gained an insight into the inner workings of the scheme while the other
  sought to gain time, that was all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When your friends come they will be as impotent as you are,&rdquo;
  said the <i>iblis</i> after a few minutes.</p>

  <p>His tone of voice was that of an agent of the Inquisition discussing the
  next item on the program for a victim&rsquo;s benefit.</p>

  <p>It was tempting to answer threat with threat, but that is a poor game.
  Threats are always launched either to unmask the other&rsquo;s batteries or
  else to undermine self-command and blind an opponent to his wisest course.
  There is not exception to that rule, even though threateners don&rsquo;t
  always analyze it and the threatened seldom do.</p>

  <p>Feeling like a bear that has treed his man, Jim waited in expectant
  silence, little guessing, in spite of all his hard-won understanding of
  Eastern human nature, what a consummate player of surprise hands he had to
  deal with.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allah makes all things easy. I can deal three or four of you as
  easily as one,&rdquo; remarked the <i>iblis</i> after a long silence.</p>

  <p>Jim did not answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can deal with twenty-five as easily as one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not deal with one first, while you have the chance?&rdquo;
  laughed Jim.</p>

  <p>For answer to that the <i>iblis</i> pressed out the candle with his thumb
  and threw the cave into instant, utter blackness. He did not make a sound,
  but by the time Jim could get the flashlight from his pocket and press the
  button there was no sign of him anywhere. He had vanished as completely as
  the darkness did under the electric glare.</p>

  <p>Jim gripped his pistol and flashed the light all over the cave, turning
  the rays into the other recesses one by one. As far as he could see from
  where he stood they all seemed empty, but he did not dare leave his place by
  the entrance to look more carefully because that would have given the
  <i>iblis</i> a chance to bolt. If there was a passage leading through one of
  the recesses into another cave he could afford to wait and look for that
  after the arrival of Catesby and Narayan Singh, because however many their
  ramifications, those ancient tombs of Palestine never have more than one
  small opening to the world outside.</p>

  <p>He kept the light turned steadily on the floor in front of him to guard
  against surprise, and presently he knew why the <i>iblis</i> had chosen just
  that moment for disappearance. Jim&rsquo;s own ears are exceptionally sharp,
  but the other&rsquo;s must have been sharper. He could hear approaching
  footsteps now. Catesby and Narayan Singh were coming.</p>

  <p>He did not look around to greet them. From somewhere in the coal-black
  shadow of one of the recesses the <i>iblis</i> began barking like a jackal.
  Most fanatics use some form or other of animal noise to goad themselves into
  action. He kept his eyes alert in front of him and, since he did not choose
  to betray his nationality to the <i>iblis</i> yet, called aloud to his
  friends in Arabic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ta&rsquo;ala, islab; ma fi darar!</i> (Come on, you fellows;
  there&rsquo;s nothing the matter!)&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> barked again, and footsteps in the winding tunnel behind
  him doubled their speed. He set his back more squarely against the opening,
  for if the <i>iblis</i> proposed to make a rush for if the <i>iblis</i>
  proposed to make a rush for liberty now was his last chance; or his active
  muscle might count on surprise and speed to upset men groping through a
  narrow passage with the light behind them.</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> changed his bark into a yell. Jim stiffened himself for
  action. Less than a second later a hand reached forward from behind him and
  seized his throat in a grip there was no breaking. He tried to fire backward
  over his shoulder, but another hand seized his wrist and nearly broke it,
  wrenching the pistol free.</p>

  <p>Then two men jumped on him, and when the steely fingers on his throat had
  squeezed him half-unconscious they bound both wrists behind him with a
  leather thong and threw him face downward on the floor. There he lay still,
  making no effort yet to look about him, concentrating all his faculties on
  regaining breath and recovering from the physical pain. He was stunned, hurt
  and ashamed of himself for being taken by surprise; and as soon as he could
  breathe without agony he battled down and beat the unmanning suggestions of
  self-accusation that have put many more stout men out of business than ever
  surprise or defeat did.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall we cut his throat?&rdquo; inquired a gruff-voice
  casually.</p>

  <p>There was no immediate answer. Jim lay with the gooseflesh rising and
  receding on his back in tidal waves, while an Arab whom he could not see
  stood across him with a foot on either side, ready at a nod to do the butcher
  work.</p>

  <p>Someone lighted the candle-end. Another someone blew it out. There began
  to be whispering over in a corner. Other men came in through the tunnel and
  threw heavy objects on the floor, one or two of which rattled with the sound
  of rifle swivels.</p>

  <p>It seemed that there was quite an argument going on, although Jim could
  not distinguish the voice of the <i>iblis</i>. They hissed over in the corner
  like a lot of snakes, once and again a low growl breaking out by way of
  emphasis. The man who stood athwart Jim&rsquo;s ribs grew restless and struck
  a long knife on the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s cut his throat and be done with it,&rdquo; he
  grumbled, stooping to fumble for Jim&rsquo;s forehead and bend his head back
  for the sacrifice.</p>

  <p>To have started to struggle at that moment would have meant death certain;
  the Arab would have taken the decision on himself. But it was nervous work to
  lie still with throat bent convex, taut and ready.</p>

  <p>One other thought monopolized Jim&rsquo;s brain at that minute. Knife or
  no knife, he was ready to let out a yell of warning if he could catch sound
  of his friends&rsquo; footsteps in time. If he died for it the next second,
  he must save them from advancing into the trap, and he listened
  desperately.</p>

  <p>He thought it was all up when the whole gang began to cross the floor
  toward him. Then he put up the best fight possible, which wasn&rsquo;t much
  in the circumstances. Just before the first man reached him he rose to his
  knees with a jerk and tossed the would-be executioner over his head.</p>

  <p>The man who had annexed his flashlight discovered how to turn it on, but
  held it sidewise, and nine men stood revealed, all eyes turned on the new
  toy. Jim charged the nearest of them head forward and butted him in the
  belly, sending him sprawling. But the rest fell on him, tripped him up, beat
  him and pulled a bag over his head.</p>

  <p>They bound a cloth tightly over his mouth outside the bag, and a moment
  later he was being hustled out of the cave, pricked on from behind by the
  knife- point of the wrathful one who had been butted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Allah!&rdquo; growled an angry voice behind him. &ldquo;There
  shall be a high price exacted for that ram&rsquo;s pleasantry! By morning you
  shall wish <i>Um Kulsum</i> (an utterly unrighteous harridan of Arab legend)
  had never brought you forth.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Allah makes all things
  easy!&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">JIM had not the least idea where they were taking him. His
  trained sense of direction was checkmated by a simple precaution that they
  took outside the cave, pushing him from one to the other and spinning him in
  a sort of savage blindman&rsquo;s buff. To end that ignominy he lay down at
  last, whereat they kicked and dragged him up again and hurried on their
  way.</p>

  <p>It was all he could do to breathe through the combination of gag and
  gunny-bag. That effort and the pain in his wrist kept his normally keen
  intuition in abeyance; but he did experience the sensation of passing between
  high walls, and suspected accordingly that their course lay south, along the
  <i>wady</i> through which he had reached the tomb. He could not tell whether
  the <i>iblis</i> was with them or not. The very few words that passed were in
  a low whisper. But by the jingle of metal on metal he knew that some of his
  captors were carrying looted rifles; and once they stopped to gather up
  something heavy and several of them carried along afterward in turns between
  them. Whatever that load might be, they drove away jackals from it before
  stopping to pick it up.</p>

  <p>Supposing that his surmise was correct that they were hurrying down the
  <i>wady</i>, then he was sure that they turned nearly due west at the end of
  it; but after that the windings of the course were altogether too mazy to
  remember. He had begun by counting his steps from the point where they left
  off hazing him, but realized the uselessness of that after the eighth or
  ninth turn.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, in spite of the gag and the pain in his wrist he was
  fairly cheerful. If they had proposed to kill him, he argued, they would have
  done it in the tomb; and it was his natural New England-born conviction that
  no set of circumstances are irretrievable until so proven. He even saw humor
  in the situation, now that he was sure that Catesby and Narayan Singh would
  not rush headlong into ambush.</p>

  <p>He could not smile or even chuckle under the smothering gag; but mirth
  does not really need expression, as the red man knew, who regarded laughter
  as womanly weakness. The imaginary picture of Suliman&rsquo;s rage on finding
  the cave empty&mdash;of Catesby&rsquo;s better bread chagrin&mdash;and of
  Narayan Singh&rsquo;s grim, muttered vengefulness gave him the full feeling
  of laughter without its compromising form.</p>

  <p>Even in that predicament he did not think with any approval of the
  prospect of swift death for the <i>iblis</i>. He wanted facts first; after
  those let come what might.</p>

  <p>Jim has altogether peculiar qualities that some consider cold-blooded; it
  never gave him the slightest twinge of satisfaction to see a criminal land in
  jail at the end of a long battle between wits, nor yet to see a murderer
  hung. What interested him at the moment&mdash;and so deeply that he would
  rather die than fail to unearth the lowest root of it&mdash;was the scheme
  behind the criminal. He had a sort of sporting admiration for the man
  himself, provided only he was game, much as a real hunter has a friendly
  feeling for the animal that does its fighting utmost.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless it amused him to imagine the <i>iblis</i> fool enough to wait
  there in the tomb and be discovered by Narayan Singh. Narayan Singh knew no
  such nice distinctions; his was the direct, unwavering desire to get his man,
  with death as the only logical and satisfying finish to a criminal
  career.</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> would likely learn quite a lot about physical pain if he
  should fall into the Sikh&rsquo;s hands and refuse to give information; with
  his own wrist aching like a tooth that thought did not exactly make Jim
  worry.</p>

  <p>Unless you kill outright a man who can amuse himself in that way, thinking
  of other things in spite of his predicament while captors hurry him helpless
  toward an unimaginable fate, you never can have the best of him. For he is
  not mesmerized by circumstance. Fear gets no chance to do its paralyzing
  work. Though the fact seems exactly the reverse, the odds are really in his
  favor.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s captors were obsessed by the knowledge that they had a
  prisoner who must be disposed of in some way; and the longer they put him off
  the less simple and convenient the solution was going to seem. Jim, on the
  other hand, was thinking of anything except that prospect, so that when the
  next development was staged he faced it quite unconvinced of desperation.</p>

  <p>Most captors imagine they had imprisoned a man&rsquo;s wits when they have
  tied his hands, and many prisoners believe it too; but the wise man when he
  is bound thinks of &ldquo;Shakespeare and the musical glasses&rdquo; until
  his moment comes. Jim began to consider the probably past history of that
  cavernous tomb he had left, while they hustled him through the darkness and
  worried one another with horse whisperings.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They crossed the railway at last, for he tripped twice on
  the metals, which meant that they had turned from the west or thereabouts to
  very nearly due east. Ten minutes&rsquo; hurry after that brought them to
  some sort of stone building, where they let him lean against the wall while
  one of the party wrestled with a rusty lock and key.</p>

  <p>He tried to work his hands loose by rubbing the thong against the
  stonework, but made small progress because of the pain in his wrist, and only
  succeeded in working off his scarab ring.</p>

  <p>The door swung open at last on creaking hinges. Two men took him by the
  shoulders and thrust him forward. He tripped on a stone still, and they
  jeered as he landed face downward on a rough stone floor. A second later the
  door slammed shut behind him and he heard the scream of the complaining
  key.</p>

  <p>He lay still and listened for several minutes to discover whether he was
  alone or not. Hearing nothing, he scrambled to his feet and, backing until he
  reached the wall, began to feel his way along it, hunting some projection
  against which he might chafe the leather thong. The room he was in was
  circular, which set him thinking.</p>

  <p>Part way around the circuit he felt some steps, and a rusty iron rod
  supporting the handrail. There were better tools that that for cutting
  rawhide, but the rawhide was eating into his wrists, and necessity sharpens
  patience.</p>

  <p>First against the edge of a stone step, then against the rusty iron, then
  against the step again, he chafed and sawed, injuring his own skin almost as
  often as the leather, and without any means of measuring progress. During a
  pause while he strained at the thong to test it he heard a sound that seemed
  familiar.</p>

  <p>In a flash his thought went back to the entrance of the tomb and the dry,
  peculiar noise that had induced him to enter. It sounded like the same cough
  or belch or whatever it was. Yet he could hear no breathing.</p>

  <p>He changed the order of proceedings then and knelt, working his face up
  and down against the step to get the gag off, and succeeded after several
  minutes in forcing it down over his chin, where it hung loose. But it was not
  so simple to get the bag off his head. He managed that finally by bending his
  head downward and shaking it until the blood surged up behind his eyes and
  the universe seemed like a sea of fire with purple stars in it.</p>

  <p>It was a minute after he had got rid of the sack before he could see at
  all, although the circular room in which he found himself was not absolutely
  dark. Faint moonlight filtered through a small iron-barred window set twelve
  feet above the floor, and dimly illuminated the bare walls.</p>

  <p>He stared about him for another minute before his eyes recovered
  sufficiently to make out a shadowy shape beneath the window. Little by
  little, as he grew accustomed to the dim light, he made out the outline of a
  man, who sat so still as to seem dead, although it was an uncommon posture
  for a dead man, squatting Moslem-fashion, elbow on knee. He was about to
  approach to investigate when the man moved, and then he recognized the
  <i>iblis</i>.</p>

  <p>The movement was in character. He had been sitting shrouded in a brown
  cloak, but threw it back now from his shoulders and sat naked, eyeing Jim
  with scornful curiosity, much as he might have watched the antics of a beetle
  on a pin. Jim set his back against the steps and resumed his labor at the
  thong, pressing hard and rubbing with as little noise as possible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can deal with you with your hands free,&rdquo; said the
  <i>iblis</i> after a minute or two.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; Jim suggested, and threw caution to the winds.</p>

  <p>Pretending to chafe more violently at the thong, measure the distance with
  his eyes meanwhile, he went for the <i>iblis</i> with a sudden run and jump,
  intending to land feet foremost on him. But without any obvious muscular
  effort, the <i>iblis</i> shifted his position just as suddenly half a yard to
  the right, and Jim&rsquo;s feet hit the wall.</p>

  <p>He made a prodigious effort to recover balance and jump again, but fell on
  his back, and having lost his Arab headdress when he shook the bag free,
  contact with the stone floor nearly stunned him. So he lay still, and the
  <i>iblis</i> leaned down to peer into his face, with that unchanging,
  curiously scornful smile that was half-sneer, half-amusement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can deal with three&mdash;or thirty&mdash;or three hundred of
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not answer. With his hands free, half-stunned or not, he would
  have taken his chance in a free-for-all fight, though the <i>iblis</i> was as
  strong as two of him; but to tempt providence in his present position would
  have been sheer lunacy. He was constitutionally unable to believe himself
  down and out as long as consciousness remained, so he lay and wondered whence
  his opportunity would come and what form it would take.</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> provided it. He was evidently of an economical turn of
  mind, for he produced from a pocket in the discarded cloak the self-same stub
  of candle that had served his purpose in the tomb, and lit it. Jim set his
  teeth, thinking at first that torture was to be the next item on the program;
  for in the fingers of an expert a lighted candle can do as much mischief as a
  red-hot iron. But the <i>iblis</i> only looked about for a place to set the
  light on, and leaned over finally to drip wax on the floor and stick it there
  out of reach.</p>

  <p>So Jim scrambled to his feet again. The <i>iblis</i> looked up at him and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See what is upstairs,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Untie my wrists!&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> did it, not troubling to get to his feet but turning Jim
  around and unknotting the thong with fingers that were strong enough to have
  unraveled wire. Standing, chafing his wrists to restore circulation and get
  some of the pain out of the swollen one, Jim realized how utterly helpless he
  would be if he tried to fight. It was true that he had boots on and could
  kick, but unless you are very certain of your aim, and equally sure of
  surprising your adversary, one blow wins no battle.</p>

  <p>So he decided to try the stairs and see. But the <i>iblis</i> sprang
  across the room in front of him and prevented him by sitting on the bottom
  step.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; he grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why the change of mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back to the wall and sit down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim went back and leaned against the wall, holding his hot wrist against
  the cool stone, grateful for any way of gaining time, for time was obviously
  in his favor. For one thing, Catesby would probably report him missing; and
  Narayan Singh would certainly not rest until he had found him dead or
  alive.</p>

  <p>If he could only guess what the <i>iblis</i>&rsquo; purpose was in
  bringing him to that place he would have a great deal more than time in his
  favor, for the man with definite plans and a nefarious purpose is always at a
  disadvantage as compared to an equally determined man aware of both plan and
  purpose and bent on spoiling both.</p>

  <p>He felt his way along the wall to the door and tested the lock while he
  weighed the situation in his mind. The lock was set into an immensely heavy
  wooden door and was unbreakable without tools; but a little enlightenment
  dawned as he watched the <i>iblis</i>, who sat smiling at his futile effort
  to escape.</p>

  <p>Upstairs there was probably loot&mdash;most likely rifles. That would
  account for the <i>iblis</i> being willing for him to go up there with his
  hands tied, and unwilling otherwise. Supposing that only five per cent of the
  loot stolen from the British camp in the last month or two was up there, the
  <i>iblis</i> certainly would not carry it away alone, and probably would not
  dare leave it where it was much longer. Therefore it was likely that he was
  waiting for men, who would come before morning to remove the stuff; nobody
  would be fool enough to run that risk after daybreak.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s spirits began to rise. If his guess was correct, then he was
  on the trail of something vastly more important than the mere thieves. The
  ultimate receivers of the loot were worth all risks to bring to book.
  Certainly the <i>iblis</i> could be nothing more than a mere agent, because a
  naked dervish trying to dispose of rifles for any purpose or in any market
  would fall foul of the law within an hour, even if he tried to employ agents
  on his own account. There was somebody higher up&mdash;not a doubt of it.</p>

  <p>It began to seem wisest to play the other fellow&rsquo;s game and wait
  patiently, if only because that might force the <i>iblis</i> to move next and
  show something of his hand. He might be a lunatic like many another pseudo-
  religious sensation-maker; but it was much more likely that he was a very
  shrewd expert in human nature, busily applying all the simple principles he
  knew, after the fashion of a drill-sergeant, or a jailer, or a trainer of
  wild beasts. His strength was circumstantial and physical; all the conditions
  were in his favor, as much as if he had deliberately decoyed his prisoner to
  chosen ground. His weak points were two&mdash;vanity and time.</p>

  <p>So Jim sat down. And curiosity took hold of him so completely as to
  obliterate the pain in his wrists along with all sense of his own danger.
  Satisfied that the <i>iblis</i> had a definite objective and a motive behind
  every move, he cared for nothing but to discover what they were.</p>

  <p>The same spirit that had made him study Arabic until he knew the language
  better than most Arabs did, gripped him in the same way that the laboratory
  scientist is seized. It would have annoyed him at that moment to be
  discovered by his friends and rescued.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget; his two weak points are time and
  vanity!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That thought was like a formula running through the mind of a chemist
  bending over his retorts.</p>

  <p>Even vanity was not strong enough to blind the <i>iblis</i> to the element
  of time, although it made him so sure of his own perceptive faculty that he
  never suspected his prisoner might be other than a local Arab. It was
  evidently no part of his plan to waste time letting the sense of mystery grow
  thin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allah makes all things easy,&rdquo; he announced again. &ldquo;I
  can tell your father&rsquo;s name and your mother&rsquo;s, and the name of
  the village you come from.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If Jim&rsquo;s curiosity had been of a non-scientific turn he would have
  dared the man to do it; and the <i>iblis</i> no doubt would have side-stepped
  by refusing to commit himself. He would not have been one step nearer to
  discovery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vanity and time&mdash;vanity and time&mdash;those are his weak
  points!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Time could look after itself, for the minutes go by changeless measure.
  Jim decided to tickle vanity, which is usually dangerous until well fed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is indeed a great gift,&rdquo; he said respectfully. &ldquo;I
  remember that you called me by my right name in the tomb tonight. To be able
  to tell a man&rsquo;s name, and those of his father and mother, and his
  village&mdash;that is wonderful!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allah makes all things easy,&rdquo; smiled the <i>iblis</i> self-
  complacently. &ldquo;I not only have gifts, I confer them. I not only have
  power, I can pass it on to others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was something vaguely familiar about that statement. Jim had heard
  it, not exactly in those words, but near enough, in a back room in Boston
  where an occultist held forth; and again in New York City in a barroom where
  a political gang-leader held brief sway. Only this man, being half-savage and
  believing he dealt with another like himself, made his boasts a little bit
  more definite. Possibly, like the politician and the occultist, he half
  believed his own assertions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How does a man attain such gifts?&rdquo; Jim asked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is all in the Koran,&rdquo; said the <i>iblis</i>. &ldquo;Allah
  makes all things easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They say that all knowledge is written in the Koran,&rdquo; Jim
  answered. &ldquo;But who shall understand it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> chuckled from the depths of his immense conceit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no profit in ignorance. But there is wisdom in obeying
  those who understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you understand? Shall I obey you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>must</i> obey me. I could kill you here&mdash;now&mdash;with
  these fingers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was probably perfectly true. Jim did not choose to dispute it; he
  would have had as much chance against a gorilla.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could let you go and cause you to drop dead within fifty
  paces,&rdquo; continued the <i>iblis</i>. &ldquo;I, who know your name, and
  your birthplace, can curse them all and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Jim protested. It was just as easy to pretend terror
  as to laugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that! In the name of Allah, Lord of
  Creatures, don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then obey me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must. What else can I do? You have made me afraid,&rdquo; said
  Jim, wondering just how many superstitious potential thieves had been
  initiated in that room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you disobey in one thing you shall turn to worms&mdash;in one
  day&mdash;in two days&mdash;in three days&mdash;according to the measure of
  disobedience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was clever. Every victim was sure to disobey in some particular, but
  delay in fulfillment of the overhanging threat could only be held to qualify
  the disobedience, and the fear would remain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For disobedience you shall turn to worms. Your roof shall fall in.
  Your relatives shall die of want.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what if I obey?&rdquo; Jim asked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> chuckled again, as if reviewing in his mind the wondrous
  list of prizes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those who are obedient have protection. Provided with protection
  they may help themselves. Allah makes all things easy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you pretend to be a leper?&rdquo; Jim asked suddenly and at
  that the <i>iblis</i> flew into such a rage that every muscle in his huge
  frame trembled.</p>

  <p>His eyes blazed. His lips, thrust outward like an ape&rsquo;s, uncovered
  yellow teeth that could have crushed a forearm. Fingers strong enough to
  pluck out a victim&rsquo;s sinews one by one twitched with desire, and his
  long toes kept time with them. Suddenly he spat, writhing up his face into
  hideous contortions, and hissing as he had done in the cave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cursed dog of an unbelieving fool!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Son of
  sixty dogs and a cesspool! Impudent, insolent, abominable lump of earth about
  to perish! Bloodless, loveless, senseless, hopeless <i>pig!</i> Eater of
  worms and dung! Idiot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Foam bubbled through his teeth and ran down on his chin in slime. It was
  not difficult to be afraid of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come and touch me! Come and see how soon I can make you a
  leper!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not to obey, of course, was disobedience. On the other hand, to obey would
  be to call the bluff, which might oblige the <i>iblis</i> to take some
  unimaginably desperate course. There was no guessing what tricks he had in
  store, so Jim played safe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;In the name of Allah the
  compassionate, not that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can make <i>abras</i> (leprous) whom I will!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was Jim&rsquo;s cue to do a little sensational acting. Plainly the
  purpose was to make him thoroughly afraid, so to get at the motive behind the
  purpose he would have to seem afraid; and he set to work to do that. Most of
  Jim&rsquo;s successes had been won by keeping his head in emergencies; he had
  not much experience of the outward effects of terror on himself. He had to
  risk overacting the part, putting in practice all he could remember of the
  symptoms of Arab panic.</p>

  <p>His teeth stubbornly refused to chatter, and he could not make the cold
  sweat come; but he could slobber and mutter Koran text and beg for mercy,
  throwing himself forward to beat on the floor with the palms of his hands and
  call the <i>iblis</i> such names as &ldquo;prince of wizards&mdash;lord of
  potent curses&mdash;father of terrors and captain of calamities,&rdquo; names
  which pleased the <i>iblis</i> very much indeed.</p>

  <p>After that he flew into a panic, making believe he thought the
  <i>iblis</i> would rush at him. He scrambled to his feet and hugged the wall
  like an animal trying to escape, then beat on the door with his fists, and
  finally came to a stand with open mouth and glaring eyes as if hope were gone
  and he could only await the inevitable.</p>

  <p>The <i>iblis</i> appeared to consider himself a judge of such symptoms,
  and was not quite satisfied yet. He, too, seemed to await the inevitable, as
  if fear always ran an appointed course and he preferred to see the thing
  complete.</p>

  <p>Jim, aping abject terror, stood and wondered what the&mdash;the man
  expected more. What should an Arab in fear of witchcraft do in proof of utter
  lack of self-control? He had it! He sprang at the candle and stamped out the
  light with his foot, screaming instantly in added terror of darkness and
  scrambling around the wall to the door again to bear on it and shout for
  help.</p>

  <p>At last the <i>iblis</i> appeared satisfied. It was time to turn the last
  trick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allah makes all things easy. I can find you in the dark!&rdquo; he
  boomed.</p>

  <p>In answer Jim groaned and muttered enough to satisfy the very hellions who
  stoke the fires of Eblis.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can make you <i>abras</i> without touching you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, no! <i>Shi mamkut! Mnain hashshakawi!</i> (That is
  abominable! How could you be so wicked!)&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or I can spare you if I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spare me then, father of afflictions!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or I can spare you for a little while, and reach you with my curses
  at a distance if you disobey me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn him, I wish he&rsquo;d hurry up,&rdquo; thought Jim.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired of this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he managed to keep up a pretty good semblance of terror; and either
  the <i>iblis</i> was getting tired, too, or else time began to press.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be still. I will spare for the present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ilham&rsquo;dillah!</i>&rsquo; (God be praised!)</p>

  <p>Jim collapsed into a squatting posture on the floor, moving his head this
  and that way to try and see the other in the dark; but the
  <i>iblis&rsquo;</i> black skin made that impossible. Apparently, however, the
  <i>iblis</i> could see Jim and guessed his purpose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can be invisible whenever I choose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O father of darkness, what do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! What do I want with you? What but to make of you a wizard like
  myself. I recognize the spirit of obedience, but there must be a
  test.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father of terrors, I have been too much tested!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Malaish</i>. (No matter.) There is another. Fail in this and you
  shall see the leprosy seize you in an hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Having exhausted all the outward forms of fear he could think of, Jim sat
  still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My servants will come presently,&rdquo; said the <i>iblis</i>.
  &ldquo;They are not such as you, fit to become wizards, but
  servants&mdash;mean men&mdash;dogs. They will take things away from here to
  another place. Go with them, but say nothing to them. Answer no questions.
  Watch where they put the things. Then return and bring word of it to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I obey, father of happenings,&rdquo; Jim answered meekly.</p>

  <p>It was almost the hardest thing he ever did to keep a note of triumph from
  his voice that minute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak one word to them&mdash;answer one question&mdash;and the curse
  shall rot the carcasses of you and yours!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am silent&mdash;silent!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then <i>be</i> silent!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For another half hour Jim and the <i>iblis</i> faced each other in
  darkness, Jim on the floor with his back against the wall and the
  <i>iblis</i> on the bottom step. What with headache, hunger, pain in his
  wrist and general weariness Jim almost fell asleep; but just as the first
  false light before dawn brightened the narrow window there came a stealthy,
  subdued knocking on the door that brought the <i>iblis</i> to his feet. He
  crossed the room, put on his brown cloak, produced an enormous key, went to
  listen at the door, and after a backward, precautionary glance in Jim&rsquo;s
  direction opened it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;The <i>butcha</i> speaks
  wisdom.&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">CATESBY and Narayan Singh had no more matches; and Suliman
  had none, for they searched him. They tried to fathom the cave&rsquo;s
  recesses in the dark, but gave that up as hopeless; even the Sikh&rsquo;s
  eyes could not penetrate the Stygian darkness that began where the faintly
  reflected starlight ceased, a yard or two from the entrance hole.</p>

  <p>So they climbed out, and with Suliman disconsolate on Narayan
  Singh&rsquo;s knees held a consultation. Catesby, of course, began it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which shall we do? Return to camp and report Major Grim missing, or
  hunt about and try to find him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Suliman spoke next, being only a stickler for etiquette when he could
  score by it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not go back to camp! If that <i>iblis</i> has eaten Jimgrim,
  then Narayan Singh must kill the <i>iblis</i> and cut his belly open and let
  Jimgrim out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby laughed, but Narayan Singh knew better. It is not only the
  children in that land who believe in goblin stories.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If we go back to camp without him, <i>sahib</i>, half the camp will
  call us liars and the other half will believe henceforth all the tales about
  the <i>iblis</i>, and twice as many more tales of their own invention.
  Moreover, my orders are to bring that Jimgrim back to Jerusalem
  alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But where to look?&rdquo; wondered Catesby.</p>

  <p>There was cactus-covered sandy hill and dale in every direction. They
  might chance on footprints, but likely enough it would be easier and quicker
  work to follow rumor through Jerusalem city than such a trail by
  moonlight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us ask the <i>butcha</i>,&rdquo; said Narayan Singh, preferring
  to be charged with talking nonsense rather than seem to rebuke an
  officer.</p>

  <p>Etiquette in his case was something only to be broken in a pinch.</p>

  <p>Catesby produced a cigarette, and swore, remembering he had no matches.
  Narayan Singh, with mutiny in mind if Catesby should insist on going back to
  camp, proceeded after a fashion of his own to draft a proposition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now Suliman-jee, son of the warrior Rustum, how much have you
  learned from Jimgrim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is a very great deal. Tell me some of it. Where would thieves
  sell loot, for instance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the <i>suk</i> (bazaar).&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That might be. But if they feared to go into the <i>suk</i>, what
  then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They might run away over the hills to Hebron.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case we cannot follow them tonight. But if they were going
  to the <i>suk</i>, would they go by night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not, father of ready answers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They would be shot. None but thieves enter a town by
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if they had loot with them, would they wait to be caught with
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They would bury it, or hide it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;what then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One or two would go into the town at daybreak. Later a cart would
  come, or a camel, or an ox; and the loot would be taken to the <i>suk</i> by
  daylight, covered up. That is how all the thieves behave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father of good scouting! And would they hide the loot on this side
  of the railway track, or beyond?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is a foolish question. If they hid it on this side, whoever
  came afterward to fetch it would have to carry it across the track by
  daylight, and the track is always watched.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, father of knavery! Whereas between the track and the
  town&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who would search a cart or a camel between the town and the railway
  line? The car leaves town and returns; that is nothing. It is carts and
  camels crossing the track that are always searched.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True. True. At night thieves could cross the track
  unseen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Easily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But they could not enter the town unseen. That is so. And if we
  should watch the open land between the railway and the town at daybreak, we
  might learn something. Do you hear him, <i>sahib</i>? The butcha
  <i>speaks</i> wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby yawned, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Narayan Singh. I see your mind&rsquo;s set on not going
  back to camp. Suits me. Better a night in the open than a lame tale for
  General Jenkins! Besides, I like your kind of guts. Come on, we&rsquo;ll head
  for the railway line.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Sikh carried Suliman, who promptly fell asleep with his
  head hanging downward over the stalwart shoulder like a dead sheep&rsquo;s,
  swinging in time to the stride.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s a nuisance,&rdquo; Catesby commented.
  &ldquo;However, I suppose he can&rsquo;t be expected to wake up and walk in
  this sand, and we can&rsquo;t leave him. I&rsquo;ll carry him turn about with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, <i>sahib</i>, it is nothing. Let him sleep. In the morning
  when he wakes he may serve a purpose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But full rations ever since Jim had rescued him from starving in the Jaffa
  Gate had filled out the boy&rsquo;s stocky frame, and it was no easy matter
  to carry him for mile after mile across that loose desert land. Even when
  they came to cultivation the going was still heavy, and Catesby took his
  turn, wondering after five minutes of it at the Sikh&rsquo;s endurance.</p>

  <p>They had to put the boy down, and wake him, and make him walk when they
  neared the railway because, being in Arab costume, they were certain to be
  fired at unless they took cover and watched their chance. Finally, after
  slinking for half an hour among long shadows, they crawled through a culvert
  and emerged on the far side without being challenged, although two Gurkas on
  patrol passed within ten yards of where they hid.</p>

  <p>Within three hundred paces of them, then, was a cluster of ruined
  buildings, shot to pieces in the war and never since rebuilt, but patched
  here and there as if someone had tried to make them habitable. In the
  moonlight, they looked like a medieval castle with its upper story gone, for
  part of what might have been the keep reared jagged and broken above the
  rest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that place, <i>sahib</i>?&rdquo; asked Narayan Singh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing much. It used to be an Arab village with a mosque in the
  middle. Our guns shelled it, and most of it was burned. That tower you see is
  all that&rsquo;s left of the minaret. Nobody uses the place now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sikh&rsquo;s one monosyllable suggested a world of reservations rather
  than assent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That place&rsquo;ll be full of lice and bedbugs,&rdquo; Catesby
  warned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, and these days the peace have made us fat, <i>sahib</i>. They
  will have good feasting! The top of that broken tower is the place from which
  to watch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on, then. Let&rsquo;s get bitten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But it was not easy to reach the buildings without risking being seen by
  sentries on patrol, and they had to crawl under cover of a ridge of sandy
  earth that held more thorns and insects to the square yard than a brush has
  bristles. Then a pariah dog smelled them and yelped to the pack, and for five
  minutes they were the center of abominable noise.</p>

  <p>They did not dare shoot, any more than the curs dared come close enough to
  be killed with a stick. Throwing lumps of dirt and sticks only increased the
  yelping; and there weren&rsquo;t any stones. But finally another pariah
  yelped in the distance and the pack raced off to fight him for his find.</p>

  <p>After that it was an easy matter to approach the ruined mosque, but quite
  another task to climb the tower. The cluttered village street was all in
  shadow, but the moon shone full on the mosque wall, showing it all in ruins
  with the broken tower beside it, erect and unclimbable.</p>

  <p>The place was of typical Arab &ldquo;culture&rdquo;&mdash;jumbled,
  tumbled, cluttered, evil-smelling, verminous; war had only multiplied the
  normal chaos. That minaret had been the only decent building, and it remained
  the only thing worth anybody&rsquo;s trouble.</p>

  <p>There was one little slit of a window visible almost directly facing the
  moon. It looked faintly luminous.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you suppose there&rsquo;s glass in it?&rdquo; asked
  Catesby. &ldquo;Does that look like reflected light to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh scouted closed to investigate. The window was much too high
  to reach, but he climbed on a broken wall to reach its level and returned at
  the end of ten minutes, stopping on his way to examine the ground close to
  the door. A slash of while across the blackness of his beard betrayed that he
  was pleased with the result.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard no sound, <i>sahib</i>; but there is no glass, and there is
  a light within. Moreover, I found this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put a scarab ring into Catesby&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimgrim <i>sahib&rsquo;s!</i>&rdquo; cried the Sikh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you know? They&rsquo;re common enough. It might be
  anyone&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ask the <i>butcha</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suliman examined it and grew exited at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Taib!</i> That is Jimgrim&rsquo;s. I have cleaned it for him
  fifty times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ve killed him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby had been too much of late under the brigadier&rsquo;s harrow to be
  an optimist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, <i>sahib</i>. More likely he dropped it there for me to find.
  If they had killed him we should have found his naked body in the cave or
  thereabouts. If they had looted the ring and dropped it when they reached
  this place, they would have missed it and have looked. It lay in full
  moonlight on the flat side of a broken stone against the wall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I go,&rdquo; said Suliman, &ldquo;to break that door down with
  this <i>kukri</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ahsti, ahsti!</i>&rdquo; said the Sikh. &ldquo;What is your
  judgment, <i>sahib</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Catesby was in high spirits again.</p>

  <p>It took a Jenkins to depress him, and not much more than a symptom of
  encouragement to set him up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No sense in rushing things. If he&rsquo;s dead, he&rsquo;s dead. If
  he&rsquo;s alive in there we&rsquo;ll get him. Is there another
  door?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None, <i>sahib</i>. I saw all around the place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll watch this one until morning, and creep up close
  enough to hear if anything happens. Look about for a beam to have handy in
  case we should want to burst the door in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Together they pulled a roof-beam out from a mess of fallen thatch, and
  laid it where they could find it in the dark that would shut down when the
  moonlight waned. Then Narayan Singh crept close to the door and listened. He
  was grinning again when he returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is in there, and alive. I heard his voice. I could not hear the
  words. He seemed to be close to the door and to be carrying on a
  conversation. Shall I go back and rap on the door softly as a
  signal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. It might be the signal for his death. How many voices did you
  hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be sure to yell if they tried to murder him. In that
  case, down with the door. But if we go to his rescue before he needs us we
  might spoil his game.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Atcha, sahib</i>,&rdquo; said the Sikh; but he examined both
  pistols again and plainly did not like the inactivity.</p>

  <p>It relieved his anxiety a little, however, when Catesby chose a black hole
  to hide in among the tumbled ruins of the mosque within twenty paces of the
  minaret door.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Nobody who has not tried it, out hunting or in war, can
  guess how hard it is to listen attentively and scratch himself at the same
  time. Suliman, who not so many months ago had been clothed in little else
  than paupers&rsquo; lice and had hardly had time to forget the indifference
  that goes with it, suffered least. Perhaps, too, his carcass was less
  appetizing.</p>

  <p>But the Sikh is a clean race, prone to look down on even the tubbed and
  scrubbed British officer as none too particular. And that heap of ruins was
  alive with myriads of body-insects, &ldquo;whose seed is in themselves&rdquo;
  and that exist apparently eternally on nothing until warm-blooded provender
  arrives.</p>

  <p>Yet they did not dare move away. The moon was too low in the sky, and
  whoever had brought Jim to that place would likely to make a move of some
  kind before morning, or at least soon after sunrise. If this were a
  rendezvous of thieves, whoever approached it would likely do some careful
  scouting in advance. There was nothing for it by to lie still and
  scratch&mdash;and swear&mdash;and scratch.</p>

  <p>The Sikh&rsquo;s ears were sharpest, and once he swore he heard the voice
  of a man begging for mercy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe Jimgrim has a man down?&rdquo; ventured Suliman.</p>

  <p>But the other two grew nervous, and this time it was Catesby who crawled
  to the door to listen while Narayan Singh watched the coast. Catesby, too,
  distinguished the voices of two men, or thought he did; but the door was too
  thick for him to hear one word or establish Jim&rsquo;s identity. He crept
  back again into hiding in that divided frame of mind from which small comfort
  ever comes, wondering what he would think of himself should it turn out
  afterward that Jim had been all along in peril of his life&mdash;already dead
  perhaps; yet recalling Jim&rsquo;s words earlier that night, that it would be
  better to wait for a week than spoil things by a false move.</p>

  <p>When dawn came, what with insects and indecision they were thoroughly
  miserable, stiff, sore, hungry and depressed by the zero-hour self-
  consciousness that sheds the drear light of cold unreason on every
  circumstance. Suliman, who had been blubbering, fell asleep again.</p>

  <p>Catesby&rsquo;s thoughts were back on Jenkins and the hopelessness of
  clearing himself of a false charge in view of the brigadier&rsquo;s notorious
  ability to lie plausibly. Narayan Singh was squatting with eyes half-closed,
  dreaming in another language and another dimension, for that matter; not even
  the Sikhs can tell each other what thoughts reach them when the far-away look
  settles on their faces.</p>

  <p>None of them saw the morning visitors arrive until the twelfth and last of
  them came abreast and the first one struck the door with cautious knuckles.
  They were ordinary-looking <i>fellaheen</i>&mdash;villagers, that
  is&mdash;and each man carried some ordinary-looking load or
  other&mdash;baskets, mats, bags, a patchwork quilt.</p>

  <p>The last man led a donkey&mdash;one of those bruised and tortured little
  insects that make less noise than a ghost and eat endless Arab blows and
  insult in return for overwork. None of the men had a weapon as far as it was
  possible to see; for lack of the customary thick club the last man used his
  fist on the donkey&rsquo;s nose as a hint that it was time to stand
  still.</p>

  <p>The leading man knocked half a dozen times; then the door opened and they
  all filed in, but from where the watchers lay it was not possible to see who
  opened it. The donkey went in too, and the lock squealed again behind
  her.</p>

  <p>There followed further agonies of indecision and impatience; for, weapons
  or no weapons, there is no limit at all to the senseless cruelty of which the
  <i>fellaheen</i> are capable. Like their prototypes of Egypt the Palestinians
  have such a heritage of oppression to look back on that their actions are
  simply a matter of mood.</p>

  <p>They smolder, as it were, in childlike harmlessness for periods whose
  probably duration no psychologist can guess; and burst out into senseless,
  superstitious fury without any apparent cause. Fear they understand always;
  fair treatment never, having no education in it. Jim would be about as safe
  in their hands as among sheep or wolves, whichever mood was uppermost.</p>

  <p>It was probably intuition that held Catesby&rsquo;s hand. Narayan Singh
  was all for action&mdash;for storming the door and holding up the crowd
  within at pistol- point, his one obsession being that order given him
  half-jokingly by Colonel Goodenough to bring Jim back to Jerusalem alive. He
  snarled between his teeth at Catesby, urging force, and laughing. It is a bad
  sign when a Sikh does that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; Catesby ordered him.</p>

  <p>Having to control the other did him good. He realized almost for the first
  time how the court martial hanging over his head had lowered his own opinion
  of himself to a degree that the Sikh&rsquo;s more subtly receptive mind had
  found contagious. He braced himself deliberately.</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had almost unconsciously admitted to the rule that, being
  technically under arrest, he was technically void of the right to command.
  Now he fell back on the racial issue. Right or wrong, the white man has his
  place above the black, and above all the grades of color whether ebony or
  yellow, Aryan, Mongol or Ethiopian.</p>

  <p>Narayan Singh recognized the change. The world being what it is, a product
  of history, improving only gradually, men still like leaders; and the braver
  and more self-disciplined the man the less he appreciates a leader in whose
  face he may sneer with impunity.</p>

  <p>There was absolutely nothing menial about Narayan Singh; he was a high-
  chinned man, who would polish his officer&rsquo;s boots for pride in the
  well-groomed officer. But the officer good enough to have his harness cleaned
  by him and lead him must know his own mind. He would rather be told to hold
  his tongue by a mistaken strong man than be allowed his own way by a
  weakling. If it were not so, there would be no leaders and no led.</p>

  <p>Having made up his mind to await the event and shoulder the full
  responsibility, Catesby scratched himself philosophically. He was no longer a
  victim, nor could the fact that he was lousy lower his self-respect. Whatever
  he had done rightly hitherto that night was due to intuition and old habits
  of thinking that survive under imposed disgrace, making it impossible for a
  true man to become untrue, or a leader incapable of leading, except
  gradually, step by step.</p>

  <p>Now it was as if a cloud of depression vanished. He did thenceforward what
  he consciously chose to do, captain of his own soul and master of his
  destiny. Even Suliman, waking drowsily, sensed the difference.</p>

  <p>They did not wait very long. The door opened again and the donkey came
  forth first, loaded so heavily that it could barely stagger and showing its
  teeth because of the biting tightness of the cords that kept the load in
  place.</p>

  <p>Over it all like a Joseph&rsquo;s coat of many colors they had tied the
  patchwork quilt, knotting it under the animal&rsquo;s belly; the suggestion
  that conveyed, whether it was intentional or not&mdash;you can&rsquo;t ever
  gage the <i>fellaheen&rsquo;s</i> simplicity or artfulness&mdash;was that
  they were honest villagers removing their household goods. Only a very
  suspicious observer would have balked at their having no women with them to
  carry the heaviest burdens.</p>

  <p>The men filed out one by one after the donkey, each with a heavier load
  than he took in with him, but using what he had brought to cover or contain
  what he had come for&mdash;sacks&mdash;baskets&mdash;mats and an old
  tarpaulin knotted by the corners and carried between two men. The only
  remarkable difference was that whereas twelve men had entered, thirteen now
  came out, and there remained at least one inside to lock the door after
  them.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth man looked cleaner than the rest, and carried no bundle.
  Also his right wrist was raw and seemed painful; and when he rubbed it with
  the other hand a bright red weal became visible on the left wrist too.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Suliman leaped to his feet. Catesby clapped a hand on his mouth
  and dragged him down again only in the nick of time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, you little&mdash;!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Yes, I
  know it&rsquo;s Jimgrim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He knew exactly what to do now; needed no advice or urging from Narayan
  Singh. He waiting only until he could speak without risk of the twelve men
  hearing him. There was not the slightest need to hurry. He let them go a
  hundred yards and disappear beyond the ruined village wall before he gave an
  order. Then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Narayan Singh, you wait here and watch the door. If anyone comes
  out, arrest him. If anyone else goes in, all right; wait and watch. But in
  that case don&rsquo;t let anyone out on any terms; drive &rsquo;em back with
  your pistol; shoot if you must, but hold &rsquo;em in there somehow until
  help comes. If nothing happens don&rsquo;t show yourself. Do you
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Malum, sahib.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now Suliman&mdash;how long is it since you begged? Have you
  forgotten? Off with your boots&mdash;socks too&mdash;leave &rsquo;em here.
  You&rsquo;re dirty enough, Lord knows. Better leave your head-gear too. Tear
  your pants a bit; you&rsquo;re too well cared for to look plausible. Now some
  more dust in your hair. You&rsquo;ll do.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Follow now, and beg from Jimgrim. Don&rsquo;t look back at me, and
  don&rsquo;t take no for an answer. If they turn and beat you, stick to them.
  Pretend you&rsquo;re so hungry that you don&rsquo;t mind being hurt. Cut
  along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He lifted the youngster out of the dark hole and pitched him on to his
  feet outside. A moment later he followed as far as the gap in the wall. From
  that point he could watch what happened without any risk of being seen.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The missionaries and police know best what perfectly
  consummate actors Arab children are. Their elders have grown set in the
  accepted ways, so that a grown man or woman seldom varies from a given
  method; usually the people of one village thieve and lie to a pattern, and
  are all at sea when anyone gets acquainted with their habit.</p>

  <p>But the children are less conservative, until the years bring on that
  eastern intellectual inertia that is partly due to Koran teaching and partly
  to polygamy. Suliman had lost none of his natural alertness yet, and he had
  not been long enough in Jim&rsquo;s control to lose delight in mischief for
  the sake of lawlessness.</p>

  <p>So he accepted that part perfectly. Running until he was
  breathless&mdash;fingering the sweat into the corners of his eyes until it
  looked like tears&mdash;plucking grass as he ran, to chew and make the
  corners of his mouth filthy with green slime, he overtook the procession and
  begged alms in the name of Allah.</p>

  <p>Nor did he go to Jim first, but singled out the owner of the donkey; for
  the beggar&rsquo;s principle is to flatter with first attention whoever had
  most in view of this world&rsquo;s goods, thus sometimes stirring a
  ridiculous unconscious sense of rivalry. Human nature is absurd stuff, or the
  beggars would all be at work producing.</p>

  <p>Clearly those twelve men were in no mood to be generous. They cursed the
  boy as he approached them one by one; and when he would not go, but clung to
  them like one of those persistent Palestinian flies, bleating his parrot-cry
  of hunger with the same indifference to &ldquo;<i>imshi!</i>&rdquo;
  (&ldquo;Clear out!&rdquo;) that the flies show to an angry hand, they picked
  up clods to heave at him. But he dodged those, cursed the throwers as a
  matter or etiquette, and came back with the same persistence.</p>

  <p>If the thirteenth man recognized him he gave no sign of it; and Suliman
  seemed to consider him not worth an effort, judging him with the
  beggar&rsquo;s rule in mind as a <i>maskin</i> (poor man) because he walked
  last. It would have been an insult to the rest and rank bad form, clods
  notwithstanding, to have begged from him before giving the men ahead first
  chance to show their quality.</p>

  <p>So when he did at last approach Jim and cling to the skirt of his
  <i>abyi</i> nobody suspected old acquaintance. Jim told him gruffly to
  &ldquo;<i>imshi</i>,&rdquo; like the rest of them, although one corner of his
  mouth quivered slightly in the faint beginnings of a smile. He might as well
  have tried to &ldquo;<i>imshi</i>&rdquo; the weather. Suliman clung on, and
  begged like an old hand at the game. The East believes in importunity and
  sets as high a value on reiteration as do the advertisers of the West.</p>

  <p>The clod-throwing ceased because, unlike the curses that did not cease,
  one could not throw them any longer without hitting Jim. So Jim had to pause
  a minute to shake the persistent little nuisance off. And as most of the
  other twelve were shouting coarse obscenities, that gave him a chance to
  whisper without being overhead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get away, you little&mdash;!&rdquo; Then, in <i>sotto
  voce</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Captain Catesby?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is in sight. Oh, in the name of Allah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let Allah feed you! (<i>Follow me then.</i>) Go and scavenge. Go
  and steal. Am I God that I should feed you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bleating piteously, and shedding tears that would have made the fabulous
  weeping crocodile look like a very poor actor indeed, Suliman turned aside to
  squat by the side of what had once been a cart-road but had grown to a mere
  track since bombardment wiped the village out. But he did not stay in that
  position much longer than was needed to be out of range of missiles.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The normal daylight activity of camp and town was under way.
  Bugles were blowing. Guards had been relieved. Long strings of mules and
  horses were being led to water at the troughs. Engines were moving in the
  station yard, and strings of Egyptian laborers were slouching sullenly to
  work in the railroad sheds. Donkeys, women and other beasts of burden were
  emerging from the town, where the muezzin had long since finished wailing his
  injunction to the four winds.</p>

  <p>One cartload of merchandise was already on its way from railway to town,
  and the kites were patrolling overhead on the watch for offal and remains.
  Suliman had a perfect right to head for the town, too, if he saw fit.</p>

  <p>So had Catesby, looking like any other shiftless Arab mediating breakfast.
  He strolled along the cart track leisurely with his head down, imitating the
  measured native gait that looks so dignified but oftener than not means
  merely pride in laziness.</p>

  <p>As he walked, fingering the pistol under his heavy brown cloak, he began
  wondering just how much the night&rsquo;s work had accomplished in the matter
  between Jenkins and himself. Adding it all up he could not make the total
  come to anything at all.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he laughed, though. There was a hundred-piaster bank-note taken
  from a dead man! But Narayan Singh had found that, and if the real ownership
  should never be established no doubt it would be awarded to the Sikh. He took
  out the crumpled note and examined it, taking care to keep Suliman in
  sight.</p>

  <p>He was not at all expert in Arabic, but presently he whistled, for he
  could spell out the thin, cramped, right-to-left writing when he took the
  time. An Arab writing with a fine pen can condense a deal of information on a
  half- sheet of ordinary notepaper.</p>

  <p>The strip that fastened the halves of the note together was of generous
  proportions; it had been cut off with scissors, and looked like the lower
  third of a half-sheet. The gum used was very ordinary office paste, with the
  result that one corner had come loose and curled upward, betraying writing on
  both sides.</p>

  <p>And because of the fact that Arabs write from right to left and, like some
  careless Westerners, reverse the sheet by turning it end over end, the name
  of the man to whom the document had originally been addressed and of the man
  who wrote it were both on the cut-off strip of paper. The fist
  name&mdash;that on the gummed side&mdash;was Brigadier-General Jenkins. The
  other name was &ldquo;your honor&rsquo;s humble servant, Ibrahim
  Charkas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Having spelled out the information, Catesby returned the note to his
  pocket and hurried forward, for Suliman was just entering the town street. He
  was not going to be fool enough to trust Suliman with the hundred piasters to
  pass along to Jim, having considerable less than Jim&rsquo;s high opinion of
  the boy. That was reciprocated.</p>

  <p>Catesby&rsquo;s specialty was Sikhs. Being an Arab, Suliman&rsquo;s gift
  lay in personal devotion to whoever fed, clothed and favored him. It is not a
  bad gift, that personal loyalty, but there is nothing in it of the
  Sikh&rsquo;s wider idealism that attaches him to persons only because those
  persons stand for honorable service. Catesby lacked Jim&rsquo;s ability,
  which is wholly American, to ferret out the strong points of any breed
  whatever and play those sky-high.</p>

  <p>The result was unfortunate. Suliman followed the party of thirteen to a
  small shed that stood beside a big one near the farther limit of the town.
  Into that they disappeared, donkey and all.</p>

  <p>Suliman lurked in the doorway a hundred yards off, and Catesby watched him
  from a point of vantage behind the awning of a fruit-seller&rsquo;s shop.
  From where he stood he could read the name of the Zionist Commission on the
  door of the big shed.</p>

  <p>At the end of about twenty minutes the donkey and the thirteen men
  emerged, Jim last again. The twelve went about their business separate ways,
  but Jim sat down to warm himself, Arab-fashion, in the early sun and lighted
  a cigarette.</p>

  <p>When the last of the twelve was out of sight Suliman approached Jim with
  the beggar&rsquo;s whine again. They talked for about two minutes, and a coin
  changed hands for appearance&rsquo;s sake. Then Suliman came up-street to beg
  from Catesby. There was no one to overhear them&mdash;no need to beat about
  the bush.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimgrim says you are to go back to Narayan Singh and tell him not
  to kill the <i>iblis</i>, who is in that place he is watching. He says you
  should stay with Narayan Singh, so that when Jimgrim wants you he can find
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now if a Sikh had brought that message Catesby would have
  accepted it without demur. Moreover, he would have given that hundred-piaster
  note to a Sikh to give to Jim. But the eight-year-old Arab was different.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back and say I have something for him. Ask him whether I shall
  go to him, or will he come to me. Say it&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me whatever it is. He told me to come back to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do as I say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There followed a considerable waste of time. Suliman did not dare to go
  running back with the message, knowing well enough that inquisitive observers
  might draw conclusions. He had the practical common sense to enter a shop and
  buy two native cigarettes &ldquo;for the <i>khawaja</i> sitting yonder in the
  sun,&rdquo; as he was careful to explain.</p>

  <p>The shopman was inquisitive, and had to be lied to <i>in extenso</i>,
  which took up more time. Finally Jim received the cigarettes and returned one
  to the messenger as gratuity. Thanks to Suliman there was nothing to call for
  comment.</p>

  <p>But Jim had to sit and smoke the cigarette in order to complete the
  innocent picture, and it was several minutes before he strolled up the street
  to where Catesby waiting and went through the forms of pleased surprise and
  the lengthy Arab greeting of an unexpected friend. After that they strolled
  side by side, very slowly as befitted Arabs in the circumstances, and that
  entailed further delay.</p>

  <p>Catesby gave him the hundred-piaster note. Jim examined it and whistled
  softly&mdash;a thing no Arab ever does; but the revelation startled him, and
  there was no one to overhear. Catesby explained briefly how he came by it;
  and then they went through the formula of leave-taking for the benefit of
  onlookers, which consumed another minute or two.</p>

  <p>At last, however, Catesby went off alone to share Narayan Singh&rsquo;s
  vigil, and took his time on the way because no Arab ever hurries if that can
  possibly be helped. So it was twenty minutes more before he reached the
  deserted village and another five minutes after than before he discovered
  Narayan Singh.</p>

  <p>The Sikh was lying in a dead man&rsquo;s tortured posture on the ground,
  and just beginning to recover consciousness. A stone the size of a coconut
  lay beside his head. It was ten more minutes before Catesby could get a word
  out of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The door opened, <i>sahib</i>, and the <i>iblis</i> showed his
  head. I ordered him in again. He shut the door, and I watched it. A few
  minutes after that he showed himself over the top of the wall, and I, having
  orders not to shoot him, merely observed. Then he threw three stones at me,
  and the third one struck my head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long ago did this happen? Soon after I left?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay. A long time after you left. I have been stunned&mdash;how
  should I know how long? But I think it happened just a very little while
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby tried the door, but it was locked. So he set a charred beam
  against the wall and climbed, to peer in through the window. As far as he
  could see the place was empty; and presently, scouting about, he found the
  imprints of two enormous naked feet in the dust. They were pointed away from
  the door, and he hardly could doubt they were those of the escaping
  <i>iblis</i>.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Acting on information
  received.&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">ALL the ambitious men and women of history have come to
  grief finally by walking straight ahead into the same old simple trap. It is
  painted differently for different men, and the bait is big or little as the
  case may be. The goads that made them restless, so that they move when the
  trap is ready instead of staying still are pretty much the same in most
  cases; and, just as in the case of the tiger in his prime, there are usually
  jackals giving bad advice.</p>

  <p>Jenkins was no exception. Taking advantage of the long-drawn interim
  between the armistice and the issuing of mandates, he had made of that camp
  at Ludd a very breeding-ground of politics.</p>

  <p>As a fighter he had obtained distinction by stealing the credit for other
  men&rsquo;s successes for himself and by contriving to blame others for his
  failures. And he had no use for credit except as a means for making profit.
  So of course he had jackals tugging his heels impatiently, men who admired
  his disrespect for all the accepted rules of fair play and who would have
  outdone his methods if they had dared. One of them was Captain Aloysius
  Ticknor.</p>

  <p>Ticknor likewise had ambitions, and was perfectly ready to sacrifice
  Jenkins at any moment for their attainment. But for the present Ticknor saw
  more immediate profit in working for his chief&rsquo;s advancement, like a
  man who rears a ladder to climb by, meaning to kick it down afterward or
  leave it leaning, just as suits him.</p>

  <p>They were not in each other&rsquo;s secrets, because Jenkins never trusted
  anyone if he could help it. He preferred to make hints and innuendoes, on the
  strength of which a subordinate made good, then Jenkins got the credit; if
  the subordinate failed there was only one more victim on the long list of
  ruined youngsters &ldquo;Jinks&rdquo; had left behind him.</p>

  <p>So Aloysius Ticknor, who would lose money to Jenkins at cards, for
  instance, and generally win it back with something added from junior
  subalterns, was exactly in the position of a jackal craving meat who did not
  know the tiger&rsquo;s real intentions although sure of the tiger&rsquo;s
  hunger. Jackal fashion he diagnosed the brigadier&rsquo;s nervous
  restlessness and offered the sort of advice he felt sure would be
  acceptable.</p>

  <p>He was another pro-Arab, anti-Zionist, of course. You had to be that if
  you hoped to stay in Jenkins&rsquo; good books for a minute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you send me into town, sir, to look things
  over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Might fall foul of the provost-marshal,&rdquo; Jenkins answered.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of those stuffy shits who resent what they call
  interference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you show him up as incompetent by finding a cache of rifles
  under his very nose&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Ticknor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m! Be a joke, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Not difficult either. The
  fool has his eye on Arabs all the time. There isn&rsquo;t an Arab store or
  dwelling that he hasn&rsquo;t searched. If the Arabs had one rifle hidden
  he&rsquo;d have found it. He seems to think Jews are gentle angels who
  wouldn&rsquo;t do anything secretive if you paid them money for
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose I look the Zionist quarters over, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give you orders over the
  provost-marshal&rsquo;s head, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re driving at.
  If you can think of another excuse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, easily. You remember those three condemned huts? They&rsquo;re
  to be advertised for sale. I could go and inquire whether the Zionists would
  like to have them&mdash;promise nothing, of course, but offer to use
  influence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you might do that. But be sure you promise nothing. I
  shan&rsquo;t need you this morning. You can go for a stroll if you
  like,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Buy yourself some souvenirs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he made a note in his diary there and then that he had given Ticknor
  personal leave of absence. He did it in pencil to be inked in later, so that
  he might change &ldquo;personal&rdquo; to &ldquo;particular&rdquo; if he
  should see fit.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">So Captain Aloysius Ticknor, with nice red tables on his
  collar and the glow of astuteness radiating from him till he looked like
  light personified, started out with two dogs at his heels, swinging his
  service cane. Half an hour later, sweating rather more than he liked, because
  it offset his studied air of omniscient aloofness, he arrived in front of the
  Zionist store-shed on the far end of the town.</p>

  <p>The door was locked, but a short, broad-shouldered, sweaty little Jew in
  black New York-made pants and a gray shirt was busy nailing scrap tin over a
  broken window-pane.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you in charge here?&rdquo; Ticknor asked him.</p>

  <p>The Jew laid down the hammer and eyed his suspiciously. It was no more
  than hereditary mistrust of uniform because officialdom has always meant
  oppression for the Jew; but it was enough in itself to stir the lees of
  Ticknor&rsquo;s racial arrogance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you answer? I asked, are you in charge here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In charge of this hammer, yes. It is not my hammer. I make
  repairs&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the key of the place?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open the door then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Jew did not cringe, having left that uningratiating voice behind him
  in Moscow when he emigrated to America, but he obeyed with alacrity that
  might have disarmed Ticknor&rsquo;s suspicion. But Ticknor was feeling
  jubilant. He had come prepared to hide his real mission under a cloak of
  friendly interest and was naturally relieved to find that he could lay aside
  the hypocrisy. There might have been someone there who would have resented
  intrusion&mdash;some Zionist official on his dignity; and of all things in
  the world that he hated, he worst was having to be polite to people he
  disliked.</p>

  <p>He walked straight into the great musty-smelling shed the instant the door
  opened, seeing in imagination a sort of pirates&rsquo; stronghold piled full
  of contraband. But when his eyes grew used to the dim light he saw only very
  ordinary stores&mdash;spare hospital supplies, flour in barrels, clothing in
  bundles, tar, tools and calico in bales&mdash;extremely disappointing.</p>

  <p>However, Jews are secretive and cunning. Doubtless there were rifles
  hidden in the bales&mdash;ammunition in the barrels. He nosed about all over
  the place, pushing things aside to see what lay behind or underneath them.
  Presently he found a bale that had been opened and wired up again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here, you!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Here, open
  this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The overstepped the limit of forbearance even of the individual in black
  pants. He came in, scratched the back of his head, rubbed his nose and went
  through the motions with his other hand suggestive of deference and blunt
  refusal that fought one with the other. A slight shrug of the shoulders
  indication absence of responsibility; but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you hear me? Open it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The answer aroused suspicion to the danger-point. Where prejudice is
  strong judgment is always weak. Ticknor set to work to do the job himself,
  twisting at the wires with impatient fingers under the eyes of the bewildered
  Jew. He had got one wire undone when someone else darkened the doorway.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ticknor turned impatiently to see a Jew of another type altogether
  watching him from the door through gold-rimmed pince-nez&mdash;the very man
  he did not want to meet that morning, but for whose benefit he had come
  prepared with the plausible excuse about the condemned huts. Aaronsohn was
  one of the intellectuals, a man of considerable private means, journalist and
  poet, who had thrown his whole fortune and energy into the Zionist
  movement.</p>

  <p>Caught in the act of trespass without authority, and with dust clinging to
  the sweat on his face and neck, he felt at a disadvantage that Aaronsohn
  appreciated fully. There seemed nothing for it but to bluff the thing
  through.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Acting on information received,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
  searching for stolen Government property.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Acting on circumstantial evidence, I am now on my way to General
  Anthony to lodge a complaint against you,&rdquo; Aaronsohn answered with a
  grim smile. &ldquo;But perhaps you have something in writing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No need of it,&rdquo; Ticknor answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? We will see about that. Perhaps I had better see first what
  damage you have done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better open that bale and satisfy me
  what&rsquo;s inside it,&rdquo; sneered Ticknor.</p>

  <p>Aaronsohn obliged him. And because the bale stood wedged between others,
  which made it awkward to unbind, he and the man in black pants dragged it out
  to the middle of the floor between them. There proved to be nothing in it but
  gray flannel shirts, each marked at the neck with the name of a New York
  manufacturer.</p>

  <p>Aaronsohn chose to be sarcastic, twenty-five years&rsquo; use of an acid
  pen having left that habit on the surface.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will leave you in charge of the plunder,&rdquo; he said, smiling
  with thin lips. &ldquo;Stay here, and let me ask General Anthony to send you
  assistance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Conscious of the strength of his position, and too old a hand at reprisals
  to waste invective on a man he could annihilate by much more concrete means,
  he walked straight out at that, leaving the door wide open.</p>

  <p>Ticknor swore under his breath, reviewing his own position without getting
  any comfort from it. He knew he might depend on Jenkins to let him down
  completely, for he was under no delusion as to the brigadier&rsquo;s method
  of self- preservation.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him presently that his one meager chance lay in still
  discovering what he came to find. It might be after all that
  Aaronsohn&rsquo;s indignation was a well-acted bluff.</p>

  <p>What had brought the Jew there at that critical moment? What could
  possibly have brought him there but nervousness? What could have sent him
  hurrying off to Anthony but the hope of stopping the search before the secret
  was uncovered.</p>

  <p>Thinking thus, his eye fell on the twelve square feet of floor where the
  bale had stood before they dragged it clear. He saw hinges&mdash;the
  butt-ends of long strap hinges passing under the next bale on the left.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s under the floor?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the man in black pants.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drag that next bale away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He helped him do it, and uncovered a trapdoor.</p>

  <p>Hope ran ace-high again. He was the same alert, astute Aloysius Ticknor
  who had started forth that morning dreaming of high politics. Even his two
  dogs, sniffing for rats in a corner, seemed to appreciate the change, for
  they left their pressing business to come and wag their tails at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open her up!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

  <p>Might as well be broke for burglary as trespass. Besides, all successful
  men take chances.</p>

  <p>But the trapdoor would not raise. It was fastened down with one long nail
  driven in to the head. The man in black pants produced a crowbar from a
  corner and lent the strength of his stocky shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember that in your favor,&rdquo; said Ticknor, not
  supposing that the Jew&rsquo;s readiness to help might be due to anything but
  the instinct of self- preservation.</p>

  <p>Some men can convince themselves of anything they want to believe. Ticknor
  would have betted a year&rsquo;s pay that minute on there being loot under
  the floor, and another year&rsquo;s pay on top of that that both Aaronsohn
  and this man knew it.</p>

  <p>So he was not surprised, he was merely elated and self-complacent when the
  nail came splintering out of the wood and the door creaked back at last. He
  did not stop to consider why the hinges should have yielded so reluctantly,
  or to study the rust on the ancient nail. There was too much down below to
  interest him&mdash;rifles, cartridges, revolvers, bayonets&mdash;the plunder
  of months from Ludd encampment!</p>

  <p>That was a minute of triumph, worth ten times the sting of
  Aaronsohn&rsquo;s sarcastic insolence. Lord, wouldn&rsquo;t Jenkins be
  pleased! And think of Aaronsohn&rsquo;s chagrin! And the
  provost-marshal&rsquo;s, who had had his eye well wiped!</p>

  <p>He jumped down into the cellar, struck a match and looked about him, but
  did not trouble to go as far as the end wall because there was hardly
  headroom and he had to stoop. Beside there might be snakes and vermin. So he
  did not notice a door at the end, communicating with the smaller shed next
  door, nor see the print of footsteps leading from it.</p>

  <p>He climbed out again, sweating and dusty but almost busting with pleasure
  at his good luck. The Jew in black pants, peering down into the hole beside
  him, felt it incumbent to translate his thoughts into speech that might be
  understood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I never! Those Arabs, mister, there is nothing they stop at!
  As a snake in the grass so is an Arab!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lies about Arabs won&rsquo;t help you, my lad! You&rsquo;d better
  stay here. Understand me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure I stay here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ticknor laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a strange race. I never saw such perfectly acted
  conscious innocence. Talk of Chinamen&mdash;they&rsquo;re not in it with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went to the door and looked up and down the street, hoping to catch
  sight of a soldier or policeman&mdash;anyone at all who might be sent to
  bring the provost-marshal&rsquo;s men; or better yet, sent running with a
  note to Jenkins.</p>

  <p>There was no one in uniform in sight. He scribbled a note on the back of a
  private letter, replaced it in its envelope, readdressed it to the brigadier,
  contrived to seal it after a fashion by relicking the old gum, and beckoned a
  small boy who was sitting smoking outside a shop on the opposite side of the
  street fifty yards away.</p>

  <p>Preferring not to advertise his find too widely for the moment, he judge
  it better to do his talking inside the building. So the small boy got a good
  view of the trapdoor, and a glimpse of what lay underneath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen. Do you know General Jenkins?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The small boy nodded. There were few things he ever forgot, once he had
  rubbed acquaintance with them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know how to find him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take this letter to him, but don&rsquo;t show it to anybody else.
  If you come back quickly with an answer I&rsquo;ll give you five
  piasters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bribe was enormous. The small boy took the envelope and started off at
  a run. Ticknor returned to the trapdoor to gloat over his discovery and smoke
  a cigarette of triumph.</p>

  <p>So again he missed something that might have given him thought. The boy
  stopped at the shop near which he had been sitting, and called through the
  open door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Jimgrim!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A man in Arab costume came and stood in the shadow between the door-
  posts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over there in the big shed there is a trapdoor. It is open.
  Underneath are rifles. An officer gave me this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is it for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;General Jenkins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Run with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suliman sat and pulled his boots off, for they were a concession to
  convention, not adjunct to speed. Stringing them around his neck by the laces
  he set off as fast as youth would let him.</p>

  <p>Jimgrim turned back into the shop, smiling with tired eyes, to resume his
  conversation with a real Arab where it had broken off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Ibrahim Charkas. Let&rsquo;s have that over again. No lies
  this time or I&rsquo;ll wring your neck.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;There is money...take it and go
  away.&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN Jim received the hundred-piaster note from Suliman he
  went at once into Mahommed Kaftar&rsquo;s coffee-shop and steamed it over the
  kettle until it fell into the original three pieces&mdash;two ragged halves
  and a strip of gummed paper. Then he drank coffee leisurely until the paper
  dried, turning it over on his knee and chuckling to himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t say a word against Jenkins&mdash;um-m-m!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Kettle&rsquo;s and General Anthony&rsquo;s injunction began to
  fit, still vaguely, into something suggestive of strategy based on
  information.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give a rascal rope enough and he&rsquo;s sure to hang
  himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But one must take precautions lest he trip too many others with the rope
  before the end comes. He made up his mind to see Ibrahim Charkas at once, not
  that there would be any obvious advantage to the community in saving that
  evasive rascal from the consequence of dallying with Jinks&rsquo; spider web;
  but he did have instructions to discover who stole that TNT, and if one thing
  should lead to another, and that to Jinks&rsquo; downfall, he would still be
  obeying orders.</p>

  <p>Ibrahim Charkas ran one of those nondescript Arab stores in which
  everything was sold from sewing thread to tinned biscuits and souvenir
  photographs. He had even sold whisky until the provost-marshal interfered.
  Loss of the surreptitious liquor trade had cost him the custom of Sikhs and
  Gurkhas in addition to a staggering fine, so that business was not what it
  used to be and the stock in trade looked the part.</p>

  <p>Dogged at a little distance by Suliman, who would not have traded his
  employment just then for a promise of paradise, Jim strolled up-street
  looking like an Arab whose wives were attending to business for him, lord of
  the earth and of leisure. There were plenty of other Arabs in the street and
  he had to be careful, but he watched his chance outside Charkas&rsquo; shop
  to toss Suliman a coin in which to buy breakfast and tell him to wait until
  call. Then he went in ostensibly for cigarettes.</p>

  <p>Charkas came out obsequiously from a little room in the rear to greet him,
  for the day was past when the store would support an assistant, except for a
  mere fetch-and-carry nonentity, who could hardly be trusted to sweep the
  place out least he steal whatever he could reach. Just then the nonentity was
  away on some kind of errand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Shu bitrid, ya khawaja?</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;What do you want,
  sir?&rdquo;)</p>

  <p>Jim countered in English, and opened with his heaviest gun, laying down
  the two portions of the bank-note on a table at the back of the shop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just take a look at those. When did you see them last?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charkas did not seem to know which to be surprised at more&mdash;the
  question or being addressed in English.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you that prefer a foreign language to your own?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None of your business! This is your business&mdash;this
  note&mdash;it&rsquo;s important&mdash;when did you see it last?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How should I know? I never saw it. I don&rsquo;t accept torn
  money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look again. It was pasted together when you saw it last. I know
  where you had it from, but how did you get rid of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To whom should I pay a hundred piasters? Tee-hee-hee! Absurd! The
  business of this store is no longer that much in a week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever see this?&rdquo; Jim asked him, turning over the strip
  of paper in both hands so as to show first the signature of Charkas on one
  side and then Jenkins&rsquo; name on the other. &ldquo;It came of the back of
  that note.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charkas began to look like a cornered rat. The pupils of his eyes became
  pin-points, and narrow teeth showed prominently between his thin, parted
  lips. He made a quick motion with his hand, but Jim was quicker and seized
  him by both arms. Jim put his foot on it, and then picked up the strip of
  paper he had had to let fall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better not try to make a hanging matter of it. Better use your
  head. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to make sense out of this writing. It&rsquo;s a
  letter from you to General Jenkins describing what certain men are doing,
  what they intend to do, and stating why you need more money. Jenkins gave you
  that hundred piasters. What did you do with it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There naturally flashed across Charkas&rsquo; mind his recent interview
  with Jenkins, of which Jim knew nothing, any more that Jim knew that the man
  from whom the hundred-piaster note had been taken did not come by it from
  someone else, who in turn might have had it from a third man. Charkas decided
  that Jenkins must have betrayed him, more than making good the threat not
  come to his aid if needed. But he was still cautious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>

  <p>In strategy there is no sounder rule that to follow up one surprise with
  another one, the second if possible more unexpected than the first. The first
  one destroys confidence; the second promotes hysteria.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man who found in Jerusalem the TNT that was stolen from
  the railway here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charkas turned to look about wildly for a weapon. Swift murder and sudden
  flight were all he could think of. He looked twice longingly toward a desk in
  the dingy back office.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; he said mysteriously.</p>

  <p>Jim kicked the knife into the corner and followed him so quickly that he
  reached the desk abreast of him. Their hands closed on the lid
  simultaneously. Jim&rsquo;s right hand forced Charkas into a chair. With his
  left he raised the lid.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thought so!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was a revolver and a dagger with a wavy edge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which would you have used? Um-m-m! I guess you&rsquo;re scared
  enough to have fired and alarmed the town. Let&rsquo;s see what else is in
  here&mdash;sit still, now! Don&rsquo;t move or I&rsquo;ll get a rope out of
  the store and tie you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put his foot on the Arab&rsquo;s lap to keep him from bolting while he
  searched through a litter of papers at random. They were mostly bills,
  receipts and private letters. Nothing of obvious importance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is money at the back,&rdquo; said Charkas. &ldquo;Take it and
  go away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim whistled. Charkas shuddered. There is nothing in the world some Arabs
  hate so much as that. They say only the devil whistles. One can never know
  beforehand for certain, of course, but Charkas was hardly the kind of man one
  would expect to believe in that superstition.</p>

  <p>Adding the shudder to the offer of the bribe; Jim drew a false conclusion
  that led nevertheless to discovery. Supposing that Charkas&rsquo; anxiety was
  for the papers in the desk, he went on searching; whereas the man actually
  was past fear on that account, thinking now of nothing but how to escape; and
  his nerves were in such a state that the whistle tortured him.</p>

  <p>Jim found the money, glanced at it and tossed it aside. Then he turned
  over the papers again, stacking them one on top of the other, and presently
  whistled again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What in thunder did you keep this for?&rdquo; he asked, removing
  his foot from Charkas&rsquo; lap as he turned his back to the desk and
  laughed. &ldquo;Are you the ringleader of thieves here, and keep the proof of
  it to show like a Government certificate?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly a fragment of Charkas&rsquo; native wit returned and he
  remembered why he had kept it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is the memorandum informing General Jenkins that two tons of
  TNT were in a truck in the siding.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I see. Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;General Jenkins gave it to me&mdash;into my hand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If Jenkins proposed to betray him, then two could play at that game. All
  the bitterness and venom that the Arab mind inherited from Ishmael and
  cultivated under Turkish rule came to the surface. Revenge looked sweeter at
  that minute than safety. Thoughts of flight vanished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;General Jenkins gave me that hundred-piaster note. He has given me
  other sums from time to time. I will swear to it in court. He has been paying
  me to organize the thieving.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In order to blame it on the Zionists. He hates Zionists. He is pro-
  Arab.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And he gave you that memorandum so that you could steal the
  TNT?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that my men could steal it, yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim tried not to look incredulous. It would take more than Charkas&rsquo;
  word to convince him that Jenkins would be such a fool as that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When did he give it to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the third, I think it was. Yes, on the evening of the
  third.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, because I met the afternoon train and walked up to his office
  afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is dated the third at four o&rsquo;clock. He could only have
  just received it. Was he in the office when you went there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He reached it just ahead of me. The messenger brought the note; he
  signed for it, read it, and handed it to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean he turned away and you stole it off his desk&mdash;now
  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charkas denied that hotly&mdash;swore by the God of his fathers and by
  Mohammed and all the saints in paradise that Jenkins had given him the paper.
  But that was too obviously stupidly untrue. A blundering, fatuous schemer
  Jenkins might be, but not such a simpleton as that. There was proof on that
  slip of paper in Jim&rsquo;s pocket that Jenkins had known a lot about the
  thieving&mdash;probably proof enough to ruin him; but Jim&rsquo;s task was to
  let the brigadier ruin himself. In all likelihood Anthony would refuse to
  listen if he should come with the blackest proof imaginable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all
  in&mdash;d&rsquo;you realize it? You&rsquo;ve only got one
  chance&mdash;king&rsquo;s evidence. Come across with a clean story and
  I&rsquo;ll do my best for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rat instinct for sudden flight crossed the Arab&rsquo;s mind again. He
  rolled his eyes toward the door secretively, but Jim saw that and put his
  foot back on the man&rsquo;s lap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay put!&rdquo; he laughed, shoving him once or twice hard in the
  stomach. &ldquo;Come on, spill the story. Who&rsquo;s the
  <i>iblis</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charkas looked relieved. He even chuckled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is an Egyptian. I do not know his name, but he is a great
  charlatan, who left Egypt because of the police. Now he is very much
  disturbed&mdash;tee-hee-hee! He is expert at encouraging thieves. He gives
  them magic against bullets&mdash;tee-hee-hee!&mdash;and he demands two-thirds
  of all the plunder in return.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he cannot dispose of his share of the plunder without
  assistance; and he does not know where the men who come for it have hidden
  it. Tee-hee! He is very much exercised.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I happen to know where they have hidden it,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>Charkas snickered scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you. How could you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was with the <i>iblis</i> most of last night, and I went with the
  men who came at dawn to hide the stuff away. The <i>iblis</i> is waiting for
  me now to come back and tell him where they hid it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charkas threw his hands up in despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must be a bigger devil than the <i>iblis</i>
  himself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe. We&rsquo;ll discuss that later if you like. The point is,
  are you going to come across, or would you rather I&rsquo;d arrest you now
  and take you straight to Jenkins?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The names of all your men. Here&rsquo;s a pencil. Here&rsquo;s
  paper. Write them down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charkas hesitated for a moment, then tried to wet the pencil on his dry
  lips and obeyed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will make a full confession because you have promised I shall
  escape imprisonment by doing so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim laughed again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dare say your sentence will be cut in half,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best you can hope for. You can withdraw all
  you&rsquo;ve said if you like, plead not guilty and take the
  consequences.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, no! I will confess and plead guilty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was at this point that Suliman called out through the doorway and Jim
  went out to speak with him, first pocketing the Arab&rsquo;s dagger and
  revolver, but forgetting the knife he had kicked into a corner. Charkas had
  not forgotten it, but when Jim returned to the inner office he was back in
  the chair again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here is the list of names,&rdquo; he said, offering the sheet of
  paper.</p>

  <p>Jim started to read it. All the light there was came through the office
  door and a dusty glass window set in the partition. He turned to let the
  light fall on the paper, and suddenly sprang backward.</p>

  <p>The knife missed his stomach by a fraction of an inch. The blow was so
  savage that Charkas could not check it; his fist swung three-quarters of a
  circle and drove the knife nearly to the hilt into the wall behind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nice sort of scorpion, aren&rsquo;t you! Leave the knife sticking
  there. Now sit back and tell me your story all over from the
  beginning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This time Charkas was really convinced of helplessness, and beyond that he
  lied about everybody else and tried to present himself as a more or less
  innocent weakling involved in crime unwillingly by Jenkins, told a moderately
  truthful tale.</p>

  <p>By the time he had finished the brigadier himself came clattering down-
  street on horseback, jubilant at the news of Ticknor&rsquo;s discovery. Ten
  minutes of so later a platoon of British Tommies marched up, sweating freely,
  and took charge of the Zionist store-shed. Jenkins rode away again, red-faced
  with triumph, and Ticknor followed him on foot.</p>

  <p>It was not ten minutes after that when Catesby came hurrying in search of
  Jim. He had shed his disguise and was back in uniform; and he had overtaken
  Suliman, who was returning tired and breathless for his five piasters from
  Ticknor. Suliman pointed out the shop door and followed Ticknor back again
  up- street.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad news for you. The <i>iblis</i> pretty nearly brained Narayan
  Singh with a piece of coping-stone, and scooted God knows where. I had to
  take Narayan Singh back to camp to have his head dressed, and the doctor
  ordered him to bed. What are you looking happy about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The prospect of breakfast and sleep. Did you see Jinks?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, looking as pompously pleased as a ripe tomato. The brute
  didn&rsquo;t acknowledge my salute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. Jinks is his sure-enough name, old man. You&rsquo;ll be
  out from under arrest almost before you know it. Too bad about the
  <i>iblis</i>, but we&rsquo;ll get him yet. Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s this
  critter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you understand, Charkas, this officer is going to stay here and
  watch you until the provost-marshal&rsquo;s men come, and you&rsquo;ll go
  with them under arrest. Take my advice and say nothing. Don&rsquo;t talk to
  anyone. Don&rsquo;t answer questions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let General Jenkins say what he pleases and do what he pleases.
  Hold your tongue until you see me again. So long, Catesby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He left the shop and strolled up-street toward the camp as leisurely as if
  the heritage of all Allah were sleeping in his veins. Presently Suliman
  tagged along after him, grinning with contentment for a five-piaster
  note.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Good sunny night to you! Sweet
  dreams!&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">HAVING faced the <i>iblis</i> in the dark and slept at
  frequent intervals afterward, Suliman considered the lid on gambling lifted
  and set forth to stake the five piasters against the capital of certain small
  boys of the lines, in a mysterious card game that did not call for a complete
  pack, and of which only he knew the rules.</p>

  <p>Jim got into uniform, found the provost-marshal and then went straight to
  Jenkins&rsquo; office. The brigadier was radiant and red-faced in the center
  of flattering juniors, pouting his lips as he made little of the
  morning&rsquo;s work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very simple. Obvious to anyone with eyes in his head. I gave
  Ticknor his instructions, and there you are. Oh, hullo, Grim: Wiped your eyes
  for you. Didn&rsquo;t need you after all. I told you we&rsquo;d find Zionists
  at the bottom of this. What have you been doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very little, I&rsquo;m afraid. I arrested Ibrahim Charkas, though,
  this morning. Left him in charge of Captain Catesby until the provost&rsquo;s
  men could come and get him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins changed colors, flushing redder than ever, so that his ears and
  the back of his neck resembled rare roast beef.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Catesby is under arrest himself,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His parole was lifted, sir, to give him opportunity to gather
  evidence in his own case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that. It was my doing. I wanted to give him every chance. I
  signed the order releasing him; but that doesn&rsquo;t give him authority to
  arrest people and hold prisoners. I shall have to look into this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim hoped he would look into it, and held his tongue. Jenkins began to
  grow more obviously nervous every minute. The flatterers only irritated now,
  and he turned on them savagely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are we all loafing here for? Is there nothing to do&mdash;no
  orders? You wait here a minute, Major Grim; I want to speak with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The juniors remembered urgent business suddenly, and left in different
  directions. Jenkins, jerking at his buffalo-horn mustache, turned and faced
  Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did you arrest Charkas for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On his own confession of his part in stealing the TNT.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Um-m-m!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The brigadier paced up and down the narrow room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That this is a full list of the thieves he has been
  employing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins seized the sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent! Excellent! We can seize all these men and they&rsquo;ll
  be implicating one another within ten minutes. But you ought to have brought
  Charkas here to me before the provost interviews him. If this list is correct
  Charkas ought to be treated as a king&rsquo;s witness and released after the
  trail. However, I&rsquo;ll send this list to the provost with my compliments;
  it&rsquo;ll make him wince. Did you get the <i>iblis</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pouff!&rdquo; sneered Jenkins.</p>

  <p>Jim deliberately fed the fires of scorn, judging the man nicely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d get some sleep, sir, and then go after him
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sleep! Sleep! &rsquo;Pon my soul! Is that an American habit, to
  sleep while your hunted man runs? All right, go to sleep then! I&rsquo;ll
  attend to the rest of this myself. Good sunny night to you! Sweet
  dreams!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Jim did not sleep yet a while. He went first to Narayan Singh in the
  great hot hospital marquee. The Sikh was fretting in impotent fury at being
  out of action, lying down because that had been ordered, but tossing like a
  fritter on a pan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am all right, <i>sahib</i>. My head hurts, but that is nothing. I
  was stunned for a few minutes by a stone from the paw of that black ape that
  calls himself an <i>iblis</i>; but it would take ten such stones all striking
  in the same place to make me give up the hunt. Catesby sahib, who is a
  precaution-<i>wallah</i>, ordered me in there and I obeyed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You let me out again, Jimgrim <i>sahib</i>, and turn me loose with
  a rifle and bayonet. I will bring back that <i>iblis</i> for you like a
  beetle on a pin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had seen the doctor&rsquo;s memorandum of the case.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you want to go after him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When was I ever chicken-hearted, Jimgrim <i>sahib</i>, that you ask
  me that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, go to sleep them. When it stands written on your report
  card that you&rsquo;ve had five hours&rsquo; sleep I&rsquo;ll fetch you out
  of here and we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sikh promptly shut his eyes and lay down flat on the cot. But Jim had
  hardly turned his back before he signaled the Jat orderly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the doctor <i>sahib</i> will
  ask if I have slept, in order to write the report of it on a card. You know
  what the answer will be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Always from me a truthful answer. So and so long you were
  sleeping&mdash;so and so long restless&mdash;so and so long
  talkative&mdash;so and so many drinks of water&mdash;temperature this and
  that. I am seeking promotion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Do they promote cripples, these <i>dakitars</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay. A man needs strength to lift great carcasses like
  thine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If that <i>dakitar</i> learns I have not slept for five hours
  straight on end, you will be an orderly too badly crippled for promotion.
  This is my word. I have said it&mdash;I, Narayan Singh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The orderly returned to his stool by the door, grumbling about the trials
  of a man who seeks to rise in his profession, and Narayan Singh, with his
  mind at least quite relieved, dropped off into the land of dreams, from which
  he was awakened at intervals by the sound of Suliman&rsquo;s voice behind the
  tent quarreling with two other urchins about the ever changing rules of
  chance.</p>

  <p>At the end of an hour or two, when all the money in sight had found its
  way into Suliman&rsquo;s pocket, the three boys sat back against the tent to
  smoke stale cigar butts and gossip. It was in that way that Narayan Singh
  picked up some information that he put to good use later on.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Jim meanwhile met Catesby coming into camp ahead of Ibrahim
  Charkas, who was in charge of the provost&rsquo;s men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing for you to do now,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Get conclusive proof of where you were on the afternoon of the third
  between four and five o&rsquo;clock. The buffalo is going to blunder. I can
  see it coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get your proof then, and keep it absolutely to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim still had one small errand before he could go to sleep himself. He
  went to General Anthony&rsquo;s marquee, and found to his delight that
  Jenkins was there ahead of him. The Zionist-journalist Aaronsohn was in there
  too, looking horribly uncomfortable in a thin-lipped, calm and collected way.
  Jenkins was still holding forth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The evidence is all in. I&rsquo;ve asked the provost-marshal to
  exert himself in rounding up that list of Charkas&rsquo; men. Charkas himself
  will swear that he was paid by the Zionists to steal rifles for them. The
  rifles were found in the Zionists&rsquo; store. What more do you
  want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>General Anthony uncrossed his legs and recrossed them, tapping on his desk
  with a pencil. He said nothing&mdash;not at all a rare habit of his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve one thing more to add,&rdquo; said Jenkins. &ldquo;I saw
  Charkas fifteen minutes ago. He tells me Major Grim has found the original
  memorandum from the R.T.O to me about the TNT that was stolen&mdash;found it
  in Charkas&rsquo; desk. Charkas proposes to turn king&rsquo;s witness, and he
  vows he had the memorandum from Captain Catesby, to whom he paid money for
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anthony looked visible distressed. Jim tried hard to do the same.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better cancel that parole
  altogether and order Catesby under close arrest?&rdquo; said Jenkins
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>Butter would not have melted in his mouth. You could tell at a glance how
  he hated to be mixed up, even in a judicial way, with such abominable
  misconduct in an officer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anthony. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;m afraid
  so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took pen and paper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One moment, sir,&rdquo; Jim interposed. &ldquo;May I ask a
  question?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fire away, Grim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not you, sir; General Jenkins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was fire in Jinks&rsquo; eyes, by way of reminder that he who can
  break captains can break majors just as easily. But Jim&rsquo;s first words
  disarmed suspicion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About Charkas. He told me a long-winded story. I didn&rsquo;t write
  it down, but from memory I should say it bears out certain points of which
  you&rsquo;ve just said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jenkins almost purred aloud. This was the handsome way to make amends. He
  there and then forgave Jim even that left-handed apology on the railway-
  station platform.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Charkas told me among other things how he came to know about the
  existence of that railway memorandum. If what he said is true it may help
  cinch the case.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He says you were down on the afternoon of the third; that he
  followed you up, because he wanted to ask some sort of favor; that you and he
  reached your office at about the same time; and that he saw you receive and
  open the memorandum. He says you laid it down for a minute, but he
  didn&rsquo;t have time to more than glance at it. So he formed the idea of
  getting hold of it somehow in order to learn the exact details. Does that
  correspond with your recollection of that afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it does. Yes, I did meet the train that day. Yes, I
  remember Charkas came to the office to bother me about something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About five o&rsquo;clock, he said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must have been almost exactly five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anthony began scribbling on a pad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you definite on that point, General Jenkins?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly. My memory&rsquo;s exact. Charkas must have gone straight
  to Catesby and got the memorandum from him, because I gave Catesby his
  orders&mdash;as I explained at the time when the theft was
  discovered&mdash;within twenty minutes of receiving the
  memorandum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anthony drew out a file of papers from a drawer of his desk, and turned
  them over slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you say in your original complaint against Catesby&mdash;made
  while I was away in Egypt&mdash;that you were not sure of the exact time when
  you gave him the memorandum and orders to take over the TNT.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember now, though. Grim&rsquo;s question brought the facts to
  mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ready to swear to it now at the court
  martial?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. Have Catesby rearrested. Is there anything else,
  Grim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The <i>iblis</i>, sir. I interviewed him last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The deuce you did!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve evidence enough against him to call for his arrest on
  military grounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll sign a warrant. Do you know where he
  is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at the moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure we can convict him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without more ado Anthony began to fill out a regulation form.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better describe him as &lsquo;a person
  unknown&mdash;colored&mdash;believed to be a leper&mdash;accused of plotting
  to loot the military camp.&rsquo; There.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He handed it to Jim. The printed portion was couched in the customary
  legal verbiage intended to convey the meaning without too formal crudity,
  that the prisoner should be caught, brought in and delivered alive or
  dead.</p>

  <p>Jim put it in his pocket and went to his tent to sleep until late
  afternoon. Brigadier-General Jenkins, on the other hand, after restating his
  opinion of the Zionists for Aaronsohn&rsquo;s benefit, marched down to the
  place where they confined civilian prisoners, to see Charkas alone and drill
  him on his part. A very cautious, forehanded brigadier was Albert Jenkins,
  although given to expressing triumph rather sooner than was wise.</p>

  <p>He had the ill taste to laugh aloud on his way back, as he passed Catesby
  in his tent, this time with two armed sentries standing on guard in front of
  it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;The chain&rsquo;s
  complete.&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was growing dark when Jim emerged from his tent feeling
  less at ease than he cared to admit to himself. A note had come from Catesby,
  who was now to all intents and purposes incommunicado, to the effect that
  from five until six on the evening of the third he had been inquiring, at
  Jenkins&rsquo; verbal request, into an accident that had taken place several
  days previously. A civilian had had his leg broken by a gun-wheel, and
  civilian witnesses had been difficult to find; but he had unearthed one, and
  was questioning him at the time when Jenkins pretended he had given the order
  about the TNT. Now he could not find the man again to prove the fact.</p>

  <p>Jim had the note in his hand. As Catesby&rsquo;s next friend he had the
  right to visit him in any circumstances, just as a lawyer may go to his
  client in jail.</p>

  <p>Things looked pretty bad at the moment. Bull-buffalo Jenkins was caught in
  a net of lies, certainly; but like many another buffalo before him he was
  going to be able to blunder out of it by brute force unless the unexpected
  happened. But it always does.</p>

  <p>There seems to be a natural law that when chicanery has reached a certain
  stage of ripeness, and the elements of decency begin to rebel, all the clues
  required to link the crimes with the criminal appear on the surface one by
  one, almost exactly as when two chemicals are mixed and one of them
  disintegrates. Examination of the career of any criminal or of any public
  scandal will confirm the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>It is easy to talk airily of luck and coincidence. Luck is an element of
  crime and loose thinking. The fact is that honest persistency sets natural
  laws to working, with the result, for instance, that an inventor on the trail
  of one idea discovers an entirely different one that he never dreamed of; a
  general, wholly bent on a definite, ably worked-out line of strategy
  discovers an unexpected flaw in the enemy&rsquo;s design that he would have
  missed if his own arrangements had been careless. There is no luck about it.
  It is law.</p>

  <p>So, although Jim was surprised and rather annoyed at the moment, he
  stumbled that minute on a clue. Aaronsohn, the vitriolic journalist in gold-
  rimmed glasses, was sitting outside the tent on a camp-stool, a hand on
  either knee in an attitude of suppressed impatience. He got to his feet the
  instant Jim appeared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are Major Grim, I think. I would like to talk to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry,&rdquo; Jim warned him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not. Why not do your errand and I will wait here for you? I
  have waited already two hours. You were asleep and I did not care to disturb
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something important, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To me, yes. To you, perhaps not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Wait in my tent. Help yourself to cigarettes, and
  I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instead of going to Catesby as he had intended, Jim went straight to the
  hospital tent, where he found Narayan Singh sitting at the end of the cot in
  glowering impatience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you slept?&rdquo; he asked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ask the orderly, <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim beckoned the orderly and put the question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hah! Never was such a sleeper! He has snored so for five hours on
  end that the very tent-poles shook, and I had to wake him twice lest the
  other patients get out of bed to murder him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim laughed and went to find the doctor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Narayan Singh fit to be discharged?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll discharge him like a shot. Most Sikhs enjoy a
  short spell in hospital, but that man has more excuses for discharging him
  than a porcupine has bristles. He&rsquo;s an interesting specimen, and not
  badly hurt; three days would see him as right as a trivet. I&rsquo;ve talked
  with him on and off for about three hours just for the fun of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he slept at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not much. But you know what Sikhs are; they can go without sleep
  for a tremendous time, and make it up afterwards. The last excuse he tried on
  me was a story that his father died of hydrophobia because he couldn&rsquo;t
  stand hospital environment at night, and he suggested the disease might be
  hereditary.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll let him out&mdash;a liar like that deserves
  anything. Tell him to come back and have his head dressed again after he has
  seen the lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Outside between the tents Jim gave Narayan Singh his warrant to arrest the
  <i>iblis</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you any idea where to look for him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely, <i>sahib</i>. That Suliman played a game with other young
  sprouts of wickedness outside the place where I lay. Afterwards they talked
  until Suliman grew sleepy and went off with all their money.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They told the gossip of the lines: how certain men had seen the
  <i>iblis</i> cross the railway line this morning, but were afraid to
  interfere with him. He was heading due east. I think, <i>sahib</i>, he will
  dance again tonight to summon thieves and learn from them how much has
  happened. If he does&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take some men with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, <i>sahib</i>&mdash;four men if I may choose them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you go in disguise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I! We will take rifles with bayonets, wear our uniforms and
  bring back that <i>iblis</i> in the name of a Sikh, whose head is no proper
  target for roof-stones. There is honor involved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim made arrangements for Narayan Singh to have the selection of four
  volunteers, and got written permits for them all to leave camp after dark.
  Then he returned to Aaronsohn.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Zionist had lit the lamp and was reading a Hebrew
  magazine in Jim&rsquo;s chair with that peculiar manner of armed intensity
  that characterizes the thinkers of the movement. His Vandyke beard and thin,
  Semitic nose, and a narrow shawl thrown loosely over his shoulders, made him
  look in that uncertain light like one of the statesmen-priests who used to
  intrigue in medieval history.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m at your service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come to appeal to you as a fellow American, Major
  Grim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;m in British uniform.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am also an American, as it were in service under British rules
  and regulations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The positions seem different to me. However&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are the only American in British uniform to whom I can appeal.
  I am not under arrest for the present. They have spared me that indignity,
  although I understand that General Jenkins demanded it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am charged with plotting to steal British rifles, and with hiding
  them under the floor of our store-shed, where they were discovered this
  morning by a Captain Ticknor. Now I know nothing about those rifles. We have
  never used that space beneath the floor. We only hire the place.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no notion how the rifles got there; how should I have? I am
  only quite sure that no Zionist had a hand in it, for I know what every
  Zionist in Ludd has been doing all the time. But how can I prove it?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am told you exposed a plot against Zionists in Jerusalem. Will
  you help us now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim sat down on the bed and smiled. Aaronsohn took the smile for mere
  politeness covering hesitation, and turned loose all his persuasive
  power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whatever your racial prejudices, Major Grim, the predicament we
  Zionist are placed in surely must appeal to you. On the one hand the British
  Government promises us everything&mdash;a national home for Jews in
  Palestine&mdash;assistance&mdash;fair play; and some of their officers try to
  make good that promise. I give them full credit. They haven&rsquo;t much
  intelligence from our point of view, but they act according to their
  lights.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the other hand some of the officers, General Jenkins among them,
  stop at nothing to put us in a bad light, and do everything within their
  power to handicap us in every way. Such men have even less intelligence than
  the others, but their official position gives them opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The British are not all fools,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is after all a matter of opinion. Certainly some of them are
  just according to their lights; but it is the very sense of justice that I
  dread in this instance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;General Anthony will order a court martial on me and a handful of
  others. All the officers who are anti-Zionist will exert themselves to
  discover circumstantial evidence against us. We have none
  whatever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you have,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what? I have been allowed to visit the place since the
  discovery, and it is true that it can be shown that the rifles were carried
  in through a door connecting with a place next door that is own by Arabs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But they will answer, &lsquo;What does that prove?&rsquo; Only that
  we paid Arabs to do the stealing for us! I am told that Ibrahim Charkas, who
  is the worst kind of criminal, will swear that we Zionist paid
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I think I
  know enough to prick that bubble. I&rsquo;ll provide you with some evidence
  when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what? What do you know? Tell me&mdash;I insist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;ud take too long,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Besides, the
  value of what I know largely depends on my discovering something else that
  seems to have nothing to do with it. I&rsquo;m interested in that just now.
  I&rsquo;m at my wits&rsquo; end, and want time to think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me try to help you. We will help each other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know? State the case and try me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must find an Arab named Sayed Haurani, who was talking to Captain
  Catesby by halfway between the station and the town on the afternoon of the
  third between five and six o&rsquo;clock. I need him in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Aaronsohn looked startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you have orders to gather further evidence against
  Zionists?&rdquo; he asked acidly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Jim&rsquo;s turn to sit up and take notice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Sayed Haurani a Zionist? Of course he isn&rsquo;t. But what
  d&rsquo;you know of him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To save Captain Catesby from being cashiered on a false
  charge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sayre Haurani was my messenger. I dismissed him on that occasion
  for returning an hour late from the station, because I disbelieved his
  story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim lay back on the bed and threw his legs in the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you find him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The chain&rsquo;s complete! Go and find him. Produce him at eight
  o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning in General Anthony&rsquo;s office and the
  world&rsquo;s your oyster!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no desire to eat a world on the half-shell, Major
  Grim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall have Jenkins&rsquo; head on a slaver!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, I am not Salome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What in thunder could a man want more than that? Go on,
  Aaronsohn&mdash;find your man! Produce him at eight A.M. and leave the rest
  to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In vain Aaronsohn coaxed, cajoled and persuaded. Jim shut up like a clam;
  but his eyes betrayed such infinite enjoyment that even Aaronsohn at last
  took comfort from it and went away to find the discharged messenger.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The minute he was gone, Jim went over to Catesby&rsquo;s
  tent and called out to him, standing between the sentries rather that run the
  risk of stirring Jenkins any further by being seen entering the tent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, old son, you&rsquo;re cleared. Be at headquarters at
  eight o&rsquo;clock. They&rsquo;ll fetch you anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good news, that&rsquo;s all. Go to sleep and dream about
  promotion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From there he went straight to General Anthony, who looked worried. He
  called Jim into an inner room and shut the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at the bottom of all this, Grim? Have you any
  idea?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if Jenkins is going to get away with murder once
  again. He has got the whole camp by the ears. We shall have the
  provost-marshal sending in his resignation next. After that I suppose
  there&rsquo;ll be a decoration sent out from home for me to pin on
  Jenkins!&mdash;it, the man&rsquo;s luck in unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim put his tongue in his cheek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not a word to say against him, sir!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have you come here for, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Merely to suggest that if you think both cases are sufficiently
  important you might order a preliminary hearing first thing tomorrow
  morning&mdash;all witnesses to be present as a matter of fair
  play.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? Have you got something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Jenkins given an early chance to take all the
  credit to himself. Maybe he deserves it,&rdquo; Jim answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Very well. By gad, Grim, if you let Jenkins get away with this
  I&rsquo;ll have you sent back to America. You think Catesby ought to have a
  hearing too tomorrow morning, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He ought to come first, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he has the right to that. What else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing else. If you&rsquo;ll issue the necessary orders, sir, I
  know of nothing that need spoil your appetite for dinner or your sleep
  tonight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That so? Ahem! Somebody blundered, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small>&ldquo;Proceed with the case.&rdquo;</small></p><br>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning the office at G.H.Q. was crowded, for the
  provost-marshal was there with all his prisoners; and there were a score of
  witnesses in addition, to say nothing of Brigadier Jenkins in his glory, and
  Aaronsohn, who was halfway between prisoner and witness. The latter had a
  nondescript, rebellious-looking Arab beside him, who had had to be bribed to
  come at all.</p>

  <p>Catesby was sitting in a corner by himself, in theoretical charge of two
  sentries, who stayed outside the office door.</p>

  <p>Anthony came in punctual to the second.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Major Grim here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To Jenkins&rsquo; fidgety disgust Jim was busy talking to Charkas over
  against the wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s too busy interfering with witnesses to answer
  his name,&rdquo; snapped the brigadier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Major Grim!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing over there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cautioning a prisoner to tell the truth for his own
  sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahem! I understand you appear for Captain Catesby? You want the
  case heard?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I object to that,&rdquo; said Jenkins. &ldquo;Captain Catesby is an
  important witness in the next case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will invite comment from you at the proper time, general,&rdquo;
  said Anthony without looking up. &ldquo;Call the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Catesby marched up and faced the desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I want the room cleared,&rdquo; Jenkins blustered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want all my witnesses, including Charkas, in the room for the
  present,&rdquo; Jim said quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I particularly want Charkas out of the room,&rdquo; insisted
  Jenkins. &ldquo;He has got nothing to do with this case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The defense is within its rights,&rdquo; said Anthony.</p>

  <p>And Jenkins, not exactly knowing why, but intuitively sensing disaster,
  turned about three shaded redder in the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to hear what you have to say, general,&rdquo;
  Anthony announced; and Jenkins opened fire on the unhappy Catesby, charging
  him first with culpable neglect and disobedience to orders in permitting two
  tons of TNT to be stolen from a truck, and secondly with felony in having
  given the railway memorandum to Charkas, enabling him to steal the stuff.</p>

  <p>Also with being an accessory to a felony before and after the fact, and
  with conduct in general unbecoming to an officer and a gentleman.</p>

  <p>At that point Jim produced the railway memorandum and laid it on the
  table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In case of need I may ask to have it examined for
  fingerprints,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I expect to be able to prove that those
  of Captain Catesby are not on it, whereas those of General Jenkins and
  Ibrahim Charkas are. But that may not be necessary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you making any implication?&rdquo; demanded Jenkins.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Proceed with the case,&rdquo; commanded Anthony.</p>

  <p>Jenkins had a peroration all prepared; he was constitutionally incapable
  of doing anything without calling attention to his own virtues, and he
  dissertated at length on the high calling of an officer until Anthony cut him
  short and demanded evidence.</p>

  <p>Jenkins bit his mustache, and swore under his breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My charge in itself is evidence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sufficient
  evidence to hold the prisoner. I am withholding my chief witness for the next
  case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean that you appear as prosecutor and witness?&rdquo; asked
  Anthony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;on the charge of culpable negligence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing that charge should be taken first by
  itself,&rdquo; said Jim, and Jenkins looked vastly relieved and nodded to
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on oath if you&rsquo;re a witness,&rdquo; ordered Anthony, and
  Jenkins duly kissed the well-worn Testament.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now go ahead. I&rsquo;ll write down your evidence.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Jenkins described then in great detail as to his own
  feelings in the matter, but vaguely as to time, how he had given orders to
  Catesby on the evening of the third to go and take charge of the TNT, which
  was subsequently stolen and recovered in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I ask,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the prisoner be held for
  court martial on this charge, and that the other charges be taken
  tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Anthony. &ldquo;Any questions, Major
  Grim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim pinned Jenkins down to giving the exact time&mdash;first, however,
  getting him to boast about his excellent memory. Driven to it, Jenkins swore
  on oath that he had given the memorandum to Catesby shortly after five
  o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the third.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You gave it into his hand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You swear to that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim put up Catesby, who told a perfectly straight story of having
  questioned a man named Sayed Haurani for an hour, beginning before five
  o&rsquo;clock, at a point more than a mile away from Jenkins&rsquo; office,
  and by Jenkins&rsquo; orders on that date.</p>

  <p>Jenkins reserved cross-examination. With his eye on Charkas, whose face
  was the picture of indecision and mixed emotions, Jim called Sayed Haurani.
  The man identified Catesby and confirmed his story in all particulars.</p>

  <p>Jenkins tried to break down the story by bullying the witness, but failed.
  The man was insolently confident.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ask to have the hearing postponed until I can look up this
  man&rsquo;s antecedents,&rdquo; said Jenkins. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an obvious
  liar. This is what comes of turning an accused officer loose to suborn
  evidence in the bazaar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anthony waved the objection aside, and Jenkins grew still more
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Either this witness is committing perjury, or I did,&rdquo; he
  blustered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joking matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; said Anthony, again without looking up.
  &ldquo;Call your next witness if you have one, Major Grim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Aaronsohn stood up before the desk and confirmed Sayed
  Haurani&rsquo;s evidence, explaining how he had disbelieved the man at the
  time and had dismissed him for returning from the station late. He gave the
  Arab a high character for everything except discipline, describing him as an
  insolently disobedient man, who did not trouble himself to lie about things
  as a rule, but shook off rebuke with an air of bold indifference.</p>

  <p>At last Anthony began to look very hard at Jenkins, who avoided his gaze
  by pretending to look about the room for someone who was not there. Jim had
  his eye on Charkas. A great deal depended now on the effect that what had
  gone before had had on Charkas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to re-examine General Jenkins yourself
  sir?&rdquo; he asked Anthony.</p>

  <p>Anthony took the cue, and grilled the brigadier on each point of his
  evidence, reducing him at last to a state of boiling anger bordering on
  insubordination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m charged with lying on oath I&rsquo;d like to know
  it,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand down, sir,&rdquo; ordered Anthony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ibrahim Charkas,&rdquo; ordered Jim.</p>

  <p>He met Charkas&rsquo; eye and glanced meaningly at Jenkins, but there was
  no need. The Arab had seen which way the cat was jumping, and decided there
  was more profit for himself in contributing to Jenkins&rsquo; downfall than
  in trying to support him.</p>

  <p>He could not tell the truth, of course; that would have been too much to
  expect of him. But he blurted out the whole story of the plot to ruin the
  Zionists, and accused Jenkins of having not only suggested it but of having
  paid for it as well. And instead of admitting the theft of the TNT
  memorandum, he accused Jenkins of having given it to him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That was enough for that morning. It was only a preliminary
  hearing, not a court martial.</p>

  <p>Anthony decided to postpone the hearing of the case against Charkas and
  the other thieves. He dismissed charges against Catesby, entering against
  them the two words &ldquo;honorably discharged&rdquo; for future reference.
  The two soldiers who had stood guard over Catesby were then formally
  transferred to &ldquo;Jinks,&rdquo; who marched off to his own tent a
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>Anthony had turned to Aaronsohn to tell him that pending the trial of the
  thieves there would be no restraint on his movements or implication against
  him, when there was a disturbance at the door. A sentry came to explain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; said Anthony, and in marched Narayan Singh, with
  his uniform in shreds and the marks of a strenuous fight all over him.</p>

  <p>He was bleeding slightly in one or two places, and one eye was nearly
  closed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Anthony. &ldquo;What does this
  mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The <i>iblis</i>, <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I took four men and stalked him all through the night. He was
  dancing again. We came up with him and he ran. We followed. He ran very fast,
  skipping like a he-goat, but the moon favored us and we kept him in view.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He came to bay at last in a <i>nullah</i>, and we called on him to
  surrender. He did not answer, but started to make magic to frighten us,
  waving with his arms thus&mdash;and thus. I gave the order to make him
  prisoner. So we left our rifles in charge of one man, and four of us rushed
  in to seize him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t find it so easy, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, <i>sahib</i>, far from easy. He fought as I have never known a
  man to fight. He was stronger than a leopard. He struck with hands and
  feet&mdash;bit with his teeth&mdash;and all but tore the four of us limb from
  limb. And the man who held the rifles could not shoot because of the darkness
  and the risk of killing one of us. At last he had three of us senseless, but
  I broke loose from his hold and limped back for my rifle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Senseless, eh? Where are they now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In hospital, general <i>sahib</i>. They were able to crawl
  home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us where the iblis is,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Safe in <i>jehannum</i>, <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dead, d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo; asked Anthony.
  &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He died a natural death, general <i>sahib</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;fell dead, d&rsquo;you mean?
  Apoplexy&mdash;over-exertion or something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, <i>sahib</i>; my bayonet took him under the ribs and so
  upwards. He was a good fighter. The account is square between us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the body? Did you leave it there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, general <i>sahib</i>. It says on the paper I should bring the
  prisoner in. We dragged it all the way between us, taking turns. The
  <i>dakitar</i> <i>sahib</i> says it weighs two hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dismissed, then. Go and get your wounds dressed,&rdquo; ordered
  Anthony.</p>
