  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">This tale of botanical terror was found at <a href=
  "http://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a>, the on-line archive of the National
  Library of Australia. The issue of <i>The Daily News</i> in which it was
  published attributes it as follows:</p>

  <p class="note"
     style="text-align:center">(By EDGAR WALLACE, in the "Daily Mail.")<br>
  (By JOHN JASON TRENT, in 'Pearson's.')</p><br>

  <p class="note">The reference to the "Daily Mail" is the only evidence
  linking Edgar Wallace with this story, which also appeared in <i>The Monthly
  Story Magazine</i> (The Story-Press Corp­oration, New York) in November 1905
  as having been written by "John Jason Trent," presumably after its
  publication in <i>The Daily Mail</i></p>

  <p class="note">This tale is being offered to the readers of PGA and RGL as
  an Edgar Wallace story on the assumption that he first wrote it under his own
  name for <i>The Daily Maily</i> and then submitted it for magazine
  publication under the pseudonym of "John Jason Trent." This assumption is
  nourished by the fact that "Phalaenopsis Gloriosa" is the only story listed
  under this name anywhere on the Internet. The only other work attributed to
  this author is a one-act comedy called <i>Owin' to Maggie</i> dated 1904, a
  copy of which is available at <a href=

"https://archive.org/stream/owintomaggieaco00trengoog#page/n1/mode/2up">Archive.
org</a>.
  This may well have been written by some-one whose real name was "John Jason
  Trent." There is, however, the intriguing, but as yet unprovable, possibility
  that Edgar Wallace authored this work, too.</p>

  <p class="note">Readers may find it interesting to compare this tale with
  another botanical horror story&mdash;Fred M. White's "The Purple Terror"
  (<i>The Strand</i>, September 1898), copies of which can be accessed by
  clicking on the following link <a href=

  <p class="first">TWO men sat over their liquor and cigars in the big library
  of Driscoll's country place. It was a chilly evening in April, and the great
  pine logs which blazed on the hearth before them and threw tremendous
  lightings over the books, paintings, and heavy ebony furnishings of the
  apartment scarcely served to dissipate the chill of the unused room.</p>

  <p>To the right, three long French windows looked westward over acres of lawn
  sweeping down to the broad river, while to the south the view was shut off by
  dense masses of evergreen shrubbery, supplemented by vines and creepers which
  had flung their festoons of delicate leafage in every direction across the
  windows. A great elm standing guard at this corner of the house tossed its
  branches to and fro in the spring wind and tapped nervously on the nearest
  window.</p>

  <p>The house, in spite of its wealth and beauty, impressed one with a sense
  of loneliness. A dwelling reflects the daily life of its tenants in the same
  intangible way that a man carries the reflection of his life writ large in
  face and person; and this stately room had the air of one who has looked on
  his dead and stands appalled and desolate. From the more distant parts of the
  house came the occasional creak of a board or the slam of a shutter in the
  wind, and at each fresh noise the elder of the two men turned a face full of
  ill-concealed uneasiness in the direction of the sound. At last the other
  tossed the ash of his cigar in the fire and turned to his host.</p>

  <p>"Bob, old fellow, what's the matter with you? You're as nervous as my
  grandmother! Is it a ghost or <i>delirium tremens</i> that is freezing your
  young soul? Speak out man, what is it?"</p>

  <p>Driscoll, thus addressed, rose, and going almost stealthily to the two
  doors leading out of the room, slipped the massive bolts across into their,
  sockets; then he came back to the fire, poured out some liquor, drank it, and
  pulled his chair near to Larcher.</p>

  <p>"Larcher, you and I have been out together for big game. The tiger skin
  there tells one story, this leopard's skin beneath our feet another, but I
  have brought you here to-night to help me kill or capture the most devilish
  thing that ever walked the earth. You, because you are the one man whose
  brain and nerve and muscle I can trust."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Larcher. "Is it man or beast?"</p>

  <p>"Not beast, yet scarcely human," replied the other, "but I must go back
  and tell you the story of this accursed thing that has come upon the place.
  You know what a hobby my orchid houses have long been to me, and you have
  heard me speak of the difficulty I have had in getting a capable foreman to
  minister to my favorites. The run of these fellows know merely the few common
  commercial varieties, and my interest has always centred in the rarer
  species. Six months ago I was in such despair over my collection that I had
  almost decided to give up their culture entirely rather than suffer the
  constant disappointment of having successive importations die on my hands,
  when, in response to my advertisement in the <i>Herald</i>, there walked into
  my office one morning a fellow who seemed exactly the one for the place. I
  couldn't tell his nationality exactly, but his bronzed face bore out his
  statement that he had spent many years in the tropics, collecting orchids for
  one of the big English importing houses. Details were soon adjusted between
  us, and it was arranged that he was to come down here and begin work at once.
  I inquired if he had a family, and he replied that he had a wife, who would
  come down here with him the next day.</p>

  <p>"As he rose to leave the office, I said: 'One thing more, Hearston. I hope
  you are up in growing <i>Phalaenopsis Gloriosa</i>. They are my favorite
  orchid, and I have a special house of them out there.' Larcher, at mention of
  the orchid's name I could have sworn that the fellow turned green under his
  tan. He caught at the chair back as though to steady himself, and answered
  oddly that he thought he could do nothing with them, and then added, as
  though he had said more than he had meant to: 'They are the most difficult
  orchids in the world to bloom in captivity, sir.' I smiled at the conceit of
  the orchids as imprisoned wild things, bade him good morning, and forgot the
  incident for the time.</p>

  <p>"Well, they went down the next day, and were soon established in the
  pretty little cottage on the slope of the hill near the greenhouses. I went
  down some weeks later, found everything running smoothly, and Hearston
  introduced me to his wife. You know that since Mollie died, women have rather
  gone out of my life, and I am not easily impressed with a pretty face, but I
  shall never forget the exotic beauty of that woman.</p>

  <p>"Whatever doubt there might be about his nationality, hers was
  unmistakable. She was pure, high- caste East Indian; you know the type, tall,
  slim, with exquisite features and eyes of midnight witchery. I thought as I
  looked at her that she had the same subtle atmosphere of mingled spirituality
  and splendor that my orchid blooms possess. She spoke no word of English, and
  stood beside Hearston as we talked, eyeing him with a world of pathos in her
  dark, unfathomable eyes. It was plain to see that she adored her husband from
  his footprints upward. You remember the handsome collie dog I had here, a
  beautiful fellow, who lived up to his ideals in a way to shame most humans.
  He had always been slow to make friends with strangers, though devoted to the
  old servants on the place. He came bounding up to us as we stood there, and
  to my surprise, ignored me to fawn at Mrs. Hearston's feet, leaping upon her
  with the utmost affection. 'Your wife has made a friend worth having,' I
  remarked to Hearston. The man smiled and assented, and the subject
  passed.</p>

  <p>"We spent the rest of the day going through the greenhouses together, and
  I found that I had made no mistake in my man. Such a knowledge of orchids, of
  their native conditions of growth and climate, and such a stock of East
  Indian lore was a revelation to me.</p>

  <p>"The greenhouses have been altered and enlarged considerably since you saw
  them last; the chief addition being an immense circular house at the foot of
  the range. Here I have gathered thousands of fine plants of <i>Phalaenopsis
  Gloriosa</i>. Instead of the usual equipment of benches I had a number of
  trees on the place cut down and sunk in the ground at irregular intervals
  from each other, on all sides of the house, and the orchid plants were then
  wired to them from the ground up, interspersed with ferns imbedded in moss.
  Great palms were planted thickly round the trees, and hundreds of orchids
  were suspended by wire from the roof. The whole effect was that of a bit of
  tropical jungle. In spite of all my care they had never done well, and I was
  anxious to have, my new foreman's advice on the subject.</p>

  <p>"Rather to my surprise, Hearston's wife accompanied us on our rounds, but
  when she came to the floor of the <i>Phalaenopsis</i> house, she drew back
  pale and shuddering. He spoke some rapid words in what I suppose was her
  native tongue to her, and she turned and sat on a stool in the shed outside.
  He murmured some apology to me about her being tired, and followed me into
  the house. Before communicative, the man grew oddly quiet and nervous. We
  were there some five minutes, and in that time he never took his eyes off the
  slim little figure in the shed beyond. I could get nothing out of him about
  the culture of the <i>Gloriosas</i>, and attributing his evident
  embarrassment to his ignorance on the subject, we returned to the other
  houses. That night I went back to town.</p>

  <p>"I am going into all this wearisome detail, Larcher, in the hope that you,
  with your years of experience in India, and your knowledge of the Oriental
  character, may be able to see some glimmer of dawn in the darkness of the
  mystery that followed."</p>

  <p>Larcher nodded, eagerly, and Driscoll continued:</p>

  <p>"Six weeks passed, and Hearston's reports were uniformly satisfactory. At
  the end of that time I received a curious letter from him. It was a request
  for a couple of private police to patrol the place night and day, and the man
  urged haste as though oppressed with terror. We are too far off the turnpike
  here to be often troubled with tramps. Still I felt that my new foreman had
  deserved my confidence so far, and I took steps that afternoon to engage a
  couple of men for watchman's duty. The next day was Sunday, and still a bit
  worried by the unusual tenor of Hearston's letter, I took the afternoon train
  and came out here. I had neglected to wire anyone of my coming, so there was
  no trap at the station to meet me, and I walked the mile to the place in a
  bleak February twilight that seemed to deepen in perceptible gradations.</p>

  <p>"As I came down the curve of the drive and round the southern corner of
  the house, I paused, struck by the beauty of the view. Great crimson clouds
  were banked up on the horizon as though rolled up by a stupendous fire, while
  streaks of sullen red shooting almost to the zenith flung their sinister
  reflection on the river and the lawns. I had never seen the place take on
  such a lurid unearthly beauty, fit setting for the tragedy to come. The group
  of dwarf Norwegian pines at this corner of the house stood out against the
  angry sky like some exquisite tracery, and while I stood admiring their
  symmetry and grace, a branch not twenty feet away from me swung back
  and&mdash;a face looked out.</p>

  <p>"A hideous face, such as one might conjure up in the nightmares of a
  fever, a yellow, square Mongolian face, seamed with a thousand wrinkles, and
  every seam a sin. Larcher, I saw that face as plain as I see you now. For the
  space of three seconds I stood still, looking straight at that grinning mask,
  hypnotised, perhaps, by those beady glittering eyes gazing into mine. Then
  the branch dropped back into place, and I, released from the spell cast over
  me, darted forward to the spot where it had been. It had vanished like a
  dream. I searched among the bushes for half-an-hour or more, but finally gave
  up in despair, and went into the house.</p>

  <p>"I took occasion, while old Mrs. Mayhew was serving my dinner, to question
  her guardedly on the subject of tramps or strangers on the place. She told me
  there hadn't been a stranger seen on the place all the winter. That some of
  the servants had been commenting on the fact only the night before. This made
  Hearston's letter more inexplicable than ever, and after dinner I sent for
  him, intending to have a plain talk with him on the subject. He came in
  answer to my summons, and I jumped at sight of the man's face. White and
  haggard, with a certain hunted fierceness in his eyes and a restlessness in
  his manner which changed him utterly. I felt that the situation rose to its
  feet, and explained itself as a bad combination of man and whisky. I never
  strike a man when he's down, or preach temperance to a convalescent drunkard,
  so I ignored Hearston's apparent condition, told him of my receipt of his
  letter and the arrangements I had made for the patrolling of the place.</p>

  <p>"'They must be quick, Mr. Driscoll,' Hearston broke in. 'They, must be
  quick. For God's sake, sir, get them over here at once!' He came up to me in
  his excitement and laid his hand on mine. I shivered at his touch; it was so
  cold. His eyes blazed into mine in passionate eagerness, and then I saw my
  mistake. It wasn't drink that had changed the man; it was sheer, clear, cold,
  blue terror!</p>

  <p>"'Hearston,' I said, 'there is something wrong here on the place; I want
  you to tell me frankly what you fear.'</p>

  <p>"Before the fellow had a chance to reply the night was broken by a
  succession of sharp yelps like an animal in pain, followed by a shrill
  scream, and on the sound the man beside me dashed through the door and out
  over the verandah. I followed him almost instantly and ran out of doors.
  There, ahead of me, Hearston was running over the lawn to his cottage, as
  though he had been shot from a bow. I followed him as rapidly as possible,
  marvelling at the speed with which he crossed the ground, and a second later
  I came up to him bending over his wife lying in a dead faint on the verandah
  of his cottage. A shadow lay at the woman's feet, and as I bent to see what
  it was, a pitiful little moan came up from the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Someone brought a lantern, and by its light I saw, my collie Donald lying
  there, his bright fur all matted with blood from a murderous knife-wound in
  his side. His beautiful, faithful eyes turned up to mine as I knelt beside
  him, then glazed as the little life went out. Together we lifted Mrs.
  Hearston, and, carrying her into the house, laid her upon the bed. Hearston,
  wild with excitement, bent over her, begging me to do
  something&mdash;anything. In a few minutes she recovered her consciousness,
  but relapsed at sight of us into a state of helpless hysteria. They both
  seemed too near the verge of collapse to give me any information as to what
  had occurred.</p>

  <p>"Hearston was walking to and fro like a crazy man, wringing his hands,
  while his wife lay laughing and sobbing uncontrolledly. The dog's death
  showed me that something serious was on foot on the place, and, feeling that
  they were probably not safe in the cottage by themselves, I proposed to
  Hearston that he and his wife come up here for the night. He assented with
  eagerness, and they came up to the house with me. Mayhew put them in a room
  on the ground-floor which had at one time been used as a sort of spare room
  when the house was crowded. It was in this wing, but on the other side and
  facing the greenhouses. I saw them comfortably installed, told Mayhew to see
  that Mrs. Hearston had everything she needed, and bade them good-night.</p>

  <p>"I sat long over the fire that evening, trying in vain to puzzle out
  Hearston's behavior, and the cause of my dog's death. It all depressed me
  more than I can tell you, and I was filled with a miserable, presentiment of
  evil, try as I might to shake it off. I must have sunk into a sort of a doze
  before the fire, for I dreamed a curiously vivid dream. I was out on the lawn
  in the moonlight, pursuing a baffling shape which fled from me, eluding me
  ever as I gained on it, and which kept giving out yelps like the dying cry of
  the dog.</p>

  <p>"Faster it fled, and I faster, with that curious rapid increase of
  momentum peculiar to dreams, till at last I had him by the shoulder. He
  turned in my grasp, and I saw again the hideous yellow face outlined against
  the shrubbery, and an appalling scream shot through my brain and brought me
  to my feet. I knew that I had dreamt the rest, but I could have sworn that
  the scream was real. I rushed to the door and flung it open. The hall lay
  dark and silent. I threw open a window thinking the sound might have come
  from without, but the grave could not be quieter; and cursing my nervous
  imagination for the fright that it had given me, I turned in and went to
  bed.</p>

  <p>"The next morning I woke early, and eager to clear up in the daylight the
  wretched business of the night before, I sent Hendricks over to Hearston's
  room to tell him I wished to see him as soon as possible. The fellow came
  back and said he had knocked repeatedly on Hearston's door, but couldn't
  rouse him, and in that instant all the vague horror of the night before
  returned to me. The room had two long French windows in it like these,
  opening out on the north verandah, so I sent Hendricks out on the porch to
  reconnoiter from the outside. He returned, almost immediately this time, to
  say that one of the windows was wide open, and he had looked in. The room was
  in confusion, Hearston and his wife were gone. It came to me that they might
  have risen early and gone back to the cottage, so I sent Hendricks for the
  third time to deliver my message. A third time he came back to say that they
  were not there. I went myself to the cottage. It was just as we had left it
  the night before. I hailed one of the gardeners on his way to work. 'Have you
  seen Hearston?' 'No,' he answered; 'perhaps he is in the greenhouses.'</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps he is,' I said; 'we must find him. You and Hendricks take the
  first house and I'll take the second, and we'll go through alternating.' I
  started on my tour of the houses, calling Hearston's name aloud in my
  eagerness to find him safe, and shake off the deepening conviction that I
  should find him otherwise.</p>

  <p>I reached the <i>Phalaenopsis</i> house at the foot of the range, still
  calling, opened the door and started to go in. The masses of greenery made
  the interior seem dim to me after the morning sunlight; but as I closed the
  door I saw something coming towards me out of the forest twilight of the
  place. At first I thought that it was Broughton's Great Dane&mdash;the dog is
  over here half the time&mdash;but it rose upright, upright and gibbering,
  lunged at me through the shadows of the green! I leaped to the door and
  crashed it behind me, and the thing fell against it heavily, and rolled over
  on the floor. It was Hearston; Hearston with snow-white hair and eyes of
  flame! Hearston, and he was mad&mdash;mad!"</p>

  <p>"And the woman?"</p>

  <p>"No trace! If the earth had opened and swallowed her she could not have
  disappeared more utterly. We captured Hearston after a terrible struggle;
  there was nothing to be elicited from him. Every inch of this place has been
  searched and searched again, and still, no trace! And, Larcher, It seems a
  trivial thing, a weak and empty fancy, and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell!"</p>

  <p>"Since that night when that mysterious horror happened, those
  <i>Gloriosas</i> seem to have taken a new lease, of life! Great sprays have
  started from every plant and hang laced and interlaced like some strange web
  on every side. Buds developed, but they do not bloom! A month ago I said to
  the man in charge&mdash;'To-morrow will see this house white with
  blossoms.'</p>

  <p>"He looked at me curiously. 'So I thought, sir, a week ago.'</p>

  <p>"'They were not sufficiently developed, then,' I answered.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir, just as they are now.'</p>

  <p>"'Why, man, they couldn't be,' I cried! 'look at them, they are just ready
  to burst open.'</p>

  <p>"'As you say, sir,' he answered; reservedly.</p>

  <p>"'But you don't agree with me?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'No, sir, they were just like this ten days ago; one would say, sir, they
  were all ready to bloom, but&mdash;that they were waiting for something!'</p>

  <p>"It is true! I have watched them ever since. The whole place is full of a
  dismal, haunting oppression that I cannot shake off or banish. An
  indescribable terror hangs over it, and I never want to see it again.'</p>

  <p>Larcher rose to his feet, his face alight with excitement, and stood with
  his back to the fire looking down at Driscoll.</p>

  <p>"And the motive, the clue, the explanation to it all? What do people say?
  What do they think?"</p>

  <p>"Everything and nothing! A woman is made away with&mdash;by whom? By
  Hearston, himself, some say: Bah! The man loved her. She had no fear of him.
  There was a third person whom they both feared&mdash;the face in the
  pines."</p>

  <p>"The other men on the place?"</p>

  <p>"Are above suspicion! They all room together in quarters over the
  carriage-house, and were all there that night. They say that Hearston was a
  good fellow and devoted to his wife; that she was with him in the
  green-houses every day, and that he never seemed content unless she was close
  beside him. Further, it was brought out that in the ten days preceding the
  occurrence Hearston had seemed strangely excited and nervous, but perfectly
  sober and sane, and, note this, that there had been no tramp nor suspicious
  character seen on the place since Hearston had come on it."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell the police of the face you had seen?"</p>

  <p>"I did. But no one else had seen it; I had no tangible proof that I had,
  and the consensus of opinion seemed to be that it was the result of
  overstrained nerves."</p>

  <p>"What has become of Hearston?"</p>

  <p>"He is, or rather was, till two days ago, in the lunatic asylum, the tower
  of which you can see just over the trees, to the west of the place. It's
  about three miles distant. They said from the first that his condition was
  quite hopeless. When they took him there he was almost uncontrollable; then
  he sank into a sullen silence difficult to break. Two days ago I received
  word from the superintendent that Hearston had burst the heavy iron bars at
  his window and escaped. They begged me, if I had any knowledge of his
  whereabouts, to inform them at once, and added that they were watching my
  place, as it was likely that he would seek his home.</p>

  <p>"I came down here immediately, but so far, have had no sight of him.
  Yesterday afternoon I grew lonely and nervous. I had been in the house all
  day, and, thinking a little exercise would do me good, I strolled up the
  drive to the gate. It was almost dark when I turned to come back, and I
  couldn't help glancing sharply through the shrubbery as I passed along. I had
  on an old pair of tennis shoes I found in my room here, and the soft soles
  were almost noiseless on the gravel roadway. And as I walked it seemed to me
  I heard a sort of swish, swish, as of someone moving through the bushes to my
  right. I drew my revolver, and gradually slackened my speed, that whatever it
  was might pass me.</p>

  <p>"The movement in the bushes slackened, too, and I knew that I was being
  watched. I walked on till we came to a place where the shrubbery lining the
  road was thinner than usual, and, wheeling suddenly, I plunged through the
  bushes in the direction of the sound. As I wheeled, so did the intruder, and
  put such distance between us that I could but faintly make out a tall supple
  figure in the robe of some dark stuff, wound round the waist with a scarf. I
  had hoped to find it Hearston. But it wasn't he, for the man glanced around
  just before he disappeared, and I saw again the villainous yellow face, and
  the beady eyes! I ran after him, discharging my revolver as I ran, but the
  shots went wild in the gathering night, and for a second time he eluded me.
  This morning I sent you a wire. You are here. That is all."</p>

  <p>"Driscoll, you say the face you saw in the shrubbery was grinning? Did you
  notice anything, peculiar, about the teeth?"</p>

  <p>Driscoll sprang to his feet with a smothered oath. "Larcher, you have seen
  it! Where?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen it, Bob, upon my word!"</p>

  <p>"Then how did you know that it hadn't any teeth? At least, just the two
  incisors, at the angle of the jaw, long and yellow like a wolf's fangs! How
  did you know the one thing I omitted to tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, and I'll tell you. It's a bit of a story I haven't thought of
  for years," answered Larcher, lighting a fresh cigar. "By the way, since you
  confess so frankly to carrying a gun, I may as well unload myself of my
  armoury. I never stay in civilisation long enough at a time to accustom
  myself to going without a weapon. I'll lay it here on the table, if you don't
  mind. Well, you remember that I went out with the British East India
  Geographical Commission some seven years ago, and you will remember, further,
  perhaps, that our chief mission at that time was the exploration of some of
  the tributaries of the Mekhong River. The British Government has ploughed
  India with its army, and harrowed it with its civil service, till it is
  surprising that there should be a wild spot left; but there are still great
  stretches of territory unknown and almost impenetrable, where the weeds of
  native custom flourish in rank luxuriance. There is probably no place on the
  habitable globe, under the nominal control of the civilised nation,
  concerning which so little is known as the valley of the Mekhong River.
  Immense forests, centuries o]d, stretch unbroken for hundreds of miles,
  hiding in dank, impenetrable morass and jungle, the wild, fierce people who
  inhabit them.</p>

  <p>"We struck the Lam-nam-si River at its junction with the Mekhong, and
  started off to follow it to its source. We had not been out more than three
  days' march when we began to hear of tigers, and I determined to leave the
  party at Menatkong and browse round the neighborhood a bit to see if I could
  get a tiger skin or two. I expected to join the others about a week later at
  a point agreed upon. They protested that my life wouldn't be worth a
  farthing, alone in that country; so I compromised by taking Haranya Vatani, a
  native, who accompanied the party as guide and godmother. The first day we
  were disappointed in our game, and found ourselves at dusk, with a tropical
  storm on our track, near an isolated native village.</p>

  <p>"It was the only place for miles around that offered human habitation and
  a shelter from the storm, but in spite of that Haranya tried to steer me past
  it. This only made me curious to see it, so I took the rudder in my own
  hands, and we stayed over night there. We were civilly received, for Vatani's
  fat face is a sort of general ticket of admission to that part of the
  universe; but the next day, the worst of the storm being over, one of the
  inhabitants tipped Vatani the wink that it would be more tactful if we would
  move on, and we, accordingly, did so. After we left the place, Vatani told me
  the cause of our scant entertainment. The name of the village is Kong-Satru.
  You know, doubtless, that practically all the <i>Gloriosas</i> come from
  there."</p>

  <p>"No, I thought they came from Panom-Pehn; that is the place mentioned in
  the invoices."</p>

  <p>"That is the river-port where they are packed for shipment. They are
  stolen from the forests around Kong-Satru by sturdy adventurers, who
  evidently have little love of life, and shipped by stealth and night down the
  Mekhong to the sea. The forests on the hills around Kong-Satru are the most
  magnificgnt imaginable, and teeming with this variety of orchid. A native,
  Haranya said, would much sooner think of selling his children than a plant of
  the <i>Gloriosas</i>, which are indescribably sacred to them. These people
  mix their religion with the culture of the plants in a manner at once
  horrible and grotesque. The flowers are cared for by a band of native
  priests, who to the thousand other Oriental ideas, add one more, the most
  gruesome of them all.</p>

  <p>"They say," and Larcher leaned across the table towards Driscoll and gazed
  meditatively out into the night as he continued: "They say that the orchids
  must have blood, human blood, and so it happens just before the plants'
  blooming season, the priests select a victim from among the inhabitants of
  the village for this sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"And then?" asked Driscoll, as Larcher paused, still gazing past him out
  of the window, sunk in reminiscence.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of the night Haranya told me this tale, sitting in a
  little tent in the midst of the jungle, not 30 miles from Kong-Satru, with
  the tail of the storm lashing round us, and Vatani shivering with fright lest
  he be overheard in the telling; in India it is neither polite nor healthy to
  discuss your neighbor's religion."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"And then, on the day of the feast of the flowers, which was the festival
  our presence interrupted, on that full moon of April, when I unwittingly
  grazed Death, there is high carnival in Kong-Satru, and the priests take the
  victim to the forests above the town&mdash;and feed the flowers!"</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"'And then they bloom!' said Haranya, 'and not until then!' The priests
  are a vile-looking lot, with yellow skin like parchment, their teeth not gone
  as you describe, it, but the four front teeth blackened so that at a distance
  they are invisible. There is a large Chinese element in these priests, if
  they are not indeed full-blooded Mongolians, which marks them off from the
  rest of the Aryan population."</p>

  <p>"And you think that Hearston's wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was doomed to the sacrifice! That Hearston was in the neighborhood
  gathering <i>Phalaenopsis</i>, and either had seen her before, or met her
  while she was trying to escape; that by his knowledge of the country he
  succeeded in getting her to some sea-coast town where they shipped for
  England. Then they came here and lived content, till the fanatic face rose up
  at her elbow, inexorable as fate. I think myself that those priests must have
  some hypnotic influence over the people; you heard the girl's cry when he
  came to her that night? How else did he awe them to the submission and
  silence that followed?"</p>

  <p>"I see it now. It must have been the priest, too, who killed my poor
  collie."</p>

  <p>"Do not lament the dog, Bob; he died trying to defend the gentle soul who
  had been kind to him, and no death could be nobler. I think that the priest
  has the girl in hiding, hypnotised; he is waiting for, the hour. It has
  struck! This is the full moon of April, the day of the feast of the flowers.
  If the girl is to be saved, it must be now. We shall have an able ally."</p>

  <p>Driscoll sprang to, his feet. "Who?"</p>

  <p>"Hearston! He is tracking the priest; I have been watching him at it the
  last half-hour."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"There! See! The gaunt figure crouching in the shadow of the pillar on the
  porch! At first I thought he was the priest; and laid my gun handy; then he
  moved a bit, and the moonlight fell on the white hair and asylum garb. Depend
  upon it, Driscoll, Hearston, too, has seen that face from his prison windows
  and the iron bent like tin beneath the maniac strength that gathered itself
  and passed out to slay. See! He is watching something that is moving across
  the lawn from south to north. I can tell that, from his movements. It can be
  nothing else but the priest. Look, he is rising! Are you armed? Then
  come."</p>

  <p>Leading the way, Larcher noiselessly unlatched the window and passed out
  on the verandah, Driscoll following. The man in front of them crept
  cautiously forward from the shadow of one tree to the next till he reached a
  clump of shrubs commanding a view of the great stone staircase which terraced
  the hill beside the greenhouses. He paused here, watching the stairs
  intently. Larcher and Driscoll at a little distance did the same.</p>

  <p>"He's lost him," whispered Driscoll; but Larcher shook his head. A moment
  later the priest glided out of the bushes fringing the stairway, almost at
  the bottom of the hill. For an instant the supple figure stood out in the
  full moonlight, black against the whiteness of the stonework, listening;
  then, apparently satisfied, he beckoned, and a slender white figure crept out
  and after him as he opened a door and disappeared. In an instant Hearston was
  making his way down the steps, the others following as before. There was no
  hesitation or undue haste in his movements; as silently and relentlessly as
  the tide laps up the shore, so did he cover the space between himself and the
  priest. He reached the door of the <i>Phalaenopsis</i> house and melted into
  the blackness of the wall. As the door opened a low monotonous sing-song
  chant struck the ears of the two outside.</p>

  <p>"Chinese, by all that's holy? Bob, he is worshipping the flowers!"</p>

  <p>A second later they had reached the door and looked in.</p>

  <p>It was a weird scene! Lofty trees towered sheer to the height of forty
  feet or more, covered with the delicate green of ferns among the darker
  shades of the orchid plants, while thousands of sprays of half-open flowers
  filled the house with a subtle and exquisite odor.</p>

  <p>The priest stood in the centre of the house, his back to the door. He had
  cast off his robe, and, naked save for a loin cloth, was swaying to and fro
  in a sort of religious ecstasy, his arms extended towards the flowers above
  him, and chanting as he swayed. At his feet knelt the woman, white, unseeing,
  tranced!</p>

  <p>Behind him, mute and terrible, crouched Hearston, waiting for the instant
  of his spring.</p>

  <p>"Hearston's unarmed!" breathed Driscoll.</p>

  <p>"Yes, like a gorilla! Let be! The quarry's his."</p>

  <p>At last the priest paused in his chant and the moment came. Hearston
  reached out with his left hand, caught the bolt of the door, and shot it home
  with a crash that shook the house. It was challenge and ultimatum in one, and
  at the noise the priest swung round and faced his death!</p>

  <p>He flung one arm aloft, in what almost seemed like a gesture of command;
  but, as he did so, Hearston's embrace went round him like a hoop of steel,
  crushing him in with slow, resistless force. The Mongol would have been a
  match for a heavier man in a poorer cause, and he writhed in Hearston's
  grasp, making frantic efforts to release himself, till the mighty muscles
  rolled under the yellow skin like the coiling and uncoiling of a cobra. A
  frantic tug at the loin cloth and his free arm flung upward, a curved knife
  in his grasp, and twice it fell in abortive strokes which glanced off
  Hearston harmlessly.</p>

  <p>The men outside flung themselves against the barred door with a force that
  splintered the glass in the upper half, but the bolt held. Larcher reached,
  in through the splinters that remained, pushed back the bolt, and the two
  rushed in.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in one last supreme effort, the priest raised himself to his
  full height, almost lifting Hearston off his feet. Again the light quivered
  along the knife as it rose and fell, and as the priest sank backward, dead,
  he carried Hearston with him, the knife lodged in his back.</p>

  <p>Driscoll bent over the prostrate forms, trying in vain to unlock
  Hearston's fingers still knotted round the priest. A cry broke from the lips
  of the girl beside them, and the men both turned and looked at her. She was
  standing gazing at Hearston in pathos unutterable; the cry that had escaped
  her was the long, low Indian wail for the dead. Larcher stooped, and with
  practised hand drew out the knife, then turned.</p>

  <p>"Do not mourn," he said to the girl in her own tongue. "He will live,
  since you have come back to him."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke Hearston released his hold on the priest, and turned and
  held out his arms to the girl. The flame had died out of his eyes&mdash;the
  man was sane!</p>

  <p>"Driscoll," cried Larcher, in a curious toneless voice, "look up, look up
  at your orchids, they think they are going to be fed!"</p>

  <p>Driscoll straightened himself from surveying the priest and looked about
  him. He went white as he gazed and threw a steadying hand against the nearest
  tree.</p>

  <p>Multitudes of great white flowers swayed on every stalk, crisp, new blown!
  Wide open, each petal distended and with eager stems, as happier flowers turn
  to the sun, they craned their faces towards the dead priest on the floor.</p>
