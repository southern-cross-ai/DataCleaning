<p>The &quot;Catholic Press&quot; has secured the rights of another
Australian story, by E. S. Sorensen, the best living writer of bush
stories. No man knows the secrets of the bush better than Sorensen.
In his day he has been a bush carpenter, a publican, a drover, a
shearer and a station hand. He was born on the Northern Rivers, and
educated by the Sisters of St. Joseph. He has travelled from one
end of Australia to the other. He is the author of many books.</p>
<p>In &quot;A Backblocker's Pleasure Trip&quot; he relates the
experiences and adventures of a party of backblock excursionists at
the time of the visit of the Duke of York, the itinerary being from
the interior to Sydney, via Mount Browne, Menindie, Broken Hill,
Adelaide and Melbourne. The narrative is interspersed with bush and
town sketches, humorous incidents and yarns by the way. It forms a
sequel to &quot;The Swagman's Diary,&quot; which was published in
the &quot;Catholic Press&quot; some months back, but the treatment
is different.</p>
<p>The first instalment of this delightful narrative will be
published in the &quot;Press&quot; next week.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Editor's Note: In this advertisment a week
before the serial started, the Catholic Press spelled the author's
name Sorensen instead of Sorenson.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br>
An Early Start&mdash; A Milkmaid of the Interior&mdash;A Digger's
Home.</h2>
<p>At certain seasons our several Governments combine to run
excursion trains from Broken Hill to Sydney (and vice-versa), via
Adelaide and Melbourne. I sampled the excursion at the time the
Duke of York was visiting Australia. A lot of people were going
east then to see Royalty. I had no appointment with him myself; in
fact, I wasn't going down to see the Duke at all&mdash;nor even the
Duchess. The prolonged drought of that period, with its heat and
flies and thirst and duststorms, was getting monotonous, and the
cheap excursion decided me that I wanted a change of climate.</p>
<p>Being at Tibooburra, 200 miles from the railway station, I had
to start early to catch the express. I started three weeks before
hand. This was to allow time to recover from the awful coach trip
before beginning the long train journey.</p>
<p>It was not a mere holiday trip with me; I was going for good.
There was nothing about Tibooburra to hold the affections of one
who had known the regions of great forests and perennial streams.
It was a small town, with only one street; but there were three
hotels in it, and it seemed to do a fairly good business for a far
inland town that was surrounded with endless miles of emptiness. It
was a picturesque little spot, in what the coastal people call the
Land of Sunset, noticeable particularly for the numerous huge
cone-shaped piles of stones or gibbers around it, and for the
immense flocks of goats that dotted the immediate landscape.</p>
<p>Turn where you would, Billy and Nanny and the kids were always
in evidence. They mooched through the street, and they slept on the
footpath, indifferent to passers-by. On a dark night the passer-by
sometimes passed over a prostrate form into the mud. They could be
seen like mere specks on the distant flat, and posed in all manner
of attitudes on the rocky hillsides, with one here and there
silhouetted against the sky line, standing like a living statue on
the topmost rock of a lofty pinnacle. It was the home of the goat;
for there were no other animals to be seen, excepting an odd horse
and a stray dog here and there. The sparse herbage and the rugged
nature of the local pasture did not support cows. Goat milk, goat
meat and even goat butter were common items in the family bill of
fare.</p>
<p>Here the milkmaid was a familiar figure in the street. Where
nearly everybody who had time to attend to the animals kept goats,
there was only room for one in the dairying business. She was about
16, the main support of a widowed mother. She did her round on
foot, carrying a quart measure and a billycan; but a bare-legged
boy accompanied her with a home-made goat-cart, on which the bulk
of the milk was carried. Her principal customers were the hotels
and stores; and there were a few houses outside the &quot;main
street&quot; which the little milk-cart visited regularly, rattling
over the broken ground and among the rock heaps on a narrow track
of its own. She was truly a picture of the great, dry, central
region, this little milkmaid. Her turn out brought a smile from
visitors; but nobody else seemed to notice anything unusual about
it. Casual customers met the milk cart with their jugs, and
toddlers looked for a noggin when she came along.</p>
<p>At milking time you saw her and the mother and two small boys in
the midst of a flock, going busily from one goat to another with
their cans. They milked them anywhere in the yard, and when the
work was over the herd was turned loose among the gibbers. Now and
again one was kept back to be killed for meat, a task in which the
girl was again the chief actor. Mustering the flock was an
interesting process. They mingled with a thousand other goats, most
of which bore a very striking resemblance to each other to a
stranger. There would be a score of juveniles goat-hunting at once,
running along the narrow valleys, climbing up and down the piled-up
rocks, searching every nook, and roaming over the broken flats,
calling their pets, and drafting them out of the mixed mobs. They
all had names for their goats; and they all knew them individually.
The little dairymaid owned about 300. In her little world the goat
was not only the family sustenance, but took the place of the cow
in all the other homes of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I carried away with me one other vivid picture of that place,
the home of a digger's wife; for here I picked up John Jovius
Muggs, a shrewd battler, who was also going &quot;down below.&quot;
He was some distant relation of hers; and he called me over to help
to recover a poddy foal that had slipped into an old shaft.</p>
<p>The dwelling, like many another around it, was a patchwork
structure, built into an indentation in a huge pile of rocks. In
this position it had to conform somewhat to the natural outline of
the limited site. It was neither square, oblong, nor round, and the
visitor had no idea of its dimensions until he got inside. You had
to stoop to enter, but inside you could straighten yourself out and
admire the craftsmanship of the architect. The walls were partly of
immovable rock and partly of hessian; the floor was a mixture of
soft granite and natural cement; and in front, some distance from
the verandah, was a high wind-break of cane grass. The kitchen was
in a wide angle, at the side, the spacious fireplace being also in
part built by nature, and in part by the digger with rough stones
and pug.</p>
<p>Nearly all the furniture was home-made. Packing-cases were
transformed into tables, easy chairs, chests of drawers, cupboards,
dressers, shelves and beds. The sofa or lounge, covered with
cretonne, was fashioned of the same rough material, padded with
horsehair. The cooking was done much in the same way as in a camp
or a bushman's hut; but there was no floor-scrubbing and no window
cleaning.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the afternoon the woman visited a neighbour's
place, planted among other piles of rocks, and invisible until you
got near it. Sometimes she took the children along the little flats
and gullies, prospecting in the alluvial. In these rambles,
especially after rain, they picked up many specks of gold, and
sometimes discovered a payable claim for the old man. At night
&quot;mother&quot; sat at the table, blowing the black sand from
the gold that &quot;father&quot; had obtained during the day,
before bottling it and putting it away for Saturday.</p>
<p>A little, oblong-shaped hole near the house showed the source of
their water supply. It was only a few feet deep, and the water in
it looked only enough to last a day or two. But it never gave out.
Close by each of the neighbours' places was a similar soakage.
Besides being used for household purposes, the water was run in
little channels through a cultivated plot; in another angle of the
rock-heap, which supplied them with vegetables and fruit. The
rock-heap was their own little mountain, over which their goats
climbed and browsed, and in the nooks and corners of which their
fowls scratched and planted their nests. It was a home suited to
the hot, dusty, western clime, where people live under different
conditions from those of other parts of the State. It was the
typical digger's home in the region known as Mount Browne.</p>
<p>When I was called over by Mr. Muggs, the woman was assisting to
hoist the foal from the shaft, which was about 12ft. deep. A tripod
and blocking tackle were fixed up over it; and having fastened a
rope round the foal, we hauled it up. Then, while the woman and I
hung on to the rope, Mr. Muggs got behind the foal to shove it
clear of the shaft. He had no sooner put his hands against it than
the suspended animal struggled violently, and kicked him backwards
into the shaft. We couldn't run to his assistance, or to inquire if
he had sustained any damage. We had to hang on all we could; and
meanwhile Mr. Muggs watched the struggling beast from below,
dreading every moment that we would let it drop on top of him.</p>
<p>Luckily, the digger came home for his lunch, and in a moment or
two we were relieved of the poddy. Then we hauled up Mr. Muggs, who
was mainly suffering from the terror that had hung over him; after
which we had just time to get lunch before boarding the coach for
the long road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br>
On an Old Diggings.</h2>
<p>Coaching through the lonely back country is not exhilarating.
You travel all day, all night, all next day, all that night, and
all the following day, by which time you are feeling rather tired
of it. You are also feeling drowsy. You stop only for
meals&mdash;which are sometimes 18 hours apart, to change horses,
and at the sandhills.</p>
<p>Our first halt was at Warratta, a wayside pub, where we washed
down some of the dust we had collected in climbing up and down many
stony, saltbush hills; and our next the little town of Milparinka,
which after more substantial refreshments and a ramble, we left at
dusk.</p>
<p>Like Tibooburra, our starting point, Mount Browne, Warratta and
Milparinka were all goldfields that had known better days in the
long past, and still supported a good number of puddlers,
dryblowers, fossickers and others.</p>
<p>A queer lot of human derelicts one meets on some of the old
alluvial diggings. What answers to the description of good
fossicking ground is the last haven of the inveterate digger when
old age creeps upon him. Down the long river of life he has known
many vicissitudes; like a coracle he has drifted through the rushes
and whirls of the golden course, tearing wildly over rapids and
tumbling over falls; buffeted among the rocks, and stranded awhile
in the shallows to float again into calm waters, through little
eddies and ripples, and at last to drift out of the running stream
into a by-wash and a dead end. That is the fossicking ground as the
old men know it, where all the excitement of a rushing digger's
life is gone and done with. There remains only the necessity of
scratching around for an existence, with the faint hope, which
really never entirely dies in any digger, of striking a stray
nugget or a rich pocket.</p>
<p>Some of them have handled fortunes in their time; in stirring
days when life was young, and money was not valued, and was parted
with as quickly as it came. In the neighbourhood of Mount Browne
was one who was known as Bendigo. He was very nearly a centenarian;
bent, wrinkled, and toothless, but still with energy and
independence enough to potter about with pick and shovel. He got
his nickname from the fact that his conversation usually bristled
with references to the big Victorian field. He made his first pile
on Bendigo, and he made many a good rise afterwards, at one time
being possessed of &pound;12,000.</p>
<p>When I first saw him he stood at the corner of the street,
carefully searching the pockets of his patched clothes, and wearing
a deeply thoughtful expression, as if he were trying to recollect
what he had done with his last sixpence. The pockets turning out
all duffers, he shuffled resignedly back to his camp, which
happened then to be a hessian hut, the home of a man who worked at
anything in the district, and did a bit of mining when there was
nothing else to do. Bendigo had no abiding place that he could call
his own. There were several men who had small dwellings on the
field, and who were much of the year working away from it, at
shearing sheds and elsewhere. There were others, too, who could not
work their claims during the long, dry spells for want of water.
They were not content, like the old chaps, to get a couple of
pennyweights a week until rain came, and they left home to seek
other employment.</p>
<p>As one of these went out, Bendigo walked in, taking possession
of the hut and utensils, and sometimes any tools that were there.
Bendigo did not always possess a working kit. He couldn't obtain
necessaries on trust; and when hard up he had to sell his kit or
leave it as security. He had no mining claim either. He wandered
about, working wherever he could find shelter, and especially where
there chanced to be a deserted soakage. When the owner of the hut
returned and temporarily inconvenienced him by turning him out, he
looked for some reward for having acted as caretaker.</p>
<p>In the same locality was a hatter, who was popularly known as
Dirty Peter. He was a dryblower, and no local evidence was
adducible that he had ever washed either himself or his clothes.
His name certainly suited his appearance. I often noticed his
humpy, for it was one that had some eye arresting peculiarities
about it. It was partly a dugout, with a patchwork roof like a
Chinaman's hovel, and a chimney some yards in the rear composed of
a pile of rough stones, topped with a broken drainpipe. He
descended into the dungeon by means of an arrangement that was
partly a ladder and partly a staircase. A wall of stones and bushes
enclosed the premises on three sides; the front was open, and the
ground thickly pitted right up to the door with old shafts. A
little track, a couple of feet wide, zigzagged among the gaping
holes to the entrance of Pete's happy home. The shafts had been
there since the days of the rush, and it was believed that Peter
left them unfilled as a deterrent to evening visitors. He was a
hard worker. Early and late he was at it, picking, shovelling, and
blowing the dry soil on the flat, always about the same place, year
after year, and every day's end he was seen zigzagging home with a
log of wood on his shoulder. What he made nobody knew. He never
hung about town, even at race time or election time. There was one
thing about Peter that made him talked about among the old
brigade&mdash;he always had money, but he always looked and
pretended to be hard up.</p>
<p>Then there was &quot;Old Ned,&quot; an old age pensioner. He had
a neat little hut, kept scrupulously clean, the path to which was
also hemmed with shafts. He, too, was something of a recluse. All
day he kept to his hut, for he had given up mining, and at night he
emerged to prowl about the vicinage. He liked to keep a fire
burning, where he sat and smoked, or absorbed any interesting
literature he chanced to pick up; and as it was a long way to the
mulga ridges, he visited the unguarded woodheaps at the back of the
business places. If he heard anyone approaching from the opposite
direction while making home with the fuel, he dropped it down a
shaft, and returned for it later. His path was a short cut from
town across the flat, and sometimes he had several interruptions in
getting a log home. One night a digger came almost on to him as he
was busy hauling a heavy piece out of a hole. Ned let it slip back
quickly, and commenced to feel along the path with his hands.
&quot;Hulloa, there!&quot; said the digger, &quot;what's up.&quot;
&quot;I've lost my pipe,&quot; said Ned, continuing the search. The
digger produced a box of matches, and was about to strike one to
help, when Ned hurriedly interrupted: &quot;It's all right, I've
got it!&quot; and straightening up, he thrust a short, knobby stick
between his teeth, and made a pretence of drawing through it.</p>
<p>Another curious character was Windyne, who was commonly known as
Windy the Fossicker, and to some as Cranky Windy. He dwelt alone in
a little slab hut that he had built in the centre of a square plot
of ground, containing about five acres. He earned his nickname from
the fact that he spent all his days fossicking about that
selection. It was broken up from side to side and from end to end,
hardly a vestige anywhere being left untouched. It had never panned
out a colour, but that didn't discourage Windy. When he wasn't
digging, or measuring with a tape, he was seen mooching about with
a pick and shovel in one hand and a tattered map in the other. How
many years he had been thus unprofitably employed nobody could
recollect.</p>
<p>He was a very old man when I knew him, bald-headed, wrinkled,
and watery eyed. He lived on a small remittance, which he said,
would be paid to him by his loving relatives as long as he stayed
away from them. I took refuge under his humble roof one rainy day,
and whilst we sat over the fire he told me his story.</p>
<p>He and a mate had been digging together, and being on a good run
of dribbling gold, which kept them going comfortably, they invested
some of their spare cash in a Tattersall's sweep, and drew a
winner. The sum was about &pound;10,000, according to Windy. The
storekeeper collected the money, and handed it over to Windy's
mate, who stowed it away in their tent. That night, Windy,
celebrating his elevation to fortune, was treating everybody he met
in town, and wound up by assaulting the constable. Ordinarily Windy
was the most peaceful of citizens. His lapse cost him a month in
the local lockup. He had been cooling his heels there about three
weeks when he heard that his mate had been found dead in the tent.
The only money that could be found was a couple of one pound notes
in his pocket and some loose cash in a chamois bag under his
pillow.</p>
<p>&quot;He must have known he was dyin',&quot; said Windy,
&quot;for he left me a rough chart&mdash;this old map 'ere that
I've studied for ages and ages. There's one word
underneath&mdash;'Buried'&mdash;with the last letter only half
formed, as if he had a spasm or something just there, an' never
went back to finish what he'd meant to write.</p>
<p>&quot;After I got out I spent six months searchin' and diggin'
in vain for the buried money. Then&mdash;for fear somebody else
might start prospectin' in the locality&mdash;I took up this
homestead selection. It's no good for anything, an' my good
neighbors are convinced that I'm stark starin' mad for selectin'
such a plot; but the map says the gold's hidden inside its
boundaries. Lord knows, I've done a power o' diggin', but I haven't
struck the colour of it yet. Sometimes I think I've put the house
on it. If that's the case the house will have to shift. But there's
a few little virgin spots on the estate I must try first. Likely
enough it's in one of them; if it's not it's under the house; and
if it's not under the house&mdash;well, then, I must have put the
fence up wrong, an' left the fortune out in the bush. . . . It must
be somewhere, that's sure. Blast old Bill; he couldn't take it with
him, could he? It's not my way to say anything against the dead,
but old Bill was always a fool of a feller with money. An' to snuff
out like that without finishin' the d&mdash;&mdash; map, that's
what gets over me! . . . Anyhow&quot;&mdash;concluding with a gleam
of cheerful philosophy&mdash;&quot;if I don't soon find it I won't
want it.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br>
A Lost Coach&mdash;The Mail Girl&mdash;&quot;Returning
Exiles.&quot;</h2>
<p>When you are shut up at night in a rocking, rolling, rattling
coach, packed for hour after hour in the form of a zigzag, even the
heavy sandhill can be a welcome variation to the tedium of travel.
On coming to one or the latter the horses pulled up of their own
accord, and the driver peremptorily ordered all hands to get out.
We got out and walked, and now and again we shoved and spoked the
wheels, and otherwise worked our passage over the bars. We paid
&pound;6 each for this privilege.</p>
<p>We didn't mind walking over the sand. It was better to have it
underfoot than to meet it whirling through the atmosphere in dense
clouds. The scenery was like the weather&mdash;monotonous; and
these little breaks were a relief. We did not grumble either when
the coachdriver got lost at night, and we had to do some exploring
with lamps and matches. It might delay us a few minutes, or a few
hours&mdash;what matter? We were quite animated when we took our
seats again. We exhibited scratches and bruises as proof that we
found trees and other vegetation without the assistance of a guide;
and we related how we discovered numerous small gullies, without
injury and without breaking or losing the coach lamp.</p>
<p>We did lose the coach on one occasion. Everybody had gone
road-hunting, and when the thoroughfare was located and all hands
had been summoned to the spot, we found that we had mislaid the
conveyance. No light had been left to guide us, and the horses
wouldn't answer a coo-ee like a lost passenger. They wouldn't make
any sound at all. On that lone, benighted plain no team ever stood
so still. So things looked serious for a while.</p>
<p>When we set out to recover it, it was surprising what a lot of
things could look like a coach and horses. A small mulga tree and a
colossal hill equally resembled it. One, in his eagerness to be the
saviour of the party, would call out. &quot;Here it is&quot; and
cause the rest to concentrate there before he ascertained that his
discovery was a straggling shrub or a heap of roly polies. This
circumstance was treated jocularly at first, but its repetition
became exasperating.</p>
<p>I believe we found everything in the neighbourhood, including
rabbit burrows, before we struck the vehicle. This happy event was
brought about by a man falling over a clump of saltbush; he bumped
so hard that the horses jumped and the rattle of the traces
directed another man to the place.</p>
<p>The driver came in for some abuse&mdash;in asides&mdash;that
night. Not for losing the road, but for leaving the team. The road
across many level expanses was often invisible in daytime; it had
been buried in a duststorm or blown away into the next State. A 20
mile plain, bare as a claypan, and showing no sign of a wheel mark,
had to be crossed by dead reckoning. I like a wide road, but one
that is 20 miles wide is a little too extensive.</p>
<p>On these far tracks the traveller noticed here and there a
candle box or a biscuit tin nailed to a tree. There might be no
habitation visible from the road, but somebody lived not far away,
somewhere through the timber or over the hills; and that
receptacle, placed convenient for the coach driver, was the family
mailbox, in which letters and papers were posted and delivered.
Much else at times was deposited there besides mail matter. Mrs.
Smith, for instance, sent along a sample of her birthday cake, or a
jar or two of some jam she had made, to a distant friend. It was
the custom, too, among settlers that when one killed a beast a
fresh joint was sent to the nearest neighbour. Fresh meat was rare,
for a beast, even half a beast, lasted an ordinary family a long
while. So a joint from time to time was appreciated.</p>
<p>On some of the long stretches between boxes there were spots
well known to the coach driver, which were marked only with a
little bridle track running off at right angles to the coach road.
Here the mail girl was met with. Sometimes she was riding,
sometimes she drove down in a sulky or a single buggy. Almost
invariably she was waiting at the spot when the coach arrived,
either sitting on a horse, her hat tied down over her ears, or
sitting on a log or by the road side. Here and there two mail girls
met at the same spot, arriving from opposite directions. Sometimes
a little romance was interwoven in those trips for the
mail&mdash;when the party from the opposite way chanced to be a
young man. The trips were longer then, perhaps, and longer, too,
seemed the intervals between the Coach days.</p>
<p>&quot;The returning exiles!&quot; Said a passenger, in allusion
to himself and companions, as the coach extended the dull, grey
miles behind us, and the veil of haze was drawn over the austere
face of Tongowoko and its neighbouring counties.</p>
<p>The people of the eastern, southern and northern regions were
wont to style that part the Gates of Purgatory, and term its
inhabitants the exiles of Outback. But the speaker was not as happy
as a stranger to that land of suprises would have expected; and one
of the returning exiles, a lady, was crying&mdash;crying because
she was leaving for ever the pregnant, brooding spaces where the
sun goes down. They had gone to that corner to make money, with the
intention of getting out of it again as speedily as possible; and
subtly, unconsciously, the place had gripped them. Not with joy,
but with a pang of regret, they saw the glinting rock-caps at Mount
Browne disappear behind the obscuring curtain.</p>
<p>A more striking contrast to the cold, green isles beyond the
Atlantic could hardly be imagined; yet English, Irish and Scots
were scattered all over it, a great many of them in a position to
purchase an estate in their native land, and to live well on the
interest of their money for the rest of their days. But you
couldn't drag them out of it. Australians, too, who had tasted the
sweets of the coastal climbs, turned back, in spite of all the
disadvantages, to that siren with the austere countenance, and
burning tresses.</p>
<p>We said as much to the man who had called us &quot;the returning
exiles,&quot; and he closed the argument by saying they were mad.
Two years afterwards he was carrying between Wilcannia and Warri
Warri&mdash;the extreme corner; and carrying out there was about
the most trying occupation he could have engaged in.</p>
<p>As a rule, the settler is a stickler for home. Many a one of
middle age has never seen a train or a ship; many a one who has
grown up and reared a family has never been 50 miles away from the
selection where he was born; and there are old men in plenty in the
heart of Australia, and nearer, who have never looked upon the sea.
Though there are roving spirits among them, the average, even when
in search of work, keep within certain limits like their native
crows. When they go droving, on a journey of several hundred miles,
they make straight for their old haunts on being paid off. At the
same time there may be nothing to call them back but familiar
squattages where they have worked, or a few mates they had worked
with; no fixed home and no kindred, and never a pair of bright eyes
to induce them to &quot;turn their greys once more to the
south&quot;&mdash;or the west.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br>
Social Life in the Backblocks.</h2>
<p>If you are nobody in the social world, and want to rise from
obscurity now and again for a change, live in the
backblocks&mdash;live at Milparinka, the place that has become a
synonym in New South Wales for the outermost limit.</p>
<p>In big towns only people of distinction, people in high
positions, and those who have gained renown by accident, influence
or merit, are deemed worthy of mention in the social columns of the
big newspapers. The doings of our leading society women, of the
butterflies of fashion, are chronicled, however insignificant; and
mostly they pertain to weddings, engagements, receptions, dog
parties, and flitting from place to place. When Mr. Smith-Jones
retires from duty, or departs for a new field of activity, he
receives a eulogistic notice; and particulars of his send-off and
the select circle who took part in it, or were among those present,
are duly published; also Mrs. Smith-Jones' dress is described to
the minutest detail when she graces the ballroom or the lawn at
Randwick. Her housemaid may be more attractive; but that obscure
young person is only noticed when she falls down stairs with extra
violence, or narrowly escapes drowning while surf bathing. Neither
is the engagement of Bill, the boundary rider, to the cook at Wild
Dog Hotel referred to in print. He receives no flattering
publicity, even when he marries the girl, though a bush wedding is
often a highly interesting function. Bill is only mentioned when he
breaks his neck, or does something equally disastrous to himself or
to somebody else. If, however, Bill came into a fortune, eloped
with an heiress, or discovered a gold mine, the amount of
advertisement he would receive all at once would make him
blush.</p>
<p>In the country town distinctions are less rigidly drawn. An
outbreak of snobbery only brings humiliation on the snob.
Everybody's weddings are noticed in the local paper, and every
bride, whatever her station in life, looks charming. The only
difference is that the squatter's daughter gets more space than is
allotted to pretty little Mary whose father helps to keep the roads
in repair. An old resident of any decree is worthy of half a column
or more when he dies. If he dies in an uncommon or sensational
fashion, the editor rejoices, and spreads himself on the lamented
demise. Even the dairyman gets a sympathetic paragraph when he
loses Strawberry, though Strawberry may not have been any thing
like a prize cow. There also Constable X. is a highly-esteemed
citizen, whose movements are recorded with a laudatory pen. If,
further, it becomes necessary to refer frequently to the lapses of
the town drunk, it is done more in sorrow than in anger. The lives
of the people are closely intermingled, and as the population to
the square mile grows less the inhabitants merge more on a plane of
equality.</p>
<p>The social life in these primeval parts is not a joy to those
who have been used to the mad whirl and gaiety of cities. At first
some aspects of it are amusing and entertaining; there is a
freshness, novelty and picturesqueness about it all that pleases
and thrills; but that soon wears off, and leaves behind it an
atmosphere of deadly dullness. The bushman and the bush maid are
not conscious of any dullness; they haven't time, and their lives
are too busy to know the meaning of ennui. In their natural element
there is much to exercise the mind that is meaningless to the
visitor.</p>
<p>The main events in the way of public entertainments are the
grass-fed races, the hospital ball, and the cricket match. Some
times there is a blackfellows' corroboree. For the rest, home
resourcefulness and neighbourly cooperation keep the ball rolling
in a spasmodic fashion. In a widely scattered community, afternoon
tea parties are hardly possible. When one family visits another
they set out early in the morning, and return late in the evening.
At squattages visitors arrive at any time between midday and
midnight, and stay till next morning; sometimes they stay a week.
Among humbler folk, horses and vehicles are the means of
locomotion, though many walk. They walk five or six miles for a few
hours' gossip, or to attend a dance; they often walk miles after a
horse before they start on their day's trip. Almost every gathering
or function that eventuates demands a long walk.</p>
<p>What great walkers were the old bush mothers&mdash;the mothers
we knew on the rivers where the big scrubs grew, when settlers were
hewing daylight into the tangled vegetation and making initial
clearances in the dense forests! What few horses the settlements
boasted of were generally in the use of the men, and there was
seldom a vehicle in their possession other than a heavy dray, which
was mostly wanted for more necessary purposes than pleasure
driving. Many farmers at the beginning had to be content with a
slide. This at times was used as the family carriage, on which they
glided over the landscape to town or to a neighbour's place; but,
as a rule, when paying calls the women walked.</p>
<p>When, one decided to go visiting, she started away after
breakfast, with all the children in tow. There was an odd one who
got lost, and another who tramped for hours up and down hills and
gullies in search of the friend's house. Here and there they had to
take their boots off to get over a wet patch and to ford a running
stream. By-and-bye those streams were spanned by a log. The
visitors made themselves presentable when near the friend's house,
and arrived in time for lunch. Soon after lunch it was time to
start back. A strenuous visiting day like that was not a weekly
event.</p>
<p>The bush dance is one of the most frequent socials in far-out
parts. It is a cheerful factor in the introduction of young
couples, in the development of acquaintances, and the ripening of
friendships. Nearly all the dances are distant outback, except to
one or two families. If the girl doesn't possess a horse and
saddle, it is the young man's duty to bring the necessary outfit
with him when he calls for her. She will ride 20 miles to a dance
after doing a hard day's work; and after dancing all night ride
home in the shivering dawn and go straight to work again. She will
also walk a good many miles under similar conditions when a horse
is not available, over gullies and ridges, here and there through
mud and water, carrying her precious ball dress and her dancing
shoes in her hands.</p>
<p>The occasions for such communal gatherings are many and varied.
It may be somebody's birthday, somebody's golden wedding, or an old
resident may be leaving the district; there is a dance when a young
couple gets married, and a house-warming when their home is built.
The housewarming is a custom that introduces newcomers at once to
everybody in the neighbourhood. Sometimes a christening is seized
upon as an excuse for a dance; and always when a long-absent member
of a family returns, when a school is erected, and when someone
comes in for a modest fortune, there is a gathering of the clans.
Then there is the &quot;harvest home;&quot; and when nothing at all
is happening in the locality a dance is held to relieve the
monotony.</p>
<p>Where houses are far apart, and a young man, who has been
casually attracted by a pair of bright eyes, hasn't excuses for
calling at her place frequently, the bush dance is a happy medium.
Not that excuses are scarce. He calls on all sorts of pretences by
way of cultivating a desirable acquaintance. One day he has lost
his dog which he has taken the precaution to tie up in the scrub;
another day he reports that some of her father's cattle are out (he
probably let the sliprails down the night before); but his
favourite trick is borrowing things he doesn't want, the returning
of which provides with a legitimate excuse for calling again.</p>
<p>A good example of the intrepid swain who would see his girl at
any cost was Captain John Slyney, one of the old coastal
identities, who knew the north-eastern rivers in the romantic days
of the fifties. In his youth he was a farmer, and farmers' hours
were from daylight till dark. On Sundays he had to mind cockatoos
and hunt wallabies. For all that, he got some recreation.
&quot;Girls were very scarce then,&quot; he would remark
reminiscently, &quot;and it was nothing for a young fellow to walk
25 or 30 miles to see one of them.&quot; There were no bicycles or
motor launches for rapid transit then; so he and a youthful
neighbour took turn about with the wallabies and cockatoos so that
they would have time alternately to go courting.</p>
<p>Another strenuous courtship was that of a young boatbuilder on
the Richmond River . He built a little boat for himself, and in
this he used to pull 10 miles after he knocked off work on Saturday
to see his girl. Then he had to take her for a row. The return
journey commenced on Sunday night, and, bar accidents, he got back
in time to begin work on Monday morning. This continued for two
years; then a rival, who settled within easy reach of the girl,
carried off the prize.</p>
<p>The backblocker has at least an advantage in the cost of his
courting. In the cities courting is expensive. In the backblocks it
can be carried on to any length of time without overtaxing the
means of the poorest. Bill's sweetheart expects to be taken to
sports and entertainments; but these don't make much of a gap in
the year's income. He can buy her a saddle, which will be a useful
asset after marriage, for the same amount as the cityite expends on
a couple of motor rides, and that sums up all his travelling
expenses. He doesn't travel anyway extensively; most times he is
quite content to sit on a log with his arms round her lissome
waist, both sharing the mutual feeling that their life is as one
blissful Eden.</p>
<p>A lady visitor to a backblock squattage is apt to get a slight
shock at first. No strict formalities are observed; there is an
unconventional air about everything, and a confidential good
fellowship existing between mistress and servants, between boss and
men. The evenings are devoted to indoor games, private theatricals,
music and singing; and if Jim the stockman has a good voice he will
probably add something to the success of the entertainment. In her
wanderings about the homestead, or farther afield, every man she
meets will speak to her, and he will be grievously offended if she
does not return the greeting, though they may never have seen each
other before. The good comradeship that prevails among all classes
soon infects her, and thaws the icy reserve that she arrives with.
She enters into the enjoyment of quite a new social world, the
freshness and freedom of which make some amends for what it lacks
in frequency of entertaining incidents.</p>
<p>Her first introduction to the tennis court will be among her
liveliest recollections. One that occurs vividly to me was a court
near the border, which had wire-netting stretched permanently
across the centre. It was a Saturday afternoon, and players were
drawn impartially from house and hut. Among the lady players were
two young gins, both dressed in pink prints, their hair tied with
blue ribbon; and among the gentlemen were a half-caste and a full
blooded aborigine, both attired in spotless white. These two
stockmen were the smartest and most expert players on the
ground.</p>
<p>The picnic party is a common form of enjoyment, and it is much
the same old picnic that we see everywhere. Barke's Hole, on Koopa
Creek, where the explorers died is a favourite picnicking ground,
where families gather periodically from many miles around. The
night picnic used in be a great joy to me when I was a boy. That
was down on the eastern side. Our house and the next stood about
three miles apart. Midway between them was a small lagoon, where
the two families met about sunset, the men to fish, the women to
talk, the children to play. This kind of social gathering,
combining business with pleasure, took place occasionally on bright
summer nights, when indoors was uncomfortably hot, while outside
was fresh and cool and fragrant.</p>
<p>On a carpet of soft couch grass by the lagoon, the parties set
their baskets. The men got to work at once with their lines, whilst
the elder children were put to gathering a pile of wood. A fire was
made where the women sat minding the toddlers. The day birds had
disappeared by this, and from somewhere in the darkening distance
came the haunting cry of the mopoke. Beetles came aeroplaning into
the firelight, and huge moths dropped with singed wings, to be
eagerly pounced on by youngsters squatting near the blazing
sticks.</p>
<p>I was one of the wood-gatherers then, and I remember that camp
most for the cheery chirp of the crickets in the grass, the scent
of flowering rushes, and the howls of dingoes that came at long
intervals with weird and lonely cadence from beyond a spotted gum
ridge.</p>
<p>For awhile there was darkness, until the moon rose above the
trees. Then the youngsters left the fireside to chase 'possums. Now
and again their hunting and playing were interrupted by a splash
and a thud at the lagoon edge, and they dashed down to see what
sort of a marine prize &quot;father&quot; had captured. Sometimes
the splash was made by waterfowl. Ducks and other night wanderers
came swooping down into the water, to fly off again in sudden alarm
on discovering the intruders.</p>
<p>About 10 o'clock the billies were boiled. Then wood was heaped
on the fire, and all sat down to supper on the grass. Here the men
told about the big ones they had lost, and of pleasant nights in
other places which the scene recalled.</p>
<p>That picnic had more charm for us than a picnic in the day, when
the summer heat only made one wish to get into the lagoon and stop
there. There was a beauty and an alluring glamour also in the bush
summer night that was irresistible. There was, besides, a touch of
the camp life which children love, and which their elders had
recourse to as a wholesome change from the everlasting house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br>
The Home of the Duststorm&mdash;The North West
Plains&mdash;&quot;Looking for Thunder Storms&quot;&mdash;Some
Notable Waterholes.</h2>
<p>From The Corner to Broken Hill, from Yulpunga to Bourke this
great triangle, the Cinderella of the State, is the home of the
duststorm, the place where the monsoon revels in all its might and
glory. Samples of real estate are blown up from these western
plains, and distributed over the continent, and rained into two
oceans. Red sand that has been swept up hereabouts and from farther
out, after being borne a thousand miles overland, has fallen on
ships many leagues away from land. The country is mostly flat,
thinly grassed in dry summers, and the loose surface soil is torn
away and lifted to form the immeasurable clouds that wreck havoc
and misery where they rain, leaving the ground scarred and swept as
though it had been washed by a strong flood.</p>
<p>Sometimes the storms are gathering for days, and you see the sky
overcast with a muggy or reddish glare, and secretly dread the
coming blast. Yet as it appears here, it is a magnificent sight.
The enormous banks of dust come whirling and whizzing across the
country, like rolling folds upon folds of storm clouds bowling over
the landscape and seeming to touch the very heavens in the mighty
wall that obscures &nbsp; everything. Before this wall the air is
quite clear; there are no leaders, whiffs or puffs to indicate that
the splendid, convulsive columns are formed of dust. It is at times
appalling in its magnitude and fearful grandeur. Suddenly your
world is plunged into darkness; you see nothing; feel only the
sting of the driving sand against your hands and face. Your
nostrils and eyes are filled; you are blinded and suffocated, and
tears stream from your eyes. Your horse turns from the blast, and
cattle turn and drive you before them. You are helpless; you can
only lie down flat, in a deep gully if possible, and let it sweep
over you. It is gone in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Three of us were one afternoon holding a mob of sheep on a plain
when a dust storm came on to us. It was not a very heavy one, but
blinding. We continued to ride round what we supposed to be the
sheep, shouting at intervals, and thanking our stars that they were
giving so little trouble. When the storm had passed we found that
we had two old, partially-blind ewes; the mob had disappeared into
the timber two miles across the plain.</p>
<p>On another occasion we were caught near an excavated tank. The
latter was deep, and had but little water in it. The cloud looked
like a colossal mountain being removed bodily, reaching as far as
we could see east and west, its top lost in limitless space. As it
swept towards us, in countless spinning folds like living monsters
gambolling and rolling over each other, we left our horses, and
rushed down into the tank, where we lay under a rain of sand until
the desert demon had passed.</p>
<p>The now-defunct &quot;Sturt Recorder,&quot; of Milparinka, gave
the experience of a couple of men in that same storm. &quot;For
half an hour it was darker than the darkest night,&quot; said one.
&quot;I was holding a grey horse by the bit, and could not see him.
After he got away from me I lay flat down on the batter of a tank,
and tried several times to see my hand only a few inches from my
face, but could discern nothing.&quot; The other man related:
&quot;My mate and I took shelter in a tent, and lit a candle, but
for a minute or two we could not even see the light, and for some
time, were unable to see each other, notwithstanding the candle was
still burning.'</p>
<p>Almost anywhere west of Broken Hill you would find trees
standing on the ends of their roots, the soil having been swept
from under them. Here and there you saw a few inches of the tops of
a fence that had been buried, and the boundary rider told you that
there was a second fence under it, and sometimes another under
that, the three fences having been erected one on top of the other,
and successively buried by drifting sand. On many runs men were
following fences with shovels, occasionally with teams and scoops,
all through the summer, breaking up the hard banks and scattering
the stuff through the wires, so that the wind would carry it on. It
was remarkable, considering the penetrating propensity of this fine
sand, that a single wire a foot or even two feet off the ground
would cause a bank of sand to gather till the wire was covered.
Netting fences were buried very quickly.</p>
<p>In other places, instead of fences being buried, we found the
ground cut away from under the posts till they toppled over. I have
seen a couple of chains of fencing lying flat at a stretch, from 18
to 20 inches of earth being carried away to get under the posts.
Where the ground was very hard the earth round the uprights had
been whisked out by strong winds, leaving them toppling in all
directions. It was rather a difficult task to erect a permanent
fence in such localities.</p>
<p>Ploughs and scoops had to be used round some of the houses to
prevent the doors and windows being blocked up. Sand brakes were
built at tanks, wells and troughs, and some of the homesteads were
walled in. A strong wire fence was first run round, then brush or
cane-grass was woven among the wires so as to form a substantial
wall eight or ten feet high. It was far cheaper in the long run to
thus fortify your house against the besieging dry storms than to be
eternally removing the sandhills they dropped down at your doors.
At Morney Plains Q. L. a new drafting yard that cost &pound;500 was
entirely buried at the end of 1901. That was the sultry year we
left the north west .</p>
<p>Conaulpie Downs, near the Queensland border, was a typical
western homestead. It had a retaining wall on the northern side,
and clumps of trees to protect it on the other sides. It was a
fairly substantial wooden building with iron roof, the ceiling and
walls being lined with hessian, and papered. After a big storm
nothing in those rooms could be seen for dust. It could be gathered
in handfuls off tables and beds, and shaken in showers from
curtains. One visitation during my stay there was so severe that
men had to shovel the dust off the floors into barrows and wheel it
away. During the same summer the ceilings of two rooms broke down
with the weight of dust that had collected above them.</p>
<p>In other houses one noticed bulges in the canvas ceilings,
showing where little hillocks of sand had gathered on top. Where
the ceilings were painted or whitewashed, sewn-up slits in the
canvas were noticeable, showing where a knife had been thrust in to
run off the sand. Wooden ceilings gathered sufficient weight in
time to render them dangerous if not relieved of the pressure. No
building was free from the penetrating dust. It got into every
crevice and corner. Wherever air could enter it carried the
nuisance with it. Imagine then the cleaning up after a big
blow&mdash;and big blows happened along frequently through the
summer.</p>
<p>I rode up to a tank one day immediately after a storm, and found
about a hundred rabbits groping blindly about near the water. They
had been caught there while drinking, and were unable to get away.
They blinked helplessly at me, their eyes being dammed up with a
circular ridge of wet sand, moistened with their own tears. In the
same way sheep were blinded, and before they could recover, ravens
pounced on them, clinging to their necks, and pecked their eyes
out. I have seen stockmen, boundary-riders and travellers wash
their horses' eyes with water from their canvas bags, and when no
water was at hand they wiped the animals' eyes with their
handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>The maps showed numerous watercourses over this area, but like a
good many of the lakes shown in other parts, they were merely
depressions in the landscape. A heavy fall of rain would cause a
roaring flood in any of them. Often the water spread over the flat
country in an unbroken sheet for 30 miles or more; but in a week it
had all vanished. The winding dark lines of timber looming across
the plains looked promising, but a man might perish of thirst
following the courses in search of a pothole. There was plenty of
water underground, but a reservoir that had to be tapped with a
boring plant wasn't much good to a thirsty traveller</p>
<p>&quot;Looking for thunderstorms&quot; was a common phrase out
west. Stockmen rode out day after day (when weather conditions had
been favourable), looking for tracks of wet storms, and following
them across the runs. When any holes or tanks on a storm's course
had received a few days' supply sheep were at once shifted on to
them, only to be removed on to the track of another storm, perhaps
many miles away, a week later. The tracks of these storms, were
often not more than half a mile wide, and it was one of the most
tantalising experiences of western squatting to see storm after
storm cross the parched runs and miss every hole and tank upon
them, while filling a long chain of claypans between. These
claypans next day presented the surface of miniature lakes, and a
couple of days after, the bare depressions showed hard and white
under a blistering sun. An alluring mirage hovered over each one,
like a body of water, until the horseman drew near; then it lifted,
to appear again at the next.</p>
<p>Cattle, viewed through the everlasting haze of the plains,
looked like giraffes, elongated monstrosities that seemed to hover
on a shadowy surface several feet above the earth. Sheep assumed
the proportions of oxen, and the whole atmosphere appeared to be
filled with films of dancing, shimmering silk. Distances were hard
to gauge; horsemen disappeared at no great distance on open plains.
You saw something coming towards you, but until quite close you
could not tell whether it was a footman or a camel, an emu or a
bullock team; for all objects seemed to float, sometimes to within
speaking distance, till the haze flitted beyond them when they
resumed their normal shape and dimensions.</p>
<p>Almost the only natural hole of water that had any claim to
permanency in the extreme north-west was that known as Depot Glen,
in Evelyn Creek. It was also called Sturts' Waterhole. Fish were
fairly plentiful in this water, consequently it was a great camping
ground of the aborigines. This was the place that Captain Sturt had
the good fortune to strike in the summer of 1844, when the whole
country was sun-scorched, barren and gaping, and where Surveyor
Poole, the second in command, left his bones. Sheltering the grave
was a tree bearing the inscription, &quot;J.P., 1845,&quot; which
was cut by a member of the party. A pyramidal headstone, erected by
Mr. Lang, of Mount Poole, also marked the resting-place of the
first white man buried in that corner of the State. The place where
Sturt had his underground dwelling was shown by an indentation a
few yards from it. Rocky Glen, half a mile away, was a beautiful
spot. Mount Poole was marked on the summit by a pyramidal cairn,
which was built by the explorers.</p>
<p>Sturt had expected to find here a vast inland sea, and the
remains of the boat he brought with him to sail across it were
still treasured at the homestead. Had he crossed Mount Poole in the
rainy season, and seen in place of the endless stony plains an
expanse of brown water extending away to the horizon, he would have
thought for awhile that he had really found the sea; he would have
sailed upon it, only to find the water disappear from under him in
a few hours. Nevertheless, scientific men who examined the country
were convinced that a turbulent, permanent sea once actually
existed there, Sturt was only a thousand years or so too late with
his boat.</p>
<p>Delalah and Yantarn counties have several small lakes, as
Gultamuleha, Balwarry, Yantara, and the Salt Lake ; while Bulloo
Lake, the largest in that region, is only a short distance from the
latter. It is the headquarters and the great breeding-place of the
western waterfowl. Boulka Lake and Cobham Lake look well on the
map, dotted right in the north-west comer of New South Wales, where
a lake is a greater desidera than a gold mine. The
&quot;Corner&quot; is an auriferous field, which has borne a goodly
population of dryblowers and fossickers for many decades; with a
lasting wet lake ever throwing white caps to the shimmering haze,
little Tibooburra and Milparinka might blossom info fine
cities.</p>
<p>I had heard a lot of talk of Cobham Lake. To people along the
western border of Queensland, hundreds of miles away, the name was
as familiar as Broken Hill. Naturally I expected to find something
special in the way of lakes. I was disappointed. The lake was
there, but it had no water in it.</p>
<p>The oldest inhabitant said it was the first time it had ever
been known to go dry. He said it sorrowfully, bitterly, seeming to
regard it as an old friend who had gone back on him. He had so long
crowed over his fellow-patriarchs of Depot Glen; he had often said:
&quot;Pooh! Look at Cobham!&quot; when the other fossils had
praised his own pond, that he felt disgraced and humiliated. His
dignity was injured; his pride was wounded; his prestige was
ruined; his spirit was broken. Cobham had fallen from its grand
eminence to a second-rate waterhole. It might rise to greater
magnificence than ever in the next wet season, but it could never
recover its good name. It wasn't permanent. Depot Glen had beaten
it; and henceforth for all time Depot Glen was the boss waterhole.
Worse than that, the ancient resident of the place wrote to inquire
how the fish were biting in his claypan. he wished he had died
before such ignominy had come upon him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br>
The Advent of the Overseer&mdash;Yarns by the Way.</h2>
<p>We picked up a squattage overseer at Wonnaminta, which was
another celebrated waterhole, and before we had been long in his
company we wished that he had died too.</p>
<p>Learning that we were bound south and east, he asked:
&quot;Going to see the Duke?&quot;</p>
<p>Our acquaintances all down the road had asked us that question.
We had been told the pedigree and history of the whole royal family
before we started; and we were rather tired of the Duke. Besides,
this person was a Londoner, loyally enthusiastic, and we scented a
long harangue on the subject. No one was more weary of it than John
Jovius Muggs, and it was John Jovius who took up the cudgels on
behalf of the company.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that what they call him?&quot; asked Mr. Muggs.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course! What else would you call him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dunno. Mostly heard them called Jumbo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why&mdash;what are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The new elephant.&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer roared. He thought that a great joke.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; he said, in a superior condescending
sort of manner, &quot;I'm speaking of the Duke of York.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Racehorse?&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer laughed again, but not so much. John Jovius never
relaxed a muscle.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prince of Wales' son,&quot; the overseer explained.
&quot;Haven't you heard of his visit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where's he from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From England! Where in the name of heaven are you
from?&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer was getting exasperated. John Jovius kept an
unwavering eye on him all the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Relation of yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Relation be dashed! Don't I say&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what are you going down to see him for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ain't everybody going to see him! Why, they're paying
&pound;20 for a balcony view of the show&mdash;the
procession!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is he a freak?&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, d---- it! . . . .He was becoming apopletic. &quot;God bless
my soul&mdash;what could put that silly notion into your
head?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You say they're showing him at &pound;20 a
balcony?&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer collapsed. He was red, perspiring, and choking, and
when we laughed he thrust his head through the window and studied
the scenery. But we hadn't heard the last of the overseer yet. We
got on to a bit of heavy road where a recent storm had passed, and
this reminded John Jovius of an incident on the Richmond River.</p>
<p>&quot;A storm caught me in the bush, and I was riding along in
heavy rain when I came upon a man sitting on a log, stark naked,
and holding a horse with no saddle on it. 'What are you up to?' I
says, to him. 'Havin' a shower bath.' he says, grinning. 'Where's
your clothes?' He tapped the log. 'In there.' 'What did you put
them in there for.' 'Cause there wasn't room for me to get in, an'
it's only a fool's game, gettin' 'em wet in a shower; so I peeled
off. See.' When the rain was over he dressed and saddled up, and
rode away as dry as a bone. I was drenched to the skin.&quot;</p>
<p>This revived the overseer. He could cap that yarn. He opened his
shoulders at once, and narrated:</p>
<p>&quot;I was out horse hunting one day, when a storm came on, and
I crawled into a hollow log for shelter. My cattle-pup came after
me, and coiled up on my legs. The storm lasted a good while, and I
fell asleep. While I was that way a carpet snake came in and
swallowed the pup. In searching for a warm place for a nap it took
a couple of coils round my legs. At this point there came in a wet
and dripping bandicoot. The snake promptly seized and swallowed
him, too. Now, these animals made a considerable bulge at each end
of that snake, and as the intervening portion of its body was round
my legs; it could go neither forward nor backward, and the effort
to get the bandicoot down to the pup resulted in my legs being
bound tightly together. In this predicament I woke, and though I
risked being bitten, I was too tightly jambed by the coil and the
protuberances to force a way out. Not having a knife if seemed
evident that I must lie there until either the pup or the bandicoot
digested.</p>
<p>&quot;But I hadn't seen the worst of things yet. Towards noon a
goanna crawled in and swallowed my right foot and part of the leg;
and by-and-bye its mate came along and swallowed the other foot and
leg. Having strong boots on, the only inconvenience I experienced
was a feeling of tightness. But the question presented itself:
Would my feet digest in the goannas before the pup or bandicoot was
assimilated in the snake?</p>
<p>&quot;I was debating that point when there came a sound of
chopping, and half an hour later a big tree soused down on the head
end of my log, splitting it from end to end. I escaped with sundry
bruises, several small cuts, and much shock. Two axemen stood by
the stump. When they saw me suddenly arise from the debris, girdled
with a bulged snake and goanna extremities, they belted for their
lives. I shook the snake off without any trouble: but to get free
of the goannas I had to tie their tails to a sapling and run
backwards.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence for live minutes after the overseer
concluded. Then a quiet man, who had been dozing in a corner, sat
up and remarked drily that the yarn wasn't rounded off properly.
The overseer looked at him disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Those goannas should have untied themselves and swallowed
the snake, one from each end,&quot; said the quiet man; &quot;and
when they met in the middle they should have had a fight and
swallowed each other. That would have been a clean finish.&quot;
The overseer turned to the window again, and became absorbed in the
grey embankments of a huge excavated tank.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br>
The Land of Tanks.</h2>
<p>When you travel over the great western country, with the
solitary question of water in your mind (and you don't want a piece
of string tied round your finger to keep it slipping from your
memory), you realise the grim, dogged fight that has been made by
the men who have settled there. Thousands of creeks and gullies
vein this region, just the same as in other parts; but they are
treacherous affairs to the stranger, who is lured by the promising
lines and clumps of timber to search for potholes, such as his
&quot;inside&quot; experience leads him to expect. There are
rivers, too, draining vast areas of one State, and moistening
hundreds of miles of another. They start far north with a roaring
flood, and are exhausted and lost in the immensity of their
travels, or they end their long journey with a brown trickle that
creeps into the Darling or Murray. When settlers along the upper
reaches of eastern rivers are flooded, warning is sent to those far
down to prepare for the coming rush; but the people at the lower
end of the outback waterways only hear casually that a big flood
has happened above them. Though it may sweep grandly for a couple
of hundred miles, only now and again do they expect it to run in
their part of the course. The great plain awaits it with parched
lips. Thirstily, greedily, it drinks up the river.</p>
<p>The great bulk of the inland drainage courses underground, down
the ever flowing subterranean channels. When you look at the
surface courses after a dry storm, you cannot but think that any
other kind of river is impossible without some gigantic scheme of
afforestation. To the small settler, who wants to wet his whistle
in a hurry, the underground river is hopeless. Still, he goes out,
and prospers. One whom I knew well, after working for some years on
the roads with a team, took up a dry selection in the Corner,
starting with a few sheep. He passed in his checks in 1909, leaving
to his widow and children a well watered estate and &pound;32,000
in cash. He was a canny Scot. All he did to make his pile was to
put down a couple of tanks in the midst of timber. Most western
graziers made their tanks in the sun-baked, windswept open, so that
the sheep, after drinking, wouldn't camp round the tank. Both sheep
and tank suffered in consequence.</p>
<p>&quot;Death's Corner&quot; and &quot;Hell's Gate&quot; were not
terms applied to the Big Basin by thirst-tortured travellers from
inside. The great, deceiving distances, the sun-glitter on the
stones, the mocking mirages, and the apparent barrenness of
everything around, are heart-breaking to the peddler and the
swagman. But they get a grip of the immense possibilities of that
territory when they know that, after years of drought, fat sheep
have been obtained there when they could not be got anywhere else.
The main stays of the land are mulga and saltbush. In fair seasons
Mitchell grass grows like wheat. Cut and stored, it is as good as
oaten hay. It is better, for the haymaker has not to plough or
sow&mdash;he merely reaps. When the grass is in ear, he drives his
machine across the plain, and within a few hours the
&quot;cut&quot; is ready to stack. The hay has been found to be
sweet and fattening after being stacked for 20 years. There is no
trouble about feed. The great problem is water. You daren't ride a
few miles out on the run without taking a bag of it with you, or
the chances are there will be a funeral, and you'll be in it.</p>
<p>When the &quot;insider&quot; goes on the land, the first thing
he does is to put up a hut; but when the westerner goes on to his
block the first thing he has to do is to make a water hole. That is
the most important and the most valuable improvement he can make.
His wealth is reckoned and his status in the community determined
by the number of waterholes he has. In putting down his first he
has to choose his time; when rain has left a pothole within reach
to supply him and his teams with liquid refreshment. Then it is a
race between the sinking of the tank and the sinking of the water.
When the hole is completed he goes away, to wait till the next rain
comes and fills it. Then he may return and build his home. It is a
big undertaking for the small man, but once he has amassed
waterholes he can sit back and live comfortably on the
interest.</p>
<p>Most of the work while we were there was done by contract. In
earlier days tank sinkers reaped a rich harvest, getting a shilling
a yard for excavation which was now being done for as low as 4d.
The landowner found the plant&mdash;horses, ploughs, scoops and
harness. Bullocks were sometimes used for ploughing, but as a rule
they were considered too slow, and unwieldy. Horses were worked
three and four abreast to save time in turning, and to prevent
unnecessary climbing and consequent damage to the batters. Close by
the work was a sapling yard, with grindstones, water tanks on
drays, and a small forge for pointing shares and picks and shoeing
horses. The men lived in tents or canvas huts, walled in with
bushes; and there was a long shed, walled and roofed with boughs or
cane grass for eating and cooking in, while out in front was a
fireplace, enclosed in a semi-circular wall of stones to protect it
from the wind. Round the fire, in this roofless enclosure, the men
sat and smoked their pipes and swapped yarns after tea.
Occasionally on moonlight nights they worked an hour or two at the
forge, repairing damaged swingle-bars or mounting new ones, and
making horseshoes and scoop-handles. He had to be a handy man, the
tank-sinker. On Sunday morning a tank or two of water was carted,
and a load of dry mulgar or gidgee for camp use. Besides all this,
there were broken chains to mend with split links, and horse
collars and other harness ware to attend to. The tank sinker made
hay while the sun shone, working from daylight till dark. Then the
horses were driven away to water and feed, a sheep was killed by
starlight, and now and again a bag of grass was cut and carried
home on the pommel of the saddle for the hack, which was kept in
the yard all night for running up the draught horses in the
morning.</p>
<p>Some contractors kept a bullock team constantly drawing water so
as to save the plough and scoop horses by watering them in troughs,
where they work.</p>
<p>Hard years of experience taught the flock owners many economic
points in the excavating of tanks. The open-fronted tanks, into
which everything poured unchecked, and played havoc with the
batters, were no longer made: nor was the partially banked variety
with a catch-tank in front, from which the force of the overflow
cut huge gutters through the intervening space, carrying the silt
into the main bank, or else it ploughed through the light-wings and
cut gutters down the outside of the bank. The later tanks were
banked high all round with earth scooped out of the excavation. You
saw these grey banks every now and again from the coach. The
Darling Downs, as I remember them, was a land of wells and
windmills. A part of Southern Queensland specialised in
substantially constructed overflows. In other parts, as the
northern area of South Australia, where water has a habit of
running away at short notice, the ordinary cheap variety of dam was
the common reservoir. But the north-west of New South Wales was the
land of tanks.</p>
<p>Some of the tanks were so large that you could spend hours round
them shooting ducks. A few contained yellow-belly (golden perch),
and in most of them youngsters caught crayfish or yabbies with
scoop nets or traps. A small catch-tank was made at the top end,
from which fluming was laid through the banked-up earth, having a
self-acting valve on the inside, and from this a race made of
galvanised iron, posts and rails, ran down to the bottom of the
main tank. These tanks held well if a foot of water was first run
in, and the bottom and sides were then puddled and trampled by
putting a mob of sheep in and driving them round. The great bulk of
the shifting sand was checked by the earth walls, but still a lot
got over, tons of dust being deposited during every dry storm. The
evaporation was very considerable. Roly-polies did a great amount
of damage. These huge, white balls of grass and burrs, from two to
three feet in diameter, rolled mile after mile across the plains,
banking up against fences, and completely smothering them, and
bowling down into unprotected tanks.</p>
<p>Here and there stub walls were built as a partial protection;
but these were soon buried under sand, and the roley poley took a
flying leap over them, and went gambolling on in triumph. A hundred
rolies racing across a plain in the moonlight was a weird sight; a
few score bogged in the silt round the edges of a tank meant a big
fall in the value of the reservoir.</p>
<p>Dams were made in some of the creeks. Many of them were
constructed at considerable expense, only to be swept away by the
first flood that came down. After heavy rains the water rushed down
from the rocky hills in foaming torrents, sometimes several miles
wide, levelling fences, yards, and all such structures before it.
At these times half that &quot;desert&quot; country presented the
aspect of a vast inland sea; yet in a little while a man might
perish of thirst in the creek beds. All that enormous bulk of water
has run to waste, and the four winds began to gather up the dust
again. Only the tanks, the salvation of Outback, remained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
Women of the West.</h2>
<p>One heard a lady passenger remark on the loneliness of the
aspect as the coach passed some hut or Cottage standing back from
the little-frequented road. &quot;If I had to live in a place like
that I'd die,&quot; she declared.</p>
<p>The loneliness didn't trouble the settler much, though the want
of communion with other women made it a little hard for his wife.
Still the country bred woman found the noisy city much more
distasteful. There are people who cannot be happy away from the
bustle of city streets; there are others who can find happiness
only in the quiet of the bush. So the lone cottage is not always
planted where it is because the people cannot afford to live in
closer contact with their kind. City people, judging their country
cousins by their own ideals, waste a lot of sympathy in this
respect.</p>
<p>Sydney women, despite all the comforts and conveniences that
surrounded them, and the beauty and delights of their environment,
found no end of things to grumble about and to worry over. The
thorn in the rosy path of Mrs. Potts Point was the difficulty of
getting good and reliable and inexpensive servants to do her work
for her. It was a worry to ring up the registry office every week
or two, and to find the maid not quite up to the high standard of
proficiency required when she arrived, and when the house was
temporarily maidless, to have to get one's own dinner&mdash;though
it could be purchased ready cooked, to make the family bed, and
look after the intrusive baby.</p>
<p>While, the mental eye dwelt on this good lady, fuming
impatiently at her telephone, our moving picture show, the mail
couch, introduced Madame Merino, who was preeminent among the women
of the west. Her husband was a squatter; she was therefore
comparatively free to have what she liked, provided the finances
were healthy, which depended on the seasons. Yet she was going down
for a change of sea air for the first time in five years.</p>
<p>&quot;At last!&quot; she said smilingly to the driver as she met
the coach, and the driver understood. The expression was eloquent.
She had promised herself that trip year after year, and &quot;at
last&quot; she was under weigh.</p>
<p>There were some, she told you, who made an annual pilgrimage for
the Show or the Melbourne Cup, and there were others who never left
the west. Those lived anywhere from 10 to 50 miles from a small
town; and once in a couple of moons or so they drove in for a short
visit.</p>
<p>The town was little different from the squattage. You saw a few
more people: you saw an occasional dog fight, when the outside dog
met the town dog; you heard the scant news of the countryside; you
could &quot;Come and have a drink,&quot; but the only other
attractions were the grass fed races and a ball once or twice a
year, when the little town woke up for a couple of days and a
couple of nights.</p>
<p>Madame Merino lived 200 miles from a railway terminus. The house
was built of wood and iron, with papered walls and ceilings. There
were stables and yards and huts scattered about; but away from the
homestead there were no habitations for many miles. Except in the
morning and evening, when there were men bustling around, the place
seemed in sleep. Now and again drovers went by, and teams passed
along the distant road. Occasionally there were visitors, who
arrived at any hour between daylight and midnight. They might be a
neighbouring squatter and his family, who require board and
lodgings at a moments notice; and not infrequently they dropped in
when she had no help. and was up to her eyes in work. There were no
regular &quot;at home&quot; days there; people called when it
suited them. Swagmen called between times, and in the absence of
the boss these sought &quot;the missus&quot; for rations.</p>
<p>She had a &quot;maid and general&quot; and a man cook. Sometimes
she had a governess or lady's help as well. Her nearest supply
depot was the town, 10 miles away, which supplied an odd demand at
long intervals. As a rule, she had to write to Broken Hill, or to
Adelaide, or Sydney. The first named was the cheapest for passage
money had to be guaranteed both ways. The single coach fare from
Broken Hill was &pound;6. The usual term of engagement was six
months. If the servant left before that she had to pay the return
fare out of her own pocket. With a 200 mile coach journey to face,
and a 10 mile drive, in a buggy in addition, to be &quot;bottled in
the bush&quot; for months, girls who had been used to a town life
were very chary of taking such a situation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Potts Point had the privilege of inspecting and catechizing
her maid before engaging her; but Madame Merino knew nothing about
hers until she arrived at the door with her trunk and hatbox.
Generally speaking, she was a good girl; the industrious sort, who
had a savings bank account, and who knew that the best place to
swell that account was the backblock squattage, where wages were
higher, opportunities of spending almost nil, and dress
requirements considerably diminished. Many put in a whole year
without drawing a penny of their wages. Another attraction was the
scarcity of marriageable women.</p>
<p>&quot;I prefer plain girls,&quot; said Madame, &quot;for when I
get a good looking one I know the moment she arrives that I am
spending &pound;12 to provide somebody with a wife. And she has to
be uncommonly plain if some lovelorn swain doesn't fall down and
worship her before her half year is up.&quot;</p>
<p>Then marriageable woman remained scarce, for the dull-greyness
of the general outlook more than counterbalanced the advantages.
This, too, left the way open for the domestic who was unable to
keep town places; and no matter how incompetent or now lazy she
was, she couldn't be sacked except on payment of six months' wages
and her fare both ways. It was no use quarrelling with a maid of
that sort; she could hit back with impunity: so Madame Merino had
to put up with whims and caprices and a lack of capacity that Mrs.
Potts Point would not tolerate for a day.</p>
<p>In the old days the aboriginal woman helped to smooth many a
rugged path. She made life in lonely places easier and more
pleasant to the white women. Only those who had to rely on her
industry and bush knowledge know how important a part she played,
once she was properly civilised, in the settlement of the
hinterlands. Some there were who did not care to have blacks about
the place; others would not employ an aborigine, as it frequently
meant a camp following that required something like a
boarding-house to feed. But there were a great many places, apart
from squattage homesteads, that always had a blacks' camp in the
vicinity; and everybody who desired, rich and poor alike, had
aboriginal servants.</p>
<p>The aboriginal servant was cheap&mdash;except to feed. She
carried away in her dilly-bag all she could get. She was never
selfish; if she belonged to a camp in the neighbourhood she
remembered everybody in it when there was tucker about. As a
set-off against this, she was useful in obtaining wild game, fish
and honey for her white mistress. For 5s a week and meals,
supplemented with any old clothes&mdash;whether a frock or a pair
of trousers didn't matter to her&mdash;and a bit of tobacco, she
would do anything required of her. But she was a rigid stickler for
the eight hour principle. She could not be persuaded to get up
early&mdash;except to go to the races. She arrived at the kitchen
about breakfast time, and required her breakfast&mdash;partaken of
at the woodheap&mdash;before she commenced work; then she liked to
get back to camp before dark. Always she returned with a
miscellaneous collection of titbits in her <i>vade mecum</i>, the
dilly-bag.</p>
<p>She did the washing and scrubbing; she looked after the younger
children, being a gentle and attentive nurse; and she carried
water, balancing the bucket on her head; and she carried wood also,
which she picked up with her toes. Finally she chopped up the
sticks with her tomahawk, a task which she always sat down to. She
was handy in running messages, hunting up the horses and cows, and
finding stolen nests in grass and scrub when eggs were wanted. She
instructed the white women in bushcraft, especially in turning to
use whatever nature had provided in the locality. Often she was her
mistress' only female companion, and a comradeship existed between
them that was hardly understandable among later generations.</p>
<p>To any good girl, Madame Merino was comrade and friend. She told
of a time when she reached home with one just after a duststorm.
They had experienced the blinding fury of it on the road, which was
misery enough in one dose; but the sight that met her at the
homestead filled her with dismay. Men were in the room with barrows
and shovels, cleaning out the sand. Mistress and maid worked till
midnight, dusting and sweeping; and at daylight they started again,
washing and scrubbing. When they had got all nicely clean along
came another duststorm, and everything was smothered again. They
sat down and cried, but the experience cemented a friendship that
was never forgotten.</p>
<p>It was a dry summer. In the midst of it the water gave out at
the homestead, and they shifted to an excavated tank 10 miles away.
Here they had a hessian hut, tents and bough shed, experiencing
much of the normal conditions under which the poorer class have to
live; their water carried in buckets or in an iron tank; their fire
in the open, baking done in a camp-oven, all structures and
fittings rough and temporary; no fruit nor vegetables, no milk or
butter.</p>
<p>Not far away was a selector's hut. The selector was weatherbound
down country with a team, waiting for rain to get home. His wife
and daughters were drawing water and cutting scrub for stock. In
the evening they met for friendly gossip; these hard working women
and Madame Merino and her girls; and they talked of the country
life they had known in other parts, in the great, fruitful regions
of the east and the north and the south.</p>
<p>In the homes of her city friends the gas stove, the water laid
on, the fixed tubs and copper, with a tap over each, particularly
appealed to Madame Merino. She had stood so often over the washtub
herself; that tub that has to be carried away and emptied, and
filled with the aid of buckets. There were conveniences for cooking
that were unknown in the west, though the west had double the
cooking to do. There all the baking was done at home. She did most
of her own sewing also. Yet, when she looked around her, she
considered herself fortunate in the possession of a sewing machine.
Her neighbours of the tank did all their sewing by hand, making
their own wearing apparel, sheets and pillow-slips, and the men's
shirts. Much of their furniture was made out of packing-cases,
draped with cretonne. There wasn't much in their home, but the
collection represented a prodigious amount of home-work.</p>
<p>They did not complain, these patient women of the west, though
they lived under hard conditions, buffering the torments of flies
and ants and dust and heat through the long summers, with no trains
or trams to run them away at week-ends&mdash;or month ends or
year-ends&mdash;to the seaside or to the mountains. Theirs was a
combination of the simple life and the strenuous life, but it had
its compensations. With the passing of the summer day they drifted
into Elysium; and the east, with its more humid climate, could show
nothing comparable to the starry brilliance of the western
night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br>
Glimpses of Lonely Lives.</h2>
<p>There are many lonely lives spent in the back country; none more
so than those of the mail-change groom, the shepherd, the
hut-keeper, road-mender, boundary-rider, prospector, and the
mounted police stationed alone on the outposts of civilisation. In
some such cases the billets are chosen by men who have a
predilection for a hatter's existence; but the majority are forced
by necessity to take them. The prospector is drawn into the wildest
parts by the charm of fortune. There he lives in a world of his
own, with the environment of the savage. He comes into town once a
month, or once in three months, to sell his gleanings and to obtain
fresh supplies. Between times no one may know anything of his
whereabouts, for the veteran prospector doesn't want the locale of
his operation made public.</p>
<p>The post of the mail-change groom is about the least lonely of
the lot. His home is a small hut or tent by the roadside; his only
companions a dog and the coach horses. The horses run in the open
bush, and his work is to look after them, groom and feed them, and
have them ready in the sapling yard when the coach arrives. At half
the places it arrives during the night time. He helps with the
changing, afterwards rubbing down the sweat-covered animals that
have been left. The coach passes once or twice a week, staying only
just long enough to change the horses. Between times a traveller
may call while passing along the road, and is generally welcome to
a night's rest there. It is the groom&rsquo;s only chance of a
yarn. The rouseabout gives him the news from up and down the road,
and he is a greedy man for news, too.</p>
<p>One, whom our driver called Peter, came 50 yards down the road
to meet the coach. He was short and stout, almost as broad as he
was long; his fat face three parts covered with thick, black
stubble. He was short winded; in his eyes the light of eagerness
and excitement. We thought there had been some extraordinary
happening at the camp. We leaned out to listen.</p>
<p>&quot;What won.&quot; asked Peter, breathlessly.</p>
<p>The driver named three horses that had won first, second and
third in a Mulga handicap back at the border.</p>
<p>&quot;Where did Streaker come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fair last.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter took off his hat, and slapped it against his leg.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew it,&quot; he cried ecstatically. &quot;Didn't I
tell him so? Why, the dashed cow couldn't gallop as fast as I could
kick me hat.&quot;</p>
<p>From the Mulga Handicap Peter drifted to people and places along
the road. He knew everybody for a hundred miles either way. As the
wheels began to revolve again he fired after us: &quot;Did Andy
Payne find his bullock?&quot;</p>
<p>The most trivial items interested the groom. But the driver's
time was limited. It was always limited; and every trip he left
Peter unsatisfied. However, he brought him week-old papers, and now
and again a dog-eared book, which were perused with a relish only
known to isolated beings.</p>
<p>The mender of the coach roads was some what similarly situated,
except that his work required him to be more actively about in wet
weather than in dry times. For this reason the regulations required
him to provide himself with oilskins and watertight boots. Peter
had to be out in all weathers, and nobody cared whether he had
waterproof clothing or only a bathing suit.</p>
<p>The boundary-rider, whether posted on the rabbit-proof fence
along the State borders or on the outskirts of pastoral properties
to look after the stock, to watch the watering-places, and keep the
fences in repair, is a more energetic person. Sometimes he has a
hut to live in; more often only a light tent, which keeps him dry
so long as it does not rain too hard. It is mostly pitched in a
lonely belt of gidgee or mulga trees, where firewood and water are
close at hand, and away from all roads, so that he won't be
interrupted by tourists. When his water dries up, unless he happens
to be camped at a permanent tank, he shifts his residence to the
next most convenient supply. He has no mate to share his lot,
except when scrub has to be cut for sheep, and when there is extra
work at the tanks pulling out the bogged, skinning the dead, and
generally attending to weak animals. From living so much alone he
is sometimes a trifle eccentric and particular about little
things.</p>
<p>The mounted police who patrol the great emptiness on the fringe
of settlement have a better time, though there is nothing in their
vicinity to become wildly hilarious over. The force is recruited
from experienced bushmen. One depot was at Turn Off Lagoon. The
troopers batched there for months at a time, doing their own
washing and mending. They worked a fairly large garden in their
spare time, and they had so much spare time that one year they grew
two tons of potatoes. They were glad to see anybody. The shakiest
old swagman, if one ever went so far astray, was hospitably
received. The only excitement that came their way was when a horse
thief or a cattle stealer attempted to get away to the back camps,
as those of buffalo shooters. Rogues who knew the ropes made for
those places when pursuit got too hot, returning to civilisation
when the hue and cry had long died out. The border police had to
look for them; and at times they took pack horses, riding hundreds
of miles, and camping out at night. They were in dead earnest in
their pursuit. They seldom had the opportunity of getting a
prisoner. When, they did, they not only had his company for a time
at the depot, but one of them had the pleasure of a trip with him
to a more civilised quarter. Occasionally in their wanderings, they
spent a night in a hunters camp, and once in a while they met
overlanders from the north and west. The garden told eloquently how
time dragged when they were at home; and a kangaroo skin here and
there indicated that other chases were sometimes substituted when
there were no law breakers to run down.</p>
<p>The great advantage of these lonely places lay in their
roominess. As an overlander remarked, &quot;A man's got plenty of
room there to swing his whip.&quot; And saith the hatter:
&quot;When I feel like I want to yell I can yell without wakin' the
baby.&quot;</p>
<p>The hut-keeper has only a lonely hut to look after&mdash;and
that is about the quietest and least troublesome thing a man can be
set to look after. It is such a tame, silent, monotonous charge
that only a lazy man would take it in hand. The salary is not
munificent, though quite commensurate with the labour involved. The
hut stands in a locality where it is occasionally necessary; it may
be connected with an expensive shearing-shed, or it may be a dummy
selection, or one taken over by a squatter. Anyhow, travellers pass
that way, and there is some danger of leaving it without a
caretaker between times. Of course, there may be cattle or horses
or sheep in the paddock adjoining; but these require no attention.
He may walk round the fence once a week if he feels in want of
exercise. The only time he has to put on a little steam is when the
owner calls; for the owner wants lunch, and his horses have to be
taken out, and put in again when they have had a spell. This
unwonted labour exhausts the caretaker for an hour or two, and he
stretches out on his bunk and smokes, feeling the satisfaction of a
man who has done his duty. He spends much time on that bunk. He has
a collection of old books, and keeps up a reading supply by
swopping with travellers. He has cards, too, which while away an
hour or two when a player drops in. He is not the loneliest mortal
on earth. His existence is about on a par with that of the
aborigine, only the aborigine has to bestir himself a lot more in
pursuit of a nimble dinner. The hutkeeper's billet was designed for
tired people.</p>
<p>Once, traveling from Sydney to Brisbane by boat, we passed
Solitary Island in the gloom of approaching night. The picture so
affected me that I could not have felt more depressed if I had just
lost all my ancestors; but afterwards, in lonely spots outback; the
thought of it always made me feel cheerful. To a landsman there is
no isolation so utterly dreary. The lighthouse keeper is usually a
married man, and is often provided with an assistant. Still, there
is not much excitement in his neighbourhood apart from the
wind-lashed waves at his basement. When his home is on the mainland
he has many advantages that seldom obtain on a rocky islet. The
great bush lies behind him, possessing a thousand interests to a
nature lover, and supplying him with much that a man needs. For
this is a case where even the untrodden wilderness is something to
be thankful for. It is a relief from the sea-washed rocks and the
smell of seaweed. It allows of unlimited wanderings, of rides and
drives. If there is a settler within reach he can call there
occasionally, and receive a call in return. His visits and visitors
are limited to these. Being perched on a jutting headland, no roads
pass near him that would bring even an odd swagman to his door. He
contrives to make some sort of a garden, though, as a rule, there
is not much growing soil in such situations. He has a few fowls, a
couple of cows or goats and perhaps a pig or two. There is not a
lot for those on an island such as Solitary Island.</p>
<p>Lone and exiled as ever was Robinson Crusoe is he who guards the
safety of passing ships. His work is in the loneliest night hours,
when, perched above the smashing breakers, he hears the wailing of
ghostly mariners in the gale. Solitary Island is really three huge
rocks. Two of them are all but submerged; the other carries the
lighthouse, presenting rugged shelving and precipitous facets to an
ever restless sea. Seen from the distant deck of a coastal steamer,
there is a gloom and dreariness about that spot that gives one the
blues to look at. In its eloquent silence it seems to appeal to
fleeting, glimpsed humanity. It stands far out at sea, vessels
passing between it and the mainland. At long intervals a boat sails
with supplies and mails. Sometimes in bad weather the call is
delayed, and supplies run short. There is only the encircling sea
and the fishing line to rely upon in such an emergency. When
sickness comes or an accident happens there is no way of getting a
doctor. The risks that the lighthouse keeper takes for the safety
of others are manifold; and when death comes to such places it is
in its most pathetic aspect.</p>
<p>At one lighthouse, where two families lived, the women had a
quarrel, and did not speak to one another for two years. At another
place there were three families, and these were not &quot;playing
speaks&quot; either.</p>
<p>A lighthouse on a green isle, with sandy beaches, cocoanut
palms, and banana groves, would be quite a pleasant place, however
isolated, lending itself to languorous ease and the free and
careless life of primitive races. But the beacon lights are reared
on some of the bleakest and dreariest spots in the ocean and on the
coasts, for danger, and not beauty, is the deciding factor in the
place of its abode.</p>
<p>After visiting a lighthouse one feels inclined to tell the
shepherd that he has nothing to complain about. He is usually an
old man, unfitted for hard or active work. His only assistant is a
dog, to whom he talks as to a human being. He also talks to
himself, and has got so used to doing so that he sometimes lapses
into self-confidences and solo arguments when in the presence of
others. His knowledge goes back into the dimness of ages. His
experiences cover half the earth, and encompass a multitude of
trades and callings, for, as likely us not, he has been well
launched from a big university, has been boss and lackey by turns,
school teacher, soldier, and sailor, too. With a stick in one hand
and a water bag in the other, he follows his flock all day,
returning with them to camp at sundown. It is in unfenced,
dingo-haunted country that he shepherds. A dingo raid provides
about the only excitement that comes his way. In the evening he
meditates over an open fire, and smokes the pipe of peace. He is a
great man to meditate, and the peace is profound and
everlasting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br>
The Carrier's Wife.</h2>
<p>Another who knows the loneliness of outback roads is the
carrier's wife. Whether she accompanies the teams or abides in some
centre where she sees her husband at intervals of months, her life
is not one that would be envied by those who have been used to the
ordinary customs and comforts of home.</p>
<p>Domiciled in some country town, she is very much in the position
of the sailor's wife, counting the days and watching for the coming
of the team, as the other waits and watches for the return of the
ship. But, while the sailor's wife resides at some sea port where
there is animation and something of daily interest, the other
dwells where there is little movement; where there is nothing to
see but the long road on which for days only the
&quot;willy-willy&quot; stirs up the dust; where the days are dull
and long and lonely. A town habitat, however small and dead the
town, is not as bad as a selection hut, standing back from the
road, and miles away from its nearest neighbour. Such a situation
is generally necessary for the teamster, who must have paddocks in
which to spell his weary brutes when he reaches home, and wherein
to keep them in slack times when the roads are impassable.</p>
<p>While he is absent, for months at a time, the wife is general
manager and caretaker of the estate as well as of the home. When
the heap of wood gives out, before the teams return, she has to
gather her supplies from the paddock; and, when the cask or iron
tank runs dry, she has to carry water daily from the creek. She has
to keep an eye on what stock there may be running there, and now
and again she has to repair fences, and pull out a beast that has
got bogged. Fires sometimes break out, which keep her in the
fighting line, perhaps for hours into the night. She bears the
responsibilities and anxieties that commonly fall to the lot of the
men in addition to all that are inseparably woman's. Once a week or
so she may have a visitor, and occasionally she sees a horseman
passing along the road&mdash;the road that ever attracts her eyes
like some irresistible magnet, that she watches in leisure hours,
sitting on the verandah, as though all she hoped for could come to
her by no other way. As the dusk deepens she fastens the doors and
windows, and sitting in the lamplight or by the fire, listens, as a
dog listens, to the night voices and sounds outside.</p>
<p>It is these conditions that often cause the carrier's wife to
forego the doubtful joys of a home and travel up and down the road
with a house on wheels, furnished with all that is necessary for
their convenience and comfort, in which there is no packing up and
unpacking at the daily camp, and everything is always handy. One
trip in this travelling home just for a holiday is enjoyable,
providing the roads, are good, but it soon becomes wearisome on
far-western roads.</p>
<p>Generally she travels in a tilted cart, driving along behind the
team, unless she knows the camping places, in which case she will
drive on after lunch and have the camp in order and the tea ready
by the time her husband reaches his days end. She is seldom without
family, sometimes there are four or five children, who share the
joys and adventures of the parents on the roads. The younger ones
ride with the mother in the cart; the others make themselves useful
in various ways. The oldest perhaps will be his father's help or
offsider; another will be in charge of the spare team horses or
bullocks, whilst a third will be a budding drover, whose work is to
look after a flock of goats, which supplies the family with milk
and meat, and takes them from camp to camp. They carry also a coop
of fowls slung under the waggon. These are let out for a run where
the team stops, and they roost on a perch usually provided near
their moving residence. So accustomed do the moving poultry become
to the daily routine that they are easily got back into their coop
when it is time to move on.</p>
<p>Once on the Ward River I met a party of four families, who
mustered about 15 children. Their itinerary extended from
Charleville, on the Warrego&mdash;then the terminus of the
south-western railway and a great rendevous of teamsters&mdash;to
places far beyond the Barcoo, towards Blackall and down Koopa
Creek. They went out laden with stores and returned with wool. They
were going into camp in the bend of a big lagoon&mdash;a quiet spot
where they customarily spelled for a few days. There was good
fishing and plenty of waterfowl in the lagoon, and fine grassy
downs spreading away to westward where the stock could be seen for
miles when the haze was off the plains.</p>
<p>First to arrive were two little girls and a boy, driving goats
and spare horses. Then came the women and younger children in
tilted carts. They took their own horses out, and unpacked utensils
and bedding by the side of a big log, whilst the youngsters
gathered wood and carried water. Soon fires were blazing and
cooking was in full swing. The teams drew up a little before
sundown, and what with unharnessing, belling and hobbling horses,
erecting tents, milking goats, and spreading tea things and tucker
about on bags, it was a busy scene for an hour or two after dark.
The children romped joyously about among the trees, but the women
were tired, and welcomed the respite of a few days' camp by the
lagoon.</p>
<p>There are many other men whose calling keep them a good deal of
their time away from home, and whose womenfolk lead lonely lives.
With no help within miles of their doors, they are called upon to
perform many an arduous task and to undertake emergency duties that
would appall one who had never been used to the trials of the bush.
You have only to picture one with a child seriously ill; with fires
raging around and threatening the house on a scorching summer day;
when flood waters are gradually covering the near landscape and
lapping around the rise where she lives; to understand the fears
and worries that come to her intermittently when there is no one to
counsel, to help and protect. They are among the heroines of the
bush, these brave women who help to tame the wild places and smooth
the rough tracks for the multitude.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br>
Wayfarers&mdash;Looking for Pyzer&mdash;&quot;Bail
Up!&quot;&mdash;On the Road to Menindie.</h2>
<p>A journey from the Corner gives you a fine contrast to the
travelling in coastal latitudes. For much of the way the coach
grinds over tracks of its own making, with a few chains of
macadamised road here and there; over ruts and dunes, and crooks
and gullies that rock the passengers till their bones ache; over
wind-swept plains that suggest the dead end of the world. Over the
eastern ranges, on the northern watershed, and down by the southern
sea, you have at least the charm of scenic changes, the thrill of
steep grades and sharply winding mountain tracks; but out at the
back of Bourke the way is as monotonous as the rattle of wheels and
the clinking of chains. Dinner time is occasionally an exciting
event, especially after a fast of 18 hours, which was our
experience at one stage. We had to walk a mile off the road to a
lonely hut where a robust selector, in mud-splattered clothes, just
as he had come in from a tank-sinking job, presided at table. It
being hot weather, the refreshments were provided in a bough shed,
on a long plank table, with planks for seats.</p>
<p>Through the door of the coach we obtained glimpses of the
traffic of the western roads. The ladies on the box seat had a big
advantage in this respect. They could see it coming in the far
distance, and they could look back at it till it disappeared over
the horizon behind. Did we pass a hawker's van, slowly plodding on
its day's journey to the next house, or a teamster's waggon laden
with stores or wool, the insiders leaned forward to view it as
eagerly as though it were a procession&mdash;which showed the
extent of the traffic.</p>
<p>A mob of cattle on the way to Bourke and the Afghan's camel
team, filing westward, were items of special interest. The hardy
old battler, humping his swag to Farther-out, gave a fillip to the
conversation, and made us feel more comfortable in our cramped
position; the bullock team, strenuously dragging over a sandhill,
or blocking the crossing of a creek, was a spectacle that enlivened
everybody; while a camel camp alongside the road was quite an
absorbing thing.</p>
<p>We came upon it in the early morning, while the Afghans were
still wrapped in their blankets. The driver cracked his whip, and
the insides yelled at them to get up and pay for their beds. One
remembered suddenly that he had a message for the coach. He leaped
out in a hurry, but ere he had taken three steps in our direction
the shriek of the box-seat reminded him that he had only a shirt
on. He rushed back to bed again, and covered his head up.</p>
<p>Cases and bales of merchandise lay about in heaps as they had
been dropped from the camels' backs, and here and there the desert
beasts were feeding on the mulga trees. None of them were near the
road; but the smell was there, and that was quite enough for the
coach horses. Tired though they were, they became excited, and
threatened to bolt.</p>
<p>That was a good beginning for the day; it shook the drowsiness
from our eyes, and set us watching out quite cheerfully for the
next sight. It was a long time coming, but proved the most
diverting of all when it eventually intersected us. It was a two
wheeled bullock-dray, drawn by six bullocks, with two women and
several youngsters on board. Obviously they were going
visiting.</p>
<p>The conveyance was emblematic of the Land of Lots of Time, and
reminiscent of old days down east, when our native river was young
and romantic. Same battered dray, same explosive driver, same old
Brindle and Rattler; we could follow the turn out from start to
finish with our eyes shut; we knew the delirious joy there had been
among the young ones when their best things had been got out of the
box and placed on the table and chairs in readiness for
morning.</p>
<p>Bill was out before daylight, mustering the bullocks, greasing
the dray, and yoking up. In the meantime mother bathed the
youngsters, combed their hair, and put on their Sunday clothes.
They set out soon after sunrise, Bill walking and driving; the
family squatted about the dray, their teeth chattering in sympathy
with the jolting of the concern, and some already squabbling for
lever places where there were no protruding bolts. The huge wheels
were conspicuous as the only part of the turnout that was in
anything like good condition. Half the decking had vanished, and
the youthful passengers plucked at the saltbush and Mitchell grass
through the gaps; the loosened railing swung from side to side,
adding to the din made by the bumping of loose planks and the
rattling of bolts that had lost their legitimate occupation by the
shedding of the first decking. The pace was not hair-raising,
except when the carriage dropped into a gully, when everybody
bounced and grabbed at their hats.</p>
<p>The arrival at the neighbour's house was announced by a
stentorian &quot;Whey!&quot; The whip was leaned carefully against
a stump, and the human cargo climbed out over the wheels or dropped
down behind. Bill produced his smoking paraphernalia from a huge
leather pouch at his belt, and approached the house filling his
pipe. He sat on the verandah with his friend, and yarned while the
women gossiped inside, and the children careered about the paddock
like howling lunatics. Now and again the babble was momentarily
checked by a peremptory &quot;Whey!&quot; as the waiting oxen
became impatient. Dinner was interrupted intermittently by similar
admonitions. They departed early, the juvenile members of the
combined families loading the dray to its utmost capacity, and the
women walking ahead for a mile or so, when they sat on a log for a
final gossip till the express caught up.</p>
<p>But the coach was rolling on.</p>
<p>Miles farther down, the road we passed a horse and cart also
laden with a family in holiday attire. They had been shopping, as
we inferred from the fact that &quot;mother&quot; was trying new
boots on the second eldest, and looking at the number. As a means
of enjoying a drive, the turnout wasn't a howling success; but it
got along with more celerity than the other, and there was less
risk of a passenger dropping through the floor, or rolling out
through the dilapidated railings and getting lost.</p>
<p>Towards evening we met the up-coach. On the box seat sat a thin,
bedraggled, ferocious looking female. She gave the order to pull
up, at the same time signalling with a folded gingham to our driver
to do the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you seen him?&quot; she asked the latter.</p>
<p>&quot;No, missus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heard anything of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you inquire?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you keep a lookout?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you any men inside?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll have a look at them. 'Tisn't as I doubt yer word, but
I don't feel so satisfied if I let a man go by without inspectin'
him.&quot;</p>
<p>She climbed down, and, shuffling across to our conveyance,
thrust her head in, and subjected each of us in turn to a close
scrutiny. Then she said in a loud, harsh voice;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me; do any of you gentlemen 'appen to know a man be
the name of George Pyzer?&quot;</p>
<p>None of us had the honour of his acquaintance.</p>
<p>&quot;You haven't heard of him?&quot;</p>
<p>We hadn't.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope I'm not on the wrong track,&quot; she mused, as she
returned disappointedly to her seat. &quot;If I am, 'twill be all
the worse for Pyzer when I do get hold of him.&quot;</p>
<p>We elicited from our driver at the next gate that Mr. Pyzer was
her &quot;lawful wedded 'usband,&quot; who had left her two years
ago for the shearing sheds. Advertisements to the effect that
information concerning his whereabouts would be gladly received by
his anxious wife being unfruitful, she had set out to find him,
travelling by coach or other vehicle when she could get a lift, and
determinedly tramping when nothing else availed.</p>
<p>Night had fallen, and we rocked and dozed in the coach as it
lumbered on towards the next &quot;change.&quot; Only the rattling
of the wheels and chains, the voice of the driver and the swish of
his whip broke the silence of the great western plains. Suddenly
the coach pulled up, and simultaneously the blaze of a camp fire
flashed upon us. We thrust our heads out eagerly to
investigate.</p>
<p>Around the fire, on tucker boxes and other campware, sat two
women and a couple of youths. Behind them were two tilted carts,
and on either side of the fire two or three beds spread out on the
grass. In the latter were several children, some of them sitting up
and rubbing their eyes; the others sleeping on undisturbed by the
noise of our arrival. They were two families the heads of which met
the coach as it drew up and received some mail from the driver.</p>
<p>&quot;Have a drink of tea.&quot; said one of the men.</p>
<p>The driver accepted the invitation; and as he stood by the fire
regaling himself with tea and brownie, we slipped out of the coach
and walked on to stretch our legs. We had covered half a mile
before the coach overtook us.</p>
<p>&quot;You see me take a rise out of Paddy,&quot; said the
overseer.</p>
<p>He picked up a stick, and stepping forward as the coach swung
round the bend, where we waited, yelled out: &quot;Bail
up!&quot;</p>
<p>The result was startling. Instead of pulling up, Paddy snatched
out a revolver and fired, then flogged his horses into a gallop,
and disappeared with a great clatter round a scrubby ridge.</p>
<p>The overseer had dropped with fright. We thought he was shot.
When we picked him up and ascertained that he was unhurt, we said
earnestly it was a great pity he wasn't shot.</p>
<p>We rushed down the road, cooeeing our hardest. But it was no
use; Paddy was making all speed away from the desperadoes. The
mail-change was two miles ahead, and our only hope of getting on
board again was to overtake the coach before it left that place. We
had to stretch our legs now to some purpose. When we kicked against
a root, or dropped unexpectedly into a hole, we stretched our whole
bodies along the road. Here and there we lost valuable minutes
looking for our hats. Still we found time to say a lot to the
overseer.</p>
<p>&quot;You fellows are never satisfied,&quot; he growled.
&quot;When you were in the coach you were grumbling about the
monotony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is getting infernally monotonous, anyway,&quot; Mr.
Muggs panted as he stumbled and lost his hat again. &quot;How far
have we come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One mile. I should reckon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that all. I thought we'd come nine.&quot;</p>
<p>A few minutes later we saw lights ahead. We kept our eyes on two
small red discs that stood close together a little way from the
white lights, all ready to give a concerted yell if they moved.
They were the rear lights of our coach.</p>
<p>However, it was a refreshment place, so we had plenty of time.
But we were too late for refreshments. Paddy and the groom were
putting the horses in.</p>
<p>&quot;Hulloa!&quot; said the former, innocently, &quot;where
have you fellows been?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Walking the blinded road we paid you to carry us
over,&quot; Mr. Muggs replied, with feeling. &quot;What did you
drive away for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know you'd got out,&quot; said the driver.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see the bushrangers?&quot; asked our of the box
seat lady passengers.</p>
<p>The ladies were still excited.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the bushranger,&quot; said Mr. Muggs, pointing to
the crestfallen overseer. &quot;Better put him in fetters; he might
break out again.&quot;</p>
<p>Paddy eyed the culprit up and down, while the ladies stepped
back with indignant looks.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean to tell me,&quot; said Paddy, &quot;that it was
this man who tried to hold up the coach to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold up your grandmother!&quot; sneered the overseer.
&quot;I held up a stick and called out to you to pull up so we
could get aboard again.&quot; He turned with a flourish of his arms
to the bystanders. &quot;And what does he do?&quot; he continued,
dramatically. &quot;Hauls out his revolver and fires at me! Then
drives off as if Old Nick were after him.&quot;</p>
<p>Having turned the laugh against the driver, he added
tragically:</p>
<p>&quot;Might 'a shot me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twould have served you right if I had,&quot; Paddy
retorted. &quot;I could have you arrested for that caper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll fine him drinks all round, and let it go at
that,&quot; Mr. Muggs interposed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurry up, then,&quot; said Paddy.</p>
<p>As we went into the bar the other men wanted to know more about
the sticking up, but the overseer sidestepped that incident at
once.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you call that lot back at the fire?&quot; he asked
the driver.</p>
<p>&quot;Fossickers from the Corner,&quot; Paddy replied.
&quot;Goin' to Menindie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; said the overseer. &quot;Case of breaking up
the happy home and starting afresh in distant fields.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Paddy. &quot;They're going down for a
swim.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For&mdash;a&mdash;swim!&quot; the overseer exclaimed,
incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;With a bit of boatin' and fishin',&quot; the driver
added.</p>
<p>The overseer was still incredulous.</p>
<p>&quot;They've come over a hundred miles, and they've got another
hundred to do,&quot; he said musingly. &quot;Pretty long step to go
fishin' and swimmin', isn't it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a long drag all right.&quot; Paddy admitted.
&quot;But it's about the nearest point the Corner people have for a
waterside holiday. Picnicking alongside a tank or water hole isn't
the same thing as alongside a navigable river. The Darling is a new
world to a lot of those people. The youngsters, at least, have
never seen a rowing boat, let alone a steamer. Of course, they
don't go down for a mere day or two; they'll spend a couple of
months there while they're at it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Providin' they don't get stuck up by a bushranger,&quot;
added Mr. Muggs, which unkind remark raised a general laugh against
the overseer just when he was beginning to feel well again.</p>
<p>The coach driver saved him from further humiliation.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, then, all aboard!&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br>
Holidaying on the Darling&mdash;The River of Rest.</h2>
<p>Seasiders, with their alluring wave lapped beaches, were
accustomed to consider such places as Boarke and Hay and Booligal
as synonymous with heat and dust and flies; to think of the Darling
as an unreliable stream that wound along for thousands of miles
through monotonous plains; to picture the country as dreary and
lifeless, especially in mid-summer, when the haze played weird
tricks with all animate and inanimate objects, and mirages mocked
the traveller.</p>
<p>Yet scores of families spent their Christmas vacation on the
banks of that historic stream. They hailed from farther
out&mdash;from Tongowoko, Delalah, Thouleanna, Yantara, Marara,
Mootwingee, Yungnulgra, Yancowinna, and other western counties. It
was only in wet seasons that boating any where in that corner was
possible; in fact, a boat of any kind there was a curiosity; while
a swim was a luxury to most.</p>
<p>The only public watering place for these far inlanders was the
Darling River. Some of them had to travel more than 500 miles to
reach it. As the journey had to be accomplished on horseback, in
the mail coach, in a shanghai or other vehicle, the trip was not
made every year; a great many only knew one such trip in a
lifetime, and not a few of them never got there at all. The
floating population, such as shearers, were up and down frequently;
and squattage hands and others who had no family cares made light
of the journey. Families from town and squattage, seeking change
from the far western atmosphere, usually went to Broken Hill, and
thence by train to Adelaide. That meant, roughly, another 350
miles' travelling. To people of small means the Darling River
offered far more advantages.</p>
<p>Crowds went from the Silver City for a camp on its banks in
preference to the southern capital. Being much nearer, they
travelled in drays, vans, tilted carts, and any other vehicle
available; the mail coach, trip after trip, was packed inside and
out; whilst numbers of the miners lightheartedly shouldered tent
and blanket, and tramped the distance. The majority used the
quicker motor car service, which considerably shortened the
journey; for, whereas the coach trip occupied about 14 hours, the
motor car travelled across in about five hours.</p>
<p>To all of them it was a glorious change. The old, dull road was
enlivened by joyous excursionists, particularly where many
clustered at the night camps by some well known waterhole, the big
camps at times being reminiscent of the gold rushes. In these
country places everybody knew everybody else, and they knew people
from hundreds of miles back in consequence of miners in slack times
going out shearing, and bush workers joining the miners when
nothing else was available. In the festive season mates and
families arranged to start away at the same time, so that there was
jovial company on the road and merriment in the night camps. There
was plenty of music, and dancing under the trees in the moonlight
was a not uncommon diversion. Songs were sung by men and women,
while the intervals were filled by gossip and yarns and the merry
gambolling of children.</p>
<p>Everybody was up early, for eager, excited children, together
with the chatter of birds, didn't permit much sleep in the daylight
hours. Most of them slept in the open, for on warm, fine nights
there was no need for any covering. Some of the elders used a tent
or fly; the majority were content to spread out behind a temporary
screen, so that it was necessary to &quot;awake and arise&quot; as
soon as there was a stir in the camp. While one lot was hunting up
and harnessing horses, another was making fires and boiling
billies, the youngsters cheerfully running about, and gathering
wood; a third contingent was rolling up the tents and beds and
preparing for breakfast. Through it all there was frolic and fun,
for it was wholly a company of travellers on pleasure bent, to many
of whom the life on the road was novel. Then on the move again,
numbers of them walking and playing along the way until the sun got
too hot and legs began to tire. An early halt was made for lunch,
and they rested through the hottest part of the day to save the
horses. When they reached the river they were met by others who had
preceded them; here, too, they met old friends and mates from other
parts of the State, who, around the camp fires at night and in the
shade of the trees by day, talked over their days on the diggings,
in the mines and the sheds, on the runs and the overland. They
pitched their tents near the water; in a good grassy bend, there
would at time be a fair sized calico township.</p>
<p>The Darling River always struck me as being the River of Rest.
No other stream in N.S.W. was so much treasured by the floating
population as a camping place. Besides the occasional
holiday-makers and the swagmen and workmen who spent part of the
summer in the bends, there were whalers and old men who lived
always there. These latter shifted up and down, though a few, if
wood held out, stuck to the same spot. They didn't like to see
their old river turned into a pleasure resort. The coming of
crowds, growing bigger and bigger each season, marked a change of
great purport to them. It had been their quiet abiding place for
years; a peaceful retreat where they could keep themselves
comfortably and do as they pleased. The holiday crowd changed the
whole aspect of the old home, bringing modernity suddenly into the
heart of the wilds. They hunted and fished on what the old whaler
had come to regard as his preserves; they used up in a week the
firewood that he had estimated would last him a year.</p>
<p>There was plenty of room along the Darling; but the old hands
were not used to town allotments, or even small paddocks; they had
been used to ten-mile blocks at least. If they could see the next
house above them, or the next tent below them, they began to feel
crowded. Taking into account the whole of the great waterway, part
of which is called the Murray, part the Darling, part the
Macintyre, and part the Dumaresq; it is one of the four longest
rivers in the world, so that the pleasure-seekers from the
north-west corner did not use a very great portion of its vast
length. If the entire population of the Corner had spread itself
along the banks of the Darling section the old whaler would still
have had room to swing his rod without knocking the next man's hat
off. But he was looking into the future, when trains would run from
Menindie to Broken Hill; from Bourke to Hungerford; from Cobar to
Wilcannia; then excursionists would be conveyed there in thousands
from districts on both sides of the stream. There were 35,000
people in Broken Hill alone; railways, locks, and irrigation
schemes would plant settlers as thickly on the rich western lands,
as irrigation had planted them at Mildura, Renmark, and other
places lower down the Murray&mdash;areas that were once regarded as
hopeless, and which were now the great fruit-producing centres of
South Australia. The land in the northwest would grow anything, the
greater part of it being among the richest in Australia; it only
wanted water, and the River of Rest would one day supply it, and at
the same time become the busiest pleasure resort away from the
coast. The old whaler sighed when he thought of that time, for the
stream that harboured the black bream and fat cod would then no
longer be the River of Rest.</p>
<p>The spots most frequented lay along the western shore between
Wilcannia and Menindie, centralising about the latter
place&mdash;the nearest river town to Broken Hill. To western
children it was paradise regained. Many of them on arrival there
saw a river for the first time; the majority of them had no
experience of angling. They were all equipped with tackle, for cod,
bream and other fish could be caught there in abundance in all
seasons; and their amateurish attempts at first at casting and
landing provoked snorts of disgust from the old whaler, whilst
their ecstasy on landing the first few fish provided the ancients
with a fund of new jokes. The visitors partly kept themselves in
food with their lines during their holiday. They fished for that
purpose, and for the pleasure of it; and many carried away with
them to their far-back homes enough smoked, salted and pickled fish
to last them for months afterwards.</p>
<p>The guns were not idle either, for there were ducks, pigeons,
parrots, and plain turkeys to be had. There the galahs and corellas
and the dainty little quarrians gathered in screeching flocks,
their pinks, and greys and whites flashing in the light of the
setting sun as they swooped and wheeled over the water and across
the plains, forming a delightful picture. In fair seasons those
plains were covered with flagrant flowers, miles upon miles of
beautiful blooms, where the children revelled, and from which they
gathered armsful to decorate their tent and cubby houses.</p>
<p>Two floral notables that were at home thereabouts were the
Desert Peas and the Darling Pea. The latter, despite its
attractiveness, was regarded as a pest by stockowners on account of
the maddening effect it was said to have on horses that ate it.
&quot;Darling pea&quot; was a colloquialism outback for madness. It
was applied to any eccentric person, to one who was something of a
fool, or was weak in the intellect, or &quot;barmy.&quot; The
superstition left the flower alone, for there was a saying that
anyone who picked it would not get away from the river for seven
years. The Darling Lily was another distinguished flower. From the
bulbs of this plant an excellent arrowroot was obtained, the
product being readily sold in Wileannia and thereabout in times of
stress. When carriage in bad seasons made flour expensive, or
delivery of supplies was delayed, the Darling Lily was valuable,
and in much request.</p>
<p>Morning and evening the visitors swam in the river, while
rowing-boats, house-boats and motor launches assisted in making the
days enjoyable. Steamers and barges passed up and down, and these,
too, were availed of by many of the campers for a trip up or down
the river&mdash;when there was an opportunity of getting back by
another steamer in the time desired by the camper. The steamers
travelled on for days, generally tying up at night; so that one
could put in his whole vacation on the river trip if he wished.</p>
<p>Old Bill Hodge, who made a bit of money on White Cliffs opal
fields, built himself a boat out of an old punt. It was
half-decked, had lockers, oars and a sail, and was roofed with
canvas for three parts of its length. His wife had often remarked
in a vague way that she would like a trip. She never said where to,
or what sort of a trip; but when this notion took shape, and he
announced that they would go lazing down the river for a change, it
suited her and the three youngsters better than anything. They took
in a supply of provisions, shooting requisites and fishing tackle,
and one early morning they embarked, to drift and row and sail for
a week for rest and pleasure and adventure.</p>
<p>Theirs was not a proper houseboat. There was room enough for all
to loll about in while the boat was under weigh; but there was no
room for beds or for a table. That didn't matter; only on a wet day
did they find the shortcomings of the craft inconvenient. Some
firewood was stowed on board on the approach of rain, and a fire to
boil the billy was made in an oil drum stood on a shovelful of
sand. The wet they encountered was merely fleeting storms, which
were more welcome than otherwise; only the banks and the bush were
damped with rain. The elder children fished from the stern, the
mother sat under the awning sewing or reading, while father rowed
or sailed, with a gun ready beside him for game. When negotiating
some of the long bends in the late afternoon the children went
ashore, and played and hunted about the bush till the boat came
round. Across the necks of some of those bights it was only a few
minutes' walk, while it was miles round by water. Sometimes the
mother went with them, strolling through a pleasant and fragrant
forest, where flocks of parrots made merry among the boughs.</p>
<p>At night they tied up and made their beds on shore. The beds had
merely to be thrown down and spread, and in the morning rolled up
and stowed on board again. A big campfire was made, and here father
initiated them into the bush art of making damper and brownie,
items in themselves which made a relishable change from ordinary
diet. Fish and game figured on the menu as often as they desired,
which helped to cheapen their picnic trip. It was a continuous
picnic, never wearisome nor monotonous. Steamers passed up now and
again, heavily laden for the far interior, and barges went twisting
downstream piled with wool. Smiling homesteads scattered along the
shores; little townships now and again, with woodmen's depots and
whalers' camps between, and the ever changing scenery of plain and
forest and scrub and hill, with hunting and fishing and little
adventures on the way, kept them interested.</p>
<p>The Corner people knew their river's history, though they saw it
seldom; and many of the spots where they camped have an interest or
account of their association with some important event in the long
past. Many are remembered in connection with Captain Sturt; and
there are old camps of other explorers and of early overlanders.
From Menindie the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition set out for
the Gulf. Their camel driver, who died there, was buried on the
outskirts of the town. Menindie was then an hotel and a store on
the river bank. Burke and party spelled there for six months,
waiting for rain to carry them to Koopa Creek. They left on October
19, 1860, with 12 camels and a local guide, who accompanied them
for 200 miles. They were well-provisioned, yet died miserably of
starvation on Koopa Creek in June, 1861. It was told by old blacks
on the Koopa that a camel which was carrying the explorers' rifles
and blankets broke away from them between the Depot and Lake
Coongee, and was lost. This would explain how the party came to
perish in a district where game has always been very plentiful,
parrots and pigeons especially being found there in myriads, for
Burke, Wills and King knew about as much bushcraft as a new
arrival, and without firearms they would be stranded. Six years
later, W. Maiden, of Menindie, with two mates, rode over almost the
same track to within 180 miles of the Gulf, when they turned off to
the Cape River diggings. Over one stage of 400 miles they had only
their three horses and their guns, and they got through quite
comfortably, living on what the wilds provided.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
Bogeying in the Bush.</h2>
<p>Most of those people who lived where only an occasional bogey in
a waterhole or tank could be indulged in were fair swimmers. In
that region the ability to swim might seem an unnecessary
accomplishment; but there were times when dwellers and travellers
there found themselves surrounded by miles of water, from which the
only possible way of escape was by alternately wading and swimming.
Travellers were often caught by sudden floods, and if they were in
a low position they had to swim to higher ground, which might be
far enough away to occupy them the best part of a day. Trees
afforded them rest, and not infrequently they were forced to spend
a night in one. A person who was unable to swim might be imprisoned
on a small island for days or weeks. Besides being faced with
starvation, he had the unwelcome company of innumerable insects and
reptiles that sought refuge there from the flood.</p>
<p>In those parts floods were usually crossed on horseback. Men who
could not swim did not hesitate to put their horses into fairly
wide streams. Women and girls also crossed flooded creeks in this
way. Drovers in wet weather were frequently intercepted by floods,
through which they had to swim, and stockmen when mustering on some
runs, especially when shifting stock in rainy seasons, had much
swimming to do. A good waterman, when the water was wide and the
current strong, would slip out of the saddle and hang on either by
the horse's main or by its tail to give the animal a better chance.
There were times also when the traveller, on turning out in the
morning, found his horses cut off from his camp by a wide stretch
of deep water, and if he was unable to swim he had to run the risk
of losing them altogether.</p>
<p>On the mid-eastern tidal rivers, when we knew them in their
natural glory, it was hard to find any among the native-born who
could not swim. Bogeying was one of the principal delights of both
men and women. The passenger on the river steamer saw many groups
enjoying themselves every day in the week. Some of the men had a
horse to add to the amusement, three or four mounting it bareback
and riding it in; some had a buoyant leg, a springboard or other
accessories. At public schools that were close to a river, or near
lagoons and creeks the boys bogeyed in the dinner hour. They loved
the water wherever they were; and in the far inlands they would go
out into the rain to revel in a shower bath from the clouds.</p>
<p>It is strange that a man who has not been taught to swim has not
even the dog's instinct to paddle. Throw a dog into water, and
though it has never been wet before it will quite easily swim
ashore. It holds its nose too high, and makes a great splash with
its front paws at first, but it soon gets out of that. It uses its
feet in the same way as it does on land, and if a man who had not
learnt the art of swimming were to kick a &quot;paw&quot; in
similar fashion, he, too, could save himself in the majority of
cases. Fear of the water and the want of a little presence of mind
accounts for most drownings. It almost amounts to fatalism, for man
is about the only animal on earth that sinks when he falls in.
Considering that the uninitiated human has more reasoning powers
than a cow or a horse, one might reasonably expect him to do at
least as well as either of those animals at the first attempt. But
the quadrupeds simply leave him nowhere. A cow, driven into river
or sea, will swim miles at the first asking, and no one can say
that she is better fitted by nature for aquatic exercises than man
is.</p>
<p>Many of the newchums learnt to swim, and many of the early
settlers who could not swim themselves taught their children the
art, in a way that showed how much fear had to do with drowning.
The teacher remained safely on good solid bank, where there was no
danger of his slipping in. A rope was fastened round under the arms
of the pupil, and the latter, knowing that he could be quickly
hauled ashore at any moment, jumped boldly in and put up a really
good performance. He kept afloat some of the time, and even made
progress in the water; whereas, without the confidence that rope
gave him, he would have sunk and drowned. The aborigines
thereabouts taught their piccaninnies to swim by throwing them into
the water, and leaving them struggling awhile before going after
them. A lubra, too, swam with a child on her back, now and again
diving from under it or shaking it off.</p>
<p>The man who taught me to swim couldn't swim a stroke himself,
and he had such a dread of deep water that nothing could induce him
to make an attempt. He was successful us a teacher, though the
pupil wasn't enthusiastic over his first experiments. He obtained
two bladders from the butcher, each when blown up about the size of
a regulation football, one of which he fastened to each of my
ankles. He assured me that these balloons would keep me afloat. I
was only about 10 years old then, and on being told to jump, I
jumped with confidence. When those windbags struck the water they
bounced, and I dived involuntarily and precipitately. Nor could I
get my head up again, for my feet were buoyed in the surface. The
teacher had told me to call out &quot;pull&quot; when I wanted to
get out. I wanted to get out very badly, but I could only make
distress signals with my heels. Instead of being life-savers, those
floaters were an impediment&mdash;they were suicidal. When he did
pull I was too nearly asphyxiated to take any further lessons on
that day.</p>
<p>Still he was not satisfied that the floaters were a failure. He
next fastened them under my arms with several yards of twine. When
I jumped the twine broke in several places, and the floaters
slapped me hard against the ears. They bobbed around in the way all
the time, an aggravating nuisance. On being hauled out and relieved
of them, I cheerfully agreed to go in anywhere with only the rope
on. These floaters held more terrors for me than the river did. I
also resolved to get rid of the teacher as early as possible. I did
not meditate drowning him; but after three more lessons I swam that
river to and fro without any assistance. It was a hard task; I
would sooner have walked a long way round; but as I scrambled
breathlessly to the bank he said, &quot;You'll do.&quot; and
retired.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
Shopping in Town and Country.</h2>
<p>There was a little shopping to do as an occasional diversion.
Most of the visitors to the townships found more pleasure in
spending their surplus cash than they had known in making it. They
had saved it up to spend, and in spending it they enjoyed
themselves.</p>
<p>In little country towns the centres of interest are the pub and
the store. Most travellers and holiday-makers have some business to
do at one or both, especially after a long journey; and very often
the pub and the store depend largely for custom on the moving
population. While the old man sometimes has a lot of business to
engage him at the pub, his wife has a jamboree among the laces and
ribbons and the new season's hats at the &quot;general
store.&quot;</p>
<p>Shopping in these remote parts is not the pleasant recreation
and a sort of fancy show that the city woman makes of it. The
latter can spend half a day buying a reel of cotton and a
scrubbing-brush, which she instructs the perspiring shopman she
wants delivered at her address next day without fail. She has an
enjoyable run in tram or boat, has a look round other shops,
pricing a lot of things she has no intention of buying: has
afternoon tea, meets a friend or two, and has an interesting gossip
about a thousand things of no importance; all incidental to the
purchasing of the cotton and the scrubbing-brush. And when she gets
home she discovers that she wanted a packet of hairpins as well.
That, of course, makes another shopping-day. The outing invariably
includes a growl at the Tramway Commissioners, since there is not a
continuous stream of trams to obviate the annoyance of a couple of
minutes' waiting; a denunciation of the municipal authorities for
not having the footpaths like billiard tables; and complaints about
the weather, which is too dry or too wet or too cold or too
hot.</p>
<p>In the lonesome regions we had been travelling the women did
things differently, and took their roads and their weather more
philosophically. One could note their ways conveniently in towns of
the dimensions of Menindie. The surrounding residents usually came
in to do their shopping on a Saturday. Not every Saturday; perhaps
once a month, perhaps once only in three months. They wanted things
between times, but unless it was something very urgent they managed
without them &quot;till they went to town&quot; at about the
regular period.</p>
<p>You would see a family vehicle drive in; it might be a buggy, a
waggonette, a spring cart, or a heavy horse dray; and in it an old
couple and half a dozen, children. They drove to the hotel, where
they had dinner. Afterwards they repaired in a body to the store.
It was always called a store, not a shop. There the whole family,
from the youngest to the eldest, were fitted with boots and hats,
and provided with new Sunday suits. They had lots of things to buy
for house and field, and the missus was still buying while the old
man fetched the vehicle round and commenced to load up. But they
were not hard to please, and in a couple of hours they had got all
they wanted. Besides the load in the dray, nearly everybody was
carrying something; every pocket in their clothes was crammed, and
the children, immensely proud with all their new possessions, and
enjoying themselves miserably in a strange place and among strange
faces, were eating lollies and biscuits. They started for home
about mid-afternoon, and when you were told they had a dozen or
twenty miles to go you knew they would be driving till long after
dark.</p>
<p>Another visitor was a woman on horseback. She did not go to the
hotel but rode into a little yard at the back of the store, where
the storekeeper, if he wasn't attending to a customer at the time,
met her and acted as groom. When she had done shopping he strapped
her bundle on to the saddle, stuffed sundry small articles into the
saddle-pouch, helped her on, and handed up several more parcels,
which she carried in her hands. She had a good load from the store,
and sometimes she had a baby to carry in front of her as well. She
had a long ride, in the course of which she had to open and shut
two or three gates, and dismount three or four times at sliprails.
At these places she hung her loose parcels on a post before she got
off, and gathered them up after she had mounted again. Sliprails on
bush tracks were seldom light and handy, and often there was an
ugly puddle hole where they were let down. The equestrienne was
naturally dead tired after her day's shopping.</p>
<p>Other women came in singly, driving in a buggy or sulky, which
pulled up in front of the store. The driver did her shopping, the
storekeeper packed her purchases in the vehicle, and the customer
drove away down the winding road, and disappeared among the trees.
From the same direction came a woman on foot, accompanied by a
couple of children. They had walked four or five miles, and
bye-and-bye, all loaded up with parcels, you saw them set out from
the store on the return journey. The mother enjoined this one and
that one to mind they didn't drop anything, and now and again they
sat down on a log for a spell. There were stops also to do up
parcels that had come undone, and waitings for the youngest, who
dropped farther and farther in the rear as the last weary miles
were covered. There was not much pleasure in shopping for those
people; all the joy was in the store, and when the parcels were
opened at home. The trip itself was too laborious to go into
raptures over. The exertion of shopping left no craving for an
early repetition of the experience.</p>
<p>There was a spice of novelty, if there was less convenience, in
the shopping by the riverside, where the floating store, trading up
and down the river, tied up to the bank for a day or an afternoon
to do business with people living in the vicinity. This store
naturally found most customers away from towns, so it moored at
regular intervals at places that were convenient to a few scattered
settlers. A farmhouse, a squattage homestead, a timber-getter's or
wood cutters' camp, and a wayside hotel, were usual depots. There
was seldom a wharf at any of these places. The steamer was tied to
a tree, a plank was thrown down, and customers filed on board to do
their shopping. The captain stood behind the counter where general
merchandise was served out; his wife or daughter attended to the
women in the drapery department, and the mate acted as general
rouseabout. He got the kerosene and the potatoes and onions. The
floating store saved a lot of travelling for a scattered public and
brought distant neighbours together, which gave a zest to
shopping.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br>
Broken Hill.</h2>
<p>Whether you arrived by day or night, in rain or shine, you heard
Broken Hill before you saw it. Its vital organs, the batteries and
mills at the mines, were always thumping. Though the city, which
was clustered on two flats, separated and hidden one from the other
by the big silver hill, had a population of 35,000, you could hear
its heart-beats when you had left it all behind. If its battering
throbs stopped for a night, the people couldn't sleep. They missed
the noise. Likewise, the whole business of their lives was
regulated by the shift whistle. They got up by it, they had their
meals by it and they went to bed by it. It was their
time-keeper.</p>
<p>It was Paddy Green, of Menindie, who made the first discovery of
silver lead ore on the Harrier. That was in 1876, in the vicinity
of Thackaringa. Seven years later Charlie Rasp, who was employed as
a boundary rider on Mount Gipps, struck the first colour at Broken
Hill, then part of Mount Gipps run. He had the veteran prospector's
eye for likely places, and by means of his inveterate habit of
fossicking here and there while on his lonely rides among the
rocky, mulga covered ridges, the world's greatest silver mine was
located. From these inhospitable looking hills, with bleak and
barren surroundings, millions of ounces of silver were exported
annually to India, China and Japan, besides large quantities of
lead and zinc concentrates to England and Europe. Copper, gold,
antimony and other minerals were also obtained from the same
sources, but the principal wealth of the mines was in silver and
lead. It was practically the output of this one rich field that
placed Australia fourth on the list of the world's pig-lead
producers.</p>
<p>For a big place the Silver City was as dull at ditch-water. Its,
streets were nearly always empty; when half the miners were at work
the other half were asleep; but on Saturday nights everybody got
up, when the main business part of Argent-street became thronged
with sturdy, good-natured, fellows who looked more like
&quot;gentlemen of means&quot; than hard-working miners. Working
much of their time underground, their complexions were unspoilt,
their eyes unaffected by hot sun and wind whirling dust. The
bachelors, who stayed at hotels, went out in the morning as though
they were going to see their best girls; they came back near
sundown looking as though they were expecting company for tea: and
the stranger wouldn't have guessed that they had been toiling in
the mines in the interval. Before going to bed they put their boots
outside the door to be polished for them to go to work in.</p>
<p>Though unattractive to the visitor in its calm moments, when the
male population was divided between bed and mine, Broken Hill was
never dead. It was a revolutionary town that woke up every now and
again and did things that gave Capital the nightmare. It was a
world leader, with its co-operative stores, co-operative bakeries,
co-operative bootshops, and other cooperative concerns, whose
object was to give the workers the full results of their industry.
It was the only place where the people had struck against the price
of bread being lowered. When we arrived one of the hotels was being
boycotted because it had lowered the price of beer. The property
had depreciated in value; grim ruin was hovering about the
doorstep, for the thirstiest pedestrian wouldn't be seen going in
there. The beer was too cheap. Ere long the price was raised again,
and business returned. It was a union town. If you were struck on a
Broken Hill girl, you had to show that you were a financial
unionist before you would have any hope of getting her. Girls had
struck work, and walked out of the hotels when the licensees
permitted non-unionists to remain on the premises. Here a Mayor of
the municipality has presided at strike meetings, and municipal
officials have marched through the streets with the strikers.</p>
<p>It was the most democratic city in existence, the capital of a
big territory that was peopled with men and women of the all
Australian principle. Having the borders of three States at their
doors, and passing to and fro for shearing, droving, mining, and
bush work, they recognised no divisions. Officially and
territorially they were New South Walers; commercially and in their
local sympathies they were South Australians. That was natural,
since Adelaide was their nearest seaport, being distant only 344
miles by rail, whereas Sydney was 725 miles away in a straight
line, and twice that distance by rail. Most of the mining trade
went to Pirie; that South Australian town, in fact, was almost
wholly supported by the mines. The bulk of the vegetables consumed
by the miners was gown in the same State; and in drought time they
also got their water supply from that quarter, the precious liquid
being conveyed by train, and carted from the railway station in
tanks, and casks, and carried in tubs and buckets.</p>
<p>During these rare periods, washing day supplied a striking
lesson in economy. The Sydney or Melbourne woman would think, after
the family washing had been put through a tub of water, that there
was no further use for the resultant dirty suds, except to pour at
the root of a tree in the garden. But the Broken Hill woman did not
throw them away. She cleared them with copi which could be picked
up here and there all over the north west corner; or with
permanganate of potash; and the cleared water was used again,
perhaps several times over. Copi was also used for clearing muddy
water, obtained from small pools and dams, for drinking and cooking
purposes. Even in times of plenty Broken Hill water presented
difficulties not met with elsewhere. The sand blown from the dumps
was laden with acids and particles of lead, and had a peculiar
effect on water caught near the mines. Soap would only dissolve in
it when it was cold. If any soap got into the copper, even through
insufficient rinsing, as soon as the water got hot the soap formed
into tough, rubber-like lumps that stuck tenaciously to clothes and
copper. When the blue-bag was used in the ordinary way, the blue
went straight to the bottom, leaving the water unchanged. To
overcome this difficulty soap extract and blue were dissolved
together in a little unmineralised water, which was then stirred
into the tub.</p>
<p>The original name of the Hill was Willyama; the name given to
the ugly hump where the ores came from has replaced it by popular
usage. In its street nomenclature it set an excellent example for
the little aldermen who have a habit of naming thoroughfares and
places after persons whom most people know nothing about, and
nobody but their intimate friends want to remember; burdening often
a place of beauty and interest with an uncouth name that a
conscientious man wouldn't give to his dog. Broken Hill got a long
start of the little aldermen, and thus its streets are named
Carbon, Argent, Cobalt, Garnet, Oxide, Bromide, Chloride, Sulphide,
Iodide, Crystal, Slag, Beryl, Graphite, Kaolin, Talc, Gossan,
Gypsum, Blendo, Mica, Nickel, Wolfram, Bismuth, Galona, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The bulk of the population being mine workers, their homes,
which are mostly built on leases, are not imposing; and they come
and go and shift about with more frequency than in other places.
When one was leaving, his house and furniture were sold, but not
the ground. The purchaser, having a block of his own, removed the
house. Sometimes a man removed from a distant block to one nearer
the mines, in which case he took his residence with him. A good
many put up huts near the foot of the mines, which were in the
centre of the city, and as the dump encroached on their allotments,
they had to shift too. People were used to seeing cottages
travelling about there, leaving gaps in one street and filling
vacancies in another. Buildings were also drawn up to the auction
mart and sold. I saw three standing side by side on trucks at one
auction mart, each large enough to accommodate an average family.
People were climbing up and passing through them, examining the
rooms. Two of them were sold, and were delivered to the purchasers
when required like any other goods.</p>
<p>There was also a distraint for rent sale. The A. M. A. had
previously carried a resolution &quot;That members be notified and
asked to be present for the purpose of trying to prevent any person
purchasing goods and chattels.&quot; About 200 people rolled up, a
majority of whom were women. The sale lasted about 10 minutes, and
realised about 10s; nothing that was put up, from a clock to a
suite of furniture, bringing more a shilling. The monotonous
&quot;bob&quot; bid came from one man, who subsequently handed the
goods and chattels back to the original owners.</p>
<p>Accommodation was not easy to get. The hotel upon which we
conferred our valuable patronage let its rooms by the week to
miners. The rooms were always occupied, the night shifts sleeping
there through the day, and the day shifts at night. This was not a
convenience to the casual lodger; in fact, the casual lodger wasn't
wanted at our hotel. We were admitted only on giving a solemn
promise, so that we wouldn't stay long; and we were permitted to
have our meals there on the same understanding, and as a great
personal favour. All but three of the regular lodgers got their
meals at the restaurants. I don't know how the trio obtained this
tremendous consideration, unless they were related to the family,
or intended to be. &quot;Apartments to let and grog to sell&quot;
summed up the whole business of hotel keeping. Any expansion was
undertaken grudgingly, boarders being particularly objectionable.
They disturbed the sleeping miners. We felt like intruders. We were
unwelcome guests. Even the buoyant overseer who could adapt himself
to most circumstances, slunk in and out; and Mr. Muggs, who always
made friends with the girls wherever he went, never got beyond a
deferential &quot;good morning&quot; here. He made a valiant
attempt once or twice at the beginning, but the girl's eyes seemed
to say, &quot;You are making unnecessary work for me by staying
here; why don't you buy a house?&quot; And he froze. They went
about with a mind-you-don't-wake-the-baby air, those girls. We got
into that habit, too. We tiptoed in and out of our room; we talked
in whispers, and when we took our boots off we put them down as
though they were glass. If we were out late we took them off at the
bottom of the stairs, and sneaked up in our socks, each cautioning
the other to &quot;be careful, baby's asleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't make this out,&quot; said the overseer one
morning. &quot;There's something incongruous about it. All that
infernal clatter at the mines day and night doesn't disturb these
fellows a bit; yet if we only walk about near their rooms they
complain. Can't sleep for the row. 'Struth!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's, second nature,&quot; Mr. Muggs replied. &quot;The
sound of the stampers and crushers is as the droning of waters to
them, and any noise that doesn't happen regularly is out of
harmony. If you fell downstairs, for instance, say, once a week,
the bump you'd make would be a discord; but if you went falling
down continuously that noise would come to harmonise with the
other, and pretty soon they wouldn't sleep unless you were
bumping.&quot;</p>
<p>The show piece of the place was the unsightly pile known as the
Big Mine, and its two principal features of interest to us were the
open cut and the registered crowd. When you saw the landslides and
rocks hurtling down the broken sides every now and then, and the
men dropping their tools and running for safety, those far up the
slopes sliding away, spider-like, on hands and feet, the Open Cut
struck you as a fine place to keep out of. All the same, we went
down, and when we had got to the bottom the overseer remarked:
&quot;What a fine tank it would make!&quot; Several big rocks just
then broke loose near the top and came whizzing down.
&quot;But,&quot; he added, starting to run, &quot;it looks better
from the top.&quot;</p>
<p>The registered crowd were those who were waiting for a job.
Their names, together with the kind of work they wanted, were
listed in the company's books, and when new hands were wanted the
names were called over from the office verandah until the required
number of men had answered. The names of absentees, unless someone
else answered for them, were separated out and re-entered at the
bottom of the list. Twice only was this done with each name; the
third time it was struck of the register. Generally the roll was
called when the shifts were changing; but there were so many
accidents and other emergencies that it was likely to be called at
any time in the day or night. So there was always a crowd waiting
about. Some brought their lunches; some brought their blankets,
especially when they knew their names were near the top of the
list. One old fellow, whom we found lunching among the rocks, said
he had been waiting three weeks; but the &quot;call&quot; might
come at any minute now. His name was &quot;top.&quot; We saw him
again a couple of hours later, when he was walking moodily
homeward.</p>
<p>&quot;My name was called to-day, as I expected,&quot; he told
us, &quot;an' hang me if I wasn't dead asleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was hard luck after waiting three days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An' keepin' awake all the time,&quot; he rejoined.
&quot;We're like a pack o' cards&mdash;always being shuffled. I was
trumps this mornin', an' now I'm at the bottom of the pack. I've a
good mind to go shearin'.&quot;</p>
<p>Broken Hill was the end of the first section for us. Our travel
southward halted there for some weeks, during which time we sampled
the Mendindie trip and before returning to the Silver City lazed
awhile on the River of Rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br>
Seeing the Country&mdash;Lively Company&mdash;A Chap From Farrell's
Flat.</h2>
<p>It was something to have seen the biggest silver mine on earth;
but there was nothing else to see in Broken Hill&mdash;no parks or
gardens, no lakes or streams, only a dull, dusty town, with an
environment of bleak hills. We left it cheerfully; we did not even
look back from the windows for a last glimpse at its myriad lights
as we rolled out on a Sunday night. We thought only of making
things comfortable for the 344 mile run to Adelaide, and training
our voices back to their natural pitch. It was a relief to trip
over the carpet and not feel called upon to apologise for the noise
your head made against the wall, and to be able to draw a cork
without considering the pop of it.</p>
<p>When you have sampled many ways and means of getting elsewhere
in the great spaces of the interior, including rides on donkey back
and camel back, in shanghais, sulkies and waggonettes, in mail
coaches, carts and bullock-drays, per boot and per bike, you can
appreciate a railway car much more than when you come off a sea
voyage, or have been used to motoring on civilised roads. It is the
most satisfactory way of travelling when you have to cover long
distances&mdash;but as a means of seeing the country it is a dead
failure.</p>
<p>Most oversea visitors whose object is a book on Australia stick
to the comfortable railroad, which accounts for the preponderance
of false impressions. The main scenery on a railway line is
embankments, interspersed with tunnels and long lines of heavy
fences, the bleached rails whereof invite you to try Killem's pills
and to drink Hogg's whisky.</p>
<p>From the seat of a vehicle you have a broad panorama spread
around you most of the time. On horseback you get in closer touch
with it. Travelling on a bike you see little but the track in front
of you; like the donkey, familiar to South Australian back-country
roads, the wheel required too much attention. The camel affords you
a fine, lofty view&mdash;well shaken as you take it. Perched among
the elaborate trappings with which the Centralian fits his riding
camel, and enjoying a fragrant cheroot, you might imagine yourself
an Asiatic potentate, especially when you find a little place
called Jericho on your northern track. But the best way of all to
see the country and to absorb the scenery, and all the local
features and peculiarities, and to learn the habits and character
of the inhabitants, is per boot. There is no one living who knows
Australia more intimately than the swag man.</p>
<p>The express is different from an ordinary train. It is always in
a hurry, begrudging you five minutes to swallow a cup of tea: and
people rush it so that you are uncomfortably crowded. Furthermore,
when you leave your seats for refreshments, with no one in charge,
you find them jumped on your return, and you have to crush in
somewhere else.</p>
<p>An experience of this sort introduced us to lively company about
midnight. Two volunteers bound for South Africa, and a long,
dark-bearded man in leggings were making merry on their way to
Melbourne. They had a bottle on board, besides which they had been
nipping at every hotel we touched at. They played cards for money
on the seat, &quot;refreshed&quot; between games,. disagreed about
what was trumps, talked louder and louder and more disrespectfully
to each other, and at last the long one in leggings and one of the
khaki men got to blows. They tumbled all over the rest of us, who
soon mounted the seats, and they pounded each other from one side
of the carriage to the other&mdash;which wasn't far. I think the
carriage got the worst of the fight, which was ended by a
portmanteau, falling off the rack on to the long one, and
flattening him out. We helped him on to the platform at the next
station, and did the same kind action for his mates. Everyone in
the compartment seemed to be actuated by the one generous impulse;
while half of them assisted the disturbers to alight, the other
half carried their coats and bags out for them. They were quite
overcome by so much civility and kindness. Nobody assisted them in
again.</p>
<p>We were far into the mid-State then, for Cockburn, where the
border is crossed, is only a short run from the Silver City. This
place was important, for border customs had not been abolished
then. Travelling from the north-west of New South Wales to the
south-east of the same State by train, you had to pass through
three of them&mdash;at Cockburn, Serviceton, and Albury, though the
through passenger, by bonding all luggage &quot;not wanted on the
voyage,&quot; had no bother anywhere. But he had more anxiety when
there was a break in the journey as at Adelaide and Melbourne, for
he wasn't allowed possession of his trunks unless he went through
the official formula.</p>
<p>This line stood over all for ticket-clipping. You began to
wonder, as puncture after puncture was made in your bit of
cardboard, if there would be enough of it to carry you through. The
overseer made a study of it. He counted the perforations each time
to make sure that it had really acquired a fresh brand, or had been
merely struck in an old puncture; and he would carefully spread out
the ruin and estimate how many more earmarks could be got on to
it.</p>
<p>A simple old chap from Farrell's Flat used to slip his ticket
inside the top of his long boot for safety. When the marker came
round he had to take off his boot to get it; and as his memory was
not very good he mostly took the wrong one off first; and sometimes
it got inside his socks, which necessitated taking them off also.
He was several times threatened with violent expulsion; but he
would meet the official's impatient remonstrance's with a bland
smile and a confident shake of his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Just hold on a bit, sonny.&quot; he would say; &quot;it's
about one o' me feet somewhere, an' we'll round him up directly,
you take it from me.&quot;</p>
<p>When he did round him up the official clipped it with a vengeful
snap, and banged the door afterwards with extra force.</p>
<p>The country was uninteresting, being for the most part low,
stony hills, covered with stunted growth, and great lonely, grey
plains, sprinkled with sheep and goats, and where kangaroos stood
and watched the passing train.</p>
<p>Right down to the busy junction town of Petersburg you traversed
a big belt of territory so densely populated that everybody's wells
and everybody's dams were marked on the map. More than half the
places were dams. We were in the Land of Dams. It was a good way of
filling a map. Queenslanders did the same; every squattage
homestead, and many of the outcamps&mdash;often only a boundary
rider's humpy&mdash;were marked in their proper latitudinal and
longitudinal positions. It gave the territories an appearance of
being settled. The traveller heard frequent allusions to The
Corners by people living hundreds of miles away in four States; and
when he arrived there he found only a solitary post standing in a
wilderness of mulga. There was a similarly lonely mark on the
south-east coast which some people went into rapture over. It was
only a cairn of stones, marking the boundary of New South Wales and
Victoria: but there the coaster could be in both States at once.
You could be in more than that at The Corners; you could sleep in
New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern
Territory at one and the same time, by coiling up against the
corner post. It was the only spot in Australia where you could be
in so many places at once.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="c17" id="c17"></a><img alt="" src=
"1401641h-images/rule.jpg" width="100" height="3"></p>
<h2>&nbsp;CHAPTER XVII.<br>
The Romance of Old Squattage Homesteads.</h2>
<p>In most parts of Australia the chief squattage residences are
the oldest country homes. In the long stretches we were travelling,
many of them had stood as the only places for as long as the oldest
inhabitant could remember. So it was also in other parts. The
buildings themselves, in all cases, were not old; but the
homesteads were, and many relics remained of the earliest times,
even when the main dwellings had been replaced with new. Wrapped
around every one was a story full of incident and adventure, scraps
of which were told from time to time as the big runs were cut up
for closer settlement. Old hands dipped then into the
half-forgotten history, recalling scenes and episodes that were
strange and romantic to the new generation; and their reminiscences
went back to the exciting days when the squattage was formed; how
they rode forth into the unknown west, in search of grazing
country, up and down creeks and rivers, and over hills and
mountains, making their fires at sunset, and quietly moving on for
a mile or two after tea to camp. This was done to dodge the blacks,
who, attracted by the blaze, would sometimes gather round with,
perhaps, hostile intentions to the invaders.</p>
<p>When the exploring was completed, and the new run decided upon,
a line was blazed for the guidance of teams taking out stores and
tools, and of the men going out with the first mobs of cattle.
These had to be tailed until they settled down on the new run, for
watercourses and mountains were the only boundaries; afterwards
they had to be watched to guard against disturbance by the blacks,
who for ages had been accustomed to kill what they liked in their
own towri. They had to be taught that the invaders had superior
rights. Armed men rode about the runs then on the lookout for
cattle-spearing. The manager of Wooroowoalgoh, on the Richmond
River, while riding along a rise one morning, chanced to look up as
he drew close to a broad-topped wild apple tree. The fine shadow it
cast had taken his eye; but what he saw aloft was disconcerting.
Perched like birds among the limbs were a score of naked blacks.
All were armed, some sitting and some standing, and&nbsp; everyone
was as still and quiet as an ebon statue. What their object was he
did not stop to inquire. He rode straight home and gave an order
for the immediate ring barking of several hundred acres around the
homestead.</p>
<p>A few of the pioneers took timber with them for building; but
when hundreds of miles of trackless bush had to be covered, the
distance being increased by deviations in quest of crossings over
water and passages through rugged ranges, the majority preferred to
produce all their material on the spot. For a few months,
therefore, they lived in tents and bark humpies. Residences of
split slabs and bark roof followed, though some were well built
with sawn timber, which was cut in sawpits. Yulgilbar home, on the
upper part of the Clarence River, is a castle&mdash;the only one in
Australia. Built in a wild and rocky region in the days when
settlements were few and far between, it was an imposing
structure.</p>
<p>In the central parts of the country stone and mud were much used
for building purposes. In Western Queensland are still found at
this time a main residence here and there constructed of mud and
straw, whilst many owners and managers were domiciled in slab and
bark structures. Currawilla, in the neighborhood of Windorah, had a
wall eight feet high and eight feet thick all round it, made of
earth and tallow. This was to keep back the flood waters that come
down Farrar's Creek and spread over miles of the surrounding
country. In flood time the homestead was a unique sight, lying low
and dry in the midst of a swirling brown sea. The floors of the
dwellings were also made of earth and tallow. The owner of this
place, W. H. Watson, was a crack shot with a rifle, used to
consider it a trifling performance to put bullet through a matchbox
stood on a blackfellow's head; and on one occasion he got two
blacks to hold a matchbox between their noses, then he cut it away
with a bullet.</p>
<p>However humble a lot of these places might be, they were marked
on the map; whilst selection houses in the same regions were not.
As a rule, the selector didn't give his place a name. The
squattages were the principal marks in the wide spaces out back,
and the names were as well known as the names of towns. Many of
them were respectable villages; a commodious residence nestling in
a cluster of ornamental trees, with broad lawns and beds of flowers
around it; and nearby stables, stores, smithy, carpenter's shop,
and numerous huts and sheds. At a little distance the big cattle
yards and branding shed, or sheep yards and shearing shed, as the
case might be; and the gallows and haystacks were conspicuous.</p>
<p>Crows, hawks and magpies were always about then; every homestead
had its individual flocks. In the noontide of a hot day, when all
other life was still, the crows that gave greeting to the traveller
suggested a dead place. When travelling once through lonely
country, a near-sighted stockman, who was with me used to ask, when
he thought it time for the next place to be getting near: &quot;See
any crows ahead?&quot;</p>
<p>The magpies gathered there for the sake of the broad clearings.
They seemed to have a fondness for the neighbourhood of houses; but
the squattage homestead was favoured more than any other. Hundreds
of the birds were often to be seen there; distributed about the
spaces between the buildings, in the yards and gardens, and on the
fences and trees. They took no active notice of anybody, and
treated dogs with scorn.</p>
<p>Planted here and there, like an oasis in a desert, the average
homestead looked comfortable, and made an attractive picture. It
had not the architectural finish and ornamentation of city houses;
it was low and spreading with broad verandahs, coolness and utility
being of more importance than elegance. On the dry, western plains
coolness was the main consideration, Built usually in a commanding
position, and in the most favoured and convenient part of the run,
the natural beauties of the environment made it attractive to the
eye, and the white walls and gleaming roof showed boldly in the far
distance. There were some that you came upon suddenly, where there
was no suggestiveness of a homestead, until you were almost within
stone-throw of the door.</p>
<p>In the rich districts, where the aborigines were numerically
strong, nearly every homestead had its history of sieges, of raids
and robberies, murders and dispersals. Here and there the graves of
murdered men and women were pointed on to the visitor; at some
places, like Hornet Bank, on the Dawson River, there was a little
cemetery. &quot;And what happened,&quot; asked the visitor,
&quot;after the murders?&quot; A long mound heaped over with dead
wood was shown him. It was the grave of slaughtered blacks. I was
shown one near Killarney, on the Warengo, where 57 had been
buried&mdash;all thrown into one big trench.</p>
<p>Tomki, on the Richmond River, had stone steps at the back facing
the river. The floor was about three feet from the ground. A man
stepped out there one night to get a drink of water, and a black
fellow, who had been crouched against the wall, cut him down with a
tomahawk. After awhile another man went out to see what was keeping
the first, and he too was struck down. By-and-bye a third followed
to see what had become of the others. He, however, paused on the
step, and by so doing narrowly escaped the same fate.</p>
<p>About this homestead were many huge boilers&mdash;which told
another tale. Woram, near by, had the ruins of an overhead truck
way at one side of the cattle yards, leading from a slaughter-house
to rows of these boilers, all set like massive coppers. In the
early days of these squattages meat became so cheap that the
graziers boiled their cattle down for tallow. About this time there
were boiling-down works near Sydney, and similar works were erected
here and there to within a short distance of the northern border.
Woran was one of the largest.</p>
<p>A hutkeeper, years after the works had fallen into disuse, while
walking along the high rails, slipped and fell into one of the
boilers, where he was imprisoned for two days before his cries were
heard.</p>
<p>The boiling-down was a busy scene in its days of activity. Large
mobs of cattle were ever pouring into it, and in addition to the
band of stockmen and yardmen there were butchers, stokers,
woodcutters and carters, and men who looked after the boiling and
the tallow. Excepting the huts and tents connected with the works,
there was not a habitation of any kind within miles of this hive of
industry. It was a picturesque scene in a wild spot, just a little
back from the bank of the river.</p>
<p>Cattle that would in the nourishing days of squatting that were
to come be worth &pound;10 to &pound;20 a head, were boiled down
there for their fat, and the meat was thrown out to the crows. When
cattle improved in price, only the culls were boiled down.
Gradually this slackened until killing for tallow was discontinued,
and the extensive plant was left to rot and rust.</p>
<p>Numerous homesteads were famed as the scenes of stirring
episodes in the bushranging days, and there were a few that dated
back to the earliest times, around which clung some ugly memories.
Segenhoe, on the Hunter, was a fortified place, flanked by cannon;
and standing brazenly in an open space was a triangle, where unruly
servants were tied and flogged. It was abandoned by the pioneers;
who they were was unknown. When it was rediscovered there was only
a jabbering imbecile&mdash;an ex-convict&mdash;on the premises. The
new owner of the squattage worked it with convict labour. A special
herd of prize cattle were kept to provide milk for his wife to bath
in, the milk being afterwards served out to the convicts. This lady
at a later period became a leading beauty in London. The run was
afterwards cut up into small holdings, and only the homestead and
its memories remained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
The Altered Bush.</h2>
<p>Once or twice in those wide stretches we saw a motor car
whizzing over the weary miles, where only the shortcomings of the
bush road imposed a limit to speed; and the presence of that
vehicle there had more significance to us who had long lived out
back than it could have had to coastal dwellers.</p>
<p>It may be said that modern inventions, more than the spread and
increase of settlement, had altered the aspect of life in the bush
within recent years. Among the most potent factors in this change
must be reckoned the motor car and the telephone. They had
shortened distances, brought once remote places near to populous
centres; and that alone had enveloped the outposts with a different
atmosphere to what was formerly experienced. They took away the
feeling of isolation, so that the settler no longer considered
himself an exile as he once did. Nor was he an age behind the times
in his ideas and methods, or individualised in a world of his own,
as he used to be, for he was as much in touch with the hub of the
universe as the rest of his kind. These two mediums of
comparatively rapid connection had removed forever a phase of
Australian life that had its charm and its romance, but was
invested in no small degree with peril and hardship. No matter
where the new settlements were formed in these later days, even in
the virgin tracts of the Northern Territory, the exact
circumstances of the former periods did not prevail, and so far as
communities, however scattered, were concerned, could never
return.</p>
<p>To the dusky inhabitants of the far lands, the motor was a
terror at first, when it tripped tentatively into the heart of the
primitive. It astonished them even more than did the first camel
they saw. They ran from it as from a smoke-snorting debil-debil.
They understood horse and camel drawn vehicles; but this thing that
whizzed across the country without any apparent aid was an uncanny
mystery. And the goggle-eyed being it carried added to its alarming
aspect. The medicine-man, who concocted tales of the wahwee and the
bunyin, had never imagined anything like that. When it flashed its
huge, glaring white eyes in the dusk, and showed a red eye right
behind, he gasped with amazement and ran for his natural life.</p>
<p>Though both the car and the telephone were yet the privileges of
the rich in the outback where homesteads were widely separated, the
selector, the lonely boundary rider, and even the swagman on the
road, were benefited by their introduction. There might be but one
or two in the district owned by a couple of squatters, but they
crept unconsciously into the services and lives of everybody. This
was best exemplified in the matter of mails and news. When there
was no means of rapid transit, mails were delivered by
horse-mailmen along a main route about once a month, the squattage
homesteads being the principal depots. There were many homesteads
in the parts of the States we had passed through that were 50 miles
or more back from the mailman's track. To get the periodical mail
meant a long ride each way. On some places a boy was kept for this
purpose, who acted as private mail carrier for everybody in the
neighbourhood. At other places the manager drove in to the depot in
a buggy. In either case two or more days were occupied, which, with
the motor car, was reduced to a morning run in and an afternoon run
out.</p>
<p>Earlier still the mails drifted to the out posts about once in
three months; often they were brought out only by teams carrying
supplies. Newspapers came in big bundles, the acumulation of weeks,
and were leisurely digested in the long interim before the next
mail day. Those were leisurely times, but they bred independent men
and women, people who had to rely on their own resources and who
abided by the law of common sense. Today the motor is taking the
place of the mail coach, and making a daily mail possible where a
weekly service was considered good.</p>
<p>What was to the pioneer a long wearisome journey, occupying a
week or more with relays of horses, was merely a few hours' run in
the new era. The ogre of ever-threatening death from thirst had
been banished from the dry tracks. A hundred-mile stage without
water! It was a serious undertaking for a horseman, laden though he
was at the start with waterbags; for the man in the motor car it
was only a brief exhilarating spin between drinks.</p>
<p>The car broke down at times, or refused to go, and in the midst
of a semi-desert region that was apt to be attended with very
serious consequences. Still, with the amount of liquid refreshment
it could carry, the risk was not as great as with knocked-up
horses. The dangerous period of motor overlanding was passed, and
with improvements ever being made there was no part of the
untracked interior that could not be brought into quick touch with
commercial centres. The Never Never was no more, and the horrors of
outback life for womenkind disappeared. In old squatting days it
was no small difficulty to get women to brave the distances. The
squatter's wife had to be content with lubras for servants and
companions; most of the men lived bachelor lives, but once a woman
ventured into their homes she stayed there. The miles were too
many, travelling too slow and difficult, for tripping to town, and
so only an odd one could be persuaded to journey out and share
their exile.</p>
<p>The exiles of outback they were called, those pioneers, who
thinly peopled the wide spaces. Exiles they were for a hundred
years, but quick transit made a wonderful change. It made the
farthest places accessible and endurable to women, and where the
women went, settlement progressed.</p>
<p>It was when sickness called, when some serious accident
happened, that the isolation told hardest on women and children. In
the early annals of the bush we find many trials of endurance, many
a deed of heroism; we read of long hard rides for a doctor,
occupying all day and all night, and not infrequently undertaken by
girls and women. In such cases the journey back, accompanied by the
doctor, was harder still. There was no way of sending a telegram
without an equally long ride, and when a patient had to be taken in
he was subjected to a slow, rough trip that endangered his chances
of recovering.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the motor car was available in such emergencies. It
might be a few hours' ride to the nearest owner, but in serious
cases it was always ready, and it made short work of what would be
an all night ride on horseback. It enabled the mother to nurse her
sick child on the journey in comparative comfort, whereas formerly
the child was carried in front of a desperate horseman.</p>
<p>Here, too, the telephone was a factor in calling for aid, in the
saving of time and labour and horseflesh. On big runs the
homesteads were connected by telephone with the boundary-riders'
huts and out camps, and with the townships. The wires about the run
were usually carried on the fences. Until this innovation cheapened
and facilitated the control of runs, the boundary-rider was a
lonely person who rarely saw a human being between mustering times
and the fortnightly or monthly occasions when he was visited by the
ration carrier. He might be thrown or injured, or be seized with
sickness, and lie helpless in his camp until some casual visitor
happened to look in. Now he could ring up headquarters or a
neighbouring camp. He was in communication with his boss and
fellows almost daily. Also, those camps were handy to surrounding
settlers, and the service of the telephone saved many a long ride
and many a life. In conjunction with the motor car it had stripped
the lone places of half their terrors, and made the outposts more
habitable to women and children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br>
Through the Wheat Areas&mdash;The Farm Home&mdash;Gossip Along the
Line.</h2>
<p>From Petersburg down we got glimpses of pretty valleys and
grassy slopes, picturesque homesteads and villages, and big wheat
fields. But the giant timber, the grandeur of mount and gorge that
flashed past on the line from Melbourne to Albury and from Albury
to Sydney were wanting. The enthusiasm of Broken Hillites and
Centralians when the scent of burning bush and grass came to them,
and the smoke of small bush fires floated over us, was a joke to
Victorians and East Coasters. Nobody got burnt out in Centralia.
Perhaps they would not either in the eastern regions if they could
run sheep instead of cattle. A blackfellow, finding his native game
disappearing, observed of the mooching merino: &quot;No good that
pfella. All day feed; all night walk about. Turkey can't lay um
egg; emu can't sit&mdash;him ruin in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Through the wheat areas farmers watched the passing train with
anxiety, not only because it belched sparks, but because careless
travellers had a way of unburdening themselves of their superfluous
glassware as they passed along. Numbers of passengers carried
bottles on long journeys, the contents of which might be milk, or
ginger beer, or lime juice; and as these were emptied they were
pitched through the windows, regardless of the fact that gangers
were always working somewhere on the line, and children were often
standing in unexpected places watching the train go by. The
offenders rarely knew where they were when they cast the dead
marine, nor did they know from a moving train where it would land.
Many a bush fire has been started by a bottle or a piece of broken
glass, lying among dry quick-kindling stuff with a hot sun shining
on it. For this reason the wheat-growers gathered them up and threw
them into creeks, or stood them on stumps. When a bottle-disgorging
train passed every second day or so this was no joke.</p>
<p>In these parts the wax match was taboo, and anybody seen
carrying a firestick would be chased as a lunatic, or arrested by
the nearest trooper for imperilling life and property. Nearly
everybody used safety matches, and no one was allowed to smoke an
uncovered pipe in the august presence of a wheatfield.</p>
<p>When the grass was long and the wheat was maturing, the settlers
formed themselves into amateur fire brigades, and each man was
pledged to look carefully around himself every five minutes for
smoke, and to keep a telescopic eye and blunderbuss trained on any
chance swagman who obtruded on the horizon. New handles were wedged
into tomahawks; the wood axe was ground in readiness for chopping
bushes, and a supply of bags, tied on the ends of sticks, was kept
on hand. Instructions were given to station masters to transmit
telegraphic and telephonic messages free of cost, so that when
Jones dropped a match, or a spark from his pipe, he could ring up
Smith, Brown and Robinson to come and put their conjoint foot on it
and prevent a national disaster.</p>
<p>We had an argument about matches along here, and the conclusion
arrived at was that those farmers were protecting the safety match
manufacturers more than themselves. Fires did not result, except in
rare cases, from carelessly dropping matches about where a hot sun
would cause combustion; but from throwing them down after they had
been struck by smokers, and there was nothing about the safety to
preclude its being thrown down in a similar way and doing just as
much damage.</p>
<p>The overseer said he had seen fires started by horses striking
sparks from stones with their shod hooves. From this it was deduced
that a man wearing hobnails or protectors in his boots was also a
menace to the community; and we resolved that when we became
farmers that it should be penal to wear boots at all in dry
weather, and any man with a glass eye was to be shifted off the
premises with the greatest despatch.</p>
<p>On one occasion, in New South Wales, several months after bush
fires had swept Albury district, the police presented a report as
to the causes of 36 of the outbreaks. Phosphorus (laid for rabbits)
was credited with 12 disasters; wax matches (dropped accidentally),
2; sun's rays, through glass, 1; persons wilfully setting fire to
grass, 3; careless use of fire, 3; machinery bearings becoming
heated, 1; lightning, 1; sparks from railway engines, 2. In the
other cases the causes were not ascertainable. To a smart officer
who could track up a wax match, dropped accidentally, and consumed
in the conflaguation a long time previously, any cause at all
should have been ascertainable.</p>
<p>Here and. there we passed a cosy farm house, which took the eyes
of such of our lady travellers who had lived only in congested
areas. There were some things which the farm wife had which they
envied; there were other things which &quot;would never suit
them.&quot; They envied the roominess of the country home and its
environment, and the plenitude of necessaries which their rustic
sister enjoyed, and which cost so much in town. There was no call
to pay bills every day in the week; there were none of the rates
and taxes that the town dweller knew&mdash;though the conveniences
begotten of such were also absent; and living and dressing were
comparatively cheap. Dresses and hats lasted longer, for farm life
was more unconventional than city life. There was an abundance of
wood in the paddock, and plenty of water in the creek. The farm
supplied milk fresh and pure; butter, eggs, poultry, bacon, and
other meat in wholesale quantities, and fruit and vegetables in any
variety. There was also fish, which they could catch for
themselves. Horses and vehicles suggested pleasant rides and
drives, where the outlook promised entrancing country views, and
where little adventures and incidents enlivened the way. Above all,
there was a wholesome atmosphere, freedom from contaminating ills,
an air of supreme ownership, complete privacy, and a home that was
more really home, more comforting and more satisfying in
itself.</p>
<p>That was the bright side; but, alack, for the dreamer of rural
simplicity, there was a seamy side as well. In the view of most
city women the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. The farm wife
gets up with the hens. She bustles through her housework in the
morning, does a turn in the dairy, washes a pile of cans and
dishes, takes tea and scones down to the men about 10.30, then
cooks dinner. No butcher or baker calls; there is no ham and beef
shop, nor any other shop, to run to in emergencies; she must
prepare everything herself. In the afternoon, besides taking crib
to the men and getting tea ready, she found time to hunt for eggs,
to make and mend. After tea, when all the washing-up was done, she
sat darning and knitting, or sewing, or perhaps helped for an hour
or two in the barn. Washing day was her busy day; harvesting was
her busiest time of all. Often she lent a hand at some light work
in the field, but she managed to keep cheerful through it all, and
look after several young children at the same time. She didn't want
a neighbour to gossip with over the garden fence. Neither did she
look for trams and busses on the quiet, grey road, nor yearn for
the shows and entertainments, the gaiety and pleasures of the town.
But these were things the visitor found hardest to cut adrift from.
She saw dullness in their stead, and that with the long hours and
the extra work made her shake her head doubtfully, and deny herself
and her children the benefit of the farm home.</p>
<p>It was interesting to note the leading topics of conversation on
the sections of a long line. Leaving the Silver City, and until you
got to Petersburg, whence the line branched to Port Pirie, where
the Broken Hill ores were treated, everyone was interested in
mining, and discussed the fluctuations in the price of lead and
silver; you heard of the perils of tunnelling, the dangers of the
open cut, of men being leaded, of odd ones being roasted in boiling
slag, of creeps in Block 10, and of falls of earth in the Big Mine.
You could hear the whole history of the Barrier if you cared to
keep awake; and when you reached the Burra you heard something
about copper; but on nearing Gawler, and until the lights of Port
Adelaide blazed across the flat to the rightward, you found that
all newcomers were concerned about the price of wheat, and the
state of the weather, and they stripped and threshed and harvested
over the whole hundred and thirty odd miles. Thence on to Adelaide
the topic was&mdash;the City of Churches.</p>
<p>So, too, on the run to Melbourne. From Adelaide to the Murray,
and to Glenorchy, on the Wimmera River, it was dried fruits,
vineyards and wine, timber and agriculture; while from Stawell, one
of the prettiest of Victorian towns, right down to Bacchus Marsh,
it was of gold&mdash;gold and Eureka! Indeed, you could not help
talking of gold, and resuscitating the golden tales of old; for on
nearing Ararat, and thence onward till you passed Ballarat, you saw
the miners' tents gleaming whitely through the suckers on either
side, and you passed along between thousands of mining shafts, with
little heaps of dirt dotting hill and flat for miles. Here
generations after generations had chased the golden speck; it had
been a diggings of world-wide fame from the earliest times, and
would continue so for generations hence. Its glory would never
die.</p>
<p>But we are ahead of our train. A rest in Adelaide to stretch our
legs in the broad parks and gardens, to see the animals in the Zoo,
and for a row on the Torrens, floating under graceful willow trees,
is a good tonic before we go rushing across Victoria.</p>
<p>Adelaide, designated the City of Churches, and the City of
Light, was the best laid-out of all the capital cities, thanks to
Colonel Light, its founder. It was sweet and clean, and delighted
one with its straight, wide streets, its grassy squares and
spacious parks, and its beautiful background of billowy hills.</p>
<p>The centre of attraction outside was Mt. Gambler, with its
wonderful Blue Lake and the underground river. One could sail a
long distance down the subterranean stream, which flowed seawards
through a great, cave-like channel. The Blue Lake, the banks of
which were 300ft. high, almost sheer, and the water 240ft. deep in
the centre, with its sister lakes, the Middle and the Valley, had
for their basins the craters of extinct volcanoes that had made the
vicinity very sultry in their day of active eruption. The
unpleasantnesses had been extinct for many thousands of years. But
the overseer said you could never trust a volcano. Though it might
be apparently dead for ages, it was always liable to spring up
again without warning and overwhelm the trusting inhabitants. To
make an abiding place on an old crater was tempting Fate. He much
preferred the other end of the continent for a residential
site.</p>
<p>The central State had many peculiar features that were sometimes
grimly fascinating to the traveller, notably the bottomless,
natural wells, from a yard to three yards wide in diameter, and
going down as straight as a gun barrell, how far no one had ever
been able to determine. Biscuit Flat, which was thickly strewn with
biscuit like stones, as novel as the skull hills on Whittabranah
Creek, in the Corner, which were strewn with stones resembling
petrified human skulls cut off just below the neck; Dismal Swamp, a
vast marsh, 80 miles in circumference, and dotted with green
islets; and &quot;The Monster,&quot; a huge granite rock, from
which oozed a spring of crystal clear water. The latter
centralised, and was the only natural water in the great Mallee
scrub, several thousand square miles in area, known as the
Ninety-Mile Desert. It was a gloomy-looking land, seen from the top
of &quot;The Monster,&quot; and that appeared to be the only reason
why the term desert was applied to it, for it was entirely covered
with almost impenetrable scrub. This Mallee territory was pioneered
by Edward Harewood Lascelles, of Lake Coorong squattage, and
subsequently through his lead and encouragement settled by
farmers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br>
When the Bushman Visits the City.</h2>
<p>Some folks are never contented away from home; they like to be
always amid their own familiar surroundings. But the typical
Australian likes to move about, especially in his young days. The
wanderlust is in most of those who never travel; want of
opportunity or lack of freedom keeping them continuously in the
place they were born in; and there are few who do not desire to see
the State's capital city.</p>
<p>To the people outback, Adelaide or Melbourne or Sydney is a
wonderland; they picture it as something immensely more attractive
than what it really is. The first visit is often a
delusion&mdash;if not a snare. The bushman who has hitherto been
used to a homely hotel in a quiet little country town feels lost
and out of place at once, no matter what quarters he gets into. The
friendliness and comradeship that exists even among strangers
outback is totally wanting here. In the country every man trusts
his neighbour, whether he knows him or not; he is taken to be
worthy and honest until he proves himself otherwise; in the city
any stranger who is disposed to be friendly is treated with
suspicion until his honesty is assured.</p>
<p>That is the first shock that the bushman receives; he is lost
and lone in the midst of crowds. No one takes any friendly notice
of him on the road or in the street; whereas, if he passed a
wayfarer on a country road without some kind of greeting, that
party would feel slighted.</p>
<p>He gets another shock when he finds himself temporarily out of
tobacco or matches, and asks the nearest smoker to accommodate him,
as he has been used to doing in his own district. The nearest
smoker is almost certain to be out of the needful himself, and he
accompanies the information with a look that is usually bestowed on
the park loafer. The bushman tries one or two more, but he is not
very long in the city before he drops that country habit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he is a good mark for the spongers and
sharpers in the city. They pick him out at sight. Though he may
dress like the men around him; though he may walk along as they do,
with all the unconcern he can muster, and showing no unusual
interest in the shop windows, he still fails utterly to conceal the
fact that he is not a townsman, that he hails from the realm of the
gums and the gidgees.</p>
<p>It is mainly the way he carries himself, and especially his
hands, that gives him away. His fellows in the bush have told him
not to stare about him, or stand looking at the shops; but he
observes that most cityites do both, and no notice is taken of
them&mdash;except by the traffic constable, while everybody notices
him, though he affects the greatest indifference to everything
around him. He has an air about him as he moves along that
distinguishes him easily from the frequenters of the pavements.</p>
<p>The undesirable class who prowl around in search of the
guileless stranger take him down in some way or other, however
careful he is, and in spite of all the good advice he has received.
Good-natured and trusting at first, he gives freely to the hardened
cadgers who ask him for the price of a bed or a meal; and when he
grows suspicious of that appeal, the plausible tale of hardship and
suffering, of poverty and misfortune, that is readily poured out by
the accomplished dead-beat still penetrates to his pocket.</p>
<p>Occasionally he discovers that his cash has evaporated, and his
watch and chain have likewise disappeared; for he is shepherded by
men and women who spin no pitiful tales, but deftly help themselves
in moments when he has struck something of absorbing interest, or
become wedged in a crowd.</p>
<p>There is another party who meets him boldly, and calls him by
name; he knows all about the district Bushy comes from, having
possibly ascertained certain facts previously at his hotel, or from
labels on his luggage when he arrived; and he is surprised that
Bushy doesn't remember him. They have a drink, and from that drink
any one of a dozen humiliating adventures may happen. It may lead
to a game of cards, to a visit to a shady saloon or a gambling den,
to an introduction to two or three associates of the
&quot;confidence&quot; class. Whatever course is shaped, one thing
is certain&mdash;he will come out of it with empty pockets. Even
the rich uncle in Fiji at times still makes a little haul at his
expense.</p>
<p>The first man who sets out to exploit him on his arrival is the
runner at the hotel. This person receives commission in several
lines of business, principally from tailors, tobacconists, secret
betting shops, and small vendors of hats and boots. He tells Bushy
that he can show him where to get a good suit dirt cheap; a suit
that was made to order for a man of his build who did not call for
it, and so it was left on the tailor's hands. The price was four
guineas; but as the man who ordered it paid a guinea deposit, he
can have it for the balance. Thinking he is getting a bargain,
Bushy accompanies the runner to the shop, and it doesn't matter
whether the suit fits him or not, they mostly sell him something
before he goes out.</p>
<p>Other tailors and shopkeepers have men posted on the footpath to
watch for the party who has just come down. They accost any
likely-looking person who might be persuaded into buying something
he doesn't want; but the man from outback is the best mark. It is
easier to get his attention than that of the cityite, who gazes
straight ahead with eyes that see everything but appear to see
nothing; he is more easily inveigled into the shop, and once there
it is pretty certain he won't come out without a parcel.</p>
<p>The city at first bewilders him. Though he can travel unerringly
through trackless bush, and strike straight for home from any
point, in the city he will possibly get lost if he only turns a
couple of corners. In the strange environment he looks a dull,
stupid sort of person; while in the bush he is probably one of the
smartest of men. The cityite, however, is far more conspicuous when
dumped down in the bush; he is much more of a laughing-stock there
than the bushman is in the city. The latter gets used to his new
surroundings in a few weeks; but the new chum from town takes years
to become a smart, practical bushman.</p>
<p>Again, the man from wayback can ride full gallop on a dark night
through thick timber to stem the rush of frightened cattle, and
never make a blunder, or for a moment lose his presence of mind;
yet a few trams and motor cars passing and repassing in a city
street confuse him, and he hesitates or runs when a city woman will
walk serenely across, leading a child by the hand.</p>
<p>When we had to cross a busy street the overseer acted as if he
wanted somebody to take his hand. He saw people jumping off trams
before the trams had stopped. He had done more wonderful things
than that; he had jumped off bucking horses, and he had sprung
clear from animals falling over logs and fences; so with every
confidence he too stepped off the moving tram, and when he struck
the ground with the back of his head he wondered how it had
happened.</p>
<p>That was the first shock we got, for he professed to be a
travelled man, used to big towns. He acted as leader. The first
place he struck for was the waxworks. Then the Zoo, the Gardens,
the Museum, the Art Gallery, and the racecourse followed in order.
At the last place he won &pound;5, in consequence of which he
acquired a somewhat lordly air on the way home; but when he put his
hand in his pocket to pay his fare there was nothing in it. He was
skinned out. We had to lend him half a crown to take him home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br>
The Suburbanite's Little Garden.</h2>
<p>Our boarding-house had a narrow side verandah, which was so
crowded with plants in pots and tubs and tins that there was barely
room for a person to walk along the edge of it. You brushed the
staghorn fern going into the dining-room; the herring-bone fern
threatened to go with you into your bedroom; and &quot;mind the
magnolias, please,&quot; was the sweet injunction of the old lady
when two or three of us stepped outside together.</p>
<p>That pathetic little garden directed our attention to a host of
similar plots else where.</p>
<p>There is in the most prosaic and town-ridden person some inkling
love for Dame Nature. Though born and bred in the cramped
environment of endless rows of jerry-built houses, abutting on the
pavement in front and with a backyard that could be covered with an
ordinary table cloth, the love and yearning still persists within
him, as is shown by his desperate efforts to make something grow.
In the most sordid surroundings, in the most cramped positions, you
will find some evidence, however trifling, of the old love
struggling to assert itself. It may be merely a staghorn fern
nailed to the wall, a pot of ferns on the front window-sill, a
creeper trained up the post, or an array of old tins and
flower-pots on a stand, whose architecture is crude and amateurish.
Still, the old instinct of the gardener is there.</p>
<p>It is said that no man or woman can be really bad who has an
infatuation for gardening. The tending of a delicate plant,
watching it growing from day to day, and budding, blooming and
seeding, with the studies of the secrets and mysteries of inanimate
life, while it improves the mind, must have some influence for good
on the character; and there is no physical occupation that is
healthier than the ancient one of tickling the soil to make it bear
fruit. The gardener lives and works in close communion with Nature,
especially if his field of operations is in country parts, where he
can swing his hoe without hitting the clothes-line. It is here that
the inherent savage of the enthusiast is suggested, harking back to
the days when our ancestors sat on the grass and cracked nuts; for
these two characteristics, the tendency to run wild like an
unguarded plant, and the desire to scratch around and grow nuts,
only want the time and place and opportunity to assert themselves.
Some people maintain that it is essentially modern, and an
illustration of the highly-civilised state of our home-life, to
surround our dwellings with flowers and trees and cabbages; but it
is merely the old instinct at work, the influence of the
prehistoric forest that can't be shaken off; the call of the wild
that the ages will never silence.</p>
<p>Parts of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are noted for
their beautiful gardens, and fine houses almost hidden in a
wilderness of trees&mdash;as they should be; but the average urban
and suburban garden, which would take an active caterpillar nearly
half an hour to cross, is a mixture of the humorous and the
pathetic. Though the inclination is strong, the knowledge of the
art hasn't been inherited, while the soil is not always up to
requirements. In Sydney it is a hungry, thirsty soil that supplies
all necessary exercise to the muscles to keep it in order. Some of
the more enthusiastic have shifted the surface-strata of their
backyards on to the vacant allotment, and replaced it with
promising-looking soil from elsewhere, carrying it in buckets and
bags. Gardening is an arduous task that requires this beginning,
particularly when it has to be done in the evening, after the day's
&quot;work&quot; is over, or in the morning before breakfast is
ready. Poor people, one might so conclude, who want to grow a few
vegetables to eke out the weekly wage? No; they want to grow
geraniums or a massed bed of cosmos. They are lovers of
flowers.</p>
<p>Properly, the flower garden should be in the foreground, and
here and there you see a few blooms gracing the front of the
limited dwelling. The plants may be common, but they receive no
less attention for that. Both husband and wife take an interest in
them; they admire them, and talk about them more than they do of
the finest blossom in the Botanic Gardens. The plot may be six feet
wide and quite three yards long, but the care of it has its
annoyances. Children pluck the flowers within reach as they pass,
and when no one is about they climb the fence and strip the garden.
&quot;You can't keep a thing from them,&quot; the women tell you.
That is why you so often see the flowers in the backyard, and the
front plot covered with buffalo grass&mdash;which is the
lawn&mdash;with perhaps a palm in the corner.</p>
<p>Flowers naturally appeal to a woman's artistic taste; she is in
her natural setting, in her proper element, among flowers. What she
knows and what she doesn't know about them is a marvellous mixture.
She can tell man their names and their colours off hand, when they
come in and when they go out, and the proper time of the year to
plant them&mdash;matters which he is always uncertain about; but he
has to show her how to plant them and how to look after them. She
works with toy tools&mdash;ladies' sets.
&quot;Hen-scratching,&quot; he calls it. In dry weather she uses a
toy watering can, which gently sprinkles the plant and leaves the
roots dry. There is nothing she loves better than treading among
the beds with a pair of scissors in her hand. Snipping with a
scissors is a morning recreation she enjoys. She doesn't cut the
hidden blooms and those at the bottom; she darts for the best and
biggest, which are usually at the top, thus spoiling the plant.
When she undertakes the task of thinning, trimming and pruning, the
ruination is complete.</p>
<p>For one who is painstaking, skilled and natty in a house, in
various arts and crafts, her awkwardness and want of efficiency in
horticultural pursuits is surprising. It is a field of labour
eminently suited to her&mdash;a field which she leaves to the old
man. That is, she leaves all the work to him, while she potters
around in his way, telling him what to do. She regards the flower
garden as part of her own domain&mdash;where she is boss and hubby
is the underdog. At the same time hundreds of young women waste
their energies with dumbells and other physical drill. The best
developers are garden tools, and the most robust health is obtained
in the sunshine, among the flowers.</p>
<p>There was one man a few doors from our boarding house who grew
all his flowers in pots, and, having nowhere else to put them, he
stood them along on the bottom rail of the divisional fence. He
thought this a secure and satisfactory place for his favourites;
but it wasn't. His next-door neighbour had purchased a rooster for
a Sunday treat, and not being experienced in slaughtering poultry,
and having no one to hold it for him, he hung it by the hind legs
to the top of the palings. Then he got the wood axe, and measuring
his distance, aimed a terrific blow at its neck&mdash;and missed.
He had been unaware of the horticultural exhibition on the other
side; but when he heard the crash and the smashing of pottery,
followed immediately by hurried footsteps through the other house,
he dropped the axe and fled indoors.</p>
<p>For 20 minutes or so he listened to the caustic remarks of the
injured party, and not until all was quiet again did he step out to
complete the butchering. Being a little unnerved by the result of
his first effort, and in a hurry to get the job over, his aim this
time was even more erratic; but the crash on the other side was
greater than before. The horticulturist had replanted the flowers
and rearranged the collection during the interim, a fact which the
chook-slayer had not suspected. He fled again; and though presently
he was invited in a loud voice to come out and explain what he
meant by it, he remained squatting behind the door in the scullery.
Not till long after the commotion had ceased did he venture to look
out. Then he saw his fowl lying in the yard, and its head was off.
The injured flower-grower had decapitated it with neatness and
determination.</p>
<p>This man, who had no open space for his flowers, used all the
spare land he had at the back of his premises for growing
vegetables. When a strip was taken out of it for a path to the back
gate its area was not extensive. Then the clothes-line hung across
it diagonally, and every washing-day left its stamp on that plot.
Sheets and such things flapped against the tomatoes, and when the
prop slipped, which it did with monotonous regularity, it mostly
fell on the beans. His eye could detect, too, where his wife's
little foot had trodden his new beds, though her careful hands had
brushed over the surface soil to hide the imprint. But he was a
patient soul, and could overlook little things like that. What
annoyed him was the street urchins' football, which would thump
down into the lettuce and bounce off them into the beet-root; and
their cricket ball, which bowled over the asparagus, and threw out
the young squashes every half-hour or so. Should none of the
occupants of the house be about to recover the balls, the boys
climbed over the fence and got them themselves; and going out they
unbolted the gate and left it open, thereby tempting the small fry
to look on the strawberries when they're red. At night the cats
made the plot a common meeting-place. It was a nice change from
asphalt and road metal, and the softer he kept it the more they
scratched and rolled around. They also settled their differences
there, fighting gory battles over the onions, and smashing down the
cabbages.</p>
<p>Despite all drawbacks he persevered. Home-grown vegetables, he
would tell you, were so much nicer than what you buy. They were a
long way from perfection when matured, but they were fresh, and
free from certain ugly suspicions that hang about the Chinaman's
garden. Neither were they cheap, for, no matter what he planted,
some persistent pest came along to live on it, and required all
manner of directions and solutions to keep under. He spent tedious
hours day after day in killing small grubs and caterpillars and
aphis, and in gathering up snails and slugs. The snail was
comparatively easy to hunt down and exterminate, but the slug had
to be pursued at night with a lantern. When other men were taking
their proper rest after tea, and smoking the pipe of peace, this
suburbanite was spearing slugs with a pin-pointed skewer. When he
found them in a bunch he vanquished them with salt. In the dusk,
too, as well as early morning, the clatter of his watering-cans
could be heard. Gallons upon gallons of water he emptied upon that
plot, which kept the plants alive between showers.</p>
<p>The study of his neighbours' gardens was sometimes fruitful, for
here he saw a dozen experiments at once, and could adopt the most
successful without paying anything for the idea. Not that the
gardeners were scientists, or the experiments deliberate. Smith
sowed his beans in dense clusters like stools of cane, each cluster
a yard apart, because he thought that the proper way. Jones planted
his in a circle like a circus ring, with a pelargonium in the
centre, either for the same reason, or because there was no other
way of doing it in the space available. Brown grew pumpkins and
cucumbers in barrels and cases and tubs, standing on the asphalt,
and trained the vines along the fences. Robinson sowed corn and
peas together, so that the peas would run up the cornstalks and
save sticks.</p>
<p>An observant man could not fail to pick up points about
gardening where so many experiments were going on. In one little
plot there was no room for experiments, but when there were many
little plots, and the owner of each had his own ideas about
agriculture, they answered the purpose just as well. Especially
were they serviceable in showing the most suitable time for
planting, for rain decided with many when to put in the crop. Nor
were their methods of working devoid of interest. The sight of a
man or woman breaking up the plantation with a tomahawk or an axe
would arrest anyone's attention. The butcher's knife and the
carving forks were other handy tools in use. The spade, which cut
the roots of everything growing, was the common tool; and in the
handling of that simple implement the awkwardness of the
suburbanite was notorious. If you want to know if an applicant for
a gardening job has had experience in that department gave him a
spade, and the matter will be clear in two minutes. To a man who
has been used to digging post holes or trenches the spade will be
familiar; but digging post holes and digging garden-beds level are
widely different things.</p>
<p>The little gardens were not without their value to the
municipality. Some of them required an awful lot of nourishment.
So, early and late, Smith, Jones, Brown and Robinson were seen
wandering about the streets and back lanes, each with a bucket in
one hand and a fire-shovel or coal-scuttle in the other, collecting
manure. By this means they saved the street-sweepers a lot of work,
besides keeping the neighbourhood clean. Sometimes there was a
one-horse stable in the vicinity, and the only trouble the owner
had was in trying to oblige so many with the pleasure of clearing
his stable litter away for him.</p>
<p>The little garden was also a fine object lesson for the
children. The suburbanite was delighted to see his little boy
interested in turnips, and he explained to him the mysteries of the
beetroot, which neither of them understood. The boy sowed seeds all
over the premises, and by-and-bye the miscellaneous crop became a
source of wonder to his elders. At this stage of the garden's
perplexities the boy knew more than the man. He watched his father
put out tomato plants; next day he carefully lifted each one to see
if it had taken root. The bee in the flower also attracted him; but
when he had caught his first one he learnt all he wanted to know
about bees in two seconds.</p>
<p>The suburbanite's little garden was a
convenience&mdash;especially to the next-door neighbour, whose
greengrocer never seemed to have any parsley or sage or mint or
marjoram, when these herbs were growing alongside. Suburbanite
didn't begrudge trifles of this sort, only it appeared to affect
next-door's greengrocer, who became even more remiss. When the crop
of five cabbages and nine turnips were ready for harvesting, a head
popped over the fence, and the owner, after explaining that the old
man would soon be home, and that she was behind with dinner through
the hawker and the shop not having the greens she required, said in
a most ingratiating tone of voice: &quot;Would you mind lending me
a cabbage and three turnips till Saturday?&quot; Suburbanite
wouldn't have minded that either, but the cabbage and the turnips
became even as the mystery of the good ship Waratah. Nothing more
was ever heard about them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br>
Going Down to Build the Federal Capital&mdash;Heroes of the Camp
Fires.</h2>
<p>We left Adelaide late in the afternoon, and so much of the
daylight was spent in going through long, dark tunnels and narrow
cuttings, numerous in the Mount Barker and Mount Lofty country,
that it might as well have been night. There was nothing to be seen
in a tunnel, and the cutting was a device that shut out all the
countryside.</p>
<p>We were locked in like prisoners before starting, and only
released at places where there was at least three minutes' interval
between the arrival and departure of the train. Then we were locked
up again for safe custody. On the Melbourne end of the line we
enjoyed more freedom. A passenger could lean out through the open
window without fear of having his thinking end dashed against a
junk of rock, or something equally unpleasant; and he might break
his journey if he felt that way inclined by taking a dive on to the
swimming ballast without hindrance. There were people who did that
sort of thing, and it was a thoughtful Government that ukased that
railway passengers should be kept securely under lock and key. It
was necessary for their own well-being and the good of the
country.</p>
<p>The bulk of our luggage, which we had not removed from the
station at Adelaide, was now travelling in bond; and as we did not
remove it from the Melbourne station either, it remained in that
happy condition until we got back into New South Wales. We didn't
have any contraband about us that I know of; still, this
not-wanted-on-the-voyage method saved us a lot of inconvenience
with Customs officials. Travelling by the ordinary train, which
stopped overnight at Serviceton, on the Victorian border, you had
another Customs house to negotiate; and there was still another at
Albury on the N.S.W. border; and yet another at Cockburn, on the
S.A. border.</p>
<p>These matters naturally turned one's attention to Federation. We
had some people from the back country on board, who, anticipating a
rush of work and good wages when the building of the Federal
capital was started, were going down in a hurry to get a pick of
the choice jobs. When I look back to that time, nearly 20 years
ago, and recollect that our statesmen were still wrangling over the
capital, it seems to me that those people would not have missed
much if they had waited for the next train.</p>
<p>When the subject of the city was first seriously introduced the
estimate was that it would be built and everything in full swing in
three years. More than that time was exhausted in the squabble of
the territory. Then commenced the long series of picnics in
connection with the choosing of the site, and the disputes and
debates concerning it, that made it a laughing stock throughout
Australia. Almost every representative in Parliament after
Parliament deemed it necessary to make a personal inspection of the
place. There were so many picnics thereabouts in the course of
years that the local inhabitants could hardy find footroom for
bottles and tins. These not only covered the landscape, but
threatened to choke up the famous Cotton River. When it all ended
and the boldest Parliamentarian was ashamed to go near it any more,
it was expected that there would really be some push and progress.
Word came from time to time that surveyors were at work; they were
at work a very long while; but it seemed that their surveys and
delineations were for the information of architects all over the
universe, who might engage in competition for the prizes offered
for town plans. Then the debate about the name piled up sheaves of
volubility before Canberra was decided upon. When the grand
buildings began tardily to rear their domes and minarets to the
sky, the site of the noble city was very old and familiar to the
surviving debaters, who were able to point out to their
great-grandchildren the historic spots where they camped and
picnicked in their youth.</p>
<p>The passengers on our train who were going down to build this
city were men who worked at many occupations, from mining to
bush-carpentering, from shearing to farming; and hour after hour
they talked of these and kindred professions, and discussed the
heroes of the camp fires.</p>
<p>Every shearing season city people heard a good deal about
champion shearers and the big tallies that were cut in various
sheds. The big tally somehow interested all classes of people, and
so the champion shearer was a subject that never died. No name was
better known throughout Australia for the time being than that of
the man who could take off more fleeces in a day than anybody else.
Who was not familiar, for instance, with the names of Jacky Howe
and Jimmy Power, who held the records in their time for hand and
machine work respectively? There were 50 others whose names were
almost as well known to newspaper readers, and who attracted crowds
from many miles away to the sheds where they worked.</p>
<p>The champion buckjump rider was another who had become familiar
to the cities; so also had the skilled axemen and the stockwhip
expert. Cattle drafting on horseback in the open, as was done
everywhere on the big runs; lassooing and throwing beasts, and
throwing them without ropes, were other items that brought a few of
the cracks together at times to display their skill on the
showgrounds. But the bush held many giants who never came on to the
public stage. The bush man took a pride in his work, no matter what
the work might be. Though he laboured in many capacities he usually
excelled in one. That was his speciality, and in that it was his
ambition to beat his rivals.</p>
<p>Every calling&mdash;in every district&mdash;had its best man,
who was known to everybody else and whose feats were discussed
around the campfires. To those who worked among timber the champion
oarsman or the champion runner was of less importance than the man
who could split the most palings in a day, or cut out the greatest
number of sleepers. In the days when shingle-roof houses were
fashionable there were many proud wielders of the &quot;throw&quot;
who established phenomenal records in turning out shingles; and
more than one match had taken place between rival claimants of the
championship. The same rivalry existed among the pit-sawyers about
the same time in many a cedar scrub and rich forest.</p>
<p>The aspirant to fencing honours had several tall marks to aim
for&mdash;the record number of postholes sunk in a day, the
greatest quantity of posts mortised for rails, the highest total
bored for wire, and the best tally in erecting one or two-rail
fencing. By way of encouraging him he was told that one man put up
such a lot in a day that it took him two days to walk back to his
starting point. He was also enlightened as to the tricks of the
unscrupulous&mdash;for there were tricks in all trades. There were
men. who sunk their posts only a few inches in the ground,
splitting them short, or cutting the bottom end off where the
ground was hard; and there was the party who took a contract of
boring several miles of posts, and who merely entered the bit on
each side of the posts to give them the appearance of being
bored.</p>
<p>The adze and the squaring axe were tools that had their noted
wielders in the same region. They were dangerous implements in the
hands of a newchum; but the expert could take either and with it
chip the stubbles from a man's chin as neatly as a barber could
shave it off with a razor. The squarer worked among heavy bridge
timber, piles and heavy logs, which were squared before being
trucked away to the mill. Barns and sheds were largely built of
rough timber, which the adze and the squaring axe had to lick into
shape; and many a bush hut was constructed of split timber,
including the floor, doors and shutters, all trimmed and levelled
by the adept use of the same tools.</p>
<p>To make a name on a farm required the ability to pull more corn,
to husk more cobs, to dig more spuds or milk more cows than anybody
else. Sowing up bags of wheat and baling wool had their experts,
whose deeds were occasionally reported in the newspapers; so had
tossing sheaves on the hayfields; so had the loading and stacking
of hay. It was not every agricultural worker who could build a
stack, even a small one. Properly constructed, the immense pile
would stand in the open for years, impervious to weather. It
resembled a hobble-skirt, with squared extremities and gable top,
being narrowed at the feet, bulged out at the waist, and topped
like the roof of a house. Every big harvest field had its specials
whose functions was to pile up hay artistically.</p>
<p>A couple of unprofessionals took on a stacking job once on a
Hunter River farm. It was only a small one, and they had barely
finished when a windstorm arrived. As forking hay in the wind only
loaded the air with flying straws, the farmer sat under the stack
to smoke till the blow was over. A strong gust suddenly toppled the
heap over on top of him, and before the builders could fork him out
the lighted pipe had set fire to it. When last seen in that
vicinity the two rescuers were making a bee-line for the high road
in a frenzied condition.</p>
<p>Before the days of labour-saving machinery the expert wielder of
the scythe was a person of considerable renown. An acre a day of
thick oats or barley was quite an ordinary task. It was said of one
flyer on the Hunter that it was dangerous to employ him on a dry
crop, as he whizzed through it so rapidly that the heat generated
in his blade sometimes set fire to the field. The scrub farmer who
planted with a hoe was also in the habit of sailing after records.
His object was to plant more rows than any other man on the river;
but to gain the belt he would start hours before daylight and work
till long after dark. The ploughing championship was decided on the
sports ground on gala days, and carried a substantial money
prize.</p>
<p>The smartness of cattle men, apart from riding and driving, was
tested in the branding yard. To throw 200 nuggety calves in three
hours before breakfast might be considered a good morning's work;
but when the cracks got going with the object of throwing and
branding more than the velocipedes on another squattage there was
seldom enough calves yarded to fill in the time. And the branding
was merely a preliminary to the day's work. From breakfast time
till late in the afternoon they were mustering more cattle on the
run, and the remainder of the day was put in with strenuous
drafting in the yards. As nearly every second horse that was
mounted gave the rider a bit of lively exercise to begin
with&mdash;by way of shaking his breakfast down&mdash;and he did
six or seven hours hard riding in the brush before starting the
yard work, his records could not be said to be put up under the
most favourable conditions.</p>
<p>There were champion cane cutters, cane strippers, kangaroo
shooters, rabbit trappers, buffalo hunters, drovers, pearl divers,
and even bullock drivers. Every calling, however humble, had its
leading lights, and you were never long among any group before you
knew their whereabouts, who and what they were, and all about them,
for no men talked &quot;shop&quot; more than these enthusiasts. And
it was worth while being a leader too, if it was only at breaking
stones, for such a one could get a job anywhere, and he got better
wages than his fellows.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
Tall Fishing on the Murray.</h2>
<p>Murray Bridge, 60 miles from Adelaide, brought everybody to the
windows, and the sight of Australia's boss river, which we cross
but a few miles above where it empties into Lake Alexandrina, awoke
some enthusiasm in the overseer. He had to connect some personal
experience with that river or burst something. He posed as a
travelled man.</p>
<p>&quot;Great river for fish,&quot; he remarked, after a little
reflection. &quot;Many a glorious hour I've spent on its banks. We
used to have fishing competitions along between Gol Gol and
Morquong. I was on a station thereabouts at the time, and belonged
to the Gol Gol Cod Club. There were 20 members, and each one had a
boy to look after his fire and keep his brands hot&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His w-what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brands. Every member had an iron brand. You see, we caught
so many fish that it was impossible to use a fraction percentage of
'em; so each member used to put his brand on the big ones he
caught, and return them to the water. If any of them were caught
again they didn't count, as the man whose brand was on it claimed
it. All told, my Murray River stock must number about 9000, I
should say. You'll know if ever you catch any o' them&mdash;G7 on
the near rump.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; 'Tis a great pity you didn't have yards an' paddocks to
put 'em in, as I see they do along be the rivers with
oysters,&quot; said Brogan, a big Irishman, we had picked up at
Balhannah. &quot;Then you could have rounded them up and sold off
the fat ones when you had buyers. An' you'd have had all the
progeny, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We thought of that,&quot; the overseer declared, &quot;but
it wasn't practicable. It takes a lot to keep a Murray cod, though
it eats pretty near anything. It will make a breakfast off old
boots quite cheerfully, if nothing else is available, and it can
sleep well after a late supper of shark-bones and kerosene tins.
I'll tell you a strange thing. I was crossing the Murray one time
with cattle for Wodonga, when I lost a gold chronometer. Two days
later, after delivering the cattle, I was fishing a couple of miles
below the spot, and succeeded in hooking a 2cwt. cod. Pulled it out
by tying the line to my horse's tail, and flogging him up the bank.
Inside it was a 1cwt. cod, and inside it again was one of 50lb. in
weight. That one contained a 20-pounder, and out of it I got one of
10lb. The latter had a fair-sized perch, and a tin of sardines on
board, and out of the perch I cut another of the same species.
Terrible cannibals, fish are. When I opened the last one, I'm blest
if there wasn't my watch&mdash;still ticking!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah-h!&quot; said Progan. &quot;You caught him just in the
nick of time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he had dilly-dallied a bit longer, now, it's ten to one
the watch would a got into them sardines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the sardines were in a tin,&quot; Mr. Muggs reminded
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, aye,&quot; said Brogan; &quot;but what's a bit of a
tin to a watch like that! 'Twould a got in all right, an'
'twouldn't a lost a kick of its tickin', either. It would have
ticked more so with the good oil about it.&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer maintained an unruffled dignified aspect. He was
watching out for Tailem Bend, where we skimmed the Murray bank
again. &quot; 'Tis a great wonder to me,&quot; Brogan went on,
&quot;when them fish fit into one another so convenient, that
there's any but the old governor-general left alive. But I suppose
the tickin' of the gold watches they pick up keeps their minds off
their relations, an' that gives the poor devils a chance to
grow.&quot;</p>
<p>Here the overseer turned a disapproving eye on him.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you've had much to do with watches&mdash;or
with fish either,&quot; he remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, now, you ask me a question,&quot; said Bogan
reflectively, &quot;an' I'll tell you, square an' all. I've got a
watch of me own that I bought when Micky 'ere was on the
bottle.&quot;</p>
<p>Micky was a lanky, bashful youth, sitting beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;That's many a year ago, as you can see by the boy, an'
it's going yet. 'Tis a nickel-plated chronometer. I paid three an'
six for it, I did. I left it home so 's the old woman would know
when to go to bed an' when to get up again. She do be lonely an'
lost without the ticker. An' I've got lines, too, as good as there
is in Balhannah. Mind that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ever catch anything with them?&quot; the overseer asked
with sarcasm.</p>
<p>&quot;I do then. I catch ducks with them; I catch 'possums with
them; I catch hawks with them; an' when I've a mind I catch fish
with them. I remember one day I went fishing in the Severn&mdash;up
be Texas, d'yer mind. I was after cod, but 'twas meself I caught.
That's true as you're sittin' there. I was doing a bit of a camp by
the lagoon at the time, an' a fellow who didn't seem to have
anything to do but dispense information to travellers tells me
there's plenty o' cod to be had in the stream just contiguous.
'Good luck to it,' says I. 'It's myself will have one.' &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, the first thing I wants is bait. So I pokes
about in the grass, shufflin' me feet so; an' what do I find but a
whopper of a frog. Says I, 'You're the identical creature I'm
after;' an' with that I overtakes him; and I sticks the hook
through his bottom lip. Then I whizzed an' whizzed an' whizzed him
round to give him a good hoist, an' jerked him well out into the
river, kickin' like the very devil. He had the power in the leg, he
had. You mind it. Micky?&quot;</p>
<p>Micky merely looked abashed on being appealed to.</p>
<p>&quot;I sat down then on the bag I had, and lights the dudeen.
'Tis a fine smoke you can have when the fish ain't biting. I smoked
and I waited, and I waited and I smoked, for I don't know how long;
and the devil a bite did I get at all. Several times the line
tugged, like something nibbling, you understand, and every time I
pulled up hand over me fist, and it was only the frog' was biting.
'The cod take you,' I says, and I hoists him out again.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I lays on me back, and drops off to sleep
unintentional. 'Tis easy to doze off when you're fishin'. But I was
roused mighty sudden by-and-bye, I can tell you. I had the line
tied to me left leg, and the same was bein' tugged fit to dislocate
it. 'Sure, there must be a fish on the frog end of it,' says I; and
with that I starts pullin' in as smart as make haste.</p>
<p>&quot;Then me other leg starts rearin' up in the atmosphere. At
that I stops and takes a general squint about the premises. Then I
sees two varmints of boys laughin' fit to bust up on top of the
bank. You mind it well, Micky? And there was me line hangin' over
the limb of a tree. The frog had swum ashore, you see, and nothing
less must do him but he must get up the tree; and he walks along
the first limb on his belly and falls off the wrong side, so he has
the line hanging over the limb. You under stand? 'Twas then the two
squint-essences of mischief gets hold of the line and sticks the
hook through the bottom of me pants&mdash;of the right leg, mind
you. And what do they do next but pull on the frog end and have it
so that I'd think the fish was bitin'. I thought so sure; and that
was the way I caught myself.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br>
The Overseer Tries to Have Forty Winks&mdash;No Respect for
Luggage&mdash;Rural Charm&mdash;The Tent-Dwellers of Ballarat.</h2>
<p>He knocked the ashes from his pipe, and made some lightning
changes in his toilet, substituting a woollen cap for his
hardhitter, and rolling three yards of comforter round his neck.
Then he yawned cavernously, and lolled back as far as the limited
space would allow, using Micky for a pillow. The overseer likewise
went into evening dress. He did more. He spread his rug along the
aisle, got down on it with apologies, covered himself with his
overcoat, said &quot;good-night,&quot; and went to sleep. Being
used to droving, he could sleep anywhere. He was a nuisance at
first, but once he was fairly off he came handy to put our feet on.
He was warmer and softer than the floor; and whenever he started to
snore we had only to put some pressure on sharply to regulate him.
Still we envied him. It was a long night. We got too tired to talk;
we dozed and woke and nodded and swayed, being mostly jerked in to
the perpendicular and wakefulness by somebody's elbow. We began to
resent the overseer's monopoly of the bed; we felt that we could
get along much better if he was up and there was no bed at our
feet. It was like being at a wake with the corpse not dead yet, and
no whisky on tap.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, Mr. Muggs laid violent hands on him, and
bellowed in his ear:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, mate! Wake up!&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer sprang into a sitting position, and looked at us
with rounded eyes like a startled bullock.</p>
<p>&quot;You're missing all the sites. This is Coonalbyn,&quot; Mr.
Muggs informed him.</p>
<p>&quot;Precious lot that is to wake a man up for!&quot; the
overseer grumbled, and muffled up again in a determined manner.</p>
<p>That was grand. It banished sleep from our eyes, and made us
cheerful.</p>
<p>He was well asleep when Brogan touched him. &quot;Hi! Now,
then!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're at Tintinara now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On, go to the devil!&quot;</p>
<p>Beautiful! We were all smiles again.</p>
<p>After a while Brogan nudged me with his elbow. I took him
gently. I drew the coat back from his head, and inquired softly if
he was asleep.</p>
<p>&quot;Slee-eep!&quot; he snorted, glowering at me.</p>
<p>&quot;We've just passed the bore. Thought you might like
to&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Passed one,&quot; mumbled the overseer. &quot;I thought
all the infernal bores were on this train.&quot;</p>
<p>Excellent! Half the company were acting as if they were trying
to ward off a fit.</p>
<p>By-and-bye Mr. Muggs charged down on him with both feet.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Wirrega; we'll be at Border Town
directly&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;D&mdash;&mdash; pity you weren't buried there!&quot;
grunted the overseer, covering his head up with vengeful tugs.</p>
<p>But peace was denied him, for Brogan pounced on him again
shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;Up with you! We're crossin' the border now,&quot; he
shouted. &quot;Bet you a bob yer chronometer's wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, let's have five minutes' sleep, can't you? God bless
my soul&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>He shut off, and buried his head once more.</p>
<p>Then we drew up at Serviceton, 196 miles from Adelaide, and as
soon as the door was opened a bare-legged urchin, with a bundle of
papers tucked under his arm, thrust his head in and bellowed at
him: &quot;Ere y' are! Latest edition! All about the
duke!&quot;</p>
<p>The audible smile this evoked from his companions only annoyed
him slightly; but when the girls on the platform saw him getting
out of bed, the resultant shrieks made him blush, and he hurried
out to efface himself in the crowd. Having refreshed, he looked at
his chronometer, glanced up at the clock, paused in surprise, held
the ticker to his ear, and looked again. It was wrong. Thence
onward he was interested in clocks. He compared notes whenever he
saw one, but they all showed the same discrepancy. Still doubtful,
he asked a man at Horsham who carried a watch what the time was,
and it was then explained to him that Victorian time was 30 minutes
in advance of South Australian time.</p>
<p>We changed trains at Serviceton, and while waiting we learn why
passengers' luggage got more knocked about on trains than on any
other conveyance under the sun. Porters rushed in, grabbed anything
handy, tore it out, and banged it into the next van. They always
tore at the bottom things, and pretty soon the top lot, toppling
over, hit the floor with a resounding crash. My trunk started
brand-new from Broken Hill. It reached Melbourne with the clasp and
one hinge broken, while the bottom was the only part of it where
there was room for another dint.</p>
<p>We had breakfast at Horsham and lunch at Ballarat. The places
were 130 miles apart by rail, and when a person puts that space
between his meals he doesn't digest much of what he sees, however
well he might digest what he eats.</p>
<p>The traveller was frequently tempted to break his journey
through this part of Victoria. Besides the numerous diggings, with
their early-time associations, their cradle-echo of the roaring
days, there were many fine lakes, as Lake Manna, near Horsham, and
Lake Windermere, or Windouree. To people from the dry interior, who
were wont to admire the broad, rippling bosom of an excavated tank,
the sight of those sea-like expanses was exhilarating. These lakes
were respectable; they were reliable; they didn't shame the old
inhabitants by drying up in summer, and exasperate them by flooding
them out in winter.</p>
<p>To the nature lover one of the most alluring parts of the bush
is the large, ready swamp, set like an emerald basin in the midst
of a deep forest, and backed by low, girdling hills. There is
invariably a broad pool of clear water, partly screened by a bed of
buoyant rushes, and surrounded by a wide expanse that is studded
with green reeds, soft, trailing grasses, and beautiful flowering
lilies. With here and there a clump of sweet-blossoming tee-tree,
where myriads of bees keep up an incessant hum; with the
gaudy-winged dragon flies hovering over the scented broom and the
tasselling rushes; with its teeming bird life, its wild voices of
day and night; its morning fragrance, and its mysterious evening
whispers&mdash;it has a charm that grows on those who dwell near
it, and that calls, ever calls, to them through all the after
years.</p>
<p>Ballarat, one of the oldest and most historic goldfields in
Australia, still rewarded the patient diggers with rich lumps of
gold from time to time. Though it had grown into a big town&mdash;a
pretty one, with numerous statues in memory of the heroes who fell
on the little battleground of Eureka: the heroes who struck the
first blow for freedom on Australian soil&mdash;there had always
been a canvas township attached to it right down from the exciting
days of the golden era. For over 50 years the diggers' tents had
gleamed whitely along hill and valley; and though men had searched
and dug through all that time, there were still good prizes for the
patient and persevering.</p>
<p>Among the inhabitants of Canvas Town were many old men who made
fortunes in the long-ago rushes and lost them; who had wandered
from field to field, from State to State, and drifted back finally
to the old ground. A big section of diggers pottered about old
fields in preference to prospecting for new finds. In the case of
some, they knew the ground was too hurriedly worked of yore for
every ounce of gold to be taken from it; and the low weight of the
dish that paid the fossicker now was considered too poor to be
worth bothering about then. Thousands had gone over old grounds for
that reason in the intervening years; but still the digger ever
thought that there must be some gold remaining yet; he couldn't
believe that all the place contained had been discovered as though
the searchers had been directed by a magnet. There must be some
slugs left yet, some rich pockets remaining. That was what the
digger said to-day; his successors a hundred years hence will be
saying the same.</p>
<p>They managed to keep themselves from year to year, some of them
by working the old tailings; and when they occasionally struck a
pocket or a small nugget they were rich. Abandoned shafts had also
a strong attraction for these fossickers. They picked around the
sides, and sank a foot or two deeper; and many a fortune has been
made with no more labour than that.</p>
<p>The tent-dwellers who clustered near Ballarat&mdash;and also at
Ararat&mdash;were not those who were here to-day and gone
to-morrow; they were always there. Some of them had names on their
tents, as other people had on their houses; and all were known to
the grocer, to the baker, the butcher, and other tradesmen, whose
carts called regularly, and had marked out for them their roads and
streets. Even the woodman called at lots of the tents, though tall
eucalypts were still plentiful where the majority were pitched. The
occupants were mostly men who had no family cares. The train ran
partly through their field of operations, miles upon miles of
little earth heaps showing on either side.</p>
<p>This canvas village in an old and populous centre was novel to
most; but it was not unique in Australia. Other goldfield towns had
their canvas suburbs&mdash;the canvas having clung perpetually from
the long-ago days of the rush. And when one of the veteran diggers
who inhabited them struck it rich the chances were he would
establish himself more permanently and comfortably on the same
spot; he would buy a new tent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br>
In Canvas Houses.</h2>
<p>Properly the canvas house belonged to the dry, inland regions.
In the coastal belt there was seldom any necessity for it, for
timber and bark were plentiful in almost any locality where one's
avocation required him to make a temporary residence. The more
humid atmosphere, the colder climate, and long spells of wet
weather, made the light dwelling of the interior plains
unsuitable.</p>
<p>A man could be comfortable anywhere in a tent; but for a family
it was inconvenient and cheerless, however big it was. Many
families managed in tents in places where their stay was only for a
brief period. For all that they had to make a place of bark or iron
for cooking in. Even then the conditions were unpleasant for a
woman with children. In wet weather she was half her time plodding
through mud, and everything in the cramped domicile was damp.</p>
<p>In those timbered regions the common material of the temporary
habitation was bark. It did not take long to strip enough sheets
for a commodious hut, and its erection was merely a matter of a few
days. This hut was all bark. The more permanent
structures&mdash;the &quot;Old Bark Hut&quot; of our early
history&mdash;had slab walls. Out west iron was used; but it was
hot, and altogether unsuitable to people whose abiding places were
never permanent. There was no bark there that could be used for
this purpose. Over vast areas of the interior there was no timber.
Carting material for a fresh residence whenever one shifted, or
removing the old residence to a new site, was a laborious and
expensive proceeding&mdash;something light, and portable, with the
roominess of an ordinary dwelling, was required. At first the
largest sized tent was adapted to suit this purpose. It was erected
on a high ridge pole, and the walls were lengthened with canvas or
common bagging. This was comfortable enough for a married couple;
but still it was only one small room, and when they had three or
four children its limitations were impressed on everybody at every
turn. It was common on far-back mining fields that did not peter
out in a month or two, and from it the canvas house was
evolved.</p>
<p>This house was deliciously cool in the hot summers of the
western plains of N.S.W.; the winters were too short to be taken
into account. It was neat and clean, roomy and snug; and in that
latitude it was one of the very healthiest kinds of habitations one
could live in. It was not a place where you had to mind the paint
and the polish and be careful of muddy boots on the floor. The
floor took care of itself. Neither had you to tiptoe about when the
baby was asleep. Everything was simplified&mdash;and it was a
refreshing simplicity. The house and all its contents, together
with much outside paraphernalia, could be packed into one heavy
dray. Yet a man and his wife, and half-a-dozen children might live
in it, and enjoy every comfort and convenience of a bush home.</p>
<p>The canvas house was much in favour by wandering bush workers
and contractors. A few light pieces of pine wood, well fitted and
bolted together, served for the frame, which could be put up while
the dinner was cooking. The rest, including doors and windows, was
canvas or hessian. The house was generally long and narrow, divided
into three rooms. The living room was in the centre; the fireplace
was outside, well away from the inflammable material with which the
place was constructed. This dwelling imposed the minimum of
housekeeping work on the women. There were no windows to clean, no
floors to scrub&mdash;nothing to spoil. I have seen such a place,
standing alone in a wide dry paddock, with &quot;water laid
on.&quot; This was accomplished by means of a three feet length of
pipe, with a tap on the end of it, being screwed into an iron tank
standing on a dray outside the back wall. The furniture was mostly
in keeping with the building&mdash;folding canvas chairs and beds,
boxes that made chests of drawers when stacked in the bedroom, and
benches that stood on trestles.</p>
<p>The canvas building with its appropriate fittings, or with
ordinary furniture, formed the first home of many a new selector
and his family. The cheap material lasted a long while, and when
repairs or complete renovation was necessary, it was easily
effected. The householder did not need to call in a carpenter,
paper-hanger, painter or plumber; he could do it all himself, and
complete the job in a day. It was an economical residence all
round, was the canvas house.</p>
<p>Bore contractors and tanksinkers lived in canvas houses, for
both must reside alongside their work, which was usually in some
lonely open space. Both were employers of labour. The boss and
family lived in the house which contained a dining-room big enough
to accommodate all hands, the men. in bough-screened tents
scattered around it. Putting down an artesian bore was a long
contract. The boring machinery worked all through the night, as
well as all day. It was always a busy scene; always was the throb
of life in it like the unceasing thump-thump of the Broken Hill
mines. One that was put down at the Warri Warri, near the
Queensland border, took over two years. The contractor's house had
a wide skillion, which was chiefly occupied by the cook. His
bedroom was at one end, a wide fireplace at the other, and in
between was a long plank table. The furniture of the residence
included a piano, pictures, bookcase and books, and other
furnishings of an ordinary well-to-do home. There was also a
verandah in front, a mere awning of canvas, under which the canvas
chairs, set on the bare ground, were inviting in the afternoon to a
hot traveller. Here the men sprawled and smoked after their midday
meal; here, too, the family spread their beds, and slept on hot
nights.</p>
<p>The tanksinker's contract lasted from three to six months,
according to the size of the tank, and the hardness of the ground.
His house was built by the side of the excavation, water for
domestic purposes having to be carted to it in iron tanks. It was
partly surrounded with a bush or canegrass break. There were horse
yards, cart and harness sheds, sheep pens, a forge and work shop,
the whole suggesting a selector's homestead, especially when one
saw children playing merrily about it, and heard the familiar
cackle of laying hens. But when the tank was finished the house and
all the busy life that was about it suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>An advantage of the canvas house was that it could be erected
anywhere like a tent, and however much you shifted about you were
always in the same old familiar home. You only changed your
neighbourhood and scenery. For the new selector or farmer who
wasn't overburdened with capital, and wanted to get to work at once
on his land, it was the cheapest and most convenient form of
residence. He could take his wife and children with him, when he
went on to his block; and they would be comfortably domiciled and
settled down to their housekeeping within 24 hours. It was the
lightning process of home-making.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
In the Smoker.</h2>
<p>The whole stretch of country traversed from the Murray River to
Ballarat was pleasing to the eye. Victoria has innumerable beauty
spots, with no repelling background like N.S.W., South Australia,
and West Australia. Nearly every inch of her territory, like that
of Queensland (excepting where the beastly imported prickly pear
had formed choking wildernesses), was inviting to the settler.</p>
<p>But we had a grievance now. Our accommodation had deteriorated,
whereas, considering the tedium of a long journey, it should have
improved with successive trains. The cars were full enough before;
now they almost bulged at the sides. Some of the passengers were
full, too. A comatose bulk or a half-drunken wight, lolling and
bumping against you on one side; a portly, straight-laced old dame,
surrounded with parcels and baskets, on the other, and two or three
youngsters sleeping among a bundle of shawls and pillows and
feeding bottles on the floor, was a proposition that could only be
taken seriously. I have been tightly sandwiched at times among nice
girls, and didn't find it uncomfortable a bit. A vagrant tress,
playing teasingly across one's face, and twining amorously around
one's neck, in such circumstances imparted only delectable thrills.
This company was too mixed and too old and too fat to make
sandwiches with, while its hair only irritated. Neither could you
enjoy a pipe there, for the portly old dame objected to smoking;
and, though it was a smoking carriage, you were expected to
consider the license suspended while she was present.</p>
<p>A wrinkle-faced man with a sour expression wanted to know why
women who didn't smoke frequented the smoking compartments of
trains and trams. He knew plenty of women who indulged in
private&mdash;and made grimaces at tobacco smoke in public; but all
manner of women seemed to seek the company of smokers, without
wanting the smoke. What did they want? Was it merely woman's
perversity?</p>
<p>There were women whose lips were never polluted with nicotine,
yet who confessed to a liking for tobacco and cigar smoke; and
there were many, on the other hand, who looked daggers at a man who
dared to blow a whiff in their vicinity, who made audible remarks
that put the offender's pipe out with the chill atmosphere
engendered around him. These invaded the weed-lover's compartment:
in greater numbers than the others. When their own compartment was
full there was a justifiable excuse for the intrusion; but how
often did we find them wedged among the men when there was plenty
of room on the seats specifically reserved for them. Some rude
people applied the opprobrious term &quot;cats&quot; to women,
because, like the feline race, they seldom agreed together. Did
these latter then prefer the smoke atmosphere because of animosity
to their own sex?</p>
<p>One female complainant said that &quot;women appreciate the
feeling which prompts a man to rise and offer his seat.&quot; This
prompts half a dozen queries, while directing investigation in
quite a different channel. It was the feminine nature to crave
admiration, sympathy, praise, attention and so forth; but when one
went out of her way to force such little courtesies as surrendering
a seat from the male person, he might be excused for the assumption
that she was a poor, neglected being, whose life was empty of all
that panders to woman's vanity, and adds to woman's pleasure, whose
heart was lonely, and whose soul was hungry. But why rebel against
tobacco in tobacco's realm?</p>
<p>One might reasonably expect that a young lady&mdash;or an old
one, for that matter&mdash;who was looking for courtesies would be
magnanimous enough to condone a little adulteration. Still, it
being a discourtesy on a man's part not to remove his pipe in her
august presence, she might reasonably consider that the one
counteracted the other, while woman's beautiful inconsistency did
not permit of an argument about proper places.</p>
<p>Then, again, man was a much shyer animal now than formerly, and
hard to hook, with the most alluring baits; and maybe in place of
being chased by him she had taken to chasing him. It was much
easier to corner him in trains and trams than to overtake him in
the open; and as the brute was a necessary adjunct he had to be
accepted with his pernicious habits; at least, he must be courted
in the malodorous atmosphere with which he surrounded himself, and
any amelioration that could be accomplished in respect to that was,
in her opinion, to be commended.</p>
<p>But this theory, too, must go overboard, The intruders were not
all young maids; the majority were married women&mdash;mothers and
grandmothers. This reduces one to the Chinaman's comprehensive
protest, &quot;Whaffor?&quot; One thing was indisputable; they
caused no end of annoyance by encroaching on man's preserves and
objecting to what he did there. Men wouldn't mind the presence of
women; they rather like their society; but when her ladyship says,
tacitly or otherwise, that a man mustn't smoke in a compartment
specially provided for him to smoke in when she chose to plant
herself there instead of in her own quarter, she became an
objectionable quantity that called for suppression. It was an
occasion when the lord of creation might be pardoned for getting up
in a hurry and slamming the door.</p>
<p>In a general way, women were indiscriminate and inconsiderate.
In the rush and confusion at the platform they plunged in wherever
they saw a vacant seat, irrespective of what the carriage might be.
Often a man entered a smoking carriage to enjoy the luxury of a
pipe or two on the way, and his wife or daughters or other female
attaches, rather than be separated, elected to share the
compartment with him; and this they did to the inconvenience of
other male passengers. Their presence also attracted other women,
and it was no uncommon thing to find the smoker almost entirely
filled with women. Under such circumstances the man who entered it
in the first place to smoke had to forego the pleasure or suffer
the withering looks and inuendoes of the petticoated fraternity
around him.</p>
<p>On one occasion a soldier, who had been imbibing rather freely,
entered our compartment, and, taking the pipe from his mouth,
said:</p>
<p>&quot;Any of you ladies object to smoking&quot;</p>
<p>The ladies glared at him, but no one answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause if you do,&quot; he continued, &quot;there's
carriages reserved specially for non-smokers. This is mine.&quot;
And down he sat, and puffed huge, curling clouds to the
ceiling.</p>
<p>At Nhill, the little town that the big cyclone played skittles
with years ago, we had lost all our ladies but an 18st. dame from
Border Town, who looked immaculate in a sheeny black silk dress,
bedecked with shimmering black beads, and in a quaint little toque
skewered to the bundled thatch at the back of her cranium. A
roughly dressed, bluff old farmer, who had been ousted from
somewhere else by the aforesaid ladies, got in &quot;for a bit of a
run to Ballarat,&quot; and edged towards the little vacant space
beside her. He took out his pipe, but before he lit it he turned to
the old lady in silk.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you smoke, ma'am?&quot; he asked politely. The old lady
started, and peered at him from under knitted brows.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not!&quot; she snapped.</p>
<p>&quot;You're in the smoker, ma'am,&quot; continued the
irrepressible farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;That needn't stop you from smoking,&quot; she returned.
&quot;Though I don't smoke myself,&quot; she added more graciously,
&quot;I have no objection to tobacco smoke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, old woman,&quot; said the farmer, and a grin
ploughed round to his ears, as he winked at us.</p>
<p>Then we all drew out our pipes and lit up, and therewith the
scenery on each side of us improved wonderfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br>
A Good Hand at Cards&mdash;Melbourne&mdash;Seeing the Duke.</h2>
<p>The overseer had purchased a pack of cards at Ballarat to
relieve the tedium of travel. Just before the train started again
we were joined by a well-conditioned clergyman. The overseer, who
had been directing our attention to the joker, dropped some cards
in his hurry to conceal them. The clergyman smiled. The overseer
blushed, and when he had awkwardly gathered up the cards he put
them in his pocket. Then said the new-comer: &quot;Don't let me
interrupt you, gentlemen. I rather like a game of cards
myself.&quot; in two shakes whist was elected, and the cards dealt
out.</p>
<p>The clergyman whispered, with a roguish twinkle in his eye:
&quot;I'm only a novice, but I'm a good loser. We'll make it a
shilling a head if you like, just to give a little zest to the
game.&quot;</p>
<p>We liked nothing better. We played while the train roared along;
we played on our best behaviour, feeling the fascination of the
gambler and the influence of the Church. The clergyman won.</p>
<p>We were pleased at his success. We had secretly engineered the
game to that end. Now we played our best, each one endeavouring to
scoop the pool for himself. We considered one victory an hour would
be sufficient tonic for the good shepherd. It was more exciting
than the first game, but less satisfactory. The clergyman won.</p>
<p>We were a little chagrined on starting again. We were also less
honest, and tried to work points on the good man by telegraphing to
one another. But we were a scratch team, and didn't understand one
another's cheat code. Play became still more absorbing. The scenery
was forgotten. Even conversation dropped in our desperate efforts.
Every mind was keenly concentrated on the business in hand, till
the final card was played. The clergyman won.</p>
<p>I never did see a novice play so well against old hands. His
luck was wonderful. When he at last departed hence with his bag and
brolly in his hands, a jovial smile on his face, and a valedictory
&quot;God bless you,&quot; we were the most flabbergasted crowd in
the train. We had played ten games by that time. The clergyman had
won them all!</p>
<p>From Stawell into Melbourne the view was replete with scenic
beauty, and you passed many historic spots that would never be
erased from the memory of Australians. The gold towns were fairly
big places, and pretty enough to attract a painter's eye. One of
the loveliest spots was Bacchus Marsh, viewed at sunset as you
traversed its long girdling hills.</p>
<p>It was late when we reached Melbourne. It was raining, too, and
bitterly cold at that. Cramped, worn out and sleepy, we were glad
to take the first accommodation that was offered. This was an
alleged boarding-house kept by two persons named McGregor. We met
McGregor pere at the station, acting as &quot;runner&quot; for
himself. He had fiery-red whiskers, worn monkey fashion, and there
was a country air about him that appealed to us. It transpired that
he had made money with pigs, and had lately embarked in business in
town. He said we were lucky to drop on to his establishment, as he
believed it was the only one that had a vacancy left in Melbourne
just then. Before we had been there many hours we understood why it
had vacancies. Melbourne was overcrowded with visitors at the time,
and it was the worst kind of recommendation for any place to have
vacancies begging to be filled. Besides the visit of the Duke, it
was the season of the Eight Hour festival, and the whole city was
beflagged and ablaze&mdash;at night time&mdash;with coloured
lights. We had arrived at a time to see Melbourne at its best, but
the multitude that arrived contemporaneously made it the worst time
to see anything. Still, we saw the Zoo and the Museum before the
rush set in for the sights.</p>
<p>We stayed three days at McGregor's, then restored the vacancy,
having in the meantime discovered a furnished room to let in a
quiet street near the railway station. The menu for breakfast at
McGregor's (the only meal we partook of on the premises) never
altered&mdash;fried steak and onions, cold and greasy. Our host
carved the bread against his shirt with a butcher's knife. Slices
half-loaf size and an inch thick. He also waited at table. He had
the old bog habit of stealing round on tiptoe, and breathing
confidentially in one's ear, when he thought anything was wanted.
Whatever he had been among pigs, he was a misfit in a boarding
house. The duke wasn't staying there.</p>
<p>The price of meals had risen 150 per cent, since the city had
been exalted by the presence of a real live member of the nobility.
We breathed his name with great fervour each time we parted up. All
the restaurants were crowded to the doors. Our plan was to note who
was eating pudding&mdash;the last course&mdash;and mortgage his
chair by standing over it till he was finished, and then fight for
it if necessary. Once a Bendigo soldier (you couldn't look twice in
two places without seeing three soldiers these regal days) had
mortgaged the next chair to mine, and caused much indignation to a
fat old gentleman by the simple remark: &quot;I'd rather keep this
fellow a week than a fortnight; he must have lost his appetite and
found a horse's.&quot; The old party rose with his mouth full of
hot jam roll, and told us that he was opposed to jingoism since,
soldiers stood over civilians in cafes and placed restrictions on
their appetites. After which he had some more jam roll.</p>
<p>On Melbourne's gala day we mingled with the dense crowd that
lined the muddy street. It was a damp day, and a long wait didn't
help to make it brighter. The crowd grew weary and impatient, but
still it stood there, craning its hydra-neck forward and upward.
Then a sanitary cart came crawling along the living avenue.
Somebody shouted, &quot;Here it comes!&quot; and a few of the more
boisterous cheered. It was the signal for an ovation. Both lines
took it up, and clapped and hoorayed with enthusiasm. The
astonished driver, who had been indulging in a quiet smoke, sprang
up quickly, and looked back towards Prince Bridge. Nothing was
coming that way. He looked towards the Exhibition Buildings, and
nothing appeared in that direction either. The crowd cheered
encouragingly. He was puzzled. He directed his gaze at the
balconies and roofs, scanned his vehicle, and finally glanced along
the rows of smiling faces. All eyes were fixed on
him&mdash;thousands of them. He dropped into his seat, limp,
blushful, and cowed; and, gathering the reins up, he struck the
tired horse sharply with the ends. Thunderous applause! If he only
shook the reins they applauded it; if he said &quot;Get up!&quot;
they encored him vociferously. His pipe had gone out; in fact, he
had sneaked it away into his pouch; and, glancing left and right,
he answers the applauding multitude with sickly grins. So much
popularity unnerved him; he had never dreamed he was so popular in
Melbourne. It was a lengthy avenue of people, and all along it they
hailed him with clamorous voices, with hand-clapping, with waving
hats and agitated handkerchiefs. They overwhelmed him with
applause. He shrank up visibly. I believe, if the cart had not been
full, he would have crawled under the covering and hid there till
he was out of sight.</p>
<p>When the cheering had ceased, Mr. Muggs touched the overseer on
the arm, and asked:</p>
<p>&quot;Was that him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who&mdash;what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The duke?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Duke&mdash;be&mdash;hanged!&quot; with pitying scorn.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot; said Mr. Muggs, pretending not to hear. &quot;Is
that the procession?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pro&mdash;God bless my soul&mdash;Why&mdash;?&quot; Words
failed him; he turned away with a sniff, craning to see &quot;if it
was coming.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, we saw the grand pageant, and the fireworks, and all
the rest of it later; but that municipal cart was better than
anything in the whole show.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
Hawkers.</h2>
<p>Every big town has its complement of hawkers. Melbourne had a
plague of them, their raucous voices compelling notice day and
night. To lovers of quiet and peace they were a nuisance;
especially in those hours when there was a hush over all mundane
things. The rattle of carts and the clutter of driven quadrupeds,
combined with the musical tones of grumptious bipeds, struck one as
an outrage on nature when they were raised under the soft light of
peaceful stars. An old maxim impresses upon all sluggards that the
early bird catches the worm; but it omits to add that birds have
the grace to wait for daylight, and the worm which is thus caught
owes its downfall to dilatory habits.</p>
<p>Another old-time adage instructs us that &quot;early to bed and
early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.&quot; If all
humanity acted upon that there would at least be a reasonable span
of calm occurring regularly in every 24 hours. But the busy man
goes to bed late and gets up early. In any case, the old adage is a
fool. I tried it when I couldn't help it, and can speak from
personal experience. In the bush we got up early to start on a
journey. To begin with, horse hunting in the dark occupied ten
times longer than would have sufficed in daylight, to say nothing
of stubbing one's toes, falling over logs, stumbling into ruts and
gullies, and damaging one's eyes against twigs and branches. You
run the same risk in riding, besides the risk of losing the road,
and every now and again you are smothered in the great yellow,
viscous net of the forest spider. Once I fell in the river through
getting up early, and I have suffered numerous inconveniences,
besides losing much valuable time fiddling around, through being
too previous. Certainly the habit made me wiser; it taught me the
wisdom of staying in bed till the sun got up; but I am quite
positive it never made me wealthy.</p>
<p>The most noticeable early risers in town are milkmen, bakers,
and newsvendors. They beat the daylight-saving cocky farmer every
day in the week. We all like our papers early, but we don't like
their arrival announced with a yell that wakes the baby, and a
clamorous tattoo on the door. Some distributors make a tight roll
of the paper, so as to shy it across the front garden, and it bangs
against a reposeful residence like a battering-ram.</p>
<p>It is also necessary for the milkman to be starlight early at
some places to complete his round before breakfast; though one
might reasonably expect him to deliver the cow product with much
less uproar. Whether jugs are waiting or not, he wakes the
neighbourhood with his welkin-splitting &quot;Milk-o-o!&quot; and
the clatter of his cans, intermingled with door-knocking and a
frequent stentorian &quot;Whey-whoa-back.&quot; I have never known
an early milkman's horse that didn't require admonitions of this
sort every five minutes. He seems to drive an unusually restive
breed of animal. It appears to be obstinate also, for the milkman
has to shout &quot;Get up&quot; loudly and often to get him going
again. The younger the milkman the more cyclonic he is with the
cans; the more anxious to let everybody know he's up, and the more
obstreperous the horse he drives.</p>
<p>As for the early baker, new bread being bad for the digestion,
there was no need to work with the owls and go roaring round like a
tornado with it before day had properly begun. These, people, too,
have horses that require a lot of talking to, and they throw the
bread at the doorstep, ring the bell with emphasis, and bang the
gate in a manner that vibrates through the suburb. Then more
&quot;whey,&quot; more &quot;whoa-back,&quot; more
&quot;gee-up,&quot; and more bang and clatter all down the
thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Between breakfast and tea a motley crowd of the peddling
fraternity waits on both ends of the premises. &quot;Scissors to
grind and umbrellas to mend&quot; is exclusively a town product.
Sometimes he has a special light vehicle carrying a grindstone,
worked with a treadle; more often he plods around on foot, with a
bundle of wrecked ginghams as the sign of his trade. The hawkers of
stale cabbages and inferior fruit parade in great variety, the
handcart and wheelbarrow forming links between the greengrocer's
horse and cart and Quong Fat's pendulous baskets.
&quot;Tripe-cow-heel,&quot; &quot;Photo to enlarge free of
charge&quot; (the frame of which subsequently costs you 21s),
&quot;Rabbit-O, clothes props, brushware, scrubbing mats, door
rolls, bottle-o, taffy for treacle tins, plants for the garden, all
growing, all blowing; hokey-pokey, penny a lump; fish-o, all
alive-o, and fresh eggs (when they were laid), and garden honey,
among other canvassers, are essentially urban identities; whilst
the insurance agent, sewing machines, pianos, books, tinware, and
pots to mend, and chairs and couches to repair, are familiar in
town and country. Some accept your refusal to buy in a polite
manner; others drop curses at your front gate as they go
out&mdash;and they invite curses on their own heads by leaving the
gate open.</p>
<p>In the greengrocery line there are many specialties and grades.
There is the man who tramps round with a basket of salad
vegetables, another with watercress, a third with rhubarb and
celery, others with tomatoes, lettuce and radish, lemons, and so
forth. When one tots up the contents value of any of these baskets,
and deducts the outlay, and takes into consideration the time lost
in waiting at each door, about one call in a dozen being
profitable, he wonders what sort of a dividend shoe-leather will
have when tucker has finished with the profits. They represent a
class whose labour the community would never miss.</p>
<p>Some of these peddling wares are some times mere cloaks, adopted
by Burlgar Bill to spy out the land, note likely cribs to crack,
ascertain the habits and position of the residents, and map out the
premises. One of the brethren called at my address one morning,
hawking a few diseased oranges. He stood on the verandah, eyeing a
pair of newly-pressed pants that were airing on a chair. I had been
reading in the bedroom with the door shut, pending the airing
process; and was now watching through the window curtains. There
being no answer to his knock, he glanced round, then snatched up
the pants, and was rolling them up smartly, when a man, who was
fully dressed for going out, except that he had no pants on, rushed
frantically to the rescue. He would have caught the thief, too,
only for the distracting disturbance the landlady made in the hall.
She had been coming on slippered feet to say lunch was ready but
instead she threw up her arms with a wild scream and fainted.</p>
<p>The swe-e-ep, with his brooms and brushes, his midnight
countenance and sooty garments, is one who fills a long-felt want
next door; wood and coal is a wandering worker of like utility; and
rags and bags, and old bedsteads and old iron are a convenience at
times; but a robust fellow hawking round a few bootlaces and
buttons seems to be a misapplication of energy; while jewellery,
new music, notepaper and postcards, pictures to frame,
matches&mdash;two a penny, and the like, invoke the householder to
shoo them off the premises with more dispatch than civility.</p>
<p>Just when night is setting in there is a great disturbance at
the back gate. The lady (all women are ladies to these itinerant
callers), going out, finds a seedy-looking individual contemplating
a melancholy moke, which is attached to a wheeled relic of ye olden
times, and lamenting his misfortunes. He has a barrowful of wood in
the cart, the tailboard is down, and some of the firing material is
spilled on the road.</p>
<p>He has a pitiful tale to tell, this man, and he tells it better
than Bland Holt. The wood was intended for a party two blocks away;
but his horse was knocked up, and he wanted to get home, so he will
sell her the lot dirt cheap.</p>
<p>&quot;It's real good dry box, lady. Look at it!&quot; He almost
shoves some of it into her arms. &quot;I'm losing on it, lady,
honour bright,&quot; he adds; while there is a pathetic, appealing
look in his eyes. &quot;If it wasn't that 'm fair done in an' the
horse is dead beat, an' won't pull it another yard, I wouldn't sell
it. As I said, I've a customer waitin' for it.&quot;</p>
<p>She hesitates for a moment; then remembers that she has been
taken in before in after-dark wood-dealing, and tells him that she
has just bought some from his brother. As the gate closes he
straightens up his outfit, takes hold of the reins, and the
knocked-up horse walks straight away. He is a by-product, this
sundown woodman, for it's sundown before he starts out, and his
object is to trade on people's sympathy.</p>
<p>&quot;He reminds me of the yarn of two scheming Back-o'-Bourke
aborigines. The pair appeared one day at a squatter's homestead,
carrying a lubra on an improvised stretcher. They were taking her
to the hospital, they said, as she was very sick. None of them had
anything to eat that day, and they would be &quot;cobbon much
obliged&quot; if Mr. and Mrs. Squatter could give them some tucker
and tobacco and a drop of brandy for Maggie; also some clothes for
her to go into the hospital in. The only sympathy they got was a
curt order to clear out. A little while afterwards Maggie was seen
to rise from the stretcher, which the bearers threw away in
disgust, and load herself with the blankets. &quot;Thought you were
sick?&quot; remarked a man as she strode off. &quot;Ugh!&quot; she
answered. &quot;No ploomin' good bein' sick when nobody gib it
anyting.&quot; So, in the same way, it was no use of the woodmans'
horse being knocked up when he couldn't sell the wood.</p>
<p>The latest disturber in the vicinity of our Melbourne lodgings
raised a loud voice about the time the average household was
retiring for the night. You heard him in the distance, too far away
to distinguish his cry; but as he drew nearer. &quot;Hot pies and
saveloy-y-ys&quot; came hurtling through your bedroom window. This
person's blatant call was with you an hour from the time you first
heard it till it died away in other streets. Sometimes he had a
bell, so as to leave you with no excuse for not hearing him; and
now and again he circulated in a cart, which seemed to crunch more
gravel to the mile than any ten carts could in daytime. He was
first cousin by a former marriage to the ice-creamer, who drifted
up and down with his foreign yell of &quot;I-scream-a-wafer,&quot;
and the blast of his abominable trumpet.</p>
<p>But there is one hawker who dispenses a little sunshine as he
goes, the one who leaves sample tins and packets of useful
commodities at one's door. Sometimes, however, he calls back in a
day or two to ascertain if you liked the goods, and if so, would
you give him an order? When he boomerangs like that he makes
himself unwelcome.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br>
An Unpleasant Attachment&mdash;Armed and Feathered Women.</h2>
<p>By the time we started on our final stage, from Melbourne to
Sydney, the overseer had become such a confirmed rusher that there
was no steadying him anywhere. He had been elbowed aside, and
knocked down so much and left behind so often in the rush for trams
and boats and buses, in the struggle for seats and the crush at
theatres, that he became desperate.</p>
<p>He was familiar with rushing cattle and scurrying sheep; but the
stampeding human animal was a new departure. It was no use saying
&quot;Whey!&quot; to him. It was equally useless to crack a whip at
him; you could only stop him with a gatling gun.</p>
<p>The overseer wasn't slow. He was a big man, with long legs, and
when he stampeded he was a holy terror in himself. He got off
scratch with celerity. If a mob intervened, and it was too solid to
plough a lane through with his shoulders, he dived under its
coat-tails. He worked through or charged through as the occasion
required.</p>
<p>During the first day or two he would stand aside for the ladies
to enter a bus or tram first; now he drove himself through and
mounted like a leaping gorilla over the wheel of the 'bus or the
step of the tram. He got so confirmed in this habit that it was
difficult to restrain him from rushing an empty cab that nobody
else wanted, He simply couldn't go anywhere without being in a
tearing hurry.</p>
<p>I encountered another velocipede at the railway station. We were
seeing our luggage on board when I was suddenly hooked up by a
young woman, and dragged away by main force. She wore a straw hat,
which just bristled with murderous pins, the sharp points
protruding all round. As she dived into the crowd one of these
ploughed into the back of my hand, and jerked it along after her. I
said, &quot;Excuse me, that's my hand you've got.&quot; But she
didn't take any notice. Didn't pause or look back, though she must
have had a glimmering of an idea that she had something hanging to
her head.</p>
<p>She was a bull-necked female, and took long strides, with her
head well forward, as though she had been used to hauling logs. I
took long strides, too, and stirred up the bile in a dozen people
in half as many seconds. Couldn't help bumping them and shoving
them rudely aside, and knocking their hats off and treading on
their toes. Had to follow my hand if I knocked the duke down. I
endeavoured to inform her that I wasn't the proper thing to wear in
a hat; that I hadn't come into fashion yet as an ornament. She
didn't hear. I shouted to her that her hat was getting damaged, but
she still reefed on.</p>
<p>A man and a woman were darting along in front of her, and I saw
now that she was frantically trying to keep them in sight.</p>
<p>I grabbed her by the lace work round her neck, and steadied her
somewhat until I tore my bleeding hand free of the dagger. Even
then she didn't look back. I think she must have come from the
solitudes of Mallee.</p>
<p>I delivered some remarks very feelingly on feminine headgear, as
I wiped the blood off and returned to my companions. &quot;Friend
of yours?&quot; asked Mr. Muggs.</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What were you running after her for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I was attached to her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! So I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer was hurrying to catch the train, which wouldn't
start for half an hour yet, and Mr. Muggs, quite satisfied with his
own solution, went after him before I could explain.</p>
<p>I set myself in a safe corner, and watched the armoured women,
and the feathered women, as they filed in to their seats. In the
street a man takes little notice of how a woman is dressed. He
might talk to her for an hour, or walk with her for half a day, and
not be able to tell five minutes later what was the colour of her
dress. A married man might be expected to take a little more notice
of such things than the bachelor, as he hears so much about
fashions and materials from his wife; but when he mentions that he
met a lady friend, or was talking to Mrs. So-and-So, and she asks
the perennial question: &quot;How was she dressed?&quot; he hasn't
the slightest idea.</p>
<p>A woman notices the entire garb at a glance. If she merely
passes another woman in the street, she will give a full
description of the fabric and style of the costume and the
decorations distributed about it, the trimmings of the hat, the
colour of the gloves, and the sort of bag she carried. Fashion
fancies form the greatest interest in the average woman's life.
Other things come and go, engaging her or delighting her for the
time being; but interest in feminine fashions goes on for ever.</p>
<p>At Flemington or Randwick, and at the Agricultural Show, it is
the chief attraction; the racing and the exhibits merely distract
attention from it for fleeting moments. In the church even it is
not forgotten.</p>
<p>In the thousand and one things that interest a man dress comes
nowhere. If it were not for the influence of women he would not
care a pin what he put on, providing it was something warm in
winter and something light and cool in summer. It is only the
exceptional garb, something very much out of the common, that he
notices. The hobble skirt at first took his eyes, and the scarem
skirt tickled his fancy immensely. For all that, in most cases he
would fail to describe the shade and material when they had passed
beyond his purview.</p>
<p>There are two items, however, in a woman's outfit that no man
fails to take particular notice of&mdash;her cartwheel hat and the
menacing daggers with which it is skewered on. He knows these
intimately because there is no escaping them. They demand his
attention, with deadly threats every day of his life, in the throng
on the pavement, at election meetings, in the theatres and on the
sports grounds; above all, in the crowded trams, trains, 'buses,
and ferry boats. In the morning and evening crushes, when everybody
is hurrying to and from business, the hatpin is always a
troublesome item, much more so when it protrudes its long point
through the top of the cartwheel hat. The latter is so outrageous
that the wearer in getting in and out of trams has to twist and
manoeuvre like a long horned cow getting into a bail; and it takes
up the room of three persons; while the pins, standing out all
round like the spines of a porcupine, keep the eyes of those
nearest nervously riveted on them.</p>
<p>When she stands in a packed passageway, swaying to the jolting
of the tram, and in diving in and out, screwing her headpiece at
various angles, they are a positive danger to everybody. Mere man
has reason to welcome the change whereby she economises with
material in the bottom part of her dress; if she wore the old
crinoline in addition to the cartwheel hat and yard-long stabbers,
she would want a tram compartment to herself.</p>
<p>The leathered woman offends with her bloodstained millinery by
the shameful practice of decorating her hat with the skins and
plumes of the loveliest and rarest birds. Over and over again the
cruelty has been pointed out; how the harmless egret is shot in her
nest, and in the act of feeding her tender babes, which are left to
die of starvation, for the sake of its fatal plume; how the
exquisite lyre bird is ruthlessly dealt with while performing its
marvellous mimicry and pleasant coquetry on its dancing ground; but
it has all failed to touch the heart of the &quot;gentle&quot; sex.
What matters the suffering, the destruction and waste, to woman, if
she can have their fine feathers to put in her hat.</p>
<p>It has been explained time and again that the birds are nature's
police, with a most important part to fulfil in maintaining the
balance of nature; and with their decrease there follows a
proportionate increase in insect life; that, if all the birds were
exterminated, the insects would eat up every living thing on the
earth in two and a half years; but still she has remained unmoved.
Her new hat, especially with a feather cocked up in it, is more
important than the fate of worlds. She has been appealed to on
behalf of posterity, for the sake of her children and her
children's children, to preserve for them their God-given heritage;
and she has only looked enviously at another woman's hat, and
decided that her own wanted new feathers. It has been clearly shown
that it is a disgrace for any woman, a discredit to her sex, to
sport the plumes of innocent birds that have been murdered for
decoration; but her vanity has survived the shock. In spite of
everything, the feathered woman refuses to be plucked of her
murderous millinery; and while wearing it she pleads, on humane
grounds, for homes for stray dogs, and seriously holds meetings and
collects money for such purpose!</p>
<p>It is in the theatre that man takes the most particular notice
of woman's headgear. He can't help it. It is part of the scenery.
It is often the whole show. Whether we are in Germany, America,
England or Australia, the theatre hat is the same old source of
annoyance; it is always with us&mdash;that is&mdash;always in front
of us&mdash;go where we may. It has been anathematised in all
languages; it has caused quarrels and undying enmity. Women's good
sense and better reasoning have been continuously appealed to all
over the universe; she has been railed at, caricatured, ridiculed,
and abused; she has been assailed with orange peel, peanut shells,
and banana skins; but she has stuck tenaciously to her hat all
through.</p>
<p>The theatre hat is not a necessity; there is no excuse for
wearing it; and every woman knows what an unmitigated nuisance it
is to those sitting behind her. The majority of our own fair sex
have a consideration for others. At theatres and picture shows they
either wear caps or remove their hats as soon as the entertainment
begins; but there is a minority who keep their hats on, and
stubbornly refuse to remove them, though repeatedly and politely
requested to do so. They take offence at any such suggestion. Their
hats are a yard wide, more or less; or they have an elevation like
a church steeple, with something resembling a poultry yard after a
cockfight, or a miniature botanic garden, as a top-storey
decoration. As specimens of headgear they are doubtless interesting
to a milliner, but even a milliner doesn't go to such places to see
hats.</p>
<p>Having paid her money to see the play, she is apt to become
exasperated when she finds herself seated directly behind a big
commonplace hat that blocks her view of the stage or the screen.
And how she hates that kind of hat ever afterwards! It gets on her
nerves, becomes an eyesore; she wouldn't be found dead in such a
contraction. If the wearer's neck is not clean, or she has big
ears, the hat exasperates all the more. When several of the massive
adornments get together, what a fine view the back row doesn't
have! Many a good temper and many a kind nature are spoilt by the
nuisance so frequently met with in places of entertainment. The
opportunity of enjoying a delightful evening is destroyed, and good
humour is turned into disappointment and vexation of spirit. A male
victim at a picture show remarked that a woman who removes her hat
unasked has usually a kindly nature; one who removes the
obstruction when requested is &quot;courteous and obliging;&quot;
one who apologises in addition is &quot;a good sort, but
thoughtless;&quot; and the one who declines to uncover, or is
offended when it is gently intimated to her that her roof is not
made of glass, is a person to be shunned. She is obviously ignorant
and ill-mannered, and if she is not one of nature's mistakes she is
a female who has been badly brought up. If she is married, her
husband is deserving of sympathy; if she is a maid&mdash;well, pity
the poor unfortunate who gets her. What a vitriolic termagant she
will be at 40!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br>
Giant Trees&mdash;A Day on a New Selection&mdash;Glenrowan and
Wodonga.</h2>
<p>Going from Melbourne to Sydney was like travelling through
another world. It was a world of giant trees, of vast wildernesses,
deep gorges and towering mountains. This was the paradise of
timber-getters and bark-strippers, and the haunt of bullock teams.
You caught glimpses of bush homes high up on the hillsides or
nestling deep down in a far-off valley, and here and there you saw
late settlers erecting a future home in the heart of the timber, or
grubbing and burning off a strip of land for cultivation. For miles
and miles there was scarcely room anywhere to pitch a tent without
shifting a few gums, messmates or supplejacks. They took some
shifting, too, and wanted a lot of room to fall, particularly in
Gippsland. The only trees in the world that could challenge these
for height and girth were the redwoods of California. School
children showed for a moment and disappeared into the forest of
trees, following various bridle tracks away to hidden homes. The
tall, wooden telegraph posts (straight as gun barrels) contrasted
markedly with the low metal posts that carried the wires across the
north-west corner of N.S.W. and through the interior of South
Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Talking of giant trees,&quot; said the over seer,
&quot;reminds me of two uncles of mine. They started one Monday
morning to chop down a big tree in Gippsland, and when they knocked
off at dinner time on Saturday&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monday,&quot; corrected Mr. Muggs.</p>
<p>&quot;Saturday,&quot; the overseer repeated. &quot;Didn't I say
they started on Monday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What were they doing all the rest of the week&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chopping. When they knocked off at dinner time they
reckoned they must be half-way through. To make sure, they took a
stroll round in the afternoon&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought they would,&quot; Mr. Muggs interrupted again.
&quot;I met a lot of the gladiators who wrestled with that stick,
and they all did that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you know so much about it, let's hear you finish the
yarn,&quot; said the overseer irascably.</p>
<p>&quot;When they got to the back,&quot; Mr. Muggs proceeded,
&quot;they met two other timber warriors who had been belting in
for a fortnight on that side of her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, they didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thought you knew all about it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't be the same sapling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't be.&quot; He folded his arms and meditated.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot; asked the overseer, looking up in surprise.
&quot;Happened! What?&quot; He had evidently forgotten all about
it.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, when your uncle's aunt's sister's grandmother sat on
the porcupine,&quot; Mr. Muggs answered impatiently.</p>
<p>&quot;Your uncles were having a walk round the vegetable to see
how much more they had to cut,&quot; another exasperated passenger
reminded him.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! Yes, I remember now. Well&mdash;lend's a match.&quot;
He took quite a minute to light his pipe, and drew slowly and
attentively at it for another minute. Everybody was watching him,
the attitude and expressions of some indicating that he was running
a risk of being chucked out of the train.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so long ago I almost forget it,&quot; he said at
last. &quot;Let's see. Uncle Mart's been dead these five and twenty
years, and Uncle Jesse&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't they cut the tree down before the funeral?&quot;
the man in front of him asked fiercely.</p>
<p>&quot;They never cut it down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was a big hollow on the other side, walled up, and a
selector and his family living in it. The woman opened the door
just as they got round, and she asked them if they had called
before that morning. 'I could have sworn,' she said, 'I heard
somebody knocking on the back wall before dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>Impressive silence.</p>
<p>&quot;One of those uncles died, you say,&quot; remarked Mr.
Muggs. &quot;The other uncle must be the old identity that's in
Fiji.&quot;</p>
<p>Some women at work in one of the many new clearings among the
densely-timbered hills recalled to mind a day on a new selection
farther north.</p>
<p>The house stood near the creek, but it was a long, steep climb
to the top of the bank. It was the family's first year on the
selection, and they had not yet got out of the roughing stage of
humping water for household use. I arrived there on washing
day&mdash;and it was the &quot;washing day,&quot; that particularly
impressed me in regard to that selection. The woman, wearing an old
felt hat and a pair of heavy boots of her husband's for the
occasion, was at work down near the water. Her tub stood on a slab
bench under a red bean tree, which was covered with beautiful
yellow flowers and huge green beans. Clothes were boiling near by
in a big boiler standing on two stones. One of the girls was
carrying wood, and looking after the fire. She helped to lift the
boiler off with a potstick, and to lift the tub when it wanted
emptying. The younger carried the soiled clothes down from the
house, and between whiles amused herself paddling and swimming in
the creek. They washed there every week instead of carrying water
to the house.</p>
<p>&quot;It saves such a drag,&quot; she explained. The clothes
when washed were carried up in a tub, and hung out on a line
stretched between two trees. At first they had spread them on the
grass, and one day the grass caught alight, and some of them were
burnt. Once she picked up a snake while taking in the dry clothes,
and another time she slipped in the creek, and was nearly drowned.
Again, she told, on climbing up the bank with a tub of clothes, she
found a cow making a meal of some pillow-slips which she had spread
out to dry an hour before.</p>
<p>&quot;The fence wasn't up then,&quot; she said, &quot;and we had
to keep the cows away when we had clothes out.&quot;</p>
<p>A little lower down from the shady tree, which served her for a
washhouse, two black gins were washing for a neighbour, whose house
stood nearly a mile back from the creek. They carried the things to
and fro in buckets on their heads, and they washed most of them in
the creek from a half-sunken log. Half a dozen piccaninnies
disported in the water meanwhile, and on the bank by the boiler
squatted an old lubra, smoking her pipe.</p>
<p>&quot;I could get the gins to wash my clothes, too,&quot; said
my selector friend. &quot;But I'd have to find meals for a dozen of
them, and they use too much soap. Well, it isn't altogether what
they use; they gammon they use it, and they take it to camp to wash
their own clothes. Anyhow, I don't mind washing as long as I've got
plenty of water, and the bank isn't slippery or boggy. Sometimes
it's both, and when you slip down in the mud with your washed
things, and have to wash them all over again&mdash;as I've had to
do more than once&mdash;then washing-day isn't your happiest day in
the week, I can tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>The picture of that cheerful soul, singing softly over her tub
under the bean tree, comes to me often when I hear Mrs. Sudds of
Suburbia grumbling over her task as she draws a plug to let the
dirty water into the sink, then turns on a tap to fill the tub
again.</p>
<p>But to return to our train&mdash;which wasn't allowing much time
even for visual explorations. The towns on this line were not an
interesting feature. One felt disappointed on finding such widely
known places as Glenrowan&mdash;famed as the scene where the
careers of the Kellys ended&mdash;and Wodonga&mdash;the Mecca of
northern and western cattlemen&mdash;were small and commonplace.
The ambition of every drover was to make the trip to Wodonga. To
them there was more magic in the name than there was in
&quot;marvellous Melbourne&quot; or &quot;Sydney the
Beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>You didn't hear so much of Homebush; the New South Wales
terminal for western drovers was generally Bourke. There was
nothing romantic or attractive about these; but Wodonga was famous,
alluring&mdash;it was always calling. The backblocker who had been
through with stock to those yards was some considerable shucks of a
person when he got back to his own cattle camp. Yet Albury, on the
opposite side of the Murray, could hold its head high, and put on
airs when it looked across at the little place with a big name, and
Wagga Wagga, Yass, and Goulburn, on the same line, were more
interesting to look at than Albury.</p>
<p>The overseer dismissed it with the off hand remark: &quot;I've
seen some merry times here, finishing up long trips from the Gulf,
and with wild cattle from the Mooni.&quot;</p>
<p>He was too busy chasing Ned Kelly and other notorious
acquaintances around Glenrowan and Benalla at the time. He spoke
quite familiarly of Ned and Dan. He was stockriding at Benalla in
those days, and on one occasion was mistaken for a detective, and
greeted with a broadside from the ironclad.</p>
<p>&quot;Were you killed?&quot; asked the man in front of him,
leaning eagerly forward.</p>
<p>The overseer regarded him ferociously for a moment; then he
turned to the window, and devoted his talents to the study of
landscapes. He never told another yarn. He was silenced. He was
killed</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br>
Settler's Homes.</h2>
<p>The region of log timber was always a fascinating study to me;
but the homes of the settlers, standing in the small clearings,
were rarely remarkable for beauty. They were generally commodious
and fairly comfortable; but they were not elegant. With the space
the settler has&mdash;miles of it all around him&mdash;and the
abundant material at hand, this fact was surprising to the
traveller, especially in situations where the natural features
appealed strongly to the artistic taste. Instead of improving these
features, or designing in harmony with them, the settler almost
invariably went to work in a way that destroyed their beauty. To
the artist in search of striking material the house was
picturesque; but to the average man from town it was positively
ugly, uninviting, cheerless.</p>
<p>Only here and there, as the train rolled on over hundreds of
miles, did one notice a place, in some smiling green valley, or
perched on a low hill, that pleased the eye, and struck one as a
snug-looking home. Most of the houses were rough, ramshackle
places; with glistening iron roofs that suggested an oven in summer
time. Particularly was this so in the northern and western parts of
the country. A globe-trotter, sweltering in our inland heat, and
gazing on the burning iron roofs &quot;out at the back o'
Bourne,&quot; might well question the sanity of the people who
lived there. There was nothing about them that was artistic; there
was nothing that deceived the eye&mdash;they were just as drab,
rugged and bare in front as at the back. Farm houses were notorious
for their bleak and ugly exteriors. There was an occasional home
that was pretty and graceful, but the ideal home was a rare
place.</p>
<p>From the comfort point of view, the squatters homes were the
most uniformly satisfying among bush dwellings. They were seldom
neat or ornamental, being low, spreading places, with little
architectural finish about them; but they were roomy, fairly cosy,
convenient, set in a broad garden of trees and flowers, and had a
wide, cool verandah on two or three sides; some times all round.
From the near-distant road they looked attractive, inviting; and
that was how every country home should look. Whether a small place
or a big place, with the bountiful assistance that nature lent
throughout the coastal regions, it could be made beautiful and snug
with little trouble and expense; and a home that was beautiful and
snug was more loved by mother and children than one that looked no
better than a shed.</p>
<p>A flower garden in front, a few shrubs and ornamental trees, or
a small orchard, would relieve the repelling bareness of the
humblest homestead. A few peach trees alone, when covered with
blossom, have a pleasant effect. But too often the country
residence stood bare of all decoration, like a boundary rider's
hut, looking directly out on a big paddock. No garden railings
being in front, the cows fed up to the door, and sometimes on cold
nights one or two camped on the verandah. Townspeople usually
endeavoured to grow something to make their places look nicer, even
when the places were only rented. Perhaps a familiarity with the
luxuriance of nature's garden had bred contempt in most bushmen. To
them the grandest trees in the forest were merely so much building
and fencing material; all that they had no immediate use for were
in the way. The drudgery of splitting and clearing, together with
the commonness of the article, had brought about this purely
commercial aspect of the situation.</p>
<p>The settler had an infinite variety of trees and shrubs at hand
that could be utilised for beautifying purposes, and which in the
course of years would have a high commercial value. Such trees as
pines, cedars, tulip, maple, beech, rosewood, maiden's blush, bean,
myrtle, mountain ash, coachwood, walnut, butter-bush, wild cherry,
lillipilli, silky oak, marara, kedgy kedgy, wilga, belar, borea,
yarran, myall, koko-minni, (beef wood), kurrajong, bottle tree,
bauhinia, quondong, Christmas tree, layunya, bingum (flame tree),
and wattles, were both ornamental and useful. If planted, a few now
and again on slack days, around his boundaries, and along his main
roads, they would give the selection a very pleasing appearance.
Every tree so planted would add to the value of his homestead, and
every year would add to the value of the trees. But instead of
planting he destroyed, for he reckoned every inch of ground as so
many blades of grass.</p>
<p>When he first goes on his selection he, is not blind to the
natural beauties about him, but foremost in his mind is, not how he
is going to make the most of them, and build up an attractive home
that his wife could take a pride in, but to select a site, nearest
the spot where water is most easily obtained. That is where the
tent is pitched during the time he is splitting timber, and
naturally when he is ready to build, the material is dumped down
near it. The rough timber requires a lot of trimming, and it is, of
course, an advantage to him to be camped close at hand while doing
this, and during the time the house is being erected. Thus the
situation is decided. Whatever of an attractive nature happens to
be thereabouts is sacrificed, while all timber is cut where it is
handiest to house and fences, no matter what the effect may be, or
how much damage a falling tree may do in the immediate
neighbourhood. He completes the ruin by ringbarking almost
everything except an odd tree here and there that will be useful
for splitting. Always he is on the lookout for splitting trees, and
if a saw mill is within reach for milling timber; but never is a
thought given to the ornamental.</p>
<p>Coming from the comparatively timberless interior, it was
positively painful to us to see the waste of timber-wealth in the
rich coastal regions. On most of the old places the timber that was
wantonly destroyed would now be a veritable gold mine to the
possessors. Land that was not intended for agriculture was all
ringbarked, not even a few of the majestic gums being left for
future home use. As the trees died they were burnt off, so that
when towns sprang up in the vicinity what might still have been a
valuable asset in the form of firewood was a missing quantity. When
poles, girders, and railway sleepers were wanted, these people who
once had plenty at their doors, had to go miles away into forests
that had not yet been selected to get them. Thousands on the land
have to buy timber to make repairs or additions to their homes who
had scarcely house room between the standing trees when they first
built and fenced. Many fine trees were destroyed for the sake of a
few sheets of bark, and saplings were cut down for birds' nests,
and to get a 'possum or a koala to kill. Timber is logically a
national asset, of which unborn generations have as much right to a
share as the current population.</p>
<p>The bushman is a handy person, but he is improvident in many
ways, and he doesn't spend much time on anything that is not of
some immediate practical use to him. He will work quite happily in
the rain to grow vegetables, whereas he would not devote a leisured
half-hour to the cultivation of flowers. He can't eat flowers; nor
does anybody want to buy them in his neighbourhood. In the planning
and building of his house the same spirit is
displayed&mdash;weather proof, and containing just as much room as
is necessary&mdash;those are his requirements. He is his own
architect. The plan is drawn on the ground with a stick. Perhaps it
is drawn only to give his wife an idea what the mansion will be
like, to show the position of the big fireplace that take up more
than half one end; and where the doors and windows will be. For
himself, the plan is fixed in his mind, he makes no elaborate
measurements when laying out the building, depending greatly on his
eye and his stepping. Considering that he uses very few tools,
dispensing with levels, squares, planes, and even chisels, he makes
a very good job with the material. Many a substantial hut is built
with only a fencer's kit. Others are constructed from ground to
roof without the use of a nail or a screw. Economy is studied from
beginning to end. Following no rigid specifications, the
construction has to conform a good deal to the demands of the
material, whilst the little details are planned as he goes along.
In populous districts 80 per cent of the houses are constructed of
sawn timber, brick and stone; but these are the work of skilled
tradesmen. Bush carpenters work mostly in rough timber, getting
what they need from the trees around them. But, however rough the
home may be, it could still be attractive if the settler made good
use of the natural wealth about him, instead of destroying it.</p>
<p>Beautiful surroundings mean a more contented and happier home
life, and induces those enjoying them to take greater interest in
their locality. What is more pleasant than to come into a country
town that is green with trees, and radiant with flowers, and where
the approaching roads are lined with native foliage, and the air is
sweet with the fragrance of native blossom.</p>
<p>Such a place is attractive in all seasons; and what a painful
contrast is presented by the town that is a mere conglomeration of
bare houses dumped on a plain! There are many such in all the
States, and the traveller at first sight of any of them remarks to
his neighbour that he would not care to live in such a dreary hole
as that. Yet the dreariest hole can be made inviting by a few trees
and flower gardens. Most of the N.S.W. country towns have a
repelling influence: they drive people away&mdash;or to drink,
instead of enticing people into them. We found the Victorian towns
generally much more attractive, and probably that was one of the
reasons why the population was more evenly distributed over the
southern State than it was in New South Wales.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br>
On the Track.</h2>
<p>One of the passengers was an old drover, whose talking apparatus
was set going by the scenes around Wodonga and Albury, and for a
long stretch he entertained us with reminiscences of the
overland.</p>
<p>&quot;In my 25 years' experience on the overland,&quot; he said,
'I've had to do with a good many kinds of marketable stock, an'
there's no two kinds that can be managed an' drove the same way. If
I was asked which was the worst and which was the best to travel
with, I'd say pigs an' mules.</p>
<p>&quot;You mostly find me with cattle, because they're driven
more than anything else, an' the trips are longer. I'm more used to
'em an' after all I prefer them. They're cheerier, livelier sort of
company. They keep you interested, no matter how long you're with
them, supplyin' a thrill an' a spice of danger every now an' again
that keeps you alive. It's the little sensations occurrin' when you
least expect them that brings you through a lonely six-months'
journey as lively as a cricket. You haven't time to get dull an'
mopy; an' I'll guarantee there's nothing will wake a man up
quicker, when he's dozin' in his saddle on night watch than a
sudden stampede. It electrifies him; his first shout to 'em is so
spontaneous that it startles himself. Nor does anything sharpen his
wits so much. At the first rumble of hoofs on a dark night he
doesn't know which direction they're takin', but he knows they're
not particular whether they run over him or not to save themselves
from bein' run over by the crush behind. He's got to think an' act
pretty quick, especially when he's caught in an awkward
position.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember one night we were camped close to a big lagoon.
I had to ride along it on watch, because there was a shallow neck
where they could cross. It was a very frosty night in midwinter. I
was well wrapped up, but that dead sleepy I could scarcely keep my
eyes open. We'd been doin' some shoppin' in a township the evenin'
before. All at once, as I was dozin' along by the water, they
sprang up, and before I knew where I was they were almost on top of
me, an' that was enough; I wheeled a sharp round an' plunged
straight in. That scamper an' the plunge into the icy water woke me
up so completely that I could 'ave watched all night then without
gettin' sleepy.</p>
<p>&quot;Cattle are the most dangerous to travel with, 'specially
bullocks that have never been worked much on their native runs.
It's in the wild rides they set you through thick timber on dark
nights, an' without notice, that the risk lies. You have to trust
your horse to clear logs an' holes, an' the trunks of trees, an'
you want the eyes of an owl to save your head from being bashed
against limbs. Bullocks are always liable to rush, even when they
come from the quietest herds. Cows are less timid, but they are
restless; while the most troublesome of horny mobs is a mixed lot.
The best is a mob of bulls. Nothing scares those chaps. They won't
be bustled on the way, an, exceptin' that they want to interview
every strange beast they see, they are well-behaved; and when they
go to camp you could have a corroboree around 'em without
disturbin' them.</p>
<p>&quot;Sheep are tame things, but tiresome. They're, the most
stupid animals you can handle, an' on a dry track about the most
stubborn. Whether you're mounted or on foot, an' even when you've
got a good dog to do most of the roundin' up and runnin' about, you
put in a good hard day's work coverin' the average six-miles stage.
Sheep won't go without a leader; and when the leader sees anything
unusual he stops an' stares at it, an' the whole mob stops an'
stares, too. When you've got a flock of several thousands it's no
easy matter getting 'em all movin' again. Maybe the front lot will
turn back an' make a packed bunch in the centre. You have that
trouble at every gate an' at every little creek an' gully that has
to be crossed. To avoid bein' delayed while they stand starin' at
the strange scenery, you have to rush a few through, or drag a few
over, an' then the others will follow. When you come to a river or
creek that they can't get over without swimmin', you have to pitch
camp an' build a bridge&mdash;which might take anything from a day
to a fortnight. No simple makeshift of a bridge will do. It has to
have a low wall of bushes along the sides, an' strong enough to
keep them from goin' through, for if one happened to take it into
his head to jump over into the river, the others would follow him,
one after the other. The decking has to be covered with bags, an '
the bags in turn covered with earth or sand. Then you carry two or
three over to the other side as decoys, an' after a lot of shoutin'
an' dancin' an' rushin' about, you get them stringin' across.</p>
<p>&quot;One good point about them, they're not much trouble at
night. With calico hurdles run round them, you can sit an' watch
them from the camp fire. Without hurdles, you stroll round on foot,
or just up and down on one side. A few beasts might go off a cattle
camp at a time, but when one sheep goes it's almost a certainty all
the others will go after him. So as long as you can see a few
woollies in front of you, you're pretty sure they're all there.
They rush sometimes, an' I've seen 'em flatten out a wire fence
more than once. One night a mob rushed over me. They'd been feedin'
down a slope, and I was crowdin' 'em back, when a dingo makes a big
stir among them at the top. I stumbled over one just as the whole
flock started full rip down the hill. A sheep hasn't got very big
feet, and it isn't very heavy; but I tell you it ain't a bed of
roses bein' run over by a lot of 'em all close together. However,
after about a dozen had stumbled over me there came a bit of a
break, which allowed the next one to see the obstruction in front
of him. He jumped, an' thereafter everyone on the same track,
whether it saw me or not, made a bound at the same
place&mdash;excepting a couple at the tail end, which jumped too
soon, and landed on top of me.</p>
<p>&quot;They're aggravatin' things, is sheep. All the same, nobody
in his proper senses would chuck up a billet 'of drovin' them to
take on turkeys. I've seen odd flocks of geese bein' drove short
journeys, an' I think they're about the limit. One lot I had under
observation was in charge of a boy and a girl. They reminded me of
sheep in some ways. Anything at all uncommon would pull them up;
they travelled dead slow, with their heads all the while on the
swing&mdash;studyin' the landscape, but they didn't jib when they
saw water; they let out a joyous cackle, an' set sail for it.
Musterin' 'em up out of a boggy swamp, or gettin' 'em out of a
small lake, was not as easy as ketchin' 'em in a paddock. They had
no dog, as the boy said they couldn't do anything with the poultry
while there was a dog about; so he had to do all the splashing and
swimming himself whenever the flock made a stampede for water.</p>
<p>&quot;However, gobblers was as far as I got down to on the
overland. I was spellin' the mokes on a selection at the time, an'
the selector's wife asked me would I mind goin' with young Tommy
into town with a flock. There were about 10 of them, male an'
female, an' we had to overland them on foot, two comfortable days'
journey with fair travelling. I thought it would be dead easy, as
they seemed quite tractable about their own yard. The family gave
us a start, and we got on fine until the road cut through a patch
of thick scrub. Keepin' them out of that scrub was the deuce's own
job, an' it was a tangle of lawyer vines an' stingin' trees that
gave us fits every time we had to plunge into it; an' every time we
got them back on the track we had to count them carefully to make
sure we hadn't missed any. 'Twasn't more 'an a mile from side to
side, but we were two solid hours gettin' through it.</p>
<p>&quot;Towards evenin' we came on to a bit of grass that was
inhabited by a thick, strong-winged variety of grasshopper. Those
gobblers had been partly reared on grasshoppers, an' they were
pretty hungry just them. A couple would fly up, an' half the mob
would go after one, an' the rest of them after the other. We'd get
them together again, after a lot of running and shooing, and they'd
be goin' along fine, when several 'hoppers would be flushed at
once, an' away would go the whole lot of them, scattering towards
all the points of the compass, some racin' away back behind us.
There's no mistake they had us fairly flogged out by the time we
got to our night camp. Then we had to get them into trees to roost
out of harm's way, an' you know what cantankerous things they can
be when it comes to gettin' them on to strange roosts. The only
good point about 'em was they didn't want watchin' once they
settled down.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought pigs couldn't be worse than them, but I was
mistaken. If you take the bad travellin' points of the turkey an'
the goose an' mix 'em together, the pig can still go one worse. You
can't lead or drive a mob of pigs like any other animals. They go
along gruntin' an' rootin' an' foragin' all the time; you've got to
work every yard of the way to keep them movin' on the right track.
Stop a minute, an' they'll stop; try to bustle them an' they'll
split in all directions an' say 'Whugh.' An' when they come to a
bog or a waterhole they'll plough in an' lie there. You can shout
yourself hoarse, an' caper around an' pelt 'em till you're knocked
up, an' all you'll get from them is a grunt. They don't take much
notice of dogs either; they stand an' smack their chops at a dog,
or run backwards an' say &quot;Whugh.' You've got to go in an' root
them out; if it's a hot day, an' they're a bit tired, you've got to
pretty well drag them out. An' they're not animals that keep any
regular hours. They don't stampede at night time, but they get up
at any hour to go rootin' about for something to eat. A black pig
is hard to see in the dark, an' he goes moochin' off so quietly
that it's the simplest thing out to lose him off camp.</p>
<p>&quot;On long trips you've got to take one or two waggons piled
full of pumpkins or corn. You camp at a good watering place, an'
after a feed of pumpkin or corn they'll' settle down fairly well
for the night. In the morning, when they've got used to the track,
they'll be nosin' an' gruntin' around the waggons for breakfast an'
makin' trouble with the cook. They're always ready for tucker time;
you can make 'em finish a hard day well by going ahead an' ringin'
the dinner bell.</p>
<p>&quot;I carried a big football on one trip. When they were extra
cantankerous I'd get away in front, call out 'Pig, pig, pig,' an'
start bouncin' the ball hard. At the second thump I'd hear 'em
cheering, an' then they'd come along with their ears flappin', as
if there was nothin' they enjoyed so much as brisk trottin'
exercise on the overland. They thought I was breakin' up
pumpkins.</p>
<p>&quot;The best on the track, as I said, is the mule. Horses are
good; with one man riding in front an' one at the tail, you go
along serenely all day. They don't jib at gates or crossings, but
at night, when you let them go, they have a habit of wanderin' an'
scatterin', an' making back. Donkeys are' fairly good, too, an'
goats are not bad. But the mule takes the palm for good conduct on
the track. I travelled six weeks with a mob, an' after the first
week all I had to do when startin' away from camp was to sing out
'Hee-haw,' like one of themselves, an' every one would answer, an'
then trot together an' follow after me like so many foals. The mule
is a stubborn animal in some ways, but on the droving track I
respect him.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
Refreshment Stalls&mdash;Business Cards and Signs.</h2>
<p>One thing which struck the traveller on these various lines was
the manner, of catering at the refreshment stalls. In South
Australia, from Mannahill to Adelaide, and thence to Murray Bridge,
the waiters gave one the impression of being all new hands; they
bustled about a great deal without appearing to get much done. They
were not particular whether you paid your 3d or 4d when you got
your cup of tea or when you brought back the cup. Either they were
too flurried or else they had marvelious faith in the honesty of
travellers. If the latter, their confidence was sadly misplaced in
some instances. The tea was always boiling hot, and a three or five
minutes' stay didn't always suffice to drink it. Women mostly kept
their seats, and men carried cups of tea in to them. They sat
sipping till the train started on&mdash;and the crockery was
carried away. And the breakage was tremendous. Five cups were
broken at one carriage door at Gawlor, and altogether 30 were
broken along the train through careless or hurried handling in
passing from one to another. At some places boys and girls ran
along the platform to receive cups and saucers from passengers
before the train started, and even then a good many departed for
tables new.</p>
<p>Through Victoria and on the New South Wales side the
stallkeepers were more wary, and did more service with less show.
You paid for the cup as well as for your tea, the cup money being
refunded when you returned the vessel. It was remarkable how much
quicker the ladies got through their tea under this system, while
the breakages were scarcely worth mentioning. At one place in
Victoria we had to return empty-handed to our protegees, and inform
them they must come and get their own tea, as all the cups were on
chains, and could only be carried away in pieces. We were glad.
This style enabled us to get a drink ourselves, whereas our only
refreshment hitherto was the steam from the cups as we carried them
out.</p>
<p>At one place two merry girls presented us with cards, on the
backs of which these set rules were printed for the guidance of
travellers:</p>
<p class="newspaper">&quot;Federal Railway Rooms. Board, 6d per
foot. Breakfast at 5 a.m., dinner at 6 a.m., supper at 7 a.m.
Guests wishing to get up without being called can have self raising
flour for supper. Guests are requested not to speak to the dumb
waiter&mdash;he is deaf. Guests wishing to do a little driving will
be supplied with hammer and nails on application. The rooms are
convenient to three cemeteries; hearses to hire at 1s 11&frac12;d
per day. If you are fond of athletics, and like good jumping, lift
the mattress and see the bed spring. If the room gets too warm,
open the window and see the fire escape. If your lamp goes out,
take a feather out of the pillow&mdash;that's light enough for
anyone. Anybody troubled with nightmare will find a halter on the
bedpost. Don't worry about paying the bill; the house is supported
by its foundations.&quot;</p>
<p>A card picked up further back was more to the point. It
contained this:</p>
<p class="newspaper">&quot;Boarders taken by the day, week, or
month. Those who do not pay promptly, taken by the neck.</p>
<p>Another place, called the Beehive Hotel, had the following scrap
of verse written under a representation of a beehive:</p>
<p class="verse">Now, in this hive, we're all alive;<br>
We're all as sweet as honey;<br>
And if you want a drink step in,<br>
But don't forget the money.</p>
<p>These lines were inscribed on a slab of a wayside pub near
Bright, Gippsland:</p>
<p class="verse">One swallow does not make a spring,<br>
If you believe that story; come<br>
With me into the bar, and try<br>
One swallow of this fellow's rum.<br>
Then you are sting and acid proof<br>
If you don't spring clean through the roof.</p>
<p>The Green Gate Inn, at Orange, used to display the sign of a
green painted gate with the couplet:</p>
<p class="verse">This gate hangs well, and hinges none.<br>
Refresh and pay, and travel on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br>
Women and the Gun&mdash;The Australian Girl.</h2>
<p>From Albury to Sydney was the best span of all for scenery. It
was everchanging and ever-beautiful. The other sections were dotted
with beauty spots; but along here they crowded on top of one
another. They were all beauty spots; mountain, valley, town and
river; orchards, gorges, hamlets and waterfalls, swam past the
watching eyes. And there was a succession of names familiar to
every Australia school boy. Wagga Wagga and the Murrumbidgee River
recalled two old friends to John Jovius Muggs&mdash;Wagga rugs and
Murrumbidgee blankets. The latter was a bare bag, split open. The
former was also a bag, likewise split, with an old woollen' blanket
that had become too thin to keep out cold, sewn on for lining. It
was common on farms and selections, and scores of travellers with
horses and vehicles carried it, also shearers, drovers, and
squattage hands used it. This river, too, was the happy hunting
ground of the Murrumbidgee whaler and his brother the sundowner.
There were some whalers still in the bends, and perhaps always
would be; but the sundowners sundowned no more.</p>
<p>We watched the boards now with the growing interest of homing
exiles, like long absent members going back to the old homestead,
and seeing a story in every landmark.</p>
<p>Cootamundra&mdash;Binalong&mdash;Yass&mdash;Goulburn, &quot;the
cathedral city of the south,&quot; a grand place for a summer
holiday. Besides the Wollondilly River and the Mulwarree Ponds at
your feet, you have in proximity Lake Bathurst, Lake George, the
Wombeyan Caves, and the Look Down on the Shoalhaven River.</p>
<p>Along here we had a glimpse of a fair Australian girl striding
nonchalantly through the bush with a gun on her shoulder, and an
alert eye directed towards the treetops.</p>
<p>Those among the passengers who lived in cities craned their
necks and stared as though she was the latest thing in freaks. The
bush men had a better knowledge of their big country; they looked
at her with soft eyes, remembering days when they had rambled with
her prototypes in far-off forests.</p>
<p>Most Australian girls and women living in the bush could shoot.
They used light, single-barrel guns. Many of the girls accompanied
their brothers when shooting pigeons and wallabies along the edges
of scrubs near their homes, and not a few of them could bring down
a bird on the wing or a wallaby in full flight, just as well as
their male companions. They shot 'possums also when the animals
came on to the roof at night, on the sheds, or into the
neighbouring trees. Shooting was an accomplishment that came useful
at some time or other to nearly every woman in the bush, and the
more lonely or isolated her home the more necessary was it for her
to be able to handle a gun.</p>
<p>The first women on the north-eastern farms and selections could
tell many a laughable tale of their early experiences with a gun.
The men were much away from home, and in their absence many
occasions arose when it was necessary for the women to arm
themselves. The blacks were generally cheeky and hard to get rid of
if there were no men about; but a little demonstration with the
&quot;shooting stick&quot; altered their demeanour. It wasn't
necessary for a woman to threaten them; all she had to do was to
shoot a hawk or a crow in their presence, or show them how she
could hit a small tree, and thereafter she was safe.</p>
<p>But the use of the gun was principally for protection against
bird and animal pests. A man would usually teach his wife first to
load and fire light blank charges, mainly to frighten parrots and
cockatoos from the crops, and ravens and hawks from the poultry
run. Gradually she became accustomed to the weapon, and by degrees
learned to shoot well.</p>
<p>A woman on the Orara River, who had received no instruction at
all, one day when alone was horrified to discover a big snake,
stretched along between the ridge-pole and the capping of her
house. She tried at first to poke it out with a clothes-prop, but
could not get at it; and as it shifted along the ridge she dreaded
that it would slide down and get under the floor, when she would be
terrified with the thoughts of it all night.</p>
<p>Looking about, her eye lit on the gun&mdash;a heavy,
double-barrelled muzzleloader&mdash;hanging on the wall. She took
it down and loaded it in the way she had seen her husband do. Then,
tremblingly, she held it under her arm, and, pointing it towards
the roof, shut her eyes, and fired. When the smoke had cleared
away, and she had got her breath back, she looked eagerly for the
result.</p>
<p>The snake had not moved, and there wasn't the mark of a shot
anywhere. This puzzled her. She was sure she could not have missed
the house, for the door was shut, and she had stood near the centre
of the room with the windows directly behind her. However, she
loaded again, with a heavier charge, and this time she put the gun
to her shoulder. She aimed as carefully as her shaking hands would
permit, then shut her eyes tight, and pulled the trigger. There
followed a thunderous report, a frantic scream, a heavy fall,
mingled with the noise of breaking glass.</p>
<p>She had held the gun loosely, and with the heavy charge of shot
she had put in it the &quot;kick&quot; had knocked her backwards.
It took her some seconds to realise that she wasn't shot. Then she
looked about timidly for the remains of the snake. But it was still
on the ridge-pole, moving away uninjured; while a picture of her
grandmother, hanging half-way up on the wall, was shattered to
pieces.</p>
<p>However, she triumphed in the end. The snake slid down the wall
outside, when she despatched it with a handy waddy. It was only
after her husband's return, when he found a charge of shot in one
of the barrels, that the mystery of her first effort was explained.
She had put the powder in one barrel and the shot in the other.</p>
<p>The incident in the pretty Goulburn valley started a general
conversation on the Australian girl. She was discussed from all
points, in all her phases. After due comparison with other girls
she carried the vote of the compartment. The well-seasoned
globe-wanderer, who had inspected the beauties of many lands,
agreed that, looked at in any way you liked, she was a plum.</p>
<p>She presented to you an attractive face, whether you found her
on the farm or in the factory, on a backblock squattage or in a
city home; in domestic service, or in the Governor's drawing-room.
With her facial beauty and sparkling, mischievous eyes, she
combined a graceful carriage, a charming personality, and a rare
beauty of form. Like a gay butterfly in the sunshine&mdash;of
sprightly but sympathetic nature, warm, vivacious, athletic and
courageous; but, at all times, delightfully womanly, handy and
industrious.</p>
<p>One of her most admirable traits was that she worked with a good
will all day if need be; worked without grumbling, making a trouble
of nothing; singing cheerily the day through, always with a smile
on her lips and a pleasantry for those about her.</p>
<p>Like her brother, she was not a one-job girl; she could turn her
hands to a hundred things; and when times were bad for the
town-bred her busy fingers still enabled her to make ends meet. Not
only was she generally useful indoors; but outside she could apply
her energies readily to many things. She was not exclusively
domestic, though mostly trained in all domestic arts. Her sturdy
health and sprightliness owed much to the admixture that made up
the life of every bush girl. Her heroism, too, stood out as one of
the most admirable features of Australian settlement. Through all
the periods of history, in the perils and dangers that threatened
communities, the brightest gleams were the heroism and endurance of
our bush girls and women. Whether menaced by flood or fire, or
greater calamities, they played their part nobly. In emergencies
they tackled the hard tasks of men as readily as they mounted a
horse in times of sudden sickness, and rode long night journeys
through the bush.</p>
<p>The Australienne showed creditably in many branches of sport
that required agility, skill and stamina. In a land ever bright and
cheery, it would be surprising if they were not of a buoyant
nature; and to their general smartness, their neatness and their
athletics they owed, in a large measure, their fine physique. Old
grandmother smiled and thought of her prime girlhood, as she saw
the 20th century lasses gambolling on the grass, climbing hills and
rocky gorges after flowers, rivalling man on the tennis court,
playing hockey and cricket; she saw the ghosts of prude matrons
peer with shocked faces through the veil of the past at young women
rowing and running races in public, and spinning along the streets
on bicycles.</p>
<p>There were some who held that the women of to-day were going
beyond their sphere in recreation and avocation, that her proper
place was in her home. But a woman who was always in her home did
not live naturally or make home happy. The medical profession
recognised&mdash;demanded&mdash;that in girlhood, at, least,
latitude in vigorous out door exercise was necessary for her health
and development. We laughed to-day at what was considered ladylike
50 years ago, and the people of next century would be laughing at
us; for the whole tribe of us&mdash;men included&mdash;were but
fashion's tools, and the slaves of convention, after all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV<br>
The City Girl and the Country Girl.</h2>
<p>Moss Yale&mdash;the last refreshment room. We had our money's
worth at this place Here we began to meet with Sydney
excursionists, for hereabouts was one of the beauty spots of
Australia&mdash;a wild, luxuriant, romantic belt, in which were
gorges a thousand feet deep, and numerous droning waterfalls. We
were getting home&mdash;and the subject of conversation had drifted
to the city and country girl. We had a long argument about them,
and while agreeing that both were charming, the argument
crystallised into the fact that they weren't the same girl. One of
the most noticeable differences between them was to be observed in
their home life. One moved in an atmosphere of placid domesticity;
the other in a continuous social whirl. Home training, as the
country girl understood it, was a negligible quantity with the
average city girl. On the same parable she could hardly be said to
have any love of home. Her interests day and evening were out of
doors&mdash;outside the family doors, that is; which does not
necessarily mean in the open air, for anybody else's house, if
there were congenial spirits there, was preferred to her own in
leisure hours. She loved to gad about in fine clothes, to air them
by the seaside, in public parks and gardens; to fly around in
trains and trams and vehicles; to go boating with young fellows on
rivers and harbours. Theatres, concerts, picture shows, and sports
of various kinds helped to make up the continual round of
entertainments that became to her an important part of existence.
She led a butterfly kind of life, fluttering from one attraction to
another; and she suggested the moth also&mdash;chasing the gleams
of brightness in the night hours. She no sooner returned from one
amusement than she was thinking of where or what she could go to
next. Rarely did a thought occur of what she could do at home.</p>
<p>This gay butterfly, who was smart and charming in a social way,
did not throw many compliments to her rustic sister, whom she
regarded as being behind the times. But the country girl on
changing places soon adapted herself to city ways. On the other
hand, it took the city girl a long while to adapt herself to
country life, and to succeed in that sphere. The secret was in the
home training.</p>
<p>The country girl was brought up amid the old and admirable
institutions associated with the home. In her environment, there
was not so much to distract from the family circle, and brothers
and sisters found the greatest and constant companionship amongst
themselves. The old home was endeared to her, and by her early life
habits and the childhood memories that clung to them she became for
ever a lover of home. To her there was no place like it, however
humble it might be; to her &quot;home&quot; was a love word,
meaning almost everything that was precious. Sports and dances and
other amusements came her way from time to time; but no matter how
enthusiastic she might be over them she was always &quot;glad to
get home.&quot; Every member of the family made for the door like
homing pigeons as night came on, and they gathered round the table
or round the fire, reading books and papers, playing indoor games,
chatting and telling stories. Those homely customs in childhood
make all the difference in after life. Instead of spending her
girlhood in continuous pleasure-seeking, she learned all the duties
of home, and by the time she married was as efficient as her handy
and resourceful mother.</p>
<p>One might say that almost from her tender years the country girl
learnt to be useful. Her mother's home was an industrial school, in
which all the domestic arts were ever actively under her notice.
The mother had to make and fashion for herself many things which
city women had made and fashioned for them by others. To be able to
prepare an appetising meal with very little material was a great
advantage to a young wife, for much of the happiness of married
life rested on the table, and on efficient household management.
The country home was lacking in many of the conveniences that
lightened work in a city house, and initiative and resourcefulness
were the results.</p>
<p>The city girl hadn't much need to think and contrive for
herself. She was the product of an attractive environment, whose
home was made dull by the countless allurements around it, and the
license to follow her own bent at the impressionable period of her
life. The winter hearth, around which clung so many fond
associations for her grandmother, was cold and meaningless to her.
Rather than sit moping there, she could go out in the forest and
rain in search of a new thrill. She must have thrills, frequent
doses of little sensational shocks, or life became a boredom. When
she had to earn her own living, she preferred the factory to
domestic service for that reason. As a factory hand she had more
time to herself, more company, and more tram rides. Naturally, her
knowledge of housekeeping was limited to the masculine degree. Nor
did she want very much to learn; she would go to a restaurant
rather than bother about cooking her own dinner.</p>
<p>Very often she had to begin to teach herself after marriage what
she should have learned from her mother. Her early experiences,
too, with plenty of freedom and pocket money, and opportunities for
going about and enjoying all kinds of amusements, did not incline
her later to stick contentedly at home, to be careful and saving.
Nor had she always a love of children in the same sense as her
country sister, not infrequently regarding such as
encumbrances.</p>
<p>It was the homeliness, the home-loving nature, domestic
proficiency and cheerful industry of the country-bred girl that
made her eminently successful as a wife and mother. Because home
had been her world in infancy, she moved in almost perpetual calm,
looking on life with quiet and softened eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br>
Women in the Saddle.</h2>
<p>Bowral Mittagong, of the chalybeate spring; the home of the
waratah, and the locale of the State Cottage Homes for invalid
Children. Bowral to Mittagong was an interesting three miles,
passing under &quot;The Gib,&quot; through a tunnel 716 feet long.
In this neighbourhood was the old town of Berrima. It was a small
place for its age, and unique in that it owed its prominence to a
gaol. Terrible Berrima Gaol, once a name to conjure with, and
immortalised in &quot;Robbery Under Arms.&quot;</p>
<p>In this scenic stretch, a couple of equestriennes, riding
astride, struck a new note in the advancement of the Australian
girl. It was a note that sent a thrill of pride and satisfaction
through the overseer and myself. Both being horsemen, we admired
the horsewoman when we saw her riding in the only sensible style
that was suited to her and the horse.</p>
<p>The side-saddle was disappearing from the bush without regrets.
At one time almost every woman had a riding habit in her wardrobe,
and a side-saddle in the harness room. Women rode a lot then, and
if the bifurcated style had been in vogue they would have ridden
still more, and with less trouble. Riding would probably have
continued in universal favour among women instead of giving way for
a long period to driving. The horse was the principal means of
locomotion in the country. Distances were far between places, with
no roads or merely bush tracks to travel on. So when &quot;the
missus&quot; went visiting she had to ride, often carrying a baby
on her knee. Shopping entailed long journeys. Sometimes she went
alone, starting away at daylight, and returning after dark. There
were sliprails to put down on the way, and after dismounting at
these she would remount by means of a log or stump. If no such
friendly aid was at hand, she led her horse alongside the fence,
and sprang into the saddle from the bottom rail. This was not a
simple accomplishment when she had parcels strapped in front, and
at the side of the saddle, and, perhaps a bag or basket in her
hand. When hubby was working far from home she carried his dinner
to him on horseback, and sickness in the family sent her galloping
many a journey by day and night. How or why she stuck so long to
the side-saddle was a mystery and a marvel.</p>
<p>A woman sitting comparatively on one side of the horse hadn't
the same advantage to follow its movements as the other had who sat
equilaterally and centrally over the animal, whilst the lop-sided
burden was harder on the horse. Some women had long held that it
was one of their rights to ride as a man did. Mrs. Alex. Tweedie,
writing in the &quot;Lady's Magazine,&quot; advised the
cross-saddle for her sex. &quot;Practical ways and means,&quot; she
wrote, &quot;always receive recognition in the end, however much
Mrs. Grundy may growl. Cross-riding will come. The bicycle was an
innovation, and as women could not possibly ride sideways, and
there was no conservative party accustomed to a side-saddle to
shriek at the suggestion of a cross one, cycling became general,
and women among its chief devotees. Society, says: &quot;The
side-saddle is the right thing; it has been here since it was
introduced into England by Anne, of Bohemia, the wife of Richard
II., and being here, it is, of course, quite right and proper that
it should remain.&quot; They forget that the good dame used the
side-saddle to show off her gorgeous robes and as velvets, satins
and embroideries were more important than hard riding, the
pommelled, chair-like seat suited the purpose. Gradually evolution
has dropped these flowing robes and embroideries, because women
ride in earnest nowadays, and no longer amble out on a palfrey,
merely for show.&quot;</p>
<p>The clumsy and cumbersome gear was following into the limbo of
discarded things. The ugliness and awkwardness of the side-saddle
was marked in contrast with the neatness of the new style. Nothing
could be more graceful on horseback than these country girls riding
astride. When properly groomed, their seat in the saddle, with the
lithe forms following rythmically the movements of the horse, were
attractive to the eye.</p>
<p>Riding and hunting were common under many flags, but in this
field the Australienne stood easily first, though she mounted last.
Her only serious rival was the American cow-girl, who had shown her
skill on bucking bronchos on show grounds. She rode in a saddle
that the bush girl considered dead easy. The latter was at home in
all saddles. To know her at her best, one must see her in the wide
spaces, where she rode hard through thick timber, over mountainous
country, hunting and mustering; where she swam her horse fearlessly
over flooded streams, and undertook journeys of a thousand miles
and more across unsettled territory.</p>
<p>Women were not given to riding after records, unless there was
something more substantial than vain glory at the end of the trip.
For all that, many a long journey was made in the cross-saddle of
which little was heard outside the local districts. The daughter of
the house might be the only one available to carry an urgent
message, or to obtain something of immediate importance, and when
the mail coach was not due for a couple of days there was nothing
for it but saddle up and ride. The most pathetic case I have heard
of was that of a Milparinka girl, who rode to a distant place on a
burning summer day to get a bag of rain water for her father, who
was sick. In that dry locality, people depended for water on
soakages, dams and excavated tanks. The heat was so severe that
endeavours were made to persuade her not to go. She went, however,
and she got the precious water; but she was swaying in her saddle
as she returned to her home, and she died shortly after they had
lifted her down.</p>
<p>I think the best overland journey for women was that
accomplished by two daughters of Mr. Sid Kidman, the Cattle King,
who rode from their home in South Australia, to Cunnamulla, in
Queensland. The journey was over a thousand miles, a good deal of
it across trackless country. Both girls used the cross-saddle. They
were accompanied only by a blackboy guide, and some days covered as
much as 60 miles. They camped out at night, for there was nothing
else but the tent and the camp-fire for them on long stretches of
their way. They were bound for Brisbane, and their shortest way was
via Cunnamulla, from which place they took the train.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br>
&quot;Sydney, the Beautiful.&quot;</h2>
<p>The boards were swimming past. Picton&mdash;Campbelltown (which
flowed with milk and wine)&mdash;Liverpool (the portmanteaux and
ginghams, were hauled down from the racks, coats were folded and
strapped, and miscellaneous property collected from divers places
and stowed away)&mdash;Granville (the women put their gloves on and
asked each other if their hats were straight)&mdash;Sydney, the
Queen of Australian cities&mdash;and a general scatter.</p>
<p>This congested centre, which contained within its boundaries
about three-parts of the population of the State, was called
&quot;Sydney the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The City of the
Beautiful Harbour.&quot; With its notorious bottle-neck railway
system, its narrow, crooked streets and their numerous dead ends,
and the hoardings that everywhere met the eye, and its thousands of
jerry built houses, we found it beautiful only in spots. Nor was it
as clean as Adelaide and Melbourne. The council's idea of cleaning
the city was to sweep up the backyard and dump the smellful refuse
in the front garden. The rubbish was punted a few miles out to sea,
whence a good deal of it was shortly washed back and strewn along
the beaches, where thousands of people gathered on holidays for
fresh air and surf bathing. They went there on Saturday afternoons
and Sundays to recuperate after a week in a packed, stuffy city.
Particularly did they resort to these places for their children's
sake, and when the beaches and the water were polluted by the dirty
methods of civic housekeepers, what should be a health resort and
magnificent recreation ground became a positive danger to them.</p>
<p>In Sydney we saw the ludicrous spectacle of uniformed patrolmen
watching for the unwary citizen who dropped a tram ticket, the same
being calculated to make the city look untidy. To throw down a
piece of paper or a cigar butt or an empty matchbox in the streets
was an offence punishable under the city by-laws. There were
placards posted up in the trams and in conspicuous places about the
main thoroughfares, requesting the careless citizen to &quot;keep
the city clean.&quot; And all the while the council, whose business
it was to look after the health of the people, to keep its own
domain respectable and sanitary, and show a good example to
suburban aldermen, was turning the &quot;beautiful harbour&quot;
into pollution, and making the littoral offensive to residents and
disgusting to visitors.</p>
<p>We thought on seeing so many hoardings that the council was
deriving a good income from the unsightly things. We discovered
later that the license fees from this source aggregated only
&pound;80 a year, which wasn't half the salary of the officer
employed to supervise hoardings. Besides being objectionable in the
aesthetic sense, they were costing the ratepayers about a hundred
pounds a year.</p>
<p>To the proprietors they were more remunerative, in some
instances, than shops and houses. One little space in a good
locality was worth over &pound;100 per annum to the owner. It had
previously been occupied by a shop, which returned only about
&pound;60 in rent. The shop was burnt down. In this way hoardings
hindered progress. Hundred's of vacant blocks in Sydney were used
solely for poster purposes. One alderman, whose name was tacked up
on a central thoroughfare, said he was always in favour of
pictorial hoardings; he contended that the hoardings were covered
by works of art. In his estimation they transformed uninteresting
thoroughfares in beautiful open-air art galleries, where the
thirsty Domainite could see the virtues of Hogg's whisky
pictorially displayed.</p>
<p>A long-suffering public entered a protest now and again to the
effect that if their civic representatives must have these
decorations about them, they should at least see that the
ratepayers were not made to pay for them.</p>
<p>After which they went on paying.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br>
The Rock and Fence-Rail Artist.</h2>
<p>The rock and fence-rail artist was almost ubiquitous; but he
seemed to flourish more exuberantly about Sydney and its environs
than anywhere else. His work made an impression on the visitor
because there was no escaping it. One of the first things to catch
the eyes of passengers on the incoming mailboats was &quot;Drink
Hogg's Whisky.&quot; The artist did some Alpine climbing to
emblazon that motto on the city's front gate. Beside it, pigmenting
the rugged grandeur of the towering cliffs, he saw the imperative
notice, &quot;Get your hair cut at McShaver's.&quot; It flashed
across his vision like a jackal-of-trade yelling at him as he
approached.</p>
<p>He saw a prominent point ahead, with a bold inscription across
its nose. Some historic landmark, probably. With the interest of an
observant sea-rover he raised his glasses, and read: &quot;Fang and
Molar. Teeth extracted while U wait.&quot; The boat passed the next
point quite close. It was a picturesque spot, with a small bay and
a semicircular sandy beach in perspective. He took a snapshot of it
with the camera. Later, when he examined the result, he found
himself being asked a number of impertinent questions: &quot;Do you
suffer with cold feet?&quot; &quot;How's your appetite?&quot;
&quot;Do you sleep well? If not, take Stiffner's Paralyser before
going to bed.&quot;</p>
<p>The scenery was obscured, if not obliterated, by the
brush-prints of the rock and fence-rail artist. As the passenger
proceeded to the Quay he learnt quite a heap about women's wear, of
figure improvers and remodellers, intermixed with Scab's ointment
for sore legs, and Scratcher's powder for bugs and fleas. These
things hung in his memory as the scenic, features of Port Jackson.
The sordid commercialism of the place hit him in the eye wherever
he looked.</p>
<p>The rock and fence-rail artist was an industrious wanderer,
whose masterpieces you came upon in the most unexpected places. A
fence rail was eminently suitable for his impressionist work,
providing it was where everybody could see it, or where it was
likely to stamp itself on the memory. His was an art that required
some cunning and imagination, however much it might be maligned by
people of artistic tastes. He roamed abroad, picking out the places
that were certain to catch the eye of the picnicker, the tourist,
and the ordinary traveller.</p>
<p>He missed no prominent spot that he could operate upon without
getting into trouble. Not merely on fences along the public
highway; not only on the cliff faces of bays and rivers, and the
rock outcrops on vacant allotments, but deep among the gorges and
tangled shrubbery that holiday-makers explored for wild flowers, he
imprinted imperishably the virtues of Sudd's Gorilla Soap. The
scenic resorts were spotted with his handiwork; the hills and
valleys were made to efface themselves and speak in loud capitals
of &quot;Quack's Rejuvenator for dead people;&quot; the flowers but
bloomed to form decorations for &quot;Lazey's infallible remedy for
tired husbands.&quot;</p>
<p>There was nothing so pleasing to the eye as ever-changing
landscapes; but the nature lover, however keen he might be on
variety, did not like his scenery to be mixed up with
&quot;Towser's Dog Tablets.&quot; He embraced the promised peace
and unsullied charm of rural hills and deep ravines; and
spectre-like in a lonely glen a rock suddenly appeared before him,
and warned him in huge, sprawling letters, to &quot;Beware of that
cough!&quot; A sister rock sought to calm his fears by advising him
to &quot;Take Killem's mixture for influenza.&quot;</p>
<p>He followed a narrow track that wound through dense vegetation
over a farther hill, which he began to imagine was still the abode
of the bounding wallaby, for the spot was remote and unfrequented;
and by-and-bye he came to a two-rail fence, the only sign of
civilisation, and on the top rail he read: &quot;Wear Tyle's
hats.&quot; It gave him a bit of a shock in such a retired spot. In
desperation he left the track, and plunged farther and farther into
the bush; and when he thought he had at last got away from the
peregrinating artist, he came upon a big, white log, upon which he
discovered this cheering inscription: &quot;Go to Diggam's for
funerals. Your relatives buried promptly and cheaply. Mourners
supplied at lowest rates.&quot;</p>
<p>The rock and fence-rail artist was not a man with soul so dead
that the natural beauties of his surroundings did not appeal to
him; he had a keen eye for nature's beauty spots. See how he picked
them out. Here was a point where trailing hardenbergia adorned a
rough rock with purple blooms, and at one side, grew a fine
Christmas bush that would blossom generously in the gayest holiday
season. He discerned at once that the eye of everyone who passed
along there would be attracted to that particular point. So down
went his tools, and he searched about for a prominent surface to
work upon. So pleased was he with the prospect that he took
observations from many points of view. Perhaps he would do some
pruning to improve on nature. Then he set to work with paint pot
and brushes; and thereafter visitors found the pretty floral corner
labelled, &quot;Bunion's plaster for aching corns.&quot; The spot
was ruined; the desecration made the nature lover yearn to consign
Bunion and his disgusting plaster to the bottom of the deep
sea.</p>
<p>But the artist smiled serenely, and went on his way. Here was a
peculiar rock formation, a wonderful pile heaped up by nature in
one of her most fantastic moods, that must certainly attract the
studious attention of all visitors. He spent the day at a notable
landmark like that, and when he had gone, it was a disfigured
monument to &quot;Bilge's distilled lightning for
biliousness.&quot; When he came upon a bit of wet road, or a patch
of swampy ground, he judged it a good place to make an impression;
and therefore every traveller who trudged through was mocked with
the legend, &quot;Leatherhead's Watertight Boots&quot; on either
side of him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the artist had gone to fresh fields. He was a
diligent explorer. He missed no opportunity. So the fisherman, no
matter where he went, by sea, river, or lake, was bound to see
&quot;Wriggler's Potted Worms for Bait&quot; at his elbow; and in
juxtaposition &quot;Use Hooker's Crooked Hooks.&quot; One of that
ilk, who was something of a sarcastic humorist, came upon an old
black horse grazing upon a quiet flat. The horse was very poor, and
no doubt the artist realised that the animal's days of active work
were over. Anyhow, he painted on one side of the derelict, in blue
letters, &quot;Use Knagg's Horse-Rugs,&quot; and across his
opposite ribs, in white, &quot;Bald head Hair Restorer.&quot;</p>
<p>The fathers of Vaucluse, in a day gone by, made a valiant
attempt to suppress the wandering painter. They thought no end of
their little suburb, and as zealously guarded its rights as a
doting mother did her first child. Parsley Bay, which is its
shipping port, so to speak, used to be a place where the Sydneyite
could bathe all day long without being in fancy dress; but the time
came when he could scarcely cough in that neighbourhood without
being asked if he had got a license to do so. The council
contemporaneously put its conjoint feet down heavily on the rock
and fence-rail artist. The man who wanted to advertise the merits
of &quot;Pickled Pills for Boiled People&quot; or direct public
attention to &quot;Sprouter's Moustache Invigorator,&quot; or
&quot;Slapdab's Patent Complexions,&quot; per aid of red and blue
paint and the suburb's natural resources, were shoo'd off the
premises with noise and despatch. When the despoiler did his fancy
work by night, the council followed in the morning, and with a
smile wrinkling round its cigar, drowned the glaring advertisements
with more paint. Unluckily, the method left a big splash here, and
a great smudge there, so that the suburb looked as if it had been
on a spree in a pigment factory.</p>
<p>All the same, it won public approbation by the effort it made to
jump on the rock and fence-rail artist. As the common desire was
that nature should wear her own complexion, that elusive person was
not one who could be conscientiously regarded as a benefactor to
mankind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br>
The Alderman and the Cow.</h2>
<p>Coming from the backblocks, we expected to find the metropolis
of the oldest State something better than a promiscuous cattle
ranch. We thought that stockriding, droving, and browsing herds
were unknown there; that Sydneyites had long ago lost sight of that
phase of Australian life. We were disillusioned.</p>
<p>It was soon forced upon our notice that several stock routes
traversed the residential centres. Sydenham road, one of the
busiest thoroughfares in the populous suburb of Marrickville, was
one. This we knew as the Long-Grey-road. Mobs of sheep passed along
almost every night. They travelled late, and down the road they
were heralded by a clatter on each side as windows were banged down
to keep out the dust they raised; whilst the shouting of the
drovers and the yapping of dogs woke up everybody who had got to
sleep. If the mob passed before 10 p.m., a crowd of street urchins
joyfully apprenticed themselves to the droving profession, and
raised more row and more dust than a gang of rouseabouts in a
drafting yard at shearing time. Sometimes the stock passings were
recorded in the small hours, when the reposing residents would be
wakened long before it was time to get up. In the bush the drover
was a quiet workman; but in the city droving seemed to be
impossible without the accompaniment of a tremendous lot of noise.
The cattle route exacted more than the mere sheep road. The
cattleman's motto seemed to be: &quot;We're awake; let's wake
everybody else.&quot;</p>
<p>The overseer knew Sydney fairly well, so we trusted to his
leadership whenever we wandered beyond the city lights. To show us
how well acquainted he was with the various suburbs, he took short
cuts across vacant allotments and through dark lanes to whatever
parts we particularly wanted him to go to. The short cuts proved
tiresomely long at times, and it caused the overseer to wear an
anxious expression, and to look about more sharply than usual, as
though he didn't want to miss anything that might be going on: but
he never admitted that he was lost.</p>
<p>In the course of these night rambles we became closely
acquainted with various herbiverous quadrupeds that formed a
considerable portion of the inhabitants of Sydney, and came to
memorise many un-notable places on the patchwork run. Visitors from
the city were wont to make humorous remarks about the livestock
that were allowed to stray on the footpaths and streets in country
towns; but the country town, we discovered, was not singular in
that respect. The docile cow and the overworked horse did not
browse in the streets in the city itself&mdash;that is, for a
radius of a mile or so round the G.P.O.; but in the suburbs the
straying animal was as rampant a nuisance as in any country town
that could be mentioned.</p>
<p>In unlighted and dimly-lighted thoroughfares one had to pick his
steps carefully, or take the risk of falling over a recumbent
beast, which gave no warning of its presence until the collision
happened, then leaped up with a suddenness that helped the biped to
execute an unpremeditated somersault. The overseer, being in front,
and looking about for familiar landmarks, collided more frequently
than anybody else; he kissed the pavement with so much violence
once or twice that his friends were ashamed to be seen with him for
a day or two afterwards.</p>
<p>Even the aldermen fell over the strays, and when an alderman
fell over a cow on the footpath, one would imagine that he would
take the earliest opportunity of having the bovine removed. But, as
the nuisance persisted, he evidently regarded falling over cows on
his way home from council meetings as a fine joke. A Bexley
alderman declared at one council meeting that he had bumped a cow
at night tethered to a picket fence. The animal was stretched
across the footpath.</p>
<p>&quot;A friend of mine,&quot; he added, &quot;going home one
night, ran into a young steer that showed fight. My friend tried to
frighten the animal from the footpath, but it charged. Had he not
been armed with a bottle of stout, there is no telling what may
have happened. As it was, he had to defend himself with the bottle,
and in the conflict broke it, but probably saved his
life.&quot;</p>
<p>A suspicious member of the council interjected something about
not being able to steer straight, and that remark indicated the
attitude of the average alderman towards the nuisance. The
incident, recalled an aldermanic discussion on a similar subject in
another municipality, in the course of which the following letter,
written by a Frenchman, was read&mdash;which showed that there were
some aldermen who shifted stock from the secrets at least, if the
animals died or threatened to die:</p>
<p class="letter">&quot;Your chairman he did instruct me to remove
and burn one old mare with cancer that had been lying on the road
for two days near the river crossing. I did walk four miles, and
find the mare as specified. She was nearly dead, but not yet. I
have a kind heart, which has caused me to lose much moneys in my
life. I did not like to burn the poor old creature while some
little wind was left in its insides, so I did hit him first, when,
presot! the old villain did stagger up on its front legs, and after
sitting up some time like a dog, did by-and-bye get up altogether
and walk away, and escape me, and I did lose my 15s. Now,
gentlemen, would you look kindly on the situation; my whole day did
lose, walk I did eight miles, my stick blow did remove the horse as
per instructed, but burn the old thing I could not. I could not
catch him.&quot;</p>
<p>Some suburbs, as on the northern side of the harbour, had a
partiality for goats. Large herds of them were spread over the
vacant spaces; you met them everywhere, either feeding on the paths
and the allotments or having a comfortable camp where you least
expected an obstacle. Some of them were so tame that they had to be
shoved out of the way, if there was no room to go round. The black
ones, lying prone on a grassy slope, were not easy to see at night;
and a man who speared headlong over one when jogging down hill with
an armful of groceries, might at least plead provocation for the
subsequent violence he displayed.</p>
<p>The goat was an intrusive quadruped. It pried round fences,
squeezing in or underneath wherever there was room to do so, and
slipping into the garden when the gate was left open for five
minutes, destroying the work of months before it was discovered. If
it got into the backyard it would make a meal of the baby's
nightdress, and the householder's white shirt just as readily as it
would crop the succulent herbage.</p>
<p>Other suburbs, like Enmore, Marrickville, and Dulwich Hill were
covered with cows. There were numerous dairies in these places,
each with enough cows to stock a selection. Nearly all of them were
pastured on the streets and vacant allotments. On rainy nights, and
when the flats were wet and muddy, they lay under the paling fences
and on the footpaths, because it was warmer and drier there. An old
lady in Marrickville was going home one night, holding a gingham in
front of her against a driving mist, when she stumbled over
somebody's over-quiet milker, and dived into the open gingham on
the other side of it. The gingham was wrecked, her best hat was
ruined, and her clothes covered with mud. She had no redress,
because she couldn't swear to the cow. Another lady in the same
neighbourhood, who had been enjoying a gossip round the corner, on
returning to her own house, discovered an old cart-horse in her
bedroom. She had left the front gate and the front door open; and
being used to stables, Bowler had mooched in, looking for a feed.
Luckily it was daytime; the discovery of a monster like that in the
bedroom at night would have been startling.</p>
<p>As a rule, the horses had better manners than cows and goats;
they didn't go to bed on the footpath; and if they happened to be
standing or feeding there when any one came along, they moved away
with heavy treads that could be heard to the end of the block. But
they reached over the front railings and clipped down the hedges,
ornamental trees, or whatever might be growing within reach. One
horse could do a tremendous amount of damage in a night in this
way. It was exasperating to see a man who had been trying to make
his home attractive to find one morning that his careful work of
months had been destroyed or seriously damaged by a straying horse.
This was not a matter to joke about, though to the ratepayer there
was a lot of humour in the spectacle of a policeman or a fat
alderman falling over a recumbent cow. It was only in that way that
the average alderman was brought to realise that animals straying
in the streets were apt to get in people's way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.<br>
Picnickers.</h2>
<p>It would be hard to find another place that possessed as many
picnic baskets, in proportion to population, as the city of Sydney.
Picnicking was a common way of holidaying all over the continent;
even in Centralia, when an outing was arranged among neighbours, it
merely took the form of a picnic by some waterhole, with games and
dancing on the grass for the young, and fishing and gossip for
those who were past the age of participation in active amusements;
but nowhere did you see such unanimity as in Sydney.</p>
<p>Despite the variety of entertainments provided, the picnic
basket was a conspicuous object on every holiday. You met it under
all manner of conditions, in the streets and on the less-frequented
roads; you found it dotting the greensward in parks and gardens;
you bumped it in trams and trains, in 'buses and boats; wherever
the eye wandered on holiday morning it encountered a hurrying
troop; and in that troop there was at least one who was burdened
with the bulging basket. The Sydney home that did not possess one
was an exception, and few were the inmates, whether rich or poor,
who did not wander forth with it in the sweet time when the buds
were bursting. In fact, it did not matter much what the season was;
they sallied forth in midwinter just the same as in spring and
summer; on dull, threatening days, as well as when the skies were
blue and the air was sweet and warm; they went out in the rain
gaily, trusting that it would clear up by-and-bye; and they trudged
through mud and water, and picnicked under any old cover available.
Even when the morning promised a flood, if the forecast in the
paper was &quot;fine,&quot; they pinned their faith to that, and
out they went, with the beloved basket, though ultimately, for want
of a dry spot, they might have to sit on it under an umbrella. To
them the call of the open was always in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The amount of exertion that was cheerfully expended in this
pleasure was prodigious. An onlooker, observing a perspiring person
struggling through a crowd with a weighty hamper, lugging it in and
out of impatient trams and trains; humping it to the top of 'buses
and down again, and looking after his following at the same time,
might imagine that one such experience would be quite enough for
any man in his right senses, especially as he was never rid of the
burden until he had carried it right home again. Doubtless he
called that basket lots of names that would not look well in print;
but he never seemed to swear off it altogether. The family vote
would be against him if he did.</p>
<p>This picnicking habit enabled hundreds of people to make a very
fair income by selling water. Every regular picnic resort had at
least one establishment where hot water was dispensed at about 3d a
quart, and billycans and teapots were loaned at their full value.
They sold water day and night, winter and summer; they sold it when
it was raining.</p>
<p>The streaming picnickers was one of the sights of suburban
Sydney to those whose turn it was to stay at home. They watched
from front windows and balconies as the crowds hurried along to the
trams and to railway stations; young couples with a little basket,
which said plainly that two's company; parties of young fellows and
merry girls, with fun and romance wrapped up in their bulging
loads; older couples with half a dozen youngsters in tow, like
steps and stairs; and companies of several families who were going
to picnic together. Men with baskets on their shoulders, in their
hands, and under their arms; and an odd one with the hamper on his
head, or slung on his back, marched strenuously with the jovial
precession; women and girls, flush faced and breathless, bustled
laboriously along with the universal luggage, carrying it alone or
in pairs, and putting it down frequently for a spell, but picking
it up again in a moment as though the missing of a certain
locomotive and having to wait for the next would be a calamitous
affair. Of course, it was annoying to the parties to have to wait
half an hour &quot;after busting ourselves hurrying,&quot; but that
was one of the humours of picnicking.</p>
<p>Everybody was gay; everybody was in good humour, and bubbling
over with benevolence and generosity. Old men felt quite young
again, and cheerfully helped strange girls with their loads; others
carried toddlers along for women they had never seen before.
Gallantry characterised the whole male section; they helped the
ladies into tram and train; they gave up their seats to them, and
found enjoyment in standing; and if they slightly bumped one
another in the crush, or stepped on one another's toes, they
apologised most politely. If one asked for a match, half a dozen
were eager to oblige him. Someone said, &quot;Have a cigar?&quot;
Another, seeing a man alongside about to fill his pipe, handed out
his tobacco pouch, and said: &quot;Try some of this.&quot; Nobody
was inconvenienced by being jambed in the crowd like a compressed
sardine; they laughed and cracked jokes about it.</p>
<p>The same spirit pervaded the children. They were excited and
joyous; they were so energetic and good-natured that they must
really carry something, and made brave attempts to carry burdens
twice too heavy for their years; they were so full of life and
merriment that they were racing and playing all the while their
hands were empty; and they were so eager to get to their
destination that the parents had frequently to call them back and
admonish them for going too far ahead. Above all, they were
prettily dressed, spotless, neat, bright and proud. That was in the
morning.</p>
<p>In the evening the watchers, who were now sitting on the front
verandahs or standing by the garden gates, saw quite a different
picture. It was the same stream of picnickers who went out so
merrily when the day was young, and yet the stream was different.
All the vivacity, gaiety and sprightliness was gone. There was
discontentment and insubordination in the ranks; nobody wanted to
carry the awful basket; and there were frequent complaints that it
was somebody else's turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Father&quot; was grumbling, too. He didn't know what
&quot;mother&quot; wanted to take crockery and tablecloths for when
they went picnicking&mdash;making a beast of burden of a man when
there was no necessity for it. She reminded him that she had
consulted him concerning what should be taken, and he had said:
&quot;Take what you like; it won't be much to carry;&quot; and now,
lessened by the weight of victuals and bottles, &quot;It is as
heavy to carry home as it was to carry out.&quot; And he was dead
weary, more tired than he had felt at any time through the week
after a hard day's work.</p>
<p>Children who had raced ahead in the morning were straggling far
behind, and there were frequent requests to &quot;Come on!&quot;
and &quot;Hurry up!&quot; intermingled with dark threats of
&quot;Wait till I get you home!&quot; Many were crying, some were
squabbling, odd ones were getting cuffed and shaken and scolded;
while clothes and hats spoke eloquently of the fine time the
wearers had been having.</p>
<p>The erstwhile gallantry and good humour had also suffered. The
man who gave up his seat to the old lady going out now made a
scramble to get there before her; and only reluctantly did he
surrender it, even to a woman with a child in her arms. If somebody
bumped against him he was apt to make disagreeable remarks; whilst
he was only tempted to assist the prettiest and most engaging girls
on their way home with their baskets. If one tried to borrow a
match he met only with sour looks. Some times he overheard somebody
mumble, &quot;Go and buy matches.&quot; The least crushing was
exasperating; the slightest hitch in the tram service roused a
general desire to lynch the Commissioner. The roads were a disgrace
to the council. The weather was beastly. The movement and bearing
of everybody bore testimony to the strenuousness of the
holiday.</p>
<p>But there was one section who returned as fresh and as merry and
as happy as they went out. These were the lovers, to whom
picnicking was a joy for ever; for whom the day sped all too
swiftly, and the way home was far too short.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.<br>
The Best Place to Live in When Hard Up.</h2>
<p>Is it better to be hard up in the city or hard up in the
country?</p>
<p>The question occurred when John Jovius Muggs began to read the
&quot;wanted&quot; columns of the daily papers, and the overseer
showed an interest in the cards in the windows of the registry
offices. The end of their holiday was being determined by financial
considerations.</p>
<p>No one would willingly be hard up anywhere; but as there are
more hard-up people than millionaires knocking around, it is a
question that exercises the minds of a good many at one time and
another, and it may be a satisfaction to some of them to have it
definitely settled. Often a man who is frying in the pan of poverty
remarks that he would shift his address if he could be sure that he
wasn't going to step out into the fire. There is a degree of
respectable poverty which the luckless one who bottoms it considers
the limit; he says to himself that things can't be worse, no matter
where he goes. There is another degree of poverty known as the
lowest ebb, as exemplified by the chronic dosser in Sydney Domain
and the sundowner in the bush. They never improve, and they can't
get worse&mdash;unless they change places. If the Domain dosser
were dumped down in a far back locality, where, the population has
so much room to breathe in that one house is lost sight of long
before the next comes into view, he would think he was faced with
bitter times indeed, in comparison with which the Domain, with its
seething life surroundings, would seem a place of joyous comfort;
whilst the sundowner, missing the hospitality and freedom of his
whilom haunts, would soon discover that he had not known before
what it was to be hard up. Neither of these persons has any
ambition beyond scraping up enough day by day to live on, and the
query propounded at the beginning of this dissertation has no
bearing on anybody who has no ambition.</p>
<p>It particularly concerns the married man who has a young family,
and who wants to do his best for them. Two such persons, we'll say,
are Theophilus Smith and Solomon Jones. Both are industrious, but
through no fault of their own have drifted into bad times. It is so
very easy to be come hard up&mdash;about the easiest thing I
know&mdash;that no plans and specifications are needed to show the
way. Smith belongs to the country, and the only time he would ever
think of visiting the city would be when he had plenty of money in
his pocket.</p>
<p>He uses no sweet adjectives in his description of the bush, and
is blind to the sublime beauties of all that is rural, when his
financial statement shows a deficit and there is no immediate
prospect of making an improvement. He promises himself all his life
through that when his fortune ship by some miraculous means arrives
at his door he will transplant himself in town, where he can see
something and enjoy life.</p>
<p>Meantime he considers the town the worst place on earth to be
hard up in. Nor does he speak without experience. He has sampled it
in past pleasure jaunts, when he invaded it in the Christmas and
Show seasons, and once, when he lost his money in the company of
some new acquaintances who had formerly resided in his district and
knew his father (grand old man his father was, too, when those
chaps knew him), he made the alarming discovery that meals and beds
weren't sold on the time payment system; nobody wanted to associate
with him if he hinted that he was &quot;broke;&quot; and whenever
he answered an advertisement for an able-bodied man of his
qualifications he found 49 other able-bodied men there before him.
He went to the registry offices, but none of them had a job for an
impecunious person. The humblest position demanded references and a
5s deposit, besides a guarantee that the first week's wages he
earned would be paid over to the agent. And Smith only wanted a
temporary job to earn enough to pay his fare back to the rustic
charms of the old homestead and the green splendours of the
everlasting bush. Those wide, lone spaces were alluring then; he
saw them as in a vision splendid; whilst the endless rows of brick
piles and the rushing traffic depressed him. He was an outcast in a
crowd, an exile in his own capital; lost and lonesome in the hub of
a continent. And that was a more hopeless feeling than ever came to
him in the most solitary parts of an unpeopled interior.</p>
<p>At last he exchanged his holiday clothes, including hat and
boots, for an old rig-out and a blanket, and with a fruit tin for a
billycan, a transformed Theophilus Smith set out for home on foot.
He had no dinner to start with, and no idea when it would be ready.
That only put him in a greater hurry to get out of town; to hit the
road where houses dwindle into mile posts; to propel himself into
the wide spaces where people are less plentiful and more thought
of. Scattered settlers at first did not rush forth and embrace him;
nobody showed any great pleasure at seeing him. The boosted
hospitality of a generous land wore a peculiar complexion in urban
and suburban areas; it was reserved for the well-to-do. Hospitality
in the bush is the real thing without trimmings; it takes no
account of the wayfarer's condition. Far on the outward track he
came upon a teamster's camp, and the teamsters greeted him
cheerily: &quot;Good day, mate. Come and have a feed.&quot;
By-and-bye he reached a settler's hut, and the settler said:
&quot;There's not much doin' just now; but I can give you a week's
grubbin', if you care to tackle that.&quot; He had arrived; and
thenceforth he had no fear of to-morrow.</p>
<p>Though Theophilus Smith has now a modest hut of his own, which
rears its unpretentious roof in the centre of a small selection, he
is still hard up, but under what he reckons much better
circumstances. The selection, being untilled and remote from butter
factories and saw mills, produces nothing that can be turned into
money; but it produces a lot that saves money. He has only to pick
up his wood and cart it home from the paddock, so that the homely
fire burns on, however bad the times are, and strikes in the coal
mines or on the wharves never worry him. If he has to cart his
water also, or even carry it in buckets from the creek, he has the
satisfaction of knowing that he has no water rates to pay, and can
use as much of the precious liquid as he feels inclined to carry.
Milk, butter, honey, jam, eggs, poultry, bacon, vegetables, fruit,
wild fowl and other game the small selection provides him with. In
the creek or lagoon he can catch fish; and in very bad seasons,
when ordinary meat goes up to famine prices, he can fall back on a
wallaby or a kangaroo. At a pinch he can kill old Strawberry. Of
timber he has more than he requires; he can burn his own bricks, if
he wants bricks; and he can roof his sheds with bark. If he's out
of work for a year at a stretch he won't starve, whilst there is
always plenty to do about the premises to keep him in healthy
exercise. Flour he has to buy always, unless he is extra energetic
and economical, when he may even grow, thrash and grind that for
himself. As the country storekeeper gives him at least three
months' credit, he prefers to buy flour, together with what little
clothes and sundries he requires in the leanest days that come his
way. His wife has to make her own bread and her own pies and
puddings and tarts; but, living in a clean atmosphere, with trees
and grass all around, instead of dusty streets and grime belching
chimney stacks, for this labour there is compensation in the
comparatively light house-cleaning.</p>
<p>Smith makes his 200lb. bag of flour hang out as long as
possible. Being an honest, law-abiding citizen, he reflects that he
ought to pay what he owes before running up another big account,
and to keep down expenses he draws freely on the selection's
natural resources. Its productiveness is merely a matter of will;
the fruition of Smith's activity. Potatoes, pumpkins, maize-meal,
arrowroot, and other homemade foods lengthen the life of the flour
bag, not only in season, but throughout the year, for they are
comestibles easily grown, easily made, and easily stored.</p>
<p>Though Smith lacks many of the conveniences that Jones considers
necessary to a comfortable existence, he has conveniences in other
ways that Jones is a stranger to. Jones belongs to the city. The
first upsetting knock he gets when hard times come is the
landlord's. The landlord comes on Monday morning; he comes every
Monday morning, and his face grows longer and longer as Jones
continues to find a new explanation as to why he hasn't got the
rent. Jones's resourcefulness in that respect is wonderful; but
there are no other resources about the premises&mdash;except the
furniture and that is not negotiable while the rent is unpaid. The
backyard grows only clothes lines, and the front flower-pot
develops nothing eatable.</p>
<p>Jones has to depend wholly on tradesmen, and the tradesmen can't
depend on Jones, so a deadlock is reached before his meditations on
the scarcity of jobs has got half way to an idea. The baker wants
his money, or he is apt to forget in three days where Jones lives;
the milkman presents his bill, and if it isn't promptly paid he
will be sure to run short of milk next day, and remain so
indefinitely; and the woodman must be remunerated on the spot or
the fire will go out. In desperation Jones might steal some of his
own fence, or boil the kettle with a picture-frame, or a
superfluous door. He can't shoulder his axe and go down the street
for a load of wood when he wants it. He can't do a hundred things
that are commonplaces to his friend Smith. Where it is an advantage
to the latter to be well known to business people, it is some times
a great disadvantage to Jones. The shopkeepers know when he is out
of work, and they know that he has nothing to fall back on, and no
securities. Credit is soon stopped everywhere. Perhaps the first to
stop his credit is the landlord, who gives him short notice to find
a new home. That is nearly as difficult as finding a billet, and
when he has succeeded in discovering a tenement in keeping with his
reduced circumstances he can't get a carrier to remove what is left
of his movable property without cash, and in the end he has to do
some heavy lumping in the starlight. In a week or two the new
landlord begins to look askance on his new tenant, and Jones in
consequence becomes addicted to moonlight flitting. Smith, on the
other hand, should he find himself turned out of house and home,
could shift on to an unsettled part of the creek, and stick up a
bark humpy to shelter the family until he had time to look
around.</p>
<p>Jones has not had the experience of the country that Smith has
of the city. If he had, he would find some means of getting on to
the land. With a little taste of it he would soon come to think
with Smith that it is better to be hard up in the bush than hard up
in the city.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Muggs and the overseer came to that conclusion
eventually. The registry office, when it came to be sampled, proved
to be a delusion and a snare. Good jobs were not plentiful, and
they went to the clients who could buy them. The man who hadn't a
bean, though he might have a big family, had no chance of getting
on the track of a crust through that medium. In desperation he had
often to tie himself to the pawnbroker before he could open
negotiations with the registry office.</p>
<p>For a pleasant billet at a wage of &pound;3 a week, and
warranted to last, as much as &pound;10 would be demanded; but hard
work, coupled with irregular hours, and carrying a minimum wage,
could be had at bargain rates. An assortment of such engagements
were always in stock; but prime work, like prime fruit, was scarce
and expensive. The character the boss had also much to do with
prices&mdash;often affecting rates more than the class of work or
its locality. An exacting boss was worth very little; a mean,
hard-driving boss, who was always on the watch, in the estimation
of would-be employees, wasn't worth picking up, but the
good-natured, fair-minded and considerate boss was rushed, and in
consequence of the spirited competition he always brought a high
figure. In most cases, however, the buyer was given no information
about the nature or quality of the goods until after he had bought
and paid for them. One victim paid &pound;3 10s for a job worth
&pound;4 10s a week&mdash;which was considered a cheap lot. Another
paid &pound;1 for a billet worth &pound;1 a week&mdash;and which
only ran to one week. A &pound;200 a year occupation for a married
couple (&quot;without encumbrance&quot;) changed hands for
&pound;7. Most job-hunters had to pay a registration fee of 5s
before their applications for any vacancy were considered; then
they had to buy the job in a bag, as it were, since they were not
enlightened as to its whereabouts or the identity of the employer
until the pride had been handed over, or an agreement signed that
the first week or fortnight or month's earnings were to be paid to
the office. Subsequently the purchaser might find that his purchase
was 300 miles away, and he had no means of connecting with it.</p>
<p>In the end Mr. Muggs and the overseer shaped their course for
Bourke, in company with a couple of droving pals they had met, who
were making back for the wide lands they knew, where no man was
asked to buy work, and where Jack was as good as his boss.</p>

<h2><a name="c42" id="c42"></a>CHAPTER XLII.<br>
&quot;Our Avenue.&quot;</h2>
<p>Sydney was the terminus of my pleasure trip. In the beginning of
my acquaintance with the city I became temporarily domiciled in an
unpretentious tenement in a narrow street in the vicinity of Hyde
Park. All narrow streets may not be the same; but a casual
inspection of a few others failed to discern any striking
difference. They are usually the foundation on which slum areas are
built. The narrower and more crooked the streets are the quicker
the place becomes a slum area.</p>
<p>The women called it 'Our Avenue,' because that sounded genteel.
I was told it was a quiet place, and that I would find life very
dull there. However, I found it quite exciting.</p>
<p>The front doors opened directly off the footpaths, and the
backyards were about the area covered by a whaler's tent. There was
generally a dilapidated paling fence between (when a previous
tenant hadn't used it for firewood), over the top of which the
gossip of the neighbourhood was ventilated. Dirty-looking,
ill-built places they were; damp and mouldy, rat-haunted and mouse
haunted, and clothed with cockroaches as with a garment. Beside
them, the average bush hut, which the town person sneered at, was
almost luxurious in its comforts. When there was not much room
inside there was plenty outside&mdash;miles of it; but in the
narrow street of Sydney there was little room inside and none
outside. And winter nights called back the ghosts of big bush
fireplaces and blazing logs, the circle of healthy, sun-browned
faces, the chatter and the yarning; while washing day brought
visions of long wire lines stretched between trees, where the
sheets flapped in the wind like thunderclaps. Then there were the
hunting and shooting and sugar-bagging&mdash;Ah, well! we couldn't
expect to find those things in &quot;Our Avenue.&quot;</p>
<p>In the mornings the women swept the footpaths, and did battle
with the short frocked sisters that chalked out hop-scotch grounds
there. The short-frocked sisters did it often for devilment. In the
case of an extra-irascible female, or one with whom they were
&quot;not friends,&quot; they chalked her door also, and smeared
her window&mdash;after watching her clean it; and now and again
they knocked and ran round the corner. At night time they tied
cotton to the knocker, and, seated on the opposite side, rap-tapped
gently every few minutes. They looked little dreams of innocence
when Mother Firelight came out and glanced up and down with murder
in her eye. Perhaps she would open the door three or four times
before she discovered the ruse. Then there was a shriek and a
stampede, followed by much vituperative language and fist-shaking
on the woman's part, and hilarious laughter from the
miscreants.</p>
<p>Between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, when bed-making was in
progress, a row of heads protruded from upstairs windows on each
side, and the owners talked in loud voices to their opposite
neighbours. The smallest items at any time brought these heads into
view&mdash;a tin whistle, a dog fight, the arrival of a piece of
furniture, and the removal of a tenant were matters of special
interest. They discussed one another and one another's business
freely; quizzed comers and goers and passers-by, and passed remarks
about them; and personal and sensational bits and scandal items
were caught up quickly and bandied from mouth to mouth to the end
of 'Our Avenue.&quot;</p>
<p>Each one knew what the other one had in her house, and how she
kept it, without going in. They watched the rent man on Monday
mornings, and noted who paid regularly and who was short; heads
popped out when a cart stopped at anyone's door, and the purchase
was noted and commented upon, if it was only a penn 'orth of apples
or a mouldy banana; they knew the carts from the time-payment
shops, and likewise the men who called from those places. The fact
that Mrs. Smith got her furniture in this way was a relishable item
to Mrs. Brown, who paid cash; and the information was
enthusiastically circulated, to Mrs. Smith 's disparagement. When
one bought a new hat or a new blouse it was known almost
immediately by the street, and all inspected and criticised it
(caustically) when the owner sported it for the first time, while
everyone endeavoured to find out what it cost. If they could
discover the shop where it was bought, several of them would go
there for no other reason than to price the hats or the blouses;
and if the lines were cheap the sneers of some of them would trip
up an elephant. They were a motley collection of people, who minded
everybody's business but their own.</p>
<p>The street was divided into cliques, and when a new tenant
arrived there was a keen competition for the favour of her smiles.
She was warned against &quot;that dreadful woman&quot; applied to
nearly everybody. If she was wise she lay low until she knew the
ropes. She soon learnt everybody's pedigree over the back fences
from the women on each side of her. When she had become recognised
as belonging to any one set, she at once became taboo with all the
others. Friendships were quickly formed, and as quickly turned to
hatred. One's neighbour might be a borrowing sort, who never had
anything; and if Next-door made an excuse when asked for the
washing-board or a few pegs or a saucepan, she was described behind
her back in language which would be an exaggeration if applied to
L. Borgia. The pair left off speaking, and passed each other in the
street in silent scorn. The feud was shared by the whole family
down to the baby, which poked its tongue out at the other baby.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Avenue&quot; could not have been eloquent if steam
trains rushed through it, and the German band and the blue-metal
roller lived there. The baby learned to crawl in its gutters, the
youth made love there; and day and night betweens of both sexes
were in noisy evidence, racing and howling, playing marbles and
rounders, and other games that seemed to demand incessant shouting
and argument. Cricket, with somebody's rubbish tin for wicket, held
possession in season; football was beloved by the adolescent and
the small boy, so the blown leather in its turn boomed delightfully
morning and evening, on moonlight nights, and all day on Sunday.
They followed the Bear-cum-Monkey war, too. They built forts in
mid-street with cases and tins, and bombarded each other with
stones, meat cans, and decayed boots, charged with brooms and
gridirons, and tore wildly round with flags made of dungarees, red
shirts and the dishcloth.</p>
<p>The thoroughfare was the common play ground. The children pretty
well lived there, and kept the women at daggers drawn with each
other. One youngster hit another, or tore its hat or its pinny;
then the mothers interfered, and embellished each other's names
with an assortment of choice adjectives; and occasionally the males
were drawn in, and &quot;The Avenue&quot; brought its collective
baby out to see the fun. Generally the tired head of the family was
only seen after tea, when he sat and smoked on the
doorstep&mdash;barefooted.</p>
<p>Saturday nights saw &quot;The Avenue&quot; at its best. Pushes
gathered here and there with &quot;constant screamers&quot; and
mouth organs and tin whistles, and jubilated till midnight. Late
hawkers, who &quot;wanted to sell out cheap and get home,&quot;
went rapping and bawling from door to door; and after bedtime, when
the community wanted to sleep, a couple of drunks staggering home
from the corner pub, would stop under the window and argue about
Rozhdestvensky and Togo, or the merits of the best cricket teams,
until something wet dropped down and drowned the barney. Then a
woman's shrieks broke out suddenly, mingled with cries of
&quot;murder!&quot; There was breaking of glass and furniture, bad
language, and a banging and thumping like a lost earthquake going
downstairs. A crowd gathered, and as a white-faced female got on to
the roof through the back window, they smashed more glass, and
broke the door in. Then the police appeared, and summary justice
was tripped up on the threshold.</p>
<p>But the street, was never very quiet, and it broke out violently
when least expected. Towards dawn, when the bushman's environment
is blissfully still, &quot;Our Avenue's&quot; cats fought in wild
spasms about the premises; the pup next door woke up and howled
with renewed vigour, cocks crowed enthusiastically in all
direction, and the man who had to go to work early started chopping
wood, falling over tubs and tins, banging things at large, and
talking loudly to nobody in particular. Then three or four
different milkmen began &quot;knocking the doors down&quot; and
bawling out &quot;Milk-o;&quot; and ere long the endless string of
hawkers began their noisy round again.</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve the whole population turned out into the
street, the youths lit bonfires in the roadway, and around them the
crowd saw the Old Year out and the New Year in, to the tooting and
screeching of trumpets, bugles,, whistles, mouth organs, and other
instruments of torture. The police scattered the fire, and the
crowd hooted them; when they departed the fire was made up again.
Sometimes the police made a dart after a ringleader, and the crowd
pretended to help by rushing in front to point him out, and got so
tangled up around the arm of the law that the culprit escaped. So
they could only look on until &quot;Our Avenue&quot; exhausted its
enthusiasm around the dying embers of its annual blaze. And I
looked on, too&mdash;for only a dead man could sleep&mdash;and
thought of old campfires in the great and glorious bush.</p>
