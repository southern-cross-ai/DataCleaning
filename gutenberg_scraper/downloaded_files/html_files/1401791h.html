  <h3>A STORY OF RUSSIAN PEASANT LIFE</h3>

  <p class="cp"><i><small>A capital tale of a simple Russian peasant,
     and how he met the Tsar.</small></i></p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Novel Magazine</i>, June 1915</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">PETER PETERVITCH* lived in a little hut by the side of the
  railway. His hair was fair and his beard was golden, and he had tired blue
  eyes that were filled with the weariness which comes to the eyes of men who
  have far horizons to scan. He wore a red shirt which flapped in the wind, and
  topboots of soft leather, and in the winter he had a big sheepskin coat with
  the woolly part worn inside and a fur hat. He did not wear the fur hat except
  furtively, for it had fallen from an open window of the train, and it was
  unusually valuable.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The correct form of this name is "Pyótr Petróvich."</p>

  <p>It marked the beginning of an ambition, the fur cap. Because it was very
  evident that if one fur cap could so fall, others also might be displaced by
  a puff of wind, or the accidental jogging of an elbow. And it might not be a
  fur cap, but a wallet filled with a hundred rouble notes, as&mdash;so legend
  said&mdash;such a wallet had fallen between Tomsk and Irkutsk.</p>

  <p>It had been seen by an officer of the railway, and the signalman had
  derived little benefit therefrom.</p>

  <p>Since the new well had been sunk at the back of the hut, however, no
  officer of the railway had ever come; once a week on a slow train there came
  an insulting clerk from Irkutsk to throw the weekly salary which
  Peter&rsquo;s post carried, and to demand when the old well would be bricked
  over&mdash;a task they had set the indolent Peter.</p>

  <p>Peter Petervitch was in his hut drinking tea and eating his midday meal of
  black bread and sausage, when far away he heard the shriek of an engine.</p>

  <p>He wiped his beard with his red shirt sleeve and took down the green flag
  which hung on two hooks under the lithograph of the Tsar.</p>

  <p>He crossed himself before the gaudy little ikon near the door, and went
  out to do his duty.</p>

  <p>The line was a straight ribbon of steel, stretching from cast to west. It
  crossed a flat and featureless desert, and there was nothing to obstruct the
  view from horizon to horizon.</p>

  <p>Somewhere to the westward, where the two parallels of steel rail met in a
  quivering heat mist, he saw the black speck of the onrushing express. A
  <i>verst</i>* away a tiny figure of a man stood with a green flag before a
  little white hut&mdash;another atom of humanity.</p>

  <p class="footnote">Russian: &#1074;&#1077;&#1088;&#1089;&#1090;, an obsolete
  unit of measurement equal to 3,500 feet or 1,067 meters)</p>

  <p>Peter glanced eastward. Between his post and the next the line was clear.
  He unfolded his green flag and solemnly extended it.</p>

  <p>The express went roaring past.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Whr-r-r-r-r!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was one saloon of unusual colour and size.</p>

  <p>It was pure white, magnificently proportioned, and the big windows were
  very big.</p>

  <p>Peter saw a child by an open window. He caught a glimpse of her fair young
  face, saw, in a flash, the smile on her lips as she talked over her shoulder
  with an officer who stood behind her. Then the train was gone.</p>

  <p>He looked long and earnestly at the disappearing rear carriage, its
  outlines obscured by the cloud of dust which chased it madly, refolded his
  flag and mechanically threw a glance along the side of the ballasted
  road.</p>

  <p>There was no fur cap, no wallet&mdash;nothing.</p>

  <p>Nothing? Peter walked slowly along the railside. He stooped and picked up
  a handkerchief.</p>

  <p>It was a dainty affair, all lace and fine cambric, and as he turned it
  over with his big strong hands, there rose to his nostrils a faint and
  beautiful fragrance.</p>

  <p>Peter sniffed at it, inhaled the delicate loveliness of it. There was a
  design worked in one corner. A design incomprehensible to Peter. It was a
  raised design, and had eagles and lions and swords, and such things.</p>

  <p>Peter had seen handkerchiefs before, in the big stores at Irkutsk. But
  then you may see everything at Irkutsk because it is the most wonderful city
  in the world, and has electric light and beautiful churches, and people wear
  white shirts&mdash;even common people. But never before had he seen such a
  thing as this.</p>

  <p>He was embarrassed more than a little with his find. A fur cap you may
  wear on holy days. A wallet full of hundred rouble notes can be spent at
  Irkutsk, though God knows a hundred roubles is a great deal of money, and
  would require some ingenuity to spend! But a spider-web of cambric, with
  edgings of something as unsubstantial as smoke. Peter shook his head in
  perplexity and carried the wonder into his cabin.</p>

  <p>Beneath the ikon was a little niche where a candle may stand and did stand
  when candles were plentiful. Peter cleaned the niche of grease, placed the
  handkerchief in its place, made the sign of the cross twice, and said,
  &ldquo;Christ have mercy!&rdquo; Then he went back to his tea, his sausage
  and his thoughts. He was not a great thinker. His mind moved
  slowly&mdash;like one of those big-wheeled <i>tarantass</i>* that carry
  country people in summer-time, across the bad roads of Siberia. He was
  elementary and naturally indolent, the scope of his mentality was bound by
  the deeps of hunger and the supreme height to which a man rises who gets
  drunk on beer.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Russian:
  &#1090;&#1072;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1090;&#1072;&#1089;, a four-wheeled
  horse-drawn vehicle on a long longitudinal frame, reducing road jolting on
  long-distance travel. It was widely used in Russia in the first half of the
  19th century. It generally carried four passengers. (<i>Wikipedia</i>).</p>

  <p>Considering the matter for three days he came to the conclusion that the
  handkerchief was suitably employed as an object of offering.</p>

  <p>Summer passed and the winter came, and with winter he wore two
  <i>shubas,</i>* a sheepskin hat, and the fingerless gloves which a paternal
  government supplied.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Russian: &#1096;&#1091;&#1073;&#1072;, a fur coat.</p>

  <p>Day by day he would stand in the biting blast to pass the trains eastward
  or westward, and six times a week he would search the line for the jettison
  of the Trans-Siberian express.</p>

  <p>The winter went, the spring came, and Peter, shedding his <i>shubas</i>
  cautiously, came by easy stages to the red shirt and the soft leather boots
  of summer.</p>

  <p>He had a brother, one Andrew, who had worked at Irkutsk for a skin
  merchant and earned seven roubles a week, which is about fourteen shillings,
  and is good pay. But Andrew was at once a source of sorrow and pride to the
  good Peter, for this town-haunting brother was a Socialist in his sluggish
  way, and did not believe in God. Else how could a man calmly relinquish so
  excellent a position as chief porter to a skin merchant and go wandering to
  the unknown cities of the west&mdash;to Moscow, even as far north as
  Riga?</p>

  <p>From time to time letters came to Peter&mdash;bombastic letters. Andrew
  was prosperous. He wore white linen, and he had gone so far in his
  magnificence to promise that some day he would send Peter a five-rouble note.
  Beyond that he did not go.</p>

  <p>Peter, saying his prayers before the little ikon, often prayed that the
  five-rouble note would come along, and when he had crossed himself he would
  touch the handkerchief for luck. The wisp of linen had grown somewhat grimy
  from overmuch touching, but the scent, which was peculiarly its very own,
  still clung about it when the adventure came to Peter.</p>

  <p>He had just finished his frugal ablutions and had given &ldquo;all
  clear&rdquo; to a slow passenger train when he saw a fast <i>tarantass</i>
  being driven along the rough road which bordered the line. It was coming
  towards him, bumping and jolting over the uneven surface, and Peter took off
  his hat and quaked a little, fearing that this might be an official of the
  line.</p>

  <p>The steaming horses were pulled up with a jerk a dozen yards from the
  cabin, and a gentleman stepped down.</p>

  <p>He wore red boots up to his knees, and his clothes were of velveteen, and
  Peter, who knew he was no representative of Government because he was
  innocent of uniform, thought possibly that this was the millionaire who had
  lost the fur cap, and quaked again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peter Petervitch!&rdquo; roared the newcomer in a boisterous voice.
  &ldquo;Come and kiss me, for I am your brother!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And indeed it was!</p>

  <p>Peter ran forward and took the man in his arms, kissing him on both
  cheeks, on the forehead and on the chin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;You are a rich man, as I
  see. Now I am glad, for you will give me the five-rouble note which you
  promised me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed again as the other led the way into the hut. He laughed
  long and readily, as a stoutish man with a red face will laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall have a sackful of five-rouble notes, my little
  brother,&rdquo; he said, patting Peter upon the back, &ldquo;for I have come
  to make you rich.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They sat down together and ate. Though Peter had had one breakfast, he
  found no difficulty in eating another, for he had never eaten a satisfying
  meal in his economical life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Andrew as he dived into his pocket and produced a
  handful of cigarettes, &ldquo;we will talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled his cheerful contempt of his brother as Peter said his devotions
  to the ikon behind the door&mdash;those devotions which invariably follow
  every meal in the peasant&rsquo;s hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Gospodi pomiluj!</i>&rdquo; sneered Andrew. &ldquo;Lord have
  mercy on you! Whilst you pray, fat hogs feed on your richest food. I think
  you are a fool. What is that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pointed to the soiled little handkerchief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is a blessed object which came to me,&rdquo; said Peter
  gravely, &ldquo;from a little child who had a face like an angel. It is
  scented with the incense of God.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Andrew clicked his lips impatiently, then he laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down, O saint,&rdquo; he said ironically, &ldquo;and I will
  give you incense which smells sweeter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He thrust his hand into an inside pocket and drew forth a thick bunch of
  banknotes.</p>

  <p>He laid them out on the table one by one, till they covered its surface.
  They were five-rouble notes, and there were many&mdash;so many that in places
  they lay two, one upon the other.</p>

  <p>Peter gasped in silence at the display of wealth, and when Andrew stood on
  one side with the triumphant gesture of a showman. Petervitch came forward
  fearfully, touching the notes gingerly with his fingers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;praise be to God, for
  you are a rich man!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Andrew looked at him as his fingers moved from note to note, and a little
  smile trembled at the corner of his mouth, for there was little more than
  five hundred roubles on the table, and Andrew had been given two thousand to
  accomplish the work.</p>

  <p>He went to the door of the hut, opened it, and looked out. There was no
  soul in sight save the driver of the <i>tarantass.</i> He shut the door and
  came back into, the hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; he asked in a low voice, &ldquo;do you ever think
  about Russia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Peter stroked his golden beard and looked at the other in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God save you, Andrew,&rdquo; he said in amazement, &ldquo;why
  should I think about Russia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think of the devils who torture men and women?&rdquo; asked
  Andrew, with simulated ferocity, for Peter did not inspire the natural
  zealous flow of wrath which is rightly the accompaniment to such a
  proposition as he had to make.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard of the <i>domovýe</i>,&rdquo;* Peter answered
  dubiously, &ldquo;and also of the <i>rusálki</i>,&dagger; those beautiful
  maidens who wait by the lakes and tickle girls to death, also the
  <i>vedni</i>&Dagger; who milk cows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Russian:
  &#1076;&#1086;&#1084;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;&#1077;, pl., spirits of the
  hearth, brownie-like fairies.<br>
  &dagger; Russian: &#1088;&#1091;&#1089;&#1072;&#1083;&#1082;&#1080; pl.,
  spirits of the rivers and lakes.<br>
  &Dagger; <i>vedni</i> (sic). Wallace may have meant <i>vodyány</i> (Russian:
  &#1074;&#1086;&#1076;&#1103;&#1085;&#1099;&#1081;), the fairy king of
  waterways, or, perhaps <i>ved'mý</i> (Russian:
  &#1074;&#1077;&#1076;&#x44c;&#1084;&#1099;), witches.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a fool, Peter,&rdquo; said his brother, struggling to
  preserve a straight face. He could not afford to laugh in view of the
  seriousness of his mission. &ldquo;You are just a brute fool, Peter,&rdquo;
  he went on vigorously, &ldquo;as thousands of others of your kind
  are&mdash;content to sit and suffer and watch these other and stronger brutes
  trample over you, and oppress your women and your children.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God save you!&rdquo; gasped Peter in consternation. &ldquo;He who
  told you I had a woman or children has lied!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Andrew wrung his hands helplessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can I do with this fool?&rdquo; he muttered. Then: &ldquo;I am
  not speaking of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but of the men you know. Listen
  to me. Would you like your brother to be a happy man?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know that I would, Andrew,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;so why do
  you ask?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you like yourself to be rich and to ride in fine carriages
  and to wear cloth coats and sleep in beds with sheets?&rdquo; Peter had no
  desire to sleep in beds with sheets; he had once tried the experiment in a
  reckless moment, and had never ceased to regret the chill contracted on that
  occasion.</p>

  <p>But his brother went on:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are near Heaven, Peter. In a few months Russia will be free of
  the yoke which is round her neck. We will terrify these masters of ours so
  that they will give us what we ask. And you&rdquo;&mdash;he slapped the other
  on the shoulder with his heavy hand, and stepped back with a look of
  admiration upon his face&mdash;&ldquo;you shall free us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall free you?&rdquo; said Peter in bewilderment. &ldquo;Now you
  are talking madness, my brother. I know nothing of what you mean. How can I
  help you&mdash;you who are so rich and have so many friends?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; Andrew caught him by the arm and dragged him to a
  stove by his side.</p>

  <p>He spoke concisely and earnestly, and Peter listened; at first
  uncomprehending the trend of the other&rsquo;s speech. Then, as it slowly
  dawned upon his dull mind, he rose with a gasp of horror, and his face went
  white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Wreck the train of our holy
  master! Andrew, you are mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout!&rdquo; hissed the other. &ldquo;Do you want the
  whole of the world to know what we are talking about? You have got to do it,
  do you hear? If you don&rsquo;t I shall lose my life. I have sworn to my
  society to carry out its orders, and if I fail my comrades will kill me. You
  have to decide whether the life of your own brother or the life of the Tsar
  is more precious to you. To-morrow there will come news to you that the
  imperial train is going to Tomsk. The Tsar remains for the great festival and
  then returns. Nothing is to be done until the return journey. I will arrange
  everything, Peter; you need do no more than wave your green flag. I will have
  a fast <i>tarantass</i> ready to take you off, and you shall be kept in a
  small village until the matter is forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was an airy proposition that Andrew Petervitch put before his
  brother&mdash;condemning him to death as he did knowingly and without
  remorse, that he himself might benefit to the extent of a few thousand
  roubles. Peter&rsquo;s detection was sure. Andrew himself might reasonably
  hope to escape in the confusion, if indeed he had not prepared a way for
  himself before the catastrophe. A few sticks of dynamite on the line could be
  carefully timed, might even be fired from a safe distance; the slow-willed
  Peter could either fly or wait and take his chance.</p>

  <p>Peter listened as the plan was unfolded&mdash;listened with bulging eyes
  and ashen cheek, hypnotised by the plausibility of the other, scarcely
  understanding one half that was said save that he was called upon to commit a
  deed which was more dreadful than Peter in his wildest moments had imagined.
  He had thought at times, when the dull monotony of his life had driven him to
  mild desperation, of terrible crimes which he might commit, such as striking
  the clerk of the Irkutsk Station who was so rude to him, or making faces at
  the occupants of the slow-moving passenger trains, or even&mdash;the very
  thought left him breathless!&mdash;of setting fire to his hut one deadly day
  when the monotony of his loneliness had almost driven him mad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is one life?&rdquo; argued Andrew. &ldquo;And what is one
  man&rsquo;s life more than another?&rdquo; He did not explain by what miracle
  the outrage would destroy only the life he sought. &ldquo;Some day there will
  come to you the knowledge&mdash;the great knowledge that the killing of a man
  is nothing!&rdquo; He waved his large hands in contempt. &ldquo;That day will
  come soon, and you will only be proud of your work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Peter listened in silence to his brother&rsquo;s hearty farewell, and
  watched the <i>tarantass</i> as it jerked its way over the lumpy road to the
  distant flat line of the horizon. Then he went back to his hut and prayed. He
  made no reference in his prayers to the awful proposal which had been made;
  he felt it was not a moment to take God into his confidence until he himself
  had a clear idea as to what it was all about, and his fingers rested a little
  longer upon the cambric in the niche. He strove with greater earnestness,
  holding the little gossamer near his nose to catch the perfume. Then he went
  back to his work at the well&mdash;work he hated because it was unjust that
  he, a signalman, should be called upon to perform the labour of other and
  higher paid men.</p>

  <p>All night long he lay awake thinking.</p>

  <p>At dawn there came a light engine carrying an official of the line even as
  Andrew had predicted. A loud-mouthed, noisy, bullying official, none other
  than that objectionable clerk from Irkutsk Station, who gave him certain
  instructions about a mysterious train which would pass at noon. It was a
  train of the highest and the greatest importance, this much the clerk
  impressed upon him, calling him pig and fool, and little bear to point out
  the importance. And Peter listened, nodding his head, and the engine went
  speeding down the section to the next section-house, where it halted to
  repeat the instructions.</p>

  <p>Peter was more than ordinarily careful with his ablutions that morning; he
  washed himself with great thoroughness, and took from the little box beneath
  his bed a blue blouse, washed and rough dried, but of a more brilliant blue
  than any of its fellows. He even combed his beard, and used the
  broken-toothed instrument to bring some kind of order to his tangled hair.
  One thing was certain, the Tsar was coming&mdash;that great and God-like man,
  his master and the master of all the world by Peter&rsquo;s reckoning, for he
  took no notice of the lies which were told, doubtless by interested people,
  that outside of Russia existed other territories dominated by other and less
  luminous Tsars.</p>

  <p>As the hour got nearer he became more and more agitated. The day was a
  blazing one, the heat stifling and overpowering. Everything he touched that
  had been exposed to the sunlight was blisteringly hot, the whole landscape
  shimmered in a heat mist, and on the far horizon a dazzled brown mirage
  offered the illusory promise of shady trees and cool lakes.</p>

  <p>Sometimes during a period of exceptional heat the sun would expand the
  rails to such an extent as to throw them out of the true. It was part of
  Peter&rsquo;s duty to make a careful examination half-way as far as the next
  section-house once a day.</p>

  <p>An hour before the Imperial special was due he walked along in the
  scorching sunlight, his eyes fixed solemnly upon the twin grey rails. There
  had been an expansion; you could not put an edge of paper between the place
  where rail met rail. He had walked two hundred yards when he stopped. It
  seemed even to his unobservant eye that there was a distinct warp in one
  line. For the purpose of making his rough calculation he carried a piece of
  knotted string in his pocket, and with this clumsy apparatus he took
  laborious measurements and gasped.</p>

  <p>For the first time since he had been in the employ of the railway company
  he had made a discovery which carried with it a reward of five roubles. Yes,
  here it was, two inches out of the true in one place&mdash;almost three
  inches in another!</p>

  <p>He crammed his string in his pocket and went running back along the
  permanent way to his hut. He was distracted; he could not think what was the
  right thing to be done under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>All that he knew was that the Tsar was coming in his wonderful train, and
  that he must be there at his hut to signal him past. But now? It never
  occurred to him, strangely enough, that the bulging rail was quite sufficient
  to throw the train off the line and bring the disaster by accident which his
  brother had planned should come through design.</p>

  <p>He started walking to the next section to warn Ivan Menshikoff, the
  signaller. Then, in a panic, he realised that Imperial trains are notoriously
  unpunctual, and that bullying, brow-beating clerks from the Irkutsk Station
  might tell him a lie purposely deceiving him for the better safety of the
  Tsar. With this in his mind he ran hastily back to his hut, an uncomfortable
  figure, his face wet with perspiration. It was fortunate that his brother had
  not visited him that morning, and that he had nothing to distract him from
  his duty.</p>

  <p>Then his heart suddenly came into his mouth. Far away on the west horizon
  was a blur of smoke. There would be no whistling, since this was a special
  train. The blob of dun-coloured smoke was all the warning an alert signaller
  required. He went hurriedly into his hut and came out again with his red
  flag. Of course, this was the proper course. It was a source of satisfaction
  that he had thought out this duty of arresting the progress of the Imperial
  special.</p>

  <p>He lifted his flag, the flag that he had never had to use since the day of
  his appointment, unrolled it proudly, and stood at the door. He was probably
  the only signalman on the line that had had to show the red flag to the
  Imperial special.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer came the train. A fear assailed Peter that the driver
  would not see him, and he waved the red flag frantically at a time when the
  driver could not possibly have seen him without the aid of a telescope.
  Nearer and nearer it came, and then with a sudden grinding of brakes the
  Imperial train jarred to a standstill, the engine less than fifty yards from
  the danger point, the great white saloon immediately opposite Peter&rsquo;s
  hut.</p>

  <p>He stood there, his fur hat clutched in his hand, looking humbly, almost
  devotedly at the spotless car. He saw faces at the window and then he gasped,
  for one of the faces was that of a girl&mdash;the girl whom he had seen on
  the day he found the handkerchief. He had no time to speculate on this
  matter, for a uniformed officer, springing down the steps of the saloon, ran
  towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; he asked curtly.</p>

  <p>Peter tried to speak, but could find no words, he was overcome at this
  tremendous moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak, fool!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gently, general!&rdquo; said a voice.</p>

  <p>The officer swung round with his hand at the salute, and stood rigidly
  facing the open window, which had been noiselessly lowered.</p>

  <p>Peter looked up and saw a good-natured man with a little peaked beard, who
  turned his smiling eyes to the signalman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is wrong, my friend?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Little father,&rdquo; stammered Peter, &ldquo;the sun has opened
  the rails. God forgive me for delaying the holy Tsar, but when the rails are
  open I must stop the train, and if your excellency looks upon the face of the
  Tsar let him know that I did this because it is my duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a very long speech for Peter.</p>

  <p>The kindly eyes were not moved from his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am the Tsar,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God have mercy on us!&rdquo; gasped Peter, and fell on his
  knees.</p>

  <p>He was still dazed when the little party descended from the saloon whilst
  mechanics were putting the rails straight&mdash;not a matter that required
  any great waste of time&mdash;dazed when the Tsar and the beautiful girl
  walked along the permanent way and stood before his hut.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do you live here always?&rdquo; asked the Tsar.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded; he had no words.</p>

  <p>The Tsar slipped into the hut and looked round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very clean,&rdquo; he said, as indeed it was, for
  Peter&rsquo;s usual shyness of soap and water did not extend to his
  habitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked the Tsar in surprise. He crossed himself
  before the ikon as Peter might have done, and, reaching out his hand, touched
  the little handkerchief. He lifted it from its niche and examined it
  curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is yours, Vera.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl took it with a little frown of surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that is mine, papa,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look, there is my
  crest.&rdquo; She pointed to the embroidery in the corner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I found it!&rdquo; blurted out Peter in terror. &ldquo;Little
  father, it was by the side of the line, and I did not know that I was doing
  wrong, but it seemed so beautiful a thing that I placed it here and said
  nothing to any man, worshipping it because of the angel who had dropped
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Tsar threw back his head with a laugh, and turned to the officer
  behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See that this man receives a thousand roubles,&rdquo; he said
  shortly. &ldquo;And he may keep the handkerchief, may he not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl smiled on Peter, and handed the precious relic into his
  hands.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Peter Petervitch stood, a confused and wondering man
  watching the disappearing train.</p>

  <p>He with his own hand had touched the Tsar, had felt the warm grip of his
  fingers in a handshake. It was unthinkable, unbelievable! He was still in his
  maze when his jovial brother came, this time on a bicycle, for he wanted no
  evidence to accumulate against him.</p>

  <p>The bicycle was a strange machine to Peter. He regarded it with a frown as
  partaking in some degree of his brother&rsquo;s revolutionary character.</p>

  <p>Peter was engaged for the moment in drawing water from the new
  well&mdash;the well which had been sunk by the Government for his
  use&mdash;in order to mix the mortar with which to cover the old condemned
  well from whence he had drawn his supplies and from which incidentally his
  hapless predecessor on the section had met his death in the form of typhoid
  fever. Peter was in his red shirt, perspiring but immensely happy, singing in
  his great unmusical voice nothing more modern than an old folk-song he had
  learned at school.</p>

  <p>Andrew dismounted from his bicycle and clapped the other on the shoulder.
  They kissed one another solemnly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now come to the hut,&rdquo; said Andrew, &ldquo;and tell me all
  your thoughts, my brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no thoughts,&rdquo; said Peter meekly. &ldquo;But many
  wonderful things have happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other frowned. He looked round; there was no one in sight. Even the
  signalmen in the distant huts had retired to their midday meal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Peter Petervitch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will do
  what I ask and make me a happy man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you ask?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That you let me lay a mine on the rail.&rdquo; The other put it
  bluntly. &ldquo;That is all. That you do not fire your gun or make an alarm,
  and that you go before the train comes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not do this thing,&rdquo; said Peter simply.</p>

  <p>He was standing by the old well and, lifting a lump of stone, he dropped
  it over the edge, and stood listening until a faint splash below told that it
  had reached the water. He was more interested in his work than his brother
  apparently, and the red-faced man grew almost purple in his rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Do you wish to see your brother
  dead or the Tsar dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would rather see you dead,&rdquo; said Peter calmly after a
  moment&rsquo;s thought. And, stooping, he mixed water and lime with his
  curious bowl-shaped trowel.</p>

  <p>Andrew looked at the man and a slow, cunning smile dawned on his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you do not help you are ruined,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I
  will go away and denounce you to the police.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was a contingency upon which Peter had not speculated. To the police!
  And the news would go to the Tsar, and perhaps the little lady would want her
  handkerchief back from so unworthy a servant, who had listened to schemes for
  the destruction of her father.</p>

  <p>He went pale at the thought. That he would also lose a thousand roubles
  did not distress him, because a thousand roubles was beyond his immediate
  comprehension.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will do this?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said the other heartily. &ldquo;Now which do you
  choose&mdash;my death or the Tsar&rsquo;s? Come, little brother, has not the
  day dawned when you see life as nothing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With surprising quickness for a man so lethargic Peter&rsquo;s hand shot
  out. A steel-like grip grasped the city-wasted Andrew by the throat and flung
  him round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your death, my brother,&rdquo; murmured Peter, &ldquo;go with
  God!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He threw his weight forward, and, exercising the whole of his strength, he
  lifted the man bodily and flung him over the black edge of the well.</p>

  <p>A despairing shriek came up as the man fell; a pause and a splash of
  water, and then silence.</p>

  <p>Peter walked slowly to where the bicycle lay upon the ground, picked it up
  gingerly, and threw it down after the man. Then he went to work mixing mortar
  and carrying stones to cover over this place of death. And all the time he
  worked he whistled a tuneless song, for the possibilities of a thousand
  roubles was only at that moment dawning in his sluggish brain.</p>
