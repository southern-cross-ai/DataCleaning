  <h3>Published posthumously in the syndicated<br>
  Sunday newspaper supplement, <i>This Week</i> (USA), November 21, 1948</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">IT was a big day when Rudy Zandor consented to dine with me
  at Chasen's because those were the years when he was astonishing Hollywood
  with a series of super productions. He was another Sampson whose strength lay
  not in his long hair but in his perfect self-confidence.</p>

  <p>The country he loved, the flag followed, the God he worshiped was Rudy
  Zandor. So I put in the whole day working on my plot and reached the
  restaurant rather full of hope.</p>

  <p>Zandor was hardly an hour later, which seemed a good sign, and then he
  came in with a yes-man named Gregg and Jimmy Jones, whose real name is
  Jonascsky, Zandor raised quite a buzz with his entrance because he always
  dressed for public appearances. This time he wore corduroy trousers, a riding
  coat buttoned high around the throat, and four days' whiskers. His friends
  were in dinner jackets for contrast.</p>

  <p>Rudy was almost at my table when another murmur started. All eyes left
  him, and in came Raymond Vincent Etherton in his black coat and white stock
  like an eighteenth century ghost. It was rather hard on Zandor to have his
  entrance messed up like that, for he was completely forgotten as the old man
  went by, looking straight ahead and failing to see the people who spoke to
  him. He went to his usual corner, waited for his coffee and cognac, and
  contemplated the dignity of space.</p>

  <p>When Dave Chasen in person brought the brandy, Etherton became gently and
  kindly aware of him, for he was really abstracted, not merely high-hat.
  Thirty years before, when he consented to be King Arthur for D.W. Griffith,
  he must have been a glorious man.</p>

  <p>Some of the glory hung about him as Henri Quatre in <i>Ivry</i> or as
Richard
  the Lion-Hearted in <i>The Talisman</i>.
  He never was cast except as a king and he
  moved through his parts without the slightest acting, merely lending his
  presence, as it were. The whisper had it that there <i>was</i> a dash of real
  royalty in his blood but no one even in Hollywood dared to suggest the
  bar-sinister to Etherton.</p>

  <p>Even Hollywood was surprised by the appearance of such a man on the
  screen. He was more a rare legend than a fact. That was why Chasen's buzzed
  so this evening.</p>

  <p>Zandor, in eclipse, looked pretty sour.</p>

  <p>"That man," he said, pointing at Etherton. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy Jones winked at me. It was the yes-man who gave the answer. A
  celebrity in Hollywood can't help accumulating them as the northside of a
  tree gathers moss.</p>

  <p>"That's Raymond Vincent Etherton," said Gregg.</p>

  <p>"I want him. He has a hungry look. I want him to play Shylock," said
  Zandor.</p>

  <p>"The 'Merchant of Venice' after the big western?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Before," said Zandor. "I'm not doing the western."</p>

  <p>My hopes went crash; and at the same moment I heard Gregg ordering
  caviar.</p>

  <p>Jimmy said: "You can't buy an Etherton, Rudy. He doesn't need money, but
  he acts now and then to raise the level of the screen and show the world what
  royalty should be."</p>

  <p>Zandor waved his hand at Jones. "You bother me," he said. "Go away."</p>

  <p>Jimmy Jones went away.</p>

  <p>"Now get Etherton. Offer him seventy-five thousand," directed Zandor.</p>

  <p>His Number Two boy went over to Etherton and I felt a little sick about
  Zandor and about myself for being with him.</p>

  <p>Etherton was sipping his brandy when the yes-man leaned over his table and
  started talking. The old fellow showed no sign that he heard a syllable.
  Presently he laid a bill on the table, stood up, and walked through the
  Number Two boy as though the fellow were a thin mist. He passed out of
  Chasen's and Gregg came back to Zandor, astonished.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could stop him&mdash;not even <i>your</i> name, Rudy," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you raise the bid?" asked Zandor, furious.
  "I don't care what sort of blood he has in him; <i>nobody</i> walks out on
  me. Why didn't you offer him one hundred thousand?"</p>

  <p>"But I didn't have the authority," said the yes-man.</p>

  <p>Zandor looked him over from his chin to the sleek of his hair and turned
  his shoulder; it was plain that there was one parasite less in his life.</p>

  <p>It was a rotten dinner. I tried to be bright for a while but gave it up
  after Zandor had snarled a few times. The great man was preoccupied. In the
  middle of his chicken <i>cacciatore</i> he jumped up and left the tableware
  jingling.</p>

  <p>"Show me where this Etherton lives," he commanded.</p>

  <p>I paid the bill and took him to Etherton's house&mdash;small, sedate,
  withdrawn from the vulgar world behind a formal Italian garden. The
  California moon, for we have a special variety out here, was laying cool
  silver over everything and the fountain statue left a perfect shadow on the
  pool.</p>

  <p>The door of the house was open. I don't know why this shocked me so much.
  It was like seeing the great Etherton with his mouth agape. Zandor leaned on
  the bell. It made a thin chime of music far inside and we had no other
  answer. Zandor went in.</p>

  <p>"You'd better not do that," I protested. "The old man won't stand
  intrusions."</p>

  <p>"Look!" said Zandor. "I knew it... hungry!"</p>

  <p>I followed him a step and saw him pointing to the living room; there was
  enough slanting moonshine to show that it was empty. The waxed floor shone
  like water, but there was not a stick of furniture. Zandor strode through the
  open door beyond and into the kitchen. There was a rusted gas stove.
  Something scurried away on a shelf and I saw a bit of nibbled cheese rind and
  cracker crumbs. But Zandor was moving on through a naked dining room and into
  a bed chamber that was furnished with box springs on the floor, a pier glass,
  and a big, gilded chair in front of the mirror. In the chair sat Etherton
  wrapped in a black cloak with his white head thrown back and his right hand
  at his breast, supported by something.</p>

  <p>He looked at us with deeply veiled eyes of contempt and seemed about to
  make a gesture of silent dismissal. It needed another glance to see that all
  his gesturing had ended, for what supported his hand was the hilt of the
  little medieval dagger he had driven through his heart.</p>

  <p>I looked away from him to the three big photographs which hung on the
  walls and showed me Etherton as the Lion-Hearted in heavy chain mail, as
  Henri Quatre with the famous white plume in his helmet, as King Arthur
  bearded like a saint.</p>

  <p>Understanding grew in me. Those rare appearances of Etherton on the screen
  had not been a casual amusement but the nerve center of his whole life. His
  parts never had been large but they had made him a king, and with a child's
  pitiful sincerity he had enclosed himself within a dream. Rather than step
  outside it, he had starved. I could imagine with what care he dressed himself
  this evening, borrowed the last possible dollar from a pawnbroker and went
  out for the final time to see if Hollywood once more would give him a shadowy
  throne. Instead, it preferred to see in him the wicked moneylender, so he
  came home and erased himself from the page.</p>

  <p>Zandor was triumphant.</p>

  <p>"You see? You see?" he roared at me. "I was right. I <i>did</i> spot the
  hunger in him. He's been on a throne for thirty years but when he got the
  Shylock offer, he knew that I'd seen the starvation in his face. The seventy-
  five thousand scared him. He was tempted and he almost fell. The hundred
  thousand would have bought him, lock, stock and barrel. But that fool of a
  Gregg didn't know how to bargain."</p>

  <p>I got out into the garden. It was a warm June night, but I was shivering.
  Zandor followed me. The bigness of his voice made the fountain pool
  tremble.</p>

  <p>"He wanted to be a king or nothing, you see?" roared Zandor.
  "So he came home and ended his reign. You get it? It's big stuff. It's
  new. It's a picture. And it's mine."</p>
