  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY OAKDALE</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, December 1930<br>

  Collected as "The Chopham Affair" in <i>The Woman from the East</i>, 1934</h3>

  <br>

  <p class="first">THERE was a man who had a way with women. His name was
  Alphonse de Riebiera, and he described himself as a Spaniard, though his
  passport was issued by a South American republic. Sometimes he presented
  visiting cards which were inscribed 'Le Marquis de Riebiera', but that was
  only on very special occasions.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The opening of this story was modified for publication
  in <i>The Woman from the East</i>, where it reads:<br>
     LAWYERS who write books are not, as a rule, popular with their confrères,
  but Archibald Lenton, the most brilliant of prosecuting attorneys, was an
  exception. He kept a case book and published extracts from time to time. He
  has not published his theories on the Chopham affair, though I believe he
  formulated one. I present him with the facts of the case and the truth about
  Alphonse or Alphonso Riebiera.<br>
     This was a man who had a way with women, especially women who had not
  graduated in the more worldly school of experience. He described himself as a
  Spaniard, though his passport was issued by a South American republic.
  Sometimes he presented visiting cards which were inscribed 'Le Marquis de
  Riebiera', but that was only on very special occasions.]</p><br>

  <p>He was young, with an olive complexion, faultless features, and showed his
  two rows of dazzling white teeth when he smiled. He found it convenient to
  change his appearance. For example: when he was a hired dancer attached to
  the personnel of an Egyptian hotel he wore little side whiskers, which, oddly
  enough, exaggerated his youthfulness; in the Casino at Enghien, where by some
  means he secured the position of croupier, he was decorated with a little
  black moustache. Staid, sober and unimaginative spectators of his many
  adventures were irritably amazed that women said anything to him, but then it
  is notoriously difficult for any man, even an unimaginative man, to discover
  attractive qualities in successful lovers.</p>

  <p>And yet the most unlikely women came under his spell and had to regret it.
  There arrived a time when he became a patron of the gambling establishments
  where he had been the most humble and the least trusted of servants, when he
  lived royally in hotels, where he once was hired at so many <i>piastre</i>
  per dance. Diamonds came to his spotless shirt front, pretty manicurists
  tended his nails and received fees larger than his one-time dancing partners
  had slipped shyly into his hand.</p>

  <p>There were certain gross men who played interminable dominoes in the
  cheaper cafés that abound on the unfashionable side of the Seine, who are
  amazing news centres. They know how the oddest people live and they were very
  plain spoken when they discussed Alphonse. They could tell you, though heaven
  knows how the information came to them, of fat registered letters that came
  to him in his flat in the Boulevard Haussman, Registered letters stuffed with
  money, and despairing letters that said in effect (and in various languages)
  "I can send you no more&mdash;this is the last." But they did send more.</p>

  <p>Alphonse had developed a well organised business. He would leave for
  London, or Rome, or Amsterdam, or Vienna, or even Athens, arriving at his
  destination by sleeping-car, drove to the best hotel, hired a luxurious
  suite&mdash;and telephoned. Usually the unhappy lady met him by appointment,
  tearful, hysterically furious, bitter, insulting, but always
  remunerative.</p>

  <p>For when Alphonse read extracts from the letters they had sent to him in
  the day of the Great Glamour and told them what their husbands income was
  almost to a pound, lira, franc or guilder, they reconsidered their decision
  to tell their husbands everything and Alphonse went back to Paris with his
  allowance.</p>

  <p>This was his method with the bigger game; sometimes he announced his
  coming visit with a letter discreetly worded, which made personal application
  unnecessary. He was not very much afraid of husbands or brothers; the
  philosophy which had germinated from his experience made him contemptuous of
  human nature. He believed that most people were cowards and lived in fear of
  their lives, and greater fear of their regulations. He carried two
  silver-plated revolvers, one in each hip pocket. They had prettily damascened
  barrels and ivory handles carved in the likeness of nymphs. He bought them in
  Cairo from a man who smuggled cocaine from Vienna.</p>

  <p>Alphonse had some twenty "clients" on his books and added to them as
  opportunity arose. Of the twenty, five were gold mines (he thought of them as
  such) the remainder were silver mines.</p>

  <p>There was a silver mine living in England, a very lovely, rather
  sad-looking girl, who was happily married except when she thought of
  Alphonse. She loved her husband and hated herself and hated Alphonse
  intensely and impotently. Having a fortune of her own she could
  pay&mdash;therefore she paid. Then in a fit of desperate revolt she wrote
  saying: "This is the last, etc." Alphonse was amused. He waited until
  September when the next allowance was due, and it did not come. Nor in
  October, nor November. In December he wrote to her; he did not wish to go to
  England in December, for England is very gloomy and foggy, and it was so much
  nicer in Egypt; but business was business.</p>

  <p>His letter reached its address when the woman to whom it was addressed was
  on a visit to her aunt in Long Island. She had been born an American.
  Alphonse had not written in answer to her letter; she had sailed for New York
  feeling safe.</p>

  <p>Her husband, whose initial was the same as his wife's, opened the letter
  by accident and read it through very carefully. He was no fool. He did not
  regard the wife he wooed as an outcast; what happened before his marriage was
  her business&mdash;what happened now was his.</p>

  <p>And he understood these wild dreams of hers, and her wild uncontrollable
  weeping for no reason at all, and he knew what the future held for her.</p>

  <p>He went to Paris and made inquiries: he sought the company of the gross
  men who play dominoes and heard much that was interesting.</p>

  <p>Alphonse arrived in London and telephoned from a call box. Madam was not
  at home. A typewritten letter came to him, making an appointment for the
  Wednesday. It was the usual rendezvous, the hour specified, an injunction to
  secrecy. The affair ran normally.</p>

  <p>He passed his time pleasantly in the days of waiting. Bought a new Spanza
  car of the latest model, arranged for its transportation to Paris and in the
  meantime amused himself by driving it.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AT the appointed hour he arrived, knocked at the door of the
  house and was admitted...</p>

  <p>Riebiera, green of face, shaking at the knees, surrendered his two
  ornamented pistols without a fight....</p><br>

  <p class="first">AT eight o'clock on Christmas morning Superintendent
  Oakington was called from his warm bed by telephone and was told the
  news.</p>

  <p>A milkman, driving across Chobham Common, had seen a car standing a little
  off the road. It was apparently a new car and must have been standing in its
  position all night. There were three inches of snow on its roof, beneath the
  body of the car the bracken was green.</p>

  <p>An arresting sight even for a milkman, who at seven o'clock on a wintry
  morning had no other thought than to supply the needs of his customers as
  quickly as possible and return at the earliest moment to his own home and the
  festivities and feastings proper to the day.</p>

  <p>He got out of the Ford he was driving and stamped through the snow. He saw
  a man lying, face downwards, and in his grey hand a silver-barrelled
  revolver. He was dead. And then the startled milkman saw the second man. His
  lace was invisible; it lay under a thick mask of snow that made his pinched
  features grotesque and hideous.</p>

  <p>The milkman ran back to his car and drove towards a Police station.</p>

  <p>Mr. Oakington was on the spot within an hour of being called. There were a
  dozen policemen grouped around the car and the shapes in the snow; the
  reporters, thank God, had not arrived.</p><br>

  <p class="first">LATE in the afternoon the superintendent put a call through
  to one man who might help in a moment of profound bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Archibald Lenton was the most promising of Treasury Juniors that the Bar
  had known for years. The Common Law Bar lifts its delicate nose at lawyers
  who are interested in criminal cases to the exclusion of other practice. But
  Archie Lenton survived the unspoken disapproval of his brethren and
  concentrating on this unsavoury aspect of jurisprudence was both a successful
  advocate and an authority on certain types of crime, for he had written a
  text hook which was accepted as authoritative.</p>

  <p>An hour later he was in the superintendent's room at Scotland Yard,
  listening to the story.</p>

  <p>"We've identified both men. One is a foreigner, a man from the Argentine,
  so far as I can discover from his passport, named Alphonse or Alphonso
  Riebiera. He lives in Paris and has been in this country for about a
  week."</p>

  <p>"Well off?"</p>

  <p>"Very, I should say. We found about two hundred pounds in his pocket. He
  was staying at the Nederland Hotel and bought a car for twelve hundred pounds
  only last Friday, paying cash. That is the car we found near the body. I've
  been on the 'phone to Paris, and he is suspected there of being a
  blackmailer. The police have searched and sealed his flat, but found no
  documents of any kind. He is evidently the sort of man who keeps his business
  under his hat."</p>

  <p>"He was shot you say? How many times?"</p>

  <p>"Once, through the head. The other man was killed in exactly the same way.
  There was a trace of blood in the car, but nothing else."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lenton jotted down a note on a pad of paper.</p>

  <p>"Who was the other man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's the queerest thing of all&mdash;an old acquaintance of yours."</p>

  <p>"Mine? Who on earth&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Do you remember a fellow you defended on a murder charge&mdash;Joe
  Stackett?"</p>

  <p>"At Exeter, good Lord, yes! Was that the man?"</p>

  <p>"We've identified him from his finger prints. As a matter of fact, we were
  after Joe&mdash;he's an expert car thief who only came out of prison last
  week; he got away with a car yesterday morning, but abandoned it after a
  chase and slipped through the fingers of the Flying Squad. Last night he
  pinched an old car from a second-hand dealer and was spotted and chased. We
  found the car abandoned in Tooting. He was never seen again until he was
  picked up on the Chobham Common."</p>

  <p>Archie Lenton leant back in his chair and stared thoughtfully at the
  ceiling.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401831h-images/TheChobhamAffair-1.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"He stole the Spanza&mdash;the owner jumped on the running board and there
  was a fight&mdash;" he began, but the superintendent shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Where did he get his gun? English criminals do not carry guns. And they
  weren't ordinary revolvers. Silver-plated, ivory butts carved with girls'
  figures&mdash;both identical, There was fifty pounds in Joe's pocket; they
  are consecutive numbers to those found in Riebiera's pocket book. If he'd
  stolen them he'd have taken the lot. Joe wouldn't stop at murder, you know
  that, Mr. Lenton. He killed that old woman in Exeter although he was
  acquitted. Riebiera must have given him the fifty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A telephone bell rang; the superintendent drew the instrument towards him
  and listened. After ten minutes of a conversation which was confined so far
  as Oakington was concerned to a dozen brief questions, he put down the
  receiver.</p>

  <p>"One of my officers has traced the movements of the car, it was seen
  standing outside 'Greenlawns', a house in Tooting. It was there at 9.45 and
  was seen by a postman. If you feel like spending Christmas night doing a
  little bit of detective work, we'll go down and see the place."</p>

  <p>They arrived half an hour later at a house in a very respectable
  neighbourhood. The two detectives who waited their coming had obtained the
  keys but had not gone inside. The house was for sale and was standing empty.
  It was the property of two old maiden ladies who had placed the premises in
  an agent's hands when they had moved into the country.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the car before an empty house had aroused the interest
  of the postman. He had seen no lights in the windows and decided that the
  machine was owned by one of the guests at the next door house.</p>

  <p>Oakington opened the door and switched on the light. Strangely enough, the
  old ladies had not had the current disconnected, though they were notoriously
  mean. The passage was bare, except for a pair of bead curtains which hung
  from an arched support to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>The front room drew blank. It was in one of the back rooms on the ground
  floor that they found evidence of the crime. There was blood on the bare
  planks of the floor and in the grate a litter of ashes.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has burnt papers&mdash;I smelt it when I came into the room,"
  said Lenton.</p>

  <p>He knelt before the grate and lifted a handful of fire ashes
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"And these have been stirred up until there isn't an ash big enough to
  hold a word," he said.</p>

  <p>He examined the blood prints and made a careful scrutiny of the walls. The
  window was covered with a shutter.</p>

  <p>"That kept the light from getting in," he said, "and the sound of the shot
  getting out. There is nothing else here."</p>

  <p>The detective sergeant who was inspecting the other rooms returned with
  the news that a kitchen window had been forced. There was one muddy print on
  the kitchen table which was under the window and a rough attempt had been
  made to obliterate this. Behind the house was a large garden and behind that
  an allotment. It would be easy to reach and enter the house without exciting
  attention.</p>

  <p>"But if Stackett was being chased by the police why should he come here?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"His car was found abandoned not more than two hundred yards from here,"
  explained Oakington, "He may have entered the house in the hope of finding
  something valuable and have been surprised by Riebiera."</p>

  <p>Archie Lenton laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I can give you a better theory than that," he said, and for the greater
  part of the night he wrote carefully and convincingly, reconstructing the
  crime, giving the most minute details.</p>

  <p>That account is still preserved at Scotland Yard, and there are many
  highly placed officials who swear by it.</p>

  <p>And yet, something altogether different happened on the night of that 24th
  of December...</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE streets were greasy. The car lines abominably so.
  Stackett's mean little car slithered and skidded alarmingly. He had been in a
  bad temper when he started out on his hungry quest; he grew sour and savage
  with the evening passing on with nothing to show for his discomfort. The
  suburban high street was crowded too; street cars moved at a crawl, their
  bells clanging pathetically; street vendors had their stalls jammed end to
  end on either side of the thoroughfare; stalls green and red with holly
  wreaths and untidy bunches of mistletoe; there were butcher stalls, raucous
  auctioneers holding masses of raw beef and roaring their offers; vegetable
  stalls; stalls piled high with plates and cups and saucers and gaudy dishes
  and glassware, shining in the rays of the powerful acetylene lamps...The car
  skidded. There was a crash and a scream. Breaking crockery has an alarming
  sound...A yell from the stall owner; Stackett straightened his machine and
  darted between a tramcar and a trolley....</p>

  <p>"Hi, you!"</p>

  <p>He twisted his wheel, almost knocked down the policeman who came to
  intercept him and swung into a dark side street, his foot clamped on the
  accelerator. He turned to the right and the left, to the right again. Here
  was a long suburban road; houses monotonously alike on either side, terribly
  dreary brick blocks where men and women and children lived, were born, paid
  rent and died. A mile further on he passed the gateway of the cemetery where
  they found the rest which was their supreme reward for living at all. The
  police whistle had followed him for less than a quarter of a mile. He had
  passed a policeman running towards the sound&mdash;anyway, flatties never
  worried Stackett. Some of his ill-humour passed in the amusement which the
  sight of the running copper brought.</p>

  <p>Bringing the noisy little car to a standstill by the side of the road, he
  got down and, relighting the cigarette he had so carefully extinguished, he
  gazed glumly at the stained and battered mudguard which was shivering and
  shaking under the pulsations of the engine.</p>

  <p>Through that same greasy street came a motor-cyclist, muffled to the chin,
  his goggles dangling about his neck. He pulled up his shining wheel near the
  policeman on point duty and, supporting his balance with one foot in the
  muddy road, asked questions.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sergeant," said the policeman. "I saw him. He went down there. As a
  matter of fact, I was going to pinch him for driving to the common danger,
  but he hopped it."</p>

  <p>"That's Joe Stackett," nodded Sergeant Kenton of the C.I.D. "A thin-faced
  man with a pointed nose?"</p>

  <p>The point duty policeman had not seen the face behind the windscreen, hut
  he had area the car, and that he described accurately.</p>

  <p>"Stolen from Elmer's garage. At least, Elmer will say so, but he probably
  provided it. Dumped stuff. Which way did you say?"</p>

  <p>The policeman indicated, and the sergeant kicked his engine to life and
  went chug-chugging down the dark street. He missed Mr. Stackett by a piece of
  bad luck, bad luck for everybody, including Mr. Stackett, who was at the
  beginning of his amazing adventure.</p>

  <p>Switching off the engine, he had continued on foot. About fifty yards away
  was the wide opening of a road superior in class to any he had traversed.
  Even the dreariest suburb has its West End, and here were villas standing on
  their own acres; very sedate villas, with porches and porch lamps in
  wrought-iron and oddly coloured glass and shaven lawns, and rose gardens
  swathed in matting, and no two villas were alike. At the far end he saw a red
  light, and his heart leapt with joy: Christmas&mdash;it was to be Christmas
  after all, with good food and lashings of drink and other manifestations of
  happiness and comfort peculiarly attractive to Joe Stackett. It looked like a
  car worth knocking off, even in the darkness. He saw somebody near the
  machine and stopped. It was difficult to tell in the gloom whether the person
  near the car had got in or had come out. He listened. There came to him
  neither the slam of the driver's door nor the whine of the self-starter. He
  came a little closer, walked boldly on, his restless eyes moving left and
  right for danger. All the houses were occupied. Bright lights illuminated the
  casement cloth which covered the windows. He heard the sound of respectable
  revelry and two gramophones playing dance tunes. But his eyes always came
  back to the polished limousine at the door of the end house. There was no
  light there. It was completely dark, from the gabled attic to the ground
  floor.</p>

  <p>He quickened his pace. It was a Spanza. His heart leapt at the
  recognition. For a Spanza is a car for which there is a ready sale. You can
  get as much as a hundred pounds for a new one. They are popular amongst
  Eurasians and wealthy Hindus. Binky Jones, who was the best car fence in
  London, would pay him cash, not less than sixty. In a week's time that car
  would be crated and on its way to India, there to be resold at a handsome
  profit.</p>

  <p>The driver's door was wide open. He heard the soft purr of the engine. He
  slid into the driver's seat, closed the door noiselessly and almost without
  as much as a whine the Spanza moved on.</p>

  <p>It was a new one, brand new...A hundred at least. Gathering speed, he
  passed to the end of the road, came to a wide common and skirted it.
  Presently he was in another shopping street, but he knew too much to turn
  back towards London. He would take the open country for it, work round
  through Esher and come into London by the Portsmouth Road. The art of car
  stealing is to move as quickly as possible from the police division where the
  machine is stolen and may be instantly reported to a 'foreign' division,
  which will not knew of the theft until hours after.</p>

  <p>There might be all sorts of extra pickings. There was a big luggage trunk
  behind' and possibly a few knick-knacks in the body of the car itself. At a
  suitable moment he would make a leisurely search. At the moment he headed for
  Epsom, turning back to hit the Kingston By-pass. Sleet fell&mdash;snow and
  rain together. He set the screen-wiper working and began to hum a little
  tune. The Kingston By-pass was deserted. It was too unpleasant a night for
  much traffic. Mr. Stackett was debating what would be the best place to make
  his search when he felt an unpleasant draught behind him. He had noticed
  there was a sliding window separating the interior of the car from the
  driver's seat, which had possibly worked loose. He put up his hand to push it
  close.</p>

  <p>"Drive on, don't turn round or I'll blow your head off!"</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401831h-images/TheChobhamAffair-3.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Involuntarily he half-turned to see the gaping muzzle of an automatic and
  in his agitation put his foot on the brake. The car skidded from one side of
  the road to the other, half turned and recovered.</p>

  <p>"Drive on, I am telling you," said a metallic voice. "When you reach the
  Portsmouth Road turn and bear towards Weybridge. If you attempt to stop I
  will shoot you. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>Joe Stackett's teeth were chattering. He could not articulate the 'yes'.
  All that he could do was to nod. He went on nodding for half a mile before he
  realised what he was doing.</p>

  <p>No further word came from the interior of the car until they passed the
  racecourse; then unexpectedly the voice gave a new direction:</p>

  <p>"Turn left towards Leatherhead."</p>

  <p>The driver obeyed.</p>

  <p>They came to a stretch of common. Stackett, who knew the country well,
  realised the complete isolation of the spot.</p>

  <p>"Slow down, pull into the left...There is no dip there. You can switch on
  your lights."</p>

  <p>The car slid and bumped over the uneven ground, the wheels crunched
  through beds of bracken...</p>

  <p>"Stop."</p>

  <p>The door behind him opened. The man got out. He jerked open the driver's
  door.</p>

  <p>"Step down." he said. "Turn out your lights first. Have you got a
  gun?"</p>

  <p>"Gun? Why the hell should I have a gun?" stammered the car thief.</p>

  <p>He was focused all the time in a ring of light from a very bright electric
  torch which the passenger had turned upon him.</p>

  <p>"You are an act of Providence."</p>

  <p>Stackett could not see the face of the speaker. He saw only the gun in the
  hand, for the stranger kept this well in the light.</p><br>

  <p>"Look inside the car."</p>

  <p>Stackett looked and almost collapsed: there was a figure huddled in one
  corner of the seat&mdash;the figure of a man. He saw something else&mdash;a
  bicycle jammed into the car, one wheel touching the roof, the other on the
  floor. He saw the man's white face...Dead! A slim, rather short man, with
  dark hair and a dark moustache, a foreigner. There was a little red hole in
  his temple.</p>

  <p>"Pull him out," commanded the voice sharply.</p>

  <p>Stackett shrank back, but a powerful hand pushed him towards the car.</p>

  <p>"Pull him out!"</p>

  <p>With his face moist with cold perspiration, the car thief obeyed; put his
  hands under the armpits of the inanimate figure, dragged him out and laid him
  on the bracken.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," he whimpered.</p>

  <p>"Completely," said the other.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he switched off his electric torch. Far away came a gleam of
  light on the road, coming swiftly towards them. It was a car moving towards
  Esher. It passed.</p>

  <p>"I saw you coming just after I had got the body into the car. There wasn't
  time to get back to the house. I'd hoped you were just an ordinary
  pedestrian. When I saw van get into the car I guessed pretty well your
  vocation. What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Joseph Stackett."</p>

  <p>"Stackett?" The light flashed on his face again. "How wonderful! Do you
  remember the Exeter Assizes? the woman you killed with a hammer? I defended
  you!"</p>

  <p>Joe's eyes were wide open. He stared past the light at the dim grey thing
  that was a face.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lenton?" he said hoarsely. "Good God, sir!"</p>

  <p>"You murdered her in cold blood for a few paltry shillings and you would
  have been dead now. Stackett, if I hadn't found a flaw in the evidence. You
  expected to die, didn't you? You remember how we used to talk in Exeter Gaol
  about the trap that would not work when they tried to hang a murderer and the
  ghoulish satisfaction you had that you would stand on the same trap?"</p>

  <p>Joe Stackett grinned uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"And I meant it, sir," he said, "but you can't try a man twice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then his eyes dropped to the figure at his feet, the dapper little man
  with a black moustache, with a red hole in his temple.</p>

  <p>Lenton leant over the dead man, took out a pocket case from the inside of
  the jacket and at his leisure detached ten notes.</p>

  <p>"Put these in your pocket."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, wondering what service would be required him, wondered more why
  the pocket book with its precious notes was returned to the dead man's
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Lenton looked back along the road. Snow was falling now, real snow. It
  came down in small particles falling so thickly that it seemed that a fog lay
  on the land.</p>

  <p>"You fit into this perfectly... a man unfit to live. There is fate in this
  meeting."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean by fate."</p>

  <p>Joe Stackett grew bold: he had to deal with a lawyer and a gentleman who,
  in a criminal sense was his inferior. The money obviously had been given to
  him to keep his mouth shut.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing, Mr. Lenton? That's bad, ain't it? This fellow's
  dead, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He must have seen the pencil of flame that came from the other's hand. He
  could have felt nothing, for he was dead before he sprawled over the body on
  the ground.</p>

  <p>Mr. Archibald Lenton examined the revolver by the light of his lamp,
  opened the breech and closed it again. Stooping, he laid it near the hand of
  the little man with the black moustache and, lifting the body of Joe
  Stackett, he dragged it towards the car and let it drop. Bending down, he
  clasped the still warm hands about the butt of another pistol. Then, at his
  leisure, he took the bicycle from the interior of the car and carried it back
  to the road. It was already white and fine snow was falling in sheets.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lenton went on and reached his home two hours later, when the bells of
  the local Anglo-Catholic church were ringing musically.</p>

  <p>There was a cable waiting for him from his wife:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"
     style="text-align:center">"A HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO YOU, DARLING."</p><br>

  <p>He was ridiculously pleased that she had remembered to send the
  wire&mdash;he was very fond of his wife.</p>
