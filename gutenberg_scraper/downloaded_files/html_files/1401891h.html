  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">1. PENALTY &mdash; AND AFTERMATH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Thomas Marshall Connor was about to die. The droning voice
  of the prison chaplain gradually dulled his perception instead of stimulating
  his mind. Everything was hazy and indistinct to the condemned man. He was
  going to the electric chair in just ten minutes to pay the supreme penalty
  because he had accidentally killed a man with his bare fists.</p>

  <p>Connor, vibrantly alive, vigorous and healthy, only twenty-six, a
  brilliant young engineer, was going to die. And, knowing, he did not care.
  But there was nothing at all nebulous about the gray stone and cold iron bars
  of the death cell. There was nothing uncertain about the split down his
  trouser leg and the shaven spot on his head.</p>

  <p>The condemned man was acutely aware of the solidarity of material things
  about him. The world he was leaving was concrete and substantial. The
  approaching footsteps of the death guard sounded heavily in the distance.</p>

  <p>The cell door opened, and the chaplain ceased his murmuring. Passively
  Thomas Marshall Connor accepted his blessings, and calmly took his position
  between his guards for his last voluntary walk.</p>

  <p>He remained in his state of detachment as they seated him in the chair,
  strapped his body and fastened the electrodes. He heard the faint rustling of
  the witnesses and the nervous, rapid scratching of reporters' pencils. He
  could imagine their adjectives&mdash;"Calloused murderer"... "Brazenly
  indifferent to his fate."</p>

  <p>But it was as if the matter concerned a third party.</p>

  <p>He simply relaxed and waited. To die so quickly and painlessly was more a
  relief than anything. He was not even aware when the warden gave his signal.
  There was a sudden silent flash of blue light. And then&mdash;nothing at
  all.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">So this was death. The slow and majestic drifting through
the Stygian
  void, borne on the ageless tides of eternity.</p>

  <p>Peace, at last&mdash;peace, and quiet, and rest.</p>

  <p>But what was this sensation like the glimpse of a faint, faraway light
  which winked on and off like a star? After an interminable period the light
  became fixed and steady, a thing of annoyance. Thomas Marshall Connor, slowly
  became aware of the fact of his existence as an entity, in some unknown
  state. The senses and memories that were his personality struggled weakly to
  reassemble themselves into a thinking unity of being&mdash;and he became
  conscious of pain and physical torture.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of shrill voices, and a stir of fresh air. He became
  aware of his body again. He lay quiet, inert, exhausted. But not as lifeless
  as he had lain for&mdash;how long?</p>

  <p>When the shrill voices sounded again, Connor opened unseeing eyes and
  stared at the blackness just above him. After a space he began to see, but
  not to comprehend. The blackness became a jagged, pebbled roof no more than
  twelve inches from his eyes&mdash;rough and unfinished like the under side of
  a concrete walk.</p>

  <p>The light became a glimmer of daylight from a point near his right
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>Another sensation crept into his awareness. He was horribly, bitterly
  cold. Not with the chill of winter air, but with the terrible frigidity of
  inter-galactic space. Yet he was on&mdash;no, <i>in,</i> earth of some sort.
  It was as if icy water flowed in his veins instead of blood. Yet he felt
  completely dehydrated. His body was as inert as though detached from his
  brain, but he was cruelly imprisoned within it. He became conscious of a
  growing resentment of this fact.</p>

  <p>Then, stimulated by the shrilling, piping voices and the patter of tiny
  feet out there somewhere to the right, he made a tremendous effort to move.
  There was a dry, withered crackling sound&mdash;like the crumpling of old
  parchment&mdash;but indubitably his right arm had lifted!</p>

  <p>The exertion left him weak and nauseated. For a time he lay as in a
  stupor. Then a second effort proved easier. After another timeless interval
  of struggling torment his legs yielded reluctant obedience to his brain.
  Again he lay quietly, exhausted, but gathering strength for the supreme
  effort of bursting from his crypt.</p>

  <p>For he knew now where he was. He lay in what remained of his grave. How or
  why, he did not know. That was to be determined.</p>

  <p>With all his weak strength he thrust against the left side of his queer
  tomb, moving his body against the crevice at his right. Only a thin veil of
  loose gravel and rubble blocked the way to the open. As his shoulder struck
  the pile, it gave and slid away, outward and downward, in a miniature
  avalanche.</p>

  <p>Blinding daylight smote Connor like an agony. The shrill voices
  screamed.</p>

  <p>"'S moom!" a child's voice cried tremulously. "'S moom again!"</p>

  <p>Connor panted from exertion, and struggled to emerge from his hole, each
  movement producing another noise like rattling paper. And suddenly he was
  free! The last of the gravel tinkled away and he rolled abruptly down a small
  declivity to rest limply at the bottom of the little hillside.</p>

  <p>He saw now that erosion had cut through this burial ground&mdash;wherever
  it was&mdash;and had opened a way for him through the side of his grave. His
  sight was strangely dim, but he became aware of half a dozen little figures
  in a frightened semicircle beyond him.</p>

  <p>Children! Children in strange modernistic garb of bright colors, but
  nevertheless human children who stared at him with wide-open mouths and
  popping eyes. Their curiously cherubic faces were set in masks of horrified
  terror.</p>

  <p>Suddenly recalling the terrors he had sometimes known in his own
  childhood, Connor was surprised they did not flee. He stretched forth an
  imploring hand and made a desperate effort to speak. This was his first
  attempt to use his voice, and he found that he could not.</p>

  <p>The spell of dread that held the children frozen was instantly broken. One
  of them gave a dismayed cry: "A-a-a-h! 'S a specker!"</p>

  <p>In panic, shrieking that cry, the entire group turned and fled. They
  disappeared around the shoulder of the eroded hill, and Connor was left,
  horribly alone. He groaned from the depths of his despair and was conscious
  of a faint rasping noise through his cracked and parched lips.</p>

  <p>He realized suddenly that he was quite naked&mdash;his shroud had long
  since moldered to dust. At the same moment that full comprehension of what
  this meant came to him, he was gazing in horror at his body. Bones! Nothing
  but bones, covered with a dirty, parchment-like skin!</p>

  <p>So tightly did his skin cover his skeletal framework that the very
  structure of the bones showed through. He could see the articulation at
  knuckles, knees, and toes. And the parchment skin was cracked like an ancient
  Chinese vase, checked like aged varnish. He was a horror from the tomb, and
  he nearly fainted at the realization.</p>

  <p>After a swooning space, he endeavored to arise. Finding that he could not,
  he began crawling painfully and laboriously toward a puddle of water from the
  last rain. Reaching it, he leaned over to place his lips against its surface,
  reckless of its potability, and sucked in the liquid until a vast roaring
  filled his ears.</p>

  <p>The moment of dizziness passed. He felt somewhat better, and his breathing
  rasped a bit less painfully in his moistened throat. His eyesight was slowly
  clearing and as he leaned above the little pool, he glimpsed the specter
  reflected there. It looked like a skull&mdash;a face with lips shrunken away
  from the teeth, so fleshless that it might have been a death's head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" he called out aloud, and his voice croaked like that of a sick
  raven. "What and where am I!"</p>

  <p>In the back of his mind all through this weird experience, there had been
  a sense of something strange aside from his emergence from a tomb in the form
  of a living scarecrow. He stared up at the sky.</p>

  <p>The vault of heaven was blue and fleecy with thewhitest of clouds. The sun
  was shining as he had never thought to see it shine again. The grass was
  green. The ground was normally earthy. Everything was as it should
  be&mdash;but there was a strangeness about it that frightened him.
  Instinctively he knew that something was direfully amiss.</p>

  <p>It was not the fact that he failed to recognize his surroundings. He had
  not had the strength to explore; neither did he know where he had been
  buried. It was that indefinable homing instinct possessed in varying degree
  by all animate things. That instinct was out of gear. His time sense had
  stopped with the throwing of that electric switch&mdash;how long ago?
  Somehow, lying there under the warming rays of the sun, he felt like an alien
  presence in a strange country.</p>

  <p>"Lost!" he whimpered like a child.</p>

  <p>After a long space in which he remained in a sort of stupor, he became
  aware of the sound of footsteps. Dully he looked up. A group of men, led by
  one of the children, was advancing slowly toward him. They wore brightly
  colored shirts&mdash;red, blue, violet&mdash;and queer baggy trousers
  gathered at the ankles in an exotic style.</p>

  <p>With a desperate burst of energy, Connor gained his knees. He extended a
  pleading skeletonlike claw.</p>

  <p>"Help me!" he croaked in his hoarse whisper.</p>

  <p>The beardless, queerly effeminate-looking men halted and stared at him in
  horror.</p>

  <p>"'Assim!" shrilled the child's voice. "'S a specker. 'S dead."</p>

  <p>One of the men stepped forward, looking from Connor to the gaping hole in
  the hillside.</p>

  <p>"Wassup?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>Connor could only repeat his croaking plea for aid.</p>

  <p>"'Esick," spoke another man gravely. "Sleeper, eh?"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of consultation among the men with the bright clothes
  and oddly soft, womanlike voices.</p>

  <p>"T' Evanie!" decided one. "T' Evanie, the Sorc'ess."</p>

  <p>They closed quickly around the half reclining Connor and lifted him
  gently. He was conscious of being borne along the curving cut to a yellow
  country road, and then black oblivion descended once more to claim him.</p>

  <p>When he regained consciousness the next time, he found that he was within
  walls, reclining on a soft bed of some kind. He had a vague dreamy impression
  of a girlish face with bronze hair and features like Raphael's angels bending
  over him. Something warm and sweetish, like glycerin, trickled down his
  throat.</p>

  <p>Then, to the whispered accompaniment of that queerly slurred English
  speech, he sank into the blissful repose of deep sleep.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">2. EVANIE THE SORCERESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There were successive intervals of dream and oblivion, of
  racking pain and terrible nauseating weakness; of voices murmuring queer,
  unintelligible words that yet were elusively familiar.</p>

  <p>Then one day he awoke to the consciousness of a summer morning. Birds
  twittered; in the distance children shouted. Clear of mind at last, he lay on
  a cushioned couch puzzling over his whereabouts, even his identity, for
  nothing within his vision indicated where or who he was.</p>

  <p>The first thing that caught his attention was his own right hand. Paper-
  thin, incredibly bony, it lay like the hand of death on the rosy coverlet, so
  transparent that the very color shone through. He could not raise it; only a
  twitching of the horrible fingers attested its union with his body.</p>

  <p>The room itself was utterly unfamiliar in its almost magnificently simple
  furnishings. There were neither pictures nor ornaments. Only several chairs
  of aluminum-like metal, a gleaming silvery table holding a few ragged old
  volumes, a massive cabinet against the opposite wall, and a chandelier
  pendant by a chain from the ceiling. He tried to call out. A faint croak
  issued.</p>

  <p>The response was startlingly immediate. A soft voice said, "Hahya?" in his
  ear and he turned his head pain-fully to face the girl of the bronze hair,
  seated at his side. She smiled gently.</p>

  <p>She was dressed in curious green baggy trousers gathered at the ankle, and
  a brilliant green shirt. She had rolled the full sleeves to her shoulders.
  Hers was like the costume of the men who had brought him here.</p>

  <p>"Whahya?" she said softly.</p>

  <p>He understood.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I'm&mdash;uh&mdash;Thomas Connor, of course."</p>

  <p>"F'm 'ere?"</p>

  <p>"From St. Louis."</p>

  <p>"Selui? 'S far off."</p>

  <p>Far off? Then where was he? Suddenly a fragment of memory returned. The
  trial&mdash;Ruth&mdash;that catastrophic episode of the grim chair. Ruth! The
  yellow-haired girl he had once adored, who was to have been his
  wife&mdash;the girl who had coldly sworn his life away because he had killed
  the man she loved.</p>

  <p>Dimly memory came back of how he had found her in that other man's arms on
  the very eve of their wedding; of his bitter realization that the man he had
  called friend had stolen Ruth from him. His outraged passions had flamed, the
  fire had blinded him, and when the ensuing battle had ended, the man had been
  crumpled on the green sward of the terrace, with a broken neck.</p>

  <p>He had been electrocuted for that. He had been strapped in that chair!</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;then the niche on the hill. But how&mdash;how? Had he by some
  miracle survived the burning current? He must have&mdash;and he still had the
  penalty to pay!</p>

  <p>He tried desperately to rise.</p>

  <p>"Must leave here!" he muttered. "Get away&mdash;must get away." A new
  thought. "No! I'm legally dead. They can't touch me now; no double jeopardy
  in this country. I'm safe!"</p>

  <p>Voices sounded in the next room, discussing him.</p>

  <p>"F'm Selui, he say," said a man's voice. "Longo, too." "Eah," said
  another. " 'S lucky to live&mdash;lucky! 'L be rich."</p>

  <p>That meant nothing to him. He raised his hand with a great effort; it
  glistened in the light with an oil of some sort. It was no longer cracked,
  and the ghost of a layer of tissue softened the bones. His flesh was growing
  back.</p>

  <p>His throat felt dry. He drew a breath that ended in a tickling cough.</p>

  <p>"Could I have some water?" he asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"N-n-n!" She shook her head. "N' water. S'm licket?" "Licket?" Must be
  liquid, he reflected. He nodded, and drank the mug of thick fluid she held to
  his lips.</p>

  <p>He grinned his thanks, and she sat beside him. He wondered what sort of
  colony was this into which he had fallen&mdash;with their exotic dress and
  queer, clipped English.</p>

  <p>His eyes wandered appreciatively over his companion; even if she were some
  sort of foreigner, she was gloriously beautiful, with her bronze hair
  gleaming above the emerald costume.</p>

  <p>"C'n talk," she said finally as if in permission.</p>

  <p>He accepted. "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"'M Evanie Sair. Evanie the Sorc'ess."</p>

  <p>"Evanie the Sorceress!" he echoed. "Pretty name&mdash;Evanie. Why the
  Sorceress, though? Do you tell fortunes?" The question puzzled her.</p>

  <p>"N'onstan," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;what do you do?"</p>

  <p>"Sorc'y." At his mystified look, she amplified it. "To give
  strength&mdash;to make well." She touched his fleshless arm.</p>

  <p>"But that's medicine&mdash;a science. Not sorcery."</p>

  <p>"Bah. Science&mdash;sorc'y. 'S all one. My father, Evan Sair</p>

  <p>the Wizard, taught me." Her face shadowed. "'S dead now." Then abruptly:
  "Whe's your money?" she asked. He stared. "Why&mdash;in St. Louis. In a
  bank."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed. "N-n-n! Selui! N'safe!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" He started. "Has there been another flood of
  bank-bustings?"</p>

  <p>The girl looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"N'safe," she reiterated. "Urbs is better. For very long, Urbs is better."
  She paused. "When'd you sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Why, last night."</p>

  <p>"N-n-n. The long sleep."</p>

  <p>The long sleep! It struck him with stunning force that his last memories
  before that terrible awakening had been of a September world&mdash;and this
  was mid-summer! A horror gripped him. How long&mdash;how long&mdash;had he
  lain in his&mdash;grave? Weeks? No&mdash;months, at least.</p>

  <p>He shuddered as the girl repeated gently, "When?"</p>

  <p>"In September," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"What year?"</p>

  <p>Surprise strengthened him. "Year? Nineteen thirty-eight, of course!"</p>

  <p>She rose suddenly. "'S no Nineteen thirty-eight. 'S only Eight forty-six
  now!"</p>

  <p>Then she was gone, nor on her return would she permit him to talk. The day
  vanished; he slept, and another day dawned and passed. Still Evanie Sair
  refused to allow him to talk again, and the succeeding days found him fuming
  and puzzled. Little by little, however, her strange clipped English became
  familiar.</p>

  <p>So he lay thinking of his situation, his remarkable escape, the miracle
  that had somehow softened the discharge of Missouri's generators. And he
  strengthened. A day came when Evanie again permitted speech, while he watched
  her preparing his food.</p>

  <p>"Y'onger, Tom?" she asked gently. "'L bea soon." He understood; she was
  saying, "Are you hungry, Tom? I'll be there soon."</p>

  <p>He answered with her own affirmative "Eah," and watched her place the meal
  in a miraculous cook stove that could be trusted to prepare it without
  burning.</p>

  <p>"Evanie," he began, "how long have I been here?"</p>

  <p>"Three months," said Evanie. "You were very sick."</p>

  <p>"But how long was I asleep?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to know," retorted Evanie. "I told you this was Eight forty-
  six."</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"The year Eight forty-six of what?"</p>

  <p>"Just Eight forty-six," Evanie said matter of factly. "Of the
  Enlightenment, of, course. What year did you sleep?"</p>

  <p>"I told you&mdash;Nineteen thirty-eight," insisted Connor, perplexed.
  "Nineteen thirty-eight, A.D."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Evanie, as if humoring a child.</p>

  <p>Then, "A.D.?" she repeated. "Anno Domini, that means. Year of the Master.
  But the Master is nowhere near nineteen hundred years old."</p>

  <p>Connor was nonplussed. He and Evanie seemed to be talking at cross-
  purposes. He calmly started again.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," he said grimly. "Suppose you tell me exactly what you
  think I am&mdash;all about it, just as if I were a&mdash;oh, a Martian. In
  simple words."</p>

  <p>"I know what you are," said Evanie. "You're a Sleeper. Often they wake
  with muddled minds."</p>

  <p>"And what," he pursued doggedly, "is a Sleeper?"</p>

  <p>Surprisingly Evanie answered that, in a clear, understandable&mdash;but
  most astonishing&mdash;way. Almost as astonished herself that Connor should
  not know the answer to his question.</p>

  <p>"A Sleeper," she said simply, and Connor was now able to understand her
  peculiar clipped speech&mdash;the speech of all these people&mdash;with
  comparative ease, "is one of those who undertake electrolepsis. That is, have
  themselves put to sleep for a long term of years to make money."</p>

  <p>"How? By exhibiting themselves?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I mean that those who want wealth badly enough, but won't
  spend years working for it, undertake the Sleep. You must remember
  that&mdash;if you have forgotten so much else. They put their money in the
  banks. organized for the Sleepers. You will remember. They guarantee six
  percent. You see, don't you? At that rate a Sleeper's money increases three
  hundred times a century&mdash;three hundred units for each one deposited. Six
  percent doubles their money every twelve years. A thousand becomes a fortune
  of three hundred thousand, if the Sleeper outlasts a century&mdash;and if he
  lives."</p>

  <p>"Fairy tales!" Connor said contemptuously, but now he understood her
  question about the whereabouts of his money, when he had first awakened.
  "What institution can guarantee six percent with safety? What could they
  invest in?"</p>

  <p>"They invest in one percent Urban bonds."</p>

  <p>"And run at a loss, I suppose!"</p>

  <p>"No. Their profits are enormous&mdash;from the funds of the nine out of
  every ten Sleepers who fail to waken!"</p>

  <p>"So I'm a Sleeper!" Connor said sharply. "Now tell me the truth."</p>

  <p>Evanie gazed anxiously down at him.</p>

  <p>"Electrolepsis often muddles one."</p>

  <p>"I'm not muddled!" he yelled. "I want truth, that's all. I want to know
  the date."</p>

  <p>"It's the middle of July, Eight hundred and forty-six," Evanie said
  patiently.</p>

  <p>"The devil it is! Perhaps I slept backward then! I want to know what
  happened to me."</p>

  <p>"Then suppose you tell," Evanie said gently.</p>

  <p>"I will!" he cried frantically. "I'm the Thomas Marshall Connor of the
  newspapers&mdash;or don't you read 'em? I'm the man who was tried for murder,
  and electrocuted. Tom Connor of St. Louis&mdash;St. Louis! Understand?"</p>

  <p>Evanie's gentle features went suddenly pale.</p>

  <p>"St. Louis!" she whispered. "St. Louis&mdash;the ancient name of Selui!
  Before the Dark Centuries&mdash;impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Not impossible&mdash;true," Connor said grimly. "Too painfully true."</p>

  <p>"Electrocution!" Evanie whispered awedly. "The Ancients' punishment!" She
  stared as if fascinated, then cried excitedly: "Could electrolepsis happen by
  accident? Could it? But no! A milliampere too much and the brain's destroyed;
  a millivolt too little and asepsis fails. Either way's death&mdash;but it has
  happened if what you are telling is the truth, Tom Connor! You must have
  experienced the impossible!"</p>

  <p>"And what is electrolepsis?" Connor asked, desperately calm.</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;it's the Sleep!" whispered the tense girl. "Electrical paralysis
  of the part of the brain before Rolando's Fissure. It's what the Sleepers
  use, but only for a century, or a very little more. This&mdash;this is
  fantastic! You have slept since before the Dark Centuries! Not less than a
  thousand years!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">3. FOREST MEETING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A week&mdash;the third since Connor's awakening to sane
  thought, had passed. He sat on a carved stone bench before Evanie's cottage
  and reveled in the burning canopy of stars and copper moon. He was living, if
  what he had been told was true&mdash;and he was forced to believe it
  now&mdash;after untold billions had passed into eternity.</p>

  <p>Evanie must have been right. He was convinced by her gentle insistence, by
  the queer English on every tongue, by a subtle difference in the very world
  about him. It wasn't the same world&mdash;quite.</p>

  <p>He sighed contentedly, breathing the cool night air. He had learned much
  of the new age from Evanie, though much was still mysteriously veiled. Evanie
  had spoken of the city of Urbs and the Master, but only vaguely. One day he
  asked her why.</p>

  <p>"Because"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"well, because it's best for you to
  form your own judgments. We&mdash;the people around here&mdash;are not fond
  of Urbs and the Immortals, and I would not like to influence you, Tom, for in
  all truth it's the partisans of the Master who have the best of it, not his
  enemies. Urbs is in power; it will probably remain in power long after our
  lifetimes, since it has ruled for seven centuries."</p>

  <p>Abruptly she withdrew something from her pocket and passed it to him. He
  bent over it&mdash;a golden disc, a coin. He made out the lettering "10
  Units," and the figure of a snake circling a globe, its tail in its
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"The Midgard Serpent," said Evanie. "I don't know why, but that's what
  it's called."</p>

  <p>Connor reversed the coin. There was revealed the embossed portrait of a
  man's head, whose features, even in miniature, looked cold, austere,
  powerful. Connor read:</p>

  <p>"Orbis Terrarum Imperator Dominusque Urbis."</p>

  <p><i>"Emperor of the World and Master of the City,"</i> he translated.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is the Master." Evanie's voice was serious as she took the
  coin. "This is the money of Urbs. To understand Urbs and the Master you must
  of course know something of history since your&mdash;sleep."</p>

  <p>"History?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Since the Dark Centuries. Some day one of our patriarchs will
  tell you more than I know. For I know little of your mighty ancient world. It
  seems to us an incredible age, with its vast cities, its fierce nations, its
  inconceivable teeming populations, its terrific energies and its flaming
  genius. Great wars, great industries, great art&mdash;and then great wars
  again."</p>

  <p>"But you can tell me&mdash;" Connor began, a little impatiently. Evanie
  shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not now," she said quickly. "For now I must hasten to friends who will
  discuss with me a matter of great moment. Perhaps some day you may learn of
  that, too."</p>

  <p>And she was gone before Tom Connor could say a word to detain her. He was
  left alone with his thoughts &mdash;clashing, devastating thoughts sometimes,
  for there was so much to be learned in this strange world into which he had
  been plunged.</p>

  <p>In so many ways it was a strange, new world, Connor thought, as he watched
  the girl disappear down the road that slanted from her hilltop home to the
  village. From where he sat on that bench of hewn stone he could glimpse the
  village at the foot of the hill&mdash;a group of buildings, low, of some
  white stone. All of the structures were classical, with pure Doric columns.
  Ormon was the name of the village, Evanie had said.</p>

  <p>All strange to him. Not only were the people so vastly at variance with
  those he had known, but the physical world was bewilderingly different.</p>

  <p>Gazing beyond the village, and bringing his attention back to the hills
  and the forests about him, Tom Connor wondered if they, too, would be
  different.</p>

  <p>He had to know.</p>

  <p>The springtime landscape beckoned. Connor's strength had returned to such
  an extent that he arose from his bench in the sun and headed toward the green
  of the forest stretching away behind Evanie's home. It was an enchanting
  prospect he viewed. The trees had the glistening new green of young foliage,
  and emerald green grass waved in the fields that stretched away down the
  hill-sides and carpeted the plains.</p>

  <p>Birds were twittering in the trees as he entered the forest&mdash;birds of
  all varieties, in profusion, with gaily-colored plumage. Their numbers and
  fearlessness would have surprised Connor had he not remembered something
  Evanie had told him. Urbs, she had said, had wiped out objectionable stinging
  insects, flies, corn-worms and the like, centuries ago, and the birds had
  helped. As had certain parasites that had been bred for the purpose.</p>

  <p>"They only had to let the birds increase," Evanie had said, "by destroying
  their chief enemy&mdash;the Egyptian cat; the house-cat. It was acclimatized
  here and running wild in the woods, so they bred a parasite&mdash;the
  Feliphage&mdash;which destroyed it. Since then there have been many birds,
  and fewer insects."</p>

  <p>It was pleasant to stroll through that green forest, to that bird
  orchestral accompaniment. The spring breeze touched Tom Connor's face
  lightly, and for the first time in his life he knew what it was to stroll in
  freedom, untouched by the pestiferous annoyance of mosquitoes, swarming gnats
  and midges, or other stinging insects that once had made the greenwood
  sometimes akin to purgatory.</p>

  <p>What a boon to humanity! Honey bees buzzed in the dandelions in the
  carpeting grass, and drank the sweetness from spring flowers, but no mites or
  flies buzzed about Connor's uncovered, upflung head as he swung along
  briskly.</p>

  <p>Connor did not know how far he had penetrated into the depths of the newly
  green woods when he found himself following the course of a small stream. Its
  silvery waters sparkled in the sunlight filtering through the trees as it
  moved along, lazily somnolent.</p>

  <p>Now and then he passed mossy and viny heaps of stones, interesting to him,
  since he knew, from what he had been told, that they were the sole reminders
  of ancient structures erected before the Dark Centuries. Those heaps of
  stones had once formed buildings in another, and long-gone age&mdash;his own
  age.</p>

  <p>Idly following the little stream, he came at last to a wide bend where the
  stream came down from higher ground to spill in a little splashing falls.</p>

  <p>He had just rounded the bend, his gaze on a clear, still pool beyond, when
  he stopped stockstill, his eyes widening incredulously.</p>

  <p>It was as if he were seeing spread before him a picture, well known in his
  memory, and now brought to animate life. Connor had thought himself alone in
  that wood, but he was not. Sharing it with him, there within short yards of
  where he stood, was the most beautiful creature on whom he had ever
  looked.</p>

  <p>It was hard to believe she was a living, breathing being and not a figment
  of his imagination. No sound had warned her of his approach and, sublimely
  unaware that she was not alone, she held the pose in which Connor had first
  seen her, like some lovely wood sprite&mdash;which she might be, in this
  increasingly astonishing new world.</p>

  <p>She was on her knees beside the darkly mirrored pool, supported by the
  slender arms and hands that looked alabaster white against the mossy bank on
  which she pressed. She was smiling down at her own reflection in the water
  &mdash;the famous Psyche painting which Connor so well re-membered, come to
  life!</p>

  <p>He was afraid to breathe, much less to speak, for fear of startling her.
  But when she turned her head and saw him, she showed no signs of being
  startled. Slowly she smiled and got gracefully to her feet, the clinging
  white Grecian draperies that swathed her, gently swaying in the breeze to
  outline a figure too perfect to be flesh and blood. It was accentuated by the
  silver cord that crossed beneath her breasts, as sparkling as her ink-black
  hair.</p>

  <p>But as she smiled at Connor, instantly in the depths of her sea-green eyes
  he saw no fear of him; but mockery.</p>

  <p>I did not know," she said, in a voice that held the resonance of a silvery
  bell, "that any Weeds ever cared enough about the beauties of Nature to
  penetrate so far into the forest."</p>

  <p>"I am not a Weed," Connor promptly disclaimed, as unconsciously he moved a
  step or two nearer her. He hoped that she would not vanish at the sound of
  his voice, or at his approach. "I am &mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stared at him a moment, then laughed. And the laughter, too, was
  mocking.</p>

  <p>"No need to tell me," she said airily. "I know. You are the Sleeper who
  was recently revived&mdash;with the great tale of having slept a thousand
  years. As if you were an Immortal!"</p>

  <p>In her laughter, her voice, was the lofty intimation that she, at least,
  believed nothing of the sort. Connor made no attempt to convince
  her&mdash;not then. He was too enthralled, merely gazing at her.</p>

  <p>"Are you one of the Immortals?" he asked, his own voice awed. "I have
  heard much of them."</p>

  <p>"There are many things more immortal," she said, half cryptically, half
  mockingly, "than the human to whom has been given immortality. Such Immortals
  know nothing of all that was known, or guessed, by the Greeks of long, long
  ages past."</p>

  <p>Again Connor stared at her. She spoke so confidently. And she looked...
  Could it be possible that the gods and goddesses, the sprites, of that long-
  dead Greek age were not legends, after all, but living entities? Could it be
  possible that he was gazing at one now&mdash;and that she might vanish at a
  touch, at a word?</p>

  <p>She seemed real enough, though, and there was a certain imperiousness in
  her manner that was not his idea of what should be the reaction of any lovely
  sprite straight out of the pages of mythology. None of it seemed
  real&mdash;except her extravagant, pulse-warming beauty.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">4. A BIT OF ANCIENT HISTORY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The girl's words snapped him out of his reverie, with the
  confused knowledge that he was staring at her inanely as she stood there,
  swaying slightly, like a slender reed, while the gentle breeze whipped her
  white, gauzy draperies.</p>

  <p>"Come," she said peremptorily. "Come sit beside me here. I have come to
  the forest to find adventure that I cannot find elsewhere in a boring world.
  I have not found it. Come, you shall amuse me. Sit here and tell me this
  story I have been hearing about your&mdash;sleep."</p>

  <p>Half-hypnotically, Connor obeyed. Nor did he question why. It was all in a
  line with the rest, that he should find himself here above the sparkling dark
  pool, beside this woman&mdash;or girl, rather, since she could be no more
  than eighteen&mdash;whose beauty was starkly incredible.</p>

  <p>The sun, filtering through the leaves, touched her mass of hair, so black
  that it glinted blue as it fell in waving cascades below her slender waist.
  Her skin, magnolia-tinted, was all the clearer because of the startling ebony
  of her hair. Her beauty was more than a lack of flaws; it was, in true fact,
  goddesslike. But sultry, flaming. Her perfect lips seemed constantly smiling,
  but like the smile in her emerald eyes, it was sardonic, mocking.</p>

  <p>For one moment the beauty of this wood sprite, come upon so unexpectedly,
  swept all other thoughts from Connor's mind; even memory of Evanie. But the
  next moment Evanie was back, filling his thoughts as she had from the first
  with her cool, understandable, coppery-haired loveliness. But even in that
  moment he knew that the radiant creature beside him, so different from Evanie
  and other Weed girls he had seen, would forever haunt him. Whoever, whatever
  she might be&mdash;human being or wood goddess.</p>

  <p>The girl grew impatient at his silence.</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" she said imperiously. "I have said to you, I would be amused.
  Tell me&mdash;Sleeper."</p>

  <p>"I am no Sleeper&mdash;of the type of which you probably have customarily
  heard," Connor said, obedient to her command. "Whatever has come to me has
  been none of my doing; nor by my wishes. It was like this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Briefly he recited his experience, all that he knew of it, making no
  dramatic effort. He must have been impressive, for as he talked, he could see
  the incredulity and mockery pass from her sea-green eyes, to be replaced by
  reluctant belief, then astonishment.</p>

  <p>"It is almost unbelievable," she said softly, when he had finished. "But I
  do believe you." Her marvelous eyes held a far-away expression. "If in your
  memory you have retained knowledge of your own ancient times, great things
  await you in this age to which you have come."</p>

  <p>"But I know nothing about this age!" Connor quickly complained. "I glean
  snatches of this and that, of some mysterious Immortals who seem to reign
  supreme, of many things alien to me and my understanding. But so far, I have
  not been able to learn much about this age. No! Nor do I even know anything
  of the history of the ages that have passed while I was&mdash;sleeping!"</p>

  <p>Connor's wood sprite looked hard at him a moment, admiration for him plain
  in her low-lidded glance. The mockery flickered a moment in her eyes; then
  died.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you?" she asked. "We of the woods and valleys know many
  things. We learn as the cycles of years go by. But not always do we pass our
  knowledge along."</p>

  <p>"Please!" begged Connor. "Please tell me&mdash;everything. I am lost!"</p>

  <p>She seemed a little uncertain where to begin, then suddenly started to
  talk as if giving an all-inclusive lesson in history from the beginning of
  time.</p>

  <p>"You of the ancient world had great cities," she said. "Today there are
  mighty cities, too. N'York had eight millions of people; Urbs, the great
  metropolis of this age, has thirty millions. But where there is now one
  metropolis, your world had a hundred. A marvelous age, that time of yours,
  but it ended. Some time in your Twentieth Century, it went out in a blaze of
  war."</p>

  <p>"The Twentieth Century!" exclaimed Connor. "So near my time!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Your fierce, warlike nations sated their lust for battle at last in
  one gigantic war that spread like a cloud around the planet. They fought by
  sea, by land, by air, and beneath sea and land. They fought with weapons
  whose secrets are still lost, with strange chemistries, with diseases. Every
  nation was caught in the struggle; all their vast knowledge went into it, and
  city after giant city was destroyed by atomic bombs or annihilated by
  infected water supplies. Famine stalked the world, and after it swept swift
  pestilence.</p>

  <p>"But, by the fiftieth year after the war, the world had reached a sort of
  stability. Then came barbarism. The old nations had fallen, and in their
  place came number-less little city-states, little farming communities each
  sufficient to itself, weaving its own cloth, raising its own food. And then
  the language began to change."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Connor. "Children speak like their parents."</p>

  <p>"Not eractly," said the wood sprite, with a slow smile. "Language evolves
  by laws. Here's one: Consonants tend to move forward in the mouth as
  languages age. Take the word `mother.' In the ancient Tokhar, it was
  <i>makar</i>. Then the Latin, <i>mater</i>. Then <i>madre</i>, then mother
  and now our modern word muvver. Do you see?
  K&mdash;T&mdash;D&mdash;Th&mdash;V&mdash;each sound a little advanced in the
  throat. The ultimate of course, is mama&mdash;pure labial sounds, which
  proves only that it's the oldest word in the world."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Connor.</p>

  <p>"Well, once it was released from the bonds of printing, language changed.
  It became difficult to read the old books, and then books began to vanish.
  Fire gutted the abandoned cities; the robber bands that lurked there burned
  books by winter for warmth. Worms and decay ruined them. Precious knowledge
  vanished, some of it forever."</p>

  <p>She paused a moment, watching Connor keenly. "Do you see now," she asked,
  "why I said greatness awaits you if you retain any, of your ancient
  knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said Connor. "But go on, please."</p>

  <p>"Other factors, too, were at work," she said, nodding. "In the first
  place, a group of small city-states seems to be the best environment for
  genius. That was the situation in Greece during the Golden Age, in Italy
  during the Renaissance, and all over the world before the Second
  Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>"Then too, a period of barbarism seems to act as a time of rest for
  humanity before a charge to new heights. The Stone Age flared suddenly into
  the light of Egypt, Persia decayed and Greece flowered, and the Middle Ages
  awoke to the glory of the Renaissance. So the Dark Centuries began to flame
  into the brilliant age of the Second Enlightenment, the fourth great dawn in
  human history.</p>

  <p>"It began quietly enough, about two centuries after the war. A young man
  named John Holland drifted into the village of N'Orleans that sprawled beside
  the ancient city's ruins. He found the remnants of a library,
  and&mdash;unusual in his day&mdash;he could read. He studied alone at first,
  but soon others joined him, and the Academy came into being.</p>

  <p>"The townspeople thought the students wizards and sorcerers, but as
  knowledge grew the words wizard and sorcerer became synonyms for what your
  age called scientists."</p>

  <p>"I see!" muttered Connor, and he was thinking of Evanie the Sorceress. "I
  see!"</p>

  <p>"N'Orleans," said his charming enlightener, "became the center of the
  Enlightenment. Holland died, but the Academy lived, and one day a young
  student named Teran had a vision. Some of the ancient knowledge had by now
  yielded its secrets, and Teran's vision was to restore the ancient N'Orleans
  power plants and water systems&mdash;to give the city its utilities!</p>

  <p>"Although there was no apparent source of fuel, he and his group labored
  diligently on the centuries-old machines, confident that power would be at
  hand when they needed it.</p>

  <p>"And it was. A man named Einar Olin, had wandered over the continent
  seeking&mdash;and finding&mdash;the last and greatest achievement of the
  Ancients; he rediscovered atomic energy. N'Orleans wakened anew to its
  ancient life. Across plains and mountains came hundreds just to see the Great
  City, and among these were three on whom history turned.</p>

  <p>"These were sandy-haired Martin Sair, and black-haired Joaquin Smith, and
  his sister. Some have called her Satanically beautiful. The Black Flame, they
  call her now&mdash;have you heard?"</p>

  <p>Connor shook his head, his eyes drinking in the beauty of this woman of
  the woods, who fascinated him in a manner he would never have believed
  possible.</p>

  <p>For a moment the mocking glint came back in the girl's eyes, then
  instantly it was gone as she shrugged her white shoulders and went on.</p>

  <p>"Those three changed the whole course of history. Martin Sair turned to
  biology and medicine when he joined the half-monastic Academy, and his genius
  made the first new discovery to add to the knowledge of the Ancients.
  Studying evolution, experimenting with hard radiations, he found sterility
  then&mdash;immortality!</p>

  <p>"Joaquin Smith found his field in the neglected social sciences,
  government, economics, psychology. He too had a dream&mdash;of rebuilding the
  old world. He was&mdash;or is&mdash;a colossal genius. He took Martin Sail's
  immortality and traded it for power. He traded immortality to Jorgensen for a
  rocket that flew on the atomic blast, to Kohlmar for a weapon, to Erden for
  the Erden resonator that explodes gunpowder miles away. And then he gathered
  his army and marched."</p>

  <p>"War again!" Connor said tightly. "I should have thought they would have
  had enough."</p>

  <p>But the girl did not heed him. In her emerald eyes was a light as if she
  were seeing visions herself&mdash;visions of glorious conquest.</p>

  <p>"N'Orleans," she said, "directly in the light of Joaquin Smith's magnetic
  personality, yielded gladly. Other cities yielded almost as if fascinated,
  while those who fought were overcome. What chance had rifle and arrow against
  the flying Triangles of Jorgensen, or Kohlmar's ionic beams? And Joaquin
  Smith himself was&mdash;well, magnificent. Even the wives of the slain
  cheered him when he comforted them in that noble manner of his.</p>

  <p>"America was conquered within sixty years. Immortality gave Smith, the
  Master, power, and no one save Martin Sair and those he taught has ever been
  able to learn its secret. Thousands have tried, many have claimed success,
  but the results of their failures still haunt the world.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;well, Joaquin Smith has his World Empire now; not America
  alone. He has bred out criminals and the feeble-minded, he has impressed his
  native English on every tongue, he has built Urbs, the vast, glittering,
  brilliant, wicked world capital, and there he rules with his sister, Margaret
  of Urbs,, beside him. Yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should think this world he conquered would worship him!" exclaimed
  Connor.</p>

  <p>"Worship him!" cried the girl. "Too many hate him, in spite of all he has
  done, not only for this age, but for ages gone&mdash;since the Enlightenment.
  He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Tom Connor was no longer listening. All his thoughts, his attention,
  his eyes that drank in her beauty, were on the girl. So lovely&mdash;and to
  have so much wisdom stored up in the brain beneath the sheen of that satiny-
  black cap that was her hair. There could only be one answer to that. She must
  be a goddess, come to life.</p>

  <p>He ached to touch her, to touch only the hem of her gauzy garment, but
  that must not be. His heart pounded at the very nearness of her&mdash;but it
  was with a worship that could have thrown him prostrate at her feet.</p>

  <p>"It's all like a dream, what you've told me," he said, his voice far-
  away, musing. "You're a dream."</p>

  <p>The dancing light of mockery came back into her sea-green eyes.</p>

  <p>"Shall we leave it a dream&mdash;this meeting of ours?" she asked softly.
  She laid one white hand lightly on his arm and he thrilled at the touch as
  though an electric current had shot through him&mdash;but not a painful
  annihilating one now. "Man of the Ancients," she said, "will you give me a
  promise?"</p>

  <p>"Anything&mdash;anything!" Connor said eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Then promise me you will say nothing, not even to the Weed girl who is
  called Evanie the Sorceress, about having seen me this morning. No slightest
  hint."</p>

  <p>For a moment Connor hesitated. Would it be disloyalty to Evanie, in any
  way, to make that promise? He did not know. What he did know was that it fell
  in with his own ideas to keep this meeting a secret&mdash;like something
  sacred; something to hold as a memory deep within his own heart only.</p>

  <p>"Promise?" she repeated, in that silvery-bell voice.</p>

  <p>Connor nodded. "I promise," he said soberly. "But tell me, will I see you
  again? Will you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly the girl leaped lightly to her feet, startled, as she stood
  listening, like the faun she appeared to be. Her astonishing emerald eyes
  were wide, as she poised for flight. Dimly, the entranced Connor became aware
  of voices back in the woods. Men were probably coming to seek him, knowing
  how sick he had been.</p>

  <p>"I must go!" the girl whispered quickly. "But Man of the Ancients, we
  <i>shall</i> meet again! That is my promise. Keep yours!"</p>

  <p>And then, before he could speak, she had whirled like a butterfly in
  flight, and was speeding through the woods on noiseless feet. Connor caught
  one last glimpse of her fluttering white draperies against the brown and
  green of tree trunks and leaves, then she was gone.</p>

  <p>He passed a hand slowly before his bewildered eyes. A dream! But she had
  promised they would meet again. When?</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">5. THE VILLAGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Days slipped imperceptibly by. Connor had almost regained
  his full strength. Time and again, whenever he could do so unobserved, he
  slipped away to the woods alone, but never again did he catch sight of the
  wood nymph who had so deeply fascinated him. Gradually he came to persuade
  himself that the whole incident had been a dream. Many things as strange had
  happened to him since his awakening. Only one thing gave it the semblance of
  reality&mdash;the knowledge he had gleaned from the inky-haired girl of
  mystery, a knowledge later confirmed when he began to enter the peaceful life
  of the village.</p>

  <p>Aside from Evanie, however, he had but one other close friend. He had
  taken at once to Jan Orm, engineer and operator of the village of Ormon's
  single factory on the hill.</p>

  <p>The factory was a perpetual surprise to Connor. The incredibly versatile
  machines made nearly everything except the heavier mechanisms used in the
  fields, and these, he learned, could have been made. That was not necessary
  since the completed machines could as easily be transported as the steel
  necessary to construct them.</p>

  <p>The atomic power amazed Tom Connor. The motors burned only water, or
  rather the hydrogen in it, and the energy was the product of synthesis rather
  than disintegration. Four hydrogen atoms, with their weight of 1.008,
  combined into one helium atom, with a weight of 4; somewhere had disappeared
  the difference of .032, and this was the source of that abundant
  energy&mdash;matter being destroyed, weight transformed to energy.</p>

  <p>There was a whole series of atomic furnaces, too. The release of energy
  was a process of one degree, like radium; once started, neither temperature
  nor pressure could speed or slow it in the least. But the hydrogen burned
  steadily into helium at the uniform rate of half its mass in three hundred
  days.</p>

  <p>Jan Orm was proud of the plant.</p>

  <p>"Neat, isn't it?" he asked Connor. "One of the type called Omnifac; makes
  anything. There's thousands of 'em about the country; practically make each
  town independent, self-sustaining. We don't need your ancient cumbersome
  railroad system to transport coal and ore."</p>

  <p>"How about the metal you use?"</p>

  <p>"Nor metal either," Jan said. "Just as there was a stone age, a bronze
  age, and an iron age, just as history calls your time the age of steel, we're
  in the aluminum age. And aluminum's everywhere; it's the base of all clays,
  almost eight per cent of the Earth's crust."</p>

  <p>"I know it's there," grunted Connor. "It used to cost too much to get it
  out of clay."</p>

  <p>"Well, power costs nothing now. Water's free." His face darkened moodily.
  "If we could only <i>control</i> the rate, but power comes out at always the
  same rate&mdash;a half period of three hundred days. If we could build
  rockets&mdash;like the Triangles of Urbs. The natural rate is just too slow
  to lift its own weight; the power from a pound of water comes out too
  gradually to raise a one-pound mass. The Urban know how to increase the rate,
  to make the water deliver half its energy in a hundred days &mdash;ten
  days."</p>

  <p>"And if you could build rockets?"</p>

  <p>"Then," said Jan, growing even moodier, "then we'd&mdash;" He paused
  abruptly. "We <i>can</i> detonate it," he said in a changed voice. "We
  <i>can</i> get all the energy it one terrific blast, but that's useless for a
  rocket."</p>

  <p>"Why can't you use a firing chamber and explode say a gram of water at a
  time?" Connor asked. "A rapid series of little explosions should be just as
  effective as a continuous blast."</p>

  <p>"My father tried that," Jan Or said grimly. "He's buried at the bend of
  the river."</p>

  <p>Later, Connor asked Evanie why Ian was so anxious to develop atom-powered
  rockets. The girl turned suddenly serious eyes on him, but made no direct
  reply.</p>

  <p>"The Immortals guard the secret of the Triangle," was all she said. "It's
  a military secret."</p>

  <p>"But what could he do with a rocket?"</p>

  <p>She shook her glistening hair.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Evanie," he said soberly, "I don't like to feel that you won't trust me.
  I know from what you've said that you're somehow opposed to the government.
  Well, I'll help you, if I but I can't if you keep me in ignorance."</p>

  <p>The girl was silent.</p>

  <p>"And another thing," he proceeded. "This immortality process. I've heard
  somebody say that the results of its failures when some tried it, still haunt
  the world? Why, Evanie?"</p>

  <p>Swiftly a crimson flush spread over the girl's cheeks and throat.</p>

  <p>"Now what the devil have I said?" he cried. "Evanie, I swear I wouldn't
  hurt you, for the world!"</p>

  <p>"Don't," she only murmured, turning silently away.</p>

  <p>He, too, was hurt, because she was. He knew he owed his life to her for
  her treatments and hospitality. It disturbed him to think he knew of no way
  in which to repay her. But he was dubious of his ability to earn much as an
  engineer in this world of strange devices.</p>

  <p>"I'd have to start right at the bottom," he observed ruefully to Evanie
  when he spoke of that later.</p>

  <p>"In Urbs," Evanie said, "you'd be worth your weight in radium as a source
  of ancient knowledge. So much has been lost; so much is gone, perhaps
  forever. Often we have only the record of a great man's name, and no trace of
  his work. Of these is a man named Einstein and another named de Sitter
  acknowledged to be supreme geniuses of science even by the supreme scientists
  of your age. Their work is lost."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it will remain lost, then," he said whimsically. "Both
  Einstein and de Sitter were contemporaries of mine, but I wasn't up to
  understanding their theories. All I know is that they dealt with space and
  time, and a supposed curvature of space&mdash;Relativity, the theory was
  called."</p>

  <p>"But that's exactly the clue they'd want in Urbs!" exclaimed Evanie, her
  eyes shining. "That's all they need. And think of what you could tell them of
  ancient literature! We haven't the artists and writers you had&mdash;not yet.
  The plays of a man named Shakespeare are still the most popular of all on the
  vision broadcasts. I always watch them." She looked up wistfully. "Was he
  also a contemporary of yours? And did you know a philosopher named
  Aristotle?"</p>

  <p>Connor laughed.</p>

  <p>"I missed the one by three centuries and the other by twenty-five!" he
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said the girl, flushing red. "I don't know much of
  history."</p>

  <p>He smiled warmly.</p>

  <p>"If I thought I could actually earn something&mdash;if I could pay you for
  all the trouble I've been, I'd go to the city of Urbs for awhile&mdash;and
  then come back here. I'd like to pay you."</p>

  <p>"Pay me?" she asked in surprise. "We don't use money here, except for
  taxes."</p>

  <p>"Taxes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The Urban taxes. They come each year to collect, and it must be paid
  in money." She frowned angrily. "I hate Urbs and all it stands for! I hate
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Are the taxes so oppressively high?"</p>

  <p>"Oppressive?" she retorted. "Any tax is oppressive! It's a difference in
  degree, that's all! As long as a government has the right to tax, the
  potential injustice is there. And what of other rights the Master arrogated
  to himself?" She paused as if to let the full enormity of that strike in.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said carelessly, "that's been a privilege granted to the heads
  of many governments, hasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes blazed. "I can't understand a man who's willing to surrender his
  natural rights!" she flared. "Our men would die for a principle!"</p>

  <p>"But they're not doing it," observed Connor caustically.</p>

  <p>"Because they'd be throwing their lives away uselessly &mdash;that's why!
  They can't fight the Master now with any chance of success. But just wait
  until the time comes!"</p>

  <p>"And then, I suppose, the whole world will be just one great big beautiful
  state of anarchy."</p>

  <p>"And isn't that an ideal worth fighting for?" asked the girl hotly. "To
  permit every single individual to attain his rightful liberty? To destroy
  every chance of injustice?"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Connor paused, considering. Why should he be arguing like this with
  Evanie? He felt no allegiance to the government of Urbs; the Master meant
  nothing to him. The only government he could have fought for, died for, was
  lost a thousand years in the past. Whatever loyalty he owed in this
  topsy-turvy age belonged to Evanie. He grinned. "Crazy or not, Evanie," he
  promised, "your cause is mine!"</p>

  <p>She softened suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Tom." Then, in lower tones, "Now you know why Jan Orm is so
  anxious for the secret of the rocket blast. Do you see?" Her voice dropped to
  a whisper. "Revolution!"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I guessed that. But since you've answered one question,
  perhaps you'll answer my other one. What are the failures that still haunt
  the world, the products of the immortality treatment?"</p>

  <p>Again that flush of unhappiness.</p>

  <p>"He meant&mdash;the metamorphs," she murmured softly. Quickly she rose and
  passed into the cottage.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">6. THE METAMORPHS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Connor's strength swiftly approached normal, and shortly
  little remained of that unbelievable sojourn in the grave. His month's
  grizzle of beard began to be irritating, and one day he asked Jan for a
  razor.</p>

  <p>Jan seemed puzzled; at Connor's explanation he laughed, and produced a jar
  of salve that quickly dissolved the stubble, assuring Connor that the
  preparation would soon destroy the growth entirely.</p>

  <p>But Evanie's reaction surprised him. She stared for a moment without
  recognition.</p>

  <p>"Tom!" she cried. "You look&mdash;you look like an ancient statue!"</p>

  <p>He did look different from the mild-featured villagers. With the beard
  removed, his lean face had an aura of strength and ruggedness that was quite
  unlike the appearance of his neighbors.</p>

  <p>Time slipped pleasantly away. Evenings he spent talking to newly made
  friends, relating stories of his dead age, explaining the state of politics,
  society, and science in that forgotten time. Often Evanie joined in the
  conversation, though at other times she amused herself at the "vision," a
  device of remarkable perfection, on whose two-foot screen actors in distant
  cities spoke and moved with the naturalness of miniature life.</p>

  <p>Connor himself saw "Winter's Tale" and "Henry the Eighth" given in
  accurate portrayal, and was once surprised to discover a familiar-seeming
  musical comedy, complete to scantily-clad chorus. In many ways Evanie puzzled
  Tom Connor. There was some mystery about her that he could not understand.
  Life in Ormon, it seemed to him, was essentially what it had been in his old
  days in St. Louis. Young men still followed immemorial routine; each evening
  saw them walking, sitting, talking, with girls, idling through the parklike
  arcades of trees, strolling along the quiet river.</p>

  <p>But not Evanie. No youth ever climbed the hill to her cottage, or sat with
  her at evening&mdash;except when Jan Orm occasionally came. And this seemed
  strange, considering the girl's loveliness. Connor couldn't remember a more
  attractive girl than this spirited, gentle, demure Evanie&mdash;except his
  girl of the woods. Not even Ruth of the buried days of the past.</p>

  <p>He mused over the matter until a more sensational mystery effaced it.
  Evanie went hunting game up-river. Deer were fairly plentiful, and
  game-birds, wild turkeys, and pheasants had increased until they were nearly
  as common as crows once had been.</p>

  <p>The trio carried glistening bows of spring steel that flung slender steel
  arrows with deadly accuracy, if used properly. Connor was awkward, but Evanie
  and Jan Orm handled them with skill. Connor bemoaned the lack of rifles; he
  had been a fair marksman in the old days.</p>

  <p>"I'd show you!" he declared. "If I only had my Marlin repeater!"</p>

  <p>"Guns aren't made any more," said Jan. "The Erden Resonator finished them;
  they're useless for military weapons."</p>

  <p>"But for hunting?"</p>

  <p>"They're banned by law. For a while after the founding of the Urban Empire
  people kept 'em hidden around, but no one knew when a resonator might sweep
  the section, and folks got tired of having the things go off at night,
  smashing windows and plowing walls. They weren't safe house-pets."</p>

  <p>"Well," grumbled Connor, "I'd like one now, even an air-rifle. Say!" he
  exclaimed. "Why not a water-gun?"</p>

  <p>"A water-gun?"</p>

  <p>"One run by atomic energy. Didn't you say you could detonate it&mdash;get
  all the power out at once?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;" Jan Orm paused. "By God!" he roared. "That's the answer!
  That's the weapon! Why didn't anybody think of that before? There's what we
  need to&mdash;" He broke his sentence in mid-air.</p>

  <p>Evanie smiled. "It's all right," she said. "Tom knows."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Connor, "and I'm with you in your revolutionary
  ambitions."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad," Jan Orm said simply. His eyes lighted. "That gun! It's a
  stroke of genius. The resonators can't damage an atom-powered rifle! Evanie,
  the time draws near!"</p>

  <p>The three proceeded thoughtfully up the river bank. The midsummer sun beat
  down upon them with withering intensity. Connor mopped his streaming
  brow.</p>

  <p>"How I'd like a swim," he ejaculated. "Evanie, do you people ever swim
  here? That place where the river's backed up by that fallen bridge&mdash;it
  should be a great place for a dip!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" the girl said quickly. "Why should we swim? You can bathe every
  day in the pool at home."</p>

  <p>That was true. The six-foot basin where water, warmed to a pleasant
  tepidity by atomic heat, bubbled steadily through, was always available. But
  it was a poor substitute for swimming in open water.</p>

  <p>"That little lake looked tempting," Connor sighed.</p>

  <p>"The lake!" cried Evanie, in horror. "Oh, no! No! You can't swim
  there!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"You just can't!"</p>

  <p>And that was as much information as he could obtain. Shortly afterward,
  swinging the half-dozen birds that had fallen to their arrows, they started
  back for the village.</p>

  <p>But Connor was determined to ferret out at least that one
  mystery&mdash;why he should not swim in the lake. The next time he
  accompanied Jan Orm on a tramp up-river, he plied Jan with questions. But it
  was futile. He could extract no more from Jan Orm than he had from
  Evanie.</p>

  <p>As the pair approached the place of the ruined bridge that dammed the
  stream, they turned a little way inland. Jan's keen eyes spotted a movement
  in a thick copse.</p>

  <p>"Deer in there," he whispered. "Let's separate and start him."</p>

  <p>He bore off to the left, and Connor, creeping cautiously to the right,
  approached the grass-grown bank of the watercourse. Suddenly he stopped
  short. Ahead of him the sun had glinted on something large and brown and wet,
  and he heard a rustle of movement. He moved stealthily forward; with utmost
  care he separated a screen of brush, and gazed through it to a little open
  glade, and on the creature that sprawled there beside the water.</p>

  <p>At first he saw only a five-foot strip of wet, hairless, oily skin that
  heaved to the thing's slow breathing. He held his bow ready lest it prove
  dangerous, and stared, wondering what sort of creature it could be. It was
  certainly nothing native to the North America of his day. And then, at some
  sound or movement of his, the beast rolled over and faced him.</p>

  <p>Connor felt sick. He glimpsed short, incredibly thick limbs, great splay
  feet with webbed toes, broad hands with webbed fingers. But what sickened him
  was the smooth bulbous face with its tiny eyes and little round red-lipped
  mouth.</p>

  <p>The thing was, or had been, human!</p>

  <p>Connor let out a choking yell. The creature, with a mumble that might have
  been speech, flopped awkwardly to the bank and into the water, where it
  cleaved the element like an otter and disappeared with a long, silent
  wake.</p>

  <p>He heard the crashing of Jan Orm's approach, and his cry of inquiry. But a
  webbed print in the mud of the bank told Jan Orm the story.</p>

  <p>"Wh&mdash;what was it?" Connor choked.</p>

  <p>"A metamorph," said Jan soberly.</p>

  <p>Empty-handed as they were, he turned homeward. Connor, too aghast to press
  questions, followed him. And then came the second mystery.</p>

  <p>Connor saw it first&mdash;a face, a child's face, peering at them from a
  leafy covert. But this was no human child. Speechless, Connor saw the small
  pointed ears that twitched, the pointed teeth, the black slanting eyes
  squinting at him beadily. The face was that of a young satyr, a child of Pan.
  It was the spirit of the wilderness incarnate, not evil exactly, not even
  savage, but just wild &mdash;wild!</p>

  <p>The imp vanished instantly. As Connor gasped, "What's that?" it was
  already far beyond arrow-shot, headed for the forest. Jan viewed it without
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"It's a young metamorph," he said. "A different sort than the one at the
  lake." He paused and stared steadily into Connor's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Promise me something," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"That you'll not tell Evanie you saw these things."</p>

  <p>"If you wish," said Connor slowly. It was all beyond him.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">7. PANATE BLOOD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But Tom Connor was determined now to fathom these mysteries.
  Jan should no longer put him off. He stopped and placed a hand firmly on
  Jan's arm, forced the man to look into his eyes when Jan would have evaded
  his gaze.</p>

  <p>"Just what," he said bluntly, "is a metamorph? You must tell me, Jan!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's uncomfortable silence.</p>

  <p>"That question has been evaded long enough," Connor said firmly, "and I
  intend to know why. This is my world now. I've got to live in it, and I want
  to know what others know of it&mdash;its faults as well as its virtues. Why
  have you shunned the question?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because of Evanie!" supplied Connor.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Jan agreed, reluctantly. "Because of Evanie."</p>

  <p>"What has that monster at the lake to do with her?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing directly." Jan Orm paused. "Before I tell you more, Tom, I'm
  going to ask you something. Do you love Evanie?"</p>

  <p>"I'm very fond of her."</p>

  <p>"But do you love her?" Jan insisted.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Connor suddenly. "I do."</p>

  <p>A swift thought had come to him before he had reached that decision. The
  vision of a smiling wood nymph was before his eyes. But only a human being
  could be loved by a man&mdash;a coolly lovely girl like Evanie; not a
  goddess.</p>

  <p>"Why do the youths of Ormon ignore Evanie so, Jan?" Connor asked abruptly.
  "She's far the loveliest girl in town."</p>

  <p>"So she is, Tom. It's her own doing that they ignore her. They have tried
  to be friends with her&mdash;have tried hard. But she&mdash;well, she has
  always discouraged them."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because, I think, she feels that in justice to everybody she can't
  marry."</p>

  <p>"And again why?"</p>

  <p>For a long moment Jan Orm hesitated. "I'll tell you," he said finally.
  "She's one-eighth metamorph!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, her mother was the daughter of Montmerci the Anadominist. A great
  man, but half metamorph."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," asked Connor, aghast, "that she has the blood of that lake
  monster in her?"</p>

  <p>"No! oh, no! There are two kinds of metamorphs. One sort, the Panate
  metamorph, is human; the others, the amphimorphs, are just&mdash;horrors.
  Evanie's blood is Panate.</p>

  <p>But she had conquered her metamorphic heredity." "A metamorph!" Connor
  groaned.</p>

  <p>The picture of that flopping horror rose in his mind, and then the vision
  of the wild, impish face of the woods child. There was something reminiscent
  of Evanie in that, the color of her bronze hair, an occasional glint in her
  deep eyes.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said huskily, "about that heredity of hers. Might her child,
  for instance, turn wild? Or turn into such a horror as
  an&mdash;amphimorph?"</p>

  <p>Jan Orm smiled.</p>

  <p>"By no chance! The Panate metamorphs, I tell you, are human. They're
  people. They're much like us&mdash;good and bad, brilliant and stupid, and
  many of them surpassingly beautiful in their wild way."</p>

  <p>"But just what are they? Where'd they come from?"</p>

  <p>"Do you remember hearing Martin Sair mentioned? He was companion of the
  Master, Evanie's great-uncle thirty generations removed."</p>

  <p>"The discoverer of immortality? I remember."</p>

  <p>But Connor made no mention of when he had first heard of both Martin Sair
  and the Master&mdash;from an uncannily beautiful wood sprite who had seemed
  to possess all the wisdom of the ages.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Jan told him. "And you must have heard, too, that there were other
  attempts at making men immortal, in the first century of the Enlightenment.
  And failures. Some that still haunt the world. Well the metamorphs are those
  failures."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Connor slowly.</p>

  <p>"They're a mutation, an artificial mutation," Jan explained. "When Martin
  Sair's discovery became known, thousands sought to imitate him. It was
  understood that he was working with hard radiations, but just what was a
  mystery&mdash;whether as hard as the cosmic rays or as soft as the harder x-
  rays. Nevertheless, many charlatans claimed to be able to give immortality,
  and there were thousands of eager victims. It was a mania, a wave of lunacy.
  The laboratories of the tricksters were packed.</p>

  <p>"There were four directions of error to be made; those who had not Sair's
  secret, erred in all four. People who were treated with too hard radiations
  died; those treated with too soft rays simply became sterile. Those treated
  with the right rays, but for too long a time, remained themselves unchanged,
  but bore amphimorphs as children; those treated for too short a time bore
  Panate meta-morphs.</p>

  <p>"Can you imagine the turmoil? In a world just emerging from barbarism,
  still disorganized, of course some of the freaks survived. Near the sea
  coasts amphimorphs began to appear, and in lakes and rivers; while in the
  hills and forests the Children of Nature, the Panate type, went trouping
  through the wilderness."</p>

  <p>"But why weren't they exterminated?" asked Connor tensely. "You've bred
  out criminals. Why let these creatures exist. Why not kill them off?"</p>

  <p>"Would <i>you</i> favor such a measure?"</p>

  <p>"No," Connor said, adding in impassioned tone: "It would be nothing less
  than murder, even to kill the swimmers! Are they&mdash;intelligent?"</p>

  <p>"In a dim fashion. The amphimorphs are creatures cast back to the
  amphibious stage of the human embryo&mdash;just above the gilled period. The
  others, the Panates, are strange. Except for an odd claustrophobia, the fear
  of enclosed things&mdash;of houses or clothing&mdash;they're quite as
  intelligent as most of us. And they're comparatively harmless."</p>

  <p>Connor heaved a sigh of relief. "Then they aren't a problem?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there were consequences," Jan said wryly. "Their women are often very
  beautiful, like the marble figures of nymphs dug up in Europe. There have
  been many cases like Evanie's. Many of us may have a drop or so of
  metamorphic blood. But it falls hardest on the first offspring, the hybrids,
  miserable creatures unable to endure civilized life, and often most unhappy
  in the wilds. Yet even these occasionally produce a genius. Evanie's
  grandfather is one."</p>

  <p>"What did he do?"</p>

  <p>"He was known as Montmerci the Anadominist, half human, half metamorph.
  Yet his was a powerful personality. He was strong enough to lead an abortive
  revolution against the Master. Both humans and metamorphs followed him. He
  even managed to direct a group of amphimorphs, who got into the city's water
  supply and erupted into the sewers by hundreds."</p>

  <p>"But what happened to the revolution?"</p>

  <p>"It was quickly suppressed," Jan said bitterly. "What could a horde armed
  with bows and knives do against the Rings and ionic beams of Urbs?"</p>

  <p>t "And Montmerci?"</p>

  <p>"He was executed&mdash;a rare punishment. But the Master realized the
  danger from this wild metamorph. A second attempt might have been successful.
  That's why Evanie hates Urbs so intensely."</p>

  <p>"Evanie!" Connor said musingly. "Tell me, what was it that led to her
  father's marrying a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A cross? Well, Evan Sair was like Evanie, a doctor. He came upon Meria,
  the daughter of Montmerci, down in the mountain region called Ozarky. He
  found her there sick just after the collapse of the uprising. So Evan Sair
  cared for her and fell in love with her. He brought her here to his home, and
  married her, but she soon began to weaken again from lack of the open woods
  and sun-light.</p>

  <p>"She died when Evanie was born, but she would have died anyway."</p>

  <p>Jan Orm paused and drew a long breath. "Now do you see why Evanie fears
  her own blood? Why she has driven away the youths who tried to arouse even
  friendship? She's afraid of the sleeping metamorphic nature in her, and
  needlessly afraid, since she's safely human. She has even tried to drive me
  away, but I refuse to be so driven. I understand."</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Connor soberly. "And I'm going to marry her."</p>

  <p>Jan Orm smiled dryly. "And if she thinks otherwise?"</p>

  <p>"Then I must convince her."</p>

  <p>Jan shook his head in mild wonderment. "Perhaps you can," he said, with
  the barest hint of reluctance. "There's something dynamic about you. In some
  ways you're like the Immortals of Urbs."</p>

  <p>When they reached the village Connor left Jan Orm and trudged in a deep
  reverie up Evanie's hill, musing on the curious revelations he had heard,
  analyzing his own feelings. Did he really love the bronze-haired Evanie? The
  query had never presented itself until Jan had put it to him, so bluntly, yet
  now he was certain he did. Admitting that, then&mdash;had he the right to ask
  her to marry a survival of the past, a revivified mummy, a sort of living
  fossil?</p>

  <p>What damage might that millennium of sleep have done him? Might he not
  awake some morning to find the weight of his years suddenly upon him? Might
  he not disintegrate like a veritable mummy when its wrappings were removed?
  Still he had never felt stronger or healthier in his life. And was he such a
  freak, after all, in this world of Immortals, satyrs, and half-human
  swimmers?</p>

  <p>He paused at the door of the cottage, peering within. The miraculous cook-
  stove hissed quietly, and Evanie was humming to herself as she stood before a
  mirror, brushing the shining metal of her hair. She glimpsed him instantly
  and whirled. He strode forward and caught her hands.</p>

  <p>"Evanie&mdash;" he began, and paused as she jerked violently to release
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Please go out!" she said.</p>

  <p>He held her wrists firmly. "Evanie, you've got to listen to me. I love
  you!</p>

  <p>"I know those aren't the right words," he stumbled on. "It's
  just&mdash;the best I can do."</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;permit this," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I know you don't, but&mdash;Evanie I mean it!"</p>

  <p>He tried to draw her closer but she stood stiffly while he slipped his
  arms about her. By sheer strength he tilted her head back and kissed her.</p>

  <p>For a moment he felt her relax against him, then she had thrust him
  away.</p>

  <p>"Please!" she gasped. "You can't! You don't&mdash;understand!"</p>

  <p>"I do," he said gently.</p>

  <p>"Then you see how impossible it is for me to&mdash;marry!"</p>

  <p>"Any wildness in any children of ours," he said with a smile, "might as
  easily come of the Connor blood."</p>

  <p>For a long moment Evanie lay passive in his arms, and then, when she
  struggled away, he was startled to see tears.</p>

  <p>"Tom," she whispered, "if I say I love you will you promise me
  something?"</p>

  <p>"You know I will!"</p>

  <p>"Then, promise you'll not mention love again, nor try to kiss me, nor even
  touch me&mdash;for a month. After that, I'll&mdash;I'll do as you wish. Do
  you promise?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, but why, Evanie? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because within a month," she murmured tensely, "there'll be war!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">8. IN TIME OF PEACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Connor held strictly to his word with Evanie. But the change
  in their relationship was apparent to both of them. Evanie no longer met his
  gaze with frank steadiness. Her eyes would drop when they met his, and she
  would lose the thread of her sentences in confusion.</p>

  <p>Yet when he turned unexpectedly, he always found her watching him with a
  mixture of abstractedness and speculation. And once or twice he awakened in
  the morning to find her gazing at him from the doorway with a tender, wistful
  smile.</p>

  <p>One afternoon Jan Orm hailed him from the foot of Evanie's hill.</p>

  <p>"I've something to show you," he called, and Connor rose from his
  comfortable sprawl in the shade and joined him, walking toward the factory
  across the village.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking, Jan," Connor remarked. "Frankly, I can't yet
  understand why you consider the Master such a despicable tyrant. I've yet to
  hear of any really tyrannous act of his."</p>

  <p>"He isn't a tyrant," Jan said gloomily. "I wish he were. Then our
  revolution would be simple. Almost everybody would be on our side. It's
  evidence of his ability that he avoids any misgovernment, and keeps the
  greater part of the people satisfied. He's just, kind, and
  benevolent&mdash;on the surface!"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think he's different underneath?"</p>

  <p>"He retains the one secret we'd all like to possess&mdash;the secret of
  immortality. Isn't that evidence enough that he's supremely selfish? He and
  his two or three million Immortals&mdash;sole rulers of the Earth!"</p>

  <p>"Two or three million!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What's the difference how many? They're still ruling half a billion
  people&mdash;a small percentage ruling the many. If he's so benevolent, why
  doesn't he grant others the privilege of immortality?"</p>

  <p>' "That's a fair question," said Connor slowly, pondering, "Anyway, I'm on
  your side, Jan. You're my people now; I owe you all my allegiance." They
  entered the factory, "And now&mdash;what was it you brought me here to
  see?"</p>

  <p>Jan's face brightened.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Have a look at this."</p>

  <p>He brought forth an object from a desk drawer in his office, passing it
  pridefully to Connor. It was a blunt, thick-handled, blue steel revolver.</p>

  <p>"Atom-powered," Jan glowed. "Here's the magazine." He shook a dozen little
  leaden balls, each the size of his little fingernail, into his palm.</p>

  <p>"No need of a cartridge, of course," commented Connor. "Water in the
  handle?...I thought so. But here's one mistake. You don't want your
  projectiles round; you lose range and accuracy. Make 'em cylindrical and
  blunt-pointed." He squinted through the weapon's barrel. "And&mdash;there's
  no rifling."</p>

  <p>He explained the purpose of rifling the barrel to give the bullet a rotary
  motion.</p>

  <p>"I should have known enough to consult you first," Jan Orm said wryly.
  "Want to try it out anyway? I haven't been able to hit much with it so
  far."</p>

  <p>They moved through the whirring factory. At the rear the door opened upon
  a slope away from the village. The ground slanted gently toward the river.
  Glancing about for a suitable target, Connor seized an empty can from a bench
  within the door and flung it as far as he could down the slope. He raised the
  revolver, and suddenly perceived another imperfection that had escaped his
  notice.</p>

  <p>"There are no sights on it!" he ejaculated.</p>

  <p>"Sights?" Jan was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"To aim by." He explained the principle. "Well, let's try it as is."</p>

  <p>He squinted down the smooth barrel, squeezed the trigger. There was a
  sharp report, his arm snapped back to a terrific recoil, and the can leaped
  spinning high into the air, to fall yards farther toward the river.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" he exclaimed. "What a kick!"</p>

  <p>But Jan was leaping with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"You hit it! You hit it!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, but it hit back," Connor said ruefully. "While you're making the
  other changes, lighten the charge a little, else you'll have broken wrists in
  your army. And I'd set somebody to work on ordnance and rifles. They're a lot
  more useful than revolvers." At Jan's nod, he asked, "You don't expect to
  equip the whole revolution with the products of this one factory, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not! There are thousands like it, in villages like Ormon. I've
  already sent descriptions of the weapons we'll need. I'll have to correct
  them."</p>

  <p>"How many men can you count on? Altogether, I mean."</p>

  <p>"We should muster twenty-five thousand."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five thousand for a world revolution? An even twenty-five thousand
  to attack a city of thirty million?"</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that the city is all that counts. Who holds Urbs holds the
  world."</p>

  <p>"But still&mdash;a city that size! Or even just the three million
  Immortals. We'll be overwhelmed!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Jan said grimly. "Don't forget that in Urbs are
  several million Anadominists. I count on them to join us. In fact, I'm
  planning to smuggle arms to them, provided our weapons are successful. They
  won't be as effective as the ionic beam, but&mdash;we can only try. We'll
  have at least the advantage of surprise, since we don't plan to muster and
  march on Urbs. We'll infiltrate slowly, and on the given day, at the given
  hour, we'll strike!"</p>

  <p>"There'll be street fighting, then," Connor said. "There's nothing like
  machine-guns for that."</p>

  <p>"What are they?"</p>

  <p>Jan's eyes glowed as Connor explained.</p>

  <p>"We can manage those," he decided. "That should put us on a par with the
  Urban troops, so long as we remain in the city where the air forces can't
  help them. If only we had aircraft!"</p>

  <p>"There're airplanes, such as my generation used."</p>

  <p>"Too flimsy. Useless against the fliers of Urbs. No, whatwe need is the
  secret of the rocket blast, and since that's unobtainable, we'll have to do
  without. We'll manage to keep our fighting in the City itself. And how we'll
  need you!"</p>

  <p>Connor soon came to realize the truth of Jan's words. What little he knew
  of trajectories, velocities, and the science of ballistics was taxed to the
  uttermost. He was astounded to discover that calculus was a lost knowledge,
  and that Jan was even unacquainted with the use of logarithms and the slide
  rule.</p>

  <p>Rather than plod through hours and hours of mathematical computation, it
  seemed to Connor the shorter method was to work out a table of logarithms to
  four places, and to construct a slide rule; in both of these operations Jan
  joined with growing enthusiasm as understanding increased.</p>

  <p>As the preparations progressed, Connor began to notice other
  things&mdash;the vanishing of familiar faces, the lack of youthful
  activities. He knew what that meant. The revolutionaries were gradually
  filtering into Urbs, and the day of the uprising was at hand.</p>

  <p>How close it was, however, he never dreamed until he emerged one morning
  to find Evanie talking to Jan Orm, with her eyes alight. She turned eagerly
  to Tom, led him back into the cottage.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me!" she whispered. "The day is here! We leave for Urbs
  tonight!"</p>

  <p>All day there was a hush over the village. It was bereft of youth, girls
  as well as men. Only the oldsters plodded about in street and field.</p>

  <p>Jan Orm confessed to Connor that he was not entirely pleased with all
  details. His estimate of the number of revolutionaries who would join him had
  been too high. But the infiltration into the city had been successful, and
  twenty-two thousand villagers lay armed and hidden among their Urban
  sympathizers. This, Jan argued, promised a great accession to their ranks
  once the hour had strike.</p>

  <p>"What are your arrangements?" Connor asked.</p>

  <p>"Each village has chosen its leader. These leaders have again centralized
  their command into ten, of whom our Ormon leader happens to be one. But each
  variety of Weed has its own corps." He smiled. "They call us Weeds, because
  we're supposed to run wild."</p>

  <p>And again there came to Connor a quick mental picture of his beautiful
  girl of the forest. She, too, had spoken of "Weeds," a little contemptuously,
  he seemed to remember now. He had not understood her allusion then, had not
  asked her to explain. But it was plain enough now. Her lofty attitude toward
  "Weeds," or the common people, must have been because she was an aristocrat
  herself. Who could she have been? He had seen no one hereabouts bearing any
  faintest resemblance to her.</p>

  <p>He brought his mind swiftly back to Jan.</p>

  <p>"If you win," he observed, "you'll have a general battle over the spoils.
  You may find yourself worse off after the revolution than before."</p>

  <p>"We know that," Jan said grimly. "Yet we'll fight side by side until the
  Master's done for. Afterward&mdash;" He spread his hands expressively.</p>

  <p>"You mentioned `our Ormon leader,' " remarked Connor. "That's you, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" Jan chuckled. "That's Evanie."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Connor stared amazed at the gentle, shy, and quiet girl.</p>

  <p>"Jan exaggerated," she said, smiling. "I depend on all the rest of you.
  Especially Jan&mdash;and you, Tom."</p>

  <p>He shook his head, puzzled about this revolution&mdash;shadowy, vague,
  ill-planned. To assault a world ruler in a colossal city with untrained
  rabble using weapons unfamiliar to them! Surely the Master must know there
  was sedition and plotting among his people.</p>

  <p>He was about to voice his doubts when a flash of iridescence down the
  sunny slope caught his eye. It seemed more like a disturbance in the air or a
  focus of light than a material body. It swept in wide circles as if hunting
  or seeking, and&mdash;Connor heard its high, humming buzz. The creature, if
  it were a creature, was no more than eighteen inches long, and featureless
  save for a misty beak at the forward end.</p>

  <p>It circled closer, and suddenly he perceived an amazing phenomenon. It was
  circling the three of them and, he had thought, the cottage too. Then he saw
  that instead of circling the building it was passing through the walls!</p>

  <p>"Look!" he cried. "What's that?"</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9">9. THE WAY TO URBS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The effect on Jan and Evanie was startling. As they
  perceived the almost invisible thing, the girl shrieked in terror.</p>

  <p>"Don't look at it!" Jan choked out. "Don't even think of it!"</p>

  <p>Both of them covered their faces with their hands.</p>

  <p>They made no attempt to flee; indeed, Connor thought confusedly, how could
  one hide from a thing that could pass like a phantom through rock walls? He
  tried to follow their example but could not resist another peep at the
  mystery. It was still visible, but further off down the slope towards the
  river, and as he gazed, it abandoned its circling, passed like a streak of
  mist over the water, and vanished.</p>

  <p>"It's gone," he said mildly. "Suppose you tell me what it was."</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;it was a Messenger of the Master," murmured Evanie fearfully.
  "Jan, do you think it was for one of us? If so, that means he suspects!"</p>

  <p>"God knows!" Jan muttered. "It looked dim to me, like it stray."</p>

  <p>"And what," Connor demanded to know, "is a Messenger of the Master?"</p>

  <p>"It's to carry the Master's commands," said Evanie.</p>

  <p>"You don't say!" he snapped ironically. "I could guess that from its name.
  But what is it?"</p>

  <p>"It's a mechanism of force, or so we think," said Jan, "It's&mdash;did you
  ever see ball-lightning?"</p>

  <p>Connor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's nothing material, strictly speaking, in ball-lightning.
  It's a balance of electrical forces. And so are the Messengers&mdash;a
  structure of forces."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;was it alive?"</p>

  <p>"We believe not. Not exactly alive."</p>

  <p>Connor groaned. "Not material, strictly speaking, and not exactly alive!
  In other words, a ghost."</p>

  <p>Jan smiled nervously.</p>

  <p>"It does sound queer. What I mean is that the Messengers are composed of
  forces, like ball-lightning. They're stable as long as Urbs supplies enough
  energy to offset the losses. They don't discharge all at once like ball-
  lightning. When their energy is cut off, they just dissipate, fade out,
  vanish. That one missed its mark, if it was for us."</p>

  <p>"How do they bear the Master's commands?"</p>

  <p>"I hope you never find out," Evanie said softly. "I was sent for once
  before, but that Messenger missed like this. Jan and I&mdash;can close our
  minds to them. It takes practice to learn how."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Connor, "if the Master suspects, you'd better change your
  plans. Surprise was your one advantage."</p>

  <p>"We can't," Jan said grimly. "Our cooperating groups would split into
  factions in half an hour, given any excuse."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;that might have been sent as a warning!"</p>

  <p>"No matter. We've got to go ahead. What's more, we'd better leave
  now."</p>

  <p>Jan rose abruptly and departed. A moment later Connor saw him back in a
  motor vehicle from the hill below the factory. And then, with no more
  preparation than that, they were jolting over the rutted red clay road, Jan
  driving, Evanie between the two men.</p>

  <p>When they swung suddenly to a wide paved highway, the battered vehicle
  leaped swiftly to unexpected speed. A full hundred miles an hour, though that
  was not so greatly in excess of the speed of cars of Connor's own day.</p>

  <p>Hour after hour they rushed down the endless way. They passed tree-grown
  ruins and little villages like Ormon, and as night fell, here and there the
  lights of some peaceful farm dwelling. Evanie relieved Jan, and then Connor,
  pleading his acquaintance with ancient automobiles, drove for a while, to the
  expressed admiration of the other two.</p>

  <p>"You ancients must have been amazing!" said Jan.</p>

  <p>"What paving is this?" asked Connor as they darted along.</p>

  <p>"Same stuff as our tires. Rubrum. Synthetic rubber."</p>

  <p>"Paved by whom?"</p>

  <p>"By Urbs," said Jan sourly. "Out of our taxes."</p>

  <p>"Well isn't that one answer to your objections? No taxes, no roads."</p>

  <p>"The road through Ormon is maintained without taxes, simply by the
  cooperation of the people."</p>

  <p>Connor smiled, remembering that rutted clay road.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible to alienate any of the Master's troops?" he asked.
  "Trained men would help our chances."</p>

  <p>"No," Jan said positively. "The man has a genius for loyalty. Such an
  attempt would be suicide."</p>

  <p>"Humph! Do you know&mdash;the more I hear of the Master, the more I like
  him? I can't see why you hate him so! Apparently, he's a good ruler."</p>

  <p>"He is a good ruler, damn his clever soul! If he weren't, I told you
  everybody'd be on our side." Jan turned to Evanie. "See how dangerous the
  Master is? His charm strikes even through the words of his enemies!"</p>

  <p>When they finally stopped for refreshments, Evanie described for Connor
  other wonders of the Master's world empire. She told him of the hot-house
  cities of Antarctica under their crystal domes, and especially Austropolis,
  of the great mining city in the shadow of the Southern Pole, and of Nyx,
  lying precariously on the slopes of the volcano Erebus.</p>

  <p>She had a wealth of detail gleaned from the vision screen, but Jan Orm had
  traveled there, and added terse comment. All traffic and freight came in by
  rocket, the Triangles of Urbs, a means too expensive for general use, but the
  mines produced the highly-prized metal, platinum.</p>

  <p>Evanie spoke, too, of the "Urban pond," the new sea formed in the Sahara
  Desert by the blasting of a passage through the Atlas Mountains to the
  Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>That had made of Algeria and Tripoli fertile countries, and by the
  increased surface for evaporation, it had changed even the climate of the
  distant Arabian Desert.</p>

  <p>And there was Eartheye on the summit of sky-piercing Everest, the great
  observatory whose objective mirror was a spinning pool of mercury a hundred
  feet across, and whose images of stellar bodies were broadcast to students
  around the world. In this gigantic mirror, Betelgeuse showed a measurable
  disc, the moon was a pitted plain thirty yards away, and even Mars glowed
  cryptically at a distance of only two and a half miles.</p>

  <p>Connor learned that the red planet still held its mystery. The canals had
  turned out to be illusion, but the seasonal changes still argued life, and a
  million tiny markings hinted at some sort of civilization.</p>

  <p>"But they've been to the moon," Evanie said, continuing the discussion as
  they got under way again. "There's a remnant of life there, little
  crystalline flowers that the great ladies of Urbs sometimes wear. Moon
  orchids; each one worth a fortune."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to give you one some day," murmured Connor.</p>

  <p>"Look, Tom!" Evanie cried sharply. "A Triangle!"</p>

  <p>He saw it in the radiance of early dawn. It was in fact a triangle with
  three girders rising from its points to an apex, whence the blast struck down
  through the open center. At once he realized the logic of the construction,
  for it could neither tip nor fall while the blast was fed.</p>

  <p>How large? He couldn't tell, since it hung at an unknown height. It seemed
  enormous, at least a hundred feet on a side. And then a lateral blast flared,
  and it moved rapidly ahead of them into the south.</p>

  <p>"Were they watching us, do you suppose?" Evanie asked tensely.
  "But&mdash;of course not! I guess I'm just nervous. Look, Tom, there's
  Kaatskill, a suburb of the City."</p>

  <p>The town was one of magnificent dwellings and vast lawns.</p>

  <p>"Kaatskill!" mused Connor. "The home of Rip van Winkle."</p>

  <p>Evanie did not get the meaning of that.</p>

  <p>"If he lives in Kaatskill I never heard of him," she said. "It is a place
  where many wealthy Sleepers have settled to enjoy their wealth."</p>

  <p>The road widened suddenly, then they topped the crest of a hill. Connor's
  eyes widened in astonishment as the scene unfolded.</p>

  <p>A valley lay before them and, cupped in the hills as in the palm of a
  colossal hand, lay such a hive of mammoth buildings that for a moment reason
  refused to accept it. Urbs! Connor knew instantly that only the world capital
  could stretch in such reaches across to the distant blue hills beyond.</p>

  <p>He stared at sky-piercing structures, at tiered streets, at the curious
  steel web where a monorail car sped like a spider along its silken
  strand.</p>

  <p>"There! Urbs Minor!" whispered Evanie. "Lesser Urbs!"</p>

  <p>"Lesser Urbs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Urbs Major is beyond. See? Toward the hills."</p>

  <p>He saw. He saw the incredible structures that loomed Gargantuan. He saw a
  fleecy cloud drift across one, while behind it twin towers struck yet higher
  toward the heavens.</p>

  <p>"The spires of the Palace," murmured Evanie.</p>

  <p>They sped along the topmost of three tiers, and the vast structures were
  blotted out by nearer ones. For an hour and a half they passed along that
  seemingly endless street. The morning life of Urbs was appearing, traffic
  flowed, pedestrians moved in and out of doorways.</p>

  <p>The dress of the city had something military about it, with men and women
  alike garbed in metallic-scaled shirts and either kirtles or brief shorts,
  with sandaled feet. They were slight in build, as were the Ormon folk, but
  they had none of the easy-going complacency of the villagers. They were
  hectic and hurried, and the sight struck a familiar note across the
  centuries.</p>

  <p>Urbs was city incarnate. Connor felt the brilliance, the glamour, the
  wickedness, that is a part of all great cities from Babylon to Chicago. Here
  were all of them in one, all the great cities that ever were, all in this
  gigantic metropolis. Babylon reborn&mdash;Imperial Rome made young again!</p>

  <p>They crossed, suddenly, a three-tiered viaduct over brown water.</p>

  <p>"The canal that makes Urbs a seaport," Evanie explained.</p>

  <p>Beyond, rising clifflike from the bank, soared those structural colossi
  Connor had seen in the blue distance, towering unbelievably into the bright
  sky. He felt pygmy-like, crushed, stifled, so enormous was the mass. He did
  not need Evanie's whisper:</p>

  <p>"Across the water is Greater Urbs."</p>

  <p>Those mountainous piles could be nothing less.</p>

  <p>On the crowded sidewalks brilliantly costumed people flowed by, many
  smoking black cigarettes. That roused a longing in Tom Connor for his ancient
  pipe, now disintegrated a thousand years. He stared at the bold Urban women
  with their short hair and metallic garb. Now and again one stared back,
  either contemptuously, noting his Weed clothing, or in admiration of his
  strong figure.</p>

  <p>Jan Orm guided the car down a long ramp, past the second tier and down
  into the dusk of the ground level. They cut into a solid line of thunderous
  trucks, and finally pulled up at the base of one of the giant buildings. Jan
  drew a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"We're here," he said. "Urbs!"</p>

  <p>Connor made no reply. In his mind was only the stunning thought that this
  colossus called Urbs was the city they were to attempt to conquer with their
  Weed army&mdash;a handful of less than twenty-five thousand!</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">10. REVOLUTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">With the cessation of the car's movement a blanket of humid
  heat closed down on them. The ground level was sultry, hot with the stagnant
  breath of thirty million pairs of lungs.</p>

  <p>Then, as Connor alighted, there was a whir, and he glanced up to see a fan
  blower dissolve into whirling invisibility, drawing up the fetid accumulation
  of air. A faint coolness wafted along the tunnel-like street. For perhaps
  half a minute the fan hummed, then was stilled. The colossal city breathed,
  in thirty-second gasps!</p>

  <p>They moved into the building, to a temperature almost chilly after the
  furnace heat outside. Connor heard the hiss of a cooling system, recognized
  the sibilance since he had heard it from a similar system in Evanie's
  cottage. They followed Jan to an elevator, one of a bank of fully forty, and
  identical to one of the automatic lifts in an ancient apartment building.</p>

  <p>Jan pressed a button, and the cage shot into swift and silent motion. It
  seemed a long time before it clicked to a halt at the seventy-fourth floor.
  The doors swung noiselessly aside and they emerged into a carpeted hall,
  following Jan to a door halfway down the corridor. A faint murmur of voices
  within ceased as Jan pressed a bell-push.</p>

  <p>In the moment of silence a faint, bluish light outlined the faces of Jan
  and Evanie; Connor standing a bit to the side, was beyond it.</p>

  <p>"Looking us over on a vision screen," whispered Jan, and instantly the
  door opened. Connor heard voices. "Evanie Sair and Jan Orm! At last!"</p>

  <p>Connor followed them into a small chamber, and was a little taken aback by
  the hush that greeted his appearance. He faced the group of leaders in the
  room, half a dozen men and an equal number of women, all garbed in Urban
  dress, and all frozen in immobile surprise.</p>

  <p>"This is Tom Connor," Jan Orm said quickly. "He suggested the rifles."</p>

  <p>"Well!" drawled a golden-haired girl, relaxing. "He looks like a cool
  Immortal. Lord! I thought we were in for it!"</p>

  <p>"You'd manage, Ena," said a striking dark-haired beauty, laughing
  disdainfully.</p>

  <p>"Don't mind Maris." The blonde smiled at Connor. "She's been told she
  looks like the Princess; hence the air of hauteur." She paused. "And what do
  you think of Urbs?"</p>

  <p>"Crowded," Connor said, and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Crowded! You should see it on a business day."</p>

  <p>"It's their weekly holiday," explained Evanie. "Sunday. We chose it
  purposely. There'll be fewer guards in the Palace seeing room."</p>

  <p>For the first time Connor realized that Sundays passed unobserved in the
  peaceful life of Ormon.</p>

  <p>Jan was surveying the Urban costumes in grim disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Let's get to business," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of, "Hush!"</p>

  <p>The girl Maris added, "You know there's a scanner in every room in Urbs,
  Jan. We can be seen from the Palace, and heard too!"</p>

  <p>She nodded toward one of the lightbrackets on the wall. After a moment of
  close inspection Connor distinguished the tiny crystal "eye."</p>

  <p>"Why not cover it?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"That would bring a Palace officer in five minutes," responded the blonde
  Ena. "A blank on the screen sticks out like the Alpha Building."</p>

  <p>She summoned the group close about her, slipping a casual arm through
  Connor's. In an almost inaudible whisper she began to detail the progress of
  the plans, replying to Jan's queries about the distribution of weapons and
  where they now were, to Evanie's question about the appointed time, to
  inquiries from each of the others.</p>

  <p>Evanie's report of the Messenger caused some apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he knows?" asked Ena. "He must, unless it was some stray
  that passed near you."</p>

  <p>"Suppose he does," countered Evanie. "He can't know when. We're ready,
  aren't we? Why not strike today&mdash;now&mdash;at once?"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of whispered protest.</p>

  <p>"We oughtn't to risk everything on a sudden decision &mdash;it's too
  reckless!"</p>

  <p>Ena pressed Connor's arm and whispered, "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>He caught an angry glance from Evanie. She resented the blond girl's
  obvious attention.</p>

  <p>"Evanie's right," he murmured. "The only chance this half-baked revolution
  has is surprise. Lose that and you've lost everything."</p>

  <p>And such, after more whispered discussion, was the decision. The blow was
  to be struck at one o'clock, just two hours away. The leaders departed to
  pass the instructions to their subordinate leaders, until only Connor and
  Evanie remained. Evan Jan Orm had gone to warn the men of Ormon.</p>

  <p>Evanie seemed about to speak to Connor, but suddenly turned her back on
  him.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Evanie?" he said softly.</p>

  <p>He was unprepared for the violence with which she swung around, her brown
  eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>"Matter!" she snapped. "You dare ask! With the feel of that canary-headed
  Ena's fingers still warm on your arm!"</p>

  <p>"But Evanie!" he protested. "I did nothing."</p>

  <p>"You let her!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>"You let her!"</i></p>

  <p>Further protest was prevented by the return of the patrician Maris. Evanie
  dropped into a sulky silence, not broken until Jan Orm appeared.</p>

  <p>It was a solemn group that emerged on the ground level and turned their
  steps in the direction of the twin-towered Palace. Evanie had apparently
  forgotten her grievance in the importance of the impending moment, but all
  were silent and thoughtful.</p>

  <p>Not even Connor had eyes for Palace Avenue, and the tumult and turmoil of
  that great street boiled about him unnoticed. Through the girders above, the
  traffic of the second and third tiers sent rumbling thunder, but he never
  glanced up, trudging abstractedly beside Evanie.</p>

  <p>A hundred feet from the street's end they paused. Through the tunnel-like
  opening where Palace Avenue divided to circle the broad grounds of the
  Palace, Connor gazed at a vista of green lawn surmounted by the flight of
  white steps that led to the Arch where the enormous diorite statue of
  Holland, the Father of Knowledge, sat peering with narrowed eyes into an
  ancient volume.</p>

  <p>"Two minutes," said Jan with a nervous glance around. "We'd better move
  forward."</p>

  <p>They reached the open. The grounds, surrounded by the incredible wall of
  mountainous buildings, glowed green as a lake in the sun, and the full
  vastness of the Palace burst upon Connor's eyes, towering into the heavens
  like a twin-peaked mountain. For a moment he gazed, awe-struck, then glanced
  back into the cave of the ground level, waiting for the hour to strike.</p>

  <p>It came, booming out of the Palace tower. One o'clock! Instantly the
  ground level was a teeming mass of humanity, swarming out of the buildings in
  a torrent. Sun-light glanced, flashing from rifle barrels; shouts sounded in
  a wild chorus. Swiftly the Ormon men gathered around Evanie, whose brilliant
  costume of green and crimson formed a rallying point like a flag.</p>

  <p>The mob became an army, each group falling into formation about its
  leader. Men ran shouting into the streets on the broad avenue that circled
  the grounds, on the second and third tiers. Instantly a traffic jam began to
  spread to epic proportions. And then, between the vehicles, the mass of
  humanity flowed across the street toward the Palace.</p>

  <p>From other streets to right and left, other crowds were pouring. The
  black-haired Maris was striding bare-limbed and lithe before her forces.
  White, frightened faces stared from a thousand stalled cars.</p>

  <p>Then the heterogeneous mob was sweeping up the slope of grass, a surging
  mass converging from every side. The Palace was surrounded, at the mercy of
  the mob. And then&mdash;the whole frenzied panorama froze suddenly into
  immobility.</p>

  <p>From a dozen doors, and down the wide white steps came men&mdash;Urban
  men, with glittering metallic cuirasses and bare brown limbs. They moved
  deliberately, in the manner of trained troops. Quickly they formed an inner
  circle about the Palace, an opposing line to the menacing thousands
  without.</p>

  <p>They were few compared to the revolutionary forces, yet for a tense moment
  the charge was halted, and the two lines glared at each other across a few
  hundred feet of grassy slope.</p>

  <p>That moment was etched forever in Connor's mind. He seemed to see
  everything, with the strange clarity that excitement can lead. The glint of
  sunlight on steel,the vast inextricable jam of traffic, the motionless thou-
  sands on the hill, the untold thousands peering from every window in every
  one of the gigantic buildings. And even, on a balcony of stone far up on the
  left tower, two tiny shining figures surveying the scene. The three Triangles
  hanging motionless as clouds high in the heavens. The vast brooding figure of
  Holland staring unperturbed into his black stone book.</p>

  <p>"He's warned&mdash;he's ready!" Jan muttered.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to fire," Evanie cried.</p>

  <p>But before her command, the sharp rattle of rifles came from far to the
  right. Machine-guns sputtered, and all down the widespread line puffs of
  steam billowed like huge white chrysanthemums, and dissipated at once.</p>

  <p>From a thousand windows in the bank of buildings burst other momentary
  clouds, and the medley of shouts punctuated by staccato explosions was like a
  chorus of wild music.</p>

  <p>Connor stared thunderstruck. In the opposing line not a single man had
  fallen! Each stood motionless as the giant statue, left arm crooked across
  breast, right arm holding a glistening revolverlike weapon. Was marksmanship
  responsible for that&mdash;incredibly poor marksmanship?</p>

  <p>Impossible, with that hail of bullets! Puffs of dust spurted up before the
  line, splintered stone flew from the walls behind. Windows crashed. But not
  one Urban soldier moved.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Connor yelled.</p>

  <p>"He knew." Jan Orm panted. "He's equipped his men with Paige deflectors.
  He's the devil himself!"</p>

  <p>The girl Maris leaped forward.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" she shouted, and led the charge.</p>

  <p>Instantly the line of Urbans raised their weapons, laying them across
  their bent left arms. A faint misty radiance stabbed out, a hundred brief
  flashes of light. The beams swept the revolutionaries. Anguished cries broke
  out as men spun and writhed.</p>

  <p>Connor leaped back as a flash caught him. Sudden pain racked him as his
  muscles tore against each other in violent spasmodic contractions. A moment
  only; then he was trembling and aching as the beam flicked out. An electric
  shock! None should know that better than he!</p>

  <p>Everywhere the revolutionaries were writhing in agony.</p>

  <p>The front ranks were down, and of all those near him, only he and Evanie
  were standing. Her face was strained and white and agonized.</p>

  <p>Jan Orm was struggling to his feet, his face a mask of pain. Beyond him
  others were crawling away. Connor was astounded. The shock had been painful,
  but not that painful.</p>

  <p>Halfway up the slope before the immobile line of Urbans lay the black-
  haired Maris. Her nerves had been unequal to the task set them, and she had
  fainted from sheer pain. The whole mass of the Weed army was wavering. The
  revolution was failing!</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">11. FLIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Connor had an inspiration. The deflecting force must emanate
  from the glittering buttons on the Urbans' left arms. Moreover, the field
  must be projected only before the Urban soldiers, else they'd not be able to
  move their own weapons. Springing to a fallen machine-gun, he righted it,
  spun it far to the left so as to enfilade the Urbans, to strike them from the
  side.</p>

  <p>He pulled the trigger&mdash;let out a yell of fierce joy as a dozen foemen
  toppled. He tried to shout his discovery to the others, but none heeded, and
  anyhow the Urbans could counter it by a slight shift of formation. So grimly
  he cut as wide a gap as he could.</p>

  <p>The beams flashed. Steeling himself to the agony of the shock, he bore it
  unflinchingly. When it had passed, the Weed army was in flight. He muttered a
  vicious curse</p>

  <p>d jerked a groaning man on the ground beside him to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You're still alive, you sheep!" he snarled. "Get up and carry that girl!"
  He gestured at the prostrate Maris.</p>

  <p>The slope was clearing. Only half a hundred Weeds lay twisting on the
  grass, or were staggering painfully erect. Connor glared at the slowly
  advancing Urbans, faced them for a moment disdainfully, then turned to follow
  the flying Weeds. Halfway across the grounds he paused, seized an abandoned
  rifle, and dropped to his knee.</p>

  <p>In a gesture of utter defiance, he took careful aim at the two figures on
  the tower balcony five hundred feet above. He pressed the trigger. Ten shots
  spat out in quick succession. Windows splintered above the figures, below, to
  right and left. Tom Connor swore again as he realized that these, too, were
  protected. Then he gritted his teeth as the ionic beam swept him once
  more.</p>

  <p>When it ceased, he fled, to mingle with the last of the retreating Weed
  forces. They were trickling through, over, and around that traffic jam that
  would take heroic efforts to untangle.</p>

  <p>The Revolution was over. No man could now re-organize that flying mob.
  Connor thrust his way through the mass of panic-stricken humanity until he
  reached the car in which Jan and Evanie were already waiting.</p>

  <p>Without a word Jan swung the car hastily about, for the traffic snarl was
  reaching even as far away as he had parked. Evanie dropped, her head on
  Connor's shoulder, weeping quietly.</p>

  <p>"That's a hell of a revolution!" he grunted. "Twenty minutes and it's
  over!"</p>

  <p>The car swept through the semi-dusk of the ground level of Palace Avenue
  to the point where the ramp curved about the base of the Atlas Building.
  There Jan guided it into the sunlight of the upper tier. In the after-noon
  glare his face was worn and haggard. Evanie, her spell of weeping over, was
  pallid and expressionless, like a statue in ivory.</p>

  <p>"Won't we be stopped?" Connor asked, as Jan put on, speed.</p>

  <p>"They'll try," said Jan. "They'll block all of the Hundred Bridges. I hope
  we get across first. We can only hope, because they can see every move we
  make, of course. There are scanners on every street. We may be watched from
  the Palace now."</p>

  <p>The bridge over which they had come into the city loomed before them. In a
  moment they were over the canal and into Urbs Minor, where ten million people
  still moved about their occupations in utter ignorance of the revolution and
  its outcome.</p>

  <p>The colossal buildings of Greater Urbs receded and took on the blue hue of
  distance, and Lesser Urbs slipped rapidly by them. It was not until they had
  surmounted the ridge and dropped into Kaatskill that Jan gave any evidence of
  relaxing. There he drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"Respite!" he murmured gloomily. "There are no scanners here, at
  least."</p>

  <p>"What's to be done now?" asked Connor.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows! We'll be hunted, of course&mdash;everybody who was in it.
  But in Montmerci's rebellion the Master punished only one&mdash;Montmerci
  himself; the leader."</p>

  <p>"Evanie's grandfather."</p>

  <p>"Yes. That may weigh against her."</p>

  <p>"This damned revolution was doomed from the start!" declared Connor
  irritably. "We hadn't enough organization, nor good enough weapons, nor an
  effective plan&mdash;nothing! And having lost the advantage of surprise, we
  had no chance at all."</p>

  <p>"Don't!" Evanie murmured wearily. "We know that now."</p>

  <p>"I knew it the whole time," he retorted. "By the way, Jan&mdash;those
  Paige deflectors of theirs. Do you know how they work?"</p>

  <p>"Of course." Jan's voice was as weary as Evanie's. "It's just an inductive
  field. And metal passing through it had eddy currents induced in it."</p>

  <p>Simple enough, mused Connor. He'd seen the old experiment of the aluminum
  ring tossed by eddy currents from the pole of an alternating current magnet.
  But he asked in surprise:</p>

  <p>"Against such velocities?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The greater the velocity, the stronger the eddy currents. The
  bullet's speed helps to deflect it."</p>

  <p>"Did you know of these deflectors before?" snapped Connor.</p>

  <p>"Of course. But projectile weapons haven't been used for so long&mdash;how
  could I dream he'd know of our rifles and resurrect the deflectors?"</p>

  <p>"You should have anticipated the possibility. Why, we could have
  used&mdash;" He broke off. Recriminations were useless now. "Never mind. Tell
  me about the ionic beam, Jan."</p>

  <p>"It's just two parallel beams of highly actinic light, like gamma rays.
  They ionize the air they pass through. The ionized air is a conductor.
  There's an atomic generator in the handles of the beam-pistols, and it shoots
  an electric charge along the beams. And when your body closes the circuit
  between them&mdash;Lord! They didn't use a killing potential, or we'd have
  been burned to a crisp. I still ache from that agony!"</p>

  <p>"Evanie stood up to it," Connor remarked.</p>

  <p>"Just once," murmured the girl. "A second time&mdash;Oh, I'd have
  died!"</p>

  <p>It struck Connor that this delicate, small-boned, nervous race must be
  more sensitive, less inured to pain, than himself. He had stood the shock
  with little difficulty.</p>

  <p>"You're lucky you weren't touched," said Jan.</p>

  <p>Connor snorted. "I was touched three times&mdash;the third time by ten
  beams! If you'd listened to me we could have won the dog-fight anyway. I blew
  a dozen Urbans down by firing from the side."</p>

  <p>"You what?"</p>

  <p>"I saw that," said Evanie. "Just before the second beam. But I&mdash;I
  couldn't stand any more."</p>

  <p>"It makes our position worse, I suppose," muttered Jan. "The Master will
  be angry at injury to his men."</p>

  <p>Connor gave it up. Jan's regret that the enemy had suffered damage simply
  capped a long overdue climax. He was loathe to blame Jan, or the whole Weed
  army, for flying from the searing touch of the ionic beams. He felt himself
  an unfair judge, since he couldn't feel with their nerves. More than likely
  what was merely painful to his more rugged body was unbearable agony to
  them.</p>

  <p>What did trouble him was the realization that he failed to understand
  these people, failed to comprehend their viewpoint. This whole mess of a
  revolution seemed ill-planned, futile, unnecessary, even stupid.</p>

  <p>This set him to wondering about Evanie. Was it fair to try to bring love
  into her life, to rouse her from the reserve she had cast about herself?
  Might that not threaten unhappiness to both of them&mdash;these two strangers
  from different ages?</p>

  <p>Humanity had changed during his long sleep; the only personality in this
  world with whom he felt the slightest sympathy was&mdash;the Master!</p>

  <p>A man he had never even seen, unless one of the two shining figures on the
  tower had been he. Like himself, the Master was a survival of an earlier
  time. Therein, perhaps, lay the bond.</p>

  <p>His musings were interrupted by a flash of iridescence in the air ahead.
  There was a long, desolate silence as the car sped onward.</p>

  <p>"Well," Jan Orm at last said gloomily, "it's come."</p>

  <p>But Connor already knew, instinctively, that what he had seen was the
  rainbow glint of one of the Master's Messengers.</p>

  <p>"For which of us, do you suppose?" he asked soberly. "For Evanie, I guess.
  But don't watch it&mdash;don't think of it. It might be for you."</p>

  <p>Evanie was lying back in the seat, eyes shut, features blank. She had
  closed her mind to the unholy thing. But Connor was unable to keep either
  mind or eyes from the circling mystery as it swept silently about the
  speeding car.</p>

  <p>"It's closing in," he whispered to Jan.</p>

  <p>Jan reached a sudden decision. A rutted road branched ahead of them, and
  he swung the car into it, boring toward the hills.</p>

  <p>"Weed village in here," he muttered. "Perhaps we can lose it there."</p>

  <p>"How? It can pass through brick walls."</p>

  <p>"I know, but the pneumatic freight tube goes through here. The tube's fast
  as a scared meteor. We can try it, and&mdash;" He paused grimly.</p>

  <p>The sun was low in the west when they came to the village, a tiny place
  nestled among green hills. The ominous circling thing was glowing faintly in
  the dusk, now no more than twenty yards away. Evanie had kept to her resolute
  silence, never glancing at the threatening mystery.</p>

  <p>In the village, Jan talked to an ancient, bearded individual, and returned
  to the car with a frown.</p>

  <p>"He has only two cylinders," he announced. "You and Evanie are going."</p>

  <p>Connor clambered out of the car.</p>

  <p>"See here!" he whispered. "You're in more danger than I. Leave me with the
  car. I can find my way to Ormon."</p>

  <p>Jan shook his head. "Listen a moment," he said firmly. "Understand what
  I'm saying. I love Evanie. I've always loved her, but it's you that's been
  given to waken her. You must go with her. And for God's
  sake&mdash;quickly!"</p>

  <p>Reluctantly Connor and Evanie followed Jan into a stone building where the
  nervous old man stood above two seven-foot cylinders lying on a little track.
  Without a word the girl clambered into the first, lying flat on her face with
  her tiny sandals pressed against the rear.</p>

  <p>The ancient snapped down the cover like a coffin lid. Connor's heart sank
  as the man shoved the metal cylinder into a round opening, closed down a door
  behind it, and twirled a hissing handle. Jan motioned Tom Connor to the other
  tube, and at that moment the flashing iridescence of the Messenger swept
  through the room and away. He climbed hastily in, lying as Evanie had
  done.</p>

  <p>"To Ormon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No. To the next Weed village, back in the mountains. Hurry!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">12. THE MESSENGER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The old man slammed the cover. Connor lay in utter darkness,
  but as he felt the cylinder slide along the track, he thought he glimpsed for
  a bare instant the luminous Messenger in a flash through the metal sides. He
  heard the faint clang of the door, and there was a brief moment of quiet.</p>

  <p>Then, with a force that bent his knees, he felt the thrust of terrific
  acceleration. Only a faint rumble came to his ears, but he realized that his
  speed must be enormous. Then the pressure shifted. He felt his hands driven
  against the front, and in a few more seconds, no pressure at all.</p>

  <p>The cover was raised. He thrust himself out, to face Evanie, just
  clambering from her own cylinder, and a frightened nondescript man who
  muttered frantically:</p>

  <p>"Don't tell on me! Don't tell!"</p>

  <p>He turned to listen to a low-voiced inquiry from Evanie, and answered in
  an inaudible whisper and a gesture to the north.</p>

  <p>Connor followed Evanie as she hurried out of the building into darkness.
  He caught a faint glimpse of the stone cottages of a village smaller than
  Ormon, then they were trudging over a dim trail toward the hills black
  against the stars.</p>

  <p>"To the metamorphs of the hills," Evanie said mechanically. "They'll hide
  us until it's safe." She added wearily, "I'm so tired!"</p>

  <p>That was not surprising, after such a day. She started to speak. "You've
  been&mdash;Oh!"</p>

  <p>He saw it too. The luminous needlebeaked shape that was the Messenger,
  circling them twenty yards away.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" he whispered. "How fast can that thing travel?"</p>

  <p>"Disembodied electric force?" she asked wearily. "As fast as light, I
  suppose. Well&mdash;it doesn't matter. I can fight it off if I must. But
  hurry!"</p>

  <p>"God!" Connor groaned. "That persistent demon!"</p>

  <p>His voice rose in a yell of surprise and fear. The misty thing had stopped
  in mid-air, poised a moment, then launched itself at his head!</p>

  <p>There was no pain, just a brief buzzing. Connor realized that the
  needlebeak had thrust itself into his skull, and the horror rested above his
  shoulder. He beat at it. His hands passed through it like mist. And then, in
  a squeaky little voice that clicked maddeningly within his very brain, came
  the words of the Messenger.</p>

  <p>"Go back to Urbs!" it clicked. "Go back to Urbs." Over and over. "Go back
  to Urbs!" Just that.</p>

  <p>He turned frantic eyes on Evanie's startled face. "Get it off!" he cried.
  "Get it off!"</p>

  <p>"It was for you!" she whispered, stricken. "Oh, if it had been for me! I
  can fight it. Close your mind to it, Tom. Try! Please try!"</p>

  <p>He did try; over and over. But that maddening, clicking voice burned
  through his efforts; "Go back to Urbs! Go back to Urbs!"</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it!" Connor cried frantically. "It tickles &mdash;inside my
  brain!" He paced back and forth in anguish. "I want to run! To walk until I'm
  exhausted. I can't&mdash;stand&mdash;it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Evanie said. "Walk until you're exhausted. It will give us time
  that way. But walk north&mdash;away from Urbs. Come."</p>

  <p>She turned wearily to join him.</p>

  <p>"Stay here," he said. "I'll walk alone. Not far. I'll soon return."</p>

  <p>He rushed off into the darkness. His thoughts were turmoil as he dashed
  down the dim trail. I'll fight it off&mdash;<i>Go back to Urbs!</i>&mdash;I
  won't listen&mdash;<i>Go back to Urbs!</i>&mdash;If Evanie can, so can I. I'm
  a man, stronger than she&mdash;<i>Go back to Urbs! Go back to Urbs!</i></p>

  <p>Clicking&mdash;tickling&mdash;maddening! He rushed blindly on, tripping
  over branches, crashing into trees. He scram-bled up the slope of a steep
  hill, driving himself, trying to exhaust himself until he could attain the
  forgetfulness of sleep.</p>

  <p>Panting, scratched, weary, he paused from sheer necessity on the crest of
  the hill. The horror on his shoulder, clicking its message in his brain, gave
  him no surcease. He was going mad! Better death at the Master's hands than
  this. Better anything than this. He turned about and plunged toward the hill
  from which he had come. With his first step south, the maddening voice
  ceased.</p>

  <p>He walked on in a relieved daze. Not even the dim mist of the Messenger on
  his shoulder detracted from the sheer ecstasy of stillness. He murmured
  meaningless words of gratitude, felt an impulse to shout a song.</p>

  <p>Evanie, resting on a fallen log, glanced up at him as he approached.</p>

  <p>"I'm going back to Urbs!" he cried wildly. "I can't stand this!"</p>

  <p>"You can't! I won't let you! Please&mdash;I can rid you of it, given time.
  Give me a little time, Tom. Fight it!"</p>

  <p>"I won't fight it! I'm going back!"</p>

  <p>He turned frantically to rush on south, in any direction that would
  silence that clicking, tickling voice of torment.</p>

  <p>"Go back to Urbs!" it ticked. "Go back to Urbs!" Evanie seized his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;please, Tom!"</p>

  <p>He tugged away and spun around. What he immediately saw in the darkness
  halted him. In a luminous arc, not three yards distant, spun a second
  Messenger&mdash;and in a mad moment of perversity, he was almost glad!</p>

  <p>"Here's one for you!" he said grimly. "Now fight it!"</p>

  <p>The girl's face turned pale and terror stricken. "Oh, no! No!" she
  murmured. "I'm so tired&mdash;so tired!" She turned frightened brown eyes on
  him. "Then stay, Tom. Don't distract me now. I need&mdash;all my
  strength."</p>

  <p>It was too late. The second horror had poised itself and struck, glowing
  mistily against Evanie's soft bronze hair.</p>

  <p>Connor felt a surge of sympathy that not even the insanity-breeding
  Messenger could overcome.</p>

  <p>"Evanie!" he cried huskily. "Oh my God! What is it saying?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were wide and terrified.</p>

  <p>"It says, `Sleep&mdash;Sleep!' It says, `The world grows dark &mdash;your
  eyes are closing.' It isn't fair! I could fight it off&mdash;' could fight
  both of them off, given time! The Master&mdash;the Master wants
  me&mdash;unable&mdash;to help you."</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew misty.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she collapsed at his feet.</p>

  <p>For a long minute Connor stared down at her. Then he bent over, gathered
  her in his arms, and moved out into the darkness toward Urbs.</p>

  <p>Evanie was a light burden, but that first mile down the mountain was a
  torment that was burned into Connor's memory forever. The Messenger was still
  as he began the return, and he managed well enough by the starlight to follow
  the trail. But a thousand feet of mountain unevenness and inequalities of
  footing just about exhausted him.</p>

  <p>His breath shortened to painful gasps, and his whole body, worn out after
  two nights of sleeplessness, pro-tested with aches and twinges. At last,
  still cradling Evanie in his arms, he sank exhausted on the moss-covered bole
  of a fallen tree that glowed with misty fox-fire.</p>

  <p>Instantly the Messenger took up its distractingly irritating
  admonition.</p>

  <p>"Go back to Urbs!" it clicked deep in his brain. "Go back to Urbs! Go back
  to Urbs!"</p>

  <p>He bore the torment for five minutes before he rose in wild obedience and
  staggered south with his burden.</p>

  <p>But another quarter mile found him reeling and dizzy with exhaustion,
  lurching into trees and bushes, scratched, torn, and ragged. Once Evanie's
  hair caught in the thorns of some shadowy shrub and when he paused to
  disentangle it, the Messenger took up its maddening refrain. He tore the girl
  loose with a desperately convulsive gesture and blundered on along the
  trail.</p>

  <p>He was on the verge of collapse after a single mile, and Urbs
  lay&mdash;God only knew how far south! He shifted Evanie from his arms to his
  shoulder, but the thought of abandoning her never entered his mind.</p>

  <p>The time came when his wearied body could go no further. Letting Evanie's
  limp body slide to the ground he closed his eyes in agony. As the torturing
  voice of the Messenger resumed, he dropped beside her.</p>

  <p>"I can't!" he croaked as though the Messenger or its distant controller
  could hear him. "Do you want to kill me?"</p>

  <p>The sublimity of relief! The voice was still, and he relaxed in an ecstasy
  of rest. He realized to the full the sweetness of simple silence, the
  absolute perfection of merely being quiet.</p>

  <p>He slumped full length to the ground, then, and in a moment was sleeping
  as profoundly as Evanie herself.</p>

  <p>When Tom Connor awoke to broad day a heap of fruit and a shallow wooden
  bowl of water were beside him. Connor guessed that they had been placed there
  by the metamorphs that roamed the hills.</p>

  <p>They were still loyal to Evanie, watching out for her.</p>

  <p>He ate hungrily, then lifted Evanie's bronze head, tilting the water
  against her lips. She choked, swallowed a mouthful or two, but moved no more
  than that.</p>

  <p>The damage to his clothing from his plunge through the darkness was
  slight.</p>

  <p>His shirt was torn at sleeves and shoulder, and his trousers were ripped
  in several places. Evanie's soft hair was tangled with twigs and burrs, and a
  thorn had scratched her cheek. The elastic that bound her trouser leg to her
  left ankle was broken, and the garment flapped loosely. The bared ankle was
  crossed by a reddened gash.</p>

  <p>He poured what remained of the water over the wound to wash away any dirt
  or foreign substance that might be in it. That was all his surgery
  encompassed.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">13. THE TRAIL BACK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">By daylight the messenger was only a blur, visible out of
  the corner of his eye like a tear in the eye itself. The demon on Evanie's
  shoulder was a shifting iridescence no more solid than the heatwaves about a
  summer road. He stared compassionately down on the still, white face of the
  girl, and it was at that moment that the Messenger took up its inexorable,
  clicking chant: "Go back to Urbs! Go back to Urbs!"</p>

  <p>He sighed, lifted the girl in arms still aching, and took up his laborious
  journey. Yard by yard he trudged along the uneven trail. When the blood began
  to pound in his ears he rested again, and the silent Messenger on his
  shoulder remained silent. Only when his strength had returned did its voice
  take up the admonition.</p>

  <p>Connor hated the Master now, hated him for these past hours of torture,
  and for the pallor of Evanie's cheeks, and her body limp in his arms.</p>

  <p>The sun rose higher, struck down burning rays on his body. The
  perspiration that dampened his clothes was warm and sticky while he toiled
  along, and clammily cold while he rested. Shiny beads of it were on the brow
  of the unconscious girl, while his own face was covered with' trickling
  rivulets that stung his eyes and bore salty drops to his lips. And the air
  was hot&mdash;hot!</p>

  <p>Staggering south, resting, plowing on again, it was near sunset when he
  approached the Weed village where they had emerged from the pneumatic tube. A
  man digging before a cottage stared at him and fled through the door.</p>

  <p>On the steps of the building that housed the tube, half a dozen idlers
  moved hastily within, and he glimpsed the panic-stricken nondescript who had
  released him from the freight cylinder.</p>

  <p>Connor strode wearily to the steps and deposited Evanie. He glared at the
  pale faces beyond the door.</p>

  <p>"I want food," he snapped. "And wine. Do you hear? Wine!"</p>

  <p>Someone slipped timidly past him. In a moment he was back with coarse
  brown bread and cold meat, and a bottle of tart wild grape wine of the
  region. Connor ate silently, realizing that eyes peered at him from every
  window. When he had finished, he poured wine between Evanie's lips. It was
  the only nourishment he could give her.</p>

  <p>"You in there!" he called. "Can any of you release us from these
  things?"</p>

  <p>Evidently, that was a mistake. There was a terrified rustling within and a
  hurried exodus from some other door. The Messenger took up its refrain with
  maddening promptness. Abandoning hope of aid, once again he picked up Evanie
  and tramped into the darkness.</p>

  <p>The demon on his shoulder finally let him sleep. It was just dawn when he
  awoke, and scarcely had he opened his eyes on this second morning of his
  torturous trek when the clicking voice resumed its chant. He made no attempt
  to resist it, but rose and struggled on with his burden. Now he followed a
  clay road on which he could avoid tearing thorns and branches.</p>

  <p>No more than a mile from the village he topped a rise to view a wide black
  highway, perhaps the same over which he and Jan Orm and Evanie had sped to
  Urbs&mdash;just two days ago! He found the rubbery surface somewhat less
  tiring and managed a little more distance between rests. But the journey was
  painfully slow. Yet the Messenger never hurried him. He was permitted ample
  rest.</p>

  <p>Now and again vehicles hummed past, mostly giant trucks. Occasionally a
  speeding machine slowed as if to stop, but one glimpse on the mistiness on
  his shoulder sent the driver whizzing on. No one, apparently, dared
  association with the bearer of that dread badge of the Master's enmity. It
  was with amazement, therefore, that</p>

  <p>Connor saw a truck actually stopping, and heard a cheerful invitation to
  "Come on in!"</p>

  <p>He clambered laboriously into the cab, placing Evanie on the seat beside
  him, holding her against him. He thanked the driver, a pleasant-featured
  youth, and relaxed, silent.</p>

  <p>"Weed trouble, eh?" the driver asked. He stared at Connor's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Say, you must be a pretty important Weed to rate a Messenger." He glanced
  sideward at Connor and suddenly grinned. "I know you now! You're the fellow
  that carried the beam when hell popped Sunday. Lord! Stood right up to the
  beam!" In his tone was deep admiration.</p>

  <p>Connor said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're in for it, all right," the youth resumed cheerfully. "You
  blew down some of the Master's men, and that's bad!"</p>

  <p>"What did he do with the others?" Connor asked gloomily. "They couldn't
  all get away."</p>

  <p>"He only picked up the leaders. Nine of 'em. Vision didn't say what he
  did. Papers say he released some of 'em. Girl who thinks she looks like the
  Princess."</p>

  <p>Maris, thought Connor. And Evanie was the tenth of the decemvirate. He
  himself was tossed in for good measure. Well, perhaps he might bargain for
  Evanie's release. After all, he had something to trade.</p>

  <p>It was mid-afternoon before they looked down on Kaatskill, and Connor
  realized in astonishment the distance over which they must have flashed in
  the freight tube. Then he forgot all else as Urbs Minor appeared with its
  thousands of towers and, far across the valley, the misty peaks that were the
  colossus, Greater Urbs.</p>

  <p>The truck kept to the ground level. The mighty buildings, shielded by the
  upper streets from sight, were less spectacular here, but their vast bases
  seemed to press upon the ground like a range of mountains, until Connor
  wondered why the solid earth did not sink beneath their weight. Millions upon
  millions of tons of metal and masonry&mdash;and all of it as if it rested on
  his own brain, so despondent did he feel.</p>

  <p>Presently they were on Palace Avenue. Even the ground level of that mighty
  street was crowded. Connor already knew its almost legendary reputation. What
  the Via Appia was to Rome, or Broadway to America of yore, Palace Avenue now
  was to the world. Main street of the planet; highway of six&mdash;no, the
  seven&mdash;continents. For Antarctica was an inhabited continent now.</p>

  <p>When the unbelievably magnificent Twin Towers came into clean view the
  truck came to a halt. Connor climbed out and turned to pick up Evanie.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said. "You made the road to hell a lot easier."</p>

  <p>The youth grinned.</p>

  <p>"'S nothing. Good chances, Weed. You'll need 'em!"</p>

  <p>Connor turned for the long ascent to the Palace. He trudged up the
  interminable flight of steps, passing crowds of Urbans who stared and gave
  him wide passageway. He moved close under the great, brooding, diorite statue
  of Holland, into the north doorway of the Palace, where a guard stepped
  hastily aside to admit him.</p>

  <p>Through a door to his right came the clatter and rustle of voices and
  machines, engaged in the business of administering a world government. To his
  left was a closed door, and ahead the hall debouched into a room so colossal
  that at first it seemed an illusion.</p>

  <p>He strode in. Along the far wall, a thousand feet away, was a row of
  seats&mdash;thrones, rather&mdash;each on a dais or platform perhaps ten feet
  above the floor, and each apparently occupied. Perhaps fifty of them. Before
  the central one stood a group of people, and a few guards flanked it. Then,
  as he approached, he realized that all but the central throne were occupied
  only by images, by cleverly worked statues of bronze. No&mdash;two central
  thrones held living forms.</p>

  <p>He pushed his way roughly through the knot of people, carefully deposited
  Evanie on the steps ascending to the seat, and glared defiantly at the
  Master.</p>

  <p>For a moment, so intent was his gaze at the man he had come bitterly to
  hate, through all the torture of his forced trip, that he did not shift his
  eyes to the figure who sat beside the Master. The Princess of whom he had
  heard, he supposed&mdash;the beautiful cruel Margaret of Urbs who, with her
  brother, ruled with an iron hand.</p>

  <p>But he was not interested in her now. Her immortal brother claimed all his
  attention, all his defiance. Just for a breath, though, Connor's eyes did
  flicker in her direction&mdash;and instantly he stood stockstill, frozen,
  wondering if at last he had lost his mind. For here, before his staring eyes,
  was the most incredible thing he had come upon in all this incredible new
  world! And what held him spell-bound was not so much the utter, unbelievable,
  fantastic beauty of the woman&mdash;or girl&mdash;who sat upon the throne of
  Urbs, as was the fact that he knew her! Gazing at her, frozen in utter
  surprise and fascination, Tom Connor knew in that moment that the cruel
  Margaret of Urbs and the inky-haired, white-robed girl with whom he had spent
  those unforgettable moments in the wildwood outside the village of Ormon were
  one and the same!</p>

  <p>There could be no possible doubt of that, though in her emerald green eyes
  now was no friendly light as she looked down at him haughtily. In that same
  manner she might show her distaste for some crawling thing that had annoyed
  her. But not even her changed expression, not even her rich garb that had
  replaced her white robe of sylvan simplicity, could alter the fact that here
  before Tom Connor was his woman of the woods, his girl of mystery, the girl
  who had unfolded to him the history of this more and more astonishing age
  into which Fate had drawn him.</p>

  <p>Not by the slightest flicker of a long, black, curling eye-lash did she
  show that she had even seen Connor before. But even in his own quick
  resentment that swiftly followed his frozen moment of surprise, the man from
  another age uncomfortably realized that her fascination for him, the sway of
  her bewildering beauty, was as great as it had been the first moment he had
  gazed upon her.</p>

  <p>His own predicament&mdash;Evanie&mdash;everything&mdash;was forgotten, as
  if he were hypnotized.</p>

  <p>Instead of a gauzy, white robe that was in itself revealing, but with a
  touch of poetry and mysticism, she now wore the typical revealing costume of
  Urbs&mdash;rose bodice, and short kirtle of golden scales. And that hair of
  hers&mdash;never would Connor forget it&mdash;so black that it glinted blue
  in the light. Nor would he ever forget her skin, so transparently clear, with
  its tint like the patina over ancient silverbronze.</p>

  <p>Looking at her now, Connor could see how Maris might claim a resemblance,
  but it was no more than the resemblance of a candle to the sun. Evanie was
  beautiful, too, but her loveliness was that of a human being, while the
  beauty of this girl who sat upon a throne was unearthly, unbelievable,
  immortal.</p>

  <p>She sat with her slim legs thrust carelessly before her, her elbow on the
  arm of her chair, her chin in her cupped hand, and gazed indifferently from
  strange sea-green eyes into the vastness of the giant chamber. Never once did
  she glance at Connor after her first swift distasteful survey.</p>

  <p>Her exquisite features were expressionless, or expressive only of complete
  boredom. Though there did seem to Connor that there was the faintest trace of
  that unforgettable mockery in the set of her perfect lips. Before he could
  tear his gaze away from her she moved slightly. With the movement something
  flamed on her breast&mdash;a great flower of seven petals that flashed and
  glistened in a dozen colors, as if made of jewels.</p>

  <p>It took all of Connor's will power to keep his eyes from her, even though
  in that moment of long silence that had fallen in the throne room with his
  entry, he was resenting her, loathing her for what she was&mdash;instead of
  what he had thought her to be.</p>

  <p>Deliberately he faced the Master, head up, defiant. Let the
  Master&mdash;let his Princess sister&mdash;do what they pleased. He was ready
  for them!</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">14. THE MASTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The man at whom Connor stared, the man whose features he had
  seen before on Evanie's coin, seemed no older than the middle twenties. He
  was dark-eyed, and his black hair fell in a smooth helmet below his ears.</p>

  <p>The eyes were strange, piercing, shrewd, as if they alone had aged, as if
  they were the receptacles of these centuries of experience. The mouth was set
  in a thin, cold line and yet, strangely enough, there was a faintly humorous
  quirk to its corners. Or not so strangely, either, decided Connor. A man
  <i>must</i> have a sense of humor to survive seven centuries.</p>

  <p>And then a deep, resonant voice sounded as the Master spoke.</p>

  <p>"I see, Thomas Connor," he said ironically, "that you received my
  Messenger hospitably. And this is little Evanie!" His voice changed. "Good
  blood," he mused. "The mingling of the blood of Martin Sair with that of
  Montmerci."</p>

  <p>Connor glared belligerently. "Release us from these vicious Messengers of
  yours, will you?" he demanded angrily. "We're here."</p>

  <p>The Master nodded mildly, and spoke briefly into a mouthpiece on a black
  table beside him. There was a moment's pause, then a tingling shock as the
  unbound energies of the Messenger grounded through Connor's body. Evanie
  quivered and moaned as the thing on her shoulder vanished, but she lay as
  quiet as ever.</p>

  <p>Connor shook himself. Free! He flashed an angry frown at the impassive
  Master, but his eyes kept straying back to the Princess, who still had not
  even glanced at him after that one first instant.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Master quietly, "your revolution was a trifle abortive,
  wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Up to now!" snapped Connor.</p>

  <p>His hatred suddenly overwhelmed him. The impulse for revenge shook him
  bodily. Swiftly stooping, he snatched Evanie's revolver from her belt, and
  held the trigger while twelve shots spat full at the Master's face in a
  continuous steaming roar.</p>

  <p>The steam moved lazily away. The Master sat without change of expression,
  uninjured, while from far above a few splinters of glass from a shattered
  skylight tinkled about him. Of course, Connor reflected bitterly, the man
  would be protected by an inductive field. Glass had been able to pass through
  that inductive field, where Connor's bullets could not, but their glass was a
  dielectric.</p>

  <p>He cast the empty gun aside and stared sullenly at the man on the throne.
  Then, despite his efforts, his gaze was again drawn to the Princess.</p>

  <p>She was no longer looking abstractedly into vacancy. At the crash of the
  shots she had shifted slightly, without raising her chin from her hand, and
  was watching him. Their glances crossed. It was like the tingle of the
  Messenger's discharge to him as he met the cool green eyes, inscrutable and
  expressionless and utterly disinterested. And in them was no slightest hint
  of recognition! For reasons of her own she did not mean to recognize him.
  Well, two could play at that game.</p>

  <p>"Your impulses take violent form," said the Master coldly. "Why do you,
  who claim to be a newcomer to this age, hate me so?"</p>

  <p>"Hate you?" Connor echoed fiercely. "Why shouldn't I? Didn't you put me
  through two days and nights of hell with your damned Messenger?"</p>

  <p>"But there would have been no torment had you obeyed immediately."</p>

  <p>"But Evanie!" Connor snapped. "See what you've done to her!"</p>

  <p>"She was interfering. I didn't want her here, particularly, but she might
  have released you from the Messenger. If you'd left her to herself, I would
  have freed her within a few hours."</p>

  <p>"Kind, aren't you?" sneered Connor. "You're so confident in your own
  powers that you don't even punish revolt. Well, you're a tyrant,
  nevertheless, and some day you'll get more than you bargain for. I could have
  done it myself!"</p>

  <p>He glanced again at the Princess. Was there the faintest flicker of
  interest in her imperious eyes?</p>

  <p>"And what would you have done," queried the Master amiably, "if you had
  been running the revolution?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty!" retorted Connor. "In the first place, I'd never have shipped
  weapons into Urbs through the public tubes. You were bound to discover that,
  and surprise was our greatest ally. I'd have had 'em made right here, or near
  here. There must be Weed factories around, and if not, I'd have bought
  one."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said the Master interestedly. "What else?"</p>

  <p>"I'd have had a real organization&mdash;not this cumbersome leader upon
  leader pyramid. I'd have laid real plans, planted spies in the Palace. And
  finally, your deflectors. I didn't know of them, or we could have won even as
  things were. My&mdash;associates&mdash;forgot, rather carelessly, to mention
  them."</p>

  <p>The Master smiled. "That was an error. If you had known of them, what
  would you have done?"</p>

  <p>"I'd have used wooden bullets instead of metal ones," said Connor boldly.
  "Your induction field won't stop wood. And your ionic beams&mdash;why the
  devil couldn't we have used metal screen armor? We could have closed the
  circuit with that instead of with our bodies!"</p>

  <p>He was aware, though he steadfastly refused to look at her, that the
  Princess was watching him now with undisguised mockery, her lovely lips
  parted in the ghost of a smile.</p>

  <p>"True," said the Master with a curious expression. "You could have." He
  frowned. "I did not believe the stories I first heard of you&mdash;that you
  were a Sleeper who had awakened after a sleep of a thousand years. They were
  too fantastic for belief. I thought you were meaning to capitalize on the
  Sleep in some way known only to yourself&mdash;since I understand you had no
  bank deposit to draw interest for you and make you a wealthy man. Now I am
  inclined to believe you have come from another age&mdash;an age of
  wisdom&mdash;and you're a dangerous man, Thomas Connor. You're a brave man to
  bait me as you do, and a strong one, but dangerous; too dangerous. Yet I'm
  rather sorry your courage and strength has been bred out of the race."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill you," said the Master softly. "I'm sorry. Were it not
  for Evanie, I might be tempted to ask for your oath of allegiance and release
  you, but I can't trust a man who loves a Weed woman. It's a chance I dare not
  take, though I bitterly regret losing your blood and your ancient knowledge.
  If it consoles you, know that I intend to free Evanie. She's harmless to me.
  Any trouble she might cause can be easily handled. But you &mdash;you're
  different."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," retorted Connor.</p>

  <p>Like a compass needle his eyes did return to the face of the Princess,
  then. Even now, condemned to die for the second time in his strange life, he
  gazed fascinated at her, smiling at her with an echo of her own mockery.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose," said the Master hopefully, "that you'd consent
  to&mdash;say, marry Evanie and perpetuate your blood before you die. I need
  that ancient strain of yours. Our race has grown weak."</p>

  <p>"I would not!" Connor said.</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" said the other in sudden eagerness. "Is it true, as an Ormon
  prisoner told us, and which I scorned to believe, having then no faith in
  this thousand-year Sleep, that you understand the ancient mathematics?
  Calculus, logarithms, and such lost branches?"</p>

  <p>"It's quite true," snapped Connor. "Who told you?"</p>

  <p>"Your Ormon chemist. Would you consent to impart that knowledge? The world
  needs it."</p>

  <p>"For my life, perhaps."</p>

  <p>The Master hesitated, frowning.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said at last. "Invaluable as the knowledge is, the danger
  you, personally, present, outweighs it. I could trick you out of your
  secrets. I could promise you life, get your information, then quietly kill
  you. I do not stoop to that. If you desire, your knowledge goes to the grave
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks again," retorted Connor. "You might remember that I could have
  concealed my dangerous character, too. I needn't have pointed out the
  weakness in your defenses."</p>

  <p>"I already knew them. I also know the weaknesses of Weed mentality." He
  paused. "I'm truly sorry, but&mdash;this seems to be the end of our
  interview." He turned as if to gesture to the guards along the wall.</p>

  <p>Margaret of Urbs flashed a strange, inscrutable glance at Connor, and
  leaned toward the Master. She spoke in low, inaudible tones, but
  emphatically, insistently. The Master looked up at Connor.</p>

  <p>"I reconsider," he said coolly. "I grant you your life for the present on
  one condition&mdash;that you make no move against me while you are in the
  Palace. I do not ask your word not to escape. I only warn you that a
  Messenger will follow. Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>Connor thought only a moment. "I do."</p>

  <p>"Then you will remain within the Palace." The Master snapped an order to a
  guard. "I will send doctors to attend little Evanie. That's all."</p>

  <p>The guard, as tall a man as Connor himself, stepped forward and gathered
  Evanie in his arms. Connor followed him, but could not resist a backward
  glance at the Princess, who sat once more staring idly into space. But in his
  mind was the thought now, exultant in spite of his resentment, that at least
  she had not forgotten him, or those hours together in the woods.</p>

  <p>They moved into the hall, and into an elevator that flashed upward with
  sudden and sickening acceleration. He had glimpses of floor after floor
  through the glass doors as they mounted high into the North Tower.</p>

  <p>The motion ceased. Connor followed the guard into a room lit by the red
  glow of sunset, and watched as he deposited Evanie on a white-covered bed,
  then turned, and threw open a door. "That is yours," the guard said briefly,
  and departed.</p>

  <p>Luxury breathed through the perfumed air of the rooms, but Connor had no
  time for such observations. He bent anxiously over the pallid-faced Evanie,
  wondering miserably why the release of the Messenger had not awakened her. He
  was still gazing when a knock sounded, and two doctors entered.</p>

  <p>One, the younger, set instantly to work examining the scratch on the
  girl's ankle, while the other pried open her eyes, parted her still lips,
  bent close to listen to her breathing.</p>

  <p>"Brain-burnt," he announced. "Brain-burnt by a vitergon&mdash;the
  Messenger. Severe electrolepsis."</p>

  <p>"Lord!" Connor muttered anxiously. "Is it is it very serious?"</p>

  <p>"Serious? Bah!" The older man spun on him. "It's exactly what happens to
  Sleepers&mdash;paralysis of the pre-Rolandic areas, the will, the
  consciousness. Like&mdash;if I'm properly informed&mdash;what happened to
  you! It might be serious if we let her sleep for a half a century, not
  otherwise." He stepped to an ebony table beside the bed, decanting a ruby
  liquid into a tumbler. "Here," he said. "We'll try a good stiff
  stimulant."</p>

  <p>He poured the ruddy fluid between Evanie's lips, and when the last drop
  had vanished, stood over her watching. She moved convulsively and moaned in
  agony.</p>

  <p>"Hah!" said the doctor. "That'll burn some life into her!" The girl
  shuddered and opened dazed and pain-racked eyes. "So! You can handle her
  now," he called to the younger man, and moved out through the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Evanie!" croaked Connor tensely. "Are you all right? How do you
  feel?"</p>

  <p>The dazed eyes rested on him.</p>

  <p>"I burn! Water&mdash;oh, please&mdash;water!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">15. TWO WOMEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Tom Connor glanced a silent question at the doctor. At his
  nod, Connor seized the empty tumbler and looked frantically for water. He
  found it beyond a door, where a silent stream gushed from the mouth of a
  grotesque face into a broad basin.</p>

  <p>Evanie drank eagerly, thirstily, when he brought it to her. She stared
  bewilderedly about the luxurious room, and turned questioning eyes on
  Connor.</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"In Urbs. In the Palace."</p>

  <p>Comprehension dawned.</p>

  <p>"The Messengers! Oh, my God!" She shivered in fright. "How long&mdash;have
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just two days, Evanie. I carried you here."</p>

  <p>"What is to&mdash;to be done with us?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, dear. But you're safe."</p>

  <p>She frowned a moment in the effort to compose her still dazed and
  bewildered mind.</p>

  <p>"Well," she murmured finally, "nothing can be done about it. I'm ashamed
  to have been so weak. Was he&mdash;very angry?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't seem so." The memory of the Master's impassive face rose in his
  mind, and with it the vision of the exquisite features of the Princess.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the girl who sits on his right is the Princess, isn't she?" he
  asked. "Who is she?"</p>

  <p>Evanie nodded. "Every one knows that. On his left sits Martin Sair, the
  Giver of Life, and on his right&mdash; Why do you ask that?" She glanced up
  troubled, suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Because she saved my life. She intervened for me."</p>

  <p>"Tom!" Evanie's voice was horror-filled. "Tom, that was Margaret of Urbs,
  the Black Flame!" Her eyes were terrified. "Tom, she's
  dangerous&mdash;poisonous&mdash;deadly! You mustn't even look at her. She's
  driven men&mdash;I don't know how many&mdash;to suicide. She's killed
  men&mdash;she's tortured them. Don't ever go near, her, Tom! If she saved
  you, it wasn't out of mercy, because she's
  merciless&mdash;ruthless&mdash;utterly pitiless!"</p>

  <p>Scarcely conscious as yet, the girl was on the verge of hysteria. Her
  voice grew shrill, and Connor glanced apprehensively at the young doctor's
  face.</p>

  <p>Evanie turned ashen pale.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;feel&mdash;dizzy," she choked. "I'm going&mdash;to</p>

  <p>The doctor sprang forward. "You mustn't!" he snapped. "We can't let her
  sleep again. We must walk her! Quickly!"</p>

  <p>Between them they dragged the collapsing girl from the bed, walking her up
  and down the chamber. A measure of strength returned, and she walked weakly
  between them, back. and forth. Then, abruptly, they paused at the sound of a
  sharp rap on the chamber door.</p>

  <p>The doctor called out a summons. Two Urban guards in glittering metal
  strode through the entrance, and stood like images on either side of it. One
  of them intoned slowly, deep as an anthem:</p>

  <p><i>"Margarita, Urbis Regina, Sororque Domini!"</i></p>

  <p>The Princess! Connor and the doctor stood frozen, and even Evanie raised
  weary eyes as the Princess entered, striding imperiously into the room with
  the scaly gold of her kirtle glittering crimson in the last rays of the sun.
  She swept her cold eyes over the startled group, and suddenly her exquisite
  features flashed into a flame of anger. The glorious lips parted.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" she spat. "You utter fool!"</p>

  <p>Connor flushed in sudden anger, then realized that the Princess addressed,
  not him, but the doctor at Evanie's left, who was fear-stricken and
  pallid.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" repeated Margaret of Urbs. "Walking an electroleptic! Put her
  to bed&mdash;instantly. Let her sleep. Do you want to risk brain fever?"</p>

  <p>The frightened physician moved to obey, but Connor interposed.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment." He shot an accusing glance at the Princess. "Do you know
  anything about this? Are you a doctor?"</p>

  <p>He received a cool glance from her narrowed green eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," she drawled, "that I've learned nothing in seven hundred
  years?" And he alone caught the full implication of her words. She was subtly
  reminding him of how once before she had given him evidence of how vast was
  her knowledge. She turned imperiously. "Obey!" she snapped.</p>

  <p>Connor stood aside as the doctor complied in panic. "Where's Kringar?" the
  Princess demanded.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness," babbled the medico, "he gave the girl a stimulant and
  left. He said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right. Get out." She nodded at the impassive guards. "You, too."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind them. Margaret of Urbs bent over Evanie, now fully
  conscious, but pale as death. She placed a dainty hand on the girl's
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"Sleep," she said softly.</p>

  <p>"Leave me here alone, please," Evanie begged, trembling. "I'm afraid of
  you. I don't trust you, and I won't sleep. I'm afraid to sleep again."</p>

  <p>Connor stood miserably irresolute. While he hesitated, the Princess fixed
  her eyes on Evanie's; they glowed emerald in the evening dusk as she
  repeated, "Sleep!"</p>

  <p>He saw the fear vanish from Evanie's face, leaving her features as blank
  as those of an image. Then she was sleeping.</p>

  <p>The Princess faced Tom Connor across the bed. She took a black cigarette
  from a box on the ebony table. Itglowed magically as she removed it, and she
  blew a plume of perfumed smoke at him.</p>

  <p>"Worried, aren't you?" she asked mockingly.</p>

  <p>"You know I am."</p>

  <p>"Well, rest your mind. I mean no harm to Evanie."</p>

  <p>"But do you know what you're doing?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, low laughter soft as rain in a pool.</p>

  <p>"See here," she said, still with a taunt in her eyes, "I conceived the
  vitergons. Martin Sair created them, but <i>I</i> conceived them. I know what
  harm they can do, and I know the cure for that harm. Do you trust me?"</p>

  <p>"Not entirely."</p>

  <p>"Well, you have small choice." She exhaled another cloud of scented smoke.
  "Your little Weed is safe." She moved toward the adjoining room. "There's a
  bath in here," she said. "Use it, and then put on some Urban clothes. I'm
  inclined to dine with you this evening."</p>

  <p>He was startled. He stared back at the mocking perfection of her face, but
  the green eyes carried no readable expression, as she came closer so that
  only Connor could hear what she said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to recall a more pleasant meeting," she said gently. "Oh, I have
  not forgotten you&mdash;if that is what you are thinking. I recall every word
  of that day in the woods, but it may be better if you forget it, publicly.
  Margaret of Urbs does not care to have her private business broadcast to the
  city. Nor is it the affair of anyone here&mdash;or any business of
  yours&mdash;that I choose to get away from them all occasionally, with only
  the birds and the trees to bear me company. You will do well to bear that in
  mind, Thomas Connor!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly her voice took on a taunting note, and the mockery in the emerald
  eyes was plain. "Perhaps," she said, "I have another reason for commanding
  you to dine with me. I may want to steal your knowledge&mdash;then kill you.
  I might have more than one reason for wanting to do that, but you fired a
  dozen shots at me on Sunday, Thomas Connor, as I stood on the balcony of the
  Tower. I do not fail to repay such debts."</p>

  <p>"It will take more than you to steal what I will not give," he growled,
  and turned into his room, closing the door.</p>

  <p>He stepped instantly to the hall door, opened it and gazed squarely into
  the impassive eyes of an Urban guard standing quietly opposite. So he was
  watched!</p>

  <p>He turned back into the chamber, stripped, and entered the water of the
  pool, reveling in the refreshing coolness. As he bathed he could look out a
  window; he saw that the colossal Palace was built as a hollow square.
  Opposite him rose the mountainous spire of the South Tower, and far below
  were the wide pool and green-bordered walks of the Inner Gardens.</p>

  <p>Drying his glowing body, he glanced distastefully at the sweat-stained
  pile of Weed clothing on the floor. In a closet he found Urban dress. It gave
  him a queer, masqueradelike feeling to don the barbaric metal corselet and
  kirtle, but the garments were cool, and befitted his great frame.</p>

  <p>Ready at last, he flung open the door to Evanie's room.</p>

  <p>Margaret of Urbs sat cross-legged on the bed, beside Evanie, smoking her
  black cigarette. Her green eyes passed appraisingly over Connor, and the
  glint of mockery was again in their depths.</p>

  <p>"I always thought the ancient sculptors exaggerated their contemporaries'
  physiques," she said, smiling. "I was wrong... But you're to kneel when you
  enter my presence, Thomas Connor. You didn't before."</p>

  <p>"And I don't now. As an enemy, I owe you no such respect."</p>

  <p>"As a gentleman you do, however. But never mind&mdash;I'm hungry.
  Come."</p>

  <p>"Why can't we eat here? I won't leave Evanie."</p>

  <p>"Evanie will be dull company for a dozen hours more. I'll send a maid to
  undress and bathe her."</p>

  <p>"You're very considerate, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>She laughed maliciously.</p>

  <p>"I have no quarrel with her. But I have with you. Come!"</p>

  <p>The glorious green eyes swept him. Both eyes and voice&mdash;a voice that
  now seemed to glory in malice&mdash;were so different from those of the girl
  of the woods that it was hard for Tom Connor to believe they were the same.
  But he knew they were. And now that he and she were alone every gesture
  seemed to admit that.</p>

  <p>She rose without a glance at Evanie's still, white faceand Connor followed
  her reluctantly past the guard, whose challenge she silenced with a
  peremptory word, and over to the bank of elevators.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" he asked as the cage dropped, plummetlike.</p>

  <p>"To a room of mine in the South Tower, I think. We'll have to go all the
  way down and walk across."</p>

  <p>The cage came to a sickening halt. He followed her through the vast
  emptiness of the room of thrones, noting curiously that both her own throne
  and that of the Master were now occupied by cleverly executed bronze figures.
  He paused to examine the effigy of the Princess, wondering how long ago it
  had been cast.</p>

  <p>"Third century," she said as if in answer to his thought. "Five hundred
  years ago. I was a child of two hundred and twenty then&mdash;and happier."
  Sardonic amusement was in her face and manner. "There was no Black Flame in
  those days. I was the madcap Princess Peggy then, reckless and daring, but
  sweet and noble. Or so they thought."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you deserved the reputation," Connor observed acidly. He meant
  to follow her lead in whatever she said or did. She would have no complaint
  that he was the first to mention their previous meeting. If she said no more
  about it, then it would not be mentioned at all.</p>

  <p>She flashed her green eyes on him, eyes as icy as the green cap over
  Antarctica.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I deserve it no longer," she said in tones so cold that they
  startled. "Come on."</p>

  <p>There was something fascinating, almost hypnotic, about this weirdly
  beautiful being.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather dine with your image there," he remarked drily.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">16. IMMORTALITY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margaret of Urbs laughed and led Connor through a door
  behind the line of thrones.</p>

  <p>"Martin Sail's laboratory," she explained, gesturing at the chaotic
  confusion of glassware and microscopes. "And this"&mdash;passing into a
  chamber beyond&mdash;"is mine."</p>

  <p>The place seemed more like a luxurious, sumptuously furnished library than
  a laboratory. There were shelves upon shelves of books, hundreds of them
  obviously ancient, a great vision screen, a delicately inlaid desk, and here
  and there bits of statuary.</p>

  <p>"Laboratory!" he echoed. "What do you do here?"</p>

  <p>"I think. When I want to work I use Martin's." She picked up a white
  carving from the desk. "See here&mdash;some of your ancient work." She added
  a trifle sadly, "We have no artists able to create such beauty today. It's a
  tragedy that the arms were broken. During the Dark Centuries, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Connor looked at the exquisite little ivory replica of the Venus de Milo
  and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Arms broken!" he scoffed. "That's a copy of an ancient Greek statue of
  Praxiteles. The arms were broken two thousand years before my time!"</p>

  <p>"A copy! Where's the original? I want it!"</p>

  <p>"It was in the Louvre, in Paris."</p>

  <p>"Paris is in ruins. Do you know where the Louvre stood?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then tell me! I'll have it searched for. Tell me!"</p>

  <p>He gazed into eyes sincerely eager; the eyes now of the white-clad girl of
  the woods who had lolled with him on a mossy woodland bank and told him
  stories of the ages. That girl had loved beauty, too; had been seeking it,
  watching her own reflection in the black pool. It amazed him that now in her
  role as the frigid princess she could still be so avid for beauty.</p>

  <p>"That's a bit of information I withhold," he said slowly, "until I can
  trade it for something else I may want. Evanie's safety, or my own."</p>

  <p>The mocking light returned to her eyes. "You amuse me, Weed!" she said
  curtly. "But very well." She led the way to the South Tower elevators.</p>

  <p>She was silent during the long ride to the very pinnacle of the tower.
  They emerged into a small chamber walled on every side in glass, and Connor
  stood awe-struck as the city spread out before them. The palace over-topped
  even the colossal structures around the Park. He gazed speechless at the
  mighty stretch of peaks out-lined in light.</p>

  <p>The Princess turned to a black screened box.</p>

  <p>"Send dinner to the tower," she ordered. "I want&mdash;Oh, anything. And
  send Sora to the room of Evanie Sair."</p>

  <p>She flung herself carelessly on a purple couch along a glassed wall, and
  Connor seated himself.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said, "what will you take for your knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"I won't bargain with you. I don't trust you."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"You see me through Evanie's eyes, Tom Connor, and once&mdash;well, once I
  thought you were attracted to me. But no matter. We will not again speak of
  that time&mdash;though it does seem odd that Fate should have had me set my
  Triangle down where you were. When I was just wandering restlessly,
  aimlessly, seeking peace in loveliness... It's too bad you fancy yourself in
  love with Evanie. For I assure you she doesn't love you."</p>

  <p>"That's not true!" he flared.</p>

  <p>She laughed, and instantly her touch of wistfulness was gone, to be
  replaced by wickedness.</p>

  <p>"Be careful," she mocked, "or I'll exact payment for that insult as well.
  But it was no lie."</p>

  <p>He controlled his anger.</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because when I forced her to sleep, frightened as she was, she didn't
  turn to you. She fought me herself. If she had loved you, she'd have
  instinctively called you for help."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you."</p>

  <p>"Then you're a fool," she observed indifferently, and turned from him
  disinterestedly at the entry of two servants bearing food.</p>

  <p>They slipped a table between the two and served a sumptuous repast, with
  dishes Connor failed to recognize. He ate hungrily, but the Princess, despite
  her professed hunger, picked and chose and ate scarcely anything. It was a
  silent meal, but afterward, smoking one of the black, magically lighted
  cigarettes, he prepared to ask certain questions.</p>

  <p>She forestalled him. With green eyes glowing sardonically, she looked
  straight at him.</p>

  <p>"Why do you love Evanie instead of me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You? Because you are not what I thought you were. Instead of being pure
  and sweet, you revel in evil. That is not hearsay; it is the historical
  record of your seven hundred years. For that I hate you, thoroughly and
  completely."</p>

  <p>She narrowed her glorious eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then you hate without reason," she said. "Am I not more powerful than
  Evanie, more intelligent, stronger, and even, I think, more beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"You're outrageously, incredibly, fantastically beautiful!" he cried, as
  if the acknowledgement were wrenched from him against his will. "You're
  perhaps the most beautiful woman since Helen of Troy, and the most dangerous.
  And yet I hate you."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because of your lack of a little factor called character. I concede your
  beauty and your brilliance, but Evanie is sweet, kind, honest, and lovable.
  One loves character, not characteristics."</p>

  <p>"Character!" she echoed. "You know nothing of my character. I have a
  hundred characters! No one can be so gentle as I&mdash;nor so cruel."</p>

  <p>The faintest ripple of a mocking smile crossed her exquisite features, and
  then they were suddenly pure as an angel's. Without rising she kicked the
  switch of a vision screen with a dainty, sandaled toe.</p>

  <p>"Control," she said as it glowed. A face appeared.</p>

  <p>"A vitergon set tell to this room," she said cryptically, and then to
  Connor as the face vanished: "There is no scanner here. This chamber and
  Joaquin's in the North Tower are the only two in Urbs lacking them."</p>

  <p>"What of it?"</p>

  <p>"It means, Thomas Connor, that we are in utter privacy."</p>

  <p>He frowned, puzzled. Abruptly he started back in his chair as a flash of
  iridescence flickered. A Messenger! And almost with his start the thing was
  upon him.</p>

  <p>"Tell!" it creaked in his brain. "Tell! Tell! Tell! Tell!"</p>

  <p>He sprang erect.</p>

  <p>"Take it off!" he roared.</p>

  <p>"When I have your knowledge of Venus," his tormentor said carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Take it off, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or what?" Her smile was guileless, sweet, innocent.</p>

  <p>"This!" he blazed, and covered the space between them in a bound, his
  right hand clutching the delicate curve of her throat, his left pressing her
  shoulders fiercely down against the cushions.</p>

  <p>"Take it off," he bellowed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a sound behind him, the grating of doors, and he was
  torn away, held by four grim-faced guards. Of course! The operator of the
  Messenger could hear his words. He should have remembered that.</p>

  <p>The Black Flame pushed herself to a sitting position, and her face was no
  angel's but the face of a lovely demon. Green hell glittered in her eyes, but
  she only reached shakily for the vision switch.</p>

  <p>"Tell Control to release," she choked huskily, and faced Tom Connor.</p>

  <p>The Messenger tingled and vanished. The Princess rose unsteadily, but her
  glorious eyes burned cold as she snatched a weapon from the nearest
  guard.</p>

  <p>"Get out, all of you!" she snapped.</p>

  <p>The men backed away. Connor faced her.</p>

  <p>"I should have killed you!" he muttered. "For humanity's sake."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you should have, Thomas Connor." Her tones were bitterly cold. "For,
  then you would have died quickly and mercifully for murder, but now&mdash;now
  you die in the way I choose, and it will be neither quick nor merciful. I
  cannot"&mdash;her voice shook&mdash;"bear the touch of violence!" Her free
  hand rubbed her throat. "For this&mdash;you suffer!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged. "It was worth it. I know your character now! I no longer have
  to guess."</p>

  <p>Mockery gleamed.</p>

  <p>"Do you?" Her face changed suddenly, and again it was soft and pure and
  wistful. "Do you?" she repeated, in tones that were sad, but held that bell-
  like quality he so well remembered. "You don't. Do you think the Black Flame
  is the true Margaret of Urbs? Do you realize what immortality means?" Her
  exquisite face was unutterably mournful as she thrust the weapon into her
  belt. "You think it's a blessing, don't you? You wonder, don't you, why
  Joaquin has withheld it from everybody?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. I think it's tyranny. It's selfish."</p>

  <p>"Selfish! Oh, God!" Her voice shook. "Why, he withheld it from his own
  mother! Blessing? It's a curse! I bear it out of my duty to Joaquin, else I'd
  have killed myself centuries ago. I still may, do you hear. I still may!" Her
  voice rose.</p>

  <p>Appalled, he stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"You ask why! Seven hundred years. Seven&mdash;hundred&mdash;years! Denied
  love! How do I dare love a man who ages day by day, until his teeth yellow
  and his hair falls out, and he's decrepit, senile, old? Denied children!
  Immortals can't have children. Don't you think I'd trade immortality for
  motherhood? Don't you?"</p>

  <p>Connor was speechless. Her voice rose to a tense pitch.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what seven hundred years mean? I do! It means seven centuries
  of friendlessness. Do you wonder that I run away to the woods sometimes,
  seeking the companionship, the friendship, the love, that everywhere else is
  denied me? How can I make friends among people who vanish like ghosts? Who
  among the dry scientists of the Immortals is alone&mdash;and I'm
  bored&mdash;bored&mdash;bored!" Her green eyes were tearbright, but when he
  opened his lips to speak, she stopped him with an imperious gesture. "I'm
  sick to death of immortality! I want someone who loves me. Someone I'd love
  to grow old with, and children to grow up beside me. I want&mdash;I
  want&mdash;a friend!"</p>

  <p>She was sobbing. Impulsively he moved toward her, taking her hand.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he choked. "I'm sorry. I didn't understand." "And you&mdash;will
  help me?" Her exquisite features were pleading, tear-streaked.</p>

  <p>"The best I can," he promised.</p>

  <p>Her perfect lips were two rosy temptations as she drew him toward her. He
  bent to kiss her gently&mdash;and sprang back as if his own lips had in truth
  touched a flame.</p>

  <p>Laughter! He looked into mocking eyes whose only tears were those of
  sardonic mirth!</p>

  <p>"So!" she said, her red lips taunting. "There is the first taste, Thomas
  Connor, but there will be more before I kill you. You may go."</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">17. THE DESTINY OF MAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You devil!" Connor choked, and then whirled at a soft click
  behind him. A white envelope lay in a wire basket by the elevator.</p>

  <p>"Hand it to me," said the Flame coolly.</p>

  <p>He snatched it and thrust it at her, in a turmoil of emotion as he watched
  her read it.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" she murmured. "My esteemed brother orders me to keep well away
  from you&mdash;which I shall not do&mdash;and commands you to his quarters at
  once." She yawned. "Take the elevator to any floor below the Tower and ask a
  guard. That's all."</p>

  <p>Yet, as the cage dropped, Connor could not forget that there had been
  something wistful about the Princess, at his last glimpse of her. Somehow,
  try as he would, he couldn't hate her quite whole-heartedly, and he frowned
  as he found his way to the West Chambers. A guard admitted him to an inner
  room, and then retired quietly, leaving him facing the Master, who sat behind
  a paper-littered desk.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of me?" the Master greeted him abruptly.</p>

  <p>Connor was taken aback, unprepared for the question.</p>

  <p>"Why," he stammered, "what would I naturally think of you? You dragged me
  back here by torture. You nearly killed Evanie. Do you think I can easily
  forget or forgive such things?"</p>

  <p>"After all, Thomas Connor, you participated in a revolt against me," the
  Master said suavely. "You wounded eleven of my men. Did the governments of
  your day deal so leniently with treason?"</p>

  <p>"I've wondered why you are so easy on the rebels," he admitted. "Frankly,
  in my time, there'd have been a good many of us lined up against a wall and
  shot."</p>

  <p>The Master shook his head. "Why should I do that? The Weeds are the finest
  of my people. I made the only mistake&mdash;that of giving leisure to a race
  not ready for it. Leisure is what has bred all these minor revolutions. But
  does a father kill his favorite children?"</p>

  <p>"Does a son kill his mother?" retorted Connor. The Master smiled
  bleakly.</p>

  <p>"I see my sister has been talking to you. Yes, I refused immortality to my
  mother. She was an old woman &mdash;ill, infirm. Should I have condemned her
  to added centuries of misery? Immortality does not restore youth."</p>

  <p>The point was incontrovertible.</p>

  <p>"Yet you withhold it from those who have youth," Connor protested. "You
  keep it selfishly as a reward, to bind to yourself all men of ability. You've
  emasculated the rest of humanity."</p>

  <p>"You feel that immortality is a highly desirable reward, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I do! In spite of what your sister says."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," said the Master patiently. "We'll pass the
  question of its desirability; it doesn't matter. But suppose I were to open
  it to the race, to instruct all the doctors in its secrets. Wouldn't it
  immediately halt all development? How can evolution function if no one dies
  and no children are born?"</p>

  <p>That was a puzzler.</p>

  <p>"You could permit it after the birth of children," Connor said.</p>

  <p>"I could. But at the present birthrate, the land areas would provide bare
  standing room in just a century and a half. I could then kill off nine-tenths
  of the population, presumably, but what of the famines and food shortages
  intervening?"</p>

  <p>Connor was silent for a long moment.</p>

  <p>"The fault's with immortality itself!" he burst out vehemently. "Men
  should never have learned that secret!"</p>

  <p>"But they have learned it. Would you have me destroy the knowledge because
  fools envy it&mdash;and envy it mistakenly?"</p>

  <p>"Did you summon me here merely to justify your acts?" Tom Connor snapped
  in reply.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. You possess knowledge invaluable to me. I'd like to convince you
  of my sincerity."</p>

  <p>"You never will."</p>

  <p>"See here," said the Master, still in tones of calm gravity. "Don't ever
  doubt that I could steal your knowledge. I know ways to encompass it, and if
  I failed, others would not fail."</p>

  <p>"The Princess tried that," said Connor grimly. "She will not try it
  again." He fingered a small bronze bust on the desk before him. "And
  incidentally, what's to prevent me from flinging this bronze through your
  skull right now&mdash;killing you, instead of waiting for you to kill
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Your word to make no move against me in the Palace," reminded the Master
  gently.</p>

  <p>Connor's lips tightened. In that moment he realized suddenly what it was
  that had perturbed him so violently. He was beginning to believe the Master
  and he didn't want to! The memory of the Messenger's torture was too recent;
  the picture of Evanie's helplessness was too burning. He was being won over
  against his will, but</p>

  <p>"You win," he growled, releasing the bust. "Go ahead. Tell me what all
  this is leading up to. You must have some objective other than the indefinite
  perpetuation of your own power."</p>

  <p>The Master smiled. "I have. I plan the ultimate destiny of Mankind." He
  held up a hand to still Connor's quick, unbelieving protest. "Listen to me. I
  have bred out criminals by sterilizing, for many centuries, those with
  criminal tendencies. I have raised the general level of intelligence by
  sterilizing the feeble-minded, the incompetent. If we have fewer supreme
  geniuses than your people, we have at least no stupid nor insane&mdash;and
  genius will come.</p>

  <p>"I try, to the best of my knowledge, to improve the race. I think I'm
  succeeding. At least we're far advanced over the barbarians of the Dark
  Centuries, and even, I believe, over the average of your mighty, ancient
  people. I think we're happier." He paused. "Do you?"</p>

  <p>"In a way," Connor conceded. "But even happiness isn't always a fair
  exchange for&mdash;liberty!"</p>

  <p>"Liberty? Suppose I granted liberty? Suppose I abdicated? How long do you
  think it would be before every sort of Weed village was at war with every
  other sort? Do you want the world to break up into another welter of
  quarreling little nations? That's what I found; out of it I've created an
  empire."</p>

  <p>He drummed a finger on the desk, thoughtfully eyeing Connor.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, I've preserved what differences I could. The yellow race was a
  remnant; I've bred it strong again. The red race has gone, but the black is
  growing. And the tag-ends of nations&mdash;I've nourished them."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Connor demanded. "Differences are only grounds for future trouble,
  aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Civilization grows out of differences. No race can produce a high culture
  by itself. There must be an exchange of ideas, and that means that there must
  be differences."</p>

  <p>"You're very sure, aren't you?" Connor taunted.</p>

  <p>"I've spent centuries thinking of it. I'm confident I've found the truth.
  And I do the best I can."</p>

  <p>"I wish&mdash;" Connor paused. "I wish I could believe you!"</p>

  <p>"You can. I never lie."</p>

  <p>"I almost feel I can. You're not the mocking devil your sister is. I
  rather like you."</p>

  <p>A queer smile flickered on the Master's lips.</p>

  <p>"I have instructed her to cease tormenting you. I assume she has been, but
  she'll keep away from you hereafter... Won't you, my dear?"</p>

  <p>Connor spun around. Lounging carelessly in the far doorway, a half-smoked
  cigarette in her hand, was the exquisite form of Margaret of Urbs.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she drawled slowly and advanced leisurely into the room,
  seating herself casually on the desk regardless of its litter of papers.</p>

  <p>"Joaquin," she remarked, "this man neglects to kneel in my presence. In
  yours as well, I perceive. Shall I command him?"</p>

  <p>"Try commanding the statue of Olin," snapped Connor.</p>

  <p>"We could persuade him," insinuated the Princess. "After all, Evanie Sair
  is our hostage."</p>

  <p>"Be still!" the Master said sharply. "You know I never impose a custom on
  those who reject it."</p>

  <p>The Princess turned taunting eyes on Tom Connor and was silent. "With your
  permission I should like to retire," he said. "We seem to have covered the
  ground."</p>

  <p>"Not entirely," said the Master.</p>

  <p>"What more do you want of me?"</p>

  <p>"Two things. First, your knowledge. Your understanding of the ancient
  mathematics, and whatever else we need."</p>

  <p>"Granted&mdash;on condition." At the Master's inquiring look he said
  boldly: "On condition that any knowledge I impart be made public. You have
  enough secrets&mdash;though some of them are apt not to remain so!"</p>

  <p>"I'll agree," the Master said promptly. "That was always my intention. But
  what secret of mine is in danger of exposure?"</p>

  <p>Connor laughed. "What else was it you wanted of me?"</p>

  <p>"Your blood. Your strain in the race, like an infusion of bulldog blood to
  give greyhounds courage. I want you to marry and have children."</p>

  <p>"And that," said Connor bluntly, "is my personal business. I refuse to
  promise that."</p>

  <p>"Well," the Master genially remarked, "we'll let Nature take its course.
  I'll trade you that indulgence for the revelation of what secret you
  suspect."</p>

  <p>"Done! It's the Triangle rocket-blasts."</p>

  <p>"The rocket-blasts!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I've heard your craft in flight. I've listened to the blasts." He
  turned sardonic eyes from the Master to the Princess. "The blast isn't
  steady. It throbs. Do you understand? It throbs!"</p>

  <p>The Master's face was stern. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"I know you can't control the rate of power. You've had the whole world
  looking for a means of controlling the rate. That's impossible. Hydrogen has
  its natural period like radium. You can release the energy at that single
  rate or all at once, as in our rifles&mdash;but you can't control it
  otherwise!"</p>

  <p>There was silence.</p>

  <p>"I know what you do in the blast. You detonate your water&mdash;a little
  at a time in an enormously strong firing chamber, and release the blast
  gradually. It's no more continuous than the power of a gasoline engine!"</p>

  <p>"You're endangering your life!" whispered the Master. "You can't live
  now!"</p>

  <p>"With her Satanic Majesty, the Goddess of Mockery, to intercede for me?"
  Connor jeered, staring steadily into the gray-green eyes of the Princess. In
  her features now was no slightest trace of a taunt, but something more like
  admiration. "If I'm to die, it had better be here and now, else I'll find a
  way to tell what I know!"</p>

  <p>"Here and now!" said Margaret of Urbs.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said the Master. "Thomas Connor, long ago in my youth I knew
  men like you. They're dead, and it's a great loss to the world. But you're
  living. I don't want to kill you. I'd rather trust the fate of my empire to
  your word. Having heard my side, then, will you swear allegiance to me?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm not sure of your sincerity."</p>

  <p>"If you were, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Gladly. I see more with you than with the Weeds."</p>

  <p>"Then will you swear not to oppose me until such time as you are sure? And
  will you swear to keep that knowledge you have to yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Fair enough!" Connor said, and grinned. He took the bronzed hand the
  Master extended. "I swear it." He glanced coolly at the Princess. "And by the
  three kinds of metamorphs, I'm glad to swear it!"</p>

  <p>"Two kinds," corrected the Master mildly. "Panate and amphimorph."</p>

  <p>But Margaret of Urbs caught his meaning. A faint trace of anger glinted in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"The Immortals," she said coldly, "do not consider themselves
  metamorphs."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't consider myself Irish," said Thomas Connor. "Any freak that
  comes out of Martin Sail's ray is a metamorph to me."</p>

  <p>"Enough," said the Master. "That's all, Connor."</p>

  <p>But at the door the Princess halted Connor, and he gazed down into her
  upturned face.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe," she said coldly, "that Joaquin's promise will protect
  you&mdash;or Evanie Sair&mdash;from me? I have my own debt to collect from
  you."</p>

  <p>He glanced back at the impassive figure at the desk. "I traded my
  knowledge for your word," he called to the Master. "Is it good?"</p>

  <p>"I am the Master," said that individual calmly.</p>

  <p>Connor gazed again at the perfect features of the Flame. Slowly he raised
  his hand, holding her eyes with his. And then, with a sharp gesture, he
  snapped his finger stingingly against her dainty nose, grinned and strode
  away.</p>

  <p>At the outer door he turned. The Black Flame, her lovely face a pale mask
  of fury, held a beam-pistol in her hand, but she made no move as he grinned
  back at her. Behind her the Master smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>But back in his room, an amazing realization came to Connor. Under the
  guise of his mildness, the Master had won every single point! He had
  extracted from Connor the promise of his knowledge, the promise of secrecy
  concerning the Triangle blasts, his alienation from the Weed cause, and more
  than half an oath of allegiance to himself!</p>

  <p>And all for&mdash;what? The right of Thomas Connor to bear his own
  children, and the same promise of safety given at their earlier meeting!</p>

  <p>He swore softly and lay thinking of the mocking loveliness of the Black
  Flame.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">18. THE SKY-RAT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Connor awoke fully rested, with the ache from muscles
  strained by Evanie's weight almost vanished. He arose, bathed, donned his
  glittering Urban costume, and looked into Evanie's room.</p>

  <p>The girl was awake at last, and apparently well on toward recovery. He
  breathed a deep sigh of relief. At least in one matter, then, the
  unpredictable Princess had been sincere.</p>

  <p>"Evanie!" he murmured. "Are you really all right? Are you better?"</p>

  <p>She smiled and nodded. "I feel almost myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, we misjudged the Princess in one respect, then. I'll have to thank
  her for pulling you through." Evanie's eyes widened in horror.</p>

  <p>"Thank her! What do you mean? Tom&mdash;have you&mdash;did you see her
  while I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Why, I had dinner with her."</p>

  <p>"After I warned you!" she wailed. "I tell you she's like a madness that
  gets into your blood. A man can't even look at her without
  suffering&mdash;and she's cruel and utterly inhuman." She compressed her lips
  firmly and whispered:</p>

  <p>"There's a scanner here&mdash;right under the light. I mustn't talk like
  this."</p>

  <p>"Who cares? She won't get into my blood, Evanie. I've met only two
  Immortals. The Master I like. The Princess &mdash;I hate!"</p>

  <p>"See!" she whispered. "You like the Master! Tom, he's as bad as the
  Princess. He's subtle, scheming, insidious! His charm is poisonous. Don't let
  him talk you over&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>He was startled at her vehemence. But the Master had his word now. Could
  he break it? He was more than half convinced of the great ruler's sincerity.
  After all, Evanie was only a sweet, impulsive country girl whose grandfather
  had been killed. Something of his thoughts must have shown in his expression,
  for her face grew suddenly hard.</p>

  <p>"If I believed you were turning away from us to them," she said tensely,
  "I'd despise you, Tom. But I believe in you! Believe you're strong enough to
  resist the trickery of the Immortals. Don't fail me."</p>

  <p>He could not answer her then, for the maid, Sora, came in with a tray of
  food. She placed it on a cleverly constructed swinging arm that held it above
  the bed. It was a silent meal. Sora's presence put a restraint on them, and
  Evanie was cold, eyeing Connor suspiciously.</p>

  <p>He was relieved when they finished and the woman departed with the tray.
  He found a box of the magically self-lighting cigarettes, and puffed moodily,
  while Evanie watched him in silence.</p>

  <p>A rap sounded. A Palace guard entered, bowed, and handed Connor a tiny
  package and an envelope sealed with the imprint of the Midgard Serpent, and
  departed.</p>

  <p>Connor broke the seal and slipped a card from within, read it, and
  whistled. There was a queer expression on his face when he handed it to
  Evanie. Written on it in script as fine and precise as engraving were the two
  sentences:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>We desire your presence at once in our laboratory in the East Chambers.
    Show our medallion to the guard at your door.</i>

    <p align="center"><i>Margarita, Urbis Regina, Soroque Domini.</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The royal "we." It was no invitation, but a command. Connor stared at
  Evanie, who stared back with narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"What can I do? Ignore it and expose both of us to her anger&mdash;if
  she's such a devil as you say?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, go!" snapped Evanie. "You and your ancient strength and courage!
  You're like any other man before the Black Flame of Urbs&mdash;just a fool!
  Go!"</p>

  <p>"And leave you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll have Sora for company," she retorted. "Go ahead. Burn yourself at
  the Flame, and see if I care."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what else I can do than go," he muttered unhappily.</p>

  <p>He turned moodily to the door, stripping the wrapper from the tiny
  package. A beautifully cast golden disc lay in his hand, with the pure
  features of the Princess in high relief.</p>

  <p>The guard outside challenged him at once. It gave him a grim pleasure to
  flash the medallion in the fellow's face, to see him salute amazedly and step
  aside. Connor took the elevator to the ground floor, and passed moodily into
  the vast cavity of the Throne Room.</p>

  <p>He passed through Martin Sair's disorderly chamber and finally to his
  destination. Margaret of Urbs sat with a glass of purple wine in one hand and
  the inevitable cigarette in the other, her dainty sandaled feet on a soft
  foot-stool. She wore Urban dress of glistening silver, above which her black
  hair gleamed like metal. She gave him a sardonic smile.</p>

  <p>"You may kiss my sandal," she said.</p>

  <p>"Or the hem of your skirt," he retorted. "Why did you send me that
  note?"</p>

  <p>She gestured at the vision screen beside her.</p>

  <p>"Mostly to watch you and Evanie quarrel over it."</p>

  <p>"Then you know my opinion of you."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was rather amused."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you've ceased to be amused, may I go back?"</p>

  <p>"Not immediately," said the Princess. "Don't you think I owe you a little
  amusement in return?"</p>

  <p>"I'll forgive the obligation."</p>

  <p>"But I'm very circumspect about my debts," she insisted, with that
  maddening twinkle of mockery in the eyes that dared him. "Isn't there
  anything about the Palace&mdash;or in the world&mdash;that interests you?
  I'll take you sightseeing."</p>

  <p>It was an opportunity, at that. There certainly was much he would like to
  see in this world that had grown up a thousand years after he was born. He
  hesitated. The inky-haired girl gestured at a chair and he sat down. Without
  permission he poured himself a goblet of the wine beside her. It was quite
  different from the still wines of Ormon; sweet, sparkling, rich&mdash;and
  potent.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see Eartheye," he said, musingly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Asia's too far!" she quickly protested. "I'm only giving you an hour
  or so."</p>

  <p>"Let's have something on the vision screen from Earth-eye, then," he
  suggested. "How about Mars?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's night over Asia." She snapped the screen on with a negligent
  hand and said, "Eartheye." In a moment a bearded face appeared with a
  respectful salute. "Put on Mars," she drawled. "The central region of Solis
  Lacus."</p>

  <p>In a moment a rosy glow suffused the screen, resolving into focus as a
  ruddy plain with a greenish center. Connor gazed spellbound. The planet of
  mystery at a distance of two miles!</p>

  <p>Enigmatical dark spots of strangely suggestive regularity were
  distinguishable, a lacy tracery of cabalistic lines, the flash of something
  bright that might be water. A pygmy civilization? He wondered dizzily.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see that at first hand!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"So would I," said Margaret of Urbs. "I've tried to talk my esteemed
  brother into permission to make the attempt, without success so far."</p>

  <p>"You?" He remembered his conversation with Evanie and Jan Orm. "But it's
  two and a half years there and back!"</p>

  <p>"What's two and a half years to me?" She snapped off the screen. "Come
  on," she said rising.</p>

  <p>"Where now?"</p>

  <p>"For a little flight. I'll show you a Triangle"&mdash;she glanced at him
  with a mocking smile&mdash;"since you know their secret&mdash;and yet
  live!"</p>

  <p>"No thanks to you!" Connor flashed at her.</p>

  <p>"No. Were you frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Did I seem so?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Are you ever afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Often. I try not to show it."</p>

  <p>"I never am," she said, pulling a beam-pistol from a table drawer and
  snapping it to her waist. "Since we're leaving the Palace," she explained. "I
  intend to bring you back."</p>

  <p>He laughed and followed her through the Throne Room and up to a portion of
  the vast Palace roof below the South Tower. A Triangle stood there on a metal
  flooring. He noticed the pitting and excoriations where the blast had struck.
  The vehicle gleamed silver, far smaller than the giant ones he had seen in
  flight. Connor glanced curiously at the firing chamber at the apex, then at
  the name "<i>Sky-Rat</i>" engraved on the wall.</p>

  <p>"My <i>Sky-Rat</i>," said Margaret of Urbs. "The swiftest thing yet made
  by man. Your bullets are laggards beside it." She hesitated, and for a moment
  he could have sworn that there was a touch of shyness in her eyes. "I took
  one trip in this&mdash;not so long ago," she said softly, "that I will never
  forget. The woods of Ormon are&mdash;lovely&mdash;don't you think?"</p>

  <p>He made no answer to that, and followed her in. The tubular chamber was
  luxuriously fitted, with deep cushioned seats and room enough for comfortable
  sleeping quarters. When they were seated she depressed a lever and the
  throbbing roar of the blast began.</p>

  <p>Through the floor-port he watched the Palace drop away. Urbs Major
  unrolled beneath. There was a sensation of weight as the vehicle shot upward
  like an errant meteor.</p>

  <p>"Frightened?" laughed the Princess.</p>

  <p>Connor shrugged. "I've flown before," he said laconically.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;airplanes! Wait!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">19. DEATH FLIGHT?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Minute by minute the Earth receded. It seemed not so much to
  drop as to diminish, as if the surface were condensing like a deflating
  balloon. Urbs Minor slipped smoothly into the square of vision and the whole
  panorama of the mighty city was below&mdash;Greater and Lesser Urbs with the
  gash of the canal between them, tiny as a toy village in the Swiss Alps.</p>

  <p>Kaatskill slid into the square, and a dozen other previously unseen
  suburbs of the vast metropolis. The aspiring towers of the Palace were small
  as pins in a carpet, and already a little east of them, as their radial
  flight permitted the Earth's rotation to gain on the craft.</p>

  <p>The Earth began to seem hazy, and off to the north a snow-white plain of
  clouds glistened. The vast bowl of the planet began slowly to hump in the
  center. It was inverting, beginning to seem spherical.</p>

  <p>Tom Connor jumped violently as a spark crackled off his thumb. A second
  stung the tip of his nose. The black silken hair of the Princess rose queerly
  in a cloud about the perfection of her face, and sparks raced along the metal
  of the hull.</p>

  <p>"The Heaviside ionization layer," she murmured. "Scared?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Margaret of Urbs glanced at a dial.</p>

  <p>"Thirty thousand now."</p>

  <p>"Feet?"</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Meters."</p>

  <p>About twenty miles. And they were still accelerating. The surface below
  flowed continually inward. The sky darkened; a star appeared&mdash;another.
  Fifty stars; a thousand&mdash;all glistening in a black sky where the sun
  blazed blue-white. The Earth was decidedly globular now. The vast,
  inconceivable slope of the planet could be seen in all directions.</p>

  <p>Unconsciously Connor jumped as suddenly there came a sharp patter like
  hail.</p>

  <p>"Meteoric particles," said the girl, turning a knob. "Paige deflector,"
  she explained.</p>

  <p>"For meteors as well as bullets, eh?" he suggested. "For the iron ones. A
  stone might get through." Uncomfortable thought. Minutes passed&mdash;half an
  hour.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Princess moved something. Connor was nearly lifted from his
  seat by the sudden lightness. "Deceleration," she said, glancing down at the
  colossal</p>

  <p>convexity below. "Three hundred miles. Are you frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?"</p>

  <p>She smiled a taunt. "I'll turn off the deflectors," she murmured.</p>

  <p>There was a pattering roar. Something crashed glancingly above him and the
  floor tipped and spun like a juggler's platter. Margaret of Urbs laughed.</p>

  <p>"Might 1 ask the object?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said gently. "I'm going to commit suicide!"</p>

  <p>As he caught his breath sharply, unbelievingly, she moved the lever before
  her, and the throbbing roar of the blast died suddenly. The sensation of
  dizziness that followed was a thousand times worse than that Connor had
  experienced in the swift Palace elevators.</p>

  <p>He was utterly weightless. They were in a free fall!</p>

  <p>The Princess was laughing at him. Deep in those lustrous, inhumanly lovely
  sea-green eyes of hers was the glint of mockery.</p>

  <p>"Scared?" she whispered, as she had done repeatedly, and gave a low
  rippling chuckle at his silence. "Three hundred miles!" she jeered. A
  timeless interval. "Two hundred!"</p>

  <p>He couldn't shift his gaze from the Satanic beauty of her face, but he
  grimly fought his quivering lips to firmness. There was a low whine outside
  that rose abruptly to a screaming shriek that went gibbering across the
  world. The air! They had struck the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>The floor grew warm, almost hot&mdash;it burned. At last Connor tore his
  eyes from the face of the Princess and gazed down at the up-rushing
  planet.</p>

  <p>They were over ocean. What matter? At that speed it might as well be
  concrete. How high? Two miles&mdash;a mile? Less each succeeding second. The
  scream was a great roaring now.</p>

  <p>"We're going to crash," he said evenly, knowing she couldn't hear him.</p>

  <p>Margaret of Urbs kicked a lever with a daintily casual foot. The blast
  roared out&mdash;too late! Or was it? Irresistible weight oppressed Connor as
  the sea rushed upward. So close it was now that he saw the very waters
  hollowed by the blast. That near!</p>

  <p>But far enough. They were receding until the girl cut the blast again and
  set the rocket gently on the heaving swells of the Pacific.</p>

  <p>Connor gulped.</p>

  <p>"Nice flying," he said steadily. "How often can you do it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she laughed. "I've never tried before. Scared?" The
  reiteration of that word was getting on his nerves as greatly as had the
  speed of the rocket.</p>

  <p>"Did I show it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not." Her voice changed suddenly. She rose, whipped the beam-
  pistol from her side. "If I can't frighten you," she said, her eyes
  glittering, "I can at least kill you!" The beam flashed over him.</p>

  <p>He took the shock without flinching. She slid her finger along the barrel
  until it stabbed harder, racking him. He bit his lips and gazed back into
  eyes, now deeply emerald. At last she laughed and returned the weapon to its
  place.</p>

  <p>"Were all ancients like you, Tom?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Somehow he managed a calm reply.</p>

  <p>"Some stronger, some weaker," he said carelessly.</p>

  <p>"I think I could&mdash;love you," she whispered.</p>

  <p>She thrust a hand suddenly toward him and involuntarily he started.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of one thing, at least, aren't you?" she jeered. "Afraid
  of&mdash;me!"</p>

  <p>Without warning he caught her arm, swept her suddenly to him. He pressed a
  fierce kiss on the perfection of her lips. She yielded instantly, returning
  the caress. For a moment her lips burned against his like strong wine, and
  lights coruscated in his spinning brain. With the Black Flame of Urbs in his
  arms, the world seemed to fall away as it had from the rising Triangle.</p>

  <p>He felt her lips move against his, heard her murmur: "Tom! Tom! I do love
  you. Say you love me!"</p>

  <p>"Love you? Love you?" he said. But just in time he caught that familiar
  gleam of mockery in her eyes. "Yes," he said. "Just as I love a drink of
  strong liquor!"</p>

  <p>He pushed her roughly away, grinning sardonically. Margaret of Urbs
  laughed, but he fancied there was a quaver in her laughter. It was the first
  time he had seen the diamond hardness of her poise so much as ruffled. That
  is, since he had seen her in her role of cruel Princess, the role she had
  played for seven hundred years. When he had seen her as a child of the woods
  she had been different.</p>

  <p>But she quickly regained her hard control over herself. She slapped a
  trifle viciously at the controls, and the <i>Sky-Rat</i> soared away from a
  boiling circle of ocean toward Urbs.</p>

  <p>Arrived there, the Princess said not a word, but left Tom Connor at once.
  He wandered irresolutely to his room and opened Evanie's door. She sat
  propped against some cushions while a man in the garb of a Palace servant
  leaned above her. Both turned startled faces toward him. In amazement he
  recognized the man as Jan Orm of Ormon!</p>

  <p>Tom Connor opened his mouth to cry an involuntary greeting to Jan Orm, but
  checked it at the sight of Jan's warning look and a gesture from Evanie. Of
  course! Jan was here in disguise, and there was the scanner with unwinking
  eye and attentive ear. Connor advanced to the side of Evanie's bed and bent
  over her.</p>

  <p>"Don't look at Jan when you talk," she said softly.</p>

  <p>"I won't. Lord, I'm glad to see you, Jan! I didn't know what might have
  happened to you."</p>

  <p>"I'm working in the kitchen," whispered Jan, nodding at a tray on the
  wall-arm. He added eagerly: "Tom, you can help us! We need you."</p>

  <p>"Help you to do what?"</p>

  <p>"To finish " Jan began, but Evanie interrupted. "Help me to escape," she
  whispered, then shot a glance at Jan Orm. "Be careful of him, Jan," she
  warned. "He's been around the Black Flame."</p>

  <p>Connor reddened. "Look here!" he muttered. "Here's exactly how I stand.
  For safety sake, I've sworn to the Master to make no move against him for the
  present, and to tell him what I know of mathematics. That can't hurt you, can
  it? Evanie's safety is worth more to me than that."</p>

  <p>"What's the value of an oath to the Master?" he growled. "That needn't
  bind you!"</p>

  <p>"I keep my word," Connor said, as grimly.</p>

  <p>"But your oath doesn't keep you from helping me to escape, does it?"
  whispered Evanie.</p>

  <p>"I guess not&mdash;but what's the use of it? To suffer another
  Messenger?"</p>

  <p>"This time," declared Evanie, "I'll fight off any Messenger. I was worn
  out before, exhausted, almost helpless."</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" asked Connor, a little reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Are you free to move as you will about the Palace?"</p>

  <p>"Not entirely."</p>

  <p>"Well, I want to see the Master. I must see him."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you call him and ask for an interview?" Connor asked. That
  seemed simple enough.</p>

  <p>"I have. All I can get is a statement from the vision room that he's busy
  in his quarters and can't come. I'm not supposed to leave my bed, you know."
  She paused. "It's probably true. Jan has heard that there's a Conclave of the
  Immortals of the South day after tomorrow." She glanced at Connor
  imploringly. "Can't you get me to him, Tom? Please&mdash;I must see him."</p>

  <p>Connor smiled, amused, as a swift thought crossed his mind. Margaret of
  Urbs must indeed have been perturbed this morning. She had forgotten to
  reclaim her medallion. If he were to use it before she remembered</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can help you reach him, Evanie," he whispered. "If you'll come
  at once."</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">20. THE CONSPIRATORS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The guards passed them without question, with only a glance
  at the medallion.</p>

  <p>When they reached the anteroom beyond the arch they at once saw the Master
  at his littered desk. Evanie dropped gracefully to one knee as they neared
  the ruler. But Connor stood erect and stared at Margaret of Urbs, who sat in
  a chair by the window, a book on her lap, a black cigarette in her fingers
  spiraling smoke as she stared back at him.</p>

  <p>The Master's eyes flickered over them.</p>

  <p>"May I ask how you two managed to arrive here?" he inquired mildly.</p>

  <p>Connor tossed the medallion on the desk, and his lips twisted in wry
  amusement when he saw the quivering start that twitched the dainty lips of
  the Princess. She arose quickly and moved to the Master's side. She and
  Evanie gazed at each other across the desk. The eyes of Margaret of Urbs were
  faintly disdainful, but Evanie's were hostile.</p>

  <p>It was Tom Connor's first opportunity to make a first-hand comparison of
  the two. He hated himself for making it, but here it was thrust upon him.</p>

  <p>The Princess was a trifle taller, a bit more slender than Evanie, and
  infinitely more beautiful, lovely as Evanie was. It wasn't fair, Connor told
  himself bitterly&mdash;terribly unfair, in fact, to compare Evanie's beauty
  with the unearthly beauty of the Black Flame of Urbs. It was like contrasting
  the simple loveliness of a wild rose to the splendor ofan orchid, or a blown
  milkweed butterfly to a starflying Luna moth.</p>

  <p>The Master spoke.</p>

  <p>"I presume you have a reason for coming."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Evanie. "I can't stand it&mdash;being imprisoned in a single
  room. I had to see you." Her lips quivered. She was a consummate actress,
  Connor suddenly realized. "You know I&mdash;I have&mdash;metamorphic blood in
  me. You know what that means. I have to move about in the open to breathe air
  that comes from the sky, not from Palace ventilators. So I've come to ask you
  for a little freedom. Just permission to walk now and then in the Inner
  Gardens."</p>

  <p>Connor wondered how walking in the square of the Inner Gardens could
  encompass her escape, since the Palace surrounded it.</p>

  <p>"It is my intention to release you, but not yet," the Master said. "Not
  until I have had what I wish from Thomas Connor."</p>

  <p>"But I can't stand it!" the girl pleaded tremulously. The Master turned to
  Connor.</p>

  <p>"Remembering your oath," he said, "do you second this request? This is no
  move against me?"</p>

  <p>"I do not break my word," Connor said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I see no harm in it." The Master called a few syllables into the
  box beside him, then spoke to Evanie. "You have the liberty of the halls and
  the Inner Gardens &mdash;no more. As for you"&mdash;his eyes flickered over
  Connor &mdash;"apparently you manage without my permission. That's all."</p>

  <p>Evanie dropped again to her knee, rose and moved toward the archway. As
  Connor followed, the Master called: "Not you, Thomas Connor."</p>

  <p>Connor turned again toward the faintly amused face of the ruler.</p>

  <p>"I perceive," the Master said, "that my sister has disobeyed me."</p>

  <p>The Princess laughed in that mocking way of hers. "Do I ever obey you,
  Joaquin?"</p>

  <p>"Nominally, at times." He paused, studying his sister coolly for a moment,
  then again turned his attention to the man before him. "As you may know," he
  remarked, "I have summoned a Conclave for day after tomorrow. I am completely
  occupied. But I do not forget your promise, Thomas Connor, nor have I lost
  interest in the stores of ancient knowledge. Therefore, you will accompany
  the Princess to the chambers behind the Throne Room and fulfill your promise
  by explaining to her as much as time permits of mathematics, particularly of
  the meaning of logarithms and of the device I have heard termed the
  slide-rule. She will understand you. That's all."</p>

  <p>He met the eyes of the Princess. "I may obey you this time, Joaquin," she
  said, and moved out of the door.</p>

  <p>Connor followed her. The halls betrayed the activity of the coming
  Conclave, and were more crowded than he had observed before. Twice
  grave-faced, long-haired Immortals passed them, raising respectful hands in
  salute to Margaret of Urbs.</p>

  <p>She turned into the South Corridor.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the way," he objected.</p>

  <p>"We're going to the Tower." She glanced sideward at him. "You'll see soon
  why the Palace needs all of its size. There'll be twenty thousand Immortals
  here, and we have room for all of them&mdash;half the Immortals in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"Half! Evanie said there were three million."</p>

  <p>She gave him an inscrutable smile.</p>

  <p>"It does no harm to let the Weeds over-estimate our strength."</p>

  <p>"Then why tell me?"</p>

  <p>Her smile was the unfathomable one of the Mona Lisa. "I never do anything
  without reason," was her only reply.</p>

  <p>He laughed. When once again they reached the aspiring pinnacle of the
  Tower, without a glance at the mighty city below, the Princess pulled pen and
  paper from a table, seated herself, and faced Connor.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she queried. "Begin."</p>

  <p>He did. It was a new Margaret of Urbs he saw now, unknown before save
  possibly in that brief moment when he had mentioned the Venus of Milo, or
  when earlier in the woods she had shown him how vast was her knowledge of and
  interest in history and world events.</p>

  <p>She was eager, curious, questioning, avid for knowledge and uncannily
  quick to comprehend. There were queer gaps in her learning. Often he had to
  stop to explain terms utterly elementary, while at other times she followed
  him through the most complex maze of reasoning without a question.</p>

  <p>The afternoon waned, dusk crept over the great vista, and at length she
  threw down her pen.</p>

  <p>"Enough," she said. "We must have ten-place logarithm tables worked out.
  They'll be priceless at Earth-eye." Not until then did a trace of mockery
  creep into her voice. "I suppose you realize," she taunted, "that once we
  have your knowledge all reasons to keep you alive are gone, but the reasons
  to kill you remain."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"You'd like to frighten me, wouldn't you? Haven't you tried that often
  enough? The Master trusts my word. I trust his&mdash;but not yours." His lips
  twisted. "Had I not trusted him, I could have escaped this morning. What was
  to prevent me from taking your weapon away, dropping you on a deserted
  shore&mdash;or even kidnapping you&mdash;and escaping in the <i>Sky-Rat?</i>
  I never promised not to escape. What kept me here was my trust in his word,
  and a desire to see this game played out!"</p>

  <p>"There is no safety anywhere in the world for you, Thomas Connor," said
  the Flame softly, "except in my favor. And why you still live is a mystery,
  so much so that I wonder at it. I have never before been so indulgent to one
  I hate." She flashed her glorious emerald eyes to his face. "<i>Do</i> I hate
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You should know hatred better than I."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and yet I wonder." She smiled slowly. "If ever I love the way I
  hate, not death itself could thwart me. But there is no man strong enough to
  conquer me."</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps," he retorted, "that one isn't interested." She smiled again
  with almost a trace of wistfulness. "You're very strong," she admitted. "I
  should have loved to have lived in your ancient days. To have lived among
  your great fighters and great makers of beauty.</p>

  <p>At least those were men&mdash;your ancients. I could have loved one of
  those."</p>

  <p>"And haven't you," he asked ironically, "ever loved a man?"</p>

  <p>He could detect no mocking note in her voice. "Loved? I have thought
  myself in love a hundred times. At least a dozen times I have gone to Joaquin
  to beg immortality for some man I have loved. But Joaquin swore to Martin
  Sair long ago to grant it only to those worthy of it, and he has kept that
  oath."</p>

  <p>She smiled wryly. "It takes all a man's youth to prove himself worthy, and
  so the Immortals are all dry scientists&mdash;not to my taste! Joaquin
  refused me each time I asked for the favor, wanting to know if I were sure
  I'd never tire of him for whom I begged&mdash;to swear I was sure. And of
  course I couldn't swear." She paused thought-fully. "He was always right,
  too; every time. I did tire even before old age blighted them."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do to prove yourself worthy?" Connor mocked.</p>

  <p>"I'm serious today," the Princess said. "I'm not teasing now. I think I
  could love you, Thomas Connor."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." He grinned, suspecting the glitter in the green eyes though
  he did not see it. "In my time it was the custom for the man to make such
  declarations."</p>

  <p>"Your time!" flared Margaret of Urbs. "What do I care for your primitive
  customs and prehistoric prejudices? Would you have the Black Flame as
  shrinking and modest as little Evanie pretends to be?"</p>

  <p>"I'd dislike you less if you were."</p>

  <p>"You don't dislike me. You're merely afraid of me because I represent
  everything you hate in a woman&mdash;and yet you can't hate me. Indeed, I
  rather think you love me."</p>

  <p>He laughed, mocking now, himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm Margaret of Urbs!" she flashed. "What do I want of you? Nothing! I
  don't really want you at all, Tom Connor. You'd be like all the others; you'd
  age. Those mighty limbs of yours will turn skinny, or else fat and bloated.
  Those clear eyes will be pale and watery. Your teeth will yellow and your
  hair fall out, and then you'll be gone!"</p>

  <p>She pulled a cigarette from the box and blew a plume of smoke in his
  impassive face.</p>

  <p>"Go brag of this when we release you&mdash;if we do! Go tell it up and
  down the world that you alone of all men were strong enough to reject the
  love of Margaret of Urbs. Go say that the Black Flame failed to scorch you
  &mdash;failed even to warm you." Her voice quivered. "Andgo say too that no
  other man save you ever learned&mdash;how unhappy&mdash;she is!"</p>

  <p>The deep eyes were tear-bright. He stared into them perplexed. Was this
  merely more acting? Was there nothing left of Margaret of Urbs save a lovely
  mask and a thousand poses&mdash;no real being within? He forced a sardonic
  grin to his lips, forced it, for the impossible beauty of the girl tore at
  him despite his will.</p>

  <p>At his smile her face darkened.</p>

  <p>"And then say," she said, from between tight lips, "that the Black Flame
  doesn't care what talk you make of her, because she burns on while
  you&mdash;and those you talk to&mdash;in so very few years will be dust!
  Dust!"</p>

  <p>Again he laughed at her and the Flame turned suddenly away.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you may go now," she said dully.</p>

  <p>But Connor hardly heard her. He was caught in speculations concerning the
  strange black and golden soul of the Princess, baffling, hateful, fascinating
  to the point of deadliness, and yet&mdash;somehow wistful, almost pitiful. It
  was almost, he thought, as if in the glimpse he had caught of her in the
  freedom of the woods he had seen the true soul of the woman, and all the rest
  was masquerading.</p>

  <p>He stared across at the glory of her face, now subdued to sadness as she
  gazed out at a million lighted windows. Then a flicker of motion caught his
  eye, far, far beneath him in the well of shadows in the Inner Gardens.</p>

  <p>"Someone's in the Gardens," he observed absently.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the Princess listlessly, "it must be an Antarctic Immortal,
  enjoying a garden under the sky." She clicked the vision screen. "Garden,"
  she ordered dully. "North bank of the pool."</p>

  <p>A burst of choked laughter startled him. He swung about. There, shown on
  the screen before his eyes, was Evanie, seated on a garden bench, her head on
  the shoulder of Jan Orm, his arm about her waist!</p>

  <p>"A waiter!" the Black Flame said scornfully. "A Palace waiter!"</p>

  <p>But despite her laughter and his own confusion, Connor did not fail to
  notice that there were still tears in her eyes.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">21. THE DINNER AT THE SLEEPER'S</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Connor awoke late next morning, and to an instant memory of
  the shock he had experienced at the sight of Evanie and Jan Orm. Most of the
  night he had spent in improvising possible excuses for the girl. Perhaps it
  was an innocent scene he had witnessed.</p>

  <p>After all, she and Jan were lifelong friends, born and raised in Ormon and
  it might be that Evanie had turned to him in loneliness, even in pique at
  his, Tom Connor's own involuntary attendance on Margaret of Urbs. But the
  mocking suggestions of the Princess, and the memory of Evanie's contented
  face in the vision screen&mdash;those troubled him. And he remembered, too,
  Jan's confession that he loved Evanie.</p>

  <p>Dressing, he glimpsed her far below in the Inner Gardens, with her bronze
  hair glinting. She was lying at full length on the grass. He forgot breakfast
  and hurried into the corridor, where the guard, remembering the medallion of
  the Princess, merely saluted respectfully, unaware that Connor no longer
  possessed the disc of gold.</p>

  <p>He descended at once to the ground level, followed an interminable passage
  toward the Palace's center, and flung open a door at its end. Instead of
  daylight, a dim-lit chamber with glowing walls lay beyond, wherein, after a
  moment of blinking, he descried a row of perhaps twenty men. Some stared at
  him, surprised, but most kept their eyes fixed steadily on the shining
  wall.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said to the nearest man. "I was looking for the
  Gardens."</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, a voice spoke beside him.</p>

  <p>"The Gardens are two stories above us, Thomas. And I see you still
  wander."</p>

  <p>It was the tall, ebony-haired Master. Beside him was another Immortal,
  grave-eyed and sandy-haired.</p>

  <p>"This is Thomas Connor," said the Master, "our store-house of ancient
  knowledge. Thomas, this is Martin Sair, here from Austropolis." He added,
  "Thomas is one of those who affect not to kneel in our presence. I indulge
  him."</p>

  <p>"Indulgence is a habit of yours, Urbanus," rumbled the sandy-haired man.
  "Does the Princess also&mdash;indulge?"</p>

  <p>"Not willingly. Margaret is having one of her restless years, I'm afraid."
  He frowned. "But they pass&mdash;they pass. Look there, Thomas." He gestured
  toward the wall. "This is our seeing room. Here is focused every scanner in
  Urbs&mdash;in any of my cities, if I wish. If the Palace is the world's
  brain, this room is the visual center."</p>

  <p>Connor took his eyes from a fascinated scrutiny of the legendary Martin
  Sair, the Giver of Life, and glanced at the walls. Millions of tiny pictures
  covered them, each small as a thumbnail, glowing some in colors, and some,
  when the distant origin was in darkness, in the dull blue-gray of the short
  waves. He saw flickers of movement as the pictured men and women went about
  their daily business.</p>

  <p>"We can enlarge any scene there," said the Master, pointing at a row of
  wider screens, some even now illumined. "In this room I can follow a man's
  life from birth to death, so long as he remains in one of my cities." He
  paused musingly, then shrugged. "The Gardens are two floors above us,
  Thomas."</p>

  <p>It was dismissal. Connor cast a last glance at Martin Sair, feeling as if
  he were gazing on a demigod. Martin Sair, the Giver of Life, greatest except
  the Master among all the heroic figures in the dazzling age of the
  Enlightenment. Then he backed away from the great Immortal and betook himself
  to the Gardens.</p>

  <p>Evanie was there, lovely as a bit of the ancient statuary that dotted the
  square, as she lay in the barbaric costume of Urbs watching a twenty-inch
  column of water slip smoothly from the mouth of a giant stone lion. She gave
  Connor a cool glance as he approached.</p>

  <p>"Evanie!" he said unhappily. "I've looked everywhere for you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"To be with you, of course. You know that."</p>

  <p>"I don't know it. Or has the Flame burned you at last?</p>

  <p>Her coolness baffled him.</p>

  <p>"Evanie," he pleaded, "why are you so offended?"</p>

  <p>Her mouth hardened. "You've deserted the Weeds, Tom. Do you think I could
  ever forgive that?"</p>

  <p>"See here, Evanie," he said hastily. "There's one thing you seem to have
  forgotten. I was thrust in among the Weeds of Ormon without choice. Does that
  mean I have to accept your social theories blindly? Perhaps I'm too primitive
  for anarchy&mdash;but I think you are too!" He went on defiantly. "I don't
  think your theories will work, and I do think the Master's government is what
  this world needs. It isn't perfect, but it's better than the Weeds
  offer&mdash;and even for you, Evanie, I won't give up freedom of
  thought."</p>

  <p>"You mean you won't think!" she blazed. "You're not fooling me, Tom! I
  know the way the Black Flame poisons men, and you've been with her too often!
  You've been burned and&mdash;" Her anger mounted. "Oh, go away!"</p>

  <p>"Evanie," he began earnestly, and paused. <i>Was</i> he untouched by the
  devastating charm of the Princess? The dizzying warmth of her lips, his
  reeling brain in the hour on the Pacific&mdash; "She's the daughter of Hell!"
  he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Go away!" flared Evanie. "Quitter!"</p>

  <p>Hot words rose to his lips. But he suppressed his anger, even as the
  picture he had seen of Jan and Evanie flashed on his mental screen, and
  turned away into the Palace.</p>

  <p>For an hour he stamped through the endless halls now crowded with arriving
  Immortals from Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and South America. Now and
  again one turned cool eyes on his forbidding countenance or smiled gravely
  after him. None stopped or addressed him.</p>

  <p>He must have completed the somewhat less than a mile of circuit several
  times when a guard approached him. He turned a furious scowl on the fellow,
  but he had only a tiny black envelope inscribed in white in the precisescript
  of the Princess. Connor ripped the missive open. A short note was inside. It
  read:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Come to my chambers at half after the seventh hour to escort me to
    dinner. Wear the black costume in your quarters, and the black cape.</i>

    <p align="center"><i>Margaret of Urbs.</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Merely an invitation&mdash;but a royal invitation is a command. He laughed
  bitterly. Why not? The Black Flame could burn no more painfully than she had
  already, and at least he could vent his anger on her.</p>

  <p>Although hours remained before the appointed dinner hour, he went back to
  his quarters, glancing indifferently at the Urban formal dress laid carefully
  on his bed. It was exactly like his present garb save that it shimmered black
  with metallic scales, and was edged with silver. Crossing to the window he
  sat staring down at Evanie in the Gardens, bathing her rounded limbs in
  sunlight, until a man in Urban dress who could only be Jan Orm joined her. He
  turned angrily away then, fuming.</p>

  <p>With no breakfast or lunch, he was both short-tempered and ravenous. So
  when the hours had dragged by, and he finally located the Chambers on the
  hundred and seventh level of the South Tower, he was in no pleasant mood. Two
  armed guards stepped aside, and the serving woman, Sora, admitted him with a
  clumsy curtsy.</p>

  <p>He passed into the anteroom, furnished, as was the Black Flame's
  laboratory behind the Throne Room and her place at the summit of the Tower,
  lavishly and ornately. But surprise leaped to his eyes as he saw the gigantic
  black Persian cat that gazed steadily at him, with green eyes that seemed
  almost a replica of those of the Princess.</p>

  <p>"A cat!" he exclaimed. "I thought they were extinct."</p>

  <p>"Satan is immortal," said the soft voice of Margaret of Urbs.</p>

  <p>He whirled and faced her as she emerged from the inner chamber, and hunger
  and anger alike drained out of him as he stared.</p>

  <p>She was magnificent! Garbed in a jet-black cape that dropped to her green-
  crystalled sandals, she seemed taller as she advanced into the room. A
  circlet of green gems&mdash;emeralds, he thought&mdash;bound her ebony hair,
  and beneath it her eyes were smoldering sea-green fire.</p>

  <p>But he felt the thrill of surprised shock as she threw open the cape. Her
  brief kirtle and corselet glittered in a solid surface of green gems, and at
  her waist sparkled that mystic crystalline flower of many colors, glistening
  from red to violet, blue, and purest emerald. Then she moved toward the lamp,
  and in its yellow radiance her whole costume was green no longer, but the
  deep lavender of wine.</p>

  <p>"Alexandrites," she laughed, answering his unspoken question. "Green by
  day, lavender by artificial light. Synthetic, of course. There aren't this
  many natural stones in the world." She turned. "Like it?"</p>

  <p>"Exquisite!" he whispered. "You daughter of Lucifer!"</p>

  <p>He followed her in rebellious fascination as they progressed unattended to
  the ground floor and into a long Palace car with stiff-backed driver and
  footman.</p>

  <p>"Merimee's," she said, and the car spun silently away, mounting to the
  upper tier of Palace Avenue.</p>

  <p>It was dusk, but now and then, when traffic slowed their motion, cheers
  sounded, and many a glance was cast at them. Margaret of Urbs ignored the
  glances, but smiled at the cheers.</p>

  <p>"Who's Merimee?" Connor asked.</p>

  <p>"A rich Sleeper in Kaatskill. Society here is largely Sleepers."</p>

  <p>"No nobility?"</p>

  <p>"The Immortals seldom entertain. We're a serious lot."</p>

  <p>Kaatskill appeared, and they glided into the grounds of an imposing
  Grecian mansion. Lights were glowing, gay voices sounded as they entered.</p>

  <p>There was a sudden silence as the whole assemblage knelt. Margaret of Urbs
  gestured and the guests arose. Merimee himself, paunchy, bald, came babbling
  his appreciation, his gratitude for the honor to his house.</p>

  <p>"But the 'entertainment, Your Highness! On such short notice, you
  see&mdash;best the bureau could furnish&mdash;I know you'll
  forgive&mdash;"</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">22. DECLARATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The dinner was lavish. Connor sat at the left of the
  Princess. Lines of servitors passed in a steady stream, bearing soups, then
  fish&mdash;Bombay ducks, pompano, a dozen unknown viands&mdash;and
  fowl&mdash;ortolan, ptarmigan, pheasant, and nameless others.</p>

  <p>Connor was ravenous. He sampled everything, and it was the middle of the
  meal before he noticed the aghast looks of the crowd, and that he was almost
  the only one who was eating.</p>

  <p>"Have I violated the proprieties?" he asked the Princess.</p>

  <p>"You're supposed to eat only of the dishes I taste," she informed
  coolly.</p>

  <p>"But I'm hungry. And you've eaten practically nothing."</p>

  <p>It was true. Margaret of Urbs had taken only a little salad, though she
  had sipped glass after glass of wine.</p>

  <p>"I like to tantalize these hogs," she replied in low but audible tones.
  "This bores me."</p>

  <p>"Then why come?"</p>

  <p>"A whim."</p>

  <p>He chuckled, turning his attention to the entertainment. This, he thought,
  was excellent. An incredibly skillful juggler succeeded a talented magician;
  a low-voiced woman sang sweet and ancient tunes; a trio played tinkling
  melodies. A graceful pair of adagio dancers performed breathtakingly in the
  square surrounded by the tables, and a contortionist managed unbelievable
  bodily tangles. The performers came and went in silence. Not one burst of
  applause rewarded them.</p>

  <p>"Unappreciative audience!" Connor growled.</p>

  <p>"Is it?" the Princess drawled. "Watch."</p>

  <p>The following number, he thought, was the worst of the lot. A frightened,
  dingy man with a half-trained dancing monkey that chattered and grimaced, but
  made a sad failure of the dancing. Yet at the conclusion Margaret of Urbs
  raised her dainty hands, and applauded.</p>

  <p>Instantly bedlam broke loose. Applause crashed through the hall; encores
  were shouted, and the astonished player stumbled once more through the
  ludicrous performance.</p>

  <p>"Well, his fortune's made," observed the Princess. "N'York will want him
  and Ch'cago, and Singapore as well."</p>

  <p>The master of ceremonies was presenting "Homero, the Poet of
  Personalities," a thin-faced Urban crowned with laurel leaves and bearing a
  classical harp.</p>

  <p>He bowed and smiled.</p>

  <p>"And who, Ladies and Lords, shall it be? Of whom do I sing?"</p>

  <p>"Her Highness!" roared the crowd. "The Princess of Urbs!"</p>

  <p>Homero strummed his harp, and began chanting minstrel-like:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>"The Princess? Adjective and verb<br>
    Turn feeble! Glorious? Superb?<br>
    Exquisite? None of these can name<br>
    The splendor of the Urban Flame.</i>

    <p><i>"Our Princess! Stars are loath to rise<br>
    Lest they be faded by her eyes,<br>
    Yet once they've risen, they will not set,<br>
    But gaze entranced on Margaret.</i></p>

    <p><i>"The continents and oceans seven<br>
    Revolve beneath the laws of Heaven;<br>
    What limit, law, or cannon curbs<br>
    The tongue that speaks the Flame of Urbs?"</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Applause, violent and enthusiastic, greeted the doggerel. Margaret of Urbs
  lowered her eyes and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Who now?" Homero called. "Of whom do I sing?"<br>
  Unexpectedly, Merimee spoke. "Tom Connor!" he cried. "Tom Connor, the
  Ancient!"</p>

  <p>Romero strummed his harp and sang:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>"Ladies and Lords, you do me honor,<br>
    Giving the name of Thomas Connor,<br>
    That Ancient, phoenixlike arisen<br>
    Out of his cold, sepulchral prison,<br>
    Thrust into life&mdash;a comet hurled<br>
    From the dead past into the world.</i>

    <p><i>"What poet great enough to sing<br>
    The wonderful awakening?<br>
    Let golden Science try explain<br>
    That miracle&mdash;and try in vain;<br>
    For only Art, by Heaven inflamed.<br>
    Can dream how Death itself was tamed!"</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>"He'll turn this into some insipid compliment to me," whispered Margaret
  of Urbs. The Poet of Personalities sang on:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>"Year after year the strong flesh mouldered,<br>
    Dim was the spark of life that smouldered&mdash;<br>
    Until the Princess glanced that way,<br>
    And lo! The cold and lifeless clay,<br>
    To Death and Time no longer slave,<br>
    Burst out triumphant from the grave!"</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the roar of applause Connor sat amazed at the reference to his own
  experience. How did Homero know? He turned to question the Princess.</p>

  <p>"I'm tired of this," she said, and rose to depart.</p>

  <p>The whole body of guests rose with her. She drew her cape around her and
  strode to the car.</p>

  <p>"Slowly," she ordered the driver, then leaned back gazing at Connor.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Interesting. That Homero&mdash;he's clever."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Stock verses composed beforehand."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;about me?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know you've been a newspaper and vision sensation?"</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Connor was shocked.</p>

  <p>"This Homero," she went on musingly. "Once, long ago, I knew Sovem, the
  only great poet of the Enlightenment, he who half seriously, half
  contemptuously, named me the Black Flame, and the only man&mdash;save you,
  Tom Connor, who ever flaunted me to my face. And one evening he angered me,
  and I exiled him from Urbs, Urbs that he loved&mdash;and too late I found
  that his bitterness grew out of a love for me.</p>

  <p>"So I called him back in time to die, when not even Martin Sair could save
  him. And dying he said to me&mdash;I recall it&mdash;`I take my revenge in
  remembering that you are human, and to be human is to love and suffer. Do not
  forget it.'" She paused. "Nor have I."</p>

  <p>"And was it true?" asked Connor, struck suddenly by this revelation of the
  fiery, imperious, untameable character beside him.</p>

  <p>"I think, lately, that it <i>is</i> true," she murmured, and drew a long
  breath. "I have slain, I have tortured, for less violence than you have
  committed against me."</p>

  <p>She flung open her cape, baring the marks of his fingers still on the
  exquisite curve of her throat.</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;suffer the touch of violence, and yet you have struck me
  twice and still live. There is a magic about you, Thomas Connor, some
  laughing ancient strength that has died out of the world. I have never begged
  anyone&mdash;but I fear you and I plead with you." She swayed against him.
  "Kiss me!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He stared down at the unearthly beauty of her face, but there was a green
  light in her eyes that puzzled him. Coolly he fought the fascination that was
  cast netlike about him. This was but another taste of the torment she had
  promised. He was sure of it.</p>

  <p>"I will not," he said. "Each time I have kissed you, you have laughed at
  me."</p>

  <p>"But I will not laugh now."</p>

  <p>"You'll not trap me again by the same trick," he said. "Find another way
  for the torment you threatened. And when you're ready to kill me for the
  violence I did you, I'll die laughing at <i>you.</i>"</p>

  <p>"I have forgiven that," she said softly."Then," he said mockingly, "here's
  more to forgive."</p>

  <p>He lifted her slender wrist in his mighty hand, circled it with his
  powerful fingers, and crushed it in a grasp like contracting steel. It gave
  him a grim pleasure to thus vent his turbulent emotions on her, and to see
  her face whiten under pain that must have been excruciating. But save for her
  pallor she gave no sign of agony.</p>

  <p>He dropped her hand, ashamed of his cruelty, though it was not as if he
  had used his strength against a mortal woman. Margaret of Urbs seemed to him
  rather a female demon.</p>

  <p>But she only said softly, "I thank you for this. It has taught me what I
  wanted to know, for any other than you would now be dead for it. I love you,
  Tom."</p>

  <p>"Flame!" he retorted, while her eyes widened the merest trifle at the
  familiarity. "I don't believe you."</p>

  <p>"But you must! After all these years upon years I am sure. I swear it,
  Tom! Say you love me."</p>

  <p>"I love&mdash;Evanie." But despite his words the doubts that had been
  constantly creeping in on him assailed him. Evanie was still alien,
  somehow.</p>

  <p>"You love <i>me!"</i> she murmured. "I am the Black Flame, yet 1 plead
  now. Say it, Tom!"</p>

  <p>"I love Evanie!"</p>

  <p>"Then will you kiss me?"</p>

  <p>He stared down at her. "Why not?" he said savagely. "Do you think I'm
  afraid of you?"</p>

  <p>He spun her against him and her lips burned against his.</p>

  <p>"Say you love me!" she repeated in a tense whisper. "Say it!"</p>

  <p>"I love&mdash;" he began, and the car slid to a stop before the Palace
  arch. The footman stood holding the car door open.</p>

  <p>Margaret of Urbs gazed as if distraught from Connor's face to the silent
  attendant and back again. Abruptly she thrust herself away, her mouth
  quivering.</p>

  <p>"I wish," she said tensely, "I&mdash;wish I had never seen you!"</p>

  <p>She struck him a sharp blow across his mouth, clambered unassisted to the
  ground, and disappeared into the Palace, trailing her black cape behind
  her.</p>

  <p>Back in his room again, Connor was in a turmoil, ashamed, perplexed,
  bitter.</p>

  <p>"Caught!" he swore fiercely. "Burned! God! What a fool&mdash;what a
  weakling!"</p>

  <p>For call it what he would&mdash;it was true. Fascination, infatuation,
  anything&mdash;the fact faced him that the Black Flame had burned Evanie from
  his heart. He swore viciously and battered at Evanie's door.</p>

  <p>The blows echoed into silence. There was no response.</p>

  <p>With a long-drawn sigh, Connor turned away from Evanie's door. Whether
  absent or simply ignoring him, she had failed him, and he needed her
  desperately now. He wanted to quench the fires of the Black Flame in her cool
  simplicity, to reassure himself that what he now felt was an obsession, an
  infatuation&mdash;anything but love.</p>

  <p>He wanted to convince himself it was Evanie he loved by telling her so.
  Better never to have emerged from under the prison than to live again, loving
  a mask of beauty hiding a daughter of Satan.</p>

  <p>He strode to the casement overlooking the Gardens. Dim light from the
  Palace windows streaked in bars across it, but he saw no sign of Evanie. But
  could that be Evanie&mdash;there where the bushes shadowed the pool?</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23">23. THE AMPHIMORPHS IN THE POOL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Tom Connor made his way hurriedly to the Gardens. He saw
  Evanie crouched in the shadow of shrubbery just above the brink of the water.
  He dashed forward as she glanced up at him.</p>

  <p>"Evanie!" he began. "Oh, my dear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Her voice was tense.</p>

  <p>"But</p>

  <p>"Be still. Speak softly. Do you think I want a scanner on me?" She paused.
  "I'd rather you'd go away," she whispered.</p>

  <p>He seated himself stubbornly beside her, though it seemed certain she was
  waiting for someone. Jan Orm, probably.</p>

  <p>"I won't go," he said in a subdued voice. "You've got to listen to me,
  Evanie."</p>

  <p>"Please!" she murmured. "Be quiet, Tom. I've been waiting here six
  hours."</p>

  <p>"For what?"</p>

  <p>She made no reply. He subsided into gloomy silence, watching the great
  column of water that gushed from the jaws of the huge stone lion at the far
  end of the pool. The water, smooth as a steel pillar, fell with surprisingly
  little sound.</p>

  <p>But while he gazed, it changed. The smoothness was broken. Bubbles
  flashed, and then the flow ceased altogether while a huge bubble glistened,
  billowed and broke. Something white and shining and large as a man shot with
  a small splash into the pool. The column of water crashed instantly back.</p>

  <p>A webbed hand holding a silkwrapped package rose suddenly from the black
  water. An amphimorph!</p>

  <p>Evanie seized the bundle, crammed it beneath an Urban cape at her
  side.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" she said tensely. "Stand here beside me, Tom, so we'll block the
  scanner."</p>

  <p>He obeyed wonderingly. A queer low coo came from Evanie's lips. The black
  waters parted again and he glimpsed the tiny round mouth and horrible face of
  the creature in the pool. It flopped to the bank, scuttled desperately along
  into the bushes. He saw it raise the lid of a manhole of a storm-sewer, and
  it was gone.</p>

  <p>Pale and trembling Evanie sank down on the bank, her bronzed legs dangling
  toward the water.</p>

  <p>"If only we weren't seen!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did that thing get here?" Connor demanded.</p>

  <p>"It rode a bubble down the water tunnel from the mountains, fifty miles.
  An amphimorph doesn't need much air. A big bubble will last."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me how it found the maze of mains in Urbs. I don't know. I only
  know they have queer instinctive ways of getting where they want to go. Now
  it's gone into the storm-sewer. It will find its way to the Canal and so up
  rivers to its mountains."</p>

  <p>"But what was that it brought, and from whom?"</p>

  <p>"From King Orm."</p>

  <p>"From whom?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"Tom," she said quietly, "I'm not going to tell you."</p>

  <p>"What was in that package, Evanie?"</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you that, either." She threw the cape over her arm,
  concealing the package. "I can't trust you, Tom. You and I are enemies."</p>

  <p>She backed away at his anger.</p>

  <p>"Tom, please! You promised to help me escape, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"All right," he yielded dully. "Evanie, I sought you out here because I
  wanted to end this misunderstanding. Please give me a chance to convince you
  I love you!"</p>

  <p>He held out his arms to her. She backed another step.</p>

  <p>"I won't come near you, Tom. I won't trust myself in your arms. I'm afraid
  of you, and I'm afraid of myself. You're strong&mdash;too strong for me
  physically, and perhaps too strong otherwise. You wakened my love once. I
  dare not chance it again."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Evanie! Now of all times, when I need you!"</p>

  <p>"Need me?" A queer expression flickered over her face. "So the Black Flame
  burns at last!" Her voice dropped to a murmur. "I'm sorry for you, Tom. I'm
  sorry for anyone who loves her, because she's utterly heartless. But I can't
  come near you. I don't dare!"</p>

  <p>She turned and darted suddenly into the Palace, leaving him to stare
  hopelessly after, and then to follow slowly.</p>

  <p>He slept little that night. Restless, tortured hours were filled with
  dreams of Margaret of Urbs and the sound of her laughter. He arose early and
  wandered dully from his room.</p>

  <p>The halls were crowded with arriving Immortals, among whom he stalked as
  silent and grave as them-selves. At last, tired of aimless wandering, he went
  into the shaded Gardens, and sat glumly down beside the pool.</p>

  <p>Far overhead Triangles drifted with muffled, throbbing roars, and a bird
  sang in the bushes. Deep in his own perturbed thoughts, he was startled when
  he heard his name spoken softly, almost timidly.</p>

  <p>"Tom."</p>

  <p>He looked up. Margaret of Urbs stood beside him, garbed in the most
  magnificent gown he had ever seen, golden and black, and concealing her tiny
  feet. Instead of the circlet of the previous evening, she wore now a coronet
  of scintillant brilliance, and the strange flower flamed at her waist.</p>

  <p>"Official robes," she said and smiled. "I preside this morning."</p>

  <p>She looked a little worn, he thought. There was a pallor on her cheeks,
  and a subdued air about her. Her smile, almost wistful, tore at him.</p>

  <p>"You didn't give me a chance to thank you for last night," he said.</p>

  <p>"Did you want to thank me? For&mdash;everything?"</p>

  <p>"No," he said stonily. "Not for everything."</p>

  <p>She dropped listlessly to the bench beside him.</p>

  <p>"I'm tired," she said wearily. "I didn't sleep well, and my head aches.
  That Grecian wine. I must see Martin Sair."</p>

  <p>"My head aches for other reasons," he said grimly. "I'm sorry, Tom."</p>

  <p>"Were you laughing at me last night?" he blazed. "No," she said gently.
  "No."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you!"</p>

  <p>"No matter. Tom, I came here to tell you something." She paused and gazed
  steadily at him. "The Master will grant you immortality."</p>

  <p><i>"What?"</i></p>

  <p>She nodded. "He considers you worthy."</p>

  <p>"Worthy! What of the children of mine he was so anxious about?"</p>

  <p>"You're to have them first."</p>

  <p>He laughed bitterly. "Then I'll be old and feeble by the time I'm ready
  for immortality. Evanie has refused me&mdash;and I refuse him! I'll live my
  life out in my own way."</p>

  <p>"Think well of it first," she said slowly, and something in her voice
  caught him.</p>

  <p>"Now I know I won't accept," he flashed. "You begged him for it! Do you
  think I'd take favors of you?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't&mdash;" She was silent. After a moment she said, "Would you
  believe one statement of mine, Tom?"</p>

  <p>"Not one."</p>

  <p>At last his bitterness touched her. She flushed faintly. The old gleam of
  mockery shone for an instant.</p>

  <p>"You're right, of course," she snapped. "There's nothing real remaining of
  Margaret of Urbs. She's the Black Flame that burns on illusion's altar. You
  must never believe a single word of hers."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I!"</p>

  <p>"But will you believe one sentence if I swear it by something sacred to
  me? One thing, Tom?"</p>

  <p>"What's sacred to you? God? Honor? Not even yourself!"</p>

  <p>"By the one thing I love," she said steadily, "I swear I'm speaking the
  truth now. Will you believe me?"</p>

  <p>It was on his very tongue to say no. He was thoroughly surprised to hear
  himself mutter "Yes"&mdash;and mean it.</p>

  <p>"Then do you remember that day in the Triangle when I said I was going to
  commit suicide? I swear that is the only lie I've ever told you. Do you
  understand? The only lie!"</p>

  <p>She arose as he stared at her uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"I want to be alone," she whispered. "I'm going to"&mdash;a brief, wistful
  smile&mdash;"my thinking room."</p>

  <p>Connor's brain was whirling. He did believe her. What of it? Evanie didn't
  love him. He knew that now. And he didn't love Evanie. And Margaret of
  Urbs&mdash;said she loved him! Could it be possible...</p>

  <p>A blinding light in his brain! The Black Flame&mdash;his! The unearthly
  beauty of her, the wild, untamed character, his to tame&mdash;if he could.
  The Satanic spirit, the fiery soul, all his for life. For life? For
  immortality, if he chose!</p>

  <p>An exultant shout burst from him and went echoing between the walls as he
  leaped to the Palace door, flung himself through.</p>

  <p>Memory of Evanie had vanished like mist. Where was the Princess? In her
  thinking room? Then he remembered. The laboratory behind the Throne Room.</p>

  <p>A speaker blared down the hall as he ran: "Conclave in thirty
  minutes."</p>

  <p>The corridors were thronged; he jostled his way past crowds of guards,
  servants, officials, and austere Immortals. Curious eyes followed him, but no
  one moved to halt him.</p>

  <p>Not, at least, until he reached the great arch of the Throne Room itself.
  The crystal doors were shut and a line of four impassive guards blocked the
  way. He moved to step between them, and a sharp challenge sounded.</p>

  <p>He paused. "I want to see the Princess," he said firmly.</p>

  <p>"None to pass," snapped the guard. "Master's orders."</p>

  <p>"But is the Princess in there?"</p>

  <p>"Her Highness," responded the guard, "entered here five minutes ago, She
  said nothing of any one to follow."</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24">24. THE ATOMIC BOMB</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Reluctantly, Tom Connor fell back. This was the only way to
  her laboratory; of that he was certain. He leaned against the wall and
  clenched his fists in a frenzy of impatience.</p>

  <p>The glass doors opened and the Master emerged, accompanied by Martin Sair,
  and two other tall Immortals.</p>

  <p>"Sir," Connor begged eagerly, "tell this fellow to pass me. I want to see
  the Princess."</p>

  <p>A curious, quizzical expression flickered in the eyes of the great ruler.
  He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Thomas," he said mildly. "In fifteen minutes the Princess will
  be needed. You can wait."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I think she wants to see me!"</p>

  <p>"Then she can wait as well.," His eyes flickered again. "She has waited,
  not too patiently, for more than seven centuries." He moved away down the
  corridor, leaving Connor nonplussed.</p>

  <p>He curbed his impatience. After all, the Master was right. Time stretched
  before him and Margaret of Urbs &mdash;years upon years of it. But it was
  hard to lose these precious moments.</p>

  <p>He thought of the vision screens. Just behind him was the vast office
  opposite the Throne Room. He turned in there, bursting in upon a scene of
  feverish activity as the records of half the world were made ready for the
  Immortals of the Southern Hemisphere. Glancing about, he descried a screen on
  a table at the far end of the room, and twisted his way down the line of
  desks, ignoring a thousand staring clerks.</p>

  <p>"The Princess," he said eagerly, snapping the switch. "In her laboratory
  behind the Throne Room."</p>

  <p>On the screen flashed a girl's face, but not that of Margaret of Urbs.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "No calls to any at the Conclave. Master's orders."
  The screen clicked blank again as he growled an angry epithet.</p>

  <p>In the hallway he saw Evanie, staring with strange intentness at the
  closed glass doors. He pushed his way to her side.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he said, and was puzzled by her sudden look of fear. But she
  recovered herself and glanced coolly at him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you," she said briefly.</p>

  <p>He thought wonderingly how different was this Evanie from the timid,
  modest little Ormon girl of so few days ago. But he hardly cared. The Flame
  had burned him free of Evanie.</p>

  <p>"Waiting for the parade of the Immortals?" he asked with a quiet
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"I thought you hated them so that you'd prefer not even looking at
  them."</p>

  <p>Her voice changed to bitterness. "I do."</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the answer, then?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at a watch on her wrist.</p>

  <p>"You'll know in a moment or two." She gave him a curiously sardonic smile.
  "I'm not afraid to tell you now. I'll even tell you what was in the package I
  took from the amphimorph. Would you like to know?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>Her voice quivered excitedly. "In that package was an atomic bomb!"</p>

  <p>"An atomic bomb?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And do you know where it is now?" The voice rose exultant,
  fanatically elated. "At the wall behind the Throne of Urbs! Behind the throne
  where the Master's sitting this moment!" She laughed at his horrified face.
  "My thanks for sponsoring my request for freedom, Tom. It helped."</p>

  <p>"The Master isn't in there," he said tightly. "I saw him leave."</p>

  <p>He saw her face whiten&mdash;and then an appalling thought struck him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God! But the Princess is! The Princess is!"</p>

  <p>He dashed toward the guarded door, disregarding Evanie's cry of warning:
  "Tom, it's due! It's due!"</p>

  <p>He rushed at the impassive guards, but before their challenge was uttered
  a thunderous roar reverberated in the vast hall like the rumbling thunder of
  a collapsing mountain.</p>

  <p>A continuous screaming bellow like the clamor in hell rose in an ear-
  blasting crescendo, and beyond the glass doors rolled billowing clouds of
  steam, shot through with jagged fires.</p>

  <p>Maddened to desperation, Tom Connor plunged against the doors. They swung
  inward and closed behind him, and he was in the room of the blast. Far down,
  behind the Master's throne, an erupting geyser of destruction appalled
  him&mdash;a mighty, roaring, billowing cloud of smoke-streaked steam that
  shrieked louder than the tortured souls of the seventh circle of hell.</p>

  <p>Crashing discharges of stray energy etched flames through the cloud, like
  lightning behind a thunder-head, and the reverberations echoed above the roar
  of the disrupting hydrogen. The Master's throne was hidden by the bellowing
  fires that grounded to it.</p>

  <p>But even that holocaust had not yet filled the vast concave of the Throne
  Room. The end where Connor stood, momentarily bewildered, was as yet clouded
  only by shreds and streamers. He lowered his head, and charged into the
  inferno. Margaret was caught somewhere behind that hellish blast!</p>

  <p>Scalding steam licked at him, swirling about his body. His bare legs and
  shoulders stung at the touch, his face burned, but he gained the line of
  thrones and paused a single moment on the shielded side. What an engine of
  destruction! A bomb that, instead of venting its force in a single blast,
  kept on exploding as successive billions of atoms shattered.</p>

  <p>No need to look for the door. The detonation, the first blast, had blown
  the wall open. Instantly he made a dash over the scorching debris, where the
  mighty girders were fantastically twisted and bent away from the roaring
  center, pointed up in the misty light. He launched himself at the edge of the
  opening, passing close to the very threshold of the trap-door of Tophet.</p>

  <p>Gamma radiations excoriated his body. The shriek of dying atoms thundered
  against his tortured eardrums, and he was burning&mdash;blistering. But an
  implacable thrust urged him on. He was responsible for this chaos, this
  holocaust, and Margaret of Urbs&mdash; He had violated his oath to the
  Master! Evanie had betrayed him into that! She had tricked him into
  sponsoring her plea for freedom, and because he had aided her this had
  happened! Jan Orm could have done no damage alone. Only Evanie, because of
  the inhuman blood in her, could have dealt with an amphimorph. Evanie, with
  whom he had thought himself in love!</p>

  <p>And the Princess, whom he did love, was somewhere beyond. He raged on, his
  mind turbulent as the blast itself, into Martin Sair's laboratory, a flaming
  outer region of hell clouded to invisibility. Suffocating, scorching, he
  crashed against its farther wall, slid along it, at last found the door.</p>

  <p>The luxurious room of the Princess was in chaotic disorder, but only lazy
  wisps of steam drifted there, and the bellow of the blast was muffled. But
  even now the wall was cracking.</p>

  <p>"Margaret!" he cried. "Margaret of Urbs!"</p>

  <p>Her voice answered him. She was in a corner, crouching. Injured? No, she
  was searching earnestly through a pile of debris that had been swept across
  the room by the first concussion. He rushed toward her.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" he shouted. "We'll break a window and get out."</p>

  <p>She glanced coolly up.</p>

  <p>"A window? Try it. A bullet might, but nothing less."</p>

  <p>He snatched up a chair, spun it fiercely against the pane. The chair
  shattered; two tiny dents showed in the crystal, and that was all. And in the
  Palace, ventilated by washed air from the topmost pinnacles of the Twin
  Towers, no windows opened. He whirled on her.</p>

  <p>"Then it will have to be back through the blast!" he roared. "Come
  on!"</p>

  <p>She stood up, facing him. She had slipped off the gold-black robe in the
  steaming heat, wore now the typical revealing garb of Urbs save that the
  material was of black velvet instead of metallic scales.</p>

  <p>"You can't go through in clothes like that!" he shouted. "My Venus," she
  said. "It was blown somewhere here. I want it."</p>

  <p>"You'll come now!"</p>

  <p>"I want my ivory Venus."</p>

  <p>The pale flash of ivory caught his eye.</p>

  <p>"Here it is, then," he snapped, thrusting the statuette into his belt.
  "Now come."</p>

  <p>Faint mockery flashed in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What if I don't?"</p>

  <p>He shook a rugged fist. "You will or I'll take you."</p>

  <p>"Why," she asked, "do you risk your life to reach me?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he snarled in exasperation, "I was unwittingly responsible for
  this. I was tricked into breaking my word. Do you think I can let the
  Master&mdash;or you &mdash;suffer for my stupidity?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," she said, her eyes dropping. "Well&mdash;I won't go."</p>

  <p>"By God, you will!" He sprang to seize her but she evaded him.</p>

  <p>But only for a moment, as again he saw the gleam of mockery in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said, suddenly submissive.</p>

  <p>He snatched the flowing robe from the floor as she turned and walked
  steadily toward the wall that now heaved and cracked and groaned. Before he
  could reach her she had flung open the door&mdash;and hell roared in upon
  them.</p>

  <p>Martin Sair's laboratory was a mass of smoke and steam like the crater of
  Erebus that flames in the eternal ice of Antarctica. Flinging the robe over
  the Princess like an enshrouding blanket, Connor propelled her, muffled and
  stumbling, toward the evil effulgence of the screaming blast.</p>

  <p>At the break in the wall he put his weight into a mighty thrust that sent
  her sliding, staggering, sprawling into the room where the fiery cloud
  closed, billowing, about her. Then he leaped through, his flesh writhing in
  the torment of the stinging rays, and blistering at the touch of scalding
  steam.</p>

  <p>Margaret of Urbs was clambering to her feet, stumbling in the entangling
  robe, in the all but unbearable shelter of the thrones. She choked as the
  searing air reached her lungs.</p>

  <p>"You hurt!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>Again the taunting gleam, even with blistering death staring them in the
  face. But she followed unresisting as he -seized her arm and plunged through
  the blinding fog of steam and smoke that now filled the mighty room to the
  distant ceiling. Blind chance was their guide as they rushed ahead,
  staggering, coughing, teary-eyed. It seemed a long way. Were they circling in
  the gloom of the monstrous chamber?</p>

  <p>The Princess dragged against Connor's arm.</p>

  <p>"No," she gasped. "This way&mdash;this way."</p>

  <p>He let her lead. They struggled through billowing masses that began to
  take fantastic shapes&mdash;charging monsters; heaving mountains. She
  staggered, stumbled, but shook off the arm he raised to support her.</p>

  <p>"I've never needed help," she muttered proudly. "I never will."</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that the blast roared closer. "Are we&mdash;right?" he
  choked.</p>

  <p>Then, through a momentary rift he saw something that sickened
  him&mdash;the row of thrones, smoking and blackened in the blaze. They had
  circled!</p>

  <p>Through some vagary of draught or ventilation therewas a little area of
  almost clear air beside the throne of the Princess. Coughing and choking,
  they faced each other in it. He was astounded to see a flickering, taunting
  smile play for a single instant on her lips. Her hair singed and plastered
  flat by the steamy condensation, her face soot-streaked and reddened, she was
  yet so incredibly lovely that he forgot even their peril as her smile turned
  suddenly earnest, wistful.</p>

  <p>"Dearest," she whispered, inaudibly, but he read her lips. "I'll confess
  now. We were safe in my room. We must have been watched in the vision
  screens, and men would have come to cut through the window."</p>

  <p>He was appalled.</p>

  <p>"Then why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Tom. Even here I misled you, for I knew which way the door
  lies by the pattern on the floor. But if you will not love me, I must kill
  you as I promised, then both of us die! For I cannot watch you age year by
  year&mdash;and then perish. I cannot!"</p>

  <p>"Flame!" he roared, his voice impassioned. "But I love you! Did you
  think&mdash;I love you, Flame!" Her streaming eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" she choked. "Now it's too late!" She covered her face, then
  abruptly glanced up again, with a dawning hope in her eyes. "Perhaps not!"
  she cried. "Can they see us here? No&mdash;the steam. But men will come in
  moon-suits to carry away the blast&mdash;if&mdash;we can live&mdash;until
  then." She coughed. "But we can't." She was swaying. "You go&mdash;that way.
  Kiss me, Tom, and leave me. I want to die&mdash;on the throne&mdash;of Urbs.
  Only&mdash;a thing&mdash;like this, some accident&mdash;can kill
  an&mdash;Immortal!"</p>

  <p>"Leave you?" he cried. "Not even in death!" He choked as he drew her
  close.</p>

  <p>A wave of steam and fire engulfed them. "Help me to my&mdash;throne," she
  whispered, gasping.</p>

  <p>Her eyes, tear-bright and sea-green in the fierce lightnings, went blank.
  They closed, and she slipped half through his arms. Her knees gave way as she
  collapsed.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap25"
     id="chap25">25. INFERNO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He held her against him. Put her on the throne? Why not? Why
  not hold her there until the end, die with her in his arms? Or perhaps shield
  her with his body until men came, or until the blast burned out. Somehow she
  must be saved!</p>

  <p>Never&mdash;not even when a thousand years ago an electric current was
  shot through him to kill him, had his urge for life been so great as it was
  now. Now, when life promised so much&mdash;the love of himself and the Black
  Flame of Urbs, two beings who should have been dead centuries ago and in
  different ages&mdash;he must die!</p>

  <p>Had Destiny kept them alive to meet and love for this brief moment before
  death? Madness! Better to die struggling for life. Raising the girl in his
  arms, he staggered away toward the wall that still shielded the room where he
  found the Princess.</p>

  <p>Her weight was slight, but he had not taken ten steps when he went
  crashing to his knees. He struggled up dizzily. The line of diagonal black
  squares showed dim on the floor, yet he could not be sure that he had not
  changed his direction. He was suffocating; the roaring blast seemed to bellow
  in a gigantic throbbing, now in his very ears, now dim and faint and far
  away.</p>

  <p>He battled on. Suddenly he realized that he was moving burdenless. Without
  even being aware of it he had dropped the Princess. He turned grimly back
  until he stumbled over her lying huddled with her cheek against the steaming
  floor. Swinging her across his shoulder, gripping her kneesso tightly that
  his fingers bit into the silk-soft skin, he staggered back over the lost
  ground.</p>

  <p>Each step was a gamble with death. If he fell now he would never rise
  again. He tottered on while his lungs labored in the vitiated air and the
  searing steam. Then behind him the blast roared fainter. Or was it simply
  that his senses were dulling?</p>

  <p>It was the sharp blow of his head against the wall that brought him back
  from a dreamy somnolence into which he was falling, surprised to feel the
  weight of the unconscious girl still on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The wall! Which wall? In what direction was the door that meant life? He
  groaned and turned at random to the right, simply because his right arm
  clutched the limbs of Margaret of Urbs and his left hand was free to support
  him against the carved masonry. But an ejaculation of triumph escaped his
  burned, cracked lips as his hand slid over steam-clouded glass, and he saw
  white faces through the track it left.</p>

  <p>He could go no further; make not one more move. The limp body of the
  Princess slid from his arms, and vaguely then he knew that both of them were
  being dragged into the safety of the corridor. He gasped in great breaths of
  clear air that whistled in his seared throat, and then his heart chilled as
  his bloodshot eyes turned on the form of the Flame.</p>

  <p>Her face frightened him. Waxen pale, still as the image on her throne, she
  seemed scarcely to breathe. A grave Immortal who bent above her straightened
  up and said tensely:</p>

  <p>"Get Martin Sair&mdash;and quickly!" His eyes flashed to Connor. "You're
  not hurt," he said. "Just rest here for some time."</p>

  <p>There was a stir in the hallway. Two men in brown all-encompassing suits
  and crystal helmets were pulling something metal. It looked like a
  steam-shovel scoop with two fifty-foot handles. A grapple for the blast, to
  box it before it undermined the vast Palace.</p>

  <p>Then Martin Sair was at hand, and the Master, his sorrowful eyes on the
  Princess.</p>

  <p>"Clear the corridor," said the sandy-haired Immortal, and guards swept
  back the crowd.</p>

  <p>Through the North Arch, Connor glimpsed thousands upon thousands of Urbans
  on the Palace lawn, and then they were hidden as the gates closed.</p>

  <p>"He must go, too," said Martin Sair, nodding at Connor. "The fewer lungs
  here the better. The girl is asphyxiated."</p>

  <p>"No!" Connor croaked, flinging an arm across the Flame.</p>

  <p>"All right. Move aside, then."</p>

  <p>But a roaring like all the tortured souls since creation burst from the
  opening doors. Out rushed the gnome-like men pulling their grapple, and
  Connor thrust his body between them and the Princess, taking the fierce rays
  on his own flesh.</p>

  <p>The container glowed brilliant as the sun, and out beyond the North Arch a
  chain dropped from the sky&mdash;a Triangle to bear away the deadly thing, to
  drop it into the sea. And the Palace was silent now as the silence of
  death.</p>

  <p>Death? Tom Connor glanced fearfully at the marble features of Margaret of
  Urbs. They were like death, too, and he gazed so fascinated that he was
  utterly surprised to look up and see Evanie and Jan Orm being herded down the
  corridor by half a dozen grim-faced guards.</p>

  <p>"Trying to escape out of the South Gate," said one.</p>

  <p>The Master turned cold, burning eyes on them, and then again looked
  sorrowfully down on the still perfection of the features of the Black
  Flame.</p>

  <p>An Immortal placed a box at Martin Sail's side.</p>

  <p>"Adrenalin!" snapped the Giver of Life, and took the tube the other handed
  him. "Amino-hyoscine! Daturamine!"</p>

  <p>He pressed the pale flesh of the girl's arm, parted the closed lids to
  gaze into unseeing eyes. Finally, in the familiar manner of an ancient
  physician, he placed thumb and forefinger on her wrist, frowning as he felt
  for the faint throb of her pulse.</p>

  <p>"Suffocated," he repeated. "Asphyxia."</p>

  <p>In an agony of apprehension, his eyes blurred, Connor watched the slow
  rise and fall of her breast. Twice he fancied that the movement had ceased,
  and each time with an almost inaudible gasp, the labored breathing
  re-commenced. Then it did cease; he was positive, and a great wave of despair
  engulfed him.</p>

  <p>"Her heart's stopping," Martin Sair said briefly.</p>

  <p>Dying! Tom Connor gazed wildly about the corridor. Uncomprehending, he saw
  the grim light of triumph in the face of Evanie Sair as she looked coldly
  down on the fading glory of the Black Flame.</p>

  <p>That such beauty should perish&mdash;be thrust into the earth&mdash;turn
  into a heap of crumbling bones! Unthinkable!</p>

  <p>"Dying!" Connor croaked. "Dying!"</p>

  <p>Martin Sair said only, "Now! Cardiacine! And get the oxygen mask
  ready."</p>

  <p>"Dying!" he croaked again.</p>

  <p>The Giver of Life glanced coldly at him.</p>

  <p>"Dying!" He echoed impassively. "No. Dead. What of it?"</p>

  <p>The Master turned grimly away and passed silently into the Throne Room
  with a word of brief command to the guards. They thrust Evanie Sair and Jan
  Orm before them, but Tom Connor did not miss the backward glance of triumph
  which the girl flung defiantly at him.</p>

  <p>Connor gazed desolately on the lovely clay that had been the Black Flame
  of Urbs, wondering dully why Martin Sair still bent so attentively above her,
  still kept the pale wrist in his hand.</p>

  <p>He started when the austere Immortal moved, placed his lips close to the
  cold ones of the girl, and rapped out: "Now! The mask!"</p>

  <p>The Giver of Life jammed a cone over the still face. There was a moment's
  silence; nothing happened. The scientist bent closer. Abruptly he placed his
  hands about the waist of the Princess, shook her violently, until her head
  rolled from side to side. He slapped her breast, her cheeks. And then, like
  the faint sighing of evening wind, she breathed.</p>

  <p>A thin, muffled gasp&mdash;no more. But life-bearing oxygen flowed into
  her lungs, and the suspended metabolism of her body resumed its interrupted
  chemistries. Her breathing strengthened to a labored, whistling, panting.</p>

  <p>"Chain-Stokes breathing," muttered Martin Sair, whose genius had recalled
  a spirit already treading the pathways of eternity. The Black Flame,
  rekindled, burned dimly and flickeringly&mdash;but burned!</p>

  <p>It was past Connor to comprehend. The transition from the depths of
  desolation to the peak of hope was too vast to span in a moment. He merely
  gazed blankly on the mask-covered face of the Princess. When realization
  began to dawn, the cry of amazement and ecstasy strangled in his scarred
  throat and became only an inchoate gurgle. He managed a choked question.</p>

  <p>"Will she&mdash;live?" He moved as if to clasp her in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" snapped Martin Sair. "On your life, don't touch her yet. Give her
  red corpuscles time to oxygenate. The girl's asphyxiated, suffocated,
  strangled! Do you want it all to do over again?" His eyes perceived the
  anguish in Connor's face, and he softened. "Of course she'll live. Did you
  think Death could so easily defeat Martin Sair? He has beaten me many a time,
  but never in so mild a contest as this!"</p>

  <p>The great Immortal again bent over the girl. Her breathing had eased. For
  a terrible instant Connor thought it was ceasing once more. Martin Sair
  lifted the mask from the pallid, perfect features, still quiet as marble save
  for the sighing of her breathing.</p>

  <p>"Now the elixir vitae," he said. "That will put fire into this chilly
  blood."</p>

  <p>He took a phial of ruby liquid from the hand of his silent assistant, the
  same potent stimulant, it appeared, that had roused Evanie from the deathlike
  sleep of the Messenger.</p>

  <p>The Princess was far too deep in unconsciousness to swallow. Martin Sair
  poured a tiny, trickling stream between her lips, no more than a few crimson
  drops. It was enough. As it made its fiery way down her throat she moaned and
  her exquisite face twisted as if in agony. The limp hands clenched
  convulsively into white fists.</p>

  <p>Martin Sair rose.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said to his grave assistant, "there was nothing organically
  wrong. Oxygen-starved, that was all. The organism was undamaged. The blood
  had not even begun to coagulate. It was simply necessary to start the body
  machine working, since it was in perfect running order."</p>

  <p>"Cardiacine is a gamble," his assistant said slowly. "I've had it rupture
  the hearts in some cases."</p>

  <p>Martin Sair snorted. "Not with proper precautions. Daturamine and amino-
  hyoscine first. Cardiacine is powerful, of course." He mused. "I've seen it
  produce pulsations in the heart of a man ten days dead."</p>

  <p>Connor ceased to listen. Cases! As if this were a medical case, this
  miracle! They droned on without even a glance at the pain-racked, exquisite
  face. Tom Connor touched her cold cheeks, kissed the soot-streaked fore-
  head.</p>

  <p>"Careful!" warned Martin Sair.</p>

  <p>"But she breathes!" Connor whispered exultantly. "You're
  sure&mdash;certain she'll live?"</p>

  <p>"She'll be conscious in ten minutes. A little sick, but conscious." The
  scientist's tone softened again. "In two days she'll be as bright as ever.
  After all, her body is the body of a twenty-year-old girl. She has youth,
  resilience. You can stop worrying."</p>

  <p>Someone touched Connor's shoulder; a guard, who began droning, <i>"Orbis
  Terrarum Imperator&mdash;"</i></p>

  <p>"I won't go!" Tom Connor blazed. "I'm staying here!"</p>

  <p>"She's out of danger, I tell you," insisted Martin Sair. "If she were ever
  in danger&mdash;with me at hand!"</p>

  <p>Hesitantly then, Connor followed the guard, glancing apprehensively back
  at Margaret of Urbs, prone on the stone floor of the corridor. Then he
  reluctantly went on into the Throne Room.</p><hr>

  <h2><a name="chap26"
     id="chap26">26. THE MASTER SITS IN JUDGMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the throne room the ventilators had drawn out the steam
  and smoke-poisoned air, but moisture dripped from the walls and gathered in
  pools on the floor. The terrific destruction of the blast was evident
  everywhere. No single hanging remained on walls or windows. Everything
  inflammable was in cinders, and the very floor was still almost blistering
  hot.</p>

  <p>The far end was a mass of indescribable ruin, debris from the shattered
  wall, even fragments of the diorite bases of the thrones. The air, despite
  the humming ventilators, was stifling in the radiations from floor and
  walls.</p>

  <p>The Master sat upon the half-melted wreckage of his throne, his stem eyes
  on Evanie and Jan Orm, who stood between guards before him.</p>

  <p>The frightened look on Evanie's face moved Connor despite the injuries she
  had done him. After all, she had nursed him out of the very grave and given
  him, penniless and strange, a home and a place in this bizarre world. She was
  clinging frantically to the arm of Jan, who stood morose and impassive before
  the Master.</p>

  <p>"Thomas," the ruler said, "I can get nothing from this sullen pair. Tell
  me what you know of this."</p>

  <p>Connor met Evanie's terrified gaze, and it wrung pity from him. He owed
  much to this girl. Was it any more than right that he help her now? At least
  he could confuse the issue, prolong it until he could obtain the aid of
  Margaret of Urbs.</p>

  <p>"I did it myself!" he said promptly.</p>

  <p>There was no change in the Master's face.</p>

  <p>"You?" he repeated mildly. "How?"</p>

  <p>"I made the bomb in Martin Sair's laboratory," Connor said, with a quick
  warning glance at Evanie. "I made it at night, and smuggled it in here during
  the darkness. That's all."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? After your oath, Thomas? And I had flattered myself that you were
  my friend&mdash;my esteemed friend."</p>

  <p>There was something inscrutable in the Master's face. The grave eyes
  surveyed Connor sorrowfully as he fingered a beam-pistol.</p>

  <p>"I think," said the Master, slipping out the weapon, "that I will destroy
  you once and for all, Connor." He leveled the gun.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" shrieked Jan Orm. "He didn't do it&mdash;I did!" He paused as the
  Master's cool eyes shifted to him. "I had it made in Ormon and smuggled here
  to me. I hid itin the Throne Room early this morning, before any one was
  about!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Master slowly, "I might believe that both of you had a
  hand in it."</p>

  <p>His eyes flickered over Evanie.</p>

  <p>She drew herself erect.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" she said dully. "I won't have you two shielding me. I
  did it. I had the bomb smuggled to me by an amphimorph, who rode a bubble
  down the mains to the pool in the Gardens. That's the truth."</p>

  <p>"Suppose, then," said the Master, "I destroy all three of you, and thus
  assure myself that the guilty one is punished."</p>

  <p>"I don't care!" Evanie flung out defiantly. "I'm sorry I failed, but at
  least I've extinguished the Black Flame of Urbs&mdash;and I'm glad!"</p>

  <p>The ruler's eyes held a curious light as he gazed over their heads. A step
  sounded behind them. Connor whirled to see Margaret of Urbs approaching,
  supported by the arm of Martin Sair. Soot-stained, the whole slim length of
  her right leg red and blistered by the blast, her right cheek inflamed by the
  contact with the steaming floor, she was yet so incredibly lovely that she
  was breath-taking. Tom Connor sprang to her side, slipped a steadying arm
  about her as she swayed willingly against him. Evanie, so pale she seemed
  about to faint, was leaning weakly against Jan Orm.</p>

  <p>"What's all this, Joaquin?" asked the Princess.</p>

  <p>"Merely an attempt to fix responsibility for the bombing, my dear."</p>

  <p>"And have you fixed it?"</p>

  <p>"All three claim the honor."</p>

  <p>"I see." She paused. "Well, I can throw some light on the mystery.
  <i>I</i> am responsible for the bomb explosion. It was an accident. I was
  watching some detonol crystallize, in Martin Sair's room, and forgot to take
  it off the burner. I was stunned by the concussion, and Thomas Connor rushed
  in and guided me out. Somewhere in the Throne Room I suppose I must have been
  overcome."</p>

  <p>She paused again, staring back at the Master.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? Each of these three suspects the others and each is trying
  to shield his friends. But I did it; it was an accident."</p>

  <p>She slipped from Connor's arm and sank wearily to the steps that led to
  her ruined Throne.</p>

  <p>"I burn!" she muttered, and sipped the goblet of water that a guard held
  to her lips.</p>

  <p>Quizzically, the Master gazed down at her.</p>

  <p>"You know," he said, suddenly stern, "that to me the one unforgivable sin
  is the thwarting of my plans. Not even you, my sister, may stand in the way
  of them. While I live, I am the Master. I shall yield only when a power
  arises strong enough to overthrow me, for that will tell me that my work is
  done. When that occurs, I shall have guided humanity as far as I am able
  along the path of Destiny, but until then&mdash;I am the Master."</p>

  <p>His face, austere as an image in basalt, loomed over them. For the first
  time Connor glimpsed dimly the colossus behind the mild mask, the diamond
  hardness below the silk that sheathed it. Then the ruler smiled.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I cannot doubt my sister's word. I release all of you."</p>

  <p>He arose and descended from the throne.</p>

  <p>Connor followed a step or two. "I'm interested to learn," he whispered,
  "which of us you believe."</p>

  <p>The Master smiled again. "Haven't I just said?" He turned away. "Of
  course, if I were curious, I could ask you and Jan Orm how you knew what time
  to set the blast. I hadn't decided on a time for the Conclave until I had it
  announced in the corridors, and the bomb must have been placed between that
  moment and the arrival of the guards."</p>

  <p>"Or the Princess is telling the truth," suggested Tom Connor.</p>

  <p>"Some day Margaret shall explain why detonol causes a cloud of steam,"
  observed the Master. He continued absently, "Evanie has good blood in her. So
  has Jan Orm." Then he was gone, followed by Martin Sair and the guards.</p>

  <p>Connor returned to Margaret of Urbs. Evanie's incredulous eyes were fixed
  on the Princess as she whispered:</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>"Because I thought it would please Tom Connor," Margaret of Urbs said
  frankly.</p>

  <p>Evanie stared at her with dawning comprehension. "The Black Flame herself
  burned!" she murmured wonderingly. "I see now why we can still learn from the
  ancients. They're miracle workers." But the next instant her brown eyes
  glittered vindictively. "I'm glad at least that the conquest of the Flame was
  during my lifetime." She bowed half in wonderment, half in mockery, before
  Connor. "I salute the Prince consort of Urbs!"</p>

  <p>The Princess flushed faintly, and Connor laughed and glanced away.
  Something that sparkled in a pile of ashes caught his eye. He stooped to
  retrieve the marvelous crystalline flower, glowing brilliant and
  indestructible, untouched&mdash;even brightened&mdash;by the blast.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My moon-orchid," said Margaret of Urbs. "The only perfect one ever
  found."</p>

  <p>He grinned and turned to Evanie.</p>

  <p>"I promised you one. Here&mdash;our wedding present to you and Jan."</p>

  <p>"Engagement present, rather," said the Princess. "I owe you two somewhat
  more than you realize." She ignored both Evanie's silence and Jan Orm's
  protestations of mingled embarrassment, thanks, and refusal as he held the
  priceless thing. "Tom," she murmured, "would you mind if we
  were&mdash;alone?"</p>

  <p>It was dismissal. Jan and Evanie backed away with half-awe-struck glances
  at Connor. He dropped beside the weary Princess of Urbs, slipping his arm
  tenderly about her scorched shoulders. Even in the sultriness of that blasted
  chamber she shivered, her teeth chattered, so recently had the icy face of
  death withdrawn.</p>

  <p>He drew her close, then halted as he heard a distant, thin clamor beyond
  the windows.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he asked sharply. "Another revolution?"</p>

  <p>"Just the newspapers, I guess. You've been in them frequently of late."
  She smiled wanly. "As often as I, this past week. The Weed who sustained the
  ionic beams&mdash;revealed as a living ancient&mdash;proclaimed for
  immortality &mdash;the rescuer of Margaret of Urbs&mdash;and now&mdash;" She
  quoted ironically, "Margaret to Wed? Romance Rumored with Rescuer!" She
  nestled closer to him. "Oh, the down-fall of the Black Flame will be well
  publicized, never fear! Let them add this to their pictures and vision
  broadcasts. I don't care!"</p>

  <p>"Pictures? What pictures?" He glanced about the vast deserted chamber.</p>

  <p>"From the seeing room, of course! Don't you suppose we were watched all
  during the blast, even in here, as much as the steam permitted? Don't you
  know we're being watched now, photographed for papers, and broadcasts? You're
  world news, Tom." She frowned. 'They must have thought me mad to rush into
  that inferno with you, out of safety. Well&mdash;I was mad!"</p>

  <p>"You can't even die in privacy here!" Connor said bluntly. "Do you
  suppose"&mdash;his voice dropped to a whisper &mdash;"they heard what
  you&mdash;what we said?"</p>

  <p>"Above the roar of the blast? No. I thought of that when I&mdash;said
  it."</p>

  <p>He smiled at that. It was so typical of the utterly strange and
  fascinating character of the girl. He drew her against him, and felt the
  pressure of something hard. in his belt&mdash;the ivory Venus, still safe,
  still immaculate in its perfection, since it had been on the left side,
  shielded by his own flesh when he passed the blast.</p>

  <p>"I know what I shall give you as a wedding present," he said slowly. "The
  original Venus de Milo. The most beautiful statue of the ancient world."</p>

  <p>She smiled and a trace of the old mockery showed. "And I know what I shall
  give you," she said. "Life!"</p>

  <p>"Immortality?"</p>

  <p>"Not Immortality. Life." She turned her emerald eyes on him. "Tom, is it
  very hard to give up the idea of children? Men want children, don't
  they?"</p>

  <p>"Most of us do&mdash;but it's a happiness well lost for you." He glanced
  down at her. "Listen, can't this immortality thing be undone? Wouldn't it be
  possible for Martin Sair to render you mortal for&mdash;a few years?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Further exposure to the hard rays will do it."</p>

  <p>"And then," eagerly, "could we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The smile she flashed at him had in it a touch of heaven. "Yes," she said
  exultantly, but instantly a cloud chased away the smile. "But don't you
  remember what sort of children women bear who've been too long in the ray?
  Would you like to be father to a little amphimorph?"</p>

  <p>He shuddered. "Thank you. We'll do as we are then."</p>

  <p>She burst suddenly into laughter almost as mocking as her old self. Then
  she was as suddenly serious, tender.</p>

  <p>"Tom," she murmured, "I won't tease you. That will be my gift to you.
  Martin Sair can do what you wish. There is some leeway to the
  process&mdash;enough, perhaps, for a single time. My permanent age is twenty
  now; it will be twenty-five then. But who in all the world could have
  anticipated that the Black Flame would assume motherhood&mdash;and like it?
  Tom, that's my gift to you&mdash;life! Kiss me!"</p>

  <p>For a moment of ecstasy he felt her lips quiver against his.</p>

  <p>"Two boys and a girl!" she murmured. "Won't we, Tom?"</p>

  <p>"And can Martin Sair," he asked ironically, "fix that for us, too?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Two boys like you, Tom." She was suddenly dreamy-eyed.</p>

  <p>"But not a girl like you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because," Tom Connor laughed, "I don't think society could stand a second
  Black Flame!"</p>
