<h2>The Provincial Lady in America
<br><br>
by<br><br>E M Delafield
</h2>

<hr>

<p><i>July 7th.</i>&mdash;Incredulous astonishment on receiving by second
post&mdash;usually wholly confined to local bills and circulars
concerning neighbouring Garden F&ecirc;tes&mdash;courteous and charming
letter from publishers in America. They are glad to say that they feel
able to meet me on every point concerning my forthcoming visit to the
United States, and enclose contract for my approval and signature.</p>
<p>Am completely thrown on my beam-ends by this, but remember that visit
to America <i>was</i> once mooted and that I light-heartedly reeled off
stipulations as to financial requirements, substantial advances, and so
on, with no faintest expectation that anybody would ever pay the
slightest attention to me. This now revealed as complete fallacy. Read
contract about fourteen times running, and eyes&mdash;figuratively
speaking&mdash;nearly drop out of my head with astonishment. Can I
possibly be worth all this?</p>
<p>Probably not, but should like to see America, and in any case am
apparently committed to going there whether I want to or not.</p>
<p>Long and involved train of thought follows, beginning with necessity
for breaking this news to Robert at the most auspicious moment possible,
and going on to requirements of wardrobe, now at lowest possible ebb, and
speculating as to whether, if I leave immediately after children's summer
holidays, and return just before Christmas ones, it would not be
advisable to embark upon Christmas shopping instantly.</p>
<p>All is interrupted by telephone ring&mdash;just as well, as I am
rapidly becoming agitated&mdash;and voice says that it is Sorry to
Disturb Me but is just Testing the Bell. I say Oh, all right, and decide
to show publishers' letter to Robert after tea.</p>
<p>Am absent-minded all through tea as a result, and give Robert sugar,
which he doesn't take. He says Am I asleep or what, and I decide to
postpone announcement until evening.</p>
<p>It rains, and presently Florence appears and says If I please, the
water's coming in on the landing through the ceiling, and I say she had
better go at once and find Robert&mdash;it occurs to me too late that
this attitude is far from consistent with feminist views so often
proclaimed by myself&mdash;and meanwhile put small basin, really Vicky's
sponge-bowl, on stairs to catch water, which drips in steadily.</p>
<p>Return to writing-table and decide to make list of clothes required
for American trip, but find myself instead making list of all the things
I shall have to do before starting, beginning with passport requirements
and ending with ordering China tea from the Stores, 7 lbs. cheaper than
smaller quantity.</p>
<p>Just as I am bringing this exercise to a close Robert comes in, and
shortly afterwards I hear him stumble over sponge-bowl, on stairs, about
which nobody has warned him. This definitely precludes breaking American
news to him for the present.</p>
<p>He spends the evening up a ladder, looking at gutters, and I write to
American publishers but decide not to post letter for a day or two.</p>
<p><i>July 8th.</i>&mdash;Robert still unaware of impending
announcement.</p>
<p><i>July 10th.</i>&mdash;Telegram&mdash;reply prepaid&mdash;arrives
from American publishers' representative in London, enquiring what I have
decided, and this is unfortunately taken down over the telephone by
Robert. Full explanations ensue, are not wholly satisfactory, and am left
with extraordinary sensations of guilt and duplicity which I do not
attempt to analyse.</p>
<p>Woman called Mrs. Tressider, whom I once met when staying with Rose,
writes that she will be motoring in this direction with The Boy and will
call in on us about tea-time to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Why not go out? <i>Answer</i>: <i>(a)</i> The laws of
civilisation forbid. <i>(b)</i> Such a course might lead to trouble with
dear Rose. <i>(c)</i> Cannot think of anywhere to go.)</p>
<p>Write, on the contrary, amiable letter to Mrs. T. saying that I look
forward to seeing her and The Boy. Try to remember if I know anything
whatever about the latter, but nothing materialises, not even approximate
age. <i>Mem.:</i> Order extra milk for tea in case he turns out to be
very young&mdash;but this not probable, from what I remember of Mrs. T.'s
appearance.</p>
<p>Go with Robert in the afternoon to neighbouring Agricultural Show, and
see a good many iron implements, also a bath standing all by itself
outside a tent and looking odd, and a number of animals, mostly very
large. Meet the Frobishers, who say There are more people here than there
were last year, to which I agree&mdash;remember too late that I didn't
come at all last year. Subsequently meet the Palmers, who say Not so many
people as there were last year, and I again agree. Am slightly appalled
on reflection, and wonder what would happen in the event of Frobishers
and Palmers comparing notes as to their respective conversations with
me&mdash;but this is unlikely in the extreme. <i>(Query:</i> Are the
promptings of conscience regulated in proportion to the chances of
discovery in wrongdoing? <i>Answer:</i> Obviously of a cynical
nature.)</p>
<p>We continue to look at machinery, and Robert becomes enthusiastic over
extraordinary-looking implement with teeth, and does not consider quarter
of an hour too long in which to stand looking at it in silence. Feel that
personally I have taken in the whole of its charms in something under six
seconds&mdash;but do not, of course, say so. Fall instead into reverie
about America, imagination runs away with me, and I die and am buried at
sea before Robert says Well, if I've had enough of the
caterpillar&mdash;(caterpillar?)&mdash;What about some tea?</p>
<p>We accordingly repair to tea-tent&mdash;very hot and crowded, and
benches show tendency to tip people off whenever other people get up. I
drink strong tea and eat chudleighs, and cake with cherries in it. Small
girl opposite, wedged in between enormous grandfather and grandfather's
elderly friend, spills her tea, it runs down the table, which is on a
slope, and invades Robert's flannel trousers. He is not pleased, but says
that It doesn't Matter, and we leave tent.</p>
<p>Meet contingent from our own village, exchange amiable observations,
and Miss S. of the Post-Office draws me aside to ask if it is true that I
am going to America? I admit that it is, and we agree that America is A
Long Way Off; with rider from Miss S. to the effect that she has a
brother in Canada, he's been there for years and has a Canadian wife whom
Miss S. has never seen, and further addition that things seem to be in a
bad way there, altogether.</p>
<p>This interchange probably overheard by Robert, as he later in the
evening says to me rather suddenly that he supposes this American
business is really settled? I reply weakly that I suppose it is, and
immediately add, more weakly still, that I can cancel the whole thing if
he wants me to. To this Robert makes no reply whatever, and takes up
<i>The Times.</i></p>
<p>I listen for some time to unsympathetic female voice from the
wireless, singing song that I consider definitely repellent about a
forest, and address picture-postcards to Robin and Vicky at school,
switch off wireless just as unsympathetic female branches off into
something about wild violets, write list of clothes that I shall require
for America, and presently discover that I have missed the nine o'clock
news altogether. Robert also discovers this, and is again not
pleased.</p>
<p>Go up to bed feeling discouraged and notice a smell in the bathroom,
but decide to say nothing about it till morning. Robert, coming up hours
later, wakes me in order to enquire whether I noticed anything when I was
having my bath? Am obliged to admit that I did, and he says this means
taking up the whole of the flooring, and he'll take any bet it's a dead
rat. Do not take up this challenge as <i>(a)</i> he is probably right,
<i>(b)</i> I am completely sodden with sleep.</p>
<p><i>July 11th.</i>&mdash;Car of extremely antiquated appearance rattles
up to the door, and efficient-looking woman in grey trousers and a jumper
gets out, evidently Mrs. Tressider. The Boy is shortly afterwards
revealed, cowering amongst suit-cases, large kettle, portions of a
camp-bed, folding rubber bath and case of groceries, in back of car. He
looks pale and hunted, and is said to be fourteen, but seems to me more
like ten. (Extra milk, however, almost certainly superfluous.
<i>Mem.:</i> tell Cook to use up for pudding to-night.)</p>
<p>Mrs. T. very brisk and talkative, says that she and The Boy are on
their way to Wales, where they propose to camp. I hint that the holidays
have begun early and Mrs. T. shakes her head at me, frowns, hisses, and
then says in a loud voice and with an unnatural smile that The Boy hasn't
been very strong and was kept at home last term but will be going back
next, and what he'd love better than anything would be a ramble round my
lovely garden.</p>
<p>Am well aware that this exercise cannot possibly take more than four
and a half minutes, but naturally agree, and The Boy disappears, looking
depressed, in the direction of the pigsty.</p>
<p>Mrs. T. then tells me that he had a nervous breakdown not long ago,
and that the school mismanaged him, and the doctor did him no good, and
she is taking the whole thing into her own hands and letting him Run Wild
for a time. (Should much like to enquire how she thinks he is to run wild
on back seat of car, buried under a mountain of luggage.)</p>
<p>She then admires the house, of which she hasn't seen more than the
hall door, says that I am marvellous&mdash;(very likely I am, but not for
any reasons known to Mrs. T.)&mdash;and asks if it is true that I am off
to America? Before I know where I am, we are discussing this quite
violently still standing in the hall. Suggestion that Mrs. T. would like
to go upstairs and take her hat off goes unheeded, so does appearance of
Florence with kettle on her way to the dining-room. I keep my eye fixed
on Mrs. T. and say Yes, Yes, but am well aware that Florence has seen
grey trousers and is startled by them, and will quite likely give notice
to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>Mrs. T. tells me about America&mdash;she knows New York well, and has
visited Chicago, and once spoke to a Women's Luncheon Club in Boston, and
came home <i>via</i> San Francisco and the Coast&mdash;and is still
telling me about it when I begin, in despair of ever moving her from the
hall, to walk upstairs. She follows in a sleep-walking kind of way, still
talking, and am reminded of Lady Macbeth, acted by Women's Institute last
winter.</p>
<p>Just as we reach top landing, Robert appears in shirt-sleeves, at
bathroom door, and says that <i>half</i> a dead rat has been found, and
the other half can't be far off. Have only too much reason to think that
this is probably true. Robert then sees Mrs. T., is introduced,
but&mdash;rightly&mdash;does not shake hands, and we talk about dead rat
until gong sounds for tea.</p>
<p>The Boy reappears&mdash;inclination to creep sideways, rather than
walk, into the room&mdash;and Mrs. T. asks Has he been galloping about
all over the place, and The Boy smiles feebly but says nothing, which I
think means that he is avoiding the lie direct.</p>
<p>Mrs. T. reverts to America, and tells me that I must let my flat
whilst I am away, and she knows the very person, a perfectly charming
girl, who has just been turned out of Taviton Street. I say: Turned out
of Taviton Street? and have vision of perfectly charming girl being led
away by the police to the accompaniment of stones and brickbats flung by
the more exclusive inhabitants of Taviton Street, but it turns out that
no scandal is implied, lease of perfectly charming girl's flat in Taviton
Street having merely come to an end in the ordinary way. She has, Mrs. T.
says, absolutely <i>nowhere</i> to go. Robert suggests a Y.W.C.A. and I
say what about the Salvation Army, but these pleasantries not a success,
and Mrs. T. becomes earnest, and says that Caroline Concannon would be
the <i>Ideal</i> tenant. Literary, intelligent, easy to get on with,
absolutely independent, and has a job in Fleet Street. Conceive violent
prejudice against C. C. on the spot, and say hastily that flat won't be
available till I sail, probably not before the 1st October. Mrs. T. then
extracts from me, cannot imagine how, that flat contains two rooms, one
with sofa-bed, that I am not in the least likely to be there during the
summer holidays, that it would Help with the Rent if I had a tenant
during August and September, and finally that there is no sound reason
why C. Concannon should not move in on the spot, provided I will post the
keys to her at once and write full particulars. Robert tries to back me
up by saying that the post has gone, but Mrs. T. is indomitable and
declares that she will catch it in the first town she comes to. She will
also write to C. C. herself, and tell her what an Opportunity it all is.
She then springs from the tea-table in search of writing materials, and
Robert looks at me compassionately and walks out into the garden,
followed at a distance by The Boy, who chews leaves as he goes, as if he
hadn't had enough tea.</p>
<p>Feel worried about this, and suggest to Mrs. T. that Fabian doesn't
look very strong, but she laughs heartily and replies that The. Boy is
one of the wiry sort, and it's against all her principles to worry.
Should like to reply that I wish she would apply this rule to her concern
about my flat&mdash;but do not do so. Instead, am compelled by Mrs. T. to
write long letter to her friend, offering her every encouragement to
become my tenant in Doughty Street.</p>
<p>This, when accomplished, is triumphantly put into her bag by Mrs. T.
with the assurance that she is pretty certain it is going to be
absolutely All Right. Feel no confidence that her definition of
all-rightness will coincide with mine.</p>
<p>We then sit in the garden and she tells me about education, a new cure
for hay-fever, automatic gear-changing, and books that she has been
reading. She also asks about the children, and I say that they are at
school, and she hopes that the schools are run on New Thought
lines&mdash;but to this I can only give a doubtful affirmative in Vicky's
case and a definite negative in Robin's. Mrs. T. shakes her head, smiles
and says something of which I only hear the word Pity. Feel sure that it
will be of no use to pursue this line any further, and begin firmly to
tell Mrs. T. about recent letter from Rose,&mdash;but in no time we are
back at education again, and benefits that The Boy has derived from being
driven about the country <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with his
parent. (Can only think that his previous state must have been deplorable
indeed, if this constitutes an improvement.)</p>
<p>Time goes on, Mrs. T. still talking, Robert looks over box-hedge once
and round may-tree twice, but disappears again without taking action. The
Boy remains invisible.</p>
<p>Gradually find that I am saying Yes and I See at recurrent intervals,
and that features are slowly becoming petrified into a glare. Mrs. T.
fortunately appears to notice nothing, and goes on talking. I feel that I
am probably going to yawn, and pinch myself hard, at the same time
clenching my teeth and assuming expression of preternatural alertness
that I know to be wholly unconvincing. Mrs. T. still talking. We reach
Caroline Concannon again, and Mrs. T. tells me how wonderfully fortunate
I shall be if what she refers to&mdash;inaccurately&mdash;as "our scheme"
materialises. Decide inwardly that I shall probably murder Caroline C.
within a week of meeting her, if she has anything like the number of
virtues and graces attributed to her by Mrs. T.</p>
<p>Just as I am repeating to myself familiar lines, frequently recurred
to in similar situations, to the effect that Time and the hour runs
through the roughest day, all is brought to an end by Mrs. T., who leaps
to her feet&mdash;movements surely extraordinarily sudden and energetic
for a woman of her age?&mdash;and declares that they really must be
getting on.</p>
<p>The Boy is retrieved, Robert makes final appearance round may-tree,
and we exchange farewells. (Mine much more cordial than is either
necessary or advisable, entirely owing to extreme relief at approaching
departure).</p>
<p>Mrs. T. wrings my hand and Robert's, smiles and nods a good deal, says
more about Caroline Concannon and the flat, and gets into driving seat.
The Boy is already crouching amongst luggage at the back, and car drives
noisily away.</p>
<p>Robert and I look at one another, but are too much exhausted to
speak.</p>
<p><i>July 17th.</i>&mdash;Decide that I must go to London, interview
Caroline Concannon, and collect Robin and Vicky on their way home from
school. I tell Robert this, and he says in a resigned voice that he
supposes this American plan is going to Upset Everything&mdash;which
seems to me both unjust and unreasonable. I explain at some length that
Caroline C. has been foisted on me by Mrs. Tressider, that I have been in
vigorous correspondence with her for days about the flat, and should like
to bring the whole thing to an end, and that an escort for Vicky from
London to Devonshire would have to be provided in any case, so it might
just as well be me as anybody else. To all of this Robert merely replies,
after some thought, that he always knew this American scheme would mean
turning everything upside down, and he supposes we shall just have to put
up with it.</p>
<p>Am quite unable to see that Robert has anything whatever to put up
with at present, but realise that to say so will be of no avail, and go
instead to the kitchen, where Cook begs my pardon, but it's all over the
place that I'm off to America, and she doesn't know what to answer when
people ask her about it. Nothing for it, evidently, but to tell Cook the
truth, which I do, and am very angry with myself for apologetic note that
I hear in my voice, and distinct sensation of guilt that invades me.</p>
<p>Cook does nothing to improve this attitude by looking cynically amused
when I mutter something about my publisher having wished me to visit New
York, and I leave the kitchen soon afterwards. Directly I get into the
hall, remember that I never said anything about eggs recently put into
pickle and that this has got to be done. Return to kitchen, Cook is in
fits of laughter talking to Florence, who is doing nothing at the
sink.</p>
<p>I say Oh, Cook&mdash;which is weak in itself, as an
opening&mdash;deliver vacillating statement about eggs, and go away again
quickly. Am utterly dissatisfied with my own conduct in this entire
episode, and try to make up for it&mdash;but without success&mdash;by
sharply worded postcard to the newsagent, who never remembers to send
<i>The Field</i> until it is a fortnight old.</p>
<p><i>July 20th. Doughty Street.</i>&mdash;Am taken to the station and
seen off by Robert, who refrains from further reference to America, and
regain Doughty Street flat, now swathed in dust-sheets. Remove these, go
out into Gray's Inn Road and buy flowers, which I arrange in
sitting-room, also cigarettes, and then telephone to Miss Caroline
Concannon in Fleet Street office. Fleet Street office replies austerely
that if I will wait a minute I shall be Put Through, and a good deal of
buzzing goes on. Draw small unicorn on blotting-pad while I wait. Another
voice says Do I want Miss Concannon? Yes, I do. Then just one minute,
please. At least three minutes elapse, and I draw rather good
near-Elizabethan cottage, with shading. Resentfully leave this unfinished
when C. Concannon at last attains the telephone and speaks to me. Voice
sounds young and cheerful, nicer than I expected. We refer to Mrs.
Tressider, and recent correspondence, and agree that an early interview
is desirable. Shall she, says Caroline C., come round at once in her tiny
car? Nothing could be easier. Am much impressed <i>(a)</i> at her having
a tiny car, <i>(b)</i> at her being able to drive it in London,
<i>(c)</i> at the ease with which she can leave Fleet Street office to
get on without her services.</p>
<p>Look round flat, which has suddenly assumed entirely degraded
appearance, feel certain that she will despise both me and it, and
hastily powder my nose and apply lipstick. Fleeting fancy crosses my mind
that it would look rather dashing, and perhaps impress C. C., if I put on
last year's beach-pyjamas&mdash;red linen, with coffee-coloured
top&mdash;but courage fails me, and I remain as I am, in blue delaine,
thirty-five shillings off the peg from Exeter High Street
establishment.</p>
<p>Car is audible outside, I look from behind curtains and see smallest
baby Austin in the world&mdash;(I should imagine)&mdash;draw up with
terrific <i>verve</i> outside the door. Incredibly slim and smart young
creature steps out&mdash;black-and-white frock with frills, tiny little
white hat well over one ear, and perfectly scarlet mouth. She is
unfortunately inspired to look up at window just as I crane my neck from
behind curtain, and am convinced that she has seen me perfectly well, and
is&mdash;rightly&mdash;disgusted at exhibition of vulgar and undignified
curiosity.</p>
<p>Bell rings&mdash;very autocratic touch, surely?&mdash;I open the door
and Miss C. comes in. Should be very sorry to think that I am dismayed
solely because she is younger, smarter and better-looking than I am
myself.</p>
<p>Agreeable conversation ensues, C. C. proves easy and ready to talk, we
meet on the subject of Mrs. Tressider&mdash;boy looks browbeaten, Mrs. T.
altogether too breezy and bracing&mdash;and further discover that we both
know, and rather admire, Pamela Pringle. What, I ask, is the latest about
Pamela, of whom I have heard nothing for ages? Oh, don't I know? says
Miss C. Not about the Stock-Exchange man, and how he put Pamela on to a
perfectly good thing, and it went up and up, and Pamela sold out and went
to Antibes on the proceeds, and had a most thrilling affair with a
gigolo, and the Stock Exchange nearly went mad? At this I naturally
scream for details, which C. C. gives me with immense enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We remain utterly absorbed for some time, until at last I remember
that the flat still has to be inspected, and offer to show Miss C. round.
(This a complete farce, as she could perfectly well show herself, in
something under five minutes.)</p>
<p>She says How lovely to everything, but pauses in the bathroom, and I
feel convinced that she has a prejudice against the geyser. (It would be
even stronger if she knew as much about this one as I do.) Silence
continues until I become unnerved, and decide that I must offer to take
something off the rent. Just as I am getting ready to say so, C. C.
suddenly utters: to the effect that she would like me to call her
Caroline.</p>
<p>Am surprised, relieved and rather gratified, and at once agree.
Request, moreover, seems to imply that we are to see something of one
another in the future, which I take it means that she is prepared to rent
the flat. Further conversation reveals that this is so, and that she is
to move in next week, on the understanding that I may claim use of
sofa-bed in sitting-room if I wish to do so. C. C. handsomely offers to
let me have the bedroom, and take sofa herself, I say No, No, and we part
with mutual esteem and liking.</p>
<p>Am much relieved, and feel that the least I can do is to write and
thank Mrs. Tressider, to whom the whole thing is owing, but unaccountable
reluctance invades me, and day comes to an end without my having done
so.</p>
<p><i>July 22nd.</i>&mdash;Ring up dear Rose and consult her about
clothes for America. She says at once that she knows the very person. A
young man who will one day be a second Molyneux. I mustn't dream of going
to anybody else. She will send me the address on a postcard. She also
knows of a woman who makes hats, a remedy for seasickness and a new kind
of hair-slide. I say Yes, and Thank you very much, to everything, and
engage to meet Rose for lunch to-morrow at place in Charlotte Street
where she says elliptically that you can eat on the pavement.</p>
<p>Just as I have hung up receiver, telephone bell rings again and I find
myself listening to Mrs. Tressider. She has, she says, left The Boy in
Wales with his father&mdash;(never knew he had one, and am
startled)&mdash;and dashed up on business for one night, but is dashing
back again to-morrow. She just wanted to say how glad she was that
Caroline and I have settled about the flat. She always knew it was the
ideal arrangement for us both.</p>
<p>Experience instant desire to cancel deal with Caroline C. on the spot,
but do not give way to it, and conversation ends harmoniously, with
promise from myself to let Mrs. T. know when and in what ship I am
sailing, as she thinks she may be able to Do Something about it.</p>
<p><i>July 24th.</i>&mdash;Arrival of Robin at Charing Cross, where I go
to meet him and see customary collection of waiting parents, and think
how depressing they all look, and feel certain they think exactly the
same about me. Train is late, as usual, and I talk to pale mother in
beige coat and skirt and agree that the boys all come back looking very
well, and that schools nowadays are quite different, and children really
adore being there. After that she tells me that her Peter hates games and
is no good at lessons, and I say that my Robin has never really settled
down at school at all, and we agree that boys are much more difficult
than girls. (Shall not, however, be surprised, if I find occasion to
reverse this dictum after a few days of dear Vicky's society at
home.)</p>
<p>Train comes in, and parents, including myself, hurry madly up and down
platform amongst shoals of little boys in red caps. Finally discover
Robin, who has grown enormously, and is struggling under immensely heavy
bag.</p>
<p>We get into a taxi, and dash to Poland Street, where Green Line bus
deposits Vicky with suit-case&mdash;handle broken, and it has to be
dragged bulging hat, box, untidy-looking brown-paper parcel, two
books&mdash;<i>Mickey Mouse Annual</i> and <i>David Copperfield,</i>
which I think odd mixture&mdash;and half-eaten packet of milk
chocolate.</p>
<p>She screams and is excited, and says she is hungry, and Robin supports
her with assertion that he is absolutely starving, and we leave luggage
at depot and go and eat ices at establishment in Oxford Street.</p>
<p>Remainder of the day divided between shopping, eating and making as
much use as possible of Underground moving stairway, for which R. and V.
have a passion.</p>
<p><i>July 25th.</i>&mdash;Telephone appeal from Caroline Concannon
saying can she move into Doughty Street flat immediately, as this is the
best day for the van. Am alarmed by the sound of the van, and ask if she
has realised that the flat is furnished already, and there isn't much
room to spare. Yes, she knows all that, and it's only one or two odds and
ends, and if she may come round with a tape-measure, she can soon tell.
Feel that this is reasonable and must be acceded to, and suggest to the
children that they should play quietly with bricks in the bedroom. They
agree to this very readily, and shortly afterwards I hear them playing,
not quietly at all, with a cricket-ball in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Caroline Concannon arrives soon afterwards&mdash;velocity of tiny car,
in relation to its size, quite overwhelming&mdash;and rushes into the
flat. No sign of tape-measure, but the van, she says, will be here
directly. This proves to be only too true, and the van shortly afterwards
appears, and unloads a small black wardrobe, a quantity of
pictures&mdash;some of these very, very modern indeed and experience
fleeting hope that the children will not insist on detailed examination,
but this probably old-fashioned and not to be encouraged&mdash;two
chairs, at least seventeen cushions, little raffia footstool that I do
not care about, plush dog with green eyes that I care about still
less,&mdash;two packing-cases, probably china?&mdash;a purple quilt which
is obviously rolled round a large number of miscellaneous objects, and a
portmanteau that C. C. says is full of books. I ask What about her
clothes, and she says, Oh, those will all come later with the
luggage.</p>
<p>Am rather stunned by this, and take no action at all. C. C. is active
and rushes about, and shortly afterwards Robin and Vicky emerge from the
kitchen and become active too. Small man materialises and staggers up and
down stairs, carrying things, and appeals to me&mdash;as well he
may&mdash;about where they are to go. I say Here, and What about
<i>that</i> corner, as hopefully as possible, and presently find that all
my own belongings are huddled together in the middle of the sitting-room,
like survivors of a wreck clinging to a raft, while all C. C.'s goods and
chattels are lined in rows against the walls.</p>
<p>C. C.&mdash;must remember to call her Caroline&mdash;is apologetic,
and offers rather recklessly to take all her things away again, if I
like, but this is surely purely rhetorical, and I take little notice of
it. At twelve o'clock she suddenly suggests that the children would like
an ice, and rushes them away, and I am left feeling partly relieved at
getting rid of them and partly agitated because it is getting so near
lunch-time.</p>
<p>Make a few tentative efforts about furniture and succeed in clearing a
gangway down the middle of sitting-room&mdash;this a definite
improvement&mdash;but find increasing tendency to move everything that
seems to be occupying too much space, into kitchen. Caroline has
evidently had same inspiration, as I find small armchair there, unknown
to me hitherto, standing on its head, two waste-paper baskets (something
tells me these are likely to be very much used in the near future), large
saucepan, Oriental-looking drapery that might be a bed-spread, and folded
oak table that will not, to my certain knowledge, fit into any single
room when extended.</p>
<p>Telephone bell interrupts me&mdash;just as well, as I am growing
rather agitated&mdash;and Rose's voice enquires if I have done anything
yet about my clothes for America. Well, no, not so far, but I am really
going to see about it in a day or two. Rose is, not unjustifiably,
cynical about this, and says that she will herself make an appointment
for me to-morrow afternoon. Can see no way of getting out of this, as
Felicity Fairmead has offered to take children for the day, so as to set
me free, and therefore can only acquiesce. Unescapable conviction comes
over me that I shan't be able to find a complete set of undergarments
that match, for when I have to be tried on but perhaps this will only
take place at a later stage? Must remember to bear the question in mind
when dealing with laundry, but am aware that I have been defeated on the
point before, and almost certainly shall be again.</p>
<p>Caroline Concannon returns with children, we all go out together and
have inexpensive lunch of fried fish, chipped potatoes and meringues at
adjacent Lyons, after which there seems to be a general feeling that C.
C. is one of ourselves, and both the children address her by her
Christian name.</p>
<p>Am much struck by all of this, and decide that the Modern Girl has
been maligned. Possible material here for interesting little article on
Preconceived Opinions in regard to Unfamiliar Types? Have vague idea of
making a few notes on these lines, but this finally resolves itself into
a list of minor articles required by Robin and Vicky, headed, as usual,
by Tooth-Paste.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Do all schools possess a number of pupils whose parents
are unable or unwilling to supply them with tooth-paste, and are they
accordingly invited to share that of the better-equipped? Can think of no
other explanation for the permanently depleted state of tubes belonging
to Robin and Vicky.)</p>
<p><i>August 15th.</i>&mdash;Holidays rush by, with customary dizzying
speed and extremely unusual number of fine days. We go for
picnics&mdash;sugar is forgotten once, and salt twice&mdash;drive immense
distances in order to bathe for ten minutes in sea which always turns out
cold&mdash;and Robin takes up tennis. Felicity Fairmead comes to stay, is
as popular as ever with children, and more so than ever with Robert as
she has begun to play the piano again, and does so whenever we ask her.
This leads to successful musical evenings, except when I undertake to
sing solo part of "Alouette" and break down rather badly. Make up for
it&mdash;or so I think&mdash;by restrained, but at the same time moving,
interpretation of "In the Gloaming". Felicity, however, says that it
reminds her of her great-grandmother, and Robert enquires if that is
What's-his-name's Funeral March? and I decide to sing no more for the
present.</p>
<p>Caroline Concannon also honours us by week-end visit, and proves
incredibly lively. Am led to ask myself at exactly what stage youth, in
my own case, gave way to middle-age, and become melancholy and
introspective. C. C., however, insists on playing singles with me at
eleven o'clock in the morning, and showers extravagant praise on what she
rightly describes as my <i>one</i> shot, and soon afterwards she suggests
that we should all go in the car to the nearest confectioner's and get
ices. Children are naturally enthusiastic, and I find myself agreeing to
everything, including bathing-picnic in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This leads to complete neglect of household duties hitherto viewed as
unescapable, also to piles of unanswered letters, unmended clothes and
total absence of fresh flowers indoors, but no cataclysmic results ensue,
and am forced to the conclusion that I have possibly exaggerated the
importance of these claims on my time hitherto.</p>
<p>Ask C. C. about the flat and she is airy, and says Oh, she hopes I
won't think it too frightfully untidy&mdash;(am perfectly certain that I
shall)&mdash;and she had a new washer put on the kitchen tap the other
day, which she evidently thinks constitutes conclusive evidence as to her
being solid and reliable tenant. She also adds that there is now a kitten
in Doughty Street, practically next door, and that the chandelier needs
cleaning but can only be done by A Man. Am struck, not for the first
time, by the number of contingencies, most of a purely domestic
character, that can apparently only be dealt with by A Man.</p>
<p><i>August 31st.</i>&mdash;Imperatively worded postcard from Mrs.
Tressider informs me that I am to write instantly to offices of the
Holland-Amerika Line, and book passage in s.s. <i>Rotterdam,</i> sailing
September 30th. If I do this, says postcard, very illegibly indeed, I
shall be privileged to travel with perfectly delightful American, wife of
well-known financier, and great friend of Mrs. T.'s. Details will follow,
but there is not a moment to be lost. Am infected by this spirit of
urgency, write madly to the Holland-Amerika Line, and then
wonder&mdash;too late&mdash;whether I really want to thrust my
companionship on perfectly delightful unknown American and&mdash;still
more&mdash;whether she will see any reason to thank me for having done
so. Letter, however, arrives from shipping offices, enclosing enormous
plan, entirely unintelligible to me, over which Robert spends a good deal
of time with his spectacles on, and quantities of information from which
I extract tonnage of ship&mdash;which leaves me cold&mdash;and price of
single fare, which is less than I expected, and reassures me. Robert says
that he supposes this will do as well as anything else&mdash;not at all
enthusiastically&mdash;and Vicky quite irrationally says that I
<i>must</i> go in that ship and no other. (Disquieting thought: Will
Vicky grow up into a second Mrs. T.? Should not be in the very least
surprised if she did.)</p>
<p>Second postcard from Mrs. T. arrives: She has seen her American
friend&mdash;(How?)&mdash;and the friend is absolutely delighted at the
idea of travelling with me, and will do everything she can to help me.
Idle impulse assails me to write back on another postcard and say that it
would really help me more than anything if she would pay my passage for
me&mdash;but this, naturally, dismissed at once. Further inspection of
postcard, which is extensively blotted, reveals something written in
extreme right-hand corner, of which I am unable to make out a word.
Robert is appealed to, and says that he thinks it has something to do
with luggage, but am quite unable to subscribe to this, and refer to Our
Vicar's Wife, who has called in about morris-dancing. She says Yes, yes,
where are her glasses, and takes a good many things out of her bag and
puts them all back again and finally discovers glasses in a little case
in her bicycle basket, and studies postcard from a distance of at least a
yard away.</p>
<p>Result of it all is that It Might be Anything, and Our Vicar's Wife
always has said, and always will say, that plain sewing is a great deal
more important than all this higher education. As for Our Vicar, says Our
Vicar's Wife, he makes an absolute point of seeing that the Infant School
is taught its multiplication-table in the good old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>We all agree that this is indeed essential, and conversation drifts
off to Harvest Festival, drought in Cheshire&mdash;Our Vicar's married
sister in despair about her french beans&mdash;tennis at Wimbledon, and
increasing rarity of the buzzard-hawk.</p>
<p>Hours later, Robin picks up Mrs. T.'s postcard, and reads the whole of
it from end to end, including postscript, to the effect that I must be
prepared to pay duty on every single thing I take to America, especially
anything new in the way of clothes. Am so much impressed by dear Robin's
skill that I quite forget to point out utter undesirability of reading
postcards addressed to other people till long after he has gone to
bed.</p>
<p>Am much disturbed at the idea of paying duty on all my clothes, and
lie awake for some time wondering if I can possibly evade obligations
already incurred towards Rose's friend&mdash;the coming
Molyneux&mdash;but decide that this cannot honourably be done.</p>
<p><i>Sept. 1st.</i>&mdash;Call upon aged neighbour, Mrs. Blenkinsop, to
meet married daughter Barbara Carruthers, newly returned from India with
baby. Find large party assembled, eight females and one very young
man&mdash;said to be nephew of local doctor&mdash;who never speaks at all
but hands tea about very politely and offers me dish containing
swiss-roll no less than five times.</p>
<p>Barbara proves to have altered little, is eloquent about India, and
talks a good deal about <i>tiffin,</i> also Hot Weather and Going up to
the Hills. We are all impressed, and enquire after husband. He is, says
Barbara, well, but he works too hard. Far too hard. She thinks that he
will kill himself, and is always telling him so.</p>
<p>Temporary gloom cast by the thought of Crosbie Carruthers killing
himself is dissipated by the baby, who crawls about on the floor, and is
said to be like his father. At this, however, old Mrs. Blenkinsop
suddenly rebels, and announces that dear Baby is the image of herself as
a tiny, and demands the immediate production of her portrait at four
years old to prove her words. Portrait is produced, turns out to be a
silhouette, showing pitch-black little profile with ringlets and
necklace, on white background, and we all say Yes, we quite see what she
means.</p>
<p>Baby very soon afterwards begins to cry&mdash;can this be cause and
effect?&mdash;and is taken away by Barbara.</p>
<p>Mrs. B. tells us that it is a great joy to have them with her, she has
given up the whole of the top floor to them, and it means engaging an
extra girl, and of course dear Baby's routine has to come before
everything, so that her little house is upside-down&mdash;but that, after
all, is nothing. She is old, her life is over, nothing now matters to
her, except the welfare and happiness of her loved ones.</p>
<p>Everybody rather dejected at these sentiments, and I seek to make a
diversion by referring to approaching departure for America.</p>
<p>Several pieces of information are then offered to me:</p>
<p>The Americans are very hospitable.</p>
<p>The Americans are so hospitable that they work one to death. (Analogy
here with Barbara's husband?)</p>
<p>The Americans like the English.</p>
<p>The Americans do not like the English at all.</p>
<p>It is not safe to go out anywhere in Chicago without a revolver. (To
this I might well reply that, so far as I am concerned, it would be even
less safe to go out with one.)</p>
<p>Whatever happens I must visit Hollywood, eat waffles, see a baseball
match, lunch at a Women's Club, go up to the top of the Woolworth
Building, and get invited to the house of a millionaire so as to see what
it's like.</p>
<p>All alcohol in America is wood-alcohol and if I touch it I shall die,
or become blind or go raving mad.</p>
<p>It is quite impossible to refuse to drink alcohol in America, because
the Americans are so hospitable.</p>
<p>Decide after this to go home, and consult Robert as to advisability of
cancelling proposed visit to America altogether.</p>
<p><i>Sept. 7th.</i>&mdash;Instructions from America reach me to the
effect that I am to stay at Essex House, in New York. Why Essex? Should
much have preferred distinctive American name, such as Alabama or
Connecticut House. Am consoled by enclosure, which gives photograph of
superb skyscraper, and informs me that, if I choose, I shall be able to
dine in the Persian Coffee Shop, under the direction of a French chef,
graduate of the Escoffier School.</p>
<p>The English Molyneux sends home my clothes in instalments, am
delighted with flowered red silk which is&mdash;I hope&mdash;to give me
self-confidence in mounting any platform on which I may have the
misfortune to find myself&mdash;also evening dress, more or less devoid
of back, in very attractive pale brocade. Show red silk to Our Vicar's
Wife, who says Marvellous, dear, but do not produce backless evening
frock.</p>
<p><i>Sept. 20th.</i>&mdash;Letter arrives from complete
stranger&mdash;signature seems to be Ella B. Chickhyde, which I think
odd&mdash;informing me that she is so disappointed that the sailing of
the <i>Rotterdam</i> has been cancelled, and we must sail instead by the
<i>Statendam,</i> on October 7th, unless we like to make a dash for the
<i>previous</i> boat, which means going on board the day after to-morrow,
and will I be so kind as to telegraph? Am thrown into confusion by the
whole thing, and feel that Robert will think it is all my
fault&mdash;which he does, and says that Women Never Stick to Anything
for Five Minutes Together&mdash;which is wholly unjust, but makes me feel
guilty all the same. He also clears up identity of Ella B. Chickhyde, by
saying that she must be the friend of that woman who came in a car on her
way to Wales, and talked. This at once recalls Mrs. Tressider, and I
telegraph to Ella B. Chickhyde to say that I hope to sail on the
<i>Statendam.</i></p>
<p>Last day of the holidays then takes its usual course. I pack
frantically in the intervals of reading <i>Vice Versa</i> aloud, playing
Corinthian Bagatelle, sanctioning an expedition to the village to buy
sweets, and helping Vicky over her holiday task, about which she has
suddenly become acutely anxious, after weeks of brassy indifference.</p>
<p><i>Sept. 21st.</i>&mdash;Take children to London, and general
dispersal ensues. Vicky drops large glass bottle of sweets on platform at
Waterloo, with resultant breakage, amiable porter rushes up and tells her
not to cry, as he can arrange it all. This he does by laboriously
separating broken glass from sweets, with coal-black hands, and placing
salvage in a piece of newspaper. Present him with a florin, and am not
sufficiently strong-minded to prevent Vicky from going off with newspaper
parcel bulging in coat pocket.</p>
<p>Robin and I proceed to Charing Cross&mdash;he breaks lengthy silence
by saying that to <i>him</i> it only seems one second ago that I was
meeting him here, instead of seeing him off&mdash;and this moves me so
much that I am quite unable to answer, and we walk down Platform
Six&mdash;Special School-train&mdash;without exchanging a syllable. The
place is, as usual, crowded with parents and boys, including minute
creature who can scarcely be seen under grey wide-awake hat, and who I
suggest must be a new boy. Robin, however, says Oh no, that's
<i>quite</i> an old boy, and seems slightly amused.</p>
<p>Parting, thanks to this blunder on my part, is slightly less painful
than usual, and I immediately go and have my hair washed and set, in
order to distract my thoughts, before proceeding to Doughty Street.
Caroline awaits me there, together with lavish display of flowers that
she has arranged in my honour, which touches me, and entirely compensates
for strange disorder that prevails all over flat. Moreover, C. C.
extraordinarily sweet-tempered and acquiesces with apologies when I
suggest the removal of tiny green hat, two glass vases and a saucepan,
from the bathroom.</p>
<p><i>Sept. 25th.</i>&mdash;Attend dinner-party of most distinguished
people, given by celebrated young publisher connected with New York
house. Evening is preceded by prolonged mental conflict on my part,
concerning&mdash;as usual&mdash;clothes. Caroline C. urges me to put on
new backless garment, destined for America, but superstitious feeling
that this may be unlucky assails me, and I hover frantically between very
old blue and comparatively new black-and-white stripes. Caroline is
sympathetic throughout, but at seven o'clock suddenly screams that she is
due at a sherry party and must rush, she'd forgotten all about it.</p>
<p>(Extraordinary difference between this generation and my own impresses
me immensely. Should never, at C. C.'s age&mdash;or probably any
other&mdash;have forgotten even a tea-party, let alone a sherry one. This
no time, however, for indulging in philosophical retrospective
studies.)</p>
<p>Baby Austin, as usual, is at the door; C. C. leaps into it and
vanishes, at terrific pace, into Guilford Street, leaving me to get into
black-and-white stripes, discover that black evening shoes have been left
at home, remember with relief that grey brocade ones are here and
available, and grey silk stockings that have to be mended, but
fortunately above the knee. Result of it all is that I am late, which I
try to feel is modern, but really only consider bad-mannered.</p>
<p>Party is assembled when I arrive, am delighted to see Distinguished
Artist, well known to me in Hampstead days, whom I at once perceive to
have been celebrating the occasion almost before it has begun&mdash;also
famous man of letters next whom I am allowed to sit at dinner, and actor
with Whom I have&mdash;in common with about ninety-nine per cent of the
feminine population&mdash;been in love for years. (This state of affairs
made much worse long before the end of the evening.)</p>
<p>Party is successful from start to finish, everybody wishes me a
pleasant trip to America, I am profoundly touched and feel rather
inclined to burst into tears&mdash;hope this has nothing to do with the
champagne&mdash;but fortunately remember in time that a' scarlet nose and
patchy face can be becoming to no one. (Marked discrepancy here between
convention so prevalent in fiction, and state of affairs common to
everyday life.)</p>
<p>Am escorted home at one o'clock by Distinguished Artist and
extraordinarily pretty girl called Dinah; and retire to sofa-bed in
sitting-room, taking every precaution not to wake Caroline C., innocently
slumbering in bedroom.</p>
<p>Just as I have dropped asleep, hall-door bangs, and I hear feet
rushing up the stairs, and wonder if it can be burglars, but decide that
only very amateurish ones, with whom I could probably deal, would make so
much noise. Point is settled by sudden appearance of light under bedroom
door, and stifled, but merry rendering of "Stormy Weather" which
indicates that C. C. has this moment returned from belated revels no
doubt connected with sherry party. Am impressed by this fresh evidence of
the gay life lived by the young to-day, and go to sleep again.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 1st.</i>&mdash;Return home yesterday coincides with strong
tendency to feel that I can't possibly go to America at all, and that
most likely I shall never come back alive if I do, and anyway everything
here will go to rack and ruin without me. Say something of these
premonitions to Robert, who replies that <i>(a)</i> It would be great
waste of money to cancel my passage now&mdash;<i>(b)</i> I shall be quite
all right if I remember to look where I'm going when I cross the
streets&mdash;and <i>(c)</i> he dares say Cook and Florence will manage
very well. I ask wildly if he will cable to me if anything goes wrong
with the children, and he says Certainly and enquires what arrangements I
have made about the servants' wages? Remainder of the evening passes in
domestic discussion, interrupted by telephone call from Robert's brother
William, who says that he wishes to see me off at Southampton. Am much
gratified by this, and think it tactful not to enquire why dear William's
wife Angela has not associated herself with the scheme.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 7th.</i>&mdash;Long and agitating day, of which the close
finds me on board s.s. <i>Statendam,</i> but cannot yet feel wholly
certain how this result has been achieved, owing to confusion of mind
consequent on packing, unpacking&mdash;for purpose of retrieving
clothes-brush and cheque-book, accidentally put in twenty-four hours too
early&mdash;consulting numbers of Lists and Notes, and conveying self and
luggage&mdash;six pieces all told, which I think moderate&mdash;to
boat-train at Waterloo.</p>
<p>Caroline Concannon has handsomely offered to go with me to
Southampton, and I have accepted, and Felicity Fairmead puts in
unexpected and gratifying appearance at Waterloo. I say, Isn't she
astonished to find me travelling first-class? and she replies No, not in
the least, which surprises me a good deal, but decide that it's a
compliment in its way.</p>
<p>Caroline C. and I have carriage to ourselves, but label on window
announces that H. Press is to occupy Corner Seat, window side, facing
engine. We decide that H. P. is evidently fussy, probably very old,
and&mdash;says Caroline with an air of authority&mdash;most likely an
invalid. The least we can do, she says, is to put all hand-luggage up on
the rack and leave one side of carriage entirely free, so that he can put
his feet up. Felicity says, Suppose he is lifted in on a wheel-chair? but
this we disregard, as being mere conjecture. All, however, is wasted, as
H. Press fails to materialise, and train, to unbounded concern of us all
three, goes off without him.</p>
<p>Robert and William meet us at Southampton, having motored from
Devonshire and Wiltshire respectively, and take us on board tender, where
we all sit in a draught, on very hard seats. Robert shows me letters he
has brought me from home&mdash;one from Our Vicar's Wife, full of good
wishes very kindly expressed, and will I, if absolutely convenient, send
photograph of Falls of Niagara, so helpful in talking to school-children
about wonders of Nature&mdash;the rest mostly bills. I tell Robert madly
that I shall pay them all from America&mdash;which I know very well that
I shan't&mdash;and we exchange comments, generally unfavourable, about
fellow-passengers. Tender gets off at last&mdash;draught more pervasive
than ever. Small steamers rise up at intervals, and Caroline says
excitedly: There she is! to each of them. Enormous ship with four funnels
comes into view, and I say: There she is! but am, as usual, wrong, and
<i>Statendam</i> only reached hours later, when we are all overawed by
her size, except Robert.</p>
<p>On board Robert takes charge of everything&mdash;just as well, as I am
completely dazed&mdash;conducts us to Cabin 89, miraculously produces my
luggage, tells me to have dinner and unpack the moment the tender goes
off&mdash;(this advice surely strikes rather sinister note?)&mdash;and
shows me where dining-saloon is, just as though he'd been there every day
for years.</p>
<p>He then returns me to cabin, where William is quietly telling Caroline
the story of his life, rings for steward and commands him to bring a
bottle of champagne, and my health is drunk.</p>
<p>Am touched and impressed, and wonder wildly if it would be of any use
to beg Robert to change all his plans and come with me to America after
all? Unable to put this to the test, as bell rings loudly and
dramatically, tender is said to be just off, and farewells become
imminent. Robert, William and Caroline are urged by various officials to
Mind their Heads, please, and Step this way&mdash;I exchange frantic
farewells with all three, feel certain that I shall never see any of them
again, and am left in floods of tears in what seems for the moment to be
complete and utter solitude, but afterwards turns out to be large crowd
of complete strangers, stewards in white jackets and colossal palms in
pots.</p>
<p>Can see nothing for it but to follow Robert's advice and go to
dining-saloon, which I do, and find myself seated next to large and
elderly American lady who works her way steadily through eight-course
dinner and tells me that she is on a very strict diet. She also says that
her cabin is a perfectly terrible one, and she knew the moment she set
foot on the ship that she was going to dislike everything on board. She
is, she says, like that. She always knows within the first two minutes
whether she is going to like or dislike her surroundings. Am I, she
enquires, the same? Should like to reply that it never takes me more than
one minute to know exactly what I feel, not only about my surroundings,
but about those with whom I have to share them. However, she waits for no
answer, so this <i>mot</i>, as so many others, remains unuttered.</p>
<p>Friend of Mrs. Tressider, whom I have forgotten all about, comes up
half-way through dinner, introduces herself as Ella
Wheelwright&mdash;Chickhyde evidently a mistake&mdash;and seems nice. She
introduces married sister and husband, from Chicago, and tells me that
literary American, who says he has met me in London, is also on board.
Would I like to sit at their table for meals? I am, however, to be
perfectly honest about this. Am perfectly honest and say Yes, I should,
but wonder vaguely what would happen if perfect honesty had compelled me
to say No?</p>
<p>Elderly American lady seems faintly hurt at prospect of my desertion,
and says resentfully how nice it is for me to have found friends, and
would I like to come and look at her cabin? Question of perfect honesty
not having here been raised, I do so, and can see nothing wrong with it
whatever. Just as I am leaving it-which I do as soon as civility
permits&mdash;see that name on door is H. Press. Must remember to send
Felicity and Caroline postcards about this.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 9th.</i>&mdash;Interior of my own cabin becomes extremely
familiar, owing to rough weather and consequent collapse. Feel that I
shall probably not live to see America, let alone England again.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 11th.</i>&mdash;Emerge gradually from very, very painful state
of affairs. New remedy for sea-sickness provided by Rose may or may not
be responsible for my being still alive, but that is definitely the
utmost that can be said for it.</p>
<p>Remain flat on my back, and wish that I could either read or go to
sleep, but both equally impossible. Try to recall poetry, by way of
passing the time, and find myself involved in melancholy quotations:
<i>Sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things</i> alternating
with <i>A few more years shall roll.</i> Look at snapshots of Robert and
the children, but this also a failure, as I begin to cry and wonder why I
ever left them. Have died and been buried at sea several times before
evening and&mdash;alternatively&mdash;have heard of fatal accident to
Robin, dangerous illness of Vicky, and suicide of Robert, all owing to my
desertion. Endless day closes in profound gloom and renewed nausea.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 12th.</i>&mdash;Situation improved, I get up and sit on deck,
eat raw apple for lunch, and begin to feel that I may, after all, live to
see America. Devote a good deal of thought, and still more admiration, to
Christopher Columbus who doubtless performed similar transit to mine,
under infinitely more trying conditions.</p>
<p>Ella Wheelwright comes and speaks to me&mdash;she looks blooming in
almond-green dress with cape, very smart&mdash;and is compassionate. We
talk about Mrs. Tressider&mdash;a sweet thing, says Ella W., and I
immediately acquiesce, though description not in the least applicable to
my way of thinking&mdash;and agree that The Boy does not look strong.
(Perceive that this is apparently the only comment that ever occurs to
anybody in connection with The Boy, and wonder if he is destined to go
through life with this negative reputation and no other.)</p>
<p>Just as I think it must be tea-time, discover that all ship clocks
differ from my watch, and am informed by deck steward that The Time Goes
Back an Hour every night. Pretend that I knew this all along, and had
merely forgotten it, but am in reality astonished, and wish that Robert
was here to explain.</p>
<p>Day crawls by slowly, but not too unpleasantly, and is enlivened by
literary American, met once before in London, who tells me all about
English authors in New York, and gives me to understand that if popular,
they get invited to cocktail parties two or three times daily, and if
unpopular, are obliged to leave the country.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 14th.</i>&mdash;America achieved. Statue of Liberty, admirably
lit up, greets me at about seven o'clock this evening, entrance to
harbour is incredibly beautiful, and skyscrapers prove to be just as
impressive as their reputation, and much more decorative.</p>
<p>Just as I am admiring everything from top deck two unknown young women
suddenly materialise&mdash;(risen from the ocean, like Venus?)&mdash;also
young man with camera, and I am approached and asked if I will at once
give my views on The United States, the American Woman and Modern
American Novels. Young man says that he wishes to take my photograph,
which makes me feel like a film star&mdash;appearance, unfortunately,
does nothing to support this illusion&mdash;and this is duly
accomplished, whilst I stand in <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> attitude,
half-way down companion-ladder on which I have never before set foot
throughout the voyage.</p>
<p>Exchange farewells with fellow-passengers&mdash;literary American, now
known to me as Arthur, is kindness itself and invites me on behalf of his
family to come and visit them in Chicago, and see World Fair&mdash;Ella
Wheelwright also kind, and gives me her card, but obviously much
preoccupied with question of Customs&mdash;as well she may be, as she
informs me that she has declared two hundred dollars' worth of purchases
made in Europe, and has another five hundred dollars' worth
undeclared.</p>
<p>American publisher has come to meet me and is on the Dock, I am
delighted to see him, and we sit on a bench for about two hours,
surrounded by luggage, none of which seems to be mine Eventually,
however, it appears&mdash;which slightly surprises me&mdash;publisher
supports me through Customs inspection, and finally escorts me personally
to Essex House, where I am rung up five times before an hour has elapsed,
with hospitable greetings and invitations. (Nothing from Ella
Wheelwright, and cannot help wondering if she has perhaps been
arrested?)</p>
<p>Am much impressed by all of it, including marvellous view from bedroom
on sixteenth story, but still unable to contemplate photographs of
children with complete calm.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 16th.</i>&mdash;Come to the conclusion that everything I have
ever heard or read about American Hospitality is an understatement.
Telephone bell rings incessantly from nine o'clock onwards, invitations
pour in, and complete strangers ring up to say that they liked my book,
and would be glad to give a party for me at any hour of the day or night.
Am plunged by all this into a state of bewilderment, but feel definitely
that it will be a satisfaction to let a number of people at home hear
about it all, and realise estimation in which professional writers are
held in America.</p>
<p>(Second thought obtrudes itself here, to the effect that, if I know
anything of my neighbours, they will receive any such information with
perfect calm and probably say Yes, they've always heard that Americans
were Like That.)</p>
<p>Am interviewed by reporters on five different occasions&mdash;one
young gentleman evidently very tired, and droops on a sofa without saying
much, which paralyses me, and results in long stretches of deathly
silence. Finally he utters, to the effect that John Drinkwater was
difficult to interview. Experience forlorn gleam of gratification at
being bracketed with so distinguished a writer, but this instantly
extinguished, as reporter adds that in the end J. D. talked for one hour
and fifteen minutes. Am quite unable to emulate this achievement, and
interview ends in gloom. Representative of an evening paper immediately
appears, but is a great improvement on his colleague, and restores me to
equanimity.</p>
<p>Three women reporters follow&mdash;am much struck by the fact that
they are all good-looking and dress nicely&mdash;they all ask me what I
think of the American Woman, whether I read James Branch
Cabell&mdash;which I don't&mdash;and what I feel about the Problem of the
Leisured Woman. Answer them all as eloquently as possible, and make
mental note to the effect that I have evidently never taken the subject
of Women seriously enough, the only problem about them in England being
why there are so many.</p>
<p>Lunch with distinguished publisher and his highly decorative wife and
two little boys. Am not in the least surprised to find that they live in
a flat with black-velvet sofas, concealed lighting, and three diagonal
glass tables for sole furniture. It turns out, however, that this is
<i>not</i> a typical American home, and that they find it nearly as
remarkable as I do myself. We have lunch, the two little boys behave like
angels&mdash;reputation of American children' evidently libellous, and
must remember to say so when I get home&mdash;and we talk about interior
decoration dining-room has different-coloured paint on each one of its
four walls&mdash;books and sea voyages. Elder of the two little boys
suddenly breaks into this and remarks that he just loves English
sausages&mdash;oh boy!&mdash;which I accept as a compliment to myself,
and he then relapses into silence. Am much impressed by this display of
social competence, and feel doubtful whether Robin or Vicky could ever
have equalled it.</p>
<p>Afternoon is spent, once more, in interviews, and am taken out to
supper-party by Ella Wheelwright, who again appears in clothes that I
have never seen before. At supper I sit next elderly gentleman wearing
collar exactly like Mr. Gladstone's. He is slightly morose, tells me that
times are not at all what they were&mdash;which I know already&mdash;and
that there is No Society left in New York. This seems to me uncivil, as
well as ungrateful, and I decline to assent. Elderly Gentleman is,
however, entirely indifferent as to whether I agree with him or not, and
merely goes on to say that no club would dream of admitting Jews to its
membership. (This, if true, reflects no credit on clubs.) It also appears
that, in his own house, cocktails, wireless, gramophones and modern young
people are&mdash;like Jews&mdash;never admitted. Should like to think of
something really startling to reply to all this, but he would almost
certainly take no notice, even if I did, and I content myself with saying
that that is Very Interesting&mdash;which is not, unfortunately,
altogether true.</p>
<p>Ella Wheelwright offers to drive me home, which she does with great
competence, though once shouted at by a policeman who tells her: Put your
lights on, sister!</p>
<p>Ella is kind, and asks me to tell her all about my home, but follows
this up by immediately telling me all about hers instead. She also
invites me to two luncheons, one tea, and to spend Sunday with her on
Long Island.</p>
<p>Return to my room, which is now becoming familiar, and write long
letter to Robert, which makes me feel homesick all over again.</p>
<p><i>October 17th.</i>&mdash;Conference at publisher's office concerning
my future movements, in which I take passive, rather than active part.
Head of well-known lecture agency is present, and tells me about several
excellent speaking-engagements that he might have got for me if:
<i>(a)</i> He had had longer notice, <i>(b)</i> All the Clubs in America
hadn't been affected by the depression, and <i>(c)</i> I could arrange to
postpone my sailing for another three months.</p>
<p>Since <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> cannot now be remedied, and I entirely
refuse to consider <i>(c),</i> deadlock appears to have been reached, but
agent suddenly relents and admits that he <i>can,</i> by dint of
superhuman exertions, get me one or two bookings in various places that
none of them seem to be less than eighteen hours' journey apart. I agree
to everything, only stipulating for Chicago where I wish to visit
literary friend Arthur and his family, and to inspect the World Fair.</p>
<p>Social whirl, to which I am by now becoming accustomed, follows, and I
am put into the hands of extraordinarily kind and competent guardian
angel, picturesquely named Ramona Herdman. She takes me to the Vanderbilt
Hotel for so-called tea, which consists of very strong cocktails and
interesting sandwiches. I meet Miss Isabel Paterson, famous literary
critic, by whom I am completely fascinated, but also awe-stricken in the
extreme, as she has terrific reputation and is alarmingly clever in
conversation.</p>
<p>She demolishes one or two English novelists, in whose success I have
always hitherto believed implicitly, but is kind about my own literary
efforts, and goes so far as to hope that we shall meet again. I tell her
that I am going to Chicago and other places, and may be lecturing, and
she looks at the floor and says, Yes, Clubwomen, large women with
marcelled hair, wearing reception gowns.</p>
<p>Am appalled by this thumbnail sketch, and seriously contemplate
cancelling tour altogether.</p>
<p>Ella Wheelwright joins us. She now has on a black ensemble, and hair
done in quite a new way&mdash;and we talk about books. I say that I have
enjoyed nothing so much as <i>Flush,</i> but Miss Paterson again
disconcerts me by muttering that to write a whole book about a dog is
Simply Morbid.</p>
<p>Am eventually taken to Essex House by Ella W., who asks, very kindly,
if there is anything she can do for me. Yes, there is. She can tell me
where I can go to get my hair shampooed and set, and whether it will be
much more expensive than it is at home. In reply, Ella tells me that her
own hair waves naturally. It doesn't curl&mdash;that isn't what she means
at all but it just waves. In damp weather, it just goes into natural
waves. It always has done this, ever since she was a child. But she has
it set once a month, because it looks nicer. Hairdresser always tells her
that it's lovely hair to do anything with, because the wave is really
natural.</p>
<p>She then says Good-night and leaves me, and I decide to have my own
inferior hair, which does <i>not</i> wave naturally, washed and set in
the Hotel Beauty-parlour.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 23rd.</i>&mdash;Extraordinary week-end with Ella Wheelwright
on Long Island, at superb country-house which she refers to as her
cottage. She drives me out from New York very kindly, but should enjoy it
a great deal more if she would look in front of her, instead of at me,
whilst negotiating colossal and unceasing stream of traffic. This, she
says gaily, is what she has been looking forward to&mdash;a really
undisturbed <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> in which to hear all
about my reactions to America and the American Woman. I say, What about
the American Man? but this not a success, Ella evidently feeling that
reactions, if any, on this subject are of no importance whatever to
anybody.</p>
<p>She then tells me that she spent a month last year in London, staying
at the Savoy, and gives me her opinion of England, which is, on the
whole, favourable. I say at intervals that I see what she means, and
utter other non-committal phrases whenever it occurs to me that if I
don't say something she will guess that I am not really listening.</p>
<p>We gradually leave New York behind and creep into comparative
country&mdash;bright golden trees, excite my admiration, together with
occasional scarlet ones&mdash;Ella still talking&mdash;have not the least
idea what about, but continue to ejaculate from time to time. Presently
country mansion is reached, three large cars already standing in front of
door, and I suggest that other visitors have arrived. But Ella says Oh
no, one is her <i>other</i> car, and the remaining two belong to Charlie.
Decide that Charlie must be her husband, and wonder whether she has any
children, but none have ever been mentioned, and do not like to ask.</p>
<p>House is attractive&mdash;furniture and decorations very
elaborate&mdash;am particularly struck by enormous pile of amber beads
coiled carelessly on one corner of old oak refectory table, just where
they catch the light&mdash;and I am taken up winding staircase, carpeted
in rose colour.</p>
<p>(Evidently no children, or else they use a separate staircase.)</p>
<p>Ella's bedroom perfectly marvellous. Terrific expanse of
looking-glass, and sofa has eighteen pillows, each one different shade of
purple. Should like to count number of jars and bottles&mdash;all with
mauve enamel tops&mdash;in bathroom, but this would take far too long,
and feel it necessary, moreover, to concentrate on personal appearance,
very far from satisfactory. Am aware that I cannot hope to compete with
Ella, who is looking wonderful in white wool outfit obviously made for
her in Paris, but make what efforts I can with powder and lipstick, try
to forget that I am wearing my Blue, which never has suited me and
utterly refuses to wear out. Decide to take off my hat, but am
dissatisfied with my hair when I have done so, and put it on again and go
downstairs. Complete house-party is then revealed to me, sitting on silk
cushions outside French windows, the whole thing being entirely
reminiscent of illustrations to society story in American magazine. I am
introduced, everyone is very polite, and complete silence envelops the
entire party.</p>
<p>Young man in white sweater at last rises to the occasion and asks me
what I think of <i>Anthony Adverse.</i> Am obliged to reply that I
haven't read it, which gets us no further. I then admire the trees, which
are beautiful, and everybody looks relieved and admires them too, and
silence again ensues.</p>
<p>Ella, with great presence of mind, says that it is time for cocktails,
these are brought, and I obediently drink mine and wonder what Our
Vicar's Wife would say if she could see me now. This leads, by natural
transition, to thoughts of television, and I ask my neighbour&mdash;grey
flannels and flaming red hair&mdash;whether he thinks that this will ever
become part of everyday life. He looks surprised&mdash;as well he
may&mdash;but replies civilly that he doubts it very much. This he
follows up by enquiring whether I have yet read <i>Anthony
Adverse.</i></p>
<p>Charlie materialises&mdash;imagine him to be Ella's husband, but am
never actually told so&mdash;and we all go in to lunch, which is
excellent.</p>
<p>(Standard of American cooking very, very high indeed. Reflect
sentimentally that Robert is, in all probability, only having roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding, then remember difference in time between here and
England, and realise that beef and Yorkshire pudding are either in the
past or the future, although cannot be quite sure which.)</p>
<p>Tennis is suggested for the afternoon, and Ella tells me that she can
easily find me a pair of shoes. As I am far from sharing this
confidence&mdash;every other woman in the room looks like size 5, whereas
I take 6&frac12;&mdash;and think my Blue very ill-adapted to the
tennis-court, I say that I would rather look on, and this I do. They all
play extremely well, and look incredibly handsome, well dressed, and
athletic. I decide, not for the first time, that Americans are a great
deal more decorative than Europeans.</p>
<p>Just as inferiority complex threatens to overwhelm me altogether, I am
joined by Ella, who says that she is taking me to a tea-party.
Tea-parties are A Feature of Life on Long Island, and it is essential,
says Ella, that I should attend one.</p>
<p>Everybody else turns out to be coming also, a complete platoon of cars
is marshalled and we drive off, about two people to every car, and cover
total distance of rather less than five hundred yards.</p>
<p>Am by this time becoming accustomed to American version of a
tea-party, and encounter cocktails and sandwiches with equanimity, but am
much struck by scale on which the entertainment is conducted; large room
being entirely filled by people, including young gentleman who is playing
the piano violently and has extremely pretty girl on either side of him,
each with an arm round his waist.</p>
<p>It now becomes necessary to screech at really terrific pitch, and this
everyone does. Cannot feel that <i>Anthony Adverse</i> motif, which still
recurs, has gained by this, nor do my own replies to questions concerning
the length of my stay, my reactions to America, and opinion of the
American Woman. Ella, who has heroically introduced everybody within
sight, smiles and waves at me encouragingly, but is now too firmly wedged
in to move, and I sit on a sofa, next to slim woman in scarlet, and she
screams into my ear, and tells me that she is a Southerner, and really
lives in the South.</p>
<p>Am obliged to give up all hope of hearing everything she says, but can
catch quite a lot of it, and am interested. She was, she tells me, the
mascot of the baseball team at her College. Whenever a match took place,
she was carried on to the field by two members of the team. (Frightful
vision assails me of similar extravagance taking place on village
football ground at home, and results, especially as to mud and bruises,
that would certainly ensue.) On one occasion, yells my neighbour, the
opposing team objected to her presence&mdash;(am not surprised) but her
Boys held firm. Either, said her Boys, they had their mascot on the
field, or else the whole match must be called off.</p>
<p>Cannot, unfortunately, hear the end of the story, but feel certain
that it was favourable to the mascot and her Boys. Experience temporary
difficulty in thinking out reasonably polite answer to such a singular
statement, and finally say that it must have been rather fun, which is
weak, and totally untrue, at least as far as the teams were
concerned&mdash;but as all is lost in surrounding noise, it matters
little. People walk in and out, and scream at one another&mdash;should be
interested to identify my host and hostess, but see no hope of this
whatever. Ella presently works her way up to me and makes signs that she
is ready to leave, and we struggle slowly into the air again.</p>
<p>Remaining members of Ella's house-party, whom I am now rather disposed
to cling to, as being old and familiar friends, all gradually reassemble,
and we return to Ella's house, where I discover that recent vocal efforts
have made my throat extremely sore.</p>
<p><i>October 25th.</i>&mdash;English mail awaits me on return to New
York Hotel and is handed to me by reception-clerk with agreeable comment
to the effect that the Old Country hasn't forgotten me <i>this</i> time.
Feel that I can't possibly wait to read mail till I get upstairs, but
equally impossible to do so in entrance-hall, and am prepared to make a
rush for the elevator when firm-looking elderly woman in black comes up
and addresses me by name. Says that she is very glad indeed to know me.
Her name is Katherine Ellen Blatt, which may not mean anything to me, but
stands for quite a lot to a section of the American public.</p>
<p>I try to look intelligent, and wonder whether to ask for further
details or not, but something tells me that I am going to hear them
anyway, so may as well make up my mind to it. Invite Miss Blatt to sit
down and wait for me one moment whilst I go up and take off my
hat&mdash;by which I really mean tear open letters from Robert and the
children&mdash;but she says, No, she'd just love to come right upstairs
with me. This she proceeds to do, and tells me on the way up that she
writes articles for the women's magazines and that she makes quite a
feature of describing English visitors to America, especially those with
literary interests. The moment she heard that I was in New York she felt
that she just had to come around right away and have a look at me (idea
crosses my mind of replying that A Cat may look at a King, but this
colloquialism probably unappreciated, and in any case Miss B. gives me no
time).</p>
<p>Bed still unmade, which annoys me, especially as Miss B. scrutinises
entire room through a pince-nez and asks, What made me come here, as this
is a place entirely frequented by professional people? She herself could,
if I wish it, arrange to have me transferred immediately to a women's
club, where there is a lovely group of highly intelligent cultivated
women, to which she is proud to say that she belongs. Can only hope that
my face doesn't reflect acute horror that invades me at the idea of
joining any group of women amongst whom is to be numbered Miss Blatt.</p>
<p>Incredibly tedious half-hour ensues. Miss B. has a great deal to say,
and fortunately seems to expect very little answer, as my mind is
entirely fixed on letters lying unopened in my handbag. She tells me,
amongst other things, that Noel Coward, Somerset Maugham&mdash;whom she
calls "Willie", which I think profane&mdash;the Duchess of Atholl, Sir
Gerald du Maurier and Miss Amy Johnson are all very dear friends of hers,
and she would never dream of letting a year pass without going to England
and paying each of them a visit. I say rather curtly that I don't know
any of them, and add that I don't really feel I ought to take up any more
of Miss Blatt's time. That, declares Miss Blatt, doesn't matter at all.
I'm not to let that worry me for a moment. To hear about dear old London
is just everything to her, and she is just crazy to be told whether I
know her close friends, Ellen Wilkinson, Nancy Astor and Ramsay
MacDonald. Frantic impulse assails me and I say, No, but that the Prince
of Wales is a great friend of mine. Is that so? returns Miss Blatt quite
unmoved. She herself met him for the first time last summer at Ascot and
they had quite a talk. (If this really true, can only feel perfectly
convinced that any talk there was emanated entirely from Miss B.)</p>
<p>Just as I feel that the limits of sanity have been reached, telephone
bell rings and I answer it and take complicated message from Lecture
Agent about Buffalo, which at first I think to be Natural History, but
afterwards realise is a town.</p>
<p>Continuity of atmosphere is now destroyed and I remain standing and
inform Miss Blatt that I am afraid that I shall have to go out. She
offers to take me up-town, and I thank her and say No. Then, she says, it
won't be any trouble to take me down-town. This time I say No without
thanking her.</p>
<p>We spend about ten minutes saying good-bye. Miss Blatt assures me that
she will get in touch with me again within a day or two, and meanwhile
will send me some of her articles to read, and I finally shut the door on
her and sit down on the bed, after locking the door for fear she should
come back again.</p>
<p>Tear open letters from Robert and the children, read them three times
at least, become homesick and rather agitated, and then read them all
over again. Robert says that he will be glad when I get home
again&mdash;(am strongly tempted to book my passage for
to-morrow)&mdash;and adds details about the garden. Our Vicar, he adds,
preached quite a good sermon on Sunday last, and Cook's sponge-cake is
improving. Vicky's letter very affectionate, with rows of kisses and
large drawing of a horse with short legs and only one visible ear. The
Literary Society at school, writes Vicky, is reading Masefield, and this
she enjoys very much. Am a good deal impressed and try to remember what I
know of Masefield's work and how much of it is suitable for nine years
old.</p>
<p>Robin's letter, very long and beautifully written, contains urgent
request for any American slang expressions that I may meet with, but it
must be <i>new</i> slang. Not, he explicitly states, words like Jake and
Oke, which everybody knows already. He also hopes that I am enjoying
myself and have seen some gangsters. A boy called Saunders is now reading
a P. G. Wodehouse book called <i>Love Among the Chickens.</i> A boy
called Badger has had his front tooth knocked out. There isn't, says
Robin in conclusion, much to write about, and he sends Best Love.</p>
<p>Receive also charming letter from Caroline Concannon, who says,
gratifyingly, that she misses me, and adds in a vague way that everything
is ALL RIGHT in the flat. Remaining correspondence mostly bills, but am
quite unable to pay any attention to them for more reasons than one, and
merely put them all together in an elastic band and endorse the top one
"Bills", which makes me feel business-like and practically produces
illusion of having paid them already.</p>
<p>Extraordinary feeling of exhaustion comes over me, due partly to
emotion and partly to visit of Miss Katherine Ellen Blatt, and I decide
to go out and look at shop-windows on Fifth Avenue, which I do, and enjoy
enormously.</p>
<p>Later in the day am conducted to a Tea&mdash;cocktails and sandwiches
as usual. Meet distinguished author and critic, Mr. Alexander Woollcott,
who is amusing and talks to me very kindly. In the middle of it telephone
bell rings and he conducts conversation with&mdash;presumably&mdash;an
Editor, in which he sags, No, no, he must positively decline to undertake
any more work. The terms, he admits, are wonderful, but it simply can't
be done. No, he can't possibly reconsider his decision. He has had to
refuse several other offers of the same kind already. He can undertake
nothing more. On this he rings off and resumes conversation just as if
nothing has happened. Am completely lost in awe and admiration.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 26th.</i>&mdash;Telephone message reaches me just as I am
contemplating familiar problem of packing more into suit-cases, hat-box
and attach&eacute;-case than they can possibly contain. Will I at once
get into touch with Mrs. Margery Brown, who has received a letter about
me from Mrs. Tressider in England? Conviction comes over me in a rush
that I cannot, and will not, do anything of the kind, and I go on
packing.</p>
<p>Telephone bell rings&mdash;undoubtedly Mrs. Margery Brown&mdash;and I
contemplate leaving it unanswered, but am mysteriously unable to do so.
Decide to pretend that I am my Secretary and say that I've gone out. Do
so, but find myself involved in hideous and unconvincing muddle, in which
all pronouns become badly mixed up. Discover, moreover, after some
moments, that I am not talking to Mrs. Margery Brown at all, but to
unknown American lady who repeats patiently that an old friend wishes to
come round and see me. Name of old friend is unintelligible to me
throughout, but finally I give way and say Very well, I shall be here for
another hour before starting for Chicago.</p>
<p>(Am not, in actual point of fact, departing for Chicago until
to-eight. <i>Query:</i> Would it not, when time permits, be advisable to
concentrate very seriously on increasing tendency to distort the truth to
my own convenience? <i>Ans.:</i> Advisable, perhaps, but definitely
unnerving, and investigation probably better postponed until safely
returned to home surroundings. Cannot wholly escape the suspicion that
moral standards are largely dependent upon geographical
surroundings.)</p>
<p>Return to suit-cases, and decide that if bottle of witch-hazel is
rolled in paper it can perfectly well be placed inside bedroom slipper,
and that it will make all the difference if I remove bulky evening wrap
from its present corner of suit-case, and bestow it in the bottom of
hat-box. Result of these manoeuvres not all I hope, as situation of best
hat now becomes precarious, and I also suddenly discover that I have
forgotten to pack photographs of Robin and Vicky, small red travelling
clock, and pair of black shoes that are inclined to be too tight and that
I never by any chance wear.</p>
<p>Despair invades me and I am definitely relieved when knock at the door
interrupts me. I open it and am greeted by a scream:&mdash;<i>Ah, madame,
quelle &eacute;motion!</i>&mdash;and recognise Mademoiselle. She screams
again, throws herself into my arms, says <i>Mon Dieu, je vais me trouver
mal, alors?</i> and sinks on to the bed, but does not cease to talk. She
is, she tells me, with <i>une famille tr&egrave;s
am&eacute;ricaine&mdash;assez comme-il-faut</i>&mdash;(which I think an
ungenerous description)&mdash;and has promised to remain with them in New
York for six months, at the end of which they are going to Paris, where
she originally met them. Are they nice, and is Mademoiselle happy? I
enquire. To this Mademoiselle can only throw up her hands, gaze at the
ceiling, and exclaim that <i>le bonheur</i> is <i>bien peu de
chose</i>&mdash;with which I am unable to agree. She further adds that
never, for one moment, day or night, does she cease to think of <i>ce
cher petit chez-nous du Devonshire</i> and <i>cet amour de Vicky</i>.</p>
<p>(If this is literally true, Mademoiselle cannot possibly be doing her
duty by her present employers. Can also remember distinctly many
occasions on which Mademoiselle, in Devonshire, wept and threw herself
about in despair, owing to alleged dullness of the English countryside,
insults heaped upon her by the English people, and general <i>manque de
coeur et de d&eacute;licatesse</i> of my own family, particularly
Vicky.)</p>
<p>All, however, is now forgotten, and we indulge in immense and
retrospective conversation in which Mademoiselle goes so far as to refer
sentimentally to <i>ces bons jeux de cricket dans le jardin</i>. Do not,
naturally, remind her of the number of times in which <i>ces bons
jeux</i> were brought to an abrupt end by Mademoiselle herself flinging
down her bat and walking away saying <i>Moi, je ne joue plus</i>, owing
to having been bowled out by Robin.</p>
<p>She inspects photographs of the children and praises their looks
extravagantly, but on seeing Robert's only observes resentfully <i>Tiens!
on dirait qu'il vieilli!</i> She then looks piercingly at me, and I feel
that only politeness keeps her from saying exactly the same thing about
me, so turn the conversation by explaining that I am packing to go to
Chicago.</p>
<p>Packing! exclaims Mademoiselle. <i>Ah, quelle horreur! Quelle
fa&ccedil;on de faire les choses!</i> At this she throws off black kid
gloves, small fur jacket, three scarves, large amethyst brooch, and mauve
wool cardigan, and announces her intention of packing for me. This she
does with extreme competence and unlimited use of tissue paper, but
exclaims rather frequently that my folding of clothes is enough to
<i>briser le coeur.</i></p>
<p>I beg her to stay and have lunch with me, and she says <i>Mais non,
mais non, c'est trop,</i> but is finally persuaded, on condition that she
may take down her hair and put it up again before going downstairs. To
this I naturally agree, and Mademoiselle combs her hair and declares that
it reminds her of <i>le bon temps pass&eacute;.</i></p>
<p>Find it impossible to extract from her any coherent impressions of
America as she only replies to enquiries by shaking her head and saying
<i>Ah, l'Am&eacute;rique, l'Am&eacute;rique! C'est toujours le dollarrr,
n'est-ce pas?</i> Decide, however, that Mademoiselle has on the whole met
with a good deal of kindness, and is in receipt of an enormous
salary.</p>
<p>We lunch together in Persian Coffee Shop, Mademoiselle talking with
much animation, and later she takes her departure on the understanding
that we are to meet again before I sail.</p>
<p>Send hurried postcards of Tallest Building in New York to Robin and
Vicky respectively, tip everybody in Hotel who appears to expect it, and
prepare myself for night journey to Chicago.</p>
<p><i>Oct. 27th.</i>&mdash;Remember, not without bitterness, that
everybody in England has told me that I shall find American trains much
too hot, Our Vicar's Wife&mdash;who has never been to America&mdash;going
so far as to say that a temperature of 100 degrees is quite usual. Find
myself, on the contrary, distinctly cold, and am not in the least
surprised to see snow on the ground as we approach Chicago.</p>
<p>Postcards of the World Fair on sale in train, mostly coloured very
bright blue and very bright yellow. I buy one of the Hall of
Science&mdash;suitable for Robert&mdash;Observation Tower&mdash;likely to
appeal to Robin&mdash;Prehistoric Animals&mdash;Vicky&mdash;and Streets
of Paris, which has a sound of frivolity that I think will please
Caroline Concannon Rose and Felicity get Avenue of Flags and Belgian
Village respectively, because I have nothing else left. Inscribe various
rather illegible messages on all these, mostly to the effect that I am
enjoying myself, that I miss them all very much, and that I haven't time
to write more just now, but will do so later.</p>
<p>Breakfast is a success&mdash;expensive, but good&mdash;and I succeed
in attaining a moderate cleanliness of appearance before train gets in.
Customary struggle with suit-case ensues&mdash;pyjamas and sponge-bag
shut in after prolonged efforts, and this achievement immediately
followed by discovery that I have forgotten to put in brush and comb. At
this, coloured porter comes to my rescue, and shortly afterwards Chicago
is reached.</p>
<p>Literary friend Arthur has not only gratifyingly turned up to meet me,
but has brought with him very pretty younger sister, visiting friend from
New York (male) and exclusive-looking dachshund, referred to as Vicki
Baum.</p>
<p>Moreover, representative from publishers puts in an
appearance&mdash;hat worn at a very dashing angle&mdash;know him only as
Pete and cannot imagine how I shall effect introductions, but this
fortunately turns out to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Am rather moved at finding that both literary friend and Pete now
appear to me in the light of old and dear friends, such is my
satisfaction at seeing faces that are not those of complete
strangers.</p>
<p>Someone unknown takes a photograph, just as we leave
station&mdash;this, says Arthur impressively, hasn't happened since the
visit of Queen Marie of Roumania&mdash;and we drive off.</p>
<p>Chicago strikes me as full of beautiful buildings, and cannot imagine
why nobody ever says anything about this aspect of it. Do not like to ask
anything about gangsters, and see no signs of their activities, but hope
these may be revealed later, otherwise children will be seriously
disappointed. The lake, which looks to me exactly like the sea, excites
my admiration, and building in which Arthur's family lives turns out to
be right in front of it.</p>
<p>They receive me in kindest possible manner&mdash;I immediately fall in
love with Arthur's mother&mdash;and suggest, with the utmost tact, that I
should like a bath at once. (After one look in the glass, can well
understand why this thought occurred to them.)</p>
<p>Perceive myself to be incredibly dirty, dishevelled and out of repair
generally, and do what I can, in enormous bedroom and bathroom, to
rectify this. Hair, however, not improved by my making a mistake amongst
unaccustomed number of bath-taps, and giving myself quite involuntary
shower.</p>
<p><i>October 30th.</i>&mdash;Feel quite convinced that I have known
Arthur, his family, his New York friend and his dog all my life. They
treat me with incredible kindness and hospitality, and introduce me to
all their friends.</p>
<p>Some of the friends&mdash;but not all&mdash;raise the Problem of the
American Woman. Find myself as far as ever from having thought out
intelligent answer to this, and have serious thoughts of writing dear
Rose, and asking her to cable reply, if Problem is to pursue me wherever
I go in the United States.</p>
<p>Enormous cocktail-party is given by Arthur's mother, entirely in
honour of New York friend&mdash;whom I now freely address as
Billy&mdash;and myself. Bond of union immediately established between us,
as we realise joint responsibility of proving ourselves worthy of all
this attention.</p>
<p>Am introduced to hundreds of people&mdash;quite as many men as women,
which impresses me, and which I feel vaguely should go at least half-way
towards solving American Woman Problem, if only I could make the
connection&mdash;but clarity of thought distinctly impaired, probably by
cocktails.</p>
<p>Attractive woman in blue tells me that she knows a friend of mine:
Mrs. Tressider? I instinctively reply. Yes, Mrs. Tressider. And The Boy
too. He doesn't look strong. I assert&mdash;without the slightest
justification&mdash;that he is much stronger than he was, and begin to
talk about the Fair. Am told in return that I <i>must</i> visit the Hall
of Science, go up the Observation Tower, and inspect the Belgian
Village.</p>
<p>Complete stranger tells me that I am dining at her apartment
to-morrow, another lady adds that she is looking forward to seeing me on
Sunday at her home in the country, an elderly gentleman remarks that he
is so glad he is to have the pleasure of giving me lunch and taking me
round the Fair, and another complete, and charming, stranger informs me
that Arthur and I are to have tea at her house when we visit Chicago
University.</p>
<p>Am beginning to feel slightly dazed&mdash;cocktails have undoubtedly
contributed to this&mdash;but gratified beyond description at so much
attention and kindness, and have hazy idea of writing letter home to
explain that I am evidently of much greater importance than any of us
have ever realised.</p>
<p>Am brought slightly down to earth again by remembrance that I am not
in Chicago entirely for purpose of enjoyment, and that to-morrow Pete is
escorting me to important department store, where I am to sign books and
deliver short speech.</p>
<p>Decide that I must learn this by heart overnight, but am taken to a
symphony concert, come back very late, and go to bed instead.</p>
<p><i>October 31st.</i>&mdash;Am called for in the morning by
Pete&mdash;hat still at very daring angle&mdash;and we walk through the
streets. He tells me candidly that he does not like authors; I say that I
don't either, and we get on extremely well.</p>
<p>Department store is the most impressive thing I have ever seen in my
life, and the largest. We inspect various departments, including Modern
Furniture, which consists of a number of rooms containing perfectly
square sofas, coloured glass animals, cocktail appliances and steel
chairs. Am a good deal impressed, and think that it is all a great
improvement on older style, but at the same time cannot possibly conceive
of Robert reading <i>The Times</i> seated on oblong black-and-green divan
with small glass-topped table projecting from the wall beside him, and
statuette of naked angular woman with large elbows exactly opposite.</p>
<p>Moreover, no provision made anywhere for housing children, and do not
like to enquire what, if anything, is ever done for them.</p>
<p>Admirable young gentleman who shows us round says that the Modern
Kitchen will be of special interest to me, and ushers us into it. Pete,
at this stage, looks slightly sardonic, and I perceive that he is as well
aware as I am myself that the Modern Kitchen is completely wasted on me.
Further reflection also occurs to me that if Pete were acquainted with
Cook he would realise even better than he does why I feel that the Modern
Kitchen is not destined to hold any significant place in my life.</p>
<p>Pete informs me that he is anxious to introduce me to charming and
capable woman, friend of his, who runs the book department of the Store.
He tells me her name, and I immediately forget it again. Later on, short
exercise in Pelmanism enables me to connect wave in her hair with first
name, which is Marcella. Remaining and more important half continues
elusive, and I therefore call her nothing. Am impressed by her office,
which is entirely plastered with photographs, mostly inscribed, of
celebrities. She asks if I know various of these. I have to reply each
time that I don't, and begin to feel inferior. (Recollection here of
Katherine Ellen Blatt, intimate personal friend of every celebrity that
ever lived.) Become absent-minded, and hear myself, on-being asked if I
haven't met George Bernard Shaw, replying No, but I know who he is. This
reply not a success, and Marcella ceases to probe into the state of my
literary connections.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards I am escorted back to book department&mdash;should
like to linger amongst First Editions, or even New Juveniles, but this is
not encouraged&mdash;and young subordinate of Marcella's announces that
Quite a nice lot of people are waiting. Last week, she adds, they had
Hervey Allen. Foresee exactly what she is going to say next, which is
What do I think of <i>Anthony Adverse,</i> and pretend to be absorbed in
small half-sheet of paper on which I have written rather illegible
Notes.</p>
<p>Quite a nice lot of people turns out to mean between four and five
hundred ladies, with a sprinkling of men, all gathered round a little
dais with a table behind which I am told to take up my stand. Feel a
great deal more inclined to crawl underneath it and stay there, but quite
realise that this is, naturally, out of the question.</p>
<p>Marcella says a few words&mdash;I remind myself that nothing in the
world can last for ever, and anyway they need none of them ever meet me
again after this afternoon&mdash;and plunge forthwith into speech.</p>
<p>Funny story goes well&mdash;put in another one which I have just
thought of, and which isn't so good&mdash;but that goes well too. Begin
to think that I really am a speaker after all, and wonder why nobody at
home has ever said anything about it, and how I am ever to make them
believe it, without sounding conceited.</p>
<p>Sit down amidst applause and try to look modest, until I suddenly
catch sight of literary friend Arthur and his friend Billy, who have
evidently been listening. Am rather agitated at this, and feel that
instead of looking modest I merely look foolish.</p>
<p>At this point Pete, who hasn't even pretended to listen to me, for
which I am grateful rather than otherwise, reappears from some quite
other department where he has sensibly been spending his time, and says
that I had better autograph a few books, as People will Like It.</p>
<p>His idea of a few books runs into hundreds, and I sit and sign them
and feel very important indeed. Streams of ladies walk past and we
exchange a few words. Most of them ask How does one write a book? and
several tell me that they heard something a few weeks ago which
definitely <i>ought</i> to go into a book. This is usually a witticism
perpetrated by dear little grandchild, aged six last July, but is
sometimes merely a Funny Story already known to me,
and&mdash;probably&mdash;to everybody else in the civilised world. I say
Thank you, Thank you very much, and continue to sign my name. Idle fancy
crosses my mind that it would be fun if I was J. P. Morgan, and all this
was cheques.</p>
<p>After a time Marcella retrieves me, and says that she has not
forgotten I am an Englishwoman, and will want my Tea. Am not fond of tea
at the best of times, and seldom take it, but cannot of course say so,
and only refer to Arthur and his friend Billy, who may be waiting for me.
No, not at all, says Marcella. They are buying tortoises. Tortoises? Yes,
tiny little tortoises. There is, asserts Marcella, a display of them
downstairs, with different flowers hand-painted on their shells. She
takes advantage of the stunned condition into which this plunges me to
take me back to her office, where we have tea&mdash;English note struck
by the fact that it is pitch-black, and we have lemon instead of
milk&mdash;and Pete rejoins us, and confirms rumour as to floral
tortoises being on sale, only he refers to them as turtles. Later on, am
privileged to view them, and they crawl about in a little basin filled
with water and broken shells, and display unnatural-looking bunches of
roses and forget-me-nots on their backs.</p>
<p>Sign more books after tea, and am then taken away by friend Arthur,
who says that his mother is waiting for me at the English-. Speaking
Union. (Why not at home, which I should much prefer?) However, the
English-Speaking Union is very pleasant. I meet a number of people, they
ask what I think of America, and if I am going to California, and I say
in return that I look forward to visiting the Fair and we part
amicably.</p>
<p>Interesting and unexpected encounter with one lady, dressed in black
and green, who says that when in New York she met my children's late
French governess. I scream with excitement, and black-and-green lady
looks rather pitying, and says Oh yes, the world is quite a small place.
I say contentiously No, no, not as small as all that, and Mademoiselle
and I met in New York, and I do so hope she is happy and with nice
people. She is, replies black-and-green lady severely, with perfectly
delightful people&mdash;Southerners&mdash;one of our very oldest Southern
families. They all speak with a real Southern accent. Stop myself just in
time from saying that Mademoiselle will probably correct that, and ask
instead if the children are fond of her. Black-and-green lady only
repeats, in reply, that her friends belong to the oldest Southern family
in the South, practically, and moves off looking as though she rather
disapproves of me.</p>
<p>This encounter, for reason which I cannot identify, has rather thrown
me off my balance, and I shortly afterwards ask Arthur if we cannot go
home. He says Yes, in the most amiable way, and takes me away in a taxi
with his very pretty sister. Enquire of her where and how I can possibly
get my hair washed, and she at once undertakes to make all necessary
arrangements, and says that the place that does <i>her</i> hair can very
well do mine. (As she is a particularly charming blonde, at least ten
years' younger than I am, the results will probably be entirely
different, but keep this pessimistic reflection to myself.)</p>
<p>Literary friend Arthur, with great good-feeling, says that he knows
there are some letters waiting for me, which I shall wish to read in
peace, and that he is sure I should like to rest before dinner-party, to
which he is taking me at eight o'clock. (Should like to refer Katherine
Ellen Blatt to dear Arthur, for lessons in <i>savoir-faire.)</i></p>
<p>Letters await me in my room, but exercise great self-control by
tearing off my hat, throwing my coat on the floor, and dashing gloves and
bag into different corners of the room before I sit down to read
them.</p>
<p>Only one is from England: Our Vicar's Wife writes passionate enquiry
as to whether I am going anywhere near Arizona, as boy in whom she and
Our Vicar took great interest in their <i>first</i> parish&mdash;North
London, five-and-twenty years ago&mdash;is supposed to have gone there
and done very well. Will I make enquiries&mdash;name was Sydney Cripps,
and has one front tooth missing, knocked out at cricket, has written to
Our Vicar from time to time, but last occasion nearly twelve years
ago&mdash;Time, adds Our Vicar's Wife, passes. All is well at
home&mdash;very strange not to see me about&mdash;Women's Institute
Committee met last week, how difficult it is to please everybody.</p>
<p>Can believe from experience that this is, indeed, so.</p>
<p><i>November 1st.</i>&mdash;Visit the World Fair in company with Arthur
and his family. Buildings all very modern and austere, except for
colouring, which is inclined to be violent, but aspect as a whole is
effective and impressive, and much to be preferred to customary
imitations of ancient Greece. Individual exhibits admirably displayed,
and total area of space covered must be enormous, whether lake&mdash;of
which I see large bits here and there&mdash;is included or not. Private
cars not admitted&mdash;which I think sensible&mdash;but rickshaws
available, drawn by University students&mdash;to whom, everybody says,
It's Interesting to Talk&mdash;and small motor-buses go quietly round and
round the Fair.</p>
<p>Arthur and I patronise rickshaws&mdash;I take a good look at my
University Student, and decide that conversation would probably benefit
neither of us&mdash;and visit various buildings. Hall of Science not
amongst our successes, unfortunately, as the sight of whole skeletons,
portions of the human frame executed in plaster, and realistic maps of
sinews and blood-vessels, all ranged against the wall in glass
show-cases, merely causes me to hurry past with my eyes shut. Arthur is
sympathetic, and tells me that there <i>is</i> an exhibit of Live Babies
in Incubators to be seen, but cannot decide whether he means that this
would be better than scientific, wonders at present surrounding us, or
worse.</p>
<p>Resume rickshaws, and visit Jade Chinese Temple, which is lovely,
Prehistoric Animals-unpleasant impression of primitive man's existence
derived from these, but should like to have seen a brontosaurus in the
flesh nevertheless&mdash;and Belgian Village, said to be replica of
fifteenth century. (If not fifteenth, then sixteenth. Cannot be
sure.)</p>
<p>Here Arthur and I descend, and walk up and down stone steps and
cobbled streets, and watch incredibly clean-looking peasants in
picturesque costumes dancing hand in hand and every now and then
stamping. Have always hitherto associated this with Russians, but
evidently wrong.</p>
<p>Just as old Flemish Clock on old Flemish Town Hall clangs out old
Flemish Air, and Arthur and I tell one another that this is beautifully
done, rather brassy voice from concealed loudspeaker is inspired to
enquire: Oh boy! What about that new tooth-paste? Old Flemish atmosphere
goes completely to bits, and Arthur and I, in disgust, retire to Club,
where we meet his family, and have most excellent lunch.</p>
<p>Everyone asks what I want to see next, and Arthur's mother says that
she has a few friends coming to dinner, but is thrown into consternation
by Arthur's father, who says that he has invited two South Americans to
come in afterwards. Everyone says South Americans? as if they were
pterodactyls at the very least, and antecedents are enquired into, but
nothing whatever transpires except that they are South Americans and that
nobody knows anything about them, not even their names.</p>
<p>Return to Fair after lunch&mdash;new rickshaw student, less
forbidding-looking than the last, and I say feebly that It is very hot
for November, and he replies that he can tell by my accent that I come
from England and he supposes it's always foggy there, and I say No, not
always, and nothing further passes between us. Am evidently not gifted,
where interesting students from American Colleges are concerned, and
decide to do nothing more in this line. More exhibits follow&mdash;mostly
very good&mdash;and Arthur says that he thinks we ought to see the North
American Indians.</p>
<p>He accordingly pays large sum of money which admits us into special
enclosures where authentic Red Indians are stamping about&mdash;(stamping
definitely discredited henceforward as a Russian monopoly)&mdash;and
uttering sounds exclusively on two notes, all of which, so far as I can
tell, consist of Wah Wah! and nothing else. Listen to this for nearly
forty minutes but am not enthusiastic. Neither is Arthur, and we shortly
afterwards go home.</p>
<p>Write postcards to Rose, the children, and Robert, and after some
thought send one to Cook, although entirely uncertain as to whether this
will gratify her or not. Am surprised, and rather disturbed, to find that
wording of Cook's postcard takes more thought than that on all the others
put together.</p>
<p>Small dinner takes place later on, and consists of about sixteen
people, including a lady whose novel won the Pulitzer Prize, a lady who
writes poetry&mdash;very, very well known, though not, unhappily, to
me&mdash;a young gentleman who has something to do with Films, an older
one who is connected with Museums, and delightful woman in green who says
that she knows Devonshire and has stayed with the Frobishers. Did she, I
rashly enquire, enjoy it? Well, she replies tolerantly, Devonshire is a
lovely part of the world, but she is afraid Sir William Frobisher
dislikes Americans. I protest, and she then adds, conclusively, that Sir
W. told her <i>himself</i> how much he disliked Americans. Feel that it
would indeed be idle to try and get round this, so begin to talk at once
about the Fair.</p>
<p>Dinner marvellous, as usual&mdash;company very agreeable&mdash;and my
neighbour&mdash;Museums&mdash;offers to conduct me to see Chicago
Historical Museum at ten o'clock next morning.</p>
<p>Just as dinner is over, two extremely elegant young gentlemen, with
waists and superbly smooth <i>coiffures,</i> come in and bow gracefully
to our hostess. New York friend, Billy, hisses at me: <i>"The South
Americans",</i> and I nod assent, and wonder how on earth they are going
to be introduced, when nobody knows their names. This, however, is
achieved by hostess who simply asks them what they are called, and then
introduces everybody else.</p>
<p>Am told afterwards that neither of them speaks much English, and that
Arthur's father asked them questions all the evening. No one tells me
whether they answered them or not, and I remain mildly curious on the
point.</p>
<p><i>November 4th.</i>&mdash;Singular and interesting opportunity is
offered me to contrast Sunday spent on Long Island and Sunday spent in
equivalent country district outside Chicago, called Lake Forest, where I
am invited to lunch and spend the afternoon. Enquire of Arthur quite
early if this is to be a large party. He supposes About Thirty. Decide at
once to put on the Coming Molyneux's best effort&mdash;white daisies on
blue silk. But, says Arthur, country clothes. Decide to substitute wool
coat and skirt, with red beret. And, says Arthur, he is taking me on to
dinner with very, very rich acquaintance, also at Lake Forest. I revert,
mentally, to blue silk and daisies, and say that I suppose it won't
matter if we're not in evening dress? Oh, replies Arthur, we've got to
take evening clothes with us, and change there. Our hostess won't hear of
anything else. I take a violent dislike to her on the spot, and say that
I'm not sure I want to go at all. At this Arthur is gloomy, but firm.
<i>He</i> doesn't want to go either, and neither does Billy, but we can't
get out of it now. We must simply pack our evening clothes in bags and
<i>go.</i> Have not sufficient moral courage to rebel any further, and
instead consider the question of packing up my evening clothes. Suit-case
is too large, and attach&eacute;-case too small, but finally decide on
the latter, which will probably mean ruin to evening frock.</p>
<p><i>November 5th.</i>&mdash;Literary friend Arthur, still plunged in
gloom, takes Billy and me by car to Lake Forest, about thirty miles from
Chicago. We talk about grandmothers&mdash;do not know why or how this
comes to pass&mdash;and then about Scotland. Scenery very beautiful, but
climate bad. Arthur once went to Holyrood, but saw no bloodstains. Billy
has a relation who married the owner of a Castle in Rossunshire and they
live there and have pipers every evening. I counter this by saying that I
have a friend, married to a distinguished historian or something, at
Edinburgh University. Wish I hadn't said "or something" as this casts an
air of spuriousness over the whole story. Try to improve on it by adding
firmly that they live in Wardie Avenue, Edinburgh&mdash;but this is
received in silence.</p>
<p>(<i>Query:</i> Why are facts invariably received so much less
sympathetically than fictions? Had I only said that distinguished
historian and his wife lived in a cellar of Edinburgh Castle and sold
Edinburgh rock, reactions of Arthur and Billy probably much more
enthusiastic.)</p>
<p>Arrive at about one o'clock. House, explains Arthur, belongs to great
friends of his&mdash;charming people&mdash;Mrs. F. writes
novels&mdash;sister won Pulitzer Prize with another novel. At this I
interject Yes, yes, I met her the other day&mdash;and feel like a dear
old friend of the family.</p>
<p>House, says Arthur all over again&mdash;at which I perceive that I
must have interrupted him before he'd finished, and suddenly remember
that Robert has occasionally complained of this&mdash;House belongs to
Mr. and Mrs. F. and has been left entirely unaltered since it was first
built in 1874, furniture and all. It is, in fact, practically a Museum
Piece.</p>
<p>Discover this to be indeed no overunstatement, and am enchanted with
house, which is completely Victorian, and has fretwork brackets in every
available corner, and a great deal of furniture. Am kindly welcomed, and
taken upstairs to leave my coat and take off my hat. Spend the time
instead in looking at gilt clock under glass shade, wool-and-bead mats,
and coloured pictures of little girls in pinafores playing with large
white kittens. Have to be retrieved by hostess's daughter, who explains
that she thought I might have lost my way. I apologise and hope that I'm
not late for lunch.</p>
<p>This fear turns out later to be entirely groundless, as luncheon
party&mdash;about thirty-five people&mdash;assembles by degrees on porch,
and drinks cocktails, and nobody sits down to lunch until three o'clock.
Have pleasant neighbours on either side, and slightly tiresome one
opposite, who insists on talking across the table and telling me that I
must go to the South, whatever I do. She herself comes of a Southern
family, and has never lost her Southern accent, as I have no doubt
noticed. Am aware that she intends me to assent to this, but do not do
so, and conversation turns to <i>Anthony Adverse</i> as usual&mdash;and
the popularity of ice-cream in America. Lunch over at about four
o'clock&mdash;can understand why tea, as a meal, does not exist in the
U.S.A.&mdash;and we return to the porch, and everyone says that this is
the Indian Summer.</p>
<p>Find myself sitting with elderly man, who civilly remarks that he
wants to hear about the book I have written. Am aware that this cannot
possibly be true, but take it in the spirit in which it is meant, and
discuss instead the British Museum&mdash;which he knows much better than
I do&mdash;trout-fishing&mdash;about which neither of us knows anything
whatever&mdash;and the state of the dollar.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Arthur, with fearful recrudescence of despair, tells
me that there is nothing for it, as we've got another forty miles to
drive, but to say good-bye and go. We may not <i>want</i> to, but we
simply haven't any choice, he says.</p>
<p>After this we linger for about thirty-five minutes longer, repeating
how sorry we are that we've got to go, and hearing how very sorry
everybody else is as well. Eventually find ourselves in car again,
suit-cases with evening clothes occupying quite a lot of space, and again
causing Arthur to lament pertinacity of hostess who declined to receive
us in ordinary day clothes.</p>
<p>Fog comes on&mdash;is this a peculiarity of Indian
Summer?&mdash;chauffeur takes two or three wrong turnings, but says that
he knows where we shall Come Out&mdash;and Billy goes quietly to sleep.
Arthur and I talk in subdued voices for several minutes, but get louder
and louder as we become more interested, and Billy wakes up and denies
that he has ever closed an eye at all.</p>
<p>Silence then descends upon us all, and I lapse into thoughts of
Robert, the children, and immense width and depth of the Atlantic Ocean.
Have, as usual, killed and buried us all, myself included, several times
over before we arrive.</p>
<p>Just as we get out of car&mdash;Billy falls over one of the suit-cases
and says Damn&mdash;Arthur mutters that I <i>must</i> remember to look at
the pictures. Wonderful collection, and hostess likes them to be admired.
This throws me off my balance completely, and I follow very superb and
monumental butler with my eyes fixed on every picture I see, in series of
immense rooms through which we are led. Result of this is that I
practically collide with hostess, advancing gracefully to receive us, and
that my rejoinders to her cries of welcome are totally lacking in
<i>empressement,</i> as I am still wondering how soon I ought to say
anything about the pictures, and what means I can adopt to sound as if I
really knew something about them. Hostess recalls me to myself by
enquiring passionately if we have brought evening things, as she has
rooms all ready for us to change in.</p>
<p>Am struck by this preoccupation with evening clothes, and interesting
little speculation presents itself, as to whether she suffers from
obsession on the point, and if so Could psychoanalysis be of any help?
Treatment undoubtedly very expensive, but need not, in this case, be
considered.</p>
<p>Just as I have mentally consigned her to luxurious nursing home, with
two specialists and a trained nurse, hostess again refers to our evening
clothes, and says that we had better come up and see the rooms in which
we are to dress. Follow her upstairs&mdash;more pictures all the way up,
and in corridor of vast length&mdash;I hear Arthur referring to "that
marvellous Toulouse-Lautrec" and look madly about, but cannot guess which
one he means, as all alike look to me marvellous, except occasional
still-life which I always detest&mdash;and shortly afterwards I am parted
from Arthur and Billy, and shown into complete <i>suite,</i> with
bedroom, bathroom and sitting-room. Hostess says solicitously: Can I
manage?</p>
<p>Yes, on the whole I think I can.</p>
<p>(Wonder what she would feel about extremely shabby bedroom at home,
total absence of either private bathroom or Toulouse-Lautrec, and
sitting-room downstairs in which Robert, children, cat, dog and myself
all congregate together round indifferent wood fire. This vision,
however, once more conducive to home-sickness, and hastily put it aside
and look at all the books in the five bookcases to see what I can read in
the bath.)</p>
<p>Am surprised and gratified to find that I have remembered to pack
everything I want, and perform satisfactory toilette, twice interrupted
by offers of assistance from lady's maid, who looks astonished when I
refuse them. Look at myself in three different mirrors,
decide&mdash;rather ungenerously&mdash;that I am better-looking than my
hostess, and on this reassuring reflection proceed downstairs.</p>
<p><i>November 5th</i> (continued).&mdash;Decide that I am, beyond a
doubt, making acquaintance with Millionaire Life in America, and that I
must take mental notes of everything I see and eat, for benefit of Robert
and the Women's Institute. Hostess, waiting in the drawing-room, has now
gone into mauve chiffon, triple necklace of large uncut amethysts, and at
least sixteen amethyst bracelets. Do not think much of mauve chiffon, but
am definitely envious of uncut amethysts, and think to myself that they
would look well on me.</p>
<p>Hostess is vivacious&mdash;talks to me in a sparkling manner about
World Fair, the South&mdash;which I must, at all costs, visit&mdash;and
California, which is, she says, overrated. But not, I urge, the climate?
Oh yes, the climate too. Am disillusioned by this, and think of saying
that even Wealth cannot purchase Ideal Climatic Conditions, but this far
too reminiscent of the <i>Fairchild Family,</i> and is instantly
dismissed.</p>
<p>Arthur and Billy come down, and I experience renewed tendency to cling
to their society in the midst of so much that is unfamiliar, and reflect
that I shall never again blame dear Robin for invariably electing to sit
next to his own relations at parties. Guests arrive&mdash;agreeable man
with bald head comes and talks to me, and says that he has been looking
forward to meeting me again, and I try, I hope successfully, to conceal
fact that I had no idea that we had ever met before.</p>
<p>Dinner follows&mdash;table is made of looking-glass, floor has
looking-glass let into it and so has ceiling. This arrangement impressive
in the extreme, though no doubt more agreeable to some of us than to
others. Try to imagine Robert, Our Vicar and even old Mrs. Blenkinsop in
these surroundings, and fail completely.</p>
<p>After dinner return to quite another drawing-room, and sit next to
yellow-satin lady with iron-grey hair, who cross-questions me rather
severely on my impressions of America, and tells me that I don't really
like Chicago, as English people never do, but that I shall adore Boston.
Am just preparing to contradict her when she spills her coffee all over
me. We all scream, and I get to my feet, dripping coffee over
no-doubt-invaluable Persian rug, and iron-grey lady, with more presence
of mind than regard for truth, exclaims that I must have done it with my
elbow and what a pity it is! Cannot, in the stress of the moment, think
of any form of words combining both perfect candour and absolute courtesy
in which to tell her that she is not speaking the truth and that her own
clumsiness is entirely responsible for disaster. Iron-grey woman takes
the initiative and calls for cold water&mdash;hot water no good at all,
the colder the better, for coffee.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Why does she know so much about it? Is it an old habit
of hers to spill coffee? Probably.)</p>
<p>Extensive sponging follows, and everybody except myself says that It
ought to be All Right now&mdash;which I know very well only means that
they are all thoroughly tired of the subject and wish to stop talking
about it.</p>
<p>Sit down again at furthest possible distance from iron-grey
woman&mdash;who is now informing us that if my frock had been velvet she
would have advised steaming, <i>not</i> sponging&mdash;and realise that,
besides having ruined my frock, I am also running grave risk of rheumatic
fever, owing to general dampness.</p>
<p>Remainder of the evening, so far as I am concerned, lacks
<i>entrain.</i></p>
<p><i>November 6th.</i>&mdash;Chicago visit draws to a close, and Pete,
after a last solemn warning to me about the importance of visiting
book-stores in all the towns I go to, returns to New York, but tells me
that we shall meet again somewhere or other very soon. Hope that this is
meant as a pleasant augury, rather than a threat, but am by no means
certain.</p>
<p><i>November 7th.</i>&mdash;Wake up in middle of the night and remember
that I never asked Robert to water indoor bulbs, planted by me in
September and left, as usual, in attic. Decide to send him a cable in the
morning. Doze again, but wake once more with strong conviction that cable
would not be a success as: <i>(a)</i> It might give Robert a shock.
<i>(b)</i> He would think it extravagant. Decide to write letter about
bulbs instead.</p>
<p>Final spate of social activities marks the day, and includes further
visit to World Fair, when I talk a great deal about buying presents for
everybody at home, but in the long run only buy Indian silver bracelet
with turquoise for Caroline C. (Will take up no extra room in flat, and
am hoping she will wear it, rather than leave it about.)</p>
<p>Telegram is brought me in the course of the afternoon, am seized by
insane conviction that it must be from Robert to say he <i>has</i>
watered the bulbs, but this stretching long arm of coincidence altogether
too far, and decide instead that Robin has been mortally injured at
football. Turns out to be communication of enormous length inviting me to
Lecture in New York some weeks hence followed by lunch at which many
distinguished writers hope to be present which will mean many important
contacts also publicity Stop Very cordially Katherine Ellen Blatt. Read
all this through at least four times before any of it really sinks in,
and then send back brief, but I hope civil, refusal.</p>
<p>Eat final dinner with Arthur and his family&mdash;tell them how much I
hope they will all come and stay with Robert and myself next
summer&mdash;and part from them with extreme regret.</p>
<p>Just as I am leaving, another telegram arrives: Please reconsider
decision cannot take no for an answer literary luncheon really important
function will receive wide press publicity letter follows Stop Very
sincerely Katherine Ellen Blatt.</p>
<p>Am a good deal stunned by this and decide to wait a little before
answering.</p>
<p>Arthur sees me off at station, and I board immense train on which I
appear to be the only passenger. Procedure ensues with which I am rapidly
becoming familiar, including unsatisfactory wash in small Toilet
Compartment which only provides revolting little machine that oozes
powder instead of decent soap. Reflect how much Robert would dislike
this. Thought of Robert is, as usual, too much for me, and I retire to
sleeping accommodation behind customary green curtains, and prepare to
sink into a sentimental reverie, but discover that I am sitting on green
paper bag into which porter has put my hat. Revulsion of feeling follows,
and I give way to anger instead of sorrow.</p>
<p><i>November 8th.</i>&mdash;Consider in some detail American preference
for travelling at night, and decide that I do not, on the whole, share
it. Meals undoubtedly excellent, but other arrangements poor, and arrival
in small hours of the morning utterly uncongenial.</p>
<p>Cleveland reached at 8 A.M.&mdash;eyes still bunged with sleep and
spirits at a very low ebb&mdash;and am met by extremely blue-eyed Miss V.
from book-store who says that she has Heard About me from Pete. She gets
into a car with me but does not say where she is taking me, and talks
instead about Winchester&mdash;which she says she has never
seen&mdash;American novels, and the Chicago World Fair. (Can foresee that
long before the end of tour I shall have said all I have to say about
World Fair, and shall find myself trying to invent brand-new
details.)</p>
<p>Drive through a great many streets, and past large numbers of superb
shop-fronts, and presently Miss V. says in a reverent voice, <i>There</i>
is Hall&eacute; Brothers, and I say Where, and have a vague idea that she
is referring to local Siamese Twins, but this turns out complete mistake
and Hall&eacute; Brothers revealed as enormous department store, in which
Miss V. is in charge of book department. Moreover Mrs. Hall&eacute;, it
now appears, is to be my hostess in Cleveland and we have practically
reached her house.</p>
<p>At this I look frantically in my hand-bag, discover that I have left
lipstick in the train, do what I can with powder-compact, but results on
pale-green complexion not at all satisfactory, and realise, not for the
first time, that accidental sitting on my hat in the train did it no
good.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall&eacute;, however, receives me kindly in spite of these
misfortunes, shows me very nice bedroom which she says belongs to her
daughter Katherine, now in Europe, and says that breakfast will be ready
when I am. Spend some time walking round Katherine's bedroom, and am
deeply impressed by her collection of books, which comprises practically
everything that I have always meant to read. Decide that Katherine must
be wholly given over to learning, but reverse this opinion on going into
Katherine's bathroom and finding it filled with coloured glass bottles,
pots, and jars of the most exotic description. Evidently other and more
frivolous preoccupations as well.</p>
<p>This conjecture confirmed when I meet Katherine's sister Jane at
breakfast&mdash;very pretty and well dressed, and can probably do
everything in the world well. Distinct tendency comes over me to fall
into rather melancholy retrospect concerning my own youth, utterly
denuded of any of the opportunities afforded to present generation.
Remind myself in time, however, that this reflection is as wholly
un-original as any in the world, and that I myself invariably dislike and
despise those who give vent to it.</p>
<p>Excellent coffee and bacon help further to restore me, and I decide
that almost every sorrow can probably be assuaged by a respectable meal.
<i>(Mem.:</i> Try to remember this and act upon it next time life appears
to be wholly intolerable.)</p>
<p>Programme for the day is then unfolded, and comprises&mdash;to my
surprise&mdash;inspection of three schools. The blue-eyed Miss V. has
said that I am interested in education. Think this over, decide that I
ought to be interested in education, and that therefore I probably am,
and accept with what is invariably referred to by dear Vicky as
<i>alacricity.</i></p>
<p>Morning is accordingly spent in visiting schools, of which I like two
and am staggered by the third, which is said to be on totally New Age
lines, and designed in order to enable the very young&mdash;ages two to
nine&mdash;to develop their own life-pattern without interference.</p>
<p>We get various glimpses of the life-patterns, many of which seem to me
to be rather lacking in coherence, and are shown round by very earnest
lady with projecting teeth, wearing a cretonne smock.</p>
<p>She says that the Little Ones are never interfered with, and that
punishments are unknown. Even supervision is made as unobtrusive as
possible. This she demonstrates by conducting us to landing on the
staircase, where large window overlooks playground. Here, she says,
teachers and parents can watch the little people at play. Play very often
a great revelation of character.</p>
<p>Can see no reason in the world why little people should not look up
from play and plainly perceive the noses of their parents and guardians
earnestly pressed to the window above them&mdash;but do not, naturally,
say so.</p>
<p>We then inspect Art&mdash;angular drawings of crooked houses and
deformed people and animals, painted in pale splotches of red and green
and yellow&mdash;Handwork&mdash;paper boxes with defective corners, and
blue paper mats&mdash;and Carpentry&mdash;a great many pieces of wood and
some sawdust.</p>
<p>Just as we leave Bathrooms&mdash;each child, says the cretonne smock
passionately, has its own little tooth-brush in its own little
mug&mdash;on our way downstairs to Gymnasium, Miss V. draws my attention
to a door with a little grille in it, through which we both peer in some
astonishment.</p>
<p>Infant child aged about three is revealed, sitting in solitude on tiny
little chair in front of tiny little table gazing thoughtfully at a
dinner-plate. What, I ask the cretonne smock, is this? She looks
distressed and replies Oh, that's the Food Problem.</p>
<p>We all three contemplate this distressing enigma in silence, and the
Food Problem gazes back at us with intelligent interest and evident
gratification, and we shortly afterwards retire.</p>
<p>Should be very sorry indeed to see New Age methods adopted at
eminently sane and straightforward establishment where Vicky is&mdash;I
hope&mdash;at present receiving education.</p>
<p><i>November 9th.</i>&mdash;Life in Cleveland agreeable, but rushed.
Book-store talk takes place as ordained by Pete, and is principally
remarkable because Lowell Thomas, celebrated American writer, precedes me
and gives very amusing lecture. Entire book department turned upside-down
searching for green ink, as it is, says Miss V., well known that Lowell
T. never will autograph his books in any other colour. Am frightfully
impressed by this, and join in green-ink hunt. It is finally run to
earth, and I suggest gumming on small label with L. T.'s name and telling
him that it has been waiting ever since his last visit. Am unfortunately
never informed whether this ingenious, though perhaps not very
straightforward, scheme is actually adopted.</p>
<p>Shake hands with Lowell Thomas afterwards, and like the look of him,
and buy two of his books, which are all about Arabia, and will do for
Robert. He autographs them in green ink, and I seriously contemplate
telling Miss V. that it will be utterly impossible for me to sign a
single volume of my own unless I can do so with an old-fashioned
goose-quill and blue blotting-paper.</p>
<p>Rather amusing incident then ensues, on my preferring modest request
that I may be allowed to Wash My Hands. Will I, says Miss V., anxiously,
be <i>very careful indeed?</i> No later than last year, celebrated Winner
of Pulitzer Prize succeeded in locking the door in such a way that it was
totally impossible to unlock it again, and there she was, says Miss V.
agitatedly, unable to make anybody hear, and meanwhile everybody was
looking for her all over the store, and couldn't imagine what had
happened, and eventually A Man had to break down the door.</p>
<p>Am horrified by this tragedy, and promise to exercise every care, but
feel that Miss V. is still reluctant to let me embark on so perilous an
enterprise. Moreover, am stopped no less than three time's, on my way
down small and obscure passage, and told by various young employees to be
very careful indeed, last year Pulitzer Prize-winner was locked in there
for hours and hours and couldn't be got out, man had to be sent for, door
eventually broken down. Am reminded of the Mistletoe Bough and wonder if
this distressing modern version has ever been immortalised in literature,
and if not how it could be done.</p>
<p>Various minor inspirations flit across my mind, but must be dealt with
later, and I concentrate on warnings received, and succeed in locking and
unlocking door with complete success.</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winner either remarkably unfortunate, or else strangely
deficient in elementary manual dexterity. Am taken home in car by Mrs.
Hall&eacute;&mdash;who tells me on the way the whole story of Pulitzer
Prize-winner and her misfortune all over again&mdash;and am tactfully
invited to rest before dinner.</p>
<p>(Rumour that American hostesses give one no time to breathe definitely
unjust.)</p>
<p><i>November 10th.</i>&mdash;Bid reluctant farewell to Cleveland. Last
day is spent in visiting book store, signing name&mdash;which I shall
soon be able to do in my sleep&mdash;and being taken by the Hall&eacute;
family to see film: <i>Private Life of Henry VIII.</i> Charles Laughton
is, as usual, marvellous, but film itself seems to me overrated. Tell
Mrs. H. that I would leave home any day for C. Laughton, at which she
looks surprised, and I feel bound to add that I don't really mean it
literally. She then takes me to the station and we part amicably with
mutual hopes of again meeting, in England or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Just as I am preparing to board train, Miss V. arrives with English
mail for me, which she has received at eleventh hour and is kindly
determined that I shall have without delay. Am extremely grateful, and
settle down to unwonted luxury of immediate and uninterrupted
reading.</p>
<p>Robert, Vicky and Robin all well: Robert much occupied with British
Legion concert, which he says was well attended, but accompanist suddenly
overcome by influenza and great difficulty in finding a substitute. Miss
Pankerton played Violin Solo, and this, says Robert, was much too long.
Can well believe it. Nothing whatever in garden, but one indoor bulb
shows signs of life. Am not at all exhilarated at this, and feel sure
that bulbs would have done better under my own eye. Early Romans should
certainly be well above ground by now.</p>
<p>Only remaining news is that Lady B. has offered to organise Historical
Pageant in the village next summer, featuring herself as Mary Queen of
Scots, and everybody else as morns-dancers, jesters, knights and
peasantry. Robert and Our Vicar dead against this, and Our Vicar's Wife
said to have threatened to resign the living. Living not hers to resign,
actually, but am in complete sympathy with general attitude implied, and
think seriously of cabling to say so.</p>
<p>In any case, Why Mary Queen of Scots? No possible connection with
remote village in Devonshire. Can only suppose that Lady B. can think of
no better way of displaying her pearls.</p>
<p>Surprised to find that dear Rose has actually remembered my
existence&mdash;no doubt helped by extraordinarily interesting series of
postcards sent at intervals ever since I left&mdash;and has written short
letter to say that she hopes I am having a very interesting time, and she
envies me for being in America, London is very cold and foggy. Brief
references follow to concert, lecture on child-guidance, and several new
plays recently attended by Rose, and she closes with best love and is
mine ever. <i>P.S.</i> Agatha is engaged to Betty's brother, followed by
three marks of exclamation.</p>
<p>Have never, to my certain knowledge, heard of Agatha, Betty or the
brother in my life.</p>
<p>Large envelope addressed by Caroline Concannon comes next, and
discloses number of smaller envelopes, all evidently containing bills,
also card of invitation to a Public Dinner, price one guinea, postcard
from Cissie Crabbe&mdash;saying that it is a Long While since she had
news of me&mdash;and a letter from C. C. herself.</p>
<p>This proves to be agreeably scandalous, and relates astonishing
behaviour of various prominent people. C. C. also adds that she thinks it
will amuse me to hear that a great friend of hers is divorcing his wife
and twelve co-respondents will be cited, there could have been many more,
but only twelve names have come out. Am disturbed by Caroline's idea of
what is likely to amuse me, but after a while feel that perhaps she has
not wholly misjudged me after all.</p>
<p>Forgive her everything when final page of letter reveals that she has
been to visit both Robin and Vicky at school, and gives full and
satisfactory account of each, even entering into details regarding
Robin's purchases at penny-in-the-slot machines on pier, and Vicky's
plate.</p>
<p>Letter concludes, as usual, with sweeping and optimistic assertion
that Everything in Doughty Street is Absolutely All Right, the carpets
want cleaning rather badly, and Caroline will try and get them done
before I get back, also the chandelier, absolutely pitch-black.</p>
<p>Caroline Concannon is followed by Felicity&mdash;blue envelope and
rather spidery handwriting&mdash;who hopes that I am making some money.
She herself is overdrawn at the Bank and can't make it out, she
<i>knows</i> she has spent far less than usual in the last six months,
but it's always the way. Felicity further hopes that I have good news of
the children, and it will be nice to know I'm safely home again, and ends
with renewed reference to finance, which is evidently an overwhelming
preoccupation. Feel sorry for Felicity, and decide to send her another
postcard, this time from Toronto.</p>
<p>Remaining correspondence includes earnest letter of
explanation&mdash;now some weeks out of date&mdash;from laundry
concerning pair of Boy's Pants&mdash;about which I remember nothing
whatever&mdash;begging letter from a Society which says that it was
established while King William IV. was still on the throne&mdash;and
completely illegible letter from Mary Kellway.</p>
<p>Make really earnest effort to decipher this, as dear Mary always so
amusing and original&mdash;but can make out nothing whatever beyond my
own name&mdash;which I naturally know already&mdash;and statement that
Mary's husband has been busy with what looks like&mdash;but of course
cannot be&mdash;pencils and geranium-tops&mdash;and that the three
children have gone either to bed, to the bad, to board or to live at
place which might be either Brighton, Ilford or Egypt.</p>
<p>Feel that this had better be kept until time permits of my deciphering
it, and that all comment should be reserved until I can feel really
convinced of exact nature of items enumerated. In the meanwhile, dear
Mary has received no postcards at all, and decide that this omission must
be repaired at earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><i>November 11th.</i>&mdash;Reach Toronto at preposterous hour of 5.55
A.M. and decide against night-travelling once and for ever, day having
actually started with Customs inspection considerably before dawn. Decide
to try and see what I can of Canada and glue my face to the window, but
nothing visible for a long while. Am finally rewarded by superb sunrise,
but eyelids feel curiously stiff and intelligence at lowest possible ebb.
Involve myself in rather profound train of thought regarding dependence
of artistic perception upon physical conditions, but discover in the
midst of it that I am having a nightmare about the children both being
drowned, and have dropped two books and one glove.</p>
<p>Coloured porter appears with clothes-brush, and is evidently convinced
that I cannot possibly present myself to Canadian inspection without
previously submitting to his ministrations. As I feel that he is probably
right, I stand up and am rather half-heartedly dealt with, and then
immediately sit down again, no doubt in original collection of dust, and
weakly present porter with ten cents, at which he merely looks disgusted
and says nothing.</p>
<p>Train stops, and I get out of it, and find myself&mdash;as so often
before&mdash;surrounded by luggage on strange and ice-cold platform, only
too well aware that I probably look even more
<i>d&eacute;gomm&eacute;e</i> than I feel.</p>
<p>Canadian host and hostess, with great good-feeling, have both turned
out to meet me, and am much impressed at seeing that neither cold nor
early rising have impaired complexion of my hostess. Find myself
muttering quotation&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>Alike to her was time or tide,<br>
November's snow, or July's pride&mdash;</i></blockquote>
<p>but Canadian host, Mr. Lee, says Did I speak? and I have to say No,
no, nothing at all, and remind myself that talking aloud to oneself is
well-known preliminary to complete mental breakdown. Make really
desperate effort, decide that I <i>am</i> awake and that the day has
begun&mdash;began, in fact, several hours ago&mdash;and that if only I am
given a cup of very strong coffee quite soon, I shall very likely find
myself restored to normal degree of alertness.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee looks kind; Mrs. Lee&mdash;evidently several years
younger&mdash;is cheerful and good-looking, and leads the way to small
car waiting outside station.</p>
<p>This appears to me to be completely filled already by elderly lady in
black, large dog and little girl with pigtails. These, I am told, are the
near neighbours of the Lees. Should like to ask why this compels them to
turn out at four o'clock in the morning in order to meet complete
stranger, but do not, naturally, do so.</p>
<p>Explanation is presently proffered, to the effect that the Falls of
Niagara are only eighty miles away, and I am to visit them at once, and
the little girl&mdash;Minnie&mdash;has never seen them either, so it
seemed a good opportunity. Minnie, at this, jumps up and down on the seat
and has to be told to Hush, dear. Her mother adds that Minnie is very
highly strung. She always has been, and her mother is afraid she always
will be. The doctor has said that she has, at nine years old, the brain
of a child of fifteen. I look at Minnie, who at once assumes an
interesting expression and puts her head on one side, at which I
immediately look away again, and feel that I am not going to like Minnie.
(This impression definitely gains ground as day goes on.) Mrs. Lee, on
the other hand, earns gratitude almost amounting to affection by saying
that I must have breakfast and a bath before anything else, and that both
these objectives can be attained on the way to Niagara.</p>
<p>I ask what about my luggage? and am told that a friend of some cousins
living near Hamilton has arranged to call for it later and convey it to
Mr. Lee's house. Am impressed, and decide that mutual readiness to oblige
must be a feature of Canadian life. Make mental note to develop this
theme when talking to Women's Institute at home.</p>
<p>At this point Minnie's mother suddenly asks What we are all here for,
if not to help one another, and adds that, for her part, her motto has
always been: Lend a Hand. Revulsion of feeling at once overtakes me, and
I abandon all idea of impressing the Women's Institute with the
desirability of mutual good-will.</p>
<p>Car takes us at great speed along admirable roads&mdash;very tight
squeeze on back seat, and Minnie kicks me twice on the shins and puts her
elbow into my face once&mdash;and we reach house standing amongst
trees.</p>
<p>Is this, I civilly enquire of Mrs. Lee, her home? Oh dear no. The Lees
live right on the other side of Toronto. This is Dr. MacAfie's place,
where we are all having breakfast. And a bath, adds Mrs. L., looking at
me compassionately. Dr. MacAfie and his wife both turn out to be Scotch.
They receive us kindly, and Mrs. L. at once advocates the bathroom for
me.</p>
<p>Bath is a success, and I come down very hungry, convinced that it must
be nearer lunch-time than breakfast-time. Clock, however, declares it to
be just half-past seven. Find myself counting up number of hours that
must elapse before I can hope to find myself in bed and asleep. Results
of this calculation very discouraging.</p>
<p>Breakfast, which is excellent, restores me, and we talk about
America&mdash;the States very unlike Canada&mdash;the
Dominions&mdash;life in Canada very like life in the Old
Country&mdash;snow very early this year and my impressions of Chicago
World Fair.</p>
<p>Minnie interrupts a good deal, and says Need she eat bacon, and If she
went on a big ship to England she knows she'd be very sick. At this
everybody laughs&mdash;mine very perfunctory indeed&mdash;and her mother
says that really, the things that child says...and it's always been like
that, ever since she was a tiny tot. Anecdotes of Minnie's infant
witticisms follow, and I inwardly think of all the much more brilliant
remarks made by Robin and Vicky. Should much like an opportunity for
retailing these, and do my best to find one, but Minnie's mother gives me
no opening whatever.</p>
<p>Expedition to Niagara ensues, and I am told on the way that it is
important for me to see the Falls from the <i>Canadian</i> side, as this
is greatly superior to the <i>American</i> side. Can understand this, in
a way, as representing viewpoint of my present hosts, but hope that
inhabitants of Buffalo, where I go next, will not prove equally patriotic
and again conduct me immense distances to view phenomenon all over
again.</p>
<p>Am, however, greatly impressed by Falls, and say so freely. Mr. Lee
tells me that I really ought to see them by night, when lit up by
electricity, and Mrs. Lee says No, that vulgarises them completely, and I
reply Yes to both of them, and Minnie's mother asks What Minnie thinks of
Niagara, to which Minnie squeaks out that she wants her dinner right away
this minute, and we accordingly proceed to the Hotel.</p>
<p>Buy a great many postcards. Minnie watches this transaction closely,
and says that she collects postcards. At this I very weakly present her
with one of mine, and her mother says that I am really much too
kind&mdash;with which I inwardly agree. This opinion intensified on
return journey, when Minnie decides to sit on my lap, and asks me long
series of complicated questions, such as Would I rather be an alligator
who didn't eat people, or a man who had to make his living by stealing,
or a tiny midget in a circus? Reply to these and similar conundrums more
or less in my sleep, and dimly hear Minnie's mother telling me that
Minnie looks upon her as being just a great, big, elder sister, and
always tells her everything just as it pops into her little head, and
don't I feel that it's most important to have the complete confidence of
one's children?</p>
<p>Can only think, at the moment, that it's most important to have a
proper amount of sleep.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee's house is eventually attained, and proves to be outside
Toronto. Minnie and her parent are dropped at their own door, and say
that they will be popping in quite soon, and I get out of car and
discover that I am alarmingly stiff, very cold, and utterly
exhausted.</p>
<p>Am obliged to confess this state of affairs to Mrs. Lee, who is very
kind, and advises bed. Can only apologise, and do as she suggests.</p>
<p><i>November 12th.</i>&mdash;Spend comparatively quiet day, and feel
better. Host and hostess agree that I must remain indoors, and as it
snows violently I thankfully do so, and write very much overdue
letters.</p>
<p>Quiet afternoon and evening of conversation. Mr. Lee wants to know
about the Royal Family&mdash;of which, unfortunately, I can tell him
little except what he can read for himself in the papers&mdash;and Mrs.
Lee asks if I play much Bridge. She doesn't, she adds hastily, mean on
Sundays. Am obliged to reply that I play very little on any day of the
week, but try to improve this answer by adding that my husband is very
good at cards. Then, says Mrs. Lee, do I garden? No&mdash;unfortunately
not. Mrs. Lee seems disappointed, but supposes indulgently that writing a
book takes up quite a lot of time, and I admit that it does, and we leave
it at that.</p>
<p>Am rather disposed, after this effort, to sit and ponder on extreme
difficulty of ever achieving continuity of conversation when in the
society of complete strangers. Idle fancy crosses my mind that Mr.
Alexander Woollcott would make nothing of it at all, and probably conduct
whole conversation all by himself with complete success.
Wonder&mdash;still more idly&mdash;if I shall send him a postcard about
it, and whether he would like one of Niagara.</p>
<p><i>November 12th.</i> (continued).&mdash;Main purpose of Canadian
visit&mdash;which is small lecture&mdash;safely accomplished. Audience
kind, rather than enthusiastic. Mrs. Lee says that she could tell I was
nervous. Cannot imagine more thoroughly discouraging comment than
this.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee very kindly takes me to visit tallest building in the British
Empire, which turns out to be a Bank. We inspect Board-rooms, offices,
and finally vaults, situated in basement and behind enormous steel doors,
said to weigh incredible number of tons and only to be opened by two
people working in conjunction. I ask to go inside, and am aghast when I
do so by alarming notice on the wall which tells me that if I get shut
into the vaults by accident I am not to be alarmed, as there is a supply
of air for several hours. Do not at all like the word "several", which is
far from being sufficiently specific, and have horrid visions of being
shut into the vaults and spending my time there in trying to guess
exactly when "several" may be supposed to be drawing to an end. Enquire
whether anyone has ever been locked into the vaults, and if they came out
mad, but Mr. Lee only replies No one that he has ever heard of, and
appears quite unmoved by the idea.</p>
<p>Have often associated banking with callousness, and now perceive how
right I was.</p>
<p>Evening is passed agreeably with the Lees until 9 o'clock, when Minnie
and parent descend upon us and we all talk about Minnie for about half an
hour. Take cast-iron resolution before I sleep never to make either of
the dear children subjects of long conversations with strangers.</p>
<p><i>(Mem.:</i> To let Robert know of this resolution, as feel sure he
would approve of it.)</p>
<p><i>November 13th.</i>&mdash;Five o'clock train is selected to take me
to Buffalo, and am surprised and relieved to find that I have not got to
travel all night, but shall arrive in four and a half hours.
Luncheon-party is kindly given in my honour by the Lees&mdash;Minnie not
present, but is again quoted extensively by her mother&mdash;and I am
asked more than once for opinion on relative merits of Canada and the
United States. Can quite see that this is very delicate ground, and have
no intention whatever of committing myself to definite statement on the
point. Talk instead about English novelists&mdash;Kipling evidently very
popular, and Hugh Walpole looked upon as interesting new
discovery&mdash;and I am told by several people that I ought to go to
Quebec.</p>
<p>As it is now impossible for me to do so, this leads to very little,
beyond repeated assurances from myself that I should <i>like</i> to go to
Quebec, and am exceedingly sorry not to be going there. One well-informed
lady tells me that Harold Nicolson went there and liked it very much.
Everybody receives this in respectful silence, and I feel that Harold
Nicolson has completely deflated whatever wind there may ever have been
in my sails.</p>
<p>Morale is restored later by my host, who takes me aside and says that
I have been Just a breath of fresh air from the Old Country, and that I
must come again next year. Am touched, and recklessly say that I will.
Everyone says good-bye very kindly, and gentleman hitherto
unknown&mdash;tells me that he will drive me to the station, as he has to
go in that direction later. Minnie's mother heaps coals of fire on my
head by telling me that she has a little present for my children, and is
going just across the street to get it. This she does, and present turns
out to be a Service revolver, which she thinks my boy may like. Can reply
with perfect truth that I feel sure of it, and am fortunately not asked
for my own reaction; or Robert's.</p>
<p>Revolver, of which I am secretly a good deal afraid, is wedged with
the utmost difficulty into the least crowded corner of my
attach&eacute;-case, and I take my departure.</p>
<p>Rather strange sequel follows a good deal later, when I am having
dinner on train and am called out to speak to Customs official. Cannot
imagine what he wants me for, and alarming visions of Sing-Sing assail me
instantly. Go so far as to decide that I shall try and brief Mr. Clarence
Darrow for the defence&mdash;but this probably because he is the only
American barrister whose name I can remember.</p>
<p>Customs awaits me in the corridor, and looks very grave. Is mine, he
enquires, the brown attach&eacute;-case under the fur coat in the
parlour-car? Yes, it is. Then why, may he ask, do I find it necessary to
travel with a revolver? Freakish impulse momentarily assails me, and I
nearly&mdash;but not quite&mdash;reply that I have to do so for the
protection of my virtue. Realise in time that this flippancy would be
quite out of place, and might very likely land me in serious trouble, so
take wiser and more straightforward course of telling Customs the whole
story of the Service revolver.</p>
<p>He receives it sympathetically, and tells me that he is a family man
himself. (Association here with Dickens&mdash;"I'm a mother myself, Mr.
Copperfull"&mdash;but Customs perhaps not literary, or may prefer Mark
Twain, so keep it to myself.)</p>
<p>Conversation follows, in which I learn names and ages of the whole
family of Customs, and in return show him small snapshot of Robin and
Vicky with dog Kolynos, playing in the garden. Customs says That's a fine
dog, and asks what breed, but says nothing about R. and V. Am slightly
disappointed, but have noticed similar indifference to the children of
others on the part of parents before.</p>
<p><i>November 13th</i> (continued).&mdash;Train, in the most singular
way, arrives at Buffalo ahead of time. Large and very handsome station
receives me, and I walk about vast hall, which I seem to have entirely to
myself. Red-capped porter, who is looking after my luggage, seems
prepared to remain by it for ever in a fatalistic kind of way, and
receives with indifference my announcement that Someone will be here to
meet me by and by.</p>
<p>Can only hope I am speaking the truth, but feel doubtful as time goes
on. Presently, however, tall lady in furs appears, and looks all round
her, and I say "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" but not aloud&mdash;and
approach her. Am I, I ask, speaking to Mrs. Walker? Lady, in a most
uncertain voice, replies No, no&mdash;not Mrs. <i>Walker.</i> We gaze at
one another helplessly and she adds, in a still more uncertain voice:
Mrs. Luella White Clarkson. To this I can think of no better reply than
Oh, and we walk away from one another in silence, only, however, to meet
again repeatedly in our respective perambulations. (Should much like to
know what peculiar law governs this state of affairs. Station is
perfectly enormous, and practically empty, and neither Mrs. L. W. C. nor
myself has the slightest wish ever again to come face to face with one
another, yet we seem perfectly unable to avoid doing so. Eventually take
to turning my back whenever I see her approaching, and walking smartly in
the opposite direction.)</p>
<p>Mental comparison of American and English railway stations follows,
and am obliged to admit that America wins hands down. Have never in my
life discovered English station that was warm, clean or quiet, or at
which waiting entailed anything but complete physical misery. Compose
long letter to Sir Felix Pole on the subject, and have just been publicly
thanked by the Lord Mayor of London for ensuing reformations, when I
perceive Red-cap making signs. Mrs. Walker&mdash;small lady in black,
very smart, and no resemblance whatever to Mrs. L. W. C.&mdash;has
appeared. She apologises very nicely for being late, and I
apologise&mdash;I hope also very nicely&mdash;for the train's having been
to early&mdash;and we get into her motor which is, as usual, very large
and magnificent. (Remarkable contrast between cars to which I am by now
becoming accustomed and ancient Standard so frequently pushed up the
hills at home&mdash;but have little doubt that I shall be delighted to
find myself in old Standard once more.)</p>
<p>Have I, Mrs. Walker instantly enquires, visited the Falls of Niagara?
Am obliged to admit, feeling apologetic, that I have. Thank God for that,
she surprisingly returns. We then embark on conversation, and I tell her
about Canada, and make rather good story out of preposterous child
Minnie. Mrs. Walker is appreciative, and we get on well.</p>
<p>Buffalo is under snow, and bitterly cold. House, however, delightfully
warm, as usual. Mrs. Walker hopes that I won't mind a small room: I
perceive that the whole of drawing-room, dining-room and Robert's study
could easily be fitted inside it, and that it has a bath-room opening out
of one end and a sitting-room the other, and say, Oh no, not in the
least.</p>
<p>She then leaves me to rest.</p>
<p><i>November 14th.</i>&mdash;Clothes having emerged more crumpled than
ever from repeated packings, I ask if they could be ironed, and this is
forthwith done by competent maid, who tells me what I know only too well
already, that best black-and-white evening dress has at one time been
badly stained by coffee, and will never really look the same again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Walker takes me for a drive, and we see as much of Buffalo as is
compatible with its being almost altogether under snow, and she asks me
rather wistfully if I can tell her anything about celebrated English
woman pianist who once stayed with her for a fortnight and was charming,
but has never answered any letters since. Am disgusted with the
ingratitude of my distinguished countrywoman, and invent explanations
about her having been ill, and probably forbidden by the doctor to attend
to any correspondence whatever.</p>
<p>Mrs. Walker receives this without demur, but wears faintly cynical
expression, and am by no means convinced that she has been taken in by
it, especially as she tells me later on that when in London a year ago
she rang up distinguished pianist, who had apparently great difficulty in
remembering who she was. Feel extremely ashamed of this depth of
ingratitude, contrast it with extraordinary kindness and hospitality
proffered to English visitors by American hosts, and hope that someone
occasionally returns some of it.</p>
<p>Become apprehensive towards afternoon, when Mrs. W. tells me that the
Club at which I am to lecture has heard all the best-known European
speakers, at one time or another, and is composed of highly cultivated
members.</p>
<p>Revise my lecture frantically, perceive that it is totally lacking in
cultivation, or even ordinary evidences of intelligence, and ask Mrs. W.
whether she doesn't think the Club would like a reading instead. Have no
real hope that this will succeed, nor does it. Nothing for it but to put
on my newly ironed blue, powder my nose, and go.</p>
<p>Mrs. W. is considerate, and does not attempt conversation on the way,
except when she once says that she hopes I can eat oysters. Feel it
highly improbable that I shall be able to eat anything again, and hear
myself muttering for sole reply: <i>"Who knows but the world may end
to-night?"</i></p>
<p>World, needless to say, does not end, and I have to pull myself
together, meet a great many Club members&mdash;alert expressions and very
expensive clothes&mdash;and subsequently mount small platform on which
stand two chairs, table and reading-desk.</p>
<p>Elderly lady in grey takes the chair&mdash;reminds me of Robert's Aunt
Eleanor, but cannot say why&mdash;and says that she is not going to speak
for more than a few moments. Everyone, she knows, is looking forward to
hearing something far more interesting than any words of <i>hers</i> can
be. At this she glances benevolently towards me, and I smile modestly,
and wish I could drop down in a fit and be taken away on the spot.
Instead, I have presently to get on to my feet and adjust small sheet of
notes&mdash;now definitely looking crumpled and dirty&mdash;on to
reading-desk.</p>
<p>Head, as usual, gets very hot, and feet very cold, and am badly thrown
off my balance by very ancient lady who sits in the front row and holds
her hand to her ear throughout, as if unable to hear a word I utter.
This, however, evidently not the case, as she comes up afterwards and
tells me that she was one of the Club's original members, and has never
missed a single lecture. Offer her my congratulations on this
achievement, and then wish I hadn't, as it sounds conceited, and add that
I hope she has found it worth the trouble. She replies rather doubtfully
Yes&mdash;on the whole, Yes&mdash;and refers to Andr&eacute; Maurois.
<i>His</i> lecture was positively brilliant. I reply, truthfully, that I
feel sure it was, and we part. Aunt Eleanor and I exchange polite
speeches&mdash;I meet various ladies, one of whom tells me that she knows
a great friend of mine. Rose, I suggest? No, not Rose. Dear Katherine
Ellen Blatt, who is at present in New York, but hopes to be in Boston
when I am. She has, says the lady, a perfectly lovely personality. And
she has been saying the most wonderful things about <i>me.</i> Try to
look more grateful than I really feel, over this.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Does not public life, even on a small scale, distinctly
lead in the direction of duplicity? <i>Answer:</i> Unfortunately,
Yes.)</p>
<p>Aunt Eleanor now approaches and says&mdash;as usual&mdash;that she
knows an Englishwoman can't do without her tea, and that some is now
awaiting me. Am touched by this evidence of thoughtfulness, and drink
tea&mdash;which is much too strong&mdash;and eat cinnamon toast, to which
I am by no means accustomed, and which reminds me very painfully of
nauseous drug frequently administered to Vicky by Mademoiselle.</p>
<p>Conversation with Aunt Eleanor ensues. She does not, herself, write
books, she says, but those who do have always had a strange fascination
for her. She has often <i>thought</i> of writing a book&mdash;many of her
friends have implored her to do so, in fact&mdash;but no, she finds it
impossible to begin. And yet, there are many things in her life about
which whole, entire novels might well be written. Everybody devotes a
moment of rather awed silence to conjecturing the nature of Aunt
Eleanor's singular experiences, and anti-climax is felt to have ensued
when small lady in rather frilly frock suddenly announces in a pipy voice
that she has a boy cousin, living in Oklahoma, who once wrote something
for the <i>New Yorker,</i> but they didn't ever publish it.</p>
<p>This more or less breaks u the party, and Mrs. Walker drives me home
again, and says in a rather exhausted way that she thanks Heaven that's
over.</p>
<p>We talk about Aunt Eleanor&mdash;she has been twice married, one
husband died and the other one left her, but no divorce&mdash;and she has
two daughters but neither of them live at home. Can quite understand it,
and say so. Mrs. Walker assents mildly, which encourages me to add that I
didn't take to Aunt Eleanor much. No, says Mrs. Walker thoughtfully, she
doesn't really think that Aunt E. and I would ever get on together very
well.</p>
<p>Am quite surprised and hurt at this, and realise that, though I am
quite prepared to dislike Aunt Eleanor, I find it both unjust and
astonishing that she should be equally repelled by me. Rather interesting
side-light on human nature thrown here, and have dim idea of going into
the whole thing later, preferably with Rose&mdash;always so well
informed&mdash;or dear Mary Kellway, full of intelligence, even though
unable to write legibly&mdash;but this probably owing to stress of life
in country parish, so much more crowded with activities than any other
known form of existence.</p>
<p>Dinner-party closes the day, and I put on backless evening dress, add
coatee, take coatee off again, look at myself with mirror and hand-glass
in conjunction, resume coatee, and retain it for the rest of the
evening.</p>
<p><i>November 15th.</i>&mdash;Weather gets colder and colder as I
approach Boston, and this rouses prejudice in me, together with repeated
assurances from everybody I meet to the effect that Boston is the most
English town in America, and I shall simply adore it. Feel quite unlike
adoration as train takes me through snowy country, and affords glimpses
of towns that appear to be entirely composed of Gasoline Stations and
Motion-Picture Theatres. Towards nine-o'clock in the morning I have an
excellent breakfast&mdash;food in America definitely a very bright
spot&mdash;and return to railway carriage, where I see familiar figure,
hat still worn at very dashing angle, and recognise Pete. Feel as if I
had met my oldest friend, in the middle of a crowd of strangers, and we
greet one another cordially. Pete tells me that I seem to be standing up
to it pretty well&mdash;which I take to be a compliment to my powers of
endurance&mdash;and unfolds terrific programme of the activities he has
planned for me in Boston.</p>
<p>Assent to everything, but add that the thing I want to do most of all
is to visit the Alcott House at Concord, Mass. At this Pete looks
astounded, and replies that this is, he supposes, merely a personal
fancy, and so far as he knows no time for anything of that kind has been
allowed in the schedule. Am obliged to agree that it probably hasn't, but
repeat that I really want to do that more than anything else in America.
(Much later on, compose eloquent and convincing speech, to the effect
that I have worked very hard and done all that was required of me, and
that I am fully entitled to gratify my own wishes for one afternoon at
least. Am quite clear that if I had only said all this at the time, Pete
would have been left without a leg to stand upon. Unfortunately, however,
I do not do so.)</p>
<p>Boston is reached&mdash;step out of the train into the iciest cold
that it has ever been my lot to encounter&mdash;and am immediately
photographed by unknown man carrying camera and unpleasant little
light-bulb which he flashes unexpectedly into my eyes. No one makes the
slightest comment on this proceeding, and am convinced that he has
mistaken me for somebody quite different.</p>
<p>Two young creatures from the <i>Boston Transcript</i> meet me, and
enquire, more or less instantly, what I feel about the Problem of the
American Woman, but Pete, with great good-feeling, suggests that we
should discuss it all in taxi on our way to Hotel, which we do. One of
them then hands me a cable&mdash;(announcing death of Robin or
Vicky?)&mdash;and says it arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Cable says, in effect, that I must at all costs get into touch with
Caroline Concannon's dear friend and cousin Mona, who lives in Pinckney
Street, would love to meet me, has been written to, everything all right
at flat, love from Caroline.</p>
<p>Am quite prepared to get into touch with dear friend and cousin, but
say nothing to Pete about it, for fear of similar disconcerting reaction
to that produced by suggestion of visiting Alcott House.</p>
<p>Am conducted to nice little Hotel in Charles Street, and told once by
Pete, and twice by each of the <i>Boston Transcript</i> young ladies,
that r am within a stone's-throw of the Common Chief association with the
Common is <i>An Old-Fashioned Girl,</i> in which heroine goes
tobogganing, but do not refer to this, and merely reply that That is very
nice. So it may be, but not at the moment when Common, besides being deep
in snow, is quite evidently being searched from end to end by ice-laden
north-east wind.</p>
<p>Pete, with firmness to which I am by now accustomed, says that he will
leave me to unpack but come and fetch me again in an hour's time, to
visit customary book-shops.</p>
<p>Telephone bell in sitting-room soon afterwards rings, and it appears
that dear Rose&mdash;like Caroline Concannon&mdash;has a friend in
Boston, and that the friend is downstairs and proposes to come up right
away and see me. I say Yes, yes, and I shall be delighted, and hastily
shut suit-cases which I have this moment opened, and look at myself in
the glass instead.</p>
<p>Results of this inspection are far from encouraging, but nothing can
be done about it now, and can only concentrate on trying to remember
everything that Rose has ever told me about her Boston friend called, I
believe, Fanny Mason. Sum-total of my recollections is that the friend is
very literary, and has written a good deal, and travelled all over the
world, and is very critical.</p>
<p>Am rather inclined to become agitated by all this, but friend appears,
and has the good-feeling to keep these disquieting attributes well out of
sight, and concentrate on welcoming me very kindly to
Boston&mdash;(exactly like England and all English people always love it
on that account)&mdash;and enquiring affectionately about Rose. (Am
disgusted to learn from what she says that dear Rose has written to her
far more recently, as well as at much greater length, than to myself.
Shall have a good deal to say to Rose when we meet again.)</p>
<p>Friend then announces that she has A Girl downstairs. The Girl has
brought a car, and is going to show me Boston this morning, take me to
lunch at a Women's Club, and to a tea later. This more than kind, but
also definitely disconcerting in view of arrangements made by Pete, and I
say Oh, Miss Mason&mdash;and then stop, rather like heroine of a
Victorian novel.</p>
<p>Miss M. at once returns that I must not dream of calling her anything
but Fanny. She has heard of me for years and years, and we are already
old friends. This naturally calls for thanks and acknowledgments on my
part, and I then explain that publishers' representative is in Boston,
and calling for me in an hour's time, which I'm afraid means that I
cannot take advantage of kind offer.</p>
<p>Miss M.&mdash;Fanny&mdash;undefeated, and says it is Important that I
should see Boston, no one who has not done so can be said to know
anything whatever about America, and The Girl is waiting for me
downstairs. Suggest&mdash;mostly in order to gain time&mdash;that The
Girl should be invited to come up, and this is done by telephone.</p>
<p>She turns out to be very youthful and good-looking blonde, introduced
to me as "Leslie"&mdash;(first names evidently the fashion in
Boston)&mdash;and says she is prepared to take me anywhere in the world,
more or less, at any moment.</p>
<p>Explain all over again about Pete and the booksellers. Fanny remains
adamant, but Leslie says reasonably: What about tomorrow instead, and I
advance cherished scheme for visiting Alcott House. This, it appears, is
fraught with difficulties, as Alcott House is impenetrably shut at this
time of year. Feel that if Pete comes to hear of this, my last hope is
gone. Leslie looks rather sorry for me, and says perhaps something could
be arranged, but anyway I had better come out now and see Boston. Fanny
is also urgent on this point, and I foresee deadlock, when telephone
rings and Pete is announced, and is told to come upstairs.</p>
<p>Brilliant idea then strikes me; I introduce everybody, and tell Pete
that there has been rather a clash of arrangements, but that doubtless he
and Miss Mason can easily settle it between themselves. Will they, in the
meanwhile, excuse me, as I positively must see about my unpacking?
Retreat firmly into the bedroom to do so, but spend some of the time with
ear glued to the wall, trying to ascertain whether Pete and Miss
M.&mdash;both evidently very strong personalities&mdash;are going to fly
at one another's throats or not. Voices are certainly definitely raised,
usually both at once, but nothing more formidable happens, and I hope
that physical violence may be averted.</p>
<p>Decide that on the whole I am inclined to back Pete, as possessing
rock-like quality of immovability once his mind is made
up&mdash;doubtless very useful asset in dealing with authors, publishers
and so on.</p>
<p>Subsequent events prove that I am right, and Pete walks me to
book-shop, with laconic announcement to Leslie and Miss
M.&mdash;Fanny&mdash;that I shall beat their disposal by 12.30.</p>
<p><i>November 16th.</i>&mdash;Most extraordinary revolution in
everybody's outlook&mdash;excepting my own&mdash;by communication from
Mr. Alexander Woollcott. He has, it appears, read in a paper <i>(Boston
Transcript?)</i> that my whole object in coming to America was to visit
the Alcott House, and of this he approves to such an extent that he is
prepared to Mention It in a Radio Talk, if I will immediately inform him
of my reactions to the expedition.</p>
<p>Entire <i>volte-face</i> now takes place in attitude of Pete, Fanny
and everybody else. If Alexander Woollcott thinks I ought to visit Alcott
House, it apparently becomes essential that I should do so and Heaven and
earth must, if necessary, be moved in order to enable me to. Am much
impressed by the remarkable difference between enterprise that I merely
want to undertake for my own satisfaction, and the same thing when it is
advocated by Mr. A. W.</p>
<p>Result of it all is that the members of the Alcott-Pratt family are
approached, they respond with the greatest kindness, and offer to open
the house especially for my benefit. Fanny says that Leslie will drive me
out to Concord on Sunday afternoon, and she will herself accompany us,
not in order to view Alcott House&mdash;she does not want to see it,
which rather shocks me&mdash;but to visit a relation of her own living
there. Pete does not associate himself personally with the expedition, as
he will by that time have gone to New York, Charleston, Oshkosh or some
other distant spot&mdash;but it evidently meets with his warmest
approval, and his last word to me is an injunction to take paper and
pencil with me and send account of my impressions red-hot to Mr.
Alexander Woollcott.</p>
<p><i>November 18th.</i>&mdash;Go to see football game, Harvard v. Army.
Am given to understand&mdash;and can readily believe&mdash;that this is a
privilege for which Presidents, Crowned Heads and Archbishops would one
and all give ten years of life at the very least. It has only been
obtained for me by the very greatest exertions on the part of
everybody.</p>
<p>Fanny says that I shall be frozen&mdash;(can well believe it) but that
it will be worth it, and Leslie thinks I may find it rather difficult to
follow&mdash;but it will be worth it&mdash;and they both agree that there
is always a risk of pneumonia in this kind of weather. Wonder if they are
going to add that it will still be worth it, because if so, shall
disagree with them forcibly&mdash;but they heap coals of fire on my head
for this unworthy thought by offering to lend me rugs, furs, mufflers and
overshoes. Escort has been provided for me in the person of an admirer of
Fanny's&mdash;name unknown to me from first to last&mdash;and we set out
together at one o'clock. Harvard stadium is enormous&mdash;no roof, which
I think a mistake&mdash;and we sit in open air, and might be comfortable
if temperature would only rise above zero. Fanny's admirer is extremely
kind to me, and can only hope he isn't thinking all the time how much
pleasanter it would be if he were only escorting Fanny instead.</p>
<p>(Reminiscence here of once-popular song: <i>I am dancing with tears in
my eyes 'Cos the girl in my arms isn't you.</i> Have always felt this
attitude rather hard on girl actually being danced with at the moment of
singing.)</p>
<p>Ask questions that I hope sound fairly intelligent, and listen
attentively to the answers. Escort in return then paralyses me by putting
to me various technical points in regard to what he calls the English
Game. Try frantically to recall everything that I can ever remember
having heard from Robin, but am only able to recollect that he once said
Soccer was absolutely lousy and that I rebuked him for it. Translate this
painful reminiscence into civilised version to the effect that Rugger is
more popular than Soccer with Our Schoolboys.</p>
<p>Presently a mule appears and is ridden round the field by a member of
one team or the other&mdash;am not sure which&mdash;and I observe,
idiotically, that It's like a Rodeo&mdash;and immediately perceive that
it isn't in the least, and wish I hadn't spoken. Fortunately a number of
young gentlemen in white suddenly emerge on to the ground, turn beautiful
back somersaults in perfect unison, and cheer madly through a megaphone.
Am deeply impressed, and assure Fanny's admirer that we have, nothing in
the least like that at Wembley, Twickenham, nor, so far as I know,
anywhere else. He agrees, very solemnly, that the cheers are a Great
Feature of the Game.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards we really get started, and I watch my first game of
American football. Players all extensively padded and vast numbers of
substitute-players wait about in order to rush in and replace them when
necessary. Altogether phenomenal number of these exchanges takes place,
but as no stretchers visible, conclude that most of the injuries received
fall short of being mortal.</p>
<p>Fanny's admirer gives me explanations about what is taking place from
time to time, but is apt to break off in the middle of a phrase when
excitement overcomes him. Other interruptions are occasioned by organised
yellings and roarings, conducted from the field, in which the spectators
join.</p>
<p>At about four o'clock it is said to be obvious that Harvard hasn't got
a chance, and soon afterwards the Army is declared to have won.</p>
<p>Escort and I look at each other and say Well, and Wasn't it
marvellous? and then stand up, and I discover that I am quite unable to
feel my feet at all, and that all circulation in the rest of my body has
apparently stopped altogether&mdash;probably frozen.</p>
<p>We totter as best we can through the crowd&mdash;escort evidently just
as cold as I am, judging by the colour of his face and hands&mdash;and
over bridge, past buildings that I am told are all part of the College,
and to flat with attractive view across the river. As I have not been
warned by anybody that this is in store, I remain unaware throughout why
I am being entertained there, or by whom. Hot tea, for once, is
extraordinarily welcome, and so is superb log-fire; and I talk to
unknown, but agreeable, American about President Roosevelt, the state of
the dollar&mdash;we both take a gloomy view of this&mdash;and extreme
beauty of American foliage in the woods of Maine&mdash;where I have never
set foot, but about which I have heard a good deal.</p>
<p><i>November 19th.</i>&mdash;Expedition to Concord&mdash;now smiled
upon by all, owing to intervention of dear Alexander W.&mdash;takes
place, and definitely ranks in my own estimation higher than anything
else I have done in America.</p>
<p>All is snow, silence and loveliness, with frame-houses standing
amongst trees, and no signs of either picture-houses, gasoline-stations,
or hot-dog stalls. Can think of nothing but <i>Little Women,</i> and
visualise scene after scene from well-remembered and beloved book. Fanny,
sympathetic, but insensible to appeal of <i>Little Women,</i> is taken on
to see her relations, and I remain with Mrs. Pratt, surviving relative of
Miss Alcott, and another elderly lady, both kind and charming and
prepared to show me everything there is to see.</p>
<p>Could willingly remain there for hours and hours.</p>
<p>Time, however, rushes by with its usual speed when I am absorbed and
happy, and I am obliged to make my farewells, collect postcards and
pictures with which I have most kindly been presented, and book given me
for Vicky which I shall, I know, be seriously tempted to keep for
myself.</p>
<p>Can think of nothing but the March family for the remainder of the
day, and am much annoyed at being reminded by Fanny and Leslie that
whatever happens, I must send my impressions to Mr. Alexander Woollcott
without delay.</p>
<p><i>November 20th.</i>&mdash;Just as day of my departure from Boston
arrives, weather relents and suddenly becomes quite mild. I go and call
on Caroline Concannon's friend, and am much taken with her. She has no
party, which is a great relief, and we talk about England and C. C. Very
amusing and good company, says the friend, and I agree, and add that
Caroline is looking after my flat during my absence. Slight misgiving
crosses my mind as to the literal accuracy of this statement, but this
perhaps ungenerous, and make amends by saying that she is Very Good with
Children&mdash;which is perfectly true.</p>
<p>Walk back across Common, and see very pretty brick houses, Queen Anne
style. Old mauve glass in many window-panes, but notice cynically that
these always appear in ground-floor windows, where they can be most
easily admired by the passers-by.</p>
<p>Decide that this is certainly a good moment for taking Rose's advice
to buy myself a Foundation Garment in America, as they understand these
things, says Rose, much better than we do in England. I accordingly enter
a shop and find elderly saleswoman, who disconcerts me by saying in a
sinister way that I certainly can't wear the ordinary suspender-belt,
that's very evident. She supplies me with one that is, I suppose, removed
from the ordinary, and her last word is an injunction to me not to forget
that whatever I do, I mustn't wear an ordinary belt. It'll be the
complete ruin of my figure if I do. Depart, in some dejection.</p>
<p>Shock awaits me on return to Hotel when I discover that Miss Katherine
Ellen Blatt has just arrived, and has sent up a note to my room to say
so. It will, she writes, be so delightful to meet again, she revelled in
our last delightful talk and is longing for another. Entertain myself for
some little while in composing imaginary replies to this, but candour, as
usual, is obliged to give, way to civility, and I write very brief reply
suggesting that K. E. B. and I should meet in the hall for a moment
before my train leaves when she, Fanny Mason&mdash;whom she doubtless
knows already&mdash;and Leslie will all be privileged to see one
another.</p>
<p>Customary preoccupation with my appearance follows, and I go in search
of hotel Beauty-parlour. Intelligent young operator deals with me, and
says that one of her fellow-workers is also British and would be very
happy to meet me. My English accent, she adds thoughtfully, is a prettier
one than hers. This definitely no overstatement, as fellow-worker turns
out to be from Huddersfield and talks with strong North-country
accent.</p>
<p>On return to ground floor&mdash;hair at least clean and
wavy&mdash;Miss Blatt materialises. She greets me as an old and dear
friend and tells me that one or two perfectly lovely women of her
acquaintance are just crazy to meet me, and are coming to a Tea in the
hotel this very afternoon in order that they may have the pleasure of
doing so.</p>
<p>I thank her, express gratification and regret, and explain firmly that
I am going on to Washington this afternoon. Oh, returns Miss Blatt very
blithely indeed, I don't have to give that a thought. She has taken it up
with my publishers by telephone, and they quite agree with her that the
contacts she has arranged for me are very, very important, and I can
easily make the ten-thirty train instead of the six, and reach Washington
in plenty of time.</p>
<p>All presence of mind deserts me, and I say Yes, and Very Well, to
everything, and soon afterwards find myself suggesting that Miss Blatt
should lunch at my table.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Why? Answer: comes there none.)</p>
<p>Lunch proves definitely informative: Miss Blatt tells me about dear
Beverley Nichols, who has just sent her a copy of his new book, and dear
Anne Parrish, who hasn't yet sent a copy of hers, but is certainly going
to do so. I say Yes, and How Splendid, and wonder what Miss Blatt can be
like when she is all by herself, with no celebrities within miles, and no
telephone. Strange idea crosses my mind that in such circumstances she
would probably hardly exist as a personality at all, and might actually
dissolve into nothingness. Something almost metaphysical in this train of
thought, and am rather impressed by it myself, but cannot, naturally, ask
Miss Blatt to share in my admiration.</p>
<p>Talk to her instead about murder stories, which I like, and instance
Mrs. Belloc Lowndes as a favourite of mine. Miss Blatt says No, murder
stories make no appeal to her whatever, but Mrs. Belloc
Lowndes&mdash;Marie&mdash;is one of her very dearest friends. So is
another Marie&mdash;Queen of Roumania. So, oddly enough, is Marie
Tempest.</p>
<p>On this note we part, before K. E. B. has time to think of anybody
else whose name happens to be Marie.</p>
<p>Am obliged to extract red frock from suit-case, in which I have
already carefully folded it&mdash;but perhaps not as carefully as I
hoped, as it comes out distinctly creased&mdash;and put it on in honour
of Miss Blatt's tea. This duly takes place, and is handsomely attended,
Miss B. no doubt as well known in Boston as in New York, London, Paris
and Hong Kong. Am gratified at seeing Caroline C.'s charming friend, and
should like to talk to her, but am given no opportunity.</p>
<p>Very large lady in black pins me into a corner, tells me to sit down,
and takes her seat beside me on small sofa. She then tells me all about a
local literary society, of which she is herself the foundress and the
president, called the Little Thinkers. (Can only hope that in original
days when name of club was chosen, this may have been less ironical than
it is now.) President&mdash;hope with all my heart that she hasn't
guessed my thoughts&mdash;adds that they chose to call themselves Little
Thinkers because it indicates modesty. They are none of them, she
explains, really Deep and Profound&mdash;not like Darwin or
Huxley&mdash;(I make effort&mdash;not good&mdash;to look surprised and
incredulous at this). But they all like to <i>think,</i> and to ask
themselves questions. They read, if she may say so, very deeply. And they
meet and Discuss Things every Tuesday afternoon. Had I been staying here
rather longer, says President, the Little Thinkers would have been only
too pleased to invite me as Guest of Honour to one of their meetings, and
perhaps I would have given them a short talk on the Real Meaning of
Life.</p>
<p>Should like to reply flippantly: Perhaps and Perhaps Not&mdash;but
President of the Little Thinkers evidently no good subject for wit of
this description, so express instead respectful regret that time will not
allow me to avail myself of the suggested privilege.</p>
<p>Moment, it now seems to me, has definitely arrived for both the
President of the L. T.s and myself to move gracefully away from one
another and each talk to somebody else. This turns out to be not easy of
accomplishment, as President is between me and the rest of the world, and
seems not to know how to get away, though am morally convinced that she
would give quite a lot to be able to do so. We continue to look at one
another and to say the same things over and over again in slightly
different words, and I see Katherine Ellen Blatt eyeing me rather
severely from the far end of the room, and evidently feeling&mdash;with
justice&mdash;that I am not doing my fair share towards making a success
of the party.</p>
<p>At last become desperate, say Well, in a frantic way, and rise to my
feet. President of the L. T.s immediately leaps to hers&mdash;looking
unspeakably relieved&mdash;and we exchange apologetic smiles and turn our
backs on one another.</p>
<p><i>(Mem.:</i> Surely very interesting statistics might be collected
with regard to the number of such social problems and varying degrees of
difficulty with which these can, or cannot, be solved? Would willingly
contribute small <i>expos&eacute;</i> of my own, to any such
symposium.<i>Query:</i> Approach Lord Beaverbrook on the point, or not?
Sunday papers frequently very dull, and topics raised by correspondents
often tedious to the last degree.)</p>
<p>Catch the eye of Caroline C.'s friend, Mona, and am delighted and
prepare to go and talk to her, but Miss Blatt immediately stops me and
says that I must meet a very old friend of hers, Mr. Joseph Ross, who has
lived for fifty-three years in America.</p>
<p>Take this to imply that he once lived somewhere else, and after a few
words have no difficulty in guessing that this was Scotland. Refer to it
rather timidly&mdash;who knows what reasons Mr. J. R. may have had for
leaving his native land?&mdash;but he tells me rather disconcertingly
that he goes home once in every two years, and merely lives in America
because the climate suits him. I say Yes, it's very dry, and we both look
out of the window, and Mr. Joseph Ross&mdash;rather to my relief&mdash;is
taken away from me by a strange lady, who smiles at me winningly and says
that I mustn't mind, as millions of people are just waiting for a chance
to talk to me, and it isn't fair of Uncle Joe to monopolise me. Am struck
by this flattering, if inaccurate, way of putting it, and look nervously
round for the millions, but can see no sign of any of them.</p>
<p>Make another effort to reach Caroline's friend, and this time am
successful. She smiles, and looks very pretty, and says that Caroline
never writes to her but she sometimes gets news through Jane and Maurice.
Do I know Jane and Maurice and the twins?</p>
<p>Am obliged to disclaim any knowledge of any of them, but add madly
that I do so wish I <i>did.</i> Friend receives this better than it
deserves, and we are just going happily into the question of mutual
acquaintances when the President of the Little Thinkers recrudesces, and
says that She wants to have me meet one of their very brightest members,
Mrs. Helen Dowling Dean. Mrs. Helen Dowling Dean is a Southerner by birth
and has a perfectly wonderful Southern accent.</p>
<p>Caroline's friend melts away and Mrs. Helen Dowling Dean and I
confront one another, and she tells me that Boston is a very English
town, and that she herself comes from the South and that people tell her
she has never lost her Southern accent. She is&mdash;as
usual&mdash;extremely agreeable to look at, and I reflect dejectedly that
all the women in America are either quite young and lovely, or else quite
old and picturesque. Ordinary female middle-age, so prevalent in European
countries, apparently nonexistent over here. (Katherine Ellen Blatt an
exception to this rule, but probably much older than she looks. Or
perhaps much younger? Impossible to say.)</p>
<p>Party draws to a close&mdash;discover that, as usual, I have a sore
throat from trying to scream as loud as everybody else is
screaming&mdash;and Fanny Mason kindly extracts me from saying good-bye
and takes me up to my room&mdash;which I shall have to leave only too
soon for the station.</p>
<p>Take the opportunity of writing letters to Robert and to each of the
children. Am obliged to print in large letters for Vicky, and this takes
time, as does endeavour to be reasonably legible for Robin's benefit.
Robert's letter comes last, and is definitely a scrawl. (Wish I had
judged Mary Kellway rather less severely.)</p>
<p>Am seen off at station by Fanny, Leslie, Katherine Ellen Blatt, and
three unidentified men&mdash;probably admirers of Fanny and Leslie. One
of them, quite gratuitously and much to my surprise and gratification,
presents me with large and handsome book, called <i>American
Procession,</i> for the journey.</p>
<p>Train departs&mdash;extraordinary and unpleasant jerk that I have
noticed before in American trains, and which I think reflects ill on
their engine-drivers&mdash;and I look at <i>American Procession,</i>
which is full of photographs and extremely interesting. Am, however,
depressed to realise that I can quite well remember most of the incidents
depicted, and that fashions which now appear wholly preposterous were
worn by myself in youth and even early middle life.</p>
<p>Retire to bed, under the usual difficulties, behind
curtain&mdash;always so reminiscent of film stories&mdash;though nothing
could be less like heroines there depicted than I am myself.</p>
<p><i>November 21st.</i>&mdash;Immense relief to find Washington very
much warmer than Boston, even at crack of dawn. Nobody meets me, at which
I am slightly relieved owing to rather disastrous effect of curtailed
sleep on complexion and appearance generally, and I proceed by taxi to
Hotel indicated by Pete. General impression as I go that Washington is
very clean and pretty, with numbers of dazzlingly white buildings. Am
rather disposed to feel certain that every house I see in turn must be
the White House. Hotel is colossal building of about thirty-five stories,
with three wings, and complete platoon of negro porters in pale-blue
uniforms standing at the entrance. Find myself at once thinking of
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin,</i> and look compassionately at porters, but am
bound to say they all seem perfectly cheerful and prosperous.</p>
<p>Rather disconcerting reception at the desk in office follows. The
clerk is extremely sorry, but the hotel is absolutely full up. Not a
bedroom anywhere. We look at one another rather blankly, and I feebly
mention name of extremely distinguished publishing firm by which I have
been directed to came here and not elsewhere. That don't make a mite of
difference, says the clerk, shaking his head. He's just as sorry as he
can be, but not a bed is available. Very well. I resign myself. But as I
am a complete stranger, perhaps he will very kindly tell me where I can
go next? Oh yes, says the clerk, looking infinitely relieved, he can
easily do that. The Woodman-Park Hotel will be tickled to death to have
me go there. He will phone up right away and make the reservation for me,
if I like. Accept this gratefully, and in a moment all is settled, and
blue-uniformed darkie has put me and my luggage into another taxi, after
I have gratefully thanked hotel-clerk and he has assured me that I am
very welcome. (This perhaps slightly ironical in the
circumstances&mdash;but evidently not intended to be so.)</p>
<p>Woodman-Park Hotel also turns out to be enormous, and reflection
assails me that if I am also told here that Every room is full up, I
shall definitely be justified in coming to the conclusion that there is
something about my appearance which suggests undesirability. Am, however,
spared this humiliation. Woodman-Park&mdash;negroes this time in
crushed-strawberry colour&mdash;receives me with affability, and
accommodates me with room on the fifteenth floor.</p>
<p>I unpack&mdash;dresses creased as usual, and I reflect for the
thousandth time that I shall never make a good packer, and that continual
practice is, if anything, making me worse&mdash;and go down to breakfast.
Excellent coffee starts, not for the first time, rather melancholy train
of thought concerning Cook, and her utter inability to produce even
moderately drinkable coffee. Shall make a point of telling her how much I
have enjoyed <i>all</i> coffee in America.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Is this a cast-iron resolution, to be put into effect
directly I get home in whatever mood I may happen to find Cook&mdash;or
is it merely one of those rhetorical flashes, never destined to be
translated into action? <i>Answer,</i> all too probably: The latter.)</p>
<p>Reflect with satisfaction that I can actually claim friendship with
official in the State Department, met several times in London, and whom I
now propose to ring up on the telephone as soon as the day is respectably
advanced. Recollect that I liked him very much, and hope that this may
still hold good after lapse of five years, and may also extend to newly
acquired wife, whom I have never met, and that neither of them will take
a dislike to me.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Has rebuff at first Hotel visited slightly unnerved me?
If so, morale will doubtless be restored by breakfast. Order more coffee
and a fresh supply of toast on the strength of this thought.)</p>
<p>Greatly surprised as I leave dining-room to find myself presented with
small card on which is printed name hitherto totally unknown to me:
General Clarence Dove. I say to the waiter&mdash;not very
intelligently&mdash;What is this? and he refrains from saying, as he well
might, that It's a visiting-card, and replies instead that It's the
gentleman at the table near the door.</p>
<p>At this I naturally look at the table near the door, and elderly
gentleman with bald head and rather morose expression makes half-hearted
movement towards getting up, and bows. I bow in return, and once more
scrutinise card, but it still looks exactly the same, and I am still
equally unable to wake any association in connection with General
Clarence Dove. Feel constrained to take one or two steps towards him,
which courtesy he handsomely returns by standing up altogether and
throwing his table-napkin on the floor.</p>
<p>Cannot help wishing the waiter would put things on a more solid basis
by introducing us, but this feeling probably only a manifestation of
British snobbishness, and nothing of the kind occurs. Elderly gentleman,
however, rises to the occasion more or less, and tells me that he has
been written to by Mrs. Wheelwright, of Long Island, and told to look out
for me, and that I am writing a book about America. He has therefore
ventured to make himself known to me.</p>
<p>Express my gratification, and beg him to go on with his breakfast.
This he refuses to do, and says&mdash;obviously untruly&mdash;that he has
finished, but that we could perhaps take a little turn together in the
sunshine. This hope rather optimistic, as sunshine though present turns
out to be of poor quality, and we hastily retire to spacious hall,
furnished with alternate armchairs and ashtrays on stands. Central
heating, undeniably, far more satisfactory than sunshine, at this time of
year, but doubtful if this thought would appeal to General Clarence
Dove&mdash;aspect rather forbidding&mdash;so keep it to myself.</p>
<p>Just as I am preparing to make agreeable speech anent the beauties of
Washington, the General utters.</p>
<p>He hears, he says, that I am writing a book about America. Now, he may
be old-fashioned, but personally he finds this rather difficult to
understand.</p>
<p>I say, No, no, in great agitation, and explain that I am <i>not</i>
writing a book about America, that I shouldn't ever dream of doing such a
thing, after a six months' visit, and that on the contrary&mdash;</p>
<p>A book about America, says the General, without paying the slightest
attention to my eloquence, is not a thing to be undertaken in that spirit
at all. Far too many British and other writers have made this mistake.
They come over&mdash;whether invited or not&mdash;and are received by
many of the best people in America, and what do they do in return? I
again break in and say that I know, and I have often thought what a pity
it is, and the last thing I should ever dream of doing would be
to&mdash;</p>
<p>Besides, interrupts the General, quite unmoved, America is a large
country. A very large country indeed. To write a book about it would be a
very considerable task. What people don't seem to understand is that no
person can call themselves qualified to write a book about it after a
mere superficial visit lasting less than two months.</p>
<p>Am by now almost frantic, and reiterate in a subdued shriek that I
agree with every word the General is saying, and have always thought
exactly the same thing&mdash;but all is in vain. He continues to look
straight in front of him, and to assure me that there can be no greater
mistake than to come over to a country like America, spend five minutes
there, and then rush home and write a book about it. Far too many people
have done this already.</p>
<p>Can see by now that it is completely useless to try and persuade
General Clarence Dove that I am not amongst these, and have no intention
of ever being so&mdash;and I therefore remain silent whilst he says the
same things all over again about five times more.</p>
<p>After this he gets up, assures me that it has been a pleasure to meet
me, and that he will certainly read my book about America when it comes
out, and we part&mdash;never, I hope, to meet again.</p>
<p>Am completely shattered by this extraordinary encounter for several
hours afterwards, but eventually summon up enough strength to ring up
Department of State&mdash;which makes me feel important&mdash;and get
into touch with friend James. He responds most agreeably, sounds
flatteringly pleased at my arrival, and invites me to lunch with himself
and his wife and his baby.</p>
<p>Baby?</p>
<p>Oh yes, he has a daughter aged two months. Very intelligent. I say,
quite truthfully, that I should love to see her, and feel that she will
be a much pleasanter companion than General Clarence Dove&mdash;and much
more on my own conversational level into the bargain.</p>
<p>James later fetches me by car, and we drive to his apartment situated
in street rather strangely named O. Street. I tell him that he hasn't
altered in the very least&mdash;he says the same, though probably with
less truth, about me, and enquires after Robert, the children, Kolynos
the dog&mdash;now, unfortunately, no longer with us&mdash;and Helen Wills
the cat. I then meet his wife, Elizabeth&mdash;very pretty and
attractive&mdash;and his child, Katherine&mdash;not yet pretty, but I
like her and am gratified because she doesn't cry when I pick her
up&mdash;and we have peaceful and pleasant lunch.</p>
<p>Conversation runs on personal and domestic lines, and proves
thoroughly congenial, after recent long spell of social and literary
exertions. Moreover, <i>Anthony Adverse</i> motif entirely absent, which
is a relief.</p>
<p>Reluctantly leave this agreeable atmosphere in order to present myself
at Department Store, in accordance with explicit instructions received
from Pete.</p>
<p>Arrange, however, to go with James next day and be shown house of
George Washington.</p>
<p>Store is, as usual, large and important, and I enter it with some
trepidation, and very nearly walk straight out again on catching sight of
large and flattering photograph of myself, taken at least three years
ago, propped up in prominent position. Printed notice below says that I
am Speaking at Four O'clock this afternoon.</p>
<p>Memory transports me to village at home, and comparative frequency
with which I Speak, alternately with Our Vicar's Wife, at Women's
Institute, Mothers' Union, and the like organisations, and total absence
of excitement with which both of us are alike hailed. Fantastic wonder
crosses my mind as to whether photograph, exhibited beforehand, say in
Post Office window, would be advisable, but on further reflection decide
against this.</p>
<p>(Photograph was taken in Bond Street, head and shoulders only, and can
distinctly recollect that Vicky, on seeing it, enquired in horrified
tones if I was <i>all</i> naked?)</p>
<p>Enquire for book department, am told to my confusion that I am in it,
and realise with horror that I am, but have been completely lost in
idiotic and unprofitable reverie. Make no attempt to explain myself, but
simply ask for Mrs. Roberta Martin, head of department. She
appears&mdash;looks about twenty-five but is presumably more&mdash;and
welcomes me very kindly.</p>
<p>Would I like tea <i>before</i> I speak, or <i>after?</i></p>
<p>She asks this so nicely that I am impelled to candour, and say that I
wouldn't really like tea at all, but could we have a cup of coffee
together afterwards?</p>
<p>We could, and do.</p>
<p>Find ourselves talking about boys. Mrs. R. M. says she has a son of
fourteen, which I find quite incredible, and very nearly tell her so, but
am restrained by sudden obscure association with extraordinary behaviour
of General Clarence Dove.</p>
<p>Boys a great responsibility, we agree, but very nice. Her Sidney and
my Robin have points in common. Did Sidney like parties in early
childhood? No, not at all. Wild horses wouldn't drag him to one. Am
relieved to hear it, especially when his mother adds that It All Came
Later.</p>
<p>Have vision of Robin, a year or two hence, clamouring for social life.
(Probably finding it very difficult to get, now I come to think of it, as
neighbourhood anything but populous.)</p>
<p>Time, with all this, passes very agreeably, and Mrs. Roberta Martin
and I part with mutual esteem and liking.</p>
<p>Take a look round various departments as I go out, and see several
things I should like to buy, but am already doubtful if funds are going
to hold out till return to New York, so restrict myself to small sponge,
pad of note-paper, and necklace of steel beads that I think may appeal to
Mademoiselle and go with her Grey.</p>
<p><i>November 22nd.</i>&mdash;Home of George Washington inspected, and
am much moved by its beauty. Enquire where historical cherry-tree can be
seen, but James replies&mdash;surely rather cynically?&mdash;that
cherry-tree episode now practically discredited altogether. Find this
hard to believe.</p>
<p><i>(Mem.:</i> Say nothing about it at home. Story of George W. and
cherry-tree not infrequently useful as illustration when pointing out to
dear Vicky the desirability of strict truthfulness. Moreover, entire
story always most popular when playing charades.)</p>
<p>On leaving George Washington, we proceed to home of General Robert E.
Lee, but unfortunately arrive there too late and have to content
ourselves with pressing our noses against the windows. Subsequently miss
the way, in terrific maze of avenues that surround the house, find gate
at last and discover that it is locked, have visions of staying there all
night, but subsequently unfastened gate is reached, and we safely
emerge.</p>
<p>James shows me the Lincoln Memorial, and I definitely think it the
most beautiful thing, without exception, that I have seen in America.</p>
<p>Tour is concluded by a drive through Washington, and I see the outside
of a good many Embassies, and am reluctantly obliged to conclude that the
British one is far indeed from being the most beautiful amongst them.
Decide that the Japanese one is the prettiest.</p>
<p>Evening spent with James and Elizabeth. Katherine still engaging, but
slightly inclined to scream when left alone in bed-room. (Am forcibly
reminded of dear Robin's very early days.)</p>
<p>Leave early, as I fancy James and Elizabeth both kept thoroughly short
of sleep by infant Katherine. Cannot, however, deter James from driving
me back to Hotel. Am greatly impressed with this chivalrous, and
universal, American custom.</p>
<p>James and I part at the door, strawberry-clad negro porters spring to
attention as I enter, and I perceive, to my horror, that General Clarence
Dove is sitting in the hall, doing nothing whatever, directly between me
and elevator. Turn at once to the newspaper-stand and earnestly inspect
motion-picture magazines&mdash;in which I am not in the least
interested&mdash;cigars, cigarettes and picture-postcards. Take a long
time choosing six of these, and paying for them. Cannot, however, stand
there all night, and am at last compelled to turn round. General Clarence
Dove still immovable. Decide to bow as I go past, but without slackening
speed, and this proves successful, and I go up to bed without hearing
more of my book about America.</p>
<p><i>November 23rd.</i>&mdash;Am introduced by James to important Head
of Department, Miss Bassell, who kindly takes me to the White House,
where I am shown State Rooms and other items of interest.</p>
<p>Portraits of Presidents' Wives in long rows present rather
discouraging spectacle. Prefer not to dwell on these, but concentrate
instead on trying to remember Who was Dolly Madison?
Decide&mdash;tentatively&mdash;that she must have been an American
equivalent of Nell Gwyn, but am not sufficiently sure about it to say
anything to Miss B. In any case, have no idea which, if any, of America's
Presidents would best bear comparison with King Charles II.</p>
<p>Lunch-party brings my stay in Washington to a close, and James and
Elizabeth&mdash;kind-hearted and charming to the last&mdash;take me and
my luggage to the station. Am relieved to find that both look rested, and
are able to assure me that dear little Katherine allowed them several
hours of uninterrupted sleep.</p>
<p>Say good-bye to them with regret, and promise that I will come and
stay with them in their first Consulate, but add proviso&mdash;perhaps
rather ungraciously?&mdash;that it must be in a warm climate.</p>
<p>Find myself wondering as train moves out what dear Robert will say to
the number of future invitations that I have both given and accepted?</p>
<p><i>November 25th.</i>&mdash;Philadelphia reached yesterday, and
discover in myself slight and irrational tendency to repeat under my
breath: "I'm off to Philadelphia in the morning". Do not know, or care,
where this quotation comes from.</p>
<p>Unknown hostess called Mrs. Elliot receives me, and I join enormous
house-party consisting of all her relations. Do not succeed, from one end
of visit to the other, in discovering the name of any single one of
them.</p>
<p>Mrs. E. says she likes <i>The Wide Wide World.</i> Am pleased at this,
and we talk about it at immense length, and I tell her that a Life of
Susan Warner exists, which she seems to think impossible, as she has
never heard of it. Promise to send her a copy from England, and am more
convinced than ever&mdash;if possible&mdash;that we are none of us
prophets in our own country.</p>
<p><i>(Mem.:</i> Make note of Mrs. Elliot's address. Also send postcard
to favourite second-hand bookseller to obtain copy of <i>Susan Warner</i>
for me. Shall look extremely foolish if it isn't forthcoming, after all
I've said. But must not meet trouble half-way.)</p>
<p>Lecture&mdash;given, unfortunately, by myself&mdash;takes place in the
evening at large Club. Everyone very kind, and many intelligent questions
asked, which I do my best to answer. Secretary forgets to give me my fee,
and lack courage to ask for it, but it subsequently arrives by special
delivery, just as I am going to bed.</p>
<p><i>November 27th.</i>&mdash;Unexpected arrival of guardian angel
Ramona Herdman from New York. Am delighted to see her, and still more so
when she gives me collection of letters from England. As usual, am on my
way to book-store where I have to make short speech, and am unable to
read letters in any but the most cursory way&mdash;but ascertain that no
calamity has befallen anybody, that Robert will be glad to hear when he
is to meet me at Southampton, and that Caroline Concannon has written a
book, and it has instantly been accepted by highly superior
publishing-house. Am not in the least surprised at this last piece of
information. C. C. exactly the kind of young person to romp straight to
success. Shall probably yet see small blue oval announcement on the walls
of 57 Doughty Street, to the effect that they once sheltered the
celebrated writer, Caroline Concannon. Feel that the least I can do is to
cable my congratulations, and this I do, at some expense.</p>
<p>Miss Ramona Herdman and I then proceed to book-store, where we meet
head of department, Mrs. Kooker. Talk about Vera
Brittain&mdash;<i>Testament of Youth</i> selling superbly, says Mrs.
K.&mdash;also new film, <i>Little Women,</i> which everyone says I
<i>must</i> see in New York&mdash;(had always meant to, anyway)&mdash;and
recent adoption by American women of tomato-juice as a substitute for
cocktails.</p>
<p>Conversation then returns to literature, and Mrs. Kooker tells me that
Christmas sales will soon be coming on, but that Thanksgiving interferes
with them rather badly. Try and look as if I thoroughly understood and
sympathised with this, but have to give it up when she naively enquires
whether Thanksgiving has similar disastrous effect on trade in England?
Explain, as delicately as I can, that England has never, so far as I
know, returned any particular thanks for occasion thus commemorated in
the United States, and after a moment Mrs. K. sees this, and is
amused.</p>
<p>Customary talk takes place&mdash;shall soon be able to say it in my
sleep&mdash;and various listeners come up and speak to me kindly
afterwards. Completely unknown lady in brown tells me that we met years
ago, and she remembers me so well, and is so glad to see me again.
Respond to this as best I can, and say&mdash;with only too much
truth&mdash;that the exact whereabouts of our last encounter has,
temporarily, escaped me. What! cries the lady reproachfully, have I
forgotten dear old Scarborough?</p>
<p>As I have never in my life set foot in dear old Scarborough, this
proves very, very difficult to answer. Do not, in fact, attempt to do so,
but merely shake hands with her again and turn attention to someone who
is telling me that she has a dear little granddaughter, aged five, who
says most amusing things. If only, grandmother adds wistfully, she could
<i>remember</i> them, she would tell them to me, and then I should be
able to put them into a book.</p>
<p>Express regrets&mdash;unfortunately civil, rather than
sincere&mdash;at having to forgo this privilege, and we separate. Miss
Herdman&mdash;has mysteriously produced a friend and a
motor-car&mdash;tells me that I am going with her to tea at the house of
a distinguished critic. Alexander Woollcott? I say hopefully, and she
looks rather shocked and replies No, no, don't I remember that A. W.
lives in unique apartment in New York, overlooking the East River? There
are, she adds curtly, other distinguished critics besides Alexander
Woollcott, in America. Have not the courage,\ after this <i>gaffe,</i> to
enquire further as to my present destination.</p>
<p>Tea-party, however, turns out pleasantly&mdash;which is, I feel, more
than I deserve&mdash;and I enjoy myself, except when kind elderly
lady&mdash;mother of hostess&mdash;suddenly exclaims that We mustn't
forget we have an Englishwoman as our guest, and immediately flings open
two windows. Ice-cold wind blows in, and several people look at
me&mdash;as well they may&mdash;with dislike and resentment.</p>
<p>Should like to tell them that nobody is more resentful of this
hygienic outburst than I am myself&mdash;but cannot, of course, do so.
Remind myself instead that a number of English people have been known to
visit the States, only to die there of pneumonia.</p>
<p>Am subsequently driven back to Mrs. Elliot's by R. Herdman and friend,
Miss H. informing me on the way that a speaking engagement has been made
for me at the Colony Club in New York. At this the friend suddenly
interposes, and observes morosely that the Colony Club is easily the most
difficult audience in the world. They look at their wrist-watches all the
time.</p>
<p>Can quite see what fun this must be for the speaker, and tell Miss H.
that I do not think I can possibly go to the Colony Club at all but she
takes no notice.</p>
<p><i>November 28th. New York.</i>&mdash;Return to New York, in company
with Miss Herdman, and arrive at Essex House once more. Feel that this is
the first step towards home, and am quite touched and delighted when
clerk at bureau greets me as an old <i>habitu&eacute;e.</i> Feel,
however, that he is disappointed in me when I am obliged to admit, in
reply to enquiry, that I did <i>not</i> get to Hollywood&mdash;and was
not, in fact, invited to go there. Try to make up for this by saying that
I visited World Fair at Chicago extensively&mdash;but can see that this
is not at all the same thing.</p>
<p>Letters await me, and include one from Mademoiselle, written as usual
in purple ink on thin paper, but crossed on top of front page in
green&mdash;association here with Lowell Thomas&mdash;who says that she
is all impatience to see me once more, it seems an affair of centuries
since we met in <i>"ce brouhaha de New-York",</i> and she kisses my hand
with the respectful affection.</p>
<p>(The French given to hyperbolical statements. No such performance has
ever been given by Mademoiselle, or been permitted by myself to take
place. Am inclined to wonder whether dear Vicky's occasional lapses from
veracity may not be attributed to early influence of devoted, but not
flawless, Mademoiselle?)</p>
<p>Just as I come to this conclusion, discover that Mademoiselle has most
touchingly sent me six American Beauty roses, and immediately reverse
decision as to her effect on Vicky's morals. This possibly illogical, but
definitely understandable from feminine point of view.</p>
<p>Ring up Mademoiselle&mdash;who screeches a good deal and is difficult
to hear, except for <i>Mon Dieu!</i> which occurs often thank her for
letter and roses, and ask if she can come and see a film with me
to-morrow afternoon. Anything she likes, but not <i>Henry VIII. Mais non,
mais non,</i> Mademoiselle shrieks, and adds something that sounds like
<i>"ce maudit roi"</i>, which I am afraid refers to the Reformation, but
do not enter on controversial discussion and merely suggest <i>Little
Women</i> instead.</p>
<p><i>Ah,</i> cries Mademoiselle, <i>voil&agrave; une bonne id&eacute;e!
Cette ch&egrave;re vie de famille&mdash;ce gentil roman de la
jeunesse&mdash;cette dr&ocirc;le de Jo&mdash;coeur d'or&mdash;t&ecirc;te
de linotte</i>&mdash;and much else that I do not attempt to
disentangle.</p>
<p>Agree to everything, suggest lunch first but this, Mademoiselle
replies, duty will not permit&mdash;appoint meeting-place and ring
off.</p>
<p>Immediate and urgent preoccupation, as usual, is my hair, and retire
at once to hotel Beauty-parlour, where I am received with gratifying
assurances that I have been missed, and competently dealt with.</p>
<p>Just as I get upstairs again telephone bell rings once more, and
publishers demand&mdash;I think unreasonably&mdash;immediate decision as
to which boat I mean to sail in, and when. Keep my head as far as
possible, turn up various papers on which I feel sure I have noted
steamship sailings&mdash;(but which all turn out to be memos about buying
presents for the maids at home, pictures of America for the Women's
Institute, and evening stockings for myself)&mdash;and finally plump for
the <i>Berengaria.</i></p>
<p>Publishers, with common sense rather than tenderness, at once reply
that they suppose I had better go tourist class, as purposes of publicity
have now been achieved, and it will be much cheaper.</p>
<p>Assent to this, ring off, and excitedly compose cable to Robert.</p>
<p><i>November 29th.</i>&mdash;Gratifying recrudescence of more or less
all the people met on first arrival in New York, who ring up and ask me
to lunch or dine before I sail.</p>
<p>Ella Wheelwright sends round note by hand, lavishly invites me to
lunch once, and dine twice, and further adds that she is coming to see me
off when I sail. Am touched and impressed, and accept lunch, and one
dinner, and break it to her that she will have to see me off&mdash;if at
all&mdash;tourist section. Morning filled by visit to publishers' office,
where I am kindly received, and told that I have Laid Some Very Useful
Foundations, which makes me feel like a Distinguished Personage at the
opening of a new Town Hall.</p>
<p>Lecture-agent, whom I also visit, is likewise kind, but perhaps less
enthusiastic, and hints that it might be an advantage if I had more than
two lectures in my repertoire. Am bound to admit that this seems
reasonable. He further outlines, in a light-hearted way, scheme by which
I am to undertake lengthy lecture-tour next winter, extending&mdash;as
far as I can make out&mdash;from New York to the furthermost point in the
Rockies, and including a good deal of travelling by air.</p>
<p>Return modified assent to all of it, graciously accept cheque due to
me, and depart.</p>
<p>Lunch all by myself in a Childs', and find it restful, after immense
quantities of conversation indulged in of late. Service almost incredibly
prompt and efficient, and find myself wondering how Americans can endure
more leisurely methods so invariably prevalent in almost every country in
Europe.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards meet Mademoiselle, and am touched&mdash;but
embarrassed by her excessive demonstrations of welcome. Have brought her
small present from Chicago World Fair, but decide not to bestow it until
moment immediately preceding separation, as cannot feel at all sure what
form her gratitude might take.</p>
<p>We enter picture-house, where I have already reserved
seats&mdash;Mademoiselle exclaims a good deal over this, and says that
everything in America is <i>un prix fou</i>&mdash;and Mademoiselle takes
off her hat, which is large, and balances it on her knee. Ask her if this
is all right, or if she hadn't better put it under the seat, and she
first nods her head and then shakes it, but leaves hat where it is.</p>
<p>Comic film precedes <i>Little Women</i> and is concerned with the
misadventure of a house-painter. Am irresistibly reminded of comic song
of my youth: "When Father papered the parlour, You couldn't see Pa for
paste". Am unfortunately inspired to ask Mademoiselle if she remembers it
too. <i>Comment?</i> says Mademoiselle a good many times.</p>
<p>Explain that it doesn't matter, I will tell her about it later, it is
of no importance. Mademoiselle, however, declines to be put off and I
make insane excursion into French: <i>Quand mon p&egrave;re&mdash;?</i>
and am then defeated. <i>Mais oui,</i> says Mademoiselle, <i>quand votre
p&egrave;re&mdash;?</i> Cannot think how to say "papered the parlour" in
French, and make various efforts which are not a success.</p>
<p>We compromise at last on Mademoiselle's suggestion that <i>mon
p&egrave;re</i> was perhaps <i>avec le journal dans le parloir?</i> which
I know is incorrect, but have not the energy to improve upon.</p>
<p>Comic film, by this time, is fortunately over, and we prepare for
<i>Little Women.</i></p>
<p>Well-remembered house at Concord is thrown on the screen, snow falling
on the ground, and I dissolve, without the slightest hesitation, into
floods of tears. Film continues unutterably moving throughout, and is
beautifully acted and produced. Mademoiselle weeps beside me&mdash;can
hear most people round us doing the same&mdash;and we spend entirely
blissful afternoon.</p>
<p>Performances of Beth, Mrs. March and Professor Bhaer seem to me
artistically flawless, and Mademoiselle, between sobs, agrees with me,
but immediately adds that Amy and Jo were equally good, if not
better.</p>
<p>Repair emotional disorder as best we can, and go and drink strong
coffee in near-by drug-store, when Mademoiselle's hat is discovered to be
in sad state of disrepair, and she says Yes, it fell off her knee
unperceived, and she thinks several people must have walked upon it. I
suggest, diffidently, that we should go together and get a new one, but
she says No, no, all can be put right by herself in an hour's work, and
she has a small piece of black velvet and two or three artificial
<i>bleuets</i> from her hat of the summer before last with which to
construct what will practically amount to a new hat.</p>
<p>The French, undoubtedly, superior to almost every other nationality in
the world in thrift, ingenuity and ability with a needle.</p>
<p>Talk about the children&mdash;Vicky, says Mademoiselle emotionally,
remains superior to any other child she has ever met, or can ever hope to
meet, for intelligence, heart and beauty. (Can remember many occasions
when Mademoiselle's estimate of Vicky was far indeed from being equally
complimentary.) Mademoiselle also tells me about her present pupils, with
moderate enthusiasm, and speaks well of her employers&mdash;principally
on the grounds that they never interfere with her, pay her an enormous
salary, and are taking her back to Paris next year.</p>
<p>She enquires about my lecture-tour, listens sympathetically to all
that I have to say, and we finally part affectionately, with an assurance
from Mademoiselle that she will come and see me off on s.s.
<i>Berengaria</i>, <i>M&ecirc;me,</i> she adds, <i>si &ccedil;a doit me
colter la vie.</i></p>
<p>Feel confident that no such sacrifice will, however, be required, but
slight misgiving crosses my mind, as I walk back towards Central Park, as
to the reactions of Mademoiselle and Ella Wheelwright to one another,
should they both carry out proposed amiable design of seeing me off.</p>
<p>Cheque received from lecture-bureau, and recollection of dinner
engagement at Ella's apartment, encourage me to look in at shop-windows
and consider the question of new evening dress, of which I am badly in
need, owing to deplorable effects of repeated and unskilful packings and
unpackings. Crawl along Fifth Avenue, where shops all look expensive and
intimidating, but definitely alluring.</p>
<p>Venture into one of them, and am considerably dashed by the assistant,
who can produce nothing but bottle-green or plum colour&mdash;which are,
she informs me, the only shades that will be worn <i>at all</i> this
year. As I look perfectly frightful in either, can see nothing for it but
to walk out again.</p>
<p>Am then suddenly accosted in the street by young and pretty woman with
very slim legs and large fur-collar to her coat. She says How delightful
it is to meet again, and I at once agree, and try in vain to remember
whether I knew her in Cleveland, Chicago, Buffalo or Boston. No success,
but am moved to ask her advice as to purchase of frocks.</p>
<p>Oh, she replies amiably, I must come <i>at once</i> to her
place&mdash;she is, as it happens, on her way there now.</p>
<p>We proceed to her place, which turns out a great success. No
prevalence of either bottle-green or plum-colour is noticeable, and I try
on and purchase black evening frock with frills and silver girdle.
Unknown friend is charming, buys an evening wrap and two scarves on her
own account, and declares her intention of coming to see me off on the
<i>Berengaria.</i></p>
<p>We then part cordially, and I go back to Essex House, still&mdash;and
probably for ever&mdash;unaware of her identity. Find five telephone
messages waiting for me, and am rather discouraged&mdash;probably owing
to fatigue&mdash;but ring up all of them conscientiously, and find that
senders are mostly out. Rush of American life undoubtedly exemplified
here. Am full of admiration for so much energy and vitality, but cannot
possibly attempt to emulate it, and in fact go quietly to sleep for an
hour before dressing for Ella's dinner-party.</p>
<p>This takes place in superb apartment on Park Avenue. Ella is in
bottle-green&mdash;(Fifth Avenue saleswoman evidently quite
right)&mdash;neck very high in front, but back and shoulders uncovered.
She says that she is dying to hear about my trip. She knows that I just
loved Boston, and thought myself back in England all the time I was
there. She also knows that I didn't much care about Chicago, and found it
very Middle-West. Just as I am preparing to contradict her, she begins to
tell us all about a trip of her own to Arizona, and I get no opportunity
of rectifying her entirely mistaken convictions about me and America.</p>
<p>Sit next man who is good-looking&mdash;though bald&mdash;and he tells
me very nicely that he hears I am a great friend of Miss Blatt's. As I
know only too well that he must have received this information from Miss
Blatt and none other, do not like to say that he has been misinformed. We
accordingly talk about Miss Blatt with earnestness and cordiality for
some little while. (Sheer waste of time, no less.)</p>
<p>Leave early, as packing looms ahead of me and have still immense
arrears of sleep to make up. Good-looking man&mdash;name is Julius van
Adams&mdash;offers to drive me back, he has his own car waiting at the
door. He does so, and we become absorbed in conversation&mdash;Miss Blatt
now definitely forgotten&mdash;and drive five times round Central
Park.</p>
<p>Part cordially outside Essex House in the small hours of the
morning.</p>
<p><i>November 30th.</i>&mdash;Final stages of American visit fly past
with inconceivable rapidity. Consignment of books for the voyage is sent
me, very, very kindly, by publishers, and proves perfectly impossible to
pack, and I decide to carry them. Everyone whom I consult says Yes,
they'll be all right in a strap. Make many resolutions about purchasing a
strap.</p>
<p>Packing, even apart from books, presents many difficulties, and I
spend much time on all-fours in hotel bedroom, amongst my belongings.
Results not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the midst of it all am startled&mdash;but gratified&mdash;by sudden
telephone enquiry from publishers: Have I seen anything of the Night Life
of New York? Alternative replies to this question flash rapidly through
my mind If the Night Life of New York consists in returning at late hours
by taxi, through crowded streets, from prolonged dinner-parties, then
Yes. If something more specific, then No. Have not yet decided which line
to adopt when all is taken out of my hands. Publishers' representative,
speaking through the telephone, says with great decision that I cannot
possibly be said to have seen New York unless I have visited a night-club
and been to Harlem. He has, in fact, arranged that I should do both.
When, I ask weakly. He says, To-night, and adds&mdash;belatedly and
without much sense&mdash;If that suits me. As I know, and he knows, that
my engagements are entirely in the hands of himself and his firm, I
accept this as a mere gesture of courtesy, and simply enquire what kind
of clothes I am to wear.</p>
<p><i>(Note:</i> Shampoo-and-set before to-night, and make every effort
to get in a facial as well&mdash;if time permits, which it almost
certainly won't.)</p>
<p><i>Later:</i> I become part of the Night Life of New York, and am left
more or less stunned by the experience, which begins at seven o'clock
when Miss Ramona Herdman comes to fetch me. She is accompanied by second
charming young woman&mdash;Helen Something&mdash;and three men, all tall.
(Should like to congratulate her on this achievement but do not, of
course, do so.)</p>
<p>Doubt crosses my mind as to whether I shall ever find anything to talk
about to five complete strangers, but decide that I shall only impair my
morale if I begin to think about that now, and fortunately they suggest
cocktails; and these have their customary effect. (Make mental note to
the effect that the influence of cocktails on modern life cannot be
exaggerated.) Am unable to remember the names of any of the men but quite
feel that I know them well, and am gratified when one of
them&mdash;possessor of phenomenal eyelashes&mdash;tells me that we have
met before. Name turns out to be Eugene, and I gradually identify his two
friends as Charlie and Taylor, but uncertainty prevails throughout as to
which is Charlie and which is Taylor.</p>
<p>Consultation takes place&mdash;in which I take no active part&mdash;as
to where we are to dine, Miss Herdman evidently feeling responsible as to
impressions that I may derive of New York's Night Life. Decision finally
reached that we shall patronise a <i>Speak-easy de luxe.</i> Am much
impressed by this extraordinary contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Speak-easy is only two blocks away, we walk there, and I am escorted
by Taylor&mdash;who may be Charlie but I think not&mdash;and he astounds
me by enquiring if from my Hotel I can hear the lions roaring in Central
Park? No, I can't. I can hear cars going by, and horns blowing, and even
whistles&mdash;but no lions. Taylor evidently disappointed but suggests,
as an alternative, that perhaps I have at least, in the very early
mornings, heard the ducks quacking in Central Park? Am obliged to
repudiate the ducks also, and can see that Taylor thinks the worse of me.
He asserts, rather severely, that he himself has frequently heard both
lions and ducks&mdash;I make mental resolution to avoid walking through
Central Park until I know more about the whereabouts and habits of the
lions&mdash;and we temporarily cease to converse.</p>
<p><i>Speak-easy de luxe</i> turns out to be everything that its name
implies&mdash;all scarlet upholstery, chromium-plating and terrible
noise&mdash;and we are privileged to meet, and talk with, the proprietor.
He says he comes from Tipperary&mdash;(I have to stifle immediately
impulse to say that It's a long, long way to Tipperary)&mdash;and we talk
about Ireland, London night-clubs and the Empire State Building. Charlie
is suddenly inspired to say&mdash;without foundation&mdash;that I want to
know what will happen to the speak-easy when Prohibition is repealed? To
this the proprietor replies&mdash;probably with perfect truth&mdash;that
he is, he supposes, asked that question something like one million times
every evening&mdash;and shortly afterwards he leaves us.</p>
<p>Dinner is excellent, we dance at intervals, and Eugene talks to me
about books and says he is a publisher.</p>
<p>We then depart in a taxi for night-club, and I admire&mdash;not for
the first time&mdash;the amount of accommodation available in American
taxis. We all talk, and discuss English food, of which Ramona and her
friend Helen speak more kindly than it deserves&mdash;probably out of
consideration for my feelings. Eugene and Charlie preserve
silence&mdash;no doubt for the same reason&mdash;but Taylor, evidently a
strong-minded person, says that he has suffered a good deal from English
cabbage. Savouries, on the other hand, are excellent. They are eaten, he
surprisingly adds, with a special little knife and fork, usually of gold.
Can only suppose that Taylor, when in England, moves exclusively in ducal
circles, and hastily resolve never in any circumstances to ask him to my
own house where savouries, if any, are eaten with perfectly ordinary
electro-plate.</p>
<p>Night-club is reached&mdash;name over the door in electric light is
simply but inappropriately&mdash;<i>Paradise</i>. It is, or seems to me,
about the size of the Albert Hall, and is completely packed with people
all screaming at the tops of their voices, orchestra playing jazz, and
extremely pretty girls with practically no clothes on at all, prancing on
a large stage.</p>
<p>We sit down at a table, and Charlie immediately tells me that the
conductor of the band is Paul Whiteman, and that he lost 75 lbs. last
year and his wife wrote a book. I scream back Really? and decide that
conversationally I can do no more, as surrounding noise is too
overwhelming.</p>
<p>Various young women come on and perform unnatural contortions with
their bodies, and I indulge in reflections on the march of civilisation,
but am roused from this by Taylor, who roars into my ear that the
conductor of the orchestra is Whiteman and he has recently lost 75 lbs.
in weight. Content myself this time with nodding in reply.</p>
<p>Noise continues deafening, and am moved by the sight of three
exhausted-looking women in black velvet, huddled round a microphone on
platform and presumably singing into it&mdash;but no sound audible above
surrounding din. They are soon afterwards eclipsed by further instalment
of entirely undressed <i>houris,</i> each waving wholly inadequate
feather-fan.</p>
<p>Just as I am deciding that no one over the age of twenty-five should
be expected to derive satisfaction from watching this display, Taylor
again becomes my informant. The proprietors of this place, he bellows,
are giving the selfsame show, absolutely free, to four hundred little
newsboys on Thanksgiving Day. Nothing, I reply sardonically, could
possibly be healthier or more beneficial to the young&mdash;but this
sarcasm entirely wasted as it is inaudible, and shortly afterwards we
leave. Air of Broadway feels like purity itself, after the atmosphere
prevalent inside <i>Paradise,</i> which might far more suitably be
labelled exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>Now, I enquire, are we going to Harlem? Everyone says Oh no, it's no
use going to Harlem before one o'clock in the morning at the very
earliest. We are going to another night-club on Broadway. This one is
called <i>Montmartre,</i> and is comparatively small and quiet.</p>
<p>This actually proves to be the case, and am almost prepared to wager
that not more than three hundred people are sitting round the dance-floor
screaming at one another. Orchestra is very good indeed&mdash;coloured
female pianist superlatively so&mdash;and two young gentlemen, acclaimed
as "The Twins" and looking about fifteen years of age, are dancing
admirably. We watch this for some time, and reward it with well-deserved
applause. Conversation is comparatively audible, and on the whole I can
hear quite a number of the things we are supposed to be talking about.
These comprise Mae West, the World Fair in Chicago, film called <i>Three
Little Pigs,</i> and the difference in programmes between the American
Radio and the British Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p>Charlie tells me that he has not read my book&mdash;which doesn't
surprise me&mdash;and adds that he will certainly do so at
once&mdash;which we both know to be a polite gesture and not to be taken
seriously.</p>
<p>Conviction gradually invades me that I am growing sleepy and that in
another minute I shan't be able to help yawning. Pinch myself under the
table and look round at Helen and Ramona, but both seem to be perfectly
fresh and alert. Involuntary and most unwelcome reflection crosses my
mind that <i>age will tell.</i> Yawn becomes very imminent indeed and I
set my teeth, pinch harder than ever, and open my eyes as widely as
possible. Should be sorry indeed to see what I look like, at this
juncture, but am fortunately spared the sight. Taylor is now talking to
me&mdash;I think about a near relation of his own married to a near
relation of an English Duke&mdash;but all reaches me through a haze, and
I dimly hear myself saying automatically at short intervals that I quite
agree with him, and he is perfectly right.</p>
<p>Situation saved by orchestra, which breaks into the "Blue Danube", and
Eugene, who invites me to dance. This I gladly do and am restored once
more to wakefulness. This is still further intensified by cup of black
coffee which I drink immediately after sitting down again, and yawn is
temporarily defeated.</p>
<p>Eugene talks about publishing, and I listen with interest, except for
tendency to look at his enormous eyelashes and wonder if he has any
sisters, and if theirs are equally good.</p>
<p>Presently Ramona announces that it is two o'clock, and what about
Harlem? We all agree that Harlem is the next step, and once more emerge
into the night.</p>
<p>By the time we are all in a taxi, general feeling has established
itself that we are all old friends, and know one another very well
indeed. I look out at the streets, marvellously lighted, and remember
that I must get Christmas presents for the maids at home. Decide on two
pairs of silk stockings for Florence, who is young, but Cook presents
more difficult problem. Cannot believe that silk stockings would be
really acceptable, and in any case feel doubtful of obtaining requisite
size. What about hand-bag? Not very original, and could be equally well
obtained in England. Book out of the question, as Cook has often
remarked, in my hearing, that reading is a sad waste of time.</p>
<p>At this juncture Taylor suddenly remarks that he sees I am extremely
observant, I take mental notes of my surroundings all the time, and he
has little doubt that I am, at this very moment, contrasting the night
life of America with the night life to which I am accustomed in London
and Paris. I say Yes, yes, and try not to remember that the night life to
which I am accustomed begins with letting out the cat at half-past ten
and winding the cuckoo-clock, and ends with going straight to bed and to
sleep until eight o'clock next morning.</p>
<p>Slight pause follows Taylor's remark, and I try to look as observant
and intelligent as I can, but am relieved when taxi stops, and we get out
at the Cotton Club, Harlem.</p>
<p>Coloured girls, all extremely nude, are dancing remarkably well on
stage, coloured orchestra is playing&mdash;we all say that Of course they
understand Rhythm as nobody else in the world does&mdash;and the usual
necessity prevails of screaming very loudly in order to be heard above
all the other people who are screaming very loudly.</p>
<p><i>(Query:</i> Is the effect of this perpetual shrieking repaid by the
value of the remarks we exchange? <i>Answer:</i> Definitely, No.)</p>
<p>Coloured dancers, after final terrific jerkings, retire, and
spectators rise up from their tables and dance to the tune of "Stormy
Weather", and we all say things about Rhythm all over again.</p>
<p>Sleep shortly afterwards threatens once more to overwhelm me, and I
drink more black coffee. At half-past three Ramona suggests that perhaps
we have now explored the night life of New York sufficiently, I agree
that we have, and the party breaks up. I say that I have enjoyed my
evening&mdash;which is perfectly true&mdash;and thank them all very
much.</p>
<p>Take one look at myself in the glass on reaching my room again, and
decide that gay life is far from becoming to me, at any rate at four
o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Last thought before dropping to sleep is that any roaring that may be
indulged in by the lions of Central Park under my window will probably
pass unnoticed by me, after hearing the orgy of noise apparently
inseparable from the night life of New York.</p>
<p><i>December 1st.</i>&mdash;Attend final lunch-party, given by Ella
Wheelwright, and at which she tells me that I shall meet Mr. Allen.
Experience strong inclination to scream and say that I can't, I'm the
only person in America who hasn't read his book&mdash;but Ella says No,
no&mdash;she doesn't mean Hervey Allen at all, she means Frederick Lewis
Allen, who did <i>American Procession.</i> This, naturally, is a very
different thing, and I meet Mr. Allen and his wife with perfect calm, and
like them both very much. Also meet English Colonel Roddie, author of
<i>Peace Patrol,</i> which I haven't read, but undertake to buy for
Robert's Christmas present, as I think it sounds as though he might like
it.</p>
<p>Female guests consist of two princesses&mdash;one young and the other
elderly, both American, and both wearing enormous pearls. Am reminded of
Lady B. and experience uncharitable wish that she could be here, as
pearls far larger than hers, and reinforced with colossal diamonds and
sapphires into the bargain. Wish also that convention and good manners
alike did not forbid my frankly asking the nearest princess to let me
have a good look at her black pearl ring, diamond bracelet and
wrist-watch set in rubies and emeralds.</p>
<p>Remaining lady strikes happy medium between dazzling display of
princesses, and my own total absence of anything except old-fashioned
gold wedding-ring&mdash;not even platinum&mdash;and modest diamond ring
inherited from Aunt Julia&mdash;and tells me that she is the wife of a
stockbroker. I ought, she thinks, to see the New York Exchange, and it
will be a pleasure to take me all over it. Thank her very much, and
explain that I am sailing at four o'clock to-morrow. She says: We could
go in the morning. Again thank her very much, but my packing is not
finished, and am afraid it will be impossible. Then, she says
indomitably, what about this afternoon? It could, she is sure, be
managed. Thank her more than ever, and again decline, this time without
giving any specific reason for doing so.</p>
<p>She is unresentful, and continues to talk to me very nicely after we
have left the dining-room. Ella and the two princesses ignore us both,
and talk to one another about Paris, the Riviera and clothes.</p>
<p>Ella, however, just before I take my leave, undergoes a slight change
of heart&mdash;presumably&mdash;and reminds me that she has promised to
come and see me off, and will lunch with me at the Essex and take me to
the docks. She unexpectedly adds that she is sending me round a book for
the voyage&mdash;<i>Anthony Adverse.</i> Am horrified, but not in the
least surprised, to hear myself thanking her effusively, and saying how
very much I shall look forward to reading it.</p>
<p>Stockbroking lady offers me a lift in her car, and we depart together.
She again makes earnest endeavour on behalf of the Stock Exchange, but I
am unable to meet her in any way, though grateful for evidently kind
intention.</p>
<p>Fulfil absolutely final engagement, which is at Colony Club, where I
naturally remember recent information received, that the members do
nothing but look at their wrist-watches. This, fortunately for me, turns
out to be libellous, at least so far as present audience is concerned.
All behave with the utmost decorum, and I deliver lecture, and conclude
by reading short extract from my own published work.</p>
<p>Solitary <i>contretemps</i> of the afternoon occurs here, when I hear
lady in front row enquire of her neighbour: What is she going to read?
Neighbour replies in lugubrious accents that she doesn't know, but it
will be <i>funny.</i> Feel that after this no wit of mine, however
brilliant, could be expected to succeed.</p>
<p>Day concludes with publisher calling for me in order to take me to a
party held at Englewood, New Jersey. He drives his own car, with the
result that we lose the way and arrive very late. Host says, Didn't we
get the little map that he sent out with the invitation? Yes, my
publisher says, he got it all right, but unfortunately left it at home.
Feel that this is exactly the kind of thing I might have done myself.</p>
<p>Pleasant evening follows, but am by now far too much excited by the
thought of sailing for home to-morrow to give my mind to anything
else.</p>
<p><i>December 2nd.</i>&mdash;Send purely gratuitous cable to Robert at
dawn saying that I am Just Off&mdash;which I shan't be till four o'clock
this afternoon&mdash;and then address myself once more to packing, with
which I am still struggling when Ella Wheelwright is announced. She is,
she says, too early, but she thought she might be able to help me.</p>
<p>This she does by sitting on bed and explaining to me that dark-red
varnish doesn't really suit her nails. Coral, yes, rose-pink, yes. But
not dark-red. Then why, I naturally enquire&mdash;with my head more or
less in a suit-case&mdash;does she put it on? Why? Ella repeats in
astonishment. Because she has to, of course. It's the only colour that
anyone is wearing now, so naturally she has no alternative. But it's too
bad, because the colour really doesn't suit her at all, and in fact she
dislikes it.</p>
<p>I make sounds that I hope may pass as sympathetic&mdash;though cannot
really feel that Ella has made out a very good case for herself as a
victim of unkind Fate&mdash;and go on packing and&mdash;still
more&mdash;unpacking.</p>
<p>Impossibility of fitting in present for Our Vicar's Wife, besides
dressing-slippers and travelling-clock of my own, overcomes me
altogether, and I call on Ella for help. This she reluctantly gives, but
tells me at the same time that her dress wasn't meant for a strain of any
kind, and may very likely split under the arms if she tries to lift
anything.</p>
<p>This catastrophe is fortunately spared us, and boxes are at last
closed and taken downstairs, hand-luggage remaining in
mountainous-looking pile, surmounted by tower of books. Ella looks at
these with distaste, and says that what I need is a Strap, and then
immediately presents me with <i>Anthony Adverse.</i> Should feel much
more grateful if she had only brought me a strap instead.</p>
<p>We go down to lunch in Persian Coffee Shop, and talk about Mrs.
Tressider, to whom Ella sends rather vague messages, of which only one
seems to me at all coherent&mdash;to the effect that she hopes The Boy is
stronger than he was. I promise, to deliver it, and even go so far as to
suggest that I should write and let Ella know what I think of The Boy
next time I see him. She very sensibly replies that I really needn't
trouble to do that, and I dismiss entire scheme forthwith. Discover after
lunch that rain is pouring down in torrents, and facetiously remark that
I may as well get used to it again, as I shall probably find the same
state of affairs on reaching England. Ella makes chilly reply to the
effect that the British climate always seems to her to be thoroughly
maligned, especially by the English&mdash;which makes me feel that I have
been unpatriotic. She then adds that she only hopes this doesn't, mean
that the <i>Berengaria</i> is in for a rough crossing.</p>
<p>Go upstairs to collect my belongings in mood of the deepest dejection.
Books still as unmanageable as ever, and I eventually take nine of them,
and Ella two, and carry them downstairs.</p>
<p>Achieve the docks by car, Ella driving. She reiterates that I ought to
have got a strap&mdash;especially when we find that long walk awaits us
before we actually reach gangway of the <i>Berengaria.</i></p>
<p>Hand-luggage proves too much for me altogether, and I twice drop
various small articles, and complete avalanche of literature.
Ella&mdash;who is comparatively lightly laden&mdash;walks on well ahead
of me and has sufficient presence of mind not to look behind
her&mdash;which is on the whole a relief to me.</p>
<p><i>Berengaria</i> looks colossal, and thronged with people. Steward,
who has been viewing my progress with&mdash;or without&mdash;the books,
compassionately, detaches himself from the crowd and comes to my
assistance. He will, he says, take me&mdash;and books&mdash;to my
cabin.</p>
<p>Ella and I then follow him for miles and miles, and Ella says
thoughtfully that I should be a long way from the deck if there was a
fire.</p>
<p>Cabin is filled, in the most gratifying way, with flowers and
telegrams. Also several parcels which undoubtedly contain more books.
Steward leaves us, and Ella sits on the edge of the bunk and says that
when she took her last trip to Europe her stateroom was exactly like a
florist's shop. Even the stewardess said she'd never seen anything like
it, in fifteen years' experience.</p>
<p>Then, I reply with spirit, she couldn't ever have seen a film star
travelling. Film stars, to my certain knowledge, have to engage, one, if
not two, extra cabins solely to accommodate flowers, fruit, literature
and other gifts bestowed upon them. This remark not a success with
Ella&mdash;never thought it would be&mdash;and she says very soon
afterwards that perhaps I should like to unpack and get straight, and she
had better leave me.</p>
<p>Escort her on deck&mdash;lose the way several times and thoughts again
revert to probable unpleasant situation in the event of a fire&mdash;and
we part.</p>
<p>Ella's last word to me is an assurance that she will be longing to
hear of my safe arrival, and everyone always laughs at her because she
gets such quantities of night letters and cables from abroad, but how can
she help it, if she has so many friends? Mine to her
is&mdash;naturally&mdash;an expression of gratitude for all her kindness.
We exchange final reference to Mrs. Tressider, responsible for bringing
us together&mdash;she is to be given Ella's love&mdash;The Boy should be
outgrowing early delicacy by this time&mdash;and I lean over the side and
watch Ella, elegant to the last in hitherto unknown grey squirrel coat,
take her departure.</p>
<p>Look at fellow-travellers surrounding me, and wonder if I am going to
like any of them&mdash;outlook not optimistic, and doubtless they feel
the same about me. Suddenly perceive familiar figure&mdash;Mademoiselle
is making her way towards me. She mutters <i>Dieu! quelle
canaille!</i>&mdash;which I think is an unnecessarily strong way of
expressing herself&mdash;and I remove myself and her to adjacent saloon,
where we sit in armchairs and Mademoiselle presents me with a small
chrysanthemum in a pot.</p>
<p>She is in very depressed frame of mind, sheds tears, and tells me that
many a fine ship has been <i>englouti par les vagues</i> and that it
breaks her heart to think of my two unhappy little children left without
their mother. I beg Mademoiselle to take a more hopeful outlook, but at
this she shows symptoms of being offended, so hastily add that I have
often known similar misgivings myself&mdash;which is true. <i>Ah,</i>
replies Mademoiselle lugubriously, <i>les pressentiments, les
pressentiments!</i> and we are again plunged in gloom.</p>
<p>Suggest taking her to see my cabin, as affording possible distraction,
and we accordingly proceed there, though not by any means without
difficulty.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, at sight of telegrams, again says <i>Mon Dieu!</i> and
begs me to open them at once, in case of bad news. I do so, and am able
to assure her that they contain only amiable wishes for a good journey
from kind American friends. Mademoiselle&mdash;evidently in overwrought
condition altogether&mdash;does not receive this as I had hoped, but
breaks into floods of tears and says that she is suffering from <i>mal du
pays</i> and <i>la nostalgie.</i></p>
<p>Mistake this for neuralgia, and suggest aspirin, and this error
fortunately restores Mademoiselle to comparative cheerfulness. Does not
weep again until we exchange final and affectionate farewells on deck,
just as gang-plank is about to be removed. <i>Vite!</i> shrieks
Mademoiselle, dashing down it, and achieving the dock in great
disarray.</p>
<p>I wave good-bye to her, and <i>Berengaria</i> moves off. Dramatic
moment of bidding Farewell to America is then entirely ruined for me by
unknown Englishwoman who asks me severely if that was a friend of
mine?</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>Very well. It reminds her of an extraordinary occasion when her son
was seeing her off from Southampton. He remained too long in the
cabin&mdash;very devoted son, anxious to see that all was comfortable for
his mother&mdash;and when he went up on deck, what do I think had
happened?</p>
<p>Can naturally guess this without the slightest difficulty, but feel
that it would spoil the story if I do, so only say What? in anxious tone
of voice, as though I had no idea at all. The ship, says unknown
Englishwoman impressively, had moved several yards away from the dock.
And what do I suppose her son did then?</p>
<p>He swam, I suggest.</p>
<p>Not at all. He jumped. Put one hand on the rail, and simply leapt. And
he just made it. One inch less, and he would have been in the water. But
as it was, he just landed on the dock. It was a most frightful thing to
do, and upset her for the whole voyage. She couldn't get over it at all.
Feel rather inclined to suggest that she hasn't really got over it yet,
if she is compelled to tell the story to complete stranger&mdash;but have
no wish to be unsympathetic, so reply instead that I am glad it all ended
well. Yes, says Englishwoman rather resentfully&mdash;but it upset her
for the rest of the voyage.</p>
<p>Can see no particular reason why this conversation should ever end,
and less reason still why it should go on, so feel it better to smile and
walk away, which I do. Stewardess comes to my cabin later, and is very
nice and offers to bring vases for flowers. Some of them, she thinks, had
better go on my table in dining-saloon.</p>
<p>I thank her and agree, and look at letters, telegrams and books. Am
gratified to discover note from Mr. Alexander Woollcott, no less. He has,
it appears, two very distinguished friends also travelling on the
<i>Berengaria,</i> and they will undoubtedly come and introduce
themselves to me, and make my acquaintance. This will, writes Mr. W.
gracefully, be to the great pleasure and advantage of all of us.</p>
<p>Am touched, but know well that none of it will happen, <i>(a)</i>
because the distinguished friends are travelling first-class and I am
not, and <i>(b)</i> because I shall all too certainly be laid low
directly the ship gets into the open sea, and both unwilling and unable
to make acquaintance with anybody.</p>
<p>Unpack a few necessities&mdash;am forcibly reminded of similar
activities on s.s. <i>Statendam</i> and realise afresh that I really am
on my way home and need not become agitated at mere sight of children's
photographs&mdash;and go in search of dining-saloon.</p>
<p>Find myself at a table with three Canadian young gentlemen who all
look to me exactly alike&mdash;certainly brothers, and quite possibly
triplets&mdash;and comparatively old acquaintance whose son performed
athletic feat at Southampton Docks.</p>
<p>Enormous mountain of flowers decorates the middle of the
table&mdash;everybody says Where do these come from? and I admit
ownership and am evidently thought the better of thenceforward:</p>
<p>Much greater triumph, however, awaits me when table-steward, after
taking a good look at me, suddenly proclaims that he and I were on board
s.s. <i>Mentor</i> together in 1922. Overlook possibly scandalous
interpretation to which his words may lend themselves, and admit to s.s.
<i>Mentor.</i> Table-steward, in those days, was with the Blue Funnel
line. He had the pleasure, he says, of waiting upon my husband and myself
at the Captain's table. He remembers us perfectly, and I have changed
very little.</p>
<p>At this my prestige quite obviously goes up by leaps and bounds, and
English fellow-traveller&mdash;name turns out to be Mrs. Smiley&mdash;and
Canadian triplets all gaze at me with awe-stricken expressions.</p>
<p>Behaviour of table-steward does nothing towards diminishing this, as
he makes a point of handing everything to me first, and every now and
then breaks off in the performance of his duties to embark on agreeable
reminiscences of our earlier acquaintance.</p>
<p>Am grateful for so much attention, but feel very doubtful if I shall
be able to live up to it all through voyage.</p>
<p><i>December 4th.</i>&mdash;Flowers have to be removed from cabin, and
books remain unread, but stewardess is kindness itself and begs me not to
think of moving.</p>
<p>I do not think of moving.</p>
<p><i>December 5th.</i>&mdash;Stewardess tells me that storm has been
frightful, and surpassed any in her experience. Am faintly gratified at
this&mdash;Why?&mdash;and try not to think that she probably says exactly
the same thing more or less every voyage to every sea-sick passenger.</p>
<p>Practically all her ladies, she adds impressively, have been laid low,
and one of the stewardesses. And this reminds her: the table-steward who
looks after me in the dining-saloon has enquired many times how I am
getting on, and if there is anything I feel able to take, later on, I
have only to let him know.</p>
<p>Am touched by this, and decide that I could manage a baked potato and
a dry biscuit. These are at once provided, and do me a great deal of
good. The stewardess encourages me, says that the sea is now perfectly
calm, and that I shall feel better well wrapped up on deck.</p>
<p>Feel that she is probably right, and follow her advice. Am quite
surprised to see numbers of healthy-looking people tramping about
vigorously, and others&mdash;less active, but still robust&mdash;sitting
in chairs with rugs round their legs. Take up this attitude myself, but
turn my back to the Atlantic Ocean, which does not seem to me quite to
deserve eulogies bestowed upon it by stewardess. Canadian triplets
presently go past&mdash;all three wearing black b&eacute;rets&mdash;and
stop and ask how I am. They have, they say, missed me in the dining-room.
I enquire How they are getting on with Mrs. Smiley? and they look at one
another with rather hunted expressions, and one of them says Oh, she
talks a good deal.</p>
<p>Can well believe it.</p>
<p>Alarming thought occurs to me that she may be occupying the chair next
mine, but inspection of card on the back of it reveals that this is not
so, and that I am to be privileged to sit next to Mr. H. Cyril de Mullins
Green. Am, most unjustly, at once conscious of being strongly prejudiced
against him. Quote Shakespeare to myself in a very literary
way&mdash;What's in a Name?&mdash;and soon afterwards doze.</p>
<p>Day passes with extreme slowness, but not unpleasantly. Decide that I
positively must write and thank some of the people who so kindly sent me
flowers and books for journey, but am quite unable to rouse myself to the
extent of fetching writing materials from cabin. Take another excursion
into the realms of literature and quote to myself from Mrs. Gamp: "Rouge
yourself, Mr. Chuffey"&mdash;but all to no avail.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon Mr. H. Cyril de Mullins Green materialises as
pale young man with horn-rimmed glasses and enormous shock of black hair.
He tells me&mdash;in rather resentful tone of voice&mdash;that he knows
my name, and adds that <i>he writes himself</i> Feel inclined to reply
that I Thought as Much&mdash;but do not do so. Enquire
instead&mdash;though not without misgivings as to tactfulness of the
question&mdash;with whom the works of Mr. H. C. de M. G. are published?
He mentions a firm of which I have never heard, and I reply Oh really? as
if I had known all about them for years, and the conversation drops.
Remain on deck for dinner, but have quite a good one nevertheless, and
immediately afterwards go down below.</p>
<p><i>December 6th.</i>&mdash;Receive cable from Robert, saying All Well
and he will meet me at Southampton. This has definitely bracing effect,
and complete recovery sets in.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smiley, in my absence, has acquired complete domination over
Canadian triplets, and monopolises conversation at meals. She appears
only moderately gratified by my restoration to health, and says that she
herself has kept her feet throughout. She has, also, won a great deal at
Bridge, played deck tennis and organised a treasure-hunt which was a
great success. To this neither I nor the Canadians have anything to
counter, but after a time the youngest-looking of the triplets mutters
rather defiantly that they have walked four miles every day, going round
and round the deck. I applaud this achievement warmly, and Mrs. Smiley
says that Those calculations are often defective, which silences us all
once mire.</p>
<p>Learn that concert has been arranged for the evening-Mrs. Smiley has
taken very active part in organising this and is to play several
accompaniments&mdash;and H. Cyril de Mullins G. tells me later that he
hopes it won't give great offence if he keeps away, but he cannot endure
amateur performances of any sort or kind. As for music, anything other
than Bach is pure torture to him. I suggest that in that case he must
suffer quite a lot in the dining-saloon, where music quite other than
Bach is played regularly, and he asks in a pained way whether I haven't
noticed that he very seldom comes to the dining-saloon at all? He cannot,
as a rule, endure the sight of his fellow-creatures eating. It revolts
him. For his own part, he very seldom eats anything at all. No breakfast,
an apple for lunch, and a little red wine, fish and fruit in the evening
is all that he ever requires. I say, rather enviously, How cheap! and
suggest that this must make housekeeping easy for his mother, but H. C.
de M. G. shudders a good deal and replies that he hasn't lived with his
parents for years and years and thinks family life extremely
<i>bourgeois.</i> As it seems obvious that Cyril and I differ on almost
every point of importance, I decide that we might as well drop the
conversation, and open new novel by L. A. G. Strong that I want to
read.</p>
<p>Modern fiction! says Cyril explosively. How utterly lousy it all is!
He will, he admits, give me Shaw&mdash;(for whom I haven't
asked)&mdash;but there are no writers living to-day. Not one. I say Come,
Come, what about ourselves? but Mr. de M. G. evidently quite impervious
to this witty shaft and embarks on very long monologue, in the course of
which he demolishes many worldwide reputations. Am extremely thankful
when we are interrupted by Mrs. Smiley, at the sight of whom C. de M. G.
at once gets on to his feet and walks away. (Deduce from this that they
have met before.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Smiley has come, she tells me, in order to find out if I will
give a little Reading from Something of my Own at to-night's concert. No,
I am very sorry, but I cannot do anything of the kind. Now <i>why?</i>
Mrs. S. argumentatively enquires. No one will be critical, in fact as
likely as not they won't listen, but it will <i>give pleasure.</i> Do I
not believe in brightening this sad old world when I get the chance? For
Mrs. Smiley's own part, she never grudges a little trouble if it means
happiness for others. Naturally, getting up an entertainment of this kind
means hard work, and probably no thanks at the end of it&mdash;but she
feels it's a duty. That's all. Just simply a duty. I remain unresponsive,
and Mrs. S. shakes her head and leaves me.</p>
<p>(If I see or hear any more of Mrs. S. shall almost certainly feel it
my duty, if not my pleasure, to kick her overboard at earliest possible
opportunity.)</p>
<p>Concert duly takes place, in large saloon, and
everyone&mdash;presumably with the exception of Cyril&mdash;attends it.
Various ladies sing ballads, mostly about gardens or little boys with
sticky fingers&mdash;a gentleman plays a concertina solo, not well, and
another gentleman does conjuring tricks. Grand <i>finale</i> is a topical
song, said to have been written by Mrs. Smiley, into which references to
all her fellow-passengers are introduced not without ingenuity. Should
much like to know how she has found out so much about them all in the
time.</p>
<p>Appeal is then made&mdash;by Mrs. Smiley&mdash;for Naval Charity to
which we are all asked to subscribe&mdash;Mrs. Smiley springs round the
room with a tambourine, and we all drop coins into it&mdash;and we
disperse.</p>
<p>Obtain glimpse, as I pass smoking-saloon, of Mr. H. Cyril de Mullins
Green drinking what looks like brandy-and-soda, and telling elderly
gentleman&mdash;who has, I think, reached senility&mdash;that English
Drama has been dead&mdash;absolutely <i>dead</i>&mdash;ever since the
Reformation.</p>
<p><i>December 7th.</i>&mdash;Pack for&mdash;I hope&mdash;the last time,
and spend most of the day listening to various reports that We shan't be
in before midnight, We shall get in by four o'clock this afternoon, and
We can't get in to-day at all.</p>
<p>Finally notice appears on a board outside dining-saloon, informing us
that we shall get to Southampton at nine P.M. and that dinner will be
served at six&mdash;(which seems to me utterly
unreasonable).&mdash;Luggage to be ready and outside cabins at four
o'clock. (More unreasonable still.) Every possible preparation is
completed long before three o'clock, and I feel quite unable to settle
down to anything at all, and am reduced to watching Mrs. Smiley play
table-tennis with one of the Canadian triplets, and beat him into a
cocked hat.</p>
<p>Dinner takes place at six o'clock&mdash;am far too much excited to eat
any&mdash;and from thence onward I roam uneasily about from one side of
ship to the other, and think that every boat I see is tender from
Southampton conveying Robert to meet me.</p>
<p>Am told at last by deck-steward&mdash;evidently feeling sorry for
me&mdash;that tender is the <i>other</i> side, and I rush there
accordingly, and hang over the side and wave passionately to familiar
figure in blue suit. Familiar figure turns out to be that of complete
stranger.</p>
<p>Scan everybody else in advancing tender, and decide that I have at
last sighted Robert&mdash;raincoat and felt hat&mdash;but nerve has been
rather shattered and am doubtful about waving. This just as well, as
raincoat is afterwards claimed by unknown lady in tweed coat and skirt,
who screams: Is that you, Dad? and is in return hailed with: Hello, Mum,
old girl! how are you!</p>
<p>I decide that Robert has <i>(a)</i> had a stroke from excitement,
<i>(b)</i> been summoned to the death-bed of one of the children,
<i>(c)</i> missed the tender.</p>
<p>Remove myself from the rail in dejection, and immediately come face to
face with Robert, who has mysteriously boarded the ship unperceived. Am
completely overcome, and disgrace myself by bursting into tears.</p>
<p>Robert pats me very kindly and strolls away and looks at entirely
strange pile of luggage whilst I recover myself. Recovery is accelerated
by Mrs. Smiley, who comes up and asks me If that is my husband? to which
I reply curtly that it is, and turn my back on her.</p>
<p>Robert and I sit down on sofa outside the dining-saloon, and much talk
follows, only interrupted by old friend the table-steward, who hurries
out and greets Robert with great enthusiasm, and says that he will
personally see my luggage through the Customs.</p>
<p>This he eventually does, with the result that we get through with
quite unnatural rapidity, and have a choice of seats in boat-train. Say
good-bye to old friend cordially, and with suitable recognition of his
services.</p>
<p>Robert tells me that He is Glad to See Me Again, and that the place
has been very quiet. I tell him in return that I never mean to leave home
again as long as I live, and ask if there are any letters from the
children?</p>
<p>There is one from each, and I am delighted. Furthermore, says Robert,
Our Vicar's Wife sent her love, and hopes that we will both come to tea
on Thursday, five o'clock, <i>not</i> earlier because of the Choir
Practice.</p>
<p>Agree with the utmost enthusiasm that this will be delightful, and
feel that I am indeed Home again.</p>
