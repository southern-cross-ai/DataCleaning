  <h2><a name="ch0"
     id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p>This little book is intended to serve as a reminder of some facts
  concerning the ancient ceremony of "the crowning of the King," that may be of
  interest to those whose attention is turned, as the attention of so many
  people, of so many lands, will be turned to the rites and pageantry attendant
  on the coronation of His Majesty King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Much of what we term "romance," and many beautiful, odd and moving
  anecdotes and traditions have, during the ages, become attached to the
  installation of the Sovereign in various countries; a selection from this
  material is offered here, together with a brief mention of those cities for
  so long associated with coronations, in many of which, perhaps, no monarch
  will ever again be enthroned and crowned.</p>

  <p>The book is for the general reader and no attempt has been made to deal
  exhaustively with any aspect of the vast subject; accuracy has been striven
  for where matters of fact are concerned, but some anecdotes touch on the
  fascinating world of legend, and are given as such, while there are points
  debatable among the learned that can only be given under reserve and with due
  deference to expert opinion.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a> I. &mdash; THE PAGEANTRY, RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE<br>
  AND SYMBOLISM OF THE CORONATION CEREMONY</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is perhaps no more significant ceremony than that of
  the crowning of the King. It is a double bond, a double promise, one between
  God and the King, one between the King and his people. The King becomes
  something more than himself: he is not only symbolical of a whole people,
  their virtues, strength, excellencies and magnificence, but he was for long
  considered, and in many cases still is, God's Vice-gerent on earth, a man
  Divinely appointed to rule over a chosen nation.</p>

  <p>It is a ceremony of triumph and of gladness, and in every country has
  always been celebrated with the greatest pomp and a wealth of gorgeous
  details. Most of these are symbolical; the meaning of some is still obvious,
  that of others has become clouded, portions of the ancient ceremony have
  become obsolete and been discarded, a few have now little meaning and are
  retained merely for their fitness and beauty.</p>

  <p>The first symbol of the coronation in importance is the crown. This is one
  of the oldest of human inventions; King David in the Psalms mentions the
  crown as an important item in the Consecration of the King:</p>

  <p><i>"Thou hast set a crown of pure gold upon his head."</i></p>

  <p>We do not know exactly the form of this Biblical crown. The oldest emblems
  of sovereignty seem to have been a fillet of pure white undyed wool, which
  signified that the wearer was set apart to rule direct from God and not
  merely elected by the wish of the people. This was worn by the priests and
  was the kind of crown that was offered to Julius Caesar in the market place,
  that he was afraid to accept; it is notable that for three hundred years no
  Roman Emperor dared to wear a crown, though on their coins they are
  represented with their brows bound by this impressive symbol. The Greek Kings
  wore the <i>vitta,</i> a ribbon tied in a knot behind the head.</p>

  <p>It is believed that the first regal head-dresses took the form either of
  this sacred band of pure white virgin wool or of a silk scarf embroidered
  with jewels. These bandages or fillets probably had their origin in the
  handkerchiefs worn by athletes round their brows to catch the sweat when they
  were at their games. This fillet was termed <i>diadema,</i> from the Greek
  verb <i>to bind,</i> and the diadem, not the crown, was the original emblem
  of sovereignty.</p>

  <p>The word crown is from <i>corona,</i> and the Romans had six important
  crowns that they gave to their great or successful men; the most splendid of
  these was the <i>Corona Triumphalis</i> conferred on a general returning
  triumphant from a war; it consisted of a plain wreath of laurels tied by a
  ribbon at the back and clasping a star in front.</p>

  <h3>PAGEANTRY AND SYMBOLISM</h3>

  <p class="first">The <i>Corona Obsidionalis</i> was given to a general by a
  garrison that he had saved from a siege; it was originally woven from grass
  snatched from a nearby tussock after the relief of the town. Crowns of bay
  were worn by military leaders who had been successful in a less resplendent
  way. The crown given for saving a citizen's life in battle was of oak leaves,
  the <i>Corona Civica;</i> this carried with it the privilege of freedom from
  taxes. For storming a wall there was the golden <i>Corona Muralis,</i> and
  for first climbing the wall of an enemy camp the <i>Corona Castrensis.</i>
  The naval crown, with ornaments representing the beak or prow of a ship, was
  given to those sailors who, in battle, first boarded an enemy vessel. The
  garland of bay survived all the other crowns, and it is this that the Roman
  Emperors wear on their coins; it was used on the medals of sovereigns until
  recently.</p>

  <p>Victorious soldiers in ancient times were offered golden crowns by their
  allies and friends; the Greeks had the crown of bay as a symbol of office and
  honour; originally these crowns were made of real leaves and berries, but
  later of gold and precious metals fashioned to represent bay or laurel.
  Crowns, too, were used at religious rites, and, in the form of coronals of
  flowers, at festivals and banquets; in the winter the ancients wore crowns
  made of dried flowers or painted wood; the industry of making these crowns
  was in the hands of women and was a highly skilled craft.</p>

  <p>The raised crown was introduced in the first century A.D., and was
  supposed to be the sign of the Emperor of the World. It represented the sun,
  as did the magnificent and formidable crowns of ancient Egypt. When the Roman
  Empire was divided, the Emperors of the East adopted the fillets of silk set
  with pearls and the Emperors of the West, the crown with spikes of gold; this
  form was afterwards adopted by all the Christian Kings, the spikes being
  altered in shape, set with pearls or jewels or crosses, or <i>fleurs de
  lis</i> placed on the points. The Byzantine circlet, formed of square plates,
  added to the Persian <i>cidaris</i> or tiara, forms the model for all
  subsequent crowns including those of popes and doges. Christian Kings always
  surmounted the crown with the Cross; convenience afterwards caused it to be
  padded with velvet and fur. This inner cap of rich material makes its first
  English appearance on a great seal of Henry VIII.</p>

  <p>In order to emphasise the sacred character of the ceremony, it was always
  the High Priest in ancient times who crowned the King. In the short-lived
  Lutheran kingdom of Prussia, where there were no bishops, the King crowned
  himself; he used to take the diadem off the altar and put it on his own head;
  the Czars of Muscovy also crowned themselves. The Western Christian symbolism
  is, however, that the kingly office is conferred, not assumed, and of Divine
  origin; the French Kings definitely, the English Kings vaguely, entered the
  priesthood.</p>

  <p>The robes of the King were always as rare and splendid as befitted the
  occasion, and colours, not only symbolic of magnificence and power, but
  gorgeous in themselves, were always chosen&mdash;the richest blues, purples
  and crimsons, and the finest materials of silk, velvets and linens, adorned
  with as many jewels and as much gold as the people could afford; crimson,
  scarlet and purple were also the most costly and difficult dyes.</p>

  <p>In almost every country the crown jewels used to be the first treasure of
  the realm; they were guarded most jealously, not only on account of their
  value, but because of their association and half-sacred meaning; for
  instance, the iron crown of the Lombards, still to be seen in Italy, is of no
  intrinsic value, but priceless because it represented the sovereignty of a
  proud people; in Budapest is still preserved the crown of Saint Stephen that
  represented the pride and glory of Hungary. The anointing of the King also is
  of profound religious significance. The ceremony is described in the Old
  Testament; Saul, the first King of the Israelites, was anointed by Samuel
  with a phial of oil which was poured on his head, the prophet saying:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain
  over his inheritance?"</p>

  <p>The oil (Chrism) was supposed to confer a specific grace, and the
  believers in the Divine Right of Kings thought that it gave the Sovereign a
  certain Divinity, so that, however unworthy he might be as a man, he was
  infallible as a Monarch; this was the attitude taken up by the <i>non
  jurors,</i> after the deposition of James II&mdash;though many of them had
  opposed his measures they could never accept another Monarch while the
  anointed King lived.</p>

  <p>It was the anointing that gave the power of "touching" for the King's evil
  (scrofula); the Kings of France exercised this power three days after their
  coronations, and seemingly in their capacity as priests; the Kings of England
  were <i>persona mixta,</i> their office being considered half-sacred,
  half-secular, but they all claimed this miraculous power.</p>

  <p>Ardent Jacobites claimed that Lord Derwentwater, son of an illegitimate
  daughter of Charles II, had this Divine gift, and as a descendant of an
  anointed King was able to work miracles of healing. The Chrism was supposed
  to have been sent from Heaven by a Dove to Clovis, King of the Franks, and
  brought by the Virgin Mary to St. Thomas à Becket.</p>

  <p>The ancient ceremonial of the Kings of France, who were crowned at Rheims,
  had an even stronger religious character than had the English coronations;
  the Kings of France proclaimed with much emphasis the sacredness of their
  position; by the anointing they were set apart from other men even more
  definitely than was the English monarch. The most remarkable assertion of
  this claim was that when St. Joan took the Dauphin (afterwards Charles VIII)
  to Rheims and crowned him in direct obedience, as was believed, to the Divine
  Will.</p>

  <p>From this religious attitude sprang the political doctrine that was for so
  long so powerful that of "the Divine Right" of the anointed King, as opposed
  to the other doctrine that a King was elected by the people, and his rule and
  power only rested on his keeping a bargain with the people.</p>

  <p>The word Chrism, given to the anointing oil, signifies grace; the belief
  was widely held that a King, once crowned, remained a King, as a Christian,
  once baptised, remained a Christian; one might become an exiled, dethroned
  King or a renegade Christian, but that was not the same thing as never having
  been a King or never having been a Christian. Hence there was always great
  eagerness on the part of any Pretender to a throne, or lawful successor to a
  throne, to be crowned as soon as possible; an uncrowned King never had much
  authority and was usually regarded as a mere adventurer, however good his
  claim. The setting apart of the King for his high function by means of a
  religious ceremony surrounded him with majesty and a certain terror:</p>

  <p class="quote">"There is a Divinity doth hedge in a King."</p>

  <p>After the King had been anointed and crowned he assumed a sacred
  character; an injury against the King was more than treason&mdash;it was
  blasphemy. The anointing was done on the head, hands and over the heart.</p>

  <p>The sceptre is another very ancient symbol, obviously deriving from the
  staff or baton of command; it was used to point with, and to administer
  chastisement; the Old Testament speaks of King Ahasuerus as having a golden
  sceptre. The King holds it in his right hand at the coronation; various
  countries have given different ornamentations to the sceptre, usually of a
  symbolic character.</p>

  <p>The King's left hand, when he is formally enthroned, holds the orb, first
  seen on the reverse of the coins of the later Roman Empire. It obviously
  represents the ball of the world and was used by the Emperors of the West,
  claiming control over the whole civilised world. It was used by the Saxon
  Kings of England and may be seen on their coins. A coin of Edward the
  Confessor shows him crowned and throned, with a long staff or sceptre in one
  hand and an orb in the other. There arc golden pennies of Henry III and Henry
  VIII with the sword, instead of the sceptre, in the right hand and the orb in
  the left. The orb, like the clown, is surmounted by the Cross; the Kings of
  Spain had an apple of gold instead of the globe.</p>

  <p>Many of the garments kept specially for this occasion, that the King wears
  at his crowning, are priestly in origin, as the stole. The other vestments,
  the silk dalmatic, the tunic, the buskins and sandals, the spurs and the
  various swords, all date from later times, mostly those of chivalry, and are
  part of the equipment of a knight. They are kept to enhance the beauty of
  this elaborate ritual and all have a lofty and even beautiful meaning; for
  instance, the blunt-edged sword, <i>Curtana,</i> showing Mercy.</p>

  <p>The robes and undergarments were copied by the sovereigns of Western
  Europe from those worn by Charlemagne; these were found on the corpse of the
  great Emperor when his tomb was opened by Frederic Barbarossa in 116 5;
  Frederic II also was buried in the Imperial dalmatic, boots and tunic; as
  late as the eighteenth century, the Holy Roman Emperors reserved to
  themselves the privilege of scarlet stockings.</p>

  <p>These early regal garments were always of costly, sometimes of almost
  priceless, materials. The most beautiful colour combinations, the most
  exquisite embroidery, were employed. It was remarked that at the coronation
  of Anne Boleyn an unusual extravagance was permitted&mdash;the hangings in
  Westminster Abbey were of pure gold tissue, that is, warp and woof were both
  of the precious metal, instead of one being silk; some of the hangings were
  so heavy that they had to be kept on rollers and worked up and down by little
  pulleys. Some of the coronation dresses of the Queens of France were so stiff
  with gold that they were reckoned to weigh as much as a suit of armour, and
  only heroic endurance could support them even for a few hours.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that a peeress's robes for the coronation will cost, in
  the finest materials, £500. For the coronation of Elizabeth it cost more to
  fit out a noble's wife; plain narrow satin was fourteen shillings a yard,
  taffeta the same price, velvet went up to nine pounds a yard; huge quantities
  of material were used, and embroidery, laces, ribbons, buttons and so on,
  added greatly to the cost. "Velvet on velvet" or "velvet on satin" with two
  or three piles was the most luxurious material known, after the metallic
  tissues, and was used in coronation robes. Edward IV had many garments of
  these stuffs made for his crowning; the colours were black on white, blue on
  tawny, crimson on white and motley. Richard III had a resplendent mantle and
  train of velvet for his coronation, so magnificent that his cousin, the Duke
  of Buckingham, who had to carry it in the procession from the tower, was
  first seized by the sight of it with the envy that afterwards drove him into
  rebellion.</p>

  <p>Coronations set fashions; Elizabeth's installation was responsible for
  taffeta hats and crystal buttons; as early as 1403 Henry IV forbade the
  wearing of the choicest materials&mdash;cloth of gold, velvet or crimson
  cloth&mdash;to anyone below the rank of "banneret," even in coronation
  week.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to visualise the splendour of these ceremonies, such as
  coronations, weddings or christenings, when these superb hand-made,
  hand-worked materials were lavishly used and displayed in the intimacy of a
  narrow street or in some church or hall, where every inch of the walls,
  ceilings and floors was covered with rich stuffs, tapestries, Italian velvets
  and cloth of gold.</p>

  <p>It was always believed that the King, by reason of his consecration, could
  intercede with God for his people, and stood nearer to the Deity than others.
  It is obvious that one who was to be admired, obeyed and even worshipped,
  should be raised above his fellows; therefore, the idea of the throne is as
  old as that of the crown, the orb and the sceptre. The earliest thrones were,
  perhaps, the seats occupied by the priests near the altar, where they sat
  enthroned in awful majesty to receive supplicants and sacrifices; the Roman
  Consuls had the <i>curule</i> chair as a symbol of their authority. These
  classic seats of honour were lofty and had footstools, the backs were high
  and straight, the legs upright and there were arms at their sides. From this
  model most of the Christian thrones were copied.</p>

  <p>In primitive times Kings, rulers and chieftains sat on mounds, usually
  under a tree for the sake of the shade; St. Louis used thus to sit to
  administer justice, and Saxon Kings in the same manner sat on raised seats in
  the open air; these were probably like the more recent thrones used by
  African chieftains composed of turf and covered with skins and woven grass.
  More luxurious nations made their thrones into objects of great beauty. King
  Solomon had an ivory throne with lions; possibly these were mechanical and
  emitted roars. Many Eastern Kings had beasts as arms to their thrones that on
  pressure made angry sounds. The gorgeous peacock throne of the Tartar Kings
  was world famous; it was composed of solid gold with the markings of a
  peacock's tail in jewels. The Kings of Persia had dazzling thrones with
  golden pillars supporting canopies of rich purple silk; Mark Antony and
  Cleopatra sat on golden thrones in Egypt.</p>

  <p>The English throne is in the House of Lords; in the Abbey is the
  Coronation Chair, which was made to the order of Edward I; beneath it is the
  ancient Celtic stone taken from Scone by the same Monarch. The Celtic tribe
  usually owned such a stone for the crowning of their chieftain; there is one
  at Kingston-on-Thames that gives its name to the town, where many Saxon
  Kings, including Athelstan, who called himself King of All Britain, were
  crowned, and at Tara, the Irish had a similar stone for the crowning of the
  "High King" or chieftain; this stone was supposed to give forth a musical
  sound when the King stepped on it. These stones were usually supposed to be
  those that Jacob had used for his pillow when he saw the vision of the angels
  on the ladder going to and from Heaven.</p>

  <p>The stone in Westminster Abbey is of red sandstone and was brought to
  England in 1296. The chair has been marked all over by names and initials;
  these are supposed to be those of former scholars of Westminster School, when
  the boys used to have the run unchecked of the Abbey; there was, and perhaps
  still is, an inscription stating that one, "P. Abbot slept in the chair in
  Jan. 1801." The chair is usually covered with rich brocade, cushions and
  velvet, for a coronation; it has only once been taken from the Abbey&mdash;by
  Oliver Cromwell&mdash;when it was placed in Westminster Hall to serve as the
  Protector's seat.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Coronation Stone in Chair at Westminster</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>There is another coronation chair in the Abbey that was made for a unique
  occasion&mdash;the crowning of two sovereigns together; the first cousins,
  William and Mary, ruled as joint Sovereigns in equal right over Great
  Britain; this chair has never been used since and it is not likely ever to be
  again.</p>

  <p>The King, Emperor or Chieftain, used to be lifted up at his coronation,
  and, with the orb in one hand, the sceptre in the other, his glittering robes
  clasped over his breast and his raised crown or jewelled helm on his head,
  shown to the crowd so that there might be no confusion about the personality
  that had been accepted as leader of, and symbolic of, a people.</p>

  <p>The earliest form of this was the placing of their leader by the soldiery
  on their shields; a relic of this ancient custom is our modern "chairing" of
  some popular or successful person.</p>

  <p>As soon as the King is crowned&mdash;it must be emphasised that the entire
  people are supposed to have a part as individuals in this ceremony&mdash;the
  estates of the realm come to do him homage, first the Bishops, then the Lords
  temporal, then any tributary Princes there may be, as in the case of Great
  Britain, the Indian Princes; in England, after the homage, the Lords,
  spiritual and temporal, touch the orb and kiss the King's hand; this is
  symbolical of their resolution to defend the crown with their lives. The
  service of Holy Communion is then held, and the superstitious have remarked
  with delight that the only two English Kings who did not communicate on their
  coronation day were John and James II; both of them were exceedingly
  unfortunate monarchs.</p>

  <p>The elaborate and carefully worked-out ritual of the coronation of Kings
  of Great Britain has been little changed. The first mention of the coronation
  of British Kings is by Gildas, a monastic historian who wrote before 547; two
  hundred years later Egbert, Archbishop of York (A.D. 732-767) had set out an
  elaborate ritual for a coronation, and we know that the great and wise St.
  Dunstan placed a golden circlet on the brow of the boy Ethelred with full
  ceremonial in 979. The "Pontifical of Egbert" was elaborated for Richard II
  (1307) and in some form used for all subsequent English coronations; the
  book, <i>Liber Regalis,</i> still in Westminster Abbey, was written for this
  King's installation and contains a full account of all coronation rites and
  ceremonies. The ancient ritual was followed till the Reformation, when
  another service was employed for Edward VI; Mary and Elizabeth reverted to
  the Latin service. The old ceremonial was modified again for James I and
  finally mutilated by Sancroft for James II. At the coronation of William and
  Mary, when Sancroft refused to officiate, the service was badly muddled, no
  one "knew his part," and the King had not been told that he had to make an
  offering of a pound of gold, so there was a delay while the money was
  borrowed from one of the peers. This gold was originally meant to be a pound
  in weight, not in face value.</p>

  <p>As the country became more wealthy and was no longer torn by internal wars
  the coronation tended to become more elaborate and costly. A much enjoyed
  part of the pageantry was the banquet; highly relished also were the two
  processions on foot, from the Tower to the Abbey and vice versa, before and
  after the coronation, when the people of the capital had an opportunity of
  seeing all the great ones of the land grouped together in their most
  magnificent and picturesque array. This procession was discontinued by James
  II on the score of the expense, yet his crowning cost £60,000, most of which
  went on the Queen's dress.</p>

  <p>Naturally, between the coronation ceremony itself, the banquet and the two
  processions, there grew up a large number of offices, which became
  hereditary, and were jealously guarded as they carried with them gifts and
  privileges. This question became so complicated that an ancient Court of
  Claims was instituted; this dates at least from the coronation of Richard II.
  Two of the most important claims, those of the Bishops of Durham and of Bath
  and Wells, "to support the Sovereign" during the ceremony, have never been
  disputed, nor has that of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, "to instruct
  the King in the rites and ceremonies."</p>

  <p>Some of these privileges are exceedingly picturesque. The Duke of
  Newcastle, by virtue of the Manor of Worksop, was allowed to provide a glove
  for the King's right hand at the last coronation. The claim to carry a canopy
  over the King, if he wishes to have one, was last allowed to the Barons of
  the Cinque Ports; the Lord Mayor of London is usually allowed to bear the
  crystal mace.</p>

  <p>The great banquet in Westminster Hall was held for the last time at the
  coronation of George IV, and there, in all their glory, could have been seen
  the final representatives of the old offices of Chief Butler, Larderer,
  Carver, Naperer and so on. A hundred and one claims have been automatically
  disallowed by the discontinuation of the banquet; one was for the right to
  make wafers, another to be Serjeant of the Silver Scullery, another to serve
  the King with a towel before the banquet, and more curious still, the right
  to furnish "a mess of dillegrout," a kind of rich porridge that was
  especially made for the coronation banquet. It was made of coarse meal
  flavoured with still water and mingled with fat.</p>

  <p>The office of King's Champion was hereditary in the Dymoke family as
  owners of the Manor of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire, granted by William I to
  Robert de Marmion, the first Champion, from whom the Dymokes descended in the
  female line. The Rev. John Dymoke held this office at the coronation of
  George IV, his deputy, his son, mounted and in full armour, <i>cap-à pie,</i>
  with red, white and blue feathers in his helm, entered Westminster Hall,
  threw down his glove and challenged to mortal combat anyone who would dispute
  the King's right to the crown; the Sovereign then drank the health of the
  Champion in a silver gilt cup that afterwards was presented to him as his
  fee. This was the last appearance of the Champion. A Jacobite tradition says
  that at the coronation of George I, a follower of the Stewarts, disguised as
  a woman, slipped through the crowd and picked up the flung gauntlet, an
  incident used by Scott in <i>Redgauntlet.</i> A Dymoke was Champion at the
  coronation of Richard II; this is the first authentic record of this
  ceremony.</p>

  <p>All these offices were not only considered highly honourable in
  themselves, but were bountifully repaid by land tenure or other emoluments.
  Some accounts say that the Champion, for example, received the horse with
  trappings and the superb suit of armour that he wore and a gold or gilt cup
  and cover; others, that he received a sum of money in lieu of the equipment;
  at the coronation of William and Mary, the Champion not only claimed
  <i>two</i> cups, but kept the armour, at that of Anne he received £50 and
  bought his own outfit. The splendour of this may be gauged by the fact that
  the plumes of red, white and blue, worn by both the Knight and his horse,
  consisted of eighteen "falls" (tiers) surmounted by a "heron's top." The
  behaviour of the horse on these occasions was always a cause of grave
  anxiety, for the later Champions had to ride, armed at all points, into
  Westminster Hall where the banquet was held, cast down his gauntlet and
  deliver his challenge, then back out; if, therefore, the steed became restive
  the stately ceremonial was spoiled. At the coronation of George III, a trusty
  steed said to have been ridden by George II at Dettingen was chosen; if this
  was true, the animal was twenty years old at least. However, despite the care
  taken in choosing an ancient animal, the gallant bay insisted on
  <i>entering</i> the Hall backwards. Some stories say that it was the steed
  used by the Earl Marshal that made this odd entry.</p>

  <p>The office of "royal champion" is very old; there was a Champion in
  attendance on Charlemagne.</p>

  <p>The Regalia of England are kept in the Tower of London, and are one of
  "the sights" of the capital; they contain many famous and unique jewels and
  are among the few complete Regalia now left in Europe. When the French
  Regalia were seized at the time of the Revolution some of the crowns were
  found to contain glass jewels, the bankrupt Bourbons having long since
  abstracted the original stones; a magnificent treasure remained, however, one
  crown having eight thousand diamonds, among them two of fabulous value, the
  Sancy and the Regent; these were stolen from the royal <i>garde-meuble</i>
  and recovered by the police from the gutters of Paris. What is left of the
  French Regalia is in the museum of the Louvre.</p>

  <p>The superb jewels used at the coronations of the Emperors, of the Czars,
  of the Kings of Spain, have been scattered or are hidden; wars and
  revolutions have, in the last quarter of a century, dispersed most of the
  Regalia of Europe.</p>

  <p>Napoleon I's coronation ceremonial was in many ways unique; this military
  dictator worked out the ceremony for himself on new lines. There had not been
  an Emperor of France since the days of Charlemagne, and Napoleon, ignoring
  the Bourbon Lilies, chose as his emblem the little golden and cornelian
  ornaments said to have been found in the tomb of the Frankish King,
  Childeric, when it was opened in 1653; these were supposed to represent bees,
  but it seems more likely that these <i>fleurons</i> were the studs from the
  royal charger's harness. Napoleon used them on a green ground, believed to be
  the original Merovingian colour. This coronation did not take place at
  Rheims, but in Notre-Dame in Paris; it was dated by the Republican Calendar,
  AN13, but the Pope, Pius VII, was present, and though Napoleon crowned
  himself with a plain wreath of golden laurel, His Holiness consecrated the
  Imperial Regalia and offered the prayers; this is the only occasion on which
  a pope has left Italy to crown a sovereign.</p>

  <p>The French goldsmiths made a superb Imperial crown formed of eagles with
  upraised wings for Napoleon, who, a year after the ceremony in Paris, 1805,
  was crowned with great pomp in Milan with the famous Iron Crown of the
  Lombards. This famous crown is of Byzantine origin and the subject of many
  legends; it is stated that it was given by St. Helena to her son, the Emperor
  Constantine, and is supposed to have been presented by Gregory the Great to
  Queen Theodelinda. It is known that it was worn by Henry VII at his
  coronation in 1311 and whatever its age or history it is one of the most
  celebrated emblems of sovereignty in the world and was always guarded in the
  Cathedral of Monza with as much care as a sacred relic; it is an emblem only
  of sovereignty, it appears, as it is barely large enough to fit the head of a
  young child and it probably hung before the altar as a votive offering, the
  sovereign's head being merely touched with it during the consecration
  ceremony. The Iron Crown is of the ancient Byzantine shape of six plaques of
  fine gold, each with a jewel in the centre on a ground of green flower-strewn
  enamel, bent into the shape of a circlet; within the gold is the iron ring,
  supposed to have been made out of the nails used at the Crucifixion. The
  authenticity and subsequent sacred character of this crown were in active
  dispute among historians and priests until 1717, when it was decided that it
  might be "exposed to the adoration of the faithful and carried in
  processions." Napoleon's coronation was the subject of one of the most
  sumptuous publications ever undertaken&mdash;<i>Sacre de Napoléon dans
  l'Eglise de Notre-Dame,</i> 1804. Isabey made the superb drawings of the
  personages, ceremonies and pageantry of that great day of pomp and the most
  loving care was taken to render the book perfect; it was not finished by the
  time Napoleon was in exile and the restored Bourbons ordered the whole
  edition to be destroyed, only a few hidden or overlooked copies of this
  incomplete monument to human pride survived. The golden bees also
  disappeared. These little insects were an interesting, but short-lived
  symbol; Louis XVIII restored the Lilies and these shone in their silver
  splendour for the last time, 1824, when his brother, Charles X, was crowned
  with the full ancient ceremonial; Louis Philippe erased the Lilies from the
  Bourbon Shield, and his installation as King of the French&mdash;not as King
  of France and Navarre&mdash;was a simple affair; but as his devoted wife
  wrote to their children: "Papa looked very handsome in his robes." Thus
  vanished the famous "lilies of France" that some authorities believe to have
  been taken from the Egyptian Royal head-dress; the <i>fleur de lis</i> is
  possibly the lotus flower; others think it was inspired by the iris; this
  flower shows clearly on the heraldic Florentine "lily." A pretty legend says
  that the three golden lilies were brought from Heaven by an angel to
  Clotilda, wife of Clovis, when that King was converted to Christianity, and
  then took the place of the three toads Clovis had borne on his shield. This
  story is at least as old as the fifteenth century, for in the Bedford Missal,
  offered to the infant Henry VI when he was crowned King of France, the angel
  presenting the heavenly flowers to St. Remy and Clotilda is the subject of
  one of the illustrations. Edward III introduced the <i>fleurs de lis,</i> in
  right of his mother, into the English arms; they were borne by all British
  Kings until George III discarded them by royal proclamation in 1801.</p>

  <p>The gorgeous intricacies of heraldry have always enriched and enlivened
  our British coronation, and though many of us do not understand the exact
  meaning of all these symbols&mdash;many of which are obscure even to the
  learned in such matters&mdash;they have their own obvious fitness and beauty
  as reminders of the long pageantry of British Kings, British chivalry and
  world-wide traditions associated with human achievement and human
  aspiration.</p>

  <p>The scarlet that was the royal colour of England added greatly to the
  splendour of the English coronations; this hue was believed to be a variant
  of the famous Tyrian Imperial purple which was taken from the colour of the
  border of the robe of a Roman Senator and used by the Byzantine Emperors of
  whom it was said that they were "born in the purple."</p>

  <p>England was the only nation to preserve this magnificent hue; the
  households of the Bourbon Kings, the Portuguese, Prussian, Swedish and
  Netherlands sovereigns and most of the German Princes wore blue; those of
  Austria (the Empire) wore black and yellow, Russia, dark green. Some think
  this English scarlet colour was taken from the <i>gules</i> of the Royal
  Standard or from the Red Rose of the Plantagenets. Henry VIII used it for the
  uniform of the Yeomen of the Guard.</p>

  <p>This scarlet was always associated with royalty and very costly owing to
  the dye&mdash;taken from the insect, <i>coccus ilicis,</i> that had to be
  brought from South Europe. It was a pure vermilion, with no tincture of
  purple. Though other shades of red were used by all classes, only royalty or
  their servants were allowed to use the true scarlet.</p>

  <p>A profusion of this regal hue in liveries, hangings, tablecloths, carpets
  and in the royal arms and standards, repeated as often as possible, gave a
  truly brilliant air to the medieval coronations.</p>

  <p>There is a complete wardrobe account of the year 1433 of the coronation of
  Richard III, which describes the robes worn by the whole Court, pages,
  attendants, ladies, peers and peeresses. This shows in detail the fashions of
  this ceremony, wool and silks were both used, and we read of weaving,
  fringe-making, damasking, elaborate cutting and dyeing and many other species
  of work which proves that these arts and crafts were in a very high state of
  finish.</p>

  <p>The King's cousin and six other Lords and Knights had, by the King's high
  command and as his special gifts, delivered to them cloths of gold and silver
  velvet, peculiarly superb. Among the items listed by Piers Courtes, the
  King's wardrobes, on this occasion, is that of "divers stuff" delivered for
  the use of "Lord Edward, son of the late King Edward IV," and his "henchmen,"
  that proves, some think, that the unhappy "Princes in the Tower" were present
  at the crowning of their uncle&mdash;a rare instance of the rightful King
  being present at the coronation of a usurper, as Richard was in the eyes of
  most people. On the other hand, it may be that the rich robes were ordered
  for the proposed crowning of the boy himself that never took place. To the
  religious aspect of the ceremony there gradually came to be joined the
  political or feudal; in this country the King, to whose election the people
  had assented, obtained, publicly, renewal of the oaths of allegiance due to
  him from his fiefs of whom he was overlord; the King was bound to protect his
  people in return for their services, and, as our Constitution has not been
  altered on these points since feudal times, these observances continue,
  though now they have only a symbolic meaning.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a> II. &mdash; THE CORONATION OF KING GEORGE VI WITH<br>
  A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE BRITISH CEREMONIAL<br>
  FOR THE CROWNING OF THE KING AND QUEEN,<br>
  THE REGALIA, THE ROYAL ROBES, HERALDRY AND<br>
  OTHER ADJUNCTS OF THE CORONATION</h2>

  <p class="first">A TREATISE on the British coronation ceremony could be made
  to fill a stout volume; here, only a few of the notable features can be
  shortly described.</p>

  <p>The ceremony has changed only in detail; the setting, with few exceptions,
  from the crowning of William I, has been Westminster Abbey, though the church
  has been rebuilt and altered.</p>

  <p>Froissart described the crowning of Henry IV and it differed very little
  from that of George V. Even the Reformation had little effect upon this
  magnificent ceremonial with its double sacred and worldly significance and
  its pretext for all manner of rejoicing.</p>

  <p>The procession will, according to precedence, be headed by the
  clergy&mdash;the Chaplains in ordinary, the Domestic Chaplains, the Dean and
  Prebendary of Westminster, followed by Officers of Arms and Officers of the
  various orders of Knighthood. The Comptroller and Treasurer of the Royal
  Household are followed by the Standard Bearers, and then, after several other
  officers, the two Archbishops; after these, representing the Church, come the
  nobles and gentlemen bearing the Regalia, St. Edward's Staff, the Sceptre
  with the Cross, then the Golden Spurs, then the Sword of Mercy, then that of
  Spiritual and that of Temporal justice.</p>

  <p>The Kings-of-Arms walk immediately behind the Regalia, and behind them
  come the Lord Mayor of London, Garter Principal King-of-Arms, and the
  Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.</p>

  <p>The Lord Great Chamberlain of England walks alone, other Officers of State
  follow, the Earl Marshal and the Lord High Constable escort the Sword of
  State that is followed by the Dove, St. Edward's crown, the Orb, borne by
  three noblemen, and the Paten, Bible and Chalice, borne by three Bishops.</p>

  <p>This procession meets that of the King, who advances in his crimson robe
  of state, with eight gentlemen bearing his train, supported by the Bishops of
  Durham and Bath and Wells, and attended by Gentlemen-at-Arms and officers of
  his household. The crowning and sacring of the King will then follow; the
  ritual being based on those of Archbishop Egbert and the <i>Liber
  Regalis;</i> the crown, by tradition that of the Confessor, will rest on the
  altar in front of the shrine where the relics of the royal saint lie.</p>

  <p>King George is forty-first in succession from Egbert (<i>d.</i> A.D. 839)
  and representative of the oldest reigning family in Europe; no other country
  can now show such a continuity of a royal line and a national loyalty to an
  ideal of Kingship formulated over a thousand years ago and still deeply
  respected and firmly upheld. Queen Elizabeth is of equally ancient family,
  she is descended direct from Robert II of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The background will be the tapestry-hung walls and arches of the splendid
  Gothic Church of Westminster Abbey, and the lighting, most carefully planned,
  will mingle with the glow of a May day streaming through the coloured glass
  of the beautiful windows; the congregation will consist of the peers and of
  representatives of the activities and achievements of the Empire, notable
  among whom will be the Indian Princes. The colouring of this superb pageant
  will be in heraldic reds and blues, mostly primary colours relieved by gold,
  silver and furs and the flash of jewels. The presence of the Queen Consort
  and the peeresses adds greatly to the splendour of the spectacle; the
  crowning of Queen Elizabeth will follow precedent. The crown in the British
  Regalia for the royal consort is that made for Mary II, but subsequent queens
  have had especial crowns designed and made for them; that fashioned for Queen
  Mary, consort of George V, is considered a model of beauty and elegance. It
  is probable that Queen Elizabeth will wear a crown composed entirely of
  diamonds; the consort wears only one crown, the King is crowned with the
  diadem of Edward the Confessor and afterwards wears the Imperial Crown.</p>

  <p>The British Regalia also contain the Queen's sceptre with the Cross, and
  the Queen's ivory rod made for Maria d'Este, wife of James II. Another
  sceptre, with Dove and Cross, is believed to have been made for Mary II. Her
  Majesty will wear splendid robes of British material and workmanship. The
  Queen consort has always been regarded as second in dignity only to the King
  himself, and she enjoys many rights and privileges.</p>

  <p>The earliest account we have of the crowning of a Queen consort in this
  country is that of the ceremony whereby Judith, daughter of Charles of
  France, wife of Ethelwulf of Wessex, was crowned with great pomp, 856.</p>

  <p>Before the conquest the queens consort were not only anointed and crowned,
  but sat beside their husbands on chairs of state.</p>

  <p>Matilda, wife of the Conqueror, was crowned at Winchester, her husband
  being recrowned at the same time, April, 1068.</p>

  <p>The queens consort used to come from the Tower in litters of cloth of gold
  drawn by white palfreys escorted by knights and followed by rich chariots in
  which rode the ladies of the Court.</p>

  <p>The coronation of Eleanor, the beautiful young wife of Henry III (1236),
  and that of another French Princess, Katherine, wife of Henry V (1421), were
  occasions of great magnificence.</p>

  <p>Shakespeare gives a realistic description of the coronation of a queen
  consort in his relation of the installation of Anne Boleyn (1533), these
  ceremonies are but little different from those that will be used at the
  sacring of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

  <p class="poem">At length her grace rose, and with modest graces<br>
  Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and, saint-like,<br>
  Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray'd devoutly:<br>
  Then rose again and bow'd her to the people;<br>
  When by the Archbishop of Canterbury,<br>
  She had all the royal makings of a Queen,<br>
  As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,<br>
  The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems,<br>
  Laid nobly on her; which perform'd, the choir,<br>
  With all the choicest music of the Kingdom<br>
  Together sang <i>Te Deum.</i></p>

  <p>If the history and meaning of all the details that go to make this moving
  and impressive rite and gorgeous formality of the crowning of the King and
  Queen are understood, what we may see or hear of the coronation becomes more
  interesting and lingers in the mind as well as gratifies the eye and ear.</p>

  <p>The correct title of the King Emperor is: George VI, By the Grace of God,
  King of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the Dominions Overseas, Emperor of
  India, Defender of the Faith.</p>

  <p>English royalty claimed an Imperial character from early times; Edward
  III, in particular, asserted his Imperial rights, so did Henry VIII, the
  crown of England was, of set purpose, termed "the Imperial Crown." The Queens
  regnant, Elizabeth and Anne, were sometimes referred to as "Empresses." The
  title, "Defender of the Faith," was given to Henry VIII by Leo X and has been
  retained by every subsequent British sovereign.</p>

  <p>His Majesty is also Chief of the great orders of knighthood, of which the
  most important is the Most Noble Order of the Garter, instituted by Edward
  III in 1350. The Most Noble and Ancient Order of the Thistle of Scotland, of
  early origin, was revived by James V of Scotland in 1540. The Most
  Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick is of much more recent date, 1783. The
  Most Honourable Order of the Bath is ancient and was refounded by George I in
  1725. The most distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George was founded
  1818, that of the most exalted Order of the Star of India in 1801. The garter
  itself&mdash;a blue buckled ribbon fastened beneath the left knee&mdash;is
  shown encircling the Royal Arms inscribed with the motto&mdash;<i>Honi soit
  qui mal y pense</i> ("Evil be where evil is thought"). "By the Grace of God"
  means&mdash;that the King has no overlord, but receives his title from
  Heaven. Henry III first used&mdash;<i>Dei: Gratia: Anglie: Rex.</i></p>

  <h3>ROYAL HERALDRY</h3>

  <p class="first">This is a most elaborate subject and full of difficulties,
  even heralds themselves having differences of opinion as to the meaning and
  origin of various charges, badges and devices, most of which go back beyond
  written records. The three English <i>lions passant gardant, in pale, or,</i>
  are by some authorities supposed to have been leopards; these royal beasts
  are very ancient and were used by the Plantagenets; they appear on the great
  seals of these Kings; the <i>fleur de lis</i> was placed on the shield by
  Edward III, and this coat, known as England ancient, was borne by all
  sovereigns till Elizabeth; the French Lilies appear in the first and fourth
  quarters, the English lions in the second and third; the shield is extremely
  elegant and beautiful, an exquisite specimen of the art of heraldry.
  Elizabeth sometimes added Ireland, a <i>harp or stringed azure,</i> and James
  I and VI, first King of Great Britain (though Elizabeth had occasionally used
  the title in anticipation) incorporated the Scottish Lion, a magnificent
  charge&mdash;a <i>lion rampant gules</i> with the superb <i>tressure fleury
  double fleury;</i> in this rearrangement, the heralds placed France and
  England (the original shield) first and fourth grand quarter, Scotland second
  grand quarter and Ireland third grand quarter. William III, as an elected
  sovereign, placed in pretence his paternal arms of Nassau, <i>azure billetée,
  a lion rampant or;</i> a beautiful example of this rare shield is to be seen
  in the stone surmounts of the entrance to Kensington Palace. After the Union,
  1707, England, impaling Scotland, occupied first and fourth quarters, France
  second and Ireland third. George I placed the Arms of Hanover in the fourth
  quarter instead of the repeat, Scotland and England.</p>

  <p>George III omitted the lilies; and on the accession of Victoria, Hanover
  became a separate Kingdom, and the royal shield of Great Britain returned to
  the Insignia of the United Kingdom that it still bears; this is a simple and
  yet magnificent coat-of-arms, more effective now than when it bore the
  complicated charges of Hanover.</p>

  <p>The supporters of the British Shield have frequently changed; some
  examples are: Edward III, a lion and a falcon; Richard II, two white harts;
  Henry IV, a lion and a swan; Henry V, a lion and an antelope.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had a lion and a dragon; James I brought in the Scottish
  Unicorn, and since his time the supporters have been on the <i>dexter</i>
  (right) <i>a lion rampant gardant or imperially crowned proper,</i> and
  <i>sinister</i> (left) <i>a unicorn argent, armed enguled</i> and <i>crined
  or, gorged</i> with a coronet composed of <i>crosses pattées</i> and <i>fleur
  de lis</i> gold.</p>

  <p>There has been much variation also in the royal mottoes, Richard I
  <i>Christo duce</i> (Christ lead me); <i>Rosa sine spina</i> (rose without a
  thorn) Elizabeth; <i>Beati pacifici</i> (blessed are the peacemakers) James
  I. The present royal motto is an ancient war cry&mdash;first assumed by Henry
  <i>VI&mdash;Dieu et mon Droit</i> (God and my right.)</p>

  <p>The <i>Helm</i> of the Sovereign that appears above the shield is
  <i>affronté or</i> (full face in gold) with six bars; only princes of the
  Blood royal are allowed this form of helmet.</p>

  <p>The royal English badges were very numerous; Henry II introduced the
  branch of broom, <i>planta genesta,</i> from which his house took its name
  <i>Plantagenet.</i></p>

  <p>Richard I used a star rising above a crescent in reference to the crusade.
  Edward I had a golden rose. Richard II, among many others, an ostrich feather
  and a sun in splendour. Edward IV, a black bull; Henry VII introduced the
  famous Tudor badges, a portcullis, the double rose of York and Lancaster, and
  the red dragon for Wales. From the reign of James I the English rose and the
  Scotch thistle were used as badges of the United Kingdom; the shamrock for
  Ireland was added later, and these are now permanently in the royal
  achievement, though the sovereign has long ceased to use a personal
  badge.</p>

  <h3>THE REGALIA</h3>

  <p class="first">The English Regalia used to be kept in the Chapel of the
  Pyx, or the King's Treasure House, in Westminster Abbey, and in times of
  danger were sent to the safer custody of the Tower of London; they formed the
  nucleus of a considerable treasure, gold plate for the royal banquets, costly
  armour and robes and ornaments of precious stones; the early Kings often
  carried these valuables about with them; hence the story (now doubted) that
  King John lost the Regalia with his baggage in the Wash between Lincolnshire
  and Norfolk in 1216.</p>

  <p>Edward III is said to have frequently pledged the Regalia with Flemish
  bankers in order to raise money for the French wars; these jewels were also
  pawned by Richard II and Henry V&mdash;the latter monarch also lost much of
  the Regalia at Agincourt, which misfortune was the cause of a lawsuit with
  the Frenchman who found some of the jewels.</p>

  <p>In the reign of Richard II the abbots and monks of Westminster had charge
  of the Regalia; the rule was that every sovereign should be buried in full
  splendour, but this proved too costly and the Kings and Queens were usually
  interred in cheap robes and counterfeit jewels; it is said that the crown
  worn in the grave by Henry II (1189) was a piece of fringe cut from a lady's
  petticoat.</p>

  <p>After the reign of Henry VIII the Regalia were moved to the King's
  treasury in the Tower; many articles more curious than valuable were then
  included among the royal insignia&mdash;the sceptre of Moses, the sword with
  which Athelstan cut a rock at Dunbar, the "holy cross," the dagger that
  wounded Edward I at Acre, and the war gauntlet worn by King John of France
  when he was taken prisoner at Poitiers. At the accession of Charles I, the
  royal treasury was magnificently furnished, but the King sold many of these
  heirlooms in the Netherlands in 1625. What was left of the royal treasure was
  seized by the Commonwealth Government, melted down and sold. In the inventory
  made in 1649, the total value of the Regalia, including the royal robes, is
  given as £612 19s. 8d. for the articles found in the Abbey and for those
  taken from the Tower, under £2000; so it would seem as if Charles I had left
  little of any great value behind. The items on this list are very curious;
  the first is:</p>

  <p><i>The Imperial Crown of massy gold</i>&mdash;£1,110; the last: <i>An old
  comb of horn worth nothing.</i></p>

  <p>A crown of filigree work with bells, supposed to have belonged to Alfred,
  was in this list. If this crown was really that of Alfred it must have also
  been that used by St. Edward.</p>

  <p>At the Restoration a committee was formed to order new Regalia; these were
  made by the royal goldsmith&mdash;Sir Henry Viner&mdash;and cost nearly
  £32,000. They were kept in the Tower and exposed to public view; and soon
  after, Col. Blood and Parrot made their notorious and unsuccessful attempt to
  steal the Regalia.</p>

  <p>A fire in the Round Tower in 1841 put the Regalia in peril, and the
  precious jewels were removed to a new treasure house especially built. These
  Regalia consist of St. Edward's Crown, the Imperial Crown, the Prince of
  Wales' Coronet, the Queen Consort's Crown and the Queen's Diadem, St.
  Edward's Staff, the Sceptre with the Cross, the Sceptre with the Dove, the
  Queen's Sceptre, the Ivory Sceptre, the Sceptre of Mary II, the Swords, the
  Bracelets and Spurs, the Ampulla and Spoon, with a salt-cellar, font and
  service of sacramental plate for use at coronations.</p>

  <p>The following is a description of the articles that will be used for the
  coronation of George VI.</p>

  <h3>THE CROWNS</h3>

  <p class="first">The most precious object in the ancient Regalia was the
  crown which was believed to have been worn by Edward the Confessor; since
  this was destroyed by the Republicans, another, "to be called St. Edward's
  crown," was made by order of Charles II; this was found to have been
  despoiled of jewels on the accession of William and Mary and was then richly
  reset with gems. This crown is symbolic of the sovereign's claim to the
  throne by descent from St. Edward and of the link between the ancient royal
  line of England and the present British Empire.</p>

  <p>The Imperial crowns of England were varied, splendid and numerous, the
  earlier ones being exquisite works of art; perhaps the most superb example is
  that worn by Henry IV in his effigy at Canterbury Cathedral, a rich, elegant
  design of strawberry (or vine?) <i>leaves, fleurs de lis</i> and pearls; it
  is thought that this was the celebrated "Harry" crown, broken up and sold by
  Henry V. The crown of Edward VI was valued at nearly £400; Queen Mary I used
  three especially made crowns, Elizabeth had two; in one of the <i>fleur de
  lis</i> on the crown of Charles I was an engraving of the Virgin Mary. In a
  portrait of Charles I in the Museum, New York, is a representation of a
  closed crown very similar to that worn by George V, also the orb and
  sceptre.</p>

    <p class="caption">(a) The Imperial Crown. (b) St Edward's Crown.<br>
    (c) The Golden Spurs and Ring. (d)The Ampulla and Spoon.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The two Imperial crowns made for Charles II were very rich and costly;
  they were several times altered for his successors. An entirely new crown was
  made for George IV in which were set a ruby, said to have belonged to the
  Black Prince, and a sapphire that was unique for size and colour. This crown,
  valued at £150,000, was the work of Messrs. Rundell and Bridge; it was too
  heavy for the King to wear long, and a light crown, broken up soon after, was
  worn by His Majesty during the State banquet. The same jewellers made Queen
  Victoria's crown; it has, with alterations, been used by her successors; it
  is an Imperial crown, arched, surmounted by a cross and set over a cap of
  velvet with an ermine border; the open crown was the sign of an elected
  monarch. The Imperial crown of India was made for George V.</p>

  <h3>THE SCEPTRE WITH THE CROSS</h3>

  <p class="first">This is placed in the sovereign's right hand; it is of gold
  wreathed with jewels in the design of the rose, the shamrock and the thistle.
  At the top is an amethyst in the form of a globe encircled with diamonds and
  surmounted by a cross <i>pattée</i> of jewels.</p>

  <h3>THE SCEPTRE WITH THE DOVE</h3>

  <p class="first">This is of gold with a fillet of diamonds on the shaft, a
  mound (globe) on top with a cross and Dove (for the Holy Ghost) enamelled
  white.</p>

  <h3>ST. EDWARD'S STAFF</h3>

  <p class="first">This, borne in front of the monarch, is of gold, with a
  steel foot, and a globe and cross at the top.</p>

  <h3>THE AMPULLA</h3>

  <p class="first">The vessel that holds the anointing oil; it is of gold in
  shape of an eagle. The head screws off, the oil goes into the neck, then is
  poured into the spoon through the beak. This ampulla is very ancient and is
  thought to be with the spoon the part of the original Regalia that escaped
  the attention of the Commonwealth.</p>

  <h3>THE SPOON</h3>

  <p class="first">This is also believed to be the original spoon; it is at
  least very old; of silver gilt with pearls and worn thin with age.</p>

  <h3>THE ORB, WORLD OR GLOBE</h3>

  <p class="first">This is placed first in the sovereign's right hand; then,
  when he takes the sceptre, it is placed in his left hand. It is a golden ball
  with a fillet of precious stones; surmounted by a cross on a jewelled foot.
  This mound ("monde" world) was copied by the Saxon Kings from the orb of the
  Emperors of Rome or the Emperors of the East. The symbolism is Temporal
  Power.</p>

  <h3>THE SWORDS</h3>

  <p class="first"><i>Curtana</i> (from <i>curtus</i>, Lat.
  <i>short</i>&mdash;cut short) is the blunt sword of Mercy; the original
  <i>Curtana</i> belonged to St. Edward the Confessor. <i>The Sword of
  State</i> is two-handed and has the royal badges on the scabbard; with this
  sword the sovereign is girt. <i>The Sword of Justice to the Spirituality</i>
  is slightly obtuse at the point.</p>

  <p><i>The Sword of Justice to the Temporality</i> is sharp pointed. All these
  swords are sumptuously embellished with gems and have rich scabbards.</p>

  <h3>THE BRACELETS</h3>

  <p class="first">These are of gold, edged with pearls and hinged to clasp on
  the arms; these <i>armillae</i> are a very ancient symbol of royalty; they
  are mentioned in the Bible.</p>

  <h3>THE GREAT GOLDEN SPURS</h3>

  <p class="first">An emblem of knighthood; they are "prick spurs" without
  rowels, of gold, with fine straps added by George IV; the spurs themselves
  were made for Charles II.</p>

  <h3>THE RING</h3>

  <p class="first">"The wedding ring of England," emblematic of the union of
  King and country, originally plain gold, set with a large ruby; the legend is
  that this ring was given as alms to two pilgrims by St. Edward; afterwards,
  when they were in the Holy Land, the palmers met St. John the Evangelist who
  bade them take the ring back to the Confessor; this they did, and it was kept
  at his shrine ever afterwards.</p>

  <p>Another story is that this ring was sent by Mary, Queen of Scots, before
  her execution, to her son James (who became James VI of Scotland and James I
  of England). It was afterwards given on the scaffold by Charles I to Bishop
  Juxon for Charles II. It was among the relics of the last of the royal
  Stewarts, Cardinal York, and eventually bought by George IV. The present ring
  is formed of rubies, a sapphire and diamonds.</p>

  <p>The magnificent Regalia of Scotland are kept in Edinburgh Castle; they
  were last used when Charles II was crowned at Scone, January 1st, 1661.</p>

  <h3>THE CORONATION ROBES OR VESTMENTS</h3>

  <p class="first">The British coronation robes, like those of all Western
  monarchs, follow the design of those worn by the Emperors of the Holy Roman
  Empire. They resemble the Imperial royal robes of Byzantium, the Eastern
  Empire. Charlemagne was crowned by Leo II in Rome, A.D. 799, and the robes
  that he is supposed to have worn on this occasion were the models for all
  subsequent Imperial vestments. Charlemagne, however, never wore the gorgeous
  Imperial garments with which he is depicted in so many pictures and statues.
  He wore but a simple mantle and tunic. When his tomb in Aix-la-Chapelle was
  opened in 1165, Charlemagne was found, the story goes, seated on a throne,
  wearing the Imperial robes, with the Bible on his knee; and the details of
  his attire were carefully noted and copied.</p>

  <p>The royal robes of England were varied in colour and detail by different
  sovereigns and according to the fashions of various periods, but the main
  garments have remained traditional, these are:</p>

  <p><i>The Dalmatica,</i> a knee-length undergarment with long sleeves,
  usually violet coloured and embroidered with gems. The name is from Dalmatia,
  where this garment was supposed to have originated.</p>

  <p><i>The Alba,</i> named from its white colour; a silk surplice with pointed
  sleeves, worn over the Dalmatica and tied with gold cords at the neck.</p>

  <p>The <i>Stola,</i> a strip of violet silk studded with gems, with tasselled
  ends, worn round the neck and crossed over the breast. No special
  meaning&mdash;from a Greek word&mdash;to equip.</p>

  <p>The <i>Pallium</i> or mantle. Cut like a cape, the half of a circle of
  velvet lined with silk or fur, with a clasp at the neck and jewel braidings.
  The ancient imperial way of wearing this garment, that reached to the feet,
  was with one straight edge on the left shoulder, then placed round the neck
  and pinned on the right shoulder. The imperial vestments included gloves
  knitted in purple silk with precious stones, stockings of red silk, purple
  shoes or sandals, and two elaborate girdles of silk and gold. The Saxon Kings
  used purple colour for their coronation robes; that of Henry III was of "the
  best purple samite, embroidered with three little leopards in front and three
  behind." When the tomb of Edward I in Westminster Abbey was opened in 1774,
  the King was found wearing his royal robes of traditional form, dalmatic,
  tunic and stole; these were of red silk damask.</p>

  <p>The tunic is the shirt; <i>tunica</i> means undergarment.</p>

  <p>The picture of the child King Richard II in the <i>Liber Regalis</i> shows
  his robe as gold with pink and blue flowers; in the contemporary account of
  the crowning of Henry VII, minever fur and ermine are mentioned as lining the
  purple velvet robes of State. <i>Minever</i> is little <i>vair,</i> from old
  French <i>vairé,</i> mingled azure and silver, an heraldic term meaning
  <i>varied;</i> the reference is probably to the bloom on sable; but there
  seems no certainty as to what kind of fur is meant by <i>vair</i> or minever,
  and it may have been ermine <i>and</i> sable; ermine is now generally used in
  place of minever.</p>

  <p>Mary and Elizabeth wore crimson and purple mantles with ermine and
  minever. A completely new set of regal vestments was made for Charles II;
  those sold by the Commonwealth were valued at £4 1Os. 6d.; it seems probable
  that the more valuable portion of the royal wardrobe had been sold by Charles
  I.</p>

  </div><br>

  <h3>THE CORONATION CHAIR</h3>

  <p class="first">This was made to the order of Edward I, to accommodate the
  "holy stone" beneath the seat; the stone was an offering from the King at the
  shrine of Edward the Confessor; the chair is of wood and cost, with the lions
  and step, about eight pounds; on the occasion of coronations it is covered
  with brocade or damask; the present lions are modern. The famous Stone of
  Scone, the "stone of destiny," the focus of so many legends is of red
  sandstone, probably from a Dundee quarry.</p>

  <p>All the sovereigns of Great Britain since Edward I have been consecrated
  on this chair, save Mary I, who had, according to tradition, a chair
  especially blessed sent from Rome.</p>

  <h3>THE PROCESSION</h3>

  <p class="first">This used to be a very popular feature of the coronation
  festivities; it proceeded from the Tower, the royal residence, to the Abbey,
  then back again. It was discontinued by James II and never revived; but
  George IV robed in Westminster Hall and there was a short procession to the
  Abbey.</p>

  <p>The earlier processions, notably that of Richard II, were costly and
  elaborate pageants; the streets being sumptuously decorated and crowded with
  spectators. From early times it has been customary to erect stands along the
  royal route and to charge for seats thereon; the prices varied from about one
  farthing for Edward I to thirty shillings for Queen Victoria.</p>

  <h3>THE BANQUET</h3>

  <p class="first">This usually took place in Westminster Hall and was a very
  magnificent affair; the sheriffs of the different counties used to contribute
  meat and fowls to the feast. The entry of the Champion was the great feature
  of the banquet, the fare was costly and varied, served on gold plate. For the
  banquet of Henry VI, the ingenious cook prepared a red soup with white lions
  in it, a gold leopard in a custard, chickens "powdered with gilt lozenges,"
  "fritters like the sun," and a haunch of venison inscribed <i>Te Deum
  Laudamus.</i></p>

  <p>When the Court had retired, the people were allowed in to "scramble" for
  the remnants of the food; after the banquet of George IV, the crowd broke in
  too soon, and "scrambled away" the gold plate that the lackeys had not had
  time to remove; some of this was not recovered in the unseemly fight that
  followed. This was the last of the public banquets.</p>

  <h3>THE COURT OF CLAIMS</h3>

  <p class="first">The coronation of Richard II is the first occasion on which
  there is a detailed record of the Court of Claims that sits to decide the
  merits of the claims to perform some service at the coronation, in return for
  honours or rewards.</p>

  <h3>THE COLLEGE OF ARMS</h3>

  <p class="first">This consists of three Kings-of-Arms&mdash;Garter,
  Clarencieux and Norroy; of six Heralds&mdash;Windsor, Chester, Lancaster,
  Somerset, York and Richmond; and four Pursuivants&mdash;Rouge Croix, Rouge
  Dragon, Blue Mantle and Portcullis.</p>

  <p>The head of the College of Arms is the Earl Marshal of England. This
  office is hereditary in the family of the Duke of Norfolk; part of the duties
  of the College of Arms is the direction of royal ceremonials and pageants, so
  that the arrangements for the coronation come directly under the jurisdiction
  of the Earl Marshal. The gorgeous attire of the Kings-of-Arms is a notable
  feature of the coronation; they have crowns of gold oak-leaves set upright
  over caps of crimson satin, a tabard of the royal arms embroidered on velvet
  and collars of S.S. with two portcullises of silver gilt as badges of office.
  Garter Principal King-of-Arms, who is the Chief, has a crimson satin mantle
  and a white rod of office; he serves especially the Most Noble Order of the
  Garter.</p>

  <p>The other Kings-of-Arms are allotted to different parts of England:
  Clarencieux (named after the Duke of Clarence) to the south of the Trent, and
  Norroy (North Roy&mdash;North King) to the north of the Trent.</p>

  <p>For Scotland there is Lyon King-of-Arms; for Ireland, Ulster King-of-Arms;
  for Wales, Bath King-of-Arms.</p>

  <p>The College of Arms received their Charter from Richard III.</p>

  <p>The formal solemnity of a coronation is the occasion above all others when
  the impressive and symbolic pomp of ancient heraldry is seen to greatest
  advantage; and immense labour occupying months of careful work devolves on
  the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms in the preparation of this gorgeous
  pageant, which must be perfect in every detail and worthy of the gathering
  together of a commonwealth of nations.</p>

  <h3>THE CORONETS OF PEERS</h3>

  <p class="first">For a Duke, eight gold strawberry leaves.</p>

  <p>A Marquess, four gold strawberry leaves, four balls alternately.</p>

  <p>An Earl, eight silver balls, raised on points, gold strawberry leaves
  between the points.</p>

  <p>A Viscount, sixteen silver balls.</p>

  <p>A Baron, six silver balls.</p>

  <p>They are worn round crimson velvet caps turned up with ermine.</p>

  <h3>THE ROBES OF PEERS</h3>

  <p class="first">The robes are of crimson velvet; the mantle has a cape,
  lined minever and "powdered" with ermine; four rows for a Duke, three and a
  half rows for a Marquess, three rows for an Earl, two and a half rows for a
  Viscount, two rows for a Baron.</p>

  <h3>THE OATH</h3>

  <p class="first">The Oath is an integral part of the coronation ceremony; the
  Anglo-Saxons regarded it as a compact between King and people, and it still
  retains that meaning.</p>

  <p>St. Dunstan administered an oath to Ethelred at Kingston in 978.</p>

  <p>The present coronation oath dates from the accession of William and Mary,
  1689, and has been but little altered since; it is too long to be quoted
  here; the sum of it is the sovereign's undertaking to maintain the laws and
  "the Protestant Reformed Religion." The oath is written on vellum, attached
  to a roll on which are described particulars of the coronation ceremony and
  deposited among the Records in the Court of Chancery. This collection of
  rolls, with the exception of those of Charles I and George III, is complete
  from James I.</p>

  <h3>THE ANOINTING</h3>

  <p class="first">The coronation robes are arranged for convenience during the
  anointing. When this is done the Chrism&mdash;oil mixed with balm&mdash;is
  consecrated by a bishop. It is then poured from the ampulla into the spoon,
  then placed on the sovereign's head, breast and arms. Since the oil was
  supposed to be of divine origin this was considered the most important part
  of the ceremony; "the Lord's anointed" was the most sacred title that could
  be given the King. The Chrism gave the gift of healing and touched the
  kingship with divinity.</p>

  <p>The English anointing ceremonial follows those of ancient times; all
  sovereigns were anointed; the pouring of "a vial of oil" on the King's head
  is mentioned in the Bible, and the Hebrews are thought to have derived the
  custom from Egypt.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a> III. &mdash; SOME REMARKABLE INCIDENTS<br>
  CONNECTED WITH CORONATIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">MANY of the British coronations are associated with
  extraordinary or romantic incidents quite apart from the intrinsic splendour
  of the pageantry and the momentous solemnity of the ceremonial; the following
  are a few of the most dramatic and interesting.</p>

  <p>When St. Dunstan crowned Ethelred II, he said: "If you have obtained the
  Kingdom through the death of your brother the sword shall not depart from
  your House till it has cut it off, and the Crown shall pass to one of another
  race and language."</p>

  <p>Ethelred had obtained the crown by the murder of his brother Edward, and
  the prophecy was, like most old prophecies, fulfilled&mdash;in the
  establishment first of the Danish and then of the Norman Kings. Edward the
  Confessor was crowned at Winchester, Harold, crowned 1066 in St. Paul's, it
  is supposed, was slain October 14th of the same year.</p>

  <p>The Archbishops were preparing for the coronation of Edgar the Atheling
  when they heard that William the Norman was advancing on London, and
  believing the cause of the English to be hopeless they made their submission
  to the Conqueror, whom, with deputies from London, they hastened to meet.</p>

  <p>The Conqueror chose Christmas Day for his crowning; there were sounds of
  popular discontent from without the newly built church of St. Peter or Abbey
  of Westminster; the Norman soldiery seized the opportunity to lay wait to
  plunder the neighbouring houses, and the King himself rushed out with his
  drawn sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>The most hurried of coronations was that of Henry I, who rode post haste
  to London after finding his brother William Rufus murdered in the New Forest
  in order to outdo Robert, the rightful heir, then in Normandy. This bold move
  was successful; the elder brother was never able to make headway against the
  anointed King.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>A splendid coronation that took place in dramatic circumstances was that
  of Matilda, the daughter of Henry I, in Winchester Cathedral in 1141, after
  her rival, Stephen, had been made prisoner, and in the midst of civil war.
  Matilda was <i>de jure,</i> at least, an Empress as well as Queen of England.
  <i>Lady of England and Normandy</i> the Council at Winchester termed her, and
  she had been crowned at Mainz with her husband Henry V; this Matilda was the
  third of her name&mdash;spelt also Maud, Mold, Asliz and Aethelic&mdash;to be
  Queen of England.</p>

  <p>The gentle Consort of the Conqueror was crowned with him at Westminster
  (he had been already crowned, but chose to share his elevation), and so was
  the first wife of Henry I, that Scottish Princess, grand-daughter of Edmund
  Ironside, who brought the ancient royal British blood to mingle with that of
  the Normans. Some historians think that the first crowning of a queen consort
  <i>with</i> her husband was that of Eleanor, wife of Henry I, 1134. Henry II
  had his son, Prince Henry, twice crowned as King; first at Westminster, 1170,
  then at Winchester, 1172, during his own lifetime in order to secure the
  succession.</p>

  <p>Henry II, we are told, was consecrated "several times," though by its
  nature this sacring can only take place once; he appeared at his crowning in
  the Angevin mantle that gave him the name of "short mantle."</p>

  <p>Richard I was crowned at Westminster, 1189, and again at Winchester on his
  return from captivity, in order to efface the stain of imprisonment.</p>

  <p>The unfortunate John was crowned on Ascension Day, 1199, and refused to
  communicate&mdash;an ill omen amply fulfilled. He was not the rightful heir
  and seems to have considered himself an elected sovereign. His son Henry III,
  after a hasty crowning at Gloucester, 1216, was enthroned again in
  Westminster, 1220.</p>

  <p>A year elapsed between the accession of Edward I and his coronation; at
  the time of his father's death he was in the Holy Land on a Crusade. This
  Edward was termed "the first King of the English," as not since the Conquest
  had the sovereign authority of the King been recognised throughout the realm.
  This gorgeous ceremonial, of which there are detailed records, was carried
  out with extraordinary pomp on 19th August, 1274. The young King was a
  magnificent soldier, a fine statesman, an attractive personality and
  extremely popular; he was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury together
  with his Queen, Eleanor, a good and beautiful woman. There was a glittering
  gathering of all the great men of the realm, including the King's two
  brothers-in-law, Alexander, King of Scotland, and John, Duke of Brittany.</p>

  <p>The festivities continued for a fortnight and the feast was of a
  magnificence that was spoken of for years afterwards; some of the provisions
  ordered included 380 head of cattle, 430 sheep, 450 pigs, 18 wild boars, 279
  flitches of bacon and nearly 20,000 fowls. Temporary wooden buildings were
  erected round the fields of Westminster for the accommodation of the guests;
  the narrow, crooked, winding streets of London were hung with tapestries that
  dangled from balconies and windows. Conduits flowed with wine; those who
  could afford to do so threw handfuls of silver to the common people.</p>

  <p>A touch of magnificence that was much admired was that, when the King was
  seated on his throne, King Alexander of Scotland came to do him homage with a
  hundred mounted knights&mdash;"and when they had alighted off their horses,
  they let the horses go whither they would; they that could catch them had
  them for their own." Edmund, the King's brother, the Earl of Gloucester, the
  Earl of Pembroke and the Earl of Warrenne, each with a hundred knights in
  attendance, also let their horses go, and allowed the steeds to run loose for
  the spectators to catch.</p>

  <p>This was the beginning of King Edward's active and splendid reign.
  Diplomacy as well as a love of display was behind these opulent shows;
  nothing put the people in such a good humour as these parades and this
  bountiful largess. They were often allowed to enter the halls after the King
  and his peers had risen from the banquet and "scramble away" the remnants of
  the food. Moreover, it was wise, in the days before the invention of printing
  or when it was difficult to spread abroad "news," to let as many people as
  possible see an historic event.</p>

  <p>An example of this was the dramatic abdication of Richard II and the
  crowning of Henry IV, 1399. Henry Bolingbroke was led by the Archbishop of
  Canterbury to the throne then raised in Westminster Hall and covered with
  cloth of gold. Richard II stepped down from it after his resignation was read
  out, so that the representatives of the people could actually see the King
  leave the throne. Henry IV was crowned in Westminster Abbey shortly
  after.</p>

  <p>Henry V was twice crowned, as King of England 1413, and as King of France;
  his son was also crowned twice as a child, at Westminster and at Notre Dame,
  Paris.</p>

  <p>Edward IV, 1461, was anointed with traditional splendour; and the superb
  coronation of Richard III, of which a full account is extant, was remarkable
  for its extreme magnificence, and the King and Queen walked barefooted to the
  shrine of St. Edward.</p>

  <p>Henry VII was first crowned on the battlefield with the circlet found in
  the baggage of Richard III, or, according to tradition, taken from the boughs
  of a thorn bush, where it was supposed to be hanging. Richard would obviously
  not have worn the royal crown into battle, but some coronet from his helm may
  have been used. Henry Tudor was crowned by Cardinal Bourchier who had
  performed this service for two other kings, 1485.</p>

  <p>The coronation of Henry VIII was an extremely splendid affair and filled
  everyone with delirious joy and excitement after the long economies and drab
  dullness of his father's useful, but austere rule. Henry VIII's reign saw the
  crowning of two Queens&mdash;four of his wives were never crowned.</p>

  <p>Catherine of Aragon shared her husband's splendid coronation of "boundless
  expenditure," and that of Anne Boleyn was emotionally, sentimentally and
  politically so important that it attracted a great deal of attention.</p>

  <p>Anne Boleyn was not popular, first, because she was an upstart who had
  displaced a respected Queen, secondly, because she was believed to be a
  wanton woman who had been the King's mistress for several years; but the
  splendour of her crowning attracted unwilling admiration.</p>

  <p>Immense sums were spent on the glorification of this daughter of a country
  squire; the tissue hangings of the Abbey were of pure gold, and the Queen was
  drawn in a gold-hung litter wearing the crown jewels scattered in her dark
  locks&mdash;"sitting in her hair" a contemporary describes her. The
  fascinating Anne was not accounted beautiful, but she had magnificent black
  eyes and tresses. Three years after her crowning Anne perished by the sword
  of the French executioner especially sent to London to behead a Queen.</p>

  <h3>EDWARD VI</h3>

  <p class="first">At the coronation of Edward VI the service was shortened in
  consideration for a delicate child of ten years of age; Richard II, crowned
  at about the same age, fainted from fatigue; the Kings had to fast in
  preparation for Holy Communion. For the first time at the installation of
  Edward VI a Bible was presented to the Sovereign.</p>

  <h3>MARY I</h3>

  <p class="first">Mary I restored, with anxious care, all the details of the
  ancient ritual of the Roman Catholic Church. Queen Mary was crowned by
  Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, as Cranmer, the Archbishop, was a prisoner in
  the Tower. Magnificent shows and pageantry celebrated the elevation of this
  Queen whose reign was to be so short, sad and sombre both for herself and for
  her subjects; she was the first of the two Queens regnant who were crowned as
  unmarried women and the first woman crowned in her own right since
  Matilda.</p>

  <p>The City of London excelled itself in loyal demonstrations on this
  occasion, among which was the following curious display. A Dutchman named
  Peter stood on the weathercock of St. Paul's Cathedral holding a streamer
  five yards in length and waving it; he sometimes stood on one foot and shook
  the other, and then kneeled down. The spectators highly appreciated this
  extraordinary show. The Dutchman had two scaffolds beneath him, "one above
  the Cross having torches and streamers on it, and one on the ball of the
  Cross, likewise set with streamers and torches, which could not burn, the
  wind was so great." For this valiant and ingenious display the Dutchman
  received from the City of London £16 13s., given him, as Holinshed says: "for
  his care and pains and all his stuff."</p>

  <h3>QUEEN ELIZABETH</h3>

  <p class="first">The coronation of Queen Elizabeth, 1559, was not as splendid
  as some of the other shows that she had during her long and sumptuous reign,
  but it was remarkable for the effusion of affection and loyalty shown by the
  people. The date, January 15th, was chosen for her by her astrologer, Dr.
  Dee. The Archbishop of Canterbury refused to officiate and the Bishop of
  Carlisle crowned the Queen, the streets were gravelled and laid with "blue
  cloth" for the procession.</p>

  <h3>JAMES I</h3>

  <p class="first">The crowning of James, first of the House of Stewart to
  reign over the United Kingdom, was intended to be especially gorgeous and
  large sums were spent on preparing the pageantry, but the plague broke out
  and therefore the people were forbidden to come to Westminster; despite these
  precautions hundreds died during the week of the festivities.</p>

  <h3>CHARLES I</h3>

  <p class="first">Whenever a King's reign has been unfortunate it has been
  discovered afterwards that there were gloomy portents at his crowning. Thus
  in the case of Charles I it was remembered afterwards that, contrary to
  precedent, the King was robed in white during the ceremony in the Abbey. When
  a few faithful servitors took his headless body to the vault at Windsor a
  heavy snowstorm covered the modest coffin with a white pall, so that the wise
  men remarked that "in white the unhappy King had come to his throne and in
  white he left it."</p>

  <p>Charles I was termed "the White King" or "dead man" during the Civil War;
  white was considered unlucky for England; it was a white garment that
  victims, prepared for sacrifice, wore in early Britain, and for this and
  other obscure reasons white was avoided. The reason given for the King's
  unlucky choice is curious; it is said that there was not enough crimson or
  violet velvet in London for the robes, nor time to send to Genoa for a supply
  of this costly material; and so in face of tradition and popular feeling,
  white stuff, of which there was a plentiful supply, was employed. Another
  account is that Charles had a personal wish to wear white; the effect with
  the jewels, crimson shirt and golden crown, must have been magnificent.
  Charles I was crowned again at Scone, as King of Scotland; his Roman Catholic
  Queen, Henrietta Maria, refused to take part in either ceremony&mdash;at both
  of which "many ill omens were observed."</p>

  <h3>CHARLES II</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles II had an uneasy coronation at Scone in 1651; after
  nine years of exile he was crowned at Westminster.</p>

  <p>A touch of unearthly pomp was given to this coronation by a thunderstorm
  breaking over Westminster, so that, as Audley remarked, "the cannons and the
  thunder played together."</p>

  <h3>JAMES II</h3>

  <p class="first">The coronation of James II was the first to omit the
  procession from the Tower. The King was not popular, and the Londoners,
  missing their familiar treat, grumbled loudly. Nor did this coronation lack
  its ill-omens; the story went that the crown slipped off the King's head
  immediately after it had been placed there.</p>

  <h3>WILLIAM AND MARY</h3>

  <p class="first">The next coronation was unique in ceremonial and dramatic in
  circumstances. Two thrones and other Regalia had to be provided, as Mary,
  daughter of James II, was a Queen regnant, not a Queen consort, and held
  equal rights with her husband, William III.</p>

  <p>There was much that was unfortunate in this double coronation. The day,
  11th of April, was Ash Wednesday, which gave offence to many purists;
  Sancroft, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to officiate, and in his
  stead was chosen Mary's own Governor, Compton, Bishop of London. It was he
  who drew up a revised and modified form of the old coronation service that
  has been used ever since. In this form Compton changed the words, <i>the
  undoubted King of the realm,</i> for <i>the rightful inheritor of the crown
  of this realm.</i> The words in which the Coronation Oath were administered
  were on this occasion debated long in the House of Commons; here the oath "to
  maintain the Protestant form of religion as established by law" was
  introduced; so was the ceremony of the presentation of the Bible as an emblem
  of the Protestant religion.</p>

  <p>The time of their coronation was one of the greatest vexations and
  difficulties for the new sovereigns&mdash;Mary especially was in an agitated,
  emotional state, torn between her loyalty and intense love for her husband
  and her distress at occupying her father's throne. Her consenting to her
  coronation had indeed caused the greatest indignation to James, who wrote to
  her two days before the ceremony saying he had been willing to make excuses
  for her considering that her obedience to her husband and compliance to the
  nation might account for her conduct, but that her crowning was in her own
  power, and if she did it while he and the Prince of Wales were living, "the
  curses of an angry father would fall on her as well as of a God who commanded
  obedience to parents."</p>

  <p>News had recently come through that James II had landed in Ireland, and
  this in itself added to the Queen's terrible agitation. Her sister Anne
  refused to appear at the ceremony, being tortured by "pangs of conscience" as
  she declared; but her action was more likely inspired by spite.</p>

    <p class="caption">Mary II<br>
    From the painting by William Wissing (1685)</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Mary, who was intensely religious, objected to the noise, excitement,
  gaiety and pageantry of the coronation ceremony and composed a prayer for her
  own use on this occasion. She did not wish to receive the Sacrament at the
  same time as the crown; she argued that there was so much pomp and vanity in
  all the ceremonies that little time was left for devotion.</p>

  <p>The King and Queen went separately to this remarkable function. William,
  soon after ten in the morning, travelled by barge from Whitehall to
  Westminster Hall; Mary started three-quarters of an hour later in a sedan
  chair. When they were seated in Westminster Hall they were presented by the
  Keeper of the Crown Jewels with the Sword of State. There was some delay
  because the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl Marshal, had forgotten to summon the
  Dean and Chapter. When this difficulty was got over a procession started at
  one o'clock towards the Abbey; there were further delays and it was not until
  four o'clock that the King and Queen, having performed their private
  devotions, were ready for the ceremony of the coronation to begin.</p>

  <p>When the moment came for William to make the customary offering of the
  pound of gold, the value of a roll of silk, it was found that his purse had
  either been stolen on the way to the Abbey, which seemed unlikely, or he had
  forgotten it, and Lord Danby had to lend His Majesty twenty guineas. Gilbert
  Burnet preached a fanatical sermon, which lasted half an hour. When the long
  ritual was at length over the Treasurer threw about coronation medals, "for
  which everyone scrambled." The ceremony concluded with Holy Communion; then
  the King and Queen, again clad in the purple velvet and ermine robes in which
  they had set out, returned to Westminster Hall where a great dinner was held
  with much pomp.</p>

  <p>Here was another odd incident&mdash;the Earl Marshal, preceding the
  entrance of the first dishes with much parade, fell from his frightened
  horse. During the second course of the banquet Sir Charles Dymoke, the Royal
  Champion, entered on horseback and offered the challenge. Lady Russell
  commented that this coronation was "much finer and in better order than the
  last; though the numbers of ladies and attendants were fewer, they looked
  more cheerful than they had done when attending on Mary of Modena." John
  Evelyn noted that "the feast was magnificent."</p>

  <p>There was, however, an undignified quarrel between the Barons of the
  Cinque Ports and the Bishops as to the places they should have at the table.
  The Commons had two feasts and each of them received a gold coronation medal
  worth five-and-forty shillings. In the evening there was a Court at
  Whitehall; Lady Cavendish went to this Court to kiss the hands of the King
  and Queen: "There was a world of bonfires, and candles almost in every house,
  which looked extremely pretty." This lady noted the beauty of the Queen: "She
  was really altogether very handsome; her face is very agreeable and her shape
  and motions extremely graceful and fine. She is tall, but not so fine as the
  last Queen. Her room was mighty full of company, as you guess."</p>

  <h3>ANNE</h3>

  <p class="first">Anne was the only married woman to be crowned by herself as
  Queen regnant. Her elevation was more of a triumph for the Marlboroughs than
  it was for Anne Stewart, who, ill, weak-minded and tortured by conscience,
  would without much persuasion have resigned her Crown to her brother, Prince
  James.</p>

  <h3>GEORGE I</h3>

  <p class="first">A strong element of doubt and suspicion clouded the
  coronation of George I. It was known that the Jacobites were raising a
  rebellion, and it was "touch and go" whether George Louis would be able to
  hold a Throne he did not want in a country where he was disliked.</p>

  <p>There was much suspicion, ill-will and doubt among the people who went to
  see the Elector of Hanover crowned; only the common sense of the British
  middle-class and the financial interests of the City saved George his Crown.
  An added gloom to this ceremony was the fact that the King had no Queen, his
  divorced wife, Sophia Dorothea of Zell, then termed Duchess of Ahlden, being
  a prisoner in Germany. She never came to England, but her sad story was
  well-known among her former husband's new subjects and not considered to his
  credit since he was believed to have ordered the murder of Philip von
  Koenigsmark, Sophia Dorothea's lover.</p>

  <h3>GEORGE III</h3>

  <p class="first">The coronation of George III, who was young, handsome and
  considered "a true-born Englishman," was a very popular event and the
  occasion of much rejoicing. Allan Ramsay's coronation portrait of this King
  is very attractive; the Regalia were sent to the painter's studio for this
  picture. The coronation took place after the wedding of the young sovereign
  with the Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Queen was plain, but
  of impeccable behaviour, and, at first, popular; she scrupulously wore
  clothes and ornaments of British manufacture, but she tried to alter some of
  the English fashions and appeared at her coronation with her hair dressed
  low; this caused much comment, but "the ladies of Great Britain continued to
  wear a high 'topee.'"</p>

  <h3>GEORGE IV</h3>

  <p class="first">George IV took immense personal pains to ensure the accuracy
  and splendour of his coronation, but this was marred by the attempt of his
  repudiated Queen to enter the Abbey, by the weight of the crown and by the
  disorders at the banquet.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Coronation of King George the Fourth, 1821</p>
  </div><br>

  <h3>WILLIAM IV</h3>

  <p class="first">The coronation of William IV was modest, a mere pageant,
  somewhat meanly devised.</p>

  <h3>QUEEN VICTORIA</h3>

  <p class="first">That of Queen Victoria was remarkable for the display of
  popular enthusiasm and loyalty and for the richness and variety of the
  carefully arranged spectacle.</p>

  <p>In 1877 Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India, therefore King Edward
  VII was the first King Emperor; George V was solemnly inaugurated into the
  Imperial dignity at a superb coronation Durbar held at Delhi in 1911.</p>

  <p>Among the many remarkable incidents told of foreign coronations was that
  which occurred at the coronation of Marie de' Medici, when the repudiated
  wife of the King was present together with his Queen. Henry had been divorced
  from Marguerite de Valois, daughter of Catherine de' Medici, who, though
  recognised as Queen of Navarre, had never been crowned as Queen of France,
  and she consented to be present at the coronation of his second wife Marie
  de' Medici, which took place with gorgeous pomp. Marguerite was one of the
  most beautiful, witty and accomplished Princesses of her age; she took her
  place at this ceremony behind the King's sister. Her exquisite, wistful face
  looking over her shoulder at the spectators can be seen in the huge canvas in
  the Luxembourg, painted by Rubens to celebrate this sumptuous coronation. It
  was also remarkable for new fashions it introduced into France.</p>

  <p>The young Italian Queen wore the Tuscan style&mdash;the Medici collar of
  lace supported with wire which rose behind the neck to the height of nearly
  twelve inches; even the luxurious Parisians were astonished at the
  magnificence displayed on this occasion&mdash;precious tissues, cloths of
  gold and silver, velvet and ermine, were the materials of which the dresses
  of the ladies who waited on the young Queen were composed.</p>

  <p>The bold and warlike Henry of Navarre had always been himself most
  luxurious in his dress; for public occasions he had a superb suit of cloth of
  gold embroidered or almost totally covered with pearls which cost three
  hundred thousand crowns; it was considered then that fifty pounds' weight of
  pearls was necessary to cover a man's dress. At his wedding with Marie de'
  Medici, Henry wore white satin embroidered with silk and gold, a black cape
  and the little Italian toque that he had introduced into France out of
  compliment to his new wife. The King's mistress, Gabrielle d'Estrées, whom he
  would like to have seen crowned, boasted a dress equal in splendour to that
  displayed by the Queen when she attended the ceremony of a christening; it is
  said that the fair Gabrielle was so loaded with diamonds and pearls that she
  was scarcely able to stand and that she had a handkerchief valued at nine
  hundred and fifty gold crowns, ready money. Henry's dress at the coronation
  of his second Queen was of grey velvet shot with gold; he wore a grey taffeta
  hat and a white ostrich feather.</p>

  <h3>INEZ DE CASTRO</h3>

  <p class="first">One of the most dramatic of coronations was that of a dead
  woman, Inez de Castro, who was descended from the royal line of Castile and
  who married Pedro, son of Afonso IV, King of Portugal; she was murdered by
  order of her father-in-law at the Convent of St. Clara in Coimbra where she
  had taken refuge with her children. When, seven years later, her husband came
  to the throne, he not only executed all her murderers, but had her body
  disinterred from her modest tomb, exhibited in public the papal documents
  that gave consent to his marriage, and had the full coronation ceremonial
  gone through with his dead wife on a throne, with the diadem on her head and
  the royal robes wrapped round her; the nobility were required to kiss the hem
  of her garment. This dead Queen's coronation and funeral procession were one;
  she was carried with the greatest pomp and ceremony to Alcobaça, where a
  monument of white marble was erected, on which was placed her statue with the
  royal crown on her head.</p>

  <h3>CATHERINE THE GREAT</h3>

  <p class="first">A country girl, Martha, widow of a Swedish foot soldier, was
  secretly married for many years to Peter the Great. But the year before his
  death he announced that Catherine (as she became on being received into the
  Greek Church) was his wife, and he crowned her with his own hands. On his
  death she became Empress of All the Russias. She ruled with great judgment
  and humanity until her death at the age of thirty-eight years.</p>

  <p>CATHERINE II</p>

  <p>The next coronation of an Empress of All the Russias was that of Catherine
  II, Sophia, daughter of the Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst. It took place under very
  different circumstances and after two murders, that of the Empress's husband
  and that of Ivan, the rightful heir to the throne.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Tomb of Dona Inez at Alcobaça</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"None but fools are irresolute," said Catherine, and her coronation
  ceremony was of emphatic pomp and magnificence and adorned by that blaze of
  Eastern splendour that the Greek Church had inherited from Byzantinism; the
  Russian ceremonies, for sheer opulence and pomp, outshone any Western
  splendour.</p>

  <h3>PETER THE SECOND</h3>

  <p class="first">Amid the glittering magnificence of the coronation of Peter
  the Second and that of the Empress Anne, a sad and curious personality was
  conspicuous, the Empress Eudocia, first wife of Peter I and mother of the
  wretched Alexis. Eudocia had been chosen from among a hundred fair daughters
  of the aristocracy as a bride for the young Czar, but after a few years she
  was divorced and compelled to enter a convent that she afterwards exchanged
  for a cell in the fortress of Schlüsselburg; from this gloomy prison she
  emerged to see her grandson crowned.</p>

  <p>Few more melancholy living reminders of "the pomps and vanities of this
  wicked world" can ever have been present at a coronation than this Empress
  who had spent all her youth and prime in dismal seclusion or amid the rigours
  of a prison.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>On a day in mid-June, 1837, a fair young girl appeared on a balcony
  overlooking the courtyard of St. James's Palace, London. She wore a black
  silk dress, a crape scarf over a white tippet and a small black chip bonnet,
  and as she listened to the shouts of the people she wept into her small
  cambric handkerchief; this childish figure was Princess Alexandria Victoria
  and the occasion was that of her Proclamation as "Queen of Great Britain and
  Ireland and all its Dependencies."</p>

  <p>The coronation of the great Queen was unique in many respects, in the sex
  and youth of the Sovereign, in the great spontaneous outbursts of loyalty
  towards the throne&mdash;when the applauding people, in Lord Brougham's
  phrase, "took counsel with hope rather than experience"&mdash;and the unusual
  pomp of the ceremonial which concluded "with a gorgeous cavalcade from
  Buckingham Palace, up Constitution Hill, along Piccadilly and Pall Mall to
  Westminster," where many thousands of Londoners had the opportunity of seeing
  the young Queen, who went through the long strain of the fatiguing ceremony
  with a touching dignity and sincerity, thus happily inaugurating one of the
  longest, most remarkable reigns in any history.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a> IV. &mdash; ROYAL INFANTS, USURPERS, UNCROWNED KINGS AND<br>
  PRETENDERS&mdash;CURIOUS ANECDOTES AND ODDITIES<br>
  CONNECTED WITH CORONATIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was always a great eagerness shown in the crowning of
  a child or an infant as King or Queen in order to secure his or her rights,
  for it was early recognised that the awe in which a Sovereign was held and
  the loyalty with which he was regarded largely depended on whether or not the
  coronation ceremony had been performed. It was much easier to raise a
  rebellion against a Pretender than against a crowned King. For this reason
  even the youngest infants, instead of waiting until they were of an age to
  understand the obligations they were assuming and the responsibilities they
  were accepting, were admitted to the elaborate ceremonial of the coronation
  which made them the chosen leader of their people and God's Vice-gerent on
  earth.</p>

  <p>The first boy King of England, 978, was crowned under gloomy
  circumstances. Elfreda had caused the rightful heir, Edward, to be stabbed to
  death at Corfe Castle, that her own son Ethelred II, might be King. When St.
  Dunstan placed the crown on the boy's forehead he uttered over it: "Innocent
  head"&mdash;before he added the curse, that owing to his mother's crime the
  boy's crown should pass to one of another race and language.</p>

  <p>The coronation of the next boy King of England, Henry III, was also sombre
  and troubled; he was crowned when nine years old, a delicate shrinking child
  with a curious paralysis in one eyelid which caused it to droop heavily. This
  lad was one of our few Kings who were not crowned at Westminster&mdash;London
  was then in the hands of the Barons and the child's coronation took place at
  Gloucester. The royal diadem was also in the capital and the Bishop of
  Gloucester obtained a plain gold hoop, probably off the helmet of some noble
  knight, that was hastily beaten into a small size for the child's head.</p>

  <p>Edward VI was nine years old when crowned, a delicate, precocious boy
  reputed to be a finished Greek, Latin and French scholar, a lutanist and
  amateur astronomer. A Princess to whom for a short time Edward VI was
  betrothed, Mary, Queen of Scotland, was crowned as an infant of a year old;
  she had been proclaimed soon after her birth, for her father had died of a
  broken heart it was said soon after the defeat of the Scots by the English at
  Solway Moss. The royal child was held by Cardinal Beaton during the ceremony,
  and the crown was passed over her head. Mary was crowned Queen of France at
  Rheims in 1559; all the ladies were in mourning for Henry II, save
  herself.</p>

  <p>The crown was held over the Sovereign's head at the crowning of Mary's
  son, James VI of Scotland who became James I of England. He was later crowned
  at Stirling as an infant of a year old during his mother's lifetime as a
  result of her forced abdication of the throne. Here we have an instance of
  the importance attached to the ceremony of a coronation; as soon as the Scots
  Lords had obtained Mary's signature to the act of abdication, they had her
  young son crowned&mdash;he was thereafter regarded by the majority of the
  nation as the rightful King of Scotland.</p>

  <p>James had the unusual experience of being crowned twice, as an infant at
  Stirling and as a middle-aged man crowned in Westminster Abbey as King of
  England.</p>

  <p>The unhappy Caroline of Brunswick, wife of George IV, and her supporters
  attached immense importance to the ceremonial of the coronation; it was felt
  that the King's wife was not to be considered rightfully Queen until she had
  been crowned. This good-natured, but indiscreet and reckless Princess, had
  been most unhappily married; her life was one long recital of misfortune.
  Deserted by her husband after the birth of her child, Princess Charlotte
  Augusta, in 1796, the Princess of Wales as she was then&mdash;retired into
  private life and lived at Shooter's Hill and Blackheath. When her husband
  became Regent in 1811, she was denied access to her child and given no status
  in the country.</p>

  <p>Finally, as a means of getting rid of her, she was allowed to travel
  abroad, and left England in 1813. When she heard of the death of her
  father-in-law, George III, and of her husband's accession, and that her name
  had been omitted from the State papers, she decided to come home and claim
  her right as Queen of Great Britain. An offer of a handsome settlement was
  sent her on condition of her living abroad and not claiming the title of
  Queen. She continued on her way, however, rejecting this proposal, and
  entered London in June, 1820.</p>

  <p>The Queen and her cause were very popular with the people. She was adopted
  by the Reform Party; and William Cobbett became her personal friend and wrote
  the letters that she sent to the King in her name, but that were, however,
  returned unanswered. A Bill was promoted in the Lords for divorcing her, but
  abandoned from fear of a revolution after a most scandalous exposure of the
  King's and Queen's private lives. It is really amazing that the dignity of
  the Crown survived this ordeal and says much for the respect with which
  George III had been able to inspire his subjects that they tolerated such
  conduct on the part of his son and daughter-in-law.</p>

  <p>The wretched Queen's position remained miserably ambiguous. She was denied
  a palace and any semblance of state; but, about a year after her arrival in
  England, urged on by enthusiastic and wrong-headed supporters, she decided to
  force her way into the Abbey on the coronation day, July 29th, 1821. Without
  state or pageantry, but with a noisy band of supporters, who were joined by
  most of the London mob as she proceeded on her way, Queen Caroline
  endeavoured to enter the Abbey, and while the solemn ceremonial of placing
  the crown of Great Britain on her husband's head was taking place within, the
  Queen's party was battering upon the hastily shut doors while the mob were
  throwing stones at the windows and fighting the soldiery.</p>

    From the painting by Sir Thomas Lawrence</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Repulsed from the doors of the Abbey and having obtained nothing by her
  desperate effort, but further loss of dignity and another scandal to the
  crown, the Queen and her motley procession turned and tried to enter
  Westminster Hall during the banquet. This festival, the last of its kind ever
  held, was interrupted by the fierce street fighting outside. At last the
  Queen retired, repulsed and exhausted. It is possible that, the state of the
  country being as it was, the question of Queen Caroline might have been a
  match to the tinder and have caused a revolution had she not died
  heart-broken, the same year as that which saw her humiliation before
  Westminster Abbey. She was a woman of nearly sixty years of age who had long
  been in doubtful health and had endured a series of almost unexampled
  misfortunes and humiliations. She had shown little pride or dignity during
  her life, but directed that "Queen of England" should be placed on her tomb.
  When told she was dying, she uttered her own bitter epitaph: "It does not
  matter."</p>

  <p>One of the most dramatic coronations on record was that of Charles VII of
  France at Rheims. The tremendous importance attached to the coronation
  ceremony in France is shown by the fact that it was Joan of Arc's divine
  mission to see the King "crowned," that is, consecrated and anointed in
  Rheims Cathedral. The Saints whom Joan saw in her vision gave her the direct
  command to relieve the city of Orleans and to crown the Dauphin; after she
  had, in a manner that seemed both to her countrymen and to the English
  miraculous, accomplished the first part of her mission and relieved Orleans,
  "the sorceress", as the English termed her, hastened to Tours where Charles
  the Dauphin was then in residence and urged him at once "to go to Rheims to
  be crowned."</p>

  <p>Charles hesitated and urged Joan first to reduce the fort of Patay that
  the English held under Talbot; this she did, and gained a victory in which
  the English general was taken prisoner and upwards of two thousand English
  killed.</p>

  <p>Again Joan urged the King to be crowned; only in this way did she believe
  that he would become the symbol of the nation and of the Divine wish that
  France should be liberated from the enemy, and only by the actual crowning of
  the King could she fulfil the commands divinely laid upon her. Charles was
  sluggish, incredulous, fearful; but his counsellors and soldiers, inspired to
  enthusiasm by the successes of the Maid, the fire and wonder of her presence,
  persuaded the Dauphin to follow Joan's advice.</p>

  <p>With her weak and starveling army the Maid attacked Troyes, which fell,
  and only three months after her appearance at the Court of Charles she stood
  beside the altar in the ancient Cathedral on the spot consecrated to the
  sacred anointing of the Kings of France. This ceremony accomplished, to which
  she attached much importance, Joan wished to return to her sheep-keeping, but
  was tragically dissuaded.</p>

  <p>Joan thus fulfilled the prophecy that "France lost by a woman (Isabel of
  Bavaria) should be saved by a virgin from the frontiers of Lorraine." This
  coronation must have been the most remarkable ever to take place in the old
  city of Rheims.</p>

  <p>St. Joan knelt before the King and exclaimed: "Sweet King, now is
  consummated the good pleasure of God, who willed you should come to Rheims to
  receive your worthy coronation, thereby to show that you are truly King."</p>

  <p>Jean Fouquet's portrait of Charles VII, the hero of this remarkable scene,
  shows him to have been one of the plainest of a plain family, but he had some
  kingly qualities and was the father of a great man, Louis XI, who did for
  France what St. Joan would have wished to see done.</p>

  <p>This King also was triumphantly crowned at Rheims; the French monarchy was
  then at the beginning of its splendour and lustre and the sense of its
  "divinity" keenly felt; it had already endured the stress and tumult of
  hundreds of years, from the Merovingian and Carolingian Kings to the
  Capetians and the House of Valois.</p>

  <p>A Burgundian chronicler, Georges Chastellain, has left an eye-witness's
  account of the crowning of Louis XI, one of the makers of modern France. This
  ceremony took place with traditional splendour; for once the King went
  gorgeously in crimson and white satin with a velvet bonnet to the Cathedral.
  After the anointing in the shape of a cross with the sacred oil, Louis was
  attired in a rose-coloured silk shirt, a habit of regal blue, then the azure
  robes sprinkled with the golden lilies. Philip the Good, of Burgundy, his
  arch enemy, as first peer of France crowned the King; when the diadem was
  placed on Louis' brows the silver trumpets sounded and the crowds shouted:
  "<i>Vive le roy! Noël! Noël!"</i></p>

  <p>The High Mass of coronation followed, then the banquet, for which the Duke
  of Burgundy lent the opulent gold and silver plate; Louis XI left Rheims the
  next day already resolved on the destruction of the dazzling Burgundian
  Prince who had held the crown over his own clever head.</p>

  <p>A ghastly mock coronation was invented by the ingenuity of the cruel
  French Princess, Marguerite of Anjou, when she caused the Pretender to the
  throne, Richard, Duke of York, to be beheaded and then had his head crowned
  with paper and set on the rampart of his city, York, while her drunken
  soldiery did mock obeisance before the ghastly trophy. It is possible that
  Marguerite was not wholly responsible for this outrage, but was merely unable
  to restrain her brutal followers; but "la louve" seems to have been worthy of
  her name.</p>

  <p>The head of the Yorkist Prince was afterwards sent to London still crowned
  in mockery with paper spikes, and offered to the jibes of the populace;
  neither the city of York nor the family of the Duke ever forgave this
  atrocious deed; it was probably responsible for much of the fury with which
  the war of the Roses was subsequently conducted. The mock coronation was more
  resented by the Yorkists than the murder of Rutland, the Duke's young son, or
  the slaughter of the prisoners after the battle.</p>

  <p>During the war of the Austrian succession, the rival claimants made
  strenuous efforts to be crowned at Frankfort-on-the-Maine with the ancient
  ceremonial of the Emperors of the West; and the French did succeed in thus
  crowning their Pretender, the son of the Elector of Bavaria, a youth of
  eighteen; but though he received with full pomp all the insignia of Imperial
  rank he never reigned, never possessed a rood of land, is scarcely a name in
  history, and died soon after his coronation, obscure and neglected.</p>

  <p>The successful claimant in this long and costly dispute was Maria Theresa,
  daughter of the Emperor Charles VI, usually acknowledged as the finest ruler
  that the House of Habsburg has produced; yet though her claim to rule alone
  was admitted by virtue of the Pragmatic Sanction, and guaranteed by all the
  powers of Europe save the Bourbons, she resigned her Imperial throne first to
  her husband, Francis of Lorraine, with whom she was deeply in love, then to
  her son, the Emperor Joseph, and both these Princes were crowned with full
  ceremonial at Frankfort-on-the-Maine; the glory of the Caesars was merely
  shared by the woman who might justly have claimed it entirely. The Empress
  remained, however, by sheer force of character the principal influence in the
  State, and this despite the cares of a large family&mdash;sixteen children in
  twenty years&mdash;and the most ambitious plans for the advancement of the
  House of Habsburg.</p>

  <p>In amusing contrast to the almost fabulous splendours of the Imperial
  coronations was that of a very extraordinary personage, Theodore von Neuhof,
  King of Corsica. This adventurer was a Westphalian nobleman, an eighteenth
  century soldier of fortune and a friend of John Law, the Scottish financier;
  Von Neuhof made considerable sums out of the South Sea Bubble and Law's
  schemes for paper money.</p>

  <p>Soon after this fraud was exploded Von Neuhof left Paris, and after
  wandering about Europe and engaging in several adventures, now obscure,
  arrived at Leghorn to hear that the isle of Corsica was endeavouring to throw
  off the rule of Genoa; Von Neuhof then determined to make a throw for
  sovereignty.</p>

  <p>In common with some other bold spirits he got together money, arms and
  ammunition and sailed for Corsica with a suite of two officers, a secretary,
  a chaplain, a chamberlain, a head cook, three maids and four lackeys. He
  landed in Corsica ten cannon, above seven thousand guns, two thousand pairs
  of shoes, a large quantity of all sorts of stores, as well as sundry chests
  of gold and silver pieces.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Corsican rebellion received him warmly and conducted
  him at once to the Bishop's palace in Campo Loro, which was guarded by four
  hundred men and two cannon. Thus installed, Von Neuhof placed himself at the
  head of the Corsican rebellion and declared war against the Republic of
  Genoa. Soon afterwards, on April 15th, he was elected King of Corsica by a
  large popular "assembly" consisting of all ranks of Corsicans.</p>

  <p>The coronation took place in an open field and consisted of a garland of
  leaves being placed on Theodore's peruke that was composed, according to an
  odd fashion of the time, of loops of grey velvet. For the rest His Majesty
  was dressed in a long scarlet wadded coat and carried a hat under his arm, a
  stick and a sword. Soon after this ceremony King Theodore organised his Court
  and his State and struck gold, silver and copper coinage which displayed on
  the obverse his bust and on the reverse a crown and three palm trees; there
  was a Latin legend, together with the arms of the Neuhof family.</p>

  <p>Though for a while successful, Theodore was soon forced to fly Corsica and
  the rest of his life is a record of misery; he ended by reaching London in
  1749, having been led by the British Government to expect some help from them
  to expel the French from Corsica. They, however, ignored the penniless
  adventurer and the manufacturers of arms and munitions to whom he owed money
  had him arrested for debt. It is said that the unfortunate King, in an
  attempt to compound with these creditors, received them in his Soho garret,
  enthroned on a broken chair placed on a bed beneath a ragged tester to give
  himself a semblance of royalty.</p>

  <p>He passed several years in the utmost misery in the King's Bench prison;
  then several people took compassion on him and Garrick had a play performed
  for his benefit. But in 1755, when the Act of Parliament was passed by which
  all insolvent debtors were set at liberty, Neuhof was turned adrift to
  starve. He made an appeal in the public papers for charity and small sums
  were sent him, but when he died in 1756 he was buried by the Parish of St.
  Anne's, Soho. This unfortunate King was married to a daughter of Patrick
  Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan, and his wife, Honor de Burgh, afterwards became
  Duchess of Berwick. It was at the Spanish Court that Theodore met his wife,
  who, however, did not share his odd coronation, for he had long before spent
  her fortune and forsaken her person.</p>

  <p>The exiled Princes of the House of Stewart, son and grandsons of James II,
  were never crowned; and they owed much of the uncertainty of their position
  to this fact. Had Prince Charles Edward been King <i>de jure</i> instead of
  Prince of Wales <i>de jure,</i> in 1745-6, he would probably have been
  crowned while he was victorious in Scotland and thus added greatly to his
  prestige and authority.</p>

  <p>"Uncrowned Queens" are numerous in history. The most powerful was probably
  Madame de Maintenon, the second wife of Louis XV, who exercised a vast
  influence over her husband. Mrs. Fitzherbert was married to George IV by
  Protestant rites that were recognised by her Church, that of Rome. Among
  "Queens of the Left Hand" may be mentioned the good and beautiful Agnes
  Sorel; the wicked and beautiful Barbara Palmer; Madame du Barry, the
  gambler's decoy who called Louis XIV "La France," and treated him as her
  lackey; and the Duchess of Portsmouth, agent of the Bourbons at the Court of
  Charles II. All these women had the magnificence and the influence of any
  wedded wife or crowned Queen; royal consorts were often a negligible
  quantity, scarcely noticed after the pomp of their coronations.</p>

  <p>Among notable "pretenders" who were never crowned was Henry V of France
  known as the Comte de Chambord, who died in exile despite the heroic efforts
  of his mother, the Duchesse de Berri, to place him on the throne that was
  legitimately his; his rival, the little Duke of Orleans, was taken to the
  Senate during the revolution of 1849, Louis Philippe, his grandfather, having
  abdicated in his favour; the child, led by his widowed mother, was proclaimed
  by the senators as King of the French; at the same moment the mob broke in
  and amid shrieks of "Down with the Monarchy!" the chamber hastily emptied and
  the Duchess of Orleans and her son retreated forever into exile. This one
  minute's reign may be considered the shortest on record.</p>

  <p>The last coronations to take place in France were those of the
  Prince-President Napoleon III as Emperor of the French, and that which
  shortly afterwards followed, the crowning of his beautiful wife, the Empress
  Eugenie; the two ceremonies were performed with ostentatious splendour, but
  largely ignored by the old nobility of France. Through the Dukes of Alba and
  Berwick, Eugenie de Montijos was descended from Arabella Churchill and James
  II; no more elegant and exquisite creature ever wore a crown. The city of
  Paris voted her as a coronation present six hundred thousand francs with
  which to buy a <i>parure</i> of diamonds, but the Empress devoted the money
  to "the education and maintenance of sixty working-class girls."</p>

  <p>Among the curiosities connected with coronations may be mentioned the
  mourning coronation of Louis XIII who was installed at Rheims, 1610, after
  the murder of his father Henry IV. The child's royal robe was plain violet
  serge, he rode a white horse with purple trappings and all the Court wore
  black. Another oddity was the crowning of the Duke of Warwick as King of the
  Isle of Wight, an act performed by Henry VI with his own hand.</p>

  <p>After the discovery of the Canaries, known then as the Fortunate Isles, in
  1344, Don Luis, son of the King of Castile, was crowned as "King of the
  Fortunate Isles" by Pope Clement VII at Avignon; Luis never saw his kingdom
  and his title remained purely nominal.</p>

  <p>Lambert Simnel was crowned in Dublin with due pomp with a diadem taken
  from a statue of the Virgin Mary; this impostor claimed to be the Yorkist
  heir, son of Clarence, brother of Edward IV, and he took the title of Edward
  VI; he was captured at Stoke-on-Trent, but pardoned by Henry VII and sent to
  work in the royal kitchens.</p>

  <p>Another adventurer, Cola di Rienzi, was crowned with great pomp in 1347 at
  Rome, with seven crowns each of different design in precious metals to
  symbolise the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. Touches of comedy have not been
  wholly lacking at some coronations and there is humour in the tale of the
  faithful hound belonging to Frederic IV of Denmark, who, allowed into the
  church during the coronation, broke loose and tried to fell the Bishop who,
  so the beast thought, was trying to maltreat his master, "and stood ready to
  devour the Bishop at the first movement made to continue the ceremony."</p>

  <p>Amusing too is the story of the Greek Emperor John Ducas Vataces, who, by
  careful attention to the Imperial farms was able to present his Empress with
  a crown of diamonds and pearls purchased with the profits made from selling
  eggs.</p>

     CORONATIONS&mdash;<br>
  KINGSTON, WINCHESTER, FRANKFORT, AIX-LA-CHAPELLE,<br>
  RHEIMS, WESTMINSTER, SCONE, MOSCOW, UPSALA</h2>

  <p>If we glance at the various places and cities connected with the
  solemnities of "the crowning of the King," we shall find ourselves travelling
  in imagination, even if we take Europe only, to widely scattered spots in
  widely different countries, each hallowed by long association with the
  aspirations to grandeur, the pride and power of different peoples.</p>

  <p>The earliest Kings who had any pretensions to be considered Sovereigns of
  the entire island of Britain were crowned at Kingston-on-Thames upon a stone
  that, until lately, stood in the centre of the town.</p>

  <p>It is known that Athelstan, grandson of Alfred the Great, was crowned
  there as King of All Britain with great festival and solemnity in the year of
  Our Lord 925. Athelstan's proper title was King of the West Saxons and
  Mercians, but he boasted to be King of all the English. He was buried in
  Malmesbury Abbey, far from the resting-place of his long line of successors.
  This great King obtained the homage of the Welsh princes and broke the power
  of Scotland at the battle of Brunaburgh, so that it may be justly claimed
  that he was indeed, as he boasted, King of All Britain.</p>

  <p>His famous grandfather, Alfred, to whom is due the germ of the idea of the
  unity of the Kingdom of Great Britain, was hallowed at Rome by Pope Leo IV in
  853 as King of English or West Saxons; the little King being then five years
  old.</p>

  <p>Within a hundred years of the crowning of Athelstan, the Church or Abbey
  of St. Peter was founded in Thorney Island also on the Thames and not many
  miles from Kingston, which must, from its name, have then been a small
  village that owed its entire fame to the crowning of the King taking place
  there.</p>

  <p>Rude blocks of stone were usually employed by Celtic people for the
  elevation of their King; the legend being they were the stones on which Jacob
  had slept while he dreamt of the angels ascending into Heaven. The Irish
  coronation stone was placed at Tara, in the green hills in Meath, where you
  may still see the raths or furrows where the halls of the ancient Irish Kings
  stood. This stone was supposed to utter a musical sound when the Monarch
  stepped on it; the idea of the stone was obviously to elevate the King above
  his people and was the first crude idea of a throne; the inaugural chair that
  all ancient peoples used for the crowning of their sovereigns appears to have
  been of stone; some antiquaries think that they may have been meteors, and,
  falling from Heaven, easily have acquired a miraculous character. But such as
  have survived, or of which there are records, seem to have been taken from
  quarries in the locality of the place where they were set. Kingston-on-Thames
  takes its name from the royal stone on which at least eight Anglo-Saxon
  monarchs were crowned, 927-1016.</p>

  <p>For nearly five centuries Winchester disputed with London the honour of
  being the capital of England; it was first an early settlement, then a Roman
  city containing temples to Apollo and to Concord. It is claimed that the
  first Christian Church was built there in A.D. 169. Alfred the Great was
  educated at Winchester and during a large portion of his glorious reign
  resided there. A rich and fantastic Saxon Church was built there and
  destroyed by the Normans, who raised on the site the superb Cathedral
  completed many years later by the magnificent Cardinal Beaufort. The
  celebrated college was founded by Wykeham in 1369. Several of the early
  English Kings were crowned at Winchester; the first coronation seems to have
  been that of Alfred in 871. The succeeding Kings were crowned at Kingston or
  Bath until 1041, when St. Edward was crowned at Winchester.</p>

  <p>Henry I removed the royal treasure from Winchester in 1100; the "young
  King," Henry, son of Henry II, was twice crowned, once at Winchester; and in
  that city Richard was crowned again, after his return from captivity.</p>

  <p>Henry III was called Henry of Winchester, but he was crowned at Gloucester
  and Westminster. From this period Westminster, especially built for the
  purpose by Edward the Confessor, was the only place where Kings of England
  were crowned. Winchester remained a superb city, with cathedral, castle and
  college as priceless relics of her ancient splendour. At the time of the
  founding of Westminster Abbey, the site of the city of Westminster was a
  large mash where the Thames divided into two branches; the piece of ground in
  the middle was called Thorney Isle from the number of thorn trees and
  brambles that covered the higher levels of the swamp.</p>

  <p>The story went that somewhere early in the seventh century a venerable
  traveller asked two fishermen who were rowing in a rude skiff over the Thames
  to take him to the island. They did so, and when the stranger landed he
  declared himself to be St. Peter and that it was his wish that a church
  should be built in his honour on this unlikely spot. Therefore, the Saxon
  King, Ecgberht, erected a plain church to St. Peter on Thorney Island; this
  had small high-set windows and a tower; a Benedictine monastery was soon
  attached to it and it became a Collegiate Church.</p>

  <p>Higher up the river, near where the Mint afterwards stood, was another
  monastery called East Minster, so that the one on Thorney Island came to be
  known as West Minster. When the Danes burnt London they partly destroyed the
  old church, but it was rebuilt by Edgar in 985, who re-roofed and patched up
  the ruins of the original building.</p>

  <p>When Edward the Confessor was exiled in Normandy he vowed that if he
  should come to the throne of his father he would make a pilgrimage to Rome,
  where were the tombs of the Apostles. But when he became King he found that
  it was impossible to go to Rome, so he compromised by refounding the Abbey of
  Westminster. This building, which was undertaken on a grand scale, was
  finished at Christmas, 1066; the Confessor held his Court in the palace that
  had been built adjoining the sacred building, and on Holy Innocents' Day the
  church was dedicated to St. Peter. In the first week of the new year the King
  was dead and buried in the vaults of the great church, that was ultimately
  completely rebuilt by Henry III and Edward I.</p>

  <p>This thirteenth century church was, however, never completed; a mighty
  central and two western towers were part of the original design; the eastern
  end which had a number of chapels round it was pulled down by Henry VII when
  he added the incomparable chapel that still goes by his name.</p>

  <p>The early Norman Kings were all, save Henry III and Matilda, crowned at
  Westminster Abbey on the spot where St. Peter told the fishermen to found his
  church among the thorn trees and brambles.</p>

  <p>The Abbot of Westminster was the custodian of the Regalia and royal robes
  and was entrusted with all the details of the coronation ceremony; the Dean
  and Chapter of Westminster afterwards succeeded to these privileges and
  therefore claim the right to instruct the Sovereign in the coronation rites
  and to assist the Primate in the service together with several other honours
  and duties; their fees consisted of robes for themselves, the floor-cloth of
  the church, the other furnishing of the Abbey on this occasion and many other
  rich perquisites. Westminster was for long divided by fields from London; the
  Abbey church, the palace attached to it, the right of sanctuary, the hall in
  which the Parliament met and where State trials were held, gave it a unique
  importance in England and English history. The ancient college of the
  Benedictines survives in the famous school refounded by Queen Elizabeth and
  situated in buildings attached to the Abbey, some of which were the
  dormitories of the monks.</p>

  <p>Scone was the ancient royal seat of Scotland. This town, on the left bank
  of the Tay in Perthshire, was capital of Pictavia as early as A.D. 710 and
  the coronation place of the Scottish Kings from 1153 to 1488. "The stone of
  destiny" was removed by Edward I in 1296 and the last Scottish King to stand
  upon the throne to be acclaimed by his people was Alexander III, who was
  installed in 1249 with all the old Celtic ceremonies.</p>

  <p>It is notable that a King in exile, Prince James, the "old
  Pretender"&mdash;or James III according to the Jacobites&mdash;was at Scone
  for three weeks in 1716; and his son, Prince Charles Edward, was there in
  1745. Both these disinherited Princes, who made such gallant but hopeless
  attempts to regain their hereditary throne, must have experienced poignant
  sensations at being on the spot where the ancient Kings of Scotland had been
  crowned with such solemn ritual.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Kaiser-Dom at Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle)</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The two Stewart Princes stayed in the palace of the Viscount Stormont,
  which was on the site of an old Augustinian Abbey destroyed by the
  Calvinistic mob in 1559.</p>

  <p>An even older city than Scone is Rheims on the Vesle. This was the capital
  of the Remi, and under its Latin name is mentioned by Julius Caesar. It was
  the scene of the baptism of Clovis I, the Frankish Conqueror, who laid the
  foundations of modern France in 496; this gave it a peculiar importance in
  the history of Christianity and of the French people, and by the eighth
  century, when it became a bishopric, the city had acquired a quasi-sacred
  character. Philip Augustus, great engineer and splendid soldier, was crowned
  at Rheims in 1179, and from then until the nineteenth century the only Kings
  of France not crowned and sanctified at Rheims were Henry IV, Napoleon I and
  Louis XVIII.</p>

  <p>The cathedral of Rheims, which had been the scene of so many coronations,
  was sacked in 1793 and the <i>Sainte Ampoule,</i> the vessel in the shape of
  a dove that held the Holy Oil&mdash;supposed to have been brought by a dove
  from Heaven for the sacring of Clovis&mdash;was smashed by a rioter; in 1830
  the elaborate ceremony of the coronation was abolished. The cathedral, partly
  destroyed in the last European war and restored with exquisite skill, is one
  of the most splendid churches in the world. It was built between 1212 and
  1380. St. Remy, who baptised and crowned Clovis and who received the dove
  sent with the Chrism, also has a Romanesque church in Rheims; this city has
  always been famous for a trade in wine and wool.</p>

  <p>More ancient still, going back beyond Christian history, is the place that
  was for long the scene of the coronations of the Kings of the Swedes, Goths
  and Vandals; this is Upsala in Sweden, which stands on a little stream that
  runs to Lake Malar. It was the last stronghold of heathenism in Europe. It is
  mentioned in the old Viking sagas and is supposed to have been the abode of
  the earliest Viking kings who were named Ynglings, descendants of one of the
  gods&mdash;Yngvi.</p>

  <p>In Upsala was a great temple covered with gilding in which stood colossal
  statues of the three great Gods&mdash;Thor, Odin, Fricco; every nine years a
  magnificent pagan festival was celebrated at Upsala, to which all the tribes
  of Scandinavia contributed; this heathen temple was standing in A.D. 1070.
  Human beings, even kings and chieftains, were sometimes sacrificed at Upsala
  to appease the gods; the bodies of these victims were hung in a great grove
  near the temple.</p>

  <p>A historian, writing in 1220, speaks of Upsala as being "the King's Seat
  and the Archbishop's See"&mdash;it was then called "the wealth of Upsala."
  From this famous spot the law was given out, and it was known as "Upsala
  Law." A Norwegian Embassy went to Upsala in the mid-winter of 1018 to ask for
  the hand of the daughter of the Swedish King for the King of Norway, who is
  described as seated on a throne in the open before the temple, his court
  about him in a circle. Many tumuli of these old Gothic kings have been found
  at Old Upsala; the heathen gods were at last driven out, their temple razed
  down and a brick cathedral built at Upsala by 1589; a university was
  afterwards founded and Gustavus Vasa built a castle on this famous spot.</p>

  <p>The Scandinavian Kings in the heroic age were crowned at the funerals of
  their predecessors at Upsala; we are in the fascinating realm of legend with
  Eric Lugersoll, the last heathen king in Sweden and a notable magician; he
  broke open the tomb of the Viking, Svenken, at Upsala and found a gold tablet
  on which was three times nine crowns on one side and three times seven crowns
  on the other; these symbolised all the Christian monarchs who were to rule
  over Scandinavia.</p>

  <p>The Kings of Denmark are crowned in the royal chapel of the Castle of
  Fredericsberg. The Danish Regalia comprise crowns of exquisite workmanship,
  in particular that of Christian IV; but the most famous emblems of Danish
  sovereignty are the celebrated three silver lions, which formed part of all
  the regal ceremonies in this country from coronations to funerals.</p>

  <p>Turning from the Celtic twilight of the far north to the sombre
  magnificence of the south, we come to Toledo on the north bank of the Tagus,
  for long the capital of Spain and the place where the Kings were crowned. The
  gates and towers of Toledo were built by King Wamba in the seventh century
  and added to and beautified by Alfonso VI in 1109. The cathedral is on the
  site of a mosque and was building from 1227 to 1493; it was long regarded as
  one of the most magnificent in the world. On the Zocodover, the great square
  of Toledo, took place many pageants, from burning of heretics to
  bull-fights.</p>

  <p>The Alcazár, an ancient Moorish fortress, was enlarged by the Kings of
  Spain and at one time commanded by the Cid, the famous hero of Spanish story;
  the city was further glorified by the residence of El Greco and by the
  manufacture of the most famous sword blades in the world and of costly gold
  and silver embroideries.</p>

  <p>Toledo, once the city of the Goths, is in the very heart of Spain, and
  even in its hey-day seems to have been regarded by the foreigner as gloomy,
  forbidding and sombre. Alfonso VII was one of the first Princes to hold a
  great Cortes at Toledo; it was attended by vassal princes, prelates and
  noblemen; the people were allowed to be present at this council, but only in
  the part of an admiring chorus&mdash;"to see, to hear, to pray to God."
  Toledo was the scene of the imprisonment of that unhappy Queen, Blanche of
  Castile, who was shut up by her husband in the Alcazár; also of the massacre
  by her husband, Pedro the Cruel, of all the noblemen who supported his
  half-brother Don Enrique.</p>

  <p>Avila was the scene of an extraordinary Spanish coronation. In the year
  1465 a dummy representing King Enrique was placed on a scaffold in the centre
  of the town, adorned with a crown, a sceptre and a sword. Then a herald rose
  and declared the King to be deprived of royal dignity, of the administration
  of justice, of the government of the realm, of the throne and of the title of
  King. The Archbishop of Toledo and three noblemen removed severally the
  crown, the sword, the sceptre and the effigy itself; this last was kicked
  from the throne and tossed to the crowd, who savagely tore it to pieces. The
  young Prince Alfonso, the son of the King who had been thus strangely
  degraded, was then elevated to the Chair of State on the scaffold and
  solemnly crowned King by the Archbishop.</p>

  <p>Buda, that stands on the vine-clad slopes of the left bank of the Danube,
  is on the site of a Roman colony, and in the thirteenth century was a German
  town called Old Buda. It was destroyed by the Mongols in 1247, but soon
  rebuilt; it was the capital of Hungary from the middle of the twelfth century
  till its capture by the Turks in 1527. It was then besieged half a dozen
  times by the Imperialists and taken, after many feats of arms on both sides,
  in 1686. Buda was called "the boss on the shield of Europe," owing to its
  being the scene of this constant warfare with the Turks.</p>

  <p>The citadel was the scene of the coronation of the ancient Kings of
  Hungary, who were elevated in the chapel of St. Sigismund, where the Regalia
  of Hungary and the hand of St. Stephen are still kept and regarded with the
  greatest reverence and awe. The Magyar Sovereigns, when they were crowned,
  used to point with their swords to the four corners of the compass, making
  four several oaths to protect the frontiers of the Kingdom&mdash;east, west,
  south and north. The crown of St. Stephen consists of one of Byzantine design
  and one of Roman shape, joined together; it has a romantic history and was
  used for the crowning of Stanislaus (1439) when, at four months of age he lay
  in the lap of his mother Elizabeth, who kept the sacred crown in her own
  chamber. A rebellion forcing the Queen to fly to Vienna, she took the crown
  with her sewn up in a velvet cushion. This crown was pawned and taken out of
  Hungary several times; it was restored to the Magyars in 1784, but in 1849
  Kossuth, the dictator of Hungary, took it by force; he planned to send it to
  London, but the crown was discovered hidden in a field and finally restored
  to Buda.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Emperor Maximilian<br>
    From the painting by Peter Paul Reubens (1618)</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The first Emperors of the West were crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) in
  the Rhineland. This town first emerges from the obscurity of legend in the
  time of Charlemagne, who was buried in the great church there in 814. He
  rebuilt the Imperial Palace, his chapel was destroyed by the Normans and
  another erected by Otto III, 983. In 1165 Frederic Barbarossa, after opening
  the tomb of Charlemagne, had a shrine made to contain all the relics of the
  mighty Emperor. Thirty-five Emperors and eleven Empresses were crowned in
  Aix-la-Chapelle and held their banquets in the hall that was a hundred and
  two feet long and sixty feet wide in the Town hall&mdash;from Louis the Pious
  (813) to Ferdinand III (1637). Seventeen Imperial Diets and eleven Provincial
  Councils also were held in this superb chamber; in the Middle Ages,
  Aix-la-Chapelle was a powerful free city; on its detachment from the Empire
  its Imperial state vanished and the Emperors ceased to hold their state, and
  the councils and Diets their debates and elections there.</p>

  <p>The Emperors of the West (or the Holy Roman Emperors) should have been
  crowned at Rome <i>(caput mundi)</i> by the Pope. Their title really depended
  on this ceremony, but as the later Emperors were unable to make the journey
  to Rome, and as Aix-la-Chapelle was lost, some of them (among them the great
  Emperor Maximilian) were never crowned at all, which gave their enemies the
  chance to call their titles in question; Maximilian may be seen, however, in
  many portraits with the complete Imperial Regalia, wearing a gorgeous
  diadem.</p>

  <p>It became the custom from 1711 for the Emperors to be crowned at the old
  free city of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, which was chosen also as the place of
  the election of the Emperors. In the Roemer or town-hall, an interesting
  Gothic building of 1406, is the Kaisersaal where the Emperor held his
  coronation banquet. The coronation itself took place in the cathedral of St.
  Bartholomew, erected from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries; this
  also contains the chapel where the electors voted.</p>

  <p>Frankfort-on-the-Maine was from early times considered a most important
  city; Charlemagne declared it to be the capital of the Eastern Frankish
  Kingdom. It was the first free city of the German Empire in 1255, and as
  early as 1356 had been selected by the Golden Bull of Charles IV as the place
  for the Diet to sit. Frankfort was famous for its fairs, where the first
  printed book was sold, and for the freedom it offered to the persecuted
  during periods of religious intolerance.</p>

  <p>There is, perhaps, no place so remarkable for coronations as the Kremlin
  in Moscow on the Moska. This Kremlin or citadel has eighteen towers and five
  gates. It contains three cathedrals&mdash;that of the Assumption, that of the
  Annunciation and that of the Archangel&mdash;several other churches,
  monasteries, four palaces, an Arsenal, halls and libraries, together with
  many other buildings. The whole is decorated with Asiatic splendour, with
  gilded cupolas, fantastic carvings, and interiors blazing with mosaic, and
  with barbaric colours.</p>

  <p>It was in the Cathedral of the Assumption that the Czars and the
  Metropolitans of the Greek Church were consecrated. This cathedral was built
  between 1326 and 1496 and was regarded as the most sacred spot of the sacred
  Kremlin, the heart of the Empire. The city itself dates from the twelfth
  century; it was sacked by the Mongols and refounded and restored by Ivan III
  in the fifteenth century, who assumed the title of Czar of All the
  Russias.</p>

  <p>Even after the founding of St. Petersburg by Peter the Great, Moscow the
  Holy was regarded by all true Russians as the very soul of the country. Not
  even the coronations of the Emperors of the West at Rome or of the Emperors
  of the East in Byzantium surpassed in splendour that of the Czars of All the
  Russias that took place with Eastern pomp and Christian ritual in the
  Cathedral of the Assumption in this city within a city&mdash;the Kremlin in
  Moscow. All the ambassadors received by the Czars of Muscovy were amazed at
  the splendour of the Kremlin, the "throne of Solomon" with its roaring lions,
  the Imperial bodyguard clothed in white and armed with silver hatchets.</p>

  <p>A grim coronation was that of Nicolas in 1826; a revolt had broken out in
  the capital and the Czar had narrowly escaped assassination; there were, in
  consequence, no festivities, a reign of terror set in, and when the Emperor
  left the Cathedral of the Assumption, robed and crowned, "his face looked as
  hard as Siberian ice and the people were too frightened to cheer, they
  dropped on their knees, with their faces in the dust."</p>

  <p>Many of the places that we have briefly considered will never again, it
  seems, see "the crowning of the King." This fact makes even more impressive
  the continuity of our own royal line and gives an added importance to the
  approaching ceremonial in Westminster Abbey, when the King Emperor will
  receive his diadem from the altar that is the Shrine of St. Edward, who
  founded this church for the inauguration of the Sovereigns of England into
  their sacred office. Many high virtues, faith, mercy, justice, piety,
  loyalty, reverence, are honoured in the symbolism attendant on a coronation
  that is so much more than a remarkable pageant. In setting up a chosen and
  anointed King, a nation sets up its own ideals of strength, compassion,
  dignity and spirituality.</p>

  <p>The coronation of George VI will have a unique significance in that the
  Sovereign is the head of a great commonwealth of nations, all of whom,
  whatever their individual governments, recognise and pay homage to the ideals
  of Kingship, which is interpreted to the eye and ear in the ancient and
  beautiful rites that celebrate the installation of the British Sovereign.</p>
