  <h2><a name="ch00"
     id="ch00"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

  <p>It would be an idle but pleasant amusement to wonder how many love letters
  have been written since reading and writing were invented, how many sheets of
  parchment, bark, papyrus, paper have been covered, and with how many millions
  of amorous words!</p>

  <p>What survives must be a very small proportion of this vast output;
  probably the strangest and most beautiful love letters were those never seen
  save by the person to whom they were written and are long since dust; it is
  likely enough that hundreds of thousands of love letters lie at this moment
  folded away carefully in private possession&mdash;letters that would vie, for
  interest and charm, with any that have survived time and chance and any that
  have been published.</p>

  <p>We have, however, to make an arbitrary selection; we have only those
  letters that have survived time and chance and those that have been published
  because the writers were famous people. It does not follow that they were the
  best writers of love letters; some man or woman quite forgotten may have
  written a more perfect letter than any that we possess. We are forced to
  content ourselves with what has been, often by the strangest chance,
  preserved.</p>

  <p>Love letters by their very nature stand in constant danger of destruction;
  they may be perilous possessions, and that frequent injunction "burn this"
  has too often been obeyed, or, treasured for a lifetime, they may be tenderly
  destroyed lest they should fall into unsympathetic hands; or, if they are not
  sacrificed to fear or affection, they may be to indifference, and cast into
  the fire or on to the rubbish-heap by those to whom they are so much lumber.
  On the other hand, indifference may be the cause of the preservation of love
  letters; the Comte de Guibert put aside the packet from Julie de Lespinasse
  and presumably forgot it; after his death his widow found and published this
  famous correspondence; until then this love story, since so famous, was
  unknown. We owe the possession of Henry VIII's love letters to the skill of a
  Vatican spy who stole them; those of Mary II, left with other papers in a
  chest, were found by accident many years after her death.</p>

  <p>The letters of Mary Wollstonecraft have a strange history; after her
  separation from her lover he returned most of her letters two years
  afterwards, and William Godwin, her husband, published them. Horace Walpole
  carefully concealed the strange love letters of Madame du Deffand, but did
  not destroy them, and they were found among his papers and published.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, some love letters have been most jealously cherished;
  Lady Steele kept all those that her husband wrote to her, and their daughter
  edited them; professional writers were always likely, not only to give
  literary flavour even to their intimate correspondence but to see that it was
  preserved; it would not be fair, however, to think that the love letters of
  poets and novelists were written with one eye on the public; most of them
  indeed were written under circumstances that precluded any affectation,
  thought of the future or literary finish.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, since the illiterate cannot write, our love letters
  must be those of at least partly educated people, and the finest letters are
  undoubtedly those of the most gifted, most cultured men and women. This is
  not a case where the pure outpourings of a simple heart can suffice; the text
  "I love you" may be laboured out by the knife of a rustic on the bark of a
  tree, written by a simpleton on a chance scrap of paper&mdash;these three
  words are too universally familiar, they can mean everything or nothing, they
  may express an immortal passion, a pretty convention or a foolish caprice. It
  is the expounding of the text that interests, that enthrals, the manifold,
  delicate variations on this common theme that enthrall and enchant, and the
  more intelligent, complex and refined the person who tries to put his or her
  emotion on paper, the more fascinating the result.</p>

  <p>The vast bulk of available love letters that may justly be termed "famous"
  would take a lifetime to translate and edit; what is offered here is a
  selection&mdash;into which it is impossible to prevent personal taste from
  entering&mdash;of those that have most personal interest and most dramatic
  significance. Variety has also been sought for; in point of period this is
  not easy to find, the letters chosen fall mostly within the seventeenth,
  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>

  <p>Not only were early love letters seldom preserved, one suspects such
  letters were seldom written; the ladies were not very ready with the pen, and
  the men who were minded to pay them homage did so through song and verse, as
  in the notable examples of Dante to Beatrice, Petrarch to Laura, and Michael
  Angelo to Vittoria Colonna.</p>

  <p>There were many difficulties in the way of a successful cultivation of the
  art of love-letter writing when marriages were arranged in early life, when
  women lived secluded, when means of communication were always tiresome and
  often impossible to find.</p>

  <p>The most fortunate of love stories, those where the lovers were early and
  always together, have no need of expression on paper, and in periods of
  violence and lawlessness unfortunate love stories were usually ended brutally
  before there was any opportunity for an amorous correspondence.</p>

  <p>There is another obstacle; not only have we the men expressing themselves
  in impersonal poetry and the women keeping silence, but we have, in the few
  letters that have come down to us, a strange idiom; the language is
  unfamiliar, and, in translating it, half the meaning disappears; the urgency
  of passion or affection, of joy or hate, is lost, the personality behind the
  writing is obscured and the letter becomes a curiosity or a matter of purely
  academic interest. For example, Henry VIII was a scholar and a versifier and
  has been praised as a master of fine English, but what is a modern reader to
  make of his letter to Anne Bullen, entered for sale at Messrs. Christie's but
  withdrawn on December 7, 1936?</p>

  <p>It is here given verbatim in order that the reader may realise for himself
  the difficulties attendant on interpreting and understanding these early
  letters, difficulties much increased if the material is in a foreign
  language; when the scholars have removed the archaic disguise from missives
  such as this, what remains seems but a faint echo of the original
  intention.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Darlyng I hartely recomende me to you assertaynyng now I
  am nott a lytyll perplexed with suche thynge as your brother shall on my part
  Declare Unto you to home I pray you gyffe full credence for it were to longe
  to wryte In my last letters I wrytte to you that I trustyd shortly to se you
  whyche is better knowne att London than with any that is abought me were off
  I not a lytill mervell but take off Dyscrette handelyng must nedes be the
  cause thereoff/ No more to you at thys tyme but that I trust shortly ours
  metyngs shall nott Depend uppon other menys lyght handyllings but uppon your
  owne/ Written with the hand off hys that longyth to be yours Henry."</p>

  <p>In the following century the idiom becomes familiar and with but little
  adjustment can be understood by everyone; in the eighteenth and nineteenth
  centuries letter writing becomes an art, women express themselves as
  elegantly, as profoundly and as passionately as men, and the difficulty
  becomes one of choice.</p>

  <p>There are some letters that could not be omitted from any collection of
  this kind; apart from these and the question of obtaining variety, choice has
  been made of letters written not only by remarkable people, but in remarkable
  circumstances. Our contributors are not all young, handsome or romantic, some
  are middle-aged, ill and plain-featured, others are old, diseased and
  wretched, some write while waiting for a happy marriage, others while
  expecting death on the public scaffold; Dorothy Osborne writes to her future
  husband, Philip von Koenigsmarck to another man's wife, Julie de Lespinasse,
  faded, dying, writes to a faithless lover who has married a young wife,
  Nelson to the woman for whose sake he has sacrificed all, even glory, Emma
  Hart to a young gallant and an old husband.</p>

  <p>The last refinement of ideal married love is seen in the correspondence of
  Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, the extreme of cynic sophistication in
  the letters of Madame du Deffand, the crude arts of an adventuress in Emma
  Hart's coy missives and the agony of an overwhelming physical passion in the
  letters of Lord Nelson and in those of Mary Wollstonecraft, an intellectual
  who had lost her bearings.</p>

  <p>The correspondence of Dean Swift with Vanessa reveals the tortured
  workings of one of the most remarkable minds in English literature, the
  letters to Lady Steele throw a charming light on a happy marriage, those of
  Madame de Bonneval illustrate the fastidious dawn of French romanticism, and
  those of George Sand and Alfred de Musset its fiery noonday. The letters of
  Charles I and Henrietta Maria show the affection and fidelity of a couple at
  first unhappy, afterwards steadfast in misfortune; those of another
  sovereign, Mary II, were written under unique circumstances and by a woman
  whose whole life revolved round her husband's love. The letters of the
  Comtesse de Bonneval were written to a husband who left her ten days after
  her marriage and whom she never met again; the letters of Philip von
  Koenigsmarck and Sophia Dorothea of Zell illustrate one of the most famous of
  illicit romances. Lord Derwentwater's letter is a heroic farewell to earthly
  affection, and those of Saint-Évremond and Ninon de Lenclos show love witty
  and brilliant in old age. The letters of Robert Burns reveal another aspect
  of love, the coquettish, artful woman, the flattered, reluctant man; those of
  Lord Byron are loaded with a theatricality that is none the less a sincere
  expression of the character of the writer.</p>

  <p>The letters have been arranged in chronological order; the sources from
  which they have been obtained, a brief biography of the writer and an account
  of the circumstances under which they were written have been prefixed to each
  section, save in those cases where the letters have been often reprinted and
  are easily accessible. While in some cases there are only one or two letters
  available, in others a selection has had to be made from hundreds; in almost
  every instance the letters have been abridged; some are full of repetitions,
  others contain references to contemporary affairs no longer
  interesting&mdash;for example, those of Madame du Deffand contain complete
  "gazettes" of Parisian news and gossip, which would require copious
  elucidation, and those of Mary II accounts of contemporary English politics
  interesting only to the historian.</p>

  <p>Where the correspondence covers a long period the extracts have been
  arranged in chronological order with a commentary to explain or clarify the
  story that they illustrate; the translations, save where otherwise stated,
  have been made afresh; the recognition of the loss incurred in a change from
  the original language has kept the choice of letters largely to English,
  though French literature offers tempting examples of every type of love
  letter. It is believed that some of the letters, notably those of the
  Comtesse de Bonneval, have not been translated before, or at least are not
  easily available.</p>

  <p>No bibliography is given, as each group of letters is provided with
  references to its source.</p>

  <p>It is notable that we are seldom fortunate enough to have both sides of
  the question in these letters; either the woman or the man is silent, and
  judgment has to go by default; only in a few instances is the correspondence
  complete, with question and reply; this lack not only upsets the emotional
  balance, but often leaves several points in the lovers' drama in doubt. The
  reader must resolve these according to his own taste or wit, as he must find
  his own favourites among these famous epistles, grave and merry, tender and
  tragic, light and gloomy, delicate and crude, written with warm feeling,
  fierce passion or delicate coquetry by hands that long ago were dust.</p>

  <p>The editor's own preference is for the love-making of an English
  husband&mdash;search the world for love letters, none can be found to equal
  in charm, tact, grace and sweet courtesy those written by Sir Richard Steele
  to his wife.</p>

  <p>Grateful acknowledgments are given to His Honour Sir Edward Parry for
  permission to include the letters from Dorothy Osborne to John Murray, for
  permission to use the letters from Elizabeth Barrett Barrett and Robert
  Browning, and to Messrs. Hutchinson for permission to reprint the letters of
  Philip von Koenigsmarck and Sophia Dorothea of Zell.</p>

  <p>It is often difficult and sometimes impossible to discover if material is
  copyright or not and the editor ventures to hope that if anyone's rights have
  been infringed in this collection the matter may be adjusted&mdash;any such
  infringement is made in ignorance and due apologies are offered if, in any
  case, letters that are still personal property have been used.</p>

  These letters cover a period from 1422 to 1509 and were written by different
  members of a Norfolk family of courtiers and scholars. The first is to John

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Henry Tudor was the second son of Henry VII; on the death of his elder
  brother, Arthur, Prince of Wales, Henry was contracted to marry his widowed
  sister-in-law, Catherine of Aragon; he married her on his accession 1509; she
  being six years his senior. This unfortunate princess had been married at
  sixteen years of age to a bridegroom of fifteen and had, on his death, been
  proposed as a wife for her father-in-law, Henry VII (1503); she was upright,
  pious, an excellent Latin scholar and had considerable ability. Julius II
  granted a papal dispensation for her second marriage, she bore and lost four
  children, was Regent in the King's absence during the campaign in France and
  bore a daughter, Mary, afterwards Queen of England, in 1516. Henry VIII was
  neither a kind nor a faithful husband, and was probably really troubled by
  doubts as to the validity of his marriage. Elizabeth Blount became his
  mistress and gave him a son, 1519, whom he afterwards created Duke of
  Richmond. The King probably was first attracted by Anne Boleyn (1507-36) in
  1522 when she returned from France, where she had been in attendance on his
  sister Mary, second Queen of Louis XII. Anne was a daughter of Sir Thomas
  Bullen&mdash;afterwards Boleyn&mdash;a county gentleman of good birth; she
  was dark, vivacious, accomplished, unscrupulous and wanton. Her sister Mary
  was the King's mistress, and Anne took her place after 1529, it being
  understood that Henry was to marry her after his divorce had been obtained.
  These proceedings shook Europe from 1526, when Henry began to agitate for
  relief from his wife, until 1533, when Archbishop Cranmer finally declared
  the marriage null. Anne and Henry were secretly married in the spring of that
  year, the ceremony acknowledged in April, and Anne crowned with unusual pomp
  on Whit-Sunday. In the following September her only child to survive her was
  born; this was Elizabeth, afterwards Queen of England. In three years she
  bore two dead children. Henry tired of her and cast a favourable eye on Jane
  Seymour (1509?-37), daughter of Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall, Savernake.
  Anne, whose conduct had been light and reckless, to say the least, was
  arrested on charges of adultery with several men, among whom was her own
  brother, Viscount Rochford, tried, found guilty and beheaded in the Tower
  1536. The King married Jane Seymour immediately afterwards and she died the
  following year after the birth of her son, the future Edward VI. The
  seventeen love letters written during the divorce proceedings, but undated,
  were stolen by the Papal envoy and remained in the Vatican collection where
  they are now. Some are in English, some in French; they have often been
  translated and published, most recently in <i>Letters of Henry
  VIII,</i>edited by M. Byrne, London, 1906.</p>

  <p>The following versions in modernised spelling and punctuation are from the
  <i>Harleian Miscellany,</i> as is the letter of Henry VIII to Jane Seymour.
  The letters offered nothing of use to the Papal Nuncio, Cardinal Campeggio,
  and have always been considered "wholly to the honour of the King and Anne
  Boleyn," but modern historians make no doubt that she was Henry's
  mistress.</p>

  <p>It is supposed that the letters were sent to Anne when she had withdrawn
  from Court in order to silence gossip and was living in retreat on her
  father's estate; her brother, Lord Rochford, afterwards beheaded for
  intriguing with her, was the intermediary between her and the King; Anne left
  the Court&mdash;she was installed with almost royal honours at Greenwich
  Palace&mdash;in May 1528, and this may be taken as the date of the first
  letter; the sixth is believed to have been written in the September of that
  year, because of the mention of the Legate's visit to Paris. The King
  probably visited Anne soon after he wrote this letter; the last letter is
  tentatively placed in May 1529, after which date Anne returned to Court and
  accompanied the King everywhere during the four years that elapsed before her
  marriage. It is always possible that the letters are not in correct sequence
  but they have always been preserved in this order, in which they are now
  given.</p>

  <p>These practical, almost business-like letters give little indication of
  character. They are expressed in the common lover's idiom of their time and
  show no originality of thought or expression; they do reveal, however, in
  their anxious pleadings, the deep engagement of the writer's passion. The
  letter to Jane Seymour is much quieter in tone and even more conventional in
  expression. The numbers in brackets are those of the letters in the Harleian
  Miscellany.<br>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER I [1]</p>

  <p>MY MISTRESS AND FRIEND, I and my heart put ourselves in your hands,
  begging you to recommend us to your favour, and not to let absence lessen
  your affection to us. For it were a great pity to increase our pain, which
  absence alone does sufficiently, and more than I could ever have thought;
  bringing to my mind a point of astronomy, which is, That the farther the
  Moors are from us, the farther too is the sun, and yet his heat is the more
  scorching; so it is with our love, we are at a distance from one another, and
  yet it keeps its fervency, at least on my side. I hope the like on your part,
  assuring you that the uneasiness of absence is already too severe for me; and
  when I think of the continuance of that which I must of necessity suffer, it
  would seem intolerable to me, were it not for the firm hope I have of your
  unchangeable affection for me; and now, to put you sometimes in mind of it,
  and seeing I cannot be present in person with you, I send you the nearest
  thing to that possible, that is, my picture set in bracelets, with the whole
  device, which you know already, wishing myself in their place, when it shall
  please you. This from the hand of</p>

  <p>TO MY MISTRESS,<br>
  <br>
  Because the time seems to me very long, since I have heard from you, or
  concerning your health; the great affection I have for you has obliged me to
  send this bearer to be better informed, both of your health and pleasure,
  particularly because, since my last parting with you, I have been told, that
  you have entirely changed the opinion in which I left you, and that you would
  neither come to court with your mother, nor any other way; which report, if
  true, I cannot enough wonder at, being persuaded in my own mind, that I have
  never committed any offence against you; and it seems a very small return for
  the great love I bear you, to be kept at a distance from the person and
  presence of a woman in the world that I value the most; and, if you love me
  with as much affection as I hope you do, I am sure, the distance of our two
  persons would be a little uneasy to you. Though this does not belong so much
  to the mistress as the servant. Consider well, my mistress, how greatly your
  absence grieves me; I hope it is not your will that it should be so; but, if
  I heard for certain, that you yourself desired it, I could do no other than
  complain of my ill fortune, and by degrees abate my great folly; and so, for
  want of time, I make an end of my rude letter, desiring you to give credit to
  this bearer in all he will tell you from me. Written by the hand of your in

  <p>By turning over in my thoughts the contents of your last letters, I have
  put myself into a great agony, not knowing how to understand them, whether to
  my disadvantage as I understand them, whether to my disadvantage as I
  understood some others, or not; I beseech you now, with the greatest
  earnestness, to let me know your whole intention, as to the love between us
  two. For I must of necessity obtain this answer of you, having been above a
  whole year struck with the dart of love, and not yet sure whether I shall
  fail, or find a place in your heart and affection. This uncertainty has
  hindered me of late from naming you my mistress, since you only love me with
  an ordinary affection; but if you please to do the duty of a true and loyal
  mistress, and to give up yourself, body and heart, to me, who will be, as I
  have been your most loyal servant (if your rigour does not forbid me) I
  promise you that not only the name shall be given you, but also that I will
  take you for my mistress, casting off all others that are in competition with
  you, out of my thoughts and affection, and serving you only. I beg you to
  give an in tire answer to this my rude letter, that I may know on what and
  how far I may depend. But if it does not please you to answer me in writing,
  let me know some place where I may have it by word of mouth, and I will go
  thither with all my heart. No more for fear of tiring you. Written by the

  judge what an effect the presence of that person must have on me, whose

  mistress, to tell your father from me, that I desire him to hasten the
  appointment by two days, that he may be in court before the old term, or at

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>The life of this unhappy Queen has been given under that of her husband.
  Her married life was embittered by jealousy; the King rudely bade
  her&mdash;"Shut her eyes as her betters had done" and soon sought for an
  excuse to be rid of her; her reckless coquetting afforded him an easy
  opportunity, he had taken a violent fancy for Jane Seymour and he was alarmed
  by his Queen's two still-born boys. The downfall of Anne was accomplished
  with brutal and cynical rapidity. On May Day, 1536, she played at a
  Tournament and gaily cast her handkerchief to one of her lords; at this the
  King left the spectacle suddenly. The following day Anne, her brother and
  several men alleged to be her lovers were arrested. Anne was brought to trial
  before the Peers; her marriage was declared invalid on May 17; on May 19 she
  was beheaded in the Tower precincts by a French swordsman especially fetched
  for the purpose. The body was placed in an old chest used formerly for
  holding arrows, and buried in the Chapel of St. Peter's-inChains in the
  Tower.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that her daughter, Queen Elizabeth, paid no honour to her
  memory and did not re-inter her dishonoured bones among the sovereigns at
  Westminster.</p>

  <p>This remarkable letter is the best thing we know about "Nan, Tom Bullen's
  girl"; considering the horrible circumstances under which it was written it
  shows ability, dignity, courage and great accomplishment. Whether it had also
  that 'ring of truth' which is so difficult to discern each reader must decide
  for himself. At least the care of the doomed woman for her child and her
  fellow-prisoners does her honour; the question of her technical 'guilt' is
  still in debate, there can be no question that this gay, reckless,
  fascinating creature, not thirty years old, was judicially murdered, through
  the exercise of a brutal tyranny.</p>

  <p class="lhdi">Anne Boleyn's Last Letter to King Henry</p>

  <p>SIR,</p>

  <p>Your grace's displeasure, and my imprisonment, are things so strange unto
  me, as what to write, or what to excuse, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas
  you send unto me (willing me to confess a truth, and so obtain your favour)
  by such an one whom you know to be mine antient professed enemy; I no sooner
  received this message by him, than I rightly conceived your meaning, and if,
  as you say, Confessing a truth indeed may procure my safety, I shall with all
  willingness and duty perform your command.</p>

  <p>But let not your grace ever imagine that your poor wife will ever be
  brought to acknowledge a fault, where not so much a thought thereof preceded.
  And to speak a truth, never prince had wife more loyal in all duty, and in
  all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn, with which name
  and place I could willingly have contented myself, if God and your grace's
  pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time so far forget myself
  in my exaltation, or received queenship, but that I always looked for such an
  alteration as now I find; for the ground of my preferment being on no surer
  foundation than your grace's fancy, the least alteration, I knew, was fit and
  sufficient to draw that fancy to some other subject. You have chosen me from
  a low estate to be your queen and companion, far beyond my desert or desire.
  If then, you found me worthy of such honour, good your grace let not any
  light fancy, or bad counsel of mine enemies, withdraw your princely favour
  from me; neither let that stain, that unworthy stain of a disloyal heart,
  towards your good grace, ever cast so foul a blot on your most dutiful wife,
  and the infant princess, your daughter; try me, good king, but let me have a
  lawful trial, and let not my sworn enemies sit as my accusers and judges;
  yea, let me receive an open trial, for my truth shall fear no open shame;
  then shall you see, either mine innocency cleared, your suspicion and
  conscience satisfied, the ignominy and slander of the world stopped, or my
  guilt openly declared. So that, whatsoever God or you may determine of me,
  your grace may be freed from an open censure; and mine offence being so
  lawfully proved, your grace is at liberty, both before God and man, not only
  to execute worthy punishment on me as an unlawful wife, but to follow your
  affection already settled on that party, for whose sake I am now as I am,
  whose name I could some good while since have pointed unto; your grace being
  not ignorant of my suspicion therein.</p>

  <p>But, if you have already determined of me, and that only my death, but an
  infamous slander must bring you the enjoying of your desired happiness; then
  I desire of God, that he will pardon your great sin therein, and likewise
  mine enemies, the instruments thereof; and that he will not call you to a
  strict account for your unprincely and cruel usage of me, at his general
  judgment-seat, where both you and myself must shortly appear, and in whose
  judgment, I doubt not (whatsoever the world may think of me), mine innocence
  shall be openly known, and sufficiently cleared.</p>

  <p>My last and only request shall be, that myself may only bear the burden of
  your grace's displeasure, and that it may not touch the innocent souls of
  those poor gentlemen, who, as I understand, are likewise in strait
  imprisonment for my sake. If ever I have found favour in your sight; if ever
  the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleasing in your ears, then let me obtain
  this request, and I will so leave to trouble your grace any further, with
  mine earnest prayers to the Trinity to have your grace in his good keeping,
  and to direct you in all your actions. From my doleful prison in the Tower,
  this sixth of May.</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>The second Earl of Essex was the oldest son of the first 1 Earl and became
  a favourite of Queen Elizabeth in 1589, when he was made Master of the Horse.
  Two years later he married Frances, widow of Sir Philip Sidney, but retained
  the warm, if capricious friendship of the Queen. Lord Essex was handsome,
  brilliant, a poet, a soldier, a courtier, but ambitious, restless and far
  from level-headed. He brought his reckless playing with the Queen's caprice
  to a climax, when he engaged in a plot to raise the citizens of London and
  force Elizabeth to dismiss her councillors. It was impossible for the Queen
  to pardon this and Essex was beheaded within the Tower of
  London&mdash;February, 1601. The story that he sent a ring to the Queen as a
  plea for pardon and that this was withheld by Lady Nottingham is fiction, but
  there is no doubt that Elizabeth, then old, sick and embittered, was deeply
  affected by the death of Essex, whom she survived two years. Essex was a
  minor poet and patron of literature and the following letter is an admirable
  example of courtly compliment couched in the tones of gallantry.<br>

  <p>To the most loving wife alive, I commend me unto her, and desire God to
  bless her with all happiness, pray for her dead husband, and be of good
  comfort, for I hope in Jesus Christ this morning to see the face of my Maker
  and Redeemer in the most joyful throne of His glorious kingdom. Commend me to
  all my friends, and desire them to pray for me, and in all charity to pardon
  me, if I have offended them. Commend me to my siX sisters, poor desolate
  souls, advise them to serve God, for without Him no goodness is to be
  expected. Were it possible, my little sister Bab, the darling of my race,
  might be bred by her, God would reward her; but I do her wrong I confess,
  that hath by my desolate negligence too little for herself, to add a further
  charge unto her. Dear wife forgive me, that have by these means so much
  impoverished her fortunes; patience and pardon, good wife I crave&mdash;make
  of these our necessities a virtue, and lay no further burthen on my neck than
  hath already been. There be certain debts that I owe, and because I know not
  the order of the law, piteous it hath taken from me all, forfeited by my
  course of offence to Her Majesty, I cannot advise thee to benefit me herein,
  but if there fall out wherewithal, let them be discharged for God's sake. I
  will not that you trouble yourself with the performance of these matters, my
  own heart, but make it known to my uncles, and desire them, for the honour of
  God and ease of their soul, to take care of them as they may, and especially
  care of my sisters' bringing up the burthen is now laid on them. Now,
  Sweet-cheek, what is left to bestow on thee? A small jointure, a small
  recompense for thy deserving, these legacies following to be thine own. God
  of His infinite goodness give thee grace always to remain His true and
  faithful servant, that through the merits of His bitter and blessed passion
  thou mayst become in good time of His kingdom with the blessed women in
  heaven. May the Holy Ghost comfort thee with all necessaries for the wealth
  of thy soul in the world to come, where until it shall please Almighty God I
  meet thee, farewell loving wife, farewell the dearest to me on all the earth,
  farewell!<br>
  <br>
  By the hand from the heart of thy most faithful loving husband,<br>

  <p>This lady was the daughter of Charles Stewart, Earl of Lennox, younger
  brother of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, husband of Mary Queen of Scots; her
  misfortune was that she was next heir to the English throne after James I.
  That monarch regarded her with a suspicion that was greatly increased by her
  secret marriage 1610 to William Seymour, who was also of royal descent.
  Arabella was confined in the Tower, under the pretext that she had married
  without royal consent. This extreme cruelty broke her heart and she died in
  prison after five years of captivity.<br>

  <p class="lhdi">Lady Arabella Stewart to William Seymour</p>

  <p>SIR, I am exceeding sorry to hear you have not been well. I pray you let
  me know truly how you do, and what was the cause of it. I am not satisfied
  with the reason Smith gives for it, but if it be a cold, I will impute it to
  some sympathy betwixt us, having myself gotten a swollen cheek at the same
  time with a cold. For God's sake, let not your grief of mind work upon your
  body. You may see by me what inconveniences it will bring one to; and no
  fortune, I assure you, daunts me so much as that weakness of body I find in
  myself! for, <i>si nous vivons l'âge d'un veau</i>, as Marot says, we may by
  God's grace, be happier than we look for, in being suffered to enjoy ourself
  with His Majesty's favour. But if we be not able to live to it, I, for my
  part, shall think myself a pattern of misfortune in enjoying so great
  blessing as you, so little awhile. No separation but that deprives me of the
  comfort of you. For wheresoever you be, or in what state soever you are, it
  sufficeth me you are mine! Rachel wept and would not be comforted, because
  her children were no more. And that, indeed, is the remediless sorrow, and
  none else! And therefore God bless us from that, and I will hope well of the
  rest, though I see no apparent hope. But I am sure God's book mentioneth many
  of his children in as great distress that have done well after, even in this
  world! I do assure you nothing the state can do with me can trouble me so
  much as this news of your being ill doth; and you see when I am troubled, I
  trouble you too with tedious kindness; for so I think you will account so
  long a letter, yourself not having written to me this good while so much as
  how you do. But, sweet sir, I speak not this to trouble you with writing but
  when you please. Be well, and I shall account myself happy in being<br>
  <br>
  Your faithful loving wife,<br>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>The most beautiful letter was written on the eve of his execution by one
  of the most brilliant and famous of Elizabethans and Englishmen. Walter
  Raleigh was the son of a Devonshire gentleman and was educated at Oriel
  College, Oxford. His first 'voyage of discovery' was undertaken with his half
  brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, in 1578. His glorious career, packed with
  adventure, excitement and enterprises of every kind, was successful until the
  accession of James I, who imprisoned him in the Tower under a charge of high
  treason, 1603. He lived with some ease in the Bloody Tower and was allowed
  the company of his wife and daughter for thirteen years until his friends,
  among whom was the young Henry, Prince of Wales, persuaded the King to allow
  him to go to the Orinoco in search of gold for the royal treasury. Raleigh,
  his wife and a company of gentlemen adventurers found the money for this
  desperate venture, which was a complete failure. On Raleigh's return the
  Spanish Ambassador in London complained of the burning of the Spanish
  settlement of San Tomas by one of Raleigh's Commanders, Laurence Kemys, and
  James I, irritated by the disaster of the voyage, ordered the re-arrest of
  Raleigh on the old charge. He was beheaded in Westminster Palace Yard October
  29, 1618, and buried in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster. His wife was
  Elizabeth Throgmorton, whom he married in 1593 to the great vexation of Queen
  Elizabeth. Of his large output of poetry only about thirty short pieces
  survive; he wrote accounts of his travels, many essays and a "History of the
  World" (to 130 B.C.), during his imprisonment.<br>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhdi">Sir Walter Raleigh to his Wife</p>

  <p>You shall now receive, my dear wife, my last words, in these my last
  lines, my love I send you, that you may keep it when I am dead, and my
  counsel that you may remember it when I am no more. I would not by my will
  present you with sorrows, dear Bess. Let them go into the grave with me, and
  be buried in the dust. And seeing it is not the will of God that I shall see
  you any more in this life, bear it patiently, and with a heart like
  thyself.</p>

  <p>First, I send you all the thanks which my heart can conceive or my words
  can express for your many travails and care taken for me, which, though they
  have not taken effect, as you wished, yet my debt to you is not the less; but
  pay it I never shall in this world.</p>

  <p>Secondly, I beseech you, for the love you bare me living, do not hide
  yourself many days after my death, but by your travails seek to help your
  miserable fortunes, and the right of your poor child. Thy mournings cannot
  avail me, I am but dust.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, you shall understand that my land was conveyed <i>bonâ-fide</i>
  to my child. The writings were drawn at Midsummer twelve months, my honest
  Cousin Brett can testify so much, and Dalberrie, too, can remember somewhat
  therein. And I trust my blood will quench their malice that have thus cruelly
  murthered me; and that they will not seek also to kill thee and thine with
  extreme poverty.</p>

  <p>To what friend to direct thee, I know not, for all mine have left me in
  the true time of trial; and I plainly perceive that my death was determined
  from the first day.</p>

  <p>Most sorry I am, God knows, that being thus surprised with death, I can
  leave you in no better state. God is my witness, I meant you all my office of
  wines, or all that I could have purchased by selling it, half my stuff, and
  all my jewels; but some on't for the boy. But God hath prevented all my
  resolutions, and even that great God that ruleth all in all. But if you can
  live free from want, care for no more; the rest is but vanity.</p>

  <p>Love God, and begin betimes, to repose yourself on Him, and therein shall
  you find true and lasting riches, and endless comfort. For the rest, when you
  have travailled and wearied all your thoughts over all sorts of worldly
  cogitations, you shall but sit down by sorrow in the end.</p>

  <p>Teach your son also to love and fear God whilst he is yet young, that the
  fear of God may grow up with him; and the same God will be a husband to you,
  and a father to him, husband and a father which cannot be taken from you.</p>

  <p>Baylie oweth me £200 and Adrian Gilbert £600. In Jersey, I have also much
  money owing me, besides the arrears of the Wines will pay my debts. And
  howsoever you do, for my soul's sake, pay all poor men.</p>

  <p>When I am gone, no doubt you shall be sought by many; for the world thinks
  that I was very rich. But take heed of the pretences of men, and their
  affections; for they last not but in honest, and worthy men; and no greater
  misery can befall you in this life than to become a prey, and afterwards to
  be despised. I speak not this, God knows, to dissuade you from marriage, for
  it will be best for you, both in respect of the world and of God.</p>

  <p>As for me, I am no more yours, nor you mine. Death hath cut us asunder;
  and God hath divided me from the world, and you from me.</p>

  <p>Remember your poor child, for his father's sake, who chose you, and loved
  you in his happiest times.</p>

  <p>Get those Letters (if it be possible) which I wrote to the Lords, wherein
  I sued for my life. God is my witness, it was for you and yours I desired
  life. But it is true that I disdain myself for begging it; for know it, dear
  wife, that your son is the son of a true man, and one, who in his own
  respect, despiseth death and all his misshapen and ugly shapes.</p>

  <p>I cannot write much. God knows how hardly I steal this time, while others
  sleep; and it is also high time that I should separate my thoughts from the
  world.</p>

  <p>Beg my dead body, which living was denied thee; and either lay it at
  Shirbourne (if the land continue) or in Exeter Church by my Father and
  Mother.</p>

  <p>I can say no more, time and death call me away.</p>

  <p>The everlasting, powerful, infinite and omnipotent God, that Almighty God
  who is goodness itself, the true life, and true light, keep thee, and thine;
  have mercy on me, and teach me to forgive my persecutors and accusers, and
  send us to meet in His glorious kingdom.</p>

  <p>My dear wife, farewell. Bless my poor boy, pray for me, and let my good
  God, hold you both in His arms.</p>

  <p>Written with the dying hand of sometime thy Husband but now (alas)
  overthrown.</p>

  <p>WA. RALEIGH</p>

  <p>Yours that was, but now not my own.<br>

  <p>This letter was written by the King to his wife, after he had been forced
  to sign the Covenant, after his surrender to the Scots at Newark, 1646, in
  the fourth year of the Civil War. Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry IV and
  Marie de' Medici, was the loyal helpmate and devoted ally of the King, all
  her considerable energies and resources were used in his cause, and, after
  his death in 1649, she turned them to the service of her sons and lived to
  see the elder, Charles II, restored to the throne of Great Britain in 1660.
  At the date at which this letter was written the Queen was actively engaged
  in trying to raise an army from the Duke of Lorraine and in obtaining money
  by pledging her jewels with Cardinal Mazarin. She retired into a Carmelite
  nunnery and died at Colombes, France, 1669.<br>

  <p>NEWCASTLE, 10 June, 1646.</p>

  <p>These two last weeks I heard not from thee, nor any about thee, which hath
  made my present condition the more troublesome, but I expect daily the
  contentment of hearing from thee. Indeed I have need of some comfort, for I
  never knew what it was to be barbarously baited before, and these five or six
  days last have much surpassed, in rude pressures against my conscience, all
  the rest since I came to the Scotch army; for, upon I know not what
  intelligence from London, nothing must serve but my signing the covenant (the
  last was, my commanding all my subjects to do it), declaring absolutely, and
  without reserve, for Presbyterian government, and my receiving the Directory
  in my family, with an absolute command for the rest of the kingdom; and if I
  did not all this, then a present agreement must be made with the parliament,
  without regard of me, for they said that otherways they could not hope for
  peace or a just war. It is true they gave me many other fair promises in case
  I did what they desired (and yet for the militia they daily give ground); but
  I answered them, that what they demanded was absolutely against my
  conscience, which might be persuaded, but would not be forced by anything
  they could speak or do. This was the sum of divers debates and papers between
  us, of which I cannot now give thee an account. At least I made them be
  content with another message to London requiring an answer to my former with
  an offer to go thither upon honourable and fast conditions. Thus all I can do
  is but delaying of ill, which I shall not be able to do long without
  assistance from thee. I cannot but again remind thee, that there was never
  man so alone as I, and therefore very much to be excused for the mentioning
  of any error, because I have reason to suspect everything that they advised
  me, and to distrust mine own single opinion, having no living soul to help
  me. To conclude, all the comfort I have is in thy love and a clear
  conscience. I know the first will not fail me, nor (by the Grace of God) the
  other. Only I desire thy particular help, that I should be as little vexed as
  may be; for if thou do not, I care not much for others. I need say no more of
  this, nor will at this time, but that I am eternally thine.</p>

  <p>This delightful Englishwoman was the daughter of Sir Peter Osborne, a
  cavalier gentleman who lived at Chick-sands, Bedfordshire, and at one time
  commanded the Royalist forces in Guernsey. At the age of twenty-one she
  became betrothed to William Temple, who was one year her junior; but there
  were many difficulties in the way of their marriage and it was nearly seven
  years before it took place. During this period the lovers frequently
  corresponded and Dorothy's letters are preserved, though Temple's have been
  lost. They have long since been considered among the most charming in any
  language. Dorothy Osborne became the wife of William Temple on Christmas Day,
  1654. The marriage was happy and Lady Temple lived to see her brilliant
  husband honoured and successful. Tragedy touched her in the sad death of her
  eldest son in 1689 and six years later she died herself, largely, it is said,
  from grief at the death of Mary II, one of her most intimate friends; she was
  then in her sixty-seventh year and had had forty years of married happiness.
  The following letters are but specimens of the delicate and gracious style of
  Dorothy Osborne; they are reprinted here by the deeply appreciated permission

  <p class="lhd">LETTER I [19]</p>

  <p class="pin">Dorothy Osborne to Sir William Temple</p>

  <p>SIR,</p>

  <p>I have been reckoning up how many faults you lay to my charge in your last
  letter, and I find I am severe, unjust, unmerciful, and unkind. Oh me, how
  should one do to mend all these! 'Tis work for an age, and 'tis to be feared
  I shall be so old before I am good, that 'twill not be considerable to
  anybody but myself whether I am so or not. I say nothing of the pretty humour
  you fancied me in, in your dream, because 'twas but a dream. Sure, if it had
  been anything else, I should have remembered that my Lord L. loves to have
  his chamber and his bed to himself. But seriously, now, I wonder at your
  patience. How could you hear me talk so senselessly, though 'twere but in
  your sleep, and not to be ready to beat me? What nice mistaken points of
  honour I pretend to, and yet could allow him a room in the same bed with me!
  Well, dreams are pleasant things to people whose humours are so; but to have
  the spleen, and to dream upon't, is a punishment I would not wish my greatest
  enemy. I seldom dream, or never remember them, unless they have been so sad
  as to put me into such disorder as I can hardly recover when I am awake, and
  some of those I am confident I shall never forget.</p>

  <p>You ask me how I pass my time here. I can give you a perfect account not
  only of what I do for the present, but of what I am likely to do this seven
  years if I stay here so long. I rise in the morning reasonably early, and
  before I am ready I go round the house till I am weary of that, and then into
  the garden till it grows too hot for me. About ten o'clock I think of making
  me ready, and when that's done I go into my father's chamber, from thence to
  dinner, where my cousin Molle and I sit in great state in a room and at a
  table that would hold a great many more. After dinner we sit and talk till
  Mr. B. comes in question, and then I am gone. The heat of the day is spent in
  reading or working, and about six or seven o'clock I walk out into a common
  that lies hard by the house, where a great many young wenches keep sheep and
  cows, and sit in the shade singing of ballads. I go to them and compare their
  voices and beauties to some ancient shepherdesses that I have read of, and
  find a vast difference there; but, trust me I think these are as innocent as
  those could be. I talk to them, and find they want nothing to make them the
  happiest people in the world but the knowledge that they are so. Most
  commonly, when we are in the midst of our discourse, one looks about her, and
  spies her cows going into the corn, and then away they all run as if they had
  wings at their heels. I, that am not so nimble, stay behind; and when I see
  them driving home their cattle, I think 'tis time for me to retire too. When
  I have supped, I go into the garden, and so to the side of a small river that
  runs by it, where I sit down and wish you with me (you had best say this is
  not kind neither). In earnest, 'tis a pleasant place, and would be much more
  so to me if I had your company. I sit there sometimes till I am lost with
  thinking; and were it not for some cruel thoughts of the crossness of our
  fortunes that will not let me sleep there, I should forget that there were
  such a thing to be done as going to bed.</p>

  <p>Since I writ this my company is increased by two, my brother Harry and a
  fair niece, the eldest of my brother Peyton's daughters. She is so much a
  woman that I am almost ashamed to say I am her aunt; and so pretty, that if I
  had any design to gain a servant, I should not like her company; but I have
  none, and therefore shall endeavour to keep her here as long as I can
  persuade her father to spare her, for she will easily consent to it, having
  so much of my humour (though it be the worst thing in her) as to like a
  melancholy place and little company. My brother John is not come down again,
  nor am I certain when he will be here. He went from London into
  Gloucestershire to my sister who was very ill, and his youngest girl, of
  which he was very fond, is since dead. But I believe by that time his wife
  has a little recovered her sickness and the loss of her child, he will be
  coming this way. My father is reasonably well, but keeps his chamber still,
  and will hardly, I am afraid, ever be so perfectly recovered as to come
  abroad again.</p>

  <p>I am sorry for poor Walker, but you need not doubt of what he has of yours
  in his hands, for it seems he does not use to do his work himself. I speak
  seriously, he keeps a Frenchman that sets all his seals and rings. If what
  you say of my Lady Leppington be of your own knowledge, I shall believe you,
  but otherwise I can assure you I have heard from people that pretend to know
  her very well, that her kindness to Compton was very moderate, and that she
  never liked him so well as when he died and gave her his estate. But they
  might be deceived, and 'tis not so strange as that you should imagine a
  coldness and an indifference in my letters where I so little meant it; but I
  am not displeased you should desire my kindness enough to apprehend the loss
  of it when it is safest. Only I would not have you apprehend it so far as to
  believe it possible&mdash;that were an injury to all the assurances I have
  given you, and if you love me you cannot think me unworthy. I should think
  myself so, if I found you grew indifferent to me, that I have had so long and
  so particular a friendship for; but, sure, this is more than I need to say.
  You are enough in my heart to know all my thoughts, and if so, you know
  better than I can tell you how much I am</p>

  <p>Yours,</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II [30]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Undated. Assumed date Sunday, July 24, 1653.</p>

  <p>SIR,</p>

  <p>In my opinion you do not understand the laws of friendship right. 'Tis
  generally believed it owes its birth to an agreement and conformity of
  humours, and that it lives no longer than 'tis preserved by the mutual care
  of those that bred it. 'Tis wholly governed by equality, and can there be
  such a thing in it, as a distinction of power? No, sure, if we are friends we
  must both command and both obey alike, indeed a mistress and a servant sounds
  otherwise, but, that is ceremony and this is truth. Yet what reason had I to
  furnish you with a stick to beat myself withal, or desire that you should
  command, that do it so severely? I must eat fruit no longer than I could be
  content you should be in a fever;&mdash;is not that an absolute forbidding it
  me? It has frighted me just now from a basket of the most tempting cherries*
  that e'er I saw; though I know you did not mean I should eat none, but if you
  had I think I should have obeyed you. I am glad you lay no fault to my charge
  but indiscretion, though that be too much, 'tis a well-natured one in me. I
  confess it is a fault to believe too easily, but 'tis not out of vanity that
  I do it&mdash;as thinking I deserve you should love me and therefore
  believing it&mdash;but because I am apt to think people so honest as to speak
  as they mean, and the less I deserve it the more I think myself obliged. I
  know 'tis a fault in anyone to be mastered by a passion, and of all passions
  love is perhaps the least pardonable in a woman; but when 'tis mingled with
  gratitude 'tis sure the less to be blamed.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The "basket of tempting cherries" shows this was
  written in the summer, and the reference to the "Emperor" and the discourse
  on friendship place it in 1653. Readers of Sir William Temple's Essays will
  find many references there to the times and reasons for eating or abstaining
  from fruit. Cherries, he says, are to be eaten "without swallowing either
  skin or stone"&mdash;SIR EDWARD PARRY.]</p>

  <p>I do not think if there were more that loved me I should love them all,
  but I am certain I could not love the most perfect person in the world,
  unless I did first firmly believe he had a passion for me. And yet you would
  persuade me I am not just, because I did once in my life deny you something.
  I'll swear you are not, if you do not believe that next the happy end of all
  our wishes, I desire to see you; but you know the inconveniency that will
  certainly follow, and if you can dispense with them I can, to show that my
  obedience is not less than yours.</p>

  <p>I cannot hear too often that you are kind and noble enough to prefer my
  interest above your own, but, sure if I have any measure of either myself,
  the more liberty you give me the less I shall take. 'Tis most certain that
  our Emperor would have been to me rather a gaoler than a husband, and 'tis as
  true that (though for my own sake I think I should not make an ill wife to
  anybody) I cannot be a good one to any but one. I know not with what
  constancy you could hear the sentence of your death, but I am certain there
  is nothing I could not hear with more; and if your interest in me be dearer
  to you than your life, it must necessarily follow that 'tis dearer to me than
  anything in the world besides. Therefore you may be sure I will preserve it
  with all my care. I cannot promise that I shall be yours because I know not
  how far my misfortunes may reach, nor what punishments are reserved for my
  fault, but I dare almost promise you shall never receive the displeasure of
  seeing me another's. No, in earnest, I have so many reasons to keep me from
  that, besides your interest, that I know not whether it be not the least of
  the obligations you have to me. Sure the whole world could never persuade me
  (unless a parent commanded it) to marry one that I had no esteem for, and
  where I have any, I am not less scrupulous than your father, or I should
  never be brought to do them the injury as to give them a wife whose
  affections they could never hope for; besides that, I must sacrifice myself
  in't and live a walking misery till the only hope that would then be left me
  were perfected. Oh, me! this is so sad; it has put me out of all I had to say
  besides. I meant to chide you for the shortness of your last letter, and to
  tell you that if you do not take the same liberty of telling me of all my
  faults I shall not think you are my friend. In earnest, 'tis true, you must
  use to tell me freely of anything you see amiss in me; whether I am too
  stately or not enough, what humour pleases you and what does not, what you
  would have me do and what avoid, with the same freedom that you would use to
  a person over whom you had an absolute power, and were concerned in. These
  are the laws of friendship as I understand them, and I believe I understand
  them right, for I am certain no one can be more perfectly a friend than I
  am.</p>

  <p>Yours,</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER III [44]</p>

  <p>Had you the bit of paper I sent you from St. Albans? 'Twas a strange one I
  believe, as my humour was when I writ it. Well here I am, God knows for how
  long or how short a time, nor shall I be able to guess till all our company
  that we expect is come; then as I find their humours I shall resolve. Why did
  not you tell me how ill I looked? All people here will not believe but I have
  been desperately sick. I do not find I am ill though, but I have lost a
  collop that's certain, and now I am come to my own glass I find I have not
  brought down the same face I carried up. But 'tis no matter, 'tis well enough
  for this place.</p>

  <p>I shall hear from you a Thursday, and next week I shall be able to say
  much more than I can this, both because I shall have more time, and besides I
  shall know more. You will send the picture and forget not that you must walk
  no more in the cloisters. No, in earnest, 'tis not good for you, and you must
  be ruled by me in that point. Besides if we do not take care of ourselves, I
  find nobody else will. I would not live, though, if I had not some hope left
  that a little time may breathe great alterations, and that 'tis possible we
  may see an end of our misfortune. When that hope leaves us then 'tis time to
  die, and if I know myself I should need no more to kill me. Let your letter
  be as much too long as this is too short, I shall find by that how I must
  write. I do not think this is sense, nor have I time to look it over.</p>

  <p>I am yours,</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IV [49]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Undated. Assumed date Sunday, December 4, 1653.</p>

  <p>If you have ever loved me, do not refuse the last request I shall ever
  make you; 'tis to preserve yourself from the violence of your passion. Vent
  it all upon me; call me and think me what you please; make me, if it be
  possible, more wretched than I am. I'll bear it all without the least murmur.
  Nay, I deserve it all, for had you never seen me you had certainly been
  happy. 'Tis my misfortunes only that have that infectious quality as to
  strike at the same time me and all that's dear to me. I am the most
  unfortunate woman breathing, but I was never false. No; I call heaven to
  witness that if my life could satisfy for the least injury my fortune has
  done you (I cannot say 'twas I that did them you), I would lay it down with
  greater joy than any person ever received a crown; and if I ever forget what
  I owe you, or ever entertain a thought of kindness for any person in the
  world besides, may I live a long and miserable life. 'Tis the greatest curse
  I can invent; if there be a greater, may I feel it. This is all I can say.
  Tell me if be possible I can do anything for you, and tell me how I may
  deserve your pardon for all the trouble I have given you. I would not die
  without it.</p>

  <p>For Mr. Temple.</p>

  <p>Dear! shall we ever be so happy, think you? Ah! I dare not hope it. Yet
  'tis not want of love gives me these fears. No, in earnest, I think (nay, I
  am sure) I love you more than ever, and 'tis that only gives me these
  despairing thoughts; when I consider how small a proportion of happiness is
  allowed in this world, and how great mine would be in a person for whom I
  have a passionate kindness, and who has the same for me. As it is infinitely
  above what I can deserve, and more than God Almighty usually allots to the
  best people, I can find nothing in reason but seems to be against me; and,
  methinks, 'tis as vain in me to expect it as 'twould be to hope I might be a
  queen (if that were really as desirable a thing as 'tis thought to be); and
  it is just it should be so.</p>

  <p>We complain of this world, and the variety of crosses and afflictions it
  abounds in, and yet for all this who is weary on't (more than in discourse),
  who thinks with pleasure of leaving it, or preparing for the next? We see old
  folks, that have outlived all the comforts of life, desire to continue it,
  and nothing can wean us from the folly of preferring a mortal being, subject
  to great infirmity and unavoidable decays, before an immortal one, and all
  the glories that are promised with it. Is this not very like preaching? Well,
  'tis too good for you; you shall have no more on't.</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Mary Stuart, Princess of Orange, then Queen-regnant of Great Britain, was
  the elder daughter and heiress of James II by his first marriage with Anne
  Hyde, daughter of the Earl of Clarendon. When she was a spoilt, wilful,
  rather hysterical girl of sixteen years, she was married to her first cousin,
  William Prince of Orange-Nassau and Stadtholder of the United Provinces. This
  Prince, then in his twenty-eighth year, was one of the most remarkable men of
  his age, already famous as soldier-statesman and as the linch-pin of the
  European opposition to the encroachments and pretensions of Louis XIV.
  William was austere, stately, absorbed in vast schemes and complicated
  policies, and his marriage was one of ambition as it set him, a grandson of
  Charles I, one step nearer the British throne, and gave him, as the husband
  of the heiress to that throne, a strong position in English home politics,
  which he used persistently to detach England from the French interest. The
  frivolous, ignorant Mary, brought up in the corrupt atmosphere of her uncle's
  court, entered with tears of distress and reluctance into what seemed likely
  to be an unhappy marriage. Within a short time, however, the emotional girl
  fell deeply in love with her husband and soon conceived for him a passion
  approaching idolatry, which blended with her passionate adherence to that
  Protestantism of which her husband was the professed champion.</p>

  <p>During her residence of twelve years in Holland, Mary completely
  identified herself with her husband's aims and ideals, with his country and
  his faith. Her father never paid her an allowance and made continuous
  attempts to ruin her married life by spies and tale-bearers set in her
  household, and Mary became as estranged from him, as she was devoted to her
  husband. We have her word that she was "happier than she knew" in Holland,
  but a deep grief shadowed her entire life; this was the childlessness that
  followed the disappointed hopes of an heir and darkened the first years of
  her marriage. Mary was very handsome, fond of dancing, music and
  needlework&mdash;this to a passion&mdash;but she subdued herself to a quiet
  life of sober domesticity when in Holland, where her noble and lovable
  qualities made her extremely popular. Her private diaries and memoirs show an
  almost fanatic passion for her husband and a Protestant piety amounting to
  bigotry. In the crisis of 1688 Mary made her husband's expedition to England
  possible by letting it be known that she put all her claims second to those
  of her husband; it appears from her private papers that she was sincerely
  convinced that her father had foisted a 'pretender' upon the nation in the
  person of the infant Prince of Wales. She joined William in England in 1689
  and said good-bye to her personal happiness with her reluctant acceptance,
  with William, of the joint sovereignty of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>When James landed in Ireland, William went in person to command his
  forces, and Mary was left to govern a divided unsettled country, torn by plot
  and faction and threatened by foreign invasion. She was, at her own request,
  assisted by a Council, none of the members of which she wholly liked or
  trusted. Her letters contain careful accounts of home affairs, these have
  been omitted and only the personal passages retained. These give a vivid
  picture of the lonely, agitated woman in a difficult, distasteful position,
  surrounded by danger, enemies, spies and lukewarm friends and supported only
  by her intense love for her husband. She had to face the naval defeat off
  Beachy Head and the subsequent landing of the French, risings in the city,
  treachery among her advisers and the constant anxiety lest the news from
  Ireland should be of defeat or the death of husband or father. Without
  experience, education or training, Mary, by common consent, succeeded very
  well in her task, through ability, courage and sincere loyalty.</p>

  <p>Her letters were found, long after her death, in a box known as 'King
  William's Chest'; they were reprinted, the first time by Sir John Dalrymple
  at the end of the eighteenth century. Not a line of William's correspondence
  to his wife remains; she burnt all her papers when she knew that she was
  stricken with small-pox; of this disease she died, aged thirty-two
  years&mdash;after a reign of six years. She always suffered from ill health,
  and agitation and melancholia had undermined her spirits. William displayed
  the most frantic grief at her death and never recovered from the shock of
  this terrible loss. There has recently been presented to the London Museum a
  wallet finely worked in tiny beads that William used during his campaigns; it
  was made by Mary, the most exquisite and industrious of needlewomen, and is
  in excellent preservation&mdash;the design consists of portraits of herself
  and her husband with symbols of separated lovers.<br>

  <p class="cpi">Queen Mary II to King William III</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, June 29/19, 1690.</p>

  <p>You will be weary of seeing every day a letter from me, it may be; yet
  being apt to flatter myself, I will hope you will be as willing to read as I
  to write. And indeed it is the only comfort I have in this world, besides
  that of trust in God. I have nothing to say to you at present that is worth
  writing, and I think it unreasonable to trouble you with my grief, which I
  must continue while you are absent, though I trust every post to hear some
  good news or other from you; therefore, I shall make this very short, and
  only tell you I have got a swell'd face, though not quite so bad yet, as it
  was in Holland five years ago. I believe it came by standing too much at the
  window when I took the waters. I cannot enough thank God for your being so
  well past the dangers of the sea; I beseech him in his mercy still to
  preserve you so, and send us once more a happy meeting upon earth. I long to
  hear again from you how the air of Ireland agrees with you, for I must own I
  am not without my fears for that, loving you so entirely as I do, and shall
  till death.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II</p>

  <p class="cpi">Written on the eve of the defeat off Beachy Head</p>

  <p>The news which is come to-night of the French fleet being upon the coast,
  makes it thought necessary to write you both ways; and I, that you may see
  how matters stand in my heart, prepare a letter for each. I think Lord
  Torrington has made no haste: And I cannot tell whether his being sick, and
  staying for Lord Pembroke's regiment, will be a sufficient excuse; But I will
  not take up your time with my reasonings, I shall only tell you, that I am so
  little afraid, that I begin to fear I have not sense enough to apprehend the
  danger; for whether it threatens Ireland, or this place, to me 'tis much at
  one, as to the fear; for as much a coward as you think me, I fear more for
  your dear person than my poor carcass. I know who is most necessary in the
  world. What I fear most at present is not hearing from you. Love me whatever
  happens, and be assured I am ever entirely yours till death.</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, the 2 July/22 June, 1690, at half 10 at night.</p>

  <p>As I was ready to go into my bed, Lord Nottingham came and brought me a
  letter, of which he is going to give you an account; for my own part, I shall
  say nothing to it, but that I trust God will preserve us, you where you are,
  and poor I here. Methinks Lord Torrington has made no haste; they say he
  stays for Lord Pembroke's regiment; He also has not been very quick, for he
  received it at 8 this evening, and kept it till now, that he has sent it open
  to Lord Nottingham. I thank God I am not much afraid; I think too little;
  which makes me fear it is want of apprehending the danger. That which
  troubles me most in all things is your absence and the fear I am in,
  something may be done to hinder us from hearing from you; in that case I
  don't know what will become of us. I will trust in God who is our only help.
  Farewell, I will trouble you with no more, but only desire you, whatever
  happens, to love me as I shall you to death.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IV</p>

  <p class="cpi">WHITEHALL, July 4/June 24, 1690.</p>

  <p>Since I have writ this, I was called out to Lord Nottingham who brought me
  your dear letter of the 28th/18th, which is so welcome that I cannot express
  it, especially because you pity me, which I like and desire from you, and you
  only. As for the building, I fear there will be many obstacles; for I spoke
  to Sir J. Lowther this very day, and hear so much use for money, and find so
  little, that I cannot tell whether that of Hampton court will not be a little
  the worse for it, especially since the French are in the Channel, and at
  present between Portland and us, from whence the stone must come; but in a
  day or two, I hope to give you a more certain account, this being only my own
  conjecture. God be praised that you are so well, I hope in his mercy he will
  continue it. I have been obliged to write this evening to M. Schulenberg to
  desire him to advance money for the 6 regiments to march, which they say is
  absolutely necessary for your service as well as honour. The lords of the
  treasury have made me pawn my word for it, and that to-morrow 20,000 pounds
  will be paid him. It is now candle-light, and I dare say no more but that I
  am ever and entirely yours.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER V</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, July 8/June 28, 1690.</p>

  <p>Before I went out of the room, I received your dear letter from
  Lough-bricklin, but I cannot express what I then felt, and still feel, at the
  thoughts that now it may be you are ready to give battle, or have done it. My
  heart is ready to burst. I can say nothing, but pray to God for you. This has
  waked me who was almost asleep, and almost puts me out of any possibility of
  saying any more, yet I must strive with my heart to tell you, that this
  afternoon the ill news of the battle of Fleury came; I had a letter from the
  Prince of Waldeck, with a copy of the account he sent you, so that I can say
  nothing, but that God, in whose hands all events only are, knows best why he
  has ordered it so, and to him we must submit. This evening there has been a
  person with me, from whom you heard at Chester (probably Earl of Broadalbin)
  and whom you there ordered to come to me, as he says; he believes you will
  know him by this, and will by no means be named, and, what is worse, will
  name nobody, so that I fear there is not much good to be done, yet I won't
  give over so. I must end my letter, for my eyes are at present in somewhat a
  worse condition than before I received your letter: My impatience for another
  from you is as great as my love, which will not end but with my life, which
  is very uneasy to me at present, but I trust in God, who alone can preserve
  you and comfort me.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[This letter ends the long tension about the possibility
  of a French landing, noted in previous letters, with the news of the Battle

  and courage.]</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, July 13/3, 1690.</p>

  <p>Though by my letter it may be you would not think me so much in pain as I
  am, yet I must tell you I am very much so, but not for what Lord Monmouth
  would have me; he daily tells me of the great dangers we are in, and now has
  a mind to be sent to Holland (of which you will hear either this or the next
  post). I see everyone is inclined to it for a reason I have mentioned before;
  but to let that pass I must tell you again how he endeavours to fright me,
  and indeed things have but a melancholy prospect; but I am fully persuaded
  God will do some great thing or other, and it may be, when human means fail,
  he will show his power; this makes me, that I cannot be so much afraid as it
  may be I have reason for; but that which makes me in pain is fear for what is
  done may not please you. I am sure it is my chief desire, but you know I must
  do what others think fit, and I think they all desire as much as may be to
  act according to your mind. I long to hear from you, and know in what we have
  failed; for my own part, if I do anything what you don't like, 'tis my
  misfortune and not my fault; for I love you more than my life, and desire
  only to please you.</p>

  <p>This is only to tell you I have received yours of the 28th, Old Stile,
  which puts me in many troubles that I shall not trouble you with at present;
  to-morrow night an express shall go to you that cannot possibly be dispatched
  to-night, and I am not sorry; for at this time I dare say but little by
  candle-light, and 'tis to-morrow the fifth Sunday of the month. I have really
  hardly had time to say my prayers, and was feign to run away to Kensington,
  where I had three hours of quiet, which is more than I have had together
  since I saw you. That place made me think how happy I was there, when I had
  your company; but now&mdash;I will say no more, for I shall but hurt my own
  eyes, which I want more now than ever. Adieu; think of me, and love me as
  much as I shall you, who I love more than my life. I should have sent this
  last post; but not seeing Madam Nienhuys, hindered me then, and makes me send
  it to you now, which I hope you excuse.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VIII</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, July 16/6, 1690.</p>

  <p>I can never give God thanks enough as long as I live for your
  preservation; I hope in his mercy this is a sign he preserves you to finish
  the work he has begun by you; but I hope it may be a warning to you, to let
  you see you are exposed to as many accidents as others; and though it has
  pleased God to keep you once in so visible a manner, yet you must forgive me
  if I tell you that I should think it a tempting God to venture again without
  a great necessity; I know what I say of this kind will be attributed to fear;
  I own I have a great deal for your dear person, yet I hope I am not
  unreasonable upon the subject, for I do trust in God, and he is pleased every
  day to confirm me more and more in the confidence I have in him; yet my fears
  are not less, since I cannot tell if it should be his will to suffer you to
  come to harm for our sins, and when that might happen; For though God is
  able, yet many times he punishes the sins of a nation as it seems good in his
  sight. Your writing me word how soon you hoped to send me good news, shows me
  how soon you thought there might be some action, and that thought put me in
  perpetual pain. This morning when I heard the express was come, before Lord
  Nottingham came up, I was taken with a trembling for fear, which has hardly
  left me yet, and I really don't know what I do. Your letter came just before
  I went to chapel; and though the first thing Lord Nottingham told me was,
  that you were very well, yet the thoughts that you expose yourself thus to
  danger, fright me out of my wits, and make me not able to keep my trouble to
  myself: But for God's sake let me beg you to take more care for the time to
  come; consider what depends upon your safety; there are so many more
  important things than myself, that I think I am not worthy naming among them.
  But it may be the worst will be over before this time, so that I will say no
  more. I did not answer your letter by the post last night, because the
  express could not be dispatched; and I believe more hindrances are come, for
  Lord Steward and Lord Pembroke write word they will be here to-night; but I
  can say very little upon the subject at present, for really I had my head and
  heart so full of you, I could mind nothing else.</p>

  <p>It is now past 10 o'clock; I don't tell you for an excuse, for I am not
  sleepy; my impatience is too great to hear from you again, that I am not
  master of it, nor indeed of myself; so that you must excuse me from saying
  more than is just necessary. Lord Nottingham will give you an account of all
  that has been done. Lord Carmarthen will write to you about a thing he has
  put in my head, and since I thought of it, I only fear that, and nothing
  else; I desired he would write it himself, believing what he said would have
  more weight with you than if it came from me, for you would believe I spoke
  most out of self-interest. I wish to God he could prevail. The Lords are come
  back from the fleet, of that I leave also Lord Nottingham to write; but I
  have undertook to say another thing to you, which is about who shall command
  it, for I find every body is so animated against Lord Torrington that 'tis
  not to be imagined; whether you will think fit to confine him after his
  behaviour, I don't know, but all the Lords believe you will not...These are
  all the names I remember, and when I have told them you I think I might as
  well have let it alone; it was only that they thought it better I should put
  you in mind of anybody else; you will please to resolve what shall be done as
  soon as possible; I hope you will forgive me if I forget half what I have to
  say, for really my concern for you has got the mastery, and I am not able to
  think of anything else, but that I love you in more abundance than my own
  life.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IX</p>

  <p class="cpi">Written on hearing the news of the Battle of the Boyne</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, July 17/7, 1690.</p>

  <p>How to begin this letter I don't know, or how ever to render God thanks
  enough for his mercys; indeed, they are too great, if we look on our defects;
  but as you say, 'tis his own cause: And since 'tis for the glory of his great
  name we have no reason to fear but he will perfect what he has begun: For
  myself in particular, my heart is so full of joy and acknowledgment to that
  great God who has preserved you, and given you such a victory, that I am
  unable to explain it. I beseech him to give me grace to be ever sensible, as
  I ought, and that I and all may live suitable to such a mercy as this is. I
  am sorry the fleet has done no better, but 'tis God's providence, and we must
  not murmur, but wait with patience to see the event. I was yesterday out of
  my senses with trouble, I am now almost so with joy, so that I can't really
  as yet tell what I have to say to you, by this bearer, who is impatient to
  return. I hope in God, by the afternoon, to be in a condition of sense enough
  to say much more, but for the present I am not. When I writ the foregoing
  part of this, it was in the morning, soon after I had received yours, and now
  'tis 4 in the afternoon; but I am not yet come to myself, and fear I shall
  lose this opportunity of writing all my mind, for I am still in such a
  confusion of thoughts, that I scarce know what to say, but I hope in God you
  will now readily consent to what Lord President wrote last night, for
  methinks there is nothing more for you to do. I will hasten Kensington as
  much as it's possible, and I will also get ready for you here, for I will
  hope you may come before that is done. I must put you in mind of one thing,
  believing it now the season, which is that you wou'd take care of the church
  in Ireland. Everybody agrees that it is the worst in Christendom: There are
  now bishopricks vacant, and other things, I beg you would take time to
  consider who you will fill them with. You will forgive me that I trouble you
  with this now, but I hope you will take care of those things which are of so
  great consequence as to religion, which I am sure will be more your care
  every day, now that it has pleased God still to bless you with success. I
  think I have told you before how impatient I am to hear how you approve what
  has been done here; I have but little part in it myself, but I long to hear
  how others have pleased you. I am very uneasie in one thing, which is want of
  somebody to speake my mind freely to, for it's a great constraint to think
  and be silent, and there is so much matter that I am one of Solomon's fools,
  who am ready to burst...</p>

  <p>I have writ this at so many times that I fear you will hardly make sense
  of it. I long to hear what you will say to the proposition that will be sent
  you this night by the lords, and do flatter myself mightily with the hopes to
  see you, for which I am more impatient than can be expressed; loving you with
  a passion which cannot end but with my life.</p>

  <p>I wrote to you a Tuesday night by the post, only to show that I would miss
  no opportunity of doing it, and have kept Mr. Gray ever since, having nothing
  worth writing or troubling you with. I shall now begin by answering your
  letter by him and thank God with all my soul for the continuance of your good
  success and hope that you will have no more to do but come back here, where
  you are wish'd for by all that love you or themselves; I need not say most by
  me, it would be a wrong to me to suppose you doubt it. If the first part of
  your letter was extreme welcome, the next was not less so; for next to
  knowing your health and success, that of your being satisfied with what has
  been done here is the best news, and till then I was very much in pain.</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, July 27/17, 1690.</p>

  <p>Every hour makes me more impatient to hear from you, and everything I hear
  stir, I think brings me a letter. I shall not go about to excuse myself; I
  know 'tis a folly to a great degree, to be so uneasy as I am at present, when
  I have no reason to apprehend any ill cause, but only might attribute your
  silence to your marching farther from Dublin, which makes the way longer. I
  have stay'd till I am almost asleep in hopes; but they are vaine, and I must
  once more go to bed, and wish to be waked with a letter from you, which I
  shall at last get, I hope. Till I know whether you come or no, I can not
  resolve to write you all that has past this day, till which time I thought
  you had given me wrong characters of men, but now I see they answer my
  expectation of being as little of a mind as of a body. Adieu, do but love me,
  and I can bear any thing.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XII</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL 1 Aug./22 July, 1690.</p>

  <p>Last night I received your letter from Wels with so much joy, that it was
  seen in my face by those who knew the secret of it that you were coming. I
  will not take up more of your time with endeavouring to tell you what is
  impossible to be express'd; but you know how much I love you, and therefore
  will not doubt of my delight to think that I shall soon see you...I think it
  will be to no purpose to refer the thing by letter to you; You will be here
  yourself before an answer, and I don't know if this long letter will come to
  you; at least I hope 'twill meet you upon the way. After this long letter I
  must tell you, that 'tis impossible for Kensington to be ready for your first
  coming, though I will do my best you shall not stay long for it. When you are
  come I will make my apology for the matter when I see you. I shall now only
  tell you I am in great pain till I know if I have done well in this business
  or no. I am almost half asleep, for 'tis very late. Pardon all my faults, and
  believe I will commit none willingly; and that I love you more than my
  life.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIII</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, Aug 9/July 30 1690.</p>

  <p>You will not wonder that I did not write last night, when you know that at
  noon I received yours, by Mr. Butler, whose face I shall love to see ever
  hereafter, since he has come twice with such good news. That he brought
  yesterday was so welcome to me, that I won't go about expressing it, since
  'tis impossible; But for my misfortune, I have now another reason to be glad
  of your coming, and a very strong one, if compared to anything but the
  kindness I have for your dear self, and that is the divisions which, to my
  thinking, encrease here daily, or at least appear more and more to me...</p>

  <p>Thus the matter is, and thus you will find it, for since you are so near
  coming, I think it will not be proper to do anything that is not absolutely
  necessary, and when you do come, you will then be the best judge of the whole
  matter. I have one thing to beg, which is, that if it be possible, I may come
  and meet you upon the road, either where you dine, or anywhere else, for I do
  so long to see you, that I am sure had you as much mind to see your poor wife
  again, you would propose it; but do as you please; I will say no more, but
  that I love you so much it cannot encrease, else I am sure it would.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIV</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, Aug. 12/2, 1690.</p>

  <p>Unless I could express the joy I had at the thoughts of your coming, it
  will be in vain to undertake telling you of the disappointment 'fis to me
  that you do not come so soon. I begin to be in great pain lest you had been
  in the storm a Thursday night, which I am told was great (though its being a
  t'other side of the house hinder'd my hearing it), but was soon delivered by
  your letters of the 29th from Ch. I confess I deserve such a stop to my joy,
  since may be it was too great, and I not thankful enough to God, and we all
  here apt to be too vain upon so quick a success. But I have mortification
  enough to think your dear person may be again exposed at the passage of the
  Shannon, as it was at that of the Boyne: This is what goes to my heart; but
  yet I see the reasons for it so good, that I will not murmur, for certainly
  your glory would be the greater to terminate the war this summer, and the
  people here much better pleased, than if they must furnish next year for the
  same thing again. Upon these considerations I ought to be satisfied, and I
  will endeavour as much as may be to submit to the will of God and your
  judgment; but you must forgive a poor wife, who loves you so dearly, if I
  can't do it with dry eyes; yet since it has pleased God so wonderfully to
  preserve you all your life, and so miraculously now, I need not doubt but he
  will still preserve you; yet let me beg you not to expose yourself
  unnecessarily, that will be too much tempting that providence which I hope
  will still watch over you...</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XV</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, Aug. 15/5, 1690.</p>

  <p>Last night I received yours of the 3rd July, and with great satisfaction
  that it was so plain; your approving my anger is a great ease to me, and I
  hope may make things go on the better if it be possible; though there are
  great pains taken to hinder the persons named either from serving at all, or
  from agreeing, but I hope to little purpose. They now begin to engage Mr.
  Citters in the business, and tell him stories which will be worth your
  hearing when you come back; and Sir R. Hadock is now said to rail at the
  Dutch, of which he has, I think cleared himself...</p>

  <p>Judge then what a joy it was to me to have your approbation of my
  behaviour, and the kind way you express it in, is the only comfort I can
  possibly have in your absence: What other people say I ever suspect, but when
  you tell me I have done well I could be almost vain upon it: I am sure I have
  all the reason in the world to praise God, who has sustained me in things so
  difficult to flesh and blood, and has given me more courage than I could have
  hoped for: I am sure 'tis so great a mercy that I can never forget it: We
  have received many: God send us grace to value them as we ought; but nothing
  touches people's hearts here enough to make them agree; that would be too
  much happiness. Lord Nottingham will give you an account of all things, and
  of some letters which by great luck are fallen into our hands. I must needs
  tell you upon the subject, that when it was first known you intended to come
  back, 'twas then said, What, leave Ireland unconquered, the work unfinished!
  now upon your not coming, 'tis wondered whose council this is, and why leave
  us thus to ourselves in our danger? Thus people are never satisfied; but I
  must not begin upon the subject which would take up volumes; and, as much as
  I was prepared, surprizes me to a degree that is beyond expression. I have so
  many several things to say to you if I live to see you, that I fear you will
  never have patience to hear half: But you will not wonder if I am surprized
  at things which though you are used to, are quite new to me. I am very
  impatient to hear again if you are over the Shannon; that passage frights me.
  You must excuse me telling my fears; I love you too much to hide them, and
  that makes all dangers seem greater it may be than they are. I pray God in
  his mercy to keep you, and send us a happy meeting here on earth, first
  before we meet in heaven.</p>

  <p>If I could take more pains to preserve your kindness, that which you write
  would make me do it; but that has been ever so much my desire, that I can't
  do more for you, nor love you better.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XVI</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, Aug. 17/7, 1690.</p>

  <p>I begin to grow extreme impatient to hear from you again, and till I do
  shall have little rest, for the passage of the river runs perpetually in my
  head. God grant I may hear good news...</p>

  <p>I will not trouble you with a longer letter at present; God give you quick
  success, and a speedy return, are my constant prayers with due submission, I
  am unreasonable upon this subject, loving you too well to be at any ease till
  I hear from you again.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XVII</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, Aug. 19/9, 1690.</p>

  <p>I have no letter from you since that of the 31st from Chapelford; what I
  suffer by it you cannot imagine. I don't say this by way of complaint, for I
  do believe you write as often as 'tis convenient or necessary, but yet I
  can't help being extremely desirous of hearing again from you. This passage
  of the river runs much in my mind, and gives me no quiet night or day; I have
  a million of fears, which are caused by that which you can't be angry at, and
  if I were less sensible I should hate myself, though I wish I were not so
  fear full, and yet one can hardly go without t'other; but 'tis not reasonable
  I should torment you with any of this...</p>

  <p>As for Lord Mountjoy, I hope you will consider if anything can be done for
  him. I can never forget that I promised his son's wife to speak to you, and
  she nearly died of grief, which makes me pity her case; his family is in a
  miserable way, and I am daily solicited by his eldest daughter about him; If
  you would let Lord Portland give me some answer to this, I should be very
  glad, for I can't wonder at people's desiring to know some answer, though I
  am tormented myself. The business of the commission for Lord Torrington's
  tryal sticks still at the admiralty, who are appointed Monday morning to meet
  the civilians at council. I have staid till I am ready to go to bed, and now
  can put off sending my letter no longer. I pray God give me patience and
  submission; I want the first exceedingly, but I hope all is well, especially
  your dear self, who I love much better than life.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XVIII</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL, Aug. 22/12, 1690.</p>

  <p>You cannot imagine the miserable condition I was in last night; I think
  had not your letter come as it did, I should have fallen sick with fear for
  your person; but all that trouble made your news of the French having left
  Limmerick the more welcome, I will not say your letter, for those are ever
  so. I am sure this news affords new reason of praising God, since I hope it
  will prevent any more fighting. You speak of your coming back now in a way
  which makes me hope not only that it will be quickly, but that you come
  willingly, and that is a double joy to me, for before I confess, I was afraid
  to have seen you dissatisfied when you were here, and that would have been
  very unpleasant; but now I hope in God to see you soon, and see you as well
  pleased as this place will suffer you to be, for I fancy you will find people
  really worse and worse. Lord Stuard was with me this afternoon with whom I
  had a long conversation which will be worth your knowing when you come; but
  he has made me promise to write you now some part of it, which is, that he
  begs you to consider if you will not have a new parliament, for this one he
  is sure will do no good; this he says is his opinion. I see it is a thing
  they are mightily set upon. Lord President methinks has very good arguments
  to try this first, but of all this you will judge best when you come. I can't
  imagine how it comes to pass that you have not received my letter of the 26th
  of July; I am sure I write and that you will have had it by this time, or
  else there must be some carelessness in it which must be lookt after. I have
  had this evening Lord Anandale who is to tell all, and then I am to procure a
  pardon from you, but I think I shall not be so easily deceived by him as I
  fear Lord Melvill has been by Sir James Montgomery; but these are things to
  talk of when you come back, which I pray God may be very soon. 'Tis the
  greatest joy in the world to hear you are so well. I pray God continue it. I
  hope this will meet you upon your way back, so it goes by an express that it
  may not miss you. I can't express my impatience to see you; there is nothing
  greater but that which it proceeds from, which will not end but with my
  life.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIX</p>

  <p>WHITEHALL Sept. 5/Aug. 26, 1690.</p>

  <p>My poor heart is ready to break every time I think in what perpetual
  danger you are; I am in greater fears than can be imagined by any who loves
  less than myself. I count the hours and the moments, and have only reason
  enough left to think, as long as I have no letters all is well. I believe, by
  what you write, that you got your cannon Friday at farthest, and then
  Saturday I suppose you began to make use of them; judge then what cruel
  thoughts they are to me to think what you may be exposed to all this while. I
  never do anything without thinking now, it may be, you are in the greatest
  dangers, and yet I must see company upon my sett days; I must play twice a
  week; nay, I must laugh and talk, tho' never so much against my will; I
  believe I dissemble very ill to those who know me, at least 'tis a great
  constraint to myself, yet I must endure it; all my motions are so watched,
  and all I do so observed, that I eat less, or speak less, or look more grave,
  all is lost in the opinion of the world; so that I have this misery added to
  that of your absence and my fears for your dear person, that I must grin when
  my heart is ready to break, and talk when my heart is so oppress'd I can
  scarce breathe. In this I don't know what I should do, were it not for the
  grace of God which supports me; I am sure I have great reason to praise the
  Lord while I live for this great mercy, that I don't sink under this
  affliction; nay, that I keep my health; for I can neither sleep nor eat. I go
  to Kensington as often as I can for air, but then I can never be quite alone;
  neither can I complain, that would be some ease; but I have nobody whose
  humour and circumstances agrees with mine enough to speak my mind freely to;
  Besides, I must hear of business, which being a thing I am so new in, and so
  unfit for, does but break my brains the more, and not ease my heart. I see I
  have insensibly made my letter too long upon my own self, but I am confident
  you love enough to bear with it for once; I don't remember that I have been
  guilty of the like fault before, since you went; and that is now three
  months, for which time of almost perpetual fear and trouble, this is but a
  short account, and so I hope may pass: 'Tis some ease to me to write my pain,
  and 'fis a great satisfaction to believe you will pity me, it will be yet
  more when I hear it from yourself in a letter, as I am sure you must if it
  were but out of common good nature; how much more then out of kindness, if
  you love me as well as you make me believe, and as I endeavour to deserve a
  little by that sincere and lasting kindness I have for you; But by making
  excuses I do but take up more of your time, and therefore must tell you that
  this morning, Lord Marlborough went away; as little reason as I have to care
  for his wife, yet I must pity her condition, having lain in but eight days;
  and I have great compassion for wives when their husbands go to fight...</p>

  hours sleep the night before, for a reason I shall tell you. I had a
  compliment last night from the Queen Dowager who came to town a Friday; she
  sent it I believe with a better heart because Limmericke is not taken: For my

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Sophia Dorothea of Zell was the daughter of George William, Duke of Zell,
  and Éléonore d'Olbreuse, a French lady of noble birth who was the Duke's
  morganatic wife. After eleven years of married life the Duke formally
  espoused Éléonore and thus made her his Duchess.</p>

  <p>Sophia Dorothea was married at the age of sixteen years to George Louis,
  eldest son of the Electress of Hanover, 1682. Prince George Louis was brave,
  honest, sincere and profligate, his bride was frivolous, passionate and
  romantic; the marriage was loveless and the wife was dainty and beautiful,
  with an exquisite shape, masses of dark brown hair and large black eyes. In
  1683 Sophia Dorothea bore a son, afterwards George II of England, and in 1686
  a daughter, Sophia, who afterwards became the mother of Frederick the Great.
  The marriage was extremely unhappy, the Prince being openly unfaithful with
  many women conspicuous among whom was Melusina Ermengarda von Schulenberg,
  who became his official mistress; her he afterwards took to England with him
  and called Duchess of Kendal. Two years after the birth of her last child,
  Count Philip Christopher von Koenigsmarck came to the Court of Hanover and
  renewed a childhood's acquaintance with the Princess. This Swedish nobleman
  was of wealthy, brilliant, highly placed family. All the Koenigsmarcks were
  bold adventurers, handsome and unscrupulous. Philip was, in particular,
  restless, daring, beautiful and fascinating; he was a professional soldier
  and a professional gallant; he was also one of the richest men in Europe and
  thus was able to set off splendidly his gifts and charms. The neglected
  Princess, lovely, lively and twenty-two years old, and the dazzling cavalier
  fell in love. Koenigsmarck settled in Hanover, where he lived with
  ostentatious splendour and was given the colonelcy of the Hanoverian Guards.
  In 1689, Hanover joined the affiance formed by William III against France and
  Koenigsmarck went on active service; he frequently returned to Hanover and
  pressed his suit with the Princess, who, after some resistance, became his
  mistress. The difficult and dangerous love intrigue was carried on for two
  years when Koenigsmarck was murdered on leaving his mistress's bedchamber;
  she was divorced with ignominy and confined for the rest of her life at
  Schloss Ahlden where she died at the age of sixty-one years, fourteen years
  after her husband had ascended the British throne as George I. The
  correspondence between the tragic lovers begins in July 1691 and ends in
  December 1693. It was copied from the originals in the Library of the
  University of Lund by W. H. Wilkins, M.A., in 1898. The letters were by him
  translated from the French, arranged, edited, explained and published in a
  two-volume biography of Sophia Dorothea entitled, <i>The Love of an Uncrowned
  Queen</i> (Hutchinson's, 1900). To this exhaustive work the reader is
  referred for all further information as to the history of the lovers and of
  the letters. It is sufficient to say here that there is no question of the
  authenticity of this remarkable correspondence; the lovers sent their letters
  for safety to the Countess Aurora, Count Philip's sister; she preserved them
  and finally gave them to her sister, Countess Lewenhaupt, who handed them to
  her son; they were preserved in family archives until 1848 when they were
  given to the Library of the University of Lund, Sweden. A large mass of the
  correspondence was seized and destroyed after the murder of Koenigsmarck, and
  it is remarkable that this portion should have been saved. Some of the
  Princess's letters were dictated to her faithful confidante Fräulein von
  Knesebeck, others are in her own hand. Koenigsmarck wrote all his letters
  himself. The following is a brief selection from this correspondence taken,
  with permission, from the book mentioned above; the translation is that of
  Mr. Wilkins. The letters explain themselves, they were mostly written during
  the lover's absence at the war and reveal, vividly enough, the progress of
  this romantic and tragic love-story.<br>

  forthwith be healed. I hope you will not be so cruel as to refuse me this
  favour, for, since it is you who cause my sufferings, it is only just that
  you should send me comfort. Were I not writing to one for whom my respect is

  to you. I dare not even admire the eyes that give me life. For pity's sake
  let me see you alone, that I may say four words&mdash;only four small words.
  Oh! how dearly it costs me to love you! But the joy of speaking to you now
  and then makes amends for all the pain. I shall go away to-morrow. God knows
  if I shall ever see you again, my life, my goddess! The thought that we may
  never meet more is death to me. I feel ready to plunge a dagger into my

  <p>No mortal was ever so happy as I when, on arriving here, I found your
  letter. I am now in your good graces, and am losing all the weak suspicions
  that tore my heart in twain. Do not doubt my love; God be my witness, I have
  never loved as I love you. Were you to see me now you would exclaim, "Is it
  possible that any man can be so downcast?" My dejection is wholly the result
  of absence from you. My noble travelling companion* could tell you of the
  state in which he sees me daily, though you may be sure that I hide from him
  the cause. You may not believe it, but on the word of a man of honour, I am
  often so overcome that I am near swooning away; and yesterday evening, when I
  was out walking, and thinking of the many days that I must pass before seeing
  you, I became so agitated that it brought on a palpitation of the heart, and
  I was obliged to return home. I know not what would have happened had not my
  servant brought me a cordial, and even then it was a long time before I
  recovered. Were it not for your dear letter, I should have utterly broken
  down. Your medicine is excellent for my malady; send me some oftener...I am
  ready to cast at your feet my life, my honour, my future, my fortune. I have
  forsworn all other women for you; if you doubt this, name anyone you would
  like me to abandon, and I will never speak to her again. Adieux emable Brune.

  <p>Nothing could have comforted me more in my sickness than your sweet
  letter, I find it full of tenderness. I am sorry you have found the time so
  tedious. I suffer from the same misfortune, and have no chance of being
  happier to-day unless you wish to play. If my fever be not too great, I will
  pass under your windows in the hope of seeing you. You will not refuse me
  this grace; you know the sight of you will be a soothing balm in my sickness;
  a visit from you would be an infallible remedy. You speak to me of passion.
  Alas! it is for me to speak of it&mdash;mine is so great that it will consume
  me utterly at last. Oh! my dear, my dear! do you think that you love with as
  much passion as I love?...It is cruelly hard for me not to be with you
  always&mdash;I am compelled to keep away from you, God knows with what grief.
  The Count de Reuss* prevents me from ending my letter as I would.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The Count de Reuss was the uncle by marriage of Sophie
  Dorothea; he had married Angelica d'Olbreuse, sister of the Duchess of

  <p>Of a truth I was ill pleased with the cold airs you treated me to
  yesterday, and I spent the night most miserably. I was in great sorrow and
  fain to weep, and all these emotions made me very feverish for nearly three
  hours. I vow, my divine beauty, that I never remember having been in such a
  pitiful plight before. "Alas!" I cried, "God burns me with sickness, and
  gives me no comfort, for He freezes the heart of my divinity, and life is
  intolerable." I threw myself on my knees, tears in my eyes, and prayed that
  if it were true that you loved me no longer, I might die...I cannot tell you,
  therefore the joy your letter gave me. I kissed it time and again. I hate
  myself for having thought you guilty of inconstancy; I cast myself at your
  feet, praying pardon, and I promise never to be so ready to believe things
  again.</p>

  <p>I am awaiting Her Highness's commands.* When you give me leave I shall fly
  to you; and if I am not wanted, I shall show that I cannot attach myself to
  anyone else, for I shall take the first mail coach to join my regiment. I
  hope that in time Fortune will get tired of persecuting me so cruelly, and
  Fate will be in my favour; but whatever misfortunes may befall, I shall bear
  them with joy so long as the heart I adore remains constant to me.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* i.e. the commands of the Princess.]</p>

  <p>My happiness and fortune are there, my ambition is bounded there. For
  pity's sake believe me faithful. To convince you the better how I love you,
  how I worship you, I sign this with my blood. Whilst you love me, you will be

  my joy will be too apparent, that everyone will see in my eyes it can only
  emanate from you. I will restrain myself as much as I can; but "when the
  heart is so proud the eyes play the traitor." Your eyes, more than I dared
  hope, declared to me last evening the feelings of your heart. I am so

  <p class="cpi">Koenigsmarck to Sophia Dorothea</p>

  <p>With what grief I hear that you have been in other arms* than mine! I
  cannot express what I feel, but it must be so, I suppose; at least, you
  suffer it with regret and take care to tell me. I confess I should never have
  enough power over myself to endure the embraces of a person I did not love; I
  would rather see all the Furies than an object I detested. However, your
  promises reassure me of your affection, and give me comfort; without that
  small consolation I should be miserable indeed. I adore and love you to
  distraction, yet I must not see you! Are there any torments like this in
  hell? But I can endure the anguish by remembering my martyrdom is through
  you, and it is for love of you I suffer: you are well worth the pain. I am
  wrong to be so disturbed since you assure me of your love. "What will assure
  me of your constancy?" Your conduct is the guarantee I ask of you. It is
  superfluous for me to make new protestations of love and faithfulness, for I
  have given you solid and convincing proofs; but, if, haply, you will not
  believe these, believe the vows I made you and am ready to make at any
  time.</p>

  <p>The moments seem to me centuries. I cannot watch the daylight without
  raging. Why do not the hours shut up into moments? What would I not give for
  twelve o'clock to strike? Be sure to have ready <i>de l'eau de la reine
  d'Hongrie</i>, for fear my rapture may make me swoon away. What! I shall
  embrace to-night the loveliest of women. I shall kiss her charming mouth. I
  shall worship her eyes, those eyes that enslave me. I shall hear from her
  very lips that she loves me. I shall have the joy of embracing her knees; my
  tears will chase down her incomparable cheeks. I shall hold in my arms the
  most beautiful body in the world. Verily, Madame, I shall die of joy. But so
  long as I have time to tell thee that I die thy slave, I care for naught
  beside.</p>

  <p>I slept like a king, and I hope you did the same. What joy! what rapture!
  what enchantment have I not tasted in your sweet arms! Ye gods! what a night
  I spent! The memory of it blots out all my troubles, and for the moment I
  count myself the happiest man on earth. You see, it rests wholly with you to
  make me happy, and when I am sad you are the cause. Adieu, dear heart. How
  long the day will seem to me without seeing you! Adieu.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IX</p>

  <p class="cpi">Koenigsmarck to Sophia Dorothea</p>

  <p>Verily I am overwhelmed by the tokens of love you have vouchsafed to me. I
  shall never be able to show you my gratitude, but shall always be your
  debtor. I love and I am loved. Is there any bliss approaching mine? I count
  myself the happiest of mortals, and even of the gods. Ah! most beautiful one!
  The tenderness you have shown me compels me to love you, and makes me despise
  the favours of good and the caprices of bad fortune. Time will bring no
  change in my love. I would abandon for you all ties&mdash;family, relations,
  women, even wife and children had I any. My passion intoxicates me. I can no
  longer think&mdash;words fail. I commit myself to your keeping; do with me as
  you will. I can scarcely keep my heart within bounds; it strives perpetually
  to burst away and thank you for its captivity, for it loves to be the slave
  of one who treats it so generously. I fear I shall lose it altogether, but as
  I cannot live without a heart, for pity's sake, Madame, give me yours in
  return, for without one or the other I shall die. Do not put off my seeing
  you this evening, I beseech you. You have convinced me so deeply that you
  love me, that I have never loved you so much before. You have never appeared
  to me so altogether lovely. With crossed hands and bended knees I thank you
  for all you have vouchsafed unto me. Suffer me therefore to see you again
  to-day, and do not put me off. I should die.</p>

  <p>The Prince went away to-day at eight o'clock. He is angry because you
  wished to remain with your mother. All goes wonderfully well. Farewell.</p>

  <p>HANOVER, <i>undated</i>.</p>

  <p>I spent the stillness of the night without sleeping, and all the day
  thinking of you, weeping over our separation. Never did a day seem so long to
  me; I do not know how I shall ever get reconciled to your absence. La
  Gouvernante* has just given me your letter; I received it with rapture. Rest
  assured I will do even more than I have promised, and lose no opportunity of
  showing you my love. If I could shut myself up while you are away and see no
  one, I would do so gladly, for without you everything is distasteful and
  wearisome. Nothing can make your absence bearable to me; I am faint with
  weeping. I hope to prove by my life that no woman has ever loved man as I
  love you, and no faithfulness will ever equal mine. In spite of every trial
  and all that may befall, nothing will sever me from you. Of a truth, dear
  one, my love will only end with my life.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This must have been another name for the Fräulein von
  Knesebeck, la Confidente.]</p>

  <p>I was so changed and depressed to-day that even the Prince, my husband,
  pitied me, and said I was ill and ought to take care of myself. He is
  right,&mdash;I am ill; but my illness comes only from loving you, and I never
  wish to be cured. I have not seen anyone worth mentioning. I went to visit
  the Duchess (Sophia) for a little while, but returned home as soon as
  possible to have the joy of talking about you.* La Gazelle's husband** came
  to wish me good-bye; I saw him in my chamber, and he kissed my hand.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[** La Gazelle may have been Countess von Lewenhaupt (so
  called because of her gazelle-like eyes), whose husband was about to march
  With the Duke of Zell's troops to Flanders.]</p>

  <p>It is now eight o'clock, and I must go and pay my court. How dull I shall
  seem!&mdash;how stupid! I shall withdraw immediately after supper, so that I
  may have the pleasure of reading your letters again, the only pleasure I have
  while you are away. Farewell, my worshipped one. Only death will sever me
  from you; all human powers will never succeed. Remember all your promises,
  and be as constant as I will be faithful.</p>

  <p class="cpi">Sophia Dorothea to Koenigsmarck</p>

  <p>ZELL, July 25/August 4.</p>

  <p>This is the third post, and still no letter! Surely so tender a lover as
  you always seemed to be cannot have wholly forgotten me&mdash;or are we
  betrayed? It positively must be one thing or the other. The suspense is so
  acute that I have not a moment's peace. But my great fear is that you have
  changed. I think of nothing else, nor of all that may happen to me. Is it
  possible that you have forgotten your vows of eternal fidelity? I strive to
  drive away my sad thoughts, but I am in such abject melancholy that I fear it
  is a foreboding of misfortune. If you love me no longer I shall never be
  comforted. But what is the use of telling you that? You know it, and perhaps
  the knowledge has not prevented you from becoming unfaithful. Why do you
  force me by your silence to believe the worst? I have not deserved this
  coldness, for none ever loved so tenderly before. If I receive no letter from
  you by the next post I shall no longer be able to doubt. What pleasure can
  you find in grieving me thus? What have I done to be treated in this way? Is
  it because I love you to madness and am faithful to you with a faithfulness
  that nothing will ever equal? I have not the strength to say more, for I am
  writing perchance to an ungrateful being, and the thought is death. Farewell.
  If no letters come by the first post I shall risk sending a note by Lenner,
  for if there should be treachery I fear that you have received none of mine.
  I send you this by the postmaster here.</p>

  <p>I am the most unfortunate and unhappy of women. No sooner is my mind at
  rest about your constancy than I am plunged into terrible fear for your life.
  I have not closed my eyes all night. I am so downcast and melancholy that
  every one pities me: indeed, I am to be pitied, for the man who gives my life
  all its happiness is in danger every moment; perhaps I shall never see him
  again. It will kill me; I cannot endure this suffering. I shall surely not
  survive you, I implore you, in the name of the love I bear you, expose me not
  again to such anxiety, but leave me never more. I am weary of suffering so
  much. It is only right that you should give yourself wholly to me, for I have
  given myself all to you. My heart is breaking, I shall have no peace until I
  know that you are safe.</p>

  <p>Since you bid me lose no time in coming to you, I have determined to start
  at once, without waiting for leave, whatever may happen. It is not very
  prudent, for it will give pretext them the retext they seek; but since you
  wish to see me, I fly, I rush to the spot where you are. Why cannot I be
  there to-night? You relieve me of my forebodings by saying that with prudence
  and wisdom we shall be able to outwit our enemies. Let me know your plans,
  and I will give you my views. My life and happiness depend on them. I am
  sorry your letters were delayed, for I suck from them much sweetness. Anima
  mia, what can I do to prove my gratitude? How happy I am, mine angel, my
  divinity, my delight, my sole consolation! Your merits are beyond all else in

  <p>The life I have been leading since the Court returned must, I fear, give

  I cannot live without a little pleasure, and one of them is so much like you
  that I cannot help being in her society. You will be curious to know her

  cannot forget those delectable moments at Brockhausen. What pleasure! what
  transports! what ardour! what rapture we tasted together! and with what grief
  we parted! Oh that I could live those moments over again! Would that I had

  <p>HANOVER, August 5.</p>

  <p>This is the sixth day since you left, and I have not had a word from you.
  What neglect and what disdain! In what way have I deserved such treatment? Is
  it for loving you to adoration, for having sacrificed everything? But of what
  use to remind you of this? My suspense is worse than death; nothing can equal
  the torments this cruel anxiety makes me suffer. What an ill fate is mine,
  good God! What shame to love without being loved! I was born to love you, and
  I shall love you as long as I live. If it be true that you have changed, and
  I have no end of reasons for fearing so, I wish you no punishment save that
  of never finding, wherever you may be, a love and fidelity equal to mine. I
  wish, despite the pleasures of fresh conquests, you may never cease to regret
  the love and tenderness that I have shown you. You will never find in the
  whole world anyone so loving and so sincere. I love you more than woman has
  ever loved man. But I tell you the same things too often; you must be tired
  of them. Do not count it ill, I implore you, nor grudge me the sad
  consolation of complaining of your harshness. I am very anxious for fear they
  have detained the letter you were to have written to me from Zell. I have not
  received a word; everything conspires to crush me. Perhaps in addition to the
  fact that you no longer love me, I am on the eve of being utterly lost. It is
  too much all at once; I shall break down under it. I must end this to-morrow;
  I shall go to Communion. Farewell. I forgive you all you make me suffer.</p>

  <p>Your conduct is not very kind. You appoint a rendezvous, and then leave me
  to freeze to death in the cold, waiting for the signal. You must have known
  that I was there from 11.30 till 1, waiting in the street. I know not what to

  quickly enough. Farewell, then. I start tomorrow morning for Hamburg.</p>

  <p><i>The next morning</i></p>

  <p>Having spent the whole night without sleeping, I have had time to think
  over my troubles. I determined to go, but then I remembered I once swore to
  you that I would never go away abruptly, and I want to know before I go the
  reason of your behaviour. That is why I am still here to-day. I shall not
  appear at Court, for I mortally hate it, and so you will not be able to give
  me the signal with your eyes; but the other way will let me know if I may

  Ninon eut trop d'amans pour connaître l'amour.<br></p>

  <p style="margin-left:50%">&mdash;M. Desmahis.<br>
  Epitaphe pour NINON DE LENCLOS</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Anne De Lenclos was born at Paris of a good family; her mother was pious,
  her father a cultured, reckless libertine, who taught her to enjoy Montaigne
  and Charron before she was twelve years old. In 1652, M. de Lenclos fled
  France in consequence of a quarrel with a M. de Chabons, whom he killed; this
  gay philosopher and soldier had already moulded the character of his
  daughter, who shocked her mother by her witty mockery of both sacred and
  profane subjects.</p>

  <p>Not very beautiful, but extremely charming and fascinating, Ninon, as she
  was called, resisted all the efforts of priests and wise friends to reform
  her sceptical turn of mind and her worldly inclinations. She was delicately
  made, graceful, and had, according to one who knew her, not only "a noble
  air," but an expression at once "tender and touching"; she had black hair and
  eyes, and that fine complexion usually described as 'dazzling.' At fifteen
  years of age she entered on a first love-affair with a debt-ridden officer in
  the light cavalry and also on a life of <i>galanterie</i>. Cardinal Richelieu
  was reputed to be among her earliest admirers. Ninon visited him dressed as a
  page. After this she shook off every vestige of maternal authority and
  established herself in handsome apartments in Paris, paid for by the
  generosity of her lovers, who included most of the notable men of the time.
  Her father returned secretly to France to die in his daughter's arms; he gave
  her some last advice of an extremely hedonistic nature; life was short, he
  declared, and he advised his willing Ninon&mdash;"to be never scrupulous as
  to the number, but only as to the choice of your pleasures."</p>

  <p>In 1643 Madame de Lenclos died, and moved by grief and perhaps remorse,
  Ninon retreated into a convent, but soon re-entered the world and resumed her
  former mode of life, gaily throwing off all restraints and conventions and
  taking as her motto&mdash;"Feminine virtue is nothing but a convenient
  masculine invention."</p>

  <p>Ninon de Lenclos became one of the most famous figures of her age; her
  adventures, her sayings, her lovers have become legendary and it is now
  difficult to distinguish truth from invention in the accounts of her long and
  successful career. There can be no doubt, however, that her intelligence, her
  charm, her wit, her good humour and tact brought her a well-deserved
  popularity among the gallant, the fastidious, the well-bred and the brilliant
  men and women of her time; Ninon was able to combine a succession of amorous
  affairs into which her heart did not enter at all with tender, affectionate
  friendships. Ninon had many accomplishments, like her father she was an
  exquisite lutanist; her dancing, particularly of the <i>sarabande</i>, was a
  marvel of grace; she was a most fascinating speaker and clever at both prose
  and verse; she was also, what is rare enough, an expert in love; of the great
  Condé, one of her gallants, she shrewdly remarked&mdash;"it requires much
  more genius to make love than to command armies." This genius she herself
  possessed to the full. To her own sex she gave this invaluable advice. "A
  love-affair is, of all dramas, that in which the acts are longest, the
  intervals shortest&mdash;how can these be filled save by cultivating one's
  talents?"</p>

  <p>One of Ninon's closest friends was M. Charles de Saint-Évremond, 'a cadet
  of Normandy' and one of the gentlemen in the household of the duc d'Enghien.
  Epicurean and hedonist as Ninon herself, soldier and poet, the heartless and
  brilliant courtier was exiled to England by Louis XIV; there he lived on
  pensions from Charles II and William III and became the worshipper of
  Hortense Mancini, duchesse de Mazarin; he died at a considerable age in 1703
  and is buried in Westminster Abbey. "He and I," said Ninon, "will write the
  world's epitaph."</p>

  <p>Saint-Évremond remained always the loyal friend of Ninon, with whom he
  corresponded during his exile; to him she was the perfect <i>amoureuse</i>,
  the true goddess of love; <i>"Qui a aimé aimera</i>," he wrote of her; she
  seemed indeed for many of her contemporaries, immortal. Health, contentment
  and high spirits preserved her good looks to an extent that then seemed
  miraculous; some stories tell of her receiving a fresh lover on her eightieth
  birthday; but Voltaire, who saw her in the last years of her life, declared
  that she "had all the ugliest signs of old age." We know at least that she
  kept her pride and wit to the end and faded and died with cheerful decorum,
  leaving behind her such a reputation as few women have achieved. The
  following is a brief selection from her correspondence. The letters are taken
  and translated from:</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER I</p>

  <p class="cpi">M. de Saint-Évremond to Mlle de Lenclos</p>

  <p>1669.</p>

  <p>Despite that old dreamer [Solon] who considered that no one could be
  judged happy until after his death, I consider you, in the midst of life, the
  happiest creature that ever existed. You have been loved by the finest men in
  the world and your love for them endured just long enough for you to enjoy
  all the pleasure of it, without feeling any of the disgusts of lassitude or
  satiety. No woman has ever carried so far the possibilities of the happiness
  peculiar to your sex, there are few princesses that would not find their
  condition hard compared to yours that would arouse their jealousy; perhaps
  there are even saints in convents who would willingly exchange the
  tranquillity of their minds for the agreeable troubles of your heart. The
  only torments that you have ever known have been those of love&mdash;and no
  one is better aware than you are that the torments of love are worth more
  than its pleasures. To-day, when the first flower of your youth has passed
  (the expression is discourteous, but I only repeat what you have several
  times told me yourself) you preserve so many charms in your person and so
  much that is delightful in your mind, that, were you not fastidious in your
  choice of friends, your apartments would be as crowded by disinterested
  people, as those of the wealthy are by flatterers. You mingle even virtues
  with your charms, and in the moment that a lover declares his passion to you,
  a friend can confide his secret. Your word is a bond on which anyone can
  safely rely&mdash;and when you give a hope of a hundred pistoles, one can
  count on them as if they were already received. With this exact word of
  honour you are willing to use an official falsehood for a friend. Perhaps,
  for instance, you saw, two days ago, someone buried three months since, and
  if anyone is impudent enough to say that he assisted at the funeral, you
  rigorously maintain that he mistook for an interment what was really a
  baptismal or wedding ceremony. With so many virtues I am astonished that
  Ministers of State merely dine with you. I am astonished because you do not
  yourself govern some great realm where the people would be as happy as they
  were in Cytherea, in the time of the good goddess Venus. Let us fly, my dear,
  let us hasten to the Indies, to practise the cult of these people; we should
  live there for centuries, and every moment would be full of pleasure. In that
  country, I declare, there is one admirable gain over ours, you are always
  three years younger than you think you are. Alas, have pity on us mortals,
  who add days on days to our age, as we hasten towards the end&mdash;whereas
  you, when your age seems to you a little advanced, you turn back, you throw
  off the years with as little trouble as it takes you to add another chemise
  to your toilet this cold weather. My years run ahead, but though I feel some
  loss of my former vigour, I console myself for what is gone by trying to
  preserve what is left. Would it please God that we were together in a clean,
  dainty little house in the sweet bonds of marriage...there are some examples
  here and in Madrid! We should, no doubt, devote much time to the delicacies
  of the mind, but we should also give a little attention to the body&mdash;if
  only in order that it did not become jealous of its companion. In any case, I
  should be able to put into your head my ideas of the Fortunate
  Isles&mdash;they would be better perhaps than the French realities. I have
  shown your assertion of his existence to the Comte de Riez who has been a
  little surprised at his resurrection; he has heard of that of Lazarus after
  three days, but did not believe that it was possible after three years.
  Adieu, I would much like to know if the lute goes well.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II</p>

  <p>1670.</p>

  <p>I feel the deepest vexation in the world not to have received the letter
  that I hear you had the goodness to write to me; it is, apparently, lost in
  the vicissitudes of the post, with several others. M. d'Hervart told me that
  you would send me fifty pistoles whenever I wished&mdash;I, therefore, always
  ready to follow your orders, at once wished for them. I do not, besides, know
  what will become of the other fifty, if I am not to have them. Relying on
  your promise, I left with a good heart M. Delbène, our dear friend and false
  creditor; his debt to me now amounts to 1,334 livres&mdash;your pistoles
  would put his conscience at rest. If you do not send me more than the fifty
  pistoles of which M. d'Hervart spoke to me, do not reproach yourself with
  having broken your word&mdash;it would be the fault of my star, not a lack in
  your good faith; the most honourable people, my friends, well intentioned
  gentlemen, would, if I had had need of promises, have made them just to do me
  a favour&mdash;and intended to keep them, too. It would be the fault of my
  accursed star, not theirs, if their inclinations changed and they felt forced
  to act against their natural dispositions. I have another consolation that
  turns my thoughts to a pleasant aspect of this gloomy subject; if I receive
  the entire sum, your exactitude and honour will absolve me from the position
  of a lover subject to your infidelity. If I receive nothing, my position will
  be too interested for me to remain your friend, and the good opinion of the
  surety in the affair will be lost.* The tone that you take is worthy of your
  wit and does justice to the part that I have always played with
  you&mdash;neither a mere friend, nor truly a lover. Perhaps you are too
  severe to allow the least hint of passion; I am accustomed to suffer such
  rigours, and if you will send me the other fifty pistoles as a sign that you
  condemn the tendernesses that I have had for you, I will coin you in these
  strictures and receive the pistoles as a mere friend that has no right to
  expect more than friendship. A friend, at least, I shall be all my life, and
  as there is more in reality than in imagination perhaps I shall be something
  more when I speak to you again.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* In a letter to M. d'Hervart, Saint-Évremond explains
  this obscure passage that offended Ninon; he meant that he wished to be
  treated as a friend of Mademoiselle de Lenclos, who was always faithful to
  her word, and not as a lover of Ninon who was always unfaithful to her
  admirers, "the surety in the affair" is Ninon herself; she had guaranteed a
  loan of 100 pistoles from Saint-Évremond to Delbène.]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Ninon de Lenclos to M. Saint-Évremond</p>

  <p>1671.</p>

  <p>An honour that is too severe has always a slight air of ferocity and
  virtue only exists easily in an even temperature. I wrote you a very handsome
  letter in which I let you see all my merits as regards the premature payment
  demanded. Even though I did pass my word, I do not believe that Marcus Antony
  [<i>sic</i>] philosopher and Emperor besides, did not pay his creditors in
  advance.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Ninon had guaranteed the loan on the strength of some
  money that she was herself expecting.]</p>

  <p>Here, however, is what I have done for you and the poor Delbène. My sense
  of justice made me put myself in your place, though I might have put off
  everything until my business&mdash;from which I have not yet drawn a
  farthing&mdash;was settled. I thought, however, that we were both more to be
  pitied than I was and I send you a hundred pistoles of the thousand that I
  shall not, as I said, receive until the affair is concluded. This reflection
  shakes one's courage a little, it is true, but when one comes to think of
  it&mdash;it is dangerous to embroil oneself with a banker. The cold, a bad
  pen, M. d'Hervart's man, who waits to take this, prevents me from saying
  more, however, love me enough to enable you to resist my severity. I told you
  that my charms were changed into solid and serious qualities and you know
  that it is not permitted to trifle with a Personage.</p>

  <p>1686 (<i>London</i>).</p>

  <p>Your life, my dearest, has been too illustrious for it not always to
  remain so. Do not let the hell* of M. de la Rochefoucauld frighten
  you&mdash;this hell was only invented to make a maxim. Boldly pronounce the
  word 'love' and do not allow those&mdash;<i>old women</i> ever to leave your
  mouth. There is so much wit in your letter it is impossible to imagine the
  beginning of a decline. How ungrateful to be ashamed to mention <i>love</i>,
  to which you owe your merits and your graces.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* M. de la Rochefoucauld had told Ninon: "Old age is a
  woman's hell."]</p>

  <p>For, my beautiful guardian of the casket,* the reputation that you have
  for frivolity is particularly founded on the fact that though you have often
  resisted lovers you have always generously accommodated your friends with
  money. Admit then all your passions in order to have the benefit of all your
  virtues. However, you have only shown half your character. Nothing is warmer
  than your attitude towards your friends, nothing dryer than that you take
  towards your lovers. In a few verses, I give you your entire character; here
  it is, formed of all the qualities that you have or have had...do not let
  this diversity surprise you.</p>

  <p class="poem">Indulgent and wise nature<br>

  ten thousand écus in charge of Ninon and an equal sum in that of a saintly
  priest. On his return from abroad the holy man denied ever having received
  the money, but Ninon delivered up the sum intact. Some verses, almost
  impossible to translate adequately are omitted from the end of this letter;

  <p>I defy Dulcinea to feel more joy at the recollection of her knight*, than
  I at receiving your letter that has been welcomed as it deserves&mdash;and
  "the rueful countenance" has in no way diminished your sentiments. I am
  touched by their force and persistence&mdash;preserve them to the shame of
  those that dare to judge them. I believe with you that wrinkles are the marks
  of wisdom. I am ravished that your external virtues do not sadden you, I
  shall try to be the same. You have a friend (M. de Gramont) who owes his
  fortune to his charms; he is the only old man not considered ridiculous at
  Court...M. Delbène, whom you term the <i>Cunctator</i>, died in hospital. Is
  this what one calls the judgment of men?</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* An allusion to Don Quixote; in reference to his hero

  <p>If M. d'Olovne had been alive and had read the letter that you sent me, he
  would have continued to give you your title of his philosopher. M. de Lauzun

  <p>1687.</p>

  <p>I was alone in my room and very tired of reading, when they
  announced&mdash;"Here is a man from M. de Saint-Évremond." Judge if in that
  moment my boredom was dissipated. I had the pleasure of talking about you and
  I learnt what your letters did not tell me, your perfect health and your
  occupations. Happiness of mind brings strength, and your letter, as did M.
  d'Olovne when he visited you, assures me that England promises you another
  forty years of life; for it seems to me that only in England does one hear of
  people passing the natural span of years. I should like what remains to me of
  life with you, and if you had the same thought you would be here. It is,
  meanwhile, very delightful to recall the people whom one has loved and
  perhaps the separation of our bodies will give me another virtue to embellish
  my epitaph. I wish that the young preacher* had found me in the gloire de
  Niquée**&mdash;unchanged like that princess, for you seem to think that I,
  from the first, have been enchanted. Do not change your ideas, so favourable
  to me, on that point, and may your illusions&mdash;however unworthy
  philosophers consider them&mdash;last for ever.</p>

  of the Sultan, was set by her aunt in an enchanted palace&mdash;like that of
  the sleeping beauty, where everyone remained inanimate, and the Princess,
  seated on a throne immobile, gazed into a magic mirror that showed her the
  picture of her true love, <i>Amadis de Grèce</i>. M. Turretin had waited on
  Ninon with an introduction from her friend and she wished he had found her
  insensible to his presence, staring into a mirror that reflected
  Saint-Évremond and dowered with the immortal youth with which her
  correspondent credited her so often.]</p>

  <p>I showed M. Turretin the joy that I should have had to be useful to him in
  any way; some of my friends were here and found him worthy of the praises you
  give him. If he cares to profit by the scarcity of honest abbés in the
  absence of the Court, he will be treated as a man that you esteem. I read, in
  front of him, your letter, and with spectacles on, they did not misbecome me,
  I have always had a grave countenance. If he is in love with the <i>merit</i>
  that here they now term <i>distinguished</i>, perhaps your wish of his
  admiring me will be fulfilled, for with praises of my serious qualities
  everyone tries to console me for those that the years have taken from me. I
  see that you wish that La Fontaine was in England; he is not doing very well
  over here; his head is being very weak. That is the destiny of poets&mdash;as
  Tasso and Lucretius prove. I should think that La Fontaine had some love

  which I always knew the new conquest of a lover, for they always then shone a
  little more brightly than usual.</p>

  <p class="poem">We are still in Cytherea&mdash;</p>

  <p>You will always be the same for me, and when nature, who pardons no one,
  has exhausted her power over you by producing some alteration in your
  features, my imagination will be for you the enchantment of <i>la gloire de
  Niquée</i> where you will remain unchanged. I can assure you that you need
  not concern yourself about your eyes and your teeth&mdash;your only need, in
  my judgment, is to realise the advantages of your mind that comes every day
  nearer perfection. You are more spiritual than was the young and witty
  Ninon.</p>

  all the charms of youth, and his heart all the goodness and tenderness

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IX</p>

  <p class="cpi">M. de Saint-Évremond to Mlle de Lenclos</p>

  <p>1696.</p>

  <p>I have received the second letter that you wrote me&mdash;it is agreeable,
  gracious and <i>spirituelle</i>. I recognise the charms of Ninon and the good
  sense of Mlle de Lenclos. I know how the first lived and you tell me how the
  second passes her time. All contributes to make me regret the happy times
  that I have passed in your company, and to desire uselessly to see you again.
  I have not the strength to go to France and you have too much that is
  agreeable about you for you to wish to visit England. Madame de Bouillon will
  tell you that England has its charms and I should be ungrateful if I did not
  admit that I have found myself some pleasant things.* I learn with much
  pleasure that M. le Comte de Gramont has recovered his first health and
  become converted to religion. Up to now I have been quite grossly content to
  be a good fellow. I ought to be something more, and I only await your example
  to become converted too. You live in a country where it is wonderfully easy
  to save one's soul&mdash;where vice is not so fashionable as virtue. To sin
  is merely lack of knowledge of how to live&mdash;it shocks good manners as
  much as religion. Formerly it was enough to be wicked&mdash;but to get
  oneself damned in France nowadays one would have to be very stupid. Those who
  have no regard to another life are saved by a consideration for what is owing
  to appearances here. Enough of this subject brought to my mind by the
  conversion of M. de Gramont; I believe that he is honest and sincere. It will
  become a man no longer young to forget that he has ever been so. I cannot,
  however, accomplish this, on the contrary, the memory of my youthful years,
  of my past liveliness, helps to animate the languor of my old age. What I
  find, at this period of my life, the most tiresome, is that hope is
  lost&mdash;hope the sweetest of the passions and that which most contributes
  to the pleasures of life. The despair of ever seeing you again is what gives
  me the greatest pain. One must content oneself by relying on writing letters
  to sustain an affection that has resisted a length of time, a great distance
  between us and the usual silliness of old age. This last expression is only
  for myself; in you Nature begins to show that it is possible never to grow
  old. I beg you to assure M. le duc de Lauzun of my very humble services and
  to tell him that I should like to know if Madame la Maréchale de Créqui has
  paid him the five hundred écus that I owed him. I was written to about this a
  long time ago, I believe, but I am not quite sure.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER X</p>

  <p class="cpi">M. de Saint-Évremond to Mlle de Lenclos</p>

  <p>1697.</p>

  <p>It is more than a year since I had any news of you and no one tells me
  anything save M. Bastide who says that you are very well, and adds that, if
  you no longer have so many lovers you content yourself with a large number of
  friends. The falsity of the last news makes me doubt the truth of the first.
  You were born to love all your life. Lovers and gamblers have something in
  common; <i>qui a aimé, aimera</i>&mdash;he who has loved will always love. If
  they had told me that you have become religious, I should have believed it.
  That would be to pass from a profane to a sacred passion, from love of man to
  love of God, and to give the soul some occupation; but not to love at all
  argues a species of nothingness that does not belong at all to your
  heart.</p>

  <p class="poem">This languishing repose was never any good,<br>
  It is to find without dying a state of oblivion.</p>

  <p>I beg of you news of your health, of your occupations, of your honour, and
  all of this in a pretty long letter, where there shall be very little
  moralizing and plenty of affection for your old friend. They say here that
  the Comte de Gramont is dead&mdash;that vexed me considerably. If you know
  Barbin,* ask him why he prints under my name so many things that I never
  wrote. I have enough stupidities of my own to answer for without being
  bothered by those of others. For instance, they give me a piece against P.
  Boubours that I never wrote, nor thought of. There is not a writer that I
  esteem more than I do him. Our language owes him more than any other author,
  except Vaugelas. God grant that the news about the Comte de Gramont** is
  false and that about your good health true The <i>Gazette de Hollande</i>
  says that M. le <i>Comte</i> de Lauzun is about to be married; if this were
  true surely we should have heard of it from Paris&mdash;besides he is now
  <i>Duke</i>, not <i>Count</i>. If you have the goodness to write me
  something, you would oblige me by letting me know that you have given my
  compliments to M. de Gourville&mdash;if you still see him. As for news of war
  or peace, I do not ask for it, I will neither write nor receive it either.
  Adieu&mdash;from the truest of your servants who will be much the gainer if
  you have now no lovers, for then he will be first with you as the most
  devoted of your friends, despite an absence that promises to be eternal.</p>

  <p>I learn with pleasure that my soul is dearer to you than my body and that
  your good sense conducts you to the better part of me. The body, to tell the
  truth, is no longer worthy of attention but the soul has still some light
  that renders it sensible to the remembrance of a friend whose image has not
  been effaced by a long absence. I often tell old stories of M. Delbène, M. de
  Charleval and the <i>chevalier</i> de Pirière that amuse the present modern
  generation. You have a place in that good company, but, as you are a modern
  yourself, I take care not to praise you before the pedants that are devoted
  to the ancients. I have received your <i>Prologue en Musique</i> that I
  should much like to see on a Parisian theatre. Beauty&mdash;that is your
  subject&mdash;will make all that hear the piece envious. All our Helens
  cannot expect to find Homers and to be always goddesses of beauty. I have
  risen to heights&mdash;how shall I descend? My dear friend, must one not put
  a little heart into one's words? I assure you that I love you always far more
  than philosophy permits. Madame de Bouillon looks eighteen years
  old&mdash;the source of her charms is in the Mazarin blood. Now, when our
  Kings are friends,* cannot you make a little visit here? That for me would be

  the invalid. Seven towns, as you know, dispute the honour of being the
  birthplace of Homer, seven great nations dispute that of Morelli: India,
  Egypt, Arabia, Persia, Turkey, Italy, Spain. Cold countries, temperate
  countries, such as France, England and Germany have no pretension to this
  honour. He knows all languages and speaks most of them. His lofty, grand,
  ornamented style makes me think that he was born among Orientals, and
  polished himself by taking all that is best among Europeans. He is a
  passionate lover of music and mad about poetry; expert in painting, to say
  the least and I know not what besides, a connoisseur at least. As for
  architecture, friends of mine who know, declare that he is as capable of
  exercising this art as all the others. I beg you to introduce him to the
  acquaintance of all our celebrities, if he has yours, I shall consider him
  very fortunate. You will not permit him to meet anyone that has less merit
  than yourself. I think that I recall that Epicurus found one of his greatest
  pleasures was in the remembrance of things past. There is certainly nothing
  better for a man a hundred years*** old as I am, but there are still
  consolations, to remember you and all that I have heard you say, is one of
  the greatest. I write to you about a good many things in which you can't be
  interested, but I don't think that they will bore you. It is enough for me
  that they please me&mdash;at my age one cannot hope to please others. My
  merit is that I am content&mdash;more than content when I write to you. Think
  of me when you drink wine with M. de Gourville. I am lodging with M. de
  l'Hermitage, one of his relations, a very honest fellow, who took refuge in
  England because of his religion. I am vexed that the conscience of French
  Catholics would not suffer him in Paris and that the delicacy of his own
  obliged him to leave it; he surely merits the approbation of his cousin.</p>

  <p>What made you think that the sight of a young cavalier would give me

  forgotten all my lovers. If the word <i>doctor</i> had not reassured me, I
  should have sent you a reply by the abbé d'Hautefeuille and your English

  Gourville no longer leaves his room, and is indifferent to any pleasure, a
  good friend always, but of the kind that one does not like to trouble for
  fear of giving him vexations. M. de Pallard was once my friend, but great
  affairs turn great men from useless things. They tell me that M. l'abbé
  Dubois goes with him; this is a subtle little man who will, I think, please
  you. I have twenty of your letters here, he has read them with much
  admiration. You see that good taste has not come to an end in France. I was

  out of that what you will&mdash;you have drawn the admission from me. I beg
  you to let me know yourself if you still feel that happiness of which one
  tastes so little at certain times. The source of it, however, can never be
  dry for you while you have the friendship of the delightful person* who
  sustains your life. How I envy those who go to England and how pleased I
  should be to dine once more with you! Is it not rather gross to wish for a

  so much of them. One has read hardly anything worth retaining, one has said
  hardly anything worth listening to&mdash;miserable as my senses have now
  become, they are still capable of giving me much pleasure and I think that we
  do wrong to mortify them.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Another error in his age&mdash;eighty-two years was
  his age if born in 1616.]</p>

  <p>The wish to do so is perhaps only the jealousy of the mind that finds that
  the body has the better part. M. Bernier, the prettiest philosopher I have
  ever known (pretty philosopher sounds odd, but his face, his figure, his
  manner, his conversation, render him worthy of this epithet), M. Bernier, in
  talking of the mortification of the senses, said to me one day, "I will tell
  you in confidence what I would not admit to Madame de La Sablière,* or even
  to Mademoiselle de Lenclos, whom I consider her superior, I tell you in
  confidence, <i>that abstinence from pleasure appears to me a great sin</i>."
  I was surprised by the novelty of this system that made some impression on
  me. If he had continued his discourse perhaps he would have let me taste his
  doctrine. Continue your friendship that has never altered&mdash;and that is
  rare enough in such a long intercourse as ours.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* A 'grande amoureuse' of whom this was told: A relation
  rebuking her for her numerous love-affairs, exclaimed: "Eh, Madame, even the
  beasts are faithful for at least a season." "That is because," replied Madame

  <p class="cpi">M. de Saint-Évremond to Mlle de Lenclos</p>

  <p>1699.</p>

  <p>The last letter that I receive from Mademoiselle de Lenclos always seems
  to me the best, and this is not only because a present pleasure seems
  livelier than a past one&mdash;no, the real reason is that your intelligence
  strengthens every day. If your body is as good as your mind, I should ill
  sustain the competition of digestions that you speak of. I made a trial of
  mine against that of Lady Sandwich at a grand repast given by Lord Jersey; I
  was not defeated. Every one knows the intelligence of Lady Sandwich, I now
  realise, by the extraordinary esteem she has for you, her good taste. I was
  not defeated in the praises that we gave you, any more than I was in my
  appetite. You belong to all countries, as much to London as to Paris. You
  belong to all the periods, and while I claim you to do honour to mine, young
  people name you as one of the glories of theirs. You are therefore mistress
  of the past and the present, may you have considerable rights over the
  future! I do not mean by reputation, that is assured for all time. I am
  thinking of something more essential&mdash;life&mdash;eight days of it are
  worth more than eight centuries of glory after death. Your remark that if
  your present state of existence had formerly been proposed to you you would
  have hanged yourself, charmed me&mdash;however you content yourself with
  <i>ease</i> and <i>repose</i> after having known the liveliest emotions.
  There is no one who thinks more of youth than I do, but however often I
  remember it, I follow your example and accommodate myself to old age as well
  as possible. Would to God that Madame Mazarin had had your sentiments! She
  would still have been living, but she wished to die while she was still the
  most beautiful woman in the world. Lady Sandwich goes into the country, she
  leaves here admired in London as she was in Paris. Live, life is good when it
  is without grief. I beg you to give this note to M. l'abbé d'Hautefeuille,
  who is staying with Madame de Bouillon. I see sometimes the friends of M.
  l'abbé Dubois, they complain that he has forgotten them; assure him of my
  very humble respects.</p>

  <p>1699.</p>

  <p>Wit is very dangerous in friendship. Your letter would have spoilt anyone
  save myself. I know your astonishingly lively imagination but I had to remind
  myself that Lucian wrote in praise of the fly before I could accustom myself
  to your style. God be praised that you can think of me as you say you do! I
  am to surpass all the nations, indeed! But to you the true glory will belong,
  your last letter was a masterpiece, it made the chief subject of conversation
  among all the company that I have had in my rooms for the past month. You
  return to youth; you do well to love it; philosophy agrees well with the
  charms of the mind. It is not enough to be wise, one must please as well, and
  you will always please if you continue to think as you do now. Very few
  people resist the passing of the years, but they have not quite overwhelmed
  me. I wish like you that Madame Mazarin had thought more of her life without
  thinking so much of her face, that would always have been delightful from her
  intelligence though it might have been a little less brilliant. Lady Sandwich
  preserves the strength of her mind in losing that of her youth, at least so I
  think. Adieu, Monsieur, when you see Madame la comtesse de Sandwich, remind
  her of me, I should be very vexed to be forgotten.</p>

  <p>They have given me, in December, the letter that you wrote to me on the
  14th of October. It is a little old, but good things are willingly received,
  even though they come a little late. You are serious&mdash;yet you please.
  You would give a charm to Seneca who was not used to having any. You call
  yourself old with all the grace, the good humour and wit of youth. I have one
  curiosity that you can satisfy. When you recall your youth does not the
  remembrance of the past give you certain ideas as far from the languor of
  indolence as from the trouble of passion? Do you not feel in your heart a
  certain opposition to the tranquillity that you think that you have given to
  your mind? These are my wishes for the first day of the year, a day when
  those who have nothing to give make their good wishes serve as presents.</p>

  <p class="pin">To Mrs. Mary Steele<br>
  A dedication<br>
  <br>
  The tender mother,<br>
  The fond wife,<br>
  The prudent mistresse,<br>
  The frugall housekeeper,<br>
  The chearfull companion,<br>
  The happy slave to<br>
  Her powerful husband.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:50%">&mdash;RICHARD STEELE</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Richard Steele described himself as "an Englishman born in Dublin." His
  father was an attorney, his mother, "a very beautiful woman, of a noble
  spirit," as her son said, had been a Mrs. Symes and was born Elinor
  Sheyles.</p>

  <p>Steele was educated at Charterhouse and Christchurch, where he became the
  close friend of Joseph Addison. Entering the army as a trooper, Steele
  obtained a commission from Lord Cutts, "the salamander," and distinguished
  himself for valour and good humour in the wars of King William III against
  Louis XIV.</p>

  <p>The writing of dramas and a little book, <i>The Christian Hero</i>,
  intended to safeguard the author against "unwarrantable pleasures," were
  Steele's first literary efforts. He married a wealthy widow, who soon died
  and left him her handsome estate.</p>

  <p>Steele was frequently on active service, and when at home lived the life
  of a man about town&mdash;as a popular member of the Kit-Cat Club,
  experimenting in his laboratory at Poplar, and frequenting the circle of
  politicians, courtiers and literary men that included Swift, Gay, Prior and
  Addison. Steele obtained various Court sinecures amounting to about nine
  hundred pounds per annum, and lived very handsomely. In 1709 he married Mary
  Scurlock, who had some fortune; in 1709 he founded the <i>Tatler</i>; in 1711
  this was replaced by the <i>Spectator</i>, in the editing of which Addison
  assisted his old school and college friend. The death of his mother-in-law
  left him richer by five hundred pounds per annum; he then boldly resigned his
  sinecures and entered Parliament as M.P. for Stockbridge, Hants; his
  political opponents, however, soon drove him out of the House. His party came
  into power after the death of Anne (1714) and Steele received the Deputy
  Lieutenantship of Middlesex, two Court appointments, was again returned to
  Parliament, and, in 1716, knighted. He also became <i>Supervisor of the Royal
  Theatre</i> and wrote several more comedies.</p>

  <p>In 1718 Lady Steele died; the following year Steele quarrelled with
  Addison; soon after he fell into a state of invalidism and died in Wales
  1729, aged fifty-seven years.</p>

  <p>The dates of the births and deaths of the family that he and his Prue so
  tenderly loved make sad reading; Richard died the year before his mother,
  aged six years; Eugene in 1723 aged nine years; Mary in 1730 aged eighteen
  years; only the eldest, Elizabeth, lived to full age&mdash;as Lady Trevor she
  died in 1782.</p>

  <p>The following letters, written by Steele to his second wife, require
  little commentary; they are selected from those he wrote during the period of
  his second marriage, one of eleven years, when the charming, brilliant man,
  extravagant, impetuous, full of zeal, enthusiasm and the tenderest
  affections, was struggling to fulfil his ambitions and to provide for his
  family. He was often in debt, often&mdash;as the letters show&mdash;in hiding
  from his creditors, he lived lavishly, gambled, drank and held his own with
  the finest society of the time, and his nature, candid, passionate, courteous
  with the exquisite courtesy of the spirit, just, sparkling and gay, is
  touchingly revealed in these beautiful letters to his wife; no more charming
  creature ever put pen to paper than Richard Steele, soldier, courtier, man of
  letters and gallant lover. We can well believe his Prue, who inscribed one of
  his letters: "He was, when he wrote the following letter, as agreeable and
  pleasant a man as any in England.&mdash;Oct. 1716."</p>

  <p>Prue's own letters have been lost, but we can see her reflected in her
  husband's praise. Elizabeth Steele preserved her father's letters to her
  mother and they were published in 1787 and 1809, edited by John Nichols, who
  sent the MS. to the British Museum. The following version of this famous
  correspondence is from <i>The Letters of Richard Steele, edited by R. Brimley
  Johnson. Quill Library, London, 1927</i>.</p>

  <p>Steele was a handsome, attractive man with a dark florid face and a robust
  figure, the type to set off well the trappings of his period&mdash;periwig,
  gold lace, scarlet coat, mechlin lace, silk sash and red-heeled shoes; he was
  the most delightful of companions, a wholesome honesty and a delicate sense
  of honour underlying all his zest for pleasure and worldly advancement.</p>

  <p>The selection given here is from the first fourteen letters written during
  his brief courtship, the bulk of the others from London while he was chasing
  Fortune, and Prue waited anxiously at home. The last are addressed to
  Carmarthen, where Prue, then a dying woman, had been sent for that "change of
  air" in the efficacy of which the eighteenth century so firmly believed,
  while her husband was left in charge of the little family; she died within a
  short time of the date of his last letter, September 20, 1717. Prue was
  Steele's nickname for his wife because she tried to oppose "prudence" to his
  reckless extravagance.<br>

  <p>TO MARY SCURLOCK</p>

  <p>(Saturday, Aug. 9) 1707.</p>

  <p>MADAM,</p>

  <p>Your wit and beauty are suggestions which may easily lead you into the
  intention of my writing to you. You may be sure that I cannot be cold to so
  many good qualities as all that see you must observe in you. You are a woman
  of a very good understanding, and will not measure [my] thoughts by any
  ardour in my expressions, which is the ordinary language on these
  occasions.</p>

  <p>I have reasons for hiding from my nearest relation any purpose I may have
  resolv'd upon of waiting on you if you permit it; and I hope you have
  confidence from mine, as well as your own character, that such a
  condescension should not be ill us'd by, Madam, yr most obedient ser'nt.</p>

  <p>MADAM,</p>

  <p>I came to your house this night to wait on you; but you have commanded me
  to expect the happiness of seeing you at another time of more leisure. I am
  now under your own roof while I write; and that imaginary satisfaction of
  being so near you, tho' not in your presence, has in it something that
  touches me with so tender ideas, that it is impossible for me to describe
  their force. All great passion makes us dumb; and the highest happiness, as
  well as highest grief, seizes us too violently to be expressed by our
  words.</p>

  <p>You are so good as to let me know I shall have the honour of seeing you
  when I next come here. I will live upon that expectation, and meditate on
  your perfections till that happy hour. The vainest woman upon earth never saw
  in her glasse half the attractions which I view in you. Your air, your shape,
  your every glance, motion, and gesture, have such peculiar graces, that you
  possess my whole soul, and I know no life but in the hopes of your
  approbation: I know not what to say, but that I love you with the sincerest
  passion that ever entered the heart of man. I will make it the business of my
  life to find out means of convincing you that I prefer you to all that's
  pleasing upon earth. I am, Madam, your most obedient, most faithful humble
  ser'nt.</p>

  <p>It is the hardest thing in the world to be in love, and yet attend

  myself up, or other people will do it for me.</p>

  <p>A gentleman asked me this morning, "What news from Lisbon?" and I
  answered, "She's exquisitely handsome." Another desir'd to know "when I had
  been last at Hampton-court?" I reply'd, "'Twill be on Tuesday come se'n

  my mind may be in some composure. Oh love!</p>

  <p>MADAM,</p>

  <p>I beg pardon that my paper is not [finer], but I am forc'd to write from a
  coffee-house where I am attending about business. There is a dirty crowd of
  busy faces all around me, talking politics and managing stocks; while all my
  ambition, all my wealth, is love! Love, which animates my heart, sweetens my
  humour, enlarges my soul, and affects every action of my life. 'Tis to my
  lovely charmer I owe, that many noble ideas are continually affixed to my
  words and actions; 'tis the naturall effect of that generous passion, to
  create some similitude in the admirer, of the object admired. Thus, my dear,
  am I every day to improve from so sweet a companion. Look up, my fair one, to
  that Heaven which made thee such, and join with me to implore its influence
  on our tender innocent hours, and beseech the Author of love, to blesse the
  rites he has ordain'd, and mingle with our happinesse a just sense of our
  transient condition, and a resignation to His will, which only can regulate
  our minds to a steddy endeavour to please [Him and] each other. I am for ever
  your faithful ser'nt.</p>

      (Jacobite Ballad.)</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>The third Earl of Derwentwater was the richest and most influential of the
  great lords that joined the rising of 1715 in favour of James Stewart, only
  son of James II.</p>

  <p>Lord Derwentwater was a friend of the young Prince's (who was exactly his
  own age), an ardent Roman Catholic, and through his mother, Lady Mary Tudor,
  natural daughter of Charles II, a royal Stewart. For these considerations, he
  left vast possessions, a young wife, a noble position, a charming existence,
  for he was amiable, attractive and gifted.</p>

  <p>Arrested after the failure of the revolt, he was sent to the Tower, tried
  before his Peers, found guilty of high treason and condemned to be beheaded.
  He was offered a pardon on condition that he acknowledged George I and
  abjured his Faith, but steadfastly refused, a constancy in which he was
  encouraged by the pious exhortations of Bishop Gifford and Father Petre, two
  earnest Roman Catholic priests.</p>

  <p>In a state of religious enthusiasm the young Earl renounced all earthly
  hopes and wrote the following letters to his wife, which she kept treasured
  with the endorsement&mdash;"Some few lines of my dear, dear Lord's."</p>

  <p>He also wrote to his father and mother-in-law a letter dated "the night
  before execution," with a postscript headed "Execution day at five o'clock in
  the morning," that testifies to his deep love for his wife. This lady took
  her husband's body through the rough winter roads to Dilston, near Hexham; it
  was buried in the family chapel, which is still standing, though the remains
  of Lord Derwentwater were removed in 1874 to Thorden, Essex, the seat of Lord
  Petre. Lady Derwentwater was Anna Maria, daughter of Sir John Webb; she was
  married in 1712 and died of smallpox in 1723, leaving a son, the fourth Earl,
  who died unmarried in 1731, and a daughter, Anna Maria Barbara, who married
  Lord Petre.</p>

  <p>Lord Derwentwater met his end on the scaffold with lofty courage, February
  24, 1716; blond, slender and very pale, he appeared in a black velvet suit, a
  beaver with a long black plume over a flaxen peruke, stockings hand-knitted
  from thick black silk, and black leather shoes with silver buckles. A gold
  crucifix and several relics in crystal cases were hung round his neck.</p>

  <p>His vast estates, confiscated by the Government, were granted to Greenwich
  Hospital.</p>

  <p>These letters are taken, together with the above particulars, from:
  <i>James Radcliffe, third Earl of Derwentwater. Major Francis John Angus
  Skeet. London, 1929.</i></p>

  <p>The allusion to "the enclosed" in the first letter is to the Earl's
  accounts and statements of his affairs; he hoped that some of his property
  might be saved for his children, the younger of whom was unborn. Lord
  Scarborough was Lord Lieutenant of Durham and Northumberland, Lord Lumley,
  his second son, was Master of the Horse; these noblemen were Hanoverians, but
  true friends of Lord Derwentwater, who appointed them his trustees.<br>

  <p class="lhdi">Lord Derwentwater to his Wife</p>

  <p>23rd February, 1716.</p>

  <p>MY DEAREST WORLDLY TREASURE,</p>

  <p>I have sent you the enclosed, in which is contained all I know, but God
  knows I have as yet found little advantage by being a plain dealer, but on
  the contrary, have always suffered for it, except by my sincerity to you, my
  dear, for which you made me as happy as this world can afford; and now I
  offer up the loss I am likely to have of you as a means to procure my eternal
  happiness, where I pray God we may meet, after you have some years exercised
  your great virtues, to the edification of all that know you. I have corrected
  a few faults in Croft's accounts, but I leave it to you to order everything
  as you please, for I am mortally sure with the grace of God you will keep
  your promise. Somebody must take care of my poor brother Charles, to save
  him, if possible. I will recommend him, however, by a few circular lines to
  my acquaintance. Lord Nithisdale made his escape, upon which our unreasonable
  governor locked up the gates, and would not let me send the enclosed to you,
  and immediately locked us all up, though it was not eight of the clock, and
  could not be my fault, though it might prove my misfortune by his management.
  If you do not think the enclosed signifies anything, make what use you will
  of it.</p>

  <p>Adieu my dear, dear, great comfort.</p>

  <p>If anybody should take the enclosed make them promise to return it
  again.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p class="lhdi">The Same to the Same</p>

  <p>MY DEAREST WORLD'S TREASURE,</p>

  <p>Take courage, and call upon God Almighty. Do not let any melancholy

  a charming example to me. I deliver up my soul to God Almighty, and through
  the merits of my dear Saviour's passion, I hope to obtain everlasting

  <p>Tell Lord Scarborough and Lord Lumley, and shew them this, by which as a

  <p style="margin-left:50%">&mdash;WILLIAM DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>The Comte de Bonneval, son of a noble family in the Limousin, entered the
  French navy as a boy and was present at the battle of La Hogue. Handsome,
  brilliant, seductive, the turbulent young noble was dismissed from the navy
  for insubordination. At the outbreak of the war of the Spanish Succession,
  1701, he brought an Infantry regiment and served in Italy under maréchal de
  Catinat; a quarrel with the duc de Vendôme sent the impetuous and rash
  soldier over to the enemy; he became one of the most admired lieutenants of
  Prince Eugène, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces. This treachery
  (1706) was punished by Louis XIV by the hanging in effigy of Bonneval on the
  <i>place de Grève</i>. The dashing adventurer, however, covered himself with
  glory and was one of the heroes of the famous battle of Peterwardein.</p>

  <p>After a dazzling career in the service of the Emperor, Bonneval, at the
  height of his fame, returned to Paris and was reinstated in his honours by
  the duc d'Orléans, then Regent of France. He was then forty-two years of age,
  brilliant in appearance, manners, reputation, and soon became the idol of
  frivolous Parisian society.</p>

  <p>Wishing to consolidate his position by a conventional marriage, Bonneval,
  during this visit to Paris, married Judith de Gontaut, one of the twenty-six
  children of the duc de Biron and related to her husband.</p>

  <p>She was then seventeen years of age, gentle, modest and delicate, with a
  pale complexion, dark blue eyes, blonde hair and that air of angelic
  sweetness which caused her to be likened to a painting by Carlo Dolci. The
  romantic girl fell deeply in love with her wayward husband. After ten days of
  marriage he left her in order to take part in the victorious assault on
  Belgrade; they never met again.</p>

  <p>Bonneval made no effort to return to France; by 1724 he was embroiled with
  Prince Eugène and imprisoned by Imperial orders; he escaped, joined the
  Turks, "took the turban" and tried to introduce European ideas into the
  disorganised armies of the Sultan. Palace intrigue and Eastern indolence
  defeated him and he was exiled to Asia. Under the name of Pasha Oman he wrote
  memoirs on military tactics, and tried, after many adventures, to return to
  Europe and to make a journey to Rome in search of penitence and peace; he
  died while on his way to the Eternal City, aged seventy years.</p>

  <p>His wife had predeceased him by six years; she had passed her life in
  retirement, thinking only of her husband, and she continued to write to him
  until he became a renegade, when she was silent, considering herself a widow
  as she said; she was only forty-one years of age when she died "sick and
  infirm" of a broken heart.</p>

  <p>Bonneval sent only a few brief replies to her letters, but when they
  ceased he told a common friend that he missed them. Sainte-Beuve has
  celebrated Madame de Bonneval in his <i>Causeries littéraires</i> as "one of
  the rarest and purest female figures to be found during the Regency, one of
  the most gracious exceptions to the disorder and licence of the period."</p>

  <p>There are fourteen of Madame de Bonneval's letters that have survived;
  some of them are not dated, but cover a period of years; they were taken from
  Pasha Oman's papers after his death and returned to the Biron family. The
  following extracts are translated from the complete letters given in: <i>La
  Comtesse de Bonneval par Georgina Fullerton. Paris 1857.</i></p>

  <p>The first letter was written immediately after the girl's marriage of ten
  days was ended by her husband's departure for foreign service; the season was
  May, the scene Paris; as M. de Bonneval had nothing but a tarnished name to
  give his adoring wife, she remained in her father's mansion, the hôtel de
  Biron; the writer of this delicate appeal was not without hope that "<i>son
  maître</i>" would return to Paris or permit her to join him in Vienna.<br>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER I</p>

  <p>I cannot forbear trying to share with you my lively sorrow&mdash;perhaps I
  need to console yours&mdash;but, indeed, I cannot imagine any true
  consolation for those who love and are separated, and so I find my only
  pleasure in abandoning myself to all manner of sadness.</p>

  <p>Believe me, my dear master, I am entirely absorbed by the thought of our
  separation and the distance that divides us&mdash;I wish only that you would
  feel something of what your absence makes me suffer&mdash;but no, I would not
  have you realising how it is with me&mdash;for I wish to spare you the
  chagrin such knowledge and pity would give you. Yet I must admit that the
  first grief of a heart hitherto tranquil is very cruel&mdash;I feel
  overburdened, but I will not complain. My deep tenderness for you in some
  sort consoles me in my violent grief that would be insupportable if I did not
  recall that my present misfortune is owing to past happiness. Nay, I'll not
  complain, yet my present situation is frightful&mdash;I'll not regret the
  peace that preceded it because there is nothing on earth that I care about,
  save being loved by you.</p>

  <p>I flatter myself that I shall always enjoy this happiness&mdash;at least I
  shall occupy myself with nothing but trying to please you, and I swear to
  you, my dear master, a fidelity as durable as my attachment is violent. I can
  add nothing to the force of this expression, truly not knowing how to write
  what I feel. My sensations are so new to me that while acknowledging their
  power, I cannot define them. I beg you to explain to your own heart all the
  embarrassment of mine and often to tell yourself that you are, of all the men
  in the world, the most tenderly loved.</p>

  <p>I add to these sentiments an esteem that must fetter a love whose only
  merit is its purity. Do not forget, I implore you, your poor little wife, and
  remember that I am, even more than I have admitted, in a state that merits
  pity. I swear that if I were only thinking of myself, death would seem the
  best way out, for surely in Glory I shall always have a formidable
  rival&mdash;at best we shall share your heart&mdash;when Glory commands you
  will risk your life whether I permit or not. Reflect on that, my dear master,
  recalling too that my sole hope lies in your safety, that you alone can make
  me happy.</p>

  <p>I can talk of nothing but myself to-day, for I think of nothing but
  you&mdash;all else is to me insupportable. I embrace you with all my heart
  and would purchase with half my life a favourable reception for this
  letter.</p>

  <p>THE COUNTESS DE BONNEVAL.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p class="footnote">[Madame de Bonneval's second letter contained only a
  timid regret at the unkindness she was receiving from her jealous
  mother-in-law, the Marquise de Bonneval, and a timid hope that her husband
  would not be prejudiced against her by his mother's baseless complaints.<br>
  <br>
  A short note from M. de Bonneval making light of her troubles was his wife's
  only comfort during the intense heat of that summer of 1707. Languishing in
  health the girl withdrew to the country with her sister, Madame de Gontaut.
  From Puteaux she wrote on July 16 to Bonneval, then commanding an infantry
  regiment in Vienna.]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II</p>

  <p>I have been staying with M. le duc de Guiche and M. and Madame de Gontaut,
  my dear cousin, for three days. Into this solitude I have brought an inquiet
  heart, for you are careless and out of neglect you may allow one or two posts
  go without writing&mdash;indeed it is already three weeks since I even heard
  any news of you. All the other Frenchmen who are with your army write home
  with great regularity&mdash;this increases my uneasiness, surely you cannot
  be the only one that cannot find a moment to say how you are! I beg you to
  send a line by M. Prescheu, merely to say that you are well. You don't know
  how to love if you are not capable of so much attention; only put yourself
  for a moment in my place&mdash;and though you have much less tenderness for
  me than I have for you&mdash;imagine what my state must be! I know that you
  are exposed to constant peril and I have not your fortitude that could help
  me endure this anxiety. I deserve pity, too, because I have to endure your
  neglect&mdash;in that word lies all my torment. A nature such as mine is at
  the mercy of a happy life. I am likely, my dear master, to suffer through
  excess of tenderness for others&mdash;is it not true, though unjust, that one
  does always suffer when one loves sincerely? I know few that do so love, and
  truly, they are wise that avoid this rare virtue.</p>

  <p>As for myself, I have not even sought any relief or cure, I have given
  myself entirely to this keen and sincere attachment in which my formal duty
  and my inclination blend so perfectly. In any case these complaints are your
  own fault, if you would write you would not receive them&mdash;without you,
  without your letters what can I have but complaints? My mother tells me that
  she will write to reproach you, she, my father and myself have already taken
  the liberty to blame your neglect&mdash;but if, when I am with my parents I
  agree with them, as soon as I am alone I make a thousand other&mdash;and
  sad&mdash;reflections.</p>

  <p>To-morrow I shall go to Paris, so that, if there are any letters from you,
  I may have them a little sooner. M. and Madame de Gontaut wonder at your
  silence&mdash;everyone who loves you takes that licence. Our charming
  sister-in-law is so perfectly made to receive attention, that she is
  astonished when she does not do so. I can't finish, my dear cousin, without
  telling you, that you are, of all men, the most tenderly loved. If these
  sentiments vex you, summon all your patience, for I feel that they will be
  eternal.</p>

  <p>THE COMTESSE DE BONNEVAL.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[The anxious journey to Paris proved in vain, and with an
  impulse of pride the Countess wrote:]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER III</p>

  <p>My vexation increases with your carelessness, and I am as persistent in
  tormenting myself as you are in neglecting me&mdash;however, though I cannot
  change my heart I can try to learn your maxims, one of which seems to be that
  one can love in perfect silence. You might have warned me of this before and
  so have spared me the surprise that such singular conduct arouses.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[No letter arrived, and, once more humble and resigned,
  Judith de Gontaut wrote again on August 6:]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IV</p>

  <p>I have had no news from you by the last two posts. I am glad that the
  other Frenchmen in your army have not also forgotten their country&mdash;if
  it were not from what I hear of you from them, I should be in continual
  alarms as to your safety. But&mdash;if you love me you will understand that
  being reassured as to your health by strangers is a species of vexation and
  torment&mdash;however, as far as I can see, love is a stranger to you. As my
  reproaches may weary you, I must cease&mdash;besides, I believe them to be
  useless. I frequent all those families that receive letters from Hungary in
  the hopes of hearing some news of you. M. de la Blaud was a great help to me,
  for he received a letter from you dated July 2nd, and my last was June
  25th.</p>

  <p>I have quite a deal of news&mdash;M. Croizot often visits his son, and so
  do I, for they talk of you. You will think me very simple, but I
  love&mdash;and my duty supports my attachment. Adieu, my dear cousin, return
  to one her heart, to one who never gave it away but to you&mdash;a heart
  sacrificed without any return. The Chevalier de Fontanges sends you a
  thousand compliments, I like him very much, he is an honest fellow, for he
  says that your silence greatly angers him. M. de Lauzun will soon hate you if
  you do not write&mdash;he sends you a thousand greetings, as does his wife
  and the Abbé de Gontaut&mdash;yet he says that his blessing on our union was
  not very effective.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[M. de Bonneval did not write, but one of his friends,
  newly returned from Vienna, told the patient wife that her husband's silence
  was owing to the fact that her letters had gone astray; this the poor girl
  could not believe&mdash;besides, could he not have written on his own
  impulse?]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER V</p>

  <p>We act on very different principles, my dear cousin. I hear that you will
  not write to me in order to punish me for a supposed irregularity in sending
  to you&mdash;while I have been writing without receiving any replies. Either
  method might be meant tenderly, but custom is on the side of that I employ. I
  cannot understand what has become of my letters&mdash;ever since your
  departure I have written every week. I should have done so oftener, had I not
  feared to weary you with an affection I could never endure that you should
  find importunate. My tenderness, however, is so deep that it does not perish
  for lack of that return that I hardly dare now to hope for. How cruel are
  such sentiments! I feel nothing but fatigue, fear and a profound
  discouragement! I no longer <i>live</i>, and the feeble existence left to me
  I would willingly sacrifice if I might escape the torments I endure. Indeed I
  am in a lamentable condition and I will not write any more for I do not wish
  to sadden you.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Belgrade fell, a peace was made with the Porte, and the
  Comte de Bonneval became one of the heroes of the hour and more than ever the
  idol of the French Court; his resplendent personality was exactly suited to
  the flamboyant taste of the times; in the midst of his joyous triumph the
  brilliant soldier remembered his wife and wrote to her after a silence of six
  months. She replied in a transport of delight.]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VI</p>

  <p>It is difficult, my dear cousin, for a heart penetrated with tenderness to
  express itself&mdash;how many different emotions have I felt in how short a
  time! I have followed all your movements with a joy that I have not been able
  to moderate&mdash;yet I was alarmed for you and intolerably uneasy as to your
  safety&mdash;now I feel a little reassured, a little tranquil after the
  horror of alarmed suspense. What a delicious moment was that in which I
  learned not only of your good health but of the victory that everyone says
  was mainly due to you! Though I am not vain it was impossible not to feel
  flattered by all this talk about you&mdash;I could not take a step without
  hearing your eulogies!and these were given in a fashion that did, I must
  admit, seduce my ear and touch my heart. Is it not fair that I should have
  some part in the glory that you have acquired at such a cost to the
  tranquillity of my soul&mdash;for truly, as long as you were in danger, I
  could count more on your valour than on prudence that I know is confined to
  your regard of others and takes no care for your own safety&mdash;though you
  should consider this, as you do not belong to yourself alone...never was a
  situation equal to mine, nothing can express my feelings until I received
  your letter...I assure you, my dear master, that during the whole of my life
  I shall never forget your kindness in writing to me at a moment when that
  alone could have saved me from despair. If you could know how touched I am by
  this attention, you would not be wearied by learning the impression that it
  has made on my heart...I feel that I was born to love you to all
  eternity...It is in your power, my dear master, to render me&mdash;by your
  tenderness, the happiest of beings&mdash;I desire nothing but this and lack
  of it would prove my sole sorrow...though I owe some affection to my family,
  there is nothing in my heart but you, always you.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Madame de Bonneval, waiting a reply to this letter,

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VII</p>

  <p>CHOISY, Oct. 1st.</p>

  <p>I am here, my dear cousin, in the most beautiful place in the world, and
  with the most charming company. I ought to be tranquil, but, amid all that
  used to satisfy me entirely, I find myself uneasy. I feel that it would cost
  me less to separate myself from all that I used to hold dear, than from my
  dear master. I am with my father, my mother and Madame de Gontaut, for whom I
  have an incomparable attachment&mdash;but there are sentiments so strong that
  all others must be sacrificed to them. I did not mean to write to you to-day,
  but the Parisian post arrives and leaves again so conveniently that I cannot
  forbear troubling you for a moment&mdash;a little moment. You are so
  continually in my heart&mdash;and my soul so accords with my heart&mdash;that
  I find in this correspondence a resource that before I was thus moved I had
  no need of&mdash;whether you write or no, I shall never cease to be
  preoccupied by the thought of you...</p>

  <p>M. de Bonrepos passes, at present, his life in grief, my absence from
  Paris afflicts him profoundly, and even when he is with me he is very sad!
  Can you explain to me this profound sentiment? If you could see this manner
  of loving you might be a little uneasy&mdash;as for me, I am very touched and
  feel my fidelity a little endangered&mdash;I don't know, indeed I don't, if
  my tenderness for you will be proof against this sentiment&mdash;yet I could
  tell you, if you asked me.</p>

  <p>I embrace you with all my heart, and vow a constancy proof against every
  temptation, even M. de Bonrepos.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[The subject of Madame de Bonneval's delicate coquetry
  was a very old man and devoted family friend, warmly attached to the forsaken
  young girl who, soon after writing the above letter, returned to Paris and
  the hôtel de Biron, where she lived retired from the world awaiting the
  letters that never came and obtaining news of her husband at second-hand.<br>
  <br>
  She followed eagerly the details of the campaign in Hungary and prayed for a
  peace that would enable her to join her husband or him to return to Paris.
  Thus withdrawn from society, Madame de Bonneval devoted herself to charity
  and piety; she was sincerely religious and the absence of any reference to
  this side of her character in her letters is due to the fact that her husband
  forbade her to mention religion to him, declaring that he detested a pious
  woman.<br>
  <br>
  No letters arrived from Hungary for Madame de Bonneval and she did not write
  again until the end of the year when she was slowly recovering from an attack
  of smallpox.]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VIII</p>

  <p>Perhaps you have heard, my dear cousin, that you were nearly a widower. I
  was at the last extremity owing to an attack of smallpox, but I was not yet
  acceptable to God. I awaited the cruel approach of death, I received the
  Sacraments, and awaited, not without firmness, the fate that must come to
  all&mdash;a little sooner, a little later&mdash;is the same to me. As regards
  myself, I flatter myself that Time, the great consoler, would have promptly
  comforted you, and even, by an ordinary miracle, soon have persuaded you that
  you never had had a wife. That, my dear cousin, was the judgment that I made
  on your behalf, and it consoled me greatly in my regret in being forever
  separated from a happiness that was never anything but a flattering delusion.
  I only heard your news fifteen days after it arrived; my father kept your
  letters from me and I have not been able to do any of your business. My
  father told me, through the window where I see him sometimes (I am lodged
  near him) that he had done what he could, but I do not think that will be
  much...If you do not feel my pleasure in writing to you&mdash;do not tell me
  so, my affection, my attachment, merit a better return.</p>

  <p>I caught the smallpox when I was staying with my father and at once left
  his house to lodge with M. de Saint-Frémont, who offered me his house&mdash;I
  forgot to tell you that this good friend is in the country, and so gave you a
  moment of cruel suspense on his behalf! Meanwhile, if your fortunate laziness
  permits you to send him a line on his kindness to me, it would be very well
  received&mdash;but, if this appears to you too burdensome, take it that I
  said nothing.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[The letters from her husband to which Madame de Bonneval
  refers were brief notes telling her to accustom herself to "an inevitable

  February 1718 the young wife wrote again to Vienna, where her husband was in

  believe that my heart, quick to feel both good and evil, always tries to
  incline to the first and to turn from all that is unpleasant.</p>

  <p>I am continually preoccupied by everything that appertains to you. I no
  longer say much about our separation, for it is easier to be silent than to
  speak <i>feebly</i> of what one feels <i>violently</i>. However, as you have
  begun to think of me at all, continue&mdash;and imagine what my situation is!
  It is truly sad enough. I hardly knew you, I anticipated loving you, in
  telling you that you had all my heart. I then lost you through an absence as
  long as our acquaintance had been short. These reflections are hard for me to
  endure&mdash;but I hope that sometimes they will occur to you, though I do
  not ask of you that you allow them to make the impression on you that they do
  on me. I fear too much vexation of this kind will disgust you with the object
  that causes it&mdash;yet I hope that some such reflections will make you
  return to a little monster&mdash;for surely so I must appear to you after
  this long penitence.</p>

  <p>Is Peace never to come? I see there is little hope of seeing you again, if
  you must continue this Hungarian campaign; it is not without pain that I make
  this renunciation and I believe that there are few examples of such a
  sacrifice&mdash;but have it as you wish! You always held that submission was
  a woman's part&mdash;I have my share when I give up that which is rightly

  <p>M. d'Aremberg's people say that you will never return to France. Is that
  true?...All your relations send you a thousand compliments&mdash;your mother

  was lost, seemed to regret me. My mother embraces you and always loves you.
  As for my father, I do not concern myself with his messages, for we do not
  get on very well together. I cannot pardon him for being the pretext for your
  absence, and I often overwhelm him with reproaches&mdash;but he defends
  himself extremely well and at the end I feel there is truly no one to blame
  but yourself. So, indeed, I don't know what to do about it. You don't let me
  know if you have received the packet that I sent by M. le comte? I should
  like to know. You are not very precise in acknowledging what I send you, but
  I'll take care not to murmur, for I know the value of your time&mdash;and
  that if I insist too much upon myself I shall become an insupportable
  burden.</p>

  very flattering to the interests of Glory. I send you my compliments on a
  distinction that must mean much to a warrior attached since his birth to the
  god Mars&mdash;but find it reasonable&mdash;that a woman, brought up to
  render homage to other deities feels this joy troubled by all the fears that
  tenderness and timidity can inspire. I do not however wish you to think that

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XII</p>

  <p>I did not mean to write to-day, my dear cousin, fearing to weary you, but
  my father said that he was writing to you and asked me to add one of my
  letters to his&mdash;perhaps you will not disapprove of the impulse that
  makes me obey him&mdash;an impulse that proves that you still inspire me with
  tender sentiments, and are still the master of my heart and of all my
  actions. Your last letter shows me that you do not resent the reproaches that
  I made you on your silence. I am charmed that, though I never put you in the
  wrong, you allow me to be in the right. This is the happiest thing that could
  happen to me, for, if it came to an issue as to which of us was at fault, I
  should without hesitation decide against myself&mdash;you are guiltless and I
  have been too impatient in all that concerns us. Yet I cannot regret anything
  that was inspired by my deep tenderness, though I would have this expressed
  with all possible delicacy. This delicacy must, for my part, always exist
  between us&mdash;I promise you that it shall. I am very glad to hear that
  sometimes you not only speak of me but take my part. I hope that you do not
  follow too closely the example of a certain great Prince, who, when at the
  head of his armies, appears to think of nothing but fame&mdash;for it is
  whispered abroad that this hero does not disdain the tender passion&mdash;it
  is even said that he is not too difficult as to the object of his adoration.*
  I don't pretend to revenge my own pain by attacking the charms of a more
  fortunate creature, but it is said that if she inspires affection, so might
  I.</p>

  does not know if it would reach your Germany. Let him know at once. You did
  not charge me with this commission&mdash;perhaps you were right in not
  thinking me capable of executing it&mdash;but M. Gontaut would have helped
  me. I am not vexed that you asked my father's aid, but, another time,
  remember that you are master of a creature who longs to perform your wishes,
  who is jealous of your orders and who is attached to you by the tenderest
  bonds that ever existed. The duc de Brancas complains of your silence&mdash;I
  tell you so that you can write to me if you judge proper. M. de Lauzun
  assures me that he will be vexed if I do not remember him to you in all my

  <p>I am very much obliged to you, my dear cousin, for the attention that you
  have paid me by letting me know the honour that the Emperor has done you in
  allowing you the monopoly for your steel invention. I am charmed that this
  has procured me one of your letters. You have for a long while deprived me of
  these and I have attributed your silence to a natural indifference&mdash;the
  usual effect of a slight acquaintance and a long absence. It is, however,
  certain that I have not deserved it. I suffered much from the rumours I heard
  as to your embroilments with Prince Eugène, but I did not write to you about
  it as you said nothing of it to me. When our friends become our enemies I
  believe them very dangerous; I am disposed to believe that the first wrong
  was not yours, but I hope that the first overture will be. I wish very much
  that you would be friendly with this Prince, though I know you could not
  stoop to any falsity in order to be so&mdash;certainly, any such falsity
  would be worse than certain disgrace. I hope greatly that you will obtain the
  satisfaction that you require&mdash;but my star is not lucky and my wishes
  can do no more for your glory than they have been able to do for your
  personal happiness. Do not, however, my dear cousin, think that I envy my
  sisters their happy marriages&mdash;they are fortunate, but when one hears a
  certain name consecrated to glory one takes a pride in being sensible of it
  and learns patience for a grief that is without a remedy. I never thought
  that your destiny would be limited to your present situation. I hope that,
  sooner or later, you will be fully recompensed for your services, and I beg
  you to believe that this hope is for you more than for myself&mdash;my
  personal desires are so simple. In a very little time, in all good faith, I
  attached myself to you. I am sincere. This affection has cost me much
  suffering&mdash;but this has never effaced a sentiment that makes me always
  desire your kindness&mdash;as the only thing that can render me happy.</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Jonathan Swift, in the first rank of European men of letters and the
  foremost English satirist, was of a Yorkshire royalist family and was
  educated at Kilkenny Grammar School and Trinity College, Dublin. Through the
  influence of a relative, Swift, who had been born after his father's death
  and who was poor, proud and bitter, entered the elegant establishment of Sir
  William Temple at Moor Park, as secretary. The long credited story that he
  was shamefully treated there rests only on his own evidence and is almost
  certainly false. At Moor Park he met "Stella," Hester Johnson, the daughter
  of the housekeeper, or as some hinted, of more mysterious origin. Ambitious,
  jealous and restless, Swift, in the hope of rapid preferment, was ordained in
  1694, and after being assured by his cousin, John Dryden, that he would never
  be a poet, returned to Moor Park, where he read and brooded while editing
  Temple's huge diplomatic correspondence. After writing two successful books,
  <i>The Tale of a Tub</i> and <i>The Battle of the Books</i>, on the death of
  Temple, Swift returned to Ireland where he obtained several small livings and
  took his D.D. at Dublin 1701. His vigorous talents as a political pamphleteer
  attracted the attention of the Whigs, and Swift allied himself with them and
  coming to London moved in the most brilliant and influential society of the
  day. His longed-for preferment did not, however, arrive and in disgust Swift
  allied himself with the Tories 1710. For the next four years the dangerous
  genius of Swift was active in the Tory cause, but again he received no
  reward; he was the most feared man in England and his position in the Church
  accorded so ill with the nature of his writings that even the most cynical of
  ministers would not have dared to give him a bishopric.</p>

  <p>Furious and disgusted, Swift retired to Ireland on the death of the Queen
  (1714); he was soon followed by Esther Vanhomrigh, who had a small property
  in that country and who had fallen passionately in love with the dark,
  difficult and dazzling man.</p>

  <p>Swift had been corresponding for years with Esther Johnson, then
  established modestly in Ireland with Mrs. Dingly. A whole literature has
  grown up round the relations of these three people; all that is certain is
  that Esther Vanhomrigh discovered the existence of Esther Johnson, and died
  of the shock occasioned by this and the fury with which Swift turned on her;
  Mrs. Vanhomrigh directed her executors to publish the poem "Cadenus and
  Vanessa" that Swift had written for her, which related their strange
  love-affair. It has been believed that Swift secretly married Stella and that
  the knowledge of this killed Vanessa, but there is no proof.</p>

  <p>The three-cornered love story remains one of the great mysteries of
  literature; the solution is probably to be found in the character and
  physical disabilities of Swift himself, in his jaundiced, warped and bitter
  outlook and in those mean qualities that marred his greatness. He long
  survived both the women whose lives he gilded and ruined, became gradually
  insane and died, in the most miserable fashion, in an asylum. He left a
  considerable portion of his fortune to found a hospital for the insane. He
  was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, beside Stella, and underneath his own
  inscription, surely the bitterest ever permitted in a Christian church. His
  most famous works belong to the period after the death of Vanessa;
  <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> was published in 1726.</p>

  <p>Esther Vanhomrigh was of Dutch descent; her father was a wealthy merchant
  and she was possessed of considerable property; her mother's house in London
  was used as freely as if it had been his own home by Swift, and Esther was
  encouraged to hope for marriage; delays, disappointments and bewilderment
  threw her into a state of nervous exasperation in which she lost control of
  reason and made the fatal mistake of pursuing and goading the dangerous man
  on whom she had set her affections until he turned on her and killed her with
  his violence.</p>

  <p>She seems to have been a handsome, lively, elegant creature, something of
  a blue-stocking and something of a fool, but it is impossible to pronounce
  judgment on any of the characters in this ambiguous story. The letters of
  Swift and Vanessa appeared in the complete edition of Swift's works, edited
  by Sir Walter Scott&mdash;they were transcribed from the originals in the
  British Museum, dated and carefully edited by Mr. Martin Freeman in:
  <i>Vanessa and her Correspondence with Jonathan Swift</i>, Martin Freeman;
  Selwyn and Blount, 1921.</p>

  <p>The difficult nature of the correspondence is increased by the fact that
  several letters have been lost on either side and it is not always possible
  to place correctly, as regards date, the order of those that remain. The
  sequence arranged by K. Martin Freeman has been followed in this selection,
  and the numbers in brackets refer to the numbers in his edition.</p>

  <p>Swift's love letters to Stella are embodied in the famous "Journal to
  Stella" and often couched in the "little" or code language; the tender
  passages in these long letters are also often addressed to a dual
  personality, Mrs. Dingly and Stella. For these reasons it was found
  impossible to give coherent and interesting extracts from the journal in any
  form that could justly be termed love letters.</p>

  <p>Some code words are obviously employed in the following letters, notably
  <i>coffee</i>. Many surmises have been made as to the meaning of this; the
  most likely seems to be love or love-making, but what kind, degree, or type
  of love it is impossible to decide; these lovers, though writing only for
  each other, never completely betray themselves.<br>

  shall think it so. Oh! what would I give to know how you do at this instant.
  My fortune is too hard: your absence was enough, without this cruel
  addition.</p>

  <p>Sure the powers above are envious of your thinking so well, which makes
  them at some times strive to interrupt you. But I must confine my thoughts,
  or at least stop from telling them to you, or you'll chide, which will still
  add to my uneasiness. I have done all that was possible to hinder myself from
  writing to you till I heard you were better, for fear of breaking my promise,

  <p><i>Endorsed: 4th</i></p>

  <p>June, LONDON, 1713.</p>

  <p>SIR,</p>

  <p>Mr. Lewis assures me that you are now well, but will not tell me what
  authority he has for it. I hope he is rightly informed; though ''tis not my
  usual custom, when a thing of consequence is in doubt, to fix on what I
  earnestly wish. But I have already suffered so much by knowing that you were
  ill, and fearing you were worse then, I hope, you have be[en], that I will
  strive to change that thought, if possible, that I may have a little ease;
  and more, that I may not write you a splenetic letter.</p>

  <p>Pray why would not you make Parvisol write me word how you did, when I
  begged it so much? And if you were able yourself, how could you be so cruel,
  to defer telling me the thing of the world I wished most to know? If you
  think I write too often, your only way is to tell me so, or at least to write
  to me again, that I may know you don't quite forget me; for I very much fear
  that I never employ a thought of yours now, except when you are reading my
  letters, which makes me ply you with them. Mr. Lewis complains of you too. If
  you are very happy it is ill-natured of you not to tell me so, except 'tis
  what is inconsistent with mi[ne]. But why don't you talk to me? That, you
  know, will please me. I have often heard you say that you would willingly
  suffer a little uneasiness, provided it gave another a vast deal of pleasure.
  Please remember this maxim, because it makes for me. This is now the fourth
  letter I have wrote to you. They could not miscarry, for they were all under
  Mr. Lewis's cover; nor could you avoid opening them, for the same reason.</p>

  <p>Pray what have you done about the two livings? Have you recovered them or
  no? You know I love law-business. I have been with lawyers since I saw you,
  but have not yet had their answers, therefore won't trouble you with what I
  have done till I can tell you all. Pray let me know when you design coming
  over, for I must beg you to talk to Mr. P[artinton] and settle some affairs
  for me. Pray let me hear from you soon, which will be an unexpressible joy to
  her that is always&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[With the next letter the correspondence takes on a new

  passion on her side, of impatient alarm on his, breaks through the ambiguous

  <p>LARACOR, July 8th, 1713.</p>

  <p>I stayed but a fortnight in Dublin, very sick, and returned not one visit
  of a hundred that were made me&mdash;but all to the Dean, and none to the
  Doctor. I am riding here for life, and think I am something better, and hate
  the thoughts of Dublin, and prefer a field-bed and earthen floor before the
  great house there, which they say is mine. I had your last spleenatic letter.
  I told you when I left England, I would endeavour to forget everything there,
  and would write as seldom as I could. I did indeed design one general round
  of letters to my friends, but my health has not yet suffered me. I design to
  pass the greatest part of the time I stay in Ireland here in the cabin where
  I am now writing, neither will I leave the kingdom till I am sent for; and if
  they have no further service for me I will never see England again. At my
  first coming I thought I should have died with discontent, and was horribly
  melancholy while they were installing me; but it begins to wear off, and
  change to dulness. My river walk is extremely pretty, and my canal in great
  beauty, and I see trouts playing in it.</p>

  <p>I know not any one thing in Dublin; but Mr. Ford is very kind, and writes
  to me constantly what passes among you. I find you are likewise a good
  politician; and I will say so much to you, that I verily think, if the thing
  you know of had been published just upon the Peace, the Ministry might have
  avoided what hath since happened. But I am now fitter to look after willows,
  and to cut hedges, than meddle with affairs of state. I must order one of the
  workmen to drive those cows out of my Island, and make up the ditch again; a
  work much more proper for a country vicar than driving out factions and
  fencing against them. And I must go and take my bitter draught to cure my
  head, which is spoilt by the bitter draughts the public bath given me.</p>

  <p>How does Davila go on? Johnny Clark is chosen portreeve of our town of
  Trim; and we shall have the assizes there next week, and fine doings; and I
  must go and borrow a horse to meet the judges, and Joe Beaumont and all the
  boys that can get horses will go too. Mr. Warburton has but a thin school.
  Mr. Percival has built up the other side of his house, but people whisper
  that is is but scurvily built. Mr. Steers is come to live in Mr. Melthorp's
  house, and 'tis thought the widow Melthorp will remove to Dublin.</p>

  <p>Nay, if you do not like this sort of news, I have no better. So go to your
  Dukes and Duchesses, and leave me to Goodman Bumford and Patrick Dolan of
  Clonduggan.</p>

  <p class="cpi">Vanessa to Swift</p>

  <p><i>Endorsed: 4th</i></p>

  <p>DUBLIN, 1714.</p>

  <p>You cannot but be sensible, at least in some degree, of the many
  uneasinesses I am slave to&mdash;a wretch of a brother, cunning executors and
  importunate creditors of my mother's&mdash;things I can no way avoid being
  subject to at present, and weighty enough to sink greater spirits than mine
  without some support. Once I had a friend that would see me sometimes, and
  either commend what I did or advise me what to do, which banished all my
  uneasiness. But now, when my misfortunes are increased by being in a
  disagreeable place, amongst strange, prying, deceitful people, whose company
  is so far from an amusement that it is a very great punishment, you fly me,
  and give me no reason but that we are amongst fools and must submit. I am
  very well satisfied that we are amongst such, but know no reason for having
  my happiness sacrificed to their caprice. You once had a maxim, which was to
  act what was right and not mind what the world said. I wish you would keep to
  it now. Pray what can be wrong in seeing and advising an unhappy young woman?
  I can't imagine. You can't but know that your frowns make my life
  insupportable. You have taught me to distinguish, and then you leave me
  miserable. Now all I beg is that you will for once counterfeit (since you
  can't otherwise) that indulge[nt] friend you once were till I get the better
  of these difficulties, for my sister's sake; for were not she involved (who I
  know is not so able to manage them as I am), I have a nobler soul then sit
  struggling with misfortunes, when at the end I can't promise myself any real
  happiness. Forgive me; and I beg you'd believe it is not in my power to avoid
  complaining as I do.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[The tragic affair draws rapidly to a climax; Vanessa has

  <p><i>Endorsed: 6th</i></p>

  <p>DUBLIN, 1714.</p>

  <p>Well, now I plainly see how great a regard you have for me. You bid me be
  easy, and you'd see me as often as you could. You had better said, as often
  as you could get the better of your inclinations so much, or as often as you
  remembered there was such a one in the world. If you continue to treat me as
  you do you will not be made uneasy by me long. 'Tis impossible to describe
  what I have suffered since I saw you last; I am sure I could have bore the
  rack much better than those killing, killing words of yours. Sometimes I have
  resolved to die without seeing you more; but those resolves, to your
  misfortune, did not last long. For there is something in human nature that
  prompts one so to find relief in this world, I must give way to it, and beg
  you'd see me and speak kindly to me; for I am sure you'd not condemn anyone
  to suffer what I have done, could you but know it. The reason I write to you
  is because I cannot tell i[t] you, should I see you; for when I begin to
  complain, then you are angry, and there is something in your look so awful,
  that it strikes me dumb. Oh! that you may but have so much regard for me
  left, that this complaint may touch your soul with pity. I say as little as
  ever I can: did you but know what I thought, I am sure it would move you.
  Forgive me, and believe I cannot help telling you this, and live.</p>

  <p class="cpi">Vanessa to Swift</p>

  <p>CELBRIDGE, 1720.</p>

  <p>Believe me 'tis with the utmost regret that I now complain to you, because
  I know your good nature such, that you cannot sec any human creature
  miserable without being sensibly touched. Yet what can I do? I must either
  unload my heart and tell you all its griefs, or sink under the unexpressible
  distress I now suffer by your prodigious neglect of me. 'Tis now ten long,
  long weeks since I saw you, and in all that time I have never received but
  one letter from you, and a little note with an excuse. Oh &mdash;&mdash; how
  have you forgot me! You endeavour by severities to force me from you; nor can
  I blame you, for with the utmost distress and confusion I behold myself the
  cause of uneasy reflections to you. Yet I cannot comfort you, but here
  declare that 'tis not in the power of art, time or accident to lessen the
  unexpressible passion which I have for &mdash;&mdash;. Put my passion under
  the utmost restraint, send me as distant from you as the earth will allow,
  yet you cannot banish those charming ideas, which will ever stick by me
  whilst I have the use of memory. Nor is the love I bear you only seated in my
  soul, for there is not a single atom of my frame that is not blended with it.
  Therefore don't flatter yourself that separation will ever change my
  sentiments, for I find myself unquiet in the midst of silence, and my heart
  is at once pierced with sorrow and love. For Heaven's sake tell me what has
  caused this prodigious change in you, which I have found of late. If you have
  the least remains of pity for me left, tell me tenderly. No, don't tell it,
  so that it may cause my present death; and don't suffer me to live a life
  like a languishing death, which is the only life I can lead if you have lost
  any of your tenderness for me.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XI [40]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Vanessa to Swift</p>

  <p>CELBRIDGE, 1720.</p>

  <p>Tell me sincerely if you have once wished with earnestness to see me since
  I wrote to you. No, so far from that, you have not once pitied me, though I
  told you how I was distressed. Solitude is unsupportable to a mind which is
  not easy. I have worn out my days in sighing, and my nights with watching and
  thinking of &mdash;, &mdash;, &mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, (<i>sic</i>) who
  thinks not of me. How many letters must I send you before I shall receive an
  answer? Can you deny me in my misery the only comfort which I can expect at
  present? Oh! that I could hope to see you here, or that I could go to you. I
  was born with violent passions, which terminate all in one&mdash;that
  unexpressible passion I have for you. Consider the killing emotions which I
  feel from your neglect of me, and shew some tenderness for me, or I shall
  lose my senses. Sure, you cannot possibly be so much taken up but you might
  command a moment to write to me, and force your inclinations to do so great a
  charity.</p>

  <p>I firmly believe, could I know your thoughts (which no human creature is
  capable of guessing at, because never anyone living thought like you), I
  should find that you have often in a rage wished me religious, hoping then I
  should have paid my devotions to Heaven. But that would not spare you, for
  was I an enthusiast, still you'd be the deity I should worship. What marks
  are there of a deity but what you are to be known by? You are present
  everywhere; your dear image is always before eyes; sometimes you strike me
  with that prodigious awe, I tremble with fear; at other times a charming
  compassion shines through your countenance, which revives my soul. Is it not
  more reasonable to adore a radiant form one has seen, than one only
  described?</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Swift does not appear to have answered these desperate

  <p>August 7th, 1722.</p>

  <p>I am this hour leaving my present residence, and if I fix anywhere, shall
  let you know it; for I would fain wait till I get a little good weather for
  riding and walking, there never having been such a season as this remembered;
  though I doubt you know nothing of it but what you learn by sometimes looking
  out at your back windows to call your people. I had your last, with a
  spleenatic account of your law affairs. You were once a better solicitor,
  when you could contrive to make others desire your consent to an Act of
  Parliament against their own interest to advance yours. Yet at present you
  want neither power nor skill, but disdain to exercise either. When you are
  melancholy, read diverting or amusing books: it is my receipt, and seldom
  fails. Health, good humour and fortune are all that is valuable in this life,
  and the last contributes to the two former.</p>

  <p>I have not rode in all above poor four hundred miles since I saw you, not
  do I believe I shall ride above two hundred more till I see you again. But I
  desire you will not venture to shake me by the hand; for I am in mortal fear
  of the itch, and have no hope left, but that some ugly vermin called ticks
  have got into my skin, of which I have pulled out some and must scratch out
  the rest. Is not this enough to give one the spleen? for I doubt no Christian
  family will receive me. And this is all a man gets by a northern journey. It
  would be unhappy for me to be as nice in my conversation and company as you
  are, which is the only thing wherein you agree with Glass-heel, who declares
  there is not a conversable creature in Ireland except Cad&mdash;&mdash;. What
  would you do in these parts, where politeness is as much a stranger as
  cleanliness?</p>

  <p>I am stopped, and this letter is intended to travel with me, so adieu till
  the next stage.</p>

  <p><i>August 8th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday I rode 28 miles without being weary,
  and I wish little Heskinage could do as much. Here I leave this letter to
  travel one way while I go another, but where I do not know, nor what cabins
  or bogs are in my way. I see you this moment as you are visible at ten in the
  morning; and now you are asking your questions round, and I am answering them
  with a great deal of affected delays; and the same scene has passed forty
  times, as well as the other from two till seven, longer than the first by two
  hours, yet each has <i>ses agrémens particuliers</i>.</p>

  <p>A long vacation, law lies asleep, and bad weather: how do you wear away
  the time? Is it among the fields and groves of your country seat, or among
  your cousins in Town, or thinking in a train that will be sure to vex you and
  then reasoning and forming teasing conclusions from mistaken thoughts? The
  best companion for you is a philosopher, whom you would regard as much as a
  sermon. I have read more trash since I left you than would fill all your
  shelves, and am abundantly the better for it, though I scarce remember a
  syllable. Go over the scenes of Windsor, Cleveland Row, Ryder Street, St.
  James's, Kensington, the Sluttery, the Colonel in France, etc. Cad thinks
  often of these, especially on horseback, as I am assured. What a foolish
  thing is Time, and how foolish is man, who would be as angry if time stopped
  as if it passed. But I will not proceed at this rate, for I am writing and
  thinking myself fast into the spleen, which is the only thing I would not
  compliment you by imitating. So adieu till the next place I fix in, if I fix
  at all till I return, and that I leave to fortune and the weather.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:50%">&mdash;JULIE DE LESPINASE</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Julie De Lespinasse was given to dwelling with bitter gloom on the
  circumstances of her birth that deprived her of all the privileges belonging
  to her rank, and sent her, penniless, into a world where she had no
  legitimate place. All that is known for certain of her parentage is that she
  was the daughter of a noble lady, the Comtesse d'Albon, who bore her in
  secret, using an assumed name, in Lyon, November 18, 1732. Julie was
  registered as the child of two non-existent people; but the name of the
  fictitious father, Lespinasse, was also that of one of Madame d'Albon's
  estates, and that which the child always bore. The childhood of Julie de
  Lespinasse is obscure, but her mother found means to keep her near her and to
  give her a brilliant education, probably in the establishment of her
  half-brother, the Vicomte d'Albon. On the death of her mother in 1747, Julie,
  then old enough to realise the mystery of her origin and the misery of her
  position, was sent to live with her half-sister, Diane, eldest legitimate
  daughter of Madame d'Albon, who had married the Marquis de Vichy-Chamrond and
  lived with him at his manor house of Avauges, near Lyon. This nobleman was
  the brother of the famous Madame du Deffand; his wife was ten years the
  senior of Julie, then aged seventeen years, and there was a family of three
  children, the eldest of whom was eight years old. Julie had handed over to
  her half-brother a large sum in cash that her mother had given her when
  dying, and so had nothing but an annual income of a hundred écus that Madame
  d'Albon had left her by will. She took up a position as governess with the de
  Vichy-Chamrond and became very attached to her pupils, but the five years
  that she spent at Avauges were, under a monotonous appearance, tragically
  unhappy for Julie, who never spoke of them without horror or disgust, and
  afterwards declared that no romance by Prèvost or Richardson could equal the
  terrors of life with the de Vichys and that she preferred to throw herself
  into a cloister to continuing to live with them.</p>

  <p>The dark secrets at which Julie so passionately hinted were never
  disclosed during her lifetime nor for many years afterwards, but it is now
  believed that M. de Vichy Chamrond was Julie's father; that, after having
  been the lover of Madame d'Albon, he married her daughter, Diane, and was
  therefore Julie's father and her brother-in-law. This peculiar relationship
  does not seem to have been handled tactfully or kindly, and Julie, outraged
  in pride and sentiment, was glad to accept the offer of Madame du
  Deffand&mdash;her paternal aunt&mdash;to live with her as her companion in
  the Convent Saint-Joseph, Paris. This was in 1754 and for ten years the
  charming and brilliant young woman was the faithful slave of the blind,
  jealous and exacting Marquise. Then came a complete rupture between these two
  remarkable women; Madame du Deffand discovered that her poor companion was
  entertaining her choicest friends secretly when she, the Marquise, was
  sleeping.</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse, then firmly established as "the Muse" of the Parisian
  intellectuals, left the convent of Saint-Joseph and established her own
  <i>salon</i> in the rue Saint-Dominique. All Madame du Deffand's friends
  gathered round Julie who contrived an elegant modest existence on her little
  pensions (she had two from the Court) and an income of a thousand <i>écus</i>
  yearly given her by Madame Geoffrin&mdash;"that was all her fortune." A year
  after she had left Madame du Deffand, Julie accepted the famous d'Alembert as
  a lodger in her apartment and he resided with her until her death; he was
  forty-one years of age, in poor health, shy and timid with women; he
  cherished a deep affection for Julie; whether she was, as David Hume crudely
  stated, his mistress, or merely his friend and his nurse, is not certain. It
  was Mademoiselle de Lespinasse's wish and hope to make a marriage suitable to
  her charms and social success, but a difficulty in the way was the mystery of
  her birth and the penury of her circumstances; after a brief tenderness for
  an Irishman, M. Taaffe, Julie engaged herself to a noble Spaniard, N.
  Pignatelli, Marquis de Mora, eldest son of the Spanish plenipotentiary to
  France, the Comte de Fuentes. She was then thirty-five years of age and her
  lover was ten years younger. They were passionately in love, but the Marquis,
  handsome, gifted, brilliant, wealthy, found it impossible to induce his
  family to consent to his union with the socially non-existent middle-aged,
  sickly, pock-marked woman with whom he was so deeply enamoured.</p>

  <p>The betrothal was kept so secret that even d'Alembert did not know of it
  and Mora left for Spain shortly before his father's term of office was over
  in 1792, without any arrangement having been made for his marriage. He had
  already shown symptoms of the disease&mdash;tuberculosis&mdash;from which his
  mother had recently died, and was soon sent to the soft airs of Valencia in
  the hopes of curing his illness and causing him to forget the French
  enchantress.</p>

  <p>These hopes proved fruitless, Mora's disease increased steadily and his
  burning passion for Julie did not diminish; nor did she cease to think of him
  with tenderness and affection. Meanwhile, however, she had met the man who
  was the hero of fashionable Paris, a brilliant soldier, a second-rate writer,
  a virile fascinating personality, the darling of the Court and the
  <i>salons</i>, Jacques, Comte de Guibert. Julie, thirty-eight years of age,
  in poor health and pledged to Mora, fell, nevertheless, into a headlong
  passion for de Guibert. The short remainder of her life is the story of her
  struggle between these two loves. The Comte de Guibert was eleven years
  younger than Julie, of an ardent, volatile temperament and idolised by all
  the fashionable beauties of France. Julie de Lespinasse, however, succeeded
  in firing him with something of her own burning ardour and the two became
  lovers in February 1774; at almost the same time, M. de Mora, defying his
  doctors, tried to reach Paris in order to see his beloved again and died on
  the journey, at Bordeaux, May 27 of that year. This news overwhelmed Julie
  with regret, with remorse and horror, and she threw herself more frantically
  than ever into her love-affair with de Guibert; jealousy of her handsome,
  fascinating and popular lover was added to her torments, she began to take
  opium to relieve her sufferings and the last two years of her life were
  little else than a continual delirium produced by the passions of her heart
  and soul acting on her feeble body. Her death-blow was the marriage of de
  Guibert with Mademoiselle de Courcelles (May 1775); this was supposed to be
  merely a <i>mariage de convenance</i> but de Guibert soon fell in love with
  the fresh charms and the exquisite tenderness of his young bride. Tortured
  now beyond endurance, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse increased her suffering by
  larger doses of opium, and after long-drawn-out agonies died in May 1776.
  None of her friends knew of her love-affair with de Guibert, and it was not
  until after his death that his widow found and published a large portion of
  the letters (1809) that Julie had written during the stormy progress of her
  secret tragedy. They were published again in 1811 together with a eulogy of
  Julie, written in the style of Sterne by M. de Guibert, and some fragments,
  also in the manner of Sterne, by Julie herself. These letters (a hundred and
  eighty in the first edition) are perhaps the most famous love letters ever
  written; for fire, sincerity, wit, depth of feeling, a passionate abandonment
  to emotion and a remarkable felicity of expression they have never been
  surpassed. In their sequence over three years, they tell and illustrate a
  story full of drama, romance, remorse, jealousy and lofty idealism struggling
  with physical passion that makes other love stories pale beside it; the
  complete sincerity of these letters cannot be doubted; they were written for
  one reader only, in complete secrecy, with no thought that any other eye
  would see them. This is in great contrast to the care with which the letters
  of Madame' Sand and Alfred de Musset were preserved for posterity by their
  writers. Most of de Guibert's side of the correspondence is lacking; the
  inference is that Julie destroyed it; he does not seem to have behaved as
  meanly as might appear on the surface, but merely according to the standard
  of the times, and the licence allowed to a 'hero' of his brilliance and
  success. He never ceased to treat Julie with tenderness and respect, even
  when he was most unfaithful, and it seems probable that Julie forced the pace
  and swept him into a passion that he would not have sought himself. Julie de
  Lespinasse was a plain woman, sadly disfigured by smallpox, tall, thin,
  elegant with a sumptuous taste in dress; she owed her charm, which amounted
  to an enchantment, to the fire and animation of her words and gestures, to
  that exquisite vivacity that showed in all that she did or wrote, to that
  mingled intelligence and passion which made her one of the most celebrated
  women of her time.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER I [2]</p>

  <p>Sunday, May 22, 1773.</p>

  <p>If I were young, pretty and very charming, I should not fail to find much
  artifice in your conduct towards me, but as I am nothing of that, as I am the
  opposite of that, I find in you a kindness, an honesty that will give
  you&mdash;for ever&mdash;a right over my soul which you have filled with
  gratitude, <i>esteem</i>, with sensibility, and with all the sentiments that
  put intimacy and confidence in a friendship. I shall not speak so well as
  Montaigne on the subject of friendship, but, believe me, we shall feel it
  better. If you had been in his place could you have consented to live after
  the loss of such a friend?* But that is no matter, what concerns me is you,
  is the grace, the delicacy, the propriety of your quotation. You come to my
  aid, you do not wish me to be wrong in my own eyes, you do not want your
  memory to be a sad reproach to my heart, an offence, perhaps, to my
  self-respect; in a word, you want me to enjoy in peace the friendship that
  you offer, and that you prove by so much gentleness and pleasantness; yes, I
  accept it, I shall turn it to my advantage, it will console me, and if ever I
  enjoy your society, that will be a pleasure that I shall feel and relish
  above all others. I much hope that you will pardon me a wrong that I have not
  done. You must feel that it would be impossible to suspect you of anything
  that would be against goodness and honesty. I have, however, made such
  accusation against you&mdash;it only proves that I am weak and wrong, and
  above all that I am troubled to the point of not being able to preserve my
  presence of mind or the freedom of my understanding. You see things too well
  and too quickly for me to need to fear that you will ever believe yourself
  despised by me; I am sure, indeed, that your soul will never have to complain
  of the feelings that animate mine.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* An allusion to Etienne de Boétie, for whom Montaigne
  wrote his famous chapter, <i>De l'Amitié</i>.]</p>

  <p>I know that you only left on Thursday at half-past five o'clock. I was at
  your door two minutes after you left; I sent that morning to know what time
  you had left on Wednesday, and to my great surprise I learnt that you were
  still in Paris, and that it was not even certain that you would go on
  Thursday. I went myself to learn if you were, perhaps, ill, and what will
  seem frightful to you, I even wished that you were so. However, by an
  inconsequence that I cannot explain to you, I was comforted to learn that you
  had left. Yes, your absence has restored my calm, but it has increased my
  sadness. You must pardon this, and feel content about it; I do not know if I
  regret you; but I wish for you, as I would for a pleasure, and I believe that
  energetic and sensitive souls attach themselves very strongly to that; it is
  not the idea of the length of your absence that afflicts me, my thought does
  not fly so far ahead; it is merely the present that burdens my soul, that
  saddens it, weighs it down and leaves me without even enough energy to desire
  a better disposition. But how horribly personal I have been! Here are three
  pages full of myself, and yet I believe that it is you that I am occupied
  with; at least I feel the need of knowing how you are, the state of your
  health. When you read this&mdash;good Heavens, how far away you will be! Your
  body will be only three hundred leagues away, but how far your thoughts will
  have gone! What new objects, ideas and reflexions will surround you! I feel
  as if I spoke to your shadow. All that I have known of you has disappeared,
  and you will with difficulty find any trace in your memory of the affection
  that agitated and animated you during the last days that you passed in Paris.
  You know well that we convinced ourselves that sensibility is a sign of
  mediocrity and your character destines you to be great&mdash;your talents
  condemn you to celebrity. Abandon yourself, then, to your destiny, and firmly
  assure yourself that you were not made for that sweet, intimate life which
  demands tenderness and sentiment. There is but little pleasure and no glory
  in living for a single object. When one reigns only in one heart, one does
  not reign in public opinion. Some names were made to be written in history;
  yours will, one day, excite admiration. When I let this thought absorb me it
  moderates a little the interest that you have inspired in me. Farewell.</p>

  <p>Having thus opened a correspondence with de Guibert, Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse continued it while he was with the army; from May to October she
  wrote sixteen more letters full of a growing passion; with the late autumn
  the army went into winter quarters and de Guibert returned to Paris; popular
  and fascinating as he was, he was enchanted by the letters of Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse and they met as declared lovers, as is shown by the following
  letter written soon after his return from Vienna.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II [20]</p>

  <p>Half-past eight o'clock, 1773. (November.)</p>

  <p>My friend, I shall not see you, and you will tell me that it is not your
  fault!&mdash;Ah, if you had the thousandth part of my desire for a meeting,
  you would be here and I should be happy. No, I am wrong. I should suffer, but
  I should not envy all the pleasures of Heaven. My love, I love you as one
  ought to love, to excess, with madness, with transports, with despair. You
  have put my soul to the torture all these past days, I saw you this morning
  and all was forgotten and it seemed to me that I did not do enough for you in
  loving you with all my soul, in being ready to live or to die for you. You
  are worth more than all that; yes, if I only knew how to love you it would
  indeed be nothing, for what is pleasanter and more natural than to love to
  madness one that is so fitted to inspire love? But, my love, I can do better
  than love, I can suffer, I know how to renounce my own pleasure for your
  happiness...do you know why I write to you? Because it pleases me. You would
  never have doubted it, even if I had not told you so. But, good Heavens,
  where are you? If you enjoy happiness, I must no longer complain that you
  have taken mine away.</p>

  reduced to this? You will understand one day&mdash;alas, you understand now.
  It is frightful to me to be no longer free to suffer for you and through you.

  <p>Thursday, half-past eight, 1774.</p>

  <p>My love, I love you; I feel that now in a painful manner. Your chill, your
  painful chest, shake me to the soul; I am full of terror and this frightful
  sentiment has been so often justified that I know not how to calm myself. If
  you leave to-night, you will not sleep and that will fever you. Ah, heavens,
  why cannot I suffer all that I fear so that you need not suffer at all? My
  love, when you change horses at Orleans, send word how you are, and if your
  chest is better. My tender interest in you does not permit you to neglect
  your health. I die of regret in thinking that I shall not see you again, I
  have no means of reassuring myself about you. I shall not see you. I shall
  know nothing of you. Ah, it was sweet to love you yesterday, it is cruel to
  love you to-day, to-morrow and always! My love, pardon my weakness, see if my
  superstition can excuse it; it was <i>Friday</i> August 17th, 1772, that M.
  de Mora left Paris*; it was <i>Friday</i> May 9th this year that he left
  Madrid, and on the 29th of that month I lost him for <i>ever</i>. Imagine if
  that terrible word carries terror into my soul when it is joined to the
  thought of him whom I love more than life, more than happiness, more, far
  more than I have words to express. My love, if, by some chance, you do not go
  until Saturday, I shall see you to-morrow. What a horrible project I had
  conceived&mdash;not to see you! That would be impossible, as you well know.
  You also well know that when I hate you it is because I love you with a
  degree of passion that unsettles my reason. Farewell, farewell, my love,
  never were you loved and cherished with so much tenderness. Look after
  yourself, remember that for you to take care of your chest is to save my
  life. To-morrow! That is to me a frightful thought. Yes, I love you, a
  thousand times more than I can tell you.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VII [56]</p>

  <p>Monday, October 3rd, 1774.</p>

  <p>Ah, my love, my soul is sick! I have no more words, I have no more
  lamentations. I have read, I have re-read, I shall read your letter a hundred
  times. Ah, my love, how much evil mingled with good, what pleasure joined
  with the most cruel bitterness! This reading has increased, redoubled all the
  agitations of my heart, I can no longer calm myself. You have alternately
  entranced and torn my soul; never have I found you more lovable, more worthy
  of being loved; and never have I been filled by a more bitter, profound,
  sharp sorrow evoked by the memory of M. de Mora. Yes, I shall die of it, my
  heart was so oppressed last night that I lost my reason; an emotion so
  violent must kill me or make me insane. Alas, I fear neither death nor
  madness; if I loved you less, if my regrets were less dear to me, with what
  delirium, with what transport I should deliver myself from this life that
  overwhelms me! Ah, never, never, has any creature lived in this torture and
  this despair. My love, we turn to poison the only good in nature, the only
  good that man cannot spoil or corrupt. Everything in the world is valued and
  paid for in terms of money; respect, happiness, friendship, virtue even, all
  that is bought, paid for, judged of in terms of gold; there is only one thing
  that is above opinion, that must remain stainless as the sun, which it rivals
  in a life-giving heat that vivifies the soul, enlightens it, makes it
  stronger, greater. Ah, my love, have I any need to name this gift of nature?
  When it does not make the happiness of the soul that it fills, one must die.
  Ah, yes, one must die, I submit, I have need of death; you have been so
  cruel! What do you mean to do with the life that you have saved? Fill it with
  trouble and tears? Add the torment of remorse to the most frightful
  unhappiness? Make me detest every second of my days? And yet bind me with a
  passion that devours my heart, that, twenty times a day, presents itself
  before me like a crime? Ah, God, I am guilty and the Heavens be my witness
  that nothing is dearer to me than virtue and that it is only you that have
  dazzled me astray! And you believe that I threw myself alone into the abyss?
  I must not, then, impute to you either my faults or my misfortunes. Ah, I
  wish to expiate them. I saw the terror of my miseries when I hated you. I was
  stronger than death. Why, by what fatality have I found you again? Why did my
  fear that you were ill soften my soul? And, last, why do you destroy and
  console me at the same time? Why this brutal mingling of pleasure and grief,
  poison and balm? All this works with too much violence on a soul already
  exalted by passion and misfortune, all this helps to destroy an organism
  already exhausted by sickness and lack of sleep. Alas, I tell you, in the
  depth of my trouble that I do not know if it is you or death whose pity I
  implore, or if it is by you or by death that I must be cured for ever; nature
  can do nothing more for me. Alas, does there remain to me a wish, a desire, a
  regret, a thought of which neither you nor M. de Mora is the object? My love,
  I have believed that my soul was dead, I assure you, I found some sweetness
  in that oblivion. But, dear God, how fugitive was that respite! It was but
  the effect of prolonged doses of opium. Truly, I shall return to my senses
  and entirely lose that calm. But, tell me, how is it possible that I have not
  yet spoken of you? That I have not said that I fear a return of your fever,
  that I hope to have news of you to-day, when the post arrives? If I do not
  receive any, I shall not blame you, but I shall suffer until Wednesday.
  Farewell, my love. Your goodness, your gentleness, your truthfulness have
  filled my heart with tenderness and sensibility.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VIII [70]</p>

  <p>Sunday, ten o'clock at night. Nov. 13th, 1774.</p>

  <p>Ah, my love, you wrong me&mdash;and for us both this sentiment that
  animates me is indeed a curse. You are right to tell me that you have no need
  to be loved as I know how to love, not, that is not to your measure; you are
  so perfectly charming that you must be, or will become, the first object of
  the affections of those delightful ladies, who put outside their heads more
  than what they have inside, and who are so amiable that they love themselves
  above everyone else. You are the pleasure, the last gratification of the
  vanity of nearly every woman. By what fatality did you recall me to life,
  only to make me die of trouble and grief? My love, I do not complain of you,
  but it afflicts me that you do not put any value on my peace of mind; this
  thought alternately preys and tears me. How can one have an instant's peace
  with a man whose behaviour is as reckless as his driving, who cares nothing
  for dangers, who never foresees anything, who is incapable of little cares,
  of any exactitude, who never puts through a project, in a word a man
  attracted by everything but whom nothing can stop or fix? Oh, my God, my God,
  it is in your wrath, in the excess of your vengeance, you have condemned me
  to love, to adore one that must become the torment and the despair of my
  soul. Yes, my love, what you term your faults may kill me, but they will
  never make me cold towards you. If my will, my reason, my reflection were of
  any use to me, should I love you? Alas, in how short a time have I been
  thrust into, cast down the abyss of unhappiness! I still shudder! The only
  means of recalling a sweet feeling in my soul, would be to think that I might
  see you to-morrow; but is it worth while to count on this happiness? Perhaps
  your carriage has broken down, perhaps some accident has happened to you,
  perhaps you are still at Chanteloup, in brief, I fear everything, and nothing
  consoles me. My love, it is not enough for you to vex me, you must also
  confuse me. First I am to write to you at Chanteloup, and then in your last
  letter from Bordeaux you say that perhaps you will not go to Chanteloup. Ah,
  well, heavens, what does it serve to bring you to book, if you corrected your
  faults should I love you less? Good night. Every time anyone opened my door
  this evening my heart began beating fast, there were some moments when I
  feared to hear your name, others when I was overwhelmed not to hear it. All
  these opposite feelings, all these contradictions are explained in three
  words&mdash;<i>I love you</i>.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IX [92]</p>

  <p>Midnight (Feb. 10), 1775.</p>

  <p>Midnight strikes, and I, my love, am struck by a memory that freezes my
  blood. It was on the tenth of February last year that I was intoxicated with
  a poison the effects of which I still feel.* In this moment it alters the
  circulation of my blood which it carries with increased violence to my heart,
  filling it with agonising regrets. Alas, by what fatality must the sentiment
  of the liveliest pleasure be joined to the most overwhelming unhappiness!
  What a frightful union! Should I not say to myself when I recall that moment
  of mingled horror and pleasure&mdash;I saw a young man, with a glance full of
  life and sensibility, come towards me, his face expressed sweetness and
  tenderness, his soul seemed animated by passion. At this sight I was filled
  with fright mingled with pleasure&mdash;I dared to raise my eyes, to fix my
  glance on him, I advanced, my senses, my soul, were frozen, I saw him
  advance, sorrow, in a mourning habit, held his arm, she stopped me, tried to
  hold me off, yet, by a fatal attraction I was drawn on. Speaking from the
  depth of my distress, I asked, "Who art thou, who fillest my soul with alarm
  and tenderness, terror and charm! What news dost thou bring me?" "Unfortunate
  one," he replied with a sombre air and a sad accent, "I am your Destiny. He
  who animated your life is now struck by Death." Yes, my love, I heard these
  fatal words&mdash;they are engraved on my heart, which still shudders, which
  loves you! In pity let me see you tomorrow; I am full of sadness and trouble.
  Ah, my God, that hour was just a year ago when M. de Mora was struck the
  mortal blow, and I, in the same instant, two hundred leagues away, I was more
  cruel, more guilty than the ignorant barbarians who killed him. I perish with
  regret; my eyes and my heart are full of tears. Farewell, my love. I ought
  not to love you.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER X [120]</p>

  <p>My love, I delight in looking for and meeting you everywhere, in talking
  to you incessantly, in seeing you, and listening to you&mdash;always. I wrote
  to you at Bordeaux, at Montauban, and then again to-day to Bordeaux, and all
  this uselessly, perhaps, for if you must be here on the first, you will be on
  the way by the 26th or the 27th. Better so. You will not have my letters, but
  I shall see you, and it is difficult for me to believe that this pleasure
  will only end in pain&mdash;you are so gentle, so amiable, so sensible that
  perhaps I shall not feel anything but delight. But why have I not had your
  news by the last courier? Do you never have any time to come to the help of
  someone who suffers? Yes, yes, I suffer, I suffer greatly, my entrails do
  their best to distract me from the suffering of my soul. I had yesterday
  frightful pains; I passed the morning in my bath and so obtained a little
  ease. My friend, return&mdash;but, even if you do, I shall not see
  you&mdash;there will be some other woman, a tragedy to get on the boards,
  your duties&mdash;after these what time will you have for an unhappy creature
  who only exists to suffer and to love? Yes, I feel that I am condemned to
  love you as long as I breathe, when my strength is exhausted by pain I love
  you with tenderness, when I am animated, when my soul has some energy, I love
  you with passion. My love, the last sigh I breathe will be an expression of
  this sentiment. Farewell. If you read this, reply to it and do not think that
  you will arrive sooner than your letter. My love, be careful not to come to
  see me when I have people here. I left you here, I have frightful pains. I
  love you, and I believe that this is not merely because I <i>have</i> loved
  you.</p>

  <p>I understand very well, you write me charming notes, but you are killing

  Réaumur. This concentrated cold, this state of perpetual torture, casts me
  into such a profound discouragement that I have not the strength to wish for
  relief. In truth, what could I wish for? All that remains for me to feel is
  not worth the trouble of experiencing it, ah yes, one must reach oblivion. I
  do not repulse either your pity or your generosity. I believe that you do
  wrong in refusing them to me. You ought to preserve at least the illusion

  yesterday morning, and I fear that I shall never reach this evening. I shall
  see you then; and my torments will be eased. Ah, Heavens, my body has no
  longer the strength to support my soul&mdash;it kills me. Good day, my love,
  I love you more deeply, better than you have ever been loved before. Yes, my
  cough shakes me, I have been ill, but I shall see you. Ah, you will be

  that will make me say incessantly, "How slowly, for the unhappy, time

  that Madame your wife is ill. It seems to me that her health is very
  delicate, that makes her more interesting. I have begged M. d'Alembert to go
  and learn your news, because I feared that I should not have a moment to
  write to you. He will let me know if you are going to Versailles...Good
  Heavens! It is late indeed for you to concern yourself about my misfortunes.
  Forget the cause of them and you will not be troubled by the consequences;
  all I ask of you is to remain well disposed. That should be easier to you,
  than finding <i>great opportunities</i> of serving me, <i>great dangers</i>

  you will pardon them. But I shall not revive. Why this eagerness to make me
  live? The answer may be, that no one has loved better than I have. Ah,
  Heavens! this merit has been repaid by thirty years of suffering, with death
  at the end. I do not know if that will encourage our scribbling ladies. I
  shall see Bordeu* to-morrow at four o'clock; that is to feel the knife at
  one's throat. Do not come here then...Good night, you are so <i>charming</i>,

  <p>Why do you suppose that I am inspired by a frightful intention?* Consider
  if I have either the strength or the disposition! And it would show lack of
  delicacy and of tact to allow myself to feel resentment when I have arrived
  at the point where I have no need of either defence or vengeance. My love, I
  am dying; that satisfies everything, that fulfils everything. But do you know
  what should be the outcome of the frightful suspicion that you have had? Calm
  for yourself&mdash;to whom my danger has given a moment of rigour; you must
  become colder, harder and fly from an unhappy creature who can no longer
  inspire anything but sadness and alarm. Yes, indeed, you must thus steel
  yourself, so that when my end arrives you do not suffer. This is what my
  generosity and my interest for your tranquillity advises and it comes from
  the bottom of my soul.</p>

  That would have been less fatal to me than these efforts to persuade me to

  <p>At half-past six, 1776.</p>

  <p>I could neither read nor write nor dictate at eight o'clock when I
  received your note. I was in a convulsion of coughing and pain that only
  passed an hour after I received your letter. My agonies were at such a point
  this morning, that I was threatened with an inflammation. I did everything
  possible to obtain some relief, and you will understand that, in this crisis,
  my door had to be closed to everyone; the Archbishop of Aix and two other
  people were refused two hours before you came. Eh, good Heavens, what do you
  ask&mdash;why I exclude you? And you did not see me yesterday! All this
  concern, these sentiments are only reasonable when one believes that one is
  loved or expects happiness, and in my condition there is no longer expectancy
  or hope, I only sigh after a little ease...Good day, then, I am going to bed,
  do not come to-morrow morning; until four o'clock (in the afternoon) my doors
  will be closed to everyone without exception. I am no longer mistress of my
  ills, they have taken possession of me, and I have surrendered to them. Do
  not imagine that I have no desire to see you, but I die of regret in thinking
  of the sad manner in which you passed the other evenings with me, when you
  have your own home, and all manners of pleasures. No sacrifices, my friend!
  Sick people repulse all these efforts to help them&mdash;nothing can do much
  for them!</p>

  by convulsions, and she often did not wish to leave a hideous image of
  herself in her lover's memory. She contrived, however, to write at least
  seven more letters to de Guibert, who called constantly at her apartments;
  her health was a matter of so much concern to all fashionable and

  not time to send to Versailles then, and I thought that you would have gone
  home before coming here, I had sent there my thanks for your attention, so
  charming, so full of kindness. Your concern touches me so much that I am
  sorry that I cannot please you by saying that I am better; but I cannot do
  so, the coughing convulsions nearly killed me yesterday. Last night the fever
  was so strong that my ideas were even wilder and more confused than ever; I
  saw my doctor, at eleven o'clock this morning; he found more fever than I
  usually have, due to irritation&mdash;my chest, my entrails are as burnt up,
  as distressed as my soul. But, my dear, I love you, and if you could return
  that love, I should have the strength of a martyr&mdash;I should suffer, I
  should prefer my agonies to all the happiness there is in the world...Ah, my
  love, look after yourself, do not torment me any more, do me no more
  harm&mdash;but, do not go to the other extreme, do not make me believe that
  my life is necessary to you. I should then be too much to be pitied, for I

  worse, my body or my soul. This suffering goes so deep that I have come to

  to you, to be in my bed, to lamenting and sharing&mdash;with sweet
  sadness&mdash;my sorrow with you&mdash;I remember that you told me that you
  liked to stay at home on <i>Tuesdays</i> and <i>Thursdays</i>. Your kindness
  made you forget this, but I remind you&mdash;I give you back your promise. My
  love, never have I less wished you to make sacrifices for me. Alas, you see
  that I am not in a state to enjoy anything! I only beg you, do not turn the
  knife in my wound. That is the limit of all my wishes. It seems to me that if
  you wished, you might go to Versailles less frequently&mdash;My friend, if I
  see you to-morrow, bring me the rest of your <i>Travels</i> and my blue
  booklet; if you have them ready to your hand, give them to my
  servant...Indeed, I have hardly the strength to hold my pen, all my faculties
  are employed in suffering. Ah, I have arrived at the end of my life and it is
  nearly as painful to die as to live; I fear pain too much. The sufferings of
  my soul have exhausted my strength. My love, support me, but do not suffer in

  feel all the value of your emotion, but I no longer deserve it. There was a
  time when to have been loved by you would have left me nothing to wish for.
  Alas, perhaps that would have stifled my regrets, or at least have lessened
  their bitterness, and I should have wished to live. To-day I only wish to
  die. There is no recompense for, no possible softening of, the loss that I
  have had; it cannot be survived. This, my dear, is the only trace of
  bitterness against you, that I find in my soul&mdash;I should like to know
  your future&mdash;I much hope that you will be happy. I received your letter
  at one o'clock; I had then a burning fever. I cannot tell you how much pain
  and time it took to read it, it nearly made me delirious, but I did not wish
  to put it off until to-day. I await your news this evening. Farewell, my
  love. If ever I return to life, I shall employ it again in loving you, but
  now there is no longer time.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[This is, according to the incomplete edition of
  Mademoiselle de Lespinasse's letters published by Madame de Guibert in 1809,
  the last letter written by Julie to her lover. M. de Ségur, however, who made
  exhaustive researches into this famous love story, dates the above letter May
  11 and says that Julie scribbled a few more lines to de Guibert on the
  morning of the day that she died, May 23; this does not agree with the
  account given by La Harpe, an eye-witness of the last scenes of Julie's
  illness, that she was incapable even of movement for the last three days of
  her life. In any case the above letter is clearly intended as a farewell and
  as that is left here. La Harpe relates that Julie's last words during a brief
  interval of consciousness were: "Do I still live?"<br>
  <br>
  Her implacable enemy, Madame du Deffand, gave Julie a bitter epitaph&mdash;"A
  pity that she could not have died fifteen years earlier, then I should not
  have lost d'Alembert."<br>
  <br>
  D'Alembert himself came to regard the memory of Julie with bitterness, almost
  with horror; on going through her papers he found evidences of her love for
  de Mora. "I have wasted fifteen years of my life!" he wrote; "and I am sixty
  years old...all that was mine is lost and nothing remains for me but to
  die."<br>

  <p class="cp"><b>MADAME DU DEFFAND</b></p>

  <p>Marie de Vichy Chamrond was born into the ranks of the highest French
  aristocracy; her family came from Burgundy; the Duchesse de Choiseul was her
  grandmother, her nephew was Cardinal Loménie de Brienne; one of her brothers
  became a <i>maréchal de camp</i>, the other treasurer of the Sainte-Chapelle,
  Paris; one of her aunts was the Duchesse de Luynes, the intimate friend of
  Marie Leczinska, Queen of Louis XV. Thus closely connected with the great
  ones of France during the period of its most flashing brilliance,
  Mademoiselle de Vichy Chamrond received the orthodox education accorded to
  girls of her noble birth; she was trained in the Parisian convent of la
  Madeleine de Trenelle and there developed not only a lively wit and a piquant
  beauty but a fashionable scepticism in religious matters. While very young
  she was married to a wealthy noble, the Marquis du Deffand, whom she soon
  discovered to be feeble and tedious; taking advantage of the cynic licence of
  society under the Regent&mdash;the duc d'Orléans&mdash;Madame du Deffand soon
  left her husband and established herself as one of the famous
  <i>salonnières</i> of the day. She shared with Mesdames de Tenein and
  Geoffrin the honour of entertaining, amusing and inspiring most of the famous
  men of the century, among whom were Diderot, Fontenelle, Montesquieu,
  d'Alembert, Turgot and Mormontel. Her wit, her elegance, her culture, her
  cynicism, her fine taste, were all exquisitely in harmony with her time and
  greatly pleased her contemporaries. Her love-affairs were graceful, heartless
  and brief; she was believed to have held the volatile fancy of the Regent
  himself for a fortnight and to have benefited by this to the extent of a
  pension for life.</p>

  <p>Among her many caprices was a brief return to her husband; the reunion
  lasted six weeks and the light cold woman, soon bored by convention, returned
  to a licence that scandalised even her friends and tarnished a reputation
  that had been early breathed upon.</p>

  <p>She then formed a permanent connexion with M. Hénault; it was said that
  her affection for him lasted because never having had life it could not
  die&mdash;this long <i>liaison</i> became a matter of habit to the cold
  lovers and was founded on a common respect for each other's intelligence and
  wit.</p>

  <p>At the age of fifty-five this selfish, dissipated woman, who had no ties,
  no responsibilities nor any cares beyond those of procuring her own
  pleasures, became totally blind. Her brilliant mind surmounted even this
  calamity; she retired to a suite of apartments in the convent of Saint-Joseph
  in the rue Saint-Dominique and gathered round her the most interesting,
  gifted and important people of the day, the <i>grands seigneurs</i>, the
  philosophers, artists, men of letters and all foreigners of distinction and
  prestige; Madame du Deffand neither loved nor esteemed this brittle, dazzling
  world, but it amused her and helped her to keep at bay the gnawing boredom
  that was the result of her selfish, dry heart, her mocking, malicious
  wit.</p>

  <p>As she could not, however, always be presiding at suppers or be
  incessantly the centre of a gathering of brilliant intellectuals, the blind
  Marquise sought for a constant companion or rather slave to serve her as
  eyes. She found this in a poor young girl then established in the household
  of her brother, the Comte de Vichy Chamrond, in Burgundy. This Julie de
  Lespinasse, as she was named, was illegitimate, of an origin then completely
  mysterious; it is now believed that she was the daughter of M. de Vichy
  Chamrond by the Comtesse d'Albon, whose daughter Diana he afterwards married.
  The life of the blind woman was at first greatly enriched by the company of
  this charming creature, who, however, soon obtained a social success that
  roused the malice of her exacting mistress, who became with increasing years
  and infirmities more and more difficult, arbitrary and jealous. The Marquise
  literally "turned night into day"; since her perpetual darkness made all
  hours the same to her she fell into the habit of beginning her entertainments
  about midnight, going to bed at ten o'clock in the morning and rising at six
  o'clock in the evening.</p>

  <p>These hours not suiting everyone, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse gradually
  came to receive visitors while the Marquise was in bed; this being
  discovered, Madame du Deffand cried out on the black ingratitude of her
  protégée and dismissed her; Mademoiselle de Lespinasse established a
  <i>salon</i> of her own and though she was too poor to offer the simplest
  refreshment, Madame du Deffand's friends nearly all forsook her for her
  younger rival; even M. Hénault chose the fascinating Julie, and Madame du
  Deffand received, in one icy blast, that heartlessness which she had herself
  meted out in several portions to others. As she refused to receive anyone who
  went near Mademoiselle de Lespinasse, her circle of acquaintance became
  drastically limited; she remained, however, in the centre of the intellectual
  and social life of France, had intimate connexions in Court and politics and
  was visited by nearly all foreigners with any claim to importance who visited
  Paris.</p>

  <p>Among these was Horace Walpole (1709-97), third son of Sir Robert Walpole,
  dilettante, <i>flâneur</i>, man of fashion and one of the finest and most
  penetrating wits of the day. When he presented himself before the blind woman
  in the hooded chair, who was approaching her seventieth year, Walpole was
  himself fifty years of age, disillusioned, troubled by gout, nearly as
  cynical and heartless as Madame du Deffand herself. Educated at Eton and
  Christ Church, Cambridge, Walpole had early received several lucrative
  sinecures and had travelled extensively and fastidiously in France and Italy
  with Thomas Gray. Three times member of Parliament, he settled at Strawberry
  Hill, Twickenham, in 1749, where he built himself a little Gothic castle or
  abbey, to house his remarkable collection of curios.</p>

  <p>Here he set up his private press and here he wrote his elegant
  <i>opus</i>, including the famous sham Gothic romance <i>The Castle of
  Otranto</i>, and compiled the incomparable letters that are his surest title
  to remembrance; his romance appeared in 1764, and the following year he
  visited Paris and began his friendship with Madame du Deffand.</p>

  <p>This love story&mdash;for so it was, on the woman's side at
  least&mdash;was surely one of the strangest ever to be recorded. She seventy,
  he nearly fifty, both cold, dry, cynical, lazy, selfish, finding a bitter
  amusement in observing the failings and miseries of others, despising
  everything but the bric-à-brac of the mind, and the pretty <i>objets
  d'art</i> that could be handled, valuing nothing but wit, <i>bon ton</i> and
  any fastidious escape from engulfing boredom&mdash;both without ties,
  affections or loyalties.</p>

  <p>Walpole, pale, elegant, effeminate, had been handsome and attractive in
  his youth, but at fifty he was vexed and fretted by gout, ravaged by sourness
  of spirit, roused to a peevish celibacy and very cynical in his temper.
  Moreover, his conversational honours in French were limited and he neither
  read nor wrote this language with facility; despite these handicaps the blind
  old woman loved the heartless Englishman as she had never loved
  before&mdash;loved him beyond the natural limits of her physical decay and
  those of her atrophised senses. Since she never saw him she must have formed
  some image of him in her own mind that was entirely satisfactory to herself;
  his personality as expressed in his letters and conversation she adored, and
  for the remaining fifteen years of her life he was her major interest, a
  passion, and several times an obsession. During this period he visited
  Paris&mdash;1769-71, and gave some of his time to waiting on the old, blind
  woman in her apartments in the convent Saint-Joseph; between these meetings
  they corresponded with great regularity; three hundred and forty-eight of her
  letters have been preserved; only a few of his remain, but his part of the
  correspondence must have been voluminous. Walpole was fascinated and
  flattered by the devotion of this celebrated woman, but he was also extremely
  afraid of being made ridiculous by it, and lived in constant dread lest the
  correspondence should be discovered by some unkind wit; he frequently, and
  with a harshness that amounted to cruelty, rebuked Madame du Deffand for the
  warmth of her sentiments and the romantic turn of her attachment. It is
  indeed doubtful if he would have tolerated her at all had it not been for the
  baits that she offered in the form of the long detailed accounts of
  contemporary affairs in France that she continually sent him. These were
  based on inside information and were couched in that language of wit and
  cynicism which alone was tolerable to the Lord of Strawberry Hill, and he
  could not resist these regular gazettes from Paris that furnished him with
  such delicious material for commentary and gossip when he retailed them to
  his exclusive circle.</p>

  <p>While, therefore, Madame du Deffand's cry was all for an exchange of
  tenderness, of exquisite sentiments, of all the delicate <i>nuances</i> of a
  platonic and intellectual love-affair, his cry was for news and more news;
  she satisfied him to the best of her exceptional opportunities and her
  brilliant abilities and these portions of her letters form invaluable
  material for the social historian; the selections given here are from the
  emotional passages that give them the right to be called love letters and are
  taken from the entire correspondence, of which, owing to limitations of
  space, they can give no more than a general idea.</p>

  <p>Madame du Deffand's letters to Horace Walpole were published in London,
  1810, by his friend and legatee, Miss Mary Berry, in four volumes in the
  original French with notes in English; an abridged French edition appeared in
  1811, a complete French edition in 1824. The following translations have been
  made from <i>Lettres de Madame du Deffand à Horace Walpole</i>, etc., Paris,
  1864.</p>

  <p>This fine edition contains an account of the Marquise by M. A. Thiers and
  copious quotations from the letters of Horace Walpole taken from his
  correspondence, published in London, 1810. These&mdash;in as far as they were
  to Madame du Deffand&mdash;are fragmentary; and none addressed to the
  Marquise appear in Peter Cunningham's edition of Walpole's correspondence in
  nine volumes, London, 1857-9. A complete edition, containing a large number
  of letters discovered since 1854, of Madame du Deffand's letters to Horace
  Walpole, appeared in Paris, 1912.</p>

  <p>It appears probable that either Madame du Deffand herself or her executors
  destroyed the bulk of these letters, and that only a few were returned to the
  Walpole estate. M. Wiart, the Marquise's faithful gentleman and servitor,
  wrote most of these letters from the blind woman's dictation; she was
  '<i>dame en chambre</i>,' and during the period covered by this strange
  correspondence and towards the end of her life, hardly left her apartments in
  the rue Saint-Dominique, where she passed her time between her hooded chair
  and her bed; her sole close companions, besides Wiart, were her cat and her
  dog, both detested by Walpole, who, however, finally gave an asylum to the
  latter.</p>

  <p>Racked by gout, tormented by insomnia, embittered by scepticism and
  disillusionment, snatching at anything that, in Lord Byron's phrase, helped
  to assist her to avoid conjugating the verb '<i>ennuyer</i>,' Madame du
  Deffand was only held to life by her affection for a man whom she had never
  seen, whom she rarely met and with whom she could only communicate with
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>A strange pendant to this strange story is the episode of Miss Mary Berry.
  About five years after the death of the Marquise, Horace Walpole, then
  seventy years of age, conceived the same belated and desolate tenderness for
  Mary Berry that Madame du Deffand had conceived for him, and offered to the
  young woman the shrivelled hand and shrunken heart that the Marquise would so
  eagerly have accepted; he was then (1791) Earl of Oxford, but the charming
  Miss Berry refused the offer with a delicacy that gave no offence, and she
  and her sister lived at Little Strawberry Hill on the terms of the
  pleasantest friendship with the ancient invalid, who left them and their
  father, Robert Berry, all his papers and manuscripts, including the letters
  from Madame du Deffand. Miss Berry also published the letters that Walpole
  wrote to herself and her sister; she died in 1852, at ninety years of
  age.</p>

  <p class="cp"><b>THE MARQUISE DU DEFFAND</b></p>

  <p>The first letter that Madame du Deffand wrote to Horace Walpole is dated
  two days after he had left Paris, after a stay of eight months, and indicates
  the stern rules he had laid down before he permitted any exchange of letters
  at all.<br>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER I [1]</p>

  <p>Saturday, 19th April, 1766.</p>

  <p>I was surprised to receive your letter yesterday; I did not expect it; but
  I see that one may expect anything from you.</p>

  <p>I begin by assuring you of my prudence, I do not find anything disobliging
  in your recommendation of this; no one shall know anything of our
  correspondence, and I will follow exactly all that you prescribe. I have
  begun already by hiding my grief and care from the President (Hénault) and
  except Madame de Lonsac, to whom I was forced to mention you, I have not
  breathed your name to a soul. With anyone save yourself, such a declaration
  would be repugnant to me, but you are the best of men and have such good
  intentions, that none of your words or actions can possibly be suspect. If
  you had admitted a little sooner what you felt for me, I should have been
  calmer, and, in consequence, more reserved. The desire of acquisition and of
  retaining an acquisition gives one an activity that touches, doubtless,
  imprudence&mdash;there is my story as regards yourself. Add to this
  explanation my age, my wish not to appear crazy, and ask yourself if you are
  not secure from any ridicule that I might bring on you. This being
  understood, and no one overhearing us, allow me to become completely at my
  ease and to tell you that it is not possible to love more tenderly than I
  love you. I believe that we are all, sooner or later, rewarded according to
  our merits, and the tenderness and sincerity of my heart have at last been
  satisfied, at the end of my life. Because of the happiness that I desire from
  you, I will not weary you with my thoughts, but only say that my pleasure is
  touched with sadness, for I know that you are likely to be long absent from
  me. I do not wish to make this letter into an elegy, however, therefore only
  beg you to keep your promise to write to me with the greatest freedom and to
  remember that I belong more to you than I do to myself. For my part, I shall
  render an account of all that happens to me, and chat with you as easily as
  if we were together again in the chimney corner...I do not ask you to write
  often; Saint Augustine declared "Love me and do as you please" and that is
  one of his best sayings.</p>

  <p>Remember that you are my guardian, my tutor, and do not neglect my
  education; I shall always be very submissive, but, above all, teach me what I
  can do to hasten and facilitate your return.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[This letter proved too outspoken for the taste of
  Walpole and drew forth a rebuke, to which Madame du Deffand replied in:]</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II [2]</p>

  <p>(Letter from Amiens.)</p>

  <p>Monday, 21st April, 1766.</p>

  <p>In reply to you&mdash;if you were a Frenchman I should not hesitate to
  believe you to be an imbecile, as you are an Englishman I shall merely
  consider you stupid. What do you mean, I beg you, by saying that I am given
  up to indiscretions and romantic transports? For the indiscretions&mdash;let
  that pass, but as for romantic transports&mdash;that makes me furious, and I
  should willingly scratch out those eyes of yours which they tell me are so
  handsome, but which you, surely, cannot think have turned my head. I try to
  think of something ingenious to write to you, but in vain&mdash;I am no
  longer at my ease in writing to you; you are so infatuate with your blessed
  "Notre Dame de Serig"* that I feel handicapped, not only can I not hope to be
  compared with her, but I feel that your passion for her makes all that does
  not resemble her appear flat and dull.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Madame de Sévigné, with whose letters Walpole was
  enraptured.]</p>

  <p>Let us return to your charge&mdash;romantic transports indeed! This to one
  the declared enemy of the least romantic trait; have I not always detested
  this ridiculous affectation and all who indulge in it, and now, at this time
  of day, I am <i>accused</i> of it!...Return, return to Paris and you shall
  see how I shall conduct myself, I feel, I vow, a great impatience for you to
  see the effects of your lessons and my indignation. I have from now on begun
  a new plan of conduct; I shall never more pronounce your name&mdash;that will
  vex me a little, I admit. I should have much pleasure in reading your letters
  over with someone who would appreciate their merit and laugh with me over
  them, but, in truth, were I to give rein to my natural imprudence and look
  for such a person, I should not be able to find anyone worthy of this
  confidence. Since your departure, all those about me appear more stupid than
  ever. I am afraid of falling into an insupportable boredom. When you were
  with me, I could divine what you thought, you knew what I thought and we did
  not hesitate to tell each other so. That time is passed, and God knows when
  it will return. Be Abélard, if you wish, but do not count on me for what I
  can never be, Héloïse. Did I ever tell you the dislike I have for their
  letters? I have been persecuted by every translation made of them and forced
  to listen to them; this medley or rather this <i>galimatias</i> of piety,
  metaphysics and sensuality seems to me false, exaggerated, disgusting. Please
  do not play Abélard with me&mdash;but if you wish&mdash;Saint-François de
  Sales, whom I like very much. I will readily be your Philothée&mdash;but
  enough of this. You know that I expect a letter from Calais? But that which I
  look forward to with real impatience is that which will be dated London.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[On these lines and these terms the correspondence
  continued; Madame du Deffand wrote to Strawberry Hill five or six times a
  month and all her letters were of considerable length, some even were written
  "de ma propre main," for she was able to trace a readable script, all,
  between the witty, brilliant, elegant gossip that she anxiously collected to
  please her exacting friend, contain heartfelt appeals for tenderness, for
  sympathy, for Walpole's return to Paris. His frequent attacks of illness rend
  her with pitiful anxiety, but any manifestation of this was harshly rebuked
  and Walpole refused, in peevish alarm, her suggestion that Wiart should be
  sent as a sort of liaison officer to Strawberry Hill. "Heavens, what have I
  become!" he wailed, "a hero of romance, a figure of comedy&mdash;and if I am
  either, who is the heroine?"<br>
  <br>
  Madame du Deffand, using courage, finesse and the grace of a great lady,
  persisted in sending the letters that frightened, mortified and yet
  fascinated Horace Walpole. The following note is given in the packet listed
  as:]</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER III [17]</p>

  <p>Saturday, November 1st, 1766, at four o'clock.</p>

  <p>What a misfortune, what a great misfortune for me, is the friendship that
  I feel for you. Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>, this feeling is very far from romantic
  and you knew me very little when you took it to be so! I love you only
  because I esteem you and believe that I have found in you all the good
  qualities that, during fifty years, I searched for, in vain, in others. This
  discovery charmed me so much that I allowed myself to become attached to you,
  despite my common sense that warned me that I was committing a folly and that
  a thousand obstacles separated us&mdash;that it would always be impossible
  for me to go to you, and that it would be useless for me to expect a
  friendship strong enough to draw you away from your country, your old
  friends, your Strawberry Hill in order to see&mdash;what?an old Sibyl
  withdrawn in the recesses of a convent. Ah, in the bottom of my soul, I have
  always known what I am worth. Your letter from Chantilly gave me some hope
  but it was followed by others that destroyed hope so effectively that your
  last, which is charming, cannot revive it. No&mdash;I shall not see you
  again&mdash;you say that you will come in April, but there will be a thousand
  thousand difficulties on your part&mdash;and perhaps a large one on mine; Ah,
  my tutor, I have so much hoped that before I make my long journey you will
  make a short one to France. You see to what a pitch my sadness
  grows&mdash;don't take it in ill part and allow me the liberty of showing
  myself as I am&mdash;Is there any happiness, any pleasure, equal to that of
  opening one's heart to a friend on whom one can entirely rely? Farewell, my
  tutor, I have no more paper.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IV [28]</p>

  <p>PARIS, Saturday, May 23, 1767.</p>

  <p>You hope that I may live to be eighty! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! What a cursed
  wish! Don't you know that I detest life, that I am wretched at having lived
  so long, that I wish that I had never been born? I was not made for this
  world, I don't know if there is another, but if there is, I dread it,
  whatever it may be. One can never be at peace, either with other people or
  with oneself&mdash;one displeases everyone, some because they believe that
  one does not sufficiently esteem or like them, others for the opposite
  reasons. To get along at all one must feign different sentiments for
  different people, and I am not capable of this. Naturalness and simplicity
  are praised and those who practise these virtues are hated. One knows all
  this and yet one fears death and why? Not only because of the uncertainty of
  the future, but because of the great repugnance one feels towards the
  prospect of the destruction of the mind. Ah, the mind! the mind! What is it?
  What power has reason over our speech, our actions, what triumph over our
  passions? What benefit does it procure us? If it checks the movements of our
  soul, is it not more hurtful to our happiness&mdash;a hundred
  times&mdash;than these passions can be? To live by reason is to live in a
  state of negation&mdash;and negation is good only because it
  is&mdash;negation. Here is three farthings' worth of metaphysics and I very
  humbly beg your pardon, you would be right to tell me&mdash;content yourself
  with loving yourself, abstain from boring others...</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER V [34]</p>

  <p>PARIS, Friday, 9th Oct., 1767. Ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

  <p>How much that was lazy, feeble and ridiculous did I allow you to see in
  me! And I promised myself so much the contrary...but, but, my tutor, forget
  all that, pardon me, and only think of your little old woman when you can
  tell yourself that she is reasonable and be certain that she is obedient and,
  above all, grateful, that her respect for you, yes, I say respect, her tender
  but serious attachment, will be, until her last moment, the happiness of her
  life. What does it matter if one is old, if one is blind? What does it matter
  where one lives? What does it matter if those who surround one are stupid or
  extravagant? When the soul is profoundly moved it requires nothing but the
  object that moves it&mdash;and when this object responds to what one feels
  for him&mdash;there is nothing left to be desired...</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VI [59]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 14 January, 1769.</p>

  <p>May I die if it has ever been my intention to complain of you or to vex
  you; my esteem for you reaches respect and even fear; but I have often an
  excess of hatred for myself&mdash;fits of sadness, penitence, remorse; I
  believe that everyone finds me insupportable and discovers me to be as
  detestable as I really am...Ah, why, you'll ask me, are you so fearful, why
  don't you avoid all quarrels, all annoyance? Alas, alas, when one is doing
  wrong one does not perceive one's fault, afterwards there comes repentance,
  remorse and one ages ten years in eight days&mdash;one advances with a
  giant's pace towards oblivion&mdash;one dies, no one regrets one, and so the
  story ends...do not grumble at me, my friend, I beg you, do not call me'
  Madame,' that is an odious punishment for me, as dreaded as the cane by
  children. You are too severe a tutor, you are intolerant. I don't know why I
  so obstinately continue to care for you. Adieu.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be&mdash;permit me to say&mdash;more extravagant than your

  style, but I certainly promise myself that it shall be the last, for I shall
  no longer write to you all that comes into my head and therefore you will not
  be able to complain of my indiscretion. Yes, yes, I am prudent enough, at
  least as prudent as you are, I am no more variable than you are, and worse
  for you, my head is as steady as yours that is upset, that turns, on the
  least excuse; I am stupid enough to confide in you, and no longer talking of
  yourself&mdash;for several reasons, the principal of which is that I had
  nothing to complain of there&mdash;I made some complaints of others, or more
  correctly, I told you quite frankly what I thought of everyone. You seem to
  think that my letters are public sheets and that the mob reads them as easily
  as you do. But to my justification...is it my fault if M. Hervey makes a bad
  joke,* and says what he thinks I think of you and what he thinks he feels for
  me? Your niece told me a hundred times that he was enamoured of me, and
  before everyone&mdash;if I or anyone else had been scandalised at this it
  would have been very ridiculous or very stupid&mdash;but you have not a
  talent for pleasantry and seem besides to think that my esteem and friendship
  dishonour you.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Felton Hervey had said that he was in love with Madame
  du Deffand, but that she was in love with Walpole.]</p>

  <p>I must then try to do the impossible and endeavour to prevent your name
  from being mentioned in front of me&mdash;then we shall see what fresh
  quarrels you will try to force on me...I don't know if you have received my
  last letter of twelve pages&mdash;but I indeed think not, and I await a
  terrible reply; I try to arm myself with courage that I may read it without
  chagrin or anger; I certainly promise that I shall not again expose myself to
  such a trial. However, despite all this, I am very satisfied with you, my
  friend, because you are willing to accept my friendship despite the bad
  opinion that you have of my character&mdash;as this doesn't seem to stand
  between us, it doesn't afflict me very much&mdash;I should be pleased,
  though, if you did not think me&mdash;"so vain, so tyrannical, so
  imprudent"&mdash;I have faults a little in the way of an intimate connexion.
  What can I do to make you change your opinion? Shall I never speak again to
  you of myself, ask nothing more of you, tell you nothing more of anyone? Thus
  you will be relieved of letters of a dozen pages and no longer able to tell
  me that I shut the gates of Paris for you. Ah, my friend, what am I to
  conclude from all this?&mdash;is it that I am not worthy of a friend like
  yourself&mdash;that you believe that you owe me a certain interest and that,
  not being able to find it in sentiment, take it in my faults. It might easily
  be that you were wearied of an intercourse that causes you little pleasure,
  but much fatigue, tedium and disgust. I do not think that I am either vain or
  tyrannical&mdash;I admit that I have often been imprudent&mdash;but I have
  done my best to correct myself. I am very far from thinking myself without
  faults, I am full of them, and, to my great misfortune, know it; I am more
  disgusted with myself than you or anyone else can be, and I only endure my
  life because I know that it can't last long now.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Soon afterwards, however, Madame du Deffand committed
  another of her 'imprudences' and suggested that during his next visit to
  Paris Walpole should occupy the suite of apartments next to hers in the
  Convent Saint-Joseph; this brought bitter reproaches from the self-conscious
  Englishman, who lived in terror lest this&mdash;to him&mdash;dangerous
  correspondence should be tampered with.]</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IX [83]</p>

  <p>PARIS, April 4th, 1770.</p>

  <p>My friend, my only friend, in the name of God let us make peace. I would
  rather think you crazy than unjust, but pray don't be one or the
  other&mdash;give me again all your friendship. If I have done wrong I will
  admit it and you shall pardon me, but in truth I am not guilty. I have never
  spoken of you&mdash;your English people thought that they were doing you a
  pleasure by speaking of my esteem for you&mdash;those who like, admire you,
  don't try to vex you&mdash;the good Hervey thought that he was performing
  wonders of good will&mdash;I forgive him freely the harm he has done to me.
  As regards my indiscreet question&mdash;it could not be understood by anyone,
  besides it was not in one of the letters sent through the post, but in one of
  those of twelve pages that you received by a safe hand. Have a better opinion
  of me, my friend, you have corrected so many of my faults and I have only one
  thought, one wish, one desire, to be until my last sigh your best friend. Do
  not fear that I shall ever abuse your friendship or your kindness. Never
  shall I press you to come to see me&mdash;ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>, I know only
  too well how difficult these journeys are for you, how many inconveniences
  they involve you in. I thought only to ease one of the most insupportable,
  the noises of the inns. Here nothing would appear more simple and more
  reasonable than the arrangement that I proposed.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* That Walpole should stay in the Convent
  Saint-Joseph.]</p>

  <p>I did not even intend to allow you to perceive that we were under the same
  roof&mdash;well! we will think no more of P...I hope, my friend, that after
  this explanation everything will be as it used to be between us and that no
  disputes will again vex our poor heads, let us make one another happy, to
  this end I will redouble my prudence and do you be a little more indulgent
  and never tell me that we do not suit each other. Remember the distance that
  separates us, and that when I receive a severe letter, full of reproaches, of
  suspicions, of coldness, I am unhappy for eight days and when at the end of
  that time I receive an even more vexing letter, I lose my head altogether. I
  do not like the sentiment of compassion&mdash;but do sometimes remember my
  age and my misfortunes and that it lies in your power to render
  me&mdash;despite them, very happy.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Horace Walpole, however, found it impossible to make
  Madame du Deffand 'very happy'; he found her, or pretended to find her, still
  vain, tyrannical and maddeningly exacting, and though now and then he sent
  her kind letters which filled her with joy, she more often received letters
  on her faults and rebukes as to her failings. 'Yawning in her hooded chair'
  or shuddering at the desolate thoughts roused in her by the melancholy
  rattling of her windows in the gales that swept Paris, the blind old woman
  clung to this strange, last love which bound her to a life of which she was
  totally weary. In February 1771, she wrote:]</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER X [102]</p>

  <p>A...our characters are not in the least alike&mdash;you have control over
  yourself&mdash;you were born under a happy star, you are gay, you have many
  talents, you are at ease, everywhere you are completely self-sufficient while
  I am exactly the contrary to all this, and if I were to make a frank
  confession which would probably surprise you, it would be that I know I have
  all the faults of which you accuse me, and that I endure myself with even
  more difficulty than others do. I often ask myself how it is possible that
  you have given me your friendship, even your affection, a fact that gives me
  a little merit even when I have most displeased you. <i>O Altitudo</i>! I do
  not understand it at all. But it is not necessary that I should understand
  it&mdash;it is enough for me that it is so...(February 1771).</p>

  <p>Saturday, 16th, at eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

  <p>...there is only one word left to say, that I will never speak of myself
  again. I passionately desire to see you, I dread with almost equal passion
  the tedium and fatigue that a journey would mean to you.</p>

  <p>Sunday, 17th.</p>

  <p>...before concluding I want to tell you that I am very pleased with you. I
  see that you wish to love me, that you know yourself well enough, and know me
  well enough also, you tell me frankly all that could disgust you, and all
  that could increase your affection&mdash;I like this, and am much obliged to
  you for taking this tone towards me. I much prefer it to those protestations
  that deceive those who make them as much as they deceive the recipient.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XI [110]</p>

  <p>PARIS, Wednesday, 1st May, 1771.</p>

  <p>...Be assured that if you come here, as you give me some hopes that you
  may, you will be satisfied on all the points that depend on me&mdash;no
  stupidities, no importunities of any sort&mdash;nothing shall disturb your
  tranquillity or impinge on your liberty...you paint a pathetic picture in
  your description of the delights of old age&mdash;when you give the
  occupations and possessions proper to that age&mdash;a dog, a cat, an
  apothecary, a priest, gossiping neighbours&mdash;I have none of these save
  the last; I shall soon have a cat, I should like a dog, but I don't wish for
  the two others. I congratulate you and applaud the happy situation of your
  soul&mdash;you are truly a philosopher. I don't know if you ought to be more
  grateful to nature or to experience. For myself, I owe nothing to either one
  or the other; I am empty-headed and cannot praise myself for anything; I pass
  my life in making mistakes, trying to repair them and then making them all
  over again. I have lost all hope, all idea of happiness&mdash;the only thing
  that consoles me is that I don't see that anyone is more fortunate than
  myself. Except yourself, everyone is bored, no one is self-sufficient, and it
  is this detestable boredom that pursues everyone and that everyone is trying
  to escape from that makes the perpetual movement...Ah, I understand your
  repugnance to write. I often feel it; for the last twelve or fifteen days I
  have not been able to put together one page to my liking. It is a misfortune
  reserved entirely for you that you are the only person to whom I can express
  myself with the facility that gives me the strength, when I write to you, to
  fill four pages&mdash;though to-day there are only three, for I don't wish to
  tax your patience or mine by relating all that I have done, all that I have
  heard, all that I have said. All that is deadly wearisome. Adieu.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XII [117]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 23 September, 1771.</p>

  <p>Yes, I want to be reasonable, but what must I do to appear so? I believed
  that you were charmed with my conduct, that you found a change in it, and
  that you even praised me a little in a way that I didn't deserve, in order to
  soften your censures which, perhaps, I didn't deserve, either. You tell me,
  that I can't endure contradiction. I am always ready to submit when I find it
  reasonable to do so; but I cannot support injustice, obstinacy and harshness.
  I like a gentle, more polished tone, I must admit, but I am not exacting and
  I am quite ready to submit to the advice of others when that seems to me
  reasonable. Do you want me never to argue again? Do you wish me to change my
  character? No, you don't wish it. It is better to be a bad original than a
  good copy&mdash;one must train one's natural disposition, regulate and
  control it, but one must never lose it; I was born imprudent, I must correct
  that into frankness, but never pretend to be a reserved, mysterious creature.
  Recollect, my friend, all those persons who are perfect, who are so on their
  guard that they pass twenty-four hours without committing a fault, and put me
  beside them&mdash;me who commit more faults than God pardons the
  righteous&mdash;and see which of us pleases you better. Be reasonable in your
  turn, my friend, be content with the progress that you found in me during
  your last visit, and hope to find further improvement when you come again.
  Always tell me the truth, but no longer affect a severity for which there is
  no longer any need. Don't think of me in the terms of the rebuke we give to
  children&mdash;<i>when one gives you an inch you take an ell</i>. Oh, no, no,
  you have nothing more to fear&mdash;alas, entirely the contrary&mdash;I am
  very far from abusing myself with flattery, but I am always ready to fall
  into excessive lack of self-confidence. But is it not here that you begin to
  yawn? Let us come to news, to proper names, etc.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIII [135]</p>

  <p>PARIS, Wednesday, 22 April, 1772.</p>

  <p>I am a monster, a mad woman, frantic&mdash;if you send me to the
  right-about, if you refuse ever to hear of me again you will be justified, I
  shall not have the right to complain, but I shall be in the last despair.
  Yes, I am convinced that my letter of Tuesday 15* is the height of folly and
  impertinence and do not pretend to excuse it. However, if anything could do
  so, it would be the state of my health. I was overcome with the vapours, and
  your letter of the loth that I received on that day appeared to me harsh, of
  a great severity. You wrote that you attributed my boredoms to my character,
  that you were fatigued with my complaints, that you trembled when you saw my
  letters&mdash;all was dryness and disgust: temper misled me and I wrote you a
  mass of impertinences. Every sin can be pardoned, though, my friend, follow
  the example of our Lord with the Magdalene, say with Him&mdash;<i>Her sins
  are pardoned, because she has l</i>...Ah, I won't finish that
  sentence&mdash;I shall further spoil my affairs instead of mending them. In
  the name of God, don't grumble at me, or, at least, what would be far worse,
  don't cast me off. We got on so well together! I did very wrong. I admit
  it&mdash;but you must pardon me, you must acknowledge that I am not
  incorrigible.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This letter has been lost.]</p>

  <p>Yesterday&mdash;Holy Thursday,&mdash;I received your two little boxes...I
  opened them with great excitement. The spirit kettle was found charming.
  Immediately I placed it in the middle of the table, the cups were arranged
  round it&mdash;only a jug was needed to make the set complete; at once,
  quickly, I sent out to Madame Poisier's to get one. Madame de Mirepoix, who
  had been told of the arrival of the kettle, called at six o'clock and asked
  for tea&mdash;from then on I held a public tea party and everyone admired the
  kettle&mdash;Oh if you had been in your place. I should have had nothing more
  to desire; my joy, however, was troubled by my remorse, I wrote a long letter
  full of regret, of gratitude. I satisfied myself by writing this letter, but
  as it could not go until Monday's post, I had too much time for reflection. I
  began to fear that this letter would displease you more than the one that
  caused me so much remorse. I threw it into the fire and resolved to wait
  until to-day to write...Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>, I have many faults and it is
  late in the day for me to... you know that I intend the very beautiful fan
  that you sent me as a present for the <i>fête</i> of Madame de Luxembourg,
  which will be held on July 22nd&mdash;in my wakeful nights, I imagined myself
  fastening a bouquet of lily-of-the-valley and marjoram to this gift, and her
  ill-humour inspired some verses that I have not however yet sent
  her&mdash;they are to the tune of&mdash;<i>Long live wine&mdash;Long live
  love</i>&mdash;the same air to which I have already made those verses that
  you know and that begin:</p>

  <p class="poem">Despite the flight of love&mdash;</p>

  <p>Do you not find this pleasant?...but they are indeed trifles that I
  recount to you and already you are weary of them...</p>

  <p class="footnote">[In the Spring of 1772 Madame du Deffand decided on what
  was, to her, a great adventure, a journey to Chanteloup, the sumptuous estate
  of M. de Choiseul; several long letters to Walpole relate the details of her
  travel from Paris to Tours, in a <i>berline</i>, by way of Etampes and
  Orleans; even amid the caresses and attentions of her princely relations,
  Madame du Deffand did not for a second forget her overmastering passion for
  Horace Walpole. On Thursday, June i i, 1772, she wrote from Chanteloup:]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIV [139]</p>

  <p>Indeed I don't know what line to take. Nothing could equal your
  severity&mdash;your punishments surpass the crimes by much. I'll not repeat
  what I wrote you in the other letters that I sent you while I've been
  here&mdash;what is the use? It would only fatigue you and bring new rebukes
  on me. If I were not convinced of your sincerity, of your honesty&mdash;dare
  I add&mdash;of your friendship&mdash;I should believe that your
  anger&mdash;your silences&mdash;that I now endure meant that you wished to
  break with me. Is it that you did not wish me to come here?&mdash;dreading
  apparently inconveniences that could not have occurred...my stay has passed
  off very well&mdash;all has turned out as pleasantly as I could have
  wished&mdash;but one can't detail one's affairs unless one is persuaded that
  one has an interested listener&mdash;your conduct shows the most perfect
  indifference to mine&mdash;however, you found time to write a billet to
  Mademoiselle Sanadon. That gave me a little inkling of how matters were; she
  told me that she would let me know what you had written, but never sent the
  letter; I asked her if you had forbidden her to do so, or if she thought that
  the contents of your note would cause me too much chagrin.&mdash;She replied,
  I was not forbidden, but your second guess was right.</p>

  <p>I don't know what all this means&mdash;if I am not altogether effaced from
  your memory, you can judge of my situation. You have sometimes heard me say
  that, if I were to love truly, I should have to fear also the person that I
  loved&mdash;to-day I find the dose a little too strong, I dare neither speak
  nor keep silence; it seems to me that whatever I do I do wrong. If I receive
  one of your letters I tremble as I open it&mdash;I know that in it I shall
  find a full exercise of your severity and that you will give me a great deal
  of pain. When I return to Paris, it will be a desert to me&mdash;I can hope
  for nothing agreeable save the re-establishment of our correspondence. This
  is the sole hope that determines me to leave this place where I am
  overwhelmed by cares, by attentions, and where they want to keep me
  permanently&mdash;or at least until October...I hope to endure the fatigues
  of the return journey better than I supported those of coming here, but what
  I can't endure, is your anger, or worse, your indifference. This letter shall
  not share the same fate as so many others, no, it shall not be torn up, it
  shall be sent&mdash;I pray God that His grace may go with it&mdash;and that
  it may receive yours when it arrives.</p>

  <p>Adieu, my friend, I beg you not to let me give you this name in vain. How
  can one hesitate to make a decision on which depends another's happiness or
  grief?</p>

  <p>Your pen is iron tempered with steel. Good God! What a letter!&mdash;there
  can never have been one more wounding, drier or ruder&mdash;I have indeed
  paid for the impatience with which I wished to receive it. I arrived home
  yesterday at five o'clock in the evening, feeling marvellously well and not
  in the least fatigued from the journey, with much pleasure at finding myself
  at home again, with much happiness in recalling my stay at Chante-loup, with
  great hopes of finding a letter from you&mdash;and there it was, to complete
  my satisfaction. Ah, my God, there was a surprise for me! The letter had a
  contrary effect to what I had expected! All my happiness was
  destroyed&mdash;one instant did me more harm than five weeks of enjoyment had
  done me good.</p>

  <p>Wednesday, 24th.</p>

  <p>...I am closing this letter, but I cannot do so without once more speaking
  frankly. You make me much too unhappy. Is it your intention to do so? You
  tell me that you feel many obligations towards me&mdash;what are
  these?&mdash;is there any save my friendship? And your return?&mdash;it is
  your refusal to send me your news? If you have ever experienced any such
  uneasiness as that of suspense&mdash;you'll understand my unsupportable
  suffering&mdash;I ask your pity not to condemn me to this anguish. I don't
  know what reason of complaint I have given you, unless it is my journey. I
  have a head more easily disturbed even than yours&mdash;don't, pray, expose
  me to the risk of doing something that may displease you.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XVI [143]</p>

  <p>PARIS, July 8th, 1772.</p>

  <p>My last letter, Monsieur, might have assured you that there was no need to
  write what I have now received&mdash;it ought to have freed you for ever from
  the fear that I should ever make you ridiculous. As you have no doubt that
  what we write to each other forms the amusement of the post-office, and then
  is smiled over at Court, I will explain myself as clearly as you have done
  and not leave to our audience the impression that you have given them of me.
  Here then, Monsieur, is my declaration. I have sincerely loved you. I
  believed that I was loved by you&mdash;never have my sentiments gone beyond
  friendship, and if you compare my letters to those of Madame de Sévigné or
  read those I have written to Madame la duchesse de Choiseul, you will find
  that in my letters to you are no expressions warmer than those a mother uses
  to a daughter, or a woman to another woman. Besides, my age puts me
  beyond&mdash;far beyond any suspicion and frees me from the risk of any
  ridiculous interpretations. But now, all is over, I have known for some time
  that you wished to end our connexion. Everything indicated the change in you.
  I do not complain of that, Monsieur, you are perfectly free, but what I do
  complain of, and what offends me extremely, is your manner of making this
  rupture; one does not treat a woman of my age, and one who holds a certain
  place in society, in a manner so contemptuous. Many of your letters have been
  very disobliging as was the last&mdash;but that* sent before the last wounded
  me mortally, I return it to you in order that you may see for yourself so
  that you may judge for yourself if I could have replied other than I have
  done. This that I have received to-day has not changed my disposition in the
  least. Your grievances are so puerile that one can hardly reply to them.
  "<i>These uneasinesses about my health&mdash;you have asked three times
  running if I have read a certain portion of your letter</i> (I don't remember
  this at all) <i>this is, you say, the manner of a coquette</i>. This
  ennumeration of my crimes will doubtless make the officials of the
  post-office laugh. Again, you say&mdash;'You love only yourself, you only
  want to make slaves, and as I won't be a slave and only love myself we shall
  never come to an agreement.'</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This letter has been lost.]</p>

  <p>Very well, Monsieur, let us disagree and end a correspondence that for you
  has for a long time only been a persecution.</p>

  <p>Your reproach that I am romantic would make those who know me
  smile&mdash;never has there been anyone who has been less suspected of this,
  I am indeed surprised that you know me so little&mdash;I should never have
  guessed that you were the person, of all others, who understood me so little
  and esteemed me even less&mdash;a great coquette as I am, Monsieur, I often
  remember my age&mdash;this reflection consoles me for the chagrins and
  disgusts of life&mdash;I shall not have to support them much longer.</p>

  <p>I end by assuring you that you need not fear to receive often letters from
  me; you will only have replies to yours.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XVIII [145]</p>

  <p>I was doubtful&mdash;I believe I should under other circumstances have
  been sure&mdash;but I took your long silence merely as a penance imposed on
  me for my faults. Thus I explained this silence, and in the very moment that
  I awaited a hoped-for letter, I was composing a reply and preparing to tell
  you, in case you continued to mock me and treat me as the Turks treat the
  Moors, that as the people among whom I live are not so enlightened as you, I
  hoped you would not point out to them the faults in me that had escaped
  them&mdash;the romantic strain, for instance&mdash;for everyone who knows me
  believes that the little wit I have is simple, sincere and far indeed removed
  from all eccentricity and affectation. I should add that your silence does
  not give me any pain, because I don't wish for any complaisance from
  you&mdash;and for me to have any wish to write to you or to receive your
  letters, you would have to desire this very much yourself.</p>

  <p>One thing more&mdash;I should again wish to say that I have one favour to
  ask of you, that is that you give me your word of honour that if you were
  ever ill, or even in some inconvenience, you would let me know it, so that,
  during this time that I never even hear you spoken of, I can feel sure that
  you are well, so that I shall not have two anxieties at the same
  time&mdash;one as to your health, one as to&mdash;that execrable word&mdash;I
  wish that I could emulate you and have as happy a character as you have; but,
  unfortunately one has to be content with that given one by nature that does
  not consult one when one is born&mdash;I should never have rejected her gifts
  had I been able to accept them...The duchesse de Sully, daughter of M.
  Poyanne, died last night, aged twenty years; she had been ill fifteen days
  following her accouchement. Madame de Poix passed these fifteen days by her
  bedside, only sleeping for an hour or two during the twenty-four&mdash;when
  her friend appeared more at ease. M. and Madame Beauveau were to have dined
  with me this evening, but they will not come now. They cannot leave her
  (Madame de Poix), she is in an affliction that amounts to despair. Where do
  you place this sentiment? It will not appear credible to you&mdash;do you
  dare to call it romantic? It will not appear so to anyone and least of all, I
  vow, to me...</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Soon after this date Walpole deigned to renew the
  correspondence while he remained in retreat in Strawberry Hill, a prisoner to
  the gout; Madame du Deffand was careful to adopt a sober tone in her letters,
  but she still received reproofs from Walpole about the warmth of her
  feelings, and drew from him the testy declaration that he preferred "an
  acquaintance to a friend." No signs of age appear in Madame du Deffand's
  letters, and it is notable that she makes no reflections&mdash;save
  occasionally and indirectly&mdash;on her blindness and, despite her keen and
  melancholy sense of her advancing years, she continues to dwell on the future
  and the one hope that it held for her&mdash;another visit from Horace

  displeased you, but there must have been a thousand that you found
  agreeable&mdash;but I have long since remarked that it is never those to
  which you reply. Eh, well, I promise you that when I am at the point of death
  with the vapours, I shall die without telling you anything about it. Ha! Ha!
  I trouble your gaiety, and you dread my letters like poison! Permit me to
  believe nothing of this, and don't take from me the little pleasure that
  remains to me&mdash;that of our correspondence...In the name of God, don't
  grumble any more. As you are naturally gay, do not change your character in
  writing to one who was born melancholy, and tolerate, pray, the sad things
  that you find in my letters&mdash;and I will try to keep them out as much as
  possible. Your severity makes me tremble. Reassure yourself as to my
  indiscretions and be sure that my actions will always conform.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXI [206]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 4 December, 1774.</p>

  <p>Ah, <i>mon Dieu, mon Dieu</i>! I consent I will never talk to you of
  yourself, still less of myself&mdash;this will be a droll correspondence. You
  will not come next year, of that I feel sure&mdash;you will find a misplaced
  stop or comma in my letters, that will cause some equivocation
  and&mdash;good-bye to your journey...I have re-read your letter, it is
  decidedly energetic; it is rare to find anyone expressing himself with such
  clarity, and even, one might say, in such an ingenious fashion, in a foreign
  language. You only say precisely what you want to&mdash;neither more nor
  less&mdash;I know only one other, Voltaire, that renders his thoughts as well
  as you do; it is difficult to imagine a character like yours&mdash;it is
  unique in the world, I am sure.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXII [207]</p>

  <p>18 December, 1774.</p>

  <p>I flattered myself that I should have a letter and I didn't deceive
  myself&mdash;here is one with which I am entirely pleased&mdash;if it cost
  you nothing to write it. My friend, to write at such length when one is
  suffering is an excess of goodness that I don't wish from you. I can clearly
  see that you wish to reassure me, and I will show my gratitude for your
  attention by not dwelling on my anxiety. If you wish to oblige me, send me
  your news twice a week, once to me, once to your cousin. I thought all last
  night (for I did not close an eye) that though it was wretched to be
  sleepless, you had much more than that to complain of&mdash;I can't
  understand how one supports both vexation and pain, I am so feeble in mind
  and body, that I could not resist either one or the other...</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXIII [216]</p>

  <p>Friday, March 10th, 1775.</p>

  <p>Your last letter was full of common sense. I am sure that you take an
  interest in my happiness; you do yourself a violence to contribute to it, but
  you make me feel that a little too much&mdash;your letters cost you, and your
  journey here would cost you, too dear. I perceive with much chagrin, that you
  find but little amusement here, if I had a little more generosity I should
  beg you to dispense with this visit, but I admit that I desire to see* you
  once more. I want you to judge for yourself the change in me, in order that
  you may be spared the tedium of talking about it...</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Madame du Deffand always ignores her blindness and
  writes thus&mdash;<i>Je désire de vous voir</i>.</p>

  <p>You are right when you say that age and experience have had no effect on
  me&mdash;'tis true indeed, for age has but disfigured me, and experience has
  made me disgusted with the world without rendering society less necessary to
  me.&mdash;Company is indeed more than ever needful to me and you cannot
  prevent me from regretting my poor Pont-de-Veyle, he listened to me, he
  replied to me, he loved me better than everyone else, I was necessary to him,
  and if anyone had abandoned me, he would have remained faithful. Besides he
  had a certain knowledge of the world, that, without being profound, was,
  under the circumstances, quite sufficient. Too much penetration sometimes
  irritates&mdash;there is danger in going too deep, it is usually better to
  keep to the surface of others and only to show one's own. I don't know if I
  express my thought well&mdash;usually I don't when I try to repine but you
  know how not to take me literally...</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXIV 220]</p>

  <p>Wednesday, 1775.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more shocking than your eternal excuses for the
  insipidity of your letters&mdash;how can they, how can the letters of a
  friend, be insipid? It is constraint, awkwardness, complaisance that produces
  insipidity...I re-read the memories of Sully. I find them supportable. I also
  read <i>The Order of the Holy Ghost</i>. I think the anecdotes pleasant
  enough, but there are so many of them, that one makes one forget the
  other&mdash;it is difficult to pass the time, death and living are both
  insipid.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXV [225]</p>

  <p>I am not surprised at your irresolution&mdash;I shall feel like that
  myself if you decide to come here. Your years are not enough to age you but
  more than enough to efface the traces of a friendship that was never, on your
  part, profound, and that is already undermined by your singular
  interpretations of my behaviour. You say that I am the only person that never
  ages; you greatly deceive yourself in taking me out of the class of
  decrepitude&mdash;I have all the symptoms of that state, above all a distaste
  for all amusements and a deep boredom against which I cannot find any
  resource. No pleasure tempts me, I am not to be drawn from my hooded chair,
  but company is necessary to me above all in the evening; all reading wearies
  me, history, because I have no curiosity, moralities, because these ideas
  seem to me commonplace or unnatural, fictions, because all belonging to
  gallantry appears faded and tales of passion sadden me. In brief, I tell you
  the truth when I tell you that what enables me to endure my condition, is the
  certainty that it cannot last long. I try to sweeten my situation by
  meditations, but these don't help, as they always lead me to conclude that my
  vexations and the discontent that I feel in all about me are entirely my own
  fault. Here is a picture of my soul. It is interrupted by a visit.</p>

  <p>Sunday, 2nd.</p>

  <p>I'll not take back anything I wrote yesterday, I flatter myself that you
  won't be shocked; it is only fair that sometimes I should be allowed to speak
  of myself and of the truth; I shall not abuse this liberty, you can flatter
  yourself that you have succeeded in my education&mdash;it is tiresome that
  you did not undertake it sooner...</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Horace Walpole arrived in Paris August 19, 1775, and
  left it on the following October 12; the visit passed off well; they never

  been, these are my gains for which I can never be sufficiently grateful.</p>

  <p>At last you have returned to good health, you enjoy the pleasure of seeing
  your friends again, do not forget those whom you have left behind, or the
  hopes you gave them. My health improves every day and I live carefully by
  rule, every day I take a little broth in memory of you, I am not altogether
  free from my giddiness, or from certain black vapours&mdash;it seems to me
  that all that happened since the 19th August was an unforgettable

  <p>Thursday, March 21, 1776.</p>

  <p>...You give me praises of which I am quite unworthy&mdash;you
  misunderstand me on every point. I am not difficult, I should accommodate
  myself to everyone&mdash;if everyone was not ridiculous...Only affectation,
  absurdity and pretension shock me&mdash;and I find nothing else. I also
  perceive very clearly that I am losing all the faculties of my intelligence,
  little by little&mdash;memory, application, facility of expression&mdash;all
  gradually fail me. I no longer wish to be loved, I know that I am no longer
  loved, I no longer love myself. I do not exact from others the sentiments
  that I cannot give them&mdash;what destroys all hope of happiness for me, is
  the boredom that, like a worm, gnaws away all that might have made me happy.
  This simile should be explained, but I cannot clarify this thought...</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXIX [242]</p>

  <p>I sympathise with you&mdash;I have a wish to write to you. I have had your
  last letter re-read to me; if it is not a masterpiece of good French, it is
  one of excellent English. Apart from the praises that you give me, all that
  you say is very true, very profound and proceeds from a very clear
  intelligence&mdash;but what profit can I make of it? Have we any power over
  ourselves? If that were so, every intelligent person would be happy. I begin
  with you&mdash;I ask you if you are happy&mdash;I should have difficulty in
  believing that you were. However, one must not judge others by oneself. I,
  for example, when my soul is without sentiment, I am without ideas, without
  tastes, without thoughts and I fall into that emptiness which I term boredom.
  If one could make oneself happy by reason and reflection&mdash;one would see
  the contrary of what one does see, for every day, in looking out, I see that
  the fools are most content with themselves and with others, and that they
  know best how to be self-sufficient. You mock me very harshly as to the
  importance that I put on tender friendship, and in the end you persuade me
  that you are right, but in destroying my illusions I don't know what to put
  in their place&mdash;there is, I believe, happiness in mistaking dead leaves
  for gold. I laughed at your recapitulation of all my reasons for
  happiness&mdash;that of long life, for instance, some day you may know what
  that is worth. And in regard to the consideration that I enjoy the esteem
  that people have for me, the attentions that I receive...But in fact when it
  is a question of acquaintances, of connexions, of friends, it is not the
  number that satisfies. That is what I want to say to you to-day, and from the
  moment that you have read it, you will have done with me....</p>

  melancholia, of boredom, of affection, continued to be sent to Strawberry

  Walpole, on his side, continued to be tormented with the gout and did not

  <p>...I am vexed, my friend, that I have written several letters that have
  displeased you; I am no longer mistress of my moods, I can now neither
  conceal nor suppress them. My letters must be disagreeable to you, because
  you want them to resemble those of Madame de Sévigné. Apart from the fact
  that I have not her wit, I have not the passion that she put into everything,
  the interest that she took in everything that she saw. I feel an utter
  indifference towards everything that happens, a vast contempt for everything
  that I hear, no desire to repeat it, besides I am prevented from writing of
  this or that, because you infer something to my disadvantage from what I say.
  You are much inclined to believe me not only jealous, but envious&mdash;admit
  the truth, you thought better of me in the beginning of our acquaintance than
  you do to-day? The resolution that you have taken never to see me
  again&mdash;you do not wish to avow this, but you know quite well that I have
  divined it, clouds your entire disposition towards me and makes you interpret
  ill all that I tell you. Is this metaphysics? I fear so. Adieu till to-morrow

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXXII [348]</p>

  <p>22 August, 1780.</p>

  <p>I have received your letters of the 13th and 14th. I told you, in my last,
  that I did not feel well; to-day I am worse. I have no fever, at least, so
  they think, but I am very feeble and quite exhausted; my voice is faint, I
  can hardly hold myself upright, I can scarcely move, my heart feels stifled;
  it is difficult not to believe that this state announces my approaching end.
  I have not the strength to feel alarmed, and as there was no hope of my
  seeing you again, I have nothing to regret. My present circumstances are very
  lonely, all my acquaintances are dispersed...Assure yourself, my friend, as
  best you can, and do not afflict yourself about me. We are already nearly
  lost to each other, we should never have seen each other again; you will
  regret me, because it is very pleasant to know that one is beloved. Perhaps
  after this Wiart will send my news; dictation fatigues me.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Wiart did not wish such a sad letter to be sent, but could not
  gain his point. Without doubt Madame is very feeble, but not as ill as she
  believes; she is full of vapours and sees everything in black. M. Bouvard
  ordered her two ounces of cassia; she took half this evening, she will take
  the other half to-morrow morning. She continued to take a good plateful of
  potage and a little biscuit; she is now a little stronger; she was in a bad
  disposition when she wrote. Wiart will be sure to post a bulletin until
  Madame's health is restored to its ordinary condition.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XXXIII</p>

  <p>Paris, October 23, 1780.</p>

  <p>You have asked me, Monsieur, details of the illness and death of your
  worthy friend. If you still have the last letter that she wrote to you,
  re-read it, and you will see that she made an eternal farewell; this letter
  is, I believe, dated the 23rd August; she had then no fever, but one could
  see that she felt her end approaching, when she told you that you would have
  all future news from me. I cannot tell you the pain I felt in writing that
  letter from her dictation; I was not able to re-read it after having written
  it, for my words were choked by sobs. She said to me: You love me then? This
  scene was sadder for me than a tragedy, for when witnessing one, we know that
  it is a fiction, but here was the sad truth&mdash;a truth that pierced my
  soul. Her death followed the course of nature, she had no disease, or, at
  least, no sufferings; when I heard her complain I always asked her if she was
  in pain in some part of her body and she always replied&mdash;no. The last
  eight days of her life were passed in a total lethargy; she was quite
  unconscious. She had the gentlest of releases from a long disease&mdash;life.
  You must not think, Monsieur, that she desired any honours after her death;
  in her will she ordered the simplest funeral. Her orders have been obeyed; as
  she wished, she reposed in the Church of Saint-[?] that was that of her
  parish. The local clergy were not altogether willing that she should receive
  any mark of distinction after her death. However, her <i>curé</i> saw her
  every day, and had begun to confess her; he could not conclude this, as she
  soon lost consciousness, this also prevented her from receiving the
  sacraments; M. <i>le curé</i> behaved very well; he had not believed that the
  end was so near. I will look after Toutou [Madame du Deffand's dog] until the
  departure of M. Thomas Walpole; I am taking the greatest care of him. He is
  very gentle; he will bite no one, he was only fierce when near his mistress.
  I remember very well, Monsieur, that she begged you to take him when she was
  no more.</p>

  <p>This celebrated beauty was born Amy Lyon, daughter of a blacksmith on the
  Welsh border; she came to London as a servant-girl and after various
  adventures went to live at Up Park, under the protection of Sir Harry
  Featherstonehaugh. After a quarrel with him she returned, penniless and
  expecting a child, to her grandmother's cottage at Hawarden. During her stay
  at Up Park, she had met Charles Greville, second son of the Earl of Warwick;
  he gave her a franked letter addressed to himself and told her to write to
  him in case of need. This she did and after the birth and death of her
  infant, Amy Lyon, who then called herself Emma Hart, came to London and lived
  with Greville at Paddington. He also housed Emma's mother as housekeeper and
  put to school her little daughter, child of some unknown father. Emma was
  carefully educated and trained by Greville and finally sent to Naples with
  her mother to learn music under the care of Sir William Hamilton, Greville's
  uncle and British Ambassador at Naples. The gorgeous Emma, whose fame had
  been spread by the series of portraits George Romney had painted of her,
  became the mistress and then the wife (1791) of Sir William Hamilton. She
  first met Horatio Nelson in 1793, became intimate with him after the battle
  of the Nile, made a good deal of mischief and was responsible for much
  cruelty owing to her friendship with Queen Caroline; helped the royal family
  during the revolution of 1799 and the flight to Palermo, and when her
  husband, then in his dotage, was recalled to England, accompanied him and
  Nelson to England. Soon after, January 1800, she gave birth to Horatia, whom
  Nelson believed to be his child. The three, the Hamiltons and Nelson, lived
  together on the latter's money. After her husband's death, Emma and Nelson
  became definitely outcast from society, which took the part of the deserted
  Lady Nelson. After the death of Lord Nelson, Emma pressed her claims "for
  services rendered" on the British Government, but these though passionately
  endorsed by Nelson&mdash;he left her and Horatia as a legacy to the
  nation&mdash;were ignored by the Ministry. Emma had been left very well
  provided for, by both Hamilton and Nelson, but her boundless extravagance
  involved her in hopeless difficulties and she escaped from King's Bench
  jurisdiction to Calais, where she died in obscurity, though not in penury. If
  not the most beautiful woman of her age, her beauty was better advertised
  than that of any other woman, and her famous 'attitudes,' posings with a few
  properties, were admitted, even by those who disliked her, to be really
  extraordinary for grace and dramatic feeling.</p>

  already sent an appeal to Greville, now lost, and this was her second <i>aide

  <p class="footnote">[The following eight letters were written by Emma when
  she had been sent away by Greville to the sea in order that she might cure a
  disfiguring rash; she had with her her little daughter whom she afterwards
  utterly neglected; after her marriage, Sir William paid for "little Emma,"
  who fades out of history very soon. It is doubtful if her mother ever saw her
  again after this Welsh holiday. While Emma was sea-bathing, Greville and
  Hamilton, then in England, were arranging her future. Delicate negotiations
  were taking place between the two heartless men of the world; Greville's
  debts were to be paid by his uncle, and Emma was to be lured to Naples under
  a promise that Greville would soon join her there. Greville had polished a
  rough jewel into a priceless gem that he could no longer afford to keep, and
  thought that he was providing handsomely for Emma by putting her under the
  protection of his wealthy, well-placed uncle. He did not for a moment foresee
  that marriage would be the outcome of the association; indeed, one of his
  objects in putting Emma in Sir William's way was to prevent that withered old
  elegant from marrying again.]</p>

  <p>PARKGATE, June the 15, 1784.</p>

  <p>MY DEAREST GREVILLE,</p>

  <p>You see by the date where I am gott and likely to be; and yett it is not
  through any neglect of seeking after other places. As to Abbergely it is 4o
  miles, and so dear that I could not with my mother and me and the child have
  been there under 2 guines and a half a week. It is grown such a fashionable
  place. And High Lake as 3 houses in it, and not one of them as is fit for a
  Christian. The best is a publick-house for the sailers of such ships as is
  oblidged to put in there, so you see there is no possibility of going to
  either of those places. Has to where I am, I find it very comfortable,
  considering from you. I am in the house of a Laidy, whoes husband is at sea.
  She and her grammother live to-gether, and we board with her at present, till
  I hear from you. The price is high, but they don't lodge anybody without
  boarding; and as it is comfortable, decent and quiet, I thought it would not
  ruin us, tell I could have your oppionon, which I hope to have freely and
  without restraint, as, believe me, you will give it to one, who will allways
  be happy to follow it, lett it be what it will. As I am sure you would not
  lead me wrong, and though my little temper may have been sometimes high,
  believe me, I have allways thought you in the right in the end, when I have
  come to reason. I bathe, and find the water very soult. Here is a great many
  ladys bathing, but I have no society with them, as it is best not. So pray,
  my dearest Greville, write soon and tell me what to do, as I will do just
  what you think proper; and tell me what to do with the child. For she is a
  great romp, and I can hardly master her. I don't think she is ugly, but I
  think her greatly improved. She is tall [has] good eyes and brows, and as to
  lashes she will be passible; but she has over-grown all her cloaths. I am
  makeing and mending all as I can for her. Pray, my dear Greville, do lett me
  come home as soon as you can, for I am all most brokenhearted being from you.
  Indeed I have no plasure nor happiness. I wish I could not think on you, but,
  if I was the greatest laidy in the world, I should not be happy from you. So
  don't lett me stay long. Tell Sir William everything you can, and tell him I
  am sorry out sittuation prevented [me] from giving him a kiss, but my heart
  was ready to break. But I will give it him, and entreat if he will axcept it.
  Ask him how I looked, and lett him say something kind to me when you write.
  Indead, my dear Greville, you don't know how much I love you. And your
  behaviour to me, wen we parted, was so kind, Greville, I don't know what to
  do; but I will make you a mends by my kind behaviour to you. For I have
  grattude, and I will show it you all I can. So don't think of my faults,
  Greville. Think of all my good, and blot out all my bad: for it is all gone
  and berried, never to come again. So, good-by, dear Greville. Think of nobody

  you, for endead I am not happy from you, tho I will stay if you like till a
  week before you go home, but I must go first. I hay had no letter from you,

  Direct for me at Mrs. Darnwood's, Parkgate near Chester, and write

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IV</p>

  <p class="cpi">The Same</p>

  <p>PARKGATE, June the 22nd, 1784.</p>

  <p>MY EVER DEAR GREVILLE,</p>

  <p>How tedious does the time pass awhay tell I hear from you. I think it ages
  since I saw you&mdash;years since I heard from you. Endead I should be
  miserable, if I did not recollect in what happy terms we parted&mdash;parted
  but to meet again with tenfould happiness. Oh, Greville, when I think on your
  goodness, your tender kindness, my heart is so full of grattitude, that I
  want words to express it. But I have one happiness in vew, which I am
  determined to practice, and that is eveness of temper and steadiness of mind.
  For, endead, I have thought so much of your amiable goodness, when you have
  been tried to the utmost, that I will, endead I will, manage myself and try
  to be like Greville. Endead, I can never be like him. But I will do all I can
  towards it, and I am sure you will not desire more. I think, if the time
  would come over again, I would be different. But it does not matter. There is
  nothing like buying experience. I may be happier for it hereafter, and I will
  think of the time coming and not the time past, except to make comparrasone,
  to show you what alterations there is for the best. So, my dearest Greville,
  don't think on my past follies; think on my good&mdash;little as it has been.
  And I will make you amends by my kind behaviour; you shall never repent your
  partiality. If you had not behaved with such angel-like goodness to me at
  parting, it would not have had such effect on me. I have done nothing but
  think of you since. And, oh, Greville, did you but know, when I so think,
  what thoughts&mdash;what tender thoughts [I have], you would say "Good God!
  and can Emma have such feeling sensibility? No, I never could think it. But
  now I may hope to bring her to conviction, and she may prove a valluable and
  amiable whoman!" True, Greville! and you shall not be disapointed. I will be
  everything you can wish. But mind you, Greville, your own great goodness has
  brought this about. You don't know what I am. Would you think it,
  Greville?&mdash;Emma&mdash;the wild unthinking Emma is a grave thoughtful
  phylosopher. 'Tis true, Greville, and I will convince you I am, when I see
  you. But how I am runing on. I say nothing about this giddy wild girl of
  mine. What shall we do with her, Greville? She is as wild and as thoughtless
  as somebody, when she was a little girl; so you may gess how that is. Whether
  she will like it or no, there is no telling. But one comfort is [that she is]
  a little afraid on me. Would you believe, on Satturday whe had a little
  quarel. I mean Emma and me; and I did slap her on her hands, and when she
  came to kiss me and make it up, I took her on my lap and cried. Now do you
  blame me or not? Pray tell me. Oh, Greville, you don't know how I love her.
  Endead I do. When she comes and looks in my face and calls me "mother,"
  endead I then truly am a mother; for all the mother's feelings rise at once,
  and tells [me] I am and ought to be a mother. For she has a wright to my
  protection, and she shall have it as long as I can, and I will do all I can
  to prevent her falling into the error her poor once miserable mother fell
  into.</p>

  <p>But why do I say miserable? Am I not happy abbove any of my sex, at least
  in my situation? Does not Greville love me, or at least like me? Does not he
  protect me? Does not he provide for me? Is not he a father to my child? Why
  do I call myself miserable? No, it whas a mistake, and I will be happy,
  chearful and kind, and do all my poor abbility will lett me, to return the
  fatherly goodness and prottection he has shewn [me]. Again, my dear Greville,
  the recollection of past scenes brings tears in my eyes. But they are tears
  of happiness. To think of your goodness is too much. But, once for all,
  Greville, I will be good to you.</p>

  <p>It is near bathing time, and I must lay down my pen. I won't finish till I
  see when the post comes, whether there is a letter. He comes in abbout one a
  clock. I hope to have a letter so to-day.</p>

  <p>I must not forgett to tell you my knees is well, as I may say. There is
  hardly a mark, and my elbows is much better. I eat my vittuels very well, and
  I am quite strong and feel hearty, and I am in hopes I shall be very well.
  You can't think how souk the watter is. And there is a many laidys bathing
  here. But, Greville, I am obliged to give a shilling a day for the bathing
  horse and whoman, and twopence a day for the dress. It is a great expense,
  and it fretts me now I think of it. But when I think how well I am, and my
  elbows likely to gett well, it makes me quite happy. For at any rate it is
  better than paying the docter. But wright your oppinion truly and tell me
  what to do. Emma is crying because I won't come and bathe. So, Greville, adue
  tell after I have dipt. May God bless you, my dearest Greville, and believe
  me faithfully, affectionately and truly yours only,</p>

  <p>&mdash;EMMA H.</p>

  <p>Thursday Morning.</p>

  <p>And no letter from my dear Greville. Why, my dearest Greville, what is the
  reason you don't wright? If you knew my uneasyness, you would. You promised
  to write before I left Howeden, and I was much disapointed you did not, but
  thought you might have a opportunity being at Wandower [? Wendover] Hill. I
  have sent 2 letters to Haverford West, and has never had no answer to them,
  and it is now 3 weeks since I saw you. Pray, my dearest Greville, wright to
  me and make me happy; for I am not so att present, though my arm is quite
  well.</p>

  <p>I think if I could but hear from you, I should be happy. So make [me]
  happy do, pray. Give my dear kind love and compliments to Pliney, and tell
  him. I put you under his care, and he must be answerable for you to me, when
  I see him. I hope he has [not] fell in love with any rawboned Scotchwoman,
  whoes fortune would make up for the want of beauty, and then he may soon
  through her [die] in a decline&mdash;Mum! For he is fond of portraits in that
  whay, and then he must be fond of originals, and it will answer every
  purpose. But don't put him in mind of it, for fear&mdash;. But offer and say
  everything you can to him for me, and tell him I shall allways thinks on him
  with gratitude and remember him with pleasure, and allways regret laeving is
  [leaving his] good company. Tell him I wish him every happiness this world
  can afford him, that I will pray for him, and bless him as long as I live. I
  am wrighting, 'tis true, but I don't know when you will ever gett it. For I
  can't send itt, till I hear from you, and the Post won't be in tell to morro.
  Pray, my dear Greville, lett me go home soon. I have been 3 weeks and if I
  stay a fortnight longer, that will be 5 weeks, you know; and then the expense
  is above 2 guineas a week, with washing and bathing whoman and everything;
  and I think a fortnightt or three weeks longer I shall not have a spot.</p>

  remember how you promised? Don't you recollect what you said at

  <p>Sunday Morning (27th June).</p>

  <p>MY DEAR GREVILLE,</p>

  <p>I had a letter on Friday from my granmother, and she sent me one from you,
  that had been there a fortnight. I am much obliged to you for all the kind
  things you say to me, and tell Sir William I am much oblidged to him for
  saying I looked well. I hope he will allways think so; for I am proud of
  [his] good word, and I hope I shall never forfeit it. I will at least study
  to deserve it. I am in hopes [to] have a letter from you, for it is a great
  comfort to me to hear from you. My dear Greville, it is now going on for a
  month since I saw you. But I think how happy I shall be to see you again, to
  thank you for your kindness to my poor Emma and me. She shall thank you,
  Greville, she shall be gratefull, she shall be good, and make you amends for
  all the trouble her mother has caused you. But how am I to make you amends?
  God knows, I shall never have it in my power. But, Greville, you shall have
  no cause to complain. I will try, I will do my utmost;and I can only regrett
  that fortune will not put it in my power to make a return for all the
  kindness and goodness you have showed me. Good-by. My dearest Greville...Emma
  is much obliged to you for remembering her, and she hopes you will give her a
  oppertunity of thanking you personally for your goodness to her. I think you
  won't be disappointed in her; though mothers (Lord bless me, what a word for
  the gay wild Emma to say!) should not commend, but leave that for other
  people to do.</p>

  <p class="cpi">The Same</p>

  <p>PARK GATE, July 3rd, 1784.</p>

  <p>I was very happy, my dearest Greville, to hear from you, as your other
  letter vexed me; you scolded me so. But it is over, and I forgive you. I am
  much obliged to you for all the kind things you say to me, and I am very
  happy to think we shall meet soon again, happy, good-humerd and chearfull. I
  will be so, and I think there is no fear of you. You don't know, my dearest
  Greville, what a pleasure I have to think that my poor Emma will be
  comfortable and happy; and, Greville, and if she does but turn out well, what
  a happiness it will be! And I hope she will for your sake, and [I] will teach
  her to pray for you as long as she lives; and if she is not grateful and
  good, it won't be my fault. What you say is very true:&mdash;a bad
  disposition may be [made] good by good example, and Greville would not put
  her any wheer to have a bad one. I come into your way a-thinking [that]
  hollodays spoils children. It takes there attention of from scoal. It gives
  them a bad habbit when they have been a month and goes back. This does not
  pleas them, and that is not wright, and they do nothing but think wen they
  shall go back again. Now Emma will never expect what she never had. So I hope
  she will be very good, mild and attentive, and we may have a deal of comfort.
  And, Greville, if her poor mother had ever had the luck and prospect mearly
  in having a good edducation that she has, what a whoman might she have been!
  But I won't think...My happiness now is Greville, and to think that he loves
  me makes me a recompense for all; for if he did not love me, would he be so
  kind and affectionate? No, 'tis impossible. Therefore I will have it so. I
  have said all my say about Emma, yet only she gives her duty. And I will now
  tell you a little about myself. I have not took but 2 of those things from
  Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, as the sea-water has done me so much good. I have drunk
  a tumbler glas every morning fastings, walked half an hour, and then bathed
  and breakfasted. I have the tang [?] appleyd to my knees and elbows every
  night going to bed, and every day [I have] washed them tweice a day in the
  sea-water, and they ar just well. Therefore as long as I stay, I had better
  go on in my old what, for I can take Mr. W's prescription at home, but not
  sea-water, tang, &amp;c. I am very wel, looks well, has a good appetite and
  is better than ever I was in my life. I have no society with anybody but the
  mistress of the house, and her mother and sister. The latter is a very
  genteel yong lady, good-natured, and does everything to pleas me. But still I
  would rather be at home, if you was there. I follow the old saying, home is
  home though 'tis ever so homely. I must go to diner. Therefore I will say no
  more, but that I long to see you and dear Sir W[illiam]. Give my kind love to
  him. Tell him [that] next to you I love him abbove anybody, and that I wish I
  was with him to give him a kiss. Don't be affronted, Greville. If I was with
  you I would give you a thousand, and you might take as many as you pleased,
  for I long&mdash;I mean I long to see you. My mother gives her compts to you
  and Sir W[illiam]. Say everything that is kind and well render me dear to
  him. To more than you can say my heart with gratitude assents, and I must
  ever remain</p>

  <p>Your ever affectionate and sincerely</p>

  <p>E. H.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Good-by, my dear Greville. I hope we shall meet soon, happy and
  well. Adue! I bathe Emma and she is very well and grows. Her hair will grow
  very well on her forehead, and I don't think her nose will be very snub. Her
  eye is blue and pretty. She don't speak through her nose, but she speaks
  countrified. We squable sometimes, still she is fond of me, and endead I love
  her, for she is sensible. So much for Beauty. I long to see you.</p>

  <p>EDGWARE Row, Tuesday, August 10th, 1784.</p>

  <p>I received you kind letter last night, and my dearest Greville I want
  words to express to you, how happy it made me. For I thought I was like a
  lost sheep and everybody had forsook me. I was eight days confined to my room
  very ill, but am, thank God! very well now and a deal better for your kind
  instructing letter, and I own the justness of your remarks. You shall have
  your appartment to yourself. You shall read wright or set still, just as you
  please; for I shall think myself happy to be under the same roof with
  Greville, and do all I can to make it agreable, without disturbing him in any
  pursuits that he can follow, to employ himself in at home or elsewhere. For
  your absence has taught me that I ought to think myself happy if I was within
  a mile of you. So as I could see the place as contained you, I should think
  myself happy abbove my...So, my dear G., come home, and you shall find your
  home comfortable to receave you. You shall find me good, kind, gentle and
  affectionate, and everything you wish me to do I will do. For I will give
  myself a fair trial, and follow your advice, for I allways think it wright.
  Therefore that shall ensure happiness for us boath. Don't think, Greville,
  this is the wild fancy of a moment's consideration, as it is not, I have
  thoroughly considered ever-thing in my confinement, and I say nothing now but
  what I shall practice.</p>

  <p>I must now inform you abbout my illness. My dear Greville, I had a rash
  out all over me and a fevour, and I should have been worse, if I had not had
  the rash out. But I think I am better for it now; for I look fair and seem
  better in health than I was before. I dare say I should have been very
  dangerously ill, if it had not come out. Pray, my dearest Greville, do come
  to see me, as soon as ever you come to town, for I do so long to see you. You
  don't know how it will make me to be happy,&mdash;I mean if you should come
  before diner. Do come [to dinner], because I know you will come at night. I
  have a deal to say to you when I see you. Oh, Greville, to think it is nine
  weeks since I saw you. I think I shall die with the pleasure of seeing you.
  Indeed, my dearest Greville, if you knew how much I think of you, you would
  love [me] for it, for I am allways thinking on you, of your goodness. In
  short, Greville, I truly love you, and the thought of your coming home so
  soon makes me so happy. I don't know what to do.</p>

  <p>Good-by, my ever dearest Greville. May God preserve you and bless you, for
  ever prays your ever affectionately and sincerely...</p>

  <p>My kind love to Sr. William; and tell him if he will come soon, I will
  give him a thousand kisses. For I do love him a little. Emma is very well and
  is allways wondering why you don't come home. She sends her duty to you.
  Good-by, my Dearest Greville. Pray, pray come as soon as you come to town.

  <p>NAPLES, April the 30th, 1786.</p>

  <p>MY DEAREST GREVILLE,</p>

  <p>I arrived at this place on the 26th, and I should have begun to write
  sooner, but the post does not go till tomorrow, and I dreaded setting down to
  write, for I try to apear as chearful before Sir William as I could, and I am
  sure to cry the moment I think of you. For I feel more and more unhappy at
  being separated from you, and, if my fatal ruin depends on seeing you, I will
  and must [see you] in the end of the summer. For to live without you is
  imposible. I love you to that degree, that at this time there is not a
  hardship upon hearth, either of poverty, hunger, cold death, or even to walk
  barefooted to Scotland, to see you, but what I would undergo. Therefore, my
  dear, dear Greville, if you do love me, for my sake try all you can to come
  hear as soon as possible. You have a true friend in Sir William, and he will
  be happy to see you, and do all he can to make you happy; and for me, I will
  be everything you can wish for. I find it is not either a fine horse, or a
  fine coach, or a pack of servants, or plays or operas can make happy. It is
  you that [h]as it in your power either to make me very happy or very
  miserable. I respect Sir William, I have a great regard for him, as the uncle
  and friend of you, and he loves me, Greville. But he can never be anything
  nearer to me than your uncle and my sincere friend. He never can be my
  lover.</p>

  <p>You do not know how good Sir William is to me. He is doing everything he
  can to make me happy. He [h]as never dined out since I came hear; and endead,
  to speake the truth, he is never out of my sight. He breakfasts, dines,
  supes, and is constantly by me, looking in my face. I can't stir a hand, leg
  or foot; but he is marking [it] as graceful and fine; and I am sorry to say
  it, he loves me now, as much as ever he could Lady Bolingbroke. Endead, I am
  sorry, for I cannot make him happy. I can be civil, oblidging, and I do to
  make myself as agreable as I can to him. But I belong to you, Greville, and
  to you only I will belong, and nobody shall be your heir-apearant. You do not
  know how glad I was to arrive hear the day I did. It was my birthday, and I
  was very low-spirited. Oh God! that day that you used to smile on me, and
  stay at home, and be kind to me&mdash;that [on] that day I should be at such
  a distance from you! But my comfort is, I rely upon your promise, and
  September or October I shall see you. But I am quite unhappy at not hearing
  from you;&mdash;no letter for me yet, Greville! But I must wait with
  patience. We have had company [al]most every day since I came:&mdash;some of
  Sir William's friends. The[y] are all very much pleased with me; and poor Sir
  William is never so happy as when he is pointing out my beauties to them. He
  thinks I am grown much more [h]ansome then I was. He does nothing all day but
  look at me and sigh. Yes, last night we had a little concert. But then I was
  so low, for I wanted you to partake of our amusement. Sir Thomas Rumbold is
  hear with [h]is son, who is dying of a decline. It is a son he had by his
  first wife; and, poor young man! he canot walk from the bed to the chair; and
  Lady Rum-bold, like a tender-hearted wretch, is gone to Rome, to pass her
  time there with the English, and [h]as took the coach, and all the English
  servants with her, and left poor Sir Thomas hear with [h]is heart broken,
  waiting on [h]is sick son. You can't think what a worthy man he is. He din'd
  with ous, and likes me very much, and every day [h]as brought [h]is carridge
  or phaeton, which he [h]as bought hear, and carries me and mother and Sir
  William out, and shows ous a deal of civilities; for you are to understand I
  have a carridge of Sir William's, a English one, painting, and new liverys,
  and new coachman and footman, &amp;c.&mdash;the same as Mrs. Damer had of her
  own, for she did not go with [h]is. For if I was going abbout in [h]is
  carridge, the[y] would say I was either his wife or mistress. Theirfore as I
  am not nor ever can be either, we have made a very good establishment. I have
  a very good apartment of 4 rooms, very pleasant-looking to the sea. Our boat
  comes out to-day for the first time, and we shall [be]gin to bathe in a day
  or two, and we are going for one day or two to Caserta. I was at Paysilipo
  yesterday. I think it a very pretty place.</p>

  <p>Sir William [h]as give me a camel-shawl like my old one, I know you will
  be pleased to hear that, and he [h]as given me a beautiful gown cost 25
  guineas (India painting on wite sattin), and several little things of Lady
  Hamilton's, and is going to by me some muslin dresses loose, to tye with a
  sash, for the hot weather&mdash;made like the turkey dresses, the sleeves
  tyed in fowlds with ribban and trimd with lace. In short, he is always
  contriving what he shall get for me. The people admire my English dresses.
  But the blue hat, Greville, pleases most. Sir William is quite inchanted with
  it. Oh, how he loves you! He told me he had made [h]is will, and left you
  everything belonging to him. That made me very happy for your sake. Pray, my
  dear Greville, do write me word, if you want any money. I am affraid I
  distressed you. But I am sure Sir William will send you some, and I told him
  he must help you a little now, and send you some for your journey hear, and
  he kissed me, and the tears came into [h]is eyes, and he told me I might
  command anything, for he loved ous boath dearly; and, oh! how [happy] shall I
  be, when I can once more see you, my dear, dear Greville. You are everything
  that is dear to me on hearth, and I hope happier times will soon restore you
  to me, for endead I would rather be with you starving then from you in the
  greatest splendour in the world.</p>

  <p>I have only to say I enclose this [which] I wrote yesterday, and I will
  not venture myself now to wright any more, for my mind and heart are torn by
  different passions, that I shall go mad. Only, Greville, remember your
  promise of October. Sir William says you never mentioned to him abbout coming
  to Naples at all. But you know the consequence of your not coming for me.
  Endead, my dear Greville, I live but in the hope of seeing you, and if you do
  not come hear, lett whatt will be the consequence, I will come to England. I
  have had a conversation this morning with Sir William, that has made me mad.
  He speaks&mdash;no, I do not know what to make of it. But, Greville, my dear
  Greville, wright some comfort to me. But onely remember, you will never be
  loved by anybody like</p>

  <p>Your affectionate and sincere,</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Pray for God's sake, wright to me and come to me, for Sir

  <p>NAPLES, July the 22nd, 1786.</p>

  <p>MY EVER DEAREST GREVILLE,</p>

  <p>I am now onely writing, to beg of you for God's sake to send me one
  letter, if it is onely a farewell. Sure I have deserved this, for the sake of
  the love you once had for me. Think Greville, of our former connexion, and
  don't despise me. I have not used you ill in any one thing. I have been from
  you going of six months, and you have wrote [only] one letter to
  me&mdash;enstead of which I have sent fourteen to you. So pray, let me beg of
  you, my much-loved Greville, only one line from your dear, dear hands. You
  don't know how thankful I shall be for it. For, if you knew the misery [I]
  feel, oh! your heart would not be intirely shut up against me; for I love you
  with the truest affection. Don't let anybody sett you against me. Some of
  your friends&mdash;your foes, perhaps; I don't know what to stile
  them&mdash;have long wisht me ill. But, Greville, you never will meet with
  anybody that has a truer affection for you than I have, and I onely wish it
  was in my power to shew you what I could do for you. As soon as I know your
  determination, I shall take my own measures. If I don't hear from you, and
  that you are coming according to promise, I shall be in England at Christmass
  at farthest. Don't be unhappy at that. I will see you once more, for the last
  time. I find life is unsuportable without you. Oh, my heart is intirely
  broke. Then, for God's sake, my ever dear Greville, do write to me some
  comfort. I don't know what to do. I am now in that state, I am incapable of
  anything. I have [a] language-master, a singing-master, musick, &amp;c. but
  what is it for? If it was to amuse you, I should be happy. But, Greville,
  what will it avail me? I am poor, helpeless and forlorn. I have lived with
  you for 5 years, and you have sent me to a strange place, and no one
  prospect, but thinking you was coming to me. Instead of which, I was told I
  was to live, you know how, with Sir William. No, I respect him, but no never
  shall he peraps live with me for a little wile like you, and send me to
  England. Then what am I to do? what is to become of me?&mdash;But excuse me,
  my heart is ful. I tell you&mdash;give me one guiney a week for everything,
  and live with me, and I will be contented. But no more, I will trust to
  providence; and whereve[r] you go, God bless you, and preserve you, and may
  you allways be happy! But write to Sir William. What as he done to affront
  you?</p>

  <p>If I have spirits, I will tell you something concerning how we go on, that
  will make my letter worth paying for. Sir William wants a picture of me, the
  size of the Bacante, for his new apartment, and he will take that picture of
  me in the black gown at Romney's, and I have made the bargain with him, that
  the picture shall be yours, if he will pay for it. And he will. And I have
  wrote to Romney, to send it.</p>

  <p>Their is two painters now in the house, painting me. One picture is
  finished. It is the size of the Bacante, setting in a turbin and Turkish
  dress. The other is in a black rubin hat with wite feathers, blue silk gown,
  &amp;c. But as soon as these is finished, ther is two more to paint
  me,&mdash;and Angelaca, if she comes. And Marchmont is to cut a head of me,
  for a ring. I wish Angelaca would come; for Prince Draydrixtou from Veina is
  here, and dines with us often, and he wants a picture of me. He is my
  cavaliereservente. He is much in love with me. I walk in the Villa Reale
  every night. I have generally two Princes, two or 3 nobles, the English
  minister, and the King with a crowd beyound us. The Q[ueen] likes me much,
  and desired Prince Draydrixtou to walk with me near her, that she might get a
  sight of me. For the Prince, when he is not with ous, is with the Queen and
  he does nothing but entertain her with my beauty, the accounts of it, &amp;c.
  But, Greville, the King [h]as eyes, he [h]as a heart, and I have made an
  impression on it. But he [is] told the Prince Hamilton is my friend, and she
  belongs to his nephew, for all our friends knows it, and the Prince desires
  his best compliments to you. I must tell you a piece of gallantry of the
  K...On Sunday he dines at Paysilipo, and he allways come every sunday before
  the casina in his boat to look at me. We had a small deplomatic party, and we
  was sailing in our boat, the K. directly came up, put his boat of musick next
  us, and made all the French horns and the wholl band play. He took of his
  hat, and sett with his hatt on his knees, all the wile, and when we was going
  to land he made his bow, and said it was a sin he could not speak English.
  But I have him in my train every night at the Villa or Oppera.</p>

  <p>I have been to Pompea, &amp;c. &amp;c., and we are going next week round
  the Island Carprea, Ischea, &amp;c. We shall be awhay a little wile. I should
  feil pleasure in all this, if you was heare. But that blessing I have not,
  and so I must make the best of my lot. God bless you! I would write a longer
  letter. But I am going to Paysylipo to diner, and I have a conversazzione
  to-night and a concert.</p>

  <p>I bathe ever day. I have not any irruptions, and&mdash;what will surprise
  you&mdash;I am so remarkably fair, that everybody says I put on red and
  white. We have no English hear but Lord Hervey, who is a lover of mine. I had
  a letter from Sir Thomas Rumbold last week, who is coming hear in October,
  and desired me to write him what I wanted from England, and he would bring it
  me. I am pleased with the fate of Fitzgerald. It shews the very little
  partiality the[y] have in England for the rich. In Naples he would not have
  suffered.</p>

  <p>We have had dreadful thunder and lightning. It fell at the Maltese
  minister[s] just by our house and burnt [h]is beds and wires [?], &amp;c. I
  have now persuaded Sir William to put up a conductor to his house. The lava
  runs a little, but the mountain is very full and we expect an irruption every
  day. I must stop, or else I should begin and tell you my ideas of the people
  of Naples. In my next I will. But, Greville, [of] fleas and lice their is
  millions. I shall write you an Italian letter soon. God bless you. Make my
  compliments to your brother and all your friends that's my friends. Pray,
  write to Yours Ever&mdash;With the truest and sincerest affection&mdash;God
  bless you&mdash;write my ever dear, dear Greville.&mdash;EMMA.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XII</p>

  <p class="cpi">The Same</p>

  <p>NAPLES, the 1st of August, 1786.</p>

  <p>I have received your letter, my dearest Greville, at last, and you don't
  know how happy I am at hearing from you, however I may [not] like some parts
  of your letter. But I won't complain. It is enough, I have [the] paper that
  Greville [h]as wrote on. He [h]as folded [it] up. He wet the wafer. How I
  envy thee to take the place of Emma's lips, that she would give worlds had
  she them, to kiss those lips! But if I go on this whay I shall be incapable
  of writing. I onely wish that a wafer was my onely rival. But I submit to
  what God and Greville pleases. I allways knew, I have ever had a forboding,
  since first I began to love you, that I was not destined to be happy; for
  their is not a King or Prince on hearth, that could make me happy without
  you. So only consider, when I offer to live with you on the hundred a year
  Sir William will give me, what you desire. And this from a girl that a King
  &amp;c. is sighing for! As to what you write to me, to oblidge Sir William, I
  will not answer you. For, oh! if you knew what pain I feel in reading those
  lines! where you advise me to W&mdash;&mdash; Nothing can express my rage! I
  am all madness! [You] Greville, to advise me!&mdash;you that used to envy my
  smiles! How, with cool indifference, to advise me to go to bed to him, Sir
  William! Oh, that [is the] worst of all! But I will not, no I will not rage.
  If I was with you, I would murder you and myself booth. I will leave of, and
  try to get more strength; for I am now very ill with a cold...I won't look
  back to what I wrote. I only say I have had 2 letters in 6 months, nor
  nothing shall ever do for me, but going home to you. If that is not to be, I
  will except [sic] nothing, I will go to London, their go into every excess of
  vice tell I dye. My fate is a warning to young whomen never to be two good.
  For now you have made me love you, [now] you [have] made me good, you have
  abandoned me; and some violent end shall finish our connexion if it is to
  finish. But, oh! Greville, you cannot, you must not give me up. You have not
  the heart to do it. You love me, I am sure; and I am willing to do everything
  in my power&mdash;and what will you have more? And I onely say this for the
  last time. I will [n]either beg [n]or pray, do as you like.</p>

  <p>I am very sorry Lord Brook is dead, and I am sincerely sorry for Sir James
  and Lady Peachy. But the W[arwic]k family won't mind it much. We have been 7
  weeks in doubt, whether he was dead or no. For Sir William had a letter from
  Lord Warwick, and he said Lord Brook was better. So I suppose he must have
  had a relapse. Poor little boy, how I envy him his happiness!</p>

  <p>We have a deal of rain hear and violent winds. The oldest people hear
  never remember such a summer. But it is lucky for us. The Queen is very
  poorly, with a cold caught in the Villa Reale, and mine is pretty much like
  it. We don't dine at Palsylipa [<i>sic</i>] to-day, on account of my cold. We
  are closely besieged by the K...in a roundabout manner. He comes every Sunday
  to P&mdash;pa, but we keep the good-will of the other party mentioned abbove,
  and never give him any encouragement. Prince Draydrixtous [is] our constant
  friend. He allways enquires after you. He speaks English; he says I am a
  dymond of the first watter, and the finest creature on the hearth; he attends
  me to the bath, to the walk, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I have such a head-ache to-day with my cold. I don't know what to do. I
  shall write next post by Sir William. Only I can't lett a week go without
  telling you how happy I am at hearing from you. Pray, write as often as you
  can, and come as soon as you can. If you come, we shall all go home together;
  for Sir William will go to England in 2 years, and go throug Spain, and you
  will like that. Pray, write to me and don't write in the stile of a friend,
  but a lover. For I won't hear a word of friend. It shall be all love and no
  frienship. Sir William is ever freind. But we are lovers. I am glad you have
  sent me a Blue Hat and gloves. My hat is universaly admired throug Naples.
  God bless you, my dear Greville, prays your ever truly and affectionate</p>

  <p>EMMA HART.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Pray write, for nothing will make me so angry (as your
  silence): and it is not to your interest to disoblige me for you don't know
  the power I have hear. Onely I never will be his mistress. If you affront me,
  I will make him marry me.&mdash;God bless you for ever.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This letter represents a climax in Emma's life; she
  had realised that Greville had abandoned her and that she was destined for
  Sir William Hamilton. There may be sincerity behind the melodramatic
  phrases&mdash;culled from trashy novels&mdash;in which Emma expresses
  herself, but her nature was very shallow and her experiences had not been
  such as to teach her delicacy or refinement of feeling. In a few months she
  had reconciled herself to a position sufficiently dazzling to turn the head

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIII</p>

  <p class="cpi">Emma Hart to Sir William Hamilton, at Persano</p>

  <p>NAPLES, Sunday might (7th of January) '87.</p>

  <p>Endead, my Sir William, I am angry. I told you one line would satisfie me,
  and when I have no other comfort then your letters, you should not so cruely
  disapoint me; for I am unhappy and I don't feil right without hearing from
  you, and I won't forgive you; no, that I won't. It is a very cold night, and
  I am just returned from Hart's. He was very cevil to me; there was an Abbé
  and a very genteel man, a friend of Andreas, and an Englishman I did not
  know; but they was all very polite, and such a profusion of diner that it is
  impossible to describe. I sett next to Hart, who would help me to everything,
  and poor man could not see, but to the best of his power paid me a number of
  compliments, and produced me as a specimen of English beauty. After diner he
  fetched an Italian song, that was made on Lady Sophi Jenner [?] forty years
  past, and he had translated it to English and would sing it; and when he came
  to dymond eyes and pearl teeth, he looked at me and bid the others look at
  me; and he is going to dedicate the English to me, and oh! you can't think,
  just as if he could see me and as if I was the most perfect beauty in the
  world. Endead, I heard the Abbé say to the others I was perfectly beautiful
  and elagantly behaved in my manners and conversation. And so the[y] all
  admired me. But Hart is quite gone. He is come [? coming] to see me to-night.
  Poor Tierny is very poorly.</p>

  <p><i>Monday morning</i>&mdash;Oh, thank you my dear Sir William, for your
  letter. Endead, I forgive you and am sorry I scolded you. The wind made me so
  sleepy that I slept till eight a clock, and was fast asleep when Vinchenzo
  brought your letter, and I read it in bed, and give it a good hug. But I
  wished you had been there. But I gave it a kiss or z. But I hope you will
  believe me sencere when I write to you; for endead, everything flows from my
  heart, and I cannot stop it. I am glad you had some good sport. I should like
  to see that that is zoo weight, for it must be a fine one; but the other z,
  that got of wounded, the[y] must be somewhere in great pain. Adio, my dear
  Sir William. Lying in bed so long [h]as made me hurry as this goes in half a
  minet. I was in bed last night at 8 a clock and slept till eight this
  morning.</p>

  <p>Yours ever,</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIV</p>

  <p class="cpi">The Same</p>

  <p>Monday night, Jany. the 8th, 1787.</p>

  <p>MY DEAR SIR WM.</p>

  <p>I don't know how you like this excessive cold wether; but I do think I
  never felt much colder in Inghilterra; for to-day it was impossible to keep
  one's self warm; and I pittied you much, for if you have not [had] a good
  sport you must be frose with standing still. The ice is lying abbout the
  streets in Naples, just as it is in London the hardest frosts there is. I now
  see that everything you say is true: for you told me to stop tell Jany. and
  then I should feil, and to-day [h]as fuly proved it.</p>

  <p>I was at Caletalino's to-day. She will make a very great likeness, and
  very pretty it will be. It shall not be two naked, for it would not be so
  interesting, and as you will have it in a box, it will be seen a good deal
  and those beautys that only you can see shall not be exposed to the common
  eyes of all and while you can even more than see the originals others may
  pass al them, for the are sacred to all but you, and I wish the was better
  for your sake. But I should not know how to mend them if I could though you
  don't like sugar loaves.</p>

  <p>Mr. Greffer was here yesterday, and z of his children. He enquired for you
  abbout money, and I told him, if he could stop or go to Borely or Marn Bem
  [?], but he says he will make shift tell he sees you, and I think he is
  right, if he can, for I would not go to those creatures for a grain, tho' it
  is a pitty you should be trubled with them.&mdash;Showrawky gives a diner
  to-moro to all his musick people, even the harpscord tuner, at
  Torre-del-Greco. All the Caletalinos go there, and I fancy there will be a
  fine mess of them altogether, for I don't hear of any body of fashion that is
  going. But he will be master of the Band, and they] will flatter him, and he
  will be in his kingdom come. It is a pitty he is so od, for I believe he
  [h]as a good heart. He has given Hackert the finest new sattin dress lined
  with sable besides a hundred guines a-pece for z little pictures, that I
  should think twenty enough for them, for I am of your opinion, I would pay
  for good things, but not for bad ones, and the[y] are pretty but not fine
  painting.</p>

  <p>I have Gallucey from nine to ten, from ten to twelve at the Caletalinos,
  from twelve to one my lesson, and between 2 and 3 my diner. I dine frequently
  upstairs, for Gasperino said a fire in that room must be to air it well, and
  the diner is cold before it gets to our room. So I have my diner very
  comfortable, endead. For if you was to know how kind everybody behaves to me,
  you would love them&mdash;<i>Tuesday morn:</i>&mdash;I have just received
  your kind letter, my dear Sir Wm. But how I was frightened in reading abbout
  those men. Sure they won't die. Oh low endead I will never bite your lips or
  your fingers no more. Good God! what a passion the[y] must have been in, but
  there ought to be some punishment to prevent them from such dreadful work. I
  am sorry you had not any sport. To stay out in the cold yesterday must be
  enugh to kill you. How I wish'd to give you some warm punch and settle you in
  my arms all night to make up for your bad day.</p>

  <p>I wish you would tell me something to say to Cune or Curney your man, in
  answer to what I wrote to you, or will you write to Gasperino to tell Sesos
  Maître d'Hotel the[y] shall not take his room from him? I am sorry to truble
  you. But as he asked me, I could not denigh to write to you. Adio and believe
  me</p>

  <p>Yours affectionately, my dearest Sir William, for ever,</p>

  <p>EMMA.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I am sorry you don't hear of coming home. But patienza.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XV</p>

  <p class="cpi">Emma, at Naples, to Sir William Hamilton, at Persan</p>

  <p>Wednesday, Zany. the loth, 1787.</p>

  <p>MY DEAR SIR WM.</p>

  <p>I had hardly time to thank you for your kind letter of this morning, as I
  was buisy prepairing for to go on my visit to the Convent of S. Romita; and
  endead I am glad I went, tho' it was a short visit. But to-morrow I dine with
  them in full assembly. I am quite charmed with Beatrice Acquaviva. Such is
  the name of the charming whoman I saw to-day. Oh, Sir William, she is a
  pretty whoman. She is 29 years old. She took the veil at twenty, and does not
  repent to this day, though, if I am a judge of physiognomy, her eyes does not
  look like the eyes of a nun. They are allways laughing, and something in them
  vastly alluring and I wonder the men of Naples would suffer the[ir] onely
  pretty whoman who is realy pretty to be shut in a convent. But it is like the
  mean-spirited ill taste of the Neapolitans. I told her I wondered how she
  would be lett to hide herself from the world, and I dare say thousands of
  tears was shed, the day she deprived Naples of one of its greatest ornaments.
  She answered with a sigh, that endead numbers of tears was shed, and once or
  twice her resolution was allmost shook, but a pleasing comfort she felt at
  regaining her friends, that she had been brought up [with], and religious
  considerations strengthened her mind, and she parted with the world with
  pleasure, and since that time one of her sisters had followed her example,
  and another&mdash;which I saw&mdash;was preparing to enter soon. But neither
  of her sisters is so beautiful as her, tho' the[y] are booth very agreable.
  But I think Beatrice is charming, and I realy feil for her an affection. Her
  eyes, Sir William, is I don't know how to describe them. I stopt one hour
  with them and I had all the good things to eat, and I promise you they don't
  starve themselves. But there dress is very becoming, and she told me that she
  was allowed to wear rings and mufs and any little thing she liked, and endead
  she displayed to-day a good deal of finery, for she had 4 or 5 dimond rings
  on her fingers, and seemed fond of her muff. She has excelent teeth, and
  shows them, for she is allways laughing. She kissed my lips, cheeks, and
  forehead, and every moment exclaimed "charming fine creature," admired my
  dress, said I looked like an angel, for I was in clear wite dimity and a blue
  sash. She admired my hat and fine hair, and she said she had heard I was good
  to the poor, and generous and noble-minded. "Now," she says, "it would be
  worth wile to live for such a one as you. Your good heart would melt at any
  trouble that befel me, and partake of one's greef or be equaly happy at one's
  good fortune. But I never met with a freind yet, or I ever saw a person I
  could love tell now, and you shall have proofs of my love." In short I sat
  and listened to her, and the tears stood in my eyes, I don't know why, but I
  loved her at that moment. I thought what a charming wife she would have made,
  what a mother of a family, and what a freind, and the first good and amiable
  whoman I have seen since I came to Naples for to be lost to the
  world&mdash;how cruel! She give me a sattin pocket-book of her own work, and
  bid me think of her when I saw it and was many miles far of; and years hence
  when she peraps should be no more, to look at it, and think the person that
  give it had not a bad heart. Did not she speak very pretty? but not one word
  of religion; but I shall be happy to-day, for I shall dine with them all, and
  come home at night. It is a beautiful house and garden, and the attention of
  them was very pleasing. There is sixty whomen and all well-looking, but not
  like the fair Beatrice. "Oh Emma," she says to me, "the[y] brought here the
  vieve [?] minister's wife, but I did not like the looks of her at first. She
  was little, short, pinched-face, and I received her cooly. How different from
  you, and how surprised was I in seeing you tall in statue [sic]. We may read
  your heart in your countenance, your complexion, in short, your figure and
  features is rare, for you are like the marble statues I saw, when I was in
  the world." I think she flatered me up, but I was pleased.&mdash;<i>Thursday
  Morning:</i>&mdash;I have just received your kind letter, and I am pleased
  and content that you should write to me, tho' it is onely one or two lines a
  day. Be assured I am grateful. I am sorry you had bad sport, and I shall be
  most happy to see you at home, to warm you with my kisses, and comfort you
  with my smiles and good humer, and oblidge you by my attentions, which will
  be the constant pleasure of, my Dear Sir William, your truly

  <p class="cpi">Emma Hart to Charles Greville</p>

  <p>NAPOLI, Agosto 4th, (1787).</p>

  <p>Alltho you never think me worth writing to, yet I cannot so easily forget
  you, and whenever I have had any particular pleasure, I feil as tho I was not
  right, tell I had communicated it to my dearest Greville. For you will ever
  be dear to me, and tho' we cannot be together, lett ous corespond as freinds.
  I have a happiness in hearing from you, and a comfort in communicating my
  little storeys to you, because I flatter myself that you still love the name
  of that Emma, that was once very dear to you, and, but for unfortunate evils,
  might still have claimed the first place in your affections. And I hope
  still, you will never meet with any person that will use you ill. But never
  will you meet with the sincere love that I shew'd you. Don't expect it; for
  you canot meet with it. But I have done. Onely think of my words;&mdash;you
  will meet with more evils than one, for, as Sir William says, that one is the
  devil...</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I send you a kiss on my name. It's more than you deserve. Next
  post I write to your Brother&mdash;abbout Wite, as he is my friend and I have
  assisted them a good deal and will more. Pray give my love to your brother,
  and compliments to Legg, Banks, Tollemache, &amp;c. Tell them to take care of
  their hearts, when I come back. As to you, you will be utterly undone. But
  Sir William allready is distractedly in love, and indead I love him tenderly.
  He deserves it.&mdash;God bless you!</p>

  <p class="footnote">[The above letter, written about a year after Emma's
  frantic outburst at Greville's treachery, shows that she had accepted her
  fate with philosophy and good humour; she continued to keep up a long
  correspondence with Greville, though after sending this she wrote him no more
  love letters.]</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Chiefly remembered now as the author of a famous book, <i>The Rights of
  Woman</i>, as the mother of Shelley's second wife, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin
  was considered of some importance by her contemporaries. Of gentle birth but
  brought up in the miserable home of a drunkard, Mary Wollstonecraft tried to
  gain independence as a companion, a governess, as a book-writer employed by
  Joseph Johnson, the bookseller and publisher. Fired by the French Revolution
  and by Tom Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i> she wrote <i>Rights of Woman</i>
  which gained her some fame and much abuse. She was then over thirty years of
  age&mdash;charming, handsome and unloved; full of theories and blinded by
  idealism she went to Paris to study "liberty at its source" and there met and
  fell passionately in love with Captain Gilbert Imlay, an American of about
  her own age. Yielding to a passion that she glossed over with an appearance
  of principle, Mary lived with this man as his wife. Soon after the birth of
  their child, he began to tire of her; Mary with desperate persistency tried
  to keep him; they returned to England and Mary tried to poison herself. A
  reconciliation was patched up and Mary and her child went to Norway on
  Imlay's business. On her return she discovered that her lover was living with
  a strolling actress and again tried to commit suicide, this time by throwing
  herself off Putney Bridge. She was rescued, parted finally from Imlay, who
  returned to France, and in despair married William Godwin, the philosopher
  and novelist, author of <i>Caleb Williams</i> and <i>Political Justice</i>;
  shortly afterwards Mary Godwin died at the birth of her daughter Mary. Imlay
  had returned her love letters; she gave these to her husband and he published
  them after her death, with the comment that they were as good as <i>The
  Sorrows of Werther</i>, the fashionable romantic novel of the day, and with a
  few discreet deletions.</p>

  <p>It is from this first edition that the following selection has been made:
  <i>Posthumous Works of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin</i>, 1798. The <i>Letters
  to Imlay</i> have also been edited by C. Kegan Paul, and by him published
  1879. The letters have been renumbered here, the numbers of the original
  collection being given in brackets.</p>

  <p>The first seven letters given here are selected from those written while
  Mary was happy in her love; from Letter VIII, the note of disillusion begins
  to sound; with Letter IX she is back in England, whither she had with her
  child followed the evasive and reluctant Imlay. The following letters show
  increasing doubt and trouble, Letter XII is written on the point of sailing
  to Norway after the first attempt at suicide. The next show an increasing
  despair that rises steadily to the final farewell that was, without doubt,
  Mary's death sentence.<br>

  <p class="pin">Mary Wollstonecraft to Gilbert Imlay</p>

  <p>PARIS, August 1793.</p>

  <p>Past twelve o'clock Monday night.</p>

  <p>I obey an emotion of my heart, which made me think of wishing thee, my
  love, good night! before I go to rest, with more tenderness than I can
  tomorrow, when writing a hasty line or two under Colonel &mdash;&mdash;'s
  eye. You can scarcely imagine with what pleasure I anticipate the day, when
  we are to begin almost to live together; and you would smile to hear how many
  plans of employment I have in my head, now that I am confident my heart has
  found peace in your bosom. Cherish me with that dignified tenderness, which I
  have only found in you; and your own dear girl will try to keep under a
  quickness of feeling, that has sometimes given you pain. Yes, I will be good,
  that I may deserve to be happy; and whilst you love me, I cannot again fall
  into the miserable state which rendered life a burthen almost too heavy to be
  borne.</p>

  <p>But, good night! God bless you! Sterne says that is equal to a
  kiss&mdash;yet I would rather give you the kiss into the bargain, glowing
  with gratitude to Heaven, and affection to you. I like the word affection,
  because it signifies something habitual; and we are soon to meet, to try
  whether we have mind enough to keep our hearts warm.</p>

  <p>I will be at the barrier a little after ten o'clock to-morrow.</p>

  <p>Yours,</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II [6]</p>

  <p>PARIS, December 1793.</p>

  <p>Friday morning.</p>

  <p>I am glad to find that other people can be unreasonable as well as myself,
  for be it known to thee, that I answered thy first letter the very night it
  reached me (Sunday), though thou couldst not receive it before Wednesday,
  because it was not sent off till the next day. There is a full, true and
  particular account.</p>

  <p>Yet I am not angry with thee, my love, for I think that it is a proof of
  stupidity, and, likewise, of a milk-and-water affection, which comes to the
  same thing, when the temper is governed by a square and compass. There is
  nothing picturesque in this straight-lined equality, and the passions always
  give grace to the actions.</p>

  <p>Recollection now makes my heart bound to thee; but, it is not to thy
  money-getting face, though I cannot be seriously displeased with the exertion
  which increases my esteem, or rather is what I should have expected from thy
  character. No; I have thy honest countenance before
  me&mdash;Pop&mdash;relaxed by tenderness; a little&mdash;little wounded by my
  whims; and thy eyes glistening with sympathy. Thy lips then feel softer than
  soft, and I rest my cheek on thine, forgetting all the world. I have not left
  the hue of love out of the picture&mdash;the rosy glow; and fancy has spread
  it over my own cheeks, I believe, for I feel them burning, whilst a delicious
  tear trembles in my eye, that would be all your own, if a grateful emotion,
  directed to the Father of nature, who has made me thus alive to happiness,
  did not give more warmth to the sentiment it divides. I must pause a
  moment.</p>

  <p>Need I tell you that I am tranquil after writing thus? I do not know why,
  but I have more confidence in your affection, when absent than present; nay,
  I think that you must love me, for, in the sincerity of my heart let me say
  it, I believe I deserve your tenderness, because I am true, and have a degree
  of sensibility that you can see and relish.</p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p>MARY.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER III [7]</p>

  <p>PARIS, December 29, 1793. Sunday Morning.</p>

  <p>You seem to have taken up your abode at Havre. Pray sir! when do you think
  of coming home? or, to write very considerately, when will business permit
  you? I shall expect (as the country people say in England) that you will make
  a power of money to indemnify me for your absence.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Well! but, my love, to the old story&mdash;am I to see you this week, or
  this month? I do not know what you are about, for, as you did not tell me, I
  would not ask Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who is generally pretty communicative.</p>

  <p>I long to see Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;; not to hear from you, so do not give
  yourself airs, but to get a letter from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. And I am half
  angry with you for not informing me whether she had brought one with her or
  not. On this score I will cork up some of the kind things that were ready to
  drop from my pen, which has never been dipt in gall when addressing you; or,
  will only suffer an exclamation&mdash;"The creature!" or a kind look to
  escape me, when I pass the slippers, which I could not remove from my salle
  door, though they are not the handsomest of their kind.</p>

  <p>Be not too anxious to get money! for nothing worth having is to be
  purchased. God bless you.</p>

  <p>Yours affectionately,</p>

  <p>MARY.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IV [12]</p>

  <p>PARIS, January 1794. Wednesday Morning.</p>

  <p>I will never, if I am not entirely cured of quarrelling, begin to
  encourage "quick-coming fancies," when we are separated. Yesterday, my love,
  I could not open your letter for some time; and, though it was not half as
  severe as I merited, it threw me into such a fit of trembling, as seriously
  alarmed me. I did not, as you may suppose, care for a little pain on my own
  account; but all the fears which I have had for a few days past, returned
  with fresh force. This morning I am better; will you not be glad to hear it?
  You perceive that sorrow has almost made a child of me, and that I want to be
  soothed to peace.</p>

  <p>One thing you mistake in my character, and imagine that to be coldness,
  which is just the contrary. For, when I am hurt by the person most dear to
  me, I must let out a whole torrent of emotions, in which tenderness would be
  uppermost, or stifle them altogether; and it appears to me almost a duty to
  stifle them when I imagine that I am treated with coldness.</p>

  <p>I am afraid that I have vexed you, my own love. I know the quickness of
  your feelings&mdash;and let me, in the sincerity of my heart, assure you,
  there is nothing I would not suffer to make you happy. My own happiness
  wholly depends on you; and, knowing you, when my reason is not clouded, I
  look forward to a rational prospect of as much felicity as the earth affords,
  with a little dash of rapture into the bargain, if you will look at me, when
  we meet again, as you have sometimes greeted your humbled, yet most
  affectionate</p>

  <p>MARY.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER V [18]</p>

  <p>1794. HAVRE, Thursday Morning, March 12.</p>

  <p>We are such creatures of habit, my love, that, though I cannot say I was
  sorry, childishly so, for your going, when I knew that you were to stay such
  a short time, and I had a plan of employment; yet I could not sleep. I turned
  to your side of the bed, and tried to make the most of the comfort of your
  pillow, which you used to tell me I was churlish about; but all would not do.
  I took, nevertheless, my walk before breakfast, though the weather was not
  inviting&mdash;and here I am, wishing you a finer day, and seeing you peep
  over my shoulder, as I write, with one of your kindest looks&mdash;when your
  eyes glisten, and a suffusion creeps over your relaxing features.</p>

  <p>But I do not mean to dally with you this morning. So God bless you! Take
  care of yourself, and sometimes fold to your heart your affectionate</p>

  <p>MARY.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VI [27]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 1794. October 26.</p>

  <p>MY DEAR LOVE,</p>

  <p>I began to wish so earnestly to hear from you, that the sight of your
  letters occasioned such pleasurable emotions, I was obliged to throw them
  aside till the little girl and I were alone together; and this said little
  girl, our darling, is become a most intelligent little creature, and as gay
  as a lark, and that in the morning too, which I do not find quite so
  convenient. I once told you, that the sensations before she was born, and
  when she is sucking, were pleasant; but they do not deserve to be compared to
  the emotions I feel, when she stops to smile upon me, or laughs outright on
  meeting me unexpectedly in the street, or after a short absence. She has now
  the advantage of having two good nurses, and I am at present able to
  discharge my duty to her, without being the slave of it.</p>

  <p>I have therefore employed and amused myself since I got rid of
  &mdash;&mdash;, and am making a progress in the language, amongst other
  things. I have also made some new acquaintance. I have almost charmed a judge
  of the tribunal, R&mdash;&mdash;, who, though I should not have thought it
  possible, has humanity, if not <i>beaucoup d'esprit</i>. But let me tell you,
  if you do not make haste back, I shall be half in love with the author of the
  Marseillaise, who is a handsome man, a little too broad-faced or so, and
  plays sweetly on the violin.</p>

  <p>What do you say to this threat? Why, <i>entre nous</i>, I like to give way
  to a sprightly vein when writing to you, that is, when I am pleased with you.
  "The devil," you know, is proverbially said to be "in a good humour when he
  is pleased." Will you not then be a good boy, and come back quickly to play
  with your girls? but I shall not allow you to love the new-comer best.</p>

  <p>My heart longs for your return, my love, and only looks for, and seeks
  happiness with you; yet do not imagine that I childishly wish you to come
  back before you have arranged things in such a manner that it will not be
  necessary for you to leave us soon again, or to make exertions which injure
  your constitution.</p>

  <p>Yours most truly and tenderly,</p>

  <p>MARY.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;You would oblige me by delivering the inclosed to Mr.
  &mdash;&mdash;, and pray call for an answer. It is for a person uncomfortably
  situated.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VII [24]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 1794. Evening, September 23.</p>

  <p>I have been playing and laughing with the little girl so long, that I
  cannot take up my pen to address you without emotion. Pressing her to my
  bosom, she looked so like you (<i>entre nous</i>, your best looks, for I do
  not admire your commercial face), every nerve seemed to vibrate to the touch,
  and I began to think that there was something in the assertion of man and
  wife being one&mdash;for you seemed to pervade my whole frame, quickening the
  beat of my heart, and lending me the sympathetic tears you excited.</p>

  <p>Have I anything more to say to you? No; not for the present&mdash;the rest
  is all flown away; and indulging tenderness for you, I cannot now complain of
  some people here, who have ruffled my temper for two or three days past.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VIII [32]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 1795. January 9.</p>

  <p>I just now received one of your hasty notes; for business so entirely
  occupies you, that you have not time, or sufficient command of thought, to
  write letters. Beware! you seem to be got into a whirl of projects and
  schemes, which are drawing you into a gulf that, if it do not absorb your
  happiness, will infallibly destroy mine.</p>

  <p>Fatigued during my youth by the most arduous struggles, not only to obtain
  independence, but to render myself useful, not merely pleasure, for which I
  had the most lively taste&mdash;I mean the simple pleasures that flow from
  passion and affection&mdash;escaped me, but the most melancholy views of life
  were impressed by a disappointed heart on my mind. Since I knew you I have
  been endeavouring to go back to my former nature, and have allowed some time
  to glide away, winged with the delight which only spontaneous enjoyment can
  give. Why have you so soon dissolved the charm?</p>

  <p>I am really unable to bear the continual inquietude which your and
  &mdash;&mdash;'s never-ending plans produce. This you may term want of
  firmness, but you are mistaken; I have still sufficient firmness to pursue my
  principle of action. The present misery, I cannot find a softer word to do
  justice to my feelings, appears to me unnecessary, and therefore I have not
  firmness to support it as you may think I ought. I should have been content,
  and still wish, to retire with you to a farm. My God! anything but these
  continual anxieties, anything but commerce, which debases the mind, and roots
  out affection from the heart.</p>

  <p>I do not mean to complain of subordinate inconveniences; yet I will simply
  observe that, led to expect you every week, I did not make the arrangements
  required by the present circumstances, to procure the necessaries of life. In
  order to have them, a servant, for that purpose only, is indispensable. The
  want of wood has made me catch the most violent cold I ever had; and my head
  is so disturbed by continual coughing, that I am unable to write without
  stopping frequently to recollect myself. This, however, is one of the common
  evils which must be borne with&mdash;bodily pain does not touch the heart,
  though it fatigues the spirits.</p>

  <p>Still, as you talk of your return, even in February, doubtingly, I have
  determined, the moment the weather changes, to wean my child. It is too soon
  for her to begin to divide sorrow! And as one has well said, "despair is a
  freeman," we will go and seek our fortune together.</p>

  <p>This is not a caprice of the moment, for your absence has given new weight
  to some conclusions that I was very reluctantly forming before you left me. I
  do not choose to be a secondary object. If your feelings were in unison with
  mine, you would not sacrifice so much to visionary prospects of future
  advantage.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IX [33)</p>

  <p>PARIS, 1795. January 15.</p>

  <p>I was just going to begin my letter with the fag end of a song, which
  would only have told you what I may as well say simply, that it is pleasant
  to forgive those we love. I have received your two letters, dated the 26th
  and 28th of December, and my anger died away. You can scarcely conceive the
  effect some of your letters have produced on me. After longing to hear from
  you during a tedious interval of suspense, I have seen a superscription
  written by you. Promising myself pleasure, and feeling emotion, I have laid
  it by me, till the person who brought it left the room, when&mdash;behold! on
  opening it, I have found only half-a-dozen hasty lines, that have damped all
  the rising affection of my soul.</p>

  <p>Well, now for business&mdash;<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>My animal is well; I have not yet taught her to eat but nature is doing
  the business. I gave her a crust to assist the cutting of her teeth; and now
  she has two, she makes good use of them to gnaw a crust, biscuit, etc. You
  would laugh to see her; she is just like a little squirrel; she will guard a
  crust for two hours; and, after fixing her eye on an object for some time,
  dart on it with an aim as sure as a bird of prey&mdash;nothing can equal her
  life and spirits. I suffer from a cold; but it does not affect her. Adieu! Do
  not forget to love us&mdash;and come soon to tell us that you do.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER X [35]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 1795. February 9.</p>

  <p>The melancholy presentiment has for some time hung on my spirits, that we
  were parted for ever; and the letters I received this day, by Mr.
  &mdash;&mdash;, convince me that it was not without foundation. You allude to
  some other letters, which I suppose have miscarried; for most of those I have
  got, were only a few hasty lines, calculated to wound the tenderness the
  sight of the superscriptions excited.</p>

  <p>I mean not however to complain; yet so many feelings are struggling for
  utterance, and agitating a heart almost bursting with anguish, that I find it
  very difficult to write with any degree of coherence.</p>

  <p>You left me indisposed, though you have taken no notice of it; and the
  most fatiguing journey I ever had, contributed to continue it. However, I
  recovered my health; but a neglected cold, and continual inquietude during
  the last two months, have reduced me to a state of weakness I never before
  experienced. Those who did not know that the canker-worm was at work at the
  core, cautioned me about suckling my child too long. God preserve this poor
  child, and render her happier than her mother!</p>

  <p>But I am wandering from my subject; indeed my head turns giddy, when I
  think that all the confidence I have had in the affection of others is come
  to this. I did not expect this blow from you. I have done my duty to you and
  my child; and if I am not to have any return of affection to reward me, I
  have the sad consolation of knowing that I deserved a better fate. My soul is
  weary, I am sick at heart; and, but for this little darling, I would cease to
  care about a life, which is now stripped of every charm.</p>

  <p>You see how stupid I am, uttering declamation, when I meant simply to tell
  you, that I consider your requesting me to come to you, as merely dictated by
  honour. Indeed I scarcely understand you. You request me to come, and then
  tell me that you have not given up all thoughts of returning to this
  place.</p>

  <p>When I determined to live with you, I was only governed by affection. I
  would share poverty with you, but I turn with affright from the sea of
  trouble on which you are entering. I have certain principles of action; I
  know what I look for to found my happiness on. It is not money. With you I
  wished for sufficient to procure the comforts of life, as it is, less will
  do. I can still exert myself to obtain the necessaries of life for my child,
  and she does not want more at present. I have two or three plans in my head
  to earn our subsistence; for do not suppose that, neglected by you, I will
  lie under obligations of a pecuniary kind to you! No; I would sooner submit
  to menial service. I wanted the support of your affection; that gone, all is
  over! I did not think, when I complained of &mdash;&mdash;'s contemptible
  avidity to accumulate money, that he would have dragged you into his
  schemes.</p>

  <p>I cannot write. I inclose a fragment of a letter, written soon after your
  departure, and another which tenderness made me keep back when it was
  written. You will see then the sentiments of a calmer, though not a more
  determined moment. Do not insult me by saying, that "our being together is
  paramount to every other consideration! "Were it, you would not be running
  after a bubble, at the expense of my peace of mind.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this is the last letter you will ever receive from me.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XI [37]</p>

  <p>PARIS, 1795. February 19.</p>

  <p>When I first received your letter, putting off your return to an
  indefinite time, I felt so hurt that I know not what I wrote. I am now
  calmer, though it was not the kind of wound over which time has the quickest
  effect; on the contrary, the more I think, the sadder I grow. Society
  fatigues me inexpressibly. So much so, that finding fault with everyone, I
  have only reason enough to discover that the fault is in myself. My child
  alone interests me, and, but for her, I should not take any pains to recover
  my health.</p>

  <p>As it is, I shall wean her, and try if by that step (to which I feel a
  repugnance, for it is my only solace) I can get rid of my cough. Physicians
  talk much of the danger attending any complaint on the lungs, after a woman
  has suckled for some months. They lay a stress also on the necessity of
  keeping the mind tranquil&mdash;and, my God! how has mine been harassed! But
  whilst the caprices of other women are gratified, "the wind of heaven not
  suffered to visit them too rudely," I have not found a guardian angel, in
  heaven or on earth, to ward off sorrow or care from my bosom.</p>

  <p>What sacrifices have you not made for a woman you did not respect! But I
  will not go over this ground. I want to tell you that I do not understand
  you. You say that you have not given up all thoughts of returning
  here&mdash;and I know that it will be necessary&mdash;nay is. I cannot
  explain myself; but if you have not lost your memory, you will easily divine
  my meaning. What! is our life then only to be made up of separations? and am
  I only to return to a country, that has not merely lost all charms for me,
  but for which I feel a repugnance that almost amounts to horror, only to be
  left there a prey to it!</p>

  <p>Why is it so necessary that I should return? brought up here, my girl
  would be freer. Indeed, expecting you to join us, I had formed some plans of
  usefulness that have now vanished with my hopes of happiness.</p>

  <p>In the bitterness of my heart, I could complain with reason, that I am
  left here dependent on a man, whose avidity to acquire a fortune has rendered
  him callous to every sentiment connected with social or affectionate
  emotions. With a brutal insensibility, he cannot help displaying the pleasure
  your determination to stay gives him, in spite of the effect it is visible it
  has had on me.</p>

  <p>Till I can earn money, I shall endeavour to borrow some, for I want to
  avoid asking him continually for the sum necessary to maintain me. Do not
  mistake me, I have never been refused. Yet, I have gone half a dozen times to
  the house to ask for it, and come away without speaking&mdash;you must guess
  why. Besides, I wish to avoid hearing of the eternal projects to which you
  have sacrificed my peace&mdash;not remembering, but I will be silent for
  ever&mdash;</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XII [39]</p>

  <p>1795. BRIGHTHELMSTONE, Saturday, April 11.</p>

  <p>Here we are, my love, and mean to set out early in the morning; and, if I
  can find you, I hope to dine with you to-morrow. I shall drive to
  &mdash;&mdash;'s hotel, where &mdash;&mdash; tells me you have been
  &mdash;&mdash; and, if you have left it, I hope you will take care to be
  there to receive us.</p>

  <p>I have brought with me Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s little friend, and a girl whom
  I like to take care of our little darling, not on the way, for that fell to
  my share. But why do I write about trifles? or anything? are we not to meet
  soon? What does your heart say?</p>

  <p>Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIII [41]</p>

  <p>May 27, 1795. Wednesday.</p>

  <p>I inclose you the letter which you desired me to forward, and I am tempted
  very laconically to wish you a good morning, not because I am angry, or have
  nothing to say; but to keep down a wounded spirit. I shall make every effort
  to calm my mind, yet a strong conviction seems to whirl round in the very
  centre of my brain, which, like the fiat of fate, emphatically assures me
  that grief has a firm hold of my heart.</p>

  <p>God bless you!</p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p>MARY.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIV [77]</p>

  <p>LONDON, December 1795.</p>

  <p>You must do as you please with respect to the child. I could wish that it
  might be done soon, that my name may be no more mentioned to you. It is now
  finished. Convinced that you have neither regard nor friendship, I disdain to
  utter a reproach, though I have had reason to think that the "forbearance"
  talked of has not been very delicate. It is, however, of no consequence. I am
  glad that you are satisfied with your own conduct.</p>

  <p>I now solemnly assure you, that this is an eternal farewell. Yet I flinch
  not from the duties which tie me to life.</p>

  <p>That there is "sophistry" on one side or another, is certain; but now it
  matters not on which. On my part it has not been a question of words. Yet
  your understanding or mine must be strangely warped, for what you term
  "delicacy," appears to me to be exactly the contrary. I have no criterion for
  morality, and have thought in vain of the sensations which lead you to follow
  an ancle or step, be the sacred foundation of principle or affection. Mine
  has been of a very different nature, or it would not have stood the brunt of
  your sarcasms.</p>

  <p>The sentiment in me is still sacred. If there be any part of me that will
  survive the sense of my misfortunes, it is the purity of my affections. The
  impetuosity of your senses may have led you to term mere animal desire, the
  source of principle; and it may give zest to some years to come. Whether you
  will always think so, I shall never know.</p>

  <p>It is strange that, in spite of all you do, something like conviction
  forces me to believe that you are not what you appear to be.</p>

  <p>I part with you in peace.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XV [53]</p>

  <p>GOTHENBURG, 1795. June 29.</p>

  <p>I wrote to you by the last post, to inform you of my arrival; and I
  believe I alluded to the extreme fatigue I endured on ship-board, owing to
  Marguerite's illness and the roughness of the weather. I likewise mentioned
  to you my fall, the effects of which I still feel, though I do not think it
  will have any serious consequences.</p>

  <p>&mdash;&mdash; will go with me, if I find it necessary to go to Stromstad.
  The inns here are so bad, I was forced to accept an apartment in his house. I
  am overwhelmed with civilities on all sides, and fatigued with the endeavours
  to amuse me, from which I cannot escape.</p>

  <p>My friend&mdash;my friend, I am not well; a deadly weight of sorrow lies
  heavily on my heart. I am again tossed on the troubled billows of life; and
  obliged to cope with difficulties, without being buoyed up by the hopes that
  alone render them bearable. "How flat, dull and unprofitable" appears to me
  all the bustle into which I see people here so eagerly enter! I long every
  night to go to bed, to hide my melancholy face in my pillow; but there is a
  canker-worm in my bosom that never sleeps.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XVI [69]</p>

  <p>LONDON, November 1795.</p>

  <p>I write you now on my knees; imploring you to send my child and the maid
  with &mdash;&mdash;, to Paris to be consigned to the care of Madame
  &mdash;&mdash;, Rue &mdash;&mdash;, Section de &mdash;&mdash;. Should they be
  removed &mdash;&mdash; can give their direction.</p>

  <p>Let the maid have all my clothes without distinction.</p>

  <p>Pray pay the cook her wages, and do not mention the confession which I
  forced from her; a little sooner or later is of no consequence. Nothing but
  my extreme stupidity could have rendered me blind so long. Yet, whilst you
  assured me that you had no attachment, I thought we might still have lived
  together.</p>

  <p>I shall make no comments on your conduct or any appeal to the world. Let
  my wrongs sleep with me! Soon, very soon, I shall be at peace. When you
  receive this, my burning head will be cold.</p>

  <p>I would encounter a thousand deaths, rather than a night like the last.
  Your treatment has thrown my mind into a state of chaos; yet I am serene. I
  go to find comfort, and my only fear is, that my poor body will be insulted
  by an endeavour to recall my hated existence. But I shall plunge into the
  Thames where there is the least chance of my being snatched from the death I
  seek.</p>

  <p>God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me
  endure. Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your
  heart; and, in the midst of business and sensual pleasure, I shall appear
  before you, the victim of your deviation from rectitude.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[The above letter was written after a frightful scene
  with Imlay. Mary's cook had told her where Imlay kept his new mistress, Mary
  had gone to this house and caught the lovers together; on her return Mary
  passed a night of delirium and the next morning wrote the above note that she

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XVII [70]</p>

  <p>LONDON, November 1795. Sunday Morning.</p>

  <p>I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was
  inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not
  to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic
  attempt which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am
  only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is
  by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.</p>

  <p>You say, "that you know not how to extricate ourselves out of the
  wretchedness into which we have been plunged." You are extricated long since.
  But I forbear to comment. If I am condemned to live longer, it is a living
  death.</p>

  <p>It appears to me that you lay much more stress on delicacy than on
  principle; for I am unable to discover what sentiment of delicacy would have
  been violated by your visiting a wretched friend, if indeed you have any
  friendship for me. But since your new attachment is the only sacred thing in
  your eyes, I am silent&mdash;Be happy! My complaints shall never more damp
  your enjoyment; perhaps I am mistaken in supposing that even my death could,
  for more than a moment. This is what you call magnanimity. It is happy for
  yourself, that you possess this quality in the highest degree.</p>

  <p>Your continually asserting that you will do all in your power to
  contribute to my comfort, when you only allude to pecuniary assistance,
  appears to me a flagrant breach of delicacy. I want not such vulgar comfort,
  nor will I accept it. I never wanted but your heart&mdash;That gone, you have
  nothing more to give. Had I only poverty to fear, I should not shrink from
  life. Forgive me then, if I say, that I shall consider any direct or indirect
  attempt to supply my necessities, as an insult which I have not merited, and
  as rather done out of tenderness for your own reputation, than for me. Do not
  mistake me; I do not think that you value money, therefore I will not accept
  what you do not care for, though I do much less, because certain privations
  are not painful to me. When I am dead, respect for yourself will make you
  take care of the child.</p>

  <p>I write with difficulty&mdash;probably I shall never write to you again.
  Adieu!</p>

  <p>God bless you!</p>

  <p>LONDON, December 1795.</p>

  <p>As the parting from you for ever is the most serious event of my life, I
  will once more expostulate with you, and call not the language of truth and
  feeling ingenuity!</p>

  <p>I know the soundness of your understanding, and know that it is impossible
  for you always to confound the caprices of every wayward inclination with
  manly dictates of principle.</p>

  <p>You tell me "that I torment you." Why do I? Because you cannot estrange
  your heart entirely from me, and you feel that justice is on my side. You
  urge "that your conduct was unequivocal." It was not. When your coolness has
  hurt me, with what tenderness have you endeavoured to remove the impression!
  and even before I returned to England, you took great pains to convince me
  that all my uneasiness was occasioned by the effect of a worn-out
  constitution; and you concluded your letter with these words, "Business alone
  has kept me from you. Come to any port, and I will fly down to my two dear
  girls with a heart all their own."</p>

  <p>With these assurances, is it extraordinary that I should believe what I
  wished? I might, and did think that you had a struggle with old propensities;
  but I still thought that I and virtue should at last prevail. I still thought
  that you had a magnanimity of character, which would enable you to conquer
  yourself.</p>

  <p>Imlay, believe me, it is not romance, you have acknowledged to me feelings
  of this kind. You could restore me to life and hope, and the satisfaction you
  would feel would amply repay you.</p>

  <p>In tearing myself from you, it is my own heart I pierce; and the time will
  come, when you will lament that you have thrown away a heart, that, even in
  the moment of passion, you cannot despise. I would owe everything to your
  generosity, but, for God's sake, keep me no longer in suspense! Let me see
  you once more!</p>

  <p style="margin-left:50%">&mdash;WALTER RALEIGH<br>
  Letters to Emma, Lady Hamilton</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Lord Nelson has one of the most famous names and one of the most
  unattractive characters in British history. Those who wish to preserve the
  conventional view of him had better leave the facts of his life alone. A
  great sailor, maddened by ill health and ambition, jealousy and vanity, his
  showy naval successes were all Pitt's Government had to show the people for a
  long, costly and badly managed war. Nelson, however, ruined his chances of
  climbing those social heights towards which he always had looked so longingly
  by his open infatuation for Lady Hamilton, a married woman with an ugly past,
  and the subsequent breach with his own wife. Lady Hamilton's story is told in
  front of her own letters to Greville and her husband. The following letters
  were written at sea during the last four years of Lord Nelson's life; they
  form a small selection from the huge correspondence that passed between the
  hero and his 'divine Lady,' and exclude the hysterical "Thompson" letters,
  the authenticity of which has been in dispute. The letters given here are
  taken from: <i>Memoirs of the Life of Vice-Admiral Lord Viscount Nelson,
  K.B.</i>, Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, 2nd Volume, London, 1848.</p>

  <p>The history of the letters is as follows:</p>

  <p>In 1806, a journalist, by name Harrison, put out a life of Lord Nelson,
  with the sanction of Lady Hamilton, who supplied much of the material. In
  1814 this same Harrison published a collection of Nelson's letters which had
  either been sold to him by Lady Hamilton or by him stolen from her while he
  worked with her on the "Life." Their authenticity can hardly be questioned,
  however. The letters, together with many others, were published by Sir Harris
  Nicolas, and then came into the hands of Dr. Pettigrew, who published them
  "with a mass of correspondence" in 1848. The first thirteen letters date from
  1801 when Lord Nelson, recently created a Vice-Admiral, was sent to attack
  Copenhagen; the Hamiltons were then living in his houses at Merton and
  London. At the end of the year an Armistice was signed; Nelson was created a
  Viscount, and returned to Merton and Emma.</p>

  <p>In 1803 Sir William Hamilton died, and Nelson, appointed to the
  Mediterranean Fleet, kept watch on Toulon. From off this port, he wrote
  Letter XIV with anxious thought for the provision of his loved ones. Letter
  XV shows the weariness of the exile and the last five letters were written on
  board the <i>Victory</i>, during Nelson's last voyage. Letter XX is Nelson's
  farewell to Emma, written two days before the Battle of Trafalgar.<br>

  <p class="cpi">Lord Nelson to Lady Hamilton</p>

  <p>AXMINSTER, January 14th, 1801. 8 o'clock.</p>

  <p>MY DEAR LADY HAMILTON,</p>

  <p>We set off from Southampton at eight o'clock this morning, and got to Mr.
  Rose's* at half-past nine, but found him gone to London, therefore I had my
  trouble for nothing but the pleasure of trying to serve my brother. Anxiety
  for friends left, and various workings of my imagination gave me one of those
  severe pains of the heart that all the windows were obliged to be put down,
  the carriage stopped, and the perspiration was so strong that I never was
  wetter, and yet dead with cold. However, it is gone off, and here I am, and
  while I live, your affectionate,</p>

  <p>NELSON.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II</p>

  <p class="cpi">The Same</p>

  <p>April 5th, 1801.</p>

  <p>MY DEAREST FRIEND,</p>

  <p>I am really tired out. Would to God it was all over, and I safely landed
  in England. On the 3rd I was sent on shore to talk to the Prince Royal. I
  believe I told him such truths as seldom reach the ears of princes. The
  people received me as they always have done; and even the stairs of the
  palace were crowded, huzzaing, and saying, God bless Lord Nelson. I rather
  believe these kind salutations were not very pleasing to the Royal ears, nor
  Count Bernstorf,1 to whom I gave a very broad hint that his proceedings were
  very foolish. However, he was very civil. The Prince, upon many points,
  seemed to quake; for on his question, "for what is the British fleet come
  into the Baltic?" my answer was not to be misunderstood:&mdash;"To crush the
  formidable armament, of which Denmark is to contribute her part, preparing
  against Great Britain."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs.]</p>

  <p>However, it has brought forward a negotiation; and if they have not
  enough, we must try and get at their arsenal and city, that will sicken them
  if they have not had enough. The carnage was dreadful on board all their
  vessels. I saw on shore a Captain Biller, now a Commodore, who commanded a
  Danish frigate at Naples; he inquired kindly after you and Sir William; he
  had often been at your house; aye, who had not that happiness? for you ever
  was, and ever I am sure will be good. You must know you have been in the
  battle: for your two pictures, one done by Miss Knight, crowning the Rostral
  Column, the other done at Dresden (I call them my Guardian Angels; and I
  believe there would be more virtue in the prayers of Santa Emma, than any
  saint in the whole Calendar of Rome), I carried on board the <i>Elephant</i>
  with me, and they are safe, and so am I, not a scratch. To-day I have been
  obliged to write a letter to Lord St. Vincent, which I hope will touch his
  heart. God knows it has mine; it was recommending to his protecting hand the
  widows and orphans of those brave men who lost their lives for their King and
  country under my orders. It positively made my heart run out of my
  eyes&mdash;it brought fresh to my recollection, that only when I spoke to
  them all, and shook hands with every Captain, wishing them all with laurel
  crowns, alas! too many are covered with cypress. The Commander-in-Chief has
  just told me that the vessel goes to England this night if possible. May the
  heavens bless you, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>NELSON AND BRONTE.</p>

  <p>My best regards to Sir William, the Duke, Lord William, and all my
  friends. Kindest regards to Mrs. Nelson, if she is with you, which I hope she
  is.</p>

  <p>Your letter of yesterday naturally called forth all those finer feelings
  of the sort which none but those who regard each other as you and I do can
  conceive, although I am not able to write so well, and so forcibly mark my
  feelings as you can. Not one moment I have to myself, and my business is
  endless. At noon I set off for Faversham to arrange the Sea Fencibles on that
  part of the coast; at nine o'clock I expect to be at Deal to arrange with
  Admiral Lutwidge various matters; and to-morrow evening, or next day morning,
  to sail for the coast of France, that I may judge from my own eye, and not
  from those of others. Be where I may, you are always present to my

  <p>Boulogne is evidently not a pleasant place this morning. Three of their

  assuredly they are gone there. In fire or out of fire I am,</p>

  <p>NELSON AND BRONTE.</p>

  <p>Tell the Duke and Lord William that the embarkation of the French army
  will not take place at Boulogne. Beyond this I cannot say. In my visits to
  the bombs in my barge, my friends think the French have been very attentive
  to me, for they did nothing but fire at the boat and the different vessels I
  was in, but God is good.</p>

  with the truest affection. I am on my way to Ostend and Flushing, and shall
  probably be off Margate on Friday. Captain Gore is very kind and good to me,
  for I must be a great plague to him. I have to thank him even for a bed. I
  have only one moment to write this, as Admiral Lutwidge sent his own boat
  with my letters of this day's post. Best regards to Mrs. Nelson, kind love to

  <p>MY DEAREST FRIEND, how tiresome and alone I feel at not having the
  pleasure of receiving your dear, kind, friendly, and intelligent letters. I
  literally feel as a fish out of water. Calms and foul winds have already
  prolonged our passage, from what is often done in fourteen hours to three
  days, and yet no appearance of our arrival this day. It now snows and rains,
  and nearly calm. All day yesterday I was employed about a very necessary
  thing; and I assure you it gave me pleasure, instead of pain, the reflection
  that I was providing for a dear friend. I have given you, by will, £3,000,
  and three diamond boxes, and the King of Naples's picture in trust, to be at
  your disposal, so that it is absolutely your own. By the codicil, I have
  given you the money owing me by Sir William, likewise in trust. The trustees
  are, Mr. Ryder, a very eminent law man, and Mr. Davison; they will be my
  executors. If you like anybody else, say so, and it shall be done. The star I
  have given you to wear for my sake. You must not think, my dearest friend,
  that this necessary act hastens our departure, but it is a right and proper
  measure.</p>

  <p>I have bought your picture,* for I could not bear it should be put up at
  auction, and if it had cost me 300 drops of blood I would have given it with
  pleasure. I think the picture had better be delivered to Mr. Davison packed
  up, and I have charged him not to mention it, or to chew it to any soul
  breathing. I design it always to hang in my bedchamber, and if I die it is
  yours. After we get into the Baltic it may be very dangerous writing, for if
  the vessel is taken, which is very probable, my correspondence will certainly
  be published, therefore I shall never sign my name in future. Heavens bless
  you. Send my letter and order to Mr. Christie directly.</p>

  <p>I send by the coach a little parcel containing the keys of the plate chest
  and the case of the tea urn, and there is a case of Colebrook Dale breakfast
  set, and some other things. Mr. Dods had better go to the house for he is
  Davison's man. Will you have your picture carried to Merton? I should wish
  it, and mine of the Battle of the Nile. I think you had better not have Sir
  William's books, or anything but what is my own. I have sent in the parcel by
  the coach this day, two salt-cellars, and two ladles, which will make four of
  each, as two are in the chest. You will also find spoons and forks sufficient
  for the present. If sheets are wanting for the beds, will you order some and
  let me have the bill. I also think that not a servant of Sir William's I mean
  the cook, should be in the house, but I leave this and all other matters to
  your good management. Would to God I could come and take up my abode there,
  and if such a thing should happen that I go abroad, I can under my hand lend
  you the house that no person can molest you, not that I have at present any
  idea of going anywhere but to Merton. Do you take black James? Do as you
  please. I have no desire one way or the other. Our dear Parker's
  circumstances are a little out of order, but I have undertaken to settle them
  if the creditors will give me time, for the poor father is worse than
  nothing. I have given him money to buy mourning and to pay his passage home
  again. I trust in God that he will never let me want, for I find no man who
  starts up to assist me. I can with a quiet conscience when all is gone, live
  upon bread and cheese. Never mind so long as I have your friendship warm from
  the heart. I have got some of dear Parker's hair, which I value more than if
  he had left me a bulse of diamonds. I have sent it in the little box, keep
  some of it for poor Nelson.</p>

  I trust, my dearest friend, that you will (if it should please God to take me

  innocent, for it would add comforts to my last moments to think that she
  would be educated in the paths of religion and virtue, and receive as far as

  <p>Napoleon Bonaparte was born in Ajaccio, the capital of Corsica, soon after
  it had been annexed to France; his family was noble and distinguished by the
  abilities of its members. At the age of eleven Napoleon was sent to France,
  as a cadet at the Military Academy of Brienne. Here he distinguished himself
  by brilliant gifts and an intense application to study; after a further
  period of training in the Military College at Paris, the young Corsican was
  commissioned to the regiment of La Fère. Wide reading, intense study and
  frequent visits to his widowed mother and financially embarrassed family in
  Corsica filled the young soldier's life until the beginning of the French
  Revolution in 1789. Napoleon at once showed Republican fervour and during one
  of his visits to Ajaccio threw himself into the democratic rising of the
  Corsicans under Paoli; later, however, disgusted by Paoli's turning for help
  to England, Napoleon raised a party against him, with the result that the
  Bonaparte family took refuge in France, with which country the young soldier
  henceforth identified himself (1793).</p>

  <p>His stand against Paoli brought Napoleon to the notice of some of the
  extremists then in power, among them Robespierre, and he was sent in command
  of the artillery with the army employed to suppress the Girondin revolt.</p>

  <p>In the end of 1793 Napoleon scored his first success by forcing the
  English to evacuate Toulon which had been delivered into their hands by the
  Royalists; Napoleon did further brilliant work on the Mediterranean coast,
  but was reduced to inactivity on the fall of Robespierre, July 1794. On the
  establishment of the Directory, however, Napoleon was appointed second in
  command to Barras of the Army of the Republic, soon after, at the instance of
  that man of genius, Lazare Carnot, he was given command of the Army sent to
  invade Italy, where the enemies of the French Government were installed. In
  1794 he had met Josephine Beauharnais, and before he left for Italy in 1796
  he married her; this lady, born in the isle of Martinique in 1763, had been
  married at the age of fourteen years to the Vicomte de Beauharnais by whom
  she had two children, Eugène and Hortense. During the revolution she and her
  husband were imprisoned and de Beauharnais was beheaded. In prison Madame
  Beauharnais had met the future Madame Tallien, and when the two ladies were
  released they became leaders in the reckless post-revolutionary society where
  the brilliant and fascinating Josephine was "gayest of the gay."</p>

  <p>Napoleon fell passionately in love with her and she responded dazzled
  either by his personality or by his rising star, but, during his absence in
  Italy her coquetry, if it was no more, gave him sharp cause for jealousy. She
  used her influence, however, to aid his ambitions, and was on the whole a
  loyal good-natured wife, if an extravagant and reckless woman. She remained
  by Napoleon's side during all the triumphs of his astounding career as the
  most powerful military dictator that Europe has known, and was crowned with
  him in Notre Dame, Paris, 1804. Five years later Napoleon, wishful of an heir
  and to unite himself to the ancient House of Hapsburg, divorced Josephine,
  who had brought him no children, and married Marie Louise, daughter of the
  Emperor Francis. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo and died in exile
  in St. Helena 1821&mdash;during a violent hurricane. In 1840 his remains were
  transported with great pomp to Paris, where they were placed in the tomb
  designed by Pradier in the Chapel of the Invalides.</p>

  <p>After her divorce Josephine retired to the charming little country house
  of Malmaison; her former husband wrote to her, and even saw her occasionally
  and her behaviour was resigned and dignified; she said farewell to the
  Emperor in January 1814, a few months before he was sent to Elba, and she
  died in the May of that year. The letters given here were written by Napoleon
  in 1796, one before his marriage, the others during the Italian campaign.</p>

  <p>Their history is as follows; they were given to Charles Tennant by a
  Polish nobleman who had been with the Empress at the time of her death and
  published as an appendix to the second volume of Mr. Tennant's book: <i>A
  Tour through Parts of the Netherlands, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Savoy
  and France, in the year 1822.</i> London.</p>

  <p>The author gives the literal translation here used, the French originals
  and facsimiles of the letters, together with documents to prove their
  authenticity. Napoleon's handwriting was extremely difficult and the lacunae
  represent words that Mr. Tennant was unable to decipher, though subsequent
  editors have made attempts to do so.</p>

  <p>A complete collection of Napoleon's letters to his first wife, translated
  into English, is given in: <i>Napoleon's Letters to Josephine 1796-1831</i>,
  Edited by H. F. Hall, London, 1901.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II</p>

  <p>PORT MAURICE, the 14th Germinal. [March]*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* March 14, 1796.]</p>

  <p>I have received all your letters; but not one of them has affected me so
  much as your last&mdash;do you think, my adorable love, of writing to me in
  such terms? Do you imagine, then, that my situation is not already cruel
  enough without an increase of my sorrows and an overthrow of my soul? What a
  style! What sentiments do you describe&mdash;they are of fire&mdash;they burn
  my poor heart. My only Josephine;&mdash;far from thee there is no
  joy&mdash;far from thee the world is a desert, where I remain an isolated
  being, without enjoying the sweets of confidence. You have deprived me of
  more than my soul;&mdash;you are the only thought of my life. If I am tired
  of the troubles of business, if I dread the result, if mankind disgust me, if
  I am ready to curse this life, I place my hand upon my heart,&mdash;there thy
  portrait beats.&mdash;I look at it, and love becomes to me absolute
  happiness; all is smiling save the time when I am separated from my
  beloved.</p>

  <p>By what art is it that you have been able to captivate all my faculties,
  and to concentrate in yourself my moral existence? It is a magic, my sweet
  love, which will finish only with my life. To live for Josephine&mdash;there
  is the history of my life. I am trying to reach you,&mdash;I am dying to be
  near you. Fool that I am, I do not perceive that I increase the distance
  between us. What lands, what countries separate us! What a time before you
  read these weak expressions of a troubled soul in which you reign? Ah! my
  adorable wife, I know not what fate awaits me, but if it keep me much longer
  from you it will be insupportable,&mdash;my courage will not go so far. There
  was a time when I was proud of my courage, and sometimes when contemplating
  all the ills that man could do me, or the fate which destiny could reserve
  for me, I fixed my eyes steadfastly on the most unheard-of misfortunes
  without a frown, without alarm;&mdash;but now the idea that my Josephine may
  be unwell, the idea that she may be ill, and above all the cruel, the fatal
  thought that she may love me less, withers my soul, stops my blood, renders
  me sad, cast down, and leaves me not even the courage of fury and despair.
  Formerly I used often to say to myself, men could not hurt him who could die
  without regret; but, now, to die without being loved by thee, to die without
  that certainty is the torment of hell; it is the lively and striking image of
  absolute annihilation&mdash;I feel as if I were stifled. My incomparable
  companion, thou whom fate has destined to make along with me the painful
  journey of life, the day on which I shall cease to possess thy heart will be
  the day on which parched nature will be to me without warmth or
  vegetation.</p>

  <p>I stop, my sweet love, my soul is sad; my body is fatigued; my head is
  giddy; men disgust me; I ought to hate them,&mdash;they separate me from my
  beloved.</p>

  <p>I am at Port Maurice near Oneille; to-morrow I shall be at Albenga; the
  two armies are in motion&mdash;We are endeavouring to deceive each
  other&mdash;Victory to the most skilful! I am pretty well satisfied with
  Beaulieu&mdash;If he alarm me much he is better man than his predecessor. I
  shall beat him I hope in good style. Do not be uneasy&mdash;love me as your
  eyes&mdash;but that is not enough&mdash;as yourself, more than yourself, than
  your thought, your mind, your sight, your all. Sweet love, forgive
  me,&mdash;I am sinking; nature is weak for him who feels strongly, for him
  whom you love!</p>

  <p>Sincere regards to Barras, Sussi, Madame Tallien&mdash;Compliments to

  <p>It is one hour after midnight&mdash;they have brought me a letter&mdash;it
  is sad&mdash;my soul is affected by it&mdash;it is the death of Chauvet. He
  was Commissaire Ordinateur-in-chief of the army&mdash;you have seen him
  sometimes at Barras'. My love, I feel the want of consolation&mdash;that is
  to be obtained by writing to you, to you alone, the thought of whom can so
  much influence the moral state of my thoughts, on whom I must pour out my
  troubles. What is the future? What is the past? What are we? What magic fluid
  is it that surrounds us, and hides from us those things which it concerns us
  most to know? We are born, we live, we die, in the midst of the wonderful! Is
  it astonishing that priests, astrologers, charlatans, should have profited by
  this inclination, by this singular circumstance, to lead our ideas, and to
  direct them according to their passions? Chauvet is dead! He was attached to
  me. He has rendered essential services to his country. His last words were
  that he was setting off to join me.&mdash;But yes, I see his shade&mdash;it
  wanders around me everywhere&mdash;it whistles in the air&mdash;his soul is
  in the clouds&mdash;he will be propitious to my destiny! But insensible, I
  shed tears to friendship, and who shall tell me that I have not already to
  weep an irreparable loss? Soul of my existence, write to me by every courier,
  otherwise I cannot live. I am here very much occupied. Beaulieu moves his
  army. We are in sight. I am a little fatigued. I am every day on horseback.
  Adieu, adieu, adieu&mdash;I am going to sleep to thee. Sleep consoles
  me&mdash;it places me at thy side&mdash;I press thee in my arms.&mdash;But
  alas! on waking, I find myself three hundred leagues from thee. Say

  true, I am in the wrong. During the Spring the country is beautiful, and then

  enjoys, exists only by the remembrance of you, who reads your letters as one
  devours a favourite dish after six hours' hunting. I am not satisfied. Your
  last letter is cold as friendship. I do not there find that fire which
  brightens your looks, that fire which I have there oftentimes fancied that I
  saw. But what is my waywardness! I found that your former letters weighed too
  heavily on my mind. The revolution which they there produced destroyed my
  repose, and enslaved my senses. I desired colder letters, but they give me
  the chill of death. The fear of not being loved by Josephine, the idea of
  seeing her inconstant, of &mdash;&mdash;. But I am forging

  <p>My brother will give you this letter. I have the warmest regard for him. I
  hope he will obtain yours. He merits it. Nature has endowed him with a
  character gentle, equal and unchangeable, good. He is made up of good

  whirlwind, and from great affairs. I recommend him to you.</p>

  <p>I have received your letters of the 16th and 21st. You have been many days
  without writing to me. What have you been doing? Yes, my good good love, I am
  not jealous, but sometimes uneasy. Come quickly&mdash;I warn you that if you
  delay you will find me ill&mdash;fatigue and your absence are too much at
  once. Your letters are the delight of my days, and my happy days are not
  frequent. Junot carries to Paris 22 standards. You must return with him. Do
  you understand?&mdash;if that is not disagreeable to you. Should he not come,
  misfortune without remedy, grief without consolation, endless suffering if I
  should have the misfortune to see him come alone! My adorable love, he will

  him the rare and invaluable favour of kissing thy cheek; and I, I shall be

  <p>Head-Quarters&mdash;TORTONA&mdash;Noon, 27th Prairial, 4th year of the
  French Republic. [June]*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* June 15, 1796.]</p>

  <p>TO JOSEPHINE,</p>

  <p>My life is a perpetual nightmare. A fatal foreboding hinders me from
  breathing. I no longer live. I have lost more than life, more than happiness,
  more than repose. I am almost without hope. I send you a courier&mdash;He
  will remain only four hours at Paris, and will then bring me your answer.
  Write me ten pages; that alone will console me a little. You are
  ill;&mdash;you love me;&mdash;I have made you unhappy. You are with child,
  and I do not see you! This idea confounds me. I have committed so many faults
  towards you, that I know not how to expiate them. I accuse you of having
  remained in Paris, and you are there ill. Forgive me, my darling;&mdash;the
  love with which you have inspired me has taken away my reason;&mdash;I shall
  never recover it; one never cures of that complaint. My forebodings are so
  sad, that I would limit myself to seeing you, to pressing you for two hours
  to my heart, to dying together! Who takes care of you? I suppose you have
  sent for Hortense. I love that sweet child a thousand times more since I
  think that she can afford you some little consolation. As for me, there is no
  consolation, no repose, no hope, until I have received the courier that I
  send you, and until you explain to me by a long letter what your illness is,
  and to what extent it is serious. If it be dangerous, I warn you, I set off
  instantly for Paris. My arrival will be a match for your illness. I have
  always been fortunate. Never has my fortune resisted my will, and to-day I am
  struck where alone I was vulnerable. Josephine, how can you remain so long
  without writing to me? Your last laconic letter is of the 3rd of the month.
  It is also afflicting for me. I have it, however, always in my pocket. Your
  portrait and your letters are incessantly before my eyes. I am nothing
  without you. I can hardly imagine how I existed without knowing you. Ah!
  Josephine, if you had known my heart you would not have waited from the 29th
  to the 16th to set off. Is it possible that you should have listened to false
  friends, who wished, perhaps, to keep you far from me? I own to all the
  world,&mdash;I have an antipathy to everybody who is near you. I calculated
  your departure on the 5th, and your arrival at Milan on the 15th.</p>

  <p>Josephine, if you love me, if you believe that everything depends upon
  your preservation, take care of yourself. I dare not tell you not to
  undertake so long a journey and in the hot weather;&mdash;at least, if you
  are in a situation to travel, go short days' journeys. Write to me at every
  sleeping-place, and send me your letters in advance.</p>

  <p>All my thoughts are concentrated in thy alcove, in thy bed, on thy
  heart&mdash;Thy illness! that is what occupies me night and day&mdash;without
  appetite, without sleep, without interest for friendship, for glory, for
  country, thou, thou and the rest of the world exist no more for me than if it
  were annihilated. I prize honour, because you prize it; victory, because it
  gives you pleasure, without which I should have quitted all to throw myself
  at your feet.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I say to myself that I am alarmed without reason,&mdash;already
  is she recovered,&mdash;she is setting off,&mdash;she has set off,&mdash;she
  is already, perhaps at Lyons. Vain imagination! you are in your bed
  suffering; more beautiful, more interesting, more adorable. You are pale, and
  your eyes are more languishing&mdash;but when will you be well? If one of us
  must be ill, should it not be I? More robust and more courageous, I could
  have borne sickness more easily&mdash;Destiny is cruel. She strikes me
  through you.</p>

  <p>What sometimes consoles me is, that it is in the power of fate to make you
  ill, but that no power can oblige me to survive you.</p>

  <p>In your letter, my good love, take care to tell me that you are convinced
  that I love you, that I love you beyond what it is possible to imagine, that
  you are persuaded that every moment of my life is consecrated to you; that an
  hour never passes without my thinking of you; that the idea of thinking of
  any other woman has never entered my head; that they are all to my eyes
  without grace, without beauty, without wit; that you, you, nothing but you,
  such as I see you, such as you are, could please me and absorb all the
  faculties of my mind; that you have affected it all over; that my heart has
  no recess that you do not see; no thoughts of which you are not the mistress;
  that my strength, my arms, my soul are altogether yours; that my soul is in
  your body, and that the day on which you change or cease to live, will be
  that of my death; that nature, the earth, is beautiful to my eyes only
  because you inhabit it.&mdash;If you do not believe all that, if your mind is
  not convinced of it, penetrated, you grieve me, you love me not. There is a
  magnetic fluid between the persons who love each other. You know very well
  that I could never bear to let you have a lover, much less to offer you one.
  To tear his heart and to see him would be to me the same thing; and then, if
  I should dare to lay my hand upon your hallowed person&mdash;no, I should
  never dare to do it, but I would quit a life where that which is most
  virtuous should have deceived me.</p>

  <p>But I am sure and proud of thy love. Misfortunes are the trials which
  expose all the violence of our mutual passion. A child, adorable as its
  mamma, is about to see day, and may pass many happy years in thy arms.
  Unhappy! I would be contented with a day. A thousand kisses upon thy eyes,
  upon thy lips, upon thy heart&mdash;Adorable woman! what is thy ascendancy! I
  am very ill of thy illness. I have, besides, a burning fever. Do not keep Le
  Simple...more than six hours. Let him return directly to bring the cherished
  letter of my Queen.</p>

  <p>Do you remember the dream in which I was your shoes, your clothes, and I
  fancied that you entered quite into my heart? Why did not nature arrange in
  that way? There are many things to do.</p>

  <p>For a month past I have received from my good love only two notes of three
  lines each&mdash;Is she so busy? She does not then find it necessary to write
  to her good friend, much less to think of him.&mdash;To live without thinking
  of Josephine! that would be to your husband to be dead, not to exist. Your
  image adorns my thoughts, and enlivens the black and sombre picture of
  melancholy and grief.&mdash;A day, perhaps, will come when I shall see you,
  for I doubt not that you are still at Paris&mdash;well, on that day I will
  show you my pockets full of letters which I have not sent to you, because
  they were too stupid; aye, that's the word. Good heavens! tell me, you who
  know so well how to make others love without loving in return, do you know
  how to cure me of love???&mdash;I will pay for this remedy dear enough.</p>

  <p>You should have set out on the 5th Prairial,&mdash;Good man that I was, I
  waited till the 13th, as if a pretty woman could give up her habits, her
  friends, and Madame Tallien, and a dinner at Barras', and a representation of
  a new piece, and Fontane, yes, Fontane! You love everything better than your
  husband&mdash;you have for him only a little esteem, and a portion of that
  kindness with which your heart abounds. Every day I recapitulate your
  unkindness, your faults. I flog myself that I may love you no
  longer&mdash;bah, do I not love you still more? In short, my incomparable
  little mamma, I am going to tell you my secret. Laugh at me: remain at Paris;
  have lovers; let all the world know it; never write to me.&mdash;Ah, well! I
  shall love you for it ten times more.&mdash;Is that this folly, fever,
  madness!! and I shall never cure of it.&mdash;Oh yes! by heaven I shall cure
  of it; but don't take it into your head to tell me that you are ill; don't
  attempt to justify yourself. Good heaven! you are forgiven&mdash;I love you
  to folly, and never will my poor heart cease to give all to love;&mdash;if
  you loved me not, my fate would be wretched indeed. You have not written to
  me;&mdash;you were ill;&mdash;you are not arrived...would not let
  you&mdash;and then your illness, and then the little child which was so much
  on the move that it made you ill. But you have passed Lyons,&mdash;you will
  be at Turin on the l0th, on the 12th at Milan, where you will wait for
  me&mdash;You will be in Italy, and I shall still be far from you&mdash;Adieu,
  my well beloved&mdash;a kiss upon thy mouth, another upon thy heart, and
  another upon thy little infant.</p>

  <p>We have made peace with Rome, who gives us money&mdash;We shall be

  <p>Robert Burns was born at Alloway to a humble cottar, a man of remarkable
  and sterling character, who educated his son himself. Robert began life as a
  farm labourer, and as a writer of verses in the old Scotch ballad tradition;
  after trying his hand at surveying and farming and leading a life far too
  convivial for the taste of his friends, Burns obtained a position as overseer
  on a Jamaica plantation 1786. In order to raise the money for the passage to
  the West Indies for himself and his proposed bride, Mary Campbell, Burns had
  his poems printed. Mary died and Burns went to Edinburgh to enjoy the success
  made by his poetry. As he was handsome, attractive, full of zest and
  vitality, he was much sought after by both the intellectuals and the good
  fellows of the capital, and became acceptable in both the drawing-rooms and
  the Masonic and drinking-clubs. He continued his success with his verses and
  songs; in 1787 he travelled extensively in his own country and on returning
  to Edinburgh began his romantic exchange of letters with Margaret Chalmers
  and Agnes M'Lehose, "Peggy" and "Clarinda," though deeply engaged at the time
  to Jean Armour, whom he married in 1788. He returned to farming until 1791
  when he took the job of exciseman at £70 per annum. His hard drinking habits
  increased, and in 1796 he contracted rheumatic fever as the result of
  exposure after a carouse and died miserably oppressed by poverty and
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>Agnes M'Lehose was born in Glasgow, her maiden name was Craig, her family
  was well connected, of her education we are told that "her education was much
  neglected" and consisted largely in learning "that laborious idleness called
  sampler work." She lost her mother when she was fifteen years of age and was
  brought up by her father, who married her to Mr. James M'Lehose, a "young man
  of respectable connexions", whom she accepted in 1776. The youthful couple
  soon passionately disagreed and were separated by 1780, after the birth of
  four children. Mrs. M'Lehose, then only twenty-one years of age, returned to
  her father's house, her children were "distributed among her husband's
  relations," while Mr. M'Lehose himself indulged "in every species of
  dissipation." By 1782 the death of her father had rendered the romantic Agnes
  independent and she removed from Glasgow to Edinburgh. Her husband soon went
  to Jamaica, where he made himself 'comfortable with a black mistress,' and
  the deserted wife supported the three surviving children with the generous
  help of a kinsman, Lord Craig. The lovely and interesting Agnes soon joined
  "a social circle in Edinburgh of which she became an ornament," and "at this
  period she began cultivating the muses." 'Address to a Blackbird' was her
  first and most admired effort. Mrs. M'Lehose presided over a <i>salon</i>
  where the intellectuals of the day gathered; towards the end of 1787 Robert
  Burns met Mrs. M'Lehose at the house of a common friend, Miss Nimmo. Soon
  after he met with an accident that prevented his proposed departure from
  Edinburgh and confined him to the house; the 'Clarinda' and 'Sylvander'
  correspondence then began. When he recovered a flirtation more or less
  discreet ensued, after several months of this Burns, tired, one may suppose,
  of the fine drawn nonsense, where a man of genius and a silly woman met on
  equal terms, left Edinburgh and married Jean Armour, who had for some time
  been his mistress. Clarinda met her swain once again in 1791, and was his
  'occasional correspondent' until shortly before his death.</p>

  <p>Clarinda's subsequent history was not romantic; after trying in vain to
  obtain money from her husband, she decided to join him in Jamaica; she sailed
  from Leith in 1792, and "suffered much from the voyage." Her husband's
  reception of her was so cold that she fell into a "complication of nervous
  disorders" from which there was fear for her reason or her life. One of the
  causes of her agitation was the sight of her husband's coloured family. "A
  source of mortification and annoyance." After three months in Jamaica Agnes
  returned to Scotland; she had now lost two other children and devoted herself
  to her surviving son, Andrew. The erring husband died in 1812. Agnes survived
  him twenty-nine years, outliving her son and his family. Her old age was
  serene; shortly before her death "she quoted the tenth verse of the
  nineteenth Psalm with great accuracy and emphasis."</p>

  <p>Agnes M'Lehose was a pretty woman; this was the reason of Robert Burns's
  interest in her; she was short, fair, delicate with a soft pleasing voice;
  her contemporaries credited her with too much sensitiveness and too great a
  vivacity. She seems to have borne some likeness to Eliza Draper. On December
  6, 1831, she noted in her diary, "This day I can never forget. Parted with
  Burns in the year 1791, never more to meet in this world&mdash;Oh! may we
  meet in Heaven! "</p>

  <p>The following letters are selected from the complete correspondence
  arranged and edited by her grandson, W. C. M'Lehose: <i>The Correspondence
  between Burns and Clarinda</i>, Edinburgh, 1843.</p>

  <p>The letters were, in this edition, printed for the first time from the
  originals, that were somewhat damaged from being handed round among the
  curious and somewhat mutilated by autograph hunters. We are not told if
  Clarinda kept copies of her effusions or if Burns returned her the originals.
  The numbers of the letters in this collection have been retained in brackets.
  The above note on the life of Clarinda is abridged from the memoir of her
  grandson.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER I [7]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Sylvander to Clarinda</p>

  <p>(December 21st.)</p>

  <p>I beg your pardon, my dear "Clarinda," for the fragment scrawl I sent you
  yesterday. I really don't know what I wrote. A gentleman for whose character,
  abilities, and critical knowledge, I have the highest veneration, called in
  just as I had begun the second sentence, and I would not make the porter
  wait. I read to my much-respected friend several of my own bagatelles, and,
  among others, your lines, which I had copied out. He began some criticisms on
  them, as on the other pieces, when I informed him they were the work of a
  young lady in this town; which I assure you, made him stare. My learned
  friend seriously protested, that he did not believe any young woman in
  Edinburgh was capable of such lines; and if you know anything of Professor
  Gregory, you will neither doubt of his abilities nor his sincerity. I do love
  you, if possible, still better for having so fine a taste and turn for poesy.
  I have again gone wrong in my usual unguarded way; but you may erase the
  word, and put esteem, respect, or any other tame Dutch expression you please
  in its place. I believe there is no holding converse, or carrying on
  correspondence with an amiable woman, much less a gloriously-amiable fine
  woman, without some mixture of that delicious passion, whose most devoted
  slave I have more than once had the honour of being. But why be hurt or
  offended on that account? Can no honest man have a prepossession for a fine
  woman, but he must run his head against an intrigue? Take a little of the
  tender witchcraft of love, and add it to the generous, the honourable
  sentiments of manly friendship, and I know but one more delightful morsel,
  which few, few in any rank ever taste. Such a composition is like adding a
  cream to strawberries; it not only gives the fruit a more elegant richness,
  but has a peculiar deliciousness of its own.</p>

  <p>I enclose you a few lines I composed on a late melancholy occasion. I will
  not give above five or six copies of it at all; and I would be hurt if any
  friend should give any copies without my consent.</p>

  <p>You cannot imagine, Clarinda (I like the idea of Arcadian names in a
  commerce of this kind), how much store I have set by the hopes of your future
  friendship. I don't know if you have a just idea of my character, but I wish
  you to see me as I am. I am, as most people of my trade are, a strange
  will-o'-wisp being; the victim, too frequently, of much imprudence, and many
  follies. My great constituent elements are pride and passion; the first I
  have endeavoured to humanise into integrity and honour; the last makes me a
  devotee, to the warmest degree of enthusiasm, in love, religion, or
  friendship; either of them, or altogether, as I happen to be inspired. 'Tis
  true I never saw you but once; but how much acquaintance did I form with you
  at that once? Do not think I flatter you, or have a design upon you,
  Clarinda; I have too much pride for the one, and too little cold contrivance
  for the other; but of all God's creatures I ever could approach in the beaten
  way of acquaintance, you struck me with the deepest, the strongest, the most
  permanent impression. I say the most permanent, because I know myself well,
  and how far I can promise either on my prepossessions or powers. Why are you
  unhappy?&mdash;and why are so many of our fellow-creatures, unworthy to
  belong to the same species with you, blest with all they can wish? You have a
  hand all-benevolent to give,&mdash;why were you denied the pleasure? You have
  a heart formed, gloriously formed, for all the most refined luxuries of
  love,&mdash;why was that heart ever wrung? O Clarinda! shall we not meet in a
  state, some yet unknown state of being, where the lavish hand of Plenty shall
  minister to the highest wish of Benevolence, and where the chill north-wind
  of Prudence shall never blow over the flowery fields of enjoyment? If we do
  not, man was made in vain! I deserved most of the unhappy hours that have
  lingered over my head: they were the wages of my labour. But what unprovoked
  demon, malignant as hell, stole upon the confidence of un-mistrusting, busy
  fate, and dashed your cup of life with undeserved sorrow?</p>

  <p>Let me know how long your stay will be out of town: I shall count the
  hours till you inform me of your return. Cursed etiquette forbids your seeing
  me just now; and so soon as I can walk I must bid Edinburgh adieu. Lord, why
  was I born to see misery which I cannot relieve, and to meet with friends
  whom I can't enjoy! I look back with the pangs of unavailing avarice on my
  loss in not knowing you sooner. All last winter,&mdash;these three months
  past,&mdash;what luxury of intercourse have I not lost! Perhaps, though,
  'twas better for my peace. You see I am either above, or incapable of
  dissimulation. I believe it is want of that particular genius. I despise
  design, because I want either coolness or wisdom to be capable of it. I am
  interrupted. Adieu, my dear Clarinda!</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER II [8]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Clarinda to Sylvander</p>

  <p>Friday Evening (December 21).</p>

  <p>I go to the country early to-morrow morning, but will be home by
  Tuesday&mdash;sooner than I expected. I have not time to answer yours as it
  deserves; nor, had I the age of Methusalem, could I answer it in kind. I
  shall grow vain. Your praises were enough&mdash;but those of a Dr. Gregory
  superadded! Take care: many a "glorious" woman has been undone by having her
  head turned. "Know you"!" I know you far better than you do me. Like
  yourself, I am a bit of an enthusiast. In religion and friendship quite a
  bigot&mdash;perhaps I could be so in love too; but everything dear to me in
  heaven and earth forbids! This is my fixed principle; and the person who
  would dare to endeavour to remove it I would hold as my chief enemy. Like
  you, I am incapable of dissimulation; nor am I, as you suppose, unhappy. I
  have been unfortunate; but guilt alone could make me unhappy. Possessed of
  fine children&mdash;competence,&mdash;fame,&mdash;friends, kind and
  attentive,&mdash;what a monster of ingratitude should I be in the eye of
  Heaven were I to style myself unhappy! True, I have met with scenes horrible
  to recollection&mdash;even at six years' distance; but adversity, my friend,
  is allowed to be the school of virtue. It oft confers that chastened softness
  which is unknown among the favourites of Fortune! Even a mind possessed of
  natural sensibility, without this, never feels that exquisite pleasure which
  nature has annexed to our sympathetic sorrows. Religion, the only refuge of
  the unfortunate, has been my balm in every woe. O! could I make her appear to
  you as she has done to me! Instead of ridiculing her tenets, you would fall
  down and worship her very semblance wherever you found it!</p>

  <p>I will write you again at more leisure, and notice other parts of yours. I
  send you a simile upon a character I don't know if you are acquainted with. I
  am confounded at your admiring my lines. I shall begin to question your
  taste, but Dr. G.! When I am low-spirited (which I am at times) I shall think
  of this as a restorative. Now for the simile:</p>

  <p class="poem">The morning sun shines glorious and bright,<br>
  And fills the heart with wonder and delight!<br>
  He dazzles in meridian splendour seen,<br>
  Without a blackening cloud to intervene.<br>
  So, at a distance viewed, your genius bright,<br>
  Your wit, your flowing numbers give delight.<br>
  But ah! when error's dark'ning clouds rise,<br>
  When passion's thunder, folly's lightning flies,<br>
  More safe we gaze, but admiration dies.<br>
  And as the tempting brightness snares the moth,<br>
  Sure ruin marks too near approach to both.</p>

  <p>Good night; for Clarinda's "heavenly eyes" need the earthly aid of
  sleep.</p>

  <p>CLARINDA.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I entreat you not to mention our corresponding to one on earth.
  Though I've conscious innocence, my situation is a delicate one.</p>

  <p class="cpi">You talk of weeping, Clarinda: some involuntary drops wet your
  lines as I read them. Offend me, my dearest angel! You cannot offend
  me,&mdash;you never offended me. If you had ever given me the least shadow of

  it had blotted my paper. Though I find your letter has agitated me into a
  violent headache, I shall take a chair and be with you about eight. A friend

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IV [21]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Clarinda to Sylvander</p>

  <p>Sunday Evening</p>

  <p>(January 13).</p>

  <p>I will not deny it, Sylvander, last night was one of the most exquisite I
  ever experienced. Few such fall to the lot of mortals! Few, extremely few,
  are formed to relish such refined enjoyment. That it should be so, vindicates
  the wisdom of Heaven. But, though our enjoyment did not lead beyond the
  limits of virtue, yet to-day's reflections have not been altogether unmixed
  with regret. The idea of the pain it would have given, were it known to a
  friend to whom I am bound by the sacred ties of gratitude (no more), the
  opinion Sylvander may have formed from my unreservedness; and, above all,
  some secret misgivings that Heaven may not approve, situated as I
  am&mdash;these procured me a sleepless night; and, though at church, I am not
  at all well.</p>

  <p>Sylvander, you saw Clarinda last night, behind the scenes! Now, you'll be
  convinced she has faults. If she knows herself, her intention is always good;
  but she is too often the victim of sensibility, and, hence, is seldom pleased
  with herself.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER V [31]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Clarinda to Sylvander</p>

  <p>Sunday, Eight Evening (27th).</p>

  <p>Sylvander, when I think of you as my dearest and most attached friend, I
  am highly pleased: but when you come across my mind as my lover, something
  within gives a sting resembling that of guilt. Tell me why is this? It must
  be from the idea that I am another's. What! another's wife. Oh cruel Fate! I
  am, indeed, bound in an iron chain. Forgive me, if this should give you pain.
  You know I must (I told you I must) tell you my genuine feelings, or be
  silent. Last night we were happy beyond what the bulk of mankind can
  conceive. Perhaps the "line" you had marked was a little infringed,&mdash;it
  was really; but, though I disapprove, I have not been unhappy about it. I am
  convinced no less of your discernment, than of your wish to make your
  Clarinda happy. 'I know you sincere, when you profess horror at the idea of
  what would render her miserable for ever. Yet we must guard against going to
  the verge of danger. Ah! my friend, much need had we to "watch, and pray!"
  May those benevolent spirits, whose office it is to save the fall of Virtue
  struggling on the brink of Vice, be ever present to protect and guide us in
  right paths!</p>

  <p>I had an hour's conversation to-day with my worthy friend Mr. Kemp.*
  You'll attribute, perhaps, to this, the above sentiments. 'Tis true, there's
  not one on earth has so much influence on me, except&mdash;Sylvander; partly
  it has forced me "to feel along the Mental Intelligence." However, I've broke
  the ice. I confessed I had conceived a tender impression of late&mdash;that
  it was mutual, and that I had wished to unbosom myself to him (as I always
  did), particularly to ask if he thought I should, or not, mention it to my
  friend? I saw he felt for me (for I was in tears), but he bewailed that I had
  given my heart while in my present state of bondage; wished I had made it
  friendship only; in short, talked to me in the style of a tender parent,
  anxious for my happiness. He disapproves altogether of my saying a syllable
  of the matter to my friend,&mdash;says it could only make him uneasy; and
  that I am in no way bound to do it by any one tie. This has eased me of a
  load which has lain upon my mind ever since our intimacy. Sylvander, I wish
  you and Mr. Kemp were acquainted,&mdash;such worth and sensibility! If you
  had his piety and sobriety of manners, united to the shining abilities you
  possess, you'd be "a faultless monster which the world ne'er saw." He, too,
  has great talents. His imagination is rich&mdash;his feelings
  delicate&mdash;his discernment acute; yet there are shades in his, as in all
  characters: but these it would ill become Clarinda to point out. Alas! I know
  too many blots in my own.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The Reverend John Kemp, minister of the Tolbooth
  Church, Edinburgh, a man of acknowledged acquirements and ability, and of
  high standing in society. He twice intermarried with the nobility.]</p>

  <p>Sylvander, I believe nothing were a more impracticable task than to make
  you feel a little of genuine gospel humility. Believe me, I wish not to see
  you deprived of that noble fire of an exalted mind which you eminently
  possess. Yet a sense of your faults&mdash;a feeling sense of them!&mdash;were
  devoutly to be wished. Tell me, did you ever, or how oft have you smote on
  your breast, and cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner"? I fancy, once or
  twice, when suffering from the effects of your errors. Pardon me if I be
  hurting your "intrinsic dignity"; it need not&mdash;even "divine Clarinda"
  has been in this mortal predicament.</p>

  <p>Pray, what does Mr. Ainslie think of her? Was he not astonished to find
  her merely human? Three weeks ago, I suppose you would have made him walk
  into her presence unshod: but one must bury even divinities when they
  discover symptoms of mortality!&mdash;(Let these be interred in Sylvander's
  bosom.)</p>

  <p>My dearest friend, there are two wishes uppermost in my heart; to see you
  think alike with Clarinda on religion, and settled in some creditable line of
  business. The warm interest I take in both these, is, perhaps, the best proof
  of the sincerity of my friendship&mdash;as well as earnest of its duration.
  As to the first, I devolve it over into the hands of the Omniscient! May he
  raise up friends who will effectuate the other! While I breathe these fervent
  wishes, think not anything but pure disinterested regard prompts them. They
  are fond but chimerical ideas. They are never indulged but in the hour of
  tender endearment, when</p>

  <p class="poem">...Innocence<br>
  Looked gaily smiling on, while rosy Pleasure<br>
  Hid young Desire amid her flowery wreath,<br>
  And poured her cup luxuriant, mantling high<br>
  The sparkling, Heavenly vintage&mdash;Love and Bliss.</p>

  <p>'Tis past ten&mdash;and I please myself with thinking Sylvander will be
  about to retire, and write to Clarinda. I fancy you'll find this stupid
  enough; but I can't be always bright&mdash;the sun will be sometimes under a
  cloud. Sylvan-der, I wish our kind feelings were more moderate; why set one's
  heart upon impossibilities? Try me merely as your friend (alas, all I ought
  to be). Believe me, you'll find me most rational. If you'd caress the "mental
  intelligence" as you do the corporeal frame, indeed, Sylvander you'd make me
  a philosopher. I see you fidgeting at this violently, blasting rationality. I
  have a headache which brings home these things to the mind. To-morrow I'll
  hear from you, I hope. This is Sunday, and not a word on our favourite
  subject. O fy, "divine Clarinda." I intend giving you my idea of Heaven in
  opposition to your heathenish description (which, by the by, was elegantly
  drawn). Mine shall be founded on Reason and supported by Scripture; but it's
  too late, my head aches, but my heart is affectionately yours.</p>

  <p><i>Monday Morning.</i></p>

  <p>I am almost not sorry at the Excise affair misgiving. You will be better
  out of Edinburgh&mdash;it is full of temptation to one of your social
  turn.</p>

  <p>Providence (if you be wise in future) will order something better for you.
  I am half glad you were schooled about the Inscription; 'twill be a lesson, I
  hope in future. Clarinda would have lectured you on it before, "if she
  dared." Miss Nimmo is a woman after my own heart. You are reconciled to the
  world by her "friendly prattle"? How can you talk so diminutively of the
  conversation of a woman of solid sense? what will you say of Clarinda's
  chit-chat? I suppose you would give it a still more insignificant term if you
  dared; but it is mixed with something that makes it bearable, were it even
  weaker than it is. Miss Nimmo is right in both her conjectures. Ah,
  Sylvander! my peace must suffer&mdash;yours cannot. You think, in loving
  Clarinda, you are doing right; all Sylvander's eloquence cannot convince me
  that it is so? If I were but at liberty&mdash;Oh how I could indulge in all
  the luxury of innocent love! It is, I fear, too late to talk in this strain,
  after indulging you and myself so much; but would Sylvander shelter his Love
  in Friendship's allowed garb, Clarinda would be far happier.</p>

  <p>To-morrow, didst thou say? The time is short now&mdash;is it not too
  frequent? do not sweetest dainties cloy soonest? Take your chance&mdash;come
  half-past eight. If anything particular occur to render it improper
  to-morrow, I'll send you word, and name another evening. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
  is to call to-night, I believe. He, too, trembles for my peace. Two such
  worthies to be interested about my foolish ladyship 1 The Apostle Paul, with
  all his rhetoric, could not reconcile me to the great (little souls) when I
  think of them and Sylvander together; but I pity them.</p>

  <p class="cpi">Sylvander to Clarinda</p>

  <p class="cpi">Thursday Morning (Jan. 24).</p>

  <p>"Unlavish Wisdom never works in vain."</p>

  <p>I have been tasking my reason, Clarinda, why a woman, who, for native
  genius, poignant wit, strength of mind, generous sincerity of soul, and the
  sweetest female tenderness, is without a peer; and whose personal charms have
  few, very few parallels among her sex; why, or how, she should fall to the
  blessed lot of a poor harum-scarum poet, whom Fortune had kept for her
  particular use to wreak her temper on, whenever she was in ill-humour.</p>

  <p>One time I conjectured that, as Fortune is the most capricious jade ever
  known, she may have taken, not a fit of remorse, but a paroxysm of whim, to
  rase the poor devil out of the mire where he had so often, and so
  conveniently, served her as a stepping stone, and given him the most glorious
  boon she ever had in her gift, merely for the maggot's sake, to see how his
  fool head and his fool heart will bear it.</p>

  <p>At other times, I was vain enough to think that Nature, who has a great
  deal to say with Fortune, had given the coquettish goddess some such hint
  as&mdash;"Here is a paragon of female excellence, whose equal, in all my
  former compositions, I was never lucky enough to hit on, and despair of ever
  doing so again; you have cast her rather in the shades of life. There is a
  certain poet of my making; among your frolics, it would not be amiss to
  attach him to this masterpiece of my hand, to give her that immortality among
  mankind, which no woman of any age ever more deserved, and which few
  rhymesters of this age are better able to confer."</p>

  after a bowl which has been constantly plied since dinner till this moment. I

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VII [27]</p>

  <p>Thursday Forenoon (January 24th).</p>

  <p>Sylvander, the moment I waked this morning, I received a summons from
  Conscience to appear at the Bar of Reason. While I trembled before this
  sacred throne, I beheld a succession of figures pass before me in awful
  brightness! Religion, clad in a robe of light, stalked majestically along,
  her hair dishevelled, and in her hand the Scriptures of Truth, held open at
  these words&mdash;"If you love me, keep my commandments." Reputation
  followed: her eyes darted indignation, while she waved a beautiful wreath of
  laurel, intermixed with flowers, gathered by Modesty in the Bower of Peace.
  Consideration held her bright mirror close to my eyes, and made me start at
  my own image! Love alone appeared as counsel in my behalf. She was adorned
  with a veil, borrowed from Friendship, which hid her defects, and set off her
  beauties to advantage. She had no plea to offer, but that of being the sister
  of Friendship, and the offspring of Charity. But Reason refused to listen to
  her defence, because she brought no certificate from the Temple of Hymen!
  While I trembled before her, Reason addressed me in the following manner:
  "Return to my paths, which alone are peace; shut your heart against the
  fascinating intrusion of the passions; take Consideration for your guide, and
  you will soon arrive at the Bower of Tranquillity."</p>

  <p>Sylvander, to drop my metaphor, I am neither well nor happy to-day; my
  heart reproaches me for last night. If you wish Clarinda to regain her peace,
  determine against everything but what the strictest delicacy warrants.</p>

  <p>I do not blame you, but myself. I must not see you on Saturday, unless I
  find I can depend on myself acting otherwise. Delicacy, you know, it was
  which won me to you at once: take care you do not loosen the dearest, most
  sacred tie that unites us? Remember Clarinda's present and eternal happiness
  depends upon her adherence to Virtue. Happy Sylvander! that can be attached
  to Heaven and Clarinda together. Alas! I feel I cannot serve two masters. God
  pity me!!</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VIII [28]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Sylvander to Clarinda</p>

  <p>(January 25.)</p>

  <p>Clarinda, my life, you have wounded my soul. Can I think of your being
  unhappy, even though it be not described in your pathetic elegance of
  language, without being miserable? Clarinda, can I bear to be told from you
  that "you will not see me to-morrow night&mdash;that you wish the hour of
  parting were come"? Do not let us impose on ourselves by sounds. If, in the
  moment of fond endearment and tender dalliance, I perhaps trespassed against
  the letter of Decorum's law, I appeal, even to you, whether I ever sinned, in
  the very least degree, against the spirit of her strictest statute? But why,
  my love, talk to me in such strong terms; every word of which cuts me to the
  very soul? You know a hint, the slightest signification of your wish, is to
  me a sacred command.</p>

  <p>Be reconciled, my angel, to your God, yourself, and me; and I pledge you
  Sylvander's honour&mdash;an oath, I daresay, you will trust without reserve,
  that you shall never more have reason to complain of his conduct. Now, my
  love, do not wound our next meeting with any averted looks or restrained
  caresses. I have marked the line of conduct&mdash;a line, I know, exactly to
  your taste&mdash;and which I will inviolably keep: but do not you show the
  least inclination to make boundaries. Seeming distrust, where you know you
  may confide, is a cruel sin against sensibility.</p>

  <p>"Delicacy, you know, it was which won me to you at once; take care you do
  not loosen the dearest, most sacred tie that unites us." Clarinda, I would
  not have stung your soul&mdash;I would not have bruised your spirit as that
  harsh crucifying "Take care" did mine; no, not to have gained heaven! Let me
  again appeal to your dear self, if Sylvander, even when he seemingly half
  transgressed the laws of decorum, if he did not show more chastised,
  trembling, faltering delicacy, than the many of the world do in keeping these
  laws!</p>

  <p>Oh Love and Sensibility, ye have conspired against my Peace t I love to
  madness, and I feel to torture! Clarinda, how can I forgive myself, that I
  have ever touched a single chord in your bosom with pain! would I do it
  willingly? Would any consideration, any gratification, make me do so? Oh, did
  you love, like me, you would not, you could not, deny or put off a meeting
  with the man who adores you;&mdash;who would die a thousand deaths before he
  would injure you; and who must soon bid you a long farewell!</p>

  <p>I had proposed bringing my bosom friend, Mr. Ainslie, to-morrow evening,
  at his strong request, to see you; as he has only time to stay with us about
  ten minutes, for an engagement. But I shall hear from you; this afternoon,
  for mercy's sake!&mdash;for, till I hear from you, I am wretched. O Clarinda,
  the tie that binds me to thee is intwisted, incorporated with my dearest
  threads of life!</p>

  <p>SYLVANDER.</p>

  <p>MY EVER DEAREST CLARINDA,&mdash;I make a numerous dinner-party wait me
  while I read yours* and write this. Do not require that I should cease to
  love you, to adore you in my soul; 'tis to me impossible: your peace and
  happiness are to me dearer than my soul. Name the terms on which you wish to
  see me, to correspond with me, and you have them. I must love, pine, mourn,
  and adore in secret; this you must not deny me. You will ever be to
  me&mdash;</p>

  <p>I have not patience to read the Puritanic scrawl. Damned sophistry. Ye

  truth, delicacy, and honour; but the half-inch soul of an unfeeling,
  cold-blooded, pitiful Presbyterian bigot cannot forgive anything above his
  dungeon-bosom and foggy head.</p>

  <p>Farewell! I'll be with you to-morrow evening; and be at rest in your mind.
  I will be yours in the way you think most to your happiness. I dare not

  <p>or, as the same author finely says in another place,</p>

  <p class="quote">Let thy soul spring up,<br>

  <p>I am yours, Clarinda, for life. Never be discouraged at all this. Look
  forward: in a few weeks I shall be somewhere or other, out of the possibility
  of seeing you: till then, I shall write you often, but visit you seldom. Your
  fame, your welfare, your happiness, are dearer to me than any gratification
  whatever. Be comforted, my love! the present moment is the worst; the lenient
  hand of time is daily and hourly either lightening the burden, or making us
  insensible to the weight. None of these friends&mdash;I mean Mr.

  anybody that has these be said to be unhappy? These are yours.</p>

  <p>To-morrow evening I shall be with you about eight, probably for the last

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XI [49]</p>

  <p class="cpi">Clarinda to Sylvander</p>

  <p>EDINBURGH, Friday Evening (22d Feb.)</p>

  <p>I wish you had given me a hint, my dear Sylvander, that you were to write
  me only once in a week. Yesterday I looked for a letter, to-day, never
  doubted it; but both days have terminated in disappointment. A thousand
  conjectures have conspired to make me most unhappy. Often have I suffered
  much disquiet from forming the idea of such an attention, on such and such an
  occasion, and experienced quite the reverse. But in you, and you alone, I
  have ever found my highest demands of kindness accomplished; nay even my
  fondest wishes, not gratified only, but anticipated! To what, then, can I
  attribute your not writing me one line since Monday?</p>

  <p>God forbid that your nervous ailment has incapacitated you for that
  office, from which you derived pleasure singly; as well as that most delicate
  of all enjoyments, pleasure reflected. To-morrow I shall hope to hear from
  you. Hope blessed hope, thou balm of every wo (<i>sic</i>), possess and fill
  my bosom with thy benign influence.</p>

  <p>I have been solitary since the tender farewell till to-night. I was
  solicited to go to Dr. Moyes's lecture with Miss Craig and a gallant of hers,
  a student; one of the many stupid animals, knowing only in the Science of
  Puppyism, "or the nice conduct of a clouded cane." With what sovereign
  contempt did I compare his trite, insipid frivolity with the intelligent,
  manly observation which ever marks the conversation of Sylvander. He is a
  glorious piece of divine workmanship, Dr. Moyes. The subject to-night was the
  origin of minerals, springs, lakes and the ocean. Many parts were far beyond
  my weak comprehension, and indeed that of most women. What I understood
  delighted me, and altogether raised my thoughts to the infinite wisdom and
  boundless goodness of the Deity. The man himself marks both. Presented with a
  universal blank of Nature's works* his mind appears to be illuminated with
  Celestial light. He concluded with some lines of the Essay on Man: "All are
  but parts of one stupendous whole," etc., a passage I have often read with
  sublime pleasure.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Dr. Moyes was blind.]</p>

  <p>Miss Burnet* sat just behind me. What an angelic girl! I stared at her,
  having never seen her so near. I remembered you talking of her, etc. What
  felicity to witness her "softly speak and sweetly smile!" How could you
  celebrate any other Clarinda! Oh, I would have adored you, as Pope of
  exquisite taste and refinement, had you loved, sighed, and written upon her
  forever! breathing your passion only to the woods and streams. But Poets, I
  find, are not quite incorporeal, more than others. My dear Sylvander, to be
  serious, I really wonder you ever admired Clarinda, after beholding Miss
  Burnet's superior charms. If I don't hear to-morrow, I shall form dreadful
  reasons. God forbid! Bishop Geddes was within a foot of me, too. What field
  for contemplation&mdash;both!</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This young lady died of consumption in 1790, at the

  <p class="cpi">Sylvander to Clarinda</p>

  <p>March 9th, 1789.</p>

  <p>MADAM,&mdash;The letter you wrote me to Heron's carried its own answer in
  its bosom; you forbade me to write you, unless I was willing to plead guilty
  to a certain indictment that you were pleased to bring against me. As I am
  convinced of my own innocence, and, though conscious of high imprudence and
  egregious folly, can lay my hand on my breast and attest the rectitude of my
  heart, you will pardon me, Madam, if I do not carry my complaisance so far,
  as humbly to acquiesce in the name of Villain, merely out of compliment to
  your opinion; much as I esteem your judgment, and warmly as I regard your
  worth.</p>

  <p>I have already told you, and I again aver it, that, at the period of time
  alluded to, I was not under the smallest moral tie to Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;;
  nor did I, nor could I then know, all the powerful circumstances that
  omnipotent necessity was busy laying in wait for me. When you call over the
  scenes that have passed between us, you will survey the conduct of an honest
  man, struggling successfully with temptations, the most powerful that ever
  beset humanity, and preserving untainted honour, in situations where the
  austerest virtue would have forgiven a fall; in situations that, I will dare
  to say, not a single individual of all his kind, even with half his
  sensibility and passion, could have encountered without ruin; and I leave you
  to guess, Madam, how such a man is likely to digest an accusation of
  perfidious treachery.</p>

  <p>Was I to blame, Madam, in being the distracted victim of charms which, I
  affirm it, no man ever approached with impunity? Had I seen the least
  glimmering of hope that these charms could ever have been mine; or even had
  not iron necessity&mdash;But these are unavailing words.</p>

  <p>I would have called on you when I was in town, indeed I could not have
  resisted it, but that Mr. Ainslie told me, that you were determined to avoid
  your windows while I was in town, lest even a glance of me should occur in
  the street.</p>

  <p>When I shall have regained your good opinion, perhaps I may venture to
  solicit your friendship: but, be that as it may, the first of her sex I ever
  knew shall always be the object of my warmest good wishes.</p>

  <p>Agitated, hurried to death, I sit down to write a few lines to you, my
  ever dear, dear friend! We are ordered abroad on Saturday,&mdash;to sail on
  Sunday. And now, my dearest Sir, I have a few things to say to you, as the
  last advice of her, who could have lived or died with you! I am happy to know
  of your applying so steadily to the business you have engaged in; but, oh
  remember, this life is a short, passing scene! Seek God's favour,&mdash;keep
  His Commandments,&mdash;be solicitous to prepare for a happy eternity! There,
  I trust, we will meet, in perfect, and never-ending bliss. Read my former
  letters attentively: let the religious tenets there expressed sink deep into
  your mind; meditate on them with candour, and your accurate judgment must be
  convinced that they accord with the words of Eternal Truth! Laugh no more at
  holy things, or holy men: remember, "without holiness, no man shall see God."
  Another thing, and I have done; as you value my peace, do not write me to
  Jamaica, until I let you know you may with safety. Write Mary often. She
  feels for you! and judges of your present feelings by her own. I am sure you
  will be happy to hear of my happiness: and I trust you will&mdash;soon. If
  there is time, you may drop me a line ere I go, to inform me if you get this,
  and another letter I wrote you, dated the 21st, which I am afraid of having
  been neglected to be put into the office.</p>

  <p>So it was the Roselle you were to have gone in! I read your letter to-day,
  and reflected deeply on the ways of Heaven! To us they oft appear dark and
  doubtful; but let us do our duty faithfully, and sooner or later we will have
  our reward, because "the Lord God Omnipotent reigns": every upright mind has
  here cause to rejoice. And now, adieu. May Almighty God bless you and yours!
  take you into His blessed favour here, and afterwards receive you into His
  glory!</p>

  <p style="margin-left:50%">&mdash;Verses by Alfred de Musset, dictated to
  George Sand,<br>
  January 10, 1835.</p>

  <h3>* * * * * * *</h3>

  <p>Amantine Aurore, Baronne Dudevant, was a descendant of Maurice de Saxe,
  maréchal de France, and was brought up in the château de Nohant, in Berri,
  France. Beautiful, fearless, brilliant and a considerable heiress, this
  strange woman was married in the orthodox manner, bore two children, left her
  husband and came to Paris where she led a life of complete independence that
  amazed and fascinated her contemporaries. In a series of seductively written
  novels that dealt with grace, skill and fire with romantic passion, Madame
  Dudevant, using the <i>nom de guerre</i> George Sand, made herself famous
  throughout Europe. The money that she earned by her success enabled her to
  take a succession of lovers, mostly distinguished men, and to defy her
  husband and all conventions. Her bold personality, her dazzling charm, her
  eccentric habits, among which were cigar smoking and the wearing of masculine
  attire, made this arch-romantic in many ways the wonder of an age that had
  not seen any such audaciously successful assertion of feminine
  independence.</p>

  <p>George Sand's theories that love as an end justifies any means and that
  infidelity to an individual is of no matter if fidelity to love be
  maintained, were passionately and entrancingly expressed in her famous
  romances, regarded by one section of the public as poison, by another as
  nectar. Her generally successful attempts to live as the heroines of her own
  novels were carried out with skill, courage and good humour. None of her
  lovers left her, it was always she that tired first of the glorious
  experiment.</p>

  <p>In 1836 George Sand brought proceedings against her husband for the
  recovery of her dowry and was successful; after taking part on the side of
  the republicans in the revolution of 1840, she retired to Nohant where she
  played the part of <i>châtelaine</i> with much grace.</p>

  <p>Charles Louis Vicomte Alfred de Musset was born in Paris and studied in
  the collège de Henri Quatre, where one of his closest friends was the future
  Louis Philippe, King of the French. De Musset's first literary effort was a
  drama founded on de Quincey's <i>Confessions of an Opium Eater</i>, and this
  introduced him to the men who then formed the romantic school in France,
  Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Alfred de Vigny and many others. Alfred de Musset
  soon made a brilliant reputation for himself and became one of the most
  dazzling of Parisian celebrities. His health, however, was not good and when
  George Sand met him he was already addicted to what the romantics termed 'the
  emerald poison'&mdash;that is, absinthe, then a novel stimulant among
  educated people. The celebrated poet met George Sand, then in the first
  splendour of her peculiar glory of emancipated womanhood, at a dinner given
  by Buloz, the editor of <i>La Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, at the restaurant
  <i>Les Frères Provençaux</i>. Shortly afterwards George Sand sent her newly
  published <i>Lélia</i> to de Musset, and within a few months they were
  declared lovers, living together in a state of rapturous happiness. In
  December, 1834, they left together on the famous journey to Italy that they
  intended to be the perfect romance in a perfect setting. By way of Lyons and
  Avignon they arrived at Genoa, then travelled on to Leghorn, Pisa and
  Florence. On the 19th of January, 1834, they were in Venice; here George Sand
  was taken ill with fever and dysentery which lasted several weeks; she had
  scarcely recovered when she had her companion on her hands with a disease
  that proved to be brain fever brought on by drink. The lovers were then
  lodging in the Hotel Danieli on the Riva degli Schivoni, and alarmed by the
  condition of de Mus set, his mistress sought and found a doctor, a certain
  Pietro Pagello who was extremely interested in the voluptuously attractive
  woman of thirty years with her black hair and eyes and the blond
  youth&mdash;de Musset was aged twenty-three&mdash;who was so dangerously ill
  that for fifteen days and nights Pagello and George Sand took the watch by
  his bed in turns. The physician was young, handsome, charming and a poet;
  George Sand soon declared her passion for him in a letter of three pages that
  she gave to him addressed&mdash;"To the stupid Pagello." They became lovers,
  and as soon as de Musset was out of danger he set out for Paris while Pagello
  and his magnificent mistress left together for Lago di Garda.</p>

  <p>George Sand and Pagello afterwards came to Paris, but she soon tired of
  the blond Venetian who found himself stranded in France without friends or
  money; he returned to Italy, took a practice at Belluno, was twice married
  and died at a great age in 1898. It was only in the last years of his life
  that Dr. Pagello consented to speak of his brief <i>liaison</i> with George
  Sand and to disclose the details of the affair. His correspondence with the
  novelist, however, was lost or destroyed. Only the letter&mdash;described as
  "a burning hymn to Eros"&mdash;here given, was preserved.</p>

  <p>Alfred de Musset survived his Venetian adventure; he died at the age of
  forty-eight years; his constitution, nervous and delicate as it was, having
  resisted for so long the alcoholism that Dr. Pagello had found chronic in the
  youth whom he visited in Venice.</p>

  <p>Under the inspiration of this double love-affair George Sand wrote, while
  still in Venice, <i>Jacques</i> and Lettres <i>d'un voyageur</i>, while de
  Mus set put his side of the case in <i>On ne Badine pas avec l'Amour</i>, and
  <i>La Confession d'un Enfant du siècle</i>; George Sand used the subject in
  <i>Elle et Lui</i> and de Musset retorted with <i>Lui et Elle</i>. The lovers
  were accused, with some justice, of making "copy" out of their much
  advertised passion.</p>

  <p>After the death of Alfred de Musset, George Sand permitted the publication
  of the genuine letters on which so much fiction had been based. It is
  impossible to decide how far these are the sincere expression of sincere
  feelings, and impossible to judge what standard of sincerity these
  self-conscious romantics possessed. The letter to Pagello, written in such
  strange circumstances, is certainly the expression of an outburst of genuine
  passion felt by a most remarkable woman.</p>

  <p>The George Sand, de Musset, Pagello <i>roman à trois</i> has been called
  the typical love story of the nineteenth century as that of J. J. Rousseau
  and Madame d'Houdetot was the typical love story of the eighteenth century.
  This is a French point of view, but no collection of love letters could
  exclude some pages from this '<i>grand roman de passion</i>' though the
  letters do not translate well and lose half their flavour and point in an
  English dress. The use of the second person singular has not been retained,
  as this sounds stilted in English. The letters from George Sand and Alfred de
  Musset are taken from: <i>Correspondante de George Sand et d'Alfred de
  Musset</i>, edited Felix Decori, Brussels, 1904.</p>

  <p>The letter from George Sand to Dr. Pagello is from: <i>Le Cabinet Secret
  de l'Histoire</i>, Dr. Cabanes, 4th Series, Paris N.D.</p>

  <p>The collected correspondence of George Sand and Alfred de Musset was given
  by the former to M. Emile Aucante, after it had been read over and arranged
  by herself, in order that he might publish it when he thought proper. De
  Musset had returned to his mistress all the letters that she had written to
  him, so that the correspondence was complete.</p>

  <p>The first part of this consists of eleven letters written by Alfred to
  George while they were in Paris, the second part begins after the failure of
  the roman à trois and the rupture at Venice, when the lady had gone to live
  with Dr. Pagello; the first of these letters is from de Musset.<br>

  emotions, the sufferings, caused by our separation. And then, I was so ill
  myself when I returned home, that I feared that I should not have the
  strength. M. Rebizzo came to see me and insisted that I should sleep at his
  place. They were very kind to me, and talked of you with so much interest
  that I felt a little better. I write now from Treviso. I left Venice this
  morning at six o'clock. I shall certainly be at Vicenza this evening and I
  shall go to the inn where you stayed. I ought to find there a letter from
  Antonio, to whom I strongly recommended that he should leave your news for
  me. I am obliged to remain here an hour or two because Pagello has a visit to
  make and begged me to take this way, that, according to him, is no longer
  than the other. I shall not be tranquil until this evening&mdash;and
  then&mdash;what tranquillity! So long a journey and you still so weak! Good
  Heavens! Good Heavens! Shall I pray to God from the morning to the evening. I
  hope that He will hear me. I shall find your letter to-morrow at Venice. It
  will arrive there about the same time as I shall. Do not be anxious about me.
  I am as strong as a horse, but do not tell me to be gay and tranquil. I
  cannot be that so soon. Poor angel, how did you pass last night? I hope that
  you slept through sheer fatigue. Be sensible and prudent, and good, as you
  promised me. Write to me from every town where you stop or, if that wearies
  you, at least let Antonio write to me. I shall write to Geneva or Turin
  according as you let me know what route you take when you write from Milan.
  Farewell, farewell, my angel. May God protect you, guide you and one day lead
  you here, where I am. In any case, I shall certainly see you in the holidays.
  And with what happiness? Do we not love each other well, my little brother,
  my child? Ah, who will take care of you and who will look after me? Who will
  need me, and whom shall I cherish now? How shall I do without both the good
  and evil you did to me? And you, can you forget the sufferings that I have
  caused you and remember only the good days? These last are balm for me at
  least and soothe my wounded heart. Farewell, my little bird, always love your
  poor old George.</p>

  <p>I add nothing on behalf of Pagello, only that he weeps for you almost as
  much as I do and that when I told him all that you charged me to say to
  him...he rushed away in a passion and sobbing.</p>

  <p>Dated from TREVISO, March 30.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER V</p>

  <p class="cpi">Alfred to George</p>

  <p>GENEVA, April 5th, 1834.</p>

  <p>MY BELOVED GEORGE, I am at Geneva. I left Milan without having found a
  letter of yours at the post. Perhaps you have written to me, but I booked our
  places in advance, as by chance the post from Venice, that usually arrives
  two hours before the departure of the coach to Geneva, was, this time, much
  delayed. I beg you, if you have written to me at Milan, to write the
  Postmaster there to forward your letter to Paris. I want it, if it is only
  two lines. Write to me at Paris, my love, I left you very fatigued, very
  exhausted from those two months of sorrow; besides, you have told me that you
  have much to say to me. Above all tell me that you are tranquil, that you are
  happy. You know that I supported the journey very well, Antonio will have
  told you that. I am strong, well, almost happy. Shall I tell you that I have
  not suffered, that I have not very often wept in those sad nights spent in
  inns? To do so would be to boast myself a brute and you would not believe
  that of me. I still love you passionately, George. In four days there will be
  three hundred leagues between us, so why should I not speak to you frankly?
  At this distance there can be no more violence or attacks of nerves; I love
  you, I know that you are with a man whom you love and yet I am calm. While I
  write tears stream over my hands, but they are the sweetest, the dearest
  tears that I have ever shed. I am calm; it is not a child exhausted from
  fatigue that talks thus to you. I declare that the sun in its orbit is no
  brighter than that light I have in my heart. I did not want to write to you
  until I was sure of myself, so many things have passed through this poor
  head! I awaken from such a strange dream. This morning I hastened through the
  street of Geneva, gazing into the shops; a new waistcoat, a fine edition of
  an English book&mdash;these attracted my attention. Chancing to see myself in
  a mirror, I recognised the child that I once was. What have you done, my poor
  friend? Was this the man that you wanted to love! Your heart was saddened
  with ten years of suffering, for ten years you had longed for happiness, and
  I was the reed on which you leant! You to love me! My poor George, that makes
  me tremble. I have made you so unhappy! And what greater miseries was I not
  about to cause you! I shall see it for a long time, my George, that face
  blanched by the watches spent beside my couch! I shall for a long time see
  you in that fatal chamber where so many tears have been shed.</p>

  <p>Poor George! Poor dear child! You deceived yourself; you believed that you
  were my mistress, and you were only my mother; heaven made us, one for the
  other; our minds met in their elevated sphere, and recognising one another
  like the mountain birds, flew towards one another, but the embrace was too
  powerful; we committed incest. Oh, well, my only love, I have been as a
  tormentor for you, at least recently, I have made you suffer so much, but God
  be praised, what I might have done that would have been worse still, that I
  did not do. Oh, my child, you live, you are beautiful, you are young, you are
  under the most beautiful sky in the world, leaning on a man that has a heart
  worthy of you. Splendid young man! Tell him how much I like him and that I
  cannot restrain my tears in thinking of him. Ah, well, I have not cheated
  Providence, I have not turned from you the hand that you needed for your
  happiness to clasp! In leaving you I did perhaps the simplest thing in the
  world, but my heart dilates&mdash;despite my tears&mdash;to think that I have
  done it. I took with me two strange companions&mdash;sorrow and a limitless
  joy. When you pass the Simplon, George, think of me. It was there that the
  eternal spectres of the Alps rose before me in all their strength and calm. I
  was alone in the cabriolet, I do not know how to express what I felt. It
  seemed to me that these giants spoke to me of all the grandeurs that leave
  the hand of God. I am no more than a child, I cried to myself, but I have two
  great friends and they are happy. Write to me, my George. Be sure that I
  shall look after your affairs. May my friendship never be unfortunate to you.
  Respect it, this friendship more ardent than love, it is all that is good in
  me, think of that; it is the work of God. You are the thread that attaches me
  to Him; think of the life that awaits me.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[This ardent correspondence continued on these lines
  until July 1834, when George Sand and Dr. Pagello went to Paris; cordial
  letters had been exchanged between the two men and the lady whom they both
  loved confessed that her heart was really divided between them, as the
  following letter shows.]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VI</p>

  <p class="cpi">George to Alfred</p>

  <p>VENICE, May 1834.</p>

  <p>...I have here, near to me, my friend, my support, he does not suffer, he
  is not feeble, he is not suspicious, he has never known the bitternesses that
  used to corrode your heart; he has no need of my strength, he has his own
  calm and his own virtue. He loves me peacefully, he is happy without causing
  me suffering, without my having to work for his happiness. Ah, well, I need
  to suffer for someone, I need to employ my excess of energy and sensibility.
  I have need to use this sense of maternal solicitude that is used to watching
  over some weary, suffering creature Oh, why can I not live between you both
  and make you both happy, without belonging to either one or the other? I
  could have lived ten years like that...Alas, how the things of this world are
  vain and deceitful and how the heart of man changes when it hears the voice
  of God! I have listened for this, and I think that I have heard it. And yet
  men cry low words after me: Horror, madness, scandal, lies!&mdash;What does
  this mean? What is the cause of all these maledictions? Of what now am I
  accused:&mdash;I remember when I was in a convent, the <i>rue
  Saint-Marceau</i> passed behind our chapel. When the market women raised
  their voices one could hear their blasphemies even in the depth of the
  sanctuary. But for me it was merely a sound striking the outer walls that
  drew me from my prayers in the evening silence. I heard the noise, I
  understood nothing of the coarse oaths, I turned again to my devotions
  without either my ear or my heart being soiled by these blasphemies. Since, I
  have retired into love as into a sanctuary, and sometimes the foul abuse
  outside has made me raise my head, but it has not interrupted the hymn that I
  address to Heaven and I merely say to myself, these are the vulgar hucksters
  that pass by.</p>

  <p>It is too late for me to go to Constantinople. The heat has come before my
  money arrived. I shall go another season, with Pagello, who hopes, perhaps
  with reason, to find some fortune out of such a journey. A steam boat service
  is being organised to take the passengers from Venice to Trieste through all
  the islands of the Archipelago. Be then, at peace for the present. I am still
  at Venice and I look after myself, for I am not absolutely well. I am always
  suffering, as you know&mdash;but you, how are you? I hope that you don't
  travel alone, and that you always keep Antonio with you. You still have him?
  You are pleased with him? He did not know what he meant to me when he left
  Venice&mdash;this hairdresser that took my place! Alas! Alas! Perhaps the
  most bitter and profound sigh of my life was in the sound of the wave that
  detached me from the bank of Fusina! Yes, we will return there in August,
  whatever happens, shall we not? You will then perhaps be engaged in another
  love-affair. I want that and yet I fear it. My child, I do not know what
  feelings are roused in me when I think of that possibility. If I could clasp
  her hand and tell her how you must be cherished and loved.</p>

  <p>But she would be jealous. She will say to you&mdash;¬'Don't speak to me of
  Madame Sand, she is an infamous woman.' Ah, I, at least, can talk of you
  continually, without ever seeing a clouded brow, without hearing a bitter
  word. Your memory is like a sacred relic here, your name is a solemn word
  that I whisper sometimes in the evenings, across the silent lagoons, and that
  is answered by a faint voice, saying brief, sweet, simple words <i>Io
  l'amo</i> (I love you) that seem to me so beautiful! It does not matter, my
  child, love, be loved and may my memory never poison any of your joys.
  Sacrifice this memory, if you must. God be my witness, however, that I should
  despise anyone that suggested that I should not only curse you, but forget
  you.</p>

  <p>Farewell, my little angel, if you rejoin God before I do, keep a little
  place up there for me, near to you&mdash;and be sure if I go first I shall
  keep a good one for you. Pagello charges me to say that he does not write to
  you for fear of troubling you, but that he embraces you with all his heart.
  As for me, I press you to my heart and bless you. I was about to write you
  another letter for the <i>Revue</i>. Tell me where I should address it, I
  want you to be the first to read it in manuscript. But if you are in
  Switzerland, so much travelling may destroy it. If you go to Aix, write to me
  from there and I will send it there: and you can send it direct to Buloz.
  Send me, with the other things that I asked for, some cigarette papers, my
  Beethoven symphonies, Weber's <i>Valse Sentimentale</i> and Vaccai's
  <i>Juliette</i>. You can bring the case with you and send it from Lyons or
  Geneva, so that it will cost me only half the carriage. Have you still our
  little birds?</p>

  <p>The third part of the correspondence opens with the farewell letter
  written by Alfred de Musset about a month after the return of George Sand and
  Pagello to Paris.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VII</p>

  <p class="cpi">Alfred to George</p>

  <p>PARIS to PARIS (August 1834).</p>

  <p>Georgette, yesterday, on leaving you, I asked from my mother the means to
  go to the Pyrenees. She gave it to me and I leave in four days. It is no
  one's fault, but I feel neither fear nor false shame in saying to you&mdash;'
  I counted too much on myself when I wished to see you again, and I have
  received the final blow.'</p>

  <p>I must again begin another sad task&mdash;after five months of struggle
  and suffering; I shall place, for the second time, sea and mountains between
  us. This will be the final test; I do not know what it will cost me, but my
  Father above, when I appear before Him, will not call me a coward. I have
  done all that is needful to enable me to live. I shall wait for money over
  there, and if God permits, I shall see my mother again, but I shall never
  re-visit France. I have seen you happy, I have heard you say that you are so.
  It would have been sweet for me to have remained your friend and to know that
  your souls in their gentle joy were kindly disposed towards my sorrow. But
  Destiny does not relent. The world shall know my story for I shall myself
  write it; perhaps it will not be of any use to anyone, but those who follow
  my path will see where it leads, those who walk on the edge of the abyss will
  blench perhaps, when they hear me fall. That was my mission. Do you fear that
  I shall ever accuse you&mdash;you for whom I accomplished it! You must be
  life or death to me; your choice is right, it was what I made myself.</p>

  <p>The day that I left Venice you gave up entirely to me. Now I leave for
  ever, I go alone, without a companion, without even a dog. I ask of you an
  hour and a last kiss. If you fear a moment of sadness, if my demand vexes
  Pierre [Pagello] do not hesitate to refuse me. It will be hard, but I shall
  not complain. But if you have any courage, receive me alone, in your own
  home, or elsewhere, where you will. Why should you fear to hear the solemn
  voice of Destiny speak aloud? Did you not weep yesterday when this Destiny
  murmured the sad air of my poor valse through that half-open window? Do not
  think ever to find either an offended pride or an importunate sorrow in me.
  Receive me on your heart, and we will speak neither of the past, nor the
  present nor the future. It will not be the farewell of M. This and Madame
  That, but that of two suffering minds, two wounded eagles who meet in the
  heavens and exchange a cry of grief before separating for all eternity. It
  will be an embrace chaste as celestial love, profound as human sorrow. Oh my
  betrothed! Place the crown of thorns gently on my brow and farewell! The last
  memory of your old age will be of a child no longer there.</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER VIII</p>

  <p class="cpi">Alfred to George</p>

  <p>I thank you for granting my request. As for my resolution to go away, do
  not let us talk of it, for it is irrevocable. I took it yesterday evening on
  going to bed; this morning I opened my windows and looked at the sun, which
  from the height of the celestial spheres has seen nothing that can change my
  resolution. Though you have known me as a child, believe that to-day I am a
  man. I deceive myself in nothing, I fear nothing, I hope for nothing. That I
  shall be familiar with despair is possible&mdash;but it will not be an inward
  despair, but one that I feel, that I can calculate on, that I can control. I
  beg you, no word of that subject, and do not fear that one shall escape me
  You tell me that I am deceived as to my feelings. Now that is not so. I feel
  the only love that I shall ever have in my life. I tell you this, aloud and
  frankly, because I have reasoned with this love, day by day, minute by
  minute, in solitude and in crowds, for five months and I know it to be
  invincible. But so is my will. They can only destroy one another, but it
  depends on me which will triumph. Do not give yourself the trouble to think
  of all this,&mdash;that I have thought of for so long. When I took the risk
  of wishing to see you I calculated every hazard&mdash;this is what came out.
  Do not afflict yourself, however, and be assured that not a drop of
  bitterness remains in my heart. I have written to Buloz and I dine with him
  to-day, to discuss business, so that I can have some money sent to me when I
  am away. It is probable that I shall go first to Toulouse, to stay with my
  uncle, of whom I have often spoken to you, from there to the Pyrenees, and
  then, in a month or two to Cadiz, by water. Write to me when you wish to see
  me. I leave Wednesday or Thursday at the latest. Farewell, my well beloved
  Georgette. Your child, Alfred.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Madame Sand, despite these two ardent letters, hesitated
  to accord the farewell interview, and de Musset wrote again.]</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER IX</p>

  <p>It is too much or too little. Do you lack courage? Let us meet and I will
  give you some. Speak or do not speak, the lips of men cannot form words that
  I am afraid of. You admit that you do not fear to wound Pierre [Pagello] in
  seeing me. What is it then? Your position is not changed? My self-respect,
  you say? Listen, listen, George, if you have any heart, let us meet
  somewhere, in my house, in yours, in the Botanical Gardens, in the cemetery,
  by the tomb of my father&mdash;it is there that I would wish to say farewell
  to you. Open your heart, without reluctance or suspicion. Listen to my vow to
  die with your love in my heart, a last kiss and farewell! What do you fear?
  Oh, my child, recall that sad evening in Venice, when you told me that you
  had a secret. You thought that you spoke to a stupid, jealous creature. No,
  my George, to a friend&mdash;Providence changed suddenly the man to whom you
  spoke. Remember that. In the midst of this life of misery and suffering, God
  has, perhaps, accorded me the consolation of being, in a way, useful to you.
  Be sure of it, yes, I feel it, I am not your evil genius. Who knows what
  Heaven wants with us? Perhaps I am yet destined to give you repose again.
  Remember that I go away, my child. Do not lightly close eternal gates. And
  more! After having suffered, during five months, and now leaving to suffer
  again, leaving for ever, knowing you unhappy when I have sacrificed
  everything to make you tranquil&mdash;am I to go without a farewell! Ah, it
  is too much, too much! I am very young&mdash;dear God, what have I done to
  deserve this?</p>

  God, how would it be possible that I should not be ill? But I am going to
  Nohant, to pass the holidays there with my children. I do not want to be the
  cause of your exile. I have told him all. He is good, he understands
  everything He wishes me to see you&mdash;without him&mdash;for the last time,
  and wishes me to try to persuade you to stay, at least until I return from
  Nohant. Come then and see me. I am too ill to leave the house and the weather

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XI</p>

  <p class="cpi">Alfred to George</p>

  <p>I send you a last farewell, my well-beloved, and I send it to you with
  confidence, not without grief, but without despair. The cruel agonies, the
  poignant struggles, the bitter tears have been replaced by a tender
  companion, pale and gentle Melancholy. This morning, after a tranquil night,
  I found her at my bedside, with a sweet smile on her lips. This is the friend
  that will go with me. She bears your last kiss on her forehead. Why should I
  fear to tell you so? Was it not as chaste, as pure as your beautiful soul, oh
  my well-beloved? You will never reproach yourself with those two sad hours
  that we have passed together. You will keep the memory of them. They were
  poured on my wounds like a healing balm. You will never repent having left to
  your poor friend a memory that he will carry like a talisman between the
  world and himself, during all the pains and joys of the future. Our love is
  consecrated, my child; yesterday it received, before God, the holy baptism of
  our tears. It is immortal as He is. I neither hope nor fear any more. I have
  done with the earth. No greater happiness is in store for me. Oh, my
  cherished sister, I am leaving my country, my mother, my friends, the world
  where I spent my youth, I go away alone, for ever, and I thank God. He that
  is loved by you can no longer curse. George, I can still suffer now, but I
  can no longer curse. As to our future relations, you alone shall decide all
  that regards my life, speak, say the word, my child, my life is yours.</p>

  <p>Write to me that I must go and die in silence in a corner of the earth,
  three hundred leagues away from you and I will do it. Consult your heart, if
  you believe that God tells you to do so, cease to defend our poor friendship,
  only send me from time to time a handclasp, a word, a tear&mdash;all, these
  are my only blessings. But if you believe that you must sacrifice our
  friendship, if my letters, sent even from beyond France, trouble your
  happiness, or only your repose, do not hesitate to forget me. I tell you that
  I can suffer much, at present, without complaining. Be happy at all costs.
  Oh, be happy, well-beloved of my soul! Time is inexorable, Death is
  avaricious, and the last years of youth pass more quickly than do the first.
  Be happy, but, if you cannot, forget that happiness is possible. Yesterday
  you told me that you had never been so! What did I reply? I do not know,
  alas! It is not for me to speak of this. Those condemned to death do not deny
  their God. Be happy, be brave, have patience, have pity. Try to vanquish a
  just pride. Restrain your heart, my noble George, you have too much heart for
  a human bosom. But if you renounce life, if you ever find yourself alone in
  face of unhappiness, recall the vow that you made me&mdash;"I will not die
  without you." Remember that, remember that, you promised it to me before
  God.</p>

  <p>But I shall not die, no, not without having written my book, on myself, on
  you&mdash;you above all, no, my beautiful, my sainted betrothed, you shall
  not rest beneath the cold earth before that earth knows what it has borne.
  No, no, I swear by my youth and my genius, only stainless lilies shall grow
  on your tomb. I with these hands will place a marble to bear your
  epitaph&mdash;a marble whiter than the statues of our glories of a day.
  Posterity will repeat our names together with those of immortal lovers who
  were as one, as Romeo and Juliet, as Héloïse and Abélard. They will never
  speak of one without the other. This will be a marriage more sacred and
  chaste than any that the priests make, the imperishable marriage of
  Intelligence. The people of the future will recognise the symbol of the only
  God that they adore. Has not someone said that the resolutions of the human
  spirit are always announced to their century by heralds? Ah, well, the
  century of Intelligence has arrived. She rises, this sovereign of the future,
  from the ruins of the world; she will engrave our portraits on one of the
  stones of her necklace.</p>

  <p>She will be the priest that blesses us, that will lay us in the tomb as a
  mother leads her daughter to her marriage bed. She will write our initials on
  the new bark of the tree of life. I shall end my story with a hymn of love. I
  shall make an appeal, from the bottom of a heart twenty years old to all the
  children of the earth; I shall sound in the ears of this blaze [sic],
  corrupt, atheistic and dissolute century, the trumpet of human resurrection,
  the trumpet that Christ left at the foot of his cross. Jesus! Jesus! I too am
  the son of thy Father! I offer Thee the kisses of my betrothed. It is thou
  that hast sent them to me, across so many dangers, across so many distances
  that she has faced to come to me. I shall make, for her, for myself, a tomb
  that will always be green, and perhaps future generations will repeat some of
  my words, perhaps some day they will bless those who have struck with the
  myrtle of love at the door of liberty!</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XII</p>

  <p class="cpi">Alfred to George</p>

  <p>Sept. 1st (1834).</p>

  <p>It is eight days since I left and you have not yet written. I waited for a
  calm moment, there are no more such. I wished to write to you gently,
  tranquilly, on a beautiful morning, to thank you for the farewell that you
  sent me, it was so good, so sad, so sweet; my dear beloved, you have the
  heart of an angel. I want to talk to you only of my love; ah George, what
  love! Man has never loved as I love you. I am lost, understand that, I am
  drowned, swamped in love; I no longer know if I live, if I eat, if I walk, if
  I breathe, if I speak; I only know that I love. Ah, if all your life you have
  had a yearning for inexhaustible happiness, if it is a happiness to be loved,
  if you have ever asked this love of Heaven, oh, my life, my blessing, my
  well-beloved, look at the sun, the flowers, the grass, all the world, and
  know that you are loved, as all these will tell you, loved as God might be by
  his Levites, his saints, his martyrs! I love you, oh, my flesh and my blood!
  I die of love, of an endless nameless love, an insensate, desperate lost
  love! You are loved, adored, idolised till death! No, I shall never be cured,
  no, I shall not try to live, I love better than that, to die loving you is
  worth more than living. I know well enough what they are saying. They say
  that you have another lover. I know it well, I die of it, but I love, I love,
  I love. Who are they to prevent me from loving? Understand, when I left you,
  I was not suffering, there was no place in my heart for that. I had held you
  in my arms, oh, my adored one! I had pressed you to this cherished wound! I
  left you without knowing what I did. I do not know if my mother was
  sad&mdash;I think not, I embraced her, I left without saying anything&mdash;I
  had the breath from your lips on mine, I still breathed your perfume. Ah,
  George, you are tranquil and happy there, you lost nothing. But do you know
  what it is to wait five months for a kiss? Do you know what a poor heart
  endures, that for five months has felt, day by day, hour by hour, life
  abandon it, the cold of the tomb descend slowly in the solitude, death and
  oblivion falling drop by drop like snow? Do you know what it feels like for a
  heart that has almost ceased to beat, to dilate for a moment, to re-open like
  a poor dying flower, to drink again a drop of heaven sent-dew? Oh, my God, I
  know it well, I have felt it; we must not see each other again. However, now
  all is finished. I said to myself that I must try to take up life again, try
  to find another love, forget yours, to have courage. I tried, I made the
  attempt, at least. But now, understand me, I prefer my sufferings to life,
  you have permitted me to love you, it will avail you nothing to retract that
  promise, you even wish me to love you, your heart wishes it, you cannot deny
  this, and I, I am lost. You understand, I can no longer answer for
  anything.</p>

  <p>What am I trying to do, wandering here and there? What do all these
  mountains, trees and all these Germans with their rigmarole mean to me? What
  to me is this inn room? They say that this is fine, that the view is
  charming, the promenade agreeable, that the women dance and the men smoke,
  drink and sing and that horses gallop. All this is not life&mdash;it is only
  the sound of life. Listen, George, no more, I beg you, not a word to dissuade
  me, no more consolations, no more talk of youth, glory, the future,
  hope&mdash;no more good advice or reproaches. All that only reminds me that I
  am young, that I have believed in happiness, that I have a mother, all that
  makes me wish to weep and I have no more tears. I am not mad, as you know, I
  shall struggle all that I can. I have still some strength; but one's
  strength, of what use is that when it turns against a man? Nothing, nothing.
  I implore you, do not make me suffer, do not recall me to life. 1 promise
  you, I swear to struggle, if I can. Do not say that I write in a moment of
  fever or delirium and that I shall become calmer, for eight days I have been
  waiting for one quarter of an hour of calm&mdash;one moment even, in which to
  write to you. I know very well that I am young, that I have aroused hopes in
  some loving hearts&mdash;I well know that they have some claims. Have I not
  done what I could? I have gone away, I have left everything. What have they
  to say? What happens now concerns only myself. It would be too cruel to say
  to a wretch that dies of love that he must not die. The bulls wounded in the
  circus have permission to go to a corner and die there in peace with the
  matador's sword in their shoulder. So, I beg you, not a word; listen, all
  this does not prevent you from taking your travelling coat, horse or a little
  carriage, and coming here. I look in vain&mdash;I am seated here before this
  little table, in the midst of your letters, with your portrait that I always
  carry! You tell me that we shall see one another again, that you will not die
  without embracing me again: you see that I suffer, you weep with me, you
  allow me to cherish sweet illusions, you talk of our coming together again,
  all that is good, my angel, all that is sweet; God will repay you for it. But
  I can well gaze at my door, you do not come to knock at it, do you? You do
  not take a scrap of paper, no longer than a hand and write on
  it&mdash;'Come!' There are between us I know not what phrases, I know not
  what duties, I know not what events&mdash;there is also between us a hundred
  and fifty leagues. Ah, well, all that is perfect&mdash;it does not take long
  to say this&mdash;I cannot live without you, that is all. How long all this
  can still continue, I do not know. I wished to write my book, but I have
  first to know in detail, and according to the different periods, the story of
  your life; I know your character, but I only have a confused idea of your
  life; I do not know everything, and what I do know I know imperfectly. I must
  see you and you must tell me everything. If you like I could hire, in the
  suburbs of Moulins or Châteauroux, an attic with a table, a bed, and you, on
  horseback, could come to see me, once or twice, alone. I should see no other
  living soul, I should write, weep&mdash;everyone would believe me in Germany.
  There would be some beautiful moments. I hope that you would not feel that
  you were betraying anyone; the last time you saw me die of love in your arms,
  have you anything with which to reproach yourself? But all the dreams that I
  can dream are chimeras, nothing is real, but phrases, duties, things, it is
  well, it is better thus. Oh, my betrothed, I ask of you, however, one thing.
  Go out one fair evening, alone, as the sun sets, go into the country, seat
  yourself on the grass, under some green willow, look into the east and think
  of your dying child. Try to forget everything else; re-read my letters, if
  you still have them, or my little book, ponder, give way to your tender
  heart, allow me a tear, then return home, quietly, light your lamp, take your
  pen, give an hour to your poor friend. To make an effort to do this will not
  be a crime. You can even tell me more than you feel, I shall not know it and
  that would be no crime either since I am lost. But let there be nothing in
  your letter but your friendship for me, your love, George, do you not call it
  love? Write to <i>poste restante, Grand Duchy of Baden</i>, frank it as far
  as the frontier and put&mdash;<i>near Strasbourg</i>. It is twelve leagues
  from Strasbourg, I shall go neither farther nor nearer. But let me have this
  letter, containing nothing but your love; and tell me that you give me your
  lips, your hair, all that face that I have possessed, and tell me that we
  embrace&mdash;you and I! O God, O God, when I think of it, my throat closes,
  my sight is troubled; my knees fail, ah, it is horrible to die, it is also
  horrible to love like this! What longing, my George, what longing I have for
  you! I beg you to let me have the letter I ask. I am dying, farewell.
  <i>Poste restante, Grand Duchy of Baden, near Strasbourg.</i></p>

  <p>Oh, my life, my life, I press you to my heart. Oh, my George, my beautiful
  mistress! My first, my last love!</p>

  <p class="lhd">LETTER XIII</p>

  <p class="cpi">George to Alfred</p>

  <p>PARIS (Autumn 1834).</p>

  <p>I was sure that reproaches would follow the dreamed of, promised
  happiness, and that you would make a crime out of what you accepted as a
  right. And have we, good Heavens, already come to this! Well, do not let us
  go any further, rather, let us part. I wished for that yesterday&mdash;in my
  mind I had resolved on an eternal farewell. Remember your former despair, and
  all that you said in order to induce me to believe that I was necessary to
  you, that without me you were lost; and once again I was crazy enough to wish
  to save you. But you are more ruined than you were formerly and, as soon as I
  satisfied you, it is against me that you turn your rage and your despair.
  What's to do, good Heavens? Ah, I have had enough of life! What do you want
  now, what do you ask of me? Questions, suspicions, recriminations, already,
  already! And why do you talk to me of Pierre [Pagello] when I have forbidden
  you ever to mention him? What right, besides, have you to question me as to
  what happened in Venice? Was I yours ever when we were at Venice? Did you
  not, the very first day, when you saw that I was ill, show temper and say
  that nothing was more gloomy and tiresome than a sick woman? And was not that
  first day the beginning of our rupture? My child, I do not wish to use
  recriminations, you, even you, who forget so easily what has happened, must
  remember this. I don't wish to tell you of your wrongdoings; never have I
  reproached you with anything, never have I reproached you with anything,
  never have I complained of having been taken from my children, my friends, my
  work, my affections and my duties, to be conducted three hundred leagues and
  then abandoned, with offensive, heartbreaking words, merely because I had a
  tertian fever, downcast eyes and was profoundly sad because of your
  indifference. I never complained, I hid my tears from you, but a certain
  evening that I shall never forget, in the casino Danieli, these words were
  spoken: "George, I have deceived myself, I ask your pardon, <i>but I do not
  love you</i>." If I had not been ill, if I had not been waiting to be bled on
  the next day, I should have left then. But you had no money, I did not know
  if you would accept any from me, and I would not, I could not, leave you
  alone in a strange country, without a <i>sou</i> and without knowing the
  language. The doors of our rooms were then closed between us and we tried to
  take up our former life of good companions. But that was no longer possible.
  You became bored; I never knew where you went in the evenings and one day you
  told me that you feared...[<i>words</i> effaced in MS.). We were sad. I said
  to you&mdash;Let <i>us go</i>, I will take you as far as Marseilles, and you
  replied&mdash;Yes, that is the best way out, but now that we are here, I
  should like to work a little first. Pierre [Pagello] came to see me, he
  looked after me. You thought nothing of being jealous, and I thought nothing
  of loving him. But, since I did love him, since I was his from that
  moment&mdash;will you tell me what accounts I have to render you, you who
  termed me 'tedium personified,' 'a dreamer,' 'a nun,' 'a beast,' I know not
  what? You so wounded and offended me that I said to you&mdash;'<i>We no
  longer love, we are no longer loved</i>.' And, now, at this time, you want
  the story, day by day and hour by hour, of my <i>liaison</i> with Pierre, and
  I do not recognise your right to question me. I should degrade myself by
  making a confession as if I were a woman who had deceived you. Admit all that
  you like that can torment us, I have only this to reply: from the first day
  that I loved Pierre, until after your departure, I told you that it was <i>my
  secret and that, no longer belonging to you, I could be his without
  accounting to you for anything</i>. I said that I loved him with a
  <i>perhaps</i>, because he was involved with former ties, with former
  mistresses, and I did not wish to engage myself to him in any way that might
  involve him in difficult or disagreeable situations. Thus there has been from
  the first, a sincerity on my part that I now recall to your mind, which your
  letters save my conscience by bearing witness to. In Venice I did not permit
  you to ask the least detail&mdash;as to whether on a certain day we kissed on
  the eyes or the forehead and so on&mdash;and I forbid you then to enter into
  a phase of my life where, as far as you are concerned, I have the right to
  drop the veils of modesty. When we became again as brother and sister, we
  lived as chastely as if we had been so, and now, when I become again your
  mistress, you must not expect me to tear aside those veils that, as regards
  Pierre, and with regard to myself, it is my duty to preserve. Do you think
  that if he had asked me the secrets of our affair I should have answered
  him?...Did I not warn you in the past that events you exalted into a
  beautiful poem, when I refused myself to you, would seem only like a
  nightmare when you had seized me once more as your prey?</p>

  <p>Come, let us part. If not, we shall be unhappier than ever. If I am wanton
  and perfidious, as you seem to tell me, why so obstinately insist on taking
  me again and in keeping me? I do not wish to love any more; I have suffered
  too much. Ah, if I were a coquette you would be less unhappy, for you want me
  to lie to you, to say" I never loved Pierre, I never belonged to him." Why do
  I not say this and make you believe it? It is because I have been sincere
  that you are tortured. We cannot, therefore, love under these conditions, and
  all that I have done to restore our friendship has been illusory! What
  remains to us, then, of a tie that seemed to us so beautiful? Ah, Heaven,
  neither love nor friendship.</p>

  <p>Happiness, happiness, and death afterwards or even at the same time! Yes,

  <p>Six o'clock.</p>

  <p>Why did we leave each other so sadly? Shall we see each other this
  evening? Can we be happy? Can we love one another? You have
  said&mdash;yes&mdash;and I tried to believe it, but it seems as if there was
  no sequence in your ideas, at the least sufferings you become indignant with
  me, as with a burden. Alas, my child! We love each other, that is the only
  certain thing between us. Time and separation have not prevented and never
  will prevent our love. But is our life together possible? Is mine possible
  with anyone? That thought frightens me, I am sad and alarmed by turns; you
  make me hope and despair at the same time. What shall I do? Do you want me to
  go away? Would you try again to forget me? I should not try to do that, but I
  could be silent and go away. If I do not fly, I feel that I shall lose you
  again as I used to. I shall perhaps kill you and myself, consider that
  well...There are times, I admit, when fear is stronger than love, and I feel
  myself paralysed like one on the crest of a mountain that dare neither
  advance nor retreat between two abysses. Love with you and a feverish life
  for us both, perhaps, or else solitude and despair for me alone. Tell me do
  you believe that you could find happiness elsewhere? Yes, it is true, you are
  twenty-three years old and the most beautiful women in the world, the best
  women, perhaps, might belong to you. While I have nothing with which to
  attach you to me, but the little good and the great evil that I have done to
  you. It is a sad dowry that I bring you. Say the word, my child, send me
  away. This time you will have no violence on my part to fear, and I shall
  never demand an account of a happiness that I have renounced. Tell me what
  you want, do what you want and do not occupy yourself with me; I shall live
  for you as long as you wish me to do so, and when you do no longer wish it, I
  shall go away without ever ceasing to cherish you and to pray for you.
  Consult your heart, your mind, too, your future, your mother; think of all
  that you have besides myself and do not sacrifice anything to me. If you do
  return to me, I can only promise you one thing, that I shall try to make you
  happy. But you would have to have patience and indulgence for my moments of
  fear and sadness, which no doubt I should still have, and such patience
  hardly belongs to your age. Consult with yourself, my angel. My life belongs
  to you, and, whatever happens, know that I love you and shall always love
  you.</p>

  Pardon me, my angel, my unfortunate well-beloved. I have suffered so much
  myself that I know not what to do. I complain to God, I ask miracles of Him,
  He does not grant them, He abandons us. What is to become of us? One of us
  ought to have the strength either to love or to cure love, and do not deceive
  yourself, neither of us has this strength. You believe, in the hope that
  comes in the morning, that you can love me, and every evening you deny it.
  You are twenty-three years old and I am thirty-one and how many misfortunes,
  how many sobs, how many heart-breaks lie behind me! Where are you going? What
  do you hope from solitude and indulgence in a grief already so poignant?
  Alas, here I am, limp and useless as a broken cord, prone on the ground, with
  my desolate love like a corpse attached to me, and I suffer so much that I
  cannot rise either to bury it or to recall it to life...And what do you hope?
  To rise again, perhaps?...Ah well, you are young, you are a poet, you are in
  the flower of your beauty and strength. Try then. As for me, I must die.
  Farewell, farewell, I will neither take you nor leave you, I want nothing,
  nothing, my knees are on the earth and my heart is broken; I can no longer
  speak of anything, I wish to embrace the earth and weep. I no longer love
  you, but I shall always adore you...Adieu, go, stay, only do not tell me that
  I do not suffer, for indeed there is nothing could make me suffer any more.

  you are most outrageous towards me I ought to box your ears. But I don't know
  how to struggle any longer. God made me gentle, yet proud. Now my pride is
  broken and my love has become merely pity. I tell you, I must cure it

  God, to what kind of life do I leave you?
  Drunkenness&mdash;wine&mdash;women&mdash;and again, and always! But I can do
  nothing more to save you, and must we prolong what has become a shame for me,

  trifle, your crazy jealousy, in the middle of all that! The more you lose the

  first from you yourself that you approved my demand...I approve decidedly
  your idea about our letters. It would have been very bitter to me to return
  yours, and if I could believe that mine had the same value in your eyes, I
  should not ask for them. But nothing of that matters much. Your letters are
  at La Chatre, deposited in a casket and in the charge of a woman who is
  devoted to me and believes them to be jewels. These letters are sealed and
  bear your superscription; I have never re-read them without sealing them
  again immediately afterwards and replacing them in this sure and inviolable
  place. I do not think that they would be so well guarded in my own home,
  death can surprise one at any minute, and one never knows what hand will
  rifle one's drawers as soon as one's eyes are closed. I could then be, better
  than you could, the guardian of this double deposit. At the same time as I
  sealed them, I should send you the address of the woman from whom you must
  claim them, if, as is probable, I leave before you for the longest voyage of
  all. First of all, when I am in the country, I will send you your letters so
  that you can delete what you wish. If you will send me mine while I am here
  you will spare me taking a heavy package to the post at La Chatre. If you
  would prefer to await the arrival of yours, do as you will.</p>

  <p class="lhdi">George Sand to Pietro Pagello</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Written in less than an hour by the bedside of Alfred de
  Musset, then seriously ill with delirium tremens and given to Dr. Pagello,
  who was present, as a declaration of love. This letter was long cherished by
  Dr. Pagello, though he had come to regard the memory of George Sand with
  indifference, and it was not without difficulty that Dr. Cabanes obtained
  permission to copy and to publish the letter that had lain for fifty years in
  an album belonging to the Pagello family, then resident at Belluno.<br>
  <br>
  It appeared for the first time in <i>Le Cabinet Secret de l'histoire</i>, 4th
  Series, Paris, N.D., by Dr. Cabanes. It is not dated, but was written in the
  summer of 1834; the hybrid word with which it begins is believed to be the
  Frenchwoman's phonetic version of the Italian <i>en amore</i>. An inscription
  on the original MS. seems to indicate that Dr. Pagello at once presented this
  letter to another woman; it is, in Italian:]</p>

  <p><i>Venice, July 10th, 1834. Pietro Pagello has given this manuscript by
  George Sand to Antonietta Segato.</i><br>
  <br>
  <i>En Moree</i></p>

  <p>Born under different skies we have neither the same thoughts nor the same
  language&mdash;have we, perhaps, hearts that resemble one another?</p>

  <p>The mild and cloudy climate from which I come has left me with gentle and
  melancholy impressions; what passions has the generous sun that has bronzed
  your brow given you? I know how to love and how to suffer, and you, what do
  you know of love?</p>

  <p>The ardour of your glances, the violent clasp of your arms, the fervour of
  your desire, tempt me and frighten me. I do not know whether to combat your
  passion or to share it. One does not love like this in my country; beside you
  I am no more than a pale statue that regards you with desire, with trouble,
  with astonishment. I do not know if you truly love me, I shall never know it.
  You can scarcely speak a few words of my language and I do not know enough of
  yours to enter into these subtle questions. Perhaps, even if I knew perfectly
  the language that you speak, I should not be able to make myself understood.
  The place where we have lived, the people that have taught us, are,
  doubtless, the causes that we have ideas, sentiments and needs, inexplicable
  one to the other. My feeble nature and your fiery temperament must produce
  very different thoughts. You must be ignorant of, or despise, the thousand
  trivial sufferings that so disturb me; you must laugh at what makes me weep.
  Perhaps you even do not know what tears are. Would you be for me a support or
  a master? Would you console me for the evils that I have endured before
  meeting you? Do you understand why I am sad? Do you understand compassion,
  patience, friendship? Perhaps you have been brought up in the idea that women
  have no souls. Do you think that they have? You are neither a Christian nor a
  Mussulman, neither civilised nor a barbarian&mdash;are you a man? What is
  there in that masculine bosom, behind that superb brow, those leonine eyes?
  Do you ever have a nobler, finer thought, a fraternal pious sentiment? When
  you sleep, do you dream that you are flying towards Heaven? When men wrong
  you do you still trust in God? Shall I be your companion or your slave? Do
  you desire me or love me? When your passion is satisfied will you thank me?
  When I have made you happy, will you know how to tell me so? Do you know what
  I am and does it trouble you not to know it? Am I for you an unknown being
  who must be sought for and dreamt of, or am I in your eyes a woman like those
  that fatten in harems? In your eyes, in which I think to see a divine spark,
  is there nothing but a lust such as these women inspire? Do you know that
  desire of the soul that time does not quench, that no excess deadens or
  wearies? When your mistress sleeps in your arms, do you stay awake to watch
  over her, to pray to God and to weep? Do the pleasures of love leave you
  breathless and brutalised or do they throw you into a divine ecstasy? Does
  your soul overcome your body when you leave the bosom of her whom you love?
  Ah, when I shall observe you withdrawn quiet, shall I know if you are
  thoughtful or at rest? When your glance is languishing will it be tenderness
  or lassitude? Perhaps you realise that I do not know you and that you do not
  know me. I know neither your past life, nor your character, nor what the men
  that know you think of you. Perhaps you are the first, perhaps the last among
  them. I love you without knowing if I can esteem you, I love you because you
  please me, and perhaps some day I shall be forced to hate you. If you were a
  man of my country, I should question you and you would understand me. But
  perhaps I should be still more unhappy, for you would mislead me. As it is,
  at least you will not deceive me, you will make no vain promises and false
  vows. You will love me as you understand love, as you can love. What I have
  sought for in vain in others, I shall not, perhaps, find in you, but I can
  always believe that you possess it. Those looks, those caresses of love that
  have always lied to me in others, you will allow me to interpret as I wish,
  without adding deceitful words to them. I shall be able to interpret your
  reveries and fill your silences with eloquence. I shall give to your actions
  the intentions that I wish them to have. When you look at me tenderly, I
  shall believe that your soul is gazing at mine; when you glance at heaven, I
  shall believe that your mind turns towards the eternity from which it sprang.
  Let us remain thus, do not learn my language, and I shall not look for, in
  yours, words to express my doubts and my fears. I want to be ignorant of what
  you do with your life and what part you play among your fellow-men. I do not
  even want to know your name Hide your soul from me that I may always believe
  it to be beautiful.</p>

  <p>George Gordon was born in London, educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and
  at Harrow, afterwards at Cambridge. In 1798, he succeeded to the title, in
  1803 proposed to and was rejected by Mary Chaworth. After publishing a few
  'fugitive verses,' and already deeply in debt, he settled in the family seat,
  Newstead Abbey, 1808. Soon after he went on his travels with John Carn
  Hobhouse and did not return to London until 1811. The publication of his
  poems brought him great fame, his beauty, wit and some mysterious charms in
  his personality made him an unprecedented social success. He was refused by
  Miss Milbanke in 1812, but married her in 1815. Dissipation, extravagance,
  ill temper and the scandal roused, even in Regency London, by his too ardent
  friendship with his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, brought about a social
  ostracism from which he fled, after his wife had left him in 1816. There were
  at this time questions raised as to his sanity. Living an eccentric life of
  crude debauchery and writing Childe Harold and Don Juan, Byron roamed about
  the continent until 1819 when he met the young Countess Teresa Guiccioli,
  with whom he formed a more or less permanent connexion. In 1823 he offered to
  join the Greeks, then in rebellion against Turkey; in January of the
  following year he landed at Missolonghi, where he died of marsh fever in the
  next April. Three specimens of his love letters have been selected; one to
  Lady Caroline Lamb (17851828) a daughter of Lord Bessborough and wife of
  William Lamb, afterwards Lord Melbourne. Separated from her husband, she
  lived in retirement after Byron's exile, and is said to have died from the
  shock of meeting his funeral procession&mdash;though she survived this
  incident several years. The second and third letters are selected from those
  Byron wrote to his wife during their long, final separation; and the' fifth
  is to the lady who held Byron's affection during the last years of his
  life.<br>

  <p class="lhdi">Lord Byron to Lady Byron</p>

  <p>PISA, November 17, 1821.</p>

  <p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of 'Ada's hair,' which is very soft and
  pretty, and nearly as dark already as mine was at twelve years old, if I may
  judge from what I recollect of some in Augusta's possession, taken at that
  age. But it don't curl, perhaps from its being let grow.</p>

  <p>I also thank you for the inscription of the date and name, and I will tell
  you why;&mdash;I believe that they are the only two or three words of your
  hand-writing in my possession. For your letters I returned; and except the
  two words, or rather the one word, 'Household,' written twice in an old
  account book I have no other. I burnt your last note, for two
  reasons:&mdash;firstly, it was written in a style not very agreeable; and,
  secondly, I wished to take your word without documents, which are the wordly
  resources of suspicious people.</p>

  <p>I suppose that this note will reach you somewhere about Ada's
  birthday&mdash;the -loth of December, I believe. She will then be six, so
  that in about twelve more I shall have some chance of meeting
  her;&mdash;perhaps sooner, if I am obliged to go to England by business or
  otherwise. Recollect, however, one thing, either in distance or
  nearness;&mdash;every day which keeps us asunder, should after so long a
  period, rather soften our mutual feelings, which must always have one
  rallying-point as long as our child exists, which I presume we both hope will
  be long after either of her parents.</p>

  <p>The time which has elapsed since the separation has been considerably more
  than the whole brief period of our union, and the not much longer one of our
  prior acquaintance. We both made a bitter mistake; but now it is over, and
  irrevocably so. For, at thirty-three on my part, and a few years less on
  yours, though it is no very extended period of life, still it is one when the
  habits and thought are generally so formed as to admit of no modification;
  and as we could not agree when younger, we should with difficulty do so
  now.</p>

  <p>I say all this, because I own to you, that notwithstanding everything, I
  considered our re-union as not impossible for more than a year after the
  separation;&mdash;but then I gave up the hope entirely and for ever. But this
  very impossibility of re-union seems to me at least a reason why, on all the
  few points of discussion which can arise between us, we should preserve the
  courtesies of life, and as much of its kindness as people who are never to
  meet may preserve perhaps more easily than nearer connexions. For my own
  part, I am violent, but not malignant; for only fresh provocations can awaken
  my resentments. To you who are colder and more concentrated, I would just
  hint, that you may sometimes mistake the depth of a cold anger for dignity,
  and a worse feeling for duty. I assure you that I bear you now (whatever I
  may have done) no resentment whatever. Remember, that if you have injured me
  in aught, this forgiveness is something; and, that if I have injured you, it
  is something more still, if it be true, as the moralists say, that the most
  offending are the least forgiving.</p>

  <p>Whether the offence has been solely on my side, or reciprocal, or on yours
  chiefly, I have ceased to reflect upon any but two things&mdash;viz. that you
  are the mother of my child, and that we shall never meet again. I think if
  you also consider the two corresponding points with reference to myself, it
  will be better for all three.</p>

  <p>Yours ever,</p>

  <p>NOEL* BYRON.</p>

  <p>August, 1812(?).</p>

  <p>MY DEAREST CAROLINE,</p>

  <p>If tears which you saw and know I am not apt to shed,&mdash;if the
  agitation in which I parted from you,&mdash;agitation which you must have
  perceived through the whole of this most nervous affair, did not commence
  until the moment of leaving you approached&mdash;if all I have said and done,
  and am still but too ready to say and do, have not sufficiently proved what
  my real feelings are, and must ever be towards you, my love, I have no other
  proof to offer. God knows, I wish you happy, and when I quit you, or rather
  you, from a sense of duty to your husband and mother, quit me, you shall
  acknowledge the truth of what I again promise and vow, that no other in word
  or deed shall ever hold the place in my affections, which is, and shall be,
  most sacred to you till I am nothing. I never knew till that moment the
  madness of my dearest and most beloved friend; I cannot express myself; this
  is no time for words, but I shall have a pride, a melancholy pleasure, in
  suffering what you yourself can scarcely conceive, for you do not know me. I
  am about to go out with a heavy heart, because my appearing this evening will
  stop any absurd story which the event of the day might give rise to. Do you
  think now I am cold and stern and artful? Will even others think so? Will
  your mother ever&mdash;that mother to whom we must indeed sacrifice much,
  more, much more on my part than she shall ever know or can imagine? 'Promise
  not to love you!' ah, Caroline, it is past promising. But I shall attribute
  all concessions to the proper motive, and never cease to feel all that you
  have already, witnessed, and more than can ever be known but to my own
  heart&mdash;perhaps to yours. May God protect, forgive and bless you. Ever,
  and even more than ever,</p>

  <p>Your most attached,<br>
  BYRON.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;These taunts which have driven you to this, my dearest
  Caroline, were it not for your mother and the kindness of your connexions, is
  there anything on earth or heaven that would have made me so happy as to have
  made you mine long ago? and not less now than then, but more than ever at
  this time. You know I would with pleasure give up all here and all beyond the
  grave for you, and in refraining from this, must my motives be misunderstood?
  I care not who knows this, what use is made of it,&mdash;it is to you and to
  you only that they are yourself [<i>sic</i>]. I was and am yours freely and
  most entirely, to obey, to honour, love,&mdash;and fly with you when, where,
  and how you yourself might and may determine.</p>

  <p class="lhdi">Lord Byron to Lady Byron</p>

  <p>VENICE, March 5th, 1817.</p>

  <p>A letter from Mr. Hanson apprises me of the result of his correspondence
  with Sir Ralph Noel (of which he has transmitted a copy), and of his
  interviews with Dr. Lushington* on the subject of our daughter. I am also
  informed of a bill in Chancery** filed against me last Spring by Sir Ralph
  Noel, of which this is the first intimation, and of the subject of which I am
  ignorant.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Dr. Stephen Lushington, the lawyer who advised the
  separation.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[** The purpose of which was to make Ada a ward in
  Chancery.]</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the result of these discussions and the measures, which
  have led to them, and to which they may lead, remember, that I have not been
  the first to begin; but, being begun neither shall I be the first to recede.
  I feel at length convinced that the feeling which I had cherished through all
  and in spite of all, namely 'the hope of a reconciliation and reunion however
  remote&mdash;is indubitably useless; and although all things considered, it
  could not be very sanguine, still it was sincere, and I cherished it as a
  sickly infatuation: and now I part with it with a regret, perhaps bitterer of
  [than] that which I felt in parting with yourself.</p>

  <p>It was generally understood, if not expressed, that all legal proceedings
  were to terminate in the act of our separation: to what then I am to
  attribute the bill, of which I am apprised, I am at a loss to conjecture. The
  object, however, is evident; it is to deprive me of my paternal right over my
  child, which I have the less merited, as I neither abused nor intended to
  abuse it. You and yours might have been satisfied with the outrages I have
  already suffered, if not by your design, at least by your means. I know your
  defence and your apology&mdash;duty and Justice; but <i>Qui n'est que juste,
  est dur</i>: or if the French aphorism should seem light in the balance, I
  could refer you to an older language and a higher authority for the
  condemnation of conduct, which you may yet live to condemn in your own
  heart.</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole of this unhappy business, I have done my best to
  avoid the bitterness, which, however, is yet amongst us; and it would be as
  well if even you at times recollected, that the man who has been sacrificed
  in fame, in feelings, in everything, to the convenience of your family, was
  he whom you once loved, and who&mdash;whatever you may imagine to the
  contrary&mdash;loved you. If you conceive that I could be actuated by revenge
  against you, you are mistaken; I am not humble enough to be vindictive.
  Irritated I may have been, and may be&mdash;is it a wonder? but upon such
  irritation, beyond its momentary expression, I have not acted, from the hour
  that you quitted me to that in which I am made aware that our daughter is to
  be the entail of our disunion, the inheritor of our bitterness. If you think
  to reconcile yourself to yourself by accumulating harshness against me, you
  are again mistaken: you are not happy, nor even tranquil, nor will you ever
  be so, even to the very moderate degree which is permitted to general
  humanity. For myself, I have a confidence in my Fortune, which will yet bear
  me through.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Chance arranges things better than we
  do&mdash;Menander, Monostichoi, 726.]</p>

  <p>The reverses, which have occurred, were that I should have expected; and,
  in considering you and yours merely as the instruments of my more recent
  adversity, it would be difficult for me to blame you, did not everything
  appear to intimate a deliberate intention of as wilful malice on your part as
  could well be digested into a system. However, time and Nemesis will do that,
  which I would not, even were it in my power remote or immediate. You will
  smile at this piece of prophecy&mdash;do so, but recollect it; it is
  justified by all human experience. No one was ever even the involuntary cause
  of great evils to others, without a requital; I have paid and am paying for
  mine&mdash;so will you.</p>

  <p>BOLOGNA, August 25, 1819.</p>

  <p>MY DEAR TERESA,</p>

  <p>I have read this book in your garden;&mdash;my love, you were absent, or
  else I could not have read it. It is a favourite book of yours, and the
  writer was a friend of mine. You will not understand these English words, and
  others will not understand them&mdash;which is the reason I have not scrawled
  them in Italian. But you will recognise the handwriting of him who
  passionately loved you, and you will divine that, over a book which was
  yours, he could only think of love. In that word, beautiful in all languages,
  but most so in yours&mdash;<i>Amor mio</i>&mdash;is comprised my existence
  here and hereafter. I feel I exist here, and I fear that I shall exist
  hereafter,&mdash;to what purpose you will decide; my destiny rests with you,
  and you are a woman, eighteen years of age, and two out of a convent. I wish
  that you had stayed there, with all my heart,&mdash;or, at least, that I had
  never met you in your married state.</p>

  <p>But all this is too late. I love you, and you love me,&mdash;at least, you
  say so, and act as if you did so, which last is a great consolation in all
  events. But I more than love you, and cannot cease to love you.</p>

  <p>Think of me, sometimes, when the Alps and the ocean divide us,&mdash;but
  they never will, unless you wish it.</p>

  <p>These two letters are given as specimens of what is probably the most
  famous as it is certainly the most high-minded and noble of all English
  correspondence on the subject of love. Miss Barrett was a poetess of some
  renown and Mr. Browning well established as a poet when they met in 1845. But
  she was an invalid and considerably his senior; it was not considered
  possible to broach even a hint of marriage to her family and for a long time
  the lady was alarmed and hesitant herself. Finally the robust, cheerful,
  strong affection of her suitor overcame her scruples, and after a secret
  marriage they eloped to Italy in 1846. The marriage was ideally happy; Mrs.
  Browning died at Florence, 1861, leaving one son. Her <i>Sonnets from the
  Portuguese</i> are a noble tribute from her to her husband, and she was the
  inspiration of most of his poetry and is directly addressed in the dedication
  to <i>The Ring and the Book</i>. These two letters were written soon after
  the secret ceremony that took place in Marylebone Church, September 12,
  1846.<br>

  <p class="lhdi">Robert Browning to Elizabeth Barrett</p>

  <p>1 p.m. Saturday (Post-mark, September 12, 1846).</p>

  <p>You will only expect a few words&mdash;what will those be? When the heart
  is full it may run over, but the real fulness stays within.</p>

  <p>You asked me yesterday 'if I should repent?' Yes&mdash;my own Ba,&mdash;I
  could wish all the past were to do over again, that in it I might somewhat
  more,&mdash;never so little more, conform in the outward homage to the inward
  feeling. What I have professed...(for' I have performed nothing) seems to
  fall short of what my first love required even&mdash;and when I think of this
  moment's love...I could repent, as I say.</p>

  <p>Words can never tell you, however,&mdash;form them, transform them
  anyway,&mdash;how perfectly dear you are to me&mdash;perfectly dear to my
  heart and soul.</p>

  <p>I look back, and in every one point, every word and gesture, every letter,
  every silence&mdash;you have been entirely perfect to me&mdash;I would not
  change one word, one look.</p>

  <p>My hope and aim are to preserve this love, not to fall from it&mdash;for
  which I trust to God who procured it for me, and doubtlessly can preserve
  it.</p>

  <p>Enough now, my dearest, dearest, own Ba! You have given me the highest,
  completest proof of love that ever one human being gave another. I am all
  gratitude&mdash;and all pride (under the proper feeling which ascribes pride
  to the right source) all pride that my life has been so crowned by you.</p>

  <p>God bless you prays your very own R.</p>

  <p>I will write to-morrow of course. Take every care of my life which is in
  that dearest little hand; try and be composed, my beloved.</p>

  <p>Remember to thank Wilson* for me.</p>

  <p class="lhdi">Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Robert Browning</p>

  <p>Sunday (Post-mark, September 14, 1846).</p>

  <p>MY OWN BELOVED, if ever you should have reason to complain of me in things
  voluntary and possible, all other women would have a right to tread me
  underfoot, I should be so vile and utterly unworthy. There is my answer to
  what you wrote yesterday of wishing to be better to me...you! What could be
  better than lifting me from the ground and carrying me into life and the
  sunshine? I was yours rather by right than by gift (yet by gift also, my
  beloved!); for what you have saved and renewed is surely yours. All that I
  am, I owe you&mdash;if I enjoy anything now and henceforth, it is through
  you. You know this well. Even as I, from the beginning, knew that I had no
  power against you...or that, if I had it was for your sake.</p>

  <p>Dearest, in the emotion and confusion of yesterday morning, there was yet
  room in me for one thought which was not a feeling&mdash;for I thought that,
  of the many, many women who have stood where I stood, and to the same end,
  not one of them all perhaps, not one perhaps, since that building was a
  church, has had reasons strong as mine, for an absolute trust and devotion
  towards the man she married,&mdash;not one! And then I both thought and felt,
  that it was only just, for them...those women who were less happy,...to have
  that affectionate sympathy and support and presence of their nearest
  relations, parent or sister...which failed to me,...needing it less through
  being happier!</p>

  <p>All my brothers have been here this morning, laughing and talking, and
  discussing this matter of the leaving town,&mdash;and in the room, at the
  same time, were two or three female friends of ours, from
  Herefordshire&mdash;and I did not dare to cry out against the noise, though
  my head seemed splitting in two (one-half for each shoulder), I had such a
  morbid fear of exciting a suspicion. Treppy too being one of them, I promised
  to go to see her tomorrow and dine in her drawing-room if she would give me,
  for dinner, some bread and butter. It was like having a sort of fever. And
  all in the midst, the bells began to ring. 'What bells are those?' asked one
  of the provincials. 'Marylebone Church bells,' said Henrietta, standing
  behind my chair.</p>

  <p>And now...while I write, having escaped from the great din, and sit here
  quietly,&mdash;comes...who do you think?&mdash;Mr. Kenyon.</p>

  <p>He came with his spectacles, looking as if his eyes reached to their rim
  all the way round; and one of the first words was, 'When did you see
  Browning?' And I think I shall make a pretension to presence of mind
  henceforward; for, though certainly I changed colour and he saw it, I yet
  answered with a tolerably quick evasion...He was here on Friday '&mdash;and
  leapt straight into another subject, and left him gazing fixedly on my face.
  Dearest, he saw something, but not all. So we talked, talked. He told me that
  the 'Fawn of Sertorius' (which I refused to cut open the other day) was
  ascribed to Landor and he told me that he meant to leave town again on
  Wednesday, and would see me once before then. On rising to go away, he
  mentioned your name a second time...'When do you see Browning again?' To
  which I answered that I did not know.</p>

  <p>Is not that pleasant? The worst is that all these combinations of things
  make me feel so bewildered that I cannot make the necessary arrangements, as
  far as the letters go. But I must break from the dream-stupor which falls on
  me when left to myself a little, and set about what remains to be done.</p>

  <p>A house near Watford is thought of now&mdash;but, as none is concluded on,
  the removal is not likely to take place in the middle of the week even,
  perhaps.</p>

  <p>I sit in a dream, when left to myself. I cannot believe, or understand.
  Oh! but in all this difficult, embarrassing and painful situation, I look
  over the palms to Troy&mdash;I feel happy and exulting to belong to you, past
  every opposition, out of sight of every will of man&mdash;none can put us
  asunder, now, at least. I have a right now openly to love you, and to hear
  other people call it a duty, when I do,...knowing that if it were a sin, it
  would be done equally. Ah&mdash;I shall not be first to leave off
  that&mdash;see if I shall! May God bless you, ever and ever dearest! Beseech
  for me the indulgence of your father and mother, and ask your sister to love
  me. I feel so as if I had slipped down over the wall into somebody's
  garden&mdash;I feel ashamed. To be grateful and affectionate to them all,
  while I live, is all that I can do, and it is too much a matter of course to
  need to be promised. Promise it however for your very own Ba whom you made so
  happy with the dear letter last night.</p>

  <p>But say in the next how you are&mdash;and how your mother is.</p>

  <p>I did hate so, to have to take off the ring! You will have to take the
  trouble of putting it on again, some day.</p>
