<p>Each person provided his own provisions and horses. Provisions
consisting of 80lbs flour, 22lbs pork, 16lbs sugar, and 3lbs
tea.</p>
<p>July 3 [1861], Wednesday, 11 a.m.&mdash;Started from Buckland.
At noon passed through Northam. 1 p.m., crossed Salt River without
accident. 5.30.&mdash;Camped 1 mile east from Coolyakine, being
11 miles east of Northam.</p>
<p>4th, Thursday, 9 a.m.&mdash;Start; course E by S; reached a
spot 16 miles from former camp.</p>
<p>5th, Friday, 8 a.m.&mdash;Start, steering east; crossed upper
branch of Salt River. Camped at a scrub hill. Distance to-day 25
miles.</p>
<p>6th.&mdash;This morning, horses looking empty, there being
nothing but scrub to eat, we shaped our course to a hill bearing
ESE, and reached a spring one mile south of it, where there was
sufficient good feed, distant 7 miles from last encampment. This
hill is called by the natives Dungeen&mdash;a good land mark,
being conical.</p>
<p>7th, Sunday.&mdash;Remained at Dungeen to recruit our horses.
Correll shot his second kangaroo.</p>
<p>8th, Monday, 8.30. a.m.&mdash;Start, steering E by S, to a
hill called by the natives Killaburing, passing through thickets,
forests, and sand plains&mdash;with patches of scrubby grass.
Camped at Killaburing, being 25 miles from Dungeen. Here we fell
in with three natives, one of whom being acquainted with the
surrounding country, offered to become our guide, which we
availed ourselves of.</p>
<p>9th, Tuesday, 10 a.m.&mdash;Left camp, steering E by N; passed
through a belt of forest, sighting two grassy hills, called
Jurien and Morocuben; crossed more forest, consisting of salmon
and fluted gum, intersected with strips of thicket; stopped at
Doodlakine, 12 miles distant from last camp. Here there is a
spring and about 2000 acres of tolerable grazing land.</p>
<p>10th, Wednesday, 10 a.m.&mdash;Start, steering ESE to a hill
called Darening, 15 miles from Doodlakine; passed through open
forests, tea-tree thickets, and the dry bed of a salt lake, about
10 miles in circumference. This we named Lake Hillman. We then
came upon a small water-course, which increased in size as we
proceeded, taking its course from Darening, where we rested for
the night.</p>
<p>11th, Thursday.&mdash;This morning our horses looking well, 10
a.m. started, steering E by N, over about ½ a mile of good feed,
a forest, where we saw box poison; then over a sand plain,
between two hills&mdash;small particles of grassy
land&mdash;being a continuance of the Darening feeding ground.
Came to a spring at the head of a water-course, which terminated
in a low flat, with forests and thickets. Here we remarked that
there was an immense quantity of fallen timber, nearly all of
which had been blown down by SE gales, when the ground had been
saturated with water, the soil being a light loamy sand. To-day
the natives pointed out a bush which they said had an edible
root, and called cookine; they dug one up and we pronounced it
good, but not over tempting. The plant resembles the branch of a
tea-tree, averaging about a foot in height. We saw a great number
of morel-trees here. Halted at a flat rock, with plenty of water
on it&mdash;a patch of indifferent feed on the southern side.
This place is called Cabrocubing, 16 miles distant from
Darening.</p>
<p>12th, Friday 8.45. a.m.&mdash;Left Cabrocubing, steering E by
N to a hill, which we named Mount Chidlow; passed through a
thicket by a native path; passed by a granite hill with a little
good feed round it&mdash;a spring on its southern side. This we
named Mount Sarah. Remarked that the trees were much spotted with
hail marks. Saw a great number of white gums to-day. Passed over
several hillocks with silver wattle, but very little grass.
Camped at Mount Chidlow, which is distant 16 miles from
Cabrocubing. It is a bare granite hill; good feed all round, with
a spring on the north side.</p>
<p>13th, Saturday. Mount Chidlow, 8.45. a.m.&mdash;Start; course
E by N, passing over scrubby plains and white gum forests.
Crossed a range of hillocks covered with scrub, trending north
and south. Trees still bearing marks of hail. Saw cypress trees
to-day. Last night heavy rains; to-day bitterly cold. Wind
westerly. Came to a large granite hill, with plenty of good feed
round it&mdash;a spring on east side, where we camped. This we
named Mount Mackintosh; distant from Mount Chidlow 16 miles. A
great number of ground blackboys here growing in large
clusters.</p>
<p>14th, Sunday. Mount Mackintosh, 7.45. a.m.&mdash;Cold frosty
weather. Started on an E by N course to a promising range in the
distance. Crossed low forests of the usual description. Passed
over a granite hill, with a spring on its eastern side, about 3
miles from last camp. A short distance from this came to a
well-made native hut, with a bundle of spears in it, but saw no
natives. Crossed through another forest, and came to a granite
bill, similar to last one. More morel-forest. Collected a few
lime stones. Another granite hill. One of those had two springs,
one spring coming out of a fissure in the rock on its west side,
the eastern being loose stones. Passed through more forests,
thickets, and coarse grass. Came to a large hill, divided by six
chasms, which we named Mount Mary, with plenty of water. Camped;
being 25 miles from Mount Mackintosh.</p>
<p>15th, Monday. Mount Mary.&mdash;Ascended this hill to examine
it and look round, but saw nothing in any direction worthy of
notice. On the top of one of these hills is a large hollow rock,
which would afford shelter in bad weather. Sharp frost this
morning. Found the horse Bob had a splinter in fetlock, which
delayed us some time. 10 a.m. started, steering ENE through an
unpromising country, consisting of malka thickets and stunted
jam-trees; soil, light red loamy sand; a few small water-courses
running into two flats. Camped at a hill named by us Mount
Jeanie, with a spring on its eastern side, distant from Mount
Mary 13 miles.</p>
<p>16th, Tuesday. Mount Jeanie.&mdash;Sharp frost, cold SE wind.
8.30., start on a NE course, passing over similar country to
yesterday. Observed grass of a new description in various sized
tufts, the bottom part being coarse and prickly, the top fine,
resembling rye grass; also saw several shrubs unknown to us, and
a remarkably handsome tree, resembling at a distance the mountain
ash, but with leaves very like those of the common blue creeper,
bearing clusters of seed-pods; stem about 2 feet diameter; height
of tree about 25 feet. Came to a high bare granite hill, which we
named Mount Hardey, where we camped, being 16 miles from Mount
Jeanie.</p>
<p>17th, Wednesday. Mount Hardey.&mdash;From the top of this hill
we had an extensive view; saw a chain of huge lakes, extending as
far as the eye could reach, for hills lying nearly east and west,
one of which was of great extent, the opposite shore appearing
dim and indistinct. There are three caves on the eastern side of
this mount, which we examined. Discovered a peculiar gum or
pitch, oozing out of the rock, having a disagreeable smell, with
the property of burning like pitch when held to a flame, and also
of dissolving in water. Left this place at 9 a.m., steering ENE,
skirting the southern bank of the lakes (which are numerous, some
small ones fresh, but principally salt, the salt lying on the
bottom and round the edges) for six miles; then struck off for a
broken range trending north and south. Soil much improved, being
of a red day, with frequent patches of good grass. These hills
are of trap formation (here we first observe the tracks of the
red kangaroo)&mdash;and a continuance of the chain of lakes,
narrow when confined by hills, and becoming broad sheets of water
where no hills exist; should say from ten to fifteen miles broad.
Kept our course ENE, and camped at a spot 20 miles from Mount
Hardey, without water; therefore named it Dry Camp. Soil good,
with patches of good grass. Here were caught a small animal
resembling, in size and shape an English rat, the colour only
differing, being grey. They make nests in the hollow trees with
sticks, stones, grass, &amp;c., of large size, in which they
store up large quantities of York and sandalwood nuts, &amp;c.
Here also we saw an animal of peculiar description, being
cloven-footed, ears long, colour grey, about the size of a half
grown rabbit; it bounds or jumps over the ground like a deer.</p>
<p>18th, Thursday. Dry Camp.&mdash;This morning, having no water
to make tea, started fasting, steering back west. Passed over and
along the shores of large lake of yesterday. Passed a dry brook
course, which had brought down much timber, branches, &amp;c.,
some considerable distance. Passed also two little islands close
to the edge of the lake. Examined them, one being fine slate, the
other quartz. Crossed the range of hills we were upon yesterday,
and which we named Georgiana Range, and several small lakes which
connect the large ones when full. Noon; still no fresh water.
Crossed over tolerable country till we arrived at a granite bill,
which we named Mount Harris, where there is a good spring on its
south side. Glad to get water again, having been nearly two days
without. There appears no sign of rain having fallen here for
four or five weeks. Distance returned to-day 20 miles.</p>
<p>19th, Friday, Mount Harris.&mdash;This hill, like most others
we have seen, is very uneven, forming basins, which hold water
after rain for some length of time. Here we found pieces of what
we considered coral. This morning our friendly guide, who joined
as at Killaburing, who is known as a great traveller by the name
of Ginguitch, gave us the slip, while collecting our horses. This
man gave us to understand that a long time ago his friend
Boodgin, who is also a rambler, related to him that three white
men, with horses, had come to some large body of salt water a
long way to the eastward, and after travelling some time along
the shore, they turned back again, when they were either killed
by the Jimbars, which they describe, or perished from want of
water. He believes their bones still remain there. 8.45. a.m.,
started, steering ENE to a continuation of the Georgina Range.
After crossing a large quantity of good feed, several good grassy
hills, and a small brook course running north, we ascended the
highest part of the range, from which we observed several large
ranges of hills in the distance. Continued our course over a
clear belt of ground, and encamped for the night at a clay hole,
containing sufficient water, with abundance of good grass all
round us. We passed through more good country this day than any
other since we left Northam. Saw many tracks of natives, dogs,
emu, &amp;c. Distance to-day 9 miles.</p>
<p>July 20th, Saturday. Clay Hole.&mdash;This morning two of the
party proceeded due north 14 miles to a hill seen yesterday.
Found that the good feed did not extend more than a mile from
encampment. At the end of Georgiana Range the country becomes
nothing but morel forests, and thickets, the ground covered with
small round ironstone, several patches of clay soil intervening.
The hill was ascended with much difficulty, the sides being
steep, rough, and many loose stones. From the top got a good view
to Northward and Eastward; saw another large chain of lakes
trending N and South and apparently running in the direction of
those we saw before. These we named Hamersley's Lakes. The hill
on which we stood we named Mount Correll; got back to camp at 4
p.m. To-day Correll endeavoured to shoot a red kangaroo but did
not succeed.</p>
<p>21st, Sunday. Clay Hole, 9 a.m.&mdash;Start on an ENE course
to a large hill seen yesterday.</p>
<p>The good feed on this course continued only about a mile,
after which nothing but thickets and forests, with the coarse
prickly grass already alluded to. Came to thickets of a different
kind, which we consider a species of Casuarina, from which exudes
a beautiful transparent gum, very sweet to taste. 5 p.m. encamped
on a spot 25 miles from Clay Hole, with a little feed, which we
were afraid to leave, but no water. Named this Rock Camp.</p>
<p>22nd, Monday, 7 a.m.&mdash;Started, steering E by S for the
lakes, passing through forests and thickets for 7 miles. Followed
up several small brooks looking for water; at length found what
we required, so much&mdash;drank and halted. Then proceeded along
the banks of a lake, to where we considered a good crossing
place, but on trying, found it would not do; two of the party
riding in about forty yards, suddenly sunk to the horses' girths
in mud, and had some difficulty in getting them out. Proceeded
along the shore in search of better feed, but without success,
and were compelled to return to our last watering place, 8 miles
from last camp.</p>
<p>23rd, Tuesday&mdash;Camp by lake.&mdash;Here we caught several
of the nest-building rats&mdash;one mother and; two young ones,
one of which was hanging to the teat, of which there were four,
but no pouch. 8.45. a.m., started, steering ENE for large hills
seen in that direction from Georgiana Range; skirted the lakes
for some distance and crossed through an open forest. Came to a
granite hill, with a little feed but no water. Passed through
thickets with sweet gum exuding, over a sand plain, and another
thicket. Here we collected several, botanical specimens which
were carefully preserved, in order to be forwarded to Mr
Drummond. On coming out from a thicket providentially we came on
a clay hole, where we watered the horses and selves. As there was
but little feed here, proceeded on our course,&mdash;preferring
to go without water ourselves to allowing our horses to get
hungry.</p>
<p>Soil here red clay and ironstone gravel, with open white gum
forest for two miles. Encamped about a mile from the largest hill
we had yet seen, which we named Mount Kennedy. No water here,
patches of good green grass, the most forward we had seen. Had a
long journey to-day&mdash;30 miles.</p>
<p>24th, Wednesday, 6 a.m.&mdash;Hard frost and bitterly cold.
Three of as proceeded to last water hole to breakfast, and bring
water for the other two, who remained at the camp. Found the
water frozen over. There has been a heavy hail storm here lately,
the trees being much cut up&mdash;bark bruised as if it had been
shot at. Here the grass is growing luxuriantly, where the ground
receive the drainage of the forests, as there are no watercourses
to carry the rain off. We concluded, from the appearance of this
tract of country, that the rain must fall very irregularly.
Stopped here to rest the horses and examined the hill. Leaving
our horses, walked to the hill, ascended it with much difficulty,
the stones rolling from under our feet, but at length reached the
top, when we had a very extensive view all round. This range runs
nearly east and west. To NE of this is another group of hills,
about 10 miles which we named Mount Barker. Some ten miles beyond
the last mentioned is another range of considerable length. To
North ward two groups of hills of similar description; to
eastward a low flat country, with only a few small hills
occasionally. Mount Kennedy is a mass of beautifully stratified
flint, principally dark red, and various colours. Found several
specimens of black shining ore, unknown to us. We observed a
great many native fires all round us in the distance, as if the
natives were collecting for some particular occasion. Here we
could perceive nothing in the appearance of the surrounding
country to induce us to proceed any further in this direction,
and therefore deter mined on changing our course to the
Southward. According to our reckoning this mount is in latitude
30 deg. 58 min. S. longitude 121 deg. 16 min. E.</p>
<p>25th, Thursday. Mount Kennedy.&mdash;The horses having rambled
some distance, took us some time to collect them. 9 a.m., start
again, steering SSW towards a range seen in that direction.
Travelled through sweet gum tree thickets and forests. Came to a
red clay flat of great extent, with several holes containing some
water, with plenty of grass in patches. Concluded on remaining on
this good spot on account of our horses. We named this place
Clarkson's Flat, which is distant from Mount Kennedy 14 miles.
This locality is, like most of the surrounding, strewed with the
white-leaved salt plant, such as grow round the edge of the
Rottnest Lakes.</p>
<p>26th, Friday. Clarkson's Flats&mdash;Hard frosts water holes
frozen. 9 am. got all ready to start, when it was discovered one
of the party had lost his revolver; tracked backwards and
forwards till it was found, which delayed us till past noon, when
we started, steering SSW, as yesterday. Passed a spring at the
head of a water-course; made the head of the lakes, and after a
second attempt, succeeded in crossing. Here we found the banks to
be of slate formation; under-foot and under the bed of the lake,
indeed all round, slate was to be seen in hillocks and banks. We
then ascended the hill we had been steering for yesterday and
to-day, and found it much the same as the Georgiana range This we
named the Barlee Range, and is from 15 to 20 miles in length,
being divided about the middle, leaving a space of some half
mile, which forms a communication between the lakes. Crossed the
range and camped in a thicket, with grass but no water. Distance
to-day 14 miles from last camp.</p>
<p>27th, Saturday. Barlee Range.&mdash;7.45. a.m. started, course
south. Three miles brought us to a small lake of very indifferent
water; watered our horses and made tea, (having taken our damper
before starting); proceeded on our course, travelling through a
forest. Skirted the lake for five miles, crossed over low marshy
ground and dry lakes; saw here mountain ducks, but did not
succeed in shooting any. Came to a patch of good grass, but no
water, 15 miles south from last camp.</p>
<p>28th, Sunday. Dry Camp, a.m.&mdash;Hard frost&mdash;very cold.
The horses having rambled in search of water a considerable
distance detained us. 9th, a.m. started, steering SE; skirted a
large lake, which we named Lake Grace. Continued our course
through forest and patches of grass occasionally; came to large
plains covered with scrub, over which we travelled till sundown,
when we returned to the last grass we had seen (there being none
on the plains) about 3 miles, where we encamped for the night.
The country travelled over to-day being dry and dusty, caused
much thirst to ourselves and horses. Distance 20 miles from last
camp, making 26 miles travelled.</p>
<p>July 29th, Monday. Dry Camp.&mdash;This morning the horses
looked much cut up for want of water, which prevented us
proceeding any further east ward, so reluctantly made up our
minds to return to our watering place of Saturday. 7.30 a.m.
Start, steering back for some distance, went to eastern side of
Lake Grace, and followed it until we came to a clay swamp, thinly
covered with muddy water; several small lakes around as,
separated by banks of whitish powder resembling flour. Here we
stopped to refresh our horses, they being much jaded. Distance
from last camp 10 miles, having made a NNW course. Saw fresh
tracks of three natives, apparently a man, woman and child. We
had seen their fire previously.</p>
<p>30th, Tuesday. Lake Grace.&mdash;This morning thought it
advisable to give the horses most jaded a rest, so took two of
the least knocked up and went out ENE 15 miles and back to camp..
This course took us to about 5 miles from eastern end of Barlee
Range. Saw a large lake, which we named Lake Deborah. Patches of
good grass, forests, and bare ground throughout this journey.
Returned to camp at 5 p.m. Lake Deborah is similar to the others,
and, like them, nearly connected with the others; would say that
two feet of water would throw the whole body of lakes into one,
which would cover the whole of the surrounding low country. We
have traced these lakes for sixty miles, seeing a continuation of
them from the most easterly hills as far as the eye could reach.
The soil around the lakes is principally red loamy sand, with
patches of red clay, part of which is covered with patches of
high grass, green in places, but the greatest portion of it
completely bare, with occasional patches of forests and
thickets.</p>
<p>31st, Wednesday. Lake Grace&mdash;Very hard frost&mdash;our
muddy little lake is frozen over. 8.45., started, steering SSW
for 3 miles; then crossed the lake, steered west. At noon came
upon a party of natives, who were much afraid of us; one of the
men we found had been to Mr Smith's sheep station, and had been
ordered away from the water. This fellow saluted one of our
party, who rode up to him with "Be op Poleetman," the others
having run off, but seeing Correll with the rest of our party,
and being made to understand no harm was intended, he became
pacified, and called back the others, who came up. The party
consisted of 3 men, 2 women, and 3 children, one a very old man.
4 p.m. camped on the bank of a lake, which we named lake Julia,
having made 10 miles W by S from our last camp. Plenty of grass
and a good spring. The old man became very familiar. They were
perfectly naked, of a singular build, being (when standing
upright with feet close, and arms down,) the form of a wedge,
from the shoulders downwards. These poor wretches, having no sort
of covering, make their bed by first lighting a fire on it, and
when sufficiently heated, divide the fire; then loosen the heated
earth or sand, and mix it to a proper degree of temperature; then
lie down between the two fires. They, at all times carry
firesticks, before them. All appear to have been much burnt,
having many scars on their bodies. They live principally on small
animals which are very numerous. This tract of country receives
as much rain during the summer months as in the winter and is at
all times attended with thunder and lightning, and hail, such is
the natives account. The men were asked by Correll if they had
ever heard of white men being in the far east. They said they
had, that many years ago three white men had perished at some
large inland sea or lake, they supposed from want of water. This
confirmed what the former native had said relative to these three
men, and they also named the great traveller Boodgin, as having
more knowledge on this subject than themselves. This man,
Boodgin, had done something or other for which is friends were
going to spear him, he was, therefore absent, which was much to
be regretted.</p>
<p>August 1, Thursday.&mdash;This morning, on further
conversation, these men gave as an account of some strange animal
they call Jungra and Jimbra, male and female, which they describe
as a large strong animal of the monkey tribe, very fierce, and
will attack men when single, kill them and eat them. They were
asked if the Jimba or Jungra in any way resembled Ginka or devil,
they replied that the devil was never seen, but that the others
were both seen and felt by some of them. Sent Correll with the
two young men to shoot a red kangaroo if possible, all of us
being desirous of seeing one; but he returned unsuccessful. 1
p.m., started from this place, steering WSW to a place called
Codgering, where the natives said there was feed and water for
our horses. Passed through forests and thickets. Crossed southern
end of Georgiana Range; distant from Lake Julia 15 miles. Here
camped. Codgering is a nice little halting place, with plenty of
water and good feed. We were much amused with the old native, who
appears very fond of his children, and friendly to us.</p>
<p>2nd, Friday. Codgering, 8.40. a.m.&mdash;Started; course WSW,
passing through scrubby plains, forests, and thickets. Saw a
hillock composed of quartz. Several bills to S and E. Came to a
granite hill, with several springs and good feed. Camped for the
night. This place we called Simon's Springs, native name
Gnaberding. Distant 15 miles from Codgering.</p>
<p>3rd, Saturday. Simon's Springs.&mdash;Started this morning,
steering WSW to a place called by the natives Dullyaling. Parted
with the old man, women, and children; keeping the two men to act
as guides to water. Passed through similar country as before
described. Came to a hill with a spring on its eastern side,
which we named Mount Lionel. Tolerable feed round. Saw several of
the same description. Came to Dullyaling and camped; being 16
miles from last camp. This hill we named Mount Milley.</p>
<p>4th, Sunday. Mount Milley.&mdash;Remained here to recruit
horses. The rocks and hills around us are of the same kind as
before described, being very irregular and rugged. The northern
side of Mount Milley is about 80 feet high, 60 of which is a
perpendicular bluff rock.</p>
<p>5th, Monday. Mount Milley, 8 a.m.&mdash;Start; steering WSW,
through scrub plains, thickets, and forests, a patch of tolerable
feed, a spring, and granite rocks. Camped on west side of a hill
by a small brook with plenty of water and tolerable feed. Native
name of hill Noombinsburn, which we named Mount Roach. Distance
to-day 25 miles WSW.</p>
<p>6th, Tuesday. Mount Roach, 8.30. a.m.&mdash;Start for a hill
in the distance, bearing SSW. Similar country to yesterday. Came
up to the hill; when dark camped by a small brook leading from
the hill. Distance from Mount Roach 25 miles.</p>
<p>7th, Wednesday. Granite hill.&mdash;Much rain fell during the
night; wind NW. 8 a.m. started; steering W by S. Saw kangaroo,
the first seen since leaving Darening. Passed several granite
hills on both sides; large rocks in every direction. Arrived at a
hill surrounded by blackboys, the first seen since leaving the
settled districts. Camped here; distant from last camp 25 miles.
The black boys here are very diminutive and much cut up by the
natives, who come here from the eastward for gum, they having no
gum answering the same purpose. This hill is called by the
natives Borolokine&mdash;having a spring on its southern
side.</p>
<p>8th, Thursday. Borolokine.&mdash;This place derives its name
from the blackboy Bora or Boro. Heavy rains during the night and
this morning; wind NW. 8.45. start; course NW through forests,

Doondering, with about 1000 acres of tolerable feed round it.
Here camped for the night.</p>
<p>9th, Friday. Doondering.&mdash;Two of the party start this
morning steering SSW, leaving pack-horses and the others to
recruit. Having travelled SSW for 18 miles, came to a range of
hills seen from camp. Saw about 2000 acres of good feeding
country. Kangaroo in great numbers. Camped at eastern end of the
hill, which we named Dambeen.</p>

miles round, from the highest places, could see nothing but
scrubby hills and plains. Returned to former camp.</p>
<p>11th, Sunday. Dambeen.&mdash;Started back to Doondering,
course NNE; got in by 2 p.m. Having travelled at a quick pace. We
have been left by our native guides, one under pretence of being
lame; the other stealing away; the fact being they were off their
beat, and were afraid of strange natives. Here other natives
joined us.</p>

Yarabine brook, through a gum forest, with much box poison to be
seen. Camped at the same spot as going out.</p>
<p>17th, Saturday. Darening.&mdash;Started at 9 a.m., steering W
by S. Passed more open country than on going out, keeping more to
