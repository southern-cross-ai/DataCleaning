  <h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

  <p class="note">The crime was commonplace, save in the person murdered, but
  it was supposed that there might be some tale behind it, but those who might
  have spoken kept silence. "All life," the old play has it, "is but a
  wandering to find home, and when we're gone we're there." This was quoted by
  the philosophers who noted this affair for (said they) "there was no way home
  but this for the victim of this midnight violence."<br>

  <h2>PART I</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>§ 1</h2>

  <p class="first">THE TRAVELLER readily obtained lodgings for the night. The landlord asked
  to see his passport, which was British, in order, made out to Henry Campion,
  and stamped with the visas of the Duchies of Bavaria and Wurtemberg. He was a
  heavy, middle-aged man, wearing a light coat with capes, and he had come
  without a servant, in a small open carriage.</p>

  <p>The Drei Mohren was the post house, and Mr. Campion paid his dues for
  hire and toll and ordered the carriage for the morning.</p>

  <p>"It would be prudent, sir," suggested the host, civilly, "to engage a
  courier. The roads are well enough kept in Bavaria, and even through the
  Forest, but the confusions left by the late wars&mdash;" The Englishman put
  this advice aside with a quick movement of his gloved hand, as if it were
  matter he had heard often enough before, but Herr Kugler persisted in what he
  considered an essential warning.</p>

  <p>"There have been accidents, disappearances; you must understand, sir, that
  whole tracts of the country are ruined."</p>

  <p>"And you, that I am pressed for time; that I have an object, one object
  only, and that I conduct my affairs in my own way."</p>

  <p>Herr Kugler bowed respectfully. No one travelling without a servant, and
  not speaking German, had stayed at his post house before. He continued,
  speaking English, he spoke a little of several languages, to impress on the
  traveller the dangers of a solitary journey, especially across the frontier,
  in Wurtemberg.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied Mr. Campion abruptly. "You see, I am trying to
  find some one. I shall stay in Stuttgart, I suppose."</p>

  <p>This remark caused the host some dismay.</p>

  <p>"Ah, sir, you must realize! To be lost in Europe now is so
  easy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, so I have understood. But perhaps you can help me."</p>

  <p>They stood in the empty, public parlour that was of the superior sort. The
  ancient house had been a nobleman's residence when the ancient city had been
  a free member of the Empire. Candles had been lit on the oak table; the
  windows stood open on the hot summer night and the lime trees in the
  square.</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir." The landlord had seen letters from His Britannic
  Majesty's residents at Stuttgart and Munich with the passport Mr. Campion had
  shown. "But how strange if I could assist you! If you will, however, tell me
  the story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion's face became cruel. Herr Kugler swiftly felt that cruelty in
  the handsome, dark countenance, and the suffering of self inflicted torment.
  The traveller sat down carefully and drew off his gloves slowly, finger by
  finger.</p>

  <p>"A rash and foolish person," he said, "decided to travel to
  Italy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Italy!" exclaimed the landlord with relief. "Then you have a long way to
  go&mdash;Vienna to Venice&mdash;perhaps."</p>

  <p>"You interrupt. Yes, I have a long way to go. This person, I have reason
  to believe, left Italy and Austria and came to Germany. It is true," he added
  with fierce weariness, "that I have followed many false clues."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible that I should help you," said Herr Kugler firmly. "No
  one is here&mdash;has been here&mdash;save they who are accounted for."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. Who is here now?"</p>

  <p>This accent of authority frightened the landlord. His own secret and that
  of the stranger alike alarmed him. He wished now that he had said that the
  Drei Mohren was full, but he had thought it wiser to keep this formidable
  stranger under his close scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"A lady occupies the first floor, sir. She has been resting here some
  days."</p>

  <p>"A lady alone?"</p>

  <p>"With a chamber woman, it is understood."</p>

  <p>"Who is she, travelling now, unescorted, when, as you warn me, even the
  highways are dangerous? Dinkelsbuhl is an out of the way place for a lady to
  repose."</p>

  <p>"It is Madame Daun, a most respectable widow. She travels from Stuttgart
  to Nuremberg on family matters&mdash;the selling of some property belonging
  to her late husband. She was indisposed on the way and rested here."</p>

  <p>"A lady alone&mdash;she had no male companion?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall see her, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"She keeps her chamber, sir, having a slight swelling of the throat."</p>

  <p>"The maid, then?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, are you of the Duke's police, or some courier of some foreign power
  that you make so many demands?" asked the host with dignity.</p>

  <p>"I have power behind me. My errand is lawful. The Courts of Wurtemberg and
  Bavaria would support me."</p>

  <p>"Then, sir, please be plain with me. Have you any business with Madame
  Daun, who is a most insignificant person whose papers are correct, above
  suspicion?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think so," replied the Englishman. His fatigue seemed to
  increase suddenly and lie over him like a leaden cloak.</p>

  <p>"Tell me one detail. What colour is this lady's hair?"</p>

  <p>The landlord was astonished out of his carefully maintained composure.</p>

  <p>"Madame Daun's hair, sir! It is the colour of that of most women in this
  country&mdash;pale brown&mdash;and over the temples, a little greyness."</p>

  <p>"Send up my supper," ordered Mr. Campion abruptly, "to my chamber. I shall
  be gone early in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Your luggage has been taken up. The room is spacious&mdash;on the second
  floor. Shall I conduct you there?" Relieved, but anxious not to show this,
  the landlord spoke with deference, as if wholly absorbed in his guest's
  comfort.</p>

  <p>"No. I shall stay here awhile." The Englishman rose and went to the open
  window. The landlord withdrew, closing the door carefully on the unwelcome
  stranger who took no further notice of his surroundings.</p>

  <p>The limes were in full bloom. The clusters of greenish-yellow flowers were
  visible in the light from the lamp in the square that fell faintly among the
  thick leaves.</p>

  <p>The traveller suffered an intolerable loneliness, a bitter distaste for
  life. He was strong willed, determined, obstinate and inspired by a
  remorseless passion, but he was also fatigued by many disappointments, by a
  sense of futility and frustration.</p>

  <p>The old city was like a prison. He had felt that as soon as he had driven
  into the gates that morning. He had disliked the Gothic pinnacles and towers
  of the churches, the medieval gables of the houses, the cobbled streets, even
  the stocking weavers going home from the work shops. It was all alien. He
  knew Europe only as battle fields. He had studied it only from military maps.
  He was now weary, with a deadly weariness, of road charts, bills of exchange,
  visas, frontier delays and questioning, arrivals and departures at inns and
  post houses, always alone, always among foreigners. If he heard of the
  whereabouts of any fellow countrymen he had to avoid them, for he travelled
  under a false name and on an errand that he could not reveal.</p>

  <p>Herr Kugler was not the first to warn him of the perils of travelling
  without a servant. But his work was not to be shared, but something to be
  hidden from casual curiosity. Though wealthy and, therefore, used to
  excellent service, he made his solitary journeys with a fortitude not shaken,
  even now in the moment of gloom.</p>

  <p>"It is only weariness," he whispered, for lately he had begun to talk to
  himself, though in the lowest of tones and when solitary. He was studious to
  keep a grave, aloof and taciturn manner when there was the slightest chance
  of his being observed. "Yes, and not yet&mdash;not even yet&mdash;being able
  to realize my misfortunes. My actions sometimes seem to me automatic. Still,
  it is not hopeless. Several times I have been nearly successful."</p>

  <p>He glanced over his shoulder at the candle-lit parlour. "How many such
  rooms have I not stayed in for a day, a night, an hour&mdash;and how I detest
  all of them."</p>

  <p>His dark features were pinched by suffering as he struggled to keep from
  his inner vision the images of the places where he had been happy. The boughs
  of the lime trees, gently stirred by the warm breeze before the window,
  appeared to him like walls. He picked up his beaver and gloves, still, amid
  his torment, a man of precise habits, and left the Drei Mohren. Once clear of
  the lime trees he turned to look at his last halting place.</p>

  <p>It was a dignified mansion that had been refronted in a style of a hundred
  years ago. A façade of classic simplicity concealed the old irregular rooms,
  crooked passages and twisting stairs. A portico had been built over the large
  doorway, and the windows were set straightly. The shutters were not yet
  closed, and the traveller saw the gleam of the candles in the parlour he had
  just left. The windows of the first floor, the apartments of Madame Daun,
  were all lit. Their muslin curtains stirred to show the sparkles of a
  cut-glass chandelier, plain white walls and some pieces of austere furniture
  of Roman design. This glimpse into the pale chamber, so different from the
  dark, closed and miserable gabled buildings either side the inn, was like a
  glance into a theatre where the actors have not yet entered.</p>

  <p>"Where did I make the mistake&mdash;or mistakes?" the Englishman
  whispered, staring up into the bright empty room. "Where did I take the wrong
  road, to the wrong city?"</p>

  <p>He turned slowly across the public place. Songs were coming from the beer
  cellars as the flap doors opened and fell. The stranger was shut out of
  everything save his own narrow and terrible purpose.</p>

  <p>He eased his stiff collar and passed his handkerchief over his face. There
  was no moon and the stars throbbed through a golden haze. The perfume of the
  lime blossoms was over sweet. He thought of water meadows, willow trees and
  smooth plots of grass sloping to the quiet river's edge, and knew they were
  nevermore to be his to enjoy. Slowly, several times losing his way in the
  twisting streets, he came out on the old fortifications and paced there, like
  a sentinel.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>§ 2</h2>

  <p class="first">Herr Kugler went slowly upstairs and knocked on the door of Madame Daun's
  apartment. The elderly maid opened it and he asked if he might see the
  lady.</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;" the woman began a formal, a reproachful sentence, but
  the host silenced her by raising a heavy hand. "This is important and
  unexpected."</p>

  <p>"About the police, the visas, the passports?" came the sharp query.</p>

  <p>"Official business, yes."</p>

  <p>The woman admitted him. The room was altered since he had let this suite,
  some weeks before, to Madame Daun. Shawls of pale yellow and white silk were
  draped over the chairs; a chased silver coffee service was set on a side
  table, some fine Persian mats were laid on the shining floor, a Venetian
  mirror surrounded by glass flowers scattered with gold flecks had been hung
  on the white wall. Majolica bowls of early flowers, pinks, roses, hyacinths,
  were set by the long horse hair couch of classic shape that Madame Daun had
  softened by cushions of blue, purple and pink embroideries.</p>

  <p>She came from the inner door as the host entered, and seated herself on
  this couch. She wore a pale grey pelisse, and her head was swathed in white
  muslin, too thick for a veil and through which she could scarcely see.</p>

  <p>"What did you say, what is it?" she asked in English. In that tongue the
  man replied, after the maid had withdrawn to the inner room.</p>

  <p>"The most unexpected, the most vexatious incident," murmured the host,
  looking awkwardly on the ground, as if overwhelmed, not only by the lady's
  presence, but by the air of elegance she had given his severe room. "A
  traveller has arrived."</p>

  <p>She interrupted nervously: "Is not that usual? There have been several
  travellers staying here since I came."</p>

  <p>"But this gentleman, I regret he has made inquiries about you,
  Madame."</p>

  <p>"Surely you misunderstood!" She sat upright, alert and speaking
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"I express myself with difficulty. Directly, not about your ladyship, no,
  Madame, but he inquired if there was a lady staying here. He is searching for
  someone."</p>

  <p>"He is French?"</p>

  <p>"English&mdash;but it is understood that all manner of spies might be
  employed?"</p>

  <p>"You know that I am French, though I speak English with you since you
  understand that better than my own language," murmured Madame Daun. "Yet, an
  English spy&mdash;it is possible. What did he ask?"</p>

  <p>"The colour of your hair, Madame."</p>

  <p>She was silent and put up a trembling hand to draw the muslin closer round
  her head.</p>

  <p>"I replied, 'light brown, with a greyness on the temples,' pardon me, that
  was to give the impression of a middle-aged lady, instead of one so young.
  For the rest, I told the tale as you bade me."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I do not think that this stranger can concern me, but I shall
  remain close until he leaves. When is that?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning, early."</p>

  <p>"Why then, it was hardly needful to tell me this!"</p>

  <p>Herr Kugler hesitated painfully.</p>

  <p>"My poor house&mdash;hardly suitable&mdash;the wiser action would be to
  ask our Duke for advice&mdash;I hardly expected the honour for so long."</p>

  <p>"The Duke of Bavaria, as I told you, knows my circumstances&mdash;he
  considered that my privacy was assured here, while I negotiated the purchase
  of a secluded residence."</p>

  <p>"I have been honoured by your confidence."</p>

  <p>"The Duke will not forget your kindness," said the lady, softly. "As for
  the stranger, you are over anxious, for which I commend you. In a few hours
  he will have departed."</p>

  <p>The words were spoken in a tone of gentle dismissal, yet the host stood
  his ground, though awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are tired of my presence?" she added, loosening the muslin
  from her face.</p>

  <p>"It is a responsibility, Madame," he admitted reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I trusted you," she reminded him. "I await important letters. You alone
  know my secret. Even my chamber woman, Adriana, does not guess as much as I
  have told you. Soon I shall dismiss her and engage another stranger. You
  realize the life I lead, so lonely, so perilous." She untwisted the muslin
  from her head. He shifted his position uneasily, but he was obliged, by the
  fascination she had for him, to look at the face she had revealed. This was a
  countenance of dignity and delicacy, with an exquisitely arched nose, a full
  under lip and pale eyes under sweeping brows. Her loosely curled hair was
  hazel coloured and whitened by powder on the temples. Herr Kugler knew that
  he could not resist that sparkling, prominent glance. He murmured: "Your
  ladyship must stay as long as you desire."</p>

  <p>"I shall not be here for many days more." She offered him her entrancing
  smile where pride was mingled with gratitude. "My <i>valet de place</i>,
  Martin, has paid you all I owe?"</p>

  <p>"Most scrupulously, Madame." Overcoming his nervousness by an effort of
  will, Herr Kugler added: "This Herr Martin, he is other than he seems?"</p>

  <p>"He is my faithful servant."</p>

  <p>"I understand&mdash;but his quality? If I might be trusted even
  further?"</p>

  <p>"Martin is no more than my faithful servant. His devotion, as you must
  have observed, makes my existence possible. He, and his family, have always
  been in the service of my family."</p>

  <p>The lady's tone was cold. Herr Kugler bowed and withdrew. He was not
  satisfied. As he descended the stairs slowly, with heavy head, he regretted
  the bias, the romantic temperament, the love of flattery, the awe of the
  reigning Duke, that had led him into the present situation. He did not doubt
  at least the main part of the sweet lady's tale; there had been the letter
  from His Highness, the prayer book with the illustrious signature, the
  marker, the pencil sketch; a hundred little incidents, all confirming the
  high flown, the impossible story. Above all there had been the lady's face.
  He had recognized the likeness at once. Yet some of the details of her case
  were vexatious. Martin, though he slept over the stables, seemed no ordinary
  servant and was very much in the confidence of his mistress, even to the
  handling of her money affairs. Certainly he was most respectful, most
  discreet, never over-stepping his place, but Herr Kugler, son of an innkeeper
  and himself in that business all his life, thought that he knew human beings
  pretty well, and he was dubious about Martin. Yet he could not offer himself
  any theory that might explain the servant.</p>

  <p>As for the lady, if she was not who she hinted she was, who was she? Herr
  Kugler's instinct refused to connect her with anything discreditable;
  besides, she was gaining nothing by her life of a recluse at the Drei Mohren,
  and every week Martin paid her expenses, without questioning the accounts, in
  golden <i>carolin.</i> It had occurred to the innkeeper that the lady might
  be afflicted by a derangement in her wits, but against that was her command
  of money, her sober behaviour, and the facts that the letter from the Duke
  had demanded special service and protection for her, and that there had been
  no hue and cry after her, unless indeed, the Englishman?</p>

  <p>But no, that was clearly a coincidence. There were so many missing people,
  of all nationalities, in Europe now, and so many, doubtless, searching for
  them. And the Englishman, this Mr. Campion, had obviously not been pursuing a
  woman with light brown hair, even though the landlord had misled him about
  the lady's age, there he had not been deceived. "Yet I shall be relieved,"
  reflected Herr Kugler, "when all of them have left Dinkelsbuhl."</p>

  <p>A widower, he had no anxious woman in whom to confide his doubts and he
  regretted his faithful Louise. The servants had all accepted the "Madame
  Daun" story, but he believed he had caught them whispering and
  staring&mdash;furtively, of course&mdash;and he did not want them to suspect
  anything.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>§ 3</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Campion came back to the inn late that evening. He was surprised to
  see the small glow of a pipe under the linden trees; a man must be standing
  there, at ease.</p>

  <p>"Are you staying at the Drei Mohren?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>The other, a dark figure with his hat pulled over his eyes, barely
  discernible in the shadows, muttered an apology in French, and disappeared in
  the darkness beyond the faint light of the public lamp.</p>

  <p>The Englishman entered the hotel. Herr Kugler, as if waiting for him, was
  in the doorway of the public parlour.</p>

  <p>"Who was that man under the trees outside?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir, indeed."</p>

  <p>"A tall fellow, he spoke in French."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is Madame Daun's servant, he uses French as a polite language,
  as having been much in Paris, but he is, like Madame herself, an
  Austrian."</p>

  <p>"You permit lackeys to lounge in front of the hotel, smoking?"</p>

  <p>"It is understood," replied Herr Kugler uncomfortably, "that a certain
  liberty&mdash;a trusted <i>valet de place</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is little concern of mine," interrupted Mr. Campion, brusquely, "but I
  should not long reside in an establishment where such poor manners are
  permitted."</p>

  <p>Herr Kugler suffered the rebuke in silence. His desire that the secretive
  lady should depart became stronger; romantic, even enthusiastic as he might
  be, his livelihood was with sober, every-day folk.</p>

  <p>"I brushed against the fellow," said Mr. Campion haughtily, as he went
  upstairs. Outside the tall, classical door that led to Madame Daun's
  apartments he paused, then shrugged his shoulders, as if despising himself,
  and proceeded to the chamber allotted to him on the second floor.</p>

  <p>Here, after Mr. Campion had finished his excellent supper, Herr Kugler
  presented himself, to the Englishman's annoyance.</p>

  <p>"You want your account settled?" he asked, stiffly.</p>

  <p>"No, your lordship mistakes the character of my house," replied Herr
  Kugler reproachfully. "I intrude on the affair of Madame Daun. I am a little
  troubled there. I thought it wiser to confide in your honour as a gentleman,
  than to make any secrecy."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, and what affair is this of mine?"</p>

  <p>"I understand the rebuke, sir. Please understand my difficulty. I have
  been made the recipient of a secret&mdash;a sad secret."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion seemed still to find this talk pompous, even impertinent.</p>

  <p>"Then what right have you to chatter to me?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Because I feel sure you are suspicious&mdash;perhaps in trouble yourself,
  sir," replied the innkeeper with desperate boldness, "and because I
  <i>know</i> this lady is not the person you look for. She has royal
  connections, need I say more?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand at all."</p>

  <p>"An exile, sir, a fugitive from scenes of the utmost
  horror&mdash;bereaved, shocked, ill, in disguise and seclusion."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion eyed the talkative foreigner with indifference.</p>

  <p>"This is no affair of mine, and you waste your trouble. I am searching for
  <i>two</i> people. A lady travelling alone is of no interest to me."</p>

  <p>Herr Kugler bowed.</p>

  <p>"I have my good name to think of. It could not be my wish for you to have
  any doubts as to guests of mine. I saw a letter from the Duke offering them
  protection&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, indeed she is no one whom I seek," interrupted Mr. Campion,
  contemptuously. "What have I to do with such?" His grey eyes shot a glance so
  cold and sulky at Herr Kugler that the innkeeper became precise and civilly
  remarked that the light carriage would be ready soon after breakfast on the
  following morning.</p>

  <p>Left to himself, the Englishman paced the waxed boards, up and down before
  the handsome tester bed with the white, rose sprigged curtains, before the
  side table on which he had set out his travelling toilet case, on which stood
  the candles in brass sticks, before the window that gave on the topmost
  leaves of the linden trees, outlined, amber yellow, against the glow of the
  street lamp.</p>

  <p>Without his cumbersome coat he showed as a fine man, tall and heavily
  built, with a broad chest, thick neck, and blunt features. His curly, dark
  brown hair was cut short and close whiskers accentuated his prominent cheek
  bones. His bearing was stiff and aristocratic; he had no gestures and few
  intonations in his speech. When he sighed, which was not infrequently, gusts
  of passion seemed to tear his breast.</p>

  <p>At length his restlessness expended itself in the action that had become a
  nightly ritual with him. He paused by the candle light, seated himself,
  indifferently, on the dressing stool and drew from the inner pocket of his
  coat a crimson velvet case, worn by continual fingering and rubbing. He
  touched the spring and gazed, with a grim intensity of emotion, at a
  miniature that showed a young woman with two small children gathered
  affectionately in her arms. She wore a wide-brimmed Leghorn hat, with black
  ribbons, that shadowed her face, and a white muslin morning gown. The boy's
  blue coat contrasted prettily with the rose-coloured sash of his younger
  sister. It was a delicate and attractive, if slightly insipid, portrayal of a
  charming young mother, only a girl herself, with infants as dainty as wax
  dolls. Round the miniature, fitted neatly into the case, was a plait of
  shining hair, of a dark, yet brilliant, red colour.</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion continued to stare at this simple miniature that was not
  skilful enough in the execution to be more than a pallid suggestion of the
  original, with eyes heavy with a concentration of passion. His mouth, usually
  stern, twitched into a grimace and his body became set in a sombre, hunched
  attitude, expressive of his desperate absorption in the thoughts stimulated
  by the trivial painting. These thoughts never left him during his waking
  hours and, transformed into fearful shapes, haunted his hideous dreams. But
  never did they reach such a pitch of agony as when he, unable to resist the
  nightly torment, gazed at the presentment of these three fair faces.</p>

  <p>The unsnuffed candles flared, then guttered into what the gossips name
  winding sheets, but Mr. Campion took no heed of this uncertain light that
  cast his ragged shadow jumping on the wall behind him, and across the trim
  and empty bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>§ 4</h2>

  <p class="first">Martin entered the hotel quietly and softly went upstairs to Madame Daun's
  apartment. He was a tall, well-made man whose face was covered by a taffeta
  mask. Herr Kugler and his staff had at first found this disguise unpleasant,
  but they had accepted the explanation that Martin was so frightfully
  disfigured by smallpox as to be intolerable to the eyes of his fastidious
  mistress. Though the romantic innkeeper had sometimes wondered if the silken
  plaster (as it seemed to be) did not conceal some famous countenance, yet he
  knew this speculation to be fantastic, and after some weeks in Dinkelsbuhl
  Martin's misfortune had been accepted. The eyes that looked through the holes
  were clear but it was impossible to trace the outline of the features beneath
  the rude modelling of the mask. Martin wore a plain brown livery, with a
  narrow black braid at the seams. His linen was expensive and he had silver
  buckles on his well-made shoes. His hair was black and hung lankly on to his
  broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>Madame Daun herself answered his careful knock.</p>

  <p>"How late you are!" she whispered nervously.</p>

  <p>"I could not venture it before."</p>

  <p>He entered the room cautiously. The curtains were drawn and also the
  candles extinguished save those four wax lights in a girandole on the marble
  and gilt console beneath the Venetian mirror. In this faint light Martin's
  mask seemed to be made of dirty plaster. His voice was slightly distorted by
  the rigid slit that served as mouthpiece.</p>

  <p>"Tell me at once," she whispered, pulling her yellow silk shawl about her
  as she shivered on to the sofa. Her face was free of the muslin, and the
  extreme delicacy of her features was startling to the man who looked at her
  so shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"You are ill." His voice was sunk but powerful, even in a whisper. "That
  would be the last misfortune&mdash;if you were to be ill."</p>

  <p>"I shall not be ill."</p>

  <p>"The woman&mdash;?" he interrupted, glancing at the inner door.</p>

  <p>"You know she does not understand English. The Madame Daun story quiets
  her, with just a hint of the other. But she should not find you here so
  late."</p>

  <p>"It is he," said Martin.</p>

  <p>"O! Here&mdash;in this house!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I brushed against him, just now, under the linden trees. I was
  waiting for him to return. I saw him, clear enough, in the light of the
  public lamp. I had my hat pulled down. I moved away, then waited outside the
  window of the common parlour. He was talking to Kugler. Complaining of a
  lackey's insolence, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Then he has no suspicion?" The lady spoke in extreme terror, and leaned
  forward on her knees as if without strength.</p>

  <p>"None. I heard the talk among the servants. He has taken no trouble not to
  appear odd. He admitted he was searching for someone. Kugler was uneasy. He
  is a coward as well as a fool."</p>

  <p>"Here! In this house! Sleeping beneath the same roof!"</p>

  <p>"Not sleeping, I think. He looks desperate&mdash;yet strong, too."</p>

  <p>"What can we do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I repeat, he has no doubts. Remember he is looking for both of
  us. You are travelling alone. He is not subtle enough to suspect a lackey. A
  very literal minded man. And he leaves early to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"I do not feel as I could endure this night&mdash;indeed I do not. I shall
  declare I have a fever and make Adriana sit up with me."</p>

  <p>"No. The woman probably knows too much already. You will do nothing
  unusual."</p>

  <p>"You are right, as always. I shall be quiet, but how slowly the hours will
  pass!" She clasped her hands in an excess of fear, and her body trembled
  under the thin gown and shawl.</p>

  <p>"Tell this woman the other story, or hint at it&mdash;show the ducal
  letter. You are quite a good actress, yet you cannot control yourself."</p>

  <p>"My terror is too acute," she murmured. "To know that <i>he</i> is
  <i>here!"</i></p>

  <p>"It has taken him two years to find us, and now he does not know that he
  has done so." Martin, as if expecting to be surprised, had maintained a
  careful distance from the lady and stood, respectfully, well away from the
  sofa where she crouched.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew what clues he had. How he came here at all."</p>

  <p>"May we never be as near again!"</p>

  <p>"He must have leave of absence. Some special concession. But it would not
  be more than six months. He will have, soon, to return home."</p>

  <p>The lady muffled the fine texture of the shawl into her face, as if to
  check cries or sobs.</p>

  <p>Martin, alarmed at this emotion, left her, saying sternly: "I trust to
  your wits. We cannot stay here much longer. I shall tell you our plans
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>As soon as he had left the room, Madame Daun struck a bell on the console
  table. Adriana Beheim entered at once. Certain that she had been
  eavesdropping, the lady said that the devoted Martin had just warned her of
  danger.</p>

  <p>"I may have been recognized and followed. This good fellow
  saw&mdash;someone&mdash;in Dinkelsbuhl&mdash;" her voice fell to silence.</p>

  <p>They spoke in French, Adriana's tongue lagged in that speech. She strained
  her attention to understand what her mistress said. She appeared eager, yet
  troubled.</p>

  <p>"If you would confide in me," she whispered. "Please, Madame, have faith
  in me."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible. Know me only as Madame Daun. And above all be
  prudent."</p>

  <p>"Never have I failed in the utmost discretion!"</p>

  <p>"Yet recall that I engaged you merely from an agency in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"But first, Madame, you asked if I was loyal to...to..."</p>

  <p>"Do not mention the name!"</p>

  <p>"But I must think of it&mdash;and of <i>her</i>&mdash;every time I see
  your face, Madame," replied the servant in great agitation. "Yet there is so
  much I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"I intend," said the lady slowly, "to spend the rest of my life in
  seclusion. I shall take a remote mansion in some remote part of the Duchy or
  in Wurtemberg&mdash;the Duke protects me. I shall hire servants. Money I have
  in plenty. Martin will conduct my affairs for me. And so, withdrawn from the
  world, I shall hope not to live long."</p>

  <p>"I did not engage for an existence like that," murmured the maid, half in
  caution, half in fear. "And, Madame, it has, this proposal, a tinge of
  madness."</p>

  <p>"Many will say that I am mad. Perhaps I lost my wits when I was a
  prisoner. When&mdash;all my family&mdash;was&mdash;murdered."</p>

  <p>Adriana crossed herself.</p>

  <p>"Do not speak of it, pray, Madame."</p>

  <p>"But I think of it, always. Consider my offer. You will be well paid. And
  I shall not live long."</p>

  <p>Adriana inclined her head silently. She was getting old and her life had
  been without incident. She had no relations and no interests. She found this
  strange lady, who had partly confided in her so wild and improbable a tale,
  fascinating. Moreover, her mistress gave little trouble and paid well. It was
  easier to continue in this service than to seek another place. Yet she
  remained suspicious, reluctant to involve herself in possible mischief. Nor
  did the prospect of this lonely house, this sacrificed life, please her mind,
  romantic and curious, yet shrewd and superstitious.</p>

  <p>"See me to bed now," said the lady with a sigh; she rose and the maid
  followed her into the bedroom. On the bed, covered with a silken shawl, was a
  fine chemise, embroidered on the sleeve with the letters "M.A." On the table
  by the bed was a prayer book bound in blue velvet powdered with fleur-de-lys.
  Madame Daun opened it and glanced at the pencil sketch, on the title page, of
  a woman whose uncommon face showed a definite likeness to her own fair
  countenance, and the flowing signature of a murdered Queen. Adriana glanced
  at it also, with awe and a little wonder.</p>

  <p>"If you are devoted to the Imperial Family, Adriana, you could not choose
  but stay with me."</p>

  <p>"Madame, I must consider&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say no more, Adriana."</p>

  <p>The lady went to her solitary repose, the maid to her modest closet. Herr
  Kugler put out the lamps and candles in the public rooms, after bolting the
  massive front door. Upstairs, Mr. Campion lay drowsed on his bed, in the
  dark, for the street lamp was out; the miniature, at which he had gazed so
  intensely, in his hand. In his room above the stable Martin took off his
  taffeta mask, with a mutter of relief, and lay down to sleep; he also was in
  the dark.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>§ 5</h2>

  <p class="first">"The Englishman has gone early?" asked Martin. Herr Kugler replied that
  this was so, adding: "He would not take a servant. It is dangerous to travel
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Where was he going?"</p>

  <p>"To Stuttgart. He seemed sure that the person, or persons, he was looking
  for are in Wurtemberg. He has the help of the police, he declares."</p>

  <p>"Ah, there are many strange guests in Europe now," remarked the
  <i>valet-de-place.</i> "Perhaps that of my mistress, seeking sanctuary, the
  strangest of all. I have had letters to-day," he showed a packet in his hand,
  "I believe we have found the house." And he mentioned a small <i>schloss,</i>
  or hunting box, situated in one of the loneliest parts of the Forest, known
  as Wilhelmsruhe and long abandoned.</p>

  <p>"What a dismal habitation for a high-born lady!" exclaimed Herr
  Kugler.</p>

  <p>"It is what she seeks, and what the Dukes suggest."</p>

  <p>The innkeeper was silent before these august names. Martin proceeded
  upstairs with the letters that the post had brought that morning addressed to
  Madame Daun, at the Drei Mohren. Adriana passed him and came down, carrying
  on a gilt tray the Dresden china service used for her mistress's morning
  chocolate. As she gave this to a maid passing along the passage, she spoke to
  the innkeeper in their native tongue.</p>

  <p>"I want you to help me about this Madame Daun&mdash;in bed as usual."</p>

  <p>Herr Kugler raised a silencing hand and motioned her to the little room at
  the back of the public parlour that he used as an office.</p>

  <p>"I was about to ask <i>your</i> help," he said, in some dismay. "I do not
  wish this interesting traveller to remain here."</p>

  <p>"She does not wish to do so. Martin has told me&mdash;and so has
  she&mdash;that they intend to establish themselves in a lonely hunting lodge
  where she will live in utter seclusion. I am asked to share this
  retreat."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her quickly. She shrugged and replied to the look: "Ah, you
  think that I am one to whom the world offers little! All the same, to shut
  oneself up like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The question is," put in Herr Kugler, "who is she?"</p>

  <p>"You do not <i>know</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Not precisely. I have heard the same stories as you have. There is really
  no reason to doubt them, save common-sense," sighed the innkeeper. "I confess
  that at first I was fascinated, baffled, overborne. Then the letter from the
  Duke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Neither you nor I, my dear sir, is in a position to question His Highness
  about that letter. Are we simple folk being deceived?"</p>

  <p>"For what end? Madame Daun is not a criminal. She has money, jewels, an
  excellent servant. She receives no one&mdash;she makes no attempt to turn her
  attractions to advantage."</p>

  <p>"She is a well-bred lady, of course," agreed Adriana. "And the likeness is
  remarkable. Then there are also the souvenirs. Yet&mdash;" she paused and
  shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What are your suspicions?"</p>

  <p>"I could hardly say&mdash;they are foreigners."</p>

  <p>"<i>They</i>&mdash;but Martin is a servant."</p>

  <p>"More a steward, at least. He knows all her affairs."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, that is explained by his family's loyalty to her family.
  Besides, she speaks to me of friends who help her secretly, but who respect
  her wish for secrecy. After all," added Herr Kugler, as if endeavouring to
  convince himself, "considering her most horrible experiences, her dread of a
  loveless marriage to a man she dislikes&mdash;it is possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You do know more than I do," interrupted Adriana sharply. "She has never
  even hinted more than that she is a survivor of the terror in Paris where her
  family was murdered, and has some connection with royalty."</p>

  <p>"She <i>has</i> told you more. I know it. Why did you refer to souvenirs
  and the likeness?" Herr Kugler spoke firmly, but kept his voice very low.
  "Let us be plain," he added. "This lady leads us to believe&mdash;without
  saying so in as many words&mdash;that she is that Princess known as 'The
  Orphan of the Temple,' daughter of your Austrian Queen, whose forthcoming
  marriage to her cousin was recently in the <i>Gazette</i>."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, she allowed me to think that, now you insist on putting it so
  plainly."</p>

  <p>"Not so plainly&mdash;yet it is obvious that she claims royal
  blood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;And a desire to die in hiding," interrupted Adriana. "I don't know
  what to do. I feel a devotion, a loyalty. She is easy to please, there is
  plenty of money."</p>

  <p>"Who would supply that? The Bourbons are bankrupt, exiled in
  Switzerland."</p>

  <p>"Some rich friends are helping her&mdash;perhaps English, she speaks
  English, she and Martin. I do not like his mask."</p>

  <p>"You are fanciful. I've often known those marred by the small-pox wear
  them, like blind people wear a bandage over the eyes. I'm used to that. Yet I
  do feel there is a mystery, and I shall be pleased when they have left my
  house."</p>

  <p>"She admits <i>they</i> search for her, her family that would be,
  <i>they</i> want this marriage."</p>

  <p>"Who is left of her family?" asked Herr Kugler courteously. "I never
  concerned myself about these exiles, though I pity them. Yes, pity! It is
  impossible not to feel pity for this young lady."</p>

  <p>The man and woman looked at one another doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"A royal princess would be missed. I put that to her, she said that a
  friend had taken her place in the Swiss convent from which she escaped."</p>

  <p>"It is fantastic!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is certainly something fantastic about this lady. Whatever it
  may be, the Duke protects her, yet she is afraid of spies, of the police. Are
  you sure that Englishman was <i>not</i> looking for her?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, he has only gone as far as Stuttgart. From there he could
  watch her or have her watched."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>§ 6</h2>

  <p class="first">These same words were being spoken by Martin to his mistress as they rode
  together under the avenues of limes planted on the ancient fortifications:
  "He has gone to Stuttgart, from there he could watch us." They sat their
  hired horses well, and Madame Daun, in a fashionable riding suit, showed
  nothing of the languor that had kept her confined to her elegant apartments
  in the Drei Mohren.</p>

  <p>"Why should he do so?" she asked, wearily. "He certainly had no suspicions
  or he would not have left the posting house early this morning without even
  trying to see us."</p>

  <p>"Yet I am not satisfied," replied Martin. "He has much help, the police,
  the two ducal courts&mdash;we have but our wits&mdash;the English residents,
  probably, wherever he goes."</p>

  <p>"His errand is hardly one that he could confide to the police."</p>

  <p>"He will have every assistance," answered Martin, impatiently. "The Regent
  himself must have granted him leave of absence for this special purpose."</p>

  <p>"Do not speak of it, pray!"</p>

  <p>"I must, at least, think of it. We cannot stay in the Drei Mohren. I shall
  take that Wilhelmsruhe house, a hunting lodge, not for some time used. It
  will suit us very well."</p>

  <p>"For how long?" she asked, fearfully.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. We must play these parts until we can shake him off.
  Remember what is on that."</p>

  <p>"Cannot we fly, at once? To Austria&mdash;to Italy?"</p>

  <p>"That would be to attract attention. We must go to earth."</p>

  <p>She glanced in terror at his rude taffeta mask, it was only by his voice
  she could guess at his mood. The lovely day lay heavily upon her as, with the
  tone of a master, he bade her ride ahead, while he fell into a servant's
  place behind her as they returned to the town of Dinkelsbuhl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>§ 7</h2>

  <p class="first">Without provoking any comment, Mr. Henry Campion lodged at the modest post
  house, Blaue Engel, in Stuttgart, having crossed the frontier from Bavaria
  without any difficulty, owing to his papers being of a kind acceptable to
  both the Duke of Bavaria and the Duke of Wurtemberg. He soon forgot the lady
  staying at the inn under the name of Madame Daun. He had stayed at so many
  inns during his recent rapid journeying, and inquired into the identities of
  so many fellow travellers. He did not expect to find her alone, and for that
  reason had taken but little interest in the lady living on the first floor of
  the Drei Mohren. Therefore, he, who had left such alarm and speculation
  behind him, was obsessed by his own sorrows and furies and gave no thought to
  the tall man who had brushed against him under the linden trees, nor to that
  pale room he had seen bright in the summer darkness, behind the open shutters
  of the lady's chamber.</p>

  <p>He had come to an end of his clues. Such reports as had been secretly and
  lavishly furnished to him he had exhausted. All had proved false and had led
  him astray from main roads. In six months of hard riding and driving he had
  zigzagged across Europe, often retracing his steps. It had been like
  wandering in a maze. War, too, had overturned the usual conveniences and made
  everything tedious. Many villages were deserted, many chateaux closed,
  hunting boxes and summer residences abandoned, parks overgrown, the posts
  were disorganized, the countryside often had a ruined look. It was common to
  see maimed and diseased people. Herr Kugler had been wise to warn him of the
  dangers of travelling alone through the dense forests where the rambling
  walls and stern towers of ancient castles certainly harboured thieves and
  vagabonds. But he had not been molested. He went well armed and was prudent,
  he had, also, the fanatic's faith in his destiny that kept him from any
  concern as to his own safety.</p>

  <p>Now, in Stuttgart, he felt himself lost in the maze, as if the entire
  design enclosed him, twist on twist, and to move would be only to wander
  senselessly until he died of an agony of fatigue.</p>

  <p>He walked along the Grabenstrasse, past the new palace still being built,
  to the old palace, approached by an avenue of plane trees. The heavy,
  formidable royal residence, appearing like a fortress of some distant period,
  partly deserted, partly used as offices, attracted as much of his attention
  as he had to give to anything. He turned into the courtyard, then into that
  beyond, and noticed that the ancient chapel was being used as an apothecary's
  shop.</p>

  <p>In his loneliness, his idleness, the intense concentration of his purpose,
  he moved like a man mechanically propelled, up to the counter on which were
  wooden bowls of poppy heads, a pair of shining scales and bottles of Bohemian
  glass, deep blue and a clear crimson, cut on white.</p>

  <p>The place smelt pleasantly of herbs and essences; shelves at the back held
  Delft jars of drugs. The apothecary's assistant was weighing out cloves,
  cinnamon and bay leaves, and looked up sharply as the foreigner entered. The
  apothecary was attached to the court and visited only by the better sort. Mr.
  Campion's self absorption gave him an air of confidence, so that he passed as
  one well answered for by the great.</p>

  <p>"I want," he said, "an anodyne. I do not sleep very well."</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head. He did not understand English. Mr. Campion
  roused himself and repeated his demand in German.</p>

  <p>"The name of your physician, sir?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"I have none."</p>

  <p>"Then I cannot supply you with anything save a very simple powder&mdash;to
  ease the head or the heart."</p>

  <p>The Englishman tapped his fingers on the counter.</p>

  <p>"It was an impulse on which I spoke. Naturally, travelling incessantly one
  becomes fatigued."</p>

  <p>"You are credited to the English Ministry?" asked the apothecary's
  assistant.</p>

  <p>"No. But my papers are in good order and I have protection in high
  places."</p>

  <p>"I do not doubt it, sir," replied the chemist sincerely, for the stranger
  had a figure and air of authority and distinction. "You were recommended
  here? We have essences, perfumes, soaps, ointments&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall make some purchases. Let them be what you will." Mr. Campion
  seated himself on the high-polished stool by the counter. "I am tired. Pray
  give me the name of some doctor of medicine."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Raab of the Postplatz attends most of the foreigners; he speaks
  several languages. But, sir, you should learn this at the English
  Residency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I came here by chance," interrupted Mr. Campion. "A curious place in
  which to find a chemist's shop."</p>

  <p>"A magnificent new palace is being built," replied the Wurtemberger with
  pride, "and this, the ancient Hofburg, is now used as offices. This was the
  chapel."</p>

  <p>"A blasphemy, as I think."</p>

  <p>"Sir, you will find, all over South Germany, old chapels, churches and
  convents now used as shops, barracks and lunatic asylums."</p>

  <p>The youth had turned to the back of the long room where trestles, board
  tables and chairs stood in front of shelves and cupboards.</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion rested his arms on the counter and took his face in his hands.
  He felt giddy and grateful for this respite from fatigue in this shadowed,
  pungently scented place. His quest was so near hopeless that he might, he
  thought, as well begin it here as in any other place.</p>

  <p>The apprentice returned with a goblet of pale green foaming liquid that he
  promised would remove the pains of exhaustion, and, after drinking it, Mr.
  Campion did feel soothed.</p>

  <p>The young man continued with his task of weighing and crushing in a mortar
  aromatic herbs, that he then poured, by a silver funnel, into jars of opaque
  jasper.</p>

  <p>"There is a good deal to see in Stuttgart," he gossiped. "Though it is
  termed an idle city, having no trade, nothing but the court, the residences
  and the barracks. But the Stifskirche, just round the corner, has majestic
  royal monuments in the choir and an organ you can boast of. In the
  Hofkellerei you can purchase very fine wine, and in the Muns and Medaillen
  Cabinet are some remarkable coins and gems. In the palace gardens are orange
  trees three hundred years old&mdash;" he held up a small phial of thick milky
  blue glass, "here is some essence or attar extracted from them. I perceive
  you are not listening, sir."</p>

  <p>"No. I am not sure why I came here. Yours is a pleasant city, and the
  country about like a park or garden. But I am lost. I am searching for
  someone&mdash;for two people."</p>

  <p>"Ah, with the war just over, and another threatened, there are so many
  lost."</p>

  <p>"Pray do not repeat that. I hear it from everyone. I must do my utmost in
  the time allotted to me. I have help. But I must rely on myself. Do they say
  in Stuttgart," he added abruptly, "that there will be another war soon?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, yes, sir, that is all the talk, of ill omen and foreboding, and
  we scarcely able to scrape a living yet from the ruins of the last
  confusion."</p>

  <p>"I hear that also, everywhere. If war comes again my time in Europe is
  shorter still. I do not know where to begin. As well here as anywhere!" he
  gave a disagreeable laugh. "I suppose you or your master know all the
  strangers who come to Stuttgart? I thought I had traced them, after so many
  tedious miles, to Heilbronn but they, she, had left that valley. Where had
  she gone? Into Swabia, Franconia&mdash;I had many reports. I went here,
  there, turning back more than once." He checked himself. "Why do I tell you
  all this? I fall into the weak habit of talking to myself."</p>

  <p>"You search, sir, for a lady, travelling alone?" asked the young man,
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"No, no, she would be well attended. She is English, eccentric, and using
  an assumed name. She wintered in Italy for her health, two winters, or in
  Switzerland&mdash;her lungs, as I understand. In brief she has inherited a
  swinging fortune, an estate in Hampshire, you understand, with
  responsibilities. I represent her lawyer."</p>

  <p>The apothecary's assistant thought this story, told in halting German,
  incorrectly used, odd and not in accordance with the foreigner's appearance
  that was in nothing that of a legal or business man, nor was his manner, of
  hardly suffered passion, that of one engaged in merely mercenary or routine
  work.</p>

  <p>"It must be a troublesome journey, sir. Has the lady left no post or
  agent's or banker's address?"</p>

  <p>"None&mdash;eccentric, I told you, and wishful to lose herself."</p>

  <p>"She must be well supplied with money. Everything is costly now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she must," replied Mr. Campion, grimly. "I don't understand
  that&mdash;I mean I suppose she is using all her resources."</p>

  <p>"But who sends her money?" asked the apothecary's assistant, putting the
  heavy gilded stoppers into the jars of crushed herbs. "You could, sir,
  surely, being a lawyer, have found that out in England."</p>

  <p>"I did," interrupted Mr. Campion in a hard, angry tone. "She had left the
  address given me, before I reached it&mdash;communication with England is
  much delayed. I have, therefore, been travelling for several months."</p>

  <p>"It must," remarked the young Wurtemberger, "be a considerable estate to
  warrant such expenses."</p>

  <p>"More than an estate hangs on this quest. Tell me if you recall any talk
  or gossip. I warrant that little takes place here you do not know of."</p>

  <p>"I have not heard of an Englishwoman recently in Stuttgart or near abouts,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion sighed. "She is not able to speak any language but her own,
  save a little French. She could not pass for anyone save an Englishwoman." He
  paused, fingering the round goblet. The sunlight lay on the stone floor and
  Mr. Campion gazed at it, as if through it, at long vanished scenes that
  haunted him and would not be forgotten. "An Englishwoman," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"And delicate?" the apothecary's assistant suggested. "Then, sir, this
  doctor Raab might assist you; as I said, all foreigners go to him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion rose. As he had lied when he had said the lady was ill this
  suggestion did not interest him. He wished that he had not entered this
  strange place, with the vaulted roof above and cold flags beneath, and
  pungent perfumes. He put a coin on the table for his draught and asked for a
  parcel of pomades and soaps to be made up and sent to him, Mr. Henry Campion,
  at the Blaue Engel. He hesitated, looked round as if expecting one to enter
  the tall door and blot out the shaft of sunshine.</p>

  <p>There was something so forlorn, yet so forceful, in his attitude,
  something that so strongly conveyed both courage and despair, that the young
  Wurtemberger, who was sympathetic towards this fine handsome man, and who had
  believed nothing of his story, said: "Perhaps, sir, I <i>might</i> help you.
  The clue is very slight but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion had turned instantly to face him.</p>

  <p>"I am used to slight clues. I shall pay well, even for useless
  information."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, there was a gentleman, a foreigner, sent here by Dr.
  Raab&mdash;he had a touch of quinsy, such has been common, and the malaise
  from the grapes&mdash;too many vineyards round Stuttgart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>&mdash;"and he was travelling with a lady?" Mr. Campion corrected himself.
  "As a courier, I mean."</p>

  <p>"No. He was searching for a lady. I wondered if it might be the same lady.
  An Englishwoman, he said. He had traced her, or so he supposed, to the
  Bavarian frontiers."</p>

  <p>The young man paused to consider the effect of his words on his sombre and
  interesting stranger. A flash that was almost like the light of hope spread
  over the heavy face as Mr. Campion wildly thought, "Has he left her? Is it
  possible? Has she left him?" The light faded and he said: "Where is this man?
  Is it possible to speak with him?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I do not know, sir, or even if he is still in Stuttgart."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him? What is he like in his person?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir. He came here, when he was cured, and bought a quantity of
  perfumes. A foreigner, he might be English, his German had an accent."</p>

  <p>"Like mine. I never spoke the language until recently. Yes, this man," Mr.
  Campion laboured out his clumsy lies, "might be the courier of this English
  lady."</p>

  <p>"I do not know where he stayed. But Dr. Raab might tell you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Send your account to my inn, I shall be there for some days, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>He left the shop, blinking in the sunlight, then returned asking for the
  physician's exact address. The young man gave this, then turned, checking
  over the items the stranger had ordered at random. "Whatever the truth is, he
  did not tell it to me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion felt giddy in the sunlight; he made his way heavily to the
  physician's house in the Postplatz. Dr. Raab was at home and received him
  civilly. He was an elderly man with a smooth experienced manner. He might,
  from the appearance both of himself and his neat home, have had many
  activities besides that of medicine, but Mr. Campion took him on his face
  value, as a physician and nothing else. Moreover, the Englishman came
  straight to the point and, dropping all pretence at concern for his own
  health, related the story the apothecary's assistant had told him.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I recall the young man; in this quiet old city every new face
  is noticed. He was staying at Bode's and may be there now. He inquired about
  a lady. Rather remarkable that there should be such a lost lady, a foreign
  lady, travelling in Europe in these tedious times."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion longed to put the queries he had posed to Herr Kugler, but
  could not bring himself to do so. What had been possible with an innkeeper
  was not possible with a man of education. He repeated his tale about the
  estate in Hampshire and stiffly took his leave, awkwardly placing a fee on
  the physician's bureau. He had the address, Bode's Hotel, of the other
  foreigner, who seemed to be on the same quest as himself and whose
  description he had not dared to ask. Before the lackey had opened the front
  door to him, Dr. Raab had appeared at the head of the stairs, his face
  smiling. "I do not know if I am betraying a confidence in telling you that
  this patient of mine, the last time I visited him at Bode's, told me that he
  had found the lady."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion could not answer. He bowed and went out heavily into the
  sunshine that lay with a warmth that seemed tangible on the Postplatz. The
  unacknowledged hope had vanished. She had not left him, not escaped, or if
  she had she had been recaptured soon and easily. Even, Mr. Campion asked
  himself fiercely, if they had parted, what difference would that have made,
  after two years? None, was the answer. Yet there had been that sparkle of
  hope. He sighed and walked slowly, often losing his way in the unfamiliar
  streets. When he found Bode's Hotel in the Schlossstrasse, he discovered it
  to be a superior inn, with a fine frontage, and well kept. There were
  handsome carriages before the door and liveried valets in the passage.</p>

  <p>He asked for Signor Petronio Miola, the name that Dr. Raab had given him
  as the <i>nom de voyage</i> of the foreigner who might have been English. Mr.
  Campion, who, because of his limited knowledge of languages, had not ventured
  to change his nationality, thought that the man whom he sought might very
  well have done so. "One of his sly, crafty tricks. Yes, he would be clever at
  any kind of mummery; he knows Europe well, too."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Campion reflected that he had come to Bode's on an impulse,
  almost stupidly, searching out his enemy face to face, in public, without
  having thought out what his action would be. He had not intended this, but
  rather to take them unaware, to spy on them unperceived, to make himself and
  his purpose known carefully, and by degrees.</p>

  <p>Now a moment was possibly on him that he had long and passionately waited
  for, and he felt unprepared, even sick and nervous.</p>

  <p>The valet returned to inform him the Signor Miola was about to leave
  Stuttgart, it was for him that one of the carriages waited, but that he could
  offer a few moments to the traveller who wished to speak to him on matters of
  importance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion was too absorbed in his purpose to feel the sting to his pride
  that he would never, save for this one object, have endured. He had never
  asked favours or waited on others. His spirit was as unbending as his
  manners.</p>

  <p>He was shown into a parlour on the first floor; amid the formal furniture
  lay strapped valises, and Mr. Campion felt a heightening of his continuous
  nausea at this constant travelling. The road&mdash;the inn&mdash;the
  passport&mdash;the visa. The fruitless correspondence, stale and dull,
  waiting at the posthouses. And again came the forbidden, but not to be
  denied, thought of lost days of peace and security, of a home with lawns
  sloping to the edge of the placid river, of the company of those whom he had
  cherished with a love and pride seldom expressed.</p>

  <p>How well he knew these inn rooms! In how many of them had he passed
  restless nights! They hardly changed from one country to another. If one paid
  enough, one got good service and accommodation of an unvarying kind, and
  these continental hostelries provided both an exasperating sense of a
  vagabond continually changing existence, and a dull monotony. As usual, there
  was an inner door to the private room occupied by the luxurious traveller.
  Mr. Campion glanced jealously through this door that stood partly open, and
  saw, with a sick glance, the back of a man in a summer cloak, standing before
  a dressing table. The light was so cast that this figure was a mere outline
  of brownish grey, the hues in the shadow of both the travelling dress and the
  long, fastened back hair. It might have been the man for whom Mr. Campion
  searched. The woman also, might have been concealed in the second chamber.
  Mr. Campion paused to hear their voices. For himself, he could neither speak
  nor move, but stood rigid, his hat in his hand, his heavy face slightly
  distorted in a grimace of fatigue and emotion.</p>

  <p>His suspense lasted no more than a second, and the man by the dressing
  table had heard him enter and turned. Even in the obscurity of cross lights
  and shadows Mr. Campion perceived he gazed at a stranger.</p>

  <p>Relief at being spared the hideous climax that he so desperately sought,
  was instantly followed in Mr. Campion's mind by an intensifying of the
  dreadful frustration that accompanied him weary day, dreary night.</p>

  <p>"I have disturbed you needlessly, sir," he said in English, his sad
  passion making him awkward, even discourteous in bearing.</p>

  <p>The other man came into the parlour. He was young, comely and expensively
  dressed. His air was cheerful, gentle and aristocratic. He seemed entirely at
  his visitor's service, anxious to please and of a most sympathetic manner.
  But Mr. Campion regarded him with dislike as the cause of disappointment,
  humiliation and a surge of almost intolerable emotion.</p>

  <p>"You are not English?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"No. I am a native of Bologna. I speak your language however. I had an
  English tutor. Pray be seated."</p>

  <p>"It is not worth while. You are not the man I seek. Dr. Raab was under a
  misapprehension, he thought you a fellow countryman of mine."</p>

  <p>"If I had been, what would you have asked me?" Signor Miola spoke with a
  sweet courtesy that Mr. Campion unreasonably resented. Feeling, however, that
  he must make some excuse for his intrusion, he said: "I am searching for a
  lady&mdash;" Then the words died on his tongue, for he realized how often and
  to how many people he had repeated them.</p>

  <p>"And Dr. Raab told you that I, also, made this search for a
  gentlewoman?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but now I see that your business can be none of mine."</p>

  <p>"Pray be seated, sir. Do not let us part so suddenly. Share with me a
  bottle of sparkling Necker wine. I have found the gentlewoman I sought."</p>

  <p>Partly out of curiosity, not wholly to be denied, partly out of a desire
  not to appear churlish, Mr. Campion took the red damask chair by the window
  that looked on to the busy Schlossstraat.</p>

  <p>"She was an elderly Spaniard, a connection of mine by marriage, travelling
  with a chaplain, maids, a courier, a dwarf and spaniels. Her destination was
  Bad Willsbad, but apparently she changed her mind and went to one of the
  Brunnen in the Black Forest."</p>

  <p>"Sir, this does not concern me."</p>

  <p>"But one traveller may tell his tale to another?" The Bolognese pulled the
  bell. "My quest is rather amusing. My relative's son is in sudden need of
  money&mdash;a pressing bill, you understand&mdash;and I, having nothing
  better to do, undertook to be his ambassador. To-day I travel to Rippoldsau,
  in the valley of Schappau, where I learn she is."</p>

  <p>In return for this frankly given explanation, Mr. Campion offered his dry
  and badly told tale of the missing heiress to the Hampshire estate.</p>

  <p>Signor Miola was all gracious attention to this halting narrative.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, everyone travels under a <i>nom de voyage</i> now, but a
  wealthy Englishwoman travelling alone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not alone. She would have an English courier with her." He could not save
  himself from adding: "Have you seen any such lady?"</p>

  <p>"Very possibly." Signor Miola poured out the sparkling wine the valet had
  brought, into the green glasses. "As I was about to say, an Englishwoman,
  travelling alone, wealthy, keeping to the main roads, should be easily
  traced. I have been lately on the way between Nuremberg and Stuttgart and
  searching out of the way places. There are many foreigners at the Brunnen,
  even now; could you offer me a description?"</p>

  <p>Signor Miola spoke fluently, his address was manly and ingratiating. Mr.
  Campion, whose large hand shook slightly on his glass, felt soothed and more
  inclined to give his confidence than he had felt since he had left London in
  the first rigours of his cold, almost despairing resolve.</p>

  <p>Yet still he expressed himself with difficulty.</p>

  <p>"She is young; of no great, or surprising beauty, you understand.
  A&mdash;well bred&mdash;Englishwoman. There is nothing uncommon in her
  person, save her hair. Red hair. And that hue is uncommon only in England. In
  the Scotch Lowlands it is not rare."</p>

  <p>"I have seen such a lady," replied the other, readily. "But she was with
  her husband."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion set down his glass with meticulous care, but his strength rose
  to meet his need.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she might be with her husband. She would be, I suppose. As
  representing her man of business, I know little of her affairs. I suppose she
  was ill and left in some medical care while her husband, who is a merchant,
  travelled alone. There would be a courier also&mdash;a modest equipage."</p>

  <p>The Bolognese had been looking from the window while Mr. Campion forced
  out these words. Then he spoke indifferently. "A couple answering to that
  description was here a day or so ago. They lived quietly, but I got into
  conversation with them, as I like to speak English. The lady did not appear
  to be delicate."</p>

  <p>"What manner of man was her companion?" Mr. Campion obliged himself to ask
  this odious question.</p>

  <p>"About my own age and figure. A soldierly bearing, dark&mdash;for your
  country, at least. Conspicuous good looks. Yes, I think so." Signor Miola
  smiled as if sympathetically interested.</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion tried to rise, but could not.</p>

  <p>"The heat," he muttered, "and this incessant jolting over broken roads. I
  have attacks of giddiness."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Raab is an excellent physician."</p>

  <p>"I forgot," sighed the Englishman, "to tell him my case. I was so
  engrossed in finding you. I supposed," he added, more firmly, "that you were
  either the husband&mdash;or the courier of this lady."</p>

  <p>He forced himself to rise, and stood holding on to the back of the red
  damask chair. He obliged himself to look into the pleasant light grey eyes of
  the Bolognese, who was smiling at him in a most agreeable manner. No one
  could have been more unlike the man he sought; strange that he had made that
  first mistake of thinking that there was a resemblance, strange, even
  allowing for the uncertain light of the shadowed inner room.</p>

  <p>"Can you inform me," he asked carefully, "where this&mdash;these people,
  went?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to Donauschingen on the way to Schaffhausen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In Switzerland?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion restrained his impulse to follow at once the fugitives. Slow
  and easily deceived, he was yet well trained and constantly goading himself
  to be on the alert. He reminded himself that he must be cautious. Used to
  direct methods, he was exasperated by anything in the nature of a subterfuge.
  Even the fact that he bore what the Bolognese so casually termed a <i>nom de
  voyage,</i> irritated him, though he was aware that few people travelling in
  Europe now used their own names, for good or bad reasons. "Careful," he
  warned himself, "this Italian fellow is certainly a gentleman, but he may be
  a scoundrel or a practical jester, and it is possible he even desires to
  throw me off the scent." Aloud, he asked painfully, loathing the part he was
  playing, if his agreeable host could be certain of the destination of the
  English couple.</p>

  <p>"They said it was Schaffhausen&mdash;I heard them instruct the German
  courier," smiled Signor Miola. "They seemed weary of Germany. Their name is
  Latymer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, these false names! Their appearance? Excuse me that I trouble you,
  but I have already wasted so much time, and I have to return to England
  shortly."</p>

  <p>"You expect a renewal of the war?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe&mdash;why do you ask?" Mr. Campion was glad of a respite from the
  poignant purpose of this odious interview.</p>

  <p>"I thought you might be a soldier&mdash;you have that air."</p>

  <p>A slow colour spread over Mr. Campion's heavy face.</p>

  <p>"I am a lawyer, sir, as I told you."</p>

  <p>"Why yes, but, as you remarked, sir, these false names! Now how can I help
  you to identify the Latymers? The gentleman's handsome face was the most
  notable of their characteristics."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion turned from the window, then turned again like one blind with
  torment.</p>

  <p>"No fop," added Signor Miola, "but a head of classic beauty. The lady? A
  high nose, prominent eyes, red hair, pale, she wore some Eastern shawls, very
  fine silk, yellow, white, she had a dressing case of green morocco, for she
  entrusted it to me to have repaired for her. They knew very little
  German."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion bowed his head in silence.</p>

  <p>"And, if it helps you, the initials on the case, that she said she had
  possessed before her marriage, were L.W."</p>

  <p>"Yes, these are the people," muttered Mr. Campion, with a ghastly look.
  "You heard her name, her Christian name, used perchance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I noticed it, for it was odd to me at first.
  Letty&mdash;Lettice&mdash;our Letitia, I presume. She told me that the other
  letter stood for Winslow. So, my dear sir, if you are searching for Mrs.
  Letty Winslow she is certainly by now at Schaffhausen."</p>

  <p>"That is her real name she toys with so. To hear it in this place! From a
  stranger's lips!" Mr. Campion grinned, sighed and stumbled on. "Truly I am
  confused with fatigue, this has been a long, a tedious business."</p>

  <p>"One understands, perfectly. Perhaps I can help you further. I travel with
  my servant, who is a very intelligent fellow." Signor Miola stepped to the
  inner door and called: "Bonino!"</p>

  <p>A lean, soft-footed man with quick eyes appeared, a small valise in his
  hand. His air of perfect detachment soothed even Mr. Campion's terrible
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"Bonino," explained his master, smiling. "This gentleman is looking for
  the English people who were staying in Stuttgart, will you tell him their
  names and particulars of their appearance, and their destination."</p>

  <p>The body servant, in rapidly spoken Italian and broken English, at once
  confirmed Signor Miola's story.</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion had believed this from the first. Now he heard this second
  witness he felt he had satisfied all possible prudence and caution. He
  thanked the Bolognese in a formal and abstracted manner, hardly noticing to
  whom he spoke, picked up his hat and cane and went downstairs.</p>

  <p>Signor Miola watched him from the window.</p>

  <p>"Bonino, there is a man most easily gulled. I see him below making
  inquiries from the porters, he will certainly go at once to
  Schaffhausen."</p>

  <p>"Sir, he appeared incapable of further travel&mdash;a man exhausted,
  consumed by emotion."</p>

  <p>"But a very strong man, Bonino. Much what I expected to see. One might
  feel inclined to pity him."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir, one pities him a great deal."</p>

  <p>"Yet his intention is murder, Bonino."</p>

  <p>The valet permitted himself the slightest shrug. "May I ask, sir, where we
  are going?"</p>

  <p>"Into the Forest. See the arms are ready and primed. We must go
  alone."</p>

  <p>"You have found them, sir?" Bonino's tone was regretful.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I have. It was not so difficult. We must be off at once."</p>

  <p>The servant ventured to step closer to his master; the fading sunlight,
  now full on him, showed him to be nearly a generation older than Signor
  Miola.</p>

  <p>"If I could once more entreat, even on my knees, that you, my dear lord,
  abandon this&mdash;infatuation, that you return to the splendid life you had
  at the Villa Aria, at the Palazzo San Quirico. You are so missed&mdash;the
  ornament, the support of your family."</p>

  <p>The Bolognese received these words, spoken with all the formality and
  grace of the Italian language, without the least offence. Indeed, he returned
  the servant's obvious affection with a loving glance.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I know your worth, Bonino. You have reason on your side."</p>

  <p>"Reason, indeed I have, sir. This adventure is beneath you&mdash;you who
  have so much. Besides, I foresee disaster for you among the three of them.
  Indeed, sir," continued the valet desperately, "what worth or merit have they
  so to engross your attention?"</p>

  <p>"Very little indeed, as I think, Bonino," agreed Signor Miola. "A most
  ordinary affair, save in a few details. The truth is that I was not so
  satisfied as you&mdash;as anyone supposed&mdash;in that splendid life of mine
  in Bologna. It was dry and hollow. One wearied of the pedantry, the
  intrigues, even of the artificial merriments."</p>

  <p>"So one understands, signore, but this! What substitute is this&mdash;for
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"You must return to Italy if you are wearied, Bonino. I shall go on alone
  until, one way or another, the little drama ends."</p>

  <p>"You know that I cannot leave you, signore. You know that my letters,
  reports home keep your family satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. You are very useful," smiled the young man. "You manage
  everything extremely well. I should find it difficult to travel incognito
  without you. There is no more to be said than that, Bonino. Take the valise
  down to the carriage and tell the postillion my destination is Wilhelmsruhe
  in the Forest, a former hunting box of some small pretensions near
  Rippoldsau&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where your aunt is staying, sir?" asked the servant, wisely accepting
  defeat with a jest.</p>

  <p>"So your English is better than I thought, you rascal. You not only
  overheard, but understood all my conversation!"</p>

  <p>"How else could I have confirmed your story?"</p>

  <p>"I gave you hints enough for that, Bonino. The Englishman is so dense, and
  so bewildered with passion that he never grasped the significance of your
  presence in the other room."</p>

  <p>"Yet he was shrewd enough, signore, to probe you as to their
  appearance."</p>

  <p>"A desperate kind of shrewdness, Bonino. He was forcing himself to be
  suspicious, against his native credulity. He has never done anything of this
  kind before&mdash;is rash enough to travel alone and to rely on court
  introductions and the police. Of course no one takes any interest in his
  case. He is put off everywhere with lies."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly amazing, signore, that he accepted the tale you told him
  of your eccentric relation."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I am not inclined to laugh at him, Bonino. Now, be on your way.
  I shall follow."</p>

  <p>Left alone, the young man stood thoughtfully, looking down into the street
  where other travellers arrived and departed as the post-coach put in to
  change horses. Mr. Campion had left the active scene, and was certainly by
  now on his way to Donauschingen, a twenty-six hour journey from Stuttgart,
  and the wretched man already broken by fatigue&mdash;</p>

  <p>"For his part," mused Signor Miola, "a renewal of the war would be a lucky
  fortune for him, a chance of an honourable death."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>§ 8</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio San Quirico, travelling under the name of Signor Miola, ascended
  the beautiful heights of the Kniebis in his own light carriage that he had
  brought with him from Italy. Bonino drove the hired horse, the best the post
  could offer, that took the steep incline without difficulty, while the
  heavier vehicles were obliged to have extra horses or oxen for the three
  hours climb. The traveller enjoyed the fair country, rich and lavish in the
  evening light, the wild hollows overhung by gigantic rocks, the stern round
  capped towers of feudal castles overhanging deep defiles. The windings of the
  valleys, the lovely forests in full foliage, showed in an extensive vista as
  the road rose to the summit of the Kniebis. The glowing lustre of the scene
  gave a purple bloom to the mountains, the vineyards in the valleys, the
  fading azure of the heaven.</p>

  <p>The Bolognese was not, as was the English traveller, obsessed by an
  overmastering desire or emotion, though he also was on a quest it was one in
  which his mind, as well as his heart was concerned. For, more intelligent
  than Mr. Campion, his passions were more refined, more under control, and a
  considerable melancholy pervaded his nature. What he was doing was
  deliberate, well planned and carefully executed. It was, he knew, something
  in the nature of an indulged whim, an allowed fantasy. It had begun, possibly
  in boredom; it had more to do with sentiment than passion. He had no
  sleepless nights, no tormenting dreams, and he was sufficiently detached to
  be able to relish the incidents of his luxurious travelling.</p>

  <p>The clumsy devices of the fugitives had never for long delayed him.
  Without the assistance that Mr. Campion employed, he, with the expert aid of
  his servant, had followed, a stage or so behind, easily, the couple whom he
  pursued. It had not taken him long to discover that a strange lady, supposed,
  in Stuttgart gossip, to be a member of the French Royal House, had taken the
  long deserted hunting box near Rippoldsau, once the property of the Grand
  Duke of Baden, and situated in a garden termed Solitude.</p>

  <p>Bonino had been to Dinkelsbuhl and brought back reports; his master had
  acted on them, but at leisure, with none of the ruthless haste with which the
  Englishman hastened upon pursuit.</p>

  <p>Signor Miola wondered now, searching his own heart, how much there was of
  caprice in this absenting of himself from his home, the duties of his
  station, the elaborate structure of his life, so well filled with intelligent
  activities. A shade of sadness came over his long, smooth comely face, as he
  watched the light withdraw from the landscape and the sky. He felt pity for
  the Englishman, respected him and wished him well out of his dreadful
  trouble&mdash;yet death alone would end that tragedy.</p>

  <p>The well kept road turned sharply to the south and Bonino, skilful at all
  he undertook, drove cleverly down the steep descent that led to the lonely,
  little-known valley of the Schappach, deep in the wildness of the forest. As
  the little carriage proceeded along the level road the thickly set trees shut
  out all sun, almost all light, from Florio San Quirico. He felt as enclosed
  as if he drove between high green walls.</p>

  <p>The carriage drove past a Gothic church at which Florio San Quirico
  glanced with pleasure. His taste was gratified by these South German churches
  with the windows painted in yellow and blue, the stone pulpits with lime-wood
  canopies, the shrines with the black figure in the tinselled robes, sparkling
  with sequins and tinsel, with gems and gold, the offerings of rich pilgrims,
  glittering in starry crowns, and the votive tablets depicting frightful
  disasters by land and sea. Such churches had, to the polished Italian, a
  childlike candour, even a crudity, that was agreeable after the elegance of
  his native edifices, cunning designs in light and space.</p>

  <p>He had seen the pilgrim churches on mountains with the winding avenues of
  chapels approaching them, and been moved by a faint, surprised reverence for
  what he had been led to believe were merely a dull superstition. He had
  watched the pilgrims, headed by priests, setting out from a humble village
  and had heard their rude, earnest hymns with more respect than he had
  listened to the brilliant music performed so beautifully in San Petronio.</p>

  <p>Not himself romantic, Florio San Quirico liked to encourage the romantic
  mood to which he was as sensitive as he was to every gracious aspect of human
  nature, and he indulged this now as the carriage drew up before the most
  modest and obscure of the Brunnen of the Forest, Rippoldsau.</p>

  <p>The establishment, the former hunting lodge of the Grand Duke of Baden,
  was a severe building, surrounded by a number of what appeared to be summer
  houses, but which in fact sheltered the fine cold mineral springs that the
  Badhaus offered to those in search of cures for skin diseases. The place
  appeared deserted, though the windows were open; in their shining panes the
  last light of the sun glinted red. At the sound of the carriage a dog barked
  and a man in a plain livery came round the side of the house, followed by an
  ostler.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico savoured the prospect. He was skilful with the pencil,
  as he was skilful with the lute, and the scene pleased him in its lonely and
  melancholy beauty. The silent grey house, the gleaming windows, the
  background of huge oaks and massive pines dark against a paling sky, the two
  men advancing, almost doubtfully, as if they were surprised to see strangers,
  composed a picture that the young Bolognese could rapidly have touched into
  his sketch book.</p>

  <p>He was amused to realize that he could be thus easily distracted from what
  he had tried to believe was an imperious purpose. Tried? Was that the key
  note of the episode? Was he forcing himself to a quest that had no true zest
  in it?</p>

  <p>He sighed lightly and descended from the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Are there rooms to be had for myself and my servants?" he asked with that
  agreeable courtesy that made him acceptable everywhere, yet left no doubt of
  his quality. The attendant of the Badhaus answered, yes, indeed; this place
  was little known, though the proprietor had made great improvements in it and
  the cold springs were excellent, but the season was nearly over.</p>

  <p>"I do not suffer from any ill that you can cure," smiled Florio San
  Quirico. "I would like to repose here for a short while."</p>

  <p>Bonino unstrapped the valise, and the ostler took the reins. The landlord
  appeared in the doorway to welcome this unexpected visitor to his
  establishment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>§ 9</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio San Quirico was given the best chamber in the house. It looked, by
  a tall window, on the Forest. The floor was tiled in dark red, the sparse
  furniture was of lime-wood; from the tester of the bed hung white linen
  curtains; the room had an ascetic air, as if it belonged to a recluse who
  meditated in loneliness. There was a shelf of books in gold tooled leather,
  with ties of pink floss silk hanging beneath the spines.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," thought the Bolognese, "some lonely student left them
  here."</p>

  <p>His own appointments, few but beautiful and costly, looked conspicuous in
  the clean, gaunt room, sweet from the pine odours of the Forest, as did his
  tall elegant figure in the plain yet rich travelling attire, his auburn hair
  fastened by a silver gilt buckle of intricate design, reflected (as if a
  creature of another world) in the long, tarnished mirror.</p>

  <p>He leaned in the window place and gazed into the fragrant darkness of the
  dense trees that were immobile in the stillness of the night. Above sparkled
  the stars in a remote pallor of pale light.</p>

  <p>"Why not," he thought, playing with his mood, "leave them to their
  destiny? They are all passionate&mdash;one is foolish&mdash;caught in a web.
  Why not let them be?"</p>

  <p>"Leave them to their destiny." What did he mean by that easy phrase, he
  asked himself. What was their destiny, and how could he influence it? The
  answer was easy. He had already influenced it when he had sent Mr. Campion to
  Schaffhausen; he would further influence it when he presented himself at
  Wilhelmsruhe. He was sufficiently detached from their fortunes to be able to
  direct them. He felt the power of the puppet master who pulls the strings.
  There had been no satisfaction in sending the blundering Englishman to
  Switzerland; there would be some satisfaction in breaking up the artful
  extravaganza the fugitives had invented. And more in having them at his
  mercy. He had penetrated their disguises as soon as he had had Bonino's
  report from Dinkelsbuhl. He was amused by the obtuseness of the pursuer who
  had been under the same roof with the pursued and not known it, completely
  deceived by a wig, and a mask, by the change of master into man.</p>

  <p>It was a clever trick, no doubt, and one that might have baffled any one
  not closely interested in the fugitives, but that it would not even have
  aroused the suspicions of Mr. Campion, was to Florio San Quirico, not only
  astonishing, it was ridiculous. Yet that word was not to be associated with
  the heavy, manly and dignified personage who had, in such desperate emotion
  so haughtily controlled, spoken with him at Bode's in Stuttgart.</p>

  <p>He was relieved by the pine air of the Forest, flowing over him as he
  pushed the casement wider. The weather had been hot, redolent of the hot
  perfumes of the vintage that the citizens of Stuttgart declared caused a
  nervous malaise in the city surrounded by terrace on terrace of vines, now
  come to full fruitage.</p>

  <p>There was some caution in his nature and he had been precisely taught to
  consider well before he took any action; some philosophy, too, he possessed
  and he knew that Bonino's entreaties were justified. Florio San Quirico had
  many noble obligations and agreeable duties awaiting him in Bologna. He had
  never irked at his life, though perhaps a certain weariness likely to the
  affliction of a man who kept himself apart from the tumults of a restless
  age, full of wars, revolutions and conflicts. He partly despised himself that
  he did not go abroad to some theatre of turmoil and there receive his
  quietus. For him there was yet no final riddance of malaise, even though his
  escape from Bologna had so utterly changed his life.</p>

  <p>A dreamy lassitude overcame him. He had sent
  Bonino to bed in the closet. The house seemed deserted, the chamber even
  emptier than the usual impersonal room of an inn. Was this Helen worth this
  siege of this Troy? He had almost persuaded himself that for him she was the
  very quiddity of life, but <i>almost</i> only.</p>

  <p>The two candles on the dressing table burnt straightly in the unmoving
  air; their reflections in the oval mirror made four points of light in the
  high ceilinged, bare room. Here was but one of the toys with which he had
  been wont to beguile himself. In his valise was a packet of sealed letters
  that had been forwarded to him through Papal nuncios on the first stages of
  his flight. Bonino had collected these without any hint as to the whereabouts
  of his master, who had never opened them. He knew from whom they came,
  members of his family, from friends at the University, at the Academies of
  Arts and Learning. Now, for some while, there had been no letters following;
  all trace of him had been lost in his native town.</p>

  <p>He thought now of his brick arcaded palace in Bologna and of the Villa
  Aria where, from the flat roof, the gaze could range from the Apennines to
  the Adriatic, with some nostalgia. As he blew out the candles, he seemed to
  extinguish hopes. He felt chilled from the night air that had been so
  refreshing after the close mustiness of the vintage heat at Stuttgart, took
  off his coat and lay on the strange bed with a sigh, his head aching, and his
  heart empty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>§ 10</h2>

  <p class="first">Bonino discovered that his master had a fever, an inflamed throat, a
  slight return of the quinsy that had afflicted him at Stuttgart.</p>

  <p>Josef Gutke, the nervous young physician attached to the Badhaus, declared
  that Florio San Quirico, whom he knew as Signor Miola, was too ill to travel.
  The young Bolognese knew this to be the case, and resigned himself to a short
  sojourn at Rippoldsau. The enforced delay did not altogether displease him.
  His quarry was in the net that could be drawn close whenever he chose.</p>

  <p>They must remain at Wilhelmsruhe for some time or attract attention. They
  would live, for some while, in dread of the return of Mr. Campion, for they
  could not know that he had never had any suspicions of them now that he was
  across the frontier. To support the fantastic tale they had told, they must
  remain in the Forest, playing the difficult parts they had assigned
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"He is a clever scoundrel," thought Florio San Quirico, who himself
  enjoyed bizarre intentions, "and has succeeded in deceiving others sharper
  than the Englishman. But it will go ill with his nature to play the
  hermit."</p>

  <p>Bonino travelled the scattered farms in the Forest and brought back gossip
  for his master. Casimir Weissnix, landlord of the Badhaus, also had a tale to
  tell. In this deep secluded valley, in the loneliest part of the Forest, it
  had been matter for much comment among the few inhabitants that Wilhelmsruhe
  had been let. This small hunting box was on the property of the Grand Duke of
  Baden and had been bought by Herr Weissnix with the larger lodge he now used
  as the Badhaus. It was he, therefore, who had let Wilhelmsruhe to Madame Daun
  by means of an attorney in Dinkelsbuhl.</p>

  <p>The long deserted place had been in need of repair and Martin, Madame
  Daun's confidential steward, had interviewed Herr Weissnix who had visited
  Willemsruhe for this purpose.</p>

  <p>His last guest had now departed, and he kept his establishment open merely
  to please the Bolognese, who paid lavishly. He, too, had his story to add to
  the fables that people the Forest. Not denying his native town, he related
  that he had been sent by the University of Bologna to Germany and Austria to
  search for rare coins for their cabinet of curiosities owned by that
  venerable seat of learning. He was crossing the Forest in order to visit a
  <i>schloss</i> whose owner had promised him the first choice of some coins of
  the Wurtemberg minted, of Ulm and a few of the Palatinate at Tubingen, some
  of these rarities being nearly a thousand years old.</p>

  <p>Herr Weissnix accepted this story without quibble; he was pleased with the
  visit of the young nobleman (so he thought of Signor Miola) to his not very
  successful establishment and willing, when the first exasperations and
  languors of his guest's illness had passed, to talk to him about the new
  tenants of Wilhelmsruhe. He was himself a native of Stuttgart, and his
  enterprise in purchasing this, the most isolated and neglected of the Brunnen
  of South Germany, had meant exile to him. He was a widower with a boy, his
  sole hope, at the University of Wurtemberg, for whom he had made, with his
  savings and a lottery prize, this speculation. He had been employed for most
  of his life at the Marstall in Stuttgart, and in the breeding of the pure
  Arabian horses that were celebrated throughout Europe. A riding accident had
  lamed him and decided him, with his luck at the lottery, on the purchase of
  Bad Rippoldsau.</p>

  <p>This modest and truthful tale amused Florio San Quirico, as it was in such
  keen contrast to the fanciful fictions with which he was surrounded, and with
  the dark, beautiful and melancholy scenery of the vale of the Schappach,
  inhabited by a few peasants and farmers living in fantastic rustic dwellings,
  and wearing costumes that to the taste of the Bolognese were grotesque.</p>

  <p>Herr Weissnix, however, was not averse from the romantic aspect of life
  though this had never come his own way. He had been greatly excited by the
  hiring of Wilhelmsruhe and was delighted to recount this adventure to Signor
  Miola.</p>

  <p>The Bolognese sat in the hot sunshine, in a cushioned chair, outside the
  plain façade of the Badhaus, his throat still bandaged, his face pallid, his
  attitude languid, and listened with an interest he was well able to conceal,
  to the landlord's gossip. At his guest's invitation, Herr Weissnix had a
  tankard of clear Bavarian beer before him that he drank as he detailed his
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"The story was all over Dinkelsbuhl&mdash;just over the Bavarian frontier,
  you know, sir&mdash;and whispered only, that this Madame Daun is a French
  princess in hiding; the people in the Forest think the same."</p>

  <p>"What have they to go upon, in crediting the incredible?" asked Florio San
  Quirico, who very well knew the answer. He still spoke with difficulty, in a
  hoarse voice, and Herr Weissnix glanced at him kindly and continued, hoping
  to dispel the other's boredom.</p>

  <p>"Ah, there is so much to spread the story. The lady, who gives the name of
  Madame Daun, has confided in her maid, an Austrian, one Adriana Beheim, and a
  sober, strait-laced woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And she has confided it to everyone with whom she speaks?"</p>

  <p>"No, she is discreet. But such a situation cannot be long concealed,"
  replied Herr Weissnix, with a knowing look. "Imagine, a princess! And after
  such a life of torment!"</p>

  <p>"She must have had some excellent friends to connive at this elaborate
  deception."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," agreed the Badhaus keeper, ingenuously. "One does not know
  all the tale. She was in exile, in a Swiss convent, one understands she was
  sunk in melancholy, somewhat unsettled in her wits; when she heard of her
  proposed marriage to her cousin, a disagreeable man, son of her mother's
  mortal enemy, she fled."</p>

  <p>"With whom, and by what means?"</p>

  <p>"O, one does not know everything, of course. She might have had English
  help&mdash;certainly the Duchess of Wurtemberg is English, and this lady has
  the Duke's letter of protection."</p>

  <p>"We reach high politics," smiled the Bolognese. "I find this a fable well
  suited, my dear Herr Wiessnix, to your superb Forest."</p>

  <p>"No, no," returned the other quickly, though with deference. "This has
  nothing to do with tales of lorelei, elves and goblins, robber barons or
  exile kings, but with real people. Incredible? I do not know about that,
  seeing what has happened in the last few years, since '89&mdash;what one has
  seen in one's own life time."</p>

  <p>"However, I do not believe that the daughter of the late King of France is
  in hiding at Wilhelmsruhe."</p>

  <p>"The resemblance is unmistakable," replied Herr Weissnix. "I spoke apart
  with the chamber woman&mdash;she was only engaged in Vienna, but she is
  convinced of the truth of the claim. She told me she had seen a signature in
  a prayer book, a sketch of the late Queen of France, fleur-de-lys on a
  chemise, a book marker with the same emblem."</p>

  <p>"If the lady is this princess, who, then, is Martin? This confidential
  servant? And is one to suppose that she travelled alone with this servant,
  from Switzerland?"</p>

  <p>"We are not far from the frontier."</p>

  <p>"You think, then, they came direct to Dinkelsbuhl?"</p>

  <p>"That would not be the direct route, sir; no doubt they turned and twisted
  on their way, but I think that a few weeks ago they were in Switzerland."</p>

  <p>"I see," smiled the Bolognese. "It is certainly a pretty mystery. They
  have money?"</p>

  <p>"Anything is paid for lavishly."</p>

  <p>"And how is it that this illustrious female is not missed?"</p>

  <p>"She is&mdash;but to escape scandal, the whole affair is kept quiet, and
  her family try to induce her to return by secret means, or even to have her
  abducted, while a friend takes her place in the seclusion of the
  convent."</p>

  <p>"Have they not been followed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I believe so. A man came to the Drei Mohren, where they were
  staying, but the host described them falsely, and he left within a few hours.
  It may be he is at Stuttgart watching them&mdash;they live so very
  secluded."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen this lady?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she is never present when I visit Wilhelmsruhe, and that is
  seldom."</p>

  <p>"But you remarked on the likeness?"</p>

  <p>"I have the word of the maid for that." Herr Weissnix was confident of the
  truth of his gossip. When pressed by Florio for details of this remarkable
  story he glossed over all difficulties by asserting that certainly there were
  mysteries, certainly there was much left unexplained, but one was dealing
  with a piteous feminine caprice, with the actions of a very young woman whose
  wits had been disturbed, perhaps fatally, by suffering, who had loyal friends
  eager to respect and shelter her desire for a retreat from the world, a loss
  of identity and an unknown death.</p>

  <p>The landlord of the Badhaus capped his argument by declaring that the Duke
  of Bavaria and the Duke of Wurtemberg were cognisant of the lady's secret and
  were helping her to protect it; obviously, everything had been made easy for
  her eccentric retirement.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that she appealed to these two courts?"</p>

  <p>"I do not suppose her capable of any such effort, sir. Martin would do
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Ah, this Martin! Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Herr Weissnix did not know. He liked to think that the steward, courier or
  servant was some great personage, perhaps some royal prince in disguise. "He
  wears a mask."</p>

  <p>Florio knew this but affected surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is common enough since the war&mdash;wounds or disease have disfigured
  him, sir. It is no vizard he wears, but a false face of silk taffeta, lined,
  he told me, with ointment. He takes it off at night."</p>

  <p>"What age would you take him to be?" asked Florio.</p>

  <p>"Forty years or so, maybe older. I suppose the lady would be no more than
  twenty years."</p>

  <p>"So," mused the Bolognese, "legends grow into monstrous blooms from tiny
  seeds. Perhaps in a hundred years time this tale will be repeated&mdash;of
  the mysterious French princess fleeing here to die in solitude, attended by
  her faithful servant."</p>

  <p>Indeed, so strong was the atmosphere of the Forest that Florio himself,
  solitary, weakened by illness, cut off from all the normal influences of
  life, was tempted to toy with belief in this fiction that had a melancholy
  charm, not in keeping with the character of the inventor.</p>

  <p>The Forest was so large; the castles on the height that rose above it, the
  farms and cottages in the valleys that divided it, so remote from one
  another; the lordly hunting boxes so secluded, stretches of the woodland so
  dense and dark, that even the sceptical intelligence of the highly educated
  Bolognese was in abeyance, and the romantic side of his nature, which he
  delighted, now and then, to arouse, was indulged.</p>

  <p>He had often read with satiric amusement, the horrible German novels of
  spectres and warlocks, so fashionable in a society that ignored the
  commonplace terrors of every day, but here they seemed neither diverting nor
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Herr Weissnix, drawn out on the subject, did not disguise his belief in
  the reputation of the Forest, so ancient, so little touched by man, so gloomy
  in the pathless depths of the trees where a traveller could be lost for days,
  so full of radiance in the open valleys. Almost Florio began to credit the
  incredible story of the fugitives at Wilhelmsruhe, almost to suppose that he
  was mistaken as to their identity.</p>

  <p>When Herr Weissnix ceased talking, a hush that seemed more than silence
  was over this solitary place. The sunshine lay undisturbed on the space of
  grass before the tall grey house, on the quiet mansion itself, so changed
  from its purpose and emptied of its splendour, in the tops of the elms and
  pines of the encroaching Forest that rose against a blue-gold sky, where
  dense white clouds were driven slowly across the valley by an upper wind.</p>

  <p>Florio felt half stifled, even feverish; he turned his gaze from the trees
  on his right hand, to the opening spread of the valley before him, shut in by
  the steep peaks of the Kniebis, a hollow filled by a burning light, through
  which showed the radiant shapes of distant foliage shining in the sun. This
  landscape, unfamiliar, yet of a character common to dreams, seemed to Florio
  to convey to him more vividly than any words could, his own mood. The very
  brilliancy of that opening vista emphasized the pause he had come to in his
  own life and his sense of severance from his former splendid and carefree
  existence.</p>

  <p>There stole over him, seated there in the sunshine, the quietude of the
  lonely night watch, the desolation of the sleepless night. The masks that had
  haunted him in his fevered dreams at Stuttgart, the hallucinations arising
  from half memories of childhood's toys and puppets, faintly troubled him now.
  As he closed his hot lids, he saw the heavy, passionate visage of Mr.
  Campion, the fine features of Letty, a turquoise ribbon through her red hair,
  the clumsy plaster mask of the servant Martin, and his own face, a dim
  reflection in a blotched mirror. He was startled, almost stupefied by the
  sight of himself in his thick day-dream and roused as Herr Weissnix
  exclaimed: "Sir, you are ill! I shall summon your servant!"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Florio, quickly. "I have been idle too long&mdash;this
  quinsy has weakened me, but I desire no aid. Who," he added with a thrill of
  unpleasant conjecture, "is that approaching along the Forest path?"</p>

  <p>The landlord of the Badhaus, who had already risen, looked at the horseman
  coming towards them and recognized the plaster white face beneath the
  wide-brimmed hat.</p>

  <p>Florio, who had, from his quick agitation, regained his regal self
  possession, rose and turned towards the house.</p>

  <p>"Do not mention my presence here, I beg you. I am not well enough to be
  disturbed by anyone's misfortunes."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir, I shall not divulge I have a guest&mdash;the
  establishment is supposed to be closed for the season."</p>

  <p>Florio gained his room before the horseman had reined up at the door, and
  stood at the tall window, concealed by the long curtain, gazing down on the
  messenger from Wilhelmsruhe as he had gazed down on Mr. Campion in the
  Schlossstrasse hastily making preparations to depart for Schaffhausen. His
  sense of oppression had lifted, he forgot his weakness and the menace there
  had seemed to be in the dark woods and the shining valley. His feeling of
  power returned. It was one of his puppets below, leaning from his horse,
  speaking to Herr Weissnix, his body in the trim livery, light against the
  sombre wood, the taffeta silk plaster hiding his face. Yet that blank mask,
  with slit for mouth and holes for eyes, had an expression, it seemed to the
  careful watcher, one of both fury and misery.</p>

  <p>After brief speech with the landlord of the Badhaus, the rider turned and
  took his way slowly along the narrow bridle path that penetrated the Forest.
  Not disguising his curiosity that passed, he hoped, as the whim of a sick man
  enduring a tedious interlude, Florio descended the stairs and spoke to Herr
  Weissnix in the passage.</p>

  <p>"So that is this strange lackey who behaves like a knight errant&mdash;a
  noble figure, I should have thought his age less than forty years."</p>

  <p>"O, he is that, at least. He remembers the lady in her infancy. She is
  ill, and he entreated me to send Dr. Gutke to attend her."</p>

  <p>"Sick of a melancholy&mdash;it would be charity to rescue her from this
  unnatural life and restore her to her family, or, if she has none, at least
  to society."</p>

  <p>"Did she not come here to die?" asked the landlord of the Badhaus,
  simply.</p>

  <p>"Young ladies have made such sentimental resolves before now, and outgrown
  them. Are you sending the physician?"</p>

  <p>"To-day, sir. This afternoon he was to have returned to Stuttgart, you no
  longer requiring his attention, but first he will undertake this duty."</p>

  <p>Florio watched the awkward young doctor of medicine depart on his quiet
  nag through the Forest, for Wilhelmsruhe, and felt a return of mounting
  excitement in the game he played with these other people, a game that
  involved their lives.</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion had spoken of her illness, probably not believing in it
  himself, now there was this further deception. She was unlikely to be
  ill&mdash;at Bologna she had bloomed with strength and grace&mdash;why this
  pretence, this bringing in of the shy young physician, poor and timid,
  earning his first fees in this post at the most neglected of the Brunnen?</p>

  <p>Over Florio's musing face came the shadow of a disturbing doubt. If this
  report were true and not some ruse?</p>

  <p>Possibly she might be suffering, as he was, from some trifling malaise
  brought on by the heavy fermented sweetness of the grape harvest.' Yet she
  might be assailed, as others as young and strong had been, by a deadly
  ill.</p>

  <p>This doubt shook him and he felt, what he had always warned to himself,
  the foolish, shrinking dread mortals have of death.</p>

  <p>If she should die? What then?</p>

  <p>Did those two questions form the touchstone of what was the quality of his
  feeling for her?</p>

  <p>Florio could not answer them. He put them aside, assuring himself that
  this pretended illness was a trick, for what end he could not discover.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>§ 11</h2>

  <p class="first">When Dr. Gutke returned, late that afternoon, to the Badhaus, Florio did
  not disdain to be present in the large public parlour and to listen to the
  landlord discreetly question him. The lady, this Madame Daun, as she termed
  herself, was his tenant, her position was peculiar, could he be of any
  service to her? Did she intend to stay long at Wilhelmsruhe? The nervous
  young physician was unsure of his ground. He had not discovered any symptoms
  of any illness known to him in the languid lady; her pulse, her heart, her
  lungs offered no hint of danger, but her spirits were very sunk and the
  chamber woman said that she fainted continually.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gutke had left advice and medicine at Wilhelmsruhe. He could not, he
  declared, again visit the isolated hunting box, he was obliged to return to
  Stuttgart, though the fee offered to him by Madame Daun had been so high that
  he had refused to take more than half of it. "I have no desire," he admitted,
  "to be involved in this mystery."</p>

  <p>Florio endeavoured to learn from him the details of this strange
  establishment, but he seemed afraid of speaking, and soon made an awkward
  withdrawal.</p>

  <p>"You observe," remarked the landlord of the Badhaus with a certain
  triumph, "how he has been impressed. Ah, how regrettable that he must
  depart&mdash;who, then, will succour this poor creature? I do not care for my
  responsibility in this perplexing affair."</p>

  <p>"If this stranger is under the protection of your reigning prince he will
  see to her needs," replied Florio, with an indifference not altogether
  assumed.</p>

  <p>He was vexed at his own lassitude that prevented him from at once visiting
  Wilhelmsruhe, but he had not the strength or the spirit for that enterprise
  that would have to be so delicately conducted. He felt weary and depressed,
  unwilling to ascend to the austere alien chamber; he, as all others in this
  comedy of travellers, was beginning to feel an acute distaste at this moving
  from place to place in foreign countries, with no contact with the normal
  life that flowed past them without more than a stare or a prying question. He
  could not sleep in the austere bed, yet dreams passed rapidly before his
  wakeful eyes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>§ 12</h2>

  <p class="first">Four days after the visit of Martin to the Badhaus Florio San Quirico
  walked to Wilhelmsruhe.</p>

  <p>He found this modest house in a small clearing from which the trees
  receded in a semi-circle in front. A stone dog crouched either side of the
  narrow door; the windows were open and the thin muslin curtains hung
  straightly in the still air. Behind, the Forest was thick and silent, even
  overhead only flecks of sky were visible and these seemed remote behind the
  interlaced branches of high oaks and elms.</p>

  <p>At one window was a cluster of flowers, late roses, dahlias and
  carnations, red and yellow in a porcelain jar.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico guessed that this was her chamber. He hoped that she
  might appear, he wished to see her thus naturally, not in a situation of
  constraint and deception. Therefore he waited, silent, noiseless, in the
  motionless shadows of the trees. As he watched he saw a horse, a bright bay,
  and not that ridden by Martin on his visit to the Badhaus, fastened to a
  bough of a pine tree growing at the farther side of the house, and as he
  speculated on this, the narrow door opened and a figure appeared whom he
  recognized instantly. It was Mr. Campion.</p>

  <p>At this sight, so utterly unexpected, Florio felt the keenest humiliation
  of his life; he stood at a loss, then, without consideration, was retreating
  between the trees when the Englishman saw him and hailed him in a subdued
  voice, and with a slowly raised hand.</p>

  <p>Florio remained silent, responding only by a bow, for he had not decided
  what he should do. Mr. Campion approached him and, instead of speaking to him
  with the indignant hostility he expected, said, in a low tone, speaking
  English: "I did you a wrong, sir, when I reached Schaffhausen and they were
  not there, nor had been. I believed you were in league with them to deceive
  me."</p>

  <p>"Never, I do assure you."</p>

  <p>"So I now perceive&mdash;but why are you here?"</p>

  <p>"As I did not recover quickly from my illness, I came to Rippoldsau to
  rest," replied Florio, regaining his usual readiness. "To-day I walk in the
  Forest, urged here, I confess, by some curiosity&mdash;an idler hears
  gossip."</p>

  <p>"I understand, indeed, I must ask your pardon for my suspicion."</p>

  <p>They were walking from the silent house, Florio stepping the pace and the
  direction. Completely baffled, he felt his way with a nervous caution that
  made him tremble. He was not yet strong and this meeting with Mr. Campion had
  profoundly shocked him. The Englishman spoke rapidly, incoherently, too
  absorbed in his story to notice his companion. Florio understood that, not
  finding the fugitives at Schaffhausen and hearing no news of them, his
  suspicions had returned to the man who had set him, as it seemed,
  deliberately on the wrong scent, and he had returned to Stuttgart to face
  Signor Miola. But the Bolognese had departed from Bode's without leaving an
  address, and Mr. Campion's attention had been diverted by hearing from others
  that a couple named Latymer had recently left Stuttgart&mdash;thus
  exonerating from complete falsehood Signor Miola. Dates and times of arrival
  and departure Mr. Campion could not discover, but his inquiries at the
  English Residency had set him again towards Dinkelsbuhl. For the first time
  he realized that Madame Daun might indeed be the woman whom he was seeking.
  It was not difficult to trace the mysterious couple to their retreat in
  Wilhelmsruhe.</p>

  <p>"So I came here, sir, and it is not they."</p>

  <p>Florio found this as astonishing as the appearance of Mr. Campion
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Who, then, are they?" he asked carefully. "I have heard some odd tales at
  Rippoldsau."</p>

  <p>"The odd tale is true. This unhappy lady was a French fugitive&mdash;of
  royal birth."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion paused in the shade where Florio had drawn him. The silence of
  the woods was heavy, Florio felt oppressed, he almost wondered if he had to
  deal with one unsettled in his wits.</p>

  <p>"You are satisfied that these people are not those you sought?" he asked,
  precisely.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely satisfied," replied the other with solemn fervour. "These are
  not those who were passing under the name of Latymer."</p>

  <p>"I am relieved that you are convinced of this, that you do not accuse me
  of deliberately misleading you, my dear sir. What object could I have in
  assisting this eccentric lady who has inherited an estate in Hampshire?"
  Florio spoke with a touch of mockery that helped the Englishman to recover
  his composure and to remember the fictions he had invented to conceal his
  real purpose.</p>

  <p>"The travellers you saw must be those I seek," he declared. "Why, you gave
  the description, the name&mdash;there was the dressing case&mdash;but they
  did not go to Schaffhausen."</p>

  <p>"They may have turned off the road at Donauschingen," replied Florio. "And
  you have wasted time in returning to Stuttgart, and to the Forest."</p>

  <p>"That is true," admitted Mr. Campion, bitterly. "I am not suited nor used
  to this kind of work," he added, forgetting that he had claimed to be a
  lawyer, "but a plain man. It was clear to me that you must have seen them,
  from your description, and I confess I suspected an ally. I recalled, I know
  not why, the couple at Dinkelsbuhl. I said to myself, 'After all, I never saw
  that woman, her hair might have been false; the landlord might have lied!
  Then this servant, masked.'"</p>

  <p>Florio was astonished at the slow wits that had taken so long to come to a
  conclusion he would himself instantly have reached. He felt drawn into the
  labyrinth of the other's stupidity.</p>

  <p>"Why should this lady disguise the colour of her hair, and her
  lackey&mdash;or is it husband&mdash;wear a mask?" he asked mischievously.</p>

  <p>"She is&mdash;eccentric," replied Mr. Campion, hastily and clumsily. "I
  regret that I cannot explain. And I was wrong, they were not the&mdash;those
  I sought."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was received with simple dignity."</p>

  <p>"You <i>saw</i> them?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the courier who goes by the name of Martin."</p>

  <p>"But not without the taffeta mask?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, poor fellow, he no longer has any reason to wear it. He is
  disfigured, pitted, but I have seen more horrible scars."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Florio, looking sternly with his topaz
  coloured glance at the heavy, congested face of the Englishman. "You said the
  lady <i>was</i> French&mdash;you add that her servant has no reason
  <i>now</i> to wear a mask?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that the lady is dead," said Mr. Campion. "I have looked on her
  grave. Come, I shall show it to you. I admit that, even in my own absorption,
  I am moved by so much sorrow falling on one so blameless."</p>

  <p>"Who showed you this grave?"</p>

  <p>The tone of this question was so sharp that the Englishman replied
  cautiously:</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I never thought you would be interested&mdash;and it is
  strange to find you here, to meet you twice at crucial moments."</p>

  <p>"Travellers who wander in South Germany&mdash;a small compass&mdash;are
  likely to meet one another again and again. I was ill and idle, and came to
  Rippoldsau to repose. The landlord of the Badhaus owns this deserted hunting
  box and told me the gossip about the tenants."</p>

  <p>"That sounds reasonable," admitted Mr. Campion, and for the first time
  looked closely at Florio San Quirico, who so far had been a vague figure
  indeed to his preoccupied mind. He saw a quiet young man of undoubtedly good
  breeding, who gave no offence, either in manner or clothes, to the
  Englishman's conservatism, and he added: "You do not appear like a spy or an
  agent. Her family tried to have her abducted, you know. Well, never mind.
  Whoever you are does not concern me, and you are too late, if you meant her
  mischief."</p>

  <p>"I certainly mean no evil to anyone," said Florio. "Your story startles
  me. Truly it is no concern of mine, but here, in the solitude&mdash;yes, I
  recall that the park about Wilhelmsruhe is named Solitude&mdash;such a
  piteous tale sounds ghastly. Of what did this unhappy creature die? I heard
  she was but twenty years of age."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion turned abruptly to the right, between the trees, drawing
  Florio after him by a hand on his cloak.</p>

  <p>This part of the Forest had been cleared to make a pleasure park for the
  moody whim of a former Grand Duke of Baden, who had wished to indulge his
  melancholy humour by a complete seclusion. Lawns had been laid out, walks
  cut, and between the closely-growing oaks a <i>haupt allée</i> had been made,
  straight from the front of Wilhelmsruhe into the depth of the Forest.</p>

  <p>Into this the two men, so strangely met and so dissimilar in everything,
  entered from the short path chosen by Mr. Campion.</p>

  <p>Florio now perceived that his first sight of the house had been from the
  back. He now looked on the front that faced the <i>haupt allée.</i> The
  windows were shuttered; the place appeared gloomy, as if all life had long
  left it. The whole estate, once cultivated with much expense, was neglected;
  the lawns overgrown with weeds, the trees choked with undergrowth, the avenue
  damp and soft with moss. The whole scene had an air of unreality to Florio:
  green and grey, even in the sunny afternoon, the house and its surroundings
  seemed a reflection in stagnant water or a blurred mirror.</p>

  <p>"Have they gone?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The maid, one Adriana Beheim, returned to Vienna yesterday."</p>

  <p>"By what stages?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, nor does it matter. When I arrived here expecting to
  confront <i>them,</i> those whom I sought, I mean to find them here, there
  was but this servant, Martin, shutting up the place. He will take the keys to
  Rippoldsau to-day, he says."</p>

  <p>"Why have you brought me here?"</p>

  <p>"Come with me, along this track, now it is no more than that, once it was
  a path&mdash;see."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion pointed to a baroque summer house at the end of the overgrown
  path that ran between the high trees. This little temple-like building was
  painted in blue and yellow; large gilt shells surrounded the cupola, and gilt
  pilasters divided the alcoves in which stood images of plaster
  <i>amorini.</i> Once the charming little pleasure house had been gay, now the
  paint was faded and peeling, the glass in the windows cracked, a tangle of
  bramble showed dark green leaves, fox red stems and purple fruit round the
  porch of the open door. The whole edifice was densely shadowed by the foliage
  of foreign shrubs, once carefully planted here to give an air of elegance to
  this remote bower, now overgrown and rising in unpruned masses to shut out
  the light.</p>

  <p>The ground before the summer house was newly trodden, the moss bore the
  imprint of feet, the weeds were trampled.</p>

  <p>"Why do you bring me here?" asked Florio, furtively watching the other
  man, who pushed the half-open door of the summer house wider.</p>

  <p>"Look for yourself."</p>

  <p>Florio approached and glanced over the Englishman's shoulder. The interior
  of the summer house was musty and close; the woodwork of the interior had
  rotted in places, the seat that ran round the wall had fallen away, the light
  was very dim, as the boughs of the shrubs blocked and thrust through the
  broken windows. Florio saw at once that a grave occupied the full length of
  the floor, and that above it was placed a roughly-cut wooden cross.</p>

  <p>"This is what was shown me by the faithful fellow, Martin. Upon my word,
  it is a sad story."</p>

  <p>A paper was nailed to the cross; bending forward Florio read: "Here lies a
  Princess of France and a broken heart. Leave in peace this demoiselle who had
  not reached the age of twenty years and known nothing but sorrow."</p>

  <p>Florio drew back&mdash;like Mr. Campion, he had pulled off his hat. He
  left the summer house quickly.</p>

  <p>"There are many questions to be asked," he remarked softly. "Had she a
  physician, a chaplain? Who buried her in this unlikely place, the ground not
  consecrated?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied Mr. Campion. "Martin told me all was done by the
  protection of the Duke. A doctor of medicine came from Rippoldsau, where you
  stay; a pastor from the next village, I believe, came but she would be a
  Roman Catholic? Two woodmen helped to make the grave."</p>

  <p>"Will the good man from Bad Rippoldsau care to have it on his
  property?"</p>

  <p>"If the Duke bids him," answered Mr. Campion, with some impatience. "You
  hardly, sir, seem as moved as I am by this tragedy. Conceive that this poor
  exile fled, dying already, I suppose&mdash;I remember that she was ill at
  Dinkelsbuhl, her hair grey, so she was taken to be of middle age&mdash;and
  did die here, alone, save for this one servant and a hired woman."</p>

  <p>"What will this very faithful servant do?"</p>

  <p>"I asked him that," replied Mr. Campion simply, "and if he had means. He
  answered me that he had friends, and in high places, and funds."</p>

  <p>"Then he is well provided and all has been neatly contrived." To himself
  Florio added, "Do you as well, my friend."</p>

  <p>They had cleared the shadowed recess where the summer house stood, the
  undergrowth, the trees, and stood again in the <i>haupt allée,</i> moss
  grown, silent, leading to the silent grey house with the closed door and
  shutters.</p>

  <p>"No sun could lighten this scene," murmured Mr. Campion, thus utterly
  betraying himself to the acute observer, who now knew him to be, like so many
  of his fellow countrymen, not altogether dense, by no means insensitive,
  though capable of stupidity and obstinacy, yet also sentimental. Much moved
  by this piteous episode in the annals of a ruined royal house that he had
  chanced on in his headlong quest across a ruined Europe, even his obsession
  had lifted for a while and the strong, heavy, sullen man showed gentleness in
  his voice and demeanour. "Now," thought Florio, "is the moment to save them
  all, this man in particular from his private hell."</p>

  <p>"I must return to Rippoldsau," said the Bolognese aloud. "And you, sir,
  you are mounted, I perceive."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion, startled and moved sharply, was alarmed from his
  abstraction.</p>

  <p>"I? I must return to Switzerland, since I have your word for it that they
  went that way."</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico felt uneasy. It was not fair that this fellow should
  trust him in a game, the very essence of which was intrigue, deception, an
  entire play of masks.</p>

  <p>"This incident has perturbed you," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. To arrive at this empty house, to be told this story, to be taken by
  the solitary servant to this solitary grave, I confess it made me consider
  that there are other sorrows in the world besides my own."</p>

  <p>"You have, then, sorrows?" asked Florio softly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that also I must confess."</p>

  <p>"You need not to me. I am aware that you are no lawyer or man of business.
  You travel on some affair of honour."</p>

  <p>At this the Englishman stiffened.</p>

  <p>"If it were so, I could not speak of it. I have taken your
  word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I made no oath."</p>

  <p>"You told me that you had seen <i>them,</i> in Stuttgart."</p>

  <p>"That is true. But I might easily have been mistaken in supposing they
  went to Switzerland. I did not take the matter seriously enough to be
  positive about it."</p>

  <p>So saying, Florio moved towards the house, the Englishman beside him.
  Beams of sunshine, falling between the boughs of the high dark trees, waved
  across the two men in their plain travelling clothes, walking slowly, their
  hats in their hands. Time seemed at a standstill in this remote place,
  neither past nor future existed, and the present was dim.</p>

  <p>"Why did you return to the house," asked Florio, "once you had seen her
  grave?"</p>

  <p>"I was overborne, I desired to rest awhile. Martin, this lackey, was
  civil."</p>

  <p>"What he has done is illegal, perhaps wrong."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of that," replied the Englishman with a touch of
  impatience. "The Duke answers for him, as I suppose. And where are the laws
  in Europe now?"</p>

  <p>"You have found that? Yet you obey a law, I think."</p>

  <p>"In my country we have had no war," replied the Englishman with
  unconscious arrogance. "Though so many of us went to fight on the continent.
  My business is my own and I must be upon it."</p>

  <p>Florio paused. He desired to save this stranger, whom he liked, from
  himself.</p>

  <p>"One cannot win victories in life as one can on a battle field," he said
  pleasantly. "One can hardly avert defeat&mdash;if one's heart, one's soul is
  engaged."</p>

  <p>"You speak as if you knew my affairs, and freely, yet you are by much the
  younger man."</p>

  <p>"But more the philosopher. Detached, resolved not to be involved in any
  blistering emotion, I am a little bored, too rich and not made for action. I
  shall not be brought down by the passions of others."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I might be?" asked Mr. Campion, hotly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. I would have you give up your quest. Make a break with
  everything sad and disagreeable, return to your proud and triumphant country
  and face the honours that await you."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked Mr. Campion abruptly.</p>

  <p>"A philosopher, I repeat. Petronio Miola, sent ahead by the University of
  Bologna to purchase medals." Florio's smile was re-assuring. "Do not dislike
  me because I happened to meet this lady who has inherited an estate in
  Hampshire."</p>

  <p>"You did not believe that," replied the Englishman, defiantly. "Well, I
  may be defeated, but I shall never betray myself. And I shall never be
  diverted from my purpose."</p>

  <p>"In another man that might sound like bravado," smiled Florio.</p>

  <p>"But you know that in me it does not."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless I advise you, I even beseech you to give up this quest. You
  are at a disadvantage in Europe, you speak very little of any foreign
  language&mdash;you may be misled, betrayed, if not by yourself, by
  others."</p>

  <p>"I travel alone. I give no one my confidence. Here, we have reached the
  house."</p>

  <p>"Is this faithful creature, Martin, a Frenchman?" asked Florio.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Assuredly, as you remarked," replied Mr. Campion stiffly,
  "I am a mean linguist. I have not, save at the Residences, conversed with
  anyone as fluently as with yourself, since I left England. This Martin speaks
  German fairly, as I should judge. French must be his native tongue; I could
  not say. He has weak, red eyes and is much pitted with the smallpox, caught,
  he says, when the Terrorists held him prisoner under the vilest possible
  conditions."</p>

  <p>"It would interest me to speak to him."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he is still in the house, but why should you concern yourself?"
  Mr. Campion spoke with a return of that forced suspicion with which he
  usually protected his native credulity.</p>

  <p>"Because I am idle, is not that already explained?"</p>

  <p>They had passed round the side of the house where Mr. Campion's bay horse
  was waiting.</p>

  <p>"Truly," remarked Florio, "this is the very heart of the Forest."</p>

  <p>"A quiet place," agreed Mr. Campion brusquely, he seemed about to hold out
  his hand, but to change his mind.</p>

  <p>"Listen to your generous impulses," murmured Florio, "I am sure you have
  them, you are a man to despise all that is mean and base, and vengeful."</p>

  <p>"I have not spoken that word."</p>

  <p>"You have distinction, lofty ideas, if anyone wronged you, I am sure you
  would disdain to punish them," persisted Florio in gentle tones. "It is
  impossible to disguise from one like myself, used to the elegancies of
  Bologna, that you are a man of high breeding, though you may not be
  discovered by these thick Germans."</p>

  <p>Mr. Campion had mounted the bay horse, that reared, restive from
  inactivity, as he grasped the reins. His heavy face bore an expression of
  poignant suffering, but he replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"The legal profession is, at least with us, one for gentlemen. May I
  return your candour? You are young, frivolous, brilliant; no doubt the ladies
  consider you charming. If I am not a man of business neither are you a poor
  scholar."</p>

  <p>A slight grimace distorted his noble features. Florio San Quirico lost his
  usual and graceful art of conversation at hearing himself described so
  clearly by one whom he had considered stupid. The word "frivolous" wounded
  him, but he could not doubt that it was justly applied nor that he deserved
  this sombre rebuke. But Mr. Campion's mood became sullen, indifferent; he
  appeared to have already forgotten the grave in the summer house that had for
  a while distracted him from his obstinate purpose.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico could do nothing more to stay him from his resolve. It
  would be a relief to see him ride away. This time their parting was likely to
  be for some long time, perhaps for ever. The Englishman had now been
  definitely checked, he was riding away into a wilderness of doubt and
  suspicion, into a labyrinth where he would have no clue and where he would be
  blinded by pride and agony.</p>

  <p>With a formal salute, he asked Florio exact directions to Stuttgart. "I
  could easily lose my way in the Forest," he admitted reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Or anywhere," smiled Florio, who had recovered his own bearing. And he
  indicated the overgrown bridle path through the Forest that led to Rippoldsau
  and then to Stuttgart.</p>

  <p>With no more than that, Mr. Campion rode away, and when he had watched the
  horseman disappear in the dark gloom of the Forest, Florio San Quirico came
  out quietly on to the back of the quiet house Wilhelmsruhe.</p>

  <p>The late summer flowers still stood in the vase on the sill of the open
  window. Nothing had altered during his conversation with Mr. Campion.</p>

  <p>Florio found the door unlatched and entered. The passage was narrow, and
  opened right and left to plain rooms with furniture cut from horn and stags'
  antlers on the walls painted a dull grey. There was no sign of any
  occupation. The Bolognese returned to the hall and ascended the stairs to the
  first landing. From there he entered the room with the open window and the
  vase of flowers.</p>

  <p>Here he found the person he was looking for, a man in a livery without
  facings, drawn up in a corner of the room, his expression alert and alarmed,
  his fingers plucking at a slouch hat that he pulled over his brows.</p>

  <p>"Who are you," asked Florio in German, and with considerable authority,
  "and who engaged you? Come forward and take off your hat."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed at once, revealing a face scarred by disease and inflamed
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I was hired in Nuremberg, a few weeks ago, sir," he replied with an
  accent and look of terror. "I have done nothing wrong. My service is
  ended&mdash;I was about to lock up the house, when this stranger came."</p>

  <p>"And you told him a fable you had been instructed to tell?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, sir, it is the truth."</p>

  <p>"Waste no words," commanded Florio, motioning the man into the centre of
  the room. "Are you alone in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, and eager to depart. But I waited, seeing that foreigner and
  you."</p>

  <p>"You were hiding from me. I have authority. You have lent yourself to what
  may be illegal. Perhaps to penalties and punishment. Tell me your story for
  your own sake."</p>

  <p>The servant, a little sullenly but with some uneasiness, tried to avoid
  all responsibility in the matter in which he had become involved.</p>

  <p>He had been engaged in Nuremberg, casually, as Adriana Beheim had been
  engaged in Vienna. He had been surprised at being offered a position as a
  body servant, for though he was well trained he had had to keep to stable
  work for several years, since the smallpox had disfigured him.</p>

  <p>"Who engaged you?" interrupted Florio. "And what is your own name?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke he moved to the door that he held open, so that he could see
  if anyone passed up or down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"I am named August," replied the servant, "and it is useless, sir, to
  stand sentinel. The house is empty."</p>

  <p>"Where have they gone?" demanded Florio.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," the man muttered. "They are under the Duke's
  protection."</p>

  <p>"Or so they say. I repeat, who engaged you?"</p>

  <p>It had been, came the reluctant confession, the matter of a bribe. August,
  who had held many occupations in his time, and done some soldiering in the
  late war, had been well chosen for the part he was to play in Wilhelmsruhe.
  He was unscrupulous, adroit and callous, as soon appeared in his recital. He
  was also baffled and frightened. He obviously wanted to get away and lose
  himself safely in the town where he had been found.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman engaged me," he admitted, "who said I was not to ask his
  name, he was French and I might speak of him as M. Nesle. The position was
  one of French refugees. After all, a common story&mdash;is not Europe now
  full of these wanderers? They had money. I found a sick lady here and a hired
  maid. I was told to take the name of Martin, and to ask no questions."</p>

  <p>"What manner of man was this M. Nesle?"</p>

  <p>"Uncommonly handsome. I had not much to do when I first came. The lady was
  shut up. The maid whispered to me that she was of royal blood. It was no
  business of mine. They seemed afraid of being discovered&mdash;all this was
  no business of mine. Some wood cutters came to Wilhelmsruhe&mdash;a solitary
  place! A priest once, so Adriana said, and a doctor whom I saw. Nothing
  strange in all this," added August, defiantly. "It was not for me to ask
  questions."</p>

  <p>Florio thought, "This comedy was taking place while I was idling in an
  illness at Rippoldsau."</p>

  <p>"Well, finish this tale," he said aloud.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what authority you have to ask it," grumbled August, "but it
  is soon told, and I want to get away before sunset. I don't like the Forest
  after dark."</p>

  <p>Florio left the door, crossed the room and seated himself on one of the
  stiff chairs; he felt an almost overwhelming lassitude. He had no horse and
  immediate pursuit was impossible, wherever they might be. He could only hear
  the story out and pick up what clues he might. He stared from the window at
  the tall motionless trees of the Forest that encircled the clearing before
  the house.</p>

  <p>"My master had spies about Nuremberg, I think, or else he received news
  from the court. He used to be away a good deal, and he was plainly in dread
  of someone. Adriana said the lady's relations would abduct her if they could
  find her. What was it to me? My master kept a silk plaster mask in his room,
  he said he wore it against the weather when crossing the Alps."</p>

  <p>"You go from the point," said Florio.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing much more to say. This Austrian woman became frightened,
  she said that her mistress was very sick indeed, then that she had died. The
  woodcutters brought a coffin, Adriana said, and she had seen the lady in it.
  Then Adriana was dismissed and sent by the stage wagon on her way to Vienna,
  I suppose."</p>

  <p>"What was your part in this?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," replied the other with a sly look. "A few days after the
  lady's death her body was buried in the summer house by the woodcutters, and
  my master. 'Do you,' he said, 'stay by me, for I am heart broken, and if
  anyone comes inquiring after us you can show him that grave and the
  inscription I put on it.'"</p>

  <p>"Was he expecting anyone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he seemed to fear that some enemy was close, and so he was, for I
  take that foreigner you met to be one&mdash;an enemy, I mean, to M.
  Nesle."</p>

  <p>"The Englishman?"</p>

  <p>"He was English? He spoke German, but slowly. I promised to stay here with
  M. Nesle for a while, and to take any intruder who might come to the grave.
  Truly death ends all things, even pursuit."</p>

  <p>"You must have been well paid for all this trouble."</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted August, "and frightened, too. I do not know who <i>he</i>
  is, nor who the Englishman is, nor who <i>you</i> are."</p>

  <p>"If you knew the solution of this mystery you would find it much simpler
  than you suppose," remarked Florio with a bitterness most unusual to him, but
  forced from him by fatigue and disappointment. He had not recovered as well
  from his illness as he had hoped. He trembled a little and his eyes ached.
  The darkness of the trees without seemed to weigh on his spirit. He wished
  that he could get away from Wilhelmsruhe, from the neglected park named
  Solitude, from the Forest.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday, M. Nesle told me," said August, "that he had heard his enemy,
  or one of them, was at Stuttgart and feared that he might have traced them
  here, so he rode off, where to I know not, and left me with my directions. I
  said I would stay until three o'clock. At half-past two this foreigner came
  up and I told him of the lady's death and showed him her grave."</p>

  <p>"He was disturbed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, with a painful passion. Remorse, perhaps, for hounding them. I
  brought him back to the house to give him a glass of wine. Then, as he left,
  I was watching from the window, where you are sitting now, sir, and I saw you
  come up."</p>

  <p>"Why did you hide, instead of telling <i>me</i> the tale and showing
  <i>me</i> the grave?" demanded Florio sternly.</p>

  <p>"It was past three o'clock," replied August sullenly, "and I'd had enough
  of this affair. I did not want to visit the summer house again. M. Nesle
  never said anything of <i>two</i> people."</p>

  <p>"Did you believe his story?"</p>

  <p>"What does it matter whether I believe it or not? I've done no wrong and
  I've been well paid."</p>

  <p>"And so the matter ends for you." Florio spoke thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied August, advancing and speaking curtly. "And you could not
  get anything more out of me."</p>

  <p>"Even if I paid you?"</p>

  <p>"No." The man was firm though frightened and knew when to stop dangerous
  work. "I won't be involved any further. I think it safer to disappear. It is
  lucky for me you came on foot, sir. I have a horse in the stables, I
  bargained for that."</p>

  <p>Florio thought, with annoyance, that he had indeed been foolishly casual
  when he had come over on foot from Rippoldsau. He had been so sure they were
  safely in the net that he could draw closer any moment he chose that he had
  been careless. For the first time in his life he had the sense of being
  outwitted, and by someone inferior to himself.</p>

  <p>"This business is not what you imagine," he said. "I have no more
  questions to ask. I knew that you were hiding here, the Englishman told me of
  a valet named Martin. I have discovered all that I wished to know. You lied,
  telling him you were taking the keys to Rippoldsau."</p>

  <p>August glanced at him slyly. He knew he had the advantage of the horse,
  and that this formidable stranger, whom he feared as he had never feared the
  Englishman, knew it also.</p>

  <p>Florio did not move from the window place. If he had known where the
  fugitive was he might have tried to gain possession of the horse by force.
  But he loathed violence and would never use it save in extremity.</p>

  <p>"Your master awaits you in Nuremberg," he said. "You would not have
  concerned yourself to wait here to show a possible visitor this secret grave,
  had you not been promised a bribe."</p>

  <p>"I told you, sir, I have been paid already," replied August, sullenly and
  edging towards the door.</p>

  <p>"But on your report you will be paid more. You are a shrewd rascal. And
  the man who employs you is not witless. When, and only when, you describe
  this Englishman, will you receive a further fee."</p>

  <p>"You cannot follow me," retorted the servant, his disfigured face grimaced
  unpleasantly. "I said that I was going to Nuremberg, but you don't know if I
  lied or not."</p>

  <p>"I'll take a chance on that. I'll pay you for whatever information you
  care to give me about this man and where he is."</p>

  <p>"As for that, this place is lonely."</p>

  <p>"And you could rob me of whatever I had?" Florio took a small pistol, such
  as ladies carry in their muffs when travelling, out of his flap pocket. "I am
  armed, and this pretty toy can be accurate and deadly."</p>

  <p>"I meant no threats," mumbled August. "This M. Nesle is nothing to me.
  I've met too many <i>emigrés,</i> deserters long ago from M. d'Artois army on
  the Rhine. He told me to meet him at the Drei Linden on the Haupt Platz. And,
  as you guessed, sir," added the servant impudently, "I am to have more money
  if I describe the visit of a stranger, such a one as came."</p>

  <p>"A stranger answering the description of the Englishman, but how are you
  to prove that he saw the grave?"</p>

  <p>"M. Nesle must take my word for that."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I, too, shall go to Nuremberg, on the chance that what you say
  is true. I shall stay at another post house, the Blaue Stern, and if you care
  to find me there, some days hence, and your information has proved accurate,
  I shall pay you well."</p>

  <p>The man grinned again, mopping his inflamed eyes with a handkerchief
  pulled from his breast.</p>

  <p>"I perceive, sir," he said carefully, "that you are a keen bargainer. I
  wonder you are at such trouble seeing that the lady is dead. The Englishman
  was satisfied that the quest was ended."</p>

  <p>"It is this man who employed you whom I wish to see," smiled Florio. "Go
  now, or the twilight you dread will overtake you in the Forest."</p>

  <p>August hesitated, then left the room, closing the door behind him. Florio,
  watching from the window, from behind the pot of flowers (where plucked and
  by whom?), saw him walk away round the silent house, skirting the overgrown
  space that had once been a lawn, and then return, on a stout cob, and ride
  away along the darkling bridle path.</p>

  <p>Florio felt acutely that he was alone in the forsaken house. He was almost
  resolved to return to Rippoldsau and from there to begin the long journey to
  Bologna, where he would be surrounded by activity, cheerfulness and a
  splendid routine that spaced the hours with a full and rich employment.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed to him foolish that he had left his proper place (that he
  had kept undisturbed during long revolutions and wars that he despised) for
  this pursuit that seemed sometimes sordid and trivial, and sometimes
  dangerously bordering on the menace enclosed in dreams.</p>

  <p>Even during the tumults in Bologna, the passing of victor and vanquished,
  Florio, a youth and a scholar, had lived withdrawn in the Villa Aria,
  surrounded by philosophic friends who had instructed him in the only sanity
  (so they declared), that of academic pursuits, easy and elegant surroundings,
  and an enjoyment of his peculiar good fortune in having comeliness of person,
  wealth, high birth and a swift intelligence.</p>

  <p>"I shall return," he promised himself. "This attempt to break away from my
  destiny is absurd. It is true that I was sometimes melancholy and found the
  time tedious, but that despondency was nothing compared to what I suffer
  here."</p>

  <p>He went upstairs, forcing his fatigue. The empty house was an unpleasant
  pausing place; he disliked the echo of his own steps on the bare stairs.</p>

  <p>There was a chance that they might be concealing themselves in some upper
  chamber, but he did not think this likely, but rather that the man who named
  himself August had, on the whole, spoken the truth.</p>

  <p>The four plain rooms were, in fact, empty. Two were bed chambers, and in
  one some thin yellow and white shawls were thrown over the horn chairs, and a
  few saffron coloured roses had been placed in a green glass by the mirror on
  the dressing table.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico considered these with a pang of self reproach.</p>

  <p>"While I flatter myself I play the part of a knight errant, am I no better
  than a spy? What do I understand of their story? Surely there is something
  behind the commonplace facts. Bonino speaks justly when he urges me to leave
  these foreigners to their no doubt dull destiny."</p>

  <p>But the silence of the Forest, of the empty house, contrived an
  enchantment not so easily broken. What had begun as a whim (or so it now
  appeared to Florio) took on a considerable importance, and some invisible,
  immortal power seemed to hover over his decision either to return to Bologna
  or to continue his pursuit.</p>

  <p>He did not consider failure. It was true that they had escaped him when he
  had believed them fast in the net. But he commanded such power that sooner or
  later he believed that he was certain to overtake and confront them.</p>

  <p>What then?</p>

  <p>He could neither answer nor avoid that question.</p>

  <p>No sunshine fell into the cool room where, in haste or carelessness, she
  had left those pale silks that he remembered so well, but there was a green
  shadow from the Forest cast even across the space that had been the Duke's
  lawn. The silence was so intense that to this nervous listener it seemed to
  be filled with a multitude of whispers.</p>

  <p>It is seldom that he was sunk in the mists of hopes and dreams that he had
  observed overbear other men. Both by race and nature he was ironic and viewed
  even visions with a magnanimous detachment. But now the Forest and the
  lassitude of his ill health vanquished him.</p>

  <p>A romantic melancholy that was usually with him a deliberate indulgence,
  now surged over him, beyond his control.</p>

  <p>He fingered the yellow shawl, remembering how she had held it over the
  bosom of her muslin gown while she had looked at him with a steady glance
  that he had thought to be imploring. Did she feel as if some destruction
  awaited her? There was so little to destroy in poor Letty.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico considered that a slight harshness, a subtle neglect, a
  flick of open shame, and the harassed, foolish woman would be like a withered
  lily on a broken stalk that no sunshine or dew could revive.</p>

  <p>She was the least impressive, the least important of the women he had
  known, having neither great beauty nor any wit. And he was accustomed to both
  beauty and wit, and to many elegances and pretty tricks in women to which
  Letty could never pretend.</p>

  <p>As he stared from this upper window at the Forest, he endeavoured to
  persuade himself that he would renounce this adventure that was so
  unprofitable and so unamusing.</p>

  <p>He went downstairs into the lower room, and closed the window behind the
  vase of flowers. A slight wind had arisen that stirred the muslin curtains
  and shook the tops of the high trees.</p>

  <p>He had no desire to take the flowers that she had probably gathered, nor
  the shawls she had left in the empty bedroom.</p>

  <p>The brilliant light was fading in the pure sky that he could barely
  glimpse above the trees.</p>

  <p>He left the house, closing the door behind him. His mood was then a
  desire, an intention, to return to Bologna where he knew so many, his equals
  and his admirers, with whom he could gracefully play the game of life.
  Leaving them, the players and the game, whenever he wished. As he could, he
  reminded himself, leave Letty whenever he wished.</p>

  <p>He entered on the path that led to Rippoldsau, looking back several times
  at the house named Wilhelmsruhe and the park named Solitude, until the tall
  dark trees hid it from his sight. Being weary, he walked slowly and the glow
  was withdrawn from the upper air and strengthening in the west before he
  reached the Bad establishment at Rippoldsau that lay, to his sudden view of
  it, as if dropped from the clouds, in the secluded valley.</p>

  <p>Bonino awaited him with anxiety. Florio San Quirico felt pleasure in
  hearing his native tongue with the Bolognese accent. In the presence of this
  constant friend and servant was something of home.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you did not find them?" asked Bonino, hopefully. "Assuredly you are
  fatigued. You should have allowed me to accompany you."</p>

  <p>Florio took off his cloak in the alien room and seated himself by the
  window.</p>

  <p>Here the scenery was more open, the trees less dense than at Wilhelmsruhe,
  the huge blown boughs farther off.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to tell you, Bonino. Perhaps tomorrow we shall start on
  the way to Bologna, that would please you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"And many others, sir; who am I to be considered? I speak always in the
  name of your noble kinsman and friends."</p>

  <p>Florio smiled.</p>

  <p>"Serve my supper here. It is a sombre chamber, but I am in no mood for the
  gossip of good Herr Weissnix."</p>

  <p>Beyond the Forest the sky, obscured by wisps of cloud, flared with what to
  Florio's mood seemed to be supernatural splendour between the swaying boughs
  of the purple trees, outlined massively against this flow of scarlet and
  gold.</p>

  <p>Florio, closing his tired eyes, could believe he was seated beside that
  other window in the deserted house, with the flowers on the sill, and the
  silence full of whispers. The lackey, with his callous impudence, tricks and
  lies, riding away, and the Forest near.</p>

  <p>As the blaze of the eclipsed sun faded, Bonino brought in the candles, two
  for the supper table, two for the dressing table, two flames reflected in the
  mirror, making four stars in the shadowed corner, two flames shining above
  the clean cloth, the bread on the board, the dusky grapes in the basket, the
  wine in the green bottle.</p>

  <p>Florio ate and drank languidly.</p>

  <p>"If I abandon her she will die stupidly, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"As such women die every day, sir."</p>

  <p>"She is in the power of one more cunning than I had expected. His deceits
  are ingenious."</p>

  <p>"He is afraid, sir, and desperate." The servant spoke with contempt.
  "Afraid of the Englishman whom you saw at Bode's."</p>

  <p>"Whom I deceived, Bonino. All these are Arlequino's tricks, I am not proud
  of them."</p>

  <p>"She is not worth even that amount of exertion, sir."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not. Nor am I worth more myself," smiled Florio. "I must save
  myself from the more bitter consequences of my folly."</p>

  <p>"Yes, folly I do think it, sir," agreed the servant sternly, but with a
  very decorous manner. "And I do perceive a cloud over you, who used to be of
  a perfect gaiety, as well as the most indulgent and agreeable of men."</p>

  <p>"Yet I used to dream much alone, Bonino, even amid my books, my academies
  and my salons. Often I had not an iota of interest in those about me, I even
  felt myself to be lacking in natural affection for those who loved me. Much
  of what I appeared to enjoy was a vexation to me. I held everything in
  disfavour until this adventure, at once bizarre and commonplace, came my
  way."</p>

  <p>"If you would but realize, sir, how ordinary these foreigners are,"
  pleaded the servant. "How sordid is their story."</p>

  <p>"I certainly am somewhat enchanted by the Forest," smiled Florio. "How
  often one has read of it or pictured it, symbolic of this or that, and here I
  am actually within it. As I walked from Wilhelmsruhe to-day, alone, I could
  have credited many fables."</p>

  <p>"This romantic mood has been sufficiently indulged," declared Bonino
  severely. "You, sir, with all this brooding, musing and the miasma from these
  grapes they grow too closely here, and the foul airs of the Forest, will
  sicken again."</p>

  <p>Florio, with his amiable good breeding, listened patiently to this over
  long speech inspired, he knew, by devotion.</p>

  <p>"Who am I," he thought with humility, "to mean so much to any fellow
  creature?"</p>

  <p>He was abashed to consider this man, older than himself, not his inferior
  in courage or intelligence, who was not only content, but happy, to serve him
  and to exist in that service only.</p>

  <p>Yet he could not bring himself to promise to return to Bologna. The old
  fire glittered, brilliant yet false, with an hypercritical air; the confused,
  ordinary adventure seemed true and worthy.</p>

  <p>"Sir, do you love her?" asked Bonino, observing him closely, the pale,
  comely face with the auburn hair, illumined by the light of the candles
  before him, and by those reflected in the mirror at his side.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico did not answer. His thoughtful smile showed that he had
  not been offended.</p>

  <p>"Even princes," added Bonino with an air of resignation, "have been
  afflicted by a romantic passion for some foolish woman whose pitiless vanity
  destroyed them."</p>

  <p>"I do not suppose that my birth puts me above human weakness," replied
  Florio with a deepening of his smile. "Do you, then, think her vain?"</p>

  <p>"Has she not encouraged you, sir, to follow her?"</p>

  <p>"I have never been sure of that."</p>

  <p>"At this hunting box to-day, was there nothing, sir, left?"</p>

  <p>"There was," replied Florio, thinking of the grave that he had not spoken
  of. "Yes, in her room, Bonino," he added lightly, "there was a posy and two
  of her thin shawls."</p>

  <p>"It was as if she had left a note," remarked the servant, sadly.</p>

  <p>"She could not have guessed that I would come to Wilhelmsruhe, their
  thought, their dread, is all for the other man. And he has been there, and
  missed them."</p>

  <p>"I do not think that you love her, sir, or you would not discuss her with
  me," said the servant shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"As to that, you know her too well for me to pretend reverence. And I
  shall never have anything to conceal from you, Bonino."</p>

  <p>A look of exultation passed over the lean face of the servant; he turned
  aside to conceal his deep emotion.</p>

  <p>Florio drank his pale yellow wine and looked out into the darkness that
  had been the gleaming sky and the purple wood.</p>

  <p>"I long to have no responsibilities, Bonino, to be free as a vagabond, and
  I know the folly of that longing. Yes, the Forest has infected
  me&mdash;though the air is pure, not foul as you think, Bonino&mdash;as
  keenly as the miasma from the vintage at Stuttgart. I think I talk nonsense.
  Yes, I felt she had left the shawls and the flowers for me, yet I was
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"Will you return to Bologna, sir?"</p>

  <p>"It is my pleasure to talk to you as a friend," smiled Florio. "You must
  not reprove me. I wish we had more light than these four candles."</p>

  <p>"I shall ask for more, sir."</p>

  <p>"No, disturb no one for me. I shall sit by the window awhile. Go to your
  bed, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"I do not expect to see Bologna for a long time," remarked the servant
  dryly, as he left the chamber.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>§ 13</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio San Quirico parted from the Forest with a reluctance, as if a
  wistful enchantment held him back. He saw with regret the Badhaus waiting to
  be closed after his departure. Herr Weissnix was returning to Stuttgart for
  the winter. Florio could picture, with a poignant sharpness, what Rippoldsau
  would look like under the frost and snow, with the leafless trees surrounding
  the shuttered house and the cold springs. Even more lonely would be
  Wilhelmsruhe and the park named Solitude, drenched and smitten by storms. It
  was not likely that the deserted hunting box would be visited by any of the
  grotesque creatures, in their fantastic costumes, who dwelt in the remote
  farms and cottages, nor would even the woodmen or charcoal burners pass this
  place of one time pleasure, now neglected and with an ill name, no doubt.</p>

  <p>Florio wondered who had removed the vase of flowers by the open window, or
  if it would stand there until the wind overturned it by creaking the shutters
  on their hinges. Would her shawls moulder in the empty bed chamber under
  cobwebs and dust?</p>

  <p>Herr Weissnix did not wish to visit this abandoned property, he declared;
  indeed, he had no right to do so since he had been paid for it six months in
  advance. And when Florio told him that the foreigners had left, he said they
  might return, that it was no business of his to go prying, and that he felt
  some uneasiness lest, by meddling in this matter, he drew on himself the
  displeasure of the Duke. Besides this, there was nothing of value in
  Wilhelmsruhe and no one was likely again to require so desolate a place.
  Florio did not mention the grave in the blue and gold baroque summer house,
  and he encouraged Herr Weissnix to, at least, wait a while before making
  inquiries at Wilhelmsruhe.</p>

  <p>"I shall not go before the spring," replied the landlord, who had the
  townsman's dislike of the country in the winter. "And it is useless to write,
  for no post goes there; of course, in the days of the Grand Duke there was a
  courier."</p>

  <p>Florio took a kind farewell of the agreeable man, who was anxious to
  return to the home he and his mother kept for his student son, and was driven
  by Bonino in the light carriage to Stuttgart, he preferring to make his
  journey that way along the high road, past the racecourses and pleasure
  grounds at Cannstatt to Waiblingen, through varied hills and valleys, to
  Stalen where he spent the night. He made no effort at haste for he knew that
  this would help him little, since he had already lost several days; he would
  have to, with what philosophy he might command, leave it to chance whether or
  not he found the fugitives at the Drei Linden, and whether or not the servant
  named August called on him at the Blaue Stern in Nuremberg.</p>

  <p>He crossed the frontier again near Dinkelsbuhl and proceeded with a steady
  purpose towards his goal. He was still at odds with himself as to his final
  resolve in the matter of his journey. As Bonino skilfully drove the
  travelling carriage along the well-kept roads bordered with lustrous colours
  of autumn and of harvest, gilded by a sumptuous and unvarying sunlight,
  Florio pondered on his quest, until he became inclined to put it to a total
  hazard, so equally were his emotions and opinions divided.</p>

  <p>"Bonino!" he exclaimed, leaning forward in his padded leather seat, "I
  shall promise you this, no I shall promise myself, if I do not find them in
  Nuremberg, I shall return to Bologna."</p>

  <p>"Do you indeed make a promise of that, sir?" asked the servant, looking
  over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do, to myself. It is not fair to pretend I do this because of you.
  The truth is that I cannot be certain in my mind. Partly I am weary of this
  vagabond existence, and partly I cannot endure to relinquish it."</p>

  <p>Bonino's lean face crinkled with a smile of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Then, I think, sir, if you keep your bond we shall soon be returning to
  Bologna, for there is but a slight chance, after all these delays, that
  <i>they will</i> still be in Nuremberg, if indeed they ever went there, for
  probably, sir," added the servant, again turning his attention to the horse,
  "that rascal you met in Wilhelmsruhe lied. Ah, had you but taken me with you,
  I would have dealt with him."</p>

  <p>Florio laughed. Bonino's humours often dispelled his own moods.</p>

  <p>"That is part of the hazard that I am prepared to take, whether he lied or
  not. Be at ease, if they are not at Nuremburg I have no more clue to their
  whereabouts than has that beguiled Englishman."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>§ 14</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio considered Nuremberg a decayed and Gothic city, with an air
  farouche and displeasing, almost barbarous. The once great Imperial city was
  gloomy, silent and half inhabited, and the rock-like castle towering above
  the crag seemed to darken the northern part of the town that it dominated.
  The spire of St. Sebald rose into heavy seeming gold grey clouds, from under
  which a slant light fell on the balconied houses, the handsome squares and
  the Gothic fountains, with crowded statues and elevated crosses.</p>

  <p>The Blaue Stern, a post-house already known to Florio, who had once
  already crossed the ancient city in his quest, was situated in the Milch
  Markt, and accommodation was soon obtained from the landlord who displayed in
  his bow window a quantity of wooden toys and clocks, the work of the peasants
  in the Forest, who sent their handwork to the town in the hope of a purchase
  from the infrequent traveller.</p>

  <p>Florio felt listless, almost inclined to abandon his journey. Already he
  had come a long way, his return would occupy many weary stages, it would be
  winter before he reached Bologna. And if he tarried much longer, travel would
  be difficult, perhaps impossible; roads icy, snow bound, and all the cold
  grey months would have to be passed in Germany.</p>

  <p>"Bonino," he confessed, "I am half minded to leave Nuremberg without
  visiting the Drei Linden."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir, you cannot do better than depart from this uncouth place
  that is quite unfitted to entertain a man of your rank," agreed the servant.
  "Yet I fear I know your disposition too well, and that you will certainly try
  your luck at the detestable inn that scoundrel mentioned."</p>

  <p>"Have you already discovered that it is detestable?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I asked the boy here and he told me it was an ill thought of
  place, where the farmers and small traders put up on market days, that it
  does not offer accommodation for gentle folk and is situate in a ruined
  street."</p>

  <p>At this Florio's astonishment and compassion were aroused.</p>

  <p>"They cannot be there," he declared. "Have they lost all their money? They
  spent so lavishly."</p>

  <p>"Where, sir, did they obtain this money?" asked the servant
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"An estate was sold. They should be well supplied." Bonino glanced with
  vexation at his master's animated face.</p>

  <p>"Ah, now I perceive I spoke hastily in mentioning the misery of this inn!"
  he cried in self reproach. "Nothing will do but that you must see it for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I must do that, Bonino. But I shall keep my word. If I do not find
  them there, you can prepare for our long journey home."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>§ 15</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio found the Drei Linden in a quiet part of the city near the
  fortifications and the Nonnen Garten, where some fine houses had gradually
  fallen into ruin from the time, more than a hundred and fifty years ago, when
  Gustavus II and Wallenstein had battered down the Imperial city in their
  furious struggles that left thousands dead by fire, sword and disease.</p>

  <p>Florio thought of these old wars and those lately over, as he walked along
  these solitary streets; the quarter, so mean in Bonino's opinion, had to him
  a rude and Gothic charm.</p>

  <p>The three lime trees as easily distinguished the inn of that name, as the
  freshly-painted board with the Blue Star on it picked out that hostelry from
  the neighbouring houses.</p>

  <p>These trees grew of immense girth, the leaves rusty coloured and curling;
  one was encircled by chairs and supported by stakes.</p>

  <p>The inn was gabled and seemed part of a more ancient building, as the lime
  trees seemed part of some ancient garden. Either side were houses that were
  now let in tenements, poor folk, weavers or pencil makers, watched listlessly
  from the richly-balconied windows. Florio saw the glances of dull curiosity
  that followed his elegance to the porch of the inn.</p>

  <p>A clumsy, fair girl answered his knock and gazed at him heavily.</p>

  <p>"Yes, no," Florio repeated to himself, <i>"rouge&mdash;noir</i>, how is my
  total hazard to fall?"</p>

  <p>He then tried to turn the moment into a jest, to disguise from himself how
  serious it had become. The maid, holding the door open, eyed him doubtfully
  when he asked for the foreigners, and he felt that they could not be in this
  retreat. The slow answer when it came, was not hopeful.</p>

  <p>"An Italian trader and his wife were staying there, they had come to buy
  toys&mdash;they were not gentlefolk." The girl shook her head stupidly, yet
  conscious of Florio's quality.</p>

  <p>"It is they," he thought. "Bonino has lost."</p>

  <p>"Countryfolk of mine, then," he smiled. "But are you sure they are from
  Italy?"</p>

  <p>"Or Jews," suggested the girl. "There are many Jews in Nuremberg, they
  come to trade, we often have them here."</p>

  <p>"I am a trader," said Florio. "I come to do business with them."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say so?" she retorted, crossly but without suspicion. "You
  interrupt my work, come into the parlour."</p>

  <p>He followed her, thankful for her dullness, for had she asked for names he
  would not have known what to call himself or them.</p>

  <p>"Stay," he said, fearful of giving them the alarm and time to escape
  again. "Have they a parlour of their own?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, upstairs&mdash;the two best rooms."</p>

  <p>He put a piece of money into her fat and greasy hand. "I shall go up. I am
  pressed for time. I want to show my samples and be gone."</p>

  <p>She grinned, staring at the silver in her palm.</p>

  <p>"He is in," she said, readily now. "I heard him go upstairs just now."</p>

  <p>She trudged away, clanking wooden shoes, to the back of the house and
  Florio San Quirico ascended the steep stairs and opened, without knocking,
  the door in front of him.</p>

  <p>The room, roughly finished, was littered with painted dolls, trinkets in
  cases, boxes of pencils, mirrors and trivial carvings in wood and ivory.</p>

  <p>At a table in the centre, a tall man was seated, bending over a pile of
  account books and papers; he wore a shabby dark green coat and his black hair
  was cut close. As the door opened, he raised his head and showed an
  uncommonly handsome face that instantly darkened with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I hardly expected to see you again, prince," he remarked in English, with
  forced composure.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry if I disturb you, Captain Calamy, but I thought I made it
  clear that you would not easily lose my friendship." Florio smiled. "Come,
  surely my visit does not displease you? Certainly I entered brusquely, but I
  feared to alarm you by sending a message by that stupid servant."</p>

  <p>"I am here because they are all stupid," said the other, alert and
  watchful. "I can even pass as a Jew or an Italian. See my
  stock-in-trade!"</p>

  <p>"You are cool, Captain Calamy. I had thought to startle you more."</p>

  <p>"I have had to learn not to be startled, or astonished," replied Philip
  Calamy. "No doubt we can come to terms of friendship. You must have been at
  some trouble to find me."</p>

  <p>"A little fatigue. But the clues fell into my hands."</p>

  <p>Florio seated himself on one end of a chest covered with wooden dolls. "I
  have not seen you since you left Bologna," he added smiling still, with eyes
  and lips.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy smiled also, but not so pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Letty is abroad," he remarked. "She likes to walk on the ramparts."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"She has a fine dog, Rover. Neither is she likely to attract much
  attention in this decayed place, full of petty traders."</p>

  <p>"And you pretend to be one of them, an Italian or a Jew? The girl gave me
  no name."</p>

  <p>"She is a fool&mdash;as they all are here. Thick peasants are what they
  are used to, they do not know if I speak English or Italian."</p>

  <p>"I have been of some service to you," remarked Florio. "Colonel Winslow
  came to see me in Stuttgart."</p>

  <p>"Still searching for us?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I sent him across the Swiss frontier. I, of course, soon discovered
  that you had gone to Rippoldsau, passing as mysterious French refugees."</p>

  <p>"Did you change your mind and set Winslow on to us?" asked Philip Calamy
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"No. Not finding you at Schaffhausen, he became suspicious of me, and of
  you. He stayed in the same post house at Dinkelsbuhl, as I suppose you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I brushed against him under the linden trees, outside there as here.
  Letty had won the landlord's kindness and that of an Austrian woman we had
  hired. Letty can act very prettily."</p>

  <p>"What made you think of so wild a tale?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I satisfy your curiosity?" smiled Philip Calamy. "Yet, why
  not? I saw the news in <i>The Gazette</i>, that such a royal fugitive was
  masquerading in Wurtemberg&mdash;it was easy to write a letter from the Duke,
  to alter one's papers, to impose on simple people, at least for a while. They
  delight in these marvels. Of course, the extraordinary likeness of Letty to
  the late Queen of France made me think of it. She did her part, embroidered
  <i>fleur-de-lys</i> on some linen, painted a sketch in a prayer book. How
  easily these imbeciles are deceived!"</p>

  <p>Florio listened attentively to this speech that seemed to him to be spoken
  to gain time, as if Philip Calamy who must, however good a face he put on it,
  have been considerably astonished by this visit, was rapidly considering his
  attitude and his next action.</p>

  <p>"But Colonel Winslow found you, even at Wilhelmsruhe."</p>

  <p>"You know that?"</p>

  <p>Florio was disdainful of this parrying of the main issue. He told all that
  had happened to him since he had left Bologna, briefly, while the other
  watched with a brooding interest.</p>

  <p>"I saw the grave in the summer house. Your man earned his money and the
  dupe went away deceived."</p>

  <p>"It was easily done. Of course I acted alone. I arranged everything with
  my own hands. It was not difficult to find a pock marked fellow here,
  chaplain, woodmen were my invention, we had a visit from a fool of a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>Florio had not thought Philip Calamy possessed of the courage and resource
  he had shown in all these tricks that he had played single handed.</p>

  <p>"I had the approaches to the Forest watched. The French tale and the Ducal
  protection fable went down very well with these simpletons. He nearly caught
  us at Dinkelsbuhl. We were saved by Letty's wig, and my drop in rank. Winslow
  would never think of either of those devices."</p>

  <p>"Your mask was clever, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I knew Winslow would never suspect a servant and that I could find a
  disfigured fellow to take my part whenever I wished. No one has followed
  here. I am no longer Martin, the faithful lackey, but Martino, the modest
  Lombard trader, come to Nuremberg to buy toys and trinkets." Philip Calamy
  spoke carefully, then added a question he did not seem to wish to speak. "Do
  you know where he has gone?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing. I spoke with him at Wilhelmsruhe, he was completely
  baffled. I should think that he would return to Switzerland. I told him I had
  seen you at Stuttgart, as I was able to give an exact description of you and
  your belongings, even to Letty's name and her dressing case. He believed
  me."</p>

  <p>"I am grateful to you for being at so much trouble to throw him off the
  scent."</p>

  <p>"For my part," admitted Florio, "I disliked telling these lies. I found no
  fault with Colonel Winslow, a man of breeding and dignity, fiercely
  afflicted."</p>

  <p>"Since he has your sympathy, why did you not help him?" demanded Philip
  Calamy, dryly.</p>

  <p>"I knew he intended murder."</p>

  <p>"I told you that in Bologna."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I never supposed that he could obtain long enough leave of
  absence to follow you so far."</p>

  <p>"Nor did I. He is armed?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he wants to challenge me?"</p>

  <p>"Rather, I should say, to shoot you on sight. He is a man possessed by one
  overwhelming purpose."</p>

  <p>"And what is to be Letty's fate if he finds her?" sneered Philip
  Calamy.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. He never did discuss his case with me, or with anyone. He
  has been neither enervated nor degraded by his tragedy."</p>

  <p>"Tragedy!"</p>

  <p>"So it is to him."</p>

  <p>"An obstinate, ungovernable man," burst out Philip Calamy. "You do not
  know him."</p>

  <p>"I think I do."</p>

  <p>"Then, if you do, answer me this," replied the other man roughly. "Would
  he take Letty back?"</p>

  <p>Florio had not expected this question, that fitted in with nothing in the
  case.</p>

  <p>"No, assuredly not," he declared. "He is a man of honour, a
  soldier&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. But if he is infatuated, he could resign from the
  regiment and live retired. He has a handsome estate."</p>

  <p>"You make a jest of it all," protested Florio, rising. "After she has been
  two years with you."</p>

  <p>"Very well, leave the matter." Philip Calamy grinned. "I can but pray for
  another war that will extinguish this firebrand."</p>

  <p>He controlled some turbulent emotion and, rising also, began to pack some
  of the clocks and puppets that were lying out of their boxes.</p>

  <p>His movements were well trained and graceful. Florio knew him as a most
  charming and accomplished companion, with no flaw in his gay temper and
  brilliant good looks.</p>

  <p>But now he was changed since the Bologna days, when he and the woman who
  had passed as his wife had kept an agreeable salon, and joined graciously in
  all the sports and pleasures of the city.</p>

  <p>It was their sudden flight that had sharpened Florio's interest in them.
  That and the confession they had made before they left Bologna, that they
  were not married and a husband was on their heels.</p>

  <p>"You are our kindest friend," Letty had said, her hand trembling in his,
  and then she had revealed that her name was not Latymer, but Winslow, that
  her companion was Philip Calamy, and that she had eloped from a stern, dull
  husband much older than herself, two years before. This story had been
  ordinary to Florio, it was a period, a country, for free manners. Even when
  he heard that Letty Winslow's husband was coming to Europe in search of his
  wife and her lover, he could not take this act of Arlequino and Panteleone
  seriously.</p>

  <p>But their alarm was in her case poignant, in the man's ferocious. They
  declared that Colonel Winslow was dangerous, would at best require a duel. "A
  barbarian," Florio had thought, but after meeting the unhappy soldier at
  Bode's he had changed his opinion and thought, "not barbarism, but another
  code from mine."</p>

  <p>He had also at once felt sure that Colonel Winslow did mean murder, or, as
  he would express it, "a satisfaction to his honour."</p>

  <p>He recalled this as he watched Philip Calamy at his futile occupation,
  with which he concerned himself very precisely.</p>

  <p>"What do you intend to do now, Captain Calamy?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, since you have been at pains to follow us, you can advise
  me."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I can."</p>

  <p>"Why <i>did</i> you follow us?"</p>

  <p>"I was weary of Bologna. And interested in you."</p>

  <p>"I see, we are objects of curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," smiled Florio. "All three of you. But do not be offended, I
  may be of use to you."</p>

  <p>"I dare say."</p>

  <p>"You cannot stay here, in this paltry disguise."</p>

  <p>"It is remarkably safe. I have certainly thrown off his spies&mdash;if he
  has the intelligence to employ any."</p>

  <p>"He works through these little German courts where he has some influence.
  You had better leave Wurtemberg and Bavaria."</p>

  <p>"No doubt." Captain Calamy grinned again. He certainly was not the man he
  had been, or appeared to be. A sullenness, a bitterness smouldered in his
  eyes, a sneer touched his lips, his manners were brusque. Something of the
  coarseness of the mask he had assumed, something of the craft he had
  employed, defaced his person and his air.</p>

  <p>"I speak as a friend," smiled Florio. "You know how I look on your
  situation, and that I consider Colonel Winslow is behaving with folly."</p>

  <p>This angered Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>"You understand nothing of this in your Popish country," he replied. "And
  yet it has been explained to you. I was in his regiment. Letty and his two
  children were all he cared for&mdash;naturally he wants to kill me."</p>

  <p>"Then I wonder that you, knowing this, lived so easily in Florence, Rome
  and Bologna."</p>

  <p>"He was safe, unable to leave the army, I thought. How did I know that he
  would get leave of absence, or that some tatler would tell him we were in
  Italy?"</p>

  <p>Florio shrugged. The pursuit had been more agreeable than finding the
  pursued. The romantic mood created by the Forest had entirely left him.
  Philip Calamy, in his misfortune, had become prosaic and material, engrossed
  in his plight, almost without courtesy.</p>

  <p>"I am staying at the Blaue Stern," said Florio. "If you want me, pray send
  there."</p>

  <p>The Englishman turned and looked him up and down.</p>

  <p>"Are you in love with Letty?"</p>

  <p>"A little, yes."</p>

  <p>"And there, when you supposed her to be my wife?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, her <i>cavaliere</i>. As you understood."</p>

  <p>"I understood," agreed Philip Calamy. "It is the manner of your country.
  No doubt it is to Letty I owe your help in the misdirecting of Colonel
  Winslow."</p>

  <p>"I did that for your sake, also, and for his. What will <i>his</i> fate be
  if he kills you?"</p>

  <p>"The gallows, I hope. No need to pity him, he holds all the winning
  cards."</p>

  <p>"He is savagely unhappy."</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy was about to answer hastily, but checked himself.</p>

  <p>"Well, I thank you for what you did. I owe it to you to let you know what
  I shall do next&mdash;if you <i>care</i> to know."</p>

  <p>The two young men considered one another. The Englishman's handsome eyes
  were blank, as if he deliberately obscured their expression. Florio's light
  glance was candid.</p>

  <p>"You will find Letty on the walls, if you would like to see her. No doubt
  she is lonely, she has not had any civilized company for several weeks. And
  she found Wilhelmsruhe melancholy."</p>

  <p>"I shall meet her and bring her here," replied Florio. "Poor lady, I pity
  her."</p>

  <p>"That you need not," the Englishman again controlled himself. "She has all
  my care," he added, sombrely.</p>

  <p>"I know." Florio spoke warmly. "You have shown great skill and ingenuity
  in protecting her. I do not believe she has any regrets."</p>

  <p>"Regrets!" The Englishman took up one of the dolls and flung it down
  gently. "Regrets, oh, no!"</p>

  <p>"As true lovers neither of you would feel any."</p>

  <p>Florio took his leave; looking up from below, as he passed the ancient
  lindens, he saw Philip Calamy watching him from the window, staring at him
  without a look or gesture of recognition, as if he gazed at a stranger.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>§ 16</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio San Quirico asked the dull servant maid where Signor Martin's wife
  had gone, adding that he had been sent to fetch her home.</p>

  <p>"I thought that she would be late with her work," was the unexpected
  reply.</p>

  <p>"What part of the work is hers?"</p>

  <p>"She dresses the dolls. I thought that you knew."</p>

  <p>"No. I saw some pretty trifles upstairs."</p>

  <p><i>"She</i> makes them." The stout girl smiled maliciously. "And never
  fast enough or well enough."</p>

  <p>Florio passed between the old lime trees, along a cobbled street to the
  right, as he had been directed, and so out on to the walls that, rugged as
  cliffs, enclosed the decayed Gothic grandeur of the city.</p>

  <p>He soon saw her, walking lonely save for a bright brown dog who rushed at
  him as he approached.</p>

  <p>She wore a plain coat, a hat tied under the chin, and was not in any way
  noticeable.</p>

  <p>She recognized Florio at once, and, in an excited tone, called the dog,
  Rover, to her side. "It is a friend," she added in English and advanced,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>He observed that she did not wear a wig, but had been using some lotion to
  darken her red hair; that she was pallid, appeared weary, even frightened,
  and was glad of his coming.</p>

  <p>"I am not as astonished to see you as I should be," she said candidly. "I
  thought, prince, that you might follow us."</p>

  <p>"Did you not intend me to when you told me why you had left Bologna?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Is one ever sure of one's own intentions? I felt that we wanted
  a friend and that you were chivalrous."</p>

  <p>He noted but did not remark on the fact that they had met without
  greetings, as naturally as if they had been parted but a few hours.</p>

  <p>"You <i>have</i> wanted a friend?" he asked, falling into step beside her.
  "I have been to the Drei Linden and seen Captain Calamy."</p>

  <p>"Do not give him that rank; you know that he was cashiered&mdash;dismissed
  with ignominy&mdash;from his regiment."</p>

  <p>"I did not&mdash;you did not tell me that."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, but it follows, at least in England."</p>

  <p>"There are no such Puritanical rules in Italy," he replied, smiling down
  at her delicate profile. "But I understood from the attitude of Colonel
  Winslow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have seen my husband?" She was shocked, trembled and sat down on one
  of the old walls, Rover panting at her feet.</p>

  <p>"I, of course, regard Philip Calamy as your husband."</p>

  <p>"But you know that he is not," she replied earnestly. "What
  did&mdash;Colonel Winslow&mdash;say?"</p>

  <p>Standing leisurely beside her, Florio repeated the story of his two
  encounters with the Englishman, and emphasized how he had twice put him off
  the track of Letty.</p>

  <p>Her bosom heaved and she pressed her thin hands together, glancing
  nervously up and down the empty ramparts.</p>

  <p>"It has brought it all back," she confessed. "In Rome, Florence and
  Bologna I had believed I was who I feigned to be, but when I heard that my
  husband had come to Italy all that pretence dropped away."</p>

  <p>"You did not think he would be vengeful?" asked Florio curiously. The
  three English people were odd to him, apart from the fascination Letty
  possessed over him, he found them all interesting because of their strange
  codes and eccentric behaviour.</p>

  <p>"I knew he would hate me. I thought he would put me altogether out of his
  existence. It is two years ago. It was horrible when Philip had that warning
  from his friend that my husband had returned from India and was following us
  to the continent. Yes, I was filled with horror."</p>

  <p>"Colonel Winslow has done a mad, a cruel thing," said Florio. "Since you
  left him freely."</p>

  <p>"O, pray don't make excuses for me!" she exclaimed piteously. "He is a man
  of honour and dignity, it was I who did a cruel thing. I forfeited
  everything, I did not pause to think&mdash;my husband was away so long, his
  sisters were dull and censorious. I had some money of my own, I was gay and
  went about London; every woman wanted Philip, and he wanted me only. He was
  in my husband's regiment and adjutant to the Commander-in-Chief&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Florio tenderly, checking this flow of words that seemed
  the expression of musings long repressed, "there is no need to justify
  yourself to me."</p>

  <p>"I do not want you to think I condone my own behaviour," she replied
  hurriedly. "I am quite lost and ruined."</p>

  <p>"Not anywhere&mdash;only, indeed, in your own stiff country."</p>

  <p>"And everywhere English people go. We have had to move continually for
  fear of meeting English people."</p>

  <p>Florio understood that she did indeed regard herself as one lost and
  ruined; this was to him a proof of her essential innocence. Candid, simple
  and romantic, she had been overwhelmed by a passion for an uncommonly
  attractive man while her elderly husband was abroad, and had flung away
  reputation, position, peace of mind, her two children, in the indulgence of
  this headlong infatuation.</p>

  <p>This was not difficult for Florio to realize, he found it a simple story.
  Philip Calamy's part in it was not so easy to read. Florio would not have
  considered him the man to fling every ambition aside for love. Yet he had
  done so. The Bolognese respected this supreme love. He could not conceive of
  himself as becoming an outcast, which was what Philip Calamy seemed to
  consider himself, for the sake of any woman.</p>

  <p>"You are together. You must think of some life away from the world."</p>

  <p>Yet even as he spoke he wondered if any manner of seclusion would be
  anything but galling to either of them. Philip Calamy was a man of pleasure,
  and little else, and Letty was light-minded. Whatever remorse and fear she
  might show now, she had sparkled brilliantly in Bologna as long as she had
  thought herself safe.</p>

  <p>"What will you do?" he asked thoughtfully. "What will you do?"</p>

  <p>She rose, nervously pulling at the strings of her hat.</p>

  <p>"At present I must return and dress dolls. Philip has entered seriously
  into the trade&mdash;he buys the wooden puppets, then I dress them and he
  sells them again."</p>

  <p>"What a stupid occupation for you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, what else can I do all day!"</p>

  <p>She stooped and patted the dog's smooth head, in order to hide her ready
  tears, then her troubles came tumbling out again.</p>

  <p>"It is a relief to speak English with you, it has always been German or
  French, and we know so little of either. We had to avoid French people, that
  is why I had to find an Austrian maid who did not know French."</p>

  <p>"That disguise was extravagant and painful for you."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed, eagerly. "I had to keep my face wrapped in muslin most
  of the time, and use tricks on servants and landlords. But Philip
  <i>liked</i> the intrigue; you recall how clever he was with the shows and
  plays?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a pronounced aptitude for the theatre."</p>

  <p>Florio had taken this for granted, since the members of the society in
  which he moved excelled in being exquisite amateurs of the arts, in
  particular those of the stage. Now this gift and zest for acting seemed a
  trait out of keeping with the character he knew Philip Calamy to be, an
  Englishman of fashion. Before, it had not occurred to him that in England the
  aristocracy seldom acted, though passionately addicted to masquerades.</p>

  <p>The dark, sombre, romantic aspect of the Forest had not passed from
  Florio's memory, though there was nothing of this strange atmosphere about
  the lovers. Now they were no longer carefree and gay, they were prosaic. Yet
  there was more, evidently, in Philip Calamy than might have been supposed. He
  had played out the drama of Wilhelmsruhe, and Letty had said that he had
  enjoyed that melancholy charade. He was, then, no mere fribble.</p>

  <p>"We had better return," she said, wiping her eyes with a lawn handkerchief
  on which she had embroidered a <i>fleur-de-lys.</i> "Philip will be
  impatient."</p>

  <p>"Not with you&mdash;now or ever, I hope, sweet Letty."</p>

  <p>"He is good. He has never reproached me," she replied. "Yes, we love one
  another, but that role I had to play of the dying French Princess&mdash;I
  disliked it, I felt I was that wretched girl. Philip rehearsed me in all the
  horrors of the Revolution. I had not heard them before; I led a very
  sheltered life when at home with my dear parents."</p>

  <p>"You have had no news of them?" he asked compassionately.</p>

  <p>"My father died soon after my marriage, my mother married again. I am not
  speaking of that, but of that venerable town, Dinkelsbuhl; my husband stayed
  there, I lay awake all night, thinking of him in a chamber overhead. And then
  that fearful place in the Forest, and Philip in the white mask. I felt I was
  dying indeed, and the grave he was making in the summer house really for
  me."</p>

  <p>"Hush, sweet Letty, you are agitated. This life you are leading is
  grotesque."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so," she agreed, smiling uncertainly, her eyes still wet.
  "So many names, disguises, inns, coaches, hired servants,
  travelling&mdash;and I am no one but silly Letty Winslow."</p>

  <p>"Philip has some plan, surely? He has shown himself ingenious and
  resourceful, but he had better leave Germany soon, those forged passes and
  letters from the Duke of Wurtemberg will sooner or later be discovered."</p>

  <p>"He employs some agents, or has some friends in Italy, he gets news. But
  he tells me nothing beyond the part I am to play."</p>

  <p>As they left the fortifications he looked at her with great compassion. So
  young, so delightful and so unworldly, condemned by an imprudent marriage and
  a reckless elopement to this vagabond life, always in disguise and in hiding.
  Over for her were the days of brittle splendour she had spent in Bologna,
  where she had been satisfied with her pretended situation as wife to Captain
  Latymer, an English dilettante. Now she was being driven into a half world,
  more than that, into a crazy existence of masks and mumming. Florio did not
  think that Philip Calamy, who had either so changed or so revealed himself in
  the last few weeks, would ever take any place in any society again. For he
  was afraid of murder.</p>

  <p>Florio was considering how to rescue Letty from the worst of the
  consequences of her flight from her home as they walked back to the Drei
  Linden, slowly through the autumn heat.</p>

  <p>But all his plans were checked by the reflection that these two loved one
  another, and had lost the world for love. They must be together. Yet how
  could they endure a perpetual concealment?</p>

  <p>She broke in on his musings by asking timidly: "Do you think that my
  husband has given up his search for me?" The question Philip Calamy had
  posed.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied Florio, cautiously. "He certainly had no clue to
  your whereabouts. I suppose his leave of absence will soon come to an end. Is
  it possible that he will leave the army, in order to be free?"</p>

  <p>"Leave the regiment!" she exclaimed, almost with indignation. "Oh, no! You
  understand so little of&mdash;us. My husband must have had special leave of
  absence&mdash;he is highly honoured by the Commander-in-Chief, everyone will
  sympathize with him so truly, his return from India&mdash;and his home
  blasted!"</p>

  <p>She spoke so passionately, as if in abhorrence of her own action, that
  Florio marvelled how she had ever come to commit what she evidently regarded
  as a crime.</p>

  <p>"You never loved this stern man, Letty?" he asked delicately.</p>

  <p>"O no!" she exclaimed again, looking sad and childlike. "I was sixteen
  years old when we married. I was always afraid of him."</p>

  <p>"He loves you?"</p>

  <p>"I did not think so," she murmured, "and he was away so much&mdash;at the
  war, and in India."</p>

  <p>"Then it is his pride that drives him on?"</p>

  <p>"His pride," she agreed, pitifully.</p>

  <p>"I do not know the laws of your country&mdash;could he not divorce
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. But Philip would not marry me&mdash;now.</p>

  <p>"Why not, he loves you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Still you do not understand, and it is useless to
  speak of this, if my husband had wanted to divorce me he would have done so
  at once."</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> divorced from this man, so unsuitable to your youth and
  spirits," he replied, "and the <i>wife</i> of Philip Calamy."</p>

  <p>"I thank you for your respect," she said, divining his intention to raise
  her in her own esteem. "I must so think of myself. But I know it is a
  pretence, like the charade of a princess, and of a doll maker."</p>

  <p>"You have no friends?"</p>

  <p>"Lost, all lost," she smiled, so as not to seem to complain. "I have only
  you. At one time," she added ingenuously, "I did not suppose one could have a
  man as a friend, but you are that to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am indeed. But I do not know how to help you, dear Letty."</p>

  <p>They were now approaching the linden trees. Florio would have liked to
  have asked her about money; they had spent extravagantly in Bologna, and
  their forced travelling, these disguises and shifts, such as the hiring of
  Wilhelmsruhe and the two servants, Adriana Beheim and August, could not have
  been cheap. But he could not bring himself to question her on such a matter.
  Philip Calamy had spoken of funds that were sent to him regularly at Bologna.
  Moreover, there was mention of an estate that had been sold, and she had said
  she had money of her own. So, though she had just protested that she had no
  friends, they were in touch with someone in England who must be supplying
  them with funds.</p>

  <p>Though he could not refer to this, Florio said: "You have one other friend
  at least, Letty, and that is whoever warned you that Colonel Winslow had
  leave of absence to come to Italy."</p>

  <p>"O, Captain Lennard Giles," she answered. "He is one of Philip's friends
  and always wrote to him at a Bankers in Florence who forwarded the letters
  under cover. I hardly knew Lennard Giles."</p>

  <p>They had reached the three linden trees and they parted. Florio did not
  glance up at the window where probably Philip Calamy was watching them, but
  waited until she had passed into the inn, then went slowly on his way through
  the decayed city and the stagnant autumn heat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>§ 17</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio was seated in his private chamber, casting up accounts with
  himself.</p>

  <p>He had won the hazard he had cast. He had, against all chance, found the
  fugitives, but he was still not sure that he did not wish to return to
  Bologna.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy and Letty Winslow were condemned to a life of subterfuge,
  deceit and wandering, from which he could not save them.</p>

  <p>Since meeting Colonel Winslow, he no longer smiled at the severe code of
  English society, and since hearing Letty speak of her elopement he realized
  that she was an outcast indeed from her home, her country, her way of life.
  She had nothing save the love and protection of Philip Calamy. She did not,
  Florio believed, want anything more.</p>

  <p>But what, precisely, was that worth?</p>

  <p>During the few months of their stay in a small hired palazzo in Bologna,
  Captain Latymer, as Philip had styled himself, had led the life of an elegant
  man of fashion and shown himself accomplished, easy and amiable. His story
  was that he had been wounded in the late war and sent to Italy for his
  health. But another side of his character had appeared in the fantastic
  disguises by means of which he had thrown off the pursuit of Colonel Winslow,
  and his behaviour to Florio in the parlour at the Drei Linden had not been
  amiable.</p>

  <p>Indeed he had seemed concerned with his own safety and, though he had
  asked Florio two strange questions: "Are you in love with Letty?" and "Do you
  think he would take Letty back?" he had not seemed to attach much importance
  to either of them.</p>

  <p>The first might have been a mere courteous pleasantry and was spoken
  lightly; the second was, perhaps, ironic, but difficult to interpret.</p>

  <p>What was clear, at last, to Florio, was the full meaning of this elopement
  which, when told to him in Bologna, he had taken lightly, as a mere escapade.
  Now he could realize the loss it had meant to both of them, the abandonment
  of all they valued. They had only one another.</p>

  <p>This surrender was understandable on the part of Letty: She had been
  young, foolish, unprotected and headlong in love, but Philip Calamy?</p>

  <p>Florio again emphasized in his mind that he would not have supposed the
  young Englishman was the type to lose the world, his world, for the sake of a
  woman like Letty, who was no enchantress. He could have married well,
  certainly, and shone in his own circle. He had qualities, too, as well as
  looks and brilliance.</p>

  <p>Florio did not know his family, but was sure that he was well born.</p>

  <p>To the astute Latin it seemed unlikely that such a man as Philip Calamy
  could for long adapt himself to the obscure, indefinite position he must
  occupy as the lover of a woman so abased, not only in the opinion of her
  world but in her own opinion, as to have to live forever in social oblivion.
  Was it not unavoidable that the love that once played so strongly as to urge
  him into this reckless action must, sooner or later, burn itself out? Both
  Letty and her lover were people born within a certain order, relying on a
  certain code; these they had broken and no settlement of their affairs seemed
  possible.</p>

  <p>All that money, the help and protection of former friends&mdash;like this
  Captain Lennard, who had warned them of Colonel Winslow's journey to the
  continent, but who would never see them again&mdash;could do for them was to
  cover their retreat into some lonely, avoided part of Europe where they would
  have no companions save those as fallen as themselves from their original
  place in society, or, worse, mere tradesmen and peasants such as surrounded
  them now.</p>

  <p>Florio, looking out from his window at the sunlit space of the empty Milch
  Markt, wondered how Letty, so candid, simple and innocent, would accept this
  prolonged and piteous masquerade.</p>

  <p>Yet it might well be that she was one who would live happily if she could
  live in love, and that she could live long.</p>

  <p>She had not spoken of her children. Florio supposed that they were little
  to her. Probably they had been taken from her early by elder and sterner
  women, her husband's sisters.</p>

  <p>The view this story gave to Florio of England was bleak. His compassion
  was entirely for Letty, about Philip Calamy he was curious. The man had not
  fitted into his own society, had lost everything for what Florio could not
  feel was other than a weakness, for so the ironically-minded Italian regarded
  an indulged and dangerous love of a forbidden woman.</p>

  <p>Yet Philip Calamy was no mere idler, as his late rapid shifts and
  expedients had shown, and could he long be content with an existence, cruel
  indeed for one brought up in a position of authority?</p>

  <p>"The time will come," thought Florio, "when he will tire of her&mdash;yet
  what will there be for him, even then? Or is this a romantic, deathless love,
  of which the poets sing, and will he be content merely to live with her?"</p>

  <p>Florio believed he had the patience to watch this tale unfold, but he did
  not know if this patience was inspired by love of Letty&mdash;more than that
  little love that he had admitted to Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>Florio, gracious and well bred, leisurely and keen witted, threw over the
  eloping couple the elegance and the charm of his own mind. So that,
  intelligent as he was, he did not yet clearly interpret them, giving them too
  much respect as victims of a great passion that he did not pretend to be
  capable of himself, but that he could believe in and admire in others.</p>

  <p>His meditations were not so much interrupted as continued by a visit from
  August who came, with a leer, to ask for his reward.</p>

  <p>"You thought that I lied, but you see, sir, that M. Nesle <i>is</i> at the
  Drei Linden."</p>

  <p>Florio adjusted himself to the man's tone and assented to what he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have found this M. Nesle, thanks to your information, and my
  servant shall pay you."</p>

  <p>August was satisfied with this and about to leave to take his fee, when
  Florio detained him.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me anything more of this M. Nesle?"</p>

  <p>"Only what I suppose you have seen for yourself&mdash;that he now passes
  as a trader in toys and has another woman with him."</p>

  <p>"So," thought Florio, "you believe that the mound in the summer house
  <i>is</i> a grave."</p>

  <p>"What is your guess as to this mystery?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that this <i>emigre</i>, naming himself M. Nesle, is now, since
  his mistress's death, reduced to earning a living and that it is wiser for
  him to remain in disguise."</p>

  <p>"You are not minded to betray him?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I be? And to whom?" asked August, still lingering by the door,
  his fingers on the latch, as if eager to be gone. "These things are beyond my
  meddling. I do not know who <i>he</i> is, nor who <i>you</i> are, as I told
  you before, sir."</p>

  <p>"And you have been well paid for whatever you have done&mdash;twice over,
  by this French gentleman and by myself."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," agreed August. "I have found employment as a groom at Gmund
  and prefer a quiet life. I came here only to collect my fee from you,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Florio observed that he would get little more from this fellow, who wished
  to avoid trouble and who would never disclose what he knew or guessed, but
  the Bolognese endeavoured to extract some further information from him as to
  the guests at the Drei Linden.</p>

  <p>August, however, protested that he had been in Nuremberg but once before
  to collect his money from M. Nesle. Florio interrupted here.</p>

  <p>"How did he receive you? What notice did he take of your account of the
  Englishman's visit?"</p>

  <p>"He said I had played my part very well and made me describe the man
  minutely, then he seemed satisfied that I had shown the grave to the right
  person. And now, sir, the lady being dead," added August, stubbornly, "there
  is an end."</p>

  <p>"Who do you think this other lady is?"</p>

  <p>"I did not see her. I am not interested in the affairs of M. Nesle."
  August still showed a reluctance to continue this conversation, that seemed,
  also, useless to Florio.</p>

  <p>"Go and get your money," he said and returned, when he was alone, to his
  place at the window.</p>

  <p>The light was withdrawing from the day that had been so golden, and the
  upper air appeared an intense purple above the crooked roofs and pointed
  gables of the ancient houses opposite that showed dark and sharp against the
  lustre of the sky.</p>

  <p>Florio had sat at too many windows of inns, looked out on too many alien
  scenes. He was beginning to be haunted by the impermanency of life, by the
  sense of being always a traveller, homeless, friendless, self-sufficient.</p>

  <p>Yet it was only a few months since he had left Bologna, on an impulse
  partly curiosity, partly affection. He rested his comely face in his hand,
  and his reflections that had been active, passed into a passive
  melancholy.</p>

  <p>Scenes of his boyhood came before him, that secret inner life that no one
  save himself could know. The winters in the arcaded palace in Bologna, the
  summers in the Villa Aria, happy days of ease, yet pricked by wonders, by
  ambitions, by griefs not easily, even now, in retrospect, to be
  understood.</p>

  <p>It was strange how his life had altered by the coming of the two strangers
  to Bologna. They had found their way cunningly into his world, and must have
  had help from English friends, for they had been introduced by letters from
  countrymen of standing to prominent residents in the city.</p>

  <p>Unless, as Florio now reminded himself, somewhat startled, Captain Latymer
  had forged these letters as he had forged those that purported to offer the
  protection of the Duke of Wurtemberg.</p>

  <p>This man of pleasure was certainly more than an idler, and adroit at many
  crafts. There had not been time to send to England and verify his
  credentials. Probably, even without the advent of the husband, he would have
  left Bologna before this was possible. Meanwhile the couple had passed
  perfectly into Italian society, for they were exactly what they stated they
  were, people of quality.</p>

  <p>Florio summed up his reflections on a strong note of doubt as to the real
  character of this man who had seemed merely an elegant idler, and gallant
  officer in retirement, honourably discharged by peace and wounds from service
  in the field.</p>

  <p>Considering this, Florio recalled that Philip Calamy now no longer
  troubled to assume the slight lameness that he had affected in Bologna. He
  had, then, been acting a part from the first. Florio respected his
  ability.</p>

  <p>Bonino, entering with his master's supper, asked him if he did intend to
  return to Bologna&mdash;"For it seems to me, sir, as if, in this old dead
  city, we had come to a pause and a decision," he added, respectfully. "I know
  that you found the fugitives and therefore, sir, feel yourself entitled to
  continue your journey, yet I am not sure that you are resolved to do so."</p>

  <p>"You are right," replied Florio, "and read me, as you so often do, better
  than I read myself. I am still, it is true, undecided. This Englishman is not
  the person I took him to be in Bologna, where, it is true, I had but a
  passing concern with him. He stirs my curiosity. He is in a dilemma of
  extraordinary difficulty."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it would be amusing, sir," agreed the servant, "if it did not
  involve yourself. It is fear of the husband that goads him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and, I suppose, love of the lady. Nor, in my opinion, is he wrong in
  supposing that Colonel Winslow wishes to murder him. England is a stern
  country. This ferocious gentleman has had special permission from his
  commander-in-chief to travel on the continent in order to find his wife and
  her lover, with the avowed intention of killing the latter, either by a duel
  or, more likely, a shot at sight."</p>

  <p>Bonino asked the question that Philip Calamy 'himself had asked.</p>

  <p>"What does Colonel Winslow intend shall become of his wife?"</p>

  <p>"There my imagination fails, Bonino. She has no experience of any kind, is
  very slight and candid. It cannot be that this man would leave her abandoned;
  she has only him, her lover. From her own lips I learn that she considers
  herself a creature completely ruined. Lost to all the society she once knew.
  No one, it seems, in her own country would receive her again. Yet she has a
  mother living, and, no doubt, other relatives."</p>

  <p>"Can there be such cruelty!" exclaimed Bonino. "When, sir, one considers
  the liberty allowed Italian ladies!"</p>

  <p>"And English ladies, also, I doubt not. This silly creature has been too
  bold. She had not the wit to carry on an underhand intrigue, and had the
  recklessness or courage to elope openly."</p>

  <p>"So much," remarked Bonino, "one understands. It is the man's part that is
  dubious to me."</p>

  <p>"Why, so it is to me," replied Florio. "He has lost so much and gained
  only this one woman who has nothing."</p>

  <p>"Eh, well, sir, is this problem worth your pains?" urged the servant.
  "They may linger for weeks in Nuremberg, until the roads are winter
  bound."</p>

  <p>"You are again right," agreed Florio, rousing himself from a lethargy from
  which he had been speaking lazily. "I must know their mind, and soon. I must,
  indeed, force him&mdash;senseless to speak to her, she has no will of her
  own&mdash;to declare his intentions or leave him to his destiny."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>§ 18</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio San Quirico did not have to put this resolve into practice, for the
  morning following his visit to the Drei Linden, Philip Calamy, still in his
  modest habit of a small trader, waited on him, and, unsmiling, stated his
  position.</p>

  <p>"You, prince, are the only person who knows our plight; you have taken a
  sharp interest in our affairs and I assume we have your sympathy." Without
  pausing for an assent to this statement, the Englishman continued: "You have
  followed us and pierced our disguises, very well. I am, you may guess, most
  uncertain what to do."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," agreed Florio, "I cannot conceive of a more unhappy
  position."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought that you could scarcely understand it," replied
  Philip Calamy, coldly. "In your country there are no such laws of honour as
  govern in ours."</p>

  <p>"I can, at least, comprehend that you are in the position of an outcast,
  and in flight before a man who menaces your life," said Florio, directly.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy's face hardened, his eyes assumed a blank expression. His
  splendid head had, to the appraising glance of the young man who watched him,
  the noble balance and gracious proportion of an antique bronze of the
  youthful Alexander or Antinous.</p>

  <p>"Then, prince, you understand enough. Understand also that I have come to
  you for help."</p>

  <p>"I offer it."</p>

  <p>"I had intended," continued Philip Calamy, "to remain in Nuremberg
  indefinitely, in my present safe disguise, until I could learn from my friend
  in London of Colonel Winslow's return. But that would mean, in the present
  state of the posts, many months, perhaps the entire winter. And when you
  appeared the other day I decided to make use of you."</p>

  <p>"Pray inform me in what way."</p>

  <p>"I desire your advice."</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico was seldom confounded, but now he was baffled. His
  debate within himself had been precisely on this question, what advice he
  should offer the fugitives.</p>

  <p>"Come," urged Philip Calamy, leaning forward and driving into this almost
  imperceptible pause, "you owe me this&mdash;through meddling in my
  affairs."</p>

  <p>"Meddling? You did not use that word in Bologna," smiled Florio.</p>

  <p>"In Bologna you had not meddled. You were merely one of my
  acquaintances."</p>

  <p>Florio was amused at this coming from one who he considered of lower rank
  than himself, and one, too, in a dubious position. Too greatly placed to take
  offence, he replied: "Leave it at that. I advise you, then, to live in
  retirement until the death of Colonel Winslow, who is a much older man than
  you are, of a choleric habit and a soldier, and then to marry Letty."</p>

  <p>"And where is this retirement to be?"</p>

  <p>"You would not consider my country house, the Villa Aria?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is too public."</p>

  <p>This brusque tone was very unlike that used by Philip Calamy when in
  Bologna; he had the air of one conferring, rather than asking, a favour.</p>

  <p>Florio agreed with him and made, on an impulse, a suggestion that had not
  come into his mind before, indeed one that he would have rejected as
  grotesque had it occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Sicily?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy replied that he had not been further south than
  Florence.</p>

  <p>"My father's mother was a Sicilian, and from her we hold a castle that I
  never visit. It is remote, in the midst of some of the most rugged mountains
  in the island. But it has been kept in good repair, and there are servants in
  charge, others to be had among the tenantry."</p>

  <p>"You offer this refuge to me, prince?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it might be a temporary retreat."</p>

  <p>"How far is it from Palermo?" asked Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>"Six or seven miles, but that by a rough road over the mountains, the Pass
  of Mezzagna, nearer twenty miles through the valley. You follow the stream
  that flows beneath the castle."</p>

  <p>"We should be safe," Philip Calamy sighed. The tension left his face and
  body, he sank back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"So," thought Florio, "that is what he is thinking of, his safety, and, I
  must suppose, some love for her&mdash;for poor Letty."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and it is not so gloomy or desolate as Wilhelmsruhe, and you would
  not need such elaborate disguises. As my guests, you would be unquestioned.
  My steward runs a farm there and the vineyards in the valley."</p>

  <p>"What is the name of this place?"</p>

  <p>"Chiaramonte, near Misilmeri, a poor place, there from the time of the
  Saracens. There is no society."</p>

  <p>"I could have communications addressed to me in Palermo?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly. There is every commodity in Palermo, a capital, a royal
  city."</p>

  <p>"Then, I accept." Philip Calamy rose. "For a while, at least, we can live
  hidden, without restraint, and watch events. As you say, the old man
  may&mdash;must&mdash;die."</p>

  <p>"Do not count on that happening very soon, unless there is another war; he
  is, after all, in the prime of his life. I suppose when he is dead and you
  have married Letty, even your English society will receive you again?"</p>

  <p>The Englishman gave him an inscrutable glance.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, prince," he remarked, slowly, "you consider me an
  adventurer."</p>

  <p>"Only in the sense that we all are."</p>

  <p>"No, no, you think me a rascal, a scoundrel, perhaps meanly born."</p>

  <p>"That, never, I can assure you," smiled Florio.</p>

  <p>"I am a man of quality, closely connected with one of our noblest
  families&mdash;" He broke off as if angry with himself for having said so
  much.</p>

  <p>"The greater your sacrifice," added Florio, gracefully. Then, drawing out
  his pocket-book: "What of passports, travel&mdash;it is a long journey, the
  inns are poor and the roads rough in Sicily. You had better start
  immediately, as the rains begin in six weeks time."</p>

  <p>"I must be indebted to you for all information and maps," replied the
  Englishman. "I shall be relieved to be away from this life of inns."</p>

  <p>"I can contrive your <i>visa</i>, I know the Lord Lieutenant Prince Cuto;
  the King, you know, is a mere figurehead, who lives in retirement. I must
  warn you that the English have a force still in Sicily, but few now, and
  those not likely to trouble you in Chiaramonte. You will use your passport
  name of Latymer?"</p>

  <p>"The name on my passport has been altered several times," said Philip
  Calamy curtly. He seemed baffled, even angered, by the quiet, practical tone
  used by Florio, as if he wished to force some emotional issue and was
  prevented by Florio's manner from so doing.</p>

  <p>"You are performing a good action for us," he said with an air of
  constraint. "Is it because of Letty?"</p>

  <p>"First," replied Florio, "I am not putting myself out by lending you this
  castle that is no use to me, and smoothing your way with Prince Cuto, who is
  discreet and the soul of honour and who will ask no questions of any guest of
  mine, no matter what name you assume. My motives? Curiosity&mdash;and, as I
  have told you before, I am a little in love with Letty&mdash;neither do I
  wish to see any of you, including Colonel Winslow, blotted out in
  tragedy."</p>

  <p>"You are changed from the man I knew in Bologna," remarked Philip Calamy,
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Why, I thought the same of you." Florio was surprised, not having
  considered that he might have altered as much as had the other man. "In what
  way changed?" he added, smiling at himself that he was now the one up for
  judgment.</p>

  <p>"O, you are serious minded," returned the Englishman, ironically,
  "offering me good advice and protection, yet I think you are younger than I
  am.</p>

  <p>"I happen to be in a more fortunate position."</p>

  <p>"You have learnt to keep your temper and are really infernally cool.
  However, there is a great deal that you do not understand."</p>

  <p>"Need I understand?"</p>

  <p>"No, by Heaven! I suppose you have other affairs in your life besides
  mine."</p>

  <p>"Too many, that is why I left them. How did you consider me in
  Bologna?"</p>

  <p>"A fribble, a dilettante, we have such in London. For my part, I was a
  soldier and a man of fashion."</p>

  <p>"And what conclusion is to be drawn from this, Mr. Calamy?"</p>

  <p>The Englishman noticed that his military rank, that Florio did not touch
  on because of Letty's warning, had been dropped and he scowled.</p>

  <p>"O, I do not think that we like one another, prince, and that you follow
  us and offer these favours out of small liking for Letty, who has taken the
  fancy of a <i>blasé</i> youth."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," replied Florio, still unruffled. "But as you intend to accept
  these favours, why quarrel with them?"</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy caught himself up at this, and checked whatever hasty reply
  was on his lips.</p>

  <p>Florio, in compassion for his plight, which was that of a cornered man,
  added: "My feelings for Letty are entirely respectful. I am deliberately
  putting her out of my own reach. I shall do all I can for her comfort at
  Chiaramonte."</p>

  <p>"I hope that this place is not beyond my means to maintain," interrupted
  Philip Calamy abruptly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it is nothing luxurious, a square yellow building with a turret,
  and a farm at the back. Nothing imposing save the situation. I can have some
  furniture sent from my villa in Cefalu, my mother used to spend the winter
  there sometimes. I do not offer this house to you as there are country seats
  of the nobility about, your pretensions would be examined and might not be
  accepted."</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy suddenly smiled and the full beauty of his face was
  revealed.</p>

  <p>"I shall pass as an antiquary," he declared, "engaged in searching for
  classic remains. Several friends of mine were touched with this mania, and
  travelled in search of <i>camei</i> and mosaics, statues and pictures. My
  cousin's place at&mdash;my cousin's house, is full of them. I know nothing of
  this futility, but I can learn, it will pass the time."</p>

  <p>"What was your occupation in London?" asked Florio.</p>

  <p>The Englishman slightly raised his lip as if in hint of a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Occupation? I frequented White's, Almacks, the Opera, the prize ring, the
  cock pit, balls, dinners, my military duties, a few masks, charades." He
  laughed aloud. "It is like conning over the details of another existence, yet
  only two years away."</p>

  <p>"The life of a man of fashion anywhere," commented Florio, "though some of
  your sports are barbarous. I admire you that you surrendered it all for the
  possession of the lady you love in so romantic a fashion."</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"I shall return to Letty and tell her of your generosity of this retreat
  in Sicily. And perhaps, prince, you will honour us by coming to see her
  before we leave Nuremberg?"</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico gracefully accepted this ungraceful invitation. He
  could not yet see the part that Philip Calamy intended him to play in his own
  drama and that of Letty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>§ 19</h2>

  <p class="first">The weather had been fair and dry for overlong, the courtyard in front of
  the Drei Linden was dusty, the leaves on the lime trees curled brittle and
  scorched on the stiff boughs that cast a lattice of shade on the front of the
  inn. Florio sat with Letty in the private parlour that was still littered by
  dolls, toys, clocks and animals carved in wood and ivory.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy had taken out the dog, named, so oddly to Florio's ears,
  Rover.</p>

  <p>The Bolognese was, under his charming manner, at a loss; he did not know
  if he was allowed to see Letty alone out of courtesy, or if the Englishman's
  jealousy would stage a scene of comic opera, a sudden return and denunciation
  of a secret lover, or if there was something deeper in the situation.</p>

  <p>Philip, Calamy knew that Letty was passionately faithful to him and was
  too much under an obligation to Florio to pick a quarrel with him, yet the
  young Italian was not at ease. Besides everything else, he was not sure of
  Letty's intelligence or knowledge, or how far she was a mere instrument of
  her companion's strong will.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will find a sweet repose in Chiaramonte, Letty," he said. "The
  climate is superb, in January it is already the spring, the vistas from the
  old castle are heavenly."</p>

  <p>"What shall I do all day?" she asked, turning over a doll on her knee on
  whom she was stitching a dress of pink taffeta.</p>

  <p>"How did you occupy yourself in your own country?" She looked at him, her
  pretty eyes vague. She hardly knew how she had spent her time, routine had
  kept her up, like a prop.</p>

  <p>"There were friends," she murmured, vaguely. "In the country I was
  weary&mdash;but in London, people came and went, there was
  entertainment&mdash;Oh, it was like Bologna, except that it was by no means
  as fantastic."</p>

  <p>"But you threw away this life of pleasure for the sake of Philip
  Calamy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, oh yes," her tone was film now.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Chiaramonte can be an Arcadia for you. It is not a desert, the
  existence of the countryside will move round you, and you can take your part.
  You will be respected," he added, firmly.</p>

  <p>"I value that more than everything, and I have to thank you for it." She
  looked fully at him, clasping her hands on the doll.</p>

  <p>"It is the best that any friend can do for you, Letty, a retreat like
  this. In a city, or in a villa near the city, you will finally be discovered,
  you will always be moving, with episodes like Wilhelmsruhe&mdash;and
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she agreed. "Always furtive, afraid and in disguise."</p>

  <p>"In Chiaramonte you will be free. Besides, you cannot indefinitely travel
  on forged passports, however cleverly these are done there is always the
  detail that betrays the trick to the eye of a sharp official."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to go to this castle of yours," she answered eagerly. "I
  detested Wilhelmsruhe, I detest this place, I think they suspect us of being
  other than we say we are."</p>

  <p>"And Philip&mdash;is he really pleased to go to Sicily?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, oh yes," she said again but, as he thought, reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Persuade him that it is wiser for him to go, and that only in dreams can
  we play a role without discovery."</p>

  <p>"Philip relishes the adventure," she said, placing the doll, like a child,
  on her knee. "He was always active. It amuses him to cross and foil
  people."</p>

  <p>"I have observed that," replied Florio, wondering if he was destined by
  Calamy to be one of the victims of his deceptive games. "Yet he will go to my
  Sicilian castle because he is afraid."</p>

  <p>"One should not use that word of a man of honour," protested Letty,
  flushing.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, Philip is afraid of being murdered by Colonel Winslow."</p>

  <p>"Murder!" She appeared horrified. "It would be a duel."</p>

  <p>"I do not think so, since seeing your husband&mdash;I should say, Colonel
  Winslow."</p>

  <p>"It does not matter, I always think of him as my husband," said Letty. "It
  is true that he is a most choleric man," she added, forlornly. "And that I
  have destroyed everything he valued."</p>

  <p>"He appeared to me," remarked Florio, "to have lost the taste for living.
  That, if it is so, is his weakness and not your fault. He should be able to
  forget you and build his career with another woman."</p>

  <p>"He does not care for me," explained Letty. "He never did. I told you so,
  prince, before. It is the disgrace."</p>

  <p>"I think he did care, Letty, and does still," smiled Florio. "I think he
  loved you. In love one gives all of oneself, the evil as well as the good,
  only the evil now remains in Colonel Winslow's feeling for you."</p>

  <p>"The evil as well as the good," she repeated. "Then that is true of Philip
  and myself."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing evil in you, Letty."</p>

  <p>"And in Philip?"</p>

  <p>Florio was surprised that she should ask this; in the question seemed to
  be the first hint of a doubt concerning her lover's attitude towards
  herself.</p>

  <p>"You must have all of him, his entire soul, Letty, or your elopement was a
  mere frivolous escapade, and you would not admit that."</p>

  <p>"No. I was all in this action," she interrupted with a quickness he had
  not expected. "But Philip?"</p>

  <p>"With him also it must have been, still is, a passion making all obstacles
  as nothing. Or why did he take you away?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I often think of that. I do not complain of him&mdash;he loves me, I
  know. We are happy, desperately&mdash;it has been worth while. But lately
  these disguises seem to hide him, even from me."</p>

  <p>"As I have promised you, at Chiaramonte there need be no disguises."</p>

  <p>"That white taffeta mask was a hideous concealment for him to
  conceive."</p>

  <p>"Think of it no more. Consider, rather, me a little. I shall begin my
  journey to Bologna as soon as you have started on yours. You will have a
  long, long way to go, Letty, across the plains and hills of Italy, but when
  you reach Sicily you will be safe."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry&mdash;cannot you travel with us, as far as the north of
  Italy?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear Letty, that would attract attention to all of us." He raised her
  hand from the pink skirt of the doll and kissed her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Why did you follow us, prince?"</p>

  <p>"You know that I am in love with you," he smiled, "in a romantic way as if
  you were a rare flower, a fine statue or an uncommon work of art."</p>

  <p>She did not seem able to comprehend this fanciful and chivalrous
  attitude.</p>

  <p>"You hardly know what love is, I think, prince, you could not speak so
  coolly. But I am grateful for your kindness, most of all for your undeserved
  respect."</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico was forced to agree with this judgment. Letty, so
  slight, if so fascinating a creature to him, had an experience that had been
  denied to him. She knew what it was to be transported beyond the restraint of
  even the strongest codes, by a passion that filled her entire being. She
  existed only in and through Philip Calamy. Florio felt a keen admiration for
  such a capacity for love, and an envy for such an experience.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he felt cheated because he could not achieve such a passion
  himself, frustrated because even his pursuit of Letty that involved the
  greatest trouble he had ever been put to for a woman, was not inspired by a
  love such as she felt for Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>He was not jealous of her, did not wish to endeavour to win or snatch her
  from her lover. The affection he felt for her was tender and unselfish, born
  more or less of a whim, a curiosity as to the story of these foreigners that
  he had indulged in order to relieve the tedium of his life, splendid to
  satiety.</p>

  <p>But he could admire this overweening passion he could hardly understand,
  and offer his Sicilian castle.</p>

  <p>"It is of no importance to me," he told himself. "It is vital to
  them."</p>

  <p>Tired with the conversation that had been heavy, like a physical weight,
  and weary with the dry heat of the day, the last of so many hot days in the
  decayed Gothic city, Florio sighed and was silent. For her part, Letty put
  aside the doll in the pink dress and took up another and curled its yellow
  tow locks round her rounded arm.</p>

  <p>Florio considered her, wishing to take her memory away with him, as a
  picture hung in the mind.</p>

  <p>She wore a dress of a faded green, that seemed part of the late summer
  colouring of nature, contrasted as it was with her red hair that, rich and
  glossy, hung down in careless locks from under her muslin cap.</p>

  <p>A pale rose showed in her cheeks and lips, a deep tinted and lively gold
  outlined her eyebrows and lashes. She had now no painting or dyeing to deform
  her native beauties. The arched nose, the pouting underlip that gave her so
  poignant a resemblance to the late Queen of France, added a regal air to her
  expression, and one that, Florio knew, was misleading, for there was nothing
  majestic in the simple nature of poor Letty.</p>

  <p>"If she has been at fault," he thought, "and never used what little reason
  she has, it is because there is something angelic about her that ignores the
  rules of man. She is all passion, all emotion. Under the quiet exterior she
  is capable of heroism."</p>

  <p>He forced himself, out of his languor, to a man's part.</p>

  <p>"I cannot ask Philip, but I ask you, have you funds sufficient for all
  this journeying, hire of carriages and horses?"</p>

  <p>"O, I never think about it, Philip says I must not. He sold an estate, he
  has revenues," she answered vaguely. "Captain Lennard manages his
  affairs."</p>

  <p>"And your own money, and jewels?"</p>

  <p>"I left all behind, in London," she answered, surprised. "Of course, all
  that belongs to my husband. I cannot touch anything."</p>

  <p>"Surely Colonel Winslow would wish to send you your personal effects?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, as if she despaired of making him understand.</p>

  <p>"Then, the clothes, jewels you wore in Bologna?"</p>

  <p>"Philip bought them for me in Paris. I do not know what has become of
  them, perhaps he has sold them again. What does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"Then you have nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing." She caressed the doll. "Save Philip."</p>

  <p>"I must believe that sufficient."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, looking at her curiously, envying her certainty of love;
  even his own offers of help, so pure in intention and so needed, seemed to
  him an interference. He knew the value all the women of his acquaintance set
  on jewels and rich appointments, and he remembered how Letty had shone in
  Bologna. Therefore he could measure the extent of the devotion that did not
  even ask where all her possessions were.</p>

  <p>She wore but a wedding ring, not that, he supposed, that her husband had
  placed on her finger.</p>

  <p>"If misfortune overtakes Philip, send for me," he said, rising, "as if you
  sent for a brother."</p>

  <p>Her brilliant, prominent eyes shone with gratitude; he could see that she
  was touched, that this was exactly the manner of help she valued. But she
  was, also, confident in her destiny.</p>

  <p>"Nothing will happen to Philip."</p>

  <p>She rose also, holding out her hands. She was enchanting when at ease and
  happy, she was made for smiles and a light heart.</p>

  <p>"Philip is coming to see me to-night for the practical issues of this
  Sicilian venture. There is one promise that he must make to me&mdash;to call
  me if you are in any peril or even inconvenience."</p>

  <p>She looked doubtful at that, as if this pledge might lessen the manly
  pride of her lover, but Florio wondered if she really understood the man for
  whom she had so cheerfully thrown away the golden gifts with which fortune
  had endowed her so bountifully.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>§ 20</h2>

  <p class="first">But this was not the pledge that Florio demanded from Philip Calamy when
  they met that night in the Blaue Stern.</p>

  <p>Candles had been lit, the long summer heat had broken and the rain could
  be heard falling in the invisible trees of the moonless dark beyond the
  closed windows.</p>

  <p>Florio was aware that this setting of a quiet inn room was not suitable to
  either of them. Acutely aware of his own background, he wondered about that
  of the other man. He had never visited England, and believed that his guesses
  as to the society that had formed Philip Calamy and Letty were probably
  awry.</p>

  <p>He was also conscious that he felt no friendliness towards the Englishman,
  though at one time he had thought him agreeable but trivial, now he knew that
  he was not the person he thought him to have been and that he was indifferent
  towards him, would even have been hostile, had it not been beneath him to
  feel so strongly. He endeavoured, out of courtesy, to make what he said
  harmless, yet he did not intend Philip Calamy to escape all obligations for
  the services he had solicited.</p>

  <p>It was the Englishman who, bluntly, put forward the subject that Florio
  was considering.</p>

  <p>"You have helped me, prince, and to a man like you an expression of
  gratitude is an insult&mdash;something, however, you expect from me."</p>

  <p>Florio refused to be forced to the point; there was a touch of impatience
  in the Englishman's attitude, as if he wished to be done with a tiresome
  business, and to this Florio would not concede.</p>

  <p>He placed a packet of papers on the table between them.</p>

  <p>"These will help you through Italy and Sicily, pray do not forge any more
  credentials or passports."</p>

  <p>"Is that what you wanted to ask of me?" demanded Philip Calamy
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"One of the things. I am no longer Signor Miola. We have set aside our
  masks and I have put my name to the papers."</p>

  <p>"I'll not abuse it," replied the other, coolly placing the papers in the
  pocket of his shabby summer coat. "Is there anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;there <i>is</i> something else that you must promise not to
  abuse, and that is Letty Winslow."</p>

  <p>"Must!" The Englishman repeated the one word with a malicious inflection,
  quickly softened his tone and added: "It is odd that you should suppose I
  need warnings as to my conduct towards Letty, since you know what I have paid
  for her, a very high price."</p>

  <p>"That might be, in time, resented."</p>

  <p>"I am deeply in love with her, need I say more?"</p>

  <p>Florio found these words too smooth, Philip Calamy's beautiful face too
  expressionless.</p>

  <p>"As one man of honour to another," he added, "I assure you that I have now
  only one possession dear to me, one object in my life, and that is Letty
  Winslow."</p>

  <p>After this, Florio could not force the grave promise that he had intended
  to extort. Promise or word of honour, what was the difference?</p>

  <p>He could not have Calamy watched at Chiaramonte, that would be beneath
  him. Besides, his ironic wit soon told him it would set a difficult set of
  suspicions in motion if he were to ask his Sicilian servants to report on his
  guests, and it would not be easy to have messages sent swiftly and secretly
  from Bologna to Chiaramonte.</p>

  <p>He would have to trust Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>"I told Letty to send for me if she needed help," he remarked. "My reason?
  I think because there is no other person in the world to whom she could send.
  And some accident might happen to you."</p>

  <p>The Englishman smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it sounds a lonely place, this castle of yours, I have not even a
  servant of my own."</p>

  <p>"How will you occupy yourself? I ask again, seriously," asked Florio,
  feeling acutely the loneliness of the life these two outcasts were
  accepting.</p>

  <p>"I shall write my memoirs and study viniculture," replied the Englishman,
  unexpectedly. "Moreover, I am really interested in antiquaries. I travelled
  on the continent before, soon after the revolution, and bought cheaply. I had
  several cabinets of curiosities."</p>

  <p>Florio admired this energy; he felt he had been foolish to imagine
  loneliness in Chiaramonte, they would have their love and Calamy was
  obviously a man of energy and resource. As a moment before he had pitied
  them, he now envied them.</p>

  <p>Studying his thoughtful, comely face, on which was a cast of melancholy,
  Philip Calamy suddenly laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are spending a good deal on us, prince, and none of the reasons you
  give is very plausible; a whim, a fancy for Letty, who is no great
  beauty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say that I am a very rich man," interrupted Florio, "in a country where
  most of the nobility are poor, and that these riches are chance marriages in
  my family into the families of Bankers in Genoa and Venice, early deaths,
  leaving me sole heir to much wealth then, all the best of life pressed on me
  before I was twenty years of age."</p>

  <p>"That is something of my history also," put in Philip Calamy, "save that I
  never had enough money. My uncle is extremely wealthy, but I am no favourite
  of his. Well, you, pampered by fortune, found us entertaining, is that your
  motive?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Florio firmly. "I have never lacked entertainment. I was
  tempted by the novelty of exercising power over other human beings. I
  followed you, feeling I had you in a fowler's net that I could draw close at
  will."</p>

  <p>"But that was not so easy."</p>

  <p>"No. You showed an unexpected cunning. But it came my way to meet Colonel
  Winslow and interfere in his destiny and yours."</p>

  <p>"Thereby saving my life, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. I wished to save him also. And always I was thinking of Letty
  Winslow, how harmless she was, and how happy, and how, if you left her or
  were slain by her husband, she would die abandoned and stupidly." Florio
  rose. "Why pry into my motives? I have been useful to you and you have
  promised me that Letty Winslow shall always be in the forefront of your
  care."</p>

  <p>"Which promise is ridiculous, since I left all I had for her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet, not so ridiculous, since I asked it, and there might come some pass
  in which your memory of your word to me would be a stay, cause a reflection,
  a pause."</p>

  <p>"You think I shall desert Letty. That seems absurd. Why must you even
  think of it?" Philip Calamy spoke with more energy than he had yet shown. "I
  think you do not understand. Letty told me that you did not understand. We
  have no longer anything to lose. We have cut ourselves off from everything.
  We must always live in exile. Why do we do these things?" He also rose and
  stood listening to the steady rain. "Out of stupidity, or carelessness?"</p>

  <p>"From a great passion."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that." Philip Calamy turned his head, so nobly set on his wide
  shoulders, so that he eluded Florio's gaze. His shadow, thickened by the
  outline of the overcoat with capes, was cast by the candlelight on the
  whitewashed wall. He was in all his gestures, movements and words, even when
  he imposed a restraint, a coldness, on himself, full of strength and
  grace.</p>

  <p>Florio admired him, still without liking him; still without completely
  understanding him He regretted that he must part from these people, so
  commonplace in much, merely to him the stock figures of the Comedy, yet, also
  in much, so alien and so strange.</p>

  <p>Bologna, where he must return, seemed to him stale; he felt no pleasure at
  the thought of seeing his friends again, he had no near relatives and no
  woman who held his special interest.</p>

  <p>He would, he told himself, miss this pursuit, the wandering up and down
  Wurtemberg and Bavaria. He would miss Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy stood silent, as if waiting for the other man to dismiss
  him, thus acknowledging that he received favours, but there was no humility
  in his air and bearing.</p>

  <p>"I must bid you a fair journey," said Florio, "and not detain you from
  Letty, sitting alone in that inn."</p>

  <p>"She has her dolls."</p>

  <p>The tone was meaningless, but the words moved Florio to ask: "Does she
  ever think of her children?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know all her thoughts." Philip Calamy faced the other man, and
  the candlelight was golden over his composed face. "She saw little of them
  when at home. Why must you puzzle over Letty? She is an ordinary woman."</p>

  <p>"Her affection for you cannot be ordinary. Where a hundred married women
  of her rank would carry on a clandestine intrigue, not one would elope with
  her lover."</p>

  <p>"Then I have an incomparable creature," smiled Philip Calamy, "and my joy
  is immense, if secret." Florio bowed formally.</p>

  <p>"Will you write to me when you arrive in Chiaramonte?" he asked. "I shall
  wish to know that everything is for your comfort. I have made out the papers
  in the name of Steffens that you say is in your family."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you desired me to keep as near the truth as possible. I can assure
  you of my discretion."</p>

  <p>Florio accompanied him to the entrance of the inn, and opened the heavy
  door on the empty, dark market place and the steady slant of the rain.</p>

  <p>The Englishman held a small dark lantern he had brought with him, as he
  raised the shutter a long beam was cast out into the darkness, and the
  falling drops were shown swiftly descending and vanishing, from dark to
  dark.</p>

  <p>"I must hope that you will not need my hospitality long," said Florio.</p>

  <p>On which the Englishman, pulling his hat over his eyes, asked: "What do
  you hope for us?"</p>

  <p>"That your enemy, so much older than yourself, will die or set free his
  victim."</p>

  <p>"I thank you for your good wishes."</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy touched his hand to his hat and strode over the cobbles,
  along the crooked houses that edged the Square, the beam of his lantern going
  steadily before him. It was not until this light had vanished abruptly, as
  the bearer of it passed round the angle of a jutting wall into a side street,
  that Florio returned to the inn parlour that seemed to his excited fancy more
  than usually foreign and lonely.</p>

  <p>Bonino, who had been waiting for the departure of the detested Englishman,
  came to offer his services, but his master preferred solitude.</p>

  <p>He sat by the newly-trimmed candles and the small wood fire that had been
  lit against the first damp of autumn, and listened to the rain falling, and
  thought of Philip Calamy returning to the inn behind the linden trees where
  Letty Winslow waited with her dolls and toys.</p>

  <p>He was fatigued and sat heavily in the worn leather cushioned chair. He
  was alone and it seemed as if he had shut himself up with an enemy. He was
  exhausting himself with concerns that were none of his affairs.</p>

  <p>They were gone and, in the tumult that was the modern world, some change
  would soon free them from their southern seclusion, some accident, some
  chance would hurry them on their way again.</p>

  <p>He found it strange that he was so moved by Letty's condemnation of
  herself. This had caused him to reconsider the standard she had defied, and
  to feel that she had committed a powerful fault, lost her integrity and been
  justly condemned.</p>

  <p>It was her acceptance of her punishment that had made him consider that
  her infidelity was not the triviality he had thought it until recently.</p>

  <p>Nominally a member of a Church that dealt lightly with offences against a
  social code that nevertheless she upheld, Florio had followed the manners of
  his time and place that regarded the preservation of outward appearances as
  sufficient. Inwardly, and outwardly too when among his equals, Florio was a
  freethinker and judged no one for breaking necessary but tedious conventions.
  It was Letty herself who had set other standards. Through her eyes he now saw
  her husband, not as a ridiculous figure of comedy, the elderly wittol, but as
  a profoundly wronged human being.</p>

  <p>He could even now understand, by an effort of his subtle imagination, the
  narrow, yet frivolous life from which Letty had fled; the point of view of
  her sisters-in-law, her family and her friends. There had been the country
  life, decorous, stiff, bridged with rules and prohibitions, that Letty had
  been too ignorant and too light minded to find satisfying. And there had been
  the easy, cynical life of London, that yet kept a respectable surface, where
  Letty did not really belong. And then there had been the headlong elopement,
  breaking all the rules of the game, shocking alike the puritan and those of
  easy virtue. Florio could picture the return of the husband from India where,
  no doubt, he had adorned his stern profession with more than routine
  gallantry, to the lonely young wife on whom he doted with the possessive
  affection of a man passing his prime and for the first time gratified by his
  own establishment.</p>

  <p>It had, evidently, been that, the estate, the family, and all appertaining
  that Englishmen valued so highly. And then he had found this citadel laid
  low, ransacked, the treasure despoiled. And the despoiler had been a junior
  officer of his own regiment, who was in England, while he, the obedient
  soldier, had been exposing all his fortunes to the total hazard of war.</p>

  <p>Florio could understand the agony endured by Colonel Winslow, and he
  himself experienced a qualm in considering the abandoned children of whom
  Letty never spoke.</p>

  <p>He could not discover the chronology of this story. How old was Letty? How
  long had she been married? How long left? And Colonel Winslow was two years
  behind the lovers. Perhaps the long voyage from India had devoured some of
  this time and no one had told him by letter of his tragedy, or letters had
  missed him on the way, or he had been ill from shock on his return, or
  detained, harshly scrupulous as he was, by his military duties.</p>

  <p>Well, the time had passed and yet he was still consumed by a passion for
  revenge.</p>

  <p>Liberal, tolerant and even tempered, Florio did not know what it was to
  feel this passion. He could not conceive of wishing to inflict punishment on
  anyone. Those he ceased to like he would leave, with an amiable gesture. It
  had not yet happened to him to be left, he had too much to offer. This
  terrible emotion was, then, to him but a curiosity, but he could not doubt
  that it ravaged Colonel Winslow.</p>

  <p>Florio sighed, stirred and quenched one of the candles that had guttered
  to the stick.</p>

  <p>He believed that Philip Calamy would keep his word passed to him about
  Letty's happiness, for there they were at one, a gentleman's code of honour
  was the same everywhere. She was, therefore, safe from any desertion or
  betrayal on the part of her lover. "Strange," Florio thought, "that I had to
  exact that pledge from a man, who, as he remarked himself, had thrown away
  all for love. And, besides, I do not really distrust him, it was only my
  great compassion for Letty, who is so helpless, that made me wish to exact
  that promise."</p>

  <p>He wondered if he would ever see either Letty or her lover again, and knew
  that it rested with himself if he did so or not.</p>

  <p>Already he had been bountiful towards them, there was no strain on him to
  oblige them further.</p>

  <p>It would not affect him if they occupied his Sicilian castle indefinitely.
  If Calamy needed money no doubt, thought Florio with a smile, he would apply
  for it, and it could be sent, but probably the couple were well provided with
  these funds sent by loyal friends&mdash;one at least, there was, this Captain
  Lennard Giles&mdash;from Calamy's English fortune.</p>

  <p>The second candle guttered out unheeded, and Florio sat by the light of
  one flame only, contending with his enemy who was himself, with whom he was,
  when alone, in conflict.</p>

  <p>For he desired both to forget these people and take them lightly, as a
  mere kindly amusement, and to follow their story to the end; he wished both
  to think of Letty as a foolish creature, who had stirred his idle fancy, and
  as a tragic woman whom he might come to love profoundly, with a spiritual
  love, for the courage with which she had broken the laws of her society, and
  the constancy with which she still admitted their validity. This conflict was
  not resolved. They had parted, that was all that seemed to matter to Florio;
  the inn, the decayed Gothic city seemed empty. The steady fall of the rain
  between the two inns separated them like an abyss.</p>

  <p>Florio took the solitary candle and went upstairs to his ancient, gaunt
  bedchamber. Bonino, watchful as a dog, on guard from the closet where he
  slept, saw his master fling off his coat, then toss himself on to the bed,
  quenching the last candle with his bare hand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>§ 21</h2>

  <p class="first">In the other inn, Philip Calamy entered upon Letty seated among the dolls
  that she had dressed and laid in their boxes.</p>

  <p>"This is a dull solitude!" she exclaimed, looking up nervously. "Why did
  you leave me alone so long?"</p>

  <p>"Your good friend must have his say." With a rapid change of voice and
  manner the Englishman began to mimic the Bolognese, making a parody of his
  slow, careful academic English, his languid manners, his formal courtesy, all
  of which were unconscious, but that Philip Calamy made appear as
  affectations.</p>

  <p>"He <i>has</i> been <i>our</i> good friend," said Letty. "Where should we
  have been without his opportune offer?"</p>

  <p>"I should have devised something, my love. But I admit that it is
  convenient to be well out of your husband's way for the present."</p>

  <p>"Then do not deride Prince Florio."</p>

  <p>"O, I perceive you have a tender regard for him. No doubt you consider his
  exertions are entirely because of your charms, my love."</p>

  <p>"I care nothing about that."</p>

  <p>"You do well not to flatter yourself over much, Letty. This pampered
  worldling finds us diverting. The custom of infidelity in married women is
  one much tolerated in Italy&mdash;an elopement is startling."</p>

  <p>"Prince Florio," she protested, "is not so cold as you infer, he is
  chivalrous and romantic."</p>

  <p>"Your head is still full of novelettes from the circulating library,
  Letty. Chivalry! Romance! When did either exist save in the daydreams of
  women."</p>

  <p>"Do not be moody," she implored, turning her fair face towards him. "I
  could be happy, if you were. This is a respite that is offered to us."</p>

  <p>"A respite?" he demanded. "What do you suppose our life will be in that
  desolate place that is offered us?"</p>

  <p>"Philip," Letty replied with earnest warmth, "you know how hateful
  everything has been to me since we left Bologna."</p>

  <p>"That means you cannot endure a little hardship, my love. <i>Before</i> we
  left Bologna, your life was as gay as London."</p>

  <p>"It was more secure," she murmured. "But what is so detestable to me is
  the flight, always moving, one inn after another, then Wilhelmsruhe, so
  gloomy, so lonely."</p>

  <p>"There will not be much improvement at this Chiaramonte, it is given to us
  because it is desolate."</p>

  <p>"There will be the sun, we shall not be shut in by trees. Then there need
  be no disguise. I was always afraid of your white mask and of having to
  pretend to be a French princess."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose that I liked my role of servant? Those tricks saved
  us."</p>

  <p>"I know, and you were clever to think of them."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I was," replied Philip Calamy, coolly. "I think you forget, my
  love, that twice your husband nearly caught us."</p>

  <p>"Forget? Shall I ever forget that night in Dinkelsbuhl, when we slept in
  the same inn?"</p>

  <p>"And at Wilhelmsruhe, if I had not found that clever rascal, August, your
  husband would have come upon us. My love, twice these disguises you so
  dislike have got us out of peril. And why do you dislike them? In London you
  were wild enough and enjoyed a masquerade as much as any woman I knew."</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy spoke quietly, perhaps with indifference. He never referred
  to the past and she admired his rigorous discipline and copied it, so now she
  did not take up this glancing hint at her former life, but sat silent, her
  head in her hand, her elbow on the table where stood the small lamp, her red
  locks hanging carelessly over her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Why in a brown study, Letty?" he asked. "You are pleased, I thought, that
  your <i>cavaliere servente</i> should have found you this retreat."</p>

  <p>He began again to imitate Florio San Quirico, and spoke with derision of
  his long hair, his melancholy face, his tastes of an amateur of the arts.</p>

  <p>"Is not all this trifling?" asked Letty, with a beseeching glance. "The
  Prince is very well in his person and I do think that he is kind and
  generous."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I am jealous of him?" smiled Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>"Alas, I know you are not! I should like you to be a little jealous."</p>

  <p>"To be jealous in Italy is to make a fool of oneself&mdash;if Colonel
  Winslow had claimed you there he would have been laughed at, and we should
  have been applauded."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, did we fly from him?"</p>

  <p>"Because he might have killed me first."</p>

  <p>Letty sighed.</p>

  <p>"What is our future to be, Philip? We are so young&mdash;after this
  Sicilian interlude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not like you to make calculations, Letty. I suppose Colonel Winslow
  will die of apoplexy or be killed in the next war before long."</p>

  <p>"What difference would that make, Philip?" she asked. "Even when we were
  married we could never return to England."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her quickly, trying to read her expression.</p>

  <p>"We might live in Paris," he suggested, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that would not be the same as London; I suppose no one would receive
  me, yet once I was your wife I should not care so deeply about that; but as
  long as you love me, Philip&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The plea was familiar, he had heard it frequently since the flight from
  Bologna. Before that she had been too occupied with gaiety and the brilliant
  social life, for which her charms and graces so well fitted her, to make such
  constant demands on his attention.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy gave his usual answer.</p>

  <p>"If I did not love you I should not be here."</p>

  <p>"You say that every time." She spoke with the self-confidence of a
  constantly flattered woman. "Remember I have no one save yourself."</p>

  <p>"So Prince Florio reminded me. I had to promise to treat you well. He has
  a strong sentimental regard for you."</p>

  <p>"He respects me."</p>

  <p>"Why, Letty?" asked Philip Calamy, half laughing. "I mean, you are such a
  silly little thing."</p>

  <p>She was pleased with his good humour and took his comment as an
  endearment.</p>

  <p>"I mean that he does not consider me disgraced. You know, Philip, how
  delicate a point that is with me.</p>

  <p>"I have remarked to you, several times, Letty, that none of Prince
  Florio's countrymen would consider you disgraced."</p>

  <p>She could not answer this, but she knew that in the regard of Florio San
  Quirico was an esteem beyond mere indifference.</p>

  <p>"O, I am tired!" she exclaimed suddenly. "I shall be glad when we are away
  from this melancholy, decayed country."</p>

  <p>"Already beginning to live in the future, Letty?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"That you are not happy in the present."</p>

  <p>"I told you I was not, Philip&mdash;the flight, the disguise."</p>

  <p>"We shall be disguised in Sicily."</p>

  <p>"That will be different. We shall assume our own rank, our own characters.
  O, I am tired!"</p>

  <p>"Go to bed then, my love. I shall have some preparations to make for our
  journey to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Letty rose, hesitant. She felt light headed, as if, in these surroundings
  to which she could never become accustomed, she had lost her identity.</p>

  <p>When she had been living daintily and splendidly openly with her lover
  passing as her husband, she had, save in moments of secret depression, felt
  sure of herself as a woman pleased and pleasing, upheld by the brilliant
  society that accepted her without question. Since she had been a fugitive,
  pretending different characters, she had felt unsure of herself.</p>

  <p>And to-night there was the rain, an unfamiliar sound, after this long, dry
  summer, and the thought of the early departure on the morrow for a long
  journey.</p>

  <p>More, there was Philip. She did not want to admit it, but there was a fear
  of estrangement in her tired heart. They had been divided by the parts of
  mistress and servant they had taken, by the fear that drove them on,
  absorbing all their senses; in a sense, also, by the interference of Florio
  San Quirico in their destiny, by the traders at Nuremberg. Their situation
  was as unreal as it was misleading, Letty thought. Something had passed in
  the harmony there had been between them. Certainly, she admitted during the
  two years before the letters from Lennard Giles arrived, they had often been
  distracted from one another, but always by amusements or cheerful
  companions.</p>

  <p>Never before had they been so much alone together and never had Letty felt
  so far apart. "Terror," she mused, "has had a numbing effect upon our love.
  But in Sicily everything will be different."</p>

  <p>"Why do you linger?" he asked. "I have a great deal to do. There are all
  these dolls and trifles to be disposed of."</p>

  <p>"Do you concern yourself with them?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her across the darkness of the candlelit room faintly
  dispersed by the glow of her little lamp.</p>

  <p>"I have to be careful with money, even with the smallest sum," he said,
  and turned again to his packing, moving in and out of the gloom, so feebly
  lit by the one flame, as Florio San Quirico had been lit by the one flame in
  the other inn divided from them by the rain that they could hear falling
  steadily through the windless night.</p>

  <p>"I'll not hamper you," she said softly.</p>

  <p>She thought: "What a strange employment he has. He seems a different
  person from the Philip I knew so well."</p>

  <p>Aloud she asked: "What do you mean, care about money? We have, surely,
  sufficient, with the price of the lands you sold?"</p>

  <p>He answered precisely, not looking at her, as if he concealed bitterness
  or vexation.</p>

  <p>"Have I ever asked your concern in these matters?"</p>

  <p>"No, yet now you mentioned it, as if it were important to sell these poor
  toys. Then, how are we to travel? I have not had a servant since Adriana
  Beheim left."</p>

  <p>"I cannot afford one for the journey. You will have servants at
  Chiaramonte."</p>

  <p>"O, I do not care. I leave everything to you, I have heaped all on you, I
  submit to everything. I have not even asked where my clothes and jewels have
  gone. O, I lay no charge on you, only love me."</p>

  <p>"I think I do," she thought that he was smiling, though she could not see
  his face, "a little, as Florio San Quirico loves you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, more than a little, Philip!" She longed for the warm and controlling
  intimacy of his closest affection, but dared not press him farther. All her
  strength and courage depended on him, all her emotions encircled him, giddy
  and full of lassitude as she was she expressed obedience, hoping to draw him
  towards her, into forgetting his occupation, to her so paltry.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy did not respond. He made no movement towards her as she
  stood, hesitant, at the door.</p>

  <p>Letty went to her humble bedroom, taking the candle that was set for her
  on the stairs and lighting it with an unsteady hand, the flint striking
  several times vainly on the steel.</p>

  <p>Seated on the hard chair by the window, Letty listened to the rain. She
  felt a regret for she knew not what loss, and broken pictures of her past
  life, still so short, rose before her fatigued mind.</p>

  <p>Some of her blurred and distorted memories were the same as those that had
  disturbed Colonel Winslow during his labyrinth of journeying across Europe.
  They were of water meadows, smooth lawns sloping to the river, a handsome
  house, with long windows open on the summer warmth.</p>

  <p>She had found that home tedious, even the company of her two children had
  been vapid. She saw them so seldom, her husband's sisters were always
  scolding her on their behalf. She considered, they declared, herself more
  than her infants. She had gone to London, to stay with a fashionable friend
  who encouraged her coquettish ways; and after that, everything was Philip
  Calamy. She tried to put these tremulous recollections from her mind and
  heart; she would think of last summer when they had passed the
  <i>villeggiatura</i> with members of the Bolognese world of fashion at the
  Villa Aria. Florio had played the violoncello&mdash;they had danced in the
  gardens, she had been admired, Letty Latymer, the beautiful Englishwoman.</p>

  <p>The attention paid her had been most flattering. Philip had been proud of
  her, it had really been as if she were his wife, as if Richard Winslow had
  never even existed.</p>

  <p>She had had liveried servants and had never thought of money. Philip had
  lived extravagantly in London and she had always supposed him rich, she had
  heard his uncle spoken of as one of the wealthiest men in the country, and
  though Philip was two young lives off the succession to the title, she had
  never known him want for anything.</p>

  <p>Taking her one candle to the glass, she considered herself. She was not
  beautiful, surely&mdash;no, it had been her air of distinction, of high
  breeding, her gay temper, the dashing manner in which she could wear
  sumptuous fashions, that had engaged the admiration of the Bolognese. She had
  been more sought after in Italy than in London, and there had been no
  reproaches, no unkindness, no criticism.</p>

  <p>It had been, in a way, a fairy land and, like a fairy land, it had
  vanished and the future was shadowy. Her thoughts, as she put out her candle
  and in the dark took off her mean clothes, were of Florio San Quirico, in the
  other inn, across the ancient Gothic city, divided from her by the cobbled
  streets, the crooked houses, the pelting rain. Although she was entirely
  occupied by Philip Calamy, she could not forget the services given her by
  this agreeable man, with his fluent use of her native language, his great
  wealth and power, his readiness to employ all this for her benefit.</p>

  <p>She fell asleep, thinking of him. After a little while Phillip Calamy
  softly entered the room, a lit candle in his hand that he raised on high. He
  stood staring down at her red hair, then turned away abruptly to the closet
  where he had his bed.</p>

  <h3>END OF PART I</h3>
  <hr>

  <h2>PART 2</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>§ 22</h2>

  <p class="first">FLORIO SAN QUIRICO travelled elegantly in Sicily, pausing for a while at
  his villa in Cefalu, the former Greek town that once on the bluff headland
  had withstood the Roman fleet, but that now lay along the beach at the foot
  of the cliffs, behind the walls built to keep out the raiding corsairs, and
  overtopped by the ruins on the summit of the bold hills. Florio's villa was
  situate among the broken rocks that lined the avenue that led gently along a
  low ridge into the town, with the cathedral's two towers on the shore and the
  gaunt outline of the once princely castle on the heights, standing out
  clearly against the vivid sky.</p>

  <p>This residence, though tolerable only in the Spring, was liked by Florio
  because of its air of fantasy.</p>

  <p>The white building, with porticoes and terraces designed for the enjoyment
  of air and sun, was screened from the blaze of the Sicilian heat by the flat
  boughs of blue black cypress trees that rose higher than the casino, and the
  more delicate fronds of date palms.</p>

  <p>Beyond the garden, outlined by a balustrade of alabaster, the sharp rocks,
  of porphyry or jasper, stretched down to the sea, festooned by dark ivy
  garlands and interspersed by the grotesque shapes of the prickly pear cactus.
  On the lower reaches were almond and olive trees, some vineyards, with the
  vines, unsupported, lying along the hot earth, and set here and there, among
  the sparkling rocks, in plantations, in the gardens of the villas and growing
  almost to the verge of the brilliant waves were the manna trees, the plumes
  of white blossoms, the clear green foliage adding beauty and gaiety to a
  landscape already bright.</p>

  <p>The carriage road from Palermo to Mersina ran along the coast only as far
  as Cefalu and, as thus the coast journey between the two great cities of the
  island had to be accomplished on horse back, Cefalu and the adjacent villas
  were much isolated, and to one of Florio San Quirico's turn of mind, the
  quiet place merged into the past and had little to force the present on his
  philosophic mood. The beacon towers on the olive covered cliffs might yet be
  filled with men waiting to give the signal that the Barbary pirates were
  sighted; the blue bays formed by the jutting cliffs of yellow limestone, the
  snowy crest of Monte San Calogero, were the same as they had been during the
  Carthaginian and the punic wars, and when Frederick Hohenstaufen had named
  San Calogero&mdash;"the most splendid." The Norman churches, chapels and
  monasteries, many of them in ruins, that stood among groves of sumach and
  fields of tulips, spurge and purple stock, slid into place in the panorama of
  his imagination, and became part of a vast perspective charged with the
  decayed churches of Nuremberg, the chapel that had become a chemist's shop at
  Stuttgart, the Badhaus of Rippoldsau, the various inns behind their lime
  trees and the heavy signs of South Germany, where he had stayed his travels.
  Those travels had passed into his dreams; save there, the Forest no longer
  existed and he had left forever the park named Solitude, the post houses,
  their formal, dark bedchambers, the impersonal parlours, the tall room where
  Letty Winslow had sat with her dolls, and that other chamber, at the sign of
  the Blue Star, where he had listened to the slanting rain that separated
  them, like a curtain drawn across the tiled gabled houses, the narrow twisted
  cobbled streets, the empty market places.</p>

  <p>The episodes of the masked lackey and the grave-like mound in the blue and
  gold summer house, of Letty in a dark wig, of Colonel Winslow at Bode's, of
  Wilhelmsruhe, with the fine shawls thrown down in the deserted room and the
  posy of flowers on the window sill, were now as remote from his reality as
  any <i>Roman noir</i> he had ever glanced at in amused curiosity, any of
  those tales of Gothic horror his circle in Bologna had repeated with a jest
  when some one had chanced on a volume of <i>Phantasmagoria</i> written by a
  gloomy German amateur of the ghostly and the horrible.</p>

  <p>For it was as ghostly and horrible that he recalled that late summer in
  Wurtemberg and Bavaria, a year ago. Yet there had been nothing dreadful about
  the fugitives or in his pursuit of them.</p>

  <p>Colonel Winslow he had sent harmlessly on his misdirected way. Letty he
  had seen in a quiet mood, humbly clad, without other disguise than that.
  Philip Calamy had accepted his services in a matter of fact manner, yet, in
  the remembrance, all had an outline of the haunted and the terrible, as if he
  viewed them through the delirium of the fever that had infected him, at
  Stuttgart, from the quantities of over ripe and slightly rotting grapes that
  sent out the <i>mal aria</i> from the crowded terrace vineyards that ringed
  the town. Philip Calamy had written a civil, guarded letter, signed in his
  assumed name of Steffens, as soon as he had reached Chiaramonte, that
  expressed his satisfaction at the retreat in Misilmeri. This had been
  followed by other epistles, equally correct, and once there had been a
  billet, prettily sealed, from Letty, offering her gratitude for her "sweet
  tranquillity," not disturbed even by an echo from her former existence.</p>

  <p>Florio took this to mean that her husband had returned to England and put
  Letty out of his well ordered and successful career. Perhaps the outraged
  gentleman had already divorced his fugitive wife, but Florio supposed that
  Philip Calamy's friends would communicate with him, even at Chiaramonte; he
  had asked about facilities for post and banking at Palermo.</p>

  <p>For his part, Florio had endeavoured to forget them. The steward of his
  Misilmeri estate, Mario Roccaforte, had written his yearly account and
  epistle, in which he mentioned, without curiosity, his master's English
  guests soon after their arrival.</p>

  <p>Florio had often pictured Letty, secure in the affections of her lover,
  and she had become to him something of the distant princess in the enchanted
  castle, safeguarded from care by her own dim unreality.</p>

  <p>The posts were slow and difficult. Florio's last letter had not been
  answered and it was several months since he had heard of them when he started
  on the long journey to Sicily.</p>

  <p>Now, pausing at Cefalu, he debated with himself as to whether he wished to
  proceed to Chiaramonte, or, after lingering in a sunny leisure in Sicily,
  return to Bologna. The winter that he had passed there had resembled all the
  winters of his life. He had been rallied on the sudden flight of his elegant
  English friends and his (as it was suspected among the wits) following of
  them, then this agreeable tattle had died away. The same ladies were offered
  in exchange for his titles and fortunes, the same friends met him at cards,
  masks and the theatre; the same acquaintances bowed to him when they passed
  him by the fountain of Neptune, the palazzo del Podesta, by the tall red
  towers, or who sat near him on the days of <i>festa</i> in the basilica of
  San Petronio.</p>

  <p>Now he had left them all and they also seemed remote, although so
  familiar. All these places and people were effaced by the clear sunshine, the
  hot landscape, the sharp, glittering rocks, hung with the hard shapes of dark
  ivy, the lavish white blossom of the manna trees, and the imposing outlines
  of mountains, castle and snowy crag against the blue brilliancy of the
  heavens.</p>

  <p>Florio avoided Palermo, where he had many acquaintances, and left Cefalu
  only to visit the baths of Sciacca on the summit of Monte San Calogero.</p>

  <p>The springs were not yet open for the invalids who yearly resorted to the
  Saracenic courts, enlarged by Greek monks where the waters, on their way to
  the groves of fan palms and the sea, possessed such refreshing properties as
  to acquire the name of <i>aqua santa.</i></p>

  <p>Bonino, who accompanied his master on this pilgrimage, was impressed by
  the wild and unearthly, as he considered, nature of the spot, with the
  echoing grottos that penetrated the mountain side, sacred, the cicerone told
  them, to some pagan demons, and the roar of hidden streams plunging unseen to
  the sea, that rose from the wells and shafts sunk in the sulphureous
  rock.</p>

  <p>The boiling vapours that arose from these apertures, and billowed from the
  various caverns that sloped away from the steep and rocky track, caused
  Bonino now and again to cross himself, with a flashing thought that the
  priests' talk to which he had hardly lent an ear in Bologna might be
  true.</p>

  <p>The cicerone related the fable of San Calogero, who had been sent by St.
  Peter to attack and disperse the devils clustering in the crevices of the
  bare mountain above even the stunted dwarf palm, and to bless their lurking
  places so that they became healthful springs for the afflicted in body.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico went ahead, even of the guide; there was but the one
  path and that, he knew, led directly to the summit of the mountain where was
  the ancient hermitage of the Greek saint.</p>

  <p>He wore a fine silk coat and a straw hat, and the heat enveloped him like
  a cloak, but as he neared the crest of the mountain, from which the circle of
  snow had scarcely melted, he called to Bonino to bring him his travelling
  mantle to wear against the chill. The guide sprang ahead, eager to display
  the last modern buildings erected by the monks for the visitors to the baths,
  but Florio dismissed him and turned, solitary, to the ancient hermitage, and
  from there gazed across the superb vista, the broken rocks that strewed the
  mountain, the clouds of sulphureous vapour giving place to lavishly fertile
  plains covered with vines, almond trees and grain, to the lofty peak of Luna
  d'oro, and the coast line bounding the quivering dazzle of the violet blue
  sea, a brilliant sweep from Girgenti to Granetola and the isle of Pantellaria
  shimmering in the purple haze.</p>

  <p>"I shall never," thought Florio, "be further away from all distractions.
  Here are no shadows, or goblins, no dark trees or dim glades, as in the
  Forest, no to and fro of people, as in Bologna. Here is no intrusion, here
  there is no one masked, or disguised."</p>

  <p>He sighed, leaning on the cool stone where a blue and golden lizard lay
  immobile. The wide, fair and shining prospect bounded him at an immense
  distance, the bright freedom of the air, sea and land was his; he felt
  delivered from himself.</p>

  <p>But not from Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>In the city he had not been sure if she had left him or not. Sometimes she
  had seemed to be standing behind him, sometimes he had lost her, and then the
  clays had seemed without lustre.</p>

  <p>He now set his wisdom against his emotions...did he love her, in any
  meaning of that abused and tormented word?</p>

  <p>Why was it that he could not forget her and her silly little fantastical
  adventure?</p>

  <p>He knew many women more beautiful, wittier, wiser; women with more virtue,
  too, who could be constant and keep the rules; women with more dignity who
  would never play the mountebank, but it was always of Letty he thought.
  Letty, to whom a ride along the rocky coast road would soon bring him, any
  day he chose.</p>

  <p>He gazed down at the grey green groves of olive trees, the white sandy
  beaches running into creeks, smooth as pale amber, the broad expanses of
  corn, the swamps in the hollows with cork trees growing on the crags above
  them, the rosy pink plumey flower of the tamarisk, growing almost to the edge
  of the waves, the soft strands of the willows bending over the rivulets that
  ran to the sea, and there, standing on the grey mountain above all this
  luxuriant beauty of the ancient world, that had lasted so long that it seemed
  immortal, Florio still thought of Letty.</p>

  <p>A monk approached him and, quickly sensing his mood, stood in silence,
  turning his hollowed eyes, worn with fasting and staring at the implacable
  words of his breviary, on the magnificent vista that spread before them, like
  the entire landscape of pagan legend, the eternal background for all the
  fables that men have never forgotten.</p>

  <p>Florio rose from his rocky seat and asked the monk if many foreigners made
  this steep ascent.</p>

  <p>The monk, who appeared surprised to be spoken to in his own language,
  replied, yes, indeed, they came for the baths that were excellent, and for
  the perspective that was the finest in Sicily, and sometimes there were
  antiquarians, who endeavoured to discover the former name of this or that
  stream or promontory or the site of some battle fought before the dawn of
  Christianity, such as that stupendous victory won by a Corinthian general
  over the Carthaginians, on the banks of the Belici, as the learned would now
  insist.</p>

  <p>Florio wondered if Philip Calamy, taking, perhaps, seriously, his pose of
  antiquary, had made some such investigations, accompanied by Letty, the two
  of them on donkeys, riding along the rocky defiles, or beside the swamps
  where the wild duck and lapwings flew.</p>

  <p>"Here it is always healthy," said the monk. "But in the swamps there is
  fever, in the autumn; the roads, too, are lonely and infested by robbers, the
  locande dirty, indeed those bleak and lonely downs that you see
  yonder&mdash;let your gaze pass the almond trees, the olives and the
  cornfields&mdash;are of bad repute, and I should not advise you, sir, even
  with the servant I see you have with you, to traverse them."</p>

  <p>"But rather to remain here, in your agreeable establishment?" smiled
  Florio. "Indeed, Father, you speak wisely. But I live&mdash;for a while
  only&mdash;at Cefalu where I have a villa."</p>

  <p>"You come from the North," replied the priest. "Though you speak the
  purest Italian I recognise the accent, a man of the world, I perceive," he
  added with what might have been a wistful note, and he continued that he had
  some satisfaction in gazing down, as he could every day, across a country and
  a sea that had been the scenes of terrible battles, and watch the unsullied
  waves tossing where armed galleys had foundered, and the corn and vine
  growing where once men had been trampled into the defiled earth.</p>

  <p>"I was in Naples at the time of the late massacres," he remarked.
  "Everything of value in the city was destroyed by the rabble, set on by the
  English, whose warships kept watch in the bay. The garrison was murdered
  after surrender, no mercy, no justice, for rebels. I escaped when I could be
  of no more service. One could say the city ran blood."</p>

  <p>"I recall, of course, that barbarous event." The mention of the English
  had brought Philip Calamy sharply to Florio's mind. No doubt that Englishman
  could be savage if need arose. "Bologna, where I lived, escaped lightly."</p>

  <p>"The last war, and the aimless slaughters, in Paris and in Naples," said
  the monk, "are now as remote to me as the ancient battles that took place on
  this wide campaign. Considering this commonplace, I find satisfaction. Those
  I saw slain in Naples now enjoy a peace as profound as those who fell
  centuries ago on these undulating downs."</p>

  <p>The monk said nothing of heaven or the comforts of faith, and Florio
  guessed that he was a sceptic who had taken a monk's role in order to
  withdraw from the world that he had discovered to be too vile and horrible
  for his endurance.</p>

  <p>"I was a scientist," he remarked, perceiving the young man's thought. "My
  laboratory, my books were burnt by the mob in Naples. Standing here, that
  seems of no importance."</p>

  <p>"I can comprehend your mood, Father."</p>

  <p>"But you are young and do not, I think, intend to withdraw from
  society."</p>

  <p>"I have thought of it. I am a very rich man, I lack the energy to employ
  my wealth to any good purpose. In Cefalu, near my villa, are peasants living
  in ugly poverty. They exist on poor harvests and the gum from the manna
  trees. When I am on my estate I give them money. I pay well all whom I
  employ, beyond that I do not think of them. Some-. times it touches my mind
  to give up all this wealth that comes from no effort of mine, and to retire
  to some such spot as this."</p>

  <p>"The infection from Rousseau, Voltaire, the affairs of 'eighty-nine in
  France, these savage wars," said the monk. "But you are not a man of
  action."</p>

  <p>"No. I reflect, I linger, I travel. Sometimes it seems to me that I am
  always trying to find home and that there is...no way home."</p>

  <p>"Of what are you thinking now</p>

  <p>"Of this perfection of beauty; the sea resembles a field of wild hyacinth,
  the hills close packed, the sands shine silver, like snow and rose leaves are
  the manna trees and the tamarisk, the rocks of jasper and porphyry, glint
  like gems; the air is full of sparkles of gold. I see not only the true
  delights of the scene, but these remind me of everything precious and rare
  that I have ever known, everything lovely and desirable."</p>

  <p>The monk considered his comely face, now unlined by any illness or
  anxiety, his eyes of a gemlike brightness, the hue and sparkle of the topaz,
  the calm brow beneath the auburn locks. Some such youth had he of the old
  Neapolitan nobility been, and many such had he seen slaughtered in the
  prisons and streets of Naples when the King returned from his flight to
  Palermo.</p>

  <p>"What will you do with your life, sir," he asked, "in these chaotic times
  when peace is only to be had on the mountain tops of a forgotten island?"</p>

  <p>"An amateur in everything, I do not know how to answer you," smiled
  Florio. "My present interest, nay, my interest for nearly two years now, has
  been two lovers. They have the rare merit of fidelity in adversity."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is uncommon."</p>

  <p>"They lost everything for the sake of one another, more than we, in this
  country, can compute, their entire world is closed to them."</p>

  <p>"And they are content?"</p>

  <p>"When last that I saw them they were, certainly. They are now in a retreat
  and I hear little of them."</p>

  <p>The monk, who had retained all his worldly good breeding, put no more
  questions, but Florio continued his story that, as he spoke, seemed to flow
  into the golden air.</p>

  <p>"A husband pursued them, not the <i>pantaleone</i> of comedy but a man of
  dignity, profoundly hurt; it was as if one could see the wound in his heart.
  He followed them to the continent with the purpose of killing at least the
  man. I saved them."</p>

  <p>"For the sake of all of them?" asked the monk.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I can truly declare as much."</p>

  <p>"And you still think of them? And you have climbed to this solitary
  hermitage to consider them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they do not disturb me."</p>

  <p>"Humanly speaking, he should have tired of her by this time&mdash;a
  year."</p>

  <p>"And two years before that. But what fascinates me is their faithful love.
  I, moreover, as they both know, am something enamoured of her. Yes, even now,
  though she is foolish, no great beauty, save for her red tresses, elegant and
  gay at Bologna, but nothing compared to some ladies of my acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"So all your philosophy," remarked the monk, "comes to this, that you
  undertake a tedious ascent, in order to dream in peace over a pretty
  woman."</p>

  <p>Florio good humouredly tried to explain that his interest was in the
  situation of these two foreigners, to him so poignant and so moving. He spoke
  of their adventures in Germany, of the woman's meek fidelity, of her utter
  dependence on the man, and he related how he had made this man promise his
  constant protection to his lover who, without that, would, abandoned by all,
  "die stupidly," said Florio abruptly.</p>

  <p>He had always thought of Letty's possible fate in those words; her end
  would not be heroic, but stupid, fever, the shelter of a convent or a
  hospital, a grave unnamed.</p>

  <p>"He has been true to that promise and to me," he added, shielding his eyes
  from the level sunbeams. He had thrown off his straw hat, for he stood in the
  shadow of a rock.</p>

  <p>"You have, then, heard from him?" The monk affected a courteous interest
  in this affair, for he was attracted to the delightful aspect of Florio San
  Quirico, to his smiling manner and fascinating voice.</p>

  <p>"No, nor from her, for several months, but I am sure that if she had come
  upon misfortune she would have sent to me."</p>

  <p>The monk glanced at him tenderly, perceiving how absorbed he was, despite
  his philosophic air, in the fables he had invented about the strangers who
  had touched his life and passed on.</p>

  <p>The wide and golden vista that had brought peace to the monk in the sense
  of a painless and not displeasing apathy, now flushed to a deeper, more ruddy
  tint, that overspread even the white flowers of the manna trees with a rosier
  glow, as the earth turned from the sun.</p>

  <p>"So," said the monk, "you have nothing to fear as you have had nothing to
  gain from this adventure of the mind and spirit."</p>

  <p>"And something of the body, too, father, for I have travelled a good
  distance over those outlandish Gothic countries, and now here, in this
  fantastic land."</p>

  <p>"The meaning is that you are not yet content."</p>

  <p>"Content! I never think of the word."</p>

  <p>A bell chimed from the small belfry above the convent buildings beyond the
  houses, now vacant, for the accommodation of visitors.</p>

  <p>The sound was sharp and unearthly on this mountain solitude even to
  Florio, who all his life had listened unconsciously to the sound of bells in
  the background of his princely existence.</p>

  <p>The monk moved away, a dark figure against the grey rock, to the formal
  futilities with which he passed the small time left to him on the earth he
  had found so cruel and so radiant.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico had to come to a decision here as he had had to come to
  a decision in the Forest. Should he pass his early <i>villeggiatura</i> in
  Cefalu and return in the great heat to the mountains and the sea, and so, to
  another winter in Bologna. Or should he visit Chiaramonte and himself inquire
  after the well being of his guests?</p>

  <p>He noted that philosophy, in the person of the patrician Neapolitan monk,
  had departed, that common sense, in the person of his body servant, Bonino,
  remained behind, comfortably in the shade of a sharply-jutting rock,
  conversing with the cicerone, and that he was left to himself.</p>

  <p>There was no one to help him.</p>

  <p>And, he asked himself, in what did he need help? Surely Letty was but a
  phantom of his fancy, a mere fragment of a dream?</p>

  <p>But he could not persuade himself of this. She was part of this wide
  perspective that embraced heaven and earth, the fields of lavish corn, of
  olive and almond trees, the bleached sands, the glitter of purple horizons
  where the line of sea and sky shimmered into one light that was more than
  light as mortal mind could conceive it&mdash;and yet she was only poor Letty,
  the fugitive Englishwoman who had broken all the rules of her caste, as he,
  Florio San Quirico, would never break the rules of his caste.</p>

  <p>Chivalry he had been taught to smile at; good manners had taken the place
  of this impossible ideal, and he did not know how to classify his affection
  for Letty, that had been so constant and that asked no return.</p>

  <p>And he checked himself on the word "affection" that had formed in his
  thoughts. He did not know if that was the exact expression of his feeling for
  Letty.</p>

  <p>What problem had the wide vista, so ennobling to behold, resolved for
  him?</p>

  <p>He did not know and he laughed at his own ignorance; how useless to climb
  a height in order to consider a commonplace dilemma! All this was but
  indulging a whim, a fantasy.</p>

  <p>Yet he could contradict himself there, and with some show of reason. Letty
  and her lover were real people, not shadows in a fable, and their action in
  finding and acclaiming one another, in going away together, was, to Florio,
  more positive and energetic than any action he had known. There was not one
  of his friends or acquaintances who would be capable of such a decision.
  Letty Winslow and Philip Calamy had proved to him that romantic love not only
  could exist but that it was strong and positive.</p>

  <p>"It is true," his quick wit reminded him, "that they are living in hiding,
  under false names and with my powerful protection, yet the fact that they can
  be happy in that exile and isolation is a proof of the reality of their
  love."</p>

  <p>Fanning himself with his straw hat, for the breeze was stilled, he closed
  his eyes from the dazzle of the landscape, where every wavelet on the distant
  sea, every frond of the palm leaves, was edged with burning gold.</p>

  <p>He did not, on the most rigid inspection of his wide acquaintance he had
  to admit this, know of any woman who would have surrendered for him what
  Letty had surrendered for Philip Calamy, and this set her high in his
  regard.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not visit this paragon, and marvel at her felicity?"</p>

  <p>Following these questions came a feeling that the noble happiness of this
  ideal pair was, in some sort, his possession, a jewel that he had a right to
  gaze at now and then, if merely to assure himself that such a treasure
  existed.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Bonino and the guide, who were seated drowsily in the shade
  of the grey rock, heavy with the enchantment of the sun on the mountain, and
  the girdling campaign below. He wished he had their tranquillity; both were
  satisfied with their service and their reward. He called his servant, who
  came at once, and sent him with a piece of gold to offer in the chapel of the
  Saracenic bath establishment.</p>

  <p>Then he began the descent from the mountain to the radiant plains.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>§ 23</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio rode along the narrow path cut into the red breccia, then along the
  valley of the ficerme de Mirti, overhung with wild myrtles and shadowed by
  steep heights of golden rock, until he saw, at midday, having left Palermo
  with the dawn, the poor village of Misilmeri, the flat-tiled roofs of the
  straggling houses showing bright in the glare of the sun that fell straightly
  on the lofty, bare cliffs behind the village.</p>

  <p>In the valley, flowers that would be amber-coloured and rosy grapes were
  showing on the baked earth, among the scrolling brown leaves; the
  black-veiled women were moving listlessly, with pitchers on their heads,
  treading with bare feet the paths from distant springs, but in the village
  all was silent and seemed deserted.</p>

  <p>Florio had not remembered the place was so poor. He recalled his own
  wealth and that this was the century of the "rights of man," but was moved to
  no more than an abstract pity for the wretchedness of these inferior beings.
  They were part of life, like the mosquitoes and the mules, torments or
  conveniences as the case might be, and he raised his eyes, slightly inflamed
  by the dust, to the castle of golden stone, set in a dominant position on the
  steep, bold cliff, with the wild treeless slopes.</p>

  <p>"It is becoming too hot in Sicily, especially for Northerners," thought
  Florio, and he turned over in his mind what suggestion he should make to
  Philip Calamy for spending the summer in the mountains of Italy, either in a
  hunting box in the Apennines, or a casino on the Ligurian coast.</p>

  <p>He took the bridle path that led to the square white, red-tiled house of
  Mario Roccaforte, but the place was empty, the rooms green shuttered against
  the heat.</p>

  <p>"Stay here for me, Bonino, Mario is abroad in the valley, or even up at
  the castle."</p>

  <p>He took the bridle path that wound along the yellow rock to the square
  yellow building, that appeared as formidable as a fort against the sparkling
  purple of the sky. In his memory the place had not appeared to him so bleak
  and lonely, but he knew that within it was cool, rich and spacious, and that
  there was an inner courtyard with a fountain whose spray kept fresh
  camellias, orange and lemon trees in majolica pots.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Letty would be sitting there now, in the shadow of the arcade,
  attended by some black-haired girl from the village in her gay <i>festa</i>
  costume, and between them would be a length of white muslin or linen that
  they were chequering with a Greek design in red.</p>

  <p>Soon he was himself in shadow, that of the castle that fell blue on the
  golden rock.</p>

  <p>The scene had a poetical, even a legendary aspect to Florio; he felt
  himself in some time more grand and splendid than his own, the squalid
  village below was far away to him, not only hidden by the bold jutting of the
  cliff, but by his own absorption in the castle and the lovers it enclosed,
  like a fortress holding a treasure.</p>

  <p>The path widened into a stately approach to a gate in a wall that went zig
  zag along the cliff that it bended into to the sight, being built of the same
  substance. This gate stood open and led directly to the outer court of the
  castle that stood on a tableland of rock.</p>

  <p>Now that he was near to the square yellow building it took on form and
  shapeliness in all the details; the small neat ashlar of the Saracen and the
  Norman, the towers at the angles, the square headed windows, some of which
  had been adorned with flamboyant tracery.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico entered the first courtyard in which there was a
  chapel, and waited for some groom to take his horse, none appearing he rode
  into the second courtyard that contained the offices of the establishment,
  and, no one being there, into the third that was the residence of the family
  and in which was the flashing fountain of which he had thought when ascending
  the path between the bare mountain crags.</p>

  <p>This too was empty and Florio dismounted, holding by the bridle his white
  horse whose flanks were stained dark with sweat.</p>

  <p>He experienced that sensation of forlorn loneliness that had assailed him
  when he had entered the empty rooms in Wilhelmsruhe and walked through the
  park named Solitude.</p>

  <p>Here all was bright, radiant, brilliant, of the orient, there all had been
  dim, dark, gloomy, haunted, but the sense of desolation was a similar pain,
  then as now, and the weather-stained blue summer house, with the grave-like
  mound, blotted the clear scene of the inner court, and the sound of the rain
  at Nuremberg blended with the falling water of the fountain in the basin of
  pale yellow alabaster.</p>

  <p>Green <i>persane</i> closed the round arched windows, that looked on the
  courtyard, from the sun.</p>

  <p>Florio stood hesitant, when a woman, startled by the sound of a horseman,
  appeared in one of the doorways that gave on to the enclosed space of
  sparkling water, marble paving stones and flowers gleaming white and red amid
  smooth glossy foliage.</p>

  <p>She had her arms full of newly-washed linen, and a child came running
  behind her staring with curious black eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your mistress, the English lady?" asked Florio. "You did not expect me, I
  know."</p>

  <p>The sharp intelligence of the Sicilian peasant perceived that this was the
  foreign master of the estate who was, though never seen, so liberal and easy.
  She answered with respect and the dignity never lacking in her country.</p>

  <p>The English lord and lady had left Chiaramonte long ago&mdash;they had,
  indeed, stayed only a few weeks. Doubtless, letters to his Highness had been
  lost, on the long journey, from floods, brigands. The steward, Mario
  Roccaforte, had certainly written.</p>

  <p>"It is a long time since I heard," said Florio, with difficulty
  understanding the Sicilian, yet knowing the sense of it at once, without
  mistake.</p>

  <p>They had gone. Been gone for some time. Letters? It was likely enough that
  Philip Calamy had written from some other part of Sicily, pretending to be at
  Chiaramonte; useless to ask the woman more, she could not speak Italian but
  she quickly called a groom, who ran up and took the sweating white horse to
  the stables in the second courtyard, and she motioned Florio into the room,
  where she stood and shouted up a corkscrew staircase. The steward appeared at
  once, tall, lean, a red silk tied round his shaven head; he, too, at once
  understood the moment and the problem.</p>

  <p>Though greatly surprised at seeing his master, who had not been to
  Chiaramonte since he was a boy, the steward was gravely composed. His
  accounts were in order, he knew, and the property excellently maintained. But
  he soon realized that Florio San Quirico was not interested in these matters,
  but in his English guests.</p>

  <p>"I am utterly surprised, Mario, that they should be gone."</p>

  <p>The steward, shrewd, obliging, could but repeat that he had written of
  this departure&mdash;ah, but some time after the lord and lady had left; he
  supposed these noble friends of his master would themselves inform him of
  their movements.</p>

  <p>Florio knew this was reasonable. He had purposely abstained from giving
  Mario any hint that he required news of his guests. Philip Calamy must have
  discovered this delicacy and taken advantage of it. "Why did I ever trust him
  after all his tricks?"</p>

  <p>The woman returned with a glass of iced sherbet and some sweet biscuits
  that she offered as gracefully as if she was a handmaiden of Ceres, the
  goddess of the island.</p>

  <p>Mario, standing easily, explained his care of the castle. He was staying
  up there for a few days, as he did now and then, to set everything in
  order.</p>

  <p>"And no one ever comes, or only comes to leave," said Florio. He felt sick
  and weary, his gaze fell to the slats of vivid light on the mosaic floor that
  fell between the bars of the sun blinds. There were paintings of nymphs with
  butterfly wings on the walls, and set against them cabinets of Sicilian agate
  and amber, with between terra cotta busts of satyrs on porphyry plinths.</p>

  <p>"I shall stay," he added. "I hardly expected to find my friends, yet I
  supposed that they might have remained here for the winter."</p>

  <p>This, it seemed, was not so. Mario did not require to be questioned, he
  observed that every detail about the English visitors would be acceptable to
  his master, and readily gave these.</p>

  <p>They had arrived, after rough travelling and without servants, early in
  the New Year. Mario had supplied them with every luxury in his power, obeying
  the letter that had arrived from Nuremberg shortly before they came, and that
  other which they brought with them from Florio.</p>

  <p>The lord had been able to make himself understood in Italian; the lady
  knew little, and it was difficult with the women servants, peasants from the
  estate. The lord had shown an ardent interest in everything, made himself
  agreeable, and been very gracious; his wife was shy and seemed fragile, she
  spent most of her time in her room, sitting over the charcoal brazier.</p>

  <p>Once she had dressed herself in some of the ancient garments kept in the
  chestnut wood chest.</p>

  <p>For the rest, Mario could not remember that she had ever done or said
  anything to be noted.</p>

  <p>Then they had left, while the winds still blew bleak from Etna, refusing
  service, merely borrowing mules and a guide who brought the animals back to
  Chiaramonte.</p>

  <p>Since the steward had not expected them to stay long, this had not been
  surprising, and not until his next quarterly account that had probably passed
  Florio on the road from Rome to Naples, had he mentioned how brief the visit
  had been.</p>

  <p>Now he was extremely discreet, if the little episode had seemed to him
  anything out of the common, he gave no hint of this.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico knew himself outwitted. He was sure that the Englishman
  had coldly and carefully deceived him. Philip Calamy had never intended to
  stay in the Sicilian castle, his going there had merely been to cover other
  designs. Florio reminded himself that he should have expected this after the
  Englishman's ingenious tricks and masquerades. It had been foolish to
  consider him as desperate and eager to accept any shelter offered. He was far
  too cunning easily to be in distress for an expediency. His aim had been
  Palermo, a city with many resources; Florio remembered that he had questioned
  as to the facilities of the capital. There he had gone, with Letty, and
  there, most likely, he was lost, not only to Colonel Winslow but to Florio
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I was made use of," reflected the young man. "At one time I was amused to
  imagine that the fate of these two people lay in my hands. But no, I was,
  instead, merely a tool for this rascal's designs."</p>

  <p>This was the first time that he had given an ill name to Philip Calamy,
  now it came instinctively and was retained deliberately. Yes, the Englishman
  was a rascal, a scoundrel, the promise he had made to protect Letty was
  worthless. Florio was even doubtful as to the love between these two that had
  seemed to redeem them both from follies and lies. Once, no doubt, their
  passion had united them, but Florio thought that it must, naturally, have
  burned away, at least on the man's part, though she seemed by nature
  constant, tender and obedient.</p>

  <p>Florio wished that she had appealed to him in the crisis of her fortunes
  that had evidently overtaken her&mdash;but perhaps she had gone as the
  willing companion of Philip Calamy. But on what excuse and why? And what
  could her life be in Palermo, without money, in disguise and in hiding?</p>

  <p>Florio recalled the mumming she had already undertaken at her lover's
  bidding&mdash;a French princess in a transparent mask, a toy dealer's
  wife&mdash;subterfuges engineered with a kind of malicious relish by Philip
  Calamy, but with a kind of passive terror (or so it seemed to Florio) by
  Letty.</p>

  <p>"The lady took some of the dresses with her," said the steward with
  distant respect, he added that he felt answerable to His Highness for this,
  but that the English lord had assured him that the Prince had desired him to
  take the garments.</p>

  <p>"For all that," added Mario, "I should have prevented him, since he showed
  no authority, but I could not, without using force."</p>

  <p>"You were well advised, Mario."</p>

  <p>Florio knew that the steward did not trust Philip Calamy though he had
  given such a good report of his behaviour.</p>

  <p>"What dresses did my guests take?" he asked, now careful to avoid the word
  "friends."</p>

  <p>The steward described them, clothes that had belonged to Donna Bianco and
  Donna Luisa, Florio's mother and grandmother. They were garments of an orient
  richness, and with them had been taken combs, brooches, chains and belts, not
  of precious metals and jewels, but of some value.</p>

  <p>"So, a thief," thought Florio. "Yet of what use to him this plunder? Letty
  cannot wear fashions of a century, of fifty years ago, and the clothes would
  be worth little in money."</p>

  <p>Aloud he commended Mario and dismissed him. Even behind the <i>persane</i>
  the heat was like a spell, impeding movement, almost thought. The
  magnificent, formal decorations of the room afforded little repose to a weary
  spirit. Florio did not like Chiaramonte nor yet Sicily. Neither did he
  consider with pleasure the long journey home to Bologna nor the life that
  would await him when he arrived at his destination.</p>

  <p>The flick of the word "home" into his tired mind brought a new turn into
  his vague speculations as to the fate of Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>Perhaps a friend&mdash;they had spoken of a friend who had kept in touch
  with them by letter&mdash;had written to inform them of the death of Colonel
  Winslow, and they had married and returned to England. Florio recalled that
  Letty had herself rejected this hope with vehemence. She had declared that in
  the society of her country, where divorce was possible, it was utterly
  shameful, and the legal means provided for redress from a hateful marriage
  were regarded with abhorrence and that never would or could her lover make
  her his wife.</p>

  <p>But this seemed to Florio, not knowing England, as grotesque. He still
  supposed that they might marry and return to their kinsfolk and friends, nor
  could he persuade himself that Philip Calamy was debarred from serving his
  country in the field because he had eloped with another man's wife.</p>

  <p>His heart felt lighter as he considered the errant couple as married and
  the man restored from his vagabond existence to a place of honour. Perhaps by
  now he was fighting on the continent where English troops were again engaged
  in war.</p>

  <p>He put the case to Bonino that evening when the servant was with him in
  the large bedchamber that looked on to the barren slopes of the mountain that
  had a metallic outline against the livid pink sky. Curtains of fine muslin
  protected the windows against the mosquitoes and the <i>mal aria</i> of the
  evening. For the same purpose Bonino kept a brazier of incense burning, the
  blue smoke from this blurred the sharp outline of the heavy furniture and the
  outer glare of light that, even through the nets, ached on the sight.</p>

  <p>The servant disagreed with his master and even accused him of becoming
  infected by a Northern romanticism.</p>

  <p>For his part, he considered that the English pair were in some new
  masquerade, and probably in Palermo.</p>

  <p>"Why should <i>he</i>&mdash;I do not say <i>they,</i> Bonino, for I think
  that there is but one will between them, and that is <i>his</i>
  will&mdash;have left the shelter, security and dignity of Chiaramonte for any
  mountebank adventures?"</p>

  <p>"I think that the Englishman&mdash;and you are right, sir, he alone
  counts&mdash;would find the life here insufferably tedious. Moreover he would
  feel spiteful towards you because he is under an obligation to you, and would
  delight in throwing your favours back at you by leaving your home in this
  ungrateful manner."</p>

  <p>"He had no, or little, money."</p>

  <p>"He had his wits," replied Bonino. "He is cunning and clever and enjoys
  tricks, also, being an outcast, it soothes him to fool and prey on the
  society that has rejected him."</p>

  <p>"Why, you speak as if you knew what he was doing, Bonino."</p>

  <p>The servant answered that he could indeed guess the occupation of the
  Englishman, and he begged his master to consider the man, the circumstances,
  the place, for surely this adventurer had got no farther than Palermo. "It
  would be difficult for him to leave the island&mdash;here, your safe conduct
  protects him, beyond he would have to produce passports and he cannot
  continue to forge these. Besides there is war again, making all travel
  exceedingly hazardous."</p>

  <p>Florio reflected on what Bonino had said, and on Philip Calamy, and
  Palermo, as he knew it by reputation, not having visited it since the days of
  his early youth.</p>

  <p>"Then, Bonino, following your suggestion, I should say that the man has
  become a professional gambler."</p>

  <p>"Precisely, sir. He is a born gambler, as is manifest in his actions. It
  is a great, mastering vice with the English&mdash;once they turn to it, they
  become addicts."</p>

  <p>"It might be," agreed Florio. "He has the skill and address to gamble for
  a livelihood, and to such employments come men of his stamp. Palermo, rich,
  idle and corrupt, would offer him some scope, but not for long. Utterly
  <i>déclassé,</i> he would soon be an object of suspicion, and have to move,
  as such gentry do, and where to?&mdash;as you wisely remarked, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"Yes, in time he would have to fly, possibly from the police. Not yet, I
  think. His talents are considerable and he would find not only profit but
  diversion in the role of card sharper."</p>

  <p>"He is a gentleman," protested Florio, caught at that last word. "And
  though lost to all honour, I doubt if he would know the devices whereby to
  fleece the honest and credulous that card-sharpers are so adroit with."</p>

  <p>"If he did not know them, sir," replied Bonino, "he would not be able to
  make a living out of card playing. Had he decided, in desperation, to take to
  cards, and played fair, he would at once have been ruined."</p>

  <p>"He may have been so ruined."</p>

  <p>"I do not think so, sir. All his life, I am convinced, he has betted,
  gambled, laid wagers, ay, and for high stakes, also, as he did in the French
  disguise, in the Nuremberg disguise, and that under which he came here; each
  time, sir, he played total hazard, for his life, and won."</p>

  <p>"That is true, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"It is his manner and his nature, sir," proceeded the servant, encouraged
  by his master's quiet approval. "Moreover, he likes to cheat."</p>

  <p>"He played straightly in Bologna and was not often at the tables."</p>

  <p>"Because such behaviour suited the part he was acting, that of an
  honourable soldier, wounded and in repose.</p>

  <p>"You have studied him closely, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"Alas! Yes, sir, for you have attached so much importance to him. But I
  speak in deference. What, sir, is your opinion of this Englishman?"</p>

  <p>"I share yours, Bonino. As far as I can judge one who has deceived me, you
  have understood him correctly. I think it likely that he has sunk to some
  gambling <i>salon</i> in Palermo. But, in that case, Bonino, what of the poor
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"We can suppose," answered the servant cautiously, "that he has kept her
  apart in some casino in the suburbs, and that she knows nothing of his
  occupation. She is meek and incurious and wholly trustful."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we may suppose that," replied Florio, "for I have no reason to think
  him quite detestable." He was silent a moment, then added: "There is a flaw
  in our reading of this fellow's character. An artful rogue, a cool gambler,
  an adroit cheat, we decide, yet, Bonino, on an impulse of sincere
  emotion&mdash;love for a woman&mdash;he threw away everything that he must
  have valued. And he has been faithful to her. No, a worthless man would not
  have eloped with Letty Winslow, she is no enchantress and has no coquetries,
  a worthless man would not have been constant to her."</p>

  <p>"That action," agreed Bonino, still speaking with respectful reserve, "is
  indeed difficult to read. The seduction of the lady would have been in his
  character, as I see it, but the elopement is not. As for his constancy,
  certainly he could have abandoned her, but she may be useful to him."</p>

  <p>"What! Do you not allow him passion? Love? I do and must&mdash;that is the
  sole interest these people have for me, their common love."</p>

  <p>"Alas," thought the servant, turning from his master, "I would that this
  were so, but you are entangled far more deeply than that in the fortunes of
  this accursed couple. A mere respect for their love and what they have
  sacrificed for it? Indeed no, you are absorbed in them, and enamoured of the
  woman, for all I can see to the contrary."</p>

  <p>Florio noticed the man's silence and his averted face. "I do not defend
  myself," he smiled. "You know that I shall go to Palermo and search for
  them."</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," replied Bonino. "I shall, of course, do what I can to help
  you. I have long ceased the impertinence of imploring you to give up this
  quest."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>§ 24</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio San Quirico paused in the bedchamber that Letty had occupied in the
  castle of Chiaramonte, as he had paused in that she had occupied in the
  hunting lodge at Wilhelmsruhe.</p>

  <p>Here she had left no trace of her presence, no shawls of yellow and white
  silk flung over chairs, no flowers on the window sill.</p>

  <p>The hard South did not offer posies, here were no romantic shadows, here
  no darkling forest, but the vivid sun, and the hot air and a dry dust on
  walls faced with yellow marble, on tables of alabaster, on stiff furniture
  covered in bright Genoese velvets.</p>

  <p>Beyond the windows were the bare yellow mountains, the pink skies, the
  angular shapes of the prickly cactus, termed by Sicilians Indian figs, and
  the wounding brilliancy of the air that was composed of millions of burning
  motes.</p>

  <p>He wondered that she had not chosen a room that looked on the inner
  courtyard where the fountain plashed over the glossy leaves of the white and
  crimson camellias in the cork-filled vases of white earthenware. Mario had
  said that she had chosen this outside room herself, refusing those formerly
  the chambers of the ladies of Chiaramonte.</p>

  <p>A whim or delicacy?</p>

  <p>In either case Florio found something touching about the action, as if it
  had been a gesture of thanks or gratitude towards him. Better than a letter,
  he thought, for gratitude can only be expressed indirectly. Then he recalled
  the garments so coolly taken. No nicety there. If she turned aside from using
  the rooms hitherto belonging to his women folk, she had not scrupled to avail
  herself of their hoarded finery.</p>

  <p>But he saw Philip Calamy's hand in that, she would be passive. No, Florio
  thought that she would have protested. Why did the Englishman want the
  clothes?</p>

  <p>Florio thought of yet another masquerade and this was most unpleasant to
  him. He did not wish to see Letty in another disguise. Yet he could not have
  told himself why he wished to see her at all. She was already veiled from him
  by the passage of time. She had followed her lover, leaving no message, no
  token for the man who had helped her at such uncommon pains. She had given no
  recognition of the luck that had sent so powerful a person as Florio San
  Quirico across her path, the luck that she had aroused his intense interest.
  She had slipped away from the refuge he had offered her as she must have
  slipped away from her home and husband, from her family and her country.</p>

  <p>There was not the slightest warrant or excuse for Florio to meddle further
  in the poor fortunes of Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>He knew that, and knew that he must try to find her, continue to puzzle
  over her story and her character, challenge Philip Calamy as to his right to
  control her destiny&mdash;yes, challenge him, but indirectly, matching craft
  to craft.</p>

  <p>He was aware now with whom he dealt, a scoundrel, though he still gave him
  the honour of a powerful poetical love and passion such as he, Florio, could
  never hope to experience. But for the rest, Bonino had seen him clearly. It
  was likely enough that he would be found in the gambling rooms of
  Palermo.</p>

  <p>To indulge his own zest for excitement and license, he had taken Letty
  from the safe retreat, where she was respected and where she could live
  softly, to the hazards of his own disreputable fortunes in a dissolute city.
  Florio hoped that he had, as Bonino so cautiously had suggested, kept her
  safe in some little house in the suburbs of Palermo, where he would return,
  kind and loving, never telling her of his means of livelihood. Such conduct
  alone could, in Florio's opinion, condone his brutal departure, without a
  word to his benefactor, from Chiaramonte.</p>

  <p>Believing in his love for Letty, knowing what he had lost for Letty,
  Florio could trust that she was, in so much, safe with Philip Calamy, yet
  beneath that trust was an unresolved and tenacious doubt as to any good being
  in the nature of the wayward Englishman.</p>

  <p>Letty had made no impression on the Sicilian servants, alert, intelligent
  and interested in the unexpected foreigner. Florio himself indirectly, and
  Bonino more directly, had tried to learn something of the ways, manners and
  disposition of the Englishwoman during her sojourn in the yellow castle.</p>

  <p>She appeared never to have done or said anything that was not entirely
  commonplace. It was as if no one had noticed her at all. But everyone had
  noticed Philip Calamy, his good looks, good humour, his skill in everything
  to which he turned his mind or his hand, his readiness in learning
  Sicilian.</p>

  <p>"I did not," thought Florio, "see much of that good humour&mdash;humour it
  must be, not nature, and affected for a purpose. The man has qualities, it is
  evident." And again Florio turned to the possibility that the lovers were now
  married and had returned to England. He wished that he could receive that
  unlikely news, for he knew that if he did he would be able to dismiss this
  haunting phantom of the futitive Englishwoman from his life.</p>

  <p>This thought increased the energy with which he resolved to discover
  Philip Calamy and his companion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>§ 25</h2>

  <p class="first">The Sicilian nobility had left Palermo for the summer months, but the
  sumptuous city had lost nothing of its rich, oriental and extravagant air.
  Though so many of the palaces were shuttered against the unbroken blaze of
  the sun and inhabited only by servants, there remained a large population of
  those who would not forego urban delights even in the blaze of summer, and
  people who had been driven from country to country during the long European
  wars, who now had no longer any thought of home, and who picked up their
  livings as best they might and with no great nicety.</p>

  <p>Added to these were the jostling crowds of adventurers who find a field of
  action in every large city. Many of them were refugees from Naples and the
  interior of Italy, some were deserters from the one time conquering army of
  the French and the one time conquering navy of the British, who had found the
  luxurious life of Sicily more to their tastes than the hazards of war.</p>

  <p>They preyed upon one another and upon such students, country gentlemen and
  travellers who wished to investigate the byeways of Palermo regardless of
  heat, disease and filth.</p>

  <p>Added to these were the monks and nuns from the numerous convents, who led
  an existence apart, yet contributed to the atmosphere of the city with their
  chants, processions and bell ringing.</p>

  <p>Florio San Quirico did not trouble to disguise himself in a city where
  there was no one his equal or likely to trouble about him if he lived
  quietly.</p>

  <p>The untempered heat, reflected in thousands of rays and facets from the
  gilt and mosaic domes and towers of Palermo, foretold, the physicians said,
  the plague, and excited and clamorous presses of the ignorant and the fearful
  were already filling the dark interiors of the gorgeous churches.</p>

  <p>There was a deadly stagnation in the burning air, foul odours arising from
  the beautiful profuse gardens, and clouds of venomous insects whirling in the
  searing sunlight to give some colour to their miserable dreads. From the poor
  quarters the death bell tolled incessantly, and the death carts rolled
  incessantly, carrying away the bodies of the beggars, thieves and those
  depraved by wretchedness who herded in the slums of Palermo.</p>

  <p>Florio felt himself infected by something of the restless depression
  caused by the proximity of so many nervous dreads, such frequent recitals of
  unavenged crimes and untended diseases.</p>

  <p>If he was aware of the stately splendour of the city, so superbly set on
  the bay of purple ocean, and overhung by a stainless sky, rosy with sun by
  day and dark azure by night, shot by the pallid rays of a monstrous moon, so
  he was also aware of the putrid smells from the narrow streets, the drooping
  forms of the passers by, the languid wasted faces of those who sat listless
  on balconies, behind ornate railings.</p>

  <p>He thought, with an unreasonable apprehension, for the plague had not yet
  come to Palermo nor, indeed, to Sicily, that Letty, blotched with corruption,
  was already lying dead in some pest house, and a cold rage, such as he had
  never felt before, rose within him towards Philip Calamy, who had taken her
  from the security of Chiaramonte, with the cool rooms, the plashing fountain,
  the bright flowers, and the willing servants, into the dismal perils of the
  corrupt city.</p>

  <p>The larger houses of accommodation for travellers being closed, Florio and
  his man had found rooms in an <i>osteria</i> of the better sort that was kept
  by a Frenchman, not far from Monte Reale. This man was something of a
  philosopher and told his guests that he did not expect the pestilence since
  the summer was already far advanced without the least sign of it. "But," said
  he, "every year, when the gentry forsake the city and the rag tag remain, the
  monks get the upper hand and one sees the Capuchins and the Carmelites, the
  Franciscans and others, out in processions frightening the people with their
  <i>misereres</i> and their ghostly looks."</p>

  <p>"But many die," said Florio. "There is some sickness abroad."</p>

  <p>"As always in the heat, sir, and when the baser sort press together in
  their fairs, markets and plays, and there are many wandering vagabonds about,
  such as discharged soldiers, jugglers, quacks and mountebanks."</p>

  <p>Florio set Bonino to ask this fellow about the gambling <i>salons</i> of
  the city and received the report that there were many, and not all known to
  honest men.</p>

  <p>Concealing his secret behind a show of candour, as was his wont, Florio
  said that he was searching for a weak young relative who had escaped
  guardianship and was believed to be in hiding in Palermo, wasting his estate
  in vile company, and he asked if there were any resorts where such people
  might be pleasantly entrapped by rogues.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman said that the assistance of the magistrates and the police
  had better be sought, but Florio could not accept this advice, as he did not
  really wish to rescue a victim from a gambling <i>salon,</i> but to find a
  man running one.</p>

  <p>The best known of these places Bonino had soon visited and by means of
  money and wit discovered that they had never had anything to do with an
  Englishman answering to the description of Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>He then, on his master's instructions, began a search through the lesser
  dens or hells, as they were truly termed, of the city, where card play for
  high stakes was combined with traffic in all the profitable vices.</p>

  <p>Some of these places he visited warily, afterwards burning fumigants over
  his clothes and always keeping vinegar handkerchiefs and pastilles powerfully
  recommended by Bolognese physicians, crushed against his nostrils. Such
  tawdry resorts were often found in decayed mansions, crudely patched against
  the searching sun, or in ancient playhouses, long neglected, where the stage
  served for the tables, the tattered scenery to drape the flies and wings, and
  the auditorium as a dormitory, where on straw, cloaks and saddle bags, the
  outcast and the criminal slept and cooked their meals on braziers before the
  doors were opened to the evening's play.</p>

  <p>In none of these places did Bonino find Philip Calamy though he came
  across several Englishmen.</p>

  <p>To one of these he confided something of his quest, giving the outline of
  the story and no names.</p>

  <p>The Englishman grinned.</p>

  <p>"Why trouble yourself?" he asked. "This man goes his own way and will not
  thank you for following him."</p>

  <p>Bonino thought so, too, and said so, but added that he served another, a
  powerful Prince of mid-Italy, who was to set these two on the way to a life
  of honour in their own country.</p>

  <p>The Englishman swore at such simplicity.</p>

  <p>"Why, my master is far from simple," protested Bonino.</p>

  <p>"Then he is infatuated," retorted the other, "not to realize that there is
  no way home for such as these."</p>

  <p>"So the sad lady used to say herself," agreed Bonino. "But you speak
  justly when you speak of my master as infatuated. So he is, though he does
  not know it, but thinks of himself as only animated by kindness and a
  philosophical curiosity."</p>

  <p>When he returned to Florio he related this incident. "The fellow was a
  gentleman, though much fallen, and knew his own country. 'No way home,' he
  declared, for such as they."</p>

  <p>But Florio only replied: "I must find them."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>§ 26</h2>

  <p class="first">When they had been in Palermo for a week without any respite from the
  yellow glare nor any success in their search, Florio met an acquaintance of
  his in the street, who recognized him with surprise.</p>

  <p>Florio explained that he was in <i>villeggiatura</i> at Chiaramonte and
  had come into the city to make some purchases for the farm. He did not expect
  this to be credited by the young Sicilian, but he knew that he would not be
  questioned. He had often entertained the elegant nobleman at the Villa Aria
  and he was now entreated to visit a summer retreat near the royal palace at
  the Conca d'oro, where Biago Giandola was in residence with members of his
  family. Florio, sickened by the heat, the sights and fumes of the city and
  Bonino's reports of squalid haunts of vice and crime, accepted and, sending
  to the <i>osteria</i> for his servant, drove away at once in the young duke's
  carriage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>§ 27</h2>

  <p class="first">The villa to which Florio was taken was situate in a curve of the yellow
  cliffs that abutted on to a deep blue ocean, clear of the stains of the
  harbour and the city.</p>

  <p>The villa house was toylike, in the Chinese fashion, with a curved roof,
  bells and half moons in silver, tinkling in the slight breeze that blew from
  the sea in the evenings.</p>

  <p>The rooms were mostly circular and to avoid the tedium of the presence of
  servants, the dining table set with dishes, appeared from and sank through
  the floor by a mechanical device. The furniture was light and delicate; the
  ladies of the party in Parisian muslins and leghorn straw hats. They showed
  themselves kindly towards Florio whose long absence from society had given
  him an attractive romantic air in their eyes. They associated this withdrawal
  of a young man of wealth, rank and charm, from the companies he had so long
  adorned with some secret story of love, and admired him for his constancy
  while they regretted his indifference to themselves.</p>

  <p>They agreed that he seemed melancholy, had lost much of his philosophic
  air and displayed but a feeble interest in the arguments on art and letters
  where he had once shone; they remarked his amiable smile, the veiled
  expression in his topaz coloured eyes, the extreme simplicity of his dress
  and appointments, and some of them endeavoured to tease and tempt Bonino into
  disclosing the reason for his master's long wanderings across Europe and
  avoidance of those of his own rank.</p>

  <p>But the servant kept his counsel. None of these people had known of the
  sudden flight of the English visitors from Bologna and therefore they had no
  suspicion of the cause of the Prince of San Quirico's eccentric
  behaviour.</p>

  <p>For his part Florio found the retreat pleasant, it did not seem to be on
  the same island as Palermo.</p>

  <p>Here was nothing noisome, no fears, no anxieties. The air blew pure from
  the sea and was scented by the orange and lemon trees that were set in pots
  along the terraces and round the white tiled pagoda at the end of the cypress
  walk.</p>

  <p>The bright fruit had already formed along the dark leaves and the sun
  extracted an essence from the brilliant rind that mingled with perfume of the
  box hedges that edged the walks.</p>

  <p>Here was shade, here was water, in fountain and in pool, here was peace,
  elegance and agreeable company. Florio wished that here also was Letty.</p>

  <p>But time was drawing veils that soon would be veils of oblivion more
  closely round that fugitive figure; time not as is measured on clocks, but
  the time known to the spirit and the fantasy, that goes by leaps and starts
  or stays still, according to the place and the circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian journey had removed Letty far from her pursuer. She had left
  no memory at Chiaramonte, he could not think of her as at Palermo, and though
  he idly wished that he might find her on one of the marble seats by the
  termini with goats' heads and human masks shadowed by the grey foliage of the
  ilex trees, he would have thought her out of place there, and more and more
  definitely as the summer days passed did he think of her as returned to the
  safe cool north with her lover.</p>

  <p>Bonino, however, continued his labours in Palermo, going to the city every
  evening and searching carefully any place where he considered Philip Calamy
  might be. He did not share his master's dreamlike feeling that the English
  couple had left Italy. As a practical man this did not seem to him possible,
  and the "no way home" of Philip Calamy's compatriot was deeply impressed on
  his mind.</p>

  <p>He remained convinced that the Englishman would make his living in the way
  best suited to his needs and temperament, by gambling, and he guessed that
  the adventurer was doing this under some cunning disguise, since his natural
  appearance was so conspicuous and would have at once attracted attention and
  become known in Palermo.</p>

  <p>Nor, though he dutifully searched base habitations and vile abodes, did
  Bonino really expect to find Philip Calamy other than prosperous. He was too
  cunning, too brilliant, too accomplished not to have made, Bonino thought, a
  success of any roguery that he undertook.</p>

  <p>Yet again, the faithful servant argued to himself, if Philip Calamy had
  cut a figure at anything, it was odd that he, Bonino, with his constant
  combing of the purlieus of the city should not have heard of him. So Bonino
  continued another man's quest, becoming worn, frowning and taciturn with this
  vicarious burden so that even Florio bade him desist and rest until the cool
  autumn came.</p>

  <p>But Bonino would not leave his search, now on this excuse, and now on
  that, he went daily to Palermo sometimes not returning at night to the Villa
  Giandola.</p>

  <p>Florio did not trouble to explain his servant's continual absences though
  he knew that they must be observed. He and his acquaintances were linked in a
  gentle intimacy that might soon dissolve and they part never to meet again.
  They accepted him without wishing for an explanation of his reserves.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the women tried to reach him by music, by song and harp, spinet
  and flute, played when the swift dark fell and the large stars seemed to hang
  low enough to touch the tops of the cypress trees.</p>

  <p>He was touched by their tenderness and thanked them for their
  entertainment, but kept his secret without knowing that he had one, for he
  was not even aware that he was brooding in his mind over Letty Winslow. At
  this period her image had become blended into all his musings of fair women,
  and this though he knew that she was not beautiful. Philip Calamy he
  considered very little. His first anger at the thought that he had taken
  Letty into a place of pestilence had vanished. The summer was passing and
  there was no plague in Palermo, nor did he any longer think that Letty was
  hidden there.</p>

  <p>On the other hand Bonino thought of the man, and of the woman hardly at
  all. He supposed it quite likely that she was dead, or utterly broken and
  hidden away, so degraded that she was no longer Letty Winslow even to
  herself. For Bonino did not think, as his master did, that any mighty and
  pure passion bound Philip Calamy to his companion. Certainly it was difficult
  to find any other ground on which he could have made the cruel sacrifice of
  his elopement, yet Bonino did not credit that the Englishman loved Letty nor
  that he would not, on the best opportunity, be rid of her. But Bonino said
  nothing of this to his master.</p>

  <p>When he had, as he believed, exhausted all the disreputable gaming houses
  in Palermo, Bonino began to reflect anxiously on the private residences still
  open, where high play took place.</p>

  <p>He believed it possible that Philip Calamy had gained a footing in good
  society and was in some disguise or other, a hanger on of an establishment of
  the better sort where vice was accompanied by luxury, and idleness gilded by
  elegance.</p>

  <p>Careful inquiries brought one such residence under his suspicions. When he
  considered that he had his case clear he brought the matter to the notice of
  Florio.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>§ 28</h2>

  <p class="first">"Bonino, I begin to weary of this pleasant place," said Florio. "I am
  becoming inert, almost drowsy."</p>

  <p>"I think there is a chance that I may have found him, sir."</p>

  <p>It was the most lovely moment of the Sicilian dawn. Florio had sent for
  the servant to bring him some ice water and the two stood together by the
  window, overlooking the garden, Florio in a chamber robe, with the thin
  porcelain beaker in his hand.</p>

  <p>Bonino chose this time to bring his news, for they would not be
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he insisted, with an emphasis of his usual deference, "I
  believe I know where this artful foreigner is concealed."</p>

  <p>"It is the lady I search for."</p>

  <p>"I know, but to find one is to find the other," Bonino covered up his
  mistake.</p>

  <p>"I am very wearied," smiled Florio. "And mostly by dreams. I wonder you do
  not bear me a resentment, my faithful friend, for all the fatigue I have put
  you to&mdash;out of idleness&mdash;I have sent you to chase my chimera."</p>

  <p>Bonino blushed with pleasure and looked intently at his master's gentle
  and noble face, pale from a sleepless night.</p>

  <p>"I do not take so fanciful a view, sir. I am a common man searching for,
  as I think, an uncommon rogue, and I believe I have found him."</p>

  <p>Florio glanced at the servant in perplexity. His musings had been so long
  drawn from reality, certainly during his sojourn near the Golden Shell, that
  this hint of something concrete seemed like an intrusion.</p>

  <p>"There is a Russian come, none knows how, to Palermo," said Bonino. "An
  old man, who boasts of having once served the Empress Catherine. Some say he
  is really a Scot. He has hired the palace of Prince Camaldi that is of modest
  pretensions and situate near the outskirts of the city, near some ruined
  dwellings and a tavern. This man, who is named Demetrious, or some such
  title, and claims to be a prince, is of sober and respectable repute and
  sufficient fortune to maintain himself. The story&mdash;spread by
  himself&mdash;is that he brought a store of plunder from St. Petersburg and
  has since been travelling the world spending it."</p>

  <p>Florio noticed the seriousness of his servant's voice and feigned an
  interest in this report. He observed that Bonino looked strained, fatigued
  and lean and he felt remorseful because of the hardships he had undertaken
  for what he himself accounted a tedious folly.</p>

  <p>Intent on his tale, Bonino proceeded.</p>

  <p>"A careful scrutiny shows this old Russian to be of dubious origin, a
  stranger to Palermo and a keen gambler, though Sicilian society knows nothing
  of him. He entertains all new corners to the city, sending invitations to all
  foreigners, discreetly enough&mdash;in short, he runs a gambling hell. It is
  difficult for anyone whom he suspects to obtain admittance to his house, and
  he suspects all but likely victims of his skill at cards. He has a young
  woman with him who is, or feigns to be, his daughter. She is seldom seen, but
  graces the tables now and then."</p>

  <p>"A gambler's decoy," remarked Florio, watching the brilliant light spread
  over the garden.</p>

  <p>"Exactly, but it is all done very well. Now there is an aide, or
  secretary, in this establishment, who is supposed to be a Frenchman, a
  Monsieur Désiré, but I think this is Philip Calamy."</p>

  <p>"Why, Bonino?"</p>

  <p>"The description of his person, though disguised, sounds like that of the
  Englishman, who has already passed as French and is extremely clever at these
  masks. Moreover, this is the kind of employment that he would seek and
  obtain."</p>

  <p>"Where would Mrs. Winslow be</p>

  <p>"In some little casino&mdash;safe, no doubt," said Bonino with the precise
  caution he used on this subject.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do not think Mr. Calamy would take her into that kind of
  underworld," agreed Florio confidently. "Your story is strange, Bonino. I
  know you would only tell me this after careful consideration, yet I cannot
  see how you connect Philip Calamy with this Désiré."</p>

  <p>"If he be not this fellow, then I cannot think that he is in Palermo,"
  said Bonino with a sigh of fatigue. "Pray recall, sir, how I have
  searched."</p>

  <p>"Why should this gentleman&mdash;as he is&mdash;leave the dignity and
  respect that he had at Chiaramonte, for this vile life?" Florio again put
  this question that was so hard for him to answer.</p>

  <p>"He is a gambler, sir, and would not be under an obligation to you."</p>

  <p>"And to that he would sacrifice this unfortunate lady who lost everything
  for him?" asked Florio doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, sir, that the Englishman is thinking of what he lost for
  her."</p>

  <p>But Florio had already taken this news in the romantic spirit he now so
  frequently indulged.</p>

  <p>"There is something noble," he declared, "in this man, outcast as he is,
  undertaking this degrading occupation to keep this lady in safety and hidden,
  even from the casual eye. Yes, I can understand that out of a jealousy that
  she should not accept anyone's favour he took her away from Chiaramonte, and
  that he would have no means of supporting her, save in a large city and by
  his wits. Surely a constant love unites them and he is happy in his card
  sharping as she is in her retreat."</p>

  <p>"If you think this, sir," suggested Bonino modestly, "should you not leave
  them alone? Supposing that this Monsieur Désiré is Mr. Calamy, what purpose
  do you serve by discovering him?"</p>

  <p>"That is reasonable," agreed Florio. "But I am not in a reasonable mood. I
  wish keenly to see this man and to discover how he lives. I must know the end
  of this love story."</p>

  <p>"The end will not be yet, sir."</p>

  <p>Florio ignored this and asked Bonino to obtain full particulars of the
  Russian's establishment, at the same time keeping an open eye for any other
  possible clue to the whereabouts of the English couple.</p>

  <p>The servant set off on this business, not with an easy heart, for the
  investigation promised to be tedious, but with the conviction that in the
  expert gambler who assisted the Russian to run his discreet household, he
  would discover Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>Sedate and civil Bonino had contrived to make many acquaintances in
  Palermo who were helpful to him in his schemes. He now professed himself to
  be the steward and temporary guardian of a young nobleman from central Italy,
  a second son with some property, who was travelling for pleasure during the
  interval between his studies.</p>

  <p>As Bonino had a precise knowledge of the families, armorial bearings,
  estates and histories of the country, he was soon accepted as what he claimed
  to be, and got into the acquaintance of several needy hangers on to gentility
  who offered to affect an introduction to the life of pleasure of the capital
  in a decorous fashion.</p>

  <p>In this manner Bonino found a man who frequented the Russian's
  <i>salon</i> and who was able to give some account of it, though he said that
  this gambling resort, for it was nothing else, was conducted with an air of
  reserve and mystery, artfully used to heighten the excitement of the
  play.</p>

  <p>The owner was old, a Moscovite, wearing the ancient dress of the Boyards
  and a long white beard, yet full of vigour and energy. He seldom appeared
  until towards the end of the day's play, and then not for long. The
  Secretary, Monsieur Désiré, was adroit and lively&mdash;undoubtedly he
  cheated and was an expert at clearing out the pockets of the unwary, but this
  was done by such clever means that the victims could not find any cause for
  complaint.</p>

  <p>Lydia, the fascinating daughter of the Russian worthy, helped to beguile
  the players into high stakes and soothed them when they were dejected by
  their losses.</p>

  <p>So far scandal had been avoided, but, as Bonino's informant declared, any
  day some trouble would break out and some formal complaint be made to the
  police about the Russian, "and then they will all decamp and disappear over
  night."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile it would be an amusing place to take a young scholar to,
  forewarned he need not lose much money, if any, for newcomers were often
  allowed to win, and he need not return.</p>

  <p>"He is a grave youth," said Bonino, "and already longs to return to his
  studies. But he considers that while in Palermo he should visit some well
  conducted gambling <i>salon</i> and note the manners of those who frequent
  them."</p>

  <p>This man was a Florentine, poor, but of decent birth, who had been bred
  for the Church, but disliking that life had become an actor and attached
  himself to the establishments of wealthy people, living by his wits, and
  sometimes almost as a professional fool. He had been cast away in Palermo
  because he fell sick when in the train of a luxurious traveller and when
  Bonino met him was acting as a guide to the more refined entertainments of
  the town.</p>

  <p>In this capacity he had had access to the mansion of the Russian,
  Demitrious, and permission to take there any likely young gentleman.</p>

  <p>"I do no evil by this," the fellow assured Bonino. "For I always warn any
  I take to this establishment to be on their guard. Youthful curiosity must be
  satisfied and it is better that it should be indulged in this way than
  grossly."</p>

  <p>He added that on some evenings there was little or no play, but a concert
  of music and learned conversation. In this manner Florio San Quirico received
  the entry into the house of the old Russian that was named the Palazzo
  Vizzavona, the original owner having been a Corsican grandee, though since
  sold to Prince Camoldi. The neighbourhood had decayed from its former
  splendour; the road, ankle deep in yellow dust, was deserted; two empty
  mansions rising from the yellow rock, showed gaunt and broken against the
  glare of the sunlight, large acanthus plants thrust their strong leaves
  through the broken windows, heaps of fallen masonry filled the courtyards
  where they had lain since the last earthquake tremor from Etna, between them
  grew ilex trees, cactus and the poets laurel.</p>

  <p>Beyond these neglected palaces was the ruin of an ancient temple in pale
  golden alabaster, the fluted pillar cracked, the roof half fallen and stuck
  with tafts of dark flowers and prickly fern.</p>

  <p>In the base of this pagan building was a wine shop, a rude habitation,
  sheltered by a projecting thatch of dry reeds and showing, as a trade sign, a
  bunch of withered box boughs on a pole.</p>

  <p>A mule and some peasants were in the shade of this humble erection, they
  staring at Florio and his companions with the intelligent and abstracted
  interest of their race.</p>

  <p>The Palazzo Vizzavona lay beyond this humble <i>osteria</i> and stood in a
  well-kept and paved garden where the fine foliage of the pepper tree and the
  rich fruit of the pomegranate showed clear and brilliant in the blaze of
  light.</p>

  <p>Then, as their guide pulled the bell chain at the portico, the dark fell
  swiftly as a purple veil dropped from the heavens over the earth, and the
  three men were admitted by what seemed to be invisible means into a large
  hall.</p>

  <p>As Florio's eyes became accustomed to the darkness he perceived that the
  door had been opened by an elegant negro wearing a livery of striped silk in
  the Roman fashion.</p>

  <p>After taking their hats and cloaks he conducted them up a marble staircase
  to a circular chamber where overhead candelabra were already lit.</p>

  <p>Florio found something oppressive in the atmosphere, that was loaded with
  the fumes of incense as if never changed with the freshness of the outer
  air.</p>

  <p>The furniture, black and massive, was in the Italian style, painted with
  scenes of pagan landscapes and adorned with heavy gilding. A large table
  occupied the centre of the room and chairs were placed about it, that facing
  the door being in the shape of a throne.</p>

  <p>Bowls and ewers of lustred majolica stood on a buffet, with fruit, flagons
  of wine and napkins.</p>

  <p>The back of the chamber was filled by a small raised stage, from which a
  curtain of straw-coloured silk was partly drawn aside by a thick gold cord.
  The drop cloth represented a pine forest and a storm coming up out of an
  azure sky.</p>

  <p>This stage was carefully lit by concealed lamps that cast an enchanting
  glow over the set.</p>

  <p>Florio found the place distasteful, perhaps, as he reminded himself,
  because he knew its character. It seemed to him forced, unnatural and tawdry;
  he hesitated as to whether or not this place was likely to be the haunt of
  Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>There were other guests, all men, and of the commonplace character of
  idlers, or those, at least, indulging in idleness. They saluted Florio with
  civility and accepted him for what he appeared to be, though the extreme
  simplicity of his dress and the distinction of his bearing marked him as
  different from the usual seeker for pleasure who attended the house of
  Demetrious.</p>

  <p>The Russian soon made his entrance and then took his place in the
  thronelike seat, bowing to the assembly.</p>

  <p>He wore the stiff robes and silk scarves of the formal dress of the
  Boyards, before the reforms forced on them by Peter the Great, and Florio
  found this eccentricity displeasing.</p>

  <p>A hat of glittering brocade that increased his height by a couple of feet
  was set on heavy grey locks, and a full white beard flowed over the old man's
  chest. He had the appearance of vigour and authority, but his eyes were
  concealed by a pair of spectacles of frosted glass and the light was arranged
  to fall on the crown of his hat and leave his face in shade, so that it was
  difficult to judge of him save that he appeared monstrous in his barbaric
  attire, that was composed of the richest possible velvets, satins and
  embroideries.</p>

  <p>By his side stood a tall, dark young man in modern dress who was not
  Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>This personage shook a pile of gold coins on to the table and announced
  that Prince Demetrious would play to-night and himself hold the bank.</p>

  <p>"Is that Monsieur Désiré?" whispered Florio to the Florentine.</p>

  <p>A nod answered him and he turned to Bonino.</p>

  <p>"Let us depart, we were mistaken," he said very softly. "I have no heart
  for this scene."</p>

  <p>Bonino was about to protest that to leave suddenly would be to attract
  undesirable attention, and the Russian, who had turned his unwieldy bulk
  towards the strangers, seemed as if going to speak, when a woman stepped on
  to the stage behind the group in the chamber. The negro followed her and
  placed a silver chair in the shape of a cockle shell in the centre of the
  stage. In this she seated herself, pulled out her skirts, held up her head
  and remained still, as if posing for her portrait.</p>

  <p>Her entry, the movement of the Russian and Florio's whisper had all been
  simultaneous and in a moment of time.</p>

  <p>Florio looked at the woman and saw that she was Letty Winslow and that she
  was wearing one of the antique dresses from Chiaramonte, of white silk, with
  gold bullion. Her red hair was piled on the top of her head and held by combs
  of coral; her face was skilfully painted and the stage light was flattering.
  She looked beautiful, in an artificial and heartless fashion.</p>

  <p>The Russian looked at Florio who remained motionless and silent, then he
  swept the money back into the bag and declared in a deep voice that there
  would be no play that evening.</p>

  <p>Several of the guests murmured and one asked if there would be supper, at
  least, and music, offered by the Princess Lydia.</p>

  <p>"You know my humour," replied the Russian, still staring at Florio. "It
  changes. I respect omens, also, and I have had one now. Désiré, see that
  these gentlemen are attended to the door."</p>

  <p>"What is this?" whispered the Florentine to Bonino, who replied: "As he
  says&mdash;or perhaps he has seen an enemy."</p>

  <p>The guests rose to depart, glancing reluctantly at the adorned woman, who
  sat aloof and indifferent, on the stage, not seeing what was taking place
  beyond the foot-lights.</p>

  <p>"I shall stay," said Florio in English, leaning across the table.</p>

  <p>The Russian replied in the same language: "I thought so, damn you."</p>

  <p>"Pray depart with the others," said Bonino to the Florentine. "I know
  where to find you for your reward. My charge has found an acquaintance in
  this Russian and they would discourse privately."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>§ 29</h2>

  <p class="first">Philip Calamy pulled off the beard, the hat and the wig, passed a
  handkerchief over his face and opened the stiff collar of his gorgeous
  tunic.</p>

  <p>"How long did it take you to discover me?" he asked softly. "And what, in
  the devil's name, was it to do with you?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," said Florio. He looked wan, even ghostly. The lights and
  the disguises, all arranged to deceive, gave him a sense of illusion, as if
  he were taking part in some charade. He felt as if other figures besides
  those of Philip Calamy, Bonino and Letty, were present, crowding in on him
  and passing up and down in the shadows between the lamps.</p>

  <p>"Eh, well," remarked the Englishman. "We had come to about the end of
  Palermo. And I am weary of this tiresome disguise. Are you still prepared to
  help us?"</p>

  <p>"That is brutally put," murmured Florio. He rose and approached the stage.
  "Madam, Mrs. Winslow, will you please to descend?"</p>

  <p>"She has forgotten that name," said Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am wrong and it is no longer hers&mdash;is the Colonel dead and
  have you married her?"</p>

  <p>Florio spoke thus naturally because he had so often dreamt of just this
  happening.</p>

  <p>Letty had come to the footlights, and, holding up the rich gown that was
  too long for her, peered into the confusion of lights and shadows beyond the
  stage.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she asked. "Who is calling me? Who speaks to Mrs. Winslow?
  Ah, I see you, Prince. I thought you would follow us from Chiaramonte. I
  shall come down."</p>

  <p>But when she entered the room from a side door she did not know what to
  say or do, and sat on the first chair that came, looking at Philip Calamy
  like a spaniel.</p>

  <p>"Wait for me outside," said Florio to Bonino, and the servant, dejected
  now that his quest was over, left the room.</p>

  <p>Philip Calainy was silent, as if leaving the moment to the others; he
  flung off his tunic and scarves and sat in his white silk blouse, open at the
  throat, his beauty was emphatic, even under the smear of grease paint still
  on his face.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" asked Florio, at last, looking at Letty.</p>

  <p>She was worn, appeared older than her years; he noticed the thinness of
  her throat and hands, her air of essential timidity under the bravery of the
  splendid dress.</p>

  <p>"We travel under false passports," said Philip Calamy. "You could report
  us to the police for that. But why? Do you resent our departure from
  Chiaramonte? It was confoundedly dull and I lacked money."</p>

  <p>"I would have provided you."</p>

  <p>"I preferred to earn it. And you would hardly have made endless provision
  for the only way of life open to us."</p>

  <p>"We took your clothes," said Letty suddenly. "I had nothing fine. I keep
  them carefully and only wear them here."</p>

  <p>"Well?" demanded Philip Calamy, rising. "What, sir, do you want of a man
  completely ruined? What is this searching interest in me and my poor
  companion?"</p>

  <p>"Your poor companion," repeated Florio. "What is she now</p>

  <p>"What you see. A gambler's decoy and lure. She can do nothing else, nor
  this much longer. She is faded and often ill."</p>

  <p>"He is kind to me," said Letty eagerly. "You must not think that I am ill
  treated. It is but to sit in an easy chair, and help with the entertainment
  of a few gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to stay?" asked Florio.</p>

  <p>She was amazed.</p>

  <p>"What else?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You waste your chivalry," remarked Philip Calamy. "The woman is as
  content as she can be. You heard her say that she is well treated. I have
  kept my word to you. Now that you have discovered us, we must pass on.
  Perhaps you can again oblige us in the matter of passports."</p>

  <p>"Dear Letty," said Florio, "will you leave us, and take off that mumming
  dress, and come here presently in your ordinary attire?"</p>

  <p>"Go, Letty," added Philip, and when she obeyed, he added: "It is useless
  for you to command her, she listens only to me."</p>

  <p>The door closed on Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>"You see," continued Philip Calamy, "she is quite ruined now&mdash;good
  for nothing but this. Her voice is not trained and she is a poor musician. I
  only pass her off as a beauty by the lights and the stage effects."</p>

  <p>"You never loved her," said Florio.</p>

  <p>"No. And you have only guessed that now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, only now. That was why I was interested in you, because I thought it
  was love."</p>

  <p>"You were wrong."</p>

  <p>"So I see. But you lost everything for her."</p>

  <p>"That was a bet," smiled Philip Calamy. "I made a bet among my fellow
  officers that I would have every girl with that shade of red hair. I won a
  good deal of money though it is an uncommon shade. Then I met Letty&mdash;a
  Field Officer's wife and simple, two children, high rank, stiff relatives. I
  should have been wise to let her alone. But I'd taken on the bet. And Colonel
  Winslow was in India. Of course the others egged me on&mdash;it took me a
  season's hard work, but she was as willing as the others in time. When she
  heard that her husband was returning she lost her head and rushed to my
  rooms. I was well in debt and didn't fancy a bullet through my head. Winslow
  is a violent man. Besides, to elope with the exquisite, unattainable Mrs.
  Winslow was something. So I took her to the Continent. It was the betting
  money we lived on. We did quite well, until Winslow had leave of absence to
  follow us."</p>

  <p>"And I prevented him from finding you and killing you," whispered
  Florio.</p>

  <p>"I might have killed <i>him,</i> I'm a good shot. But I dare say he's a
  better by now. Practises day and night, my friends write. I still have them
  and they still write to me." Philip Calamy smiled and added quietly: "Damn
  him to Hell."</p>

  <p>"He rather should curse you."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't like me." The Englishman's smile deepened unpleasantly. "But
  he's got his revenge, damn him again. He keeps me out of England. Not that
  there is much there for me since I was cashiered. I should be cut everywhere.
  But I'd like to see my own country again."</p>

  <p>"You are clever at disguise and lies," said Florio bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I dare not risk it. If I returned, he'd find out. And it would
  not even be a duel, for which I have no fancy, it would be plain murder."</p>

  <p>"And justified, if ever murder is," said Florio.</p>

  <p>"You think so? Well, I've no wish to pay with my life for breaking a
  social law. I've paid enough," he added with a passionate note. "And I'll
  stay abroad."</p>

  <p>Florio gazed at him intently where he leaned by the footlights of the
  little stage, and could have pitied him for his youth, beauty, brilliancy and
  ruin, were it not for the thought of Letty.</p>

  <p>"You have been patient in tracking us down," added Philip Calamy, "and
  deserve the truth. Besides, I am weary of playing the hero of romance. It
  used to amuse me&mdash;you thinking I did for love what I'd only have done
  for a bet."</p>

  <p>"I was certainly fooled," said Florio sternly.</p>

  <p>"And in love with Letty yourself, in a fashion? That is infernally queer.
  She isn't even pretty&mdash;save for that hair&mdash;and silly. At first she
  was tolerable with her devotion and fresh ways. A gentlewoman of her breeding
  was a novelty for me. Then she was very docile about the masquerades. I'd
  always liked masks and charades. Now I am weary of her&mdash;weary."</p>

  <p>"But it is impossible for her, either, to return to England."</p>

  <p>"Colonel Winslow wouldn't murder her," smiled the Englishman. "I daresay
  he would even make some provision for her."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible for her to return to England!" repeated Florio.</p>

  <p>"O, yes. The escort, for one thing&mdash;how is she to get there? I was
  not thinking of that. I suppose you are still interested in her as you have
  taken all this trouble to discover her?"</p>

  <p>He paused and Florio made a quick inclination of his head.</p>

  <p>"Then take her off my hands," said Philip Calamy. "You've stayed your
  course and there is your prize."</p>

  <p>He looked at Florio as if he said a careless thing and spoke of someone of
  no import.</p>

  <p>The moment was neither large nor impressive. The comedy seemed to have
  become a farce and Florio felt as if cast for the part of buffoon.</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy leaned over the stage and turned out one of the lamps that
  was smoking, thus increasing the hot shadows that filled the room.</p>

  <p>"Pluto, the negro," he remarked, "usually snuffs the candles every half
  hour and to-night he has not dared to enter, so the grease is falling."</p>

  <p>And he pointed up to the candelabra where the wax was gathering down the
  crystal pendants, obscuring the glitter of the prisms.</p>

  <p>"You turn everything to futility," said Florio.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me what else it is?" asked the Englishman. "And were you not
  always the tolerant worldling, fastidiously idle, amused by my predicament?
  And yet&mdash;did you come here for some scene of melodrama? Did you want an
  accent of fury? Was I to be unmasked in some vulgar fashion?"</p>

  <p>"I did not know that you required unmasking," replied Florio. "I thought
  that you were Désiré the Frenchman..." then he paused, aware that he had been
  delicately pushed into an attitude of self defence, that the tragic issue
  between them had been insolently overlaid. He found it difficult to recover
  his usual unconscious self-assurance.</p>

  <p>"Désiré," said Philip Calamy, "is an agreeable rogue I picked up here.
  Come, I don't suppose that we care much for one another's company&mdash;why
  not settle the question of Letty? Will you take her and what will you give me
  for her?"</p>

  <p>Florio was involved in the intricacy of an endless complication. He felt
  that Philip Calamy, in thus breaking down all civil usage, was revealing a
  fine skill in getting his own way. It was clear to Florio that he really
  wanted money, and that he was deliberately employing these coarse methods to
  achieve his ends quickly.</p>

  <p>"Come," added the Englishman, with a mocking urgency, "you can hardly
  expect me to hold her in respect. I've looked after her for years now, and I
  told you the whole folly was the result of a bet. Why pretend that my offer
  is of a delicate nature?"</p>

  <p>Florio, still at a disadvantage, said: "I suppose you still consider
  yourself a man of honour?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. This has nothing to do with honour, as you well know."</p>

  <p>"Then how can you try to make this brutal bargain?" But Florio felt that
  he spoke feebly and was being outwitted at every turn. The manner in which
  Philip Calamy spoke of Letty certainly gave her a dwindling value that
  increased Florio's deep compassion for her desolation.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have not considered that she is fond of you?" he asked
  sadly.</p>

  <p>"As a spaniel. As Pluto, the negro, whom I bought here in Palermo. There's
  trading in flesh and blood. Unlawful, no doubt, but the fellow is worth more
  than Letty is."</p>

  <p>Florio mastered himself. He was resolved to master the other man also. He
  spoke softly, with native guile, and the duplicity of his rank and race.</p>

  <p>"How is she now? In health and spirits? Hardly the Letty of Bologna, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy glanced at him sharply and smiled, as if to say: "Whether
  this tone is sincere or not, it is one easy to me."</p>

  <p>He responded in an equable accent, as one talking disinterestedly about
  another's tale.</p>

  <p>"She has a certain craze of mind that renders her unfit for the management
  of a house or a life of fashion. She is abstracted, weeps often, for no
  cause."</p>

  <p>"For no cause," repeated Florio.</p>

  <p>"None," smiled Philip. "She is kindly treated. She told you that herself.
  She is lazy, idle, reads romances, when we can get them, and I have tried in
  vain to improve her education. She is a dull companion."</p>

  <p>"Does she never speak of her husband or her children?"</p>

  <p>"No. Why should she?"</p>

  <p>"No regrets? No longings?"</p>

  <p>"You quite mistake her. She enjoys this kind of life. She was absolutely
  bored with her elderly husband, her sickly infants, her censorious
  sisters-in-law. You have no idea," and he laughed, "my dear Prince, of the
  existence my respectable countrywomen lead."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Florio carefully, "she is content with you and it would be a
  cruelty to take her away."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose I can keep her until one of us dies?" demanded Philip with
  a touch of savagery. "I was considering how to be rid of her, when you came,
  opportunely."</p>

  <p>"What do you intend to do?"</p>

  <p>"O, I have no plans. This disguise I assumed, gave me thought of Russia.
  It is difficult to avoid the war now. Venice, perhaps. At least I wish to
  travel alone."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall ask Letty her wishes."</p>

  <p>"She has none."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you command her entirely?"</p>

  <p>"Put it that way, if you will. But all this talk is tedious. You have
  spoiled the evening's play and owe me something on that score."</p>

  <p>Florio, though still in control of himself, was conscious of little but
  fatigue, falling over him like a cloak of lead.</p>

  <p>This meeting, this unmasking, had proved an anticlimax, a bathos.</p>

  <p>The candles, now flaring, lighted up the dark furniture, the wan face of
  Florio, the wild beauty of Philip, and sent wreaths of smoke slowly curling
  through the close atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Philip moved and pulled down the candelabra, one by one, and extinguished
  the candles with the large cowl that hung to the chain.</p>

  <p>Florio watched these flames, put out one by one, until the room was in
  darkness and the lamps before the stage stood out more distinctly and cast a
  clearer radiance over the drop cloth and the yellow curtain.</p>

  <p>"I only recognized you," said Philip, "as Letty entered the
  stage&mdash;the very moment of my own entry&mdash;had you not seen her, I
  should have continued the comedy for the pleasure of deceiving you."</p>

  <p>"You think that in me you have met with an eccentric," remarked Florio.
  "And it's true that you have fooled me. But now we have come to a narrow
  issue. I also can be frank. I am a man of wealth and power, you are utterly
  penniless and undone, an outcast quite lost to your own rank, that I take to
  be near my own."</p>

  <p>"Do you not suppose that I have faced that, a hundred times?" replied the
  Englishman. "I am restless and desperate, hunted, if you will, and I have
  exhausted every shift, so that I am hardly safe anywhere, for I know not if
  this fanatic still pursues me by means of spies and agents, or no. What then?
  Why do you seek to contrast our states?"</p>

  <p>"I can say no more to you until I have spoken to Letty," replied Florio.
  "I think you have played an evil part&mdash;all your life, as it seems to me.
  But your position is so wretched that I cannot take offence at any of your
  wildness."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in sin?" mocked Philip. "I suppose your Church teaches
  that. For me I do not believe in God."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because you spoke of evil and the word awoke some echoes in my mind. I
  wished to silence you if you were going to speak of punishment or divine
  vengeance. I have not broken any human laws, and as for God, I care nothing
  for fables."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," said Florio, "though they are all founded on truth. No need for
  me to speak of punishment, you are punished already."</p>

  <p>"I won my bet," smiled Philip. "And I should have had to leave England and
  the army in any case&mdash;too many debts. My uncle is as wealthy and
  powerful as you are, but he will have nothing more to do with me, neither
  will my cousin, so I had no expectations&mdash;so this life is not so
  distasteful, only I want to be rid of Letty."</p>

  <p>His tone, his movements, were beginning to reveal a passionate
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"Have I not been clear enough?" he exclaimed. "Will you take Letty off my
  hands?"</p>

  <p>"I shall see her," said Florio.</p>

  <p>Under his composed exterior was a crisis of emotion that he himself could
  not have described. Letty was still to him ravaged innocence, and her
  companion a proper object of scorn. One, moreover, who had proved intractable
  even against his own interests, by preferring this squalid quackery and
  cheating to the dignity and repose of Chiaramonte.</p>

  <p>Yet Florio could not hate the exile, who, for all his bravado and bitter
  candour, was at the end of all his resources, his country and all honourable
  ways closed to him, his youth, beauty and passions but a mockery and a scorn
  to him, for they were useless and would indeed but serve him for dismal
  ends.</p>

  <p>"I shall have this house watched, and the ports," said Florio, moving
  close to the flickering light of the lamps on the stage. "You boasted just
  now that you had never broken the law. You have done so with your false
  passports, and I could have you arrested."</p>

  <p>"But you will not do so."</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose that I will not?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is not in your nature," replied Philip. "But do not concern
  yourself. I shall remain here until you have decided how far you can help
  me."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and opened a side door.</p>

  <p>"Letty will be in the chamber&mdash;up the spiral staircase&mdash;pray go
  and talk to her, she will have some supper ready. Pluto will wait on me down
  here."</p>

  <p>"You put yourself in my power?" asked Florio.</p>

  <p>"No, chance did that," remarked the Englishman carelessly. He closed the
  door on Florio, who stood in a dimly lit passage, the staircase rising
  directly, in an elegant twist, to his right hand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>§ 30</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio endeavoured to know himself, to understand the turmoil of his own
  emotions. He stood still, pressing his hot brow on the cool metal scrolled
  baluster of the staircase. He felt no pleasure or even relief in this meeting
  with those whom he had so long and so steadily pursued. Their degradation and
  their acceptance of it with a ghastly calm, humility on the woman's part, and
  reckless composure on the man's, was dreadful to Florio and seemed a reproach
  to his own life of luxury and even idleness that had never been ruffled by
  any grief, loss or temptation.</p>

  <p>They seemed beyond his reach. Even pity could not touch them. Philip
  Calamy only wanted money to help him to sink even lower, to escape from
  Palermo and live by lower tricks in a lower stratum of society.</p>

  <p>Probably he had many debts and was being watched by the police. He was
  certainly anxious to continue his restless wanderings and had been even
  thankful at his exposure by Florio.</p>

  <p>He wanted to be rid of Letty. Perhaps his gross offer to Florio had been
  in the hope of a quarrel. "He might," thought the subtle Bolognese, "have
  wished to fight with me. He expected resentment, yet I felt none, only that I
  wished that I had not saved him from Colonel Winslow, but allowed him to be
  overtaken then and shot like a beast of prey, as his pursuer intended to
  shoot him."</p>

  <p>Florio thought of the Villa Giandola by the Golden Shell that he had left
  so recently, of the pleasant family there and their friendly ways, and of the
  kind welcome they would give to the English couple.</p>

  <p>They would be received as Florio's acquaintances, without as much as a
  questioning glance, and Philip would be very popular with his brilliant good
  looks, his easy manners, his entertaining tricks.</p>

  <p>"He could easily," thought Florio, "find a place in a wealthy family and
  make a rich match, were he given an <i>entrée</i> into society. And he is
  right, he has done nothing that would be condemned in Italy as far as the
  elopement goes; as for the cheating at cards, one could be silent about
  that."</p>

  <p>Then Florio was angry with himself for this random reflection. It was
  impossible for him to give Philip the countenance that would mean his
  reception in Continental society, he did not even know who the man was. He
  himself had been resigned to his own outcast position and must be left to
  fall lower in his schemes of intrigue and knavery, until some chance scuffle,
  some chance disease sent him to prison or hospital, or extinguished his life
  as rapidly and carelessly as he had extinguished the flaring candles.</p>

  <p>Neither did Florio deceive himself into thinking that Letty could be
  rescued from the ruin that enveloped her; she was not utterly lost to the
  conventions of Italian society as she had been before to the conventions of
  English society.</p>

  <p>He considered the quiet convents he knew&mdash;those in valleys of the
  Apennines, set in fields of wild thyme, came to his mind, where the penitent
  and the broken might be received into a healing solitude and silence.</p>

  <p>And in thinking thus, Florio was unconsciously and at last taking Letty's
  own valuation of herself and using the terms and symbols of his own religion
  that he did not admit he held, but that in moments of stress overcame his
  mind, like dark, cool shadows.</p>

  <p>And then he could not endure to think of Letty as closed away in
  loneliness, and he wished that he had a sister or a mother who could have
  advised him what to do with her, and then again he wondered what were his own
  feelings for her, and if he loved her, even a little.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31"></a>§ 31</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio saw at once that all the splendour of the Palazzo Vizzavona was in
  the gambling <i>salons.</i> The room he entered, though tastefully arranged,
  showed bare poverty. Letty had, with her ready habit of obedience, changed
  into her own clothes; these were several years out of fashion and worn, limp,
  washed ruffles revealed her thin wrists. She had wiped the cosmetics from her
  face that appeared hollow and pallid; her abundant red hair hung in tangles
  on her narrow shoulders.</p>

  <p>By her side, on the straight hard couch, sat the dog Rover. He looked at
  Florio with a dumb appeal that was also the expression of his
  mistress&mdash;it was as if both of them said: "We are helpless, we have done
  wrong, do with us as you will, we shall not complain."</p>

  <p>A cheap metal lamp lit this scene, and the scanty array of wine flagons
  and goblets on a plain wooden table. With a hasty motion of a trembling hand
  Letty indicated a seat, but Florio remained standing. It was intolerable to
  him that these two powerless creatures should gaze at him with
  resignation.</p>

  <p>"Is that dog whipped that he looks so?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Letty. "It is Rover&mdash;you remember at Nuremberg? He loves
  me, you see, and knows my mood. He asks you to forgive me."</p>

  <p>"How are you accountable to me?"</p>

  <p>"O, you trusted me to ask you if I was in need," replied Letty humbly.
  "You wished me to be respected, you offered me Chiaramonte. But I left that
  to follow Philip&mdash;stealing from you also."</p>

  <p>"You love him, of course, as the dog loves you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I am now wedded to this wandering life, and I can never
  leave it now. I have no will but his, and no desire to please anyone else.
  But I ask your pardon, sincerely."</p>

  <p>"How do you live, Mrs. Winslow?"</p>

  <p>She started at the name.</p>

  <p>"O, pray do not call me that here! I live well enough, truly I do. Philip
  is kind."</p>

  <p>"Always...kind?"</p>

  <p>"He has his moods," she admitted, downcast. "And sometimes I do not see
  him for days, but he always sends me money by Pluto and he always
  returns."</p>

  <p>She fondled the dog that continued to gaze anxiously at Florio.</p>

  <p>"Please leave us," she added. "I cannot understand why you follow us.
  Please forget us. It humiliates me&mdash;yes, I am still capable of being
  humiliated&mdash;to see you."</p>

  <p>She rested her head on the dog's neck and wept softly. More from weariness
  than wretchedness, Florio thought. "See, sir, this poor little friend of
  mine, how he entreats you to be gone."</p>

  <p>"I must think how I can serve you, Letty."</p>

  <p>"You cannot. No one can. I hope that I do not live long." She uttered this
  commonplace not peevishly, but almost tenderly. "I have been very ill, as
  foreigners are, from the unhealthy night airs and the noisome vapours. I have
  been melancholy and despondent."</p>

  <p>"You would soon recover in cheerful surroundings."</p>

  <p>"Do you not perceive how fallen I am? I have to amuse the men Philip
  cheats at cards."</p>

  <p>"Stuck up on that tawdry stage, decked out&mdash;why the perpetual
  masquerade?" exclaimed Florio.</p>

  <p>"Philip likes that&mdash;the mask&mdash;and the lower we sink, the more he
  desires to disguise himself, even from himself."</p>

  <p>Florio sat beside her on the hard couch and took her shaking hands in his
  strong fingers. The dog sighed and laid his head on his mistress's knee; she
  tried to hide her face by lowering her head so that the red curls, still
  entwined with tinsel ribbons, fell over her wet eyes. Florio thought that she
  was still in poor health and that her air of listless sorrow was due to
  weakness as much as to shame. The excitement of meeting Florio soon left her,
  she withdrew her hands, that were of an unhealthy heat, and rising with an
  effort poured out some wine.</p>

  <p>"So," Florio thought, "is she used to entertaining Philip Calamy's
  victims."</p>

  <p>He dare not tell her of the fantastic suggestion that Philip had made to
  him, that he should take her away, buy her, as the Englishman had termed it;
  nor dare he question her as to how far her complaisance with her master's
  interests had gone. He could not believe of Philip Calamy that he had allowed
  her to take lovers, but he would not have ventured to question either of them
  on this for fear of what he might hear. Nor did it greatly matter. She was
  utterly degraded, a gambler's decoy, set up on a stage to be stared at, like
  a wanton at a fair. But still he could not think of her grossly, nor with
  contempt, only with regret.</p>

  <p>She was drawing fast to that end he had always dreaded for her. A lonely
  and a stupid death.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever hear from England?" he asked, setting aside the wine she
  offered him.</p>

  <p>"O, no! Who should write to me?" she asked, alarmed. "Philip hears
  sometimes from Captain Giles, of whom I told you. I do not know how he
  arranges it, but he is able to receive letters under cover of Banks. He has
  not heard for a long time now," she added pensively. "He went yesterday and
  there was nothing."</p>

  <p>"Does he ever have any news?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing he tells me&mdash;no, how could it be good news?"</p>

  <p>"The future promises you nothing," said Florio. "Could you not nerve
  yourself to leave this man?"</p>

  <p>"O, no. I am more bound to him than if I were his wife."</p>

  <p>"One day he may leave you."</p>

  <p>"He will never do that. O, I know that I have only brought him disaster
  and disgrace, but he would never leave me."</p>

  <p>Florio could say no more, his heart was pinched, he lacked strength to
  argue with her, he did not know what to offer her, what he wished to say.</p>

  <p>He felt exhausted, not having eaten for several hours and not being able
  to touch food or drink in this house, and as he hesitated, she dropped to her
  knees with a wild and childish abandon and entreated him to leave her, never
  to think of her or her wretched companion again.</p>

  <p>"You follow me even in my dreams!" exclaimed Florio, raising her
  instantly. "How can I depart not knowing your destiny?"</p>

  <p>"It is nothing but evil," she answered, struggling in his arms as if to
  throw herself down again, while the dog whined in distress.</p>

  <p>"Your fancy is disordered, Letty," he answered, setting her on the couch.
  "You are ill&mdash;I must lend you the strength to overcome this weakness.
  Come. I have good friends in Palermo, will you see them?"</p>

  <p>"Friends?" she asked faintly.</p>

  <p>"I mean ladies, of good family."</p>

  <p>"As if any such would even look at me!"</p>

  <p>"I said friends, Letty. If I leave you now will you promise me to see them
  to-morrow and to take their advice?"</p>

  <p>She was relieved by this, only anxious, as he perceived, to be rid of him.
  Fearing to provoke in her some fit of nervous derangement he resolved to
  depart, to have the mansion watched, though he did not expect Philip Calamy
  to escape without his fee, and to take up this strange situation on the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>Pulling out his notebook he wrote on a page his address in Palermo and the
  name of his host, still hoping that Letty might turn to him before he came
  again to her, and put the torn out paper in her hot hand.</p>

  <p>In the passage Florio found Bonino, and told him to hire men to keep a
  guard on the house that no one went out without being followed.</p>

  <p>"It is a wretched establishment," murmured the servant as they stepped
  into the livid scorched night. "No woman at all, only the black slave. The
  so-called Monsieur Désiré has fled."</p>

  <p>"Where is <i>he,</i> Philip Calamy, now? While I was with Mrs.
  Winslow?"</p>

  <p>Bonino did not know.</p>

  <p>"Everything seems distorted and malign to me," said Florio.</p>

  <p>"Would that you could say, sir, 'Good-day, Madam, and luck go with you,'"
  murmured the servant.</p>

  <p>"I cannot," replied Florio simply. "I must linger over her fortunes,
  though she requires nothing from me, save, perhaps, money for her scoundrel
  partner. She is so impassive, Bonino, amid the surge of ugly passions in
  which she lives&mdash;a decoy indeed, like one of those miserable birds who,
  helpless in the net, attract other victims."</p>

  <p>"What is the Englishman's humour?" asked Bonino.</p>

  <p>"Braggadocio, and, I think, beneath, despair. He feels himself so totally
  lost that he cares about very little. Then part of his nature is satisfied
  with these crazy and sordid mountebank tricks."</p>

  <p>Even to Bonino Florio could not speak of Philip Calamy's intention to rid
  himself of Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>The Giandola family had long retired when he returned to the Conca d'oro
  and the porter, who admitted him, had to be awakened.</p>

  <p>Bonino prepared his master a light supper. He declared that it was a
  needless precaution to watch the Villa Vizzavona since he had already, while
  Florio was with Letty, found the Florentine (who had not gone far) and warned
  him to keep an eye on the Russian. This the fellow had readily agreed to do.
  He was prepared to regard the Russian as but another of the suspicious
  characters in the underworld of Palermo, to spy on him, and to lay any
  information against him if he could find any advantage to himself by so
  doing.</p>

  <p>Florio agreed that he had been over anxious in this respect, indeed quite
  at a loss.</p>

  <p>He repeated that "quite at a loss" and told Bonino that never before had
  he met, or thought to meet, a situation that so outwitted him as that he had
  found in the Villa Vizzavona had outwitted him.</p>

  <p>If, he argued, there had been any scene of drama, of reproach or anguish,
  he could have faced it and dealt with it, but the man's reckless cynicism, so
  casually expressed, and the woman's meek acquiescence in her dreadful fate,
  the acceptance of both of them, of their bitter exile and foul degradation,
  it was this that had left Florio helpless.</p>

  <p>He could not find any way out of the mental and emotional impasse in which
  he found himself, could not discover by what means he could save Letty, nor
  even disentangle his own emotions.</p>

  <p>As far as he could get was a resolve to ask the advice of Donna Angelica,
  the eldest of his host's relatives and one who seemed to him wise and kind.
  And then he dismissed the weary and anxious Bonino, drew his curtains, and
  tried to sleep.</p>

  <p>But within half an hour he was awake, and pacing the marble floor,
  contending with unsolved problems. When he could no longer support his
  anxieties that increased with his weakness and the weight of the darkness and
  the silence, he sank on his bed, and fell into a swoonlike slumber of
  fatigue.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32"></a>§ 32</h2>

  <p class="first">When Florio woke he lay awhile quiet, his mind a blank, and it was only
  slowly that the events of the preceding day recalled themselves, at first in
  a series of lifeless pictures, to his consciousness.</p>

  <p>Then he rose, looked at the clock and perceived the day to be well
  advanced.</p>

  <p>Probably Bonino had put about some story of indisposition and left him
  undisturbed.</p>

  <p>He gazed at himself in the mirror and was irritated by his pallid, heavy
  look. Adjusting his clothes, in which he had slept, he pulled the curtains
  apart and glanced at the gardens entranced in the heat. The air seemed to
  throb as with invisible flames, as if unseen lightning flashed behind the
  cypress trees and the dim grey-green foliage of the ilex.</p>

  <p>He was relieved that he had almost forgotten his dreams, for he remembered
  sufficient of them to know that they had been filled with fearful images that
  he had regarded with apprehension.</p>

  <p>Feeling still exhausted, for his slumber had brought him but little
  refreshment, he pulled the bell and when Bonino came asked him to prepare the
  bath and to make his excuses to his host, the Duke Biago Giandola.</p>

  <p>The servant brought him a breakfast of milk, perfumed oranges, olives,
  fine bread and a crystal cup containing some late roses of a crimson that was
  almost purple in the folds of the petals and with the spicy odour of
  cloves.</p>

  <p>Florio made his toilet, ate his breakfast and felt no inclination to do
  anything, not even to interview the sympathetic Donna Angelica.</p>

  <p>"This," he told himself, "is the lethargy of a man who has endured an
  enormous disappointment, added to a natural indolence and long fatigues."</p>

  <p>He could not conceive of any concise ending to the story of the English
  couple.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him as if Philip Calamy would continue to wander aimlessly
  from city to city, cheating, masquerading, falling deeper and deeper into
  self contempt. Letty dragging out what remained of her life as his despised
  companion and slave.</p>

  <p>For Letty must go with him, that much was clear. If Philip Calamy would be
  rid of her for money, he must be obliged to take money to keep her, on no
  other terms would Florio help him.</p>

  <p>Yet, what a poor solace to his own pride and sense of power, that he,
  Florio San Quirico, must bribe this wretch to keep his miserable mistress in
  her most degraded existence.</p>

  <p>But since she would not leave him&mdash;what other way?</p>

  <p>Florio wondered sadly if Donna Angelica's feminine tenderness could think
  of any device to separate Letty from her evil protector, and induce her to
  pass into some retreat from which she might emerge to a new life.</p>

  <p>Florio's mind baulked here&mdash;there was no new life possible for such
  as Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>Thwarted in her natural desires, checked, blocked, thrown out of the only
  society to which she was suited, this woman could not, by any means that
  Florio could imagine, be now redeemed.</p>

  <p>Her sorrows, unvoiced and unshared, of which she made no complaint,
  weighed oppressively on Florio, and he began to fear a return of the fever
  that had made him useless at Wilhelmsruhe.</p>

  <p>At this point when he feared a failing of all his powers and could do no
  more than languidly calculate what sums he had with him for the immediate
  relief of Philip Calamy&mdash;for only by money could he hold him and only
  through holding him could he help Letty&mdash;an incident occurred that was
  of all things the most unforeseen and unexpected. Bonino entered to inform
  him, with a hardly disguised agitation, that Mrs. Winslow had arrived at the
  Villa Giandola and asked to see Prince San Quirico.</p>

  <p>Florio had forgotten that he had given her his address&mdash;the events of
  yesterday were so confused and unreal to him as the fragments of the uneasy
  dreams that still kept troubling his mind.</p>

  <p>His first emotion was one of pleasure. "Ah, she has resolved to leave that
  scoundrel!" Then&mdash;"What shall I do with her?"</p>

  <p>But there was no time for speculation. Roused from his apathy, Florio told
  Bonino to go to the lady, offer her refreshment, and say that he would wait
  on her immediately.</p>

  <p>Then, when the servant had departed, he reflected that this action of
  Letty was out of character; this was the first time he had known her
  undertake any independent action&mdash;but was it this? Perhaps she had been
  sent by Philip Calamy to bargain over her own pride, and in a deadly
  compliance had obeyed.</p>

  <p>This possibility unnerved Florio. He thought of Letty as of someone who
  had received an injury of spirit as disfiguring as a maiming of the body, and
  shrank from seeing her, yet hastened to the cool room where she waited.</p>

  <p>The Giandola ladies, being in the garden, had seen Letty Winslow under the
  guidance of the porter enter the Villa house, and had gone forward to receive
  her and been told by the man that the stranger had inquired for Florio San
  Quirico.</p>

  <p>Delicacy and a sensitive courtesy prompted them to suppress curiosity and
  the desire to set this visitor at her ease. They perceived that she was a
  foreigner, poor and well bred. Her clothes were old, a cotton mantilla shaded
  her from the sultry glare and she was alone. Her poverty then was shocking,
  and the ladies sensed some pitiful tragedy behind this mean appearance, this
  gentle air, and such an unheard of breaking of the conventions as a visit,
  unescorted, to a gentleman. They perceived also, and with a romantic pain,
  that here was the reason of Florio's tender melancholy, as they named his
  abstraction, and this lady surely the cause of grave concern to him.</p>

  <p>But they hesitated to go in to her because this might seem like an
  intrusion, although they were desirous of nothing but offering kindness and,
  if need be, protection. Florio, traversing the passage that led to the room
  where Bonino had told him Letty waited, saw the ladies together in the garden
  as he looked from the uncurtained window shaded by vine leaves, and guessed
  their purpose in their withdrawal.</p>

  <p>He wished now that he had confided in them, or, at least, in Donna
  Angelica.</p>

  <p>Letty rose to receive him as he entered and he saw at once that she was
  much changed since yesterday. Though haggard and wan in the full stream of
  golden light in which she stood, she now had vigour and purpose.</p>

  <p>He immediately supposed that, in a flash of energy, she had fallen on, and
  perhaps worked out, some plan for her own deliverance. Her first words came
  to him as a shocking surprise.</p>

  <p>"Philip is ill, and I have come to you as there is no one else."</p>

  <p>Florio knew then that Letty depended absolutely on Philip and that no one
  was of any importance to her save in as far as they could serve him.</p>

  <p>He took her by the shoulders, for she was ready to fall, and placed her in
  a chair. For the second that he had supported her she had seemed as light as
  a half-starved bird.</p>

  <p>"I shall come with you at once," he said, "or, if you would rather, rest
  here."</p>

  <p>"O, no. I could not&mdash;I must return at once, and if you could find
  some physician..."</p>

  <p>"Surely. Do not concern yourself so terribly, Letty&mdash;this will be
  some usual illness. There is no sign of the plague?"</p>

  <p>Again she shook her head, murmuring: "O, no&mdash;it is a fit; he fell
  down as if struck. Pray, let us go, there is no one with him save the
  negro."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Florio, pulling at the bell. "I shall go and take every
  help, but if only you would rest here a little, at least during the heat of
  the day&mdash;my friends..."</p>

  <p>"I saw them, as I passed across the garden&mdash;ladies&mdash;I must not
  meet them."</p>

  <p>"As you please. Do not tremble so. Philip is young and strong."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Florio wondered what could have thus overthrown a man in the
  prime of his life and powers. "It was the letter."</p>

  <p>She rose as she spoke, and looked anxiously at the door. "Cannot we go at
  once? And perhaps in a carriage. I came on foot and the way seemed so
  long."</p>

  <p>"It is long, and you are exhausted. I regret that I slept late to-day or I
  should have been early at the Villa Vizzavona and saved you this distress.
  Now I must leave you for a moment&mdash;a moment only&mdash;and speak to my
  friends. The letter you said? A letter thus overwhelmed him?"</p>

  <p>Before Letty could answer, Bonino entered and Florio stayed his
  conjectures to bid the servant ask for a carriage at once, while he, again
  delicately setting Letty in the chair, went out to the ladies in the
  garden.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for him to tell them the truth. He knew that they would
  not expect this. He informed them that the woman they must have seen had come
  to take him on an errand of compassion. That he had known her and her
  companion for a long time and that they were bred in gentility though now in
  poverty.</p>

  <p>He asked for a carriage, and the address of a physician&mdash;said it was
  a question of illness that he must visit, but that if it was a case of
  contagion, he would not return but remain in the infected house.</p>

  <p>Donna Angelica answered for the ladies, and, she was sure, for the young
  Duke, her nephew.</p>

  <p>She offered, without faltering, all that they had, beginning with service,
  and begged that she might go in to the stranger and console her and offer her
  refreshment.</p>

  <p>"I thank you for your graciousness," said Florio. "But she is distracted
  and not able to consider anything but a return to her friend."</p>

  <p>"Then we must not put any impediment in her way. Hasten, my dear Florio,
  and send us a message as to how we can be of use."</p>

  <p>One of the other ladies then begged him to take care of contagion, for
  though the summer had passed without the plague appearing in Palermo, yet
  there might still be some dread on this score.</p>

  <p>"There is no fear," said Florio, recalling what Letty had said and that he
  had hardly noticed at the time. "This is some fit or seizure, brought on by
  shock."</p>

  <p>Donna Angelica then, seeing that he had but one wish, to be gone, gave him
  the names of several physicians in Palermo, and hastened into the house; her
  companions followed her, each pressing Florio's hand as she passed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33"></a>§ 33</h2>

  <p class="first">In the carriage Letty recovered something of her spirits; her strong
  reason had inspired her to a strong action, but this had meant an effort
  foreign to her nature&mdash;the long walk in the torrid heat had shaken her,
  so had the seeking of Florio among strangers. She was entirely unused to any
  kind of independence. Florio saw that she was relying on him now that Philip
  was incapable of playing the master.</p>

  <p>As they drove along the roads covered with yellow dust, under the golden
  cliff, the sky darkened to a livid purple and the lightnings that had for
  long been vibrating in the air became visible in darts of bluish white, like
  jagged cracks in the firmament, while the thunder rolled seawards.</p>

  <p>Letty readily told the story of Philip's illness, speaking English, not
  only because she still halted in Italian, but because of Bonino and the
  coachman beside him on the box.</p>

  <p>"I could not sleep last night," she explained. "I knew that we must move
  again and I was troubled, wondering what would become of us. I knew I must
  return you the dresses we had taken from Chiaramonte, and I sat up making a
  list, here it is." She searched in her pocket and drew a paper out. "Two blue
  rich feathers, sewn with pearls; a pair of gauntlets made out of stag's
  leather; a scarlet hat band; a pair of crimson silk hose; silk and silver
  garters, roses and gloves."</p>

  <p>"Don't, Letty, pray don't. You astonish me. What care I for these trifles?
  What was this news that Philip received? Some communication from the police,
  hurtful to his pride?"</p>

  <p>"It was a letter from England."</p>

  <p>"From your husband?"</p>

  <p>"No. It was from Captain Giles, and I do not know more than that. I did
  not see Philip last night. When I came down this morning, the negro told me
  that his master had gone out early&mdash;oh, how close that flash of
  lightning seemed!"</p>

  <p>"Lean closer back under the hood, Letty. Yes, speak to me and find a
  release from your cares in speaking."</p>

  <p>"While I was in the <i>salon</i> this morning not knowing what to do,
  Philip came in. I could see that he was not in a pleasant humour. He asked if
  you had come or sent, and said that there was a letter from Lennard Giles, at
  last, and that he felt too disgusted with life to break the seals, for there
  was never anything in these letters but the news he most loathed to hear,
  namely that my husband was still alive."</p>

  <p>She shrank as she spoke, as if at the remembrance of violence, and Florio
  felt his anger rise against himself, he should have been round early at the
  Palazzo Vizzavona and present at this scene.</p>

  <p>"Then I noticed," continued Letty, "that the packet seemed heavy. I
  thought perhaps here were some bills and monies, to help us, after our
  fatigues and expenses, and I said so, but Philip rebuked me, saying sternly
  he had nothing in the world to come from England."</p>

  <p>"What, then, was in the letter?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. He opened it, read it, and another that was in it, read
  them over twice, looked at me, ghastly, seemed to try to curse me, and fell
  down. He struck his head, and bled. I called the negro, and came for you. I
  have no credit anywhere in Palermo&mdash;Monsieur Désiré has gone."</p>

  <p>"Did you not read the letters?"</p>

  <p>"I never thought of it. I was too terrified for him, they were clutched in
  his hand. You cannot think how frightful it was to see him fall! I have never
  known the least weakness in him."</p>

  <p>Florio saw that she spoke the truth, childishly and without compulsion.
  She trusted him, but merely because she wanted his help. Personally he was
  nothing to her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she added, "Philip will be conscious, and angry at seeing you,
  Prince."</p>

  <p>"I do not think so," replied Florio quietly. "He asked my help yesterday
  and was waiting for it."</p>

  <p>And he thought, if the Englishman was to die now or never recover his
  senses, she need never know that he wanted to be rid of her, poor, sad
  creature.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34"></a>§ 34</h2>

  <p class="first">Donna Angelica had contrived, in the few minutes she had, to put a basket
  of provisions, wine, medicine, and fruit, into the carriage. Bonino carried
  these into the house of the Villa Vizzavona, that in the livid light of the
  stormy day and against the sombre heavens, constantly crackling with forked
  lightning, looked far more shabby than it had appeared to be the night
  before, and little better than the neglected mansions in the vicinity.</p>

  <p>The dog was waiting behind the front door. Letty had left him in charge of
  the solitary house, but he had no thought save for his mistress, and
  approached her with an extravagant delight that included an acknowledgment of
  Florio, whom he now accepted with confidence and joy.</p>

  <p>Florio entered the salon with a feeling of relief that definite action was
  required of him, and his problem as how to deal with the English couple,
  solved by outside events.</p>

  <p>Whatever the news from England that had felled Philip Calamy, he, Florio
  San Quirico, would be equal to facing it, and it was with his habitual
  serenity that he advanced across the room to the couch where the Englishman
  lay.</p>

  <p>There was no daylight in the room, for the shutters had been nailed across
  the windows for the sake of theatrical effect. The lamps and candles that had
  given the artful illumination of the night before were extinguished, and only
  the cheap brass lamp, that Florio had seen in Letty's room, lit the
  scene.</p>

  <p>Philip wore ordinary clothes, worn and mended. His coat was folded under
  his head for a pillow and his shirt open at the neck. Across his brow was a
  bandage.</p>

  <p>The negro sat at the foot of the couch. He, too, had put off his finery of
  Roman stripes, and wore a miserable livery of faded green. He had a bowl of
  slop on his crouched knees, and rolled his eyes in terror as the thunder
  rumbled without.</p>

  <p>Philip was conscious. A sarcastic smile moved his lips as he saw Florio
  and Letty advancing out of the shadows. If she had changed through his
  unexpected overthrow, something, Florio at once perceived, had changed him He
  had lost his indifference, his cynical resignation, and was now wild,
  passionate and hardly controlled.</p>

  <p>"So, Letty fled to <i>you</i> for help," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"You being ill, I must take charge of your fortunes," replied Florio. "I
  believe that you have no one else."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," whispered the Englishman. "I am now as important, as
  wealthy and as influential as you are."</p>

  <p>Florio supposed that he was in a delirium and, going to the couch, looked
  at him keenly.</p>

  <p>But Philip Calamy, though he appeared pallid and exhausted, was not in a
  fever; he had no signs on him of the plague or any sickness.</p>

  <p>Raising himself on his elbow, he smiled fixedly at Florio. His air and his
  tone, always haughty behind all his social complacency, were now of an
  imperiousness he hardly tried to restrain.</p>

  <p>"The excitement of your visit, my dear fellow," he said, "the heat and the
  news that I received from England struck me down, and I injured my head. If
  Letty were not such a fool she would have seen the case and not gone running
  of to you."</p>

  <p>"Yet I think you were much shaken," said Florio. "What do you mean by
  speaking, in this place, of your wealth and importance?"</p>

  <p>"That they equal yours," replied Philip Calamy, fiercely. "As for this
  place, I shall soon leave it. And now, by God, there will be no need for any
  more masks."</p>

  <p>"You are raving, surely," sighed Letty. "Do, pray, let us send for a
  physician."</p>

  <p>The Englishman interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I need none, but some one to take my orders. Has that rogue, Désiré,
  left? This black cerberus is useless. Letty, have you sense to have a note
  delivered to Mr. Harte, the English Resident?"</p>

  <p>"He is out of his mind," sighed Letty. "M. Harte was the man who, of all
  others, he avoided. Philip, we have only false passports."</p>

  <p>"That will not matter," he answered brusquely. "The Resident will do what
  I please. First, I must get out of this accursed place." He glanced at Florio
  with a flare of mockery. "Perhaps you will send a letter for me to the
  Resident? Find some one who will step out briskly and despatch my
  business?"</p>

  <p>"I may do so, if you will inform me what this business is."</p>

  <p>Philip Calamy put his hand under the cloak that served for his pillow and
  drew out a package with broken seals.</p>

  <p>"My uncle and my cousins are dead," he said. "And I am the sole heir. Two
  of them drowned when a boat upset on a Scots lake and Henry&mdash;who I did
  not even know was in the army&mdash;shot through the head&mdash;a lieutenant
  in the Ninety-second Foot."</p>

  <p>"You are sure of this?" asked Florio, astounded. "Read these letters." And
  Philip Calamy handed them over with a steady hand.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Letty, and repose," said Florio, noticing that she was weeping
  quietly. "You see that your companion is in no danger."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what this means?" she asked, sinking into one of the chairs
  by the gaming table.</p>

  <p>"No, he does not," said Philip. "Let him read the letters. Since he will
  interfere in my affairs, let him bear the brunt of them."</p>

  <p>Florio drew the small lamp nearer to the seat at the end of the couch. The
  bulk of the papers were copies of legal documents, and with them was a
  lawyer's letter. Florio at once understood that Philip Calamy had spoken the
  truth. He had inherited a sumptuous fortune and several titles, of which the
  highest was an English Earldom. Enclosed with these papers was a letter from
  Lennard Giles.</p>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR PHILIP,<br>
  <br>
  "I am asked to send you these. No one knows your whereabouts. The news will
  be stale by the time you receive it. Of course you must return at once. The
  lawyers want you to take up your inheritance, and all the stewards await your
  instructions. I've asked them to enclose a draught for a thousand guineas.
  Fortune's not such a bad jade, eh? This wipes out everything. Lord
  Mountsellis will be <i>persona grata</i> in even strict society. Come home
  and enjoy your luck.<br>
  <br>
  "Your faithful<br>
  "LENNARD.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Post Scriptum.</i> Colonel Winslow continues his pistol practise and is
  considered the finest marksman in the country, another reason for your
  immediate return. L.G."</p>

  <p>Florio folded up the letters.</p>

  <p>The other man's dilemma caused him to shiver. He could see the
  complications of this frightful news, and why it had felled Philip
  Calamy.</p>

  <p>"Will you return?" he asked directly.</p>

  <p>"Presently," returned the Englishman, rising from the couch. "There is no
  hurry. I must establish myself with Harte. Well, San Quirico, you never
  expected this, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I knew that you were a man of rank, Lord Mountsellis."</p>

  <p>The Earl smiled at hearing his title.</p>

  <p>"It means money, power, everything that I have ever wanted&mdash;there are
  a few scores to pay off, too. Life is worth while when one is rich. My uncle
  was careful, too, the estates are all flourishing."</p>

  <p>"But the <i>post scriptum,"</i> said Florio. "You must face that at once.
  For years you have been hiding from Colonel Winslow."</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis glanced round in a sharp fury.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose that old man will prevent me from claiming my inheritance?
  Damn Giles for mentioning him."</p>

  <p>Letty raised her face from her hands.</p>

  <p>"There may be a welcome home for you," she said. "There will be none for
  me."</p>

  <p>"You will be provided for," replied the Englishman, coolly. His glance
  went from point to point in the dark room&mdash;the dim figure of Letty in
  her shabby clothes, the stupid face of the negro, who understood nothing of
  what was being said, Florio who appeared serene and self assured.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was sultry, charged with electricity.</p>

  <p>"Let us get into the fresh air," said Lord Mountsellis.</p>

  <p>"There is none to-day," repined Florio. "There is a storm over Palermo.
  You need rest, my lord, and perhaps solitude."</p>

  <p>He looked at Letty, her shoulders sagged and she had again buried her face
  in her hands. A long lock of red hair straggled over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>Beneath his mannered calm Florio felt his nerves relax. The difficulty of
  a decision was no longer his, and in that was relief.</p>

  <p>But this twist to the story of the eloping couple was monstrous, almost
  intolerable. It doomed Letty Winslow. No longer would it be possible for any
  bribe to be offered to Philip Calamy, Lord Mountsellis, to induce him to keep
  Letty as his companion.</p>

  <p>He would probably part with her at once, in order to be rid, as soon as
  possible, of the scandal attaching to her presence.</p>

  <p>"Will you return to Chiaramonte, Mrs. Winslow?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He could not offer the Villa Giandola, his friends' house, after this
  gambling episode, nor would Letty, he thought, face women of her own
  rank.</p>

  <p>"So you make no move to have my note delivered?" demanded Lord
  Mountsellis. "You posed as a friend, you know, my dear fellow. Very well, I
  can contrive myself. I still have a little money&mdash;though the gold you
  saw last night is tinfoil."</p>

  <p>He continued to talk, excitedly, pacing up and down. He had forced into
  oblivion the postscript of Lennard Giles' letter and dwelt solely on his
  immense good fortune. He spoke harshly, stridently, like an actor hurrying
  over the words of a part before he has troubled to put any expression into
  them, and Florio understood from what he said, more of his past life than he
  had ever realized before.</p>

  <p>It was confusing to watch his swift movement with his arms folded. Florio
  felt that one or both of them must be racked by fever.</p>

  <p>Everything in the room seemed unreal, the stage from which the tattered
  curtain had been dragged aside, was full of darkness in which the painted
  pine trees of the background were barely visible.</p>

  <p>Florio made an effort of will to retain command of the situation. He went
  up to Letty who raised her face that was red with weeping and distorted like
  a child that has been hurt.</p>

  <p>"Now he will leave me," she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"No," said Florio clearly. "He could not leave you without a scandal."</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis paused at that and remarked: "I am no longer afraid of
  scandals."</p>

  <p>"You boast," returned Florio. "I could make it impossible for you to
  remain in Italy."</p>

  <p>"No," the Englishman smiled. "I think not, I am now able to go above your
  head, my dear fellow. But let us be reasonable. I need to let my good fortune
  sink in. I have talked too much, and that accursed blow, the truth is I've
  been profoundly shocked&mdash;yes, nothing could have been more unexpected.
  As for Winslow, he would never touch a man of my rank."</p>

  <p>He was close to Florio and stared at him with a harrowing fixity of
  gaze.</p>

  <p>"Allow her to go to Chiaramonte until you have settled your plans."</p>

  <p>"I shall not let him out of my sight," whispered Letty.</p>

  <p>"You hear that? Had you not better leave us? It is true that I intended to
  borrow money of you, but now I don't need it. Pray leave us, my dear Prince,"
  he added incisively. "And recall that in certain moods a man is capable of
  anything."</p>

  <p>Softly, appealingly, Letty whispered: "Please leave us."</p>

  <p>"I'm no longer a damned mountebank," added Lord Mountsellis in a lower
  tone, with a look of menace.</p>

  <p>Florio felt a compassion for him that he knew to be absurd.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Winslow asked me to come," he said, "and now she asks me to leave. I
  shall be staying at the Villa Giandola as long as you are in Palermo."</p>

  <p>"My head is aching," said the Englishman, casting himself on the couch.
  "Come here, Letty, and take oft this bandage."</p>

  <p>She rose at once, and Florio left them.</p>

  <p>Bonino was waiting in the carriage. No rain had fallen, the deep purple
  clouds shot with lightning, being over the towers and domes of Palermo that
  glittered in the lurid glow of sulphureous yellow in the sky. The plants,
  dark, thick and sharp edged, rustled together in the dry, hot breeze.</p>

  <p>Florio entered the carriage, drawing round him his thin summer cloak.
  Anxieties were on him in a dark cloud. For all his cool exterior he felt as
  if the least provocation would make him weep. What had happened was fantastic
  and extremely important. He felt a premonition of tragedy, his senses and his
  reason were in revolt, his inner life, that for so long had centred round the
  English couple, had been shaken; the focus of his being jarred out of place.
  He would need time to adjust himself to his new situation.</p>

  <p>One poignant fact alone was clear, there was now not the slightest hope of
  bribing the Englishman to keep his companion with him.</p>

  <p>Florio could not imagine under what excuse or by what means Philip Calamy
  could be rid of her, indeed the Englishman's dilemma seemed, to the Italian,
  so acute that he half supposed that he would not return home but remain in
  exile, his fortune being sent out to him.</p>

  <p>Here Florio admitted to himself that ignorance of English customs hampered
  his judgment of the case. He did not know to what extent his inheritance of
  rank and wealth would reinstate him in the society from which he had fled,
  loaded with debt and with another man's wife&mdash;the wife of a senior
  officer of the same regiment, a fact that, according to Letty, made his
  offence unforgivable.</p>

  <p>The friend, this Captain Giles, had added a warning about Colonel Winslow;
  Florio supposed that murder or a duel was hinted at, and that the new Lord
  Mountsellis's honour would be reflected on if he evaded that issue. But it
  was starkly clear to Florio that the man who, in masks and disguises, had
  turned and twisted before his enemy across Europe, valued his life far more
  highly than his honour, that, indeed, he might be held to have long since
  forfeited. And Florio recalled, with a cold pang, the Englishman's
  confession, so insolently made, that he had eloped with Letty Winslow because
  of a bet and paid for the Bologna days on the profit of it.</p>

  <p>Florio thought: "These two have ceased to provide me with entertainment. I
  am now involved with them, I cannot shake them off and return to my former
  life. My fluctuations of sentiments are over, I no longer regard them as
  romantic abstractions and bandy to and fro my notions of them in my day
  dreaming, keeping myself remote and cool. They have now become for me human
  beings, not actors in an <i>opera bouffe.</i> Letty's degradation has made
  her real to me as never before."</p>

  <p>This realization came to Florio with a thrill of pleasure and
  apprehension; he both welcomed and feared the strong emotion that, for the
  first time in his life, was taking possession of his heart.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him hardly possible that Letty, who had now so little to
  offer anyone, and that little all had bestowed with a very despair of
  constancy on another, should arouse in him, fastidious as he was, the spring
  of a pure love.</p>

  <p>Yet so he felt it to be, in the tenderness in which he dwelt on her
  helpless ruin.</p>

  <p>So deep was this experience, that seemed to Florio of the spirit, that for
  all his resolve to shake himself free of day dreaming, he gave no heed to
  outward events, nor made any effort to trace the fortunes of the English
  couple, but getting through his life at the Villa Giandola like an automaton,
  allowed the autumn days to pass, like revolving wheels of gold and purple,
  drawing time into eternity.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35"></a>§ 35</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio was roused by a letter from Lord Mountsellis delivered at the Villa
  Giandola by a manservant in a trim, plain livery, civilly asking him to
  accept a simple hospitality in the Palazzo Carlentini near the Porta Felice,
  the time being that day, at the seventh hour.</p>

  <p>Florio returned an immediate reply. His surprised musings became ready to
  translate themselves into actions. He noticed with a quick interest the
  lodging of the Englishman. This palace was one of the most splendid and
  famous in Palermo. The family would not be in residence now, but it must have
  taken considerable influence to procure the admission of a foreigner to this
  haughty residence. Either the Englishman had worked another of his tricks or
  he had come into uncommon rank and fortune.</p>

  <p>Florio took leave of his kindly hosts, who had watched him with misgiving
  for the last few days, sensing that he was completely withdrawn from them
  behind his courtesies, and without even the attendance of Bonino went on foot
  towards the Porta Felice that, situate on the Marina, looked towards the
  sea.</p>

  <p>Never had Florio beheld Palermo so clearly; his imagination, self
  absorbed, had seen the city as a dream place, the mere drop cloth or
  background for his search. Now, that quest over, and his senses sharpened by
  his increasing emotion, he saw all sharply.</p>

  <p>The thunderous weather, rare in that climate, had passed, and with the
  waning of the year the exhausting heat was allayed. Thin clouds hid the sun
  and mild breezes blew across the narrow streets and wide piazzas; the domes
  and spires sparkled in a blue light.</p>

  <p>The entire city, in the natural amphitheatre at the foot of Monte
  Pellegrino, now appeared to deserve the name of "The Golden Shell;" the rich
  plain between the chain of mountains sending up a perfume from the orange and
  lemon orchards that lingered in the streets cleansed by the late persistency
  of the south-west wind.</p>

  <p>This balmy air and the brilliancy of the azure sky Florio noted keenly as
  he proceeded along the Toledo and the Cassaro, and when he was in sight of
  the gate with its sweet memories of a darling wife, Felice, he noted that
  also, dazzling behind the showers of the fountains below the white statues of
  Pomona and Pan. He observed the warm colour of the yellow stone, the crowned
  Eagle of Sicily, the arms of the families of Palermo and Colonna, and it
  seemed to him that it was the portal to some domain hitherto only visited in
  dreams.</p>

  <p>The Palazzo Carlentini he knew so well that it continued to surprise him
  that it should be a setting for the vagabond Englishman.</p>

  <p>It was a magnificent building in warm brown masonry with a grand and
  singular porch, where the stone pillars were trees, the clusters of foliage
  meeting in the centre of the arch, the whole twisted together by ropes of
  stone. Over the door was a crest, shield with seven swords bound within a
  thong and the Spanish motto <i>Manya y Fuerça,</i> craft and force. Ogee
  niches with statues of saints stood on either side of this grandiose door,
  and above monsters stared down from the corbels of the round-headed
  windows.</p>

  <p>Florio entered at once. The servants in attendance appeared to be waiting
  for him and he was at once shown into a <i>salon</i> on the ground floor
  where he found Lord Mountsellis and another Englishman who was presented to
  him by the former, as the British Resident to the King of Sicily, Mr. Charles
  Harte.</p>

  <p>Florio soon perceived why this personage was present, it was to assure him
  that Philip Calamy had indeed come into his kingdom, and was now so important
  a person in his own country that no former trespasses against the social code
  of his class would be remembered against him. Indeed the Resident, with the
  ease of a diplomat, spoke as if Captain Philip Calamy had been merely idling
  time away on the Continent when he became, through three most unexpected
  deaths, the Earl of Mountsellis.</p>

  <p>Florio listened civilly. He was pleased to have this information, to know
  exactly where he stood in regard to the Englishman.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harte made graceful allusion to the Prince Florio San Quirico who had
  entertained Lord Mountsellis so handsomely at Bologna and lent him his castle
  of Chiaramonte.</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis, through his, the Resident's influence, had obtained the
  use of this famous palace in Palermo and was now reposing there, buying
  curios and antiquities to be shipped to England when possible. Having been
  recently ill, he was living quietly, but in a costly fashion, the Bank having
  advanced him handsome sums.</p>

  <p>No mention was made of Letty Winslow.</p>

  <p>But for this Florio would have found the situation amusing.</p>

  <p>The Englishman had very quickly recovered health and spirits and was
  correctly dressed, except that his good looks would probably appear
  theatrical to his fellow countrymen. He now appeared, after so many
  disguises, what he was, and what Florio had always supposed he was, though
  his rank was higher than the Italian had guessed.</p>

  <p>His manner with the Resident was easy, even gay; they discussed common
  acquaintances and the London scene that both of them, exiled for several
  years, were likely to find changed.</p>

  <p>The <i>salon</i> was large, the walls encrusted with mosaics that
  glittered with the colours of peacocks and leopards on a golden ground,
  beneath bands of dappled blue and white marble. The pointed windows were hung
  with crimson damask. Lord Mountsellis sat at a table covered with a velvet
  cloth on which was a small white alabaster figure of a woman pierced with
  arrows, and a small golden ram.</p>

  <p>Florio considered him closely, against these bizarre surroundings he
  appeared sharply, in every detail, the English gentleman, exasperating in his
  deliberate self effacement that had in it so much of implacable pride.</p>

  <p>Only an inextinguishable wildness in his glance, and a movement over hasty
  as he turned about his toys before him, betrayed him as other than what he
  was supposed to be, a man happy in a magnificent turn of fortune.</p>

  <p>When the Resident had gone, he turned at once to Florio.</p>

  <p>"Now you have my credentials, now you will admit that I was not boasting
  when I declared that my position equalled your own."</p>

  <p>This was spoken quietly but Florio did not know if they were to meet as
  friends or enemies. Lord Mountsellis kept his glance turned on the golden ram
  that he held carefully.</p>

  <p>"You keep me long in suspense," said Florio. "Where is Letty?"</p>

  <p>"Safe, I assure you."</p>

  <p>"I hope you do not say that lightly. I have the ear of Prince Cuto, the
  Lord Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>"And would have me rebuked, if not apprehended, for any ill treatment of
  Letty?" replied the other instantly. "But you already forget the lesson I
  would have had you learn, Prince, from Mr. Harte; I am now an important
  subject of His Britannic Majesty and under his protection. The King of Sicily
  would not dare to meddle with me."</p>

  <p>"But I should&mdash;if Letty..."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, your chivalry is really misplaced&mdash;here is an
  extremely foolish and tiresome woman, without constancy..."</p>

  <p>"To you, sir, truly constant."</p>

  <p>"That is nothing, her liking goes with it, she could not be constant when
  virtue was difficult. She has little value. But I don't wish to dispute about
  her&mdash;I asked you to take her off my hands, but now the situation has
  changed. I don't need whatever you were prepared to pay for her, and, besides
  that, she won't go. Leave that&mdash;she is disposed of."</p>

  <p>"I demand to see her."</p>

  <p>"Why so you shall." Lord Mountsellis turned a sparkling look on the other.
  "See her and learn from her that she is satisfied. First I have some business
  with you. You think, perhaps, I should have waited on you, instead of
  summoning you here?"</p>

  <p>Florio was of too high a quality to have thought of this.</p>

  <p>"I came because of Letty Winslow," he replied.</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis had opened a drawer and taken out some papers. One of
  these he laid on the red velvet cover.</p>

  <p>"A bill for what I suppose I owe you, sir," he remarked. "If you are too
  proud to keep the money, you may give it to your begging priests."</p>

  <p>"I am not proud," smiled Florio. "And what I have spent on you you could
  never repay. I shall send my servant to collect the bill."</p>

  <p>The Englishman was staring at him steadily and Florio wondered why he
  prolonged the meeting. There seemed to be neither hostility nor malice in his
  glance, yet Florio could not think of him as other than an enemy.</p>

  <p>"When do you return to England?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I return at all? Is not Sicily a pleasant place with a
  delicious climate? Roses at every season&mdash;all luxuries at hand, horse
  races, the <i>festas,</i> palaces like this; with the money such as I have
  now at my command everything could be bought in Palermo."</p>

  <p>"Even forgetfulness of the past?"</p>

  <p>"My position is now such that even if any of my adventures were discovered
  they would pass as lively jests."</p>

  <p>"Do you not have to give up your position in your own country?"</p>

  <p>"If I chose to forego some advantages my return could be indefinitely
  delayed."</p>

  <p>"It can be little matter to me, one way or another, since I learned the
  truth of your connection with Letty Winslow, all my concern has been for
  her."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, you placed us in some ideal world&mdash;great lovers&mdash;'the
  world well lost for love' as the old play says. Well, was it ever so in life?
  Is it not merely a ranting of the poets? At least you know what it was with
  Letty and me, a matter of a bet."</p>

  <p>"No need to repeat that."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you move in a sickly twilight&mdash;there is no such thing as this
  ideal love."</p>

  <p>Florio was silent. He thought, "You mean that you know nothing of it," and
  rising he came to the table where the Englishman sat and put his shapely hand
  on the statue.</p>

  <p>"A pagan creature," he said. "Then struck with arrows and termed a saint.
  You have a pretty taste, Lord Mountsellis, and Palermo offers many delights
  to such as you, but you cannot remain here."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?"</p>

  <p>Florio was surprised by the earnestness of this question that the
  Englishman did not give him time to answer for, rising, he added:</p>

  <p>"I have written to Giles and other friends to learn the news of Colonel
  Winslow."</p>

  <p>"It was contained in the letter that you showed me&mdash;he practises at
  his shooting."</p>

  <p>"Bah! That might have been a tease, merely. Giles is dexterous at that.
  What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" Florio was surprised at this turn in the interview,
  he could have truthfully added: "How should I care?"</p>

  <p>"You saved me once, you know&mdash;turned him off my track, I shall never
  forget that."</p>

  <p>"I did not think of it as that&mdash;how long ago it seems!"</p>

  <p>"You helped me by lending me your castle, and with the passports and
  speaking to Prince Cuto for me."</p>

  <p>Florio disliked this urgency of speech and the manner in which the
  Englishman was now pacing the room, as he had paced up and down the morning
  he had received the letter from Lennard Giles.</p>

  <p>Now that he approached closer, Florio could see a square of silk plaster
  over the wound on his forehead that he had made when he fell, and this
  reminded him of the plaster mask this same man had worn when he affected to
  be Letty's servant.</p>

  <p>Florio's mind went back to those disguises, to Wilhelmsruhe and Nuremberg;
  he recalled the motto <i>craft and force</i> shamelessly flaunted in front of
  the palace where they now debated; he saw the little alabaster figure as an
  image of Letty, struck with arrows, fallen from any niche or pedestal,
  defenceless.</p>

  <p>And while he was busy with these symbols in the workings of his mind that
  were as needful to him as air, he saw with the same clarity with which he had
  observed the gorgeous city of Palermo when he had crossed it to this meeting,
  the details of the Englishman's appearance.</p>

  <p>He wore a plain dark coat buttoned closely up to the simple white linen
  stock folded round his neck; his thick hair was cut short, thus throwing into
  relief the noble lines of his face, that, with his pale wide brow and
  splendid eyes, comprised his astonishing good looks.</p>

  <p>It was a face that a sensual man might find a passport to any pleasure,
  but it bore no mark of sensuality. A cold care as to his health and
  appearance, an interest in intelligent stratagems and shifts, a certain
  natural firmness in his contours had left his handsome countenance without
  any of the flaws left by passion or fleshy self indulgence.</p>

  <p>Florio thought that the bare and undisguised face was in itself like a
  mask for the real man. But now it was plain that he was deeply moved as he
  passed in and out of the last ray of light falling through the ornate window.
  There was something terrible in the beautiful face set in the impassive lines
  that so easily twisted to mockery but that were not mocking now.</p>

  <p>Florio tried to withdraw his attention from what the man looked like to
  turn it on to what he said. But there was nothing new in the Englishman's
  words.</p>

  <p>He was merely exposing the very nerve of his dilemma. Should he remain in
  exile, living as an outcast (that was what his position would be, gild it as
  he might) or return to face the man from whom he had been hiding for
  years?</p>

  <p>"Stay here&mdash;your soft southern days!" said Florio. "What do you miss?
  As you said yourself, you can have your money sent here."</p>

  <p>"The money is not the hundredth part of it," said the Englishman harshly.
  "I am Mountsellis now. I have a position, friends, acquaintances. I can't be
  refused the court, or the clubs, or the army, by God, though it must be
  another regiment. I should be welcomed everywhere. An excellent <i>parti</i>
  you understand. No one is going to remember a few damned tradesmen's debts,
  paid by now, and a scrape with a married woman, against a man of my
  quality."</p>

  <p>"Except Colonel Winslow&mdash;he will remember."</p>

  <p>"I wonder. He must be sixty. Giles wrote in one of his letters that the
  old devil had had a slight stroke, bad luck that, as they retired him, if he
  had been sent to the continent a bullet might have stopped him."</p>

  <p>"Eh, well," said Florio, "old, sick, and his wrong some years ago, he may
  have turned philosopher."</p>

  <p>"But you know that he has not," interrupted the Earl, passionately. "You
  know that he is waiting for me and has been so waiting since I came into the
  title."</p>

  <p>"I do not so know. In Italy the affair would be settled gracefully."</p>

  <p>"You saw him. You are the only man to whom I can speak, Prince, who saw
  him. You know that he looked like murder."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it is some time ago."</p>

  <p>"Time has stopped with him. Come, San Quirico, help me in this infernal
  situation. You are a cool fellow. I'd do as much for you. As for this quirk
  you have about Letty, you know that I can't marry her, even if the old devil
  dies."</p>

  <p>"I understood that," smiled Florio.</p>

  <p>"It could not be expected. But what shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"Return in disguise, you are clever at that, put through your business
  secretly and return abroad."</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis stared across the room into which darkness had fallen
  with the sudden sinking of the sun, and said sternly:</p>

  <p>"I have to reveal myself. It is expected of me. If I don't face him I
  shall be branded as a coward."</p>

  <p>"But you have fled from him, hidden from him, during&mdash;what is
  it?&mdash;nearly four years."</p>

  <p>"Then I was nobody, but poor ruined Philip Calamy, now I am
  Mountsellis."</p>

  <p>"In your place these obligations would not concern me."</p>

  <p>"You have not been and never would be in my place."</p>

  <p>The Englishman paused, then broke out furiously:</p>

  <p>"Can't you understand that I <i>desire</i> what is awaiting me? The
  titles, the lands, the houses, some, pretty young wife, the children, the
  esteem, the respect."</p>

  <p>"Not yours, but paid to the place you hold."</p>

  <p>"What do I care? I want precisely what is <i>offered me</i>."</p>

  <p>"But you fear to go and take it."</p>

  <p>"Fear? I'm not yet thirty years of age&mdash;would you want to be killed,
  or perhaps maimed or blinded, after what is <i>offered me?"</i></p>

  <p>"I see your difficulty," said Florio. "But, sir, you have ceased to
  interest me very much. I can no longer help you. And I don't trust you."</p>

  <p>"You think of Chiaramonte and the dresses and finery&mdash;the price of
  them is in that bill."</p>

  <p>"I think of Letty Winslow and no one else, and of her price and who is to
  pay it."</p>

  <p>"You can."</p>

  <p>"What is not given me freely is nothing to me," smiled Florio.</p>

  <p>"Bah! I shall not begin to defend what I do. I have never done that." The
  Englishman was clearly impatient at being distracted from his own affairs, to
  which he reverted by adding: "My dear fellow, do pray inform me what this
  ruffian, Winslow, looked like. Did you judge him to be strong? Deeply
  inflamed?"</p>

  <p>Florio was astonished at this persistency.</p>

  <p>"I have already answered all these questions," he replied. "I could tell
  you no more if you were my best friend. Colonel Winslow, who by no means
  seemed to me a ruffian, was certainly deeply moved. When he had left, after I
  had put him on the wrong road, I remarked to my body servant that he seemed
  primed for murder&mdash;or some such comment."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Lord Mountsellis on a painful breath, pausing by the
  window and looking out on to the purple dark of the evening. "But possibly
  this virulent hatred has lessened."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. The unhappy man has had a stroke of apoplexy, you say. Time has
  passed, yet you say that there is no time in his vengeance. There are his
  children to remind him of his wrong. And from what you tell of the austere
  rules of your society, I do not see that it can hold both Colonel Winslow and
  Lord Mountsellis."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, you think that I should return home and expect a
  challenge from this man the moment that I set foot in Dover?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so." Florio lightly shrugged. "Even so, Colonel Winslow might
  fall by your hand."</p>

  <p>"That would not save me. If I killed him it would be murder and I should
  have to stand trial or fly abroad again. Even if one, or both of us, were
  badly wounded, the scandal would be overwhelming."</p>

  <p>"You have considered all possible ill luck," said Florio curiously. "What
  would you desire to happen?"</p>

  <p>"I would desire Colonel Winslow to behave like a man of the world and
  content himself with a divorce action&mdash;if he must&mdash;but as he is not
  likely to want to marry again, I don't see the need of that."</p>

  <p>The Englishman spoke with a readiness astonishing to Florio, who regarded
  him then, on an impulse of detestation, as a creature utterly worthless and
  hollow, a sentiment increased by Lord Mountsellis's next comment on his
  fantastic situation.</p>

  <p>"By God, Letty ought to be dead or in a convent&mdash;with her whims and
  tears and sickly qualms. If she were dead, Winslow would have the less cause
  of complaint."</p>

  <p>Florio, controlling himself, agreed quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Letty would be better dead, it would be more decorous, would it not?
  and set you free from a miserable tangle. But Letty is not dead, and you can
  in no wise evade this responsibility."</p>

  <p>"You endeavour to remind me of a promise I made to you once? She is
  intractable. I have offered her a settlement, the choice of another
  protector, but I have no leisure for her extreme nicety."</p>

  <p>"Tell me where I may speak with her," asked Florio coldly.</p>

  <p>"First conclude this discussion. I like you, San Quirico, upon my soul I
  do, and if you do not wish to be burdened in my affairs you should never have
  meddled in them," he added with a menacing look. "<i>I</i> did not ask you,
  or expect you, to follow me from Bologna. You must pay for enjoying a sense
  of power over my misfortunes, and a high flown attraction for the insipid
  Letty."</p>

  <p>"I have no advice to give," said Florio. "Why did you not ask your
  countryman, Mr. Harte, what you should do?"</p>

  <p>"Here I have been answered," replied the Englishman, sombrely. "Without
  any discussion of my case, he took it as beyond cavil that I should return to
  England."</p>

  <p>His low drawn brows and compressed lips showed that he was excessively
  vexed; the deceptive appearance of languor that he had shown earlier in the
  evening had vanished, he looked energetic and alert.</p>

  <p>Florio wished to leave him, but, despite his mental fatigue, would not do
  so without some certain news of Letty.</p>

  <p>Disguising all signs of the nervous fret that he felt, he held himself in
  check, his iron firmness hidden by his easy air.</p>

  <p>Glancing at him with peculiar malice, the Englishman pulled the satin bell
  strip and when the walnut door was almost instantly opened, asked, in
  English, for lights.</p>

  <p>The newcomer had a lamp, shaped like a foot of alabaster, in her hand; a
  small flame floated on the oil cast a wavering light over her menial dress of
  grey cotton, her coarse white kerchief and apron.</p>

  <p>Florio glanced at her, surprised that they should be waited upon by a
  woman. In a palace of this magnificence, female servants seldom left the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>He saw that it was Letty, lit by the flickering flame that cast a small
  halo of darkness in the large grand room, her red hair hidden by the frill of
  a white cap.</p>

  <p>"Here she is," said the Englishman briskly. "Since she will not leave me,
  there is no other expedient that will not expose her to be made a talk
  of."</p>

  <p>"So she is sent to the kitchens," murmured Florio, approaching her where
  she had set down the lamp on a console table, as if not having the strength
  to carry it farther.</p>

  <p>"The only place where she can be safe," remarked Lord Mountsellis. "She
  knows sufficient Italian to pass for a native of the mainland in a Sicilian
  household, and she is in the charge of some wary and discreet old women.
  Come, speak to her, it was arranged that she should enter when I pulled the
  bell. My dear Letty, look up, say your mind and have done with puling."</p>

  <p>"Can you endure this last masquerade, Mrs. Winslow?" asked Florio, taking
  her thin hand closely in his.</p>

  <p>She looked at him earnestly across the lamp flame, as if she conned more
  seriously than ever before his face, sweet and serious, framed in his
  warm-coloured hair, his topaz tinted eyes turned on her with a searching
  gaze, his generous mouth set in the constriction of pain.</p>

  <p>"It seems grotesque and pitiful," she whispered. "But I cannot be turned
  into the streets, and here I am no cause of scandal."</p>

  <p>"Not yet, not yet," interrupted Lord Mountsellis impatiently. "This is all
  I could contrive for the moment. Now pray explain yourself, my dear Letty, to
  Prince Florio who is your only friend."</p>

  <p>"I am confounded before both of you," sighed Letty, withdrawing her hand
  from Florio's grasp. "I know that Philip wishes me dead, and I do, also, but
  it is difficult to die with some violence I have no courage for."</p>

  <p>This made Florio fear that the Englishman had spoken brutally to his
  companion, but still he controlled himself, fearing to lose this opportunity
  of speaking to her, even in the presence of her master.</p>

  <p>"I am your friend and not without power," he said keenly. "Tell me what I
  must do to serve you, to please you."</p>

  <p>"Speak, in the Devil's name," urged Lord Mountsellis. "I cannot continue
  this indulgence."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to say," replied Letty, wildly. "I came to look at a kind
  face. To speak with one who held me in respect."</p>

  <p>"Go with him, my dear," broke in the Englishman. "I have sufficient
  troubles without you. He is rich, kind, as you say. He will give you a fine
  establishment and care nothing that you go to him in a mob cap and mourning
  gown."</p>

  <p>"These brutalities can injure neither of us," smiled Florio. "You can end
  all these charades, Letty, if you will trust me."</p>

  <p>"I do trust you, indeed I do. What other friend have I ever had? Yet I
  cannot leave Philip."</p>

  <p>"You heard her? She will not say yes or no&mdash;but once she knew her own
  mind, when she implored me to take her from London before her husband came
  home. Then she was resolute, leaning out of the coach and urging the
  turnpikes to open."</p>

  <p>"It is a resolution that I still keep," said Letty sadly.</p>

  <p>"Yet you wished to see me, you are willing to listen to me," urged
  Florio.</p>

  <p>"Only to see you, for a moment, to listen to you for a moment, out of my
  weakness."</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis made an impatient movement.</p>

  <p>"I have rented a villa at Bagaria," he said quickly, "where I shall
  meditate on my decision. The house is shabby, I hear, but full of those
  whimsical conceits that please me. Castello Sad the name&mdash;you notice
  that I still travel, no respite, and you, as I suppose still on my
  heels."</p>

  <p>"If Letty goes in your household."</p>

  <p>"Carefully phrased&mdash;she may go or stay as she pleases."</p>

  <p>"I shall go," interrupted Letty. "In no other manner could I be so
  carefully hidden."</p>

  <p>"I take my leave of both of you," said Florio with, what was for him, an
  abrupt accent, for he could no longer well endure this scene.</p>

  <p>"You'll come to see us in this suburb?" asked Letty.</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis broke into laughter and ordered her from the room as if
  she had indeed been a servant.</p>

  <p>Florio, taking no leave of the Englishman, hastened after her, but she had
  fled down the wide stairs and was gone into the dark.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36"></a>§ 36</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio put aside a gust of anger that shook him and went home carefully,
  shivering in the warm air as if he were naked in a great cold. Odd that Letty
  should look as she had always looked, as the fine lady of Bologna, as the
  toymaker's wife at Nuremberg, as the gambler's decoy; he might have expected
  her to be changed by her present wretchedness.</p>

  <p>The Englishman had put what insult he could into his laugh and Florio had
  not resented it; though he had not flinched nor abased his princely air, he
  had been, by some enchantment of the senses, away from the gorgeous
  <i>salon</i> and in some moment of the imagination that combined all the
  moments in which he had seen or dreamed of Letty.</p>

  <p>He had seen her, not in the miseries and uncertainties of her present
  position, but set apart, with averted face and a pretty air of dove-like
  innocence and grace.</p>

  <p>And so he saw her now as he walked home through the moonlight that lay
  with a brightness over Palermo that seemed solid, like a wash of silver.</p>

  <p>She had seemed, in the kitchen garb that was the very livery of
  degradation, candid, childish, sincere. Did she <i>love</i> Philip
  Calamy?</p>

  <p>Did he, Florio San Quirico, love her?</p>

  <p>He could not answer these questions, but it excited him to dwell on them,
  nor even this&mdash;"I am interested in them because..."</p>

  <p>No, he could not say, even to himself, why he was absorbed in the fortunes
  of the English exiles. And as he used that word in his mind he thought that
  he too was an exile, and entirely for her sake, and he thought, unbidden:
  "How lonely we all are."</p>

  <p>When, later that evening, he told the tale to Bonino he asked that
  constant servitor what was his opinion as to the dilemma of Lord
  Mountsellis.</p>

  <p>"He will return to England and you, sir, will follow him."</p>

  <p>"I had not thought of that, but rather to detain Mrs. Winslow in
  Sicily."</p>

  <p>"Sir, you will not detach her from the fortunes of this rash man," replied
  Bonino in a strong accent of irony.</p>

  <p>Florio put into words the question that had teased his mind.</p>

  <p>"Do you think she loves him?"</p>

  <p>"In the English manner, perhaps," said Bonino, suddenly dejected. "At
  least she is dependent on him&mdash;eh, see for yourself, sir, she would
  sooner be in his kitchen than leave his household. And she might have from
  your impulsive, reckless generosity&mdash;anything."</p>

  <p>"So, you would say," concluded Florio, "that she must love him. Bonino,
  you are a bold, curious fellow, you foretold that this rash Englishman would
  have a hazard at the cards in Palermo and you were right, and now you
  foretell that he will return to England. Maybe you are right, but I can
  assure you that he believes that Colonel Winslow is in wait for him, and that
  he by no means wishes to die. In brief, he is ready to gamble again, but this
  time it is for his life and he greatly fears to lose the throw."</p>

  <p>"He is reckless, audacious," said Bonino. "Always, mark you, the gambler,
  and he will go, not only for the prizes awaiting him, but because of the
  opinion of his countrymen."</p>

  <p>Florio looked away, his face shadowed by a pallor of fatigue. His mood
  seemed one of unrest and despondency.</p>

  <p>"If we are gamblers," he said, "the Englishman holds all the winning
  cards. Consider, Bonino, how, in a short while they have been all tossed from
  me to him. He is no longer to be bought or bribed or threatened&mdash;quite
  outside my reach."</p>

  <p>And he stood silent, very much concerned with this matter, both anger and
  sorrow in his fine countenance.</p>

  <p>"If," added Bonino, "the Englishman could entice his enemy to Italy he
  could hire <i>bravi</i> to murder him."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Florio San Quirico was startled, then remarked: "Yes, I think he
  might, but when Colonel Winslow was in Italy he did not attempt this."</p>

  <p>"He dared not," replied Bonino. "He was himself poor, in disguise and
  hunted. Now he has power. And would use it. But why speak of this, sir?
  Colonel Winslow will not come to Italy, but wait for his enemy in England.
  And there it will not be possible to have him murdered."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Florio. "All this belongs to rambling fancy, and I have done
  with that."</p>

  <p>"But not with these English people?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;for there is more than fancy. She was hastily, coarsely attired;
  she appeared so young, so full of tears, with that little lamp in her
  trembling hand. You would not have known her for the poor tawdry wretch set
  up on the stage&mdash;neither proud, wilful nor obstinate, but hurt to a
  great stillness."</p>

  <p>"Everything in her life has turned to mischief and calamity," said
  Bonino.</p>

  <p>"You are very patient with me," replied his master with a look of
  gratitude. "Don't suppose I have any amorous designs on this sad lady. I
  never had, and what I feel now is a higher emotion."</p>

  <p>"You were always minded to love her, sir."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you know me better than I know myself. I think perhaps I love her
  now. I know that I cannot leave her disconsolate, that I feel a clear
  obligation to bring her to some comfort."</p>

  <p>"It will pass for love," smiled Bonino sadly.</p>

  <p>"And so will your fidelity to me. Shall we never have rest or respite,
  Bonino? Always the inn or the hired rooms, or the sojourn in a friend's
  house. Well, once I was on good terms with my destiny and satisfied with the
  thin gaudy joys that made up my days."</p>

  <p>"And what came between you and that pleasant life?" asked Bonino with deep
  regret. "A little silly, light creature, long since lost, and now&mdash;but I
  must not say what she is now."</p>

  <p>"I smile no longer at the persistency of my folly nor do I resent your
  reproaches," answered Florio. "I realize what this woman is. I also realize
  that I cannot forsake her&mdash;to-morrow we must leave this Villa Giandola
  and move to the suburb where Lord Mountsellis has taken a villa, Barrais. I
  must not be defeated by this turn of events. It is the lot of every man to
  have to face some such crisis when his heart is engaged against his reason.
  Let us talk of it no more, Bonino."</p>

  <p>He turned aside to his bed and fell into a reverie that was beyond time
  and place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37"></a>§ 37</h2>

  <p class="first">The estates of the Sicilian nobility at Bagaria were cultivated in a
  costly and luxurious manner, on the model of the royal residence at La
  Favorita, and when Florio reached this suburb it was still largely occupied,
  for the heat of the autumn had not yet ceased to render grateful the groves
  of orange, lemon and citron, the terraces of rose bushes and geranium, the
  avenues of mulberry, date palms and cypress that adorned the lavish gardens
  of the wealthy Palermitans.</p>

  <p>This stretch of land was given to pleasure and there were no inns or hired
  rooms for the passing traveller on the isthmus overhung by the red rocks of
  Monte Giordano, and Florio had begun to consider putting into use his
  influence with the Lieutenant Governor, Prince Cuto, in order to find himself
  some quiet accommodation at Bagaria when one of Lord Mountsellis's servants
  brought an invitation from his master to stay at the Castle Sad as his
  guest.</p>

  <p>This bizarre invitation suited Florio, he accepted immediately and
  proceeded with Bonino in a hired carriage to Bagaria.</p>

  <p>The extreme beauty of the scene impressed even his abstraction. It was one
  that seemed to the Bolognese like the setting of an Oriental fairy tale.</p>

  <p>The town, on the spit of land that divides the two bays of Palermo and
  Termini, commanded a view of the Sicilian coast, gold, purple and azure, that
  seemed to stretch beyond limits of the human fancy as well as beyond the
  limits of the human eye. The Lipari islands, far out in the sea, unbounded by
  an horizon line, seemed to be suspended between heaven and earth, and to wear
  the aspect of the dwellings of Circe or Armida, or to have the shape and glow
  of the Fortunate isles.</p>

  <p>Leaning from his carriage Florio could look back, for the road through
  Bagaria rose to high ground, at the glittering and coloured domes and turrets
  of Palermo, the blue bay with white ships, the dense array of aloes and
  prickly pears with their fantastic cactus shapes, the groves of oriental
  trees, the plane, broad leaved and stately, the cypress, blue-black and tall,
  and here and there the impressive ruins of past ages, Greek, Roman,
  Saracenic, fragments of temples, forts, showing broken columns and walls in
  rich marble, stone or brick, between the vineyards and the cornfields now
  awaiting a second reaping.</p>

  <p>So sensible was Florio of the extreme magnificence of this scene that he
  felt his own concerns fade in importance until it seemed of little matter
  whether he continued his pursuit of this wretched Letty Winslow or not.</p>

  <p>Never passionate and always melancholy, he now doubted if he should meddle
  any more in the affairs of the English exiles.</p>

  <p>The sight of Ustica, melting into the quivering gold of the smooth and
  distant ocean&mdash;calm lay like an enchantment over land and
  sea&mdash;filled him with nostalgia for some other world where there would be
  neither rogues like Philip or fools like Letty, where he might live, without
  a heart.</p>

  <p>There, surely, was his way home, to that far off country of the
  imagination where all was a drowsy peace.</p>

  <p>"But you'll not go, sir," said a voice beside him, and, turning, he stared
  into Bonino's anxious face.</p>

  <p>"You read my thought," he said kindly. "It is true that I am a man of
  little resolution. I take no action. I follow this woman to little
  purpose."</p>

  <p>"At least," said the servant, "you now admit, sir, that you do follow
  her."</p>

  <p>Florio ordered the coachman to drive on. He was exasperated by his own
  indecision. A subtle indecision, for he was not in any conflict on the
  subject of Letty or, indeed, any other, he was merely at variance with his
  own profound inner indifference as to the course of his own life.</p>

  <p>Although he knew his own power, and continually used it for his own
  purposes, he felt himself to be essentially too insignificant to affect the
  lives of others. A spectator always.</p>

  <p>It had seemed as if the degradation of Letty to the gaming saloon and the
  kitchen had roused in him the strong and pure emotion he had been awaiting to
  arise in himself. Pity, indignation and chivalry had moved him (or so he
  thought) to something near to love. Now, driving through this luxuriant scene
  of air, land, city, town, mountain, sea, spread before him in a gorgeous
  panorama, he was unsure again. It did not seem to matter under what disguise
  Letty was hidden. She had been lost to her own world years ago when she had
  left England, and now she still had all she had left, her attachment to her
  master.</p>

  <p>"Probably," Florio thought, "she also is indifferent by now to her
  situation, but is this the folly of love or the dullness of habit? She, no
  more than I, will know the answer."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch38"
     id="ch38"></a>§ 38</h2>

  <p class="first">The Castle Sad that Mr. Harte had procured for Lord Mountsellis from the
  steward of the absent owner, stood on a rock outside the town and above a
  valley spanned by an aqueduct with narrow pointed arches. This valley was
  crossed by a number of streamlets that spread into marshy, sandy soil,
  overgrown with reeds and papyrus grasses. A small mansion, no more than a
  century old, had been built on to the massive fragment of the Saracenic fort
  that rose formidable against the blue sky, so vivid at the midday hour when
  Florio approached it, as to seem to pierce the sight.</p>

  <p>This residence had been chosen, obviously, because it was apart from the
  other pleasure villas with their splendid houses and beautiful gardens. It
  was a place, for all its name meant "castle of delight," where one could be
  secret and alone.</p>

  <p>And Florio, as he looked up at it, thought of the old symbol of the castle
  on the crest of a rock that the priests had told him of when he was a child.
  The subject of many a confused monkish parable, dream or feverish
  hallucination, the castle stood for any spiritual protection with which a man
  might encase and protect his fears and miseries.</p>

  <p>A place where he might be fortified, while without was desolation and
  danger.</p>

  <p>But nothing, even a wandering wind, threatened Castle Sad; green blinds
  hung over the windows of the yellow stone mansion, the rocks piled before the
  portal, and either side the rude carriage road was grown with carow trees
  with shining brown berries and evergreen leaves, sumach, fan palm, spurge and
  cistus, while trails of dark ivy overhung the boulders. Behind the castled
  heights could be seen the glimpse of distant mountains, so, pausing, as
  Florio paused midway from the aqueduct to the gate, the eye could glance with
  a dizzy sense of being poised in air, from the lofty mountains, to the crag,
  the castle, the yellow mansion, then to the green valley with the shivering
  reeds, far below.</p>

  <p>The walls of Castle Sad were covered in bas reliefs, eagles, shields,
  lions, boars, trophies showed sharply outlined in shadows as if about to
  spring into a monstrous life. Above the door of the house was a label resting
  on two heraldic beasts who served as corbels; the round-headed windows either
  side were studded with nail heads in imitation of the Eastern style of the
  ancient castle, that Florio now saw, on a closer inspection, was partially a
  ruin, darkly streaked with ivy, dwarf palms, thistles and manna ash growing
  unchecked on the jutting ramparts.</p>

  <p>Florio had not expected the spectacle that met him as the neat liveried
  servant conducted him and Bonino into the ground floor <i>salon,</i> shaded
  from the outer brightness by green slatted <i>persane.</i></p>

  <p>The Englishman, wrapped in a summer cloak of thin material, was lying on
  the hard couch of classic shape, drawn up near the left wall. A pile of
  papers lay on the tessellated floor near him; his hands were clasped behind
  his head and he regarded Florio with an intent and fearful stare.</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you for coming," he said quickly, but without
  moving. "It is something to be able to speak one's own language."</p>

  <p>"You really desire me to remain here?" asked Florio.</p>

  <p>"I do, I do. I am indebted to you&mdash;and to your man, he is a faithful
  fellow. I never could arouse that devotion in anyone, though I was a lavish
  master in my time."</p>

  <p>Florio perceived that he was talking in extreme agitation without taking
  much heed of what he said, and as he continued to talk in this vague, yet
  animated strain, Florio sent Bonino from the room, and approaching Lord
  Mountsellis said:</p>

  <p>"I do not come as your friend. I know nothing of you that I like and we
  have had already too many speeches together that have led nowhere."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" interrupted the Englishman impatiently. "If you are concerned with
  any nicety over Letty Winslow, pray be at ease on that score. Take her, on
  any terms or none. Not only is she indifferent to me, it is worse than
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can believe that nobody is indifferent to you, Lord Mountsellis, it is
  either love or hate."</p>

  <p>"Near hatred here, the wretch has ruined me." With a flash of impatience
  that threw all reserve to the wind, he added: "Nothing but that damnable bet
  stands between me and all I ever wanted."</p>

  <p>"You, not she, made the bet."</p>

  <p>"I am in no mood for philosophy. But I'm glad you came&mdash;you say
  you're not a friend. No doubt I've offended you, irked you. But you followed
  me&mdash;us. I've no one else to whom to turn!" he burst out, with his
  aslant, not displeasing smile odd on his pale, grey face, that looked sick in
  the greenish light. "No woman is worth a man's entire attention," he added.
  "It is a strange quirk you have for Letty&mdash;it amused me once to dress
  her up, to disguise her, she is so passive, but now!"</p>

  <p>"She is still here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in this bizarre place, not so splendid as your Chiaramonte, my dear
  Prince, but my own, I chose it and I pay for it. I like it because it too is
  a disguise." He moved with his easy air of sullen withdrawal and said: "My
  head aches confoundedly."</p>

  <p>Florio observed that he was now disarranged as well as carelessly attired,
  that his hands were shaking, his eyes suffused. "To think that I, who was
  always on my guard against artful women, should have been ruined by a fool!"
  he exclaimed. "But you, my dear Prince, as a foreigner, don't understand the
  English honour."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Florio simply. "You are a man of ample mental resources, and
  since you now have money and need not live in hiding&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis broke in.</p>

  <p>"I <i>cannot</i> live in hiding. <i>He</i> will soon be able to find out
  where I am, and find me out, even across a world at war, and shoot me as he
  nearly shot me before. So I had as soon go to meet him while I have some
  credit left, as wait for him to come to me." He turned his beautiful tired
  eyes towards Florio. "Do you understand now how I am utterly lost and
  ruined?"</p>

  <p>"I understand that you persist in treating me as a friend and I am none.
  Once, I amused myself with the power I had over you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I hated you for that. It's gone now, as we are equals there&mdash;as
  for friends, I tell you again I have not one." He pointed down at the letters
  and papers on the floor beside him. "Do you think there is one friend among
  those who have written to me? All of them eager to see what I shall do, a
  toady here, a knave there, one with an old debt to remind me of, another
  hoping for a favour&mdash;there is not one of them, one time school, college,
  army colleagues and all, I would trust as I do you."</p>

  <p>"You have no cause to trust me," said Florio.</p>

  <p>"O, you are too indifferent to all of it to trouble to deceive me."</p>

  <p>"Too indifferent to offer you advice."</p>

  <p>"I don't desire even that."</p>

  <p>"What then?"</p>

  <p>"That you should stay with me."</p>

  <p>Florio was quick to note the misery in his face, that had a death-like
  look in the greenish light.</p>

  <p>"Don't go home," he said. "You know what awaits you. Do your letters
  mention Colonel Winslow?"</p>

  <p>"All of them&mdash;and with malice. Save some from women that advise me to
  remain abroad. I hoped he might be dead. But no&mdash;he lives."</p>

  <p>"Don't go home," repeated Florio. "What is this honour to a man like you?
  Remain here. You enjoy disguises, you can pass from one to another, and if
  this old man should come here, which is not likely, you could easily throw
  him off the track."</p>

  <p>"You speak like that because you think I am utterly worthless," remarked
  the Englishman.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. I don't regard you as worth all this flourish of punctilio.
  Remain hidden, slipping from mask to mask. A gambler's life, one you chose
  for yourself very early."</p>

  <p>"I am Mountsellis," said the Englishman, without offence or reproach. "I
  want all that means, most of all the honour."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Florio that they might juggle with that word
  indefinitely.</p>

  <p>"In this country," added the Earl, "there is no scruple about putting a
  man out of the way."</p>

  <p>Florio recalled what Bonino had said on this point. He seemed to
  understand the Englishman very well.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, affecting not to know what was meant. "If Colonel
  Winslow had killed you he would never have been blamed."</p>

  <p>"I did not think of that, my dear fellow, and you know it. If that old
  devil were to come to Sicily he would be in immediate danger. But he won't
  come&mdash;he is sure that, as a gentleman, I must return."</p>

  <p>"'As a gentleman,'" smiled Florio, moving towards the door.</p>

  <p>"To take up the obligations of my rank. Winslow understands me better than
  you do. But stay with me, for God's sake."</p>

  <p>"I came here to see Letty."</p>

  <p>"You shall see her. But keep her out of my sight."</p>

  <p>"Does she wish to remain in it?"</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis appeared to check what he was about to say. He rose and
  said sullenly: "Don't leave me alone. I told her to wait for you on the rocks
  outside the old castle. Don't detain her long, I would rather not have talk
  about her. Persuade her&mdash;" he paused so suddenly and so long that Florio
  asked: "What do you want me to persuade Letty Winslow?"</p>

  <p>"To keep away from me&mdash;get her into a convent, anywhere," he spoke
  quietly and with difficulty, as if every word cost a struggle.</p>

  <p>"She can't go home, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No. I told you, so did she, I think. I want to persuade people at home
  that she is dead. She might so easily have died."</p>

  <p>"I shall try to take her away to a more fitting place than your kitchen,"
  said Florio.</p>

  <p>The Englishman suddenly laughed, with an insolence that had a touch of
  wild mirth.</p>

  <p>"But even you must be put to it to know what to do with her!"</p>

  <p>Florio smiled brilliantly.</p>

  <p>"I must do what I can, my lord."</p>

  <p>"And when you have seen her, return to me. You are my guest and I demand
  your company."</p>

  <p>"I shall return. I could not make Palermo to-night, but I do not know what
  more we have to say to one another."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch39"
     id="ch39"></a>§ 39</h2>

  <p class="first">Letty was seated on one of the pale yellow boulders clasped by ivy. A drip
  straw hat was tied with black ribbons under her chin; she wore the dress of a
  kitchen maid; her eyes were red and she had an air of great lassitude. The
  shadow of the old castle was over her and a warm breeze from the sea softened
  the heat of the declining day.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him?" she asked at once, springing up as Florio approached.
  "Is he not ill? Distracted?"</p>

  <p>"Something, yes&mdash;but I am not concerned with him, but with you."</p>

  <p>"O, don't you yet understand that there is nothing for me, that I am
  nothing?"</p>

  <p>"I will not so understand, Letty. I want you to leave him and forget
  him."</p>

  <p>She shook her head and seemed unable to speak.</p>

  <p>"You, then, love him, Letty?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know if that is the word for it," she whispered, hoarsely. "It is
  almost more than love. He is all I have. I know that he is tired of
  me&mdash;he long has been weary of the whole adventure."</p>

  <p>"Then, out of pride, you should leave him."</p>

  <p>"I never had any pride."</p>

  <p>"You will remain, then, in the only place he offers you&mdash;his
  kitchen?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she asked, instead of replying, "what you offer me."</p>

  <p>Because she asked him this, he at once offered her more than he had
  intended.</p>

  <p>"I can give you security, respect, a retreat." He thought of the Giandola
  family and the tacit friendship and sympathy of the women that he had never
  drawn upon. "I can obtain for you the companionship of ladies of your own
  rank."</p>

  <p>"That would mean yet another disguise for me."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;neither you nor I have need of disguises."</p>

  <p>"It is agreeable to hear you offer this kindness. I never thought that I
  should have such a chance. Of course I cannot take it."</p>

  <p>Florio was surprised at his own disappointment. The hope that she would
  accept anything from him had been brief indeed, yet there was the oppression
  of a blighted hope over him as he answered.</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest, then?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to stay with Philip. He asked you that himself, did he not? He
  said that was his intention."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is strange that he should feel this partiality for me. Our story
  has indeed become twisted. He used to dislike me and look on me as an
  enemy."</p>

  <p>Letty, with an unusual energy in her docile and timid look, assured him
  that this was so. "When we were at Chiaramonte he spoke often of you and the
  interest you had shown in us, and how you understood us better than
  anyone."</p>

  <p>"Yet now he complains that I do not understand his English punctilio."</p>

  <p>"He is not a very reasonable man. He meant, I think, that you are the only
  person who, knowing the whole of our story, tolerates us."</p>

  <p>"He will find, in his present condition, many to tolerate him, already he
  has had letters."</p>

  <p>"I know, they are months old, there will be others. Yet he is so lonely,
  and afraid."</p>

  <p>She gave him a full look; though she had lost her bloom, she appeared
  immature, quite feeble and defenceless, as if ready to fade and vanish out of
  life.</p>

  <p>Florio sat on the yellow rock beside her and took her thin hand in his
  strong fingers.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said, "all you wish to say of Philip."</p>

  <p>She began hurriedly to speak of the increasing illness and restless misery
  of her companion, whose moods had rapidly become so harsh and wild as to
  alarm the superstitions of the Sicilian household during the few days they
  had been at the Castle Sad.</p>

  <p>Something mysterious in the foreigner, who was a heretic and of a beauty
  that was startling, his storms of ill temper and his terror of being alone,
  who was reckless in expenditure, caring nothing as to who robbed him, yet who
  lived withdrawn from society, alarmed the hired servants, and some had
  already left him, protesting that he had the evil eye, was under a spell, or
  damned.</p>

  <p>"Fear is overturning his wits," whispered Letty. "He resents his fate. He
  knows that he must return to England."</p>

  <p>"And can find no strength in his own threadbare spirit."</p>

  <p>"None. He knows he must face my husband."</p>

  <p>"He will do that, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is a long-standing fear, it has been gnawing at him ever since
  Colonel Winslow obtained leave of absence to follow us. But he relied on his
  disguises."</p>

  <p>"He has neither God not philosophy."</p>

  <p>"No. Neither have I. I suppose he was my god once, but he told me it was
  only a matter of a bet, not love."</p>

  <p>"He told you that!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, long ago. I was jealous and vexatious. I thought we might have made
  something sublime of it, you know, all lost for love."</p>

  <p>"So did I, my poor Letty."</p>

  <p>And he thought: "We are both idealists, this simple woman and I with my
  learning of the schools and my ironic worldliness."</p>

  <p>"If I had had any dignity or self respect I should have left him then,"
  continued Letty. "But I had none. I raved and wept and was ill. He left me
  behind once at a wayside inn, but I followed him on foot."</p>

  <p>"You intend still to follow him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What else could I <i>do?"</i></p>

  <p>"As his servant?"</p>

  <p>"There is no other way. I am cunningly hidden. If I keep out of his sight
  long enough, the mood will come upon him when he will send for me, only to
  sit with him a little, or, maybe to reproach me, yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He waited for her to continue, not well being able to speak himself.</p>

  <p>The sea breeze freshened and seemed to shake liquid gold over the leaves
  of palm and carow trees growing near to them, for it came from the west with
  the last glory of the sun.</p>

  <p>"It is my only chance of going to England with him," she continued
  rapidly. "If need be, I would go as a footman&mdash;I <i>must</i> do this,
  <i>must</i> contrive it, do you not see that we cannot be parted?"</p>

  <p>"Have you thought what will happen to you in England?"</p>

  <p>"No. How can I think? I just go on and take my destiny&mdash;only the word
  is rather large for me. I am the cause of this trouble," she added. "I cannot
  escape."</p>

  <p>"Do you hope to prevent these two men from meeting?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, yet hesitant. "No. I am without hope. I don't think
  that even if I died it could be prevented. He is bound in honour," she added,
  without sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"And what binds you to him, Letty, or me to you? But how useless to ask!"
  He felt that he parted with the last pretence at intellectual
  disinterestedness on this admission. He was involved with Letty, even with
  Philip, in complex meshes of emotion that had nothing to do with reason.</p>

  <p>"You want me to stay?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;in the loneliness closing on him he asked so often for you,
  there is no one else."</p>

  <p>"I offered you all I had, and this is the one thing you desire?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed it is. I cannot suppose that you will do it for me, and I know
  that you must be indifferent to him, if not worse, but I ask it, being
  desperate."</p>

  <p>"Have you considered that I could not be more at your disposal if I loved
  you, Letty, that, perhaps, I do love you?"</p>

  <p>"You repine on it too much," she whispered, rising. "What you think that
  you see in me is the creation of your dreams."</p>

  <p>"You have so effaced yourself," he replied, "that you have become like a
  dream. And I, to whom the common stuff of life is vulgar and coarse, find
  that pleases me."</p>

  <p>He found a relief almost amounting to joy in this confession, that
  assuaged his hidden romanticism, his careless eccentricity, his restless
  pursuit of an emotion, possibly a passion that would be beyond even his usual
  scope.</p>

  <p>His position and his gifts put almost everything within his reach, it was
  indeed owing to his worldly power that this had been put into his reach. Yet
  it was something that was rare, that had nothing to do with money, influence
  or rank.</p>

  <p>This humbled woman, truly an outcast, was indifferent to his person and to
  what he could offer her; she trusted him, however, with a grotesque mission,
  comfort for her companion, a creature Florio disdained to dislike, that she
  hardly loved, who could offer no return for any fellowhsip but a share in his
  own doom.</p>

  <p>Florio looked down into the valley, a space of blue light beneath the
  narrow arches of the aqueduct, the tall canes and reeds rippled by the west
  wind that, to Florio's fancy, was coloured gold and visible. The place and
  the hour had the vagueness of a dream, that word came to him repeatedly,
  especially since Letty had used it. The essence of the adventure, followed
  across Europe during years, was a dream. The Forest and the mound in the
  summer house, the open window with the posy of flowers on the sill, the
  desolate ramparts at Nuremberg and the long road winding south.</p>

  <p>He saw, in this dream, Philip Calamy, hunted from one disguise to another,
  turning, twisting, and now, at last, cornered and driven on to his doom in
  his own country, stripped of all his arts and tricks, defenceless before this
  strange notion of honour.</p>

  <p>"He has his dark side," whispered Letty. "&mdash;then he can be, could be,
  gay, full of delight because of some new scheme&mdash;a play&mdash;his fits
  of mad rage you can understand. He enjoys life so much. He cannot endure a
  scratch or a scar, nor any ugliness. When he wore that white plaster mask it
  was for the relish of taking it off and seeing himself in a
  looking-glass."</p>

  <p>"Does he know how well you understand him?" With a touching sweetness she
  replied: "I am nothing to him either way."</p>

  <p>"What do you think I can be?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." She rose steadying herself by Florio's hand. "Do what you
  can."</p>

  <p>With that and no more, by as much as a glance, she left him and moved
  delicately away, between the straight trunks of the palm trees into the blue
  shadow at the back of the ruined yellow fortress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch40"
     id="ch40"></a>§ 40</h2>

  <p class="first">"I have been in dangerous situations before," muttered the Englishman,
  "but always known how to get myself out; now I'm damned if I see a way."</p>

  <p>He had spoken on this theme for the entire evening. Nothing, his sole
  listener, Florio San Quirico, thought could be more monotonous than hearing a
  man rail against his own decision.</p>

  <p>There was nothing new that Lord Mountsellis could turn over in his
  quandary, yet he persisted in raking among the ashes of his miseries and
  fears until they, monstrous phantoms of his making, were ready to overwhelm
  him in despair.</p>

  <p>Yet words only touched the surface of his suffering that was, Florio
  observed, unspeakable.</p>

  <p>It was clear that the Englishman had never himself realized the strength
  of his smothered ambitions. He had been resigned to his exile, to his errant
  life, because he had few hopes or expectations in his own country. Having
  made his position there disagreeable, almost untenable, he had not had much
  to lose when he eloped with Letty, and the monies sent him in payment of his
  bet had procured him the season in Bologna, where he had been more at ease,
  more luxurious and better thought of than ever before. Three lives, two of
  them young, had stood between him and the family fortunes, to which it was
  clear he had never given a regret.</p>

  <p>Now they were his, but only to be had at so fearful a price that he raged
  to think of it. Lust for power, money and all that was now nominally his,
  turned ferociously in his quick spirit.</p>

  <p>He seemed indeed to Florio to be in the early stage of a fever, perhaps of
  a desperate illness, and his sole comfort was the presence of the
  Bolognese.</p>

  <p>"I know you are not my friend," he said. "But you act the part of
  one."</p>

  <p>Now he walked the room, now he tossed on the sofa, now in the low chair
  with arms by the green marble table with the goats' legs in bronze on which
  stood the silver lamp.</p>

  <p>The windows were wide open; he had them so every night, despite the demurs
  of his servants who believed that dangerous miasmas came in from the campaign
  at dark, not only <i>mal-aria</i> but evil spirits.</p>

  <p>The night was superb, the rich scene of rock, tree, shrub, aqueduct and
  valley lay in differing tints of blue and green silver under the moon that
  filled the upper air with a brilliant refulgence, broken by a few still
  clouds, white as lilies under clear water. Florio stood at the window,
  looking out on this scene that afforded him some escape from the pressure of
  the Englishman's passion.</p>

  <p>Florio was tired. He wondered if Letty was watching the lighted space
  where he stood. He did not know where she slept, perhaps in some broken
  chamber in the yellow castle, where, kneeling in the dark she could peer down
  at Philip's room.</p>

  <p>Like a sentinel Florio waited, his arms folded on his heart. Bonino was
  waiting also, he knew, in the closet next the room allotted to him, as he,
  the constant servitor, had waited in so many alien rooms, patient,
  uncomplaining.</p>

  <p>All of them waiting on one another, exiled by their own actions from the
  pleasantness of common life. Sometimes the Englishman cursed, in his own
  language, in French, in Italian, in German, casting, in these tongues,
  imprecations on all the resting places of his travels. Sometimes he lamented
  in a low voice, as if speaking to someone who would understand.</p>

  <p>Florio knew that at these moments he had forgotten where he was, and that
  it was to some kind companion of his childhood, long since lost, to whom he
  made his miserable complaint.</p>

  <p>And the Italian wondered yet again what this man's life had been, the
  people he had known, the chances he had had, the enemies he had made, and if
  the gifts and graces he had exploited for his pleasures had served to bring
  him any good will from anyone.</p>

  <p>It did not seem so. There had been time now for someone to come in person
  with his news, to tell him exactly what he might expect in England.</p>

  <p>But no one had come. Not even a lawyer, a steward or a servant, merely
  letters, servile, tormenting or foolish.</p>

  <p>Only Letty whom he quite despised, perhaps hated, remained with him, and
  the foreigner who would have despised, perhaps hated him, had he not been so
  indifferent to him as to feel no emotion where he was concerned.</p>

  <p>At length the Englishman was silent and Florio turned to look at him and
  saw his reflection in the vast looking-glass that hung opposite the couch
  where he lay, his cravat untied, his hair tangled, his eyes closed, one arm
  across his breast, the other flung stiffly outwards.</p>

  <p>His attitude and his expression showed an extremity of despair that
  affected even Florio so that he shuddered and felt, for the first time, a
  thrill of horror at the realization that this young, brilliant creature must
  be doomed.</p>

  <p>He could think of no other word than that; if he slew his adversary he
  would be hunted again, this time as a criminal, but the chances were that he
  would be himself slain.</p>

  <p>He lay there, in his wilful youth, under sentence of death.</p>

  <p>Florio thought of the other man, the stiff soldier whom he had seen in
  Germany, of his long suffering and long waiting.</p>

  <p>He, too, was approaching either death or disaster; probably the strange
  code of his countrymen, what they termed their honour, would absolve him if
  he killed Philip, but he would not be ever at ease again.</p>

  <p>"I must persuade them that she is dead&mdash;and dead she is&mdash;to
  them&mdash;to me," muttered the Englishman, without looking up or moving.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would not speak of Letty Winslow," said Florio. "Leave her to
  her own strange loyalty."</p>

  <p>"Would I could leave her&mdash;anywhere," Philip sat up and glanced at the
  lamp on the green table. "Keep her away from me, pray do."</p>

  <p>"Why do you wish it supposed that she is dead?"</p>

  <p>Philip looked at him bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I want her off my hands, out of the way," he replied, fixing an
  obstinate, vindictive glance on his own image in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"She will not trouble you," said Florio advancing to the couch. "I shall
  take charge of that."</p>

  <p>"You will? You are a good fellow, San Quirico, stay with me a little
  longer."</p>

  <p>"Do you not intend to sleep to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I have not slept for many nights, only a half hour or so. The doctor's
  stuff brings hallucinations that I cannot well bear. I never learned to get
  drunk."</p>

  <p>Florio had observed that, like many gamblers, the Englishman was always
  sober, careful to be in full control of his wits, careful of his appearance
  and his elegance, self-controlled in that and other things, because he
  enjoyed the intrigues, adventures and sports that were only to be relished by
  one whose mind was clear.</p>

  <p>"Watch with me this one night," he asked. "I shall begin the journey to
  England to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Give up this resolution," said Florio warmly. "One way or another it will
  be murder&mdash;can you endure to put this crime on this old man, already so
  wronged by you? Or yourself to murder him? Have you thought of his children,
  who are Letty's children, too, who, no doubt, love him and look to him, and
  any other friends he may have?"</p>

  <p>"It is a point of honour," said Lord Mountsellis, sullenly. "I shall not
  challenge him, of course, but there is no hope that he will not challenge
  me."</p>

  <p>"If someone spoke to him of the stupidity of this barbarous
  revenge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis grimaced.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," he whispered, and took his head in his hand. "And
  I do not care if you understand or not, as long as you remain with me."</p>

  <p>"This is a melancholy fellowship," said Florio. "If I liked you I should
  feel a strong compassion for you, even though I think you behave like a fool.
  This honour that you hold in such a strange admiration is a weak
  superstition."</p>

  <p>He looked closely at the haggard face of the Englishman, all his features
  were taut, as if he strained under a physical oppression. He began to
  complain softly to himself, with now and then a distracted pause.</p>

  <p>"If I had never come into my fortune," he said, "I could have found
  sufficient amusement in wandering up and down Europe, outwitting the police,
  playing with fools&mdash;but now, it is infernally hard to have to give
  up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He checked abruptly and smiled wanly.</p>

  <p>"Give up," thought Florio, "all your greeds and lusts that now might be
  indulged. I wonder what poor use you would make of all this power and riches,
  were you allowed to live to enjoy them?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly looking up, the Englishman added:</p>

  <p>"If you have no sympathy with me, you have shown at least, a good deal of
  interest&mdash;admit that&mdash;for years now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have been absorbed in your vagaries."</p>

  <p>"And you have shown a good deal of patience, also. There is something
  useful, after all, in the philosophic turn of mind that you affect."</p>

  <p>Florio thought that he was talking in order to put off the hour of his
  companion's departure.</p>

  <p>The night was still, the moonlight, so brilliant that it seemed filled by
  the glimmer of all the rainbow colours fused into silver, was withdrawing
  from the chamber, the squares of the open windows were purple bright, the
  room filled with bluish shadow as the flame of the untended lamp sunk in the
  socket.</p>

  <p>The Englishman rose, gave himself a ghastly grin in the looking-glass that
  appeared, in this uncertain light, like a sheet of water, and turned to the
  sideboard of yellow marble.</p>

  <p>There he hesitated, taking up and putting down glasses and goblets that
  stood beside bottles, flagons and decanters.</p>

  <p>Florio, in his weariness, was reminded of the traveller, Colonel Winslow,
  in the hotel room at Wurtemberg. Just so had he stood, self absorbed,
  withdrawn into himself, his hand shaking on his glass of sparkling wine as he
  had described Letty&mdash;as no great beauty, with red hair, a well-bred
  Englishwoman. How would Colonel Winslow now describe his wife, so worn,
  forlorn and hopeless, her gentle eyes reddened with useless tears, her
  kitchen maid's attire?</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis turned away, leaving the wine and brandy untouched; much
  as he longed for oblivion he was terrified lest he might unsteady his nerves
  or his wits even beyond their present agitation.</p>

  <p>"I began to practise yesterday," he remarked hoarsely, his hand to his
  throat as if he had a physical difficulty with his speech. "I was always a
  good swordsman, but never interested in pistols."</p>

  <p>"I wonder that you did not begin to make yourself more expert with this
  weapon as soon as you knew that Colonel Winslow was in pursuit."</p>

  <p>"I was so sure of evading him," replied the Englishman sullenly. "I began,
  I say, yesterday&mdash;before then my hand was not steady enough. No use, I
  could hit nothing. I shall be a defenceless mark."</p>

  <p>He turned sharply and stared at the door as if he had heard someone on the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>"You are not in danger yet," said Florio. "Take an opiate and sleep."</p>

  <p>"I do not dare to do so. I feel that he might come on me as soon as I am
  unconscious."</p>

  <p>"You know that he cannot come to you, but that you must go to him. If you
  do not sleep your reason will be unsettled."</p>

  <p>"If you will stay in this house until I wake, I will take it. Certainly I
  begin to lose all strength."</p>

  <p>"I could not leave at this hour," said Florio. "I shall stay."</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis took, with unsteady fingers, a small gold box from his
  waistcoat pocket and gave it, with a simplicity that was almost childlike, to
  Florio.</p>

  <p>"There are some pastils there&mdash;an opiate."</p>

  <p>As the lamp flame flared up for the last time, Florio poured some ice
  water out of a carafe on the sideboard into one of the beakers of Venetian
  glass.</p>

  <p>"Lie down," he said. "I shall see that you are not disturbed."</p>

  <p>The Englishman obeyed. He seemed, even, faintly relieved, as if his
  destiny had been taken out of his hands. He swallowed the drug, drank the
  water and lay down on the couch, pulling the cushions piled there under his
  head.</p>

  <p>The lamp went out, and the dusky blue light from the two windows alone
  filled the chamber.</p>

  <p>At that hour there was a sudden chill in the air, Florio took the
  travelling cloak from one of the chairs and laid it over the Englishman, who
  pressed his hands warmly, then gave a long drawn sigh.</p>

  <p>The dose, opium Florio guessed it to be, must have been powerful for the
  strong young man, so fretted and alert, was soon asleep, a slumber broken at
  first by a few whispered moanings, then disturbed only by deep breaths.</p>

  <p>Florio left the room.</p>

  <p>In the eastwards facing corridor the sudden dawn-light was falling through
  the narrow-pointed windows. Beneath one of them sat Letty Winslow, a
  peasant's white handkerchief over her red hair.</p>

  <p>"Ah," whispered Florio, vexed.</p>

  <p>"How long you have been," she said softly. "Would he not rest?"</p>

  <p>"Must you watch here, like a spaniel?"</p>

  <p>"I crept down from the closet they have given me&mdash;no one knows. I
  fear he is ill."</p>

  <p>"He has taken a sleeping powder."</p>

  <p>"At last! You see he trusts you. Did you shut the windows?"</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that," smiled Florio. "I covered him with a
  cloak."</p>

  <p>"It is so chill about the dawn! I shall steal in and close the
  windows."</p>

  <p>"No need. It will soon be hot enough."</p>

  <p>"But I want to see him as he sleeps. It will be agreeable to see him when
  he is not frowning or scolding me."</p>

  <p>She glided away with that well bred grace that made her coarse garments
  show for what they were, a disguise.</p>

  <p>"How they draw me in and net me round," Florio pondered. "And I deserve
  this trap for my meddling."</p>

  <p>He waited in the passage as the day brightened and the sunlight gleamed on
  the marble lining of the walls, then re-entered the <i>salon</i> well knowing
  what he should find.</p>

  <p>Letty was seated on the floor where the Englishman slept, his senses and
  his terrors sealed up by the drug. She had closed the windows and removed to
  the distant sideboard the lamp that smelt of burnt oil, and had re-adjusted
  the folds of the thin riding cloak over the sleeper's limbs.</p>

  <p>She turned with a shrinking timidity when Florio opened the door.</p>

  <p>"One cannot leave him alone," she excused herself, timidly. About her
  look, her voice, her gesture, was a retired modesty not to be associated with
  her history.</p>

  <p>Florio recalled how he had once thought, "She will one day die stupidly,"
  and wondered why that remembrance had come to him. He reminded himself that
  he too was weary from the vigil.</p>

  <p>"Come, Letty, you must not remain here, soon the servants will be about,
  and if there is any gossip it will anger your patient. He can well be left as
  he will sleep for many hours."</p>

  <p>Letty rose, though reluctantly, made a needless rearrangement of the cloak
  over the sleeper's shoulders and followed into the passage.</p>

  <p>"I shall fly away and not be seen," she promised earnestly. "But you will
  stay?"</p>

  <p>In this pitiless disregard of him save as an instrument for her person,
  Florio saw her utter integrity. If this was not love it was some fine
  illusion as powerful as love, something of what he himself felt for Letty, an
  ideal passion of the dream and the waking fantasy.</p>

  <p>And it was this; it was beyond time and chance and not to be disturbed by
  either parting or death. An attachment termed in the Academies where Florio
  San Quirico had often been a spirited debater, Platonic even on Letty's part,
  for her absence of all jealousy or resentment at her humiliations showed that
  she had lost any worldly or common passion she might have had for her
  companion, and regarded him now with this pure detached tenderness only.</p>

  <p>While he, who had never loved her at all in this manner, and but little in
  other, having brought her down for a wager, as a marksman might bring down,
  in a wanton gamble, a fair, innocent bird, now regarded her with distaste,
  perhaps enmity.</p>

  <p>"I too must sleep," said Florio. "I shall send my manservant to watch over
  him. Do you, also, get some repose."</p>

  <p>She then looked swiftly and anxiously into his pallid face as he leaned
  against the shining wall, and swiftly accused herself.</p>

  <p>"O, I observe your kindness&mdash;do not be angry with me. I have no one
  else. I leave all in your hands."</p>

  <p>She was gone, hastening away from him as if she feared that her presence
  vexed him.</p>

  <p>Florio, mistaking the way once or twice in his weariness and his scanty
  knowledge of the house, found his way to the chambers allotted to him.</p>

  <p>Bonino was asleep, fully dressed, in a chair by the window.</p>

  <p>Florio regarded him intently.</p>

  <p>The man looked old in his sleep and seemed to have put off his air of a
  servant and an inferior. Lines of dignity as well as care showed in his thin
  cheeks, high brow and firm lips.</p>

  <p>Florio thought, "He is old enough to be my father and he has fallen asleep
  watching for me."</p>

  <p>Bonino would never complain nor ever mention his tedium and his fatigue;
  surely his homesickness, also, for he, though without a family, had lived
  pleasantly in Bologna.</p>

  <p>Since he had followed his master on what, to him at least, was a senseless
  errand, he had gradually lost his spirit, though never his alacrity in his
  master's service. His gaiety was spent and he had lived much apart among the
  southerners, whom he regarded as foreigners. Now, Florio thought, he looked
  wistful and downcast in his slumber. This was the first time that he had been
  found sleeping at his post.</p>

  <p>A voluntary watch, since Florio had not bid him wait.</p>

  <p>"I trifle with his affection," reflected the young man. And he recalled
  the long diligence of Bonino in tracking down Philip Calamy, and his
  shrewdness in surmising where, and in what occupation, that adventurer would
  be found. "And I was, without thought, going to set him to guard the
  Englishman."</p>

  <p>Florio went into the chamber assigned to him that opened from the closet
  where the servant slept.</p>

  <p>His bed had been prepared, the mosquito net was in place, the toilet
  appointments unpacked.</p>

  <p>The room seemed deserted, though so carefully prepared for a guest's
  entertainment; it reminded Florio of the room at Wilhelmsruhe, of the room at
  Chiaramonte, of other rooms where Letty had stayed awhile, leaving in one
  shawls, a posy, in the others, nothing, yet a sense of her one time presence
  conjured up by his imagination and the withdrawal of her presence, her escape
  and flight from him, that was like a desolation of the spirit.</p>

  <p>He looked from the window. All was bright now, the purple autumn seas
  melted into the deep blue of the heavens, the foliage of palm and plane, of
  manna ash and cypress was sharp and clear as enamel. Here, as under the
  moonlight, was a landscape of a dream, a dream lost, forgone and scarcely
  remembered.</p>

  <p>Florio stood there longer than he knew. When he moved, it was to bathe his
  face quietly in the basin of cool water Bonino had put ready for him, then to
  pass lightly the still sleeping servant, and return himself to watch the
  Englishman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch41"
     id="ch41"></a>§ 41</h2>

  <p class="first">When Lord Mountsellis awoke, well on into the day, he was much refreshed
  and had recovered something of his usual slightly insolent composure.</p>

  <p>He found the physician he now had always with him, on duty by his couch
  and on asking at once for Prince Florio was told that he had been sleeping
  this hour or more.</p>

  <p>"Well," remarked the Englishman, yawning and stretching. "He gave me some
  confoundedly good advice. He is a cool fellow and ahead of the times. I don't
  know, on my soul, I don't, why I didn't listen to him, instead of getting
  into a romantic frenzy, however, it is not too late."</p>

  <p>The doctor could make nothing of this and bowed civilly. He was well paid
  for his post and regarded it as a sinecure, the mere whim of an eccentric and
  possibly lunatic Englishman.</p>

  <p>He was inclined to regard all members of this nation as mad, from the
  stories he had heard of them during the British occupation of the two
  Sicilies, and some strange happenings he had witnessed himself. His patron
  had not confided in him, but naturally as shrewd as discreet, he had gathered
  from the careless and often random talk of Lord Mountsellis that he dreaded
  to return home because of some crime or scandal.</p>

  <p>He now made his punctilious inspection of his patient, who seemed to him
  to be in such admirable health as might be expected from the care he had
  always taken of himself and his natural advantages.</p>

  <p>"And, sir, your spirits seem relieved this morning, both from the pining
  melancholy that afflicted you, and the claps of frenzy that you yourself
  mentioned just now."</p>

  <p>"It was the sleep&mdash;a much-needed oblivion."</p>

  <p>"You should have taken this opiate before, sir."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid to do so. I feared dreams. But there were none. Will you
  breakfast&mdash;dine&mdash;I know not what hour it is, on the terrace? And I
  should like the company of Prince Florio as soon as he awakes."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch42"
     id="ch42"></a>§ 42</h2>

  <p class="first">It was not until the evening that Lord Mountsellis had his desire of
  meeting his guest again.</p>

  <p>Bonino, now on duty in his master's room, refused to have him disturbed,
  and Florio slept long.</p>

  <p>"We shall be out of our wits through this mad Englishman," grumbled
  Bonino, who was sharply humiliated at his own failure to keep vigil, and
  shaken by the delicate look of Florio, sunk in the slumber of complete
  exhaustion.</p>

  <p>Philip complained at this delay. Now that he had decided on his course of
  action, Castle Sad seemed to him like a prison, idleness irked him, there was
  nothing to do in this hired house with foreign servants, who seemed half
  afraid of him, half hostile, yet his spirits were higher than they had been
  since he had received the letter from Lennard Giles.</p>

  <p>The physician found his company tedious, for he spoke only of himself and
  made it clear that he required no more medical services, but that the good
  doctor would be presently dismissed.</p>

  <p>When Florio came at last on the terrace, that was a mere levelling of the
  yellow rock at the side of the house, set about with an arched balustrade, he
  had a dense headache and the fatigue of his sleepless night was still over
  him, and with it the despair of the Englishman, so it was with a kind of
  stupefaction that he beheld Philip, spruce and animated, seated behind an
  iron table loaded with fruit, cakes and sherbet, yet there was something
  forced about the gaiety of his greeting, something unnatural about his
  composure.</p>

  <p>"I have decided to take your advice," he said at once, rising to set a
  chair for Florio. "I shall leave this place to-morrow and return to the
  mainland. I shall take a villa in Rome or Florence."</p>

  <p>"You do not, then, intend to return to England?" Florio was startled,
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"No, that was your advice, was it not</p>

  <p>"My advice?" Florio reviewed the situation swiftly. "Yes, I think it more
  civilized. Why provoke murder or offer murder for a punctilio? You can find
  all you desire in Italy."</p>

  <p>"I intend to try, and there are other countries still open." Lord
  Mountsellis spoke with luxurious self satisfaction. "Then the war can't be
  eternal, Paris will be open again, and Paris equals London."</p>

  <p>"This decision should please many," said Florio, and he thought that his
  own country would be well rid of this man, and many saved from embarrassment
  if he stayed in exile, and that even Colonel Winslow would be secretly
  relieved, for surely now he did not still wish to play the part of an avenger
  seeking blood.</p>

  <p>Lord Mountsellis spoke rapidly of the advantages of his change of plan,
  and dwelt in detail on his schemes for the future that were varied and
  intricate.</p>

  <p>Florio thought that he spoke thus with a light and affected eagerness, to
  distract and confuse observation, as if, while the man himself sat there,
  discoursing negligently, yet with an air of resolution, his spirit was in
  retreat and obscuring its intentions.</p>

  <p>Florio thought, "Here the story ends, then," and the scene of his own
  place came up before him, the palace in Bologna and the Villa Aria, where now
  he could return.</p>

  <p>"And Letty?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Letty must take a settlement and be gone."</p>

  <p>Florio was silent. Though he had himself suggested the reasonable course
  of action that the Englishman was now taking, he, unreasonable himself, found
  he despised the exile for not returning home to face his enemy, for not being
  true to his own barbaric code.</p>

  <p>"I know what you are thinking," said Lord Mountsellis suddenly. "But I'm
  too fond of life to throw it away for the sake of pleasing the notions of a
  parcel of rogues who hate me. Do you think there is one of those who have
  written urging me to redeem my honour, who cares in the least what happens to
  me? No, I'll stay where I am safe."</p>

  <p>"You are wise," agreed Florio dryly. He held up his opal glass with the
  sparkles of light in the golden threads that spangled it, and the blue air
  seeming to lie liquid in it, like wine. "You have every opportunity now to
  enjoy your gifts and likings."</p>

  <p>"And I mean to take them, these opportunities." The Englishman spoke with
  what seemed to Florio a ghastly relish and with a flare of wildness in his
  look that he tried to conceal by turning aside and staring across the azure
  prospect below the terrace and the rocks, the valley with the silver marsh
  waters and the swaying reeds, and the white span and pointed arches of the
  aqueduct.</p>

  <p>"I must ask you again about Letty," said Florio with authority. "I
  suppose, now your mood has changed, you do not want my company that you
  begged for."</p>

  <p>"No, my dear fellow, I don't. I desired you to see me through a hellish
  business&mdash;you're generous, clement and cool, yes, that is what I like
  about you, cool. You seem as if you could keep things off."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Florio, rising. "It will be a relief to me to part from
  you. But first I must know the mind of Letty Winslow. There I must press
  you.</p>

  <p>"How, press me?" Lord Mountsellis spoke sullenly, rising also and staring
  down into the valley.</p>

  <p>"You wished me to stay with you, now you are wishful to be alone. But you
  will not be rid of me until this is faced."</p>

  <p>"She is free to go where she wills," replied the Englishman. "She knows
  it, and so do you. What more is there to say?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. Whatever it is you must hear Letty Winslow say it, and
  before me."</p>

  <p>"Very well," agreed the Englishman. "It is not of the least consequence.
  There is not even any need to keep up appearances, as I shall be dismissing
  this entire household when I return to Palermo. I shall send for Letty and
  talk to Letty, and so may you, and I hope that will be the end of the
  matter.'</p>

  <p>"It must be determined to-night."</p>

  <p>"It shall be." The Englishman spoke in a tone of unexpected brevity. "It
  will serve to pass the time. Upon my soul, I don't know why I came to this
  outlandish seat."</p>

  <p>"You will send for her</p>

  <p>"Immediately&mdash;as I am about to tell the major-domo to disperse the
  establishment I can ask him to send Letty. Where? Not that chamber where I
  slept last night," he glanced, half scornful, half exasperated at Florio,
  "but the yellow <i>salon</i> that I glimpsed last night. I like to have
  settings for these charades, the piece is suitable for the exit of Letty
  Winslow."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch43"
     id="ch43"></a>§ 43</h2>

  <p class="first">Punctual to the hour named, which was that of the sudden dusk, Letty
  entered the yellow <i>salon</i> that ran the length of the back of the house
  and gave on to the ancient castle by means of arches encrusted with mosaics.
  The floor was tessellated in black and white; the furniture, stiffly arrayed
  along the walls, was of walnut and dull yellow satin, the curtains at the
  trefoil windows were of the same material. A large chest covered with red
  velvet stood between these windows, beyond them, either side, were two half
  columns of red marble supporting figures of the genius of Palermo, shown as
  youthful kings, seated in conch shells.</p>

  <p>This grandiose room had long been disused and had the desolate air of a
  place built for festival, then closed away, forgotten. Yellow dust was over
  everything, there were no covers to protect the brocade seats that were faded
  and fraying; the lamp that had been placed on the red chest cast an uncertain
  light and was reflected, in a gloomy fashion, in the looking glass behind it,
  that held also the images of Florio, Philip and Letty, all appearing small
  and out of place in this vast chamber.</p>

  <p>Letty, on her entrance, had flinched back, and remained in the shadows.
  She refused the chair that Florio set for her and remained standing. She
  looked haggardly weary and humble, and only the grace of her carriage and the
  turn of her head, with her red locks piled carelessly up like a crown, made
  her seem above her coarse dress.</p>

  <p>"Letty," said Philip at once, "I am not returning to England. I had a
  sound night's sleep and it cured me of that folly. I shall set up house in
  Rome or Florence until Paris is free. Now, you are not to make a to do of
  this, my dear, but to say directly what settlement you expect to leave me in
  peace."</p>

  <p>Florio, looking at Letty, saw that she had a compassionate expression on
  her tired face.</p>

  <p>"Why do you speak like that?" she asked. "It is no use, you know."</p>

  <p>"I speak at the request of our friend who has taken such an uncommon
  interest in us."</p>

  <p>Letty turned to Florio.</p>

  <p>"But you don't believe that he will stay in Italy?"</p>

  <p>"It was my advice to him. We must not concern ourselves with him, but with
  you."</p>

  <p>"It is all one," she replied.</p>

  <p>Florio regarded her with a powerful emotion of tenderness and pity. "How,"
  he thought, "she troubles and bewilders me."</p>

  <p>"Come, Letty," urged Philip, moodily pacing up and down, "this won't
  do."</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "It won't do to stay in Italy, in exile, in hiding. You
  must return to England. You will keep to your purpose there, of course."</p>

  <p>He turned his back on her, went to the window and looked out into the
  spreading blaze of moonlight.</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?" asked Florio, startled.</p>

  <p>"He must return," she repeated, as if not hearing this question. "And he
  knows it. And all the arguments. I need not run over them again."</p>

  <p>"You should persuade him to stay, you know what awaits him&mdash;he wants
  his life."</p>

  <p>"He wants something else more," said Letty. "I know him better than you
  do, Prince. This is merely a humour, a mood."</p>

  <p>"What has he to lose?" asked Florio. "Consider how he has lived, how he
  must have been regarded."</p>

  <p>"That is nothing. If he returns, <i>when</i> he returns, he will be
  regarded as a man of honour."</p>

  <p>Philip turned and looked at her very keenly.</p>

  <p>"What did it matter before&mdash;he was no one, but now it is a great name
  and a great position and he is expected, by all his equals, to uphold it and
  by all his inferiors, and by those above him, to uphold it. But I'll not
  speak of it any more, of course he will return to England."</p>

  <p>"Have you considered," asked Florio, "that, if he does so return, it may
  mean the death of Colonel Winslow, or the making of a murderer of Colonel
  Winslow?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think of him," returned Letty, "any more than I thought of him
  when I ran away from him years ago. I think only of Philip."</p>

  <p>"She loves him," thought Florio curiously. "She is not considering herself
  at all. What should it be to her whether he goes or stays, unless she loved
  him."</p>

  <p>The character of the woman, more than the woman herself, her personality
  and her situation, had for him an increasing fascination that made him
  oblivious of himself, as he had remarked so keenly, she was of herself.</p>

  <p>He found something almost frightful in the steady unmoving look she fixed
  on Philip, who had now turned to face her, something overpowering in the
  strength of her purpose that quite eclipsed her wretched attire, the
  helplessness and wretchedness of her circumstances.</p>

  <p>These two people, caught and cornered by what was to him a mere barbaric
  notion, mistermed honour, seemed to Florio as if in the intensity of their
  passion they had been transformed into something more than their usual
  vitality. The woman, in particular, seemed to glow with an emotion that made
  her, rigidly as she stood, motionless as she was, like an incarnation of
  fierce energy.</p>

  <p>Both of them had forgotten Florio, who felt that he was of no importance
  to either of them.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Letty," said Philip. "Of a certainty I must return to
  England."</p>

  <p>"You never really hesitated," she replied. "You were drugged or had some
  disturbing dream. Do be gone quickly from this sluggish place. In this quiet
  heat it is hard to keep to any active purpose. You know well what you have to
  do."</p>

  <p>"I do know it, Letty."</p>

  <p>The Englishman turned away again and stood with his back to the room,
  facing the moonlit prospect.</p>

  <p>Letty moved swiftly, as if she had forgotten an important errand, and left
  the room. Florio followed her at once and caught her hand. She turned,
  surprised, glanced at him and exclaimed: "Ah, you!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I," said Florio. "You have made a mockery of my friendship. This
  meeting was to hear what you wished for yourself."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing, never can be, for I am nothing," she answered quickly.
  "Cannot you understand that it is as if I had died&mdash;long ago?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you persuade him to return to England?"</p>

  <p>"I did not persuade him, I merely reminded him. O, it was but a lapsed
  purpose of a few hours!"</p>

  <p>"You choose, then, to have him murdered or a murderer though
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't choose," said Letty, desperately pulling her hand away, "to have
  him scorned and called a coward, and disgraced for me&mdash;cannot you see
  that he <i>knows</i> he must go, and would be most wretched if he did not go?
  That he believes, and I believe, that he <i>must</i> go, and that nothing
  else matters?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing else matters?"</p>

  <p>"What else is there, for either of us? What has there been since we left
  home?"</p>

  <p>"You foil me, at every turn. I can do nothing for you&mdash;how often that
  word 'nothing' comes into our talk!"</p>

  <p>"You can stay with Philip. He needs you, whatever he says."</p>

  <p>"Useless to remind you again of Colonel Winslow."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I tell you I don't think of him. I am too abased, too humble for
  noble thoughts. It will please him to kill Philip or to die
  himself&mdash;didn't he follow us for that? Now we will seek him out. It will
  come to an end at last, all the torment, the misery, the exile, the
  flight&mdash;" she checked her voice, already low, and added in a whisper:
  "We are all very weary."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I am so weary as to leave you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think. I don't think of you at all, or only in as far as you can
  help Philip. Yes, you have been a good friend. It was curiosity, was it not,
  and idleness and a sense of power that made you meddle with us?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that and the pursuit of a dream, idle enough. I always thought
  you loved one another, that had a fascination for me."</p>

  <p>"And now that you know it was a matter of a bet on his part&mdash;and on
  mine&mdash;I don't know."</p>

  <p>"I think I do. I believe that you love him, Letty."</p>

  <p>"Well, there is nothing else. Love? I don't know, I say. Why must you,
  with all your advantages and all you might have, concern yourself with
  us&mdash;with me. But if you must, why then, look to Philip, who needs
  you."</p>

  <p>She was gone into the shadows down the long passage where the moon,
  shining through the trefoil windows, glistened on the encrusted mosaics.</p>

  <p>Florio hesitated. He tried to pretend to himself that he was free to go to
  Bonino and tell him to prepare for the long journey to Bologna.</p>

  <p>He looked at the still, cold prospect beyond the window, the wide valley
  beneath the white aqueduct, the shadows were cold and gloomy, the west wind
  touched with chill, the moonshine outlined the leaves of plane, manna ash and
  carow tree with silver that appeared as heavy as precious metal. Some cool
  distant clouds troubled the distant purple refulgence of the skies.</p>

  <p>Florio was soothed by the silence and the solitude, again he felt the
  essence of his experiences since he had left Bologna to follow the exiles,
  past and present, as in a dream when one image rises from another, dissolves
  into yet a new shape, and so, intermingling, the shadows pass, each
  different, each full of the same meaning.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in dreams, in the centres of their hidden lives, they met, he
  and the Englishwoman; in her very obscurity was a charm to hold him, in her
  humiliation and degradation a purity to move him to a deep tenderness, for
  she had accepted all her losses and misfortunes as if they were of no matter
  at all. She asked nothing, expected nothing&mdash;and again he reminded
  himself how this word "nothing" came into his thoughts of her and his speech
  with her. She had given her all and not counted the cost. She had never
  repined, even in the intense searching looks she had given him now and then
  there was no complaint.</p>

  <p>Florio returned to the yellow <i>salon</i>.</p>

  <p>Philip was seated in one of the worn, splendid chairs, his elbows on his
  knees, his head in his hands. He looked up at once as Florio entered.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had gone," he said sharply. "You don't mean that you are
  staying with me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," smiled Florio. "Will you sleep to-night, or shall I sit with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I shall sleep," said the Englishman, rising. "I'm relieved you are
  staying. It is infernally lonely. No, I shall not sleep&mdash;I have
  preparations for the journey to make."</p>

  <p>"I and Bonino can help you there."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so, but no necessity for false passports now."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think of Letty at all? Her insults and injuries?" asked
  Florio.</p>

  <p>"O, Letty! We never settled what was to become of Letty, did we</p>

  <p>"She is not to be moved from following you."</p>

  <p>"Let her keep out of my sight, though." He spoke in a charming, gentle
  manner and smiled in a fashion that made the rude words sound like a caress.
  "Never mind Letty. I'll see the doctor and the steward and arrange my
  affairs. I'm glad you've stayed," he added and did not ask for how long he
  might expect Florio's company.</p>

  <p class="first">"For humility, acceptance of pain, forgetfulness of self, her actions seem
  to express love, but what is this urging of him unto his doom?"</p>

  <p>"She would have him," replied Bonino, "accept with dignity and courage
  what he cannot escape. It is likely that if he doesn't return, the old man
  would seek him out wherever he may hide."</p>

  <p>"Is it as simple as that?" pondered Florio.</p>

  <p>"It is more simple than you make it, sir."</p>

  <p>"I am going to England with them, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I supposed you would."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you must have seen it, there is nothing else to do."</p>

  <p>"You bear her burden as she bears his."</p>

  <p>"And as you bear mine, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"And you will follow him as I shall follow you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch45"
     id="ch45"></a>§ 45</h2>

  <p class="first">As the four travellers crossed Italy the Englishman's mood changed
  frequently. Though still resolute not to confuse his senses with wine or
  spirit, he frequently took opium that touched his humour now into frenzy, now
  into reckless high spirits.</p>

  <p>He kept Florio constantly with him, and paid no attention to Letty,
  leaving his friend, as he insisted on terming the Bolognese, to arrange the
  fictions of the journey. He, who had been so engrossed in his masquerading
  and charades, so delighted to invent and wear disguises, was now indifferent
  to Letty's awkward and touching appearance as a young scholar who was
  supposed to be acting as secretary to Signor Miola, for Florio had again
  taken that <i>nom de voyage,</i> who for his part, was posing as an Italian
  dilettante, travelling to England to assist a wealthy Englishman in the
  arrangement of his pictures, statuary and coins. Florio could not invent any
  other excuse for the presence of himself and Letty in the company of Philip
  Calamy, who was also content to travel incognito, using the name he had
  assumed when living at Chiaramonte.</p>

  <p>Letty excused a constant withdrawal on the excuse of a sickness that was
  not, Florio thought, entirely assumed and about which Philip cared
  nothing.</p>

  <p>With a heavy scarf wound round her mouth, wrapped in her travelling cloak,
  she retired to her room whenever the party stopped at an inn or post-house,
  and Florio had no opportunity of speaking to her, and knew nothing about her
  mind, save that she was obviously determined to accompany the man who had
  been her lover to England.</p>

  <p>During the night crossing from Palermo to Leghorn a brief storm had risen,
  then Florio had gone to her cabin, fearful of her fear in circumstances so
  terrifying and forlorn.</p>

  <p>He had found her asleep beneath the swaying lantern, looking thin, pale
  and grotesque in her male attire, her red hair hidden under a linen cap that
  she wore constantly under her hat.</p>

  <p>Florio had wondered at her adopting this ugly device, but she would by no
  means cut off her fine curls, even though they had been the cause of her
  ruin. She, by feminine perversity, persisted in cherishing the illusion that
  Philip had once loved her for them, and truly admired what with him had been
  merely the matter of a bet.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that he had seen Letty helpless, unwitting of his
  scrutiny, and he was much moved by the fatigue that held her in slumber even
  through the storm, and by the meekness with which she wore the dull, harsh
  clothes that Bonino had procured for her. Florio had not dared permit her any
  disguise save this, that of an ungainly shuffling lad, for had she come as
  any manner of woman her travelling with the men would have caused a scandal
  and a trouble that would, Florio knew, have roused the Englishman to brutally
  discard her; he only suffered her because she kept out of his way.</p>

  <p>They travelled without servants, using hired couriers and carriages, and
  after that long look in the humble cabin as the packet swung to the southern
  storm, Florio saw little of Letty, who travelled with Bonino who guarded her
  with a scrupulous care, so that those who saw them during the journey often
  remarked on his tenderness to the sickly boy, who gave no trouble certainly,
  but who was no company either.</p>

  <p>Philip engrossed Florio's attention. He would have him sleep in the same
  room with him, Philip often lying fully dressed on a couch or bed while
  Florio held his hand until he slept.</p>

  <p>He was interested in nothing save himself, and often discoursed of his
  properties, income, money in the funds, and the circle of friends who would
  be waiting to make life agreeable for him as if there was no shadow across
  his future.</p>

  <p>At the first stop, Florence, Philip found some letters waiting at the
  agents employed by his lawyers. These, all full of the one theme of his
  return, heightened his excitement.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to credit the different tone people take with me now,"
  he declared, and with a ghastly look he showed Florio one letter that read:
  "As a betting man, my dear Philip, it will amuse you to know that the wagers
  are being laid pretty freely as to whether you'll return, if you'll return
  alone, what will be the result of your meeting with Colonel Winslow. What say
  you to the odds?"</p>

  <p>As the theatre of war had to be avoided and any territory in possession of
  the French, the little party hurried into the Papal States and took little
  pause, bad as the roads, cumbrous as the coaches were, until they arrived at
  Ancona.</p>

  <p>Florio did not mention to Bonino that it would have been possible to make
  a stage of the journey at Bologna, and the servant sighed in secret for the
  fair times past that were gone like a gilded light out of the sky dies at the
  end of day.</p>

  <p>The lengthy, tedious journey irked them all, for different reasons. Philip
  wanted to put his fate to the proof. Florio desired the end of a painful
  companionship, and Letty suffered not only from the humiliation of her
  disguise, and the heavy discomforts of the way, but from the dark blankness
  of the future.</p>

  <p>From Ancona they took a Russian ship, whose Captain was induced by bribes
  to give them a passage to Trieste, where three weeks travel over mountains
  brought them to Vienna.</p>

  <p>There there was a large number of English residents, and though Philip
  preserved his incognito some of them found him out and left cards and
  compliments on him in a buzz of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"You see," he remarked, "how important a creature a lord is. I should not
  be allowed to slip into England unobserved."</p>

  <p>Here he indulged his taste for cards and visiting a public gaming place
  brought back to the inn four hundred rix dollars that he had won.</p>

  <p>Showing these to Florio in a blue net bag as if he displayed a work of
  art, he remarked that he had always been lucky with the cards, and had at one
  time supported himself with his earnings, as he termed them, that had
  amounted to over two thousand a year, "then my luck turned and I took to
  betting."</p>

  <p>"You are the strangest creature," said Florio; he felt a nervous
  melancholy weigh his own humour, and an uncertainty that was at variance with
  his character, as if he was acting in some unfamiliar and repellent drama and
  did not know the words of his part.</p>

  <p>At Vienna Philip first suggested that what he termed "the affair" between
  himself and Colonel Winslow should be made the matter of "total hazard," red
  or black with the cards, or a throw of the dice. He liked this expedient
  better than that of a duel that was but "standing up to be murdered" as the
  old man was so good an aim, and would surely require three shots, so there
  would be no escaping. He was not likely to fire low and think honour
  satisfied. So, in a duel, Philip saw no hope. But in the cards or the dice
  there was a chance, the gambler's chance.</p>

  <p>Florio thought that he spoke wildly, under the influence of opium or a
  frenzy of passion, and did not argue the matter. But at the next halt,
  Dresden, Lord Mountsellis was on this device again.</p>

  <p>He believed, he said, that Colonel Winslow, who had played high in his
  youth, would consider the offer sporting.</p>

  <p>"The loser is to shoot himself within twenty-four hours," he said.
  "Suicide, with a note left explaining the matter, so the winner goes free. If
  it is a duel <i>both</i> lose. There is nothing but exile, hiding for the
  survivor. Besides, to shoot oneself in front of a mirror would be a clean
  thing, but the Devil knows how one might be mauled after three shots from a
  furious man."</p>

  <p>Still Florio could not take this proposition seriously though Philip
  continued to argue it strongly.</p>

  <p>"It could even be made to look like an accident and all be done in a
  gentlemanly way. Colonel Winslow ought to prefer it for his children, as less
  scandal&mdash;at Almacks or Whites it would be considered quite the thing, I
  assure you."</p>

  <p>"And if this fantastic arrangement were made," asked Florio, "how is the
  winner to be assured that the loser will carry out his part?"</p>

  <p>"By God, sir, will he not have given his word?"</p>

  <p>Florio was silent before this flourish, spoken by the man who in a
  ludicrous disguise had cheated, with the most adroit skill, in a common
  gambling hell in Palermo, using as a decoy the woman he, for the sake of a
  wager, had brought down from a secure and brilliant position, to infamy. But
  he could see that Philip was sincere in his notions of honour.</p>

  <p>From Dresden they went to Hamburg and had to wait before they could find a
  merchantman going to an English port willing to take them. And there Philip
  with his own hand, and at his own suggestion, wrote out what he knew was his
  possible death warrant.</p>

  <p>"The Most Honourable the Earl of Mountsellis is returning from the
  continent to his mansion in Hill Street, Piccadilly."</p>

  <p>"I shall send that to <i>The Gazette</i> as soon as we reach England," he
  declared. "I suppose he is already in London waiting for me."</p>

  <p>In Hamburg he perfected his plan for the gamble that was to decide the
  question as to whether he or Colonel Winslow should live.</p>

  <p>"I stake far more than the old devil," he said violently. "He is near the
  end of his life and I've all mine before me as well as a higher rank, a
  larger fortune and brighter wits&mdash;what does <i>he</i> stand to lose
  beside what I offer?"</p>

  <p>The Englishman would not be distracted from this theme. He described the
  clubs that he had frequented in London, Almacks, Whites and the <i>Savoir
  Vivre.</i> The games were chiefly faro and hazard, each player had his dish
  of tea beside him and a bowl to hold the rouleaux of gold, there was seldom
  less than a hundred thousand pounds on the table and one never played for
  less than fifty.</p>

  <p>"And between the play the bet books come out and there are wagers on every
  subject under the sun&mdash;so why not on my life and Colonel Winslow's? I
  swear thousands will change hands when it is known we intend to settle
  matters on a cast of the dice."</p>

  <p>Philip added regretfully that he had never had the fortune to play deep;
  his uncle, whose honours he had just inherited, had at first supplied him
  with funds, but on hearing of his way of life had cut them off.</p>

  <p>"But I was successful," said the Englishman, with a wild smile, "and
  lucky&mdash;he need not have feared for his timber. I knew when to stop,
  also. That was what set me on to the woman, and when I was running down all
  the red-heads I forgot the cards. You cannot conceive, not being a gambler,
  the thrill of emotion I felt when I first saw the wife of my commanding
  officer with red hair&mdash;you're lost now, they said, but
  no&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is raving," interrupted Florio sternly. "You'll need to keep your
  wits better than this."</p>

  <p>"At the London clubs I first learned to use a mask," continued Philip,
  unheeding. "They are worn to conceal the feelings when the stakes are high
  and perhaps a man's whole estate is at issue, with straw hats to shade the
  eyes so that a man's whole face is invisible. When we had to fly from Bologna
  I thought of the mask, and now I dream that if he shoots me in the face and I
  live, I shall have to wear a mask for ever.</p>

  <p>"These are the desperate dreams of opium," protested Florio. "If gamesters
  will not drink, neither should they drug. You abuse the anodyne given
  you."</p>

  <p>Still not heeding, but suddenly clasping the other's hand, Philip
  continued in a hoarse, muttering voice: "I don't want to wait his challenge
  like a fool. Will you go ahead when we land in England, and wait on him with
  this proposal of mine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Florio at once, for he had thought that he would use the
  opportunity of seeing Colonel Winslow, not to make this dissolute and
  extravagant proposal, but to persuade him to a rational solution of the
  fantastic situation.</p>

  <p>"Do you delay a little and I shall certainly attend this unhappy man."</p>

  <p>"It will make a stir in town," remarked Philip with satisfaction. "He'll
  be thought poorly of if he doesn't accept."</p>

  <p>"Have you again forgotten Letty?"</p>

  <p>The Englishman scowled.</p>

  <p>"It will make no difference to her whichever way the hazard falls. I'll
  make a settlement on her, but she must keep out of my sight."</p>

  <p>He fell into an uneasy silence. Florio thought he was trying to forget
  that Letty accompanied them, that this lost, ruined penniless creature was
  always round the corner in the guise of a sickly shambling boy, the red hair
  hidden beneath the ugly linen cap, her thin figure hunched in a clumsy
  cloak.</p>

  <p>Glancing up at Florio sullenly, he spoke at last.</p>

  <p>"She is an obstinate woman. Wild, ungovernable for one so prudishly bred.
  What does she suppose will become of her?"</p>

  <p>"She supposes nothing, neither fears nor hopes," said Florio. "She is
  submissive to providence."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch46"
     id="ch46"></a>§ 46</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio, with difficulty, found an opportunity to speak to Letty. She was
  shy, timid and kept resolutely apart. At the post house in the suburbs of
  Hamburg where the party rested, there was no one to concern himself about the
  characters of the party of four travellers who were, like so many cast about
  by the tumult of war, waiting their passage to England. And the indifferent
  boy who kept to his chamber, forever writing and reading, was little
  considered, partly owing to the address of Bonino who knew how to spread a
  tale, create an impression and keep up an appearance with singular
  adroitness.</p>

  <p>He was the go between, and at first he had to report that Letty refused to
  see Florio, having "nothing to say."</p>

  <p>And Florio's stretched fancy noted again how this word came into
  everything that belonged to Letty.</p>

  <p>Another difficulty was to avoid Philip, who would hardly endure Florio out
  of his presence. Not only did he insist on discussing his brilliant scheme
  for deciding the issue between himself and Colonel Winslow, he longed to
  dwell on all the pleasures that should be his, if his gamble was lucky.</p>

  <p>He was not, he declared vehemently, a besotted gamester who cared for
  nothing but the cards and the betting books, he had other pleasures, elegant
  as well as base. He planned to restore, perhaps to rebuild the splendid but
  old fashioned seats he had inherited, and in particular he relished
  describing Belmore in Wiltshire that had been the scene of his final
  interview with his uncle, when he had gone begging and been denied money or
  any countenance.</p>

  <p>On that occasion he had had angry words with his cousin Edward, lately
  killed in France, and he ran over the circumstances and the zest he would
  have in returning to this place as the master, before the very same servants
  who had seen him "turned away like a dog," for he had sent orders that all
  the staffs in his various houses were to be kept, "and those who were
  insolent to me I'll dismiss myself."</p>

  <p>There were several improvements he wished to make, on the model of
  luxuries he had seen in Italy, and in particular at the Villa Aria.</p>

  <p>He liked, also, to count over his fortune, hundreds of thousands in the
  funds, long rent rolls, rich properties. The Calamys had married heiresses
  for generations and now all the garnered wealth, for they had mostly been
  prudent and careful people, had come to this prodigal.</p>

  <p>For the first time he spoke of his parents; his father, a younger son, had
  been killed in a duel in Ireland where his regiment was stationed, and his
  mother had "died of a broken heart, as they term it when a woman pines away
  in a tantrum."</p>

  <p>But two days after their passage to Yarmouth was arranged on board a
  merchantman flying a neutral flag, Florio did contrive a meeting with Letty.
  She had a room in the attic gable of the old crooked house, floors, walls and
  windows sloped. A large stove of white glazed earthenware gave out a grateful
  heat, for the weather was sharply cold, already the world seemed a different
  one from that in which they had played out their parts in Palermo.</p>

  <p>Letty sat by the window, a favourite post of hers, as if, like a bird in a
  cage, she crouched as near the closed way of escape as possible.</p>

  <p>She was wrapped in her cloak, being ashamed and uneasy in her masculine
  dress. The cap was still over her hair, her features were poignantly
  delicate. She smiled sadly at Florio who sat down by the stove and told her
  the intention of Philip as regards a gamble with Colonel Winslow.</p>

  <p>"He will never agree," she said at once. "This is fantastic, wayward
  talk."</p>

  <p>"I expected that you would say that, but it is not on this rash proposal I
  make my gamble, but on the chance of meeting Colonel Winslow first and
  persuading him into a reasonable attitude&mdash;in brief, not to challenge
  Lord Mountsellis."</p>

  <p>"He will never agree to that either."</p>

  <p>"I shall try," said Florio. "After so much passion and folly, surely, with
  an old man, a man with children to consider&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He won't consider them, any more than I do. They'll have their own lives,
  their own chances in time."</p>

  <p>"There a distracted, wilful woman speaks, Letty. I hoped to bring you some
  comfort by this prospect."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a searching curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Comfort? How?"</p>

  <p>"If Colonel Winslow can be persuaded to forgo this ridiculous duel and
  these fantastic notions of honour, maybe he can be persuaded to divorce you
  and Lord Mountsellis to marry you."</p>

  <p>"O, surely you have been taking opium now!" she exclaimed softly. "Are you
  not yet convinced, after what you have seen, after what I have told you, that
  the great and fashionable world has no place for me? Could you, even you,
  with your generosity and chivalry, dare to find me a place in your own
  society?"</p>

  <p>"No. But money, position, power, can always find a retreat somewhere."</p>

  <p>"You think that Philip might thus forgo all his eagerly grasped fortune to
  retreat from the world with me? You think that?"</p>

  <p>"Your position is owing to him. He has degraded himself by what he has
  done to you. His honour lies, not in blood shedding, but in reparation to
  you."</p>

  <p>"He will never make it, nor do I deserve it."</p>

  <p>"I might persuade Colonel Winslow to force him, perhaps by withholding the
  challenge and offering the divorce on the terms that he, Lord Mountsellis,
  marries you&mdash;he might be forced."</p>

  <p>"You take on yourself the offices of a god," said Letty sadly.</p>

  <p>"I have meddled in your affairs, as Lord Mountsellis continually reminds
  me, and at first it was from idle motives and in a light mood. Now I, too,
  have to make reparation, to you."</p>

  <p>"This is all in your fancy&mdash;it can never happen. My husband will
  insist on the duel, one will be slain and the other ruined."</p>

  <p>"Then why, Letty, will you persist in this tedious unhappy voyage? Look,
  already it is cold, desolate. It is yet open to you to return to Italy, you
  know what is offered you there."</p>

  <p>"No, I must go on, blindly, and take what comes."</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing that I can do for you, Letty?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, when we arrive in England, procure me some women's clothes and a
  maid, and decent lodgings in London. Philip's house is in Hill Street, my
  husband lives at Winslow Park in Surrey, but has a house in Great Queen
  Street, where he seldom goes but he will be there now&mdash;get me some
  lodging close to Hill Street."</p>

  <p>"I do not know the town."</p>

  <p>"I forget. I always forget that you are a foreigner. I'll tell you when we
  arrive."</p>

  <p>He came closer to her and regarded her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Take off that cap, Letty."</p>

  <p>She obeyed at once and the rich locks came falling on to her shoulders,
  making her appear beautiful.</p>

  <p>"This wild talk of bets!" she said. "Philip always liked my hair. I think
  he loved me."</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter now."</p>

  <p>"Surely not. You never notice me in the least, do you?"</p>

  <p>"You are a bounty one takes for granted like the air one breathes."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Letty. What is to become of me when your destiny is
  settled?"</p>

  <p>"You will go home, of course, and forget us all. No, not forget, but
  remember less and less every year."</p>

  <p>She looked at him searchingly, as if she were staring at a portrait and
  wondering if she knew who it was meant to represent, if she could trace some
  teasing likeness to someone once known, once liked, but only faintly
  remembered. Her obsession in the man she followed allowed her only this
  distracted, straining interest in Florio.</p>

  <p>She considered carefully his gentle features, the wide set topaz-coloured
  eyes, the warm-hued hair, the extreme plainness of his dress and his air of
  incomparable distinction, and she tried, like one beating on an imprisoning
  wall, to explain, to excuse why she thought not of him, but of Philip.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I love him," she whispered, then used the word that haunted
  Florio. "He has nothing for me, nothing to give me. A fine face, O, he is
  very well in his person."</p>

  <p>"You need not explain yourself to me, Letty."</p>

  <p>"I want to&mdash;to myself. I think it began because I thought he loved
  me. I had never had that before, someone loving me. My husband loved what he
  believed I was. Philip loved me, I could not resist it. And then fear, fear
  of my husband's return. But, afterwards he said it was not true, but only for
  a bet the deception was enough."</p>

  <p>"Letty, don't think of it now. I shall do something for you yet."</p>

  <p>He did not desire to remain to be a spectator of her forlorn state. She
  seemed to him to be given a kind of innocency by her degradation, set apart
  by that as some might have been by grandeur or virtue.</p>

  <p>He left her surrounded by the books she pretended to read, that he had
  bought at various stages of their travels, and the paper on which she never
  wrote, and he wondered how she passed her time, living like a prisoner.</p>

  <p class="first">Bonino detained his master, who was startled at this obedient servant
  suddenly becoming articulate on his own behalf.</p>

  <p>"When you have put into practice, sir, the plan you confided to me, of
  suggesting this wild bet to the old lord&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Florio interrupted gently.</p>

  <p>"There I shall tell him that, chiefly as an instance of the frenzy of the
  man he wishes to encounter. My purpose will be to suggest magnanimity to
  him."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I understand. Then if you succeed, the young lord will marry this
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Florio smiled at him, remembering that Letty had told him he took
  on the offices of the gods.</p>

  <p>"So, that way the tale is ended. And you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I shall, at last, return home."</p>

  <p>"Yes, at last. And the other way, if there is a duel?"</p>

  <p>"In that event I don't know." Again he recalled what Letty had said. "Who
  will survive? If Lord Mountsellis does he will go into exile again and she
  will follow him."</p>

  <p>"Then you will go home, sir?"</p>

  <p>"In that case, yes, at last, again."</p>

  <p>"And if the young lord is killed?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose she will die, too, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"Then you will go home, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, once more, at last."</p>

  <p>"It has been a long time, sir."</p>

  <p>"How often have I remembered that and asked you to return, I know you have
  your family and friends at Bologna, your way of life, also."</p>

  <p>"It was your way of life I liked, sir, always, I am your servant. I have
  been sorry and jealous and homesick for you."</p>

  <p>Bonino had never spoken so clearly before, and of late Florio had accepted
  him and his service, though affectionately and gratefully, as a matter of
  course. He now looked at him keenly and with remorse.</p>

  <p>"You are homesick, Bonino. Do not stay with me any longer, return to
  Bologna."</p>

  <p>But even as he spoke he knew that it was as hopeless a request as that
  made to Letty to desire her not to follow Philip. They were all set in a
  fidelity at once radiant and obscure.</p>

  <p>But for the moment this was no longer Bonino, the faithful docile servant,
  but a man appealing for his human rights.</p>

  <p>"I cannot face indefinite exile, or the contemplation of seeing your
  excellency forever lost to your rightful place, always laden with a disguise,
  and in hiding, so that oblivion closes over you and Bologna, and all that
  word means is but another name for oblivion."</p>

  <p>"Why, Bonino, I have never heard you speak so earnestly before. I know
  that you often tried to dissuade me but never with this force."</p>

  <p>"The time passes, sir. I seem to hear it fly, while the days are wasted in
  this trivial pursuit."</p>

  <p>"You had no dear or close ties in Bologna," protested Florio, still
  astonished.</p>

  <p>"I yearn, I long for you," replied the servant simply. "For your
  excellency, for the great, grand days, for all your life as it might have
  been, for the wife and children you might have had, that you would have had
  save for these English people."</p>

  <p>"She is not to blame," said Florio sadly. "Do not hate her because of
  me."</p>

  <p>"Have I not been protecting her, even in her present wretchedness, as if I
  were her father? I do not hate her, she is a creature of nothing. The man is
  a villain."</p>

  <p>"There is little good to be said of him, but I forced myself even on him,
  they amused me, aroused my curiosity."</p>

  <p>"The Englishman was the cause," insisted Bonino sullenly, his furrowed
  face was yellowish and looked old, already nipped by the vigours of the
  north. His master had never before noticed so much grey in his hair, nor the
  slight yet notable bowing of his back.</p>

  <p>"You confound me, Bonino, I have taken too carelessly your devotion, but I
  think it was also a devotion to what I stand for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And that you destroy," put in Bonino distinctly in a mourning tone, and
  with a desperate fixing of his glance on the young man's tired face.</p>

  <p>"Bonino, understand, my dear and good friend, that this affair, so tedious
  to you, will be over when we reach England. I have good hopes that Colonel
  Winslow will listen to me and divorce his wife, and forego the duel, and that
  if Lord Mountsellis won't marry her, even then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He never will."</p>

  <p>"So she says. Well, there must be some place, some friend to shelter her
  in her own country. At least, my task will be done. We shall return to
  Bologna."</p>

  <p>"Ah, we shall return to Bologna!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and in the other case, if the duel is forced and one killed and the
  other ruined&mdash;well, the same for Letty, there must be someone in whose
  care I can leave her."</p>

  <p>"And we shall return to Bologna?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Words are poor, insufficient to express my debt to you."</p>

  <p>"O, no," interrupted Bonino in distress, with an impassioned countenance.
  "It has been my sole pleasure to make myself a little agreeable, a little
  useful to you. I have nothing to ask, nothing to regret."</p>

  <p>"Only me, and all I have put aside&mdash;unsubstantial glories to you,
  Bonino, but dearly cherished. I deeply admire this constancy. And I shall not
  disappoint you. Our journey will soon be ended, we shall soon be on our way
  home."</p>

  <p>And while he spoke he meant what he said and pressed the older man's hand
  and then touched his shoulder in a caressing fashion, as if this was one in
  whom he had a complete trust, and the servant believed his master and put
  away his homesick longings and his yearning after all the young man, who was
  his whole existence, had put by, and went on with his duties and the
  travelling that took him ever further from home.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch48"
     id="ch48"></a>§ 48</h2>

  <p class="first">When the four travellers arrived at Yarmouth after a tedious grey voyage,
  Florio at once put in practice his promises to Letty and Philip, although the
  country, the colour of ashes under a slight snow storm, cast a spell of cold
  over his spirit.</p>

  <p>Money and Bonino's adroit ways provided Letty, even in Yarmouth, with
  clothes and a serving woman, and respectable apartments in which to rest. She
  was exhausted and silent, but still whispered her resolve to come to London
  as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Philip, though sombre and wilful, seemed to keep up his spirits by the
  thought of the proposal that Florio was to take to Colonel Winslow. He had
  persuaded himself that this would be accepted and that, in the outcome, his
  luck, that he rated high, would serve him.</p>

  <p>Florio made one last attempt to offer what he considered a reasonable
  comment on this wild affair.</p>

  <p>"If Colonel Winslow should agree to your request and lose and duly shoot
  himself, will not you be abominated?"</p>

  <p>"No betting man would think the less of me," replied Philip. "And all my
  friends are betting men. If it all be done according to the laws of
  honour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Florio stayed to hear no more and set out on his journey through what
  seemed to him a bleak unfriendly country, without grace or delight, to the
  capital.</p>

  <p>He travelled alone, having left Bonino in charge of Letty, and Philip
  preparing his entry into London, that he intended to be, in his extravagant
  style, in a carriage with outriders, so that no one should say he had sneaked
  home. From the Lord Governor he was dispatching couriers to his lawyers,
  stewards and friends, and one, who would ride faster than the post, with the
  notice of his return for <i>The Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>On his arrival in London Florio put up at a small hotel in a narrow street
  that ran from the Strand to the river. This address had been given him in
  Yarmouth and he found it, though to him amazingly dull, plain and austere,
  yet clean, quiet and well suited to his purpose, that was so fantastic, so
  important and secret.</p>

  <p>Having ascertained from <i>The Gazette</i> that they had all seen at
  Yarmouth that Colonel Winslow was in town, Florio wrote a note stating that
  "Mr. Campion might recall Signor Petrionio Miola and their meeting at Bode's
  in Stuttgart. Signor Miola had now a communication to make to Colonel Winslow
  that was a matter of life and death."</p>

  <p>This letter he delivered himself on the first morning after his arrival,
  and the servant, after one glance at him, admitted him into a front room and
  begged him to wait while Colonel Winslow was consulted.</p>

  <p>Florio was shaken by the severe room, with stiff dark furnishings, the
  colourless light falling from the pallid wet morning, the austere silence of
  the house. Everything was of good quality, but of a cold taste and a precise
  arrangement. For the first time Florio savoured exactly what Letty had run
  away from, and he flinched.</p>

  <p>For the first time also he realized the full measure of Bonino's
  homesickness and felt, himself, a longing for his own life, quickly
  suppressed, however, for he had still the most important part of his task to
  fulfil.</p>

  <p>The servant returned at once and Florio was shown into a gloomy room at
  the back of the house that looked on to a narrow garden full of yesterday's
  snow lying in pockets in the sooty earth.</p>

  <p>Colonel Winslow sat behind a desk, a glass fronted bookcase on which the
  cold light gleamed, directly behind him. He wore dark clothes and a fur-lined
  cloak was cast over his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Florio would scarcely have recognized him as the robust gentleman who had
  confronted him in the private parlour at Bode's. His hair was white, his face
  drawn and flushed, his lips unsteady. But he still had a handsome appearance,
  as the wreck of a fine man brought down by suffering while still in his prime
  of life.</p>

  <p>"I cannot rise, Signor Miola," he said at once. "I have had a slight
  indisposition and must keep my chair. Put me at ease by being seated
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Florio observed that his legs were covered by a rug, and that he bowed, in
  a stately way, without offering his hand.</p>

  <p>"I remember," he added, glancing at Florio's note lying on the desk before
  him. "Signor Miola and his excellent English and his misleading information.
  Yes, I remember you very well. How did you, sir, obtain my real name?"</p>

  <p>"First, allow me to tell you my own," replied Florio, seating himself.
  "Miola was a <i>nom de voyage,</i> like Campion. I am Florio, Prince of San
  Quirico."</p>

  <p>Colonel Winslow eyed him steadily.</p>

  <p>"I believe it," he said. "Why should the Prince of San Quirico be
  interested in my affairs?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know myself, Colonel Winslow. But I can assure you it was
  unwittingly. I made the acquaintance of two English people in Bologna,
  without being aware of their true history."</p>

  <p>"I understand you. Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"At Yarmouth, or on their ways, separate ways for some time now, to
  London."</p>

  <p>"Has he sent you to call me out?" asked Colonel Winslow fiercely.</p>

  <p>"No. He is expecting your challenge. He sent me with a proposal."</p>

  <p>"I must be very careful what I say, sir."</p>

  <p>"So must I. It is not my intention to repeat this proposal suggested by
  Lord Mountsellis."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mountsellis! An honoured name is degraded by the present bearer. I
  say this, even if he be your friend."</p>

  <p>"He is not my friend. I think his proposal wicked as well as fantastic. He
  has been living a strange life while in exile, under odd disguise, and lately
  he has been taking opium. He may not be altogether accountable for his
  actions. I agreed to bring this plan to you in order to achieve this
  interview. He would have put many difficulties in the way of my proceeding to
  London. I had to keep him in as reasonable mood as possible."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," interrupted Colonel Winslow, "did he flinch at all&mdash;from
  returning?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Florio. "It is your code, I understand, if he had blenched from
  what he thinks will be death, or mutilation, or ruin, the lady would have
  strengthened his purpose. She, too, follows this code, and she saw nothing
  for him to do but to return."</p>

  <p>"You said they had separated?"</p>

  <p>Florio looked aside from the harsh, strained face.</p>

  <p>"She travels in his company no more. She considers herself lost, and she
  has no lament to make."</p>

  <p>"Come, sir, tell me the purpose of your visit."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I shall not detain you with debate or evasion. I suggest, entirely
  on my own feeling and opinion, that you do not challenge Lord Mountsellis,
  that you divorce your wife, and urge or shame him into marrying her. In
  brief, that you behave like a magnanimous human being, not like a
  barbarian."</p>

  <p>Colonel Winslow was silenced as if by a blow. Florio knew he had said
  something that was, to the Englishman, monstrous.</p>

  <p>"She will never have anything but the name of wife," he continued. "They
  would live apart. But he owes her that&mdash;the worldly position."</p>

  <p>"And what do they owe <i>me?"</i> whispered Colonel Winslow.</p>

  <p>"So much that they can never repay you, so you must forgive them this
  overwhelming debt."</p>

  <p>"You are a foreigner, a Papist. That's it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's it, Colonel Winslow. At this awful crisis consider the point
  of view of a man not of your world. I saved you&mdash;as I thought then, as I
  think now&mdash;from murder once. I want to save you again. For it is murder
  you contemplate, though it is disguised with punctilio."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes murder is justified."</p>

  <p>"I do not think so. A man like you should scorn revenge."</p>

  <p>Weariness settled on Florio like a leaden cloak, he knew from the other
  man's ghastly face that he spoke in vain.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Colonel Winslow did not deign to reply to his visitor's
  proposal.</p>

  <p>"What was it <i>he</i> suggested?"</p>

  <p>Florio would not follow this painful avoidance of names.</p>

  <p>"Lord Mountsellis suggested a fantastic project that I can hardly bring
  myself to repeat."</p>

  <p>"Let me hear it."</p>

  <p>"Why? You will not answer me when I suggest a reasonable adjustment of
  these tangled affairs."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am in no mood for anything reasonable, sir. You have no right
  to interfere."</p>

  <p>"I have. Both these distracted people have asked my help."</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine how you became interested in either of them. You must
  have followed them&mdash;for months."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You have a fancy perhaps for <i>her</i>?" asked Colonel Winslow bitterly
  and coldly. "I should not suppose that she is any longer a fine or a pretty
  woman."</p>

  <p>"No, but there are other qualities besides fineness and prettiness. This
  lady is very meek, accepts her outrageous punishment with great sweetness,
  and has been very faithful to a romantic lover."</p>

  <p>"Faithful! Faithful!"</p>

  <p>"Faithful where she placed her faith."</p>

  <p>"I will not hear anything more of her. Tell me what <i>he</i>
  suggested."</p>

  <p>"Why should I, since you are resolved on this murderous duel? No doubt
  your second has galloped to Yarmouth. I suppose that you are sure of killing
  him."</p>

  <p>"I am a first class shot."</p>

  <p>"Murder, then."</p>

  <p>"You understand nothing of the laws of honour."</p>

  <p>"It is difficult, indeed," smiled Florio gently, "to grasp how powerful
  are these barbaric traditions. On the duel, then, you are resolved."</p>

  <p>"As for the divorce," said Colonel Winslow, "I'll not be troubled. He
  would not marry her if I did, and if he survived until he could."</p>

  <p>"So you all assure me," said Florio gravely. He felt the cold, stiff
  dreary room oppress him. The light was without colour and a universal
  greyness like a blight overspread everything.</p>

  <p>Leaning forward, Colonel Winslow struck the desk with his fist.</p>

  <p>"I demand that you tell me what <i>he</i> suggested."</p>

  <p>"Yes, no doubt I should do so, since he entrusted me with the message. It
  is a folly, fitted to the wild nature of the man and his desperate situation.
  Above everything he dreads this duel. Brave enough, he fears this&mdash;that
  you will aim at his face, and mutilate him. He has no confidence in his own
  skill as a shot and his friends do not fail to tell him of yours."</p>

  <p>"His guilt will make his hand unsteady, he knows that."</p>

  <p>"His guilt! Ah, well, leave the terms. He suggests, being a gambler, that
  you stake your lives on a toss of the dice or a turn of the cards&mdash;total
  hazard, and that the loser shoots himself. All to be in order with
  witnesses."</p>

  <p>Colonel Winslow drooped back in his chair, his hand unclenched itself and
  fell off the desk. A slight distortion passed over his congested face.</p>

  <p>"That suits me very well," he grinned. "I was always lucky in a gamble. It
  was my hope to make him destroy himself. For I can't. This is a fortunate
  chance. I accept."</p>

  <p>"What! You forego the duel for this extravagant folly!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Let him shoot himself," said Colonel Winslow harshly. "For I
  can't."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I can't trust you. A foreigner and a Papist. All respect, but you are too
  reasonable, your ideas are too different from ours. Sufficient that I can't
  fight this duel, or not yet&mdash;finally, yes, I hope. I meant to hold it
  over him, drive him to some frantic action, but this is better, yes, this is
  better."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, at least, if your conscience or anything I have said has stirred
  you."</p>

  <p>"No, no." Colonel Winslow was struggling with some almost overwhelming
  emotion. "No, again. Certainly I meant to challenge him. I hardly know what I
  said just now, nothing would have prevented me. A tiresome, passing
  indisposition hinders me for the moment. But only for the moment. But I
  prefer this, the gamble. I'm a betting man myself."</p>

  <p>Florio could no longer strive with what seemed a final resolve, compounded
  of a wild hope and a spasm of despair. He rose.</p>

  <p>"As a gentleman," added Colonel Winslow, "you are obliged to take this
  message. But it doesn't matter if you won't&mdash;I'll send to him
  myself."</p>

  <p>"I'll take your assent to this desperate proposal. There are limits beyond
  which I can neither protest nor interfere."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Colonel Winslow, bowing and ringing a bell that
  stood on the desk. "Pray," he added, with an effort that caused him to
  grimace, "don't think I doubt your integrity. Different ways of thinking,
  that's all. And I've made a settlement on <i>her,</i> whenever <i>he</i>
  casts her out of his own keeping."</p>

  <p>"And no word of compassion?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know the word, sir. I leave it to women. And she had none, even
  for her wretched children."</p>

  <p>Florio bowed in silence. There was nothing more that he could say. As he
  withdrew, a servant entered and hastened to his master with an anxious
  air.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch49"
     id="ch49"></a>§ 49</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio returned to his modest lodgings, he had no heart to hasten to
  Philip with Colonel Winslow's unaccountable acceptance of his fantastic
  offer, but decided to wait until the new earl arrived in Hill Street.</p>

  <p>Of Letty, travelling to London under Bonino's charge, he could not endure
  to think at all. He tried to shut her out of his mind, but she remained, a
  restless, troubled phantom, haunting, unbided. The day musings and the night
  dreams he could not control.</p>

  <p>The city suffocated his spirit. The heavy marsh air, the sluggish grey
  river, the narrow streets, the houses like grey rocks in the early twilight,
  the vaporous sky, the sun and moon shrouded in mists and without radiance or
  colour, the pressure of the alien crowds, all about business or pleasures of
  which he knew nothing and from which he felt excluded, as if he were a ghost
  returned to earth, mingling among men and unseen, unheard and unthought
  of.</p>

  <p>This was not the London of his imagination. Of all the halts on his
  travels, this was the most melancholy. Here he felt truly exiled, as if
  indeed there was now no way home.</p>

  <p>He knew that he had himself made the city the drop cloth of his mood, and
  that every amusement and interest was open to him if he but cared to use his
  name as passport to all that English society offered. He was isolated because
  he remained in strict incognito, without even a body servant, in a humble
  hotel, and when he went abroad he was but an unremarked member of the
  indifferent press of foreigners passing to and fro.</p>

  <p>Twenty-four hours after he had visited Colonel Winslow Florio went to Hill
  Street, where Mountsellis House, a handsome baroque mansion, stood back from
  the road before a half-moon gravelled drive and two-pillared gates.</p>

  <p>A light fall of snow had outlined the snags of stone fruit and flowers,
  the masks and scrolls on the façade of the grandiose mansion, and a strong
  wind blew thin grey clouds into shreds in a sky of pallid blue.</p>

  <p>Several carriages blocked the court. Florio made his way between them, a
  quiet figure among the liveried servants.</p>

  <p>The door stood open and Florio was admitted without difficulty. The new
  lord was evidently accessible to all, and a number of elegantly-dressed men
  and officers in regimentals were passing up and down the curving double
  stairs.</p>

  <p>Florio thought this a painful indecency on the part of Philip to be thus
  ostentatiously public, and wondered if his reason might not be unbalanced by
  his hideous position and the uncertainty of his life.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these former friends of Captain Calamy were gay, laughing,
  jesting, with every sign of satisfaction as if they enjoyed some amusing
  scandal of the moment.</p>

  <p>Florio entered the first room and saw the new lord surrounded by his
  flatterers, amid handsome furnishings from which the covers had been hastily
  removed.</p>

  <p>When he noticed Florio coming towards him he burst out laughing, and
  whispered to his companion.</p>

  <p>He was richly dressed in a fashion outlandish and distasteful to Florio,
  and his remarkable good looks were animated by radiant high spirits. He
  turned to glance at Florio with an extraordinary intensity of expression, as
  if he were filled with malicious pleasure.</p>

  <p>All his disguises and all the different places where he had met him were
  fused in Florio's imagination into one monstrous scene, the gambler behind
  his table with his cards, his betting book, his dice.</p>

  <p>"Come aside," said Florio and drew him, by a touch on the arm, into the
  window place, while, in a sudden silence, the company followed them with
  curious stares.</p>

  <p>"He accepts," added Florio. "I must tell you that. I have no more to
  say."</p>

  <p>"What did he accept?" Philip laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Your proposal of the bet."</p>

  <p>Philip glanced beyond Florio at the company beyond him as if inviting them
  to share some excellent jest.</p>

  <p>"There'll be neither bet nor duel, my dear fellow," he said, raising his
  voice. "Colonel Winslow is dead."</p>

  <p>His friends took up the words and murmured them among themselves as if in
  mockery&mdash;"Colonel Winslow is dead."</p>

  <p>"It is only a day ago that I saw him!" cried Florio.</p>

  <p>"He died last night, of a stroke. The news of my approaching visit to
  London, I suppose. You see," and Lord Mountsellis spoke with great relish,
  "he could not have challenged me. He fell down in his shooting gallery two
  weeks ago and has been paralyzed, unable to stand, ever since."</p>

  <p>"That is why he grasped at the gamble."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. You say he did? It was his only chance. But I should have
  withdrawn. One can't gamble with a sick man." His brilliant face glowed with
  malice. "Alive or dead, he was harmless to me."</p>

  <p>Florio remembered that Colonel Winslow had said, "I can't fight him," and
  refused to disclose the reason.</p>

  <p>"He kept his disability a close secret," added Philip. "But at his death
  it came out, and the town is ringing with it."</p>

  <p>Florio looked round all of them, then drawing the smiling Philip closer
  into the window place said sternly: "Lower your voice, speak
  softly&mdash;what of <i>her</i>?"</p>

  <p>The other answered swiftly in a soft fury.</p>

  <p>"Anything of her as long as she doesn't trouble me again. If she
  <i>does</i> trouble me my servants will turn her away. I've made her a
  settlement. As for you, sir, I don't require your company any more. I'm free
  of all annoyances now and I have the world to play with. I wish you
  good-bye."</p>

  <p>He bowed slightly and turned abruptly to join his companions, leaving
  Florio standing alone against the cold grey space of the outer air framed in
  the dark red of the long stiff curtains.</p>

  <p>Then Philip looked back over his shoulder and laughed softly again.</p>

  <p>"If this foreigner were a fellow of spirit you'd have a duel on your hands
  after all," said one of his companions loud enough for Florio to
  overhear.</p>

  <p>"O, he knows I mean no harm," sneered Philip. "And he'd scorn murder, as
  he terms it! Murder! Not a pretty thing! And it's not coming my way after
  all!"</p>

  <p>"I don't like to hear you speak like that, Mountsellis," said another of
  the group about him, and the speaker, an older man, came forward and walked
  beside Florio out of the room.</p>

  <p>"An ugly affair," he remarked carefully. "The fellow has been drinking too
  much&mdash;he's not used to it, he was always sober but he feels like one
  reprieved from death."</p>

  <p>"I thank you for your courtesy," said Florio as he stood at the head of
  the stairs. "This is not the ending to the story I expected&mdash;reprieved,
  I suppose he is."</p>

  <p>"Colonel Winslow has been ill for a long time, but he kept the serious
  state of his health concealed. Now, this shock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, shock," smiled Florio sadly.</p>

  <p>"He saw Mountsellis escaping him. No one would have taken his
  challenge."</p>

  <p>"This is a splendid mansion," said Florio. "A splendid array of servants,
  a large number of visitors. Lord Mountsellis is an extremely rich man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. One can understand he does not want to leave all this." The elder
  man indicated the scene, the people, and raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Your society will receive him?"</p>

  <p>"As you see."</p>

  <p>"But surely there are some&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Colonel Winslow has his friends, of course."</p>

  <p>A touch of reserve chilled the geniality of the speaker. Florio saw he had
  gone to the limits of his condescension to a foreigner whom he had tried to
  relieve in an awkward position.</p>

  <p>Florio went slowly down the curved, gleaming marble stairs with the curved
  shining brass banisters, and unnoticed by the press of people hurrying to
  congratulate a twice fortunate man, out into the winter grey, the steady
  wind, that stung his face like a blow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch50"
     id="ch50"></a>§ 50</h2>

  <p class="first">Bonino was waiting in the modest little hotel in the side street. He
  hunched his shoulders and shivered, even under his thick top coat, and
  murmured against the colourless light, the penetrating cold, the hideous
  city.</p>

  <p>He looked at his master as if he hardly recognized him. Their alien and
  detested surroundings seemed to disguise them one from the other.</p>

  <p>"I have taken the lady and her woman to rooms in Dover Street," said
  Bonino; his tired eyes appealed for mercy, for compassion. "When do we go
  home?" he murmured softly, as if he moaned.</p>

  <p>Florio, to whom, in his own preoccupation, Bonino was now again only an
  efficient instrument ready to his hand, did not hear this agonized protest
  against a protracted exile.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that Colonel Winslow is dead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, at the first post we stopped near London; such a thing goes about
  like a spurt of wild fire. The drawing-rooms, the kitchens! All must have
  their say. The town was agog over this duel."</p>

  <p>Florio put his hand before his eyes but could not shut out the picture of
  the stern, harsh old man, in his gloomy room, concealing his weakness so
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>It was in his shooting galley he had fallen down, robbed of his long
  nourished revenge while practising the deadly skill that was to fulfil it,
  grasping at a gambler's chance, and losing even that through being snatched
  away by death.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Florio as if Colonel Winslow had been treated with great
  indecency by the blind fury.</p>

  <p>"Does she, Mrs. Winslow, know?"</p>

  <p>"I could not keep it from her. And her mood was too heavy to be well able
  to feel further trouble. She said that it was well that there was to be no
  murder, that he was on in years and had suffered long enough, and that his
  sisters would care for the children, who had been taught to hate their
  mother."</p>

  <p>Florio was silent, all the past was coiling about his spirit in phantom
  shapes.</p>

  <p>A shadow filled the high, narrow room, cast from the dark houses across
  the mean sloping street. The wind rattled the window frames, and crept, cold,
  under the ill-fitting door.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more to do, sir?" asked Bonino anxiously.</p>

  <p>Florio glanced at him, again not hearing, being engrossed in other
  matters.</p>

  <p>"I must go to her," he said. "I suppose she has no friend, not one, in
  this country."</p>

  <p>Bonino shrugged his hunched shoulders, as if he would protest once more
  that he had done with all of it and would be away.</p>

  <p>"I did what I could," he said. "The house was recommended to me at the
  post. It is a respectable place, but the lady cannot remain long without
  gossip and being discovered. She takes what was her own name of Considine,
  that was her own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I never knew her own name. Odd, I never thought to ask. Letitia
  Considine&mdash;how little I know of her after all, of her family, where she
  came from, how she lived."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing worth knowing, sir."</p>

  <p>"What do you say, Bonino? No, perhaps not. I must go to her&mdash;where is
  this street? And how shall I find the house?"</p>

  <p>Bonino described the place, near to Mountsellis House, as she had
  wished.</p>

  <p>"She must not go to him," exclaimed Florio, starting up. "I forgot she
  might do that. He is implacable, and will have her turned away by his
  lackeys. He is like a man bewitched by his good luck."</p>

  <p>"And is this villain to go free, unpunished!" cried Bonino in a sudden
  burst of passion that caused his master to notice him at last.</p>

  <p>"He has won the gambler's throw with fate, Bonino. Leave him to the next
  hazard. I have something else to think of. He turned me out of his house,"
  added Florio, picking up his cloak and smiling.</p>

  <p>"Ah! And he was clinging to you in his cowardice!"</p>

  <p>"That is over. He is overwhelmed by flatterers." Florio paused, having
  already forgotten Lord Mountsellis. "Stay, I'll not break in on Mrs. Winslow
  so soon. Do you go to her, Bonino, tell her I shall come in a few hours time,
  and she is to keep herself close."</p>

  <p>"What will you do with her demanded Bonino.</p>

  <p>"What I must." Florio's sad smile deepened. "But I shall keep my promise
  to you, Bonino, we shall leave England."</p>

  <p>"Then, in the name of all the saints, my dear master, let us begone as
  soon as maybe, and dispose of this lady quickly&mdash;there must be some
  retreat for her."</p>

  <p>"There is, Bonino. I know of it."</p>

  <p>Bonino went heavily on his errand, and Florio, with a shudder of distaste,
  went into the cold bedchamber and lay down on the traveller's bed, with the
  image of Colonel Winslow, stiff and sheeted in that other gloomy room in that
  other gloomy house in the gloomy city. The proud man had died defiantly from
  excess of passion, and Florio thought: "I should have allowed him to follow
  and murder him, all those months ago in Stuttgart, where the vines had so
  powerful a scent. Why do I remember that? And looking from the window at
  Bode's at the travelling coaches below. And Wilhelmsruhe, and the Forest, an
  empty window with a posy of flowers, an empty chair and a shawl, an empty
  summer house and an empty grave."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch51"
     id="ch51"></a>§ 51</h2>

  <p class="first">The wind had blown out of the sky and the vapours had soon drifted up from
  the river and thickened the evening as Florio came by the palace and up St.
  James's Street.</p>

  <p>The public lamps were few and gave out uncertain haloes of misty light and
  cast uncertain pools of shadows. Some of the wide windows of the houses were
  brightly lit and there was a hurry of passers by.</p>

  <p>Florio found his way slowly, in this city utterly strange to him. Several
  times he started, thinking he was again at the gates of Mountsellis House;
  these English mansions much resembled one another. He endured an almost
  intolerable loneliness and his step hesitated, as much because of the pain he
  bore as because of his doubtful knowledge of his neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>He felt as if the young man who had left Bologna to follow, out of a light
  compassion and a light curiosity, two foreigners in their headlong flight,
  was dead, and he a ghost who had usurped the place of Florio San Quirico.</p>

  <p>How long and devious the way had been, from his home to this strange city,
  with how many strange halts and pauses, how many strange shifting scenes.</p>

  <p>He stopped as a crowd of gentlemen cut across his path, descending from
  carriages to enter a wide doorway. Among them was Lord Mountsellis, his
  brilliant, laughing face was for a moment in the lamplight and was gone. His
  laughter seemed to echo after him in the dull, heavy air.</p>

  <p>Florio asked a passer-by, what was the name of that house, the fellow
  stared at him and said it was White's, the gambling club.</p>

  <p>Florio went on his way, enveloped in the rising mist.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch52"
     id="ch52"></a>§ 52</h2>

  <p class="first">Bonino was waiting in the quiet hotel room, over him also the marsh
  vapours were floating, for he had the window open and was listening for a
  well-known footstep, watching for a well-known form. He was oblivious to
  everything in the monstrous city save his master, who must be returning soon,
  soon now.</p>

  <p>To-morrow they could take the coast road. Bonino had packed the valises
  and got the papers in order, well performed his long practised duties of a
  servant.</p>

  <p>He primed a travelling pistol that he had never used and set it in the
  case. He rubbed up a small dagger that had never been either rusted or
  stained. His master smiled at these weapons when he chanced to see them, and
  to Bonino himself they meant nothing but a matter of routine. Florio was
  always unarmed.</p>

  <p>It was to pass the time that Bonino looked to these things now, glancing
  now and then at the white-faced clock with the black hands and figures on the
  dingy mantel-shelf.</p>

  <p>When there was no longer anything that he could do, he took a little
  crucifix from his breast, kissed it and prayed.</p>

  <p>Then he closed the window, suddenly conscious of the freezing cold, the
  raw mist.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch53"
     id="ch53"></a>§ 53</h2>

  <p class="first">Bonino looked sharply at his master, as if trying to surmise his
  intention.</p>

  <p>Florio, filled with exultation, stood absorbed, thinking of the future
  that suddenly appeared to him fair and still, as if dense clouds had parted
  before a serene perspective, radiant with distant sun.</p>

  <p>"I have been confused," said the servant, "by the deceit of many
  people."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that? Have you everything ready for our departure?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I am well used to these preparations for a journey."</p>

  <p>"I know. And you know, Bonino, there is no reward that I would not give
  you for what you have done for me."</p>

  <p>"There is one. I desire to return to Bologna."</p>

  <p>"So you may."</p>

  <p>"I do not desire to go alone. I desire you to return to take up your old
  life, sir, that alone was worthy of you."</p>

  <p>Florio looked at him and sighed gently. He saw not the servant with the
  childhood's name, but Bonaventuro Bertini of a substantial family, bred in
  the service of the house of San Quirico, who had given up everything in order
  to serve himself, Florio, sole heir of that name.</p>

  <p>At that moment Florio felt that he had taken too much from this ageing
  man. For years it had been a matter of course to have this efficient devotion
  at his command, recently their relationship had altered. Bonino had given
  more than could ever be repaid. Florio stirred uneasily under the weight of
  the debt.</p>

  <p>"You have more loyalty to my duties, as you assume them to be, than I have
  myself, Bonino."</p>

  <p>"So it would seem, sir."</p>

  <p>They spoke in Italian, and the formal third person used by the servant put
  an artificial distance between them, out of keeping with these dingy alien
  surroundings. Florio felt perplexed, even dismayed at something, he knew not
  what, in the other man's demeanour.</p>

  <p>"You can return to Bologna when you will, Bonino; it is a long way, but
  you can travel luxuriously."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean, sir, that I am to go alone?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot go. I confide in you what I shall confide in no other."</p>

  <p>"You wish me to leave you?"</p>

  <p>"No, not that, but my plans are changed."</p>

  <p>"Ah! And it is because of the woman?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to marry Mrs. Winslow."</p>

  <p>Bonino shrunk away, putting out his hands in a piteous gesture of self
  defence, then dropping them as if aware that all defence was useless.</p>

  <p>"You can never take her to Bologna."</p>

  <p>"I know that. Not for years, at least. For me, also, there is no way
  home."</p>

  <p>"It is not for me to put questions."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have the right, but I hardly know what I could answer. She means
  something to me that is perhaps more than love, if you can understand
  that."</p>

  <p>"A fascination, it was from the first," replied Bonino sombrely. "An
  enchantment."</p>

  <p>"No, not that. Yet I could not be sure. Perhaps an overmastering
  pity."</p>

  <p>"And a turn for the extravagant gesture," said the servant. "You always
  used to pour your purse into the cap of the beggar&mdash;even one gold piece
  was not enough."</p>

  <p>"I cannot think of anything else, it is a haunting."</p>

  <p>"And this&mdash;lady&mdash;" Bonino spoke with cold irony, "&mdash;has
  discovered, as ladies in her plight do, that she is no longer amorous of the
  brutal Englishman?"</p>

  <p>"She is lost, ill, hopeless, but relieved that there has been neither
  murder&mdash;though she does not term the <i>duello</i> that&mdash;nor
  dishonour, as she thought Lord Mountsellis would have incurred had he refused
  to return to England."</p>

  <p>"And this marriage, one of the finest in Europe, is to her but a cloak for
  her fatigue and her degradation?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Winslow does not know herself why she accepts me. She is very tired.
  Her story has had an unexpected ending, she was prepared to die if either of
  these men had been killed. She is scarcely prepared to live. Perhaps she will
  not succeed in doing so."</p>

  <p>"Where will you take her</p>

  <p>"Disguises again, Bonino. By slow stages to Switzerland, perhaps, or
  perhaps to Rome or Florence&mdash;where the war allows."</p>

  <p>"You have thought of what you forfeit?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all I had, all I was&mdash;and for one who is indifferent. I may
  resign everything but enough money for us to live on modestly. My distant
  cousin, Biagio, would do very well."</p>

  <p>"You cheat yourself of children who can inherit."</p>

  <p>"That is part of it. I am not the man for the position I had, Bonino, or I
  should never have shirked it."</p>

  <p>There was silence. Bonino turned to the valises and drew the straps
  tighter, he seemed to be listening intently to some inner promptings to
  action that he could scarcely grasp, and he frowned in his concentration as
  was his custom when taking to heart his master's instructions.</p>

  <p>"One thing more, Bonino. Will you come with us, as my friend?"</p>

  <p>Florio put his hand on the other man's shoulder. Bonino lifted a livid and
  troubled face.</p>

  <p>"Does the Englishman escape&mdash;everything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he has indeed won his toss with fortune. He has kept his code by
  returning, and his enemy has been removed by death. He is callous,
  triumphant&mdash;hard to credit how he once implored me to stay with him. I
  saw him, with his flatterers, just now."</p>

  <p>Florio recounted how he had met Philip Calamy (as he still thought of the
  man) going into the gaming house in St. James's Street, and he described the
  place exactly, for the incident had impressed him deeply and remained before
  his mind like a picture seen in a flash and then obscured.</p>

  <p>"So, Bonino, the wicked are not always punished&mdash;this is what the
  priests would term a wicked man. It is Colonel Winslow who lies dead."</p>

  <p>"And the young lord murdered him, and ruined his silly wife, and has
  ruined you and me."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Bonino, this is but your mood. You have these humours, they will
  pass, nothing can part us." Florio smiled affectionately. Urbane and affable
  he again touched the servant's shoulder and passed into the other room, where
  he sank down in the worn arm chair where so many travellers had rested, took
  his face in his hands, set his elbows on his knees, and considered as to the
  means for a speedy marriage with Letty and a speedy departure from this grey,
  cold country that would always, in his mind, be associated with the sinister
  and beautiful Philip Calamy.</p>

  <p>He thought also of his future life and how he could make it useful, in a
  new century, stripped of all the trappings of the ancient ways he had
  outgrown.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch54"
     id="ch54"></a>§ 54</h2>

  <p class="first">Florio, early at Letty's lodgings, was much preoccupied with his own
  affairs. He would need to reveal himself to several people and use all his
  influence to rescue Letty without scandal. He counted, as a matter of course,
  on Bonino's help. Last night the faithful servant had been tired, what he had
  said was not to be remembered. He would soon recover from his disappointment
  at not returning to Bologna.</p>

  <p>Florio had not disturbed him, but had left the quiet hotel in the side
  street without opening the door of the closet where Bonino slept.</p>

  <p>Letty was exhausted, also. The woman and the surgeon who attended her with
  a curiosity Florio paid them highly to conceal, suggested that she should be
  left in seclusion sleeping in her hired bed. Florio agreed. He had nothing
  more to say to her.</p>

  <p>The snow fell heavily, covering the mud and dirt of the grey city with a
  transient purity, and casting an unreal white light into the rooms that
  looked on to yards and streets. Florio felt shut in by the veil of flakes
  that made him slightly dizzy as he looked at them swiftly descending. He
  thought of the shrouded room where Colonel Winslow must be lying in his grave
  clothes, and wished himself out of this alien city.</p>

  <p>With the intention of arranging for his marriage in a Roman Catholic
  chapel, he waited on the envoy of the King of Naples and made himself known.
  He was received with cordiality, but astonishment, as if his story was well
  known.</p>

  <p>"Before the husband is buried, and while the lover lives," smiled Florio.
  "It is odd, but it must be. A question of convenience, of passports."</p>

  <p>The envoy, who was a former acquaintance, interrupted.</p>

  <p>"The lover does not live. Lord Mountsellis was murdered last night."</p>

  <p>As Florio did not speak, but sat confounded, the other went on easily: "O,
  a simple affair, but his rank and his theatrical return make it a nine days
  wonder. The town buzzes."</p>

  <p>"A <i>duello?"</i> asked Florio faintly, pressing his handkerchief to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;a footpad. He was gambling at one of the clubs in St.
  James's&mdash;exultant, as one understands&mdash;he had been drinking too,
  against his custom, and boasted of his habit, acquired in our country, of
  opium taking. He seemed, his wild companions say, to be extravagant, even in
  that place. His flatterers thought him a little drunk, possibly drugged."</p>

  <p>"Why should he be drugged, in his triumph?"</p>

  <p>"There is some gossip about that he spoke of the ghost of Colonel Winslow
  coming for him."</p>

  <p>"That is not like him, he had no remorse."</p>

  <p>"But fear, eh?"</p>

  <p>Florio rose.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the rest, and quickly."</p>

  <p>"Not much to tell. He won, large sums, and laughed at his luck. About
  three o'clock this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When I was asleep at last&mdash;asleep."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the city asleep except for these rakes. A decent looking man, but
  muffled and whose person was not observed closely, left a message for Lord
  Mountsellis, a note in a stiff hand to state that Colonel Winslow waited for
  him behind Montague House, a favourite place for these <i>duello."</i></p>

  <p>"A hideous jest!"</p>

  <p>"So it was held to be, but the besotted young man was moved to bravado,
  and then to fear, and at last bravado again and would go out, alone. He was
  warned, of course; there have been many crimes of violence in London lately,
  and he insisted on taking his winnings with him, all his pockets full of
  gold. The gamblers were over excited by then, and began to lay bets as to
  whether the ghost would keep the tryst or not."</p>

  <p>"He went, at last, alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and with a small lantern only, you know how dark the night was. He
  remarked constantly that he'd be killed if the luck was against him,
  willingly, but not mutilated, and he wore his gambling mask, as if it were a
  vizor, and a straw hat with flowers, as is the barbaric custom of the
  fashionable gamblers here."</p>

  <p>"Did no one follow him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;the more reasonable, almost at once. They stumbled over him, at
  the corner, by the footpath posts, stabbed through the back."</p>

  <p>"A robber hiding in a doorway, who had set the trap."</p>

  <p>"One supposes so." The envoy shrugged. "But the gold was spilled out of
  his pockets, untouched."</p>

  <p>"The footpad had not had time to take it, hearing the others approach,
  seeing their lights, he had fled."</p>

  <p>"But he had had time to do something else. The handsome face beneath the
  mask had been slashed across and across&mdash;an un-English crime these
  Londoners say."</p>

  <p>The envoy looked thoughtfully at Florio, who smiled faintly and said: "No,
  my friend, it was not I, who did not even desire the death of this brutal
  man. He no longer concerned me."</p>

  <p>"O, it was a common robber, of course. What makes the talk is that this
  fellow should have known that Lord Mountsellis was once afraid of a
  <i>duello</i> with Colonel Winslow, valued his good looks and dreaded
  mutilation, and known also where he was."</p>

  <p>Florio, thinking rapidly, took his leave, after arranging for his
  marriage. He believed that he could get c Letty out of the country without
  her knowing of this end to the story of her lover. Dark, sombre, like an
  empty theatre when the actors have gone, the city would be left behind them
  for ever.</p>

  <p>Hurrying through the snow, he returned to his gloomy rooms in the quiet
  hotel.</p>

  <p>As he had expected, there was a letter for him, left on Bonino's empty
  bed.</p>

  <p>"As I believe you would wish, I have taken provision for my journey. Do
  not inquire after me. My papers are in order and my accounts are
  settled."</p>
