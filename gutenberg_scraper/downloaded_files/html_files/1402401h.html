  <p class="note">The following is the Obituary of George Hurdis Purves, published February 23, 1889 in The Australasian.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>DEATH  OF MR. G. H. PURVES.</b></p>
  <p>Mr.  George Hurdis Purves, who has been ill for some months, died early on Thursday,  February 21, at his residence, Drummond-street, Ballarat, and the news of his  death was received by the community with profound concern. The Ballarat Stock  Exchange, of which he was the chairman, adjourned for the day, and flags were  placed at half-mast on some of the principal buildings. Mr. Purves became  unwell some months ago, and early in December he was compelled to absent  himself from the Exchange, as his indisposition assumed a very serious  character. The spleen was affected, and his medical advisers found that the  only chance for him lately lay in the radical operation of severing that organ.  This was performed on Sunday by Mr. T. N. Fitzgerald, surgeon, assisted by Dr.  Morrison and several local medical men, and for the first two days the patient stood  the strain very well. On Wednesday, however, he slowly sank from exhaustion,  and died next morning at about 3 o'clock. Mr. Fitzgerald visited him on  Wednesday night, and his brother, Mr. J. L. Purves, Q.C., was with him up to  the end. The deceased gentleman was 42 years of age, and he leaves a widow and  four children.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Purves's death is a great loss to Australian literature. He was a highly capable  story-writer, having a vigorous style and keen powers of observation. Many of his  sketches were transcripts of actual scenes, with variations introduced merely  to prevent the parties concerned from being identified with living individuals.  At the same time, he had large powers of imagination and invention, and all his  plots and characters were his own creation&mdash;or drawn from nature. Mr. Purves was  engaged upon a novel at the time he fell ill&mdash;one that we had hoped to place  before the readers of <i>The Australasian</i> in the course of the present year. A number of short stories from his pen have  appeared in this journal. The principal one was the illustrated Christmas story  of 1887&mdash;&quot;The Squatter King&quot;&mdash;which had what many readers might  consider a disappointing ending, an ending that did not wholly satisfy Mr.  Purves's own judgment. He felt cramped in the concluding chapters by having to  keep within a limited number of columns, and thus was prevented from making the <i>d&eacute;noument</i> as effective as he had wished.  Although Mr. Purves gave most of his time to business&mdash;having the cares of a  household to provide for&mdash;his heart and soul were devoted to literature, and his  highest ambition was to become a novelist. He had many high qualifications for  the literary calling, and, we have no doubt, would have achieved his desire  before long. His death, at the age of 43, was, in truth, untimely. During his  last stay in London, when trying to obtain a connection with some of the  magazines, Mr. Purves formed the acquaintance of several leading novelists, who  gave him many a friendly hint, the one whose advice seems to have been of the  most service to him being Mr. James Payn. He took some pride in putting Mr.  Payn's suggestions to practical use. Between Mr. Purves and <i>The Australasian</i>, the most cordial  relations existed, and he was aware that our columns were available for  everything that he could find time to write.</p>

  <h1><a name="firstmurder"></a>MY  FIRST MURDER.</h1>
  <h2>By  George Hurdis Purves.</h2>
  <h3>Published in The Australasian, Melbourne, Vic.<br>
    Saturday, May 29, 1886 and Saturday, June 5, 1886</h3>
  <p>I  believe that mine is a unique case, but, if not, it is the only one that I have  ever heard of. Men whose lives have been spoilt by their failures are common  enough, but how many are there whose existence has been rendered insupportable  by success? Yet this is <i>my</i> case, and I  drag a lengthening chain of dissatisfaction because I was forced to earn a  victory where defeat&mdash;constant defeat&mdash;might have made me a comparatively happy  man. Do not turn from this page, gentle reader. Do not shrink from reading my  story, classing me as you do so with Palmer, with Brinvilliers, with the  Borgias. Though I am weak and nervous, though I lack resolution and self-assertion,  I am not a bad man, and I am, I confidently assert, undeserving of the fate  that I have met.</p>
  <p>I  was perfectly aware, long before my mother-in-law told me so, that I was &quot;marrying  above me&quot; when I led the blushing Winifred Drisbergh to the altar, but, <i>at the time</i>, it was a pride and a pleasure  to acknowledge it. Thus I felt no annoyance when Mrs. Drisbergh, drawing me  aside, after we had partaken of a somewhat frugal wedding-breakfast, put the  case to me in, I must admit, a slightly unpalatable form.</p>
  <p>&quot;John  Smith,&quot; she said in her verdict-with-the-black-cap manner, &quot;never  forget that you have this day married a Drisbergh. Do not imagine because the  Drisberghs are poor, and their daughters for the last few generations have not  been dowered as in the palmy days of old, that you are conferring a benefit on  our daughter (Mrs. Drisbergh always used the plural as if she were of Royal  blood) because you yourself are in affluent circumstances. Remember that wealth  is eminently plebeian unless associated for many years with broad acres. Riches  may be at times a subject of congratulation&mdash;of pride <i>never</i>. Birth is the only attribute which gives a right to <i>pride</i>, and, though I say it with all  modesty, not wishing to make a point of <i>our</i> descent, it is <i>the</i> thing which is far  above rubies.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  stammered out that I was not likely to forget it (which was quite true, whilst  she was at my elbow), and that I fully recognised that I had contracted an  alliance far above what I might have expected.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  am glad to hear you say so,&quot; she said, still in that awe-inspiring voice.  &quot;Your obscure origin&mdash;excuse me for putting it so plainly&mdash;is certainly a  matter of regret, but during your honeymoon I shall review your social  position, and consider what can be done to ameliorate it.&quot;</p>
  <p>That  was the last thing she said to me before we drove away, and it amazes me <i>now</i> to recall the indifference with  which I heard the words&mdash;words which were to exercise such an important  influence on my life. But I was carried away by the intoxication of the moment.  As we drove to the station I thought of nothing but the blushing maiden at my  side, and deemed myself the luckiest dog in the world!</p>
  <p>We  spent our honeymoon at Bath, for Mrs. Drisbergh, who had kindly taken the  direction of everything into her hands, had urged that <i>that</i> was the proper place to go to, adding, by way of confirmation,  that she herself had spent <i>her</i> honeymoon there, which statement, of course, settled the question. Whatever our  motive in going there, the result far exceeded my most sanguine expectations. I  still look back on our sojourn at Bath as an oasis in the desert of my married  life. Not only did we visit with appreciative delight all the local sights, but  I rented a little pony chaise&mdash;for Winnie &quot;adored,&quot; she said, that description  of vehicle&mdash;and we drove to all the objects of interest for miles and miles around.  My wife, who had seen but little of English scenery, was in ecstasies with  everything, and her delight enhanced my pleasure. Good-looking as she had  always been, she never showed to such advantage as then. A sparkle of  excitement brightened her eyes, and a flush of pleasure lit up her cheeks,  which made her more attractive than ever. &quot;Dearest,&quot; I whispered in  her ear a hundred times a day, &quot;are you happy?&quot; And a hundred times a  day she answered me (accompanying the remark with suitable action), &quot;Yes!  dear John, quite!&quot; She had only one regret, that her mother, that  dearly-loved, admirable being, was not with her to share her pleasure. That  regret was no sooner expressed than silenced. I promised her that I would take  the whole family down there the very next holiday I took, which promise I then  considered was amply repaid by a warm kiss of gratitude. But honeymoons, like  other moons, are subject to eclipses, partial or otherwise&mdash;alas! that ours  should have been a total one!&mdash;and one bright spring morning, with many  regrets, we turned our backs on Bath, and came back to London to face our new  life.</p>
  <p>We  dined the first night&mdash;at my wife's particular request&mdash;at her mothers. It was a  family party. Besides ourselves there were only Mrs. Drisbergh, her daughters  Eleanor and Boadicea, and her son Norman who derived his name from &quot;The  Conquest,&quot; their descent from which the widow Drisbergh was always  thrusting under one's nose. I was still so much under the influence of recent  events that I managed to overcome my usual reserve, and chatted away the whole  time. I even went so far as to praise my mother-in-law's Amontillado&mdash;that is  what she called it. What is more, I drank it freely. But at last dinner was at  an end, and I rose and opened the door for the ladies. Mrs. Drisbergh  marshalled out her three daughters, and then turning to Norman, who was a lad  of eighteen at the time, told him that she had something particular to speak to  me about, and that for once she would like him to join his sisters in the  drawingroom. Norman grumbled but obeyed. How gladly would I have changed places  with him.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Drisbergh took a chair next to me, and, without any preliminaries (she always prided  herself on &quot;coming straight to the point&quot;), broached a subject which  was to be ever afterwards of paramount importance to me.</p>
  <p>&quot;John  Smith,&quot; she said, she always gave me my name in full when she wished to be  impressive, &quot;you will remember that in the last words I spoke to you  before you left I promised that I would review your position, and consider how  the lamentable accident of your birth and name could be got over. Since then  that question and that question only has occupied my mind.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Drisbergh here gave me a look over her spectacles which made me so nervous that  I upset the wineglass I was fumbling with, and with it also upset what little  equanimity I had left. Mrs. Drisbergh was the neatest of women, and the cloth  was a clean one, so I fully expected a home-thrust in answer to my muttered  ejaculation, &quot;Dear me! How awkward.&quot; But my mother-in-law was for  once too engrossed with her subject to heed minor matters. I filled up my glass  again, and drained the said in one gulp, which fact alone could attest the  state of mind I was in.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  of course, your birth cannot be remedied,&quot; Mrs. Drisbergh went on.</p>
  <p>&quot;No!  I can't be born again,&quot; I interjected with a nervous laugh.</p>
  <p>&quot;Your  birth cannot be remedied,&quot; repeated Mrs. Drisbergh sternly. &quot;You were  born John Smith, and John Smith you alas! must remain. But if you cannot have  the <i>status</i> which blue blood gives,  you must endeavour to wipe out the&mdash;the drawback which attaches to the fact that  you are of bourgeois birth. Conspicuous merit can alone do this. It cannot,  indeed, place you on the <i>highest</i> rung  of the social ladder&mdash;that is reserved for <i>us</i>&mdash;but  it can secure you a highly respectable recognition.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Drisbergh walked to the bookcase, and took down the volume of an Encyclopaedia  labelled PUE to SOU, and, opening it at the Ss, placed her hand on the open  book.</p>
  <p>&quot;On  consulting this work,&quot; she said, &quot;although I do not find that any <i>John</i> Smith has distinguished himself I see  that several of your surname have attracted considerable attention. There was  Adam Smith, a writer of some eminence. Sydney Smith, also a writer, and a wit  of repute. I do not recall others, but . . . .</p>
  <p>Now  I do not know what possessed me to make such an ill-timed jest, whether it was the  Amontillado (which, though vile stuff, had intoxicating properties which were  not to be ignored) or the exuberance of my spirits consequent on recent events,  but I boldly made a suggestion.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  there was Goldsmith,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p>Never  had I seen such a look in those awful eyes as they gleamed at me over the spectacles.  It annihilated me. Mrs. Drisbergh slammed the book to, and marched like a  grenadier to the bookcase.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr.  John Smith,&quot; she said, as she turned round after replacing the book,  &quot;I take your levity as a personal insult.&quot;</p>
  <p>What  would anyone have done in my place? Would they not have done as I did? I  protested that the name had come into my head. I knew not how, that without  motive I had let it escape me, that nobody could have been in reality more  attentive, and that I would work heart and soul to carry out her wishes. So in  the end she came round, and explained the designs she had made on my behalf.  She had watched me carefully, she said, ever since our first acquaintance, and  had been, in consequence, the more easily guided to the only possible result.  She knew that I had no taste for, or knowledge of, art, and she had more than  once reproved me for attempting to sing, on the ground that I had no notion of  time or tone, and had no ear&mdash;&quot;one of which qualifications is at least  desirable in a musician,&quot; she had said. I was not sufficiently well off to  go into Parliament, and was too old to enter a profession.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  remains?&quot; she asked me, as if she were doing a subtraction sum.</p>
  <p>I  did not answer&mdash;not because my one answer had not been a happy one. Besides, no  reasonable reply suggested itself.</p>
  <p>&quot;Literature  remains,&quot; she complacently answered; &quot;and through literature you most  redeem your lowly birth and homely name. I should die satisfied if I knew that  one day you would lie in that Abbey, where so many of our great are  buried.&quot; She said our great, as if the dead spoken of were her ancestors  and relations to a man. &quot;What department of literature do you propose  taking up?&quot;</p>
  <p>That  was &quot;a staggerer&quot; and the worst of it was that Mrs. Drisbergh  stopped, evidently meaning to have an answer. Now what department of literature <i>did</i> I mean to take up? I asked the question  two or three times, and finding no answer. I repeated it aloud.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes;  she said, quietly. &quot;What department do you propose taking up? Poetry?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  shook my head.</p>
  <p>&quot;History?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  shook my head again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Political  Economy?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Heaven  forbid!&quot; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Essays?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  declined again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  light literature,&quot; she said, in a tone which implied that <i>that</i> was as easy as A B C. &quot;Sketches,  travels, and novels.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Light  literature be it,&quot; I said in desperation. &quot;I will do my best, Mrs.  Drisbergh, but don't blame me if I fail.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank  you, John,&quot; said my mother-in-law, with an amiable smile, as she took my  arm. &quot;We will join the young folk in the drawingroom now. You know,&quot; she said in  the passage, &quot;you need not start with a novel. You can graduate, so to speak,  with short stories.&quot;</p>
  <p>During  the evening we talked the matter over <i>en  famille</i>, and it was agreed (I use the impersonal pronoun, for really I had  so little to do with the matter that it would not be true to say<i> I</i> agreed) that I should start my  literary labours the next day, and that Thursday evenings should be set apart  for me to read over my week's work. By general consent the plot of my first  story was left entirely to me, though Norman, in his boorish way, suggested  that it should be a love story.</p>
  <h2>Chapter  II.</h2>
  <p>The  next morning, memorable day! I began my literary labours. That is to say, I  bought five quires of manuscript-paper, new pens, new ink, and new  blotting-paper. Then, going into my study&mdash;for so my smoking-room was already  called&mdash;I sat myself down before a blank sheet of paper, and for a time merely  looked at it. Not but what I had an idea of my ultimate plot, for I had lain  awake the whole night, thanks to Mrs. Drisbergh's infernal Amontillado, and had  thus had plenty of time to study it, but that the difficulty of commencing it  seemed to me almost insuperable. It was to be called &quot;Thou Shalt Not Marry  Thy Grandmother,&quot; and was to be the story of a lad who falls in love with  a woman older than himself. The main incidents being true, and having come  under my personal knowledge, I thought that I should have no difficulty in  writing it straight off. But somehow my sentences got involved, my antecedents  quarrelled with their relatives, and I, who had hitherto prided myself on my  correspondence as a model of style and grammar, found myself making slips that  any schoolboy would be ashamed of. Then again, when I had written a few pages a  new &quot;opening&quot; would suggest itself, and when I had torn up what I had  written and adopted my second thoughts a third scheme would suddenly come into  my head which I felt bound to employ. Thus after three days' work I found  myself with three pages written, and three pages with which I was thoroughly  dissatisfied. I went out for a walk, hoping to get some ideas. I got more ideas  than I wanted, for during my peregrinations I thought over my story, and on  reflection its plot not only seemed to me trivial, but utterly absurd and  impracticable. Not only this, but <i>another</i> plot suggested itself to me, which I immediately recognised (I am describing my  feelings at the time) as vastly superior to the first. The next day I started  that story, but with no better result than the first. When the first Thursday  arrived, to my own shame, and to Mrs. Drisbergh's bitter indignation,<i> I had nothing to read.</i></p>
  <p>At  my mother-in-law's solicitation I stated in detail my difficulties, and invited  the deliberation and advice of the family thereon. I must say that the matter  was thoroughly discussed&mdash;for we sat from nine till twelve &quot;hard at  it&quot; the whole time&mdash;though it has since struck me that in these family  councils my convenience and feelings were hardly as much considered as they  might have been. However, in the end a definite plot was arrived at, and, what  was more, sketched out on paper, and I went home, to quote Mrs. Drisbergh,  &quot;with the backbone of a charming story, which I had to convert into flesh and  blood.</p>
  <p>The  next day,<i> before breakfast</i>, I started  to perform this feat, but, by night, confessed to myself that convening  backbones into flesh and blood was not the sort of miracle I was likely to  effect, at any rate for the time being. However, within the week I managed, by  dint of constant corrections, interlineations, and re-writing, to read to the  Drisbergh family the first half of my story. They were alive with expectation  and excitement. I was glad to find that on the whole, they were pleased with my  first effort, and that, too, notwithstanding my nervousness, which greatly  impaired my reading. By the next Thursday the story was finished, and the  verdict was favourable.</p>
  <p>&quot;For  a first attempt,&quot; Mrs. Drisbergh admitted, &quot;it is highly creditable.&quot;</p>
  <p>Now,  I have no intention of entering into particulars of the various stories which  succeeded &quot;Thou Shalt Not Marry Thy Grandmother&quot;&mdash;that, after all, was  my first story&mdash; for I gradually found the management of my plot easier, the  treatment of dialogue less troublesome, and the mere scrivener's work less  irksome. It is true that sometimes I got myself into difficulties; placed my  heroes and my heroines in positions whence I found it impossible to extract  them, and got my plot into an inextricable tangle. But after a while I learnt  many &quot;tricks of the trade,&quot; and avoided like annoyances by a wise  disposition of my plot before I put my pen to paper. Thus before twelve months were  over I had twelve complete stories written, and though I had learned to abhor  the work, and the very sight of pen and ink made me recoil, I still slaved away  for hours daily, &quot;graduating with short stories&quot; that I might  ultimately (to please Mrs. Drisbergh, for I was utterly indifferent myself)  write an imperishable work of fiction which should secure me a niche in our <i>Walhalla.</i></p>
  <p>Alas!  long before my third story was completed I had found out that it was one thing  to write, another to get what you have written published. Mrs. Drisbergh and  the girls had studiously copied out the various &quot;Directions to  Correspondents&quot; which are inserted in the magazines as a guide to would be  contributors, and these directions I carefully carried out. I enclosed the  required &quot;stamped envelopes,&quot; and directed them to myself (which at first  seemed to me to resemble somewhat Mr. Toota's memorable proceeding) in a large  bold hand. But my contributions came back to me with a marvellous persistency. Sometimes  an editor condescended to notice them; sometimes he enclosed a printed form,  which stated that he &quot;returned the enclosed MSS. with thanks&quot;; but as  often as not the stories came back unaccompanied by any letter. These reverses  would have quite satisfied <i>me</i> that  &quot;light literature&quot; was not my <i>forte</i> had it only depended on myself. But the Drisbergh Family Council was behind me,  alas! and when a story came back they complacently observed, &quot;Well! you  must send it to another magazine,&quot; pointing out truly enough, that the  requirements of all journals are not alike, that what does not suit one might  suit another, &amp;c. Thus at the end of twelve months I had as many stories in  circulation. (I use that term advisedly, for were not my stories &quot;going  the rounds&quot; of the publishers?) No sooner did one come back than off it  went again by the next post elsewhere; and the very process of doing up, and  undoing the parcels, weighing, stamping, and addressing them was in itself no  mean labour.</p>
  <p>But  this was not all.</p>
  <p>At  first, when only a limited number had been written, I could &quot;carry in my  head&quot; the magazines to which I had despatched the particular articles,  but, after a while when the bantlings of my brain had attained double figures,  I found that I was in danger of sending the same story twice to one editor,  which, in fact, <i>did</i> happen to me  once. Under the circumstances, I devised a plan which at least preserved me  from making such a mistake again. I bought a ledger which I had ruled and  &quot;headed&quot; as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/first-murder-01.png" width="505" height="71"></p>
  <p>In  the middle of the page, just over the word, &quot;back,&quot; I would write in  red ink the name of the story to the use of which that particular page was  dedicated, and I blush to admit that some of the stories had very soon to be  &quot;carried forward&quot; over several pages.</p>
  <p>With  this ledger under my arm, I used to go to the Drisberghs of a Thursday, who  would go through it with never-failing punctuality, and whose first question  now was, &quot;How many have come back this week?&quot; Then we used to hold  that infernal council, and the &quot;Remarks (if any)&quot; column of the  ledger used to be eagerly scanned by the family in the hope that some faint  glimmer of encouragement might be derived from the answers of editors, which  were duly chronicled under that head. There you might read that &quot;Just His  Luck&quot; was utterly unsuitable for our columns, that &quot;your plot is a  great deal too involved, and your story much too long and wearisome;&quot; that  &quot;Born to Glory&quot; is not of a character to suit our requirements and a  hundred other items of useful but unpalatable criticism. But, after all, it was  from &quot;Remarks (if any)&quot; that Mrs. Drisbergh derived the piece of  information which was to ruin me.</p>
  <p>I  had just executed my long-standing promise (I had been married fifteen months),  and had taken the whole family to Bath&mdash;a place to which I had (between  ourselves) frequently consigned them in the interim. On my return to town there  was quite a heap of parcels for me, about half of them being accompanied by  letters. With a sigh, I proceeded to enter them up in the ledger, and had duly  &quot;noted&quot; three or four when I came across a letter which differed so  much from the rest that it arrested my attention. An editor, in returning  &quot;A Seaside-Idyll,&quot; &quot;ventured to give me some advice.&quot; He  pointed out that once a fortnight for twelve months he had been receiving  stories from me, all of which he had returned, and suggested that, unless I  struck out in a new direction, I should cease sending to him. &quot;You seem to  have got into one groove,&quot; so the letter ran, &quot;and, in my opinion, a  very bad one. Your stories deal with one phase of life only&mdash;the mawkish  sentimental; your characters are too superficially sketched, your dialogues are  wearisome, your situations not dramatic. I would suggest to you the  advisability of having your plot very clearly defined in your mind before you  start writing, and that you should try something totally different from your  previous efforts. For love stories you have no talent. Why not try the  sensational?&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was to be an &quot;extraordinary meeting&quot; that night in honour of our  return, and, with my wife on one arm and the infernal ledger&mdash;I have not read  it, but I have my own idea as to why Dante called his chief work the <i>Inferno</i>&mdash;under the other, I walked over  to the Drisberghs. You can have no idea of the depressing effect of those  &quot;Council nights.&quot; I used to feel as miserable as a body at an inquest  while it was being &quot;eat upon&quot; by that delightful family. Everyone felt  that they had a right to have &quot;a dig&quot; at me. Even Norman, whom I had  endeavoured to propitiate by sundry tips, one night produced what he termed  &quot;A design for a bust of John Smith, Esq., to be erected in Westminster  Abbey,&quot; and which, if it <i>was</i> like me, also bore a suspicious resemblance to the ordinary donkey of commerce.</p>
  <p>The  letter I have quoted immediately caught Mrs. Drisbergh's eagle eye. The last  sentence especially engaged her attention.</p>
  <p>&quot;Why  not try the sensational?&quot; she repeated, looking at me over her glasses.  &quot;I understand that it is Mr. Wenkam Lake, the distinguished novelist, who  edits <i>The Cornucopia</i>. His advice is  surely worth following, and you will not be foolish enough to disregard it.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  need not say that the result of the sitting was that I promised to bring a  sketch of a story for the ordinary meeting on Thursday. That evening I went to  bed, as always came about when I had passed the evening at my mother-in-law's,  with a bleeding heart, which, perhaps, after all, was the proper condition for  a man who was resolved to commit murder.</p>
  <p>&quot;To  commit murder!&quot; you exclaim.</p>
  <p>Yes!  But not the crime which you would naturally impute to me, namely, the dissolution  of Mrs. Drisbergh. The deed I planned that night was but another offspring of my  brain. My murder was to be done on paper.</p>
  <p>I  submitted the plot at the next meeting.</p>
  <p>Maud  Poynings is a sad flirt, and at the opening of the story is engaged to the Rev.  John Jones. The wedding day is fixed, &quot;the wedding clothes provided,&quot;  when Maud evinces a preference for a recently made acquaintance, Plantagenet Volauvent,  a captain in the Guards. Maud is up to the requirements of the situation, and  stabs the Rev. John Jones to death in the lonely dell by the cross roads.  Captain Volauvent, deeply as he loves Maud, turns away from her now, having an  inkling that she is guilty of poor Jones's death, he swears a terrible oath  that he will leave no stone unturned to unmask the murderer, though, naturally,  he reserves to himself the right to marry the queen of his soul if he proves  her innocent. Piece after piece of evidence turns up to prove Maud's guilt, and  just when disclosure is imminent she commits suicide. Of course, Volauvent's life  is blasted, and so he states, looking very thin in his black clothes, in a  soliloquy with which the tale ends. It is called, &quot;Once I Loved a Maiden  Fair,&quot; after a charming ballad, which my wife sings admirably.</p>
  <p>The  idea was received with rapture, and so imbued was I with it that I dashed off four  chapters (it was to be in nine; before the next Thursday arrived. For once I  bent my steps towards the Drisberghs with some pleasure. I had received three  stories back that very morning, which fact was recorded in the ledger under my  arm (Vol. II. this was!) but I felt that Mrs. Drisbergh's comments would be  less bitter when she knew the progress that I had made with the new tale. I had  just got to the point where the Rev. Jones has to disappear. In order to make  his death the more lamented, and <i>&quot;to  heighten the agony&quot;</i> of the situation, I had lavished all the praise my  pen was capable of on Maud's victim, and had endowed him with the characteristics  of Raleigh, Bayard, and goodness knows whom besides. So I read what I had  written with some confidence, which rose as I heard Mrs. Drisbergh comment favourably  from time to time under her breath on the way I had performed my task. When I  had finished I was greeted with applause and congratulation on all sides. It  was admitted by all that I had been especially happy in my pourtrayal of the  poor little curate. Nothing <i>could</i> be  better.</p>
  <p>It  was then that Norman made a most unfortunate remark.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  what's the good of <i>him</i> being interesting? <i>He's</i> to be killed in the next chapter.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  fact was, of course, true enough, but Mrs. Drisbergh and her daughters had been  so engrossed in what I had written that for the moment they had forgotten it. No  sooner had Norman pointed it out, however, than they were unanimous that the  death of Mr. Jones would be a serious mistake. It was in vain that I protested  that his murder was the pivot on which the whole story turned; that Mr. Wenham  Lake's advice should certainly be followed; that they were urging me to  failure. I was met by the simple statement that Mr. Jones was so well drawn  that it would be a shame to remove him from the scene so early in the story. It  was suggested &quot;Couldn't I kill somebody else?&quot; When I pointed out  that if I killed Maud I should have no heroine, and that if I killed Volauvent  it would be impossible to find a motive for the crime, I was only met by an  opinion that <i>anyone's death</i> was preferable  to Jones's.</p>
  <p>Now  I had stood a great deal in that house and had borne it like a man, but somehow  that night&mdash;to my subsequent grief and sorrow&mdash;I asserted myself. Notwithstanding  Mrs. Drisbergh's indignant comment that &quot;It was simply brutal,&quot; I  determined to carry out the story on its original lines. I received but a cold  shake of the hand when I left, and the usual &quot;We shall see you, of course,  next Thursday,&quot; was omitted. I saw that my poor little wife had tears in  her eyes as we walked home, and that she held down her head, which certainly  made me feel somewhat a brute. However, like the fine little woman she is, just  as she was going to bed she put her dear arms round my neck, and, as she kissed  me, hoped my story would turn out well. &quot;You know,&quot; she faltered, &quot;that  mamma's suggestion is meant for your own good.&quot; How I have regretted since  not taking it!</p>
  <p>Ten  days afterwards the story was finished, and my wife, who happened to be in the  study, not only entered it herself in the ledger, but did up the parcel with  her own neat little fingers. Not only that; she ran up stairs and put on her  bonnet, insisted on accompanying me to the post, and would not let the precious  parcel out of her own hands. &quot;Oh! Mr. Wenham Lake,&quot; she said, as she  looked at the MSS.&mdash;it was to be sent to that literary light&mdash;&quot;Oh! Mr.  Wenham Lake! be kind to us, and deal tenderly with our little story!&quot; and  I could have kissed away the tear which stood in my darling's eye, though it  was in the street and broad daylight, for the kind heart which prompted the  speech.</p>
  <p>I  could not believe my eyes! My hands trembled so that I could hardly read the  lines before me! I felt cold all over, and, my knees giving way, I sank into my  chair as if I had been shot! By a quick revulsion of feeling the blood rushed  back into my face, and, with a hysterical laugh, I dashed out of the room, and,  snatching up my hat, rushed along the street to the Drisberghs. I knew my wife  was there (she had gone there to patch up the unfortunate misunderstanding  which had arisen in connexion with the late Mr. Jones), and though I would have  preferred to tell her the news when by ourselves, I felt incapable of keeping  it for a minute longer to myself. The door was no sooner opened than I ran  across the hall, and dashed up the stairs. I burst into Mrs. Drisbergh's  drawingroom, to the utter amazement of that lady, who happened to be seated  there with her entire family, and, with an inarticulate gasp, sank into an  arm-chair.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Drisbergh, waving her daughters majestically back, took the letter which I held  out to her from my hand. Even she, Roman matron though she is, changed colour.  Her voice, too, faltered when she spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;This  is, indeed, news!&quot; she said at last. &quot;My dears! John's last story has  been accepted by <i>The Cornucopia</i>, and  will appear shortly.&quot;</p>
  <p>My  wife threw herself into my arms. She only said, &quot;You dear, <i>dear</i>, old John,&quot; but the simple words  were more eloquent than any Demoethenes could have found.</p>
  <p>That,  gentle reader, was my <i>first murder,</i> and though I have committed scores since the only one that has ever appeared in  print I have long since used-up, I may say, all the crimes. I have poisoned,  shot, and drowned men, women, and children. I have committed bigamy. I have  been divorced, I have married my deceased wife's sister, I have robbed the  widow and the fatherless. But all to no purpose. Editors and publishers are  blind to my merits.</p>
  <p>Thanks  to my first success Mrs. Drisbergh has implicit faith in my literary future, and,  though I cannot get anything accepted by the editors, confidently asserts that  I shall yet lie in Westminster Abbey. And as I am utterly under her thumb and  my dear wife is as sanguine as ever, I still grind, grind, grind away at my  desk, and have just bought a new ledger, on the back of which, in gilt letters  is the number VII. Though I hate the work, and it is a perfect holiday if I am  laid up in bed with the gout (which I have contracted, thanks to Mrs.  Drisbergh's infernal Amontillado), I can blame on one but myself. I am forced  to admit that it was in face of the representations of the whole Drisbergh  family that I committed &quot;My First Murder.&quot;</p>

BEING A PROBLEM FOR BONE-SETTERS.</h1>

    Saturday, October 16, 1886 and Saturday, October 23, 1886</h3>
  <h2>Part  I.</h2>
  <p>I  was born in the year 1809, a year memorable as having given birth to Mr.  Gladstone, at Gaude-Petre in Cheshire, a village which owes its name to our  family, whose broad acres have surrounded it from time immemorial. Our politics  have been consistently of a Tory character, of that &quot;stern and  unbending&quot; school, too, at which the greatest of Whig historians has  thought fit to sneer, and immediately that I came to man's estate, I adopted  them with a warmth that has been a source of satisfaction to me throughout  life. Thus at Oxford, as I was a man of means, I was looked upon as one of the  most likely men of our party. When a few years afterwards I succeeded my father  as head of the family, I more than once made a vigorous effort to represent the  home of my fathers at St. Stephen's. But alas! disaffection had even spread to  Gaude-Petre! Factories had been established there at the beginning of the  century, and, alas! for the reputation of our historical hamlet, Gaude-Petre  was the first constituency to send to Westminster that political monster known  as a Radical. True to the motto of my race, <i>Semper  eadem et invicta</i>, I put up for the constituency election after election,  but finding the Liberal majority swelling on each successive occasion, I gave  up the fight till the horizon should be clearer, and remained content with a  seat in our local &quot;House of Commons,&quot; of which I was a prominent and  enthusiastic member.</p>
  <p>I  was not only a Conservative in politics. In social ideas, even in dress, I was  true to the traditions of my race. It was with regret that I saw breeches and  gaiters give way to trousers, the beaver to the silk &quot;chimney pot,&quot;  the old-fashioned fob to the watch pocket. Nor have I been able to adapt myself  to all these changes. Though my appearance in consequence constantly challenges  criticism, I still adhere to the old-fashioned high collar, attached to the  shirt; the bird's eye neckerchief, which I wear lightly tied round my throat,  seems to me the fittest compromise between &quot;the stock,&quot; to which I  was so long used, and the ties and scarves of these degenerate days. Waistcoats  have undergone many a change, but the cut of mine has remained the  same&mdash;slightly open, and with a small, turn-down collar. Other garments, too,  have varied with the fashions, but I still adopt the mode of twenty years back,  and, as likely as not, shall do so to the day of my death.</p>
  <p>If  I have been a consistent Conservative in my politics and my clothes, I have  been none the less so in other matters. Not only have I inherited a family  distaste for new ideas, but I have an equally strong aversion to new men,  carrying this feeling so far as to extremely dislike even a change of servants.  This fact will explain my having kept Tomlins, my man, for forty years. Tomlins  has defects which but few masters would put up with. He is old and slow, and he  sometimes presumes not only to argue with me, but even to criticise my actions  in a manner that does not become his position in life. I have given him notice  more than once, but have relented on each occasion. How can I, as a man of  Conservative principle, turn away a man whose grandfather waited on my grand  father?</p>
  <p>I  don't know that I could claim any good looks, but I have heard that up to  August last I was considered &quot;a remarkable-looking man.&quot; My head was  a large one, my forehead wide, and rather prominent over the eyes. My face was  broad, and clean-shaven (if I except a scanty fringe round my throat), and deep  lines not only marked with their crows' feet the corners of my eyes, but  indented my cheeks with two deep furrows from the nostrils to below my mouth. My  eyebrows, heavy and straggling, were grey; my hair, which was thin, was snowy  white; my eyes large, with heavy lids. My nose was straight (remember this!)&mdash;my  nose was <i>straight, having no pronounced  bridge</i>, and was unusually wide at the nostrils. Alas! that this  description&mdash;true of me but in August, 1885&mdash;has to be written in the past  tense&mdash;alas, that <i>it is true of me no longer</i>.</p>
  <p>I had  long made a practice of running down to Leamington of an autumn to spend a week  or ten days with my brother and his family, and in August, 1885, I paid my  visit as usual. Being myself unmarried, I naturally, as the head of the family,  took an interest in those who would inherit the name and fame of our ancient  race. I had, and have, every reason to be satisfied with them. Herbert's family  are good-looking, intelligent, and full of spirit, and, moreover, thanks to  their careful tuition, and possibly to inheritance, are likely to profess and  transmit the true political faith. Though I saw but little of Herbert and his  wife, who never seem to have a moment to themselves, I was thoroughly enjoying  my visit in my own way, sauntering about the grounds of The Larches, chatting  with my nephews and nieces, or even falling asleep in the garden chairs, and I  should doubtless have continued to enjoy it had not my satisfaction been cut short  by an event which has cast an impenetrable gloom over my life.</p>
  <p>It  was a bright, sunshiny afternoon. I had been lazily watching my nephews and  nieces playing lawn tennis, taking, however, but little interest in the game.  Suddenly my niece Maud aged thirteen&mdash;she had always been a great favourite of  mine, that girl!&mdash;ran up to me, and, catching me by both hands, dragged me to my  feet, and insisted that I must join them. It was in vain that I urged my age,  my stiffness, my ignorance of the game. Maude hauled away at me with both hands,  and at last, idiot that I was, I gave way. I was forthwith provided with a  racquet, was divested of my coat, and in a few minutes there I was dancing  briskly about the lawn, notwithstanding my seventy odd years, and heedless of  the perspiration which had reduced my collar to a pulp. I must confess,  moreover, that I soon got thoroughly interested in the game, and after ten  minutes' play already meditated its immediate establishment at Gaude-Petre. Whether  this idea would have been carried out I know not, for, just as the thought entered  my brain, it was knocked on the head&mdash;which you will allow, on knowing all, is a  happy phrase.</p>
  <p>Maud  frequently complained that I took balls which should have been returned by her.  Notwithstanding her remonstrances, I rushed at every ball, making vicious and generally  ineffectual &quot;swipes&quot; at them. Thus Maud and I had frequently come  into collision. As yet, however, no harm had resulted therefrom. William  returned a ball rather harder than usual to Maud, I must allow. I rushed at it,  bending down to make the most of my reach. My partner didn't see me. She struck  at the ball with all her force (she has an arm like a smith!); the racquet hit  me full on the nose; I saw &quot;all the firmament on high,&quot; and dropped  on the lawn, the blood streaming from my face. Now, Herbert and his wife were  away for the day, but had they been at home I doubt whether Tomlins would have  allowed them to have anything to do with me. On occasions like this he brooks  no interference. I felt very faint, and when he suggested that I should go to  bed, I did not offer any resistance. Nor did I pay any attention to an  impertinent comment, which he offered under his breath, that &quot;there are no  fools like old fools.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  have always fancied that Tomlins took a malicious pleasure in my discomfiture,  especially when he was washing my face with sponge and hot water. Each time  that I winced (for my face was most painful), he would make some comment, such  as, &quot;It <i>do</i> smart, sir, doan't  it?&quot; &quot;She'd ha 'hit yer fur six, if yer 'ad bin a cricket ball,&quot;  and so on; and then he would dig away into the crevices with a sponge, causing  me exquisite pain. It was in vain that I asked him to desist, protesting that I  was not particular about every trace being washed off. He was inexorable,  asserting that <i>he</i> knew the proper  treatment; had not his uncle, the Cheshire Slogger, fought Tom Crib for twenty  pounds a side?</p>
  <p>Now  I have no intention of entering into particulars of what I suffered for a week  after my mishap, or of describing the grief of Herbert and his wife when they  came back the next day and saw my plight. Nor shall I relate in detail  Tomlins's brutality, for such I consider it; how he was more insubordinate than  ever, suggesting, as his infernal sponge brought tears to my eyes, that  &quot;he <i>was</i> glad the winter was  comin' on,&quot; as I might try my hand at skating; or stating his opinion that  &quot;boxin' was a nice amoosement for gentlemen o' sporting  perclivities.&quot; Even such a week as that must pass!</p>
  <p>Directly  I felt sufficiently recovered I started off for home, notwithstanding that my  nose was considerably swollen, that both my eyes were blackened, and that my  face bore other evidence of the terrible blow I had received. I leave you to  imagine that I must have been sadly disfigured, as Mrs. Somers, my housekeeper,  did not know me, and burst into tears when she at last recognised me.</p>
  <p>As  Mrs. Somers and Tomlins were both certain of it, and I had my own misgivings, I  determined to have a professional opinion on the subject, and, accordingly, our  local doctor was called in. He at once confirmed our supposition. My nose was  broken&mdash;a very bad compound fracture, too.</p>
  <p>&quot;Will  it never come straight again,&quot; I asked anxiously, &quot;for it seems to  me,&quot;&mdash;I was looking in the glass at the time&mdash;&quot;to have a decided cant,  as sailors say, to the right.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  If you left it alone it never would; but&mdash;&quot; the doctor began.</p>
  <p>&quot;Just  wat I told the master, sir,&quot; interrupted the irrepressible Tomlins.  &quot;I sed e'd never be able ter follow 'is nose again.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  doctor laughed.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  I fancy that, with a little mechanical assistance,&quot; he proceeded, &quot;we  shall be able to put things straight&quot; He gave a little laugh at his joke.  &quot;We might use splints, but the nose is an awkward thing to bandage. I  fancy the best thing would be a nose machine. I suppose you have heard of them.  They are contrivances invented for altering the shape of noses should people be  dissatisfied with the article supplied by nature, but are very useful in cases  like this. You will find it inconvenient, I daresay, for a time, but you will  suffer, I trust, but little pain.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  the disfigurement was considerable, I immediately accepted the suggestion, and  told him to procure one as soon as possible. The same afternoon he called again  with the apparatus in question.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  didn't recollect,&quot; he observed with a laugh, &quot;what order of  architecture your late nose belonged to, and have brought with me what its  makers term, 'A Roman Improver,' &quot; saying which he produced a little  machine from a box, and proceeded to apply it, adjusting the screws according  to directions on the box. Apparently satisfied with the &quot;fit,&quot; he  wished me good afternoon, bidding me have patience.</p>
  <p>I  had need of it! For nearly three weeks I used to lie back with that infernal  invention on my nose&mdash;at first in considerable pain and always terribly  inconvenienced by its application. I had not been able to read without glasses  for many years, and now, of course, could not put them on. Even if I had not  needed them I could not have seen past &quot;the Roman improver&quot; which  interfered on either side of my nose with my line of vision. I was thus reduced  to the employment of Tomlins as a reader, and if you had heard him acquit  himself you would have acknowledged it was a desperate extremity. It was not  only that he mispronounced, which be did abominably, but he used to run words  together, and he never altered the tone or his voice paragraph after paragraph.  But not only this. He knew perfectly well what strong Conservative views I  held, and he took a malicious delight, as he read me the <i>Standard</i> or <i>Post</i>, in not  only picking out Mr. Gladstone's speeches for my entertainment, but in  pretending that he was under the impression they were those of Lord Randolph  Churchill, or the &quot;Markis&quot; as he called Lord Salisbury. I had long  known, that, if a Conservative at all, he was a disaffected one, for I had heard  him express views as to &quot;the duties of capital&quot; and such rubbish. But  he was too wise to openly avow his heresy. That was the one thing I <i>could</i> not have forgiven him.</p>
  <p>My  brother Herbert had been away in Germany, and I had been three weeks &quot;undergoing  restoration,&quot; as the doctor termed it, before he returned to England, and  visited me. I shall never forget his look of astonishment when he saw me. He  peered into my face again and again before he spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;Dear  me, William!&quot; he said. &quot;This is most wonderful! I shouldn't have  known you! Your nose is quite a different shape!&quot;</p>
  <p>Again  he looked at me with extraordinary interest.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  only is your nose different,&quot; he said, &quot;but your face bears a strange  resemblance to&mdash;to someone or other,&quot; he paused and passed his hand across  his forehead, &quot;but to whom I cannot recollect for the moment.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  repeated his expressions of surprise the whole time he stayed with me, without,  however, hitting on the person whom I resembled to such a strange degree.</p>
  <p>At  the end of August I drove to the local station, it was the first time I had  been out, and took the train for London. The journey would not deserve mention but  for one incident. At a station where we stopped for a few minutes, some people  who were on the platform caught sight of me (it must have been me, for there  was no one else in the carriage), and began to cheer me lustily. One man, he looked  like a navvy, called out, &quot;Give us a speech, governor!&quot; and his  suggestion was warmly received by the others. However, seeing that I made no  sign of doing so, and did not in any way acknowledge the demonstration of which  I was the object, they gradually moved away from the carriage door, though  still casting sidelong glances at me from time to time.</p>
  <p>When  I drove to my hotel, to my surprise the porter, whom I have known these thirty  years, did not recognise me. When I told him who I was, he looked at me in much  the same way that Herbert had done. At last he came out with this extraordinary  speech&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  thought as I knew you, sir, but I didn't recognise you as you.&quot;</p>
  <p>If  it had not been for Tomlins establishing my identity I believe the man would  have given me in charge as an impostor.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  clothes, the collar, the necktie is Mr. Gaude-Petre's right enough,&quot; he  told Tomlins, &quot;but I'm d&mdash; if the face is! He's as like somebody,&quot; <i>he</i> could not recollect whom, &quot;as  two peas.&quot;</p>
  <p>Tomlins  told me this as I was going to bed,</p>
  <p>&quot;There  ain't no doubt as you're the livin' immidge o' somebody, sir,&quot; he said,  ''but the wust of it is nobody can't say who. There was Mr. 'Erbert, sir, he  seed the likeniss. The crowd at the station took you for a dook, at least, sir,  an' here's Bob, wot's known yer thirty years, as <i>didn't</i> know yer.&quot;</p>
  <p>After  Tomlins had gone out of the room I got out of bed, lit all the gas, and looked  at myself earnestly in the glass. But it told me very little. I saw, indeed,  that my nose was slightly larger than it had been previous to the accident, but  I could not gauge the alteration, which, of course, had been <i>gradual</i>, and had literally been taking  place &quot;before my eyes&quot; or, should I say, &quot;under my very nose.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  next morning, after a poor breakfast&mdash;the inevitable result of a restless  night&mdash;I went out for a walk, hoping to clear my brain and see some solution to  my difficulty. I turned down Bond-street, walking very slowly, and with my eyes  cast on the pavement. But even thus I had not gone far before I was aware that  I was attracting considerable attention. People turned round and stared at me,  pointed at me even, and made comments in a whisper on my appearance. The effect  of this behaviour on my overstrained mind is indescribable. I was inclined one  moment to question them, the next to take to my heels and leave my critics  behind me. Moreover, I felt, curiously enough, as if I were a criminal, and as  some &quot;sandwich men&quot; passed me with advertisements of Madame Tussaud's  establishment, I reflected bitterly that, if things went on at this rate, I  might soon by confronted with the announcement that I had been &quot;just  added&quot; to that lady's <i>Chamber of  Horrors</i>. One or two persons were inclined to speak to me, but, seeing the  cold and forbidding look I gave them, they passed on, leaving the greeting  which was already on their lips unspoken. I turned disgusted from one of these  latter, and looked into a shop window, not at first seeing what was exposed for  sale, so engrossed was I with my thoughts. But suddenly my attention was  riveted on one object, and as I looked at it I turned pale, my jaw fell, and my  eyes ached with the intensity of my gaze.</p>
  <p>It  was a photograph of a large size, representing a man in his shirt-sleeves,  resting from his labour. He had evidently just felled the tree at his feet, for  in his hand he still held an axe. But, though I give these particulars here, I  did not see them then. It was the face that at the time engaged my  attention&mdash;the face of Gladstone, THE GREAT APOSTATE! I recognised with a  shudder to what resemblance I owed the attention I was attracting.</p>
  <p>I  was determined to test the matter. I went into the shop and bought the  photograph. As I tendered the money, the shopman remarked that &quot;it was one  of the best I had ever had taken.&quot; Surely no further confirmation was  needed. Yet, when I reached my hotel, with trembling fingers I untied the  parcel and compared the features with mine, hoping against hope that I was  mistaken. Whilst I was thus engaged, Tomlins came in. He no sooner caught sight  of the photograph than he exclaimed, &quot;Why, sir, if yer haven't bin an' 'ad  yer portray took in yer shirt sleeves.&quot; That settled the question.  Tomlins, if anybody, should be acquainted with my personal appearance.</p>
  <p>There  was only one thing to be done, that was to see Dr. Rowell, to whose malpractice  I owed my appearance. I ordered Tomlins to pack up at once, and we went to  Gaude-Petre by the next train.</p>
  <p>When  I entered the surgery Dr. Howell rose to shake hands with me, but, as he caught  sight of me, that look which I had first observed on Herbert's face, but which  I had now learnt to know so well, came over him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Dear  me!&quot; he said, with a nervous grin, &quot;if I had not known it was you,  sir, I should have said it was Mr. Gladstone.&quot;</p>
  <p>So,  then, the resemblance was confirmed out of his own mouth! For a moment I lost  my temper, and gave vent to passionate reproaches, upbraiding the doctor in  terms which, as he has since told me, would not have disgraced the vituperative  reputation of the Home Rule party. When I had exhausted my vocabulary of abuse  and reproof I sank on a chair, and listened without interruption to what he had  to say. He pointed out modestly, but firmly, that <i>he</i> could not be held accountable for the effect that had resulted;  that my nose, from a medical point of view (which, after all, was the only one  which justly concerned him), was a wonderful success; and that I was fully as  likely to know the result as he was, and should, therefore, have protested  before the improver was applied at all.</p>
  <p>&quot;Instead  of blackguarding me like a pickpocket,&quot; he said indignantly, &quot;I think  you should thank me warmly for saving you from a life-long disfigurement.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was in vain that I pointed out to him that there was <i>no</i> disfigurement which I would not have welcomed in comparison with  this infliction. He did not see it in my light. However, at my earnest  solicitation he went into the case, and, after a long and careful  consideration, gave an opinion.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  bones have knitted so firmly and well that I don't think a nose-machine would  any longer effect a change. It would only subject you to pain for nothing. Remain  as you are for three months, and see if any alteration takes place. If none  does, we will see what can be done.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  took his advice, and at his suggestion I had my photograph taken once a week,  in order to accurately estimate at the end of the term any alteration, if any,  which might have taken place.</p>
  <h2>Part  II.</h2>
  <p>Oh!  the trials I underwent, the insults I received, the disappointments I  experienced in those three wretched months! Every week&mdash;every <i>day</i>&mdash;subjected me to fresh humiliation,  fresh disappointment, fresh despair! Every night I was so tortured by the  terrible same sleeplessness born of a disordered brain!</p>
  <p>I  found the stay at Petre-court during the autumn months, when I had been  accustomed to go up to Scotland, irksome to the last degree. But I would not  show my face (I should say <i>his</i> face,  for it was not mine) in public again, whilst there was a chance, however  remote, of presenting my old self. Mr. Gladstone was thoroughly well known in  that part of Scotland which I annually visited. If I went I would only meet  with fresh discomfiture, with fresh ridicule. So I buried myself in the library  at the Court, sent out notes to the friends who annually helped me to keep down  my game that there would be no shooting that year, and gave myself up for a  time to grief and despair.</p>
  <p>I  have mentioned elsewhere that I was mainly instrumental in the institution of a  local &quot;House of Commons.&quot; I had been accustomed, from its initiation,  not only to take a great interest in its debates, but to join in them. Though I  was long wearied of my solitude, and often felt inclined to walk down to the  village and take my old seat in &quot;The House,&quot; the fear of ridicule for  a time prevented me. But one night that my loneliness and grief weighed on me  more than usual, I put in an appearance. As I walked into the well-lit hall, I  pressed my hat down over my eyes, and, when I sat down, folded my arms, still  keeping my hat on. But this did not prevent my unfortunate predicament being  recognised.</p>
  <p>A prominent  Liberal member&mdash;a glib-tongued, lying little attorney, who, I need not say, was  not <i>my</i> lawyer&mdash;was on his legs. He was  arguing that the general feeling of the country was tending towards Liberalism&mdash;that <i>his</i> party made ten converts to one that  ours did.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  it is not only in ideas, gentlemen, that this reformation is going on,&quot; he  proceeded, glancing maliciously in my direction. &quot;It even extends to  customs, to manners, aye! and to dress. I have noticed, Mr. Speaker, with no  small pleasure, that a gentleman, who has hitherto been considered one of the  local props of that tottering structure, Conservatism, has so far conformed to  the spirit of the age that he has adopted not only the clothes, but the manner  and even the features of our great leader, Mr. Gladstone. I have always  understood that imitation is the sincerest flattery, but I have never known a  case carried to such lengths as this.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  sat down amidst roars of laughter.</p>
  <p>There  was no misunderstanding his allusion.</p>
  <p>I  rose to my feet, boiling with wrath, and regardless of the consequences. But  such, uproarious laughter had greeted the sally, and still continued, that I  found it impossible to make myself heard. At each fresh gesture the laughter  broke out afresh. My assertion that I rose to make &quot;a personal  explanation&quot; was received with brutal derision. It is true that I heard  entreaties to &quot;let Mr. Gladstone explain, Mr. Gladstone can explain  anything,&quot; but the mere application of that hated name to me only tended  to infuriate me the more. Luckily Dr. Rowell happened to be in &quot;The  House,&quot; and he prevailed on me to go home without offering any  explanation.</p>
  <p>Again,  on my birthday I received a rather heavy parcel, and with Tomkins's assistance  I at last unrolled the contents from its numerous wrappers. It was an axe, and  on a label attached was written, &quot;The only thing wanted to make the impersonation  complete.&quot; I flung it from me with fury, but Tomkins quietly picked it up,  saying, &quot;It might come in handy, he'd put it in the storeroom.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was over this axe that I committed my only weakness. My stay at the Court was  terribly dull. I found time hang very heavily on my hands. I had not the heart  to go out shooting, it would have reminded me too faithfully of the happy past.  To riding I had suddenly taken a distaste, and to fishing, which would have  been a great resource, I had been, alas! never addicted. Whilst in this  unsettled mood I one day bethought me of the axe, and made the wondering Tomkins  fetch it. That afternoon, when I thought I was secure from observation, I stole  out, axe in hand, and made for the spinney at the foot of the mill hill. Once  there I threw off my coat, selected a stout limb, which was lying on the  ground, on which to operate&mdash;for I was not ambitions enough to attempt to fell a  tree &quot;right off,&quot; and set to work to cut it into two-foot lengths.  Although I was very clumsy, and found a great difficulty in bringing the axe  down <i>true</i> (the wretched thing <i>would</i> come down on the side of the  blade), by dint of perseverance I cut off one piece to my satisfaction. I  started on the second &quot;length,&quot; and, as I was warming to it, put more  &quot;go&quot; into my work, bringing down the axe with a ring worthy of an  experienced woodman. I should doubtless have finished this piece as  satisfactorily as the other had I not met with an accident A piece of wood flew  up and struck me a violent blow on the head, which absolutely knocked me down.  How Tomkins came to be there I know not, but I found his arm very useful on the  way back to the house, nor did I reprove him when he suggested that if I went  wood-cutting again he'd advise me to use a cross-cut saw. &quot;Yer can only  saw orf a finger or so at that business, sir,&quot; he dryly observed, &quot;whereas  at this 'ere axe game yer might knock yer blessed 'ed orf.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  would be idle to recount any more instances. Not a day passed without something  turning up to remind me of my awful position.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>It  had been agreed between Dr. Rowell and myself that we should not see each other  during my three months of retirement, in order that he might form a better  opinion of the alteration&mdash;if any&mdash;which had taken place in my appearance during  that time. This compact had been strictly observed, with the exception of our <i>rencontre</i> at &quot;the House of Commons  &quot; narrated above. My time was up (the phrase suggests a prison, and what  was I but a prisoner) on the 2nd of December, and you may be sure I was up at  daybreak, and at the doctor's the first thing after an early breakfast.</p>
  <p>I  had taken the photographs with me. These Dr. Rowell carefully examined,  comparing them not only with my face and with each other, but with a large  assortment of likenesses of Mr. Gladstone, which he had procured at my  suggestion. To my surprise and disgust I saw an ill-repressed smile on his  lips, and an ill-concealed twinkle in his eye. When he pronounced his opinion,  that &quot;the resemblance was more remarkable than ever.&quot; he fairly gave  way to his mirth, and laughed till tears came into his eyes. Before he could  dry them I was out of the surgery, and roaring out to the coachman to gallop to  the railway station, slammed the door to, and sank back in the cushions.</p>
  <p>Yes!  I was determined to dilly-dally no longer, but to go to headquarters, see my hated  &quot;double,&quot; and endeavour to come to some reasonable understanding with  him. This idea had long been growing on me, and the doctor's want of feeling  had clinched the matter. I knew Mr. Gladstone habitually professed a policy of  mutual concession, and hoped to come to some satisfactory arrangement with him.</p>
  <p>In  answer to a letter requesting an interview, I received a post-card, saying that  though excessively busy be would spare me a few minutes next day at 10 o'clock.  &quot;Bring this with you&mdash;its presentation will procure you admission. &mdash; Yours  truly, W. E. G.&quot; <i>Yours truly</i>,  indeed!</p>
  <p>The  next morning, at 10 o'clock to a minute, I presented myself at Downing-street.  As I walked down I attracted, as usual, much attention, especially after I  passed Charing Cross. But I hoped to reap so much from my interview that I  disregarded for once the odious notoriety, and it was with a lighter heart than  I had borne for nearly four months that I asked the porter at the door if Mr.  Gladstone was in.</p>
  <p>I  never saw such a look on anyone's face in my life, as on that man's, when I  asked this question. As he had seen me approach he had touched his hat with the  most obsequious gesture, but now his face assumed, as I have said, the most  extraordinary look&mdash;a mixture of astonishment, mirth, dismay, and yet civility.  I shall never forget! I repeated the question, to the man's further discomfiture,  and added, &quot;Why the deuce don't you answer?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,  Sir! He! He!&quot; giggled the man. &quot;It seems so strange you're askin',  sir, if <i>you're</i> in.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was no use explaining matters to the fellow. I told in him a voice of thunder  to show me to Mr. Gladstone's room, which I must say he did with considerable  alacrity.</p>
  <p>I  am forced to acknowledge that Mr. Gladstone received me politely, listened to my  story with patience, examined the photographs most minutely, and went into my  case as fully as he could have done had I belonged to his own party. He was  greatly struck by the likeness.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  must confess,&quot; he said, as he made me stand by his side before the glass,  &quot;that the resemblance was a most extraordinary one!&quot; which phrase he repeated  over and over again, when he sat down. &quot;A most extraordinary one! But what  do you propose that I should do, my dear sir?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  told him that I had hoped he might suggest some remedy&mdash;he who is so full of  expedients&mdash;for obviating the inconveniences of my situation.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  my dear sir,&quot; he said with a smile, &quot;I should suggest, if you will  pardon me for saying so, that you should, in the first place, cease imitating  my dress, doff the costume, and especially the <i>collars</i>, of the day, and wear a scarf or some other modern  description of tie.&quot;</p>
  <p><i>Cease imitating him!</i> I liked his impertinence! I who for half a century  had not altered in any one particular item of my costume! I told him so&mdash;and in  no measured terms! I must confess, however, that his reputation for polite  retraction has not been exaggerated. He made me a most handsome apology.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  glad to find that such is the case,&quot; he said, &quot;but I still must urge  that to a certain extent I have a prior right to the appearance, which I admit  we both identically present. Even if I was not born before you, which it seems  I was not, I've so long occupied a prominent position that my identity has  become the property of the nation, and any alteration would be resented by what  I may term my proprietors. Your case is different. You occupy no public  position, the knowledge of your face&mdash;what I may term its circulation&mdash;is  confined to a small circle. Posterity will take but a limited interest in your  features, and that only because they happen to be mine. My modesty forbids me  to point out how different is <i>my</i> case. Give my suggestion a trial, my dear sir. If it proves useless, you can  easily resume your old costume.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was in vain that I tried to effect a compromise. Mr. Gladstone was obdurate,  and I found (as my party has often found) that though he can be yielding enough  with aliens, with his countrymen he is firm as a rock. What chance had my  halting, ill-formed phrases, my crude, ill-digested arguments, with his close  reasoning and regal eloquence? Need I say I gave in, making the required  promise. I solicited another interview, in order that he should judge of the  efficacy of the change. He turned to his secretary, who sat at a table near,  and asked him what time he had to spare.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  have I to do to-morrow?&quot; he asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;At  ten to-morrow, sir,&quot; said the secretary, consulting a ledger, &quot;Miss  Mary Anderson is coming to breakfast, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  didn't ask you to let me know whom I had asked to breakfast,&quot; interrupted  Mr. Gladstone, with considerable acerbity, whilst the poor secretary winced  under his flashing eye. &quot;Pray be more careful, sir. After breakfast, what  appointments have I?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;At  eleven you have to see Lord Rosebery,&quot; proceeded the secretary, in a voice  which betrayed his discomfiture.</p>
  <p>&quot;About  the New Hebrides,&quot; muttered Gladstone, under his breath. &quot;How  troublesome those colonists are! They are always wanting something or  other.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;On  Thursday, sir,&quot; said the secretary, &quot;you have promised sittings to  four photographers*, if it is a bright day, in the morning, and in the  afternoon you are going to cut down an oak at&quot; . . . .</p>
  <p class="note">* Mr.  Gladstone is said to have had his portrait taken oftener than any man living.</p>
  <p>&quot;Am  I engaged at ten on Friday?&quot; interrupted Gladstone, somewhat pettishly,  and on his secretary replying in the negative, he made an appointment with me  for that hour.</p>
  <p>As  I had not the slightest idea of the prevailing fashion, I placed myself  unreservedly in Tomlins's hands. He knew my reasons for the projected change,  and entered into the matter, I must say, with the greatest zest. Under his  tutelage I found myself dressed on that memorable Friday morning in a costume  as unlike the one I had hitherto worn as it is possible to conceive. I noticed  that Tomlins frequently consulted a highly coloured lithograph, in order to see  if the tailor he had called in was carrying out in detail all the alterations  necessary. I looked at the picture&mdash;it was called &quot;The Masher  King&quot;&mdash;and groaned in my spirit when I saw the result aimed at. However, I  submitted quietly&mdash;doffed the tight trousers, and the paget coat buttoned across  the chest, without a murmur; did not resist when my old-fashioned  &quot;flap&quot; collar was replaced by what Tomlins called &quot;an  all-rounder,&quot; and took as a matter of course the infernal spats and curly,  brimmed hat that my extremities were respectively furnished with.</p>
  <p>Thus  attired I presented myself at Downing-street. This time I took dare to drive. I  couldn't face the crowd in <i>that</i> &quot;get up.&quot; I shall not notice the effect I produced on the porter, and  I shall do no more than mention the fact that a large number of the clerks were  evidently on the look-out for my appearance, and treated me with a levity and  disrespect which do not speak well for the discipline of the Civil Service. But  these incidents affected me strongly at the time, and I was boiling with rage  when I was at last shown into Mr. Gladstone's room.</p>
  <p>When  I entered he was talking to a gentleman, whom I directly recognised as Earl  Granville, but he immediately broke off the conversation, rose, and greeted me.</p>
  <p>&quot;Granville,&quot;  he said, &quot;let me introduce you to Mr. Gaude-Petre !&quot;</p>
  <p>Now  Earl Granville may have a European reputation for manners, but all I can say is  that he failed grieviously on this occasion. Directly be caught sight of me he  burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, though excusing himself to me, it is  true, between the paroxysms.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  never saw such a thing in my life!&quot; he said, as he wiped his eyes. &quot;If  Mr. Gaude-Petre would only consent to sit for your portrait, Gladstone, he  would save the nation a lot of its Prime Minister's time,&quot; which remark I  thought very impertinent, considering I had only just been introduced to him. These  are Liberal manners, I presume!</p>
  <p>We  had a long consultation. Mr. Gladstone admitted that my &quot;masher  costume&quot; made matters worse, that it attracted notice without detracting  from the likeness, and must be immediately discarded.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have it!&quot; he suddenly exclaimed. &quot;Just fancy not having thought of it  before! You must grow a moustache!&quot;</p>
  <p>But  not all Gladstone's eloquence could prevail upon me to do that! Since 1542 no  Gaude-Petre had worn hair on the face, and should I, who prided myself on my  consistent Conservatism, be the first to break a tradition of my race! Perish  the thought! I told him that nothing would induce me to consider the suggestion  for a single moment.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you are so unreasonable, there is no use discussing the matter further,&quot;  he said curtly. &quot;I wish you good morning,&quot; and he turned to Earl  Granville, whilst I indignantly left the room.</p>
  <p>I  told Herbert, who had come up to town, what had happened, and he suggested that  I should go and see Sir James Paget. If any one could restore my features it  was he. I did so, telling the eminent surgeon my story at length.</p>
  <p>&quot;There's  nothing for it,&quot; he said, &quot;but to break your nose again. Will you  face that?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  answered that I would face fire, torture, <i>anything</i> to be myself again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Very  well,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I will go and fetch an assistant to give you  chloroform.&quot; He went into the adjoining room, and soon afterwards appeared  with another gentleman. They made various preparations, which I need not  detail, and then he caught hold of my nose to feel &quot;if there was any  crepitation still.&quot; Suddenly he stopped, &quot;dropped my nose,&quot; so  to speak, and a grave look came over his face.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  must warn you, Mr. Gaude-Petre, that though I can promise that you shall no  longer resemble Mr. Gladstone to such an extraordinary degree, I cannot  guarantee you against resembling other people. I should ask you, therefore, to  consider whether you might not be tumbling from the frying pan into the fire.  Mr. Gladstone is not a person whom a Conservative would wish to resemble; but  what would your feelings be if when your nose was broken you were identical in  feature with Sir William Harcourt, with Mr. Parnell, or O'Donovan Rossa, for  instance, who&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Sir  James never finished the sentence, for I fled the house. As I rushed to the  hall door I fancied I caught sight of Herbert disappearing down a passage; but  as he strenuously denies it, it cannot have been he.</p>
  <p>From  that day I have rarely left Petre-court. I take more kindly to my books, and  have even of late admitted Macaulay into my <i>sanctum</i>,  just to see what &quot;the other side&quot; has to say for itself. This morning  I came across the passage&mdash;&quot;It must not be at all strange if Mr. Gladstone  were one of the most unpopular men in England.&quot;</p>
  <p>If  all felt as I do, it would not be strange, indeed!</p>
  <p align="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;The  ink was hardly dry when the news, the glorious news, arrived of Gladstone's  defeat on the Home Rule question. Since then, as &quot;the whole civilised  world&quot; knows (I am even contracting his language, I find), the  Conservatives have come in, and Mr. Gladstone has been relegated to the  uncongenial shades of the Opposition benches. In this news there is a grain,  but <i>only</i> a grain, of comfort. How<i> can</i> I thoroughly rejoice under my  terrible infliction? Only last week I ran up to London, and, wishing to test my  appearance, popped into the Carlton, once my daily haunt. I had only just  passed the door when I met Lord Randolph Churchill arm-in arm with Sir Michael  Hicks-Beach.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  say, Beach, look there!&quot; I heard the former say with a laugh, as he  glanced significantly in my direction. &quot;I thought the old boy was going  off his head. I'm blessed if he hasn't come to the wrong shop.&quot;</p>
  <p>Nice  language that for a Chancellor of the Exchequer! 'Pon my word I have my doubts  as to whether Lord Randolph is not a wolf in sheep's clothing after all.</p>

  <h1><a name="silvermarket"></a>A  DAY IN THE SILVER MARKET.</h1>
  <h2>By  George Hurdis Purves.</h2>
  <h3>Published  in The Australasian, Melbourne, Vic.<br>
    Saturday, April 23, 1887</h3>
  <p>When  Dugald M'Callum sold out of the grocery business he carried into private life  not only the goodwill of his customers but a good deal of their spare cash. He  had always been a saving man&mdash;there were not people wanting who averred that he  was abominably near&mdash;but as his money had been fairly and honourably won, it was  clearly a matter for Dugald, and for Dugald only, what he did with it. His  business had been carried on in Prahran. It was not unnatural, then, that when  he retired into private life he should have chosen to live in the same suburb.  There in a modest weatherboard cottage, surrounded by a somewhat frugal garden,  he enjoyed for many years an uninterrupted and well-earned rest, free from the  anxieties inseparable from the retail distribution of tea, sugar, and coffee.  When I add that he was a strict Churchman, and took his whiskey in moderation,  you will understand that there was every chance of his leading a happy life.</p>
  <p>As  you will have divined, Dugald is a Scotchman, and belongs to the first of those  two great divisions into which the Scotch are divided, viz., the Red and the  Black. Yes! He is red-haired and red-whiskered, and were it allowed to grow, a  fiery moustache would cover his somewhat long upper lip. His complexion is florid  and freckled, and above his fat cheeks peer as keen a pair of grey eyes as you  might wish to see. In figure Dugald is portly, as becomes the father of ten  children (<i>en pannthese</i>, Mrs. Dugald  had twins twice); his hands are large, fleshy, and freckled, and on hot days  Dugald is wont to present a decidedly damp appearance.</p>
  <p>On  retiring from business, Dugald placed his money in the very best investments, he  is a man who looks to the security more than to the interest. &quot;I like  eenterest as weel as any man,&quot; he averred, &quot;but I couldna' sleep&quot;&mdash;Dugald  is very Scotch when he is emphatic &quot;ef ma principles were at stake.&quot;  (he meant his &quot;principal.&quot; Dugald, for all that he was once a  councillor of the town of Prahran, is wont at times to make lamentable lapses  in the use of the English tongue.) Thus Dugald had a weakness for bank stock  and Government securities&mdash;a weakness which, paradoxical as the assertion may  appear, was his great strength&mdash;and had never been known to take a risky  investment. I say, &quot;had never been known,&quot; for alas! the present  tense can be used no longer! Dugald has been tempted, and it is my painful duty  to relate the how, the when, and the where.</p>
  <p>About  a year ago there came to live next door to Dugald a dapper little man, whose  bright contented manner and well-to-do appearance attracted his attention. On  inquiry it turned out that he was a stockbroker, that his name was Stephen  Morse, and that he was reputed to be &quot;up to the neck&quot; in all the good  things connected with the Broken-hill silver mine. Now, Dugald loved the  discussion of monetary topics, and, after a few diffident advances, ended by  making the acquaintance of Steve Morse&mdash;an acquaintance which ripened day by  day. Oh! you should have seen Dugald's eyes glisten when Steve, who was a <i>raconteur</i> of the first strength, told  the story of some great market <i>coup!</i> You should have seen his Scotch ears prick when his friend hinted at a coming  &quot;boom&quot; in the market! You should have seen the beads of perspiration  stand out on his fat forehead at the relation of the enormous profits made by  the original holders in the big silver mine! &quot;I'd ha' liked to ha' been  een it,&quot; he murmured more than once. &quot;I'd ha' liked to ha' been een  it,&quot; and his greedy eyes attested that he spoke from the heart. A hundred times  he was on the point of venturing, but his caution restrained him at the last  moment. But caution, like the pitcher, can be tried too often, and a few days  ago the habit of a lifetime came to grief.</p>
  <p>On  the 28th of last month Dugald was in town on business. He had purchased a  &quot;wee bit o' property&quot; in his favourite suburb, and was so satisfied  that he had made a good purchase that he was, as men in like predicament are  wont to be, mighty well pleased with himself. The day was warm, and Dugald was,  as usual, perspiring. As he walked down Collins-street, a pocket-handkerchief  in the one hand, a brown-paper parcel in the other&mdash;this contained a plump  crayfish which the frugal Donald, on such a prosperous day, had been unable to  resist&mdash;a smile of contentment lit up his broad face. He was conscious of having  done a good stroke of business, he did not owe a farthing in the world, and&mdash;oh!  the happiness of it to a man of means!&mdash;he had no capital to speak of  uninvested.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  look as if you'd struck oil, M'Callum,&quot; said a voice in his ear, and at  the same moment Steve Morse held out his hand. &quot;I'd lay six to four that when  you smile like that, somebody else is pulling a long face.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald  smiled the more. He had the vanity of his race, and liked to be complimented on  his shrewdness.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  dunno about your six to four,&quot; he laughed, &quot;but you're a man o'  perr-ception. I've med a bit this mornin'; not much for sic' as you, but&mdash;'</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  You must tell me that some other time, unless, indeed, you are going up the  street,&quot; interrupted Steve, &quot;because I'm up to the eyes in business. You're  not the only man who can laugh this morning,&quot; he continued, and in proof of the  assertion his lean face wrinkled-up in a broad grin, &quot;and I'll take odds that  before night I'll show a better profit for the day than you.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald  went up the street.</p>
  <p>By  &quot;up the street&quot; Steve meant the direction of the Exchange, and a few  minutes afterwards they were at the entrance to that establishment. Steve had  listened with resignation to the Scot's somewhat long-winded account of his  successful transaction, and now by way of a set-off was recounting the state of  the silver market. He told his attractive companion how the shares had been up  to &pound;110, then down to &pound;100, then up to &pound;103, then down to&mdash;but it is not  necessary to give the fluctuations which he animatedly described.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  on every one of those rises and falls I've made money,&quot; he concluded, and for  the life of me I can't understand why everyone hasn't done the same.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald's  greedy ears had been drinking in every word. He was dying to speculate, but his  courage failed him. Steve read him like a book. He had had his eye on Dugald for  some time, and he saw that with but very little more trouble he should land his  fish. He knew the card to play with a man of the sort, and rightly judged that  the time had come to play it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  Good-bye, old man!&quot; he cried. &quot;Time is money just now. A market like  this has to be carefully watched. I've just had the tip about Broken-Hills,&quot;  he whispered, &quot;and if you bought yourself some there's about five pounds a  share. But what is the use of telling <i>you?&quot;</i> he broke off. &quot;You would be just as likely to back horses as to invest  money in mining. So long, so long,&quot; and with that he prepared to enter the  building.</p>
  <p>Dugald  was landed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Bide  a wee,&quot; he said, as he caught hold of Steve's arm. &quot;I'm no so sure o'  that. D'ye think that et is safe?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;As  safe as a house.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Perfectly  safe?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;As  safe as the Bank of England.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  then,&quot; cried Dugald excitedly, &quot;I'm doomed ef I don't,&quot; when, as  a matter of fact, he was doomed if he did.</p>
  <p>There  is no man who, breaking through the resolutions of a lifetime, does not feel  qualms of conscience, and the heart of the Scot, as he followed Steve's quick  feet up the stairs leading into the building, began to beat with a strange  throb of anxiety, if not distrust. But a feeling of pride, not unmixed with a  greed of gain, made him averse to draw back. So, mopping his great forehead, he  followed Steve into a little office, where the particulars of his investment  were discussed.</p>
  <p>Steve  was so positive that it was a really exceptional opportunity that he waxed  quite eloquent over it, and his enthusiasm reassured his customer. But neither  his enthusiasm nor his eloquence could prevail on the Scot to go in for more  than one share. &quot;Ech, man! Isna ninety poun' a nice beet o' money?&quot;  cried Dugald, and all that Steve could say would not induce him to alter his decision.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  wait here a minute,&quot; cried Steve, and as he spoke he joined a crowd of  brokers who were standing in the hall, and who, to Dugald's uninitiated eye,  more resembled a football scrimmage than a collection of business men. &quot;I've  got you one,&quot; he said, reappearing a minute afterwards, &quot;and cheap, too.  I paid ninety-one, that's ninety-two to you.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald's  eyes opened.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  pound is my commission,&quot; explained Steve, in answer to the look.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ees  et not rather steel?&quot; asked the Scot in amazement &quot;Why, man, ye weren't  a meenit!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  I told you time was money,&quot; laughed the little broker. &quot;I only wish  that you'd bought more,&quot; he added impressively, &quot;for they are going  to go up like&mdash;like Brock's big rockets.&quot;</p>
  <p>But  they did <i>not</i> go up, and if the  fireworks to which Steve likened them go up no better, I warn intending  spectators against patronising the Melbourne cricket-ground. In fact, they  began to go down, and rapidly too. Dugald's spirits went down with them.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  air they noo?&quot; he kept asking Steve every few minutes. He had at first sat  in Steve's office, but now he was at his elbow in the market. &quot;What air  they noo?&quot;</p>
  <p>When  Steve quoted the market, which fell, as he put it, &quot;about thirty shillings  an hour,&quot; the heart of the wretched Scot went down into his boots&mdash;and oh,  the size of them!&mdash;and he cursed the hour that he had been tempted. What made  him even more wretched was that Steve&mdash;Steve, who had cajoled him into his  wretched position began to get tired of his importunate questions, and would  only answer them with scant civility.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  what the deuce is it now!&quot; exclaimed the broker testily when Dugald  accosted him for the twentieth time in an hour. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;They're  eichty-seven, Meester Morse,&quot; whispered the Scot in a faint voice.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  What if they are?&quot; exclaimed Steve sharply.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  am I to do, man?&quot; asked Dugald.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  Sell your infernal share, if you're not satisfied.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,  man, I should lose <i>five pound</i>,&quot;  cried the poor Scotchman, with an emphasis on the word &quot;five&quot; that  would have been more appropriate had the &quot;five &quot; been &quot;five  hundred.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  If you did, it wouldn't break you,&quot; commented the hard-hearted broker. &quot;But  don't bother me, I'm too busy.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald's  face flushed, and the perspiration broke out afresh on his anxious brow. In his  amazement at his supposed friend's indifference, he wiped his face with the  crayfish instead of with his handkerchief. But no words came from his lips. For  the moment he was incapable of speech.</p>
  <p>Steve  saw his state of mind, and relented somewhat.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  sorry that the blessed shares have come down, but&mdash;but they'll soon go up again,  you know. Anyhow, there is no good your sticking about the market, and you  can't expect me to devote my whole time to you. Why don't you go home and have  your dinner?&quot; he suggested, hoping to get rid of his troublesome  questioner, &quot;You dine early, don't you? It's past half-past 12.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald's  indignation knew no bounds.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  verra fine. Meester Stephen Morse,&quot; he cried, as he drew himself up,  throwing out his chest as he had been wont to do in the council-chamber, &quot;to  talk o' goin' home, an' to say I'm botherin' you; but I'm bent on gien you a  beet o' ma mind, an'&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>What  the bit of his mind was we shall never know, for the latter, with a contemptuous  &quot;Pshaw!'' and a shrug of his shoulders, made off as fast as he could.</p>
  <p>Now,  this conversation had taken place just outside Steve's office, and every word  of it had been overheard. A long, lean man with a hungry eye now turned to  Dugald, and, as he did so, they mutually recognised each other. Some years before  he had been a customer of Dugald, who, however, had lost sight of him for a  long time. They exchanged greetings, and then Dugald, whose mind was occupied  with the one topic, told the story of his misfortunes, ending up with a piteous  inquiry as to what he was to do.</p>
  <p>The  man smiled.</p>
  <p>&quot;H'm!  There are three courses open to you,&quot; he said in a dry tone. &quot;You can sell,  and put up with the loss.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald's  face fell.</p>
  <p>&quot;Or,  you can wait till the shares recover.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald  nodded.</p>
  <p>&quot;Or,  you can buy some more&quot;&mdash;Dugald made a wry face&mdash;&quot;and average, as it is  termed.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  What do <i>you </i>advise?&quot; asked Dugald  anxiously, as he bit his lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;<i>I</i> shouldn't hesitate,&quot; answered his  new friend promptly. &quot;<i>I</i> should  average. You see,&quot; he explained, &quot;if you bought one at eighty-seven&mdash;eighty-six,  I daresay you can get one for now&mdash;you could make a profit on the <i>two</i> when they went to ninety.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  suppose,&quot; interposed the unhappy Scot, &quot;that they never went to  ninety.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  lean man, Timpley was his name, smiled again, and as he did so, shrugged his  gaunt shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;<i>They'll go</i> to ninety,&quot; asserted the  man, in a tone that implied that there was no doubt about it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I'll do it,&quot; he said, in desperation. &quot;But who shall I get to buy it,  as ma friend?&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Timpley gave a modest cough.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's  easily managed,&quot; he said. &quot;The fact is I'm a broker myself.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald  still hesitated. Twenty times he told his new friend to buy, and twenty times  he withdrew his instructions. He always wanted to &quot;just wait a few minutes  to see if the market wouldn't go back to ninety.&quot; But in the end he gave  way, and Mr. Timpley was definitely instructed to buy. Apparently he, like  Steve, found no difficulty in making the purchase, for he rejoined the anxious  Scot in less than a minute.</p>
  <p>&quot;I <i>was</i> lucky!&quot; he said, as he made  an entry in his pocketbook. &quot;I picked up one at eighty-eight&mdash;that's  eighty-nine to you. They're all after them now.&quot;</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  this encouraging news Dugald pulled a long face. </p>
  <p>&quot;I  expectit to get one aboot eichty-six,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p>&quot;They've  never been that to-day, and you can bet your bottom dollar they won't,&quot;  Timpley replied. &quot;Well! Let's go and have a drink.&quot;</p>
  <p>They  adjourned to the well-known bar connected with the Exchange. They had just been  served when a fellow broker accosted Timpley.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sales  of Brokens at eighty-five,&quot; he called out, and he laughed as if the fact  were a good joke. &quot;The British public wants its money.&quot;</p>
  <p>Poor  Dugald put down his glass with such force that the whisky-and-water danced out  on to the counter. He fell&mdash;the word absolutely expresses the motion&mdash;he fell  into a chair, regardless of the fact that he had placed the unfortunate  crayfish there, and mopped his face.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  jest a ruined man,&quot; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ruined  be blowed,&quot; replied his friend, in a reassuring tone. &quot;Wait a minute,  and I'll ask Daventry what he advises.&quot;</p>
  <p>What  Daventry advised was to sell, and that quickly. In his opinion the shares were  going to come down, and would see eighty before night. This advice was duly  repeated to Dugald, but all that Mr. Timpley could say would not induce the  latter to part with his shares.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ef  I got eighty-five, man, I should lose&quot;&mdash;and here he stopped to calculate  his loss&mdash;&quot;I should lose four poun' on one, an' seven on the ither.&quot;  The bare thought of it quite upset him. He sat down again, as limp, and  miserable, and befogged a man as there was that day in the city of Melbourne.  &quot;I'm jest wratched!&quot; he sighed, and the tone of his voice proclaimed  the truth of the assertion. &quot;What will the missis saay?&quot; And the  probabilities suggested by the latter query seemed to cause him intense  uneasiness.</p>
  <p>Now  I am not going to describe all that happened that afternoon&mdash;how Dugald's  spirits rose or fell with each market move; of the piteous appeals he made to  Timpley and Daventry and to Steve Morse, aye! and to everyone else who would  listen to his tale of woe; how he &quot;shouted&quot; drinks, not forgetting to  fill his own glass, to everyone that would put up with his lamentations; or how  in the end his devotion to his national beverage began to tell on his excited  brain. Nor shall I do more than merely mention the fact that, taking advantage  of his condition, Mr. Timpley, who between ourselves, is a &quot;fobber&quot;  of deservedly damaged reputation, wheedled a loan of ten pounds out of him  after &quot;sticking&quot; him with a third Broken-hill at eighty-five, when  the shares were only worth eighty-two.</p>
  <p>There  is one detail, however, which it is necessary that you should know. Before the  market closed Stephen Morse prevailed on his bewildered client to sell his  shares. He returned &pound;79 for them, so that Dugald made a loss of &pound;29 on the  three shares. A blow like that might unnerve any man. Poor Dugald let his head  fall on his faithful companion of the day (I refer to the crayfish, of  course-not to Stephen Morse), and thought of his wife.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Mrs.  M'Callum is the most methodical of women, and would as soon think of having hot  meat of a washing-day as of keeping her dinner waiting. But she ate the meal  that day with a long face, and the children, though they were unusually well-behaved,  had a very bad time of it. Two o'clock came, three o'clock, four o'clock, but  no Dugald. At five Mrs. M'Callum, whose anxiety had now reached fever-heat, could  stand it no longer. Securing the services of a neighbour who occasionally  helped her with the washing to look after the house, she donned bonnet and  shawl and sallied forth to find her missing lord.</p>
  <p>As  luck would have it, she met Stephen Morse as she got out of the train. He told  her where Dugald was to be found.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wouldn't be in Dugald's place for a trifle,&quot; laughed the broker, as his  eye followed the gaunt female's rapid strides. &quot;No, not for a Broken-hill!&quot;</p>
  <p>Now  the wretched Scotchman, worn out by the anxieties of the day, and perhaps somewhat  overcome by unusual libations, had again fallen asleep. His head rested on the  inseparable crayfish, which, thanks to the knocking about it had received, was  now in a very invertebrate condition.</p>
  <p>He  was suddenly roused from this position by a shaking so vigorous that the teeth,  and they were <i>his own</i>, literally rattled  in his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  did&mdash;did&mdash;dear&mdash;,&quot;he hiccoughed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  'my dear' me,&quot; cried his infuriated wife. &quot;Be off home this  minute.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dugald  prepared to obey. It speaks well for him that, even in that supreme moment of  dejection, he did not forget the partner of his troubles. He took up the  crayfish from the table, and made a drunken endeavour to cover it up.</p>
  <p>&quot;What's  that?&quot; roared the Gorgon at his side.</p>
  <p>&quot;Itsch&mdash;itsch&mdash;akik&mdash;kik&mdash;cray&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>She  snatched it from his hand, tore off the scanty covering, and then threw it with  all her force to the other end of the bar, where it shivered into twenty  pieces.</p>
  <p>&quot;Come  home!&quot; she cried, as she caught the wretched Dugald by the arm, and with one  regretful glance at the &quot;broken victuals&quot; he obeyed.</p>
  <p>It  is needless to say&mdash;or at any rate to any married man&mdash;that Mrs. M'Callum does  not know of the share transactions. <i>If  she did!</i></p>

  <p align="center"><b>&quot;THE  AUSTRALASIAN&quot; CHRISTMAS STORY.</b></p>
  <p>The  Christmas number of <i>The Australasian,</i> to be published on Saturday, December 24, will contain a story written for  exclusive publication in our columns by Mr. George Hurdis Purves, of Ballarat.  The title of the story is &quot;The Squatter King,&quot; and it will appear in  a special supplement of 16 pages, with numerous illustrations by the artist of <i>The Australasian Sketcher</i>. Mr. Purves is  the author of some clever sketches that have been published in this journal;  and he has already won considerable success as a writer of Australian tales.  &quot;The Squatter King&quot; portrays some interesting phases of social life  in Melbourne; incidents connected with Cup day are woven into the plot, on  which they have a determining influence; and this is ground upon which Mr.  Purves is thoroughly at home.</p>

  <h2><a name="sk1"></a>Chapter  I.<br>
    OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE.</h2>
  <p>Everything  pointed to the Barrons being well-to-do people, and yet the Melbourne world,  with strange perversity, lost no opportunity of expressing their doubt of the  fact. It was in vain that Mr. Barron bought town property, on which he erected  buildings acknowledged by the press and the public to be ornaments to the city,  it was in vain that Mrs. Barron gave little dinners, at which the wines and the  cooking were alike irreproachable. It was in vain that both husband and wife  spoke airily of expenditure which frightened even the most wealthy of their  neighbours. The Melbourne world, in spite of the evidence of their eyes and  their ears, doubted. That a good deal of this ill-natured opposition arose from  jealousy there can be little doubt. The Barrons were very particular&mdash;the phrase  is their own&mdash;as to whom they asked to their house, and the fact that their  guests were invariably drawn from the wealthy and influential classes was not,  you may be sure, lost sight of by those to whom the merchants' doors were  closed. &quot;I should like to know who <i>the  Barrons</i> are,&quot; people asked with a sneering emphasis on the name,  &quot;to give themselves such airs?&quot; and then details of their past life  were sure to come out, in which nothing to their disadvantage or discredit was  left untold. Even those who were admitted to their table were half afraid of  them, and the more careful of them buttoned up their pockets the while they  drank their host's &quot; '47&quot; port.</p>
  <p>That  people should be so unpopular and be unaware of it is impossible. The Barrons  perfectly appreciated the active hostility of which they were the object. But  they were wise enough to ignore it. When kind friends repeated ill-natured  criticisms they merely shrugged their shoulders, and &quot;wondered that people  could be so spiteful,&quot; adding that <i>they</i> never spoke disparagingly of <i>anyone</i>,  which in the main was true enough. When paragraphs appeared in the society  journals from time to time, in which they were held up to ridicule, they  discreetly ignored the reference, and thus destroyed half the force of the  blow. But the fact that they were invulnerable made them the more disliked, and  it would be safe to assert that at the time of which we write there were no two  such well-hated people in Melbourne as David Barron and Elizabeth his wife.</p>
  <p>Yet  their personal appearance and their manners were alike strongly in their  favour. David Barron was a tall spare man of a florid complexion. His  close-cropped hair was almost white, as was his moustache, which contrasted  strongly with his black and strongly-marked brows. His eyes, though deep set  and unusually glittering, were frank and pleasant, and his smile a singularly  engaging one. His hands, of which he was inordinately proud, were plump, white,  and long-fingered, and he had a habit, not unusual with active-minded men, of  feeling the edge of the nails of the one hand with the points of the fingers of  the other. When I add that his voice was full and round, you will see that  David Barron was a man likely to impress people favourably on a first  acquaintance.</p>
  <p>And  so was his wife. Like her husband, she was tall, and though she was unusually  stout she carried herself so well that one was apt to lose sight of the fact.  Those who had known her as a girl said that she had been wonderfully beautiful,  and even at 50 she was still a fine woman. Her nose was clean cut; her mouth,  though large, shapely; and her eyes, which were of a light hazel, keen and  lustrous. Yes, she was still a fine woman, and would have been absolutely beautiful  but for a somewhat heavy jowl and an objectionably high colour.</p>
  <p>However,  &quot;beauty is but skin deep,&quot; and when the Barrons were criticised their  good looks did not silence a single tongue.</p>
  <p>Even  the house that they lived in was brought up against them. &quot;What business  have people like that to live in a house fit for a millionaire?&quot;  indignantly asked their neighbours (and the most indignant were those who had  never been inside the door), and then they would go on to enumerate the  particular items which gave them offence. Now, indignation is apt to make  critics untrustworthy, if not absolutely untruthful. <i>&quot;Heimweh,&quot;</i> the home of the Barrons, was a charming little  house, but it was a <i>little</i> house, and  in no sense a house for a millionaire. The luxury with which they were supposed  to be surrounded existed principally in the imagination of their detractors. The  cottage was a pretty one, and furnished throughout in the excellent taste, but  it was only a cottage, and Mr. Barron only spoke the truth when he referred to  it as such. &quot;Come out to Toorak and take dinner with us,&quot; he would say.  &quot;Pot-luck, you know; just what's going. Our little place does not  unfortunately permit us to entertain. We have no suitable accommodation, and  times are so bad that I don't see my way to build for the present; but if our  rooms are small, I think you'll find that we rub along pretty comfortably. At  times I wish that our house was larger, for Mrs. Barron and myself would like  nothing better than to entertain on a liberal scale. We recognise that a duty  is imposed on people who go out as much as we do of making a suitable return,  but we do our best, my dear fellow&quot;&mdash;he would here raise his eyebrows, and  smile a modest smile; &quot;and if we do not see more company our poor little place  must be blamed, and not Mrs. Barron and myself.&quot;</p>
  <p><i>Heimweh</i> stood in charming grounds, and the position of the  house had been chosen with considerable judgment. From the rooms at the back of  the house there was an excellent view, extending over Hobson's Bay. The windows  of the front rooms looked out on a terraced lawn, beyond which shrubberies and  flower-beds were tastefully arranged. The garden was Mr. Barron's pet hobby,  which gave rise to a rumour, utterly devoid of truth, of course, that he had  started life in what he himself would have termed &quot;a horticultural  capacity.&quot; But that he was &quot;a born gardener,&quot; in the vulgar  sense, cannot be denied, and Mr. Barron himself would have accepted the  designation as no small compliment.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron was in his garden when we first make his acquaintance. He had hurried  home from business somewhat earlier than usual, as his roses required pruning,  and that was a job which Mr. Barron entrusted to no hands but his own. He had  just finished cutting a bush which grew at the side of the drawingroom window,  and now was standing back with his head slightly on one side, judging the  effect of his handiwork. Apparently the work was satisfactory, for he gave an  appreciative nod, as much as to say, &quot;That will do,&quot; and then took a  step towards a neighbouring bush with the evident intention of operating  thereon in like manner. At this moment the sound of voices, and angry voices  too, reached him through the open window, and from motives which we shall  better understand when we know him better, he stopped still and listened; and  as he listened a crafty smile came over his face, in which satisfaction and  triumph were equally blended. Leaving him standing there, we will go into the  house and make the acquaintance of two young people, whose career is of no  small interest to us.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-1-a.png" width="428" height="600"></p>
  <p>&quot;Then  I presume we may consider our engagement off?&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was a young man who spoke, and as he stood there with his head thrown back, his  eyes flashing, and his brows contracted, the girl to whom the words were  addressed instinctively drew back. She had seen him angry before, for they had  often quarrelled, but never like this. Hitherto she had paid but little  attention to his outbreaks of temper; now she was frightened of him. His eyes,  which had so often looked into hers with love, now flashed like steel, and an  angry flush that the shrinking girl understood but too well dyed his cheek.</p>
  <p>As  she did not answer, he repeated his question.</p>
  <p>&quot;Are we to consider our engagement off?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Our  engagement, Cyril?&quot; she said, in a low voice. &quot;Have we&mdash;now, don't be  angry!&mdash;have we ever been engaged? I mean,&quot; she added, as she saw a fresh  cloud gathering, &quot;I mean <i>regularly</i> engaged.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'd  like to know what the deuce you call it, then,&quot; he exclaimed, with  spiteful emphasis.</p>
  <p>The  girl's cheek brightened. She turned her face away and looked through the window  as she spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't deny, Cyril, that there was some sort of understanding&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Understanding!&quot;  he repeated furiously, as he threw himself into a chair.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  it was only a conditional one. My mother and father wouldn't hear of it on any  other terms.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You've  got wonderfully filial all of a sudden,&quot; sneered the young man, as he  threw one leg over the other. &quot;Wonderfully filial, 'pon my soul.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  come to my senses, whether I'm more filial or not,&quot; the girl said in a  firm voice, as she faced him, &quot;and, what is more, you will find that I  shall keep in them. When there was first any talk of our being engaged, I  supposed, and everyone else supposed, that you were going to do something to  earn a living. What have you done?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Never  mind what I have done,&quot; interrupted Cyril sullenly. &quot;If I'm not  engaged to you, I presume my occupation concerns me, and me alone.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah! That is always the way with you,&quot; said the girl sadly. &quot;You never  could bear to hear anything unpleasant&mdash;you would never face your difficulties.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  Paton jumped up angrily from his seat.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  has all this got to do with our engagement?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Everything  to do with it,&quot; answered the girl quickly, and with some resolution,  &quot;and no one sees it more clearly than you. You know that I haven't a  shilling in the world&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  know nothing of the sort,&quot; interrupted the young man sulkily. &quot;Your  parents are supposed to be well off,&quot; he added, with an undisguised sneer that  brought a curious look into the eyes of the eavesdropper in the garden.</p>
  <p>The  girl held up her hand as if to ask to be heard.</p>
  <p>&quot;When  I say that I haven't a shilling in the world,&quot; she continued in the same  low voice, &quot;I mean that my father has always given me to understand that I  must expect nothing from him&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No  one does!&quot; interjected the young man somewhat brutally.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  you yourself are heavily in debt,&quot; she proceeded, without heeding the  interruption.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  would not marriage under the circumstances be sheer madness?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't see it,&quot; he answered stubbornly. &quot;I suppose we can wait, as  others have done before us?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes  &mdash;wait until you make your fortune!&quot; cried the girl, with an unmistakable  ring of contempt in her voice. &quot;I'm sick of waiting, Cyril&mdash;sick of  waiting.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  young man walked to the window, and stood for a minute or two in deep thought.  There was a creeper growing outside. He leant forward, causing Mr. Barron no  small uneasiness by the action, plucked a piece of it, and, as he stood there,  rolled it slowly between his palms. His face, which but a few minutes before  had only expressed anger, was now grave, and by his contracted brow he was evidently  debating a knotty point.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he made up his mind and turned towards her.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  listened patiently to what you have said, Gertrude.&quot;</p>
  <p>She  nodded.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  now I expect you to listen to me for a few minutes. Whatever you may say to the  contrary, we were engaged.&quot; She again expressed her dissent &quot;We <i>were</i>, and there isn't a single person in  our rank of life in Melbourne who doesn't know it. That your father and mother  didn't exactly acknowledge it is true enough. They were bent on your making a  grand marriage, and they hoped that our love for each other, seeing that for  the time being we were not in a position to marry, would gradually wane. They  said to themselves, 'Oh! She will get sick of waiting, and then we can carry  out our little scheme. They are cousins, and their little flirtation needn't be  stopped until we have a suitable match in view. Gertrude shall rebuild our  tottering fortunes.' &quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Tottering  fortunes, Cyril!&quot; exclaimed the girl with a rising colour. &quot;What do  you mean?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes;  tottering fortunes,&quot; he repeated with emphasis. &quot;You don't suppose  that I'm taken in with all this display.&quot; As he spoke he pointed to the  ornaments and pictures with which the room was lavishly adorned. &quot;I know  David Barron too well&mdash;aye, and his position too&mdash;to be duped by a few hundred  pounds worth of brass-work and carved wood. Yes, I saw through their plans, but  I had such faith in you that I only laughed at the idea of your giving me up. I  was a donkey for my pains,&quot; he said bitterly. &quot;They knew you better  than I did. You are not jilting me now because you love anyone else better than  me. You have the chance of marrying money, and&mdash;and you mean to do it.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl jumped up from her seat. As she faced him there was as much anger in her  face as in his own.</p>
  <p>&quot;How <i>dare</i> you say so?&quot;</p>
  <p>For  a moment the two faced each other, and neither spoke. Though Cyril Paton tried  to assume an air of indifference, he was conscious that he did not cut a very  good figure, and his eyes fell before Gertrude's. He dug his hands deep into  his pockets, and as he jingled his money beat a tune on the carpet with his  foot.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have heard so, and I believe it,&quot; he persisted doggedly.</p>
  <p>For  a moment the girl faced him as if she would have struck him. If looks could  kill, Cyril Paton would have been a dead man that minute. Gertrude Barron's  face was the very incarnation of contemptuous rage.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  shall have cause,&quot; she said, and as she spoke she drew so near that Cyril  felt the hot breath on his forehead.</p>
  <p>She  stood for a moment as if she was going to say something more&mdash;indeed, she opened  her lips with that object&mdash;and then, before Cyril's outstretched hands could  detain her, she rushed from the room, slamming the door behind her.</p>
  <p>Cyril  whistled.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  this is a pretty go!&quot; he muttered. &quot;And <i>now</i> what's to be done? By George! I didn't know she'd got such a  temper. Phew! I'm blessed if the interview hasn't made me quite hot,&quot; he  said as he threw out his arms. Then he repeated, &quot;Well, what's to be  done?&quot;</p>
  <p>Apparently  he did not find a satisfactory answer to the question, for he got up several  times, sat down several times, walked up and down the room several times, and  gave other signs of impatience and perplexity. After a while, perhaps on the  score that two heads are better than one, he walked up to the mirror on the  mantelpiece, where he consulted his alter ego with no little care.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  looks to me,&quot; he said as he pursed his lips at himself in the glass, &quot;as  if I had put my foot in it&mdash;up to the ankle, too. However, <i>souvent femme varie!</i> What I've got to do now is to keep out of the  way for a few days. I'll lay six to four that she comes round,&quot; he  exclaimed with some confidence as he adjusted his tie, and as he surveyed his  good-looking face in the glass an inner voice told him that it was not six to  four, but twenty to one, in his favour.</p>
  <p>He  was so reassured by the thought that, though he took up his hat and gloves, he  dawdled about the room for some minutes in expectation that Gertrude would  relent, and make it up before he left the house. But when she did not make her  appearance he rang the bell for the servant, and left a message to say that he  should not be able to call for a few days, that he was going up country.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  that doesn't fetch her,&quot; he said to himself, as he passed along the hall,  &quot;I'm a Dutchman.&quot;</p>
  <p>Now,  just as he passed into the garden he ran into Mr. Barron, who expressed no  little surprise at seeing his nephew.</p>
  <p>&quot;What,  you here, Cyril?&quot; he cried as he held out his hand, and never had he  looked more amiable. &quot;I thought that you had gone to Sydney to the races.  I'm delighted to see you. Can't you stay to dinner?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  that's one point in my favour,&quot; commented Cyril as he walked away from the  house. &quot;I thought the old boy rather cool towards me of late, but, by  George, he was quite cordial&mdash;quite cordial, I'm d&mdash;d if he wasn't,&quot; and as  he recalled Mr. Barron's smile, he repeated the phrase, oath and all, with  evident relish.</p>
  <p>Had  Mr. Cyril Paton been privileged to witness the metamorphosis that took place in  Mr. Barron's appearance the moment he had left him, he would not have been so  easy in his mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;So,  Mr. Cyril Paton, it's a match between you and me,&quot; he muttered, as he  watched the young man walking towards the gate. &quot;Well, you hold a good  hand, but I shall back myself. Especially,&quot; and he smiled as the thought  occurred to him, &quot;as I have had a peep at your cards.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  reflection seemed to please him so much that he stood at the door for some minutes  with a droll smile on his face. Then suddenly turning on his heel he went into  the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Barron was arranging flowers for the dinner  table. Shutting the door carefully behind him, he described to his wife the  interview that he had overheard.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  think I may leave the rest to you, my dear,&quot; he concluded. &quot;I needn't  say that the less time lost the better.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Barron threw at her lord a glance of indescribable craftiness.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr.  Dyke is going to dine here to-night,&quot; she said, quietly. &quot;I think you  might go into the club for an hour or two. Plead an engagement as an excuse for  running away.&quot;</p>
  <p>That  night Mrs. Barron confided to Adam Dyke that her husband's position was a  critical one.</p>
  <p>&quot;Believe  me, dear Mr. Dyke,&quot; she said, and tears came into her eyes as she spoke,  &quot;my grief is not a selfish one. For myself, though I am old to begin life  again, I could face poverty, if not with composure, with resignation. My  husband would do the same, and Oliver has his profession to fall back upon. But  when I think of my darling girl&mdash;&quot; She here buried her face in her  handkerchief, and left her companion to complete the sentence.</p>
  <p>This  scene was repeated with some slight modifications later on the same night.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  we are to do, Gertrude, Heaven only knows,&quot; she cried. &quot;The sneers of  our enemies&mdash;and we have many, unfortunately, will be hard to bear. But it isn't  the thought of that that is breaking my heart. I had so hoped to see you  comfortably settled in life, and now what chance will you have of making a good  match? Who will take you if our position becomes known?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl's face had been pale all the evening, and a tell-tale circle round the  eyes had not escaped the mother's vigilant eye. Now a bright spot came into  either cheek, and her eyes, so unusually dim a moment before, shone like  burnished metal.</p>
  <p>&quot;Adam  Dyke will take me!&quot; she said, with a proud toss of the head.</p>
  <p>&quot;Adam  Dyke!&quot; cried her mother, with well-simulated surprise. &quot;Of course I  noticed that he was attentive, and so forth, but I fancied, my dear&mdash;it seems I  was wrong, but I certainly <i>did</i> fancy&mdash;that you treated him rather coldly, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  altered my mind,&quot; interrupted the girl, with a forced laugh. &quot;I have  only just discovered that I'm deeply in love with him.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk2"></a>Chapter II.<br>
    MR. BARRON QUOTES THE MARRIAGE SERVICE.</h2>
  <p>Melbourne had  opened its arms to Adam Dyke. The clubs had welcomed him as a member. Society  had received him into its innermost circles. Mothers, with daughters to marry,  had cast an approving eye on him. The right hand of fellowship had been held  out to him by Government-house. As he walked the streets envious eyes followed  him, admiring fingers pointed him out. Adam Dyke was a millionaire, and the  people of Melbourne are only flesh and blood.</p>
  <p>At first his  popularity had not only somewhat perplexed him, but was at times a source of  positive discomfort He was a man of simple tastes, who only asked to live in a  quiet, unostentatious manner. Having long led a very solitary life, principally  in the least populated portion of Queensland, he had acquired a certain  seriousness, if not absolute dulness, of manner, which is not uncommon with men  who live such lives as he. The flurry of the world disturbed him, and  accentuated his characteristics. He had been of a retiring nature. He now  became awkward. He had been slow at arriving at conclusions. He now might  oftentimes be said not to have a mind of his own; and the consciousness that  these peculiarities existed only made things worse.</p>
  <p>It was only natural  that, when he came to Melbourne, he should make the acquaintance of the  Barrons, or rather that they should make his. The fame of his wealth had  preceded him, and Mr. Barron had an uncommonly good nose for a strong bank  account. It was equally natural that Mr. Barron's critics should feel it their  duty to warn the newcomer of the real character of his new friend. But their spitefulness  only recoiled on themselves. The more the Barrons were abused the more Adam  Dyke liked them, and as it was not in his nature to quarrel with anybody, he  gradually withdrew from the company of people who abused those whom he was  proud and happy to acknowledge as his best friends. Yes! proud and happy.  Proud, because he had an idea that they belonged to a different and a higher  rank in life than himself. Happy, because he loved Gertrude, and to be in her  presence was his greatest happiness.</p>
  <p>It was of the  Barrons he was thinking as he walked down Collins-street the morning after the  interview with Mrs. Barron recorded in the last chapter, and that his  reflections were not altogether pleasant was apparent from the troubled look of  his face. The news that Mr. Barron, for whom he entertained the warmest  feelings of gratitude and respect, was in difficulties, had been so unexpected  that it had quite upset him. He was so little used to display that the style in  which the Barrons lived had quite deceived him. &quot;I'm blest if I can understand  it,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;They live like princes. You never get a  dinner like you do there, nor wine, nor cigars, nor anything. There are no  pictures like theirs in the colony&mdash;I don't know, but I've heard so; they've the  best furniture in Melbourne, and the best turn-out. And then they're&mdash;. Well! it beats  me.&quot; And thereupon his brow contracted afresh, and he looked more unhappy  than ever.</p>
  <p>Mr. Barron's office  was in Queen-street, and there he was sitting at his desk when he was informed  that a gentleman wished to see him. When he read the name on the card which the  clerk handed him he could not restrain a movement of surprise.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah! Tell Mr.  Dyke to come in, Dines,&quot; he said, and, as the clerk prepared to go, he gave  him strict injunctions that they were not to be interrupted.</p>
  <p>A minute afterward  Adam Dyke was ushered in. Mr. Barron greeted him with no small warmth.</p>
  <p>&quot;The last man  in the world that I expected to see at this hour of the morning.&quot; he  exclaimed, as he pointed to the clock on the mantelpiece, which showed that it wanted  a few minutes to 10. &quot;I, of course, have to be here&mdash;not from choice, my dear  sir, not from choice, from sheer necessity&quot; (he here thought it advisable  to assume an anxious expression)&mdash;&quot;but you, my dear Dyke, you, whose wealth  is growing even whilst you sleep, can afford the luxury of breakfast in bed.  However, what can I do for you.&quot; He added with an amiable smile, as he  placed a chair for his visitor, and resumed his own, &quot;what can I do for  you?&quot;</p>
  <p>As Mr. Barron spoke  an uneasy look came over Adam Dykes face. The consciousness of the errand on  which he was bent for the moment overpowered him. As he looked at Mr. Barron a  bright flush came into his cheeks, and he shifted in his chair.</p>
  <p>&quot;In fact, Mr.  Barron, what I want to say is&mdash;is a rather&mdash;&quot; and then he hesitated, trying  to find a suitable phrase.</p>
  <p>&quot;A rather  delicate matter,&quot; suggested Mr. Barron with a smile. &quot;Is that what  you mean?&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, that's  it, exactly,&quot; assented Adam Dyke with some eagerness. &quot;You see, I'm  only a rough fellow&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;My dear sir!&quot;  dissented Mr. Barron.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh! but I  know I am,&quot; repeated Adam, as he fidgeted nervously with his hat,  &quot;tho it's very good of you to deny it. Well! Mr. Barron, its no good  beating about the bush,&quot; he added, as if he had made up his mind to take  the final plunge. &quot;Mrs. Barron told me something last night that has made  me very&mdash;very uncomfortable. She said that your position just now was somewhat  critical&mdash;those were her words, sir,&quot; he asserted, as Mr. Barron showed  signs of interrupting him, &quot;and I have come to tell you, sir, that I am  anxious to help you&mdash;to help you in any way I can.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr. Barron had not  waited for the last sentence to be completed, though he had taken care not to  prevent its completion. At the mention of his wife's disclosure he got up from  his chair with every sign of impatience, if not of anger, and, walking to the  window, looked out into the street.</p>
  <p>&quot;My wife has  acted very indiscreetly,&quot; he said in a low voice, but taking care that  every syllable should reach his companion's ear, &quot;and her gossip may do me  no end of harm. It is one thing to be in difficulties, another thing to be  known to be in difficulties. The former may mean only temporary inconvenience&mdash;the  latter always means ruin. My wife has acted very indiscreetly&mdash;very  indiscreetly.&quot;</p>
  <p>He paused a minute  as if the reflections suggested by his wife's garrulousness were too painful to  pursue further. Then, suddenly turning round, he walked up to Adam Dyke and  shook him warmly by the hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;However, my  wife's indiscretion has nothing to do with your admirable behaviour,&quot; he  exclaimed in a tone of profuse gratitude. &quot;I cannot thank you enough for  your generous offer&mdash;an offer, my dear sir, which confirms the high opinion that  I have already formed of you. Though I can't accept it&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, yes you  will!&quot; interrupted Adam Dyke anxiously.</p>
  <p>&quot;Though I  cannot accept it,&quot; repeated Mr. Barron, in the most earnest tone that he  could command, and again shaking Adam's hand, &quot;believe me, I am none the  less grateful. And I say this deliberately, that if at any time there's  anything I can do for you, you will find that David Barron is not the man to  forget an obligation.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr. Barron said  this with a warmth and an apparent sincerity that might have deceived a far  shrewder man than Adam Dyke. He drew himself up to his full height as he spoke,  and as he stood there with head thrown back and a proud look in his fine eyes,  the simple man that he addressed looked at him with undisguised admiration.</p>
  <p>&quot;You are very  good to say so, Mr. Barron,&quot; he said modestly, as he cast down his eyes.  &quot;But really now&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>David Barron held  out his hand as a sign to Adam to desist.</p>
  <p>&quot;I assure you,  my dear friend, that Mrs. Barron has greatly exaggerated the position,&quot; he  said quietly. &quot;I won't deny that it is an anxious time. But I shall  weather it, my dear sir&mdash;weather it as I have other storms.&quot;</p>
  <p>Whilst he had been  speaking he had been carefully observing his visitor. He rightly judged that  the time had come for the introduction of another subject.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, now  that that is dismissed,&quot; he said, with an unusually hearty laugh, &quot;I  may say that when I saw you walk into the room I quite thought that you had come  on a very different errand.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam Dyke shifted  uneasily on his chair, and a deep colour came into his cheeks.</p>
  <p>&quot;In&mdash;indeed,  sir?&quot; he stammered, as he rubbed the back of his left hand with the broad  fingers of his right.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, a very  different errand,&quot; repeated Mr. Barron. &quot;However, I can't disclose  what I thought, though I may say this much, that both Mrs. Barron and myself  would be highly pleased&mdash; h'm? I was nearly letting the cat out of the  bag,&quot; he interrupted himself with a laugh. &quot;Perhaps one of these days  I shall be able to tell you my little secret, and in the meantime, my dear,  dear Dyke,&quot; he took him again by the hand, which he pressed more  effusively than ever, &quot;believe me, your most obliged and obedient  servant.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam Dyke had risen  to go, but Mr. Barron's incompleted sentence not only impelled him to stay, but  gave him courage to speak.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr.  Barron,&quot; he said, &quot;you are right. I did come here for something else.  The fact is, sir, I love your daughter Gertrude, and I want your permission to  ask her to be my wife. I know that I'm only a rough man, sir,&quot; he  continued with no little emotion, &quot;that I'm not the sort of fellow that a  girl like her might expect, but&mdash;but I'll do my best to make her happy,&quot; he  added, simply.</p>
  <p>Though Mr. Barron  had great self-command, it was all that he could do to restrain a movement of  exultation.</p>
  <p>&quot;I shall not  pretend to be surprised at your communication,&quot; he said, &quot;for my wife  has led me to expect something of the sort. Women are so quick, you know.  However, you must ask the young lady herself. In matters of this sort I need  not say that neither my wife nor myself would interfere. The happiness of our  dear child is supreme with us,&quot; he exclaimed, gravely. &quot; 'Those whom  God hath joined let no man put asunder.' &quot;</p>
  <p>As Mr. Barron pronounced  these impressive words, which he had used without any special thought as to  their appropriateness, he laid a hand on Adam's shoulder and looked into his  honest eyes, which were bright with a look of happiness and gratitude.</p>
  <p>&quot;I think I can  trust her with <i>you</i>,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed, you  can, sir!&quot; exclaimed Adam, with no little warmth,</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, we shall  see,&quot; laughed Mr. Barron. &quot;And now I must attend to business.  Good-bye, my dear Dyke; this is, indeed, a red-letter day.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Good-bye sir,  and thank you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And, I say,  Dyke,&quot; he called out after him as he was opening the door, &quot;are you going  to the Drisberghs' to-night. You are? Well, someone will be there, you know,  and&mdash;I wish you luck.&quot;</p>
  <p>For fully a minute  after Adam Dyke had left the room Mr. Barron stood there stock still with the self-same  smile on his face which had accompanied his last words. Then gradually his  smile broadened into a grin of extraordinary cunning, and he rubbed his palms  briskly together in thorough enjoyment of the situation.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mrs. Barron is  a wonderful woman,&quot; he exclaimed, as his eyes lit up with an appreciative  twinkle, &quot;a wonderful woman, I'm hanged if she isn't. And now I'll just  drop down to the bank and see Barton&quot;&mdash;Barton was the bank manager. &quot;He'll  be a bit more civil when he knows what's on the <i>tapis</i>.&quot;</p>
  <p>So perhaps, after  all, there was some truth in Mrs. Barron's assertion that her husband's  position was a critical one.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk3"></a>Chapter  III.<br>
  MRS.  BARRON CONSIDERS THAT GERTRUDE SHOULD BE THE LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD.</h2>
  <p>If  the Drisberghs might be believed, they came over with the Conqueror, and their  not infrequent assertion of the fact cost them many a friend. People whose  pedigree is&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;not quite the thing don't like to be reminded,  however indirectly, of the fact. But if the Drisberghs were somewhat vain they  were kind and hospitable, and one can afford to overlook a weakness for rank  when it is accompanied by many excellent qualities. The Drisberghs' parties  were renowned throughout the colony. Nobody ever dreamt of refusing an  invitation to their house. They gave the best supper, they had the best floor  and the best music, and, what is of more importance still, the prettiest girls.  More engagements had taken place there than in any half-dozen houses you could  name. Why I myself, in my young days, before my tailor suggested an alteration  in the shape of my waistcoat, remember dancing eight times running with a blue-eyed  girl in a pink book-muslin, who might have been Mrs.&mdash;Well, never mind these  reflections. I say that if the Drisberghs were occasionally laughed at their  parties never were.</p>
  <p>Never  had their ballroom been more crowded than the evening with which we have to do,  and Adam Dyke, who had purposely gone early, was quite surprised to find so  many people already there. He had hurriedly got rid of his overcoat and hat,  but at the last moment, from an overpowering sense of shyness, hesitated to go  into the room where his hostess was receiving her visitors. As he stood at the  door fumbling with his gloves, Mrs. Dale, a voluminous matron, dressed in  apple-green, and wearing a cap of the same colour with an eruption of  salmon-coloured feathers, caught sight of him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  Mr. Dyke,&quot; she cried, &quot;how do you do. I've lost my husband&mdash;for the  moment, you know. I don't mean that I'm a widow.&quot; She here gave her  blushing companion a tap with her fan and a look that utterly disconcerted him.  &quot;And I must enlist you in my service.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  she spoke she passed her arm through his and led him off. He made one feeble  effort to regain his liberty.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  haven't said how-d'ye-do to Mrs. Drisbergh yet,&quot; he urged.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  you had better wait a little. The drawingroom is crowded to suffocation. Mrs. Drisbergh  is doing her best to get her guests here,&quot; she observed as they passed  into the ballroom. &quot;Ah! here are some seats. Let us sit down and watch the  arrivals.&quot;</p>
  <p>And  thereupon the lady sat down, and Adam, reluctantly enough, followed her  example. He knew what he had to expect, and would willingly have made some  excuse to avoid Mrs. Dale's chatter, but none suggested itself to him at the  moment. So, with an inward sigh of resignation he took his place by her side  and did his best to assume an air of attention.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  there are the Churchers&quot; she whispered, as she put up her glasses and  exhaustively scrutinised a couple who were passing, &quot;so we may expect Mr.  Champlin here to-night. What he can see in the woman Heaven only knows, though  to be sure he can see <i>enough</i> of her,  for the way that her dress is cut is simply scandalous. I really think that the  police should interfere. It would be a different matter,&quot; she said, as she  adjusted the lace in front of her own voluminous bodice, &quot;if she had any  figure to speak of, though even then it isn't consistent with <i>my</i> ideas of propriety. But she's a  positive skeleton. I can only account for Mr. Champlin's infatuation by the fact  that he is blind as a bat. If he ever saw her&mdash;I mean as she really is &mdash;he'd come  to his senses quickly enough. Maude Darnton is making a hard fight of it,&quot;  she went on, as she transferred her attention to another group, &quot;but, though  she makes-up wonderfully well, she can't take me in. I have a memory, Mr. Dyke,  which plays me no tricks. I don't forget that Maude came out three years before  my daughter Bella. Ah! there is Bella. Don't you think she looks well?</p>
  <p>Adam  faintly murmured that he thought she did.</p>
  <p>&quot;You'd  hardly think to look at her that she has been eight years married, and has four  children. D'you know our family are quite famous for keeping their youthful  appearance. My mother at fifty was often taken for sister, and the same thing  has occurred more than once about myself and Bella. Hullo! here are the  Swaynes. Sir John looking amiable as usual, and Lady Swayne in a new gown. Oh!  what a thing it is to be rich, Mr. Dyke&mdash;to be able to indulge one's taste to  the full of one's bent, to be courted by everyone, and to be asked everywhere.  Look at that mob round them, everyone of them only too happy if he gets a shake  of the hand from Sir John, and a smile from his lady, and there isn't one of  those men or women,&quot; she said with virtuous indignation, &quot;who would  waste five minutes on them if they were still plain Mr. and Mrs. Swayne. Ah  it's an artificial world,&quot; she sighed, as she looked away from the group  &quot;an artificial world. Well, I wonder what Mrs. Keeley will come out in  next. Did you ever see such bad taste?&quot; she asked, quite unconscious of the  flaring incongruity of her own costume. &quot;Red and yellow! Red and yellow,  with <i>her</i> red hair and yellow skin. I  really think people are going mad.&quot;</p>
  <p>On  this point Adam offered no opinion, though his companion turned to him in  evident expectation of one. He had just caught sight of Mrs. Barron and he knew  that the rest of the party must be close at hand. The new arrivals had not  escaped Mrs. Dale's keen eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  here are the Barrons. Mrs. Barron in her grey velvet and Irish lace, and  Gertrude in white&mdash;a new dress apparently. What wonderful people those are,&quot;  she reflected, as she looked over the ladies of the party from tip to toe.  &quot;It's no secret that Mr. Barron is on his last legs&mdash;a normal condition  apparently, for he has been so for the last ten years and yet there they are as  well dressed, and <i>apparently</i> as  well-to-do,&quot; she laid great stress on the adverb, &quot;as any of us. Talk  of the Delusion mysteries&quot;&mdash; she probably meant Eleusinian, but her  companion was the last man in the world likely to correct her&mdash;&quot;why,  they're a fool to the Barrons. Gertrude certainly is a pretty girl,&quot; she  admitted in a condescending tone, &quot;but she'll get just like her mother,  who is an unpleasantly coarse woman, for all that she still has some good  looks. But Gertrude will never have her mother's brains. In my opinion she is  the stupidest girl I know. She thinks of nothing&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  could stand it no longer. He had been on pins and needles, whilst his friends  had been so mercilessly pulled to pieces. Several times he had tried to  interpose, but Mrs. Dale's tongue had rattled on at such a rate that he had not  found an opportunity. But when Gertrude was attacked, and as he considered so  unjustly, he got up from his seat with a movement of unmistakable impatience.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't agree with you at all,&quot; he interrupted hotly, and as he spoke he  coloured up to the eyes; &quot;and in any case I don't want to hear her spoken  of in that way. I think she is a beautiful girl, and&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;charming,  and&mdash;er&mdash;and I admire her very much,&quot; he blurted out, blushing more than  ever, &quot;and&mdash;and I don't care who knows that I do.&quot;</p>
  <p>If  Mrs. Dale had been sitting on a red-hot stove she could not have risen with  greater precipitation.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  dear Mr. Dyke,&quot; she cried as she caught him by the arm, &quot;I hope that  I've not offended you. I only meant that she was stupid to pay so much attention  to dress, that was all.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  so glad to hear you say so,&quot; exclaimed Adam frankly, as he took her hand,  &quot;for I do hate to hear any friend of mine run down. Well! can I leave you  here? I want to ask Miss Barron for a dance.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Adam walked away Mrs. Dale's face was a study.</p>
  <p>&quot;So  those detestable people have landed the big fish,&quot; she said to herself,  &quot;and we are out in the cold. Well! I wish them joy of him,&quot; she  added, spitefully. &quot;He has got no more manners than a pig.&quot;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the gentleman whose manners were so adversely criticised had made his way to  Gertrude Barron's side, and was asking her for a dance.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  know, Miss Barron, I'm not a very good dancer,&quot; he said, as he looked at  her programme, &quot;but I should like to have a waltz with you, if you&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-4-a.png" width="433" height="600"></p>
  <p>&quot;I  kept you one,&quot; she answered, with a gracious smile, as she pointed to a  cross on her programme, &quot;and two square dances, unless,&quot; she laughed,  &quot;that is more than you care for.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke's simple face beamed with pleasure.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh! you are good, Miss Barron,&quot; he exclaimed, as he wrote his name on her  programme.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  leant over towards him, so that those around could not overhear.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have reason to be,&quot; she whispered, &quot;and I will tell you why when our dance  comes.&quot;</p>
  <p>A  guilty blush came into Adam's cheeks as he looked up into her face, and his  eyes fell before hers.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't know what you refer to,&quot; he said, in a low voice, but his manner  betrayed unmistakably that he did.</p>
  <p>By  the time that his dance with Gertrude came round poor Adam was in a fever of  nervous excitement&mdash;a state of mind intensified by the necessity of keeping up a  light conversation with his many acquaintances in the room. How he longed to be  alone for a few minutes to collect his thoughts and to prepare a few phrases  with which to plead his cause. But wherever he went he met someone he knew, and  it seemed like a fatality that that evening no one that he knew, however  slightly, would pass him without speaking to him. At last his dance came, and  he made his way as quickly as possible to the place where Gertrude had  appointed to meet him. Just as he got there he was met by a bright-looking,  well-set-up young fellow with frank blue eyes and light curly hair. This was  Oliver Barron, Gertrude's only brother, who was serving his articles in a lawyer's  office.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hullo!  Mr. Dyke! I've been sent for you,&quot; he said, as he caught Adam by the arm  and led him to the other end of the room; &quot;and I wanted to see you myself,  too. By George, you were a brick to send me that tennis set. Its the best  racquet&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Is  she in the room, or&mdash;or outside?&quot; interrupted Adam, whose eyes were  searching for Gertrude.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  just outside; It's the best racquet in the place,&quot; continued the lad,  enthusiastically, &quot;and I'm going to keep it for the intercolonial, if I'm  chosen. It's just my weight to a&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  there she is!&quot; cried Adam, as he caught sight of Gertrude. &quot;I'll have a  yarn with you, Oliver, later on.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  he's a good sort,&quot; murmured the young fellow, as he walked away, &quot;but  a rum beggar all the same.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  was sitting in a cosy corner at the end of the verandah, which was tastefully  decorated with palms and other foliage plants. As Adam approached she pointed  to the chair beside her.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  won't mind not dancing, will you, Mr. Dyke?&quot; she asked, with a smile.  &quot;The fact is, I want to have a talk with you, and until I've said what  I've got to say I really can't dance.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  I'd just as soon not dance,&quot; he answered eagerly. &quot;In fact,&quot; he added,  not seeing that his remark might bear an interpretation quite foreign to his meaning,  &quot;I'd sooner not dance when my dance is with you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  What I want to say is this,&quot; the girl proceeded, as she leant forward and  looked into his face. &quot;My father has told me of your unsolicited offer to  help him. He has told me how kindly, how thoughtfully you put it, and how much  you felt his position. Mr. Dyke, I've always heard that you were a generous man&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Pray,  Miss Barron&mdash;&quot; interrupted Adam, nervously.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  I'm afraid that I never truly appreciated how nobly generous you really are.  Mr. Dyke, I beg to thank you deeply for your kindness. It seems absurd to say  that if I can ever repay it I will do so, but if the opportunity ever <i>should</i> arise you will find that I am  neither forgetful nor ungrateful.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude's  words were simple enough, but she spoke with an earnestness that gave them an  especial value. There were tears in her eyes, and her voice was strangely low  as she pronounced the last words. Her emotion did not escape Adam, who was  distressed beyond measure that his offer of the morning should have been  repeated.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm&mdash;I'm  afraid you are making a great deal of a very little matter,&quot; he said nervously,  &quot;and&mdash;and I'd be awfully obliged if you wouldn't say anything more about  it. I just happened to hear, you know, and&mdash;and it wouldn't matter twopence to  me, and&mdash;and&mdash;and we'll say no more about it.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  gave him a grateful look.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  as you like, Mr. Dyke,&quot; she said. &quot;I shan't say anything more, but you  can't prevent me <i>thinking</i> about it.  Well!&quot; she added, as she prepared to get up, &quot;now that's over shall we go  inside?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  caught her by the arm. His hand was a great strong hand, but he touched her so  lightly that she hardly felt the pressure of his fingers.</p>
  <p>&quot;One  moment!&quot; he exclaimed in an eager whisper. &quot;I, too, have something to  say, and something that I have longed to say for many a long day. Gertrude, I  love you, and if you'll be my wife I shall be the happiest man on the face of  God's earth.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  had tried to prepare herself for the scene, but Adam had declared himself with so  much abruptness that she was quite disconcerted. She turned very pale, and two great  tears came into her eyes. For a moment she seemed as if she would speak, but  apparently the effort was too great and with a subdued sob she let her head  fall on her hands.</p>
  <p>Adam's  grief and consternation knew no bounds.</p>
  <p>&quot;Gertrude!  Miss Barron I mean! Forget that I've said anything at all,&quot; he cried. &quot;I  was a perfect brute to take advantage of the situation. But 'pon my soul I had  intended to ask you before I made that wretched offer this morning. I never  thought of it until after I'd spoken. If I had I wouldn't have been mean enough  to press the matter just now. I know that I'm only a rough fellow,&quot; he  said, applying the same phrase to himself that he had used at the morning's  interview, &quot;and that I haven't quite the polish and&mdash;and the style of the  people you are used to, but I'd do my best to make you happy, and I think,&quot;  he added in a touchingly simple way, &quot;that my love for you would teach me  the way.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he said these last words he leant forward, and gently removing one of the girl's  hands from her face, held it in his own.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  sure that you would make the best and most indulgent of husbands&quot; she said  in a low voice, &quot;and so sure am I of it that I will be your wife. May God  help me,&quot; she cried, as she broke afresh into tears, &quot;to make you a  good one.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  took her face between his great palms, and turning it up towards him looked  into it with a look of inexpressive love and admiration. He was a plain man,  but the feeling of exultation which possessed him that moment transfigured his  homely features. He leant over her and kissed her on the forehead, and the  action was one of reverence even more than of love.</p>
  <p>&quot;God  bless you, my darling!&quot; he whispered. &quot;God bless you!&quot;</p>
  <p>At  this moment footsteps were heard approaching them, and the next moment Oliver  Barron accosted his sister.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  say, Gertrude, this is our dance!&quot; he said in a highly injured tone,  &quot;and its half over already. It's a beastly shame of you! You're always  doing me out of dances. And I could have danced it with Polly Devrient,  too,&quot; he went on, in a more aggrieved tone than ever; &quot;and you know she&mdash;,  Hillo! What's up?&quot;</p>
  <p>He  had caught sight of Gertrude's face, and the tears, which still stood in her  eyes, did not escape him. He glanced from her to Adam Dyke who looked very  uncomfortable as he did so, and then from Adam Dyke to her.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-4-b.png" width="720" height="456"></p>
  <p>&quot;What's  up?&quot; he asked again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Nothing,  Oliver&mdash;I mean, nothing much,&quot; she answered, whilst Adam stood, to borrow  Oliver's elegant expression when subsequently describing the scene, like a  &quot;stuck pig.&quot; &quot;I haven't been very well, and&mdash;and&mdash;and I fancy that  I'd better go home.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  boy's face showed no little concern. He was much attached to his sister&mdash;they  were <i>mates</i>, as he termed it&mdash;and her  tears quite alarmed him.</p>
  <p>&quot;By  Jove! I'll fetch the Mum!&quot; he cried; and then, with an emphatic injunction  to Adam to &quot;stick to her,&quot; off he went for Mrs. Barron as fast as his  legs would carry him.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Barron's concern at her daughter's state was quite touching to witness, especially  whilst Adam Dyke and Oliver were standing by. However, when they had gone, in  obedience to her advice, that &quot;Gertrude would be better if she were quiet  for a little while,&quot; she picked up again quicker than one might have  expected.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  dear,&quot; she whispered anxiously, the while she pressed a scented  handkerchief to the girl's burning head, &quot;did you accept him?&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  looked up at her mother, and there was something in the girl's eyes that made  Mrs. Barron, old soldier as she was, lower hers.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  I did!&quot; Gertrude answered in a low voice. &quot;I suppose that you're  happy now.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed  I am!&quot; returned her mother; &quot;and so ought you to be, unless you are a  regular goose. You'll have the richest husband in the place, and, believe me,  money can purchase <i>anything</i>. Why, you  ought to be the happiest girl in the world!&quot;</p>
  <p>But  somehow Gertrude was not what she ought to have been. Letting her head fall on  her hands, she began crying again as if her heart would break.</p>
  <p>Later  in the evening, after Gertrude had been sent home under Oliver's charge, Mrs.  Barron dodged about amongst her acquaintances, and artfully spread the news of  Gertrude's engagement</p>
  <p>&quot;Only  think, Mrs. Dale,&quot; she said to the lady in apple-green, after she had  mysteriously bound her over to eternal secrecy, &quot;only think of my surprise  this evening when dear Gertrude told me that Mr. Dyke had proposed to her, and  that she had accepted him.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What?  he has <i>proposed?&quot;</i> cried Mrs.  Dale, as an angry flush brightened her cheek, for all that it was elaborately  painted and powdered.</p>
  <p>&quot;He  has indeed, and been accepted, too,&quot; answered Mrs. Barron, in a tone of  triumph that she could not repress. &quot;But it's to be kept a dead  secret&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  of course!&quot; interjected Mrs. Dale drily.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  dear Mrs. Dale!&quot; returned Mrs. Barron more blandly than ever, as she rose  to impart the news to someone else, &quot;and I trust that you won't even drop  a hint about the matter.&quot;</p>
  <p>Next  day the whole of Melbourne was in possession of the news.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk4"></a>Chapter  IV.<br>
    CYRIL PATON ROBS PETER TO PAY PAUL.</h2>
  <p>No  sooner had Gertrude taken her departure than Adam Dyke prepared to take his. As  he passed through the hall, hat in hand and with his coat on his arm, Mrs. Dale  accosted him.</p>
  <p>&quot;What,  Mr. Dyke,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;are you off already?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Y&mdash;yes,  Mrs. Dale,&quot; he stammered. &quot;The fact is I'm rather tired, and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The  attraction is gone,&quot; laughed Mrs. Dale as she completed the sentence.  &quot;I'm afraid you're a very sly man, Mr. Dyke, but I've guessed your little  secret. Am I to congratulate you?&quot; she asked, as she gave him a look full  of significance.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-5-b.png" width="432" height="600"></p>
  <p>Adam  blushed, and said something to the effect that he didn't quite understand her,  on which she shook her fan at him, and, wishing him good bye, passed into the  ballroom. He didn't like Mrs. Dale, and, as a rule, her conversation bothered  him; but for once he felt a curious sense of pleasure at her badinage.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  suppose that I look so happy that she has guessed the reason,&quot; he argued  as he told a waiter to call his hansom, &quot;and if I look as happy as I feel  I don't wonder at it.&quot;</p>
  <p>On  his way into Melbourne he thought over the scene of that night, and a strange  sense of exultation seized him. It seemed to him almost beyond belief that  Gertrude Barron, acknowledged by all to be the handsomest girl in Melbourne,  should have consented to be the wife of a homely fellow like him.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  ought to be the happiest man in the world,&quot; he reflected. &quot;Ought to  be? I am the happiest; and, by Heaven, if it depends on me, Gertrude shall be  the happiest wife. When I think of it, I can hardly believe my good  fortune!&quot; and then, as is usual with men of his simple, modest  disposition, he began to underrate himself. &quot;What the deuce she can see in  me, Heaven only knows.&quot;</p>
  <p>By  the time that the cab pulled up at the club he was in such an excited state  that he felt that sleep for the time being was out of the question. He asked  one of the waiters if any one was in the club, and was told that there were  some gentlemen in the cardroom. Thither he went.</p>
  <p>He  had hardly opened the door when he heard a voice, which he immediately  recognised as Cyril Paton's.</p>
  <p>&quot;May  I ask you what objection you have to change that I.O.U.?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  question was put in an angry tone, though Cyril spoke almost in a whisper. The  young man to whom it was addressed was also evidently somewhat put out, for he  made a movement of impatience, and his face flushed.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  seems to me,&quot; he said, as he evidently restrained himself, &quot;that I am  not bound to change I.O.U.'s at all, at any rate until the end of the  game.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  say you are!&quot; retorted Cyril, bringing down his fist on the table, &quot;and  I'll leave it to the table.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well?  I'll leave it to the table!&quot; acquiesced the other, as he cast a look round  the board. &quot;What's your decision?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  others&mdash;there were three of them&mdash;looked at each other, and it was evident they  had no intention of interfering.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  settle it between you,&quot; said one impatiently. &quot;If there are going to  be any rows, I'm off.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  young man with whom Cyril was disputing&mdash;Herbert Grainger was his name&mdash;shrugged  his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  if you won't settle it,&quot; he said, trying to assume an air of indifference,  &quot;I shall stand my ground, and refuse to cash the I.O.U.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  bounded out of his chair, and, leaning over the table, again asked Herbert  Grainger his reason for refusing to cash his paper.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  If you insist on my speaking,&quot; said the other, &quot;I shall do so, but  don't blame me if the result is unpleasant. Well, then, gentlemen, Mr. Paton  last Tuesday week&mdash;now, shall I go on?&quot; he asked of Cyril, who was still  standing up.</p>
  <p>&quot;Go  on! and be d&mdash;d to you!&quot; roared Cyril, whose face was quite disfigured by  passion.</p>
  <p>&quot;Last  Tuesday week Mr. Paton lost &pound;642 to me.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  did!&quot; interjected Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  has never paid me.&quot;</p>
  <p>If  a strong arm had not held him back, Cyril would have rushed at the speaker.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  an infernal lie!&quot; he cried. &quot;I gave you an I.O.U., payable next Tuesday.  I told you I had some money coming then, and that I was a bit short for the  moment.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't call that paying,&quot; Grainger said with contemptuous emphasis. &quot;I  decline to accept any more of your paper until that I already hold is  paid.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  would have spoken, but at that moment the same strong hand that had held him  back forced him into his chair.</p>
  <p>&quot;Excuse  me, gentlemen, for interfering,&quot; said Adam Dyke, &quot;but I have  overheard what has passed, and&mdash;and I think I see my way, with your permission,  of course, Mr. Paton&mdash;to settle this matter. To begin with, I'm afraid that I  myself am in no small degree responsible for the situation.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  men looked from one to another in no little surprise, but on no face was  amazement so clearly written as on Cyril Paton's.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  fact is, that Mr. Paton has a considerable sum of money to draw from me  over&mdash;over&mdash;over the sale of a station,&quot; he stammered, colouring as he did  so, and avoiding Cyril's eye, &quot;and I very foolishly never considered that  he might want the money. If I'd given the matter a thought,&quot; he went on as  he leant over Cyril, and looked into his face with an expression that plainly  implored him not to undeceive the rest of the party, &quot;I should have given  him a cheque ten days ago, and not waited for the matter to be completed.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  Paton's head fell on his breast, but he didn't speak a word. Herbert Grainger  got up from the table, and, walking round to Cyril's side, held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  All I can say is, that I'm devilish sorry over the whole matter,&quot; he said  in a frank manly way; &quot;and I offer you ten thousand apologies. If you'd  only given me a hint of how the land lay, I'd have sooner cut my tongue from my  mouth than have said what I did just now.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  still hung his head, and did not speak; but he accepted the proffered hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thanks,  old man,&quot; exclaimed Grainger, as he shook Cyril's hand warmly. &quot;I hope  you won't think any the worse of me over this wretched business.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I suppose the game is finished?&quot; said one of the others.</p>
  <p>Within  five minutes Adam Dyke was left alone with the man to whom he had proved such a  friend in need.</p>
  <p>For  a moment there was an awkward silence, and then Cyril, rising from his chair, seized  Adam by the hand. There were tears in his eyes, and his voice trembled as he  spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't know, Dyke, what I have ever done that you should befriend me in this  way,&quot; he cried; &quot;but as sure as there's a God in Heaven, if the  opportunity ever offers, I'll do my best to make you some return.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke had the modesty of simple men. Nothing distressed him more than  expressions of gratitude. In a few broken phrases he assured Cyril that he had  nothing to thank him for, and implored him to say no more about it.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  I may tell you this, Mr. Paton,&quot; he said in a singularly earnest tone of  voice, ''that I would have done for any one else what I have done for you.  To-night I have met with the greatest good fortune that I've ever had, and it  makes me even happier than I was before to know that on this day of all others  I have been able to do a friend a good turn. No! don't thank me!&quot; he  exclaimed, as Cyril was on the point of doing so. &quot;Come to me in the  morning, and we'll go into your affairs, and see what it will take to put you  straight. Well, good night.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  watched Adam as he left the room, and the expression of his face was one in  which shame and astonishment were equally represented.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well! That beats everything I ever heard of,&quot; was his comment. &quot;What  he did it for&mdash;what his possible motive could be&mdash;is more than I can understand.  But, by the Lord Harry,&quot; he cried, &quot;he's a white man!&quot; which  expression was the strongest in Cyril's vocabulary.</p>
  <p>The  next morning Cyril interviewed &quot;the white man,&quot; and came away with an  even better opinion of him than he had held overnight. Adam Dyke had entreated him  to make a clean breast of his difficulties, and after some hesitation he had  confessed that he was considerably in debt. But he shrank from acknowledging  how much he really owed. His debts were principally due for gambling and  betting, and he was frightened that if Adam really knew the sort of man he was,  he might draw back from helping him. He little knew Adam Dyke. Adam only saw in  him a friend in difficulties, whom it was in his power to help; and if he had  asked for ten times as much as he did, he would have been lent it without  demur.</p>
  <p>A  suspicion that he had not made the most of his opportunity crossed the young  man's mind as he sauntered down Collins-street to cash the cheque he had just  received.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  I'd known that he'd have shelled out so handsomely,&quot; he reflected, &quot;I  would have tapped him for more&mdash;for enough to pay everybody. It's so much more  convenient only to have one creditor.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  truth of this conviction was strongly impressed on him before he had gone a  hundred yards further. At the corner of Swanston-street he was accosted by a  little Jew, whose fingers were covered with diamonds, and whose clothes had  evidently been &quot;built&quot; with an eye to an advertisement.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  I thay, Mithter Paton,&quot; he said in a hoarse whisper, &quot;it's no uth talkin'!  I can't vait any longer. It ithn't as if you'd taken off-goods, but you 'ad the  real pick o' the bathket&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  talk nonsense!&quot; interrupted Cyril angrily. &quot;Directly you thought I  had lost what I could pay on settling-day, you would not lay me anything that  had a ghost of a show of winning.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  little Jew shrugged his fat shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ach!  yer always full of eggscuses!&quot; he said with an undisguised sneer.</p>
  <p>&quot;Excuses  or no excuses, I can't pay you just now,&quot; said Cyril bluntly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I'll tell you vat it is, then,&quot; said the bookmaker in a passion, &quot;if  you don't pay, I'll post you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Post  and be d&mdash;d to you!&quot; was Cyril's rejoinder, but he didn't look as indifferent  as his words might imply.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  vill!&quot; returned the little Jew. &quot;You're a regular shuffler. Ven I  goes to the club I shouldn't go, or else you ain't in. Ven I meets you in the  street I shouldn't meet you, and, o' corse, I shouldn't speak to you. But if you  puts your nose on the course, don't you make any mistake, I'll&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>What  his last threat was Cyril could only divine, for with an impatient gesture he  turned his back on the little man and walked briskly towards the bank.</p>
  <p>&quot;By  George! I made a mistake not to get enough to clear me!&quot; he reflected.  &quot;I wonder whether he would stand me again.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  went into the bank and cashed the cheque. He was standing on the steps outside  wondering where he could see Grainger, when that young man passed within a few  feet of him.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  very man I was looking for,&quot; he cried as he joined him. &quot;What was it I owed  you?&quot;</p>
  <p>And  thereupon, passing his arm through his, as if nothing had ever ruffled the calm  waters of their friendship, Cyril led Grainger off to the club to settle with  him, and to play him a game of pyramids. They played a pound a ball, and at the  close of the afternoon Mr. Grainger received another very handsome dividend out  of Adam Dyke's cheque.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I'm in great form just now,&quot; said Grainger, as the marker set up the balls  after dinner, when Cyril Paton was to have his &quot;revenge&quot; for his  afternoon's ill-success. &quot;I was devilish nearly going to the Drisberghs'  last night. I'm deuced glad I didn't, as it turns out. By-the-bye, do you know  Gertrude Barron? Oh! of course, you do. She is some relation of yours, isn't  she?''</p>
  <p>Cyril  was just going to &quot;break the balls.&quot; He looked up, and nodded an affirmative.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  she's engaged to be married.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What!&quot;  cried Cyril, starting up.</p>
  <p>&quot;She's  engaged to be married,&quot; repeated the other. Cyril drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&quot;Who  to?&quot; he asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Your  friend, Adam Dyke.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  stood for a moment as if he couldn't understand the news, and then with a  terrible oath brought his cue down on the edge of the billiard-table, and it  shivered into pieces.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk5"></a>Chapter  V.<br>
    CYRIL ABANDONS THE FIELD.</h2>
  <p>Cyril  Paton's rage on receipt of the news of Gertrude's engagement arose fully as  much from wounded vanity as from grief at losing his sweetheart. His name had  been coupled with hers for such a long time that he winced at the idea of the  comments which were sure to be made when the news became generally known.  &quot;They'll say that he has cut me out, and probably think it a good  joke,&quot; he reflected ruefully. &quot;Gertrude has treated me shamefully. To  think of her giving me up, and for a fellow like that, too;&quot; and as he  thought of his successor he instituted a mental comparison between Adam Dyke  and himself, which I need hardly say was wholly in his own favour. But what cut  him to the quick was that he should have laid himself under such an obligation  to his rival and at such a time. &quot;Pon my soul, I think I'm the unluckiest  beggar in the world!&quot; he sighed, as he recognised the utter impossibility  of repaying the sum that he had borrowed. &quot;And they talk about the  constancy of women. Bah! They're only constant when there's nothing to be  gained by being otherwise. But I'm blessed if I give her up without a struggle.  If I can only see her I will test the question as to which is strongest&mdash;her  love for me or Dyke's money. In any case,&quot; he added with spiteful  emphasis, &quot;I shall have the satisfaction of letting her know what I think  of her conduct.&quot;</p>
  <p>But  even that was denied him. When he went out to Heimweh, though he especially  asked to see Miss Barron and Miss Barron only, it was Mrs. Barron who received  him; He was in no mood to mince matters, and in a few blunt and indiscreet  sentences told Mrs. Barron why he had come.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  was quite prepared to hear something of this sort,&quot; Mrs. Barron said  quietly, after she had listened with the greatest patience to his somewhat  lengthy complaint, &quot;and I may tell you at once that I don't recognise that  you have been badly treated, as you call it, in the least, and Gertrude is  quite of my opinion.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't believe it,&quot; bluntly interjected Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  may please yourself as to whether you believe it or not,&quot; Mrs. Barron  proceeded, with a coolness that exasperated him to the last degree, &quot;but I  am only stating the bare truth. Gertrude has chosen for herself.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  untrue!&quot; Cyril exclaimed, excitedly; &quot;she has been forced into it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Nothing  of the kind,&quot; Mrs. Barron said with provoking coolness; &quot;her choice  was quite unfettered, and it happily fell on a man of whom both Mr. Barron and  myself highly approve.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;There's  no doubt about that,&quot; sneered Cyril, &quot;and the reason isn't far to  seek.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I see that you have come here to create a disturbance,&quot; said Mrs. Barron,  as she moved towards the door, &quot;and you shan't be gratified. I needn't say  that after the way you have behaved our doors will be closed to you.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  made a step towards her.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  see Gertrude in spite of you,&quot; he cried, absolutely shaking his fist at  her in his rage. &quot;She was engaged to me, and I'll take my dismissal from  her and her alone.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Gertrude  denies that she was ever engaged to you, and I shall certainly believe her in  preference to a man like you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;She was engaged,&quot; reiterated Cyril,  &quot;and we were to be married when&mdash;when I could afford to keep her.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Barron laughed derisively.</p>
  <p>&quot;When  you could afford to keep her! May I ask when that would be?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;That was  our understanding, anyhow!&quot; interjected Cyril doggedly.</p>
  <p>&quot;A  man talking of marrying,&quot; sneered Mrs. Barron, as she opened the door,  &quot;who has to let his friends pay his gambling debts.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  thrust was so unexpected that Cyril was dumb. He waited for a few minutes after  Mrs. Barron had left the room, half expecting that she would return, and then,  feeling dispirited and enraged almost beyond endurance, he took his departure.</p>
  <p>At  the gate whom should he meet but Adam Dyke, who greeted him with no little  warmth.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have often heard of your being here,&quot; he said; &quot;but somehow I have  always missed you. I have reasons&mdash;I'll tell you what they are some day&mdash; for  feeling very glad that you are a friend of the Barrons.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  mumbled something about being very glad to hear it, and then, with a hasty shake  of the hand, hurried away.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wonder whether he knows anything about Gertrude and myself,&quot; he reflected.  &quot;No! he can't! If he did, great blockhead as he is, I think he'd have more  tact than to speak to me as he did. By Heaven! I can't stand it, and if  Gertrude doesn't come round I shall clear out&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  did not come round. Though Cyril made several attempts to see her, they were  ineffectual. Sometimes he saw Mrs. Barron, sometimes Mr. Barron, and sometimes  Oliver, but whether he went to Heimweh morning, noon, or night, Gertrude was  denied him.</p>
  <p>When  a young man feels that his luck is &quot;dead out,&quot; he generally does his  best to ensure the truth of the surmise. Cyril had always been a gambler, but  he had never played as high or as consistently as he did now. When there was no  poker or loo, he played billiards. When there was nothing &quot;on&quot; at the  Club, he went elsewhere in search of speculation. He had never dabbled in  mining; he now plunged heavily whenever he could get a broker to sell him stock  on terms. At the end of a month he was in desperate straits again. There was  only one man in the world to whom he could look for any help, and&mdash;though there  is not the slightest doubt that he would have accepted Adam Dyke's assistance  had it been proffered him&mdash; he could not bring himself to ask it.</p>
  <p>Whether  he would have overcome this feeling or not I cannot say, but just at a time  when the necessity of doing so presented itself to him in the strongest light,  he was called away from Melbourne. His mother, who lived in Adelaide, was taken  seriously ill, and he was summoned from gambling and dissipation to what was  expected to be her death bed.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Adam Dyke was the happiest of men. Though Gertrude did not respond to his love  as warmly as he would have wished, she was invariably kind and gentle, and poor  Adam did not expect more. She was so immeasurably above him&mdash;so he thought&mdash;that  the most ordinary attention transported him into the seventh heaven. He heard  her praises at all hands&mdash;for every one, Mrs. Dale included, now lauded her up  to the skies&mdash;and the more he heard them the more he wondered at his singular  good fortune.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  she could have seen in me,&quot; he reflected in his simple way, &quot;is more  than I can understand. I should have thought that she could have had anyone she  liked. Now, if she had taken a fancy to Cyril Paton, for instance, who is a  good-looking young fellow, and clever, and agreeable, I shouldn't have been  surprised; but me,&quot; and then he would laugh to himself, the while his  great heart was brimming over with thankfulness.</p>
  <p>The  engagement was not to be a long one, and even before Cyril's departure the  preparations for the marriage were actively prosecuted. The Barrons were bent  on making a grand affair of it. The Bishop was to officiate. There were to be  eight bridesmaids, and two pages to hold up the bride's train. There were to be  300 guests to the breakfast, and there was to be a ball in the evening. And I  need not say that Adam Dyke was to pay for it all.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  Mr. Barron,&quot; he said one day, &quot;you must excuse me if I put a delicate  matter somewhat bluntly to you. I know that all these preparations will cost a  great deal of money. Now I happen to know that you cannot very well stand an  expense of the description, so you will&mdash;now do, like a good fellow&mdash;allow me  to take it on my shoulders.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron protested that he would do nothing of the kind, but Adam was so earnest  that at last the worthy merchant let him have his way. Indeed, he not only let  him have his way, but showed him various way's of spending his money which  assuredly would never have occurred to Adam's unpretentious mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  one does a thing one may as well do it well,&quot; smiled Mr. Barron, as he viewed  with an approving eye some extensive alterations in the house which had been  effected in view of the coming ceremony. &quot;What do you think, Adam?&quot;</p>
  <p>Of  course, Adam thought as he did.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  threw herself into the preparations with as much warmth as either her father or  mother. She felt the necessity of doing something. Inaction meant reflection,  and reflection misery. To do her justice she did her best to forget her old  lover, and to appreciate the touching devotion of the simple man who was her  slave. But oblivion is not at our beck and call. Cyril Paton was away, and when  he was in Melbourne she had refused to see him; but his memory was alive, and  each day the hunger to see him again gnawed with increasing strength at her  weak woman's heart.</p>
  <p>Not  that she showed it. Had anyone seen her selecting her trousseau they would have  thought her happy enough. Had they seen her furnishing the house in Collins-street  that Adam had bought for her they would have concluded that she was delighted  with the prospect before her. But if she deceived the world she couldn't  deceive herself, and when she was alone she would break down, and curse the  unhappy fate which had brought her to such a pass.</p>
  <p>I  have said that she deceived the world, but though the world in the sense that I  have used it would decidedly include Mrs. Barron, she did not deceive that  lady.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  dear David,&quot; said Mrs. Barron one night that they were discussing the  state of affairs, &quot;it's just as well that the marriage is coming off as  soon as it is. I can't depend on Gertrude. I never gave her credit for as much  feeling as she has. I knew that she was&mdash;was spasmodically emotional at times;  but I certainly thought that at the bottom she was&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;&quot;  (Mrs. Barron here coughed behind her plump hand), &quot;a little worldly. Had  an eye to the main chance, in fact.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You  thought she took after her mamma,&quot; laughed Mr. Barron.</p>
  <p>&quot;Let  us say after both of us,&quot; retorted the lady. &quot;Now, of course, it's  very dreadful that Mrs. Paton, your sister Emma, should be so ill, but it  really is most fortunate that something should have happened to take Cyril out  of the way.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron was sitting in front of the fire. As he looked at the kindling blaze he  felt the edge of his nails, a sure sign that he was turning something over in  his mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you know, Bessie, that I've had my doubts of Gertrude lately, though not quite  in the same way that you have. If Cyril were to come back now, though it would  cost her much to refuse him, she would refuse him, and marry Dyke. But it is  about ourselves that I'm uneasy.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Ourselves!&quot;  interjected Mrs. Barron.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  my dear, ourselves!&quot; replied her husband, as he looked more intently than  ever into the fire. &quot;Of course we have expected, we still expect, to  profit by her marriage.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;It  has lately struck me that if Gertrude sacrifices herself&mdash;that is what she would  call it&mdash;she will do so for her own benefit, and we may be left out in the  cold.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Barron's brow contracted.</p>
  <p>&quot;We'll  see about that!&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Gertrude has a lot to learn  before she is a match for her mother.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk6"></a>Chapter  VI.<br>
    THE SHORT CUT TO FORTUNE.</h2>
  <p>At  the moment that Mr. and Mrs. Barron were rubbing their hands with satisfaction  at the fact of Cyril Paton's absence in South Australia, that young gentleman  was already on his way back to Victoria. His mother had taken a turn for the  better, and had he been asked he would probably have given that as his reason  for the step he was taking. As a matter of fact it had but little to do with  it, and I'm afraid that had her case been infinitely more desperate than it was  he would have returned to Melbourne. Two powerful motives impelled him. The  Melbourne Cup was to be run on November 6, and on the Wednesday after  Gertrude's wedding was to take place. At first sight there seems but little  connection between the two events, but they bore a close affinity in Cyril's  mind, and he had good reason for coupling them, as we shall see further on.</p>
  <p>Though  Cyril's position with the Ring had been most unsatisfactory for a long time  past, he had but little difficulty until quite recently in getting bookmakers  to bet with him. He had been in difficulties before, and had always managed to  scrape out of them, and there were few of his creditors but believed that he  would pull through this time, though if they had been asked how he was to do so  they would have been puzzled for an answer. Besides, he had always been a man  who &quot;took a good price,&quot; and a bookmaker's heart goes out to a careless  backer.</p>
  <p>Cyril  had backed several doubles over the Derby and Cup in the winter, and had even  taken some large wagers on the same races quite a year before they came off.  Some of these were &quot;dead,&quot; as it is termed, the horses having been  either not entered or scratched, but some of them were in great request, and  had advanced to a very short price indeed.</p>
  <p>Now,  though the bookmakers had a kindly feeling towards Cyril, the feeling was  somewhat modified when their pockets were in danger. They could now lay a very  short price about the double he had backed (it was Chester and Chester for the  memorable Cup of 1877), and the &quot;metallician&quot; dearly likes a good  mark for his really &quot;good goods.&quot; Cyril was quite aware of all this,  for he had been in the same predicament before. He was not, then, surprised to  find three letters from members of the ring awaiting him on his arrival, which  requested him to post the money for his wagers before the Derby day. He pulled  a long face as he crunched up the letters in his hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Post  the money! How the deuce am I to do it?&quot; he reflected. &quot;Post it,  indeed! I wish that all the Jews&mdash;aye, and Christians, too&mdash;that ever made a  book, were at the bottom of the sea; d&mdash; them!&quot;</p>
  <p>But  curses and ill wishes did not help him to arrive at a solution of his  difficulty. Lighting a cigar, he went into the club smoking-room and sitting  down in a chair tried to think his position out.</p>
  <p>&quot;However  I get the money,&quot; he reflected, &quot;it must be got. I never had such a  strong presentiment of success as this time. And so much depends on it, too. I  wonder whether old Naumann,&quot; this was a well-known money-lender of the  day, &quot;would stand me for a few hundreds. I hardly think it. He never  forgave me for not paying him up when I won over Briseis. But who is there to  put it up for me?&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he asked himself the question, a figure appeared in the doorway which answered  it. Cyril's heart gave a great bound, but his face coloured; for, debased as he  was, he had some sense of shame left in him.</p>
  <p>Adam  greeted him with the greatest cordiality. He liked Cyril, and had greatly  missed him,</p>
  <p>&quot;I  am so glad you are back,&quot; he said, with no little warmth, after they had  exchanged greetings. &quot;You'll be able to be at my wedding, to-day fortnight.  Oliver Barron is to be best man, but I would take it as an especial  favour,&quot; he said earnestly, &quot;if you would be one of the  groomsmen.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  turned scarlet.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  the fact is&mdash;&quot; he began.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  won't take a refusal!&quot; laughed Adam Dyke, good-naturedly.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  was going to say,&quot; stammered Cyril, feeling and looking most  uncomfortable, &quot;that my stay is so uncertain. You know my mother&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke's face grew grave.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  say no more, my dear fellow,&quot; he said gently, as he laid his broad hand on  Cyril's shoulder. &quot;I can quite understand that you wouldn't like to be  present at anything of the sort, whilst Mrs. Paton's case is so serious. Well!  how have you been getting on?&quot; he asked in a cheerful tone. &quot;I hope  that you have been doing well.&quot;</p>
  <p>For  the moment Cyril did not answer. Then, impelled by a sudden impulse, he held  out the crumpled letters, which he still held in his hand, to Adam Dyke.</p>
  <p>&quot;Read  those,&quot; he said, &quot;and you will see.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke took the letters, and straightened them out on his broad knee.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you really mean me to read them,&quot; he asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  shouldn't have handed them to you unless I did,&quot; growled Cyril, throwing himself  back in his chair and nursing his knee.</p>
  <p>Adam  read them, and as he read his face grew grave.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't quite understand&mdash;I'm not a betting man, you know,&quot; he explained;  &quot;I don't quite understand all this, but I gather that you are in difficulties,  and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  the fact of the matter is this,&quot; interrupted Cyril excitedly. &quot;They  know that I've the best of them, and now, just because I owe them a few  hundreds, they want to force me to scratch the bets. If I had backed horses  that had no show they'd take their chance of getting the money fast  enough.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke leant forward and again placed his hand on Cyril's shoulder, as he looked  him earnestly in the face.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wish&mdash;I wish you didn't bet,&quot; he said gravely. &quot;You know&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What  does it matter?&quot; interrupted Cyril &quot;One must do something! Why not  bet as well as anything else?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke leant back in his chair, and bit his lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;As  you will, Paton.&quot; he said quietly, and taking up the letters he read them  again. &quot;Now, Paton,&quot; he asked, after he had perused them, &quot;what  would it take to put you straight? I don't mean only to defray these debts&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't owe those yet,&quot; blurted out Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  to put you absolutely on your legs, so that you won't owe a shilling in the  world.&quot; Cyril reflected a moment.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  I can't say for certain,&quot; he answered. &quot;A couple of thousand I should  say. Three thousand at the outside. But what is the use of discussing the  question,&quot; he exclaimed impatiently, &quot;when I have no more chance of  paying than of floating a company to work gold mines in the mountains of the moon.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Adam Dyke again straightened out the letters, and  then folded them up with no little care into the original creases, before handing  them back to Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you&mdash;you will accept my assistance,&quot; he stammered&mdash;&quot;I mean as a loan,  mere temporary assistance&mdash;I think that&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  Paton jumped to his feet, and pressed his hands to his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  can't do it, Dyke; I can't!&quot; he cried whilst tears came to his eyes.  &quot;I'm sure that I should be able to pay you, but if by any chance I  couldn't, I&mdash;. No! I can't accept it! I can't.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke persisted in his offer, and Cyril for a while held to his refusal. But, in  the end, the money was accepted&mdash;as a loan, of course&mdash;and Cyril's heart was  easier than it had been for months.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  hard lines,&quot; he reflected afterwards, &quot;to have to accept help from  the beggar, but what the deuce am I to do? After all, I can pay him back soon  enough. Chester is a moral certainty for the Derby, and if he wins the double  Dyke can have his money back with interest.&quot;</p>
  <p>After  dinner that evening, Cyril, accompanied by Grainger and one or two others, went  round to the betting-rooms and, having settled up all his old scores, insisted  on posting the amount of his bets over the Derby and Cup.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  there is no necessity for that now,&quot; said one of the bookmakers, taking  him aside. &quot;Everyone is satisfied that you are good for the money. They  didn't like your betting so heavily when you owed them so much money over the  Metropolitan. That was all. You see, you haven't shown yourself here lately,  and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And,  by Heaven, if a man doesn't show himself for a few weeks, he's to be treated  like this,&quot; interrupted Cyril angrily, as he opened one of the letters,  and struck the page with the back of his hand. &quot;Show myself! They'll wish  I'd never shown myself to-night. What price Chester to five hundred pounds  cash?&quot; he called out, addressing the room at large, as he took a roll of  notes from his pocket and held them up in his hand.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-8-b.png" width="434" height="600"></p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  lay you twelve hundred to it,&quot; said a bookmaker, as he elbowed his way  through the crowd; &quot;but put your money in your pocket. I'd book it to  you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  take it,&quot; said Cyril, as he wrote down the bet on his cuff. &quot;I'll  take it again.&quot;</p>
  <p>A  little Jew stepped forward, the same that had threatened to post him the day  that he had cashed Adam Dyke's first cheque.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  lay you two huddred and fifty to a huddred, sir,&quot; he lisped out in a quite  deferential tone.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  will not,&quot; said Cyril decisively.</p>
  <p>&quot;You'd,  better take it, sir,&quot; the man said persuasively, but with an uneasy look  in his face.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  see you hanged first,&quot; exclaimed Cyril angrily. &quot;I don't forget what  you said to me in Collins-street, if you do. Here, who will lay me odds to &pound;500  more about Chester for the Derby?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  little Jew, with a shrug of his shoulders and a smile of ill-simulated indifference,  turned on his heel.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  I ever gets Mithter Paton on the hip,&quot; he said to a brother bookmaker, as  he clenched his fist and struck the other palm with great force, &quot;I won't  let him off as lightly as I did this time. I'll be even with him if it costs me  a huddred guiddees.&quot;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  those bookmakers who had Chester to lay were round Cyril Paton as thick as  bees. &quot;Take mine, take mine, take mine,&quot; cried 20 voices at once.  They fought for possession of him. Those who were not able to lay him bets  viewed with greedy eyes their more fortunate <i>confr&eacute;res</i>. They elbowed their way to the front in the hope of  making a wager with him. They cursed their ill-luck, aye and they cursed him,  though the curse was not uttered, when at last he declared that he had taken  all he wanted.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  got &pound;2,500 to &pound;1,000, haven't I, Grainger?&quot; he asked of his friend, who  had been keeping a tally for him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes!  that's it! Don't take any more,&quot; whispered Grainger, who had long been  anxious for Cyril to go back to the club. &quot;Let's go! This atmosphere suffocates  me.&quot;</p>
  <p>Passing  his arm through Cyril's he dragged him off, to the disgust of those bookmakers  who had still money to lay.</p>
  <p>At  the door they were met by one of the principal bookmakers, who had been absent  during the greater portion of the evening.</p>
  <p>&quot;Want  anything for the Cup, Mr. Paton?&quot; he asked in his most polite tones, for  he had heard that Cyril had settled up his old score.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes!  what will you lay me Chester?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Hundreds  to four, sir; a fair price.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;How  much?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  bookmaker had his book in his hand. He consulted it for a moment, chewing the  end of his pencil as he did so.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  much do you want, sir?&quot; he asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Five  thousand to two hundred.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  lay it to you,&quot; answered the bookmaker, as he booked it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Are  you raving mad?&quot; asked Grainger angrily, as they descended the stairs  leading to the street. &quot;Why, if Chester doesn't win you'll lose  thousands.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  laughed. His face was flushed, and his eyes shone like burnished steel.</p>
  <p>&quot;He'll  win, right enough!&quot; he cried. &quot;Now, let us have a game of  poker.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk7"></a>CHAPTER  VII.<br>
    IN WHICH CYRIL PATON REPAYS A LOAN, AND DAVID BARRON CONTRACTS ONE.</h2>
  <p>With  no member of the Barron family was Adam Dyke so popular as with Oliver. Mr. and  Mrs. Barron had been attracted to him in the first instance by wealth alone,  and though they had ended by being won over by his unselfishness and his kindly  disposition, a certain tincture of contempt blended itself with their liking  for him. Gertrude, too&mdash;though she was touched by his unflagging devotion to  her&mdash;could not forget, poor girl, that he had supplanted Cyril. But Oliver's  feeling for him was one of unmitigated affection, he had met with great  kindness at Adam's hands, and he had the enthusiastic gratitude of a boy.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  word, Gertrude,&quot; he said one day to his sister, &quot;you don't half know  what a good fellow Adam is. He's too good&mdash;'pon my word he is. Everyone seems to  get everything out of him they can.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  they?&quot; she asked languidly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes;  that they do. He's always got his hand in his pocket, and some of the fellows  who are loafing on him are real duffers. Now, do you know, I think he's lent  Cyril Paton money. I'm sure he has.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No,  no,&quot; exclaimed his sister, turning pale.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  But I'm sure of it,&quot; resumed Oliver emphatically. &quot;Mr. Grainger was  talking about it at the Drisberghs' yesterday afternoon.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  Mr. Grainger ought to be ashamed of himself,&quot; interjected Gertrude,  flushing to the roots of the hair.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  a bit of it!&quot; retorted the boy. &quot;Why should he be? You know that  Cyril Paton hasn't a shilling, and yet he turned up at the betting-rooms the  other night with a hatful of money, and the notes were South Sea Bank ones too,  and&mdash;and he had an interview with Adam in the smoking-room, and&mdash;and &mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  put her fingers in her ears, and tears started to her eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Stop,  Oliver! you cruel boy!&quot; she cried.</p>
  <p>The  boy's face grew grave, and he sat down beside her on the sofa. He put his arm  round her waist and kissed her cheek.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  old Gertrude!&quot; he said. &quot;I always thought you were fond of Cyril, but  I hoped that you had got over it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;So  I have!&quot; interjected Gertrude, trying to regain her composure.</p>
  <p>&quot;No  you haven't, Gertrude! You haven't by a long way,&quot; Oliver said seriously,  &quot;and I'm awfully sorry about it. I can't see what you see in Cyril. He's  beastly selfish and bad-tempered, and he thinks a dashed sight more of himself  than anyone else does. He owes money all over the place. Why there isn't  a tradesman&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  of course Mr. Dyke is much richer,&quot; Gertrude admitted.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh! It isn't on that account that I like Adam the best,&quot; exclaimed the boy  with no little warmth. &quot;No; Adam is so straightforward and thoughtful. Why  you have only to mention a thing and it's done if it's in his power. Why you  know yourself that when I said how much I'd like to have a horse, I had no idea  of getting one out of him. I didn't know that he was even listening to me&mdash;and  there he went and made me a present of Banjo.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, it was very good of him,&quot; Gertrude murmured.</p>
  <p>&quot;Good  is no name for him,&quot; cried the boy enthusiastically. &quot;He's the  greatest brick I ever knew, and worth a paddock full of Cyril Patons.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  propounded this comparison with a warmth that precluded the possibility of  reply, nor did Gertrude attempt to redeem Cyril in her brother's eyes. She knew  that much of what he said was true, and her heart sank as she recognised the  futility of defending her old lover.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver,&quot;  she called out, as her brother was leaving the room, &quot;I want you a moment.  I don't want to discuss this subject any more, dear,&quot; she said in a  pleading tone, &quot;because&mdash;because I feel it very much. Please don't talk of  it to me again. And Oliver,&quot; she added, as she caught him by the hand,  &quot;you won't say anything to Mr. Dyke about Cyril and me, will you,  dear?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  boy promised, and he kept his word.</p>
  <p>But  there were those who were not bound by any promise of secrecy, and the news came  to Adam's ears, notwithstanding precautions taken not only by Gertrude, but by  Mr. and Mrs. Barron. His feeling was one of pure sorrow and sympathy for Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  devil!&quot; he reflected, as a compassionate look came into his honest eyes.  &quot;No wonder that he's going to the dogs. I wonder that he doesn't hate me. I  wonder that he can stay here. <i>I</i> couldn't.  But, then, if Gertrude were to give <i>me</i> up&mdash;it would kill me, I'm sure it would,&quot; and the very idea brought a still  graver look into his eyes. &quot;I only wish that I could tell him how much I  feel for him, but I suppose I can't,&quot; he reflected.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  beggar! If I can do anything for him I will.&quot;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the young man whose position caused him such grave uneasiness was doing his  best to do him a great wrong. Whilst there was no other lover in the field,  Cyril had taken matters very coolly, content to be on intimate terms with  Gertrude without pressing for any definite engagement. But her acceptance of  Adam Dyke had kindled a fire in him of which he had never conceived the  existence. Whilst he was sure of her, he was but an indifferent suitor; now  that he had lost her, he became an ardent lover.</p>
  <p>He  had written to her repeatedly, but his letters had invariably been returned to  him unopened. He had called at the house, as I have said, several times, but  Mrs. Barron was true to her word&mdash;the doors were stubbornly closed to him. This  was before his trip to Adelaide, and now on his return he made renewed efforts  to effect his object. He met with unexpected success. The very first day that  he went out to Toorak he caught sight of her in a part of the garden remote  from the house. A moment afterwards he was by her side. She started back when  she saw him, and turned as white as if she had seen a ghost.</p>
  <p>&quot;Cyril!  Cyril! you here,&quot; she cried, as she thrust him away and looked from side  to side in an agony of fear lest they should be seen together.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  my darling!&quot; he answered, and he drew her towards him, and kissed her with  more passion than he had ever displayed when he was permitted to do so.  &quot;Yes, and what is more, I intend to remain.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  still struggled to get free, but her efforts were but half-hearted. Her joy at  seeing him outweighed her fear of detection, and the tears that came into her  eyes were not tears of grief.</p>
  <p>&quot;Come  here, Gertrude, where we've sat so often and been so happy,&quot; he said, as  he led her to a sheltered seat, &quot;and let us talk the matter over. There's  much in the past that we must both regret, but for Heaven's sake let us make no  more mistakes. In your hands lies the happiness of us both. There's yet time to  avert what would be&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-8-a.png" width="454" height="600"></p>
  <p>&quot;There's  no time, Cyril! It can't be thought of,&quot; she cried, distractedly.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  tell you there is! You don't know this man&mdash;you don't know him as I do. That he  loves you I haven't the slightest doubt, and loves you well, but I tell you  that if he thought that by marrying you he was giving you pain he'd rather cut  off his right hand than carry it through.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What  am I to do?&quot; asked Gertrude, biting her lip, whilst tears streamed down  her face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do?  Why put the case plainly before him. Tell him the truth, Gertrude&mdash;that's all I  ask you&mdash;tell him the truth.&quot;</p>
  <p>A  bright spot came into the girl's cheeks, and she cast down her eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  can't do it,&quot; she said.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  can!&quot; Cyril cried angrily.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  cannot,&quot; she repeated, &quot;how can I go to him at this last moment and  acknowledge that I have loved another man all along. Think what it would  be,&quot; she exclaimed passionately, as she turned her face to Cyril, and laid  her hands on his arm. &quot;He is so good and thoughtful. He seems to study my  lightest thought, to live but to please me. How can I shatter his happiness at  such a time and with such a blow?&quot;</p>
  <p>An  angry gleam came into Cyril's eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  didn't consider me a few months ago,&quot; he cried, as he cast off her hands  from his arm, &quot;when you sent me off like a dog. Why should this man be  treated with more consideration? What has he done to deserve it? Has he loved  you better?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  treat him as you did me.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  can't,&quot; faltered the girl, shaking her head and sobbing bitterly.</p>
  <p>&quot;By  Heaven, you shall,&quot; he cried, as he jumped up from the seat, and, utterly  regardless as to whether he was seen or not, took several hasty steps backwards  and forwards on the gravel path. &quot;Now look here, Gertrude,&quot; he said  in a calmer voice, as he sat down again and laid a hand gently on her shoulder,  &quot;I want you to thoroughly understand me. If I can't have you by fair  means, I'll have you by foul. Now, will you explain to this man how matters  have stood between us, and trust to his magnanimity to release you from your  engagement?&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  hung her head but did not speak.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  means that you won't. Very well. Then I shall take other measures.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  Cyril! What will you do?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Do?  I'll tell you later on. First of all, give me your word that you will meet me  here on Monday at the same time.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  can't, Cyril, I can't,&quot; sobbed the girl.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you don't you'll only have yourself to blame,&quot; cried Cyril, with  threatening emphasis.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  looked into his eyes, and he read her answer before she spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  meet you, Cyril.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  caught her in his arms, and kissed her again and again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thanks,  my darling,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Who  that takes an interest in racing could ever forget the excitement over the  Derby of 1877, an excitement which was heightened by the fluctuations in the  betting market for a month beforehand. It is true that Chester, the winner, had  almost always been first favourite, but at different times First King and  Woodlands ran him close. There were rumours, as there are every year, of  wonderful trials. First King was reported to have done a mile and a half down  at Geelong that broke the record, and Lockleys, so late as November 2, did a  gallop which caused him to be in great demand. Then it was reported that if  sufficient inducement were offered Woodlands would start, and there were not  those wanting, and good judges too, who averred that if he did he would lower  the great gun's colours. No one anticipated that it would be as easy a victory  as it turned out, and even Chester's most enthusiastic supporters were not  prepared to see him win as easily as he did. &quot;There isn't a horse in  England could beat me this day,&quot; his trainer was reported to have said,  but people, and especially trainers, make such wild assertions when the merits  of a favourite horse are being discussed, that but little attention was paid to  the remark. However, the result almost justified the assertion. Slightly before  the turn Chester began to leave the field, and though Pluto made a gallant bid  for victory, the issue was never in doubt</p>
  <p>Cyril  Paton's good fortune was as much discussed as the racing itself, and many an  envious eye was cast at him as he was paid over his winnings on the Monday  morning. He had won some &pound;7,000, and as he had coupled Chester with all the  favourites for the Cup, the probabilities were that he would land a very handsome  stake over the meeting.</p>
  <p>The  first thing that he did was to pay Adam Dyke, for that debt weighed like lead  on his usually elastic conscience.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  Dyke,&quot; he said to the latter, as he took him aside after lunch on settling  day, &quot;I want to square up with you. Let's see; how much was it that I owed  you?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  possession of money makes all of us more independent; but Cyril's independence  was of such an exaggerated type that it would have disgusted anyone more  observant that Adam Dyke.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  was four thousand,&quot; said Adam, as he consulted his pocket-book; and then  he added, in a hearty tone, &quot;I'm so glad that you have had a stroke of  luck, and are in a position to get out of your difficulties.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  words were kind, and were kindly meant, but they jarred on Cyril's nerves as  few words had ever done before.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  do you mean?&quot; he asked, testily. &quot;That you weren't going to get paid  unless I won?&quot;</p>
  <p>A  look of surprise as much as of pain came into Adam's face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  in the least,&quot; he said earnestly. &quot;I only meant to congratulate you on  your good fortune, which gave me great pleasure. If I have hurt your feelings I  heartily apologise.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  of course accepted the apology, and the matter dropped; but the look of pain  lingered on Adam's face long after Cyril had left him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  fellow,&quot; he reflected. &quot;My engagement must be a great blow to him.  I'm afraid that we can never be friends.&quot;</p>
  <p>That  afternoon Cyril went to Heimweh. Gertrude was at her post. She looked pale and  ill, and at first her languor contrasted strongly with his excitement; but as  he told the story of his good fortune, and described to her the further luck  that might be in store for him, she caught some of his spirit, and her face  brightened.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  so glad, dear,&quot; she cried, &quot;for I couldn't bear to hear of you being badly  off.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  caught her in his arms and thanked her with a kiss.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now  listen, Gertrude, and don't interrupt me,&quot; he said, putting his arm round  her waist and pressing her close to his side. &quot;I bet more heavily on the  Derby than I ever did in my life; but I had more to win than money, though the  money may win me&mdash;<i>may</i> win me&mdash;<i>will</i> win me that which I value most in  the world. The only bar to our happiness was that I was a poor man. I've now a  few thousands, and if Chester wins the Cup I'm a rich man. The obstacle to our  marriage no&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Stop,  stop, Cyril!&quot; the girl cried, as she buried her face on his chest.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  say the obstacle no longer exists,&quot; repeated Cyril, &quot;and that you  must marry me. Say that you will, Gertrude, and make me the happiest man in  Australia.&quot;</p>
  <p>A  faint sob was the only reply. Cyril repeated the question, and as he did so  lifted her head up and looked into her eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  dear?&quot; he asked tenderly.</p>
  <p>For  a moment longer the issue was in doubt, but for a moment only. &quot;May God  forgive me!&quot; Gertrude cried, and again hid her face.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>At  the identical time that this meeting was going on Gertrude's father was pacing  his office in a very unenviable frame of mind. The firm of &quot;David Barron  and Company&quot; had seen many ups and downs, but it had never found itself in  such a desperate strait as on that day. To do him justice Mr. Barron was, as a  rule, a man of nerve, and in the past his pluck had often averted an apparently  certain ruin. But now he was at his wit's end, and a succession of reverses had  for the time being utterly unnerved him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  my hopes rest on this man,&quot; he reflected, as he felt the edge of his nails  impatiently, and walked up and down the room with a quick step. &quot;If he  fails me it's all up with me. I haven't a friend in the place who would help  me. A friend? There's hardly a business man here but would give a sly chuckle  at my downfall. Well; I wonder when he will be here!&quot; he went on, as he  looked at the door with some anxiety, and listened for footsteps in the outer  office. &quot;I hope he has got my message. If he has he is sure to come.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  sat down at his desk, and taking up a pen began tracing lines on the blotting-pad.  His face was unusually pale, and any one who knew him had only to look at him  to see that he was greatly upset.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  the most unlucky thing in the world that it should have happened at this  precise time,&quot; he went on as he threw the pen impatiently from him, and  leant back in his chair, &quot;a month earlier or a month later it would not  have mattered so much. I could have asked a favour of the sort much more  readily a month ago than now, and a month hence there would have been no  difficulty at all. Well! I've got to take my chance. If he'll help me, well and  good. If he won't there is only one thing to be done&mdash;turn insolvent,&quot; and  at the thought he bit his thin under-lip with a strength that left the mark of  each tooth. &quot;I've been near it before, too near to be pleasant, but it's  hard at my age to have to face the possibility&mdash;the probability of it. However,  there is no use anticipating evil. Dyke can pull me through if he chooses, and  as he is to marry my daughter&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>The  thought was left uncompleted. There was a heavy step in the outer office, and  the next moment one of the clerks announced the man whose name was on his lips.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron went forward to meet him, and shook him by the hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sit  down, Adam,&quot; he said, pointing to a chair, whilst he himself turned the  lock in the door. &quot;I've something very particular to speak to you about.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam's  thoughts were so occupied with Gertrude that he immediately jumped to the  conclusion that the impending revelation concerned her.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  hope it's nothing about Gertrude,&quot; he said anxiously, as he looked with  uneasy eyes at Mr. Barron's serious face.</p>
  <p>The  merchant drew up a chair near him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  exactly,&quot; he answered in a low voice, &quot;and yet it may reflect, so  unjust is the world, it may reflect on her.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  hope not!&quot; interjected Adam.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  may, however,&quot; resumed Mr. Barron; &quot;but of that you can judge for  yourself. Adam Dyke, I am a ruined man. Unless assistance falls from the  clouds&mdash;for I know no other place whence it may come&mdash;the firm of 'David Barron  and Company' must go insolvent. A series of misfortunes has overtaken  me&mdash;misfortunes that it was impossible to provide against. In the past I have  had difficulties, great difficulties, and I have overcome them, but I tell you  candidly that there is no hope of doing so this time.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  news was so different from what Adam had expected that he gave an unmistakable  sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>&quot;Of  course you will have at once understood my reason for sending for you,&quot;  resumed Mr. Barron. &quot;I know that when you proposed to Gertrude you were  not actuated by anything except your love for the dear girl, but now that our  circumstances are likely to be so very different&mdash;so painfully, painfully  different,&quot; he said, as he leant his head on his hands, &quot;it is only  fair to you to release you from your engagement.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam's  colour rose, and he gave a nervous cough.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  isn't&mdash;it isn't Gertrude's wish to be released, is it?&quot; he asked anxiously.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  at all!&quot; Mr. Barron exclaimed, with unusual quickness.</p>
  <p>A  look of satisfaction came into Adam's face, which Mr. Barron rightly read as a  good omen for his cause.</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  nothing more need be said about it,&quot; said Adam, speaking with no little  warmth. &quot;Nothing could alter my desire to make Gertrude my wife.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Adam Dyke said this he got up from his chair, somewhat to the dismay of Mr.  Barron, who half thought that he was going off without taking the bait which  had been so prominently tendered him, and took a few paces up and down the  room.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  hate dealing with fools, useful as they are at times,&quot; reflected the  worthy merchant, as he stole a cautions glance at the man whom he thus  contemptuously described. &quot;I hope the beggar will make the first advance;  it's so devilish unpleasant having to ask a favour without any assistance from  the man one asks it from.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  matter was not long in doubt. Adam Dyke was too well used to considering others  to be long engrossed with his own affairs.</p>
  <p>&quot;But,  I say,&quot; he cried, pulling up short in his little walk, &quot;the first  thing is to see what can be done for you. Turn insolvent, eh? Not whilst I  have a penny to my credit.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was Mr. Barron's turn to give a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  cannot tell you how much I appreciate your kindness,&quot; he said, with  warmth; and for once his manner was the genuine expression of his feeling.  &quot;But I'm afraid that I'm too heavily involved for even <i>your</i> purse.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-5-a.png" width="533" height="600"></p>
  <p>&quot;Not  a bit of it&quot; interrupted Adam, heartily. &quot;Let us go into the matter,  and we will soon see, at any rate.&quot;</p>
  <p>Though  Adam had been long used to large figures, the revelations of Mr. Barron as to  his indebtedness somewhat took his breath away. However, he expressed his  willingness to &quot;see him through,&quot; as he called it and gave him a  large cheque on account to tide him over for the time being.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  thought he was a clever man, but it strikes me he's a donkey,&quot; mused the  fool as he left the merchant's office: &quot;of course, I mean in money  matters,&quot; he hastened to add, as if he had wronged the reputation of  Gertrude's father. &quot;My money is gone, but it can't be helped. I would pay  three times the sum to save poor Gertrude the grief of knowing the truth.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  merchant sat looking at the cheque which he held at half-arm in his lean  fingers, and as he did so a look of indescribable triumph lit up his mean eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;A  fool and his money are soon parted,&quot; he reflected, as his thin lip curled  with contempt. &quot;And what a fool, and what money!&quot; He here cast an  approving glance at the cheque. &quot;I think if he had known the precise value  of my correspondent's paper, that even he, rich as he is, would have shirked  the business.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk8"></a>Chapter  VIII.<br>
    CHESTERS CUP.</h2>
  <p>Cyril's  confidence in Chester's ability to win the Cup did not abate one jot as the  hour for testing the question approached. He was unaffected by the State of the  betting market, and he did not care two pins whether Chester was first favourite  or not. When tipsters, and tipsters that he had hitherto paid no little  attention to, assured him that Savanaka, and Woodlands, and Robinson Crusoe&mdash;ay,  and half a dozen others&mdash;were sure to beat his selection he listened to them  with what patience he could command, but stuck to his opinion more resolutely  than ever. When it was pointed out to him that as he had taken most of his  money at long prices he could &quot;hedge&quot; it so that he would still stand  to win a large sum at a minimum risk, he bluntly returned that he &quot;wouldn't  lay off a shilling.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  quite appreciate all you say, my dear fellow,&quot; he said to Grainger, as  they drove out to the course, &quot;but you are only wasting your time trying  to persuade me. Savanaka may have cleared out the whole of Wilson's stable, as  you say, and I allow that he will be bad to beat, but I tell you that I have  such a strong presentiment&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Presentiments  be hanged!&quot; impatiently interrupted Grainger. &quot;Just fancy backing  horses, in the nineteenth century, too! by presentiment.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  admit it sounds nonsense,&quot; Cyril acknowledged, with a nervous laugh,  &quot;but nothing can shake me in my determination to see it out.&quot;</p>
  <p>On  which Mr. Grainger shrugged his shoulders, and expressed his opinion that as  Cyril was such an obstinate fool he deserved to lose his money.</p>
  <p>Even  the rain and a nasty drizzle that had set in from early morning did not affect  Cyril's composure. He would have preferred a fine day, but merely because it  was unpleasant to stand about all day in the wet. He did not think that the  rain would affect Chester's chance of scoring a victory, and it was from that  point of view that he considered everything that day.</p>
  <p>But  if Cyril did not mind the rain there were plenty of people who did, and loud  were the complaints and lamentations of the ladies in the densely-packed stand.  Their hopes had been riveted on that day for months. Dress had occupied their  minds every hour of the day&mdash;and perchance some of the night&mdash;for weeks and weeks  past. Costumes, so it was reported, had arrived from Paris on which Worth and  Rodriguez had lavished all the resources of their art, and the curiosity of  those who had to be content with the productions of the local <i>modistes</i> was strung to concert-pitch.  But there were those who took a malicious delight in the discomfiture of their  friends, and of this class Mrs. Dale was a prominent representative.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  is really most unfortunate that poor Mrs. Churcher won't be able to show off  her new Parisian dress,&quot; she said to Mrs. Drisbergh, with a little laugh,  as she thought of her own last season dress which was hidden under her  waterproof, &quot;They say that it cost &pound;100, and that the <i>passementerie</i> on it is alone worth half the money. I really think  it most absurd for a woman of her age and appearance to spend so much money on  dress.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr.  Champlin evidently doesn't think so,&quot; said Mrs. Drisbergh, as she cast a  significant glance towards the Governor's box, from which Mr. Champlin was  speaking to Mrs. Churcher, who was seated immediately behind it, &quot;and I  suppose that he is the chief person to be considered.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And  a monstrous thing it is that it should be so,&quot; cried Mrs. Dale in a sudden  paroxysm of virtuous indignation. &quot;I really think that society ought to  put its foot down, and stop that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  faintest trace of a smile curled old Mrs. Drisbergh's thin lip. She remembered  that some years before Mrs. Dale's name had been on everyone's tongue, and that  very hard things indeed had been said about her.</p>
  <p>&quot;Perhaps  you are right,&quot; she allowed in a cautious tone, &quot;but who will be the  first to take the matter up? Ah! There are Mr. and Mrs. Barron, and Mr.  Dyke,&quot; she exclaimed, as she caught sight of the Heimweh party, &quot;but I  don't see Gertrude.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Gertrude  isn't well. I saw her yesterday, and she told me that she wasn't coming. Do you  know I begin to think that she is repenting her bargain. And it is a terrible  thing that a young and pretty girl like her should sell herself to such a boor  as Adam Dyke.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Drisbergh gave a dry cough. She was fully aware how industriously the speaker  had angled for Adam Dyke on behalf of one of her own daughters, and she could  not resist a sly thrust.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  fancy there are plenty of girls who would not mind being in her shoes,&quot;  she said quietly, &quot;and plenty of mothers who would give their ears to have  him for a son-in-law.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I'm not one of them,&quot; interjected Mrs. Dale, with unnecessary warmth.</p>
  <p>&quot;Quite  so. But you must admit that there are some,&quot; persisted Mrs. Drisbergh.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I won't discuss the matter,&quot; said Mrs. Dale, who did not look in the best  of tempers. &quot;I can only say that <i>I</i> wouldn't have him for a son-in-law if he went down on his knees to me this  minute. Just look at him! Now, I ask you, my dear Mrs. Drisbergh, if a sensible  woman is likely to run after a man who looks so utterly ridiculous as Mr. Dyke  does to-day?&quot;</p>
  <p>Certainly,  Adam did not show to advantage. He was standing on the asphalte path in front  of the stand, talking to Mr. Grainger. He wore a white hat, and light gloves,  which emphasised the size of his enormous hands. He had a light frock coat,  which set in a series of creases on the back, and his great feet were encased  in patent leather boots. In his ordinary clothes the clumsiness of his figure  escaped notice; but now everything seemed to draw attention to it, just as the  tawdry jewellery of the Sunday-out servant girl advertises her vulgarity. Mrs.  Drisbergh put up her glass, and took in all these details.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  a man is to be judged by his clothes,&quot; she said, quietly, &quot;I must  admit that Mr. Dyke is not a desirable acquaintance. But I must confess that I  really like his face. Though his features are not particularly good, there's an  expression in his face which is really quite&mdash;quite winning; and you must admit  that his eyes are good. Such blue, frank, honest eyes I've rarely seen.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And  what about those awful, ill bred hands,&quot; snapped out Mrs. Dale, who was  working herself into a frenzy of indignation with the poor unoffending  squatter, &quot;and his round shoulders, and his great feet? I really think  that one of the reasons the Barrons have secured him is that it will give  people an opportunity of comparing the couple to Beauty and the Beast.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale's adverse opinion of him did not prevent that lady being most attentive to  him when shortly afterwards they met at lunch.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  a charming man Mr. Dyke is,&quot; she whispered to Mrs. Barron, in such a  manner that every word came distinctly to Adam's tingling ears: &quot;so  attentive, so good-natured, and so full of information. Oh, thank you!&quot;  she exclaimed, as she looked up into Adam's blushing face with a gracious  smile, when he brought her a plateful of boned turkey, &quot;I really don't  know what I should do without you.&quot; Nor did her equanimity entirely desert  her when a few minutes afterwards Adam upset a large spoonful of trifle over  her dress.</p>
  <p>The  appearance of the weather when they went to lunch had been favourable, and  though threatening clouds were still to be seen to the south, the rain had  ceased. The lull, however, was of short duration, and the hopes of the  holiday-seekers, which had risen high at the prospect of fine weather, now fell  as rapidly again. Lunch was hardly over, when a heavy downpour set in, and for  the rest of the day umbrellas and mackintoshes were the order of the day. Every  now and then, when there seemed a prospect of the rain ceasing, a few  adventurous ladies bravely essayed a promenade on the asphalte, but they were  never able to stop there long. Even the sweepstakers, if I may be permitted to  coin a word, found it advisable to seek the refuge of the stand. It was only  those who bet who faced the rain.</p>
  <p>Of  these, of course, Cyril Paton was one. He didn't want to bet, for he had  registered a vow, which for once he kept, that he wouldn't &quot;touch&quot;  anything until the great event was decided. But a certain nervous impatience  kept him in the vicinity of the ring, and he would have undergone a martyrdom  of anxiety had he been compelled to await the solution of his position in the  stand. So there he was in the saddling-paddock, ankle-deep in mud and wet to  the skin, but indifferent alike to mud or rain. He had not bet on the first  races, though as a rule he bet on every event. His hopes were concentrated on  the one race, and on that he was prepared to hazard all.</p>
  <p>He  was standing at the scratching-board, comparing the scratchings with his book  for the hundredth time, when Adam Dyke caught him by the arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  been looking everywhere for you,&quot; said Adam heartily. &quot;I should like  to be with you when the race is run, old man. As you know, I heartily wish you  luck.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  mumbled something about being awfully obliged, and pulled his hat over his  eyes. He couldn't help wishing, however, that Adam had not preferred his  request.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  don't mind me being with you, I hope,&quot; said Adam, who, dull as he was, had  an idea that his proposition was not entirely welcome.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  in the least,&quot; Cyril hastened to exclaim.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  let us go and have a look at the big gun,&quot; said Adam, and, passing his arm  through Cyril's, he led him off to the corner where Chester was undergoing his  preparation.</p>
  <p>There  was a great crowd round him, but at last they got inside the ring, and had a  really good look at the horse on whose performance so much rested.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  do you think of him?&quot; asked Cyril, as they walked towards the judge's box,  while the horses were leaving the paddock to take their preliminary canters.</p>
  <p>&quot;Think  of him?&quot; answered Adam, as he tried to throw as much confidence into his  tone as he could. &quot;Think of him? Why, I think he'll win; and, by  Heaven,&quot; he added, earnestly, &quot;I only hope he may&mdash;for your sake.&quot;</p>
  <p>They  had selected a spot immediately behind the judge's box to see the race from,  and there they stood without speaking whilst the horses took their preliminary  canters. It was only when the horses were at the post that Cyril gave any signs  of impatience.</p>
  <p>&quot;Take  my glasses,&quot; he said, in a hoarse whisper, to Adam, as he thrust them into his  hands, &quot;and tell me when they're off.&quot;</p>
  <p>Scarcely  had Adam time to put up the glasses when a hoarse roar, taken up by fifty  thousand throats, proclaimed that the horses had started.</p>
  <p>&quot;They're  off!&quot; roared the hill. &quot;They're off!&quot; roared the flat. &quot;They're  off!&quot; roared the stand. It was which should roar the loudest.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  are those left at the post?&quot; asked Cyril, as he stood on tip-toe and  anxiously endeavoured to make out the colours of the riders.</p>
  <p>&quot;Robinson  Crusoe and Amendment,&quot; answered Adam, who, though he didn't bet, knew  every horse in the race. &quot;Chester's right enough. He's in a very good  position.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank  God!&quot; muttered Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;Savanaka  and Filibuster are in the lead,&quot; continued Adam, &quot;then come Peerless  and The Diver&mdash;at least I think it's The Diver. Chester is pulling Piggott out  of the saddle.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And  so is Sava pulling double,&quot; said a bookmaker standing near, &quot;and take  my word they've got to travel before they get to him. A hundred he beats  anything in it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Done!&quot;  cried Cyril. &quot;I'll back Chester.&quot;'</p>
  <p>&quot;It's a bet!&quot; cried the bookmaker.</p>
  <p>Adam  lowered his glasses and turned hastily to Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;For  Heaven's sake,&quot; he implored, &quot;don't bet any more; you have quite enough  on.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  paid but little attention to the request. His eyes were riveted on the horses.  He seized the glasses from Adam, and endeavoured to make out Chester's  position. But his excitement was such that he couldn't bring the glasses to his  focus.</p>
  <p>&quot;Take  them,&quot; he said, as he handed them back to Adam, &quot;Where is he now? and  where is Savanaka?&quot;</p>
  <p>As  they passed the stand Savanaka was fourth, and his rider, a mere child, seemed  to have all his work to hold him. Chester was lying about eighth, and, as Adam  put it, going as strong as a lion. Along the river Savanaka was third, and  Chester had not improved his position. At the bridge, however, he seemed to be  creeping up, and when Adam announced the fact a bright flush of excitement lit  up Cyril's pale face, but every trace of colour left it a moment afterwards.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&quot;Great Heaven,&quot; cried Adam, &quot;there's  something down!&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  turned livid. He tried to ask what horse it was, but his tongue clave to his  palate.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  Waxy, I think,&quot; exclaimed the bookmaker who had backed the little grey  against Chester. &quot;He nearly brought Sava down,&quot; he added, with a  terrible oath.</p>
  <p>But  now as they come to the turn for home the battle begins in earnest, and the ear  of the stand waits for the hill to proclaim the winner, a moment more, and a  name is yelled that makes every drop of blood in Cyril's veins tingle. &quot;Chester!  Chester!&quot; roars the hill, and 50,000 necks are craned forward to see the tussle  up the straight. Sure enough Chester enters the straight in the lead, Tom Kirk  and The Vagabond being close up.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  all over, old man,&quot; says Adam, trying to master his emotion. &quot;They'll  never catch Chester.&quot;</p>
  <p>Never  catch Chester! The words are hardly out of his mouth when another name is on  everyone's lips&mdash;&quot;Savanaka! Savanaka!&quot; and as the name is pronounced  the little grey cuts down Tom Kirk and The Vagabond as if they are standing  still, and lessens the distance between himself and Chester at every stride.</p>
  <p>There  was no need now to post Cyril as to the position of the horses. As he saw  Savanaka drawing up to Chester, he ran down to the fence, and then, impelled by  some spasmodic influence, he rushed along towards the judge's box, &quot;riding  Chester every yard,&quot; as a horsey eye-witness afterwards described.</p>
  <p>&quot;Go  on, Paddy! Go on!&quot; he yelled, frantically, to the jockey, as if the lad  could hear him.</p>
  <p>There  was a babel of tongues, and both horses were proclaimed the winner, for  opinions differed (and, maybe, differ to this day) as to whether the little  grey had quite &quot;got up&quot; or not. There were those who thought it must  he a dead heat, and of these Adam was one. But the issue was not long in doubt;  and, as Chester's number went up, Adam seized Cyril's hand and congratulated  him.</p>
  <p>&quot;I <i>am</i> glad!&quot; he said; and his  emotion amply testified the honesty of his good wishes. &quot;I would sooner  have lost ten thousand pounds than that he shouldn't have won.&quot;</p>
  <p>There  is no man so bad but that in his innermost being there is some remnant of  conscience; and even Cyril, lost as he was to all sense of honour, felt a pang  of shame, as he felt the grip of Adam's honest hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thanks,&quot;  he said; but he did not meet Adam's eye as he spoke. &quot;It is very good of  you to say so. But for you I shouldn't have been in a position to land such a  stake.&quot;</p>
  <p>Two  minutes afterwards, Cyril went to the telegraph-office, and sent the news to  Gertrude.</p>
  <p>&quot;Chester  won,&quot; so ran the telegram. &quot;Be at the old place at eleven sharp to-morrow.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he turned from the office, he came across Adam Dyke once more.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  just sent Gertrude Barron a telegram,&quot; said the latter, forgetting for the  moment the old relations which had existed between his betrothed and Cyril.  &quot;She asked me to do so, and I am sure that she will be so glad to hear  you've won.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk9"></a>Chapter  IX. <br>
    OLIVER MAKES A STRONG RESOLUTION.</h2>
  <p>Gertrude's  state of health gave her mother no little anxiety, but it was more because it  was awkward that she should be indisposed at that precise time than for any  other reason.</p>
  <p>&quot;Really  it's most provoking,&quot; she said to her husband when they were discussing the  matter. &quot;There's such a lot to be done, and so little time to do it in. I  feel quite worn out, what with shopping, dressmaking, and preparations for the  ball, and what not. I really think that Gertrude might make an effort.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron looked up from his paper at his wife, and half closed his eyes as he did  so, a sure sign that he was considering something with unusual care.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  you think, Bessie, that the prospect of her marriage is at the bottom of it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Prospect  of her marriage! How so?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I may be wrong,&quot; said Mr. Barron in a tone which implied that he was  satisfied that he was right; &quot;but I am of opinion that she was really in  love with Cyril Paton, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;That  fellow!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Barron, with a look and gesture that spoke  volumes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Fellow  or not,&quot; resumed Mr. Barron, &quot;I am of that opinion. I think that we  underrated her affection for him all through, and that but for my sister's  illness you might have had no little trouble to keep Gertrude from breaking off  her engagement.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I disagree with you,&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Barron shortly, &quot;and you will  admit that a woman is the best judge of a woman's motives. Gertrude meant to  marry the man from the first. She would never have accepted him unless she  meant to carry it through.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;Have  your way, my dear,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I shall say no more,&quot; and  then he directly belied that resolution by declaring, with no little warmth,  that he would be heartily glad when it was all over.</p>
  <p>This  conversation took place on the Saturday night after the Cup, and though Mrs.  Barron expressed her confidence in her own opinion, her husband's misgivings  set her a-thinking, and she ended by having misgivings of her own.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  If it is so, it's a pity,&quot; she reflected. &quot;I have no patience with  such nonsense. I always took Gertrude to be a sensible girl. If she is going in  for sentiment, and that sort of thing, she is laying up for herself a nice  store of trouble in the time to come.&quot;</p>
  <p>All  Sunday and Monday Mrs. Barron carefully watched the girl, and the more she  watched the more she was won over to her husband's opinion,</p>
  <p>&quot;What  a mercy,&quot; she reflected with, with a sigh of gratitude, &quot;that that  young scapegrace didn't win his money before. Six months earlier, and it might  have upset the whole thing.&quot;</p>
  <p>Before  bed-time that night Gertrude furnished her with still further food for  reflection. Mrs. Barron had occasion to consult her about some matters  connected with the wedding, and hearing that she had gone to bed, went to her  room. To her surprise, and to her infinite disgust, she found her in tears.</p>
  <p>&quot;Gertrude,  how do you think it would do to&mdash;. Why, what on earth is the matter?&quot; she  broke off, as Gertrude buried her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  has happened?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl did not answer, and sobbed bitterly. &quot;Come, come,&quot; said her  mother, not unkindly, as she stood by the girl and gently smoothed her hair; &quot;don't  be silly, Gertrude. If anything has gone wrong say what it is, and we'll see  what can be done.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Gertrude still remained silent, Mrs. Barron drew up a chair by hers, and,  sitting down, passed her arms round the girl's waist. Gertrude's head fell on  her mother's breast.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  afraid, my dear,&quot; whispered the latter, in as kindly a tone as she could command,  &quot;that all this fuss and bother has upset you. I don't wonder at it, for I  myself feel quite exhausted. I shall be heartily glad when it's over.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl fell on her knees, and buried her face in her mother's lap.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  I'm so unhappy,&quot; she cried, and her voice attested the truth of her words.  &quot;I think my heart will break.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  nonsense, nonsense!&quot; exclaimed her mother, trying to master her  impatience. &quot;What have you got to make you unhappy?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl lifted her head, and looked into her mother's face. There were tears in her  red-rimmed eyes, and her lip trembled as she spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;Everything,  mother, everything.&quot; she cried. &quot;Oh! can't this marriage be put off?  &mdash;put off? broken off. Can't I go away somewhere, anywhere.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Barron pushed her chair back with a gesture of angry impatience.</p>
  <p>&quot;Are  you mad, Gertrude?&quot; she asked. &quot;What has come over you?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl bit her lip, and the tears flowed faster than ever.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  be angry with me, mother;&quot; she said in a pleading voice. &quot;I've tried  hard to keep up, but I&mdash;I couldn't do it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Stuff  o' nonsense!&quot; interrupted Mrs. Barron, as she rose to her feet and prepared  to leave the room. &quot;I have no patience with you. Here you are engaged to the  very best match in Australia, to a man that worships the ground you tread on,  to a man who is universally liked and esteemed, to a man that&mdash;that will let you  have your own way in everything, and then, forsooth, you must indulge in  hysterical emotion that would better become a servant girl. I have no patience  with you.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl rose to her feet, and dashed the tears from her eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mad  or not mad, mother,&quot; she cried, &quot;I tell you this, that if you don't do  your best to break off the match, and to-morrow too, it will be you, and not I,  badly as I shall feel it, that will feel it most.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Barron raised her eyebrows and smiled.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  dear girl, you are raving,&quot; she said as coolly as she could. &quot;I hope  we shall hear no more of this nonsense. Good night.&quot;</p>
  <p>She  had no sooner left the room than Gertrude fell on her knees at the bedside.</p>
  <p>&quot;May  God forgive me!&quot; she cried, and sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>
  <p>Though  Mrs. Barron had done her best to retain her composure whilst she was in the  room, she was too much disturbed to keep up appearances when she got outside.  Mr. Barron indulged in a cigar and spirits and water in the study before he  went to bed, and to him his wife rushed off at a speed which she had not  displayed for many years. She slammed the door behind her&mdash;a sure sign that she  was out of temper.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  what the deuce is up now?&quot; asked Mr. Barron, as he sat up in his easy-chair  with so much precipitation that he distributed the cigar-ash all over his  waistcoat.</p>
  <p>In  a few hasty words Mrs. Barron explained the position.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  Just as I said,&quot; her husband exclaimed, as he threw himself back in the  chair with a conscious air of prophecy. &quot;What did I tell you?&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Barron made an impatient gesture.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  it's no use arguing who was right and who was wrong,&quot; she said. &quot;What  we have to consider now is what is to be done.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Great  Heaven!&quot; cried Mr. Barron; &quot;you don't think it will fall  through.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I won't be sure,&quot; replied his wife, shrugging her shoulders. &quot;When a  girl, and especially a girl like Gertrude, gets such ideas into her head one  can never tell what they will lead her to.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  it does,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm a ruined man.&quot;</p>
  <p>For  a minute neither spoke. Mr. Barron sat picking at his fingers, Mrs. Barron  pursed her lips.</p>
  <p>&quot;When  is your appointment with this man?&quot; she asked at length.</p>
  <p>''To-morrow  at 12.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  At all risks she must be prevented from seeing him till then. Once the  interview is over we must take our chance. Gertrude spoke of the necessity of  breaking it off to-morrow. If it is broken off, David,&quot; she said, as she  leant forward and threw him a significant glance, &quot;it must be in the  afternoon.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You  are right, Bessie,&quot; he assented with a nod of approval. &quot;I'll leave  it to you to see that lunatic doesn't do any mischief till our business is  settled.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Adam Dyke walked down Collins-street the next morning he was in the highest  spirits. It is true that Gertrude's state of health had lately caused him no  small concern, but he was so strong himself and so little used to the duration  of any ailment that he had lent a ready ear to Mrs. Barron's assurances that  Gertrude's indisposition was merely a temporary one. His head was full of  schemes for making her happy, and the very thought that the next day would make  her his, wholly his, made his heart beat like a boy's. &quot;I hope she will be  happy,&quot; he kept saying to himself, and an inner voice assured him that she  would.</p>
  <p>On  the way he stepped into a jeweller's shop to see if his present, a magnificent  suite of diamonds, was ready. The jeweller handed him the case, and as Adam  looked at the beautiful gems, he thought of her whom they would adorn, and a  blush of pleasure lit up his kindly face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Are  you pleased with them, sir?&quot; asked the shopman, and then he added, knowing  their destination, &quot;I am sure that Miss Barron will be.&quot;</p>
  <p>Though  Adam had been congratulated hundreds of times he had not yet got over a certain  feeling of constraint whenever his name was coupled with Gertrude's.</p>
  <p>&quot;Y-yes!  I&mdash;I hope she will,&quot; he stammered, as he shut the lid of the case, and held  it out to the man.</p>
  <p>Whether  the man was not looking, or Adam did not place it in his hands, I cannot say,  but the jewels fell with a crash to the floor.</p>
  <p>There  was a common-looking but rich Irishman in the shop at the time. He knew Adam  well, and had been watching him inspecting the jewels with an amused eye.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's  a bad omen,&quot; he exclaimed, with a good-natured laugh, as he picked up the  jewels.</p>
  <p>Adam  was superstitious, as men of his stamp not infrequently are. He hastened to ask  the speaker if he really meant what he said. The Irishman, of course, protested  that he meant nothing by it. In spite of his protestations, however, Adam's  spirits fell. He had a presentiment of evil, and though by the time he reached  Mr. Barron's office he had somewhat recovered, he was not quite himself again.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron heard him announced with a sigh of relief, which was enlarged into one  of satisfaction when Adam told him that he had not seen Gertrude that day.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  Gertrude hasn't been herself the last few days,&quot; Mr. Barron said with no  little feeling. &quot;The fuss and the worry of the preparations have quite  knocked her up. She must take things very quietly for a few months, but that,&quot;  he added with a smile, &quot;you'll see after, Adam, won't you?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  protested, with what warmth I need not say, that Gertrude should not be allowed  to do anything until she was quite herself, and then for a few minutes a  general conversation ensued. But Mr. Barron was too anxious to get his business  completed to waste much time, and within ten minutes of Adam's arrival had  introduced the subject which to him was the all-important one.</p>
  <p>They  had just begun going into figures when the door opened and young Oliver Barron  came into the room. His father could not restrain a movement of impatience.</p>
  <p>&quot;How's  this?&quot; he exclaimed sharply. &quot;I gave express orders that we were not  to be interrupted.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  afraid it's my fault,&quot; said Oliver, who was shaking hands with Adam.  &quot;The fact is I have a letter for each of you&mdash;one for you from the  Mum,&quot; he added, as he handed one to his father, &quot;and for you from  Gertrude. She gave it me last night.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Oliver gave Adam the letter his father turned livid. For a moment an insane  idea possessed him of seizing the letter from Adam's hand and tearing it up.</p>
  <p>&quot;Damnation!&quot;  he cried, and as he did so he brought down his hand on the desk with such force  that the ink danced out of the ink-bottle.</p>
  <p>But  David Barron had been too long used to exercising self-restraint for a paroxysm  of this sort to be of long duration. Had nothing else brought him to himself  the plainly-written surprise on Adam's face would have done so.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  beg ten thousand thousand pardons,&quot; he said. &quot;I&mdash;I was&mdash;was seized,&quot;  he here placed his hand to his side, &quot;by a sharp spasm&mdash;liver, you know,  liver.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You  ought to see to that,&quot; said Adam, who looked somewhat concerned. &quot;Excuse  me,&quot; he added, as he proceeded to open Gertrude's letter. &quot;I wonder  what Gertrude says.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Adam opened the envelope and unfolded the letter Mr. Barron's eyes were riveted  on his face. He never attempted to open the letter that he himself held in his  hand. He felt that everything depended on that which Adam had received, and as  he thought of what it might contain his face blenched with apprehension.</p>
  <p>Adam  had hardly read a line when his head fell on his hands, and he uttered a groan  that drove all the blood in Mr. Barron's body to his mean, calculating heart.  The wretched man would have fallen had not Oliver luckily been at hand to  support him.</p>
  <p>&quot;May  God have mercy on me!&quot; he sobbed.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron jumped up from his chair, and thrusting Oliver on one side, caught Adam by  the arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  is it, man?&quot; he cried, absolutely shaking him in his impatience. &quot;What is  it?&quot;</p>
  <p>For  answer Adam held out the letter to him. He snatched it from Adam's hand with  such force that he almost tore it, and read it, muttering the words as he read,  with avidity. And as he read his face from white turned an ashen hue, that made  him resemble the dead more than the living.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wish that she had died,&quot; he cried, as he struck the letter with the back  of his hand, &quot;before she had written that.''</p>
  <p>Oliver  had witnessed the scene in open-mouthed amazement. Adam's grief and his  father's rage were alike incomprehensible to him.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  has happened?&quot; he at last ventured to ask.</p>
  <p>His  father thrust the letter into his hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Read  that,&quot; he exclaimed, and then sitting down at his desk he let his head  fall on his hands. &quot;I'm a ruined man!&quot; he sobbed. &quot;A ruined man.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  took the letter, and this is what he read:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="right" class="letter">Heimweh.</p>
  <p class="letter">&quot;When  you receive this I shall be where your just reproaches cannot reach me. I have  long wished to tell you the truth, but the shame of confessing how cruelly I have  wronged you has prevented me from speaking. Believe me, when I promised to be  your wife I meant not only to keep that promise, but to do my best to make your  married life a happy one. Alas! I didn't know how weak I was. I had loved another,  and we had quarrelled. I thought that I could forget. I thought that I was  forgotten. Even when he came back and claimed me I tried to be honest to you,  and for a time held out.</p>
  <p class="letter">&quot;Don't  grieve over me. Pity me, and try to forgive me. Go far away, and cast me from  your thoughts as if I had never been. &nbsp;&quot;Gertrude&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Oliver read his face grew red and white by turns&mdash;red with shame, white with  anger. For a moment he stood looking at the paper as if he had hardly mastered  its contents; then, with a movement full of sympathetic kindliness, he placed  his hand on Adam's shoulder.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  old chap!&quot; he said. &quot;Poor old chap!&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-9-b.png" width="720" height="575"></p>
  <p>At  this moment Mr. Barron, whose head was still buried in his hands, again  bewailed his fate, whining that &quot;he didn't really know what he had ever  done to deserve such a blow.&quot;</p>
  <p>An  angry look, and yet a look of shame, came into Oliver's honest eyes. It made  his blood boil to hear his father selfishly bewailing his fate, when Adam Dyke,  struck down by such a terrible blow, did not complain.</p>
  <p>&quot;Stop,  father!&quot; he cried, stamping his foot impatiently. &quot;What we suffer is  nothing to what poor Adam must feel. Oh! if I had only suspected,&quot; he  added bitterly, &quot;this might have been prevented.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  rose from his seat, and gave Oliver his hand. His face seemed suddenly to have  grown old, and when he spoke his voice had none of the old, cheerful ring in  it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thanks,  Oliver,&quot; he said, in a low sad voice. &quot;Thanks! But knowing what I do  now I would not have had it otherwise. God forgive me,&quot; he said, as he  pressed a hand to his eyes, &quot;I thought she was learning to love me. If she  couldn't love me&mdash;if she loved anyone else&mdash;she would only have been unhappy. Oh!  if she had only broken the news gently to me,&quot; he cried, as tears came  into his eyes, &quot;I think I could have stood it better.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  sight of his tears brought afresh a blush of shame to Oliver's cheek.</p>
  <p>&quot;Listen  to me, Adam,&quot; he cried, as he clenched his fist, and shook it in the air.  &quot;If I have ever a chance of running that infernal scoundrel to earth, I'll  do it, if I ruin myself in the attempt. As to Gertrude, I'd sooner&mdash;sooner die  than speak to her.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  drew back horror-stricken.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver!  Oliver!&quot; he cried. &quot;Withdraw your words. Remember she's your sister.  Remember that she probably never loved me, and dearly loves this man. Think of  what&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was a cry from Mr. Barron, and both Oliver and Adam turned to him. He had  opened Mrs. Barron's letter, and was now staring at it with a glassy eye.  Suddenly he burst into a peal of unnatural laughter, and then, with a groan,  fell on the floor in a fit.</p>
  <p>They  lifted him on to the sofa, and a doctor was sent for. But before the latter  could arrive Mr. Barron regained consciousness. For a moment he looked about  him, hardly knowing where he was, and not remembering what had happened. Then  all came back to him, and he closed his eyes with a groan.</p>
  <p>&quot;Is  it true, Oliver?&quot; he asked in a faint whisper.</p>
  <p>&quot;Never  mind just now,&quot; whispered the boy, as he leant over him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Read  me the letter&mdash;read it, read it, read it!&quot; cried his father impatiently.</p>
  <p>Oliver  again tried to soothe him, but finding that his efforts only served to excite  him, he went to the desk, where the letter still lay, and picked it up. When he  caught sight of its contents he started.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  could she have done it!&quot; he cried, and he cast a glance full of pity not  at his father, but at Adam Dyke.</p>
  <p>The  latter sat with his head bowed into his breast. At Oliver's exclamation he  looked up.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  is it, Oliver?&quot; he asked.</p>
  <p>The  boy went to his side and put his arm round his neck as he leaned down and  whispered to him.</p>
  <p>&quot;She  is married, Adam,&quot; he said, &quot;and left our house during the night to  join her husband.&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was a wail from the sofa, and turning to Mr. Barron they found him wringing his  hands.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  a ruined man!&quot; he cried. &quot;A ruined man!&quot;</p>

  <h1 align="center"><b>Part II. 1881 - 1883 </b></h1>
  <h2><a name="sk10"></a>Chapter  X.<br>
    HUSBAND AND WIFE.</h2>
  <p>Elopements  are as a rule only a matter of wonder and gossip for the proverbial nine days.  The couple come back from their impromptu honeymoon, and, after a little  fencing, a reconciliation takes place, and every one falls on every one else's  neck. But there were manifold reasons which served to keep the case of Cyril  and Gertrude alive in the scandal-world, and it is safe to say that the  interest in their marriage was fully as keen in 1881 as it was on that memorable  day four years before when the news first startled the Melbourne public. To  begin with, there was an element of uncertainty about their pecuniary position,  and that alone is always sufficient to create gossip. Every one knew that Cyril  had won largely over Chester's Cup, but even admitting that he had won &pound;25,000,  and that was the largest sum with which he was credited, his expenditure was a  matter for speculation. The house and grounds that he had bought at Toorak must  have cost &pound;7,000&mdash;he lived at the rate of six or seven thousand a year&mdash;he had  five or six race horses, and Heaven knows what expenses besides. &quot;How on  earth,&quot; asked people, and the question was a natural one, &quot;is it  managed?&quot; and the more they tried to solve the difficulty the greater the  difficulty seemed.</p>
  <p>But  it was not only the Patons' pecuniary position which furnished the gossips food  for comment. Though they had at first lived happily enough, it was now an open  secret that Gertrude and her husband did not get on at all well together. The  fact is that Cyril was not cut out for a domestic life. To do him justice, he  did his best &quot;to cut his old connection,&quot; and for a while succeeded.  But home-life was too tame for him, and little by little he gave way to his old  courses. It is just possible that if Gertrude had been a woman of a different  character she might have &quot;kept him straight,&quot; to use a pet phrase of  his own, but the course she adopted was the very one to drive him away from his  home. When he first began to gamble and bet again she showed temper, and Cyril  had too strong a temper of his own to stand temper in others. Her temper gave  way to tears, and I need not say that tears only exaggerated his impatience of  domestic life. Then a not unnatural result followed. Finding her requests  ignored, her recriminations laughed at and her grief derided, Gertrude became  indifferent, dried her tears, and sought an antidote elsewhere. She was young,  pretty, fond of society, and fonder still of admiration. In the whirl of the  world of fashion she soon ceased to care for her husband's absence. He was  welcome to stay away, to bet and gamble to his heart's content. Her last tears  on his account had been shed,</p>
  <p>A  woman thus situated is likely to meet with but scant justice from society, and  Gertrude was not spared. Mothers who had daughters &quot;on the shelf&quot; did  not forget that she had robbed them of their chance of hooking Adam Dyke, and  the fact that she had discarded him in favour of a poorer man only served to  add fuel to the flame. Ladies who had ceased to be attractive themselves viewed  with envious eyes her manifold conquests, and the less danger there was of  their own virtue being put to the test the more they inveighed against her  supposed lapses. It was in vain that some of the more good-natured endeavoured  to take her part, pleading the neglect of her husband, her youth, and her  beauty. The Melbourne woman-world shrugged its scantily-covered shoulders, and  declared, almost with one breath, that Gertrude Paton's conduct was scandalous.  They might have saved themselves the trouble. Gertrude was fully aware of the  hostility which she had aroused, and instead of annoying her it gave her no  small satisfaction. So long as she had enough money to spend (and Cyril had  hitherto been excessively liberal), and had a fair share of admirers, she was  content to laugh at the spite of her critics. She had never sought the good  opinion of the world, and, in truth, would not have valued it if she had possessed  it. So it came about that the more people talked the more cause she gave them  for talking. Like Ishmael of old, she felt that every one's hand was against  her, and every fresh attack spurred her on to fresh excesses.</p>
  <p>That  she might have been very different had she been differently situated there can  be little doubt. Cyril's neglect she felt but little, and had he been the most  attentive of husbands it is possible that the result might have been the same.  But there were those whose neglect she felt most keenly, for all that she  assumed a thorough indifference. Oliver had kept his word. He never spoke to  her after her marriage. She made advances, and advances which cost her much to  make, but he turned a deaf ear to them. By her conduct to Adam Dyke he had  judged her, and from the moment that she had played him false she had ceased to  be his sister. It was Oliver's loss that she felt most, for it was Oliver's  influence that could have done the most to save her from ruin. But her mother's  indifference she also felt, though in a less degree. Mrs. Barron had set her heart  on Gertrude marrying Adam Dyke, and she never forgave her the disappointment  she had caused her. She called at the Patons, was on visiting terms with them,  to use the jargon of the world, and occasionally asked them to Heimweh, but the  old intimacy had for ever ceased. There was one other person with whom Gertrude  would willingly have been reconciled, and that was Adam Dyke. She felt, and  keenly felt, how badly she had used him. She recognised, when it was too late,  what a terrible mistake she had made. She had learned to respect his character,  and an inner voice told her, whenever she thought of him, that his honest love  might have taught her to be a far different woman. But these thoughts only  troubled her now and then, and at very distant intervals. As a rule she thought  only of the present, took life as it was, and made the most of her  opportunities.</p>
  <p>On  her return from a party one evening in the month of July, 1881, Gertrude was  surprised to see a light in the breakfast-room window, and going in found Cyril  smoking a cigar in front of the fire.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  You've come at last,&quot; he said rather testily, as he looked at his watch.  &quot;Where have you been? It's half-past 2.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  took off a wrap that she had worn on her head, and sat down before she replied.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  If you had been with me as you ought to have been,&quot; she answered in a tone  which plainly foretold an intention to show fight, &quot;there would be no  necessity to answer the question.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril's  brow contracted.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  asked you where you've been,&quot; he exclaimed angrily, &quot;and I presume  that I'm entitled to an answer.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;As  you will!&quot; she said with a little laugh, that brought an angry flush to  Cyril's cheek. &quot;I've been to the Churchers;&quot; and then she added in a  bantering tone, as she gave a yawn and leant back wearily in the armchair,  &quot;Is there anything else you wish to know?&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril's  face was at no time a good-tempered one, but now such a lurid light of rage lit  up his eyes that even Gertrude, used as she was to his tempers, noted it with  surprise.</p>
  <p>&quot;Look  here, Gertrude!&quot; he cried, &quot;whenever I ask a question, be it what it  may, I expect it to be answered, and civilly too.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot;  she interjected.</p>
  <p>Cyril  jumped to his feet with an oath.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  don't suppose that I stop up till this time of night without an object,&quot;  he began.</p>
  <p>&quot;Considering  that you are out till all hours every night of your life!&quot; interjected  Gertrude with undisguised contempt.</p>
  <p>Cyril  clenched his fist, and struck the table with such force that some flowers fell  out of a <i>jardini&eacute;re</i> which stood in  the centre.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you want to drive me mad?&quot; he cried. &quot;Will you listen to me or not?&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  drew herself up, and met his angry look with a firmness that there was no  mistaking.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you have come here to bully me I will not listen to you,&quot; she said. &quot;Your  treatment of me has not disposed me to put up with just anything you like to do  or say. If it is anything that concerns me personally&mdash;personally, you  understand&mdash;or concerns us as man and wife, I will listen to you, but for goodness  sake be quick, I'm tired out and want to go to bed.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  laughed, but it was an unpleasant laugh to hear.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  very good of you to condescend so far,&quot; he said with a sneer. &quot;Perhaps  when you've heard what I've got to say you won't be so anxious to go to  bed.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  what is it?&quot; interjected Gertrude impatiently.</p>
  <p>&quot;For  the last year or two we haven't seen very much of each other&mdash;now! don't  interrupt me,&quot; he said, as Gertrude made a gesture of impatience&mdash;  &quot;and when we have our conversation has been of a very limited nature. I  haven't cared to discuss my affairs with you, and you, for very good reasons I  fancy, haven't cared to confide in me. A necessity has arisen for making an  alteration and I am going to make the first step by imparting a piece of information,  which may or may not take you by surprise.&quot; Cyril paused, and a look of  perfectly demoniacal satisfaction came into his mean eyes. &quot;I am utterly,  irretrievably ruined. I may be sold up any moment. The house we live in is  mortgaged to the last farthing. There's a bill of sale over the furniture. In  fact, I haven't a shilling in the world.&quot;</p>
  <p>Though  Gertrude tried to maintain her composure, all the colour fled from her face.  She had never inquired into her husband's affairs&mdash;indeed, as long as money was  found for her expenses she preferred to remain ignorant of the source whence it  was drawn. But she had never contemplated such a blow, and the suddenness of  the disclosure took her breath away. Cyril saw her emotion, and was not  generous enough to spare her.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  that touches you,&quot; he sneered triumphantly. &quot;Money and money alone  can speak to a woman like you. It was Adam Dyke's money at first&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  rose to her feet, and as she faced him she looked a very queen.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  coward!&quot; she cried, as she clenched her hands. &quot;How dare you mention  that man's name ?&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-9-a.png" width="428" height="600"></p>
  <p>&quot;It's  true!&quot; persisted Cyril, but in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  lie!&quot; she returned furiously. &quot;I would have married Adam Dyke because  I had quarrelled with you, and would to Heaven that I had done so.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Would  to Heaven you had!&quot; assented Cyril.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  caught up her wrap, and with an indescribable look of disdain turned on her  heel. Cyril caught her by the arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;Stay.  Gertrude!&quot; he said. &quot;I want a talk with you. It's no good abusing  each other. Let us see if something can't be done.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  resumed her seat</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  what do you suggest?&quot; she asked wearily;</p>
  <p>Cyril  looked at her for a minute without speaking. He cared but little for her  opinion. He knew that she appreciated his character at its exact worth. And yet  he hesitated to speak. A sense of shame, which had long been foreign to him,  tied his tongue.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  what do you suggest?&quot; repeated Gertrude, turning to him with a look of  surprise.</p>
  <p>Cyril  saw that there was nothing to be done but to face the difficulty and brazen it  out.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  remedy lies in your hands,&quot; he said abruptly, but he did not dare look at  her as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;In  my hands,&quot; interjected Gertrude.</p>
  <p>&quot;In  your hands,&quot; he repeated. &quot;You have only to apply to Adam Dyke and  our troubles are over.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  started to her feet.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  would rather starve than do it,&quot; she cried. &quot;God knows that I am not  what I ought to be, that I am not what I might have been, but I haven't fallen  so low as that.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  shrugged his shoulders, and, putting his cigar to his lips, took two or three  sharp pulls at it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  you have named the alternative,&quot; he said, speaking with excessive  deliberation. &quot;I can't hold out for another month, and so I tell  you.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  threw herself into her chair again, and covered her face with her hands.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  why did I ever marry you?&quot; she exclaimed bitterly.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's  easily answered,&quot; Cyril returned. &quot;You fancied yourself in love with  me. I was under the same impression, and encouraged you. However, that has  nothing to do with it. You can save us if you will. The question is, will you  do it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Never!  never!&quot; cried Gertrude passionately.</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  you know exactly what to expect,&quot; Cyril said, speaking with well simulated  indifference as he turned to her. &quot;I haven't exaggerated my position. If  some one doesn't come to the rescue, and within the next few days too,  everything we have in the world will have to be sold off.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  shivered, and tears came into her eyes. &quot;Is it really as bad as  that?&quot; she asked earnestly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Every  bit,&quot; he answered firmly, seeing that Gertrude was beginning to waver.  &quot;And I put it to you, who will feel it most, you or I?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What  have you done with your money?&quot; sobbed his wife.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  money was made by betting and gambling,&quot; answered Cyril, confessing the  fact as if it was such an evident truth that there was no necessity to state  it. &quot;It has gone the same way,&quot; and then he added, with an undisguised  sneer, &quot;I think you have done your share towards spending it too, eh?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  I didn't know, Cyril. I had no idea&mdash;&quot; she began. </p>
  <p>He  threw his cigar with such force into the grate that it bounded out, again on to  the carpet, where for a moment or two he left it smouldering.</p>
  <p>&quot;Didn't  know!&quot; he cried angrily. &quot;Two months ago I told you what we might  expect if you didn't stop your cursed extravagance, or if I didn't have a turn  of luck.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You  were in such a temper,&quot; pleaded Gertrude, whose courage had quite evaporated  at the dismal prospect which Cyril held out, &quot;that I thought you only  wanted to frighten me.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  rose from his chair, and reaching up to the gasalier, began turning out the  gas.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  we can't stop up all night discussing the question,&quot; he said. &quot;A night's  reflection may bring you to your senses. That Adam Dyke will help us&mdash;will help  you, I mean&mdash;is absolutely certain. The man's conduct for the last four years is  a positive proof in my eyes that he has never ceased to regret his loss,&quot;  Cyril's lip curled as he used the phrase; &quot;and I&mdash;I&mdash;I have reasons myself  for knowing that he&mdash;he is of a very forgiving character.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  I can't do it, I can't!&quot; protested Gertrude, though not as firmly as  before. &quot;What would people say if it ever came to their ears? And it would  come to their ears. As soon as they knew we were reconciled every one would  guess the reason.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Bah!  You are getting very thin-skinned all at once. You are the only one of your  family that has any compunction about the matter,&quot; he sneered. &quot;I  think the old people have bled him pretty freely, and I should think that  infernal brother of yours has had a pretty good harvest too.&quot;</p>
  <p>Half  an hour before Gertrude would have defended her kin with no little warmth. She  now hung her head, and two great tears fell on her jewelled hands.</p>
  <p>&quot;Think  how it would compromise me,&quot; she sobbed.</p>
  <p>Cyril  cast a look of contempt at her, which it was as well she did not see. &quot;Compromise  you!&quot; he repeated. &quot;Isn't it me rather that it would  compromise?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  if I took money from him,&quot; urged Gertrude.</p>
  <p>Cyril  stepped to her side, and caught hold of her left hand, the fingers of which  were covered with costly rings.</p>
  <p>&quot;All  these were given to you by your friends,&quot; he cried. &quot;Have they  compromised you? That necklace, which must have cost &pound;100, was a gift. Has it  compromised you? You have done nothing for three years past but get everything  that you could out of everybody. Has that compromised you?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  all that was so different,&quot; Gertrude began, when Cyril with an oath left  the room.</p>
  <p>An  hour passed&mdash;two hours&mdash;and still Gertrude sat there, with her burning head in  her hands. The fire went out, and the cold morning air crept into the room, and  still there she remained thinking out the problem of her life. The past rose  before her, the old old past, when she was a modest, contented, and happy girl,  and it appeared brighter than it had ever seemed. She thought of girls of her  own age, girls who had married about the same time that she did, girls whom she  had despised in the past, and whose lot she had never envied, and a great yearning  filled her heart. &quot;If I had married a good man,&quot; she cried, &quot;I  might have been as one of those. Oh! Adam Dyke, Adam Dyke! why did you let me slip  through your hands?&quot; And then the future rose before her black with misery and  trials, and she hid her face in her hands afresh, and wept the most bitter  tears of her life.</p>
  <p>The  light of dawn, streaming into the room, called her to herself. Cold, exhausted,  and miserable, she went to her room.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  I could only pray,&quot; she cried. &quot;If there was only some one to help me  to be my old self once more, some one to take an interest in me, some one to  hold me back from being worse than I am.&quot;</p>
  <p>At  this moment the cry of a child resounded through the still house. Gertrude  started. She had but the one, a little girl, and in her spasmodic way she was  fond of the little creature. As a rule when the child cried she would go in and  pet her, but that night an undefinable feeling restrained her.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  she should ever be like me!&quot; she sobbed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk11"></a>Chapter  XI.<br>
WHICH SHOWS THAT CYRIL PATON KNEW HIS WIFE BETTER THAN SHE KNEW HERSELF.</h2>
  <p>On  the morning after the interview just described Adam Dyke and Oliver Barron were  breakfasting together in the well-furnished diningroom of a house in  Collins-street east.</p>
  <p>The  house was the same that Adam had prepared so carefully for Gertrude's  occupation, and in which he had lived ever since her marriage. At his earnest  solicitation Oliver had come to live with him, and though the latter found the  life there somewhat dull after that of Heimweh, he had such an affection and a  pity for Adam that he had never repented the determination.</p>
  <p>&quot;Dines  called in just before you came down,&quot; said Adam, &quot;with a message from  your father, he wants to see me on business, and then take lunch with him. So I  shan't be home to lunch. You had better lunch out too, unless you'll come to  the office about one and join us.&quot;'</p>
  <p>Oliver  pushed his plate away with an impatient gesture.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  say, Adam,&quot; he said, &quot;I wish to goodness you would have a settling-up  with the governor, &quot;and get a statement from him to show you exactly how  you stand. It seems to me that you are getting a great deal too deeply involved;  and as for the governor, though I have no doubt he means well, he'll go into  anything as long as he can find the money to finance it. If I were you I should  cut the whole business. You're not a business man. Neither is the governor, for  all that he thinks he is. His whole commercial life proves that he isn't.</p>
  <p>As  Oliver spoke an uncomfortable look came into Adam's eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  I&mdash;I've a pretty good idea as to what risk I run,&quot; he stammered, trying in  vain to assume an air of ease. &quot;Your father is such a good fellow,&quot;  he added with some warmth, &quot;that I shouldn't like him to think that&mdash;that I  doubt him, or the truth of his&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Doubt  him, nonsense!&quot; interrupted Oliver impatiently. &quot;It's purely a matter  of business, nothing more nor less. You have a large sum at stake, and I tell  you candidly, as my father's son, that I want you to find out exactly how you  stand.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  looked surprised.</p>
  <p>&quot;I&mdash;I  don't quite understand you!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  the fact of the matter is, that every one is discussing the governor's  speculations,&quot; said Oliver, taking the bull by the horns. &quot;I hear on  all sides that he always buys when he should sell, and sells when he should  buy. He has no judgment, and, as far as I can find out, never had. He's too  sanguine and too easily carried away.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;If  he isn't right, I'm sure he means well,&quot; interjected Adam.</p>
  <p>&quot;Means  well! Of course, he does!&quot; impatiently returned Oliver. &quot;But one  wants more than good intentions as a security for one's money.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  assented with a nod.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now  your carelessness encourages him. When he knows that he has only to apply to  you, let the sum be what it may, and you'll see him through, he doesn't take  the trouble to exercise the little judgment he has. I may tell you I've spoken  to him on the subject&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  Oliver, I wish you hadn't!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And  he didn't quite like it. He looks upon me as only a boy, and somewhat resented  what he called my interference. Now look here, old man,&quot; he said, as he  got up from his chair, and placing his hand on Adam's shoulder looked into his  face, &quot;I want you to promise me that you won't go into anything new  without consulting me. You know how grateful I am for all your kindness to me,  and how fond I am of you, so I know that you won't think that I am interfering  from interested motives.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;My  dear boy, I couldn't think such a thing!&quot; exclaimed Adam, with a look that  attested the truth of the assertion.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  be more careful. Go through your accounts! or, if it's too much bother, give  them to me to go through for you. As far as I can see, helping my father is  just like pouring water into the sea. The more he gets the more he wants. Now,  I ask you, Adam, have you ever had a profit out of anything?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh  well&mdash;yes, yes! some small sums,&quot; Adam faltered, as his face grew red.  &quot;Not quite what I expected, but it'll be&mdash;be all right some day, I  suppose.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Some  day! Nonsense!&quot; exclaimed Oliver impatiently. &quot;Some day you'll wake  up and find that it will cost you half of what you've got to pull you through.  Well, I must be off to business&quot; he said, consulting the clock. &quot;You  won't go into anything more, will you? Not without consulting me?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  speak to you first,&quot; Adam assented, and with that very unsatisfactory answer  Oliver had to be content.</p>
  <p>The  conversation made a deep impression on Adam, the more so that he had long  recognised the truth, though he had hesitated to admit it. He was very fond of  Mr. Barron, and could not bear the idea of doing anything which might be  construed into a doubt, not of his integrity, but of his ability. It was,  therefore, with no pleasurable feelings that he made his way to the office. Mr.  Barron was eagerly awaiting him.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  dear Adam,&quot; he cried, &quot;I'm so glad that you have turned up to time.  I've the best thing on that I ever had in my life.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam's  colour rose, for Oliver's words were still ringing in his ears.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  hope it's&mdash;it's nothing fresh,&quot; he faltered, trying to pave the way for a refusal,  if it should be necessary, &quot;for I've made up my mind not&mdash;not to go in for any  new speculations for the time being. For the time being,&quot; he repeated in  answer to an unmistakable look of astonishment in the merchant's eyes.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron had aged in the four years that had elapsed since his first business  transaction with Adam Dyke more than that period warranted. He had been grey  enough before but his florid complexion had made him appear younger than he  was. Now he looked fifteen years older, if he looked a day. The colour except  in moments of excitement, had left his cheeks; his eyes were sunken in his  head; and not only was there a network of crow's feet at the corners of the  eyes, but two great lines ran down between the nose and the cheeks, which even  his heavy moustache did not hide. Moreover, he stooped, and his voice had  already the asthmatic weakness of declining health</p>
  <p>&quot;Why  you're not going to decline before you hear what it is?&quot; exclaimed Mr.  Barron, in a tone which betrayed his disappointment.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  no, of course not!&quot; faltered Adam anxious to allay the old man's  disappointment. &quot;But the fact is this, I've been thinking over things  lately, and I really don't see what the use is of&mdash;of bothering oneself over  business. I've got ten times as much as I can possibly spend though I've had  some very heavy losses, as you know, and I don't care&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>A  flush came into Mr. Barron's thin cheeks and his deep-set eyes glittered like  jewels.</p>
  <p>&quot;You've  been talking to Oliver,&quot; he interrupted angrily, &quot;and I should like  to know what he knows about business matters,&quot; he added, as he saw a  guilty look in Adam's eyes.</p>
  <p>Adam  in a few broken words acknowledged that Oliver had spoken to him, but protested  warmly that the advice was given as much in Mr. Barron's interest as his own.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  for his advice,&quot; cried Mr. Barron, snapping his fingers. &quot;I should  like to know what business it is of his. To think of his interfering at this  time, too, when I've here,&quot; he took up a bundle of papers, &quot;a certain  fortune. There's fifty thousand pounds in it in three years. Fifty thousand? A  hundred thousand! and not a shadow of a risk. Oh! Adam, Adam!&quot; he cried,  as he caught him by the arm, &quot;I beg of you, I beseech you, to at least  have a look at it. We've been unlucky together, I don't deny it. Now when we've  a chance of making up all our losses&mdash;all our losses&mdash;in one coup, don't desert  me.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  old man pleaded as if it were a question of life and death. As he finished  speaking, his voice gave way, and he sat down in a chair, apparently quite overcome  by his emotion.</p>
  <p>His  evident grief was quite enough to win over Adam Dyke.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh! I'll look into it, of course,&quot; he said in a cheery voice. &quot;The only  thing is, that I really don't care twopence for making any more money.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Consider  my position, Adam,&quot; cried the old man, as with eager fingers he undid the  packet of papers. &quot;Think what it is to owe you what I do without a  prospect of paying you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  often told you that if I'm never paid I shan't feel it,&quot; said Adam  hastily, and then he added with the evident intention of turning the subject,  &quot;Well, let us have a look at the papers.&quot;</p>
  <p>That  evening at dinner Adam told Oliver, to the latter's outspoken indignation, that  he had gone in for &quot;just one more speculation,&quot; but gave a  half-promise that that should be the last.</p>
  <p>&quot;May  I ask what this last Eldorado is?&quot; asked Oliver stiffly.</p>
  <p>&quot;A  sugar plantation in Queensland,&quot; answered Adam, and then he proceeded to  give him a graphic account of the profits which must accrue from his new  investment. &quot;For once I'm enthusiastic myself. Now don't you think it's a  good thing, Oliver?&quot; he asked when he had finished his description.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  may or it may not be. I don't know and don't care,&quot; answered Oliver with  some temper, and then, seeing a pained look in Adam's eyes, he hastened to  apologise for his gruffness.</p>
  <p>At  this moment a servant entered the room, and handed Adam a letter. He took it  carelessly from the salver, but he no sooner caught sight of the writing than he  fell back in his chair with an exclamation of surprise, if not of pain, and  every scrap of colour left his cheeks.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  is it?&quot; Oliver asked, jumping up and going to his side. When Oliver saw  the handwriting he, too, started.</p>
  <p>Adam's  finger was already on the flap of the envelope, and in another moment it would  have been opened, when Oliver caught him by the hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Think  before you open it!&quot; he cried. &quot;Think what it may lead to. Ought you  to do it?&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was a look in Adam's eyes that Oliver read but too well. He knew that Adam had  been yearning for that summons for years, and with a sigh he withdrew his hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  Adam!&quot; he said in a strangely quiet tone. &quot;Poor Adam!&quot;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Adam had opened the letter, and devoured its contents. His face turned pale as he  read.</p>
  <p>&quot;She  wishes to see me! She's going away! Oh! Oliver, read what she says,&quot; he cried  as he tendered the letter to Oliver, who thrust it back with an impatient  gesture. &quot;Read it, and you would forgive her as I do.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;That  I'll never do,&quot; exclaimed the young man angrily, &quot;or the scoundrel  that she married. No more will you, Adam, if you are wise. Oh, for Heaven's  sake, don't go and see her!&quot; he implored. &quot;I know that if you do it will  end miserably. They have some object in view, depend upon it, and nothing to  your benefit, you may be sure.&quot;</p>
  <p>Only  twice in four years had Adam caught sight of Gertrude, and then only at a  distance. She had carefully avoided the risk of meeting him, and he had been  equally desirous of avoiding her. Shame had dictated her action, a desire to  avoid pain his. But all the time his heart had yearned for a reconciliation. He  had not now the resolution to refrain from what he felt might endanger his  future. If he had been certain that the step would wreck his life again he would  have taken it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver,  I must see her!&quot; he answered. &quot;If you knew what I've gone through the  last few years&mdash;if you knew how I've longed to see her&mdash;if you knew how my heart  has been breaking&mdash;you wouldn't ask me not to.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  hung his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  known it all,&quot; he said sadly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  don't try to dissuade me. Oh! Gertrude, Gertrude!&quot; Adam cried, as he held  the letter in his trembling hands, and read again the few lines which had moved  him so much, &quot;you have ruined my life, but you can do much to repair it.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>The  mental conflict which Gertrude Paton went through before she acceded to her husband's  suggestion was a most severe one, but once she had given in she threw herself  into the development of the plot with a feverish enthusiasm. She never doubted  for a moment that she would be successful. Whilst her triumphs in the world of  fashion had bred in her confidence in her powers of fascination, her knowledge  of Adam's simple character assured her that those powers would not be exerted  in vain. The shame which she had felt when Cyril had proposed the step to her  had already waned, and when her conscience pricked her, as it necessarily did  from time to time, an inner voice found ready excuses for her action. &quot;Poor  fellow! he loved me so that he'll be only too happy to see me,&quot; she said  to herself, and, as not infrequently happens when people are anxious to explain  away base motives, she ended by considering that she was acting absolutely in  Adam's interest, and that his welfare solely dictated her action.</p>
  <p>I  say that she &quot;ended&quot; by coming to this conclusion. This was hardly  so. Just at the last moment her conscience gave her several awkward twinges,  and the old feeling of shame revived to a most unwelcome degree as she awaited  Adam's coming. That he would come she never doubted. His life for the last four  years only too strongly attested the depth of the wound she had inflicted. She  heard at all hands that he had never got over his loss, and her knowledge of  the man told her that he never would. It is not a matter of wonder, then, that  the thought of meeting him should bring a blush of shame to her cheek, or that  a burning desire to have the awkward moment over should make her heart beat as  it had not beaten for years.</p>
  <p>But  if Gertrude Paton was thus moved she did not show it as she lay on a sofa in  her drawingroom awaiting Adam's arrival, no one would have guessed that she was  in the slightest degree nervous. There was no unusual colour in her cheeks, and  though her eyes were bright they were not brighter than they often were.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-12-a.png" width="720" height="566"></p>
  <p>Gertrude  had always paid great attention to dress, for she had a keen eye for the <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>, but this night she had  dressed herself with peculiar care. She wore a brocaded tea-gown, and round her  neck a deep collar of delicate lace was caught in at the throat by a diamond  brooch. Her hair was loosely coiled at the top of her head, and a thousand  mutinous ripples overshadowed her white unwrinkled brow. Even the light had  been a matter of study. As a rule gas was burned in the room, but that evening  the only light was from a lamp which stood on a small table slightly behind  her. On this table were also a fan, a pocket-handkerchief, and a bottle of  smelling-salts, which were to be used should occasion require.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  had calculated to within a few minutes when Adam would arrive, but though her  calculation was verified his arrival took her by surprise. She had begun to  hope that something might put it off, and from hoping she had ended by  believing it. When the bell rang she started, and a blush of shame dyed her  cheek. But every atom of colour left her face when the man she had so cruelly  wronged stood in the room before her. She had nerved herself for that moment.  She would do so-and-so and so-and-so. She had even prepared phrases of welcome,  prayers for forgiveness, avowals of her guilt, and appeals for clemency. The  moment had come, and she was dumb.</p>
  <p>For  a moment Adam Dyke stood there, just inside the door, motionless. His eager  eyes were riveted on Gertrude, who hung her head, and a feverish colour lit up  his worn face. Then with a cry he rushed to her side and caught her  outstretched hand. As he did so she raised her eyes to his, and a blush of shame  set her cheeks aflame.</p>
  <p>&quot;Can  you forgive me?&quot; she asked.</p>
  <p>The  question was answered before Adam spoke. There was a light in his eyes, a light  of gratitude, a light of happiness, a light of love, which Gertrude's practised  eye read at a glance.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  never blamed you,&quot; he said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk12"></a>Chapter  XII.<br>
WHAT NOT INFREQUENTLY FOLLOWS THE RECONCILIATION OF OLD LOVERS.</h2>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale's virtue, like old wine, improved with age. She grew more exacting as  years went on, and though she took no practical steps to stamp out the abuses  which so sorely exercised her, she criticised them with a freedom and vigour  that redounded to her credit. Mrs. Paton's reconciliation with Adam Dyke was a  glorious opportunity, and Mrs. Dale seized on it with avidity. She pronounced  it scandalous, which in the primary sense of the word it certainly was, and  enlarged on the enormity of Adam's conduct fully as much as on that of the  Patons. Ill-natured people suggested that Mrs. Dale was actuated by no little  malice in her attacks on poor Adam. They averred, with what truth I cannot say,  that she had left no stone unturned to secure him as a son-in-law, when his  engagement to Gertrude had fallen through. Her visits to Collins-street east  were certainly very numerous at that time, but I ask any person of an unbiassed  mind if it is not a monstrous thing that interested motives should be imputed  for such an obviously well-intentioned and kindly-prompted proceeding.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  dear Mrs. Churcher,&quot; she said one afternoon to that lady, whom she was  visiting, &quot;I've called in on purpose to ask you if you are going to the  Patons. I really don't think we ought.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Churcher raised her eyebrows.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  why not?&quot; she asked, with a smile.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  really&mdash;you know&mdash;it's somewhat&mdash;it's a somewhat delicate matter to discuss,&quot;  stammered Mrs. Dale, with an uneasy glance in the direction of Mr. Champlin,  who was, apparently, deeply interested in a photograph album at the time,  &quot;and I hardly like to go into particulars. What I mean is, don't you think  people who are so much talked about are better avoided?&quot;</p>
  <p>A  curious look came into Mrs. Churcher's eyes, but was gone again before Mrs.  Dale could notice it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Talked  about, are they?&quot; she exclaimed innocently. &quot;What have they been  doing? Pease tell me.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  Mrs. Churcher spoke she leant forward with an expression of the greatest  interest, and Mr. Champlin, who caught sight of her, held up the album before  his face to hide his laughter.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  It you've heard nothing it's just as well that you shouldn't,&quot; said Mrs.  Dale sharply, with an unmistakable tinge of vexation in her voice. &quot;Of  course you'll go. There's no reason why you shouldn't. Only I thought that  everyone in Melbourne, everyone of any standing,&quot; she added, as she rose  to go, &quot;was full of what I must say I consider a disgraceful, scandalous&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;state  of affairs.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Churcher raised her eyebrows more than ever, and her thin lips parted in  surprise.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  so sorry to hear it,&quot; she said, as she shook hands with Mrs. Dale, who  could hardly restrain her anger; &quot;but please don't tell me until after  their party. They always give such good dances, you know, that I should be  quite sorry&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  I shan't say anything more,&quot; interrupted Mrs. Dale, shortly. &quot;I shall  leave you to hear of it elsewhere.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Churcher accompanied her to the door as Mr. Champlin rang the bell for the  servant.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  good-bye, dear Mrs. Dale,&quot; she said, affably. &quot;I'm so sorry that we  shan't see you at the Patons.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale was no sooner at a safe distance than Mrs. Churcher burst into a fit of  laughter, in which she was joined with no small heartiness by Mr. Champlin.</p>
  <p>&quot;By  Jove! good as a play,&quot; laughed the latter, as he looked at Mrs. Churcher  with no small admiration. &quot;How you scored off the old party, eh? I wonder  how you could keep your face.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  I've had some practice.&quot; Mrs. Churcher returned, with a significant smile,  as she sank into an arm-chair. &quot;Now, come here,&quot; she went on, as she  pointed to a footstool near, &quot;and I'll tell you what will happen  now.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,&quot;  exclaimed Mr. Champlin, as he obeyed her.</p>
  <p>&quot;She'll  turn her attention to us. I've had my laugh, but it will cost me dear. There  isn't a house that she will visit for the next week that won't be regaled with  the terrible misdemeanours of Alice Churcher and Fred Champlin.&quot; As she  spoke a somewhat serious look came into her eyes. &quot;Well, never mind  that!&quot; she exclaimed, with a wave of the hand as if she were dismissing an  unpleasant subject. &quot;Go on with what you were telling me about Cyril  Paton.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  you know there was going to be an awful row. He'd had a bad run of luck, and  hadn't paid anyone for months and months. Well, one day last week he turned up,  to everyone's surprise, with any amount of money&mdash;just as some of them were  talking of bringing him before the committee, too&mdash;and&mdash; and he paid  everybody.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  that certainly is suspicious,&quot; admitted Mrs. Churcher. &quot;If you  remember the same thing happened just before he was married, and though it has  never been proved, there's no doubt whatever that he got the money from Adam  Dyke.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;That's  what I said!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Champlin with a nod of satisfaction. &quot;And  I ask you, from who could he get the money now but from Dyke?&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Churcher smiled.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  really must ask Mr. Churcher to borrow some money from you,&quot; she said  drily.</p>
  <p>Now  for all that Mr. Champlin had till quite recently been attached to Government-house,  and was in great request in Melbourne society, his pecuniary position was not  at all a desirable one. He fired up at Mrs. Churcher's remark.</p>
  <p>&quot;You're  deuced rough on a fellow, Alice,&quot; he grumbled.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Churcher shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  let us change the subject,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm out of sorts this  afternoon.&quot;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Mrs. Dale, who was devoting her afternoon to paying calls, for which purpose  she had hired a cab by the hour, was well on her way to the Patons. A  consciousness of discomfiture had not improved her temper, and by the time that  she was shown into Gertrude's drawing-room she was ready to find fault with  anything and anybody at the slightest provocation. But there was one person at  whom she was itching to have a thrust, and that person was Mrs. Churcher. The  latter had prophesied that she would turn her attention to her. She little knew  how soon her prediction would be verified.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  come straight from the Churchers,&quot; said Mrs. Dale to Gertrude, as she  helped her to a cup of tea, but in reality addressing the whole room, which was  full of visitors, &quot;but I need not say that I didn't stay there long. I  think that our sex is not in great request in that household, especially when&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes!  especially when?&quot; interjected one of the company, as Mrs. Dale hesitated,  with a view to stimulate the curiosity of her hearers.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!''  said Mrs. Dale, with a glance round to see that there was no one present whose  modest ears her disclosure might offend. &quot;Especially when Mr. Champlin is  having a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the  mistress of the house.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale said this with a significant emphasis that was not to be misunderstood.  Her hearers were used to such remarks from her lips, and hitherto had paid but  little attention to them. But that afternoon they looked at each other, instead  of laughing as they were wont to do, and kept a discreet silence. Gertrude  coloured to the roots of her hair. She knew what was passing through their  minds as if they had spoken, and a feeling of indignation and shame filled her.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  really think you might be more charitable, Mrs. Dale,&quot; she said, with no  little warmth. &quot;I have yet to learn that a lady forfeits the good opinion  of the world it she has a friend of the opposite sex.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was Mrs. Dale's turn to get red.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  I really, really didn't know that I was mentioning anything I shouldn't,&quot;  she stammered. &quot;I'm sure I'm the last person in the world who would say  anything ill-natured of anybody.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  had by this time recovered her presence of mind. She felt that she had made a  great mistake in exhibiting such warmth over the matter, and now hastened to  repair her error.</p>
  <p>&quot;Of  course you are!&quot; She laughed. &quot;Well, are you coming to our ball, Mrs.  Dale? I hope you are, and that you will bring the girls.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Coming?  I should think I was,&quot; replied the old hypocrite with an amiable smile.  &quot;I wouldn't miss it for anything.&quot;</p>
  <p>After  this the conversation drifted into a variety of topics of no interest to us,  and half an hour later Gertrude was left alone.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  a fool I was to lose my head,&quot; she reflected, as she watched Mrs. Dale and  another lady walking to the gate. &quot;What can have come over me? And to  think that that transparent old mischief-maker should have induced me to forget  myself!&quot;</p>
  <p>At  that very moment Mrs. Dale was returning to the subject which had caused  Gertrude's discomfiture.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  these women stand up for each other,&quot; she remarked to her companion.  &quot;You have only to attack one and you bring the others about your ears like  a swarm of bees. And did you notice Gertrude's colour when I spoke?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  should think I did!&quot; assented the other.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  did! Well, you may believe me,&quot; said Mrs. Dale with an impressive nod,  &quot;that Gertrude Paton's friendship with Adam Dyke isn't as innocent as that  young woman would have us believe.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  opinion which Mrs. Dale thus openly expressed had been gaining ground in  Melbourne ever since the reconciliation between Adam and the Patons four months  before, and it must be confessed that it was not to be wondered at when a woman  is but rarely seen with her husband, and is constantly in the company of  another man, it is only natural that unfavourable deductions should be drawn.  There were especial reasons why the intimate relations existing between Adam  and Gertrude should be thus unfavourably criticised. Not the least of these was  that to which Mr. Champlin referred in his conversation with Mrs. Churcher just  recorded. When people who are head over ears in debt suddenly pay off all their  liabilities the world speculates as to the source of their wealth. No one who  considered the improved position of the Patons doubted for a moment that Adam  Dyke's purse was at the bottom of their prosperity. Once that granted,  criticisms of a very unpleasant character immediately followed, and whilst the  conduct of the Patons was condemned in unmeasured terms, that of Adam himself  did not escape severe comment.</p>
  <p>Though  Gertrude had long known this, it was only that very afternoon that she had  realised her actual position, and long after her visitors had gone she sat in  the drawingroom, sadly and seriously thinking it out. It was in vain that she  tried to console herself with the reflection that she cared but little for the  good opinion of the world. Those who protest the loudest that they do not value  it often feel its loss the most. When people enjoy it they think that they are  independent of it. When they have lost it they say they are independent of it.  The silence of her visitors that afternoon had brought this home to her, and it  was a bitter lesson. But no tears came to her eyes. She formed no resolutions  to regain her good name. No! her heart was steeled against public opinion, and  the more she thought of it the more she was resolved to fight the world to the  bitter end.</p>
  <p>She  was still wrapped in such gloomy thoughts when a servant came in to light the  gas, and she was reminded that it was time to dress for dinner, Adam was to  dine with her, and they were going to the theatre afterwards, where Cyril had  promised to join them. She was soon dressed, and when she went into the  drawingroom again Adam was there.</p>
  <p>The  excitement of the afternoon had brought an unusual colour to her cheeks, an  unwonted brightness to her eyes, and as Adam looked at her his face betrayed  his admiration,</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you think my dress a pretty one?&quot; she asked him with a smile &quot;I hope  you do, for I chose it purposely for you. I know that you are so fond of light  colours, and I'm told that pink suits me.&quot;</p>
  <p>Suit  her! Indeed it did! Cleopatra herself never looked the queen more than Gertrude  Paton did that night.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  are told the truth, then,&quot; said Adam, in his deliberate way, and then he  added, blushing as he spoke, &quot;I think you grow more beautiful every day.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  afraid that that is only in your eyes,&quot; she laughed. &quot;However, it's  pleasant to be told so, especially as I rarely get such compliments from the  quarter whence I might expect them,&quot; she added with a sigh.</p>
  <p>Adam's  face darkened.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wish Cyril kept at home a little more than he does,&quot; he said earnestly.  &quot;I can't understand him staying at the club when he has a home like this to  come to. I'm sure that if I had&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Then  he stopped, and as his face flashed a pained look came into his eyes. Gertrude  laid her hand on his arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;Never  even think of what you were on the point of saying,&quot; she said gravely.  &quot;It's best for both of us to wipe it from our memories as it had never  been.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  phrase may have been used designedly, but more probably it was the outcome of  her thoughts of the afternoon. Be that as it may, it caused Adam's heart to  beat as it had not done for years, and he hid his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>They  had often dined together before, but never till then had they felt awkward in  each other's presence. But the consciousness of altered conditions made them  both nervous and uncomfortable. They were both glad when dinner was over.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  rose from table the first, but Adam was not long in following her to the  drawing-room. As he passed through the hall he took a packet from the table</p>
  <p>&quot;Wait  a minute, Gertrude,&quot; he said to her as she was going to leave the room,  excusing himself for doing so on the plea that it was time to get ready. &quot;I  want to speak to you for a few minutes.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  sat down on the sofa, but she didn't speak, nor did she raise her eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Just  now you asked me not to mention a certain&mdash;a certain thing.&quot; he said, speaking  very slowly and in a low voice, &quot;and after this I shall try to obey you. But  there are reasons why I must speak of it now.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  cast an appealing glance at him, and she bit her lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  must!&quot; Adam persisted. &quot;When we were to be married, Gertrude, I  proposed settling one of my properties on you, the most valuable one that I  then possessed, the most valuable that I possess now. I wished you to feel that  you had something of your own, and that you were independent of my purse. The  settlement that was then drawn up I wish to carry into effect now.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  shook her head violently, and as she looked up there were tears in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  couldn't accept it!&quot; she cried.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  must accept it!&quot; he exclaimed with warmth. &quot;Do you think that it doesn't cut  me to the quick to know how badly off you are? Do you think it hasn't wounded me  deeply to know that you are compelled to accept my assistance? Accept what I offer,  Gertrude, and it spares us both, you the shame of asking, me the shame of  giving. Think, my dear girl,&quot; he said, as he sat down by her and took her  hand in his with the gentleness of a woman. &quot;It would be nothing to me,  and so much to you. I have more than I can possibly spend. I haven't a relation  in the world, and beyond Oliver and your parents there isn't a soul who has the  slightest claim on me. Accept it, then, Gertrude. You don't know how happy you  would make me.&quot;</p>
  <p>For  a long time Gertrude held out, but her opposition, which was genuine enough at first,  grew fainter and fainter, and at last she gave in.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  here are the deeds,&quot; cried Adam, as he undid the parcel with eager fingers:  &quot;and may God give you a long life to enjoy your property.&quot; He laughed  as he spoke, and as he opened one of the parchments his eyes were bright with pleasure  and merriment. &quot;Here you are,&quot; he said, as he pointed to Gertrude's  name in the deed. &quot;Gertrude Paton, wife of Cyril Paton, of Toorak,  gentleman, and every acre of it your own&mdash;your very own.&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was such a heartiness in his manner that Gertrude caught some of his spirit,  and laughed as she looked over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&quot;They  always call you the Squatter King. Do you think they will call me the Squatter  Queen?&quot; she asked.</p>
  <p>Adam  looked his answer before a word passed his lips.</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed  I do,&quot; he said heartily. &quot;And, by the by,&quot; he cried, as he  caught up a packet which had been enclosed in the first, &quot;here is  something more to effect the transformation.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke he undid the parcel. There was a leather case inside. He opened it, and  disclosed a magnificent necklace of diamonds.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  bought this for you, you know when,&quot; he said, the merriment dying out of  his voice as he spoke, &quot;and I have kept it by me ever since. There my dear  girl,&quot; he said, as he placed the case in her hands, &quot;at last it has reached  its right destination. Wear it to-night.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  left the case lying in her lap. She raised her eyes to Adam's face, and there  was gratitude and pleasure plainly written in them. She caught him by the hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank  you! oh, thank you a thousand times!&quot; she cried, and then in a sudden  freak she took the jewels from the case and placed them in Adam's hands.  &quot;Now you must put them on.&quot;</p>
  <p>With  a trembling hand Adam did so, and as his fingers touched her snowy neck a  strange thrill went through him.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  do you think they look?&quot; she asked, as she turned to him, and herself  looked down to where the brilliants were rising and falling on her breast.</p>
  <p>For  a moment, and a moment only, Adam looked at the jewels, and then his eyes  looked into hers as they had never looked before.</p>
  <p>&quot;Gertrude,  my darling! my darling!&quot; he cried, and catching her to his arms he kissed  her.</p>
  <p>The  action was not that of a lover, and Adam assuredly did not look upon it in that  light, and yet as their lips touched a guilty feeling leapt into his heart and  he gently thrust her from him.</p>
  <p>A  time came when he would have given his right hand to have resisted the  temptation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk13"></a></a>Chapter  XIII.<br>
WHICH SHOWS THE DANGER OF NOT KEEPING ONES CHEQUE-BOOK UNDER LOCK AND KEY.</h2>
  <p>There  is no appointment which a man is more likely to forget than one with his wife.  Cyril Paton, who had dined at the club, went home almost immediately after  dinner. He had quite forgotten that he was to join Gertrude at the theatre, and  was surprised not to find her at home on his arrival.</p>
  <p>&quot;Where  have you been?&quot; he asked somewhat gruffly when she made her appearance.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  was usually pale, but a bright spot came into either cheek at the tone in which  the question was asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  theatre!&quot; she answered curtly, as she threw herself wearily into a chair,  undoing her wraps as she did so. &quot;You promised to be there.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;By  Jove! so I did!&quot; exclaimed Cyril. &quot;I forgot all about it. The fact is  I met&mdash;. Hello! where the deuce did you get that?&quot; he asked as he caught sight  of the necklace.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr.  Dyke gave it me,&quot; said Gertrude quietly. &quot;It was to have been my  wedding present.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  laughed, and a hard look came into his mean eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  just as welcome now, eh? as it would have been then!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;Let me have a look at it&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  undid the necklace, and handed it to him.</p>
  <p>&quot;By  Heaven! they're beautiful diamonds,&quot; exclaimed Cyril, standing up and  holding them near the chandelier. &quot;They must have cost a thousand if they  cost a penny,&quot; he added, as he handed the jewels back to his wife.</p>
  <p>There  was something in Cyril's manner which provoked Gertrude beyond measure, and it  was with no little warmth that she expressed her opinion that Adam had not  considered the cost when he bought them.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't suppose he did, as they were for you,&quot; retorted Cyril, savagely.  &quot;Your family, certainly, have the knack of bleeding him. I can understand his  having a weakness for you, and not minding spending money on you, but why the  dickens he should keep the whole family passes my comprehension.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  started to her feet, her face aflame.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  coward! You mean, paltry coward!&quot; she cried. &quot;How dare you say such a  thing? You, who forced me into asking this man to help us! You, who accept his  money, and lose no opportunity of reviling him!&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  Paton held up his hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  will do, Gertrude,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;I was wrong. The fact is I'm  hipped. I'm out of luck, and worried. I don't mean half I say.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  caught up her wraps, and with one contemptuous glance at her husband turned on  her heel.</p>
  <p>&quot;Stay,  Gertrude,&quot; he cried. &quot;I want to speak to you.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  faced him.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  is it?&quot; she asked wearily.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sit  down, because it will take me a few minutes,&quot; he said, and he didn't look  at his ease as he spoke. &quot;It's most unfortunate that we should have had a  bit of a row, especially over Dyke, as&mdash;as I want to discuss money matters with  you.&quot;</p>
  <p>If  ever contempt was legibly written on a woman's face it was on Gertrude's.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  means that you want me to apply to Mr. Dyke for money,&quot; she said.</p>
  <p>Cyril  nodded.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  do!&quot; he said. &quot;The fact is that unless I get about &pound;400 or &pound;500 to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow,  d'ye hear?&mdash;I'm done for. I can't ask him, you know that. He gave me &pound;500 only  10 days ago, but you&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  stamped her foot.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  your life depended on it, ay, and mine,&quot; she added, striking her breast,  &quot;I wouldn't do it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  known you refuse before, and then come round,&quot; he sneered.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  would to Heaven that I had never done it&quot; she cried passionately!</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  it's rather late in the evening for heroics,&quot; said Cyril contemptuously.  &quot;Perhaps you will be more reasonable in the morning.&quot;</p>
  <p>But  the morning saw no change in Gertrude's position. In spite of Cyril's  entreaties and threats she kept to her determination.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  the deuce I'm to do Heaven only knows,&quot; reflected Cyril. &quot;I can't ask  the man for the money, and yet I must have it. When he lent me the &pound;500 the  other day, he told me plainly enough that he wouldn't lend me any more if I  gambled, and he's the sort of man who'll stick to his word if he once makes up his  mind. What a donkey I was to quarrel with Gertrude. She would have pulled me  through.&quot;</p>
  <p>These  reflections were passing through his mind as he stood at one of the club  windows with his hands deep in his pockets. There was a troubled look in his  eyes, the look of a man who is at his wit's end for expedients, and he bit his  lip with nervous irritability as no solution to the difficulty presented  itself,</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wonder whether old Naumann would stand me for a few hundred,&quot; he  reflected. &quot;It's just possible that he mayn't have heard that our house is  mortgaged.&quot;</p>
  <p>But  &quot;old Naumann&quot; would not &quot;stand him&quot; him for a penny, and  the old money-lender told him so in the plainest of terms&mdash;terms so plain, in  fact, that they extracted a very vigorous expression of opinion from Cyril as  to the old man's nationality and antecedents.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  may be a blood-sucker and a d&mdash;d Jew,&quot; roared the old man as Cyril flung  himself out of the office, &quot;but I don't make my living out of cards and  betting, and I don't use my wife as a means&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Luckily  Cyril was out of earshot before the last sentence was commenced, and I for my  part shall leave it incomplete.</p>
  <p>With  his spirits at the lowest ebb, feeling discomfited and worried almost beyond  endurance, Cyril made his way back to the club. But even there a fresh  annoyance met him. He had hardly set foot inside the door before he was  accosted by one of his creditors.</p>
  <p>&quot;Good  morning, Paton! You're the very man I want to see. Can you spare a few minutes!  I want to speak to you.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  speaker, Captain Petrie, was a man of about thirty, good-looking, well-set up,  and carefully dressed. He spoke in rather an affected tone, and when he smiled  it seemed with a view to show his teeth, which were unusually white and even,  rather than as a sign of amusement.</p>
  <p>With  an inward curse Cyril acceded to the request, and the two young men went into a  corner of the hall, where for a few minutes they were engaged in earnest  conversation. There is no necessity to give at length what passed between them.  Captain Petrie had won a large sum from Cyril and he wanted to be paid. It was in  vain that Cyril  pleaded for time, and promised an early settlement. Captain Petrie was  inexorable. He had lost heavily himself. He had had to pay, though it was  inconvenient Cyril must do the same.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  really don't understand such a thing,&quot; exclaimed the captain with virtuous  indignation. &quot;When you win you pocket the money. When you lose&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  made an angry gesture.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  will do,&quot; he exclaimed angrily. &quot;You shall be paid, and today too.&quot;</p>
  <p>To  this Captain Petrie returned that that was all he wanted, and turning on his  heel left Cyril to digest the several unpleasant truths he had told him.</p>
  <p>I suppose  that I shall hardly be believed when I state that Cyril considered that he had  been very badly treated, and looked upon his case as a very hard one indeed.  But that was the view that he took of his position. The question of the morality  of contracting debts that he could not pay never entered into his head. He  himself was a lenient creditor, and he thought it &quot;devilish rough on a  fellow&quot; to be pestered for payment when payment was inconvenient</p>
  <p>&quot;However,  something must be done,&quot; he said, as he passed through the hall into the  street, &quot;if I have to pawn my&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>At  that moment a thought flashed on his brain, and he stood still at the idea. His  house was mortgaged to its last value. He had given a bill of sale over his  furniture only a week before. In fact, he had exhausted all ordinary channels  of credit. But the word &quot;pawn,&quot; which he had used carelessly enough,  suggested a new source of assistance, and as he used it the thought of his  wife's diamond necklace flashed on him with a fearful joy.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  can I get them? She would never lend them to me for such a purpose. She's too  devilish selfish!&quot; reflected this most selfish of men. &quot;And what  excuse could she make to Adam Dyke?&quot;</p>
  <p>At  that moment a hand was laid on his shoulder. If he had already committed the  mean theft that was in his mind he could not have been more disconcerted. He  started and turned as pale as if his thoughts had been detected.</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,  what's the matter?&quot; asked Adam Dyke, with no little concern. &quot;Come  into my place and sit down for a bit.&quot;</p>
  <p>To  this Cyril made no reply. He had never been inside Adam's house. Oliver lived  there, and for good reasons he had no desire to come across him. His hesitation  was immediately divined by Adam.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver  is away!&quot; said the latter. &quot;He's in Sydney, and won't be back for a  month.&quot;</p>
  <p>They  went into the house, where Cyril was soon himself again, thanks to an unusually  stiff glass of whisky-and-water, which Adam insisted on his drinking almost as  a draught.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  will pull you together,&quot; he said kindly. &quot;Now sit down there and have  a smoke or a read, or a snooze if you like, but&mdash;keep quiet. I tell you that you  did look bad. You couldn't have looked worse if you had suddenly discovered  some horrible crime or seen a ghost. Now, you stop quiet while I do some writing,&quot;  continued Adam, as he sat down to a writing-table and took a cheque-book from  one of the drawers, &quot;I've got a nice lot of bills to pay, and want to get  them off my mind.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  writing-table was in a bow-window, and from where Cyril sat he had an  undisturbed view of Adam, who was between him and the light. And as he looked  at him his old feeling of contempt revived in him with greater strength than  ever.</p>
  <p>&quot;To  think of that fellow having the command of such money,&quot; he reflected, as  he looked at Adam's bent figure. &quot;Of course, he's good-hearted and  liberal, and all that, but so abominably commonplace, not only in mind but even  in person.&quot;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Adam was hard at work over his accounts. As he wrote a cheque he pinned it to  the account it was in payment of, and placed it under a paper-weight.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  Thank Heaven! I've finished,&quot; he at last exclaimed with a sigh of relief.  &quot;I do hate writing. I suppose that that's because I'm not a very good hand  at it. Now look at the difference between those signatures,&quot; he added, as  he handed Cyril two cheques for comparison. &quot;I often wonder that they  don't refer to me before honouring them.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  took them, and did as Adam asked, acknowledging that there was great dissimilarity.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  that's nothing!&quot; exclaimed Adam with a laugh. &quot;You should see some of  them when I've a pen that I don't like! My signature might be anything but Adam  Dyke.&quot;</p>
  <p>At  this moment the servant brought in a note.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  say, Cyril, will you excuse me?&quot; he said, as he read it &quot;Mr. Barron  wants to see me particularly. You'll wait for me, won't you, like a good  fellow? I shan't be gone long. We'll lunch together. Here's the paper to amuse  yourself with.&quot;</p>
  <p>For  a few minutes after Adam had left the house Cyril sat there without moving. A  dastardly crime was hatching in his brain&mdash;a crime which even he, desperate and  unscrupulous as he was, dared hardly contemplate. But with men like Cyril but  little time elapses between the evolution of an idea and its performance. Time  was of moment. Adam might be back at any instant. With one hasty glance round  the room, and another at the windows at the opposite side of the street, Cyril  sat down at the writing-table, and with eager fingers tore a cheque from the  end of the book. The body he filled up hastily in a feigned hand for &pound;725, and  then, taking one of the cheques from under the paper-weight, he proceeded to  imitate the signature as closely as he could. Adam always put a stop at the end  of his name, and Cyril was just about to add this when a servant came into the  room. With a muttered oath Cyril hastily blotted the cheque and put it into his  pocket</p>
  <p>&quot;I  can add the stop at the club,&quot; he reflected, as he heard Adam's footstep  in the hall.</p>
  <p>About  five o'clock that afternoon, as Adam was sitting in his study, the servant came  in and told him that there was a gentleman wished to see him. When the visitor  came in Adam at once recognised one of the clerks at the South Sea Bank.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  Mr. Howard, what is it?&quot; he asked.</p>
  <p>There  was an air of mystery about the young man that excited Adam's curiosity. He  looked about the room as if to make certain that they were alone.</p>
  <p>&quot;H'm!  I've come on somewhat important business,&quot; answered Mr. Howard, as he took  a paper from a leather case, which he held in his hand. &quot;Have you drawn  any large cheques to-day, Mr. Dyke?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  thought a moment, &quot;I have drawn a number of cheques to-day,&quot; he  answered, &quot;but none for any large amount. I think there was one of &pound;40  odd&mdash;that, certainly, was the largest.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  haven't drawn one for &pound;725!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Seven  hundred and twenty-five!&quot; echoed Adam, in surprise. &quot;No, certainly  not.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  it's as I thought,&quot; exclaimed the young man in a tone which betrayed his  satisfaction at the verification of his prediction. &quot;An impudent forgery  has been committed. Look at that cheque, sir,&quot; he said, handing Adam the  paper as he spoke. &quot;Is that your signature?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  took the cheque and carefully looked at it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Upon  my soul, if I wasn't certain that I hadn't written a cheque for the amount I  should say it was,&quot; he said with a puzzled look on his face. &quot;I can see no  difference between the signature and the ordinary one I use.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I'm glad to hear you say so for the sake of the clerk who cashed it,&quot; said  Mr. Howard; &quot;but there are some points of dissimilarity. Now you always  put a stop after your name. There's no stop here. Then you invariably make a  loop at the top of the down stroke of the A. You will observe that that is  absent&quot;</p>
  <p>Again  did Adam look at it, and the puzzled look on his face was more marked than  ever.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-12-b.png" width="413" height="600"></p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  Let us look at my cheque-book,'' he said.</p>
  <p>An  inspection of the cheque-book betrayed the fact that a blank cheque had been  extracted from the end of the book, the number of which coincided with the  forged cheque. Adam then, with the assistance of Mr. Howard, compared the  cheque with those that he had written that morning. The signatures were in Adam's  eyes identical.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  There's no time to be lost,&quot; said Mr. Howard, as he carefully placed the  cheque back in the case. &quot;We have a clue to the man who cashed it, and I  have no doubt that we shall run the scoundrel to earth. In the meantime, Mr.  Dyke, just turn the matter over in your mind, try and think who has been in  here lately&mdash;who would have access to your papers, and so forth.&quot;</p>
  <p>For  ten minutes after the clerk's departure Adam sat at his writing-table puzzling  his brains over the matter. He looked at the cheques he had written, he looked  at the cheque-book, and then from the cheque-book he looked back at the  cheques, but no glimmer of the truth did they convey. But when he made a  discovery that the forged cheque had been blotted on an unused sheet of  blotting-paper, and had evidently been blotted that day, a horrible suspicion  flashed on his mind, and drove all the blood to his heart.</p>
  <p>&quot;Great  Heavens!&quot; he cried aloud; &quot;if it should be. Why, it would break her  heart.&quot;</p>
  <p>He was  so appalled at the very idea that for a few minutes he sat there incapable of  thought or action. Then, with a cry of dismay, he dashed into the hall and  seized his hat. The next minute he was driving to the bank as fast as an extra  fare could induce the cabman to drive. He rushed into the bank just in time to  catch Mr. Barton, the manager, who was going home.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  want you a moment,&quot; he cried, catching him by the arm. &quot;A clerk of  yours came to me with a cheque&mdash;a cheque supposed to be forged.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Supposed  to be! It was forged. Mr. Howard informs me that you distinctly said so.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam's  face had been pale, but now a bright flush lit up his cheeks.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  made a mistake,&quot; he faltered. &quot;The cheque is all right. Debit my account  with it.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was the manager's turn to exhibit astonishment. He had trained himself for  many, many years to subordinate his feelings to his banking duties; but if he  had been given all the monies in the bank coffers he could not have withheld  his amazement.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  cheque all right! The devil it is!&quot; he cried, and he looked as if he  expected him to eat his words.</p>
  <p>But  Adam stood there with downcast eyes, and made no farther remark.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  it's your business,&quot; said Mr. Barton, shrugging his shoulders, &quot;but  it seems to me that a person couldn't write a cheque for such an amount and be  ignorant of the fact. Your instructions are to honour it in the usual way? You  recognise it as yours?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  nodded his head, but still did not raise his eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Very  well,&quot; answered Mr. Barton, pursing his lips, &quot;It shall be done.&quot;  As he spoke he began to put on his gloves, and Adam, thinking the interview at  an end, mumbled some words of farewell, and prepared to take his departure.</p>
  <p>&quot;Stay  a minute,&quot; said Mr. Barton, &quot;I should like to speak to you for a few  minutes, Mr. Dyke. Come into the office.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  followed him into his room, and, in obedience to his invitation took a chair.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  I hope that you won't take what I'm going to say in bad part,&quot; said Mr.  Barton, with a serious look in his keen grey eves. &quot;I have my own ideas of  the duties of a bank manager to his customers. I don't consider that I'm placed  here merely to do what is suggested by my customers. I consider that I have a  very strong duty towards them to discharge, whether that duty be claimed or  not. Thus if I see a customer doing wrong&mdash;I mean going on the wrong track&mdash;I  feel it incumbent on me to speak to him. Mr. Dyke, I think that you are lately  going on the wrong track&mdash;I mean in money matters, of course,&quot; he hastened  to add.</p>
  <p>Adam  looked up, but did not speak.</p>
  <p>&quot;Of  course you are still enormously rich,&quot; continued the old man, &quot;and  you can stand many losses&mdash;infinitely greater losses&mdash;than you have lately  sustained, but I would beg of you, my dear sir, to be more&mdash;more careful. Your  carelessness breeds carelessness in others, and you are associated&mdash;excuse my  plain speaking&mdash;you are associated with the man of all others who is likely to  take advantage of your failings.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  old man spoke with a warmth that betrayed his earnestness, and he laid his hand  on Adam's shoulder as he spoke, and looked into his face.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  mean Mr. Barron.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  do,&quot; answered Mr. Barton. &quot;Beware of that man. Not only is he over-sanguine&mdash;itself  a serious drawback in a business man&mdash;but he isn't, I'm sorry to have to say it,  he isn't a man to be trusted overmuch.&quot;</p>
  <p>And  somehow Adam could find no words to defend his friend.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton drew on his gloves, and prepared to take leave. But suddenly a thought  occurred to him, and he turned back again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Perhaps  you would like to give another cheque for this,&quot; he said as he handed it  to Adam, and at the same time he rang the bell and told a clerk to bring a  blank cheque.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  is a forgery!&quot; he said to himself, &quot;and David Barron is the  forger.&quot;</p>
  <p>Thus  for the second time did Adam Dyke, a truthful, honest, and straight-forward  man, lie&mdash;I will use no other word&mdash;to save as good-for-nothing a scamp as ever  disgraced the face of God's earth.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk14"></a>Chapter  XIV.<br>
IN WHICH CYRIL LOSES HIS TEMPER MORE THAN ONCE.</h2>
  <p>As  I have remarked before, when a man who has been notoriously in difficulties  defrays his liabilities speculation as to the source of his new-gotten wealth  is sure to be set going. But though Captain Petrie and Mr. Grainger and others  of Cyril's creditors considered the subject exhaustively they did not arrive at  any reasonable conclusion.</p>
  <p>&quot;After  all,&quot; said Captain Petrie philosophically, as he pocketed the crisp notes  with no little satisfaction, &quot;it doesn't matter where it comes from so  long as it comes,&quot; an argument to which his hearers readily assented. Nor  do I think it improbable that they would have accepted the money had they  suspected the means by which it was acquired. Gambling begets a lax code of  morality, and its votaries wink at actions which the world would brand with  very hard names indeed.</p>
  <p>So  pleased were Cyril's creditors with their unexpected good fortune that they  invited him to dinner, and two or three magnums of &quot;Pommery, tr&egrave;s sec.,  '74,&quot; served to clear away the last traces of any awkwardness engendered  by their recent relations. With Cyril's money in their pockets his creditors  were quite willing to forget that it had been a long time reaching them, and by  the time the coffee was served, if they thought of the matter at all, they  probably considered that Cyril Paton had not been treated as well as he might  have been.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  old chap!&quot; said Mr. Grainger to one of the company as they went into the  billiard-room after dinner; &quot;he has had a very rough deal, and I'm  devilish glad that he has been able to come up to time. Did you notice how  excited he was at the commencement of dinner?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  other nodded</p>
  <p>&quot;The  poor beggar felt awkward, I'm sure he did. Look at him now, how flushed his face  is, and how bright his eyes are.&quot;</p>
  <p>In  truth there was an unusual colour in Cyril's face&mdash;an unusual light in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Come  on. Let us have a game of pool,&quot; he cried, as he selected a cue from the  rack. &quot;Five pounds I divide against you, Grainger.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Right  you are,&quot; assented the latter.</p>
  <p>&quot;Five  pounds with you, Petrie.&quot;</p>
  <p>This  wager was also accepted.</p>
  <p>The  balls were dealt out. Cyril had the red ball, and was thus the first to play.  As he stooped down to make his stroke a voice accosted him&mdash;the voice of all others  that he most dreaded to hear.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you haven't started playing, Paton,&quot; said Adam Dyke, for it was he, &quot;I  should like to speak to you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  that be hanged, Dyke,&quot; interjected Captain Petrie. &quot;Wait until the  game is over. I've a fiver on with him, and I feel in good form.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Come  in yourself,&quot; cried another of the party. &quot;Take the last ball.&quot;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Cyril had stood up again. He could not look Adam Dyke in the face, nor could he  answer him. The colour, but a moment before so pronounced, had died out of his  face, and his eyes seemed to have sunk into his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  very sorry to interrupt the game, gentlemen,&quot; said Adam nervously, &quot;but  I want to speak to Mr. Paton about something very&mdash;very particular indeed. If  you could spare him I&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  placed his cue on the table.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  come with you,&quot; he said in a low voice, and turning to the players he told  them he would be back shortly.</p>
  <p>Down  the stairs, out into the street, and then into Adam's house the two went, and  neither spoke a word. It was only when they were in the room where they had had  the interview of the morning that Cyril summoned up courage to ask Adam why he  had been brought there.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sit  down,&quot; said Adam, in a low voice, &quot;and I will tell you why.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke he sat down himself. Not only was his expression most grave, but there  was a look of pain in his eyes, which did not escape Cyril's stealthy glances.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have asked you to come here as an old friend,&quot; said Adam seriously, &quot;I  want to tell you something that has happened to-day&mdash;something that has given me  more pain than anything, one thing only excepted, that ever befel me.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  paused, and cast a nervous glance at Cyril, whose eyes immediately fell.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  was writing cheques here to-day, and very carelessly left my cheque book lying  on the table. In my absence some one took a cheque from the book, filled it in  for a large amount, and&mdash;and signed my name to it. The cheque was cashed.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  paused, but did not look at Cyril. Had he done so any lingering doubt that he  might have had as to the latter's guilt must have been obliterated. Cyril's  face was livid, and he grasped the arms of the armchair on which he was sitting  with such convulsive force that he left the mark of each separate nail on the  morocco.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  the cheque was cashed,&quot; continued Adam, taking out his knife and cutting  some tobacco; &quot;but after it was cashed a doubt arose as to the genuineness  of the signature. It was brought to me, and so well had it been for&mdash;imitated,  that I myself was at first deceived. However, I hadn't written a cheque for such  an amount, and I&mdash;I told the clerk so. He left here under the impression that it  was a forgery&mdash;(as Adam used the word a bright colour came into his cheeks)&mdash;and  with the intention of running the criminal to earth.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  Paton fell back in his chair, his eyes starting from his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  they suspect any&mdash;anybody?&quot; he gasped. .</p>
  <p>&quot;They  did suspect someone,&quot; resumed Adam, as he ground the grains of tobacco  between his great palms; &quot;or rather they had a clue to&mdash;to the forger. I say  they did suspect someone. They may suspect someone still; but if so their  suspicions will never be verified.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  gave a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  so?&quot; he faltered.</p>
  <p>Adam  did not answer, but, getting up from his chair, he took the blotting paper in  his hand, and opening it at the page where the cheque had been blotted held it  out to Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;After  the clerk had gone I found this,&quot; he said, &quot;and then I knew that the forgery  had been committed here. I went to the bank, acknowledged the cheque as my own,  and, to avoid any farther investigation, gave another for it. Here it is,&quot;  he said, holding it up. </p>
  <p>For  a moment an insane idea seized Cyril, of snatching it from Adam's hand and  throwing it into the fire, which was burning brightly. Had he done so it would  only have anticipated Adam's action. Stooping down to the fire Adam put the  cheque between the bars, and the next moment it was in flames.</p>
  <p>&quot;There  dies the last record of a foolish deed,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p>Cyril  started to his feet, and seized Adam by the hand. There were tears in his  eyes&mdash;genuine tears of gratitude.</p>
  <p>&quot;You're  a good fellow!&quot; he cried with warmth, &quot;the best that I ever met.</p>
  <p>Adam  shrank back. Had Cyril acknowledged his guilt he would have forgiven him  freely, but his want of candour turned his pity into a feeling of repulsion.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  only done what anyone would do in my place,&quot; he said coldly. &quot;I had  others to consider besides,&quot; he was on the point of saying  &quot;you,&quot; but substituted &quot;the forger.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  the last word passed his lips their eyes met. If Adam wished revenge he had it  that moment. There was a look in Cyril's eyes which no man worthy of the name  cares to see in another's eyes, the craven look of the coward who dares not  face the position he himself has created. Adam turned from him in undisguised  disgust.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  needn't keep you any longer from your game,&quot; he said in no friendly tone.</p>
  <p>For  a moment Cyril stood undecided. He wanted to go, but he had a favour to ask,  and that was an opportunity which might not present itself again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr.  Dyke,&quot; he said eagerly, his voice sounding strangely hoarse as he spoke&mdash;so  strangely hoarse that Adam turned to him with no little surprise. &quot;You  won't say a word about this, will you?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  to the Barrons, or&mdash;or Oliver.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  will not.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Nor&mdash;nor  to Gertrude.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Nor  to Gertrude,&quot; repeated Adam. It was the first time that he had called her  by her Christian name to her husband, and a bright colour came to his anxious  face as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thanks!&quot;  said Cyril with a sigh of relief, and then holding out his hand he wished Adam  &quot;Good night.&quot;</p>
  <p>Whether  Adam saw his hand or not I cannot say, but he merely said good night, and  sitting down by the fire took up a newspaper from a table near and proceeded to  read it, or pretended to do so. His action was not lost on Cyril, and was  thoroughly understood, as Cyril's flaming cheeks amply testified. But when a  man has gone as far as Cyril on the downward path it does not cost him much to  take one step lower. He stepped to Adam's side and again held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Shake  hands,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p>The  words were spoken in a cowardly, whining whisper that Adam, slow as he was in  reading character as a rule, understood at once.</p>
  <p>&quot;Very  well,&quot; he said carelessly, and he took Cyril's proffered hand, but there  was no cordiality in the grip.</p>
  <p>Cyril  muttered a word or two of thanks, and then, feeling meaner&mdash;ay, and looking  meaner than he had ever felt or looked before, he left the room. When he  reached the street he gave a whistle, and a smile of wondrous significance  curled his thin lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  deuced lucky for me that I'd got such a soft fellow to deal with.&quot; By  &quot;soft&quot; he probably meant &quot;stupid.&quot; &quot;And it's just as  well that he can stand the loss,&quot; he added selfishly, as he jingled some  sovereigns in his pocket. &quot;There's one thing certain, and that is that  Gertrude can get anything she likes out of him.&quot;</p>
  <p>Five  minutes afterwards he resumed his game of pool, offering to bet more heavily  than before, and grumbling because he could not get bets of sufficient amount  on the game. But whether it was that the other players were too good for him or  that the interview had upset him he played but indifferently, missing easy  shots, and leaving his ball invariably in a dangerous position. Then he fell to  cursing his luck, and from that to abusing the players.</p>
  <p>&quot;You've  won about thirty pounds from me,&quot; he said angrily to Grainger, &quot;and  now you'll only bet me a fiver. You might give me a chance to get even.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you ever give anyone a chance?&quot; asked Grainger, with emphasis.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  I do! I've often given you a chance,&quot; returned Cyril violently. &quot;But  when you've got a fellow's money, a nice chance he has of winning it back.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Grainger had a temper and a tongue. His temper had been sorely tried that  night, and as yet he had remained silent. But endurance has its limits, and  Cyril's last remark, perhaps because it went home, exhausted Mr. Grainger's  patience.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you can't lose without crying over it you oughtn't to play at all,&quot; he  exclaimed angrily. &quot;A man who makes his money as easily as you do! Bah!  I'm disgusted.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril's  face turned livid, he caught hold of the cue with the evident intention of striking  the speaker, and would infallibly have done so had not Captain Petrie caught  hold of his arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  will do!&quot; the latter exclaimed, as he motioned to Grainger to leave the  room. &quot;Don't let us have a row.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  meanwhile was struggling to free himself. &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; he cried.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not a bit of it,&quot; said the captain, resolutely, &quot;unless you promise  to behave yourself. Here Grainger!&quot; he said to the latter, who was still  standing near, undecided what to do, &quot;give him your hand.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Grainger expressed his readiness to be friends, saying that he could not  understand how anything that he had said should have given such offence. After  a few phrases of regret on both sides the young men shook hands, and champagne  was ordered in with a view to removing the last traces of unpleasantness.</p>
  <p>But  champagne was powerless to dissipate a certain nameless dread which had seized  on Cyril. With a few hasty words of farewell he left the club, and jumping into  a hansom told the cabman to drive him home.</p>
  <p>&quot;Could  Grainger have suspected the truth?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;No, that's  impossible!&quot; and the reflection gave him no little relief. &quot;Great  Heaven! what I've gone through to-day! And,&quot; he added bitterly, &quot;I  might have been saved it all if Gertrude had only lent me a hand.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  was sitting up reading. When Cyril entered she closed her book.</p>
  <p>&quot;You're  very early,&quot; she said, as she looked up at the timepiece, &quot;and I'm  glad you are, for I want to speak to you about something important.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  threw himself into an armchair.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  is it?&quot; he asked, bad-temperedly. &quot;If it's anything particularly  unpleasant leave it till the morning. I've had enough worry to-day to last me a  week.&quot;</p>
  <p>An  unmistakable sneer curled Gertrude's lip. Had her news been of the most  unpleasant nature she would not have spared Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I suppose that you have yourself to blame,&quot; she said, unfeelingly,  &quot;and as I don't share your pleasures I might be excused the relation of  your misfortunes.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cyril  started up.</p>
  <p>&quot;Have  you anything to say, or not?&quot; he asked angrily.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have, if you'll listen quietly,&quot; answered Gertrude, not in the least  disconcerted.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  go on, for Heaven's sake!&quot; exclaimed Cyril.</p>
  <p>&quot;Last  night I told you that Adam Dyke had made me a present of that necklace,&quot; said  Gertrude.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  did.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  meant to tell you something more, and should have done so if you had kept your  temper.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  well! What is it?&quot; asked Cyril, impatiently.</p>
  <p>&quot;He  not only gave me the necklace. He made me a present of Tarcoota, his principal  Queensland station, and I&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>The  words died on her lips, for Cyril, with a shriek, rushed at her and caught her  roughly by the arms. His eyes were starting from his head, and beads of  perspiration stood out on his brow.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wish you were dead!&quot; he cried, with a terrible oath.</p>

  <h2><a name="sk15"></a>Chapter  XV.<br>
MRS. DALE VOWS VENGEANCE.</h2>
  <p>Mr.  John Barton enjoyed a high reputation as a banker, was a shrewd man of  business, was careful where care needed, but could at times take risks which  bankers of less grasp of mind would shrink from. In Mr. John Barton's eyes  banking (he spelt it with a large B) was a science that but few are permitted  to thoroughly master. He did not believe that it could be learnt from the most  exhaustive treatises on finance, nor would he admit that the most extensive practice  could make perfect. He maintained that a banker must, so to speak, be born to  the business, and that he must have certain natural gifts, without which  pre-eminence would be hopeless. Of these gifts he held a good judgment of  character to be indispensable, and he prided himself, and with no little  justice, on his own ability in that line. &quot;Give me 10 minutes' conversation  with a man, and I'll tell you what he is,&quot; was a favourite boast of Mr. Barton's  and those who knew him well averred that his assertion was amply justified by results.  But Mr. Barton went farther than this. He held that a banker should go into  society, and should himself entertain as far as his means permitted. &quot;I've  saved many a bad debt by dining out,&quot; he once said. &quot;A careless  expression or two after the second glass of port has more than once cost a  customer his credit. Besides, if you see a man entertaining expensively when he  is giving you 10 per cent for money, you may be sure that the time has arrived  for putting the screw on.&quot; Thus Mr. Barton combined business with  pleasure, and whilst he went to every ball, and dinner party, aye! and race  meeting, which he could conveniently attend, he kept his eyes very wide-opened  indeed.</p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke's relations with the Barrons and the Patons had long been an interesting  study of Mr. Barton's, but whereas at first it had been merely an object of  amusement to him, it&mdash;this was about a year after the event related in the last  chapter&mdash;it had gradually developed into a much more serious matter. The  speculations of the firm of &quot;David Barron and Company&quot; had now  assumed such large dimensions that Mr. Barton had found it necessary, to use his  own phrase, &quot;to put on the brake.&quot; Adam Dyke had been &quot;good  enough&quot; a year before, but what with his gift of Tarcoota, his enormous  private expenditure, and three bad seasons running on two of his stations, Mr.  Barton thought it prudent to place a limit on his credit. He felt the less  compunction in doing this, inasmuch as he cordially detested Mr. Barron. He had  always disliked and distrusted him, but after the affair of the cheque&mdash;with the  forgery of which he (wrongly as we know) credited Mr. Barron&mdash;he utterly loathed  the sight of him. For Adam Dyke he had a very different feeling. Though Adam's  carelessness and unsuspicious faith occasionally roused his contempt, he could not  help being attracted by the nobleness of his general character. No one called  Adam harder names, but there was no one, even Oliver Barron included, who was  more keenly alive to Adam's interest than the grey-haired manager of the South  Sea Bank.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton had seen from the first that as long as Gertrude exercised her sway it  would be impossible to save Adam, and his heart fell as he recognised the fact;  but after a while his spirits rose somewhat. He fancied that he saw signs of a  coming estrangement, and he argued, and I fancy rightly, that if Gertrude and  Adam were again parted it would be for the last time. This thought was very  prominently brought before him one day that he was having a conversation with  Mrs. Dale, whose friendship he assiduously cultivated as a gossip of the first  rank.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Barton,&quot; said Mrs. Dale mysteriously behind  her fan to the attentive old banker. &quot;The Patons are getting a little sick  of their ex-millionaire.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  old man smiled pleasantly, showing a broad expanse of false teeth as he did so,  and raised his eyebrows.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ex-millionaire!  Surely Mr. Dyke is enormously rich still?&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale lightly rapped the old man across the knuckles with her fan.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  discreet we are,&quot; she laughed, &quot;when a customer's position is in  question. You know as well as I do that Tarcoota was worth any three of Mr.  Dyke's other stations, and that he has had disastrous seasons for years.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  he is enormously rich,&quot; repeated Mr. Barton.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  so have others been before him,&quot; snapped out Mrs. Dale, whose husband had  once been reputed (it never went beyond repute), reputed a rich man.  &quot;Believe me that we shall see that man come to grief, and before long too.  I hear that 18 months ago old David Barron got him to go into a large sugar  plantation in Queensland, and if that doesn't finish him up,&quot; she  exclaimed, with the warmth of a prophet, &quot;I'm a Dutchwoman.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton made no comment, but, pursing his lips, seemed plunged in thought.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you think he'll ever get over his infatuation for Mrs. Paton?&quot; he asked at  length,</p>
  <p>&quot;Get  over it, never!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Dale. &quot;He's wrapped up in her. If she  were to turn black he would never see it. No, he'll never get over it, but&mdash;she  will.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton suddenly displayed a lively interest. &quot;Indeed!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;How's that?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  to begin with, she never cared for him&mdash;never really cared for him. She had  treated him very badly, and she felt ashamed. When an opportunity arose for  their reconciliation she was glad of it, and for a time liked his naive  admiration. I needn't say that his money made both husband and wife view with a  lenient eye his deficiencies, and if he hadn't been an egregious donkey he  would never have deprived himself of his strongest weapon. The day that he gave  her Tarcoota he left himself at her mercy.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton nodded.</p>
  <p>&quot;By  Heaven! You're right!&quot; he said.</p>
  <p>&quot;Of  course I am,&quot; proceeded Mrs. Dale volubly, and not ill-pleased at the  compliment. &quot;Immediately that they were independent of him they began, or  rather she began, to get tired of him. In common decency she couldn't get rid  of him altogether. She dropped him by degrees&mdash;no, that's not exactly what I  mean either&mdash;she accustomed him to see less of her, and now, if what I hear is  true, he only goes out there once a week, if so often, and is absolutely never  seen with her alone, as he used to be six months ago.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton again nodded. His habitual caution restrained him from making any  comment.</p>
  <p>&quot;You'll  be glad to hear this too,&quot; said Mrs. Dale, growing more enthusiastic as  her gossip met with such favour. &quot;Captain Petrie and Mrs. Paton are having  a violent flirtation, at least the world calls it a flirtation, but I think  that term too charitable&mdash;and Mr. Dyke's attention will, consequently, be more  unwelcome than ever. I fully expect that he will receive his marching orders  before many months are over.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton looked at Mrs. Dale without speaking, and as he looked at her debated  the advisability of disclosing a scheme which just then had suggested itself to  him. I have said that though habitually a careful man, he would at times take  risks that other men would shrink from. This was one of them.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  you think that this separation might be precipitated,&quot; he asked. &quot;If  Mr. Dyke was acquainted with the fact that this man Petrie&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;If  he was acquainted!&quot; interrupted Mrs. Dale, contemptuously. &quot;Don't I  tell you that no evidence on earth would induce him to believe a word against  her. No; that would never do. But there is a way of influencing him, and I more  than once have felt inclined to use it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot;  interjected Mr. Barton, with apparent indifference. &quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Adam  Dyke, for all that he's an arrant donkey, is&mdash;apart from his connection with  this woman&mdash;a keenly sensitive, honourable man. If he thought that he was  injuring Gertrude by his attentions (such a thought has never entered his head,  you may be sure), he would give her up though it broke his heart.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton nodded an assent.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  if I said so, or you, or in fact any ordinary person, we might talk till we  were black in the face and never convince him. But there is one person who  might speak to him, who would speak to him if he was properly approached, and  if he did speak success would be assured.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And  who is that?&quot; asked Mr. Barton, whose opinion of Mrs. Dale's ability was  growing apace.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver  Barron,&quot; answered Mrs. Dale, conscious of the effect she was producing.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver  Barron!&quot; repeated Mr. Barton in amazement.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes;  Oliver Barron,&quot; resumed Mrs. Dale. &quot;I assure you that he's quite  innocent of the relations which are supposed to have existed between his sister  and Mr. Dyke. Ever since his sister's marriage he has lived the most retired  life, and would be the last person to hear of such a thing. You may be perfectly  sure that if he had heard of it he wouldn't have lived with Adam Dyke a single  day.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  how could he be convinced,&quot; asked Mr. Barton, &quot;and who would be bold  enough to attempt it?&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale smiled mysteriously.</p>
  <p>&quot;He  could be convinced easily enough,&quot; she said, &quot;and for two pins I'd  set about the job myself.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton looked at her carefully. He had felt all along that temper was at the  bottom of Mrs. Dale's interest in Mrs. Paton's misdemeanours, and now  determined to test the question.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  don't appear to like Mrs. Paton,&quot; he laughed. Mrs. Dale's brow grew black as night.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  hate her!&quot; she said with emphasis, &quot;and I'd go a long way out of my  road to do her a bad turn. I've evidence of her guilt that she little knows  of,&quot; she added with warmth, &quot;and if she isn't careful I'll bring her  house about her ears.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton in vain endeavoured to find out to what it referred, but Mrs. Dale, who  had disclosed rather more than she had wished to do, suddenly became silent,  and the conversation dropped.</p>
  <p>Now  it so happened that that very evening Mrs. Dale was cut dead by the lady she had  so freely criticised, and she was on Mr. Barton's arm when the event occurred.</p>
  <p>&quot;Did  you see that woman cut me?&quot; she asked, trembling with rage.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barton, with a pardonable want of truth, said that he had not observed it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Before  to-morrow night she'll repent it,&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Dale with flashing eyes.</p>
  <p>On  which Mr. Barton, though his face did not disclose that he was affected one way  or the other, enjoyed an internal and very satisfactory chuckle.</p>
  <p>&quot;Was  anything ever more opportune?&quot; he said to himself.</p>
  <p>Gertrude,  who was on Captain Petrie's arm, broke into a merry laugh when she was at a  safe distance, in which she was joined by her partner.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  long meant to cut that odious woman,&quot; she said, &quot;but I suppose it would  have been wiser to remain on the old footing. She's an old Gorgon.&quot;</p>
  <p>Captain  Petrie laughed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Gorgon,  eh! Rather Gorgonzola. Don't you see,&quot; he added in answer to a query in  Gertrude's eyes. &quot;A Gorgon is a monster, and Zola is a manufacturer of  horrors. What happier name could there be for her?&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk16"></a>Chapter  XVI.<br>
Oliver's advice, and what came of it.</h2>
  <p>&quot;Was  that you coughing in the night?&quot; asked Oliver, as he looked at his friend  across the breakfast table the morning after the event just described.</p>
  <p>Adam  nodded.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes!  I've got a nasty cold,&quot; he said, &quot;and I can't shake it off. I'm glad now  that I didn't go to the Drisberghs' last night.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  should think you were,&quot; exclaimed Oliver. &quot;You'd have been out of  your mind to go with such a cough as you're got, and on such a cold night too.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  should like to have gone, though,&quot; said Adam, in a tone of regret.</p>
  <p>Oliver  cast a searching glance at his friend, and his expression, from being one of  inquiry, became one of pity.</p>
  <p>&quot;Adam,  my dear old fellow,&quot; he said with no little feeling, &quot;I wish to  Heaven that you would leave Melbourne, cut all your&mdash;your connections, business  or otherwise, go and look after your stations or go home, or, or do <i>anything</i> but what you're doing. Here you  are worrying yourself to a shadow, and&mdash;and what can it all result in? I don't  know much of your life outside this house, I have never asked you any questions  about it, and I&mdash;I don't want to know it. But I should be blind, indeed,&quot;  he exclaimed, with no little warmth, &quot;if I didn't see that something is  going wrong, and I ask you, old man, as an old and&mdash;and well-meaning  friend,&quot; he walked round to Adam's side, and placing his hand on his shoulder,  leant over him as he spoke, &quot;to cut the whole concern.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  took Oliver's hand and shook it warmly.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  can't be done,&quot; he said, sadly, shaking his head. &quot;I must remain  here.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  made a movement of angry impatience.</p>
  <p>&quot;Must  remain!&quot; he cried, contemptuously. &quot;Rubbish! It might be a wrench to  go away, but time does wonders.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  just now I'm too much involved in business matters to think about it,&quot; he  said, speaking with no little hesitation, &quot;and I&mdash;I <i>couldn't</i> go if I wished it ever so much.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver's  face flushed.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  begged of you a year ago, ay! more than that, not to go any deeper in the  governor's business, but you wouldn't listen to me,&quot; he said, bitterly.  &quot;I had a presentiment nothing good could come of it, and nothing good has  come of it or will come of it. Even now it isn't too late. Draw your money out  of the business at any sacrifice. If you make a loss put up with it&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  afraid it has gone too far,&quot; said Adam. &quot;If I took my money out it  would ruin your father, and I would rather face ruin myself than injure him. No!  I won't desert a sinking ship.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  had long had a suspicion that Adam's position had greatly changed, but there  was something in his tone and look that moment that implied a possibility which  Oliver had never contemplated.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  don't mean to say that your ruin is possible,&quot; he asked, anxiously, with a  white face.</p>
  <p>&quot;We  have made enormous losses,&quot; answered Adam, quietly, &quot;and have to face  further ones still.&quot;</p>
  <p>For  the moment Oliver looked at him as if he didn't understand him. He had been so  used to considering Adam's wealth as something abnormally stupendous that he  couldn't at a moment grasp the truth that even wealth such as his may be  squandered in a very few years. Adam's admission had literally deprived him of  speech. Adam saw his emotion, and as he saw it his lip trembled.</p>
  <p>&quot;Come,  come, Oliver, old man,&quot; he said, with a painfully-forced assumption of  cheerfulness, &quot;we may yet pull through. Perhaps I take a too gloomy view  of it.&quot;</p>
  <p>But  Oliver was not to be put off by such speeches. He was thoroughly alarmed on his  friend's account, and insisted on Adam making a clean breast of his  liabilities, making a rough balance-sheet as he went, and as he proceeded his  face grew longer and longer. Adam had described the losses of the firm of  &quot;David Barron and Co.&quot; as &quot;enormous.&quot; As Oliver's eye scanned  the figures he recognised with dismay that the term had been no exaggeration.  But suddenly a thought flashed on his brain that brought a colour to his  anxious cheek, a new light to his sorrowful eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,  we've never put down Tarcoota!&quot; he cried, as he struck the table with his  fist, and broke into a laugh at the joy of the discovery. &quot;What is it  worth, Adam?&quot;</p>
  <p>His  joy was short-lived. One glance at Adam's face told him something was wrong.</p>
  <p>&quot;Tarcoota  isn't mine any longer,&quot; Adam said in a low voice, and he cast a look at  Oliver as if to ask him to spare him any further questions on the subject.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  yours!&quot; cried Oliver, as he fell back in his chair, and looked at his friend  in undisguised amazement. &quot;Have you sold it?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  bit his lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;No!  I've given it away,&quot; he answered in the same low tone.</p>
  <p>&quot;G-given  it a&mdash;&quot; began Oliver, and then the truth burst on him like a flash of  lightning. With a groan he let his head fall on the table, and for a full  minute he remained in that attitude, neither he nor Adam speaking a word. Then  he suddenly leapt to his feet, and folding the accounts up put them in his  pocket.</p>
  <p>&quot;There's  no time to be lost, Adam!&quot; he said, &quot;not a day, not an hour. The ship  may sink, but for God's sake let us make an effort to save her.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  offering no resistance to Oliver's suggestion, they went together to Mr.  Barron's office, where they found the old man &quot;up to his eyes&quot; in  business. For some time Mr. Barron had suspected that Oliver did not hold very  favourable views of his business capacity, and he had resented what he, perhaps,  somewhat naturally considered unfilial impertinence with a warmth which had  caused Oliver no little pain. It was, therefore, with no friendly eye that he  saw his son enter the room with Adam, and carefully shut the door behind him.  However, he bade them both good-morning in his usual effusively-cordial tone,  adding that he was glad that Adam had come, as he wanted him particularly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Is  it anything pressing that you've come about?&quot; he asked, turning to Oliver  with a look which the latter rightly interpreted as a request, or, at least, a  permission to be gone. &quot;I'm rightfully busy, Oliver. Adam and I have a lot  to talk about.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  drew himself up, and for a moment a blush of nervousness lit up his cheek. But  when he spoke the last trace of hesitation had died away, and his voice had a  manly ring that lent an additional force to his words.</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  come on Adam's business and on yours, father. I've been away too long. Had you&mdash;either  of you&mdash;taken me into your confidence, who knows but that I might have stumbled  on a means of averting what looks like certain ruin.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  old man started to his feet with a gesture full of rage.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  the deuce are you interfering for, and in things you know nothing whatever  about?&quot; he asked angrily. &quot;Ruin! What has put such nonsense into your  head?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam's  eves were on Oliver's face, and he read there a determination which  strengthened him in his newly-formed resolve to take his friend's advice.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver  is here at my wish,&quot; he said turning to Mr. Barron, and speaking with the  greatest firmness. &quot;Our affairs are in a critical position, and I for my part  am anxious to take some outside advice. I have every confidence in Oliver's  ability, and you must acknowledge that it is preferable to consult him to  calling in some stranger.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Barron was so used to having his own way&mdash;to his every suggestion being accepted  without discussion&mdash;that for the moment Adam's opposition took away his breath.  But he quickly regained his wits, and pleaded with no little earnestness to  have the sole management of the business left with him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver  spoke of ruin just now,&quot; he said, &quot;and ruin may result from interference.  Trust me, Adam,&quot; he implored, &quot;trust me as you have in the past, and  I pledge you my word that we shall pull through.&quot;</p>
  <p>But  Adam was not to be turned from his purpose, and Mr. Barron, after an obstinate  resistance, agreed to Oliver being taken into the firm's confidence. A long  conference then ensued, in which the affairs of the firm were exhaustively  discussed. It was remarkable that in spite of his opposition to Oliver being  admitted to the confidence of the firm, Mr. Barron sought his son's advice at  every turn. When they had finished he asked him bluntly what he recommended.</p>
  <p>During  the interview Oliver had been most self-contained, but now there came into his  eyes an expression of hesitation and pain.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  think the firm ought to go insolvent,&quot; he said in a low voice. Again did  the old man leap to his feet.</p>
  <p>&quot;Insolvent!  Never!&quot; he cried with violence, as he struck his palm with his fist.</p>
  <p>&quot;Can't  that be avoided?&quot; asked Adam, whose face was pale and grave. Oliver  sighed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes!  It can!&quot; he answered gravely. &quot;It you can get a sufficient guarantee.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;A  sufficient guarantee!&quot; repeated Adam, biting his lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes!  a sufficient guarantee, and there is one person, I need not say who it is, that  should not, that cannot, refuse you.&quot;</p>
  <p>What  little colour there was in Adam's face fled at this suggestion.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  wouldn't have her know my position for all the world,&quot; he exclaimed  hoarsely. &quot;I couldn't apply to her.&quot;</p>
  <p>But  the old man had caught at the idea with avidity. He now rushed to Adam's side  and pleaded with feverish earnestness for a favourable consideration of  Oliver's suggestion. He pointed out that everything was in favour of the Patons  complying with the request.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  they have a spark of common gratitude, of common decency in them, they must  come to your assistance,&quot; he cried. &quot;Why, you gave them everything they  have! If they lost all they would be no worse off than when they started.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;If  they refused you they would be meaner and more contemptible than even I think  them,&quot; muttered Oliver.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  they would help me in a minute if they knew that I was in such straits,&quot;  Adam hastened to interject with warmth. &quot;If it comes to the worst, I'll  tell them how I stand, and you'll see,&quot; he added with no little confidence,  &quot;that they won't shirk the responsibility.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  stamped his foot impatiently. &quot;Comes to the worst!&quot; he cried, as he  caught up a letter from Mr. Barton which had been received that morning, and  which was written in what that gentleman called his &quot;imperative  mood.&quot; &quot;You see what Mr. Barton says, and you ought to know by this  time that he never says what he doesn't mean to be taken literally.&quot;</p>
  <p>In  the end Adam gave way, and it was understood that that very afternoon he should  see Gertrude and make a clean breast of his position. This was the most that he  would promise to do. No threats, no entreaties, would induce him to ask for  assistance. If he was to be assisted by her the suggestion was to come from  Gertrude herself.</p>
  <p>As  Adam and Oliver passed out of the office, Dines, the clerk, stepped up to Adam  and asked him if he could speak to him for a few minutes.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  fact is, sir,&quot; he said, when Oliver was out of ear-shot, &quot;I want a  little temporary assistance. The poor old governor,&quot; he pointed with his  pen over his shoulder in the direction of Mr. Barron's office, &quot;has had a  bad time of it lately, and hasn't paid us our salaries for the last few weeks.  It isn't the first time it's happened, sir, and it won't be the last, but as  he's a freehanded gentleman when he's got it, I never worry him when he hasn't.  I've been payin' the others myself for the last three weeks, but now I'm run  clean dry. I hope you won't think it a liberty, sir.&quot;</p>
  <p>A  liberty? No! Before Dines had got half way through his story Adam's hand was on  his cheque-book, which he happened to have in his pocket, and he had sat down  at a desk.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  much obliged to you, Dines, for asking me,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;How much  do you want?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thirty  pounds will do, sir,&quot; answered Dines hesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  there's fifty,&quot; said Adam, filling in the cheque for that amount. When he  had signed it he handed it to Dines, and then shook hands with him with no  little warmth. &quot;You're a good fellow, Dines,&quot; he said, &quot;and I  hope that you will always look upon me as a friend.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  the hour approached for him to see Gertrude Adam's courage began to fail him.  Of late he had fancied that if she had not absolutely avoided him she had not sought  nor cared for his society. When first the reconciliation had taken place he had  been to the Patons' house daily, had been received as one of the family and had  felt thoroughly at home. But now he not infrequently found the door closed to  him. Mrs. Paton was indisposed, Mrs. Paton was out, Mrs. Paton was this, that,  and the other, and when he was received he felt strangely ill at ease. At first  he had been the guest, whoever might be present. Now he had lapsed into a  nobody, only noticed by Gertrude when Captain Petrie and other admirers were  not present. He didn't blame Gertrude for her behaviour, though it cut him to  the quick. He was blind&mdash;alas! he was always to be blind&mdash;to her shortcomings,  and his forgiving heart always found excuses for her. It was her husband who  forced her to act as she did. She was led away, and would some day be her old  self again. She couldn't know that her conduct wounded him. It was  carelessness, nothing more. And so it had come about that the worse he was  treated the more ready he was to forgive.</p>
  <p>It  was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon when he reached the Patons'. As he walked  up to the house&mdash;it was a roomy cottage, the windows of the drawing-room and  dining-room giving on a large lawn in front of the house&mdash;the sound of voices  reached him through the open windows, and he recognised with a shiver of dread  Gertrude's laugh above the general chatter.</p>
  <p>&quot;Poor  girl,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;I'm afraid that my news will be a sad  blow to her!&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was with a sinking heart that he rang the bell, and when the servant&mdash;a pert,  be-fringed, little woman, with a voice like a rasp&mdash;appeared, he could hardly summon  courage to ask if Mrs. Paton was in. To his surprise the woman answered that  Mrs. Paton was not at home.</p>
  <p>&quot;N&mdash;not  at home!&quot; he stammered. &quot;You must be making some mistake. I  distinctly heard her voice not a minute ago.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  feeling of servants towards their mistresses is, as a rule, one of absolute  good-will or absolute ill-will. They rarely adopt the medium of indifference.  The Patons' housemaid had been some little time with them, and her sympathies  had been from the first strongly enlisted in favour of her mistress, who was  easy-going, and (what is more to the purpose) excessively liberal. She  perfectly understood the relations existing between Adam Dyke and Mrs. Paton,  and she had made up her mind to lend her mistress what assistance lay in her  power to get rid of him. She thought the present a very opportune moment for  letting Adam Dyke know the truth.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mrs.  Paton's instructions was that I was to say she was not at 'ome, excep' to  certin' parties as she told me the names of,&quot; she said snappishly, as she  prepared to close the door.</p>
  <p>Adam  turned scarlet.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mrs.  Paton probably forgot my name,&quot; he said, as he placed his hand on the  door. &quot;I'll write a word or two on my card. Please take it into her.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  servant mumbled an unwilling assent. There was something in Adam's  voice that told her that he would see her mistress in spite of everything. So,  with an ungracious invitation to &quot;step into the 'all,&quot; she took  Adam's card in to her mistress. Two minutes afterwards she made her appearance  again, and showed Adam into Cyril's smoking room.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mrs.  Paton will be here directly,&quot; she said, as pertly as ever, and then  whisked out of the room with an air of contempt which was fortunately lost on  the object of her indignation.</p>
  <p>Gertrude  did not keep Adam long waiting, and when she greeted him the heartiness of her  manner served to revive somewhat his drooping spirits.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  a very awkward thing to happen!&quot; She laughed as she shook his hand, and  sat down quite near him. &quot;Emma certainly is the stupidest girl in the  world. She said I was out, didn't she?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  nodded an assent, and his joy at the discovery of the mistake brought a colour  to his anxious face.</p>
  <p>&quot;As  if I should ever be 'out' to you,&quot; laughed Gertrude. &quot;You, to whom I  owe everything. But you say here,&quot; she referred to the card, &quot;that  you want to see me on important business. Now what is it, Adam?&quot;</p>
  <p>Though  her manner was light, and nothing in her voice betrayed any anxiety, Gertrude  in reality felt some what uneasy. She knew Adam so well that she recognised  that something serious must have happened for him to send such a message to  her. His appearance did not tend to reassure her. His face was drawn and  anxious, and she noticed that his lip trembled as she referred to his errand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  the fact is, I've come here to tell you something about my position&mdash;I mean  something about 'our' position, I mean the firm's position,&quot; he stammered;  &quot;something that you must have known sooner or later, and that&mdash;that it has  been thought advisable you should know now.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude's  brow contracted, and there was an angry dash in her great hazel eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  since I can remember,&quot; she said sharply, &quot;my father has been in  difficulties. His commercial life has been a succession of disasters. What has  happened now?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  hesitated. The fear of wounding her for the moment tied his tongue.</p>
  <p>&quot;Go  on, Adam,&quot; she said resolutely. &quot;I am prepared to hear anything.  &quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  cast one look at her before he spoke, and he saw a resolution in her face that  told him that he need not hesitate to speak the whole truth.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  firm is on the verge of insolvency&mdash;in fact, if no assistance is forthcoming, it  must go. Your father's private means are exhausted, and I&mdash;I&mdash;I have given all  the assistance that I&mdash;I can spare. It is thought&mdash;Mr. Barton thinks, Oliver  thinks, I think, and your father thinks&mdash;that if the firm received a little  assistance for a year or two, or perhaps only for a few months, the danger  might be averted. Cash is not required. A guarantee would suffice.&quot;</p>
  <p>As Adam  spoke the cloud on Gertrude's fair brow deepened, and she bit her lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  suppose that a large portion of your fortune has been swallowed up in my  father's harum scarum schemes,&quot; she said.</p>
  <p>Adam  gave a nervous laugh. The question was not answered and was one that he did not  wish to answer truthfully. Bitter experience had taught him a certain cunning  and he felt that her knowledge of the actual truth would not improve his  position.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have lost a great deal of money,&quot; he answered, &quot;but I may get it all back,  and&mdash;and with interest.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  shrugged her shoulders. Then she rose to her feet, and walking to the window,  looked out into the garden for fully a minute.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  would be affectation for me to pretend that I don't see why you have told me  all this,&quot; she said at length, walking quite close to his side. &quot;You  wish, or rather my father wishes&mdash;for you would never have made such an  application of your own idea&mdash;my father wishes me to guarantee the solvency of  his firm, and he sends you, knowing that I am under a deep debt of gratitude to  you, as an ambassador to negotiate the business. He knows how terribly  difficult it would be for me to refuse you anything you ask. Now, if you ask  it, I shall not refuse&mdash;if, indeed, it is in my power to grant your request&mdash;but  before you do so I would ask you whether it would be right to throw away what has  been given for the maintenance of me and my child in a harebrained attempt to  save from ruin what never can be saved. If the firm went insolvent I should be  in a position to help my father, and, believe me, I shouldn't shrink from the  duty, But if our money was also engulfed in the disaster we should all be  steeped in beggary alike.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  spoke with no little warmth, for behind her selfishness there was a feeling  which told her that she had reason on her side. Adam was visibly affected, he  did not speak, but rising to his feet he took her hand in his.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you ask it, Adam,&quot; she said, &quot;all that you gave me is freely yours  again.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  drew back a pace. There was a manly resolution in every line of his face, and  his honest eyes flashed out his answer.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  shall ask nothing,&quot; he said, &quot;but your pardon for having been induced  to consider the possibility of such a thing. I haven't the slightest doubt that  if the necessity arises you will nobly fulfil your promise to assist your  father, and I,&quot; he added, purposely concealing how serious the matter was  for himself, &quot;shall never require any, I hope.&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was something in his attitude and manner which compelled Gertrude's admiration.  She caught him by the hand, and shook it warmly.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  hope you never will,&quot; she said.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk17"></a>Chapter  XVII.<br>
WHICH SHOWS HOW THE BEST OF FRIENDS MAY PART.</h2>
  <p>If  the political arena had been open to women&mdash;Heaven forbid that it ever should be!&mdash;I  feel assured that Mrs. Dale, notwithstanding her advancing years, would have  taken a high place in public life. It was not that she was a particularly good  speaker, nor a particularly good business woman, but she was possessed of a  shrewd unscrupulous cunning, which Machiavelli himself might have envied, and  which (in my non-political eyes) seems a gift of superlative value to any one  desirous of making his mark as a statesman. She was communicative when it  suited her purpose. She could be as discreet as Burleigh himself when the  occasion needed. But her especial strength lay in innuendo. She would sow a  crop of slanders with such an artful hand that the most exhaustive inquiry  could not trace their origin. People might suspect&mdash;for instance, the suspicions  of the Churchers and Patons almost amounted to conviction&mdash;but the charge,  though often preferred, was never brought home to her. Thus she lived on,  breeding mischief wherever she went, and yet not only tolerated but actually  welcome in a society of which she was the greatest curse.</p>
  <p>If  such a woman hates she is a good hater, and Gertrude Paton would have done well  not to push her to extremities. When Gertrude &quot;cut&quot; her she  transformed a passive dislike into a hatred of the most active type. Mrs. Dale  accepted the challenge, and meant to give no quarter.</p>
  <p>When  Oliver, with an aching heart, entered his office after the interview with his  father and Adam Dyke, he was told by his clerk that there was a lady waiting  for him in his room. He found it was Mrs. Dale.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  Mrs. Dale, what can I do for you?&quot; he asked, as he sank wearily into a  chair.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale looked round the room with an air of mystery. She knew the value of a  little by-play on occasions like this.</p>
  <p>&quot;There's  no danger of our being overheard, is there?&quot; she asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;None  whatever!&quot; he answered.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  Oliver, I've come here on a very serious, and, I'm sorry to say, a most  unpleasant errand,&quot; Mrs. Dale said, &quot;and I can honestly say that it  is only a strong sense of duty which makes me speak at all. Before I say  anything further I wish you to bear in mind the position that I have always  occupied towards your family. Your mother I knew before she was married, and,  as you probably know, I was one of her bridesmaids. Your father and my husband  were intimate friends for years. You and your sister I nursed on my lap as  children, and though I recognise with no little grief that I have ceased to  enjoy her friendship, I hope that I do not state anything but the truth when I  assert I retain yours.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  hastened to confirm this statement, and he did so with no little warmth. In the  days when the Dales were well off they had kept open house, and no one had  profited more by the fact than he had. Of course, he had heard rumours of Mrs.  Dale's shortcomings, but as he had never come across any proof to substantiate  the charges, he had good-naturedly dismissed them from his mind as unfounded.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  do, indeed!&quot; he interjected heartily, &quot;and I hope you always  will.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;That  at least is satisfactory,&quot; said Mrs. Dale, with a virtuous sigh. &quot;And  now for what I have come about. I believe that you and your sister have not  spoken for some years.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver's  brow darkened, and he made a movement of impatience.</p>
  <p>&quot;No!  We have not,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But if you have come to speak to me about  my sister, Mrs. Dale, I would ask you not to say anything further. She goes her  way. I go mine.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;My  dear Oliver, you may be sure that I have taken your position into  consideration,&quot; she continued earnestly, &quot;and that if what I wish to  tell you did not affect you, did not demand your interference in fact, I should  hold my tongue.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Demand  my interference!&quot; interjected Oliver in amazement. &quot;What do you  mean?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  mean that your sister is taking a road&mdash;alas! she has gone far on it already!&mdash;which  will infallibly lead her to ruin,&quot; continued Mrs. Dale impressively.  &quot;I mean that her name is in everyone's mouth, that things are said about  her that I dare hardly repeat to one of my own sex, and that, alas! there is  only too much ground for believing that what is said about her is true.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  started to his feet, and an angry flush dyed his cheek a deep scarlet.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't believe a word of it!&quot; he cried indignantly. &quot;I'm not friends  with her. I probably never shall be; but I would forfeit my right hand,&quot; he  exclaimed with a passionate gesture, &quot;that every breath against her is an  infernal lie.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale watched this paroxysm in silence, pursing her lips, and apparently deeply  moved.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver,&quot;  she said at length, &quot;your emotion is only natural. When first I heard  rumours affecting Gertrude's fair fame I felt as you did. I had known her as a  sweet innocent girl, and my whole being revolted at the idea of her being  anything else. But little by little I was unwillingly convinced that I was  mistaken, and a few days ago I accidentally came across proofs of her guilt,  which I must&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Proofs!  Produce them!&quot; interrupted Oliver angrily. &quot;I tell you, Mrs. Dale,  that nothing will convince me that Gertrude is anything but a pure woman.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale looked at Oliver with a compassionate expression, and paused a moment  before she spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  knew when I came here that I came on a thankless errand,&quot; she said with  well-simulated sorrow, &quot;and it is only the hope of saving one that,  however badly she has behaved, I still love, that makes me risk losing your  friendship too. Will you listen to me quietly, and I will tell you all.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  threw himself into a chair, and covered his face with his hands. &quot;Go  on!&quot; he said in a low voice. &quot;I shall not interrupt you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You  will remember,&quot; said Mrs. Dale, &quot;that your sister was engaged to Adam  Dyke at the time that she married Cyril Paton. For the first four years she was  married she saw nothing of her former lover. Then a reconciliation took place, and  Adam Dyke became a friend, <i>the</i> friend  of the house.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale paused with the artfulness of a clever <i>raconteur</i>,  and gave a sigh to enhance the interest of her narrative.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well?&quot;  said Oliver hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&quot;At  first this reconciliation gave nothing but satisfaction to everybody. It was so  universally recognised that Mr. Dyke had been shamefully treated, and his grief  at his loss had been so touching, that every one was pleased to see him  apparently happy again, and, believe me, no one was more pleased than I. But  after a while strange rumours got abroad; his constant attention to Gertrude  was so excessively marked that it would have been strange had they not got into  circulation, and people, from suspecting evil, were forced to admit that there  were more than grounds for suspicion. I still clung to my belief in her virtue  to the last. I thought that she had been foolish&mdash;very, very foolish&mdash;nothing  more. But two days ago my hopes were dispelled, and I was forced to acknowledge  the truth. Adam Dyke has been more than her friend,&quot; she whispered,  &quot;and I have proof of their guilt.&quot;</p>
  <p>At  Adam's name Oliver leapt to his feet, and such a fury of rage and shame flashed  from his eyes that Mrs. Dale instinctively drew back.</p>
  <p>&quot;Adam  Dyke!&quot; he cried. &quot;It's a d&mdash;d infernal lie!&quot;</p>
  <p>Again  did Mrs. Dale pause, and when she spoke it was in a perfectly collected voice.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  have the proofs,&quot; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Produce  them, then, instead of talking of them,&quot; he exclaimed angrily. &quot;I'll stake  my life on Adam's innocence.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale made a movement of impatience.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  you don't restrain yourself, Oliver,&quot; she said, &quot;it will be  impossible for me to go on. I'm not strong, as you know, and really any  violence would quite upset me.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Go  on! Go on!&quot; muttered Oliver, trying his best to master his emotion. &quot;What  is your evidence?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The  evidence of an eye-witness,&quot; continued Mrs. Dale. &quot;A servant who was in the  Patons' employ is now our housemaid, and it was from her that I received the  information that has brought me here to-day.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  burst into a derisive laugh.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  evidence of a servant!&quot; he cried. &quot;Some badly-behaved wench who was  dismissed Gertrude's service, and takes this means of wreaking her vengeance. I  shall want better proofs than that before I believe anything against my sister  or Adam Dyke.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dale shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  matter is easily tested,&quot; she said. &quot;Hear what the girl has to say,  and repeat what she says to Adam Dyke. If he denies it, I suppose you must take  his word. If he doesn't the girl is telling the truth. In any case, you will be  able to form some opinion of his guilt or his innocence. If he is guilty, I  have done you a good turn in opening your eyes to a wicked man. If he is innocent,  he will benefit by it. It will enable him to clear his name of an odious  imputation.&quot;</p>
  <p>For  a long time Oliver steadfastly refused to see the girl, who, it appears, had  been waiting in the outer office the whole time. But in the end he gave way,  and Mrs. Dale brought her into the room. She was a modest-looking girl of  five-and-twenty, and told her story with a certain hesitation that added in no  small degree to its probability. She testified to the intimate relations that  seemed to exist between Adam Dyke and Mrs. Paton, to their having constantly  dined and spent the evening t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, and to their having called each other  by their Christian names.</p>
  <p>&quot;Please  tell us about the necklace, Rose,&quot; said Mrs. Dale.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  ma'm, it was one evening after dinner,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Mrs. Paton  had been dining alone with Mr. Dyke, and as he usually did he went with her  into the drawing-room directly after. As he passed through the hall he took a  parcel off the table, and he began undoing it as he went towards the drawin'-room.  Well, ma'm, they always had their coffee served in the drawin'-room, an' a few  minutes afterwards I went with the tray. When I got to the door it was half  open.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The  door of the drawingroom?&quot; interjected Mrs. Dale.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes'm.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And  what did you see?&quot; asked Mrs. Dale.</p>
  <p>The  girl gave a nervous glance at Oliver, whose head was bent on his breast.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  see Mr. Dyke with the missus in his arms,&quot; she said, &quot;and he kissed  her, ma'm, I couldn't say how many times.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  Rose.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oliver  jumped up from his seat, and the sight of his face froze the coming revelations  on the girl's lips.</p>
  <p>&quot;That'll  do!&quot; he cried, turning his head away, and holding out his hand towards the  girl as if to shut out the possibility of seeing her. &quot;I want to hear no  more!&quot;</p>
  <p>Long  after Mrs. Dale had gone did Oliver sit with his heavy head on his hand. His  faith in Adam had been so complete, his love for him so trusting, his belief in  his integrity so unbounded that he was utterly crushed by the blow. Though he  still sought excuses for his friend, an inward voice that <i>would</i> make itself heard told him that the girl had spoken the  truth. He recalled Adam's frequent absences from home with painful exactitude,  and his recent taciturnity, which he had ascribed to mere shyness, now assumed  a very different aspect. But what brought the hot tears of shame to his eyes,  and a burning blush to his checks, was the thought of the gift of Tarcoota, a  gift hitherto ascribed to a noble liberality, but which he now could only look  on as a sinful bargain.</p>
  <p>&quot;To  think that I've been living with this man the whole time,&quot; he cried,  clenching his fists in a paroxysm of rage; &quot;that I've accepted favours  from his hands over and over again, that everything I've got in the world I owe  to him! Great Heaven! It's enough to drive me mad! But, late as it is, it's as  well that I know it!&quot; he exclaimed, as he seized his hat and stick and prepared  to leave the office. &quot;If he doesn't deny what this woman says, ay, every  word of it, the same roof won't cover us another night!&quot;</p>
  <p>He  jumped into a cab, telling the cabman to drive at his best pace. The cab had  hardly pulled up at the door before he was out and pulled the bell with  feverish impatience, which was not lessened when he found that Adam was not in.  He went to the little room which Adam and he used as a smoking-room, but which  had been originally intended for Gertrude's boudoir. There he threw himself  into a chair, eating out his heart with impatience for the coming interview.</p>
  <p>But  Adam's coming was so long delayed that Oliver had time to think the matter out  over and over again, and if his indignation was in no degree mitigated, the  violence of his passion assuredly was. It gave way gradually but surely to a  profound grief that everything about him only served to increase. As he looked  round the room a thousand pleasant memories rose before him, memories of  kindnesses received, memories of patient forbearance, memories of manly,  uncomplaining grief. There was not a thing in the room that had not some  association. There were little gifts from Adam lying about everywhere. His own  photograph was the principal ornament of the writing-table. The little room,  every nook and corner of it, was identified with sadly-pleasant recollections.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  Adam! Adam!&quot; he cried. &quot;How could you be so weak and wicked? How  could you? How could you?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  words were on his lips when the door opened, and Adam entered. There was a  weary beaten look on his face that Oliver at any other time would have noticed  in an instant. But at the sight of him all his impatience, all his indignation,  all his shame returned with overwhelming strength, and leaping to his feet, he  faced him with an angry brow and flaming eyes. At that moment their long and  tried friendship was forgotten. The man who stood before him was an enemy until  he proved his innocence, and everything in Oliver's attitude announced that it  was as an enemy that he looked on him.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  glad you've come at last,&quot; he said, and his voice almost whistled as it  left his dry lips, &quot;for I want a matter cleared up, and cleared up before  either of us leaves this room, which will settle whether we are to be friends  or enemies for life.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  started back, and turned pale. Astonishment and pain were written in every line  of his face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oliver,  my dear, dear Oliver!&quot; he interrupted. &quot;Are you mad?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Mad!  No! I've come to my senses, thank God!&quot; exclaimed Oliver with bitter  emphasis.</p>
  <p>Adam  made an impatient gesture, and it was in a voice of absolute anger that he  interrupted Oliver.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't know what has happened, Oliver, for you to go on like this,&quot; he  said, &quot;so the sooner you let me know the better. What is it?&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was something in Adam's voice that sobered Oliver's anger.</p>
  <p>&quot;Listen,  Adam, and I'll tell you,&quot; he said in a lower tone. &quot;I've learnt  to-day for the first time the amount of intimacy that has existed for the last  fifteen months or so between you and&mdash;and Gertrude.&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam's  face flushed scarlet, and he bit his lip nervously. &quot;We've been great  friends,&quot; he admitted in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&quot;Friends!  Have you been no more?&quot; cried Oliver as he leant forward and anxiously  awaited an answer.</p>
  <p>&quot;No  more?&quot; repeated Adam in amazement.</p>
  <p>&quot;Haven't  you given the world cause to call your friendship by an uglier name?&quot;  exclaimed Oliver.</p>
  <p>Adam  shook his head, and the sorrowful look on his face deepened. &quot;I trust  not!&quot; he answered with fervent emphasis.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  listen to me,&quot; cried Oliver, &quot;and if you can disprove what I've  heard, Adam, you'll make me the happiest man in the world. You dined one night  at the Patons' house alone with Gertrude?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  often have done so,&quot; admitted Adam.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  after dinner you went into the drawing-room with her?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;As  you passed through the hall you took a parcel from the table?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  did.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Which  contained a diamond necklace?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You  fastened that on yourself?&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  bit his lip, and the colour in his thin cheek deepened tenfold.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  did,&quot; he admitted in a low voice, and his eyes fell as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;Adam  Dyke, the door was open when all this took place, and a servant who was there&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Adam  started back, and the last trace of colour left his cheeks. In his eyes there  was an expression of absolute horror, and his lips turned livid. Oliver saw it,  and the words he was speaking died on his lips. For half a minute he stared at  Adam without speaking, and his cheeks were as colourless as Adam's own. Then he  broke forth in a perfect frenzy of sorrow.</p>
  <p>&quot;Say  it's not true! say it's not true!&quot; he cried. &quot;I've been such friends  with you, Adam, that it would break my heart, it would, indeed, if you couldn't  deny it The servant says you took Gertrude in your arms and kissed her. It's a  lie, is it not? it's a lie. Deny it, Adam, for the love of God, deny it.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke he drew near his friend, and catching him by the arm looked into his  face, and as he looked the scene that he had described rose before Adam Dyke  and sealed his lips. One glance told Oliver the truth, and with a cry of horror  he leapt back.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  is true, then,&quot; he cried, as he shook his fist in his rage, &quot;and all  this time that my heart has been full of pity for you, you have been a man that  I would have avoided like a leper if I'd but known the truth. I thought you  were an honest man who had been foully wronged&mdash;a man so honest that he would  shun the very thought of an evil deed. For you I parted with my own flesh and  blood, ay! and if you had been what I thought you were I would never have  regretted it. When Gertrude married that scoundrel, who felt for you as I  did?&quot; he asked, as passionate tears started to his eyes. &quot;Who tried  as hard as I did to heal the wound she had caused! Heaven knows I didn't ask  anything in return,&quot; he cried, &quot;and that I don't want to claim any credit  for what I did; but I say this, Adam Dyke, if by giving my life I could have  added a hairsbreadth to your happiness, I would gladly have shed every drop of blood  in my body.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-13-a.png" width="395" height="600"></p>
  <p>Adam  Dyke stood with downcast eyes, his face as pale as if it had been hewn of  marble. No word passed his lips. He had even lost the power of thought.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  say that I would have done all this if you had been what I thought,&quot; said  Oliver. &quot;Now I curse the day that I ever saw your face. You have loaded me  with presents&mdash;there isn't a thing I have that isn't your gift&mdash;the watch I  wear,&quot; he took it off and flung it on the table, &quot;the money I have in  my pocket,&quot; he took the money out as he spoke and put it by the watch, &quot;the  very clothes I have on my back. And now I tell you this, that if I have to work  the nails from my fingers you shall be repaid every farthing you have expended  on me or mine, for I can't breathe while I'm indebted to you. I shall leave  Melbourne, I shall leave the colony, and I hope that one of these days, when  sorrow overtakes you&mdash;as it assuredly will&mdash;the thought of how you've treated me  will add an extra pang to the bitterness of your grief.&quot;</p>
  <p>Before  the man he had so cruelly misjudged could guess his intention he had flung out  of the room, and a moment afterwards the slamming of the front door told that  he had left the house.</p>
  <p>They  never met again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="sk18"></a>Chapter  XVIII.<br>
CHRISTMAS DAY.</h2>
  <p>Discussing  with a friend the inventions of this century I ventured to remark that the  institution of &quot;afternoon tea&quot; was not the least important, when he,  who is possessed of an aggravatingly correct memory, reminded me that Dr.  Johnson was wont to drink a dish of tea with Mrs. Thrale of an afternoon, and  referred me to my <i>Boswell</i> for  confirmation of the fact. Now I don't care twopence&mdash;though I didn't acknowledge  it to him at the time&mdash;whether &quot;afternoon tea&quot; is a new institution or  not I am devoted to the meal, and if it goes out of fashion as suddenly as it  came in, it shall still retain its place in my household.</p>
  <p>Afternoon  tea was a great institution with the Patons, and Gertrude, who assuredly was  the best hostess that ever lived, spared no pains to make her tea-table  attractive. She was not content with providing the thinnest of bread and  butter, but there were scones, and cakes, and biscuits of such artful  manufacture that even the most fastidious palates were tempted. Then the tea  was such as you rarely get, and though her tea-cups were not unusually small, a  second cup was the rule and not the exception.</p>
  <p>It  was at afternoon tea on Christmas Eve, 1883, that we resume our acquaintance  with the Patons, and we could not resume it on a finer day. Though the sky was  cloudless, and in the morning the sun had been somewhat hot, there was just  enough wind to temper the atmosphere. The table was laid in the broad verandah  at the side of the house, and could not have been laid in a pleasanter place.  There, with a group of friends about her, Gertrude did the honours of her  tea-table, and though I am not animated by the kindliest of feelings towards  her, I acknowledge that she did them well.</p>
  <p>On  the lawn some young people were playing tennis, and here and there in the  garden were groups of people watching them. On a rustic seat, shaded from the  rays of the sun by a large clump of arbutus, sat Mrs. Churcher and the  ever-faithful Mr. Champlin.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  never see Mr. Barron without feeling sorry for him,&quot; said Mrs. Churcher,  as she looked to a remote part of the verandah, where Mr. and Mrs. Barron were seated,  &quot;though I'm told, and may say that I feel sure, that he deserves no  sympathy. He was so utterly crushed by his insolvency. He seemed to be transformed  at once into a decrepid, almost imbecile, dotard. He loved his business, and  with the loss of it went his interest in life.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  he was a beastly selfish old fellow,&quot; exclaimed Mr. Champlin impatiently,  &quot;and doesn't deserve any pity. Now, if you had said that you were sorry  for Adam Dyke I could understand it. Though he was an awful donkey, it was his  good qualities that ruined him&mdash;if, indeed, he was ruined, for the matter is  still open to doubt.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't think it,&quot; said Mrs. Churcher.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  but it is. Grainger told me for a fact that he is still very well off&mdash; that the  loss of his money quite turned his nature, and transformed him into a perfect  miser. He says he's worth &pound;50,000 if he's worth a penny.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I tell you that he isn't worth fifty thousand pence,&quot; said Mrs. Churcher,  in a tone which implied that her statement was beyond dispute. &quot;Are you  sure that we can't be overheard, and I'll tell you something.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Champlin took a careful survey.</p>
  <p>&quot;All  right, Alice,&quot; he said; &quot;fire away.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;To  begin with, don't call me Alice except in my own house,&quot; said the lady  with a frown. &quot;How often am I to warn you of the danger of doing it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;All  right; fire away,&quot; reiterated Mr. Champlin in a slightly snubbed tone.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  you remember when the firm of 'David Barron and Company' went insolvent Adam  Dyke disappeared, and various rumours got into circulation as to what had  become of him. Some said that he had gone to England, others that he was in  hiding about Melbourne, while some went so far as to say he had committed  suicide.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  it has never been cleared up as yet, has it?&quot; asked Mr. Champlin with some  interest.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  it has,&quot; answered Mrs. Churcher, &quot;but only in the last few days. It  seems that Adam Dyke was, after all, irretrievably ruined.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Who  told you?&quot; interjected Mr. Champlin eagerly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mr.  Barton, who is winding-up the affairs of the firm. When Adam Dyke disappeared  he went to Queensland, and&mdash;I know you will hardly credit it&mdash;accepted a billet  on a station at a pound a week.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Great  Heaven!&quot; cried Mr. Champlin. &quot;Can it be true?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  it's true enough,&quot; replied Mrs. Churcher; &quot;but that isn't what I was  going to tell you. A week ago, as Mr. Churcher was walking up Bourke street, he  saw a man sneak into a pawnbroker's shop, a man who evidently didn't wish to be  seen. As he passed under the lamp at the door Mr. Churcher thought that he  recognised him. Wishing to make sure, he waited until he came out. His  suspicions were confirmed. It was Adam Dyke.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Champlin started to his feet and his face betrayed no less horror than  astonishment.</p>
  <p>&quot;Goodness  me,&quot; he cried; &quot;that's awful!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;It  is indeed,&quot; said Mrs. Churcher, gravely. &quot;And when one considers that  every penny these people are spending was his, it does not make one take a  brighter view of the world.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  path, which led from the gate to the door of the house, was a few feet of where  this conversation took place, and as Mrs. Churcher uttered this moral  reflection steps were heard on the gravel path close at hand. A moment  afterwards a man appeared walking towards the house&mdash;a little, ill-dressed,  travel-stained man, who limped as if he were footsore.</p>
  <p>&quot;To  think of a man, whose lot but a few years ago filled us with envy, coming to  such a pass,&quot; moralised Mr. Champlin gravely. &quot;Why he may be in as  sorry a plight as that poor devil,&quot; and he pointed to the man, who was now  ringing the bell.</p>
  <p>When  the servant-girl answered the door the little man asked to see Mrs. Paton. It  was the same girl who had once refused Adam Dyke admission, and with a look,  which plainly expressed, &quot;I like your impertinence,&quot; she asked the  man what he wanted.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  want to see your mistress, I say,&quot; repeated Robert Dines, for it was he.  &quot;And you will oblige me by asking her to see me.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;May  I ask what name?&quot; said the girl with ill-concealed contempt, as she took  him in from head to foot.</p>
  <p>Dines  gave his name, and the servant, with every sign of unwillingness went to her  mistress with the message. To her surprise Mrs. Paton immediately expressed her  willingness to see him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Show  him into the library,&quot; she said to the girl, and then, turning to her  guests, she explained that Mr. Dines was an old and valued clerk of her  fathers.</p>
  <p>When  she entered the room she greeted the little man with no little heartiness. No  one knew better than Gertrude Paton the value of occasional condescension.</p>
  <p>&quot;Take  a seat, Mr. Dines,&quot; she said, as she herself sat down. &quot;What can I do  for you?&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1402401h-images/SK page-13-b.png" width="621" height="600"></p>
  <p>The  little clerk did not accept the invitation, but stood in the same place with an  uneasy look in his dim eyes. Gertrude repeated her question.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  can do nothing for me, ma'm,&quot; he said at length, and he spoke with a  serious deliberation that aroused Gertrude's curiosity; &quot;but you can do a good  deal for someone on whose behalf I've come.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  raised her eyebrows.</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed,  she exclaimed. &quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  little man paused before he answered, and when he spoke it was almost in a  whisper. But low as his voice was the name he uttered reached Gertrude's ears  as surely as if it had been yelled into them by a thousand voices at their loudest.</p>
  <p>&quot;Adam  Dyke.&quot;</p>
  <p>With  a scream Gertrude fell back in her chair, and every trace of colour left her  cheeks.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  really should&mdash;you really should have prepared me for such&mdash;for such a blow,&quot;  she gasped. &quot;What does he ask? What does he want? Where is he?&quot; she  asked almost in one breath.</p>
  <p>The  attitude of the little man had hitherto been no friendly one, but at sight of  Gertrude's emotion he unbent, and when he spoke there was a ring of joyful  gratitude in his voice that he did not try to conceal.</p>
  <p>&quot;You'll  come and see him, Miss Barron,&quot; he cried eagerly, calling her in his  excitement by her maiden name. &quot;you'll come and see him, won't you? The  very sight of you, ma'm 'll be the saving of him. He's so bad, poor fellow&mdash;so  lonely, in such bad spirits. You'll come, won't you ma'm? Me and my wife has  done what we could for him; but, Lor' bless you, what can we do for a man like  him?&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  leant forward, and her colour came and went as she spoke.</p>
  <p>&quot;Of  course I'll come and see him,&quot; she said in a low voice, &quot;the very  moment that I have a minute to&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>The  little man rushed to her side, and in his excitement caught her by the hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now!  now!&quot; he cried. &quot;There's not an instant to be lost. The man's dying&mdash;I  tell you he's dying.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  bit her lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  can't possibly go to-day,&quot; she said. &quot;As you see, I have company,  and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Robert  Dines leapt back as if he had been stung.</p>
  <p>&quot;Company!&quot;  he cried. &quot;Can you weigh your company against a man's life?&quot;</p>
  <p>Gertrude  burst into tears and pressed her embroidered handkerchief to her eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  really most dreadful,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;but you don't know what's  expected of a person in my position, Dines, or&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank  God that I don't!&quot; interrupted the little man with a passionate gesture of  contempt. &quot;If a person in your position is not to obey the ordinary  dictates of humanity, then I say that your <i>position</i> is a curse, and I wouldn't change places with you for all the wealth of the  Indies.&quot;</p>
  <p>Robert  Dines was a plain little man, with a head of tangled red hair, a red tuft on  his chin, and a freckled face. But as he spoke these words the indignation that  fired him transfigured his homely features, and Gertrude could not restrain a  feeling of admiration for him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I'll see what can be done,&quot; she said in a low voice, &quot;and will come  if I possibly can. Is&mdash;is he at your house?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Down  on the Richmond Flat?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  you may expect me either to-day or to-morrow,&quot; said Gertrude, as she rose  from her seat.</p>
  <p>Dines  took up his hat and prepared to go. There was a look on his face which told of  deep disappointment and sorrow.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  had better be to-day, ma'am,&quot; he said gravely, &quot;or you may be too  late.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  come as soon as I can&mdash;I will indeed,&quot; said Gertrude earnestly, as she  walked with him to the door of the room. &quot;Mr. Dines,&quot; she whispered,  as she laid her hand on his arm; &quot;you mustn't be offended, but if&mdash;if  you're in want of money I have some in the house, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>Robert  Dines drew away his arm, and his face went scarlet.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'd  sooner sell everything I have in the world,&quot; he began indignantly, and  then he added almost in the same breath, &quot;I beg your pardon, ma'am&mdash;we  don't want any assistance.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he limped down the path Gertrude's eyes followed him, and the flush of shame  which had brightened her cheeks did not leave them till long after he had passed  out of the gate.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  know that it must appear most heartless of me,&quot; she said, as she bit her  lip; &quot;but what was I to do, with all these people here?&quot;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Christmas  morning was ushered in by a mist which soon gave way before the rays of the  sun, and as Robert Dines, who had been up all night with his patient, saw the  prospect of a fine day, his spirits rose somewhat, and as the day crept on his  hopes rose higher and higher.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  he can only live through the day,&quot; he whispered to his wife, &quot;I have a  presentiment that he will pull through. The only thing I'm frightened of is his  regaining consciousness before Mrs. Paton comes. If he did, and found that she  hadn't been here, I think it would kill him right off.&quot;</p>
  <p>A  grave look came into Mrs. Dines's eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you think that she will come at all?&quot; she asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Come!&quot;  he exclaimed. &quot;Well, if she doesn't&mdash;&quot; and then he broke off short and  the hope died out of his eyes.</p>
  <p>Just  then the doctor arrived, a man highly esteemed both in his profession and by  the public, a man of marked ability, and of a kindliness of disposition which  had endeared him to all classes.</p>
  <p>&quot;How's  your patient?&quot; he asked in a low voice, and without waiting an answer he  went into an inner room, where Adam Dyke had lain moaning and muttering for  many a long day. &quot;Has he ever regained consciousness?&quot; he asked.</p>
  <p>Robert  Dines shook his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;No,  sir,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;He talks away like that night and day.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  doctor pursed his lips, and as he felt the patient's pulse and tested his  temperature Robert Dines's anxious eyes never left his face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Is  there any hope?&quot; he asked in an eager whisper.</p>
  <p>The  doctor's face was as grave as his own as he answered him. &quot;None  whatever,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p>The  little clerk sat down on the edge of the bed, and his head fell on his hands.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  Mrs. Paton would only come,&quot; he cried. &quot;If she'd only come there  might be hope.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  there's no harm in trying,&quot; he said. &quot;Suppose you go and fetch her.  My buggy is outside. Jump in. You can be back here within the hour. I'll look  after the poor fellow; your wife here will give me any assistance I want.&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was a certain chivalry in Robert Dines's nature which never asserted itself  more strongly than on this occasion. Though he was filled with indignation at  Gertrude's heartlessness, nothing would have induced him to acknowledge the  truth.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  go, sir,&quot; he said, and without more ado he went into the outer room to get  his hat. The sick-room was very dark, and as he passed out of it the strong  light almost blinded him. And it seemed to the simple fellow as if the glorious  light of day which streamed in at the window, lighting up the pattern of the  shabby carpet and revealing in naked truth the poverty of the wretched  furniture, was a mocking light and he went to the window and with a careful and  silent hand turned the Venetian so that the room was in half darkness.</p>
  <p>&quot;We  have no share in the joys of to-day,&quot; he reflected bitterly.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the doctor sat by the patient's side, and with an attentive eye and ear watched  every movement and sound. And as he looked at his face bitter thoughts indeed  came into his mind. He had known Adam Dyke in his days of prosperity, had seen him  courted and fawned upon, had recognised his solid worth, that no adulation nor  flattery could tarnish, had admired him as he had rarely admired anyone. And  here he was &quot;fallen from his high estate,&quot; &quot;deserted at his  utmost need by those his former bounty fed.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Merciful  God!&quot; he said aloud. &quot;It makes one doubt the justice of Heaven.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke the suffering man moved slightly, and his words, which hitherto had  been indistinct, now were plainly audible.</p>
  <p>&quot;Gertrude&mdash;Gertrude,  dear Gertrude. You said that if the opportunity ever came you would&mdash;you would  repay. She'll come, Dines, she'll come. She wouldn't leave me. And Oliver will  come too. I can&mdash;No, Oliver, no! I swear it by all I hold sacred. She'll come. .  . . Gertrude, Gertrude!&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dines went to the doctor's side.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  a good sign, isn't it, sir?&quot; she asked eagerly. &quot;He's talking more clearly&mdash;did  you notice it, sir?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  doctor shook his head.</p>
  <p>&quot;There's  no hope, Mrs. Dines,&quot; he said dejectedly. &quot;He may linger on for a few  hours, but that's all. If he hadn't been a strong man he would have been dead  days ago. He's making a gallant fight for life,&quot; he added, as he watched  the face of the sufferer with sorrowful eyes, &quot;but it does not require  much skill to foretell that the battle won't be a long one.&quot;</p>
  <p>A  long one! It was over already. With a sigh and a shiver poor Adam Dyke turned  on his side and gave in.</p>

  <p>Aye!  a trainer's life's rite enough, once he's fair started, 'as a nice string o'  horses, an's trainin' for the rite sort. If he is a bit anxious when races is  on, there's plenty o' times that he don't bother 'is 'ed 'bout nothin', an' if  he's got a good man in charge o' the stables, why, he can take things jest as  easy as he likes. An' it's only rite as he should, for he 'as a pretty rough  time of it <i>afore</i> he comes a trainer,  leastways as a rule. O' course there's some on 'em as comes trainers rite off,  gents as 'as a likin' for horses princerply, but that sort ain't common. Most  on 'em goes through much the same as me. They starts as stable-boys, getting a  mount&mdash;a pretty rough un most times&mdash;ev'ry now an then, an' by the time as  they're through their time they generally thinks they knows enough to train on  their own hook, an' most on 'em <i>does</i>&mdash;if  they can get anyone to give 'em a start. O' course there's some on 'em as ain't  fit to blister a rockin'-'orse, an' ha' got no more sense in their 'eds than a  wooden immidge, but even some o' <i>them</i> lasts a long time afore they're found out. You've no idea wot a fool the public  is once it's took a notion as a feller's clever. Why! There's Bob Goslin' as big  a fool as ever lived, an' knows no more about a horse than . . . . Well! that  ain't neither here nor there. I meant to tell you how <i>I</i> started, so I'll let Bob slide. The public 'll find 'im out sure  enough in the long run, an' then they'll drop 'im like a 'ot pertater.</p>
  <p>Talkin'  o' Bob Goslin' brings me quite nat'ral to my yarn, for Bob was bound to Ike Blosely  when I went there to serve my time. I was only a lad o' fifteen at the time,  an' a wery small un at that: but small as I wos an' young as I wos, I'd already  done a bit of ridin', an' 'ad scored a win or two. My father 'ad a bit of land  up Warruambool way, an' when there wos races anywheres near, I used always to  get a mount. Ike Blosely saw me ride, an' thought as there wos the makin' of a  good lad in me. He spoke to the old man, an' in ten minutes the thing was fixed  up. My mother, poor old soul fought 'ard agen it at first. I can see the tears  in her eyes this very minute I'm speakin', as she sed it 'ud break her 'art to  part with her boy, but the old man's mind was made up, an' wot he wanted to do  he always did. So it come about one fine mornin' he took me up to town an' left  me in a bran-new suit o' clothes with a big cake in my box, and two bright  sovereigns in my pocket, at Ike Blosely's place, where I stayed for five long  years.</p>
  <p>Now  I ain't goin' to talk much o' wot went on in them days 'mongst the lads in  trainin' stables, for it wouldn't do no good if I did. Things are a bit better  now, thank God, than they was then, tho' a stable ain't <i>nowadays</i> the place as a <i>careful</i> father 'ud choose for 'is son. But in them days the life as the lads led wos  real bad an' no mistake. There wos five other lads there asides me, an' for all  that they was on'y jest a shade older than me, they bet, an' they gambled, an'  they swore, an' they drank, an' there wasn't nobody as wos man enough to put a stop  to it. Put a stop to it, indeed! Why, I think Ike Blosely liked to see such  goin's-on. Any ways, he used often to come to &quot;the lads' room,&quot; as it  wos called, an' the flasher a lad wos the more he took to 'im. An' he'd play  cards with 'em, an' do 'is level best to win their money, too, an' if he <i>did</i>, Lor', how he'd laugh, tho', mind  you, he'd give 'em credit if they had him. So long as they did their work <i>he</i> didn't care what become of 'em, so it  ain't no wonder as 'is lads bore a terrible name.</p>
  <p>There  was one of 'em as I took to rite off, more I 'spect cos he took to me than cos  there wos any p'ints about 'im as a lad wos likely to cotton to. 'Is name was  Willum Iles, but you might ha' lived at Ike Blosely's for a year an' never  found <i>that</i> out, for he wos always  called Crumpets; some sed cos his face was wery white and all covered with  marks from the small-pox, as he must ha' had wery bad, an' some sed cos he was  wery partial to them kind of wittles, which I think's wery probable, as he wos  a terrible big feeder. Anyways Crumpets he wos called, an' as <i>he</i> didn't object, it wasn't nobody's  business. He wos a long thin fellow wos Crumpets, nigh on six feet high, an'  though he wos very thin, he wos orful strong, an' could put through the best  lad in the stable. Not as he ever blowed 'bout 'is strength, or showed off, or  anythin' o' the kind, but ev'ry now an' then, as you'll hear directly, he had  to use 'is fists, and, I tell yer, 'e 'ad quite the perfessional touch about  'im. An' the way it come about wos this. Yer see Ike Blosely afore 'e wos a  trainer wos a prize-fighter, an' for all that 'e never went in the ring no  more, 'e liked to keep is 'and in. So wot did he do but buy some gloves, an'  'tween times wen there wos nothin' else doin' 'e'd put on the gloves with the  biggest o' the lads, an' bet 'em a bob as they couldn't 'it 'im in the face in  five minutes. O' course he never paid 'em, if they did; he never did pay  nobody. If he'd 'ad to pay Crumpets 'e'd ha' gone broke, for Crumpets got that  smart as it took Ike all 'is time to 'old his own, o' course I mean with the gloves.  If it 'ad come to fightin' Ike would ha' knocked 'im out in no time, for Ike  wos a tremenjus powerful man, an' Crumpets, yer see, for all that 'e wos strong  for a boy, <i>wos</i> ony a boy, an' a wery  light-made 'un at that. Still with the gloves he wery near 'eld 'is own, and  when Ike wosn't in tip-top form, or 'ad been drinkin', an' that happened 'bout  twice a week, Crumpets would give 'im What For I can tell yer. Lor', how we  fellows used to larf when he'd land Ike a real good 'un. &quot;Go it,  Crumpets!&quot; we'd sing out. &quot;Go it, old man! Give 'im beans!&quot; an'  we'd pertend as 'e'd put Ike thro'&mdash;not as 'e ever really <i>did</i>, you know, fer all that he shaped so well, but jest to please  'im an' to annoy Ike, who thought no end o' hisself at the game.</p>
  <p>But  I was sayin' as I took to Crumpets rite off, an' the way of it wos this. Late  in the evenin' the furst night as I wos at Ike's we wos all sittin' in the lads  room, an jest thinkin' o' turnin' in. Our beds wos all put round the room&mdash;eight  on 'en there wos&mdash;an' mine wos next to Crumpets', who wos lyin' on 'is a readin'  of <i>The Orstralasian</i>. The other lads  wos playin' cards most o' the evenin'&mdash;an' terrible they swore over 'em too&mdash;an' smokin'  an' tellin' yarns. I sat on my bed a watchin' 'em, an' feelin' jest like a fish  out o' water, wishin' misself at 'ome, I can tell yer, and 'arf inclined to  cry. They asked me to play when they begun, an it wos then as I first heard  Crumpets speak.</p>
  <p>&quot;Stash  that,&quot; he seys, frowning like. &quot;Let the lad be.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  didn't understand quite wot he meant an' why he interfered.</p>
  <p>&quot;I&mdash;I  don't play cards,&quot; I seys, hesitatin'.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  yer?&quot; seys the lad as asked me, with a sneer. &quot;I suppose yer ma&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>He  'adn't got no further than that when up jumps Crumpets from 'is bed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Leave  the lad alone,&quot; he seys, &quot;or I'll give yer somethin' as 'll make yer  keep a civil tongue in yer 'ed.&quot; Then, turnin' to me, he gives me part o' <i>The Ostralasian</i>&mdash;ony the advertis'ments,  it's true, which ain't what you'd call pop'lar readin', an' as I never could  tackle kindly&mdash;an', without speakin' another word, laid 'is self down on the bed  agen, an', turnin' 'is back to me, started readin' the paper agen.</p>
  <p>That  wosn't the ony time that night as he 'ad to take my part.</p>
  <p>When  we wos goin' to bed I opened my box to take out my nightshirt, and wot should there  be at the top o' the box but my cake. They'd all been lookin' at me, an' winkin'  an' larfin' an' carryin' on, but when they sees the cake an' the nightshirt  (for <i>they</i> never uses none, but jest  sleeps in their shirts) they bust out larfin' fifty times worse than  ever, an' begun teasin' me real cruel.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ain't  ma good?&quot; seys one. &quot;He's got 'is sister's shimmy!&quot; seys  another. &quot;A bloomin' weddin' cake,&quot; seys a third; &quot;let's ask Ike  inter the nupshalls.&quot; An' then the young chap as 'ad asked me to play  cards&mdash; Danny Miles wos 'is name&mdash;whips 'is 'and inter the box, an' collars the  cake in one 'and and the nightshirt in the other. &quot;Allow me to assist you,  my deah fellah!&quot; seys he, imitatin' the swells, an' holdin' up the things  to show 'em to the rest.</p>
  <p>&quot;Put  them down,&quot; says a woice behind 'im.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  business is it o' yourn?&quot; seys Danny, mighty sulky, &quot;I ain't 'urtin  you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Put  them down!&quot; seys Crumpets&mdash;o' course, you'll ha' guessed it wos  him&mdash;&quot;or&mdash;I'll&mdash;make&mdash;yer,&quot; speakin' the words jes' like that, wery slow.</p>
  <p>Danny  looked for a moment as if he'd jib, but 'e saw summit in Crumpets's eye as he didn't  like the look of.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll  get even with you for that, Crumpets,&quot; seys he under 'is breath, as he  shoved the things back; but Crumpets, if he heerd 'im didn't take no notis, an'  jest went an' laid down as afore, readin' the paper with 'is back to us.</p>
  <p>I  crept inter my bed feelin' wery miserable, an' wishin' more than ever as I'd  never left 'ome. I closed my eyes, for I wos frightened to watch the lads, for  fear as they'd catch me at it, tho' I felt sure, from the way as they wos  whisperin', as they wos talkin' of me. I took a sly peep at Crumpets ev'ry now  an' then, wishin' as he'd turn round, an' see wot they wos up to, but there he  lay, with his back turned the whole time, an' takin' no more notis of anybody  than if he'd bin by hisself.</p>
  <p>Presently  they puts out the lights, an' soon I hears most on 'em asleep. But I couldn't  sleep. I wos thinkin' o' my home, an' my old mother, an' the kids, an' I felt  jest as homesick as ever a lad did in this world. An' I hope as you won't  think the worse o' me for it, but the lights bein' out, I jest began cryin'. Now  I never knowed whether Crumpets knowed it or not, but jest then he leaned  across towards my bed. &quot;Young 'un,&quot; he whispers wery low, &quot;wot's  up?&quot; &quot;Nothin',&quot; says I. &quot;Keep your pecker up,&quot; seys he,  still under his breath like. &quot;You'll soon get used to it,&quot; seys he,  speakin', as he always did, in a wery gruff sort o' way, but meanin' kindly  enough.</p>
  <p>It  wos all wery well to <i>talk</i>, but jest  them kind words o' his made me all the worse. I didn't cry much more; I wos  frightened as I'd be heard, an' that stopped the pipes, I fancy; but I jest lay  there wide awake, an' feelin as if my heart wos broke. It most ha' been an hour  or more, an' all wos as silent as the grave, when I heard Crumpets move, an'  saw 'im turn his face my way, for he slept under the window, an' I could jest  see 'im; an' I'd bin thinkin how good it wos o' him to interfere, and that I'd  never really thanked 'im as yet. So I jest slips out o' bed, an' layin' my 'and  on 'is shoulder, &quot;Mr. Crumpet,&quot; says I.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  is it, young un?&quot; says he, quite sharp.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  only want to tell you as I'm wery much obliged, Mr. Crumpet,&quot; says I.</p>
  <p>I'm  sure as a frown come over 'is face tho' I couldn't o' course see it.</p>
  <p>&quot;All  right!&mdash;All right!&quot; he says quite snappishly, and tarns 'is back on me  agen.</p>
  <p>The  next mornin' the cake was gone; an' the two bright soverins as my father had  give me when he left me, <i>but</i> I didn't  tell Crumpets.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>II.</b></p>
  <p>Now  I hates anythin' like blabbin', special' on one's mates, but it wouldn't be no  use me tellin' this here yarn if I didn't tell the truth. I don't want to set up  as bein' any better than the rest o' them. I'm free to confess as arter I'd  been there 12 months I wos a reglar young rip&mdash;a puffick out-an-outer. I smoked  my pipe, I drunk my arf pint (or my pint for the matter of that), an if I  couldn't deal misself the two bowers at euchre I 'ad a pretty rough idea o'  when Danny Miles did. Them things is easy learned, an' the road to the devil  ain't a hard un to travel.</p>
  <p>Wot  did Crumpets think on it? I'm blessed if<i> I</i> know. I don't think he troubled 'is 'ed about it. Yer see, he'd seen so  many go to the dogs afore me&mdash;he was 19, wos Crumpets&mdash;as I suppose he didn't  think it no use a interferin'. Jest at first I fancy he'd a mind to speak to  me, for once or twice he giv' it me 'bout playin cards an' so on, but I suppose  as he seen it wosn't no use, an' let me go my own way. An' to tell the truth I  wos wery glad at the time as he did, for&mdash;ungrateful young scamp as I wos&mdash;I  begun to feel 'shamed like o' the poor old chap's pertection, thinkin' as it  lowered me in the eyes o' the other lads. They seys &quot;there's no fool like  a old fool.&quot; They're fools as seys it. &quot;There's no fool like a <i>young</i> fool,&quot; an o' all young fools  I was jest about the biggest. Yer musn't think for all that as I wasn't friends  with Crumpets. Not a bit of it. We got on right enough, ony yer see&mdash;yer know&mdash;we  wosn't as thick as yer might ha' supposed we would ha' bin.'</p>
  <p>Ike  Blosely 'ad a fine string o' horses in them days, indeed yer might say as <i>'is</i> was the leading institooshun o' the  colony. He trained for some o' the best men as ever owned a horse, Ike did. An'  mind you, he <i>could </i>train, could Ike.  If there was a race in a horse <i>he'd</i> 'ave it out o' him, an' I never knowed his ekal for spottin' a duffer. How wos  it then, seys you, as he went broke, an' as it come as nobody 'ud give 'im a  horse to train? <i>Ike Blosely couldn't go straight;  he's 'ave 'is own father, an' as the sayin' is, rob a sick brother o' his  gruel.</i> That's how it wos, an' if you listen for arf a minit I'll tell you how  he lost 'bout 'is best customer.</p>
  <p>O'  course you know'd Mr. Reginald Roethorne, and&mdash;you didn't? Well, then it wos your  loss let me tell you, for a finer young chap never stood in shoeleather. It  wosn't only as he wos a well set up an' good lookin' man&nbsp; for 'is outside, good as it wos, wosn't arf  the best part o' him. He wos jest the kindest-'arted, freest-anded man as ever  I come across. 'Art. He had the 'art of a bullock! Well, Ike Blosely trained  for Mr. Roethorne, an' 'ad trained for 'im ever since he come on the turf,  which wos jest arter I jined the stable, an' a wery good thing Ike 'ad made of  'im. Yer see Mr. Roethorne wos jest the sort as a trainer likes to get hold of,  a chap as'll put the money on like water if he gets the wink, an'll lay you arf  'is winnings to nuthin'. Wos he pleased when he won? Aye! That he wos, but he  didn't whine for all that if he got a doin'. He wos the rite sort, wos Mr.  Roethorne, an' could take a lickin' or a win better than anyone I ever seen.</p>
  <p>Well,  I'd bin five years at Ike's w'en the spring meetin' was comin' on, an' we'd got  a big look in for three or four of the best races o' the meetin'. We'd two as 'ad  a show for the Cup, the Darby was a clean gift to Shanticlere, *Filly D'lary  was reckoned the best two-year-old o' the year&mdash;aye, an' she wos too&mdash;an' it  looked wery like as if we 'ad the Hurdle and Steeple double in the stable. Our  leppers wos mostly Mr. Roethorne's, who didn't care tuppence for flat racin',  an' wen the books opened on the double over the sticks Mr. Roethorne's pair  become the fav'rit' double afore you could say Jack Robinson.</p>
  <p class="quote">*Fille  de l'Air.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  do you think o' my chance?&quot; he seys to Ike Blosely the day the weights  come out. &quot;I like Quickstep,&quot; (he wos the steeple horse, wos  Quickstep). &quot;I like Quickstep well enough,&quot; he seys; &quot;but don't  you think Cinderreller has a bit too much weight?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Not  a' ounce,&quot; seys Ike. &quot;She'll waltz in.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  saw by Mr. Roethorne's face as he wos pleased.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'd  better back her, then,&quot; he seys. &quot;Wot price ought I to take?&quot;</p>
  <p>Ike  larfed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Price!&quot;  seys he. &quot;Any price you can get.&quot;</p>
  <p>Just  then Ike was called away, an' Mr. Roethorne an' me wos left together. We wos standin'  at the door o' the loose box where Cinderreller wos.</p>
  <p>&quot;Let's  'ave a look at the mare,&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>So  on that in we goes, an' I takes off the clothin', an' I tells you, as I stood  back with the clothin' thrown over my arm an' looked at her, I felt as proud of  her as if she'd bin my own flesh an' blood, as they say. An' Mr. Roethorne was  proud of her too&mdash;it wos easy to see that; for a kind o' colour gathered on his  cheek, an' 'is eyes fair gleamed with pleasure.</p>
  <p>&quot;She  does you credit, Chipping,&quot; he seys. &quot;She does you credit.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thankee,  sir,&quot; seys I, an' then I adds. &quot;She'll do me more credit arter the Hurdles is  over,&quot; seys I.</p>
  <p>He  larfed.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  think she'll win,&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  sure on it,&quot; seys I.</p>
  <p>An'  then he larfs agen.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  hope she may,&quot; he seys, an' he tells me to put the clothin' on her. I'd  jest finished puttin' the straps tidy, wen he seys, sudden-like as if somethin'  was runnin' in 'is 'ed. &quot;You've always rode 'er in 'er work, Chipping,  haven't you?&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  sir,&quot; I seys, noddin'. He stopped a minit.</p>
  <p>&quot;How'd  you like to ride her in the race?&quot; he seys.</p>
  <p>I  near jnmped out o' my skin. I'd often rode, yer know, but as yet I 'adn't made  misself no name, an' Billy Button did all the ridin' over sticks for us wen we  'ad anythin' big on. I suppose my face showed wot my feelins wos, cos he didn't  wait for me to speak.</p>
  <p>&quot;You'd  like it, eh?&quot; he larfs, &quot;Well! you shall 'ave the mount,&quot; seys  he. &quot;I was talkin' to Mr. Blosely 'bout it, an' as he don't object you  shall 'ave it. An' it's ony a fair thing,&quot; seys he, &quot;that you <i>should</i> ride her arter lookin' arter her  so well.&quot;</p>
  <p>As  he left me to go to Ike, who was standin' at the other end o' the yard, talkin'  to Bob Gosling, he slips a note into my 'and.</p>
  <p>&quot;There's  a losin' mount,&quot; seys he. &quot;I'll lay you two hundred to nuthin' 'bout  winnin'.&quot;</p>
  <p>When  he was gone I looks at the note, an' wot d'yer think it was? A fiver? Yes, an'  more! A tenner? Yes, an' more! It was a <i>twenty-pun  note</i>, as true as my name's Richard Chipping, an' if yer don't call that comin'  down 'andsome yer've got wery different ideas on the subjick to me.</p>
  <p>Lord!  how I did graft* them three weeks afore the race. I was the first up in the  mornin', the last to bed o' night; aye, an' many's the time I'd get up in the  night an' sneak across the yard an' 'ave a look at her, I wos that frightened  lest anythin' should 'appen to her. I tell yer I didn't know whether I was  standin' on me 'ed or me 'eels. I don't think it was the money as I stood to  win as made me the most anxious. Yer see it wos my first mount in a big event,  an' yer've got to be a jockey startin' life to know wot that means.</p>
  <p class="quote">*Work</p>
  <p>Ike  Blosely noticed the way I wos workin' at her, an' one day he seys to me&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;Anyone  'ud think you'd got your bit on her,&quot; he seys, larfin.</p>
  <p>I  seys nuthin, for he wos that greedy he'd a made me lay 'im arf to nuthin', or else  he'd ha got Mr. Roethorne to take me off.</p>
  <p>&quot;She's  fust favrit, ain't she, sir?&quot; I seys, careless like, as I puts on her  roller.</p>
  <p>Ike  larfed, an' a nasty kind o' larf it wos.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  she is,&quot; he seys ; &quot;but that won't make her win.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;An'  it won't stop her,&quot; seys I.</p>
  <p>Ike  looked at me suspicious like, 'an bit 'is mustache; and he 'arf opened 'is  lips, as if he was goin' to say summut. But he changed 'is mind if he wos, an'  walked out o' the stable wistlin'. I didn't think nuthin' of it at the time,  but it wosn't long afore I remembered them words of 'is, an' that look, an' when  I did I understood the villin as well as if 'e'd told me wot wos passin' in 'is  mind.</p>
  <p>Now,  I've sed as Ike had a big string o' 'orses, an' trained for all sorts o'  people, an' one o' 'em was Rafe Hyam, a Jew bookmaker, an' in them days one of  the biggest men in the ring. Well, this here Rafe Hyam owned Parmesan&mdash;or he and  Ike did atween 'em, as it turned out&mdash;an' Parmesan wos in the Hurdle Race (in  the Hurdle Race&mdash;aye! he wos, up to 'is eyes, if the mare ha' bin out of it), so  you can bet your life I kept my eyes an' ears open in case Mr. Ike should try an'  come the double on Mr. Roethorne. I knowed that Ike would never run the <i>two</i> to win&mdash;'e'd ha' bin' a fool if he  did&mdash;an' I couldn't make out why they was graftin' at him a good deal more than  the mare, if they didn't mean spielin'.*</p>
  <p class="quote">*Going  for the money.</p>
  <p>Well,  a few days afore the race, out comes Mr. Roethorne to see his mare. He 'as 'is  missis-that-is to-be with 'im&mdash;as pretty a girl as ever yer set eyes on, an'  that merry an' bright that it ud make a sexton light 'arted jest to see an'  listen to her. O' course they goes into the box an' 'as a look at the mare.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  do you think on 'er, ma'am?&quot; seys Ike to the leddy. &quot;Ain't she a  beauty?&quot;</p>
  <p>An'  she jest claps her 'ands when she sees 'er, an' turnin' to Ike she puts jest  the tips of 'er dainty fingers on 'is shoulders.</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed  she is! A most beautiful creature,&quot; seys she, an' then she seys, her pretty  face turnin' quite grave-like as she speaks, &quot;I 'ope she'll win. It ud  break my 'art if she lost.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roethorne he larfs at this.</p>
  <p>&quot;H'm!  It needn't do that,&quot; seys he. &quot;But she'll win, won't she,  Blosely!&quot;</p>
  <p>An'  Ike, if you'll believe me, lookin' at that dear girl as straight as I'm lookin'  at you this minit, seys to 'er&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;Aye,  that she will. She will if <i>I</i> can make  'er.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank  you so much, Mr. Blosely,&quot; seys she, lookin' real grateful at 'im. &quot;I  feel quite in good spirits agen.&quot;</p>
  <p>Now  I give you my word an' 'onour as they'd 'ardly driven off wen Rafe Hyman comes  puffin' into the yard. He wos very fat, wos Rafe, an' the weather wos pretty  warm, an' as he shook 'ands with Ike he seys&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;Let's  get out o' this d&mdash;d heat,&quot; seys he, &quot;or I'll melt away. Where'll we  go? I want to speak to yer a minit.&quot;</p>
  <p>They  wos standin' at the door of our room, an' Ike looks in.</p>
  <p>&quot;We  can go in 'ere,&quot; he seys. &quot;There ain't nobody in.&quot;</p>
  <p>An'  on that in they goes, alockin' the door arter them.</p>
  <p>Now  I don't know 'ow it come into my 'ed, but sudden-like it flashed on me that some  villainy wos up, an' I made up my mind that I'd know wot it wos. At the end o'  the room furthest from the door there wos two winders, an' tho' the blinds wos  down <i>the winders themselves wos open.</i>  In a twinklin' I'd took off my boots an' 'ad crept round to the winders. I wos  jest in time.</p>
  <p>&quot;Back  'er agen!' I heard Rafe Hyam say, an' he must ha' bin sittin' on Crumpet's bed,  for his woice seemed right in my ear. &quot;He's never done. I laid 'im another  thousand to three hundred last night, an' he'd ha' gone on. The only thing is if  I keep on layin' he'll begin to tumble that the mare's stiff, for he knows as  I've a interest in Parmesan. My brothers laid 'im three thou for me, an' I  daren't trust nobody else.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Keep  on peggin' away,&quot;says Ike. &quot;I'll crack* it wos pure bad luck.&quot;</p>
  <p class="quote">*Spread  about.</p>
  <p>&quot;Who's  goin' to ride her?&quot; seys Rafe.</p>
  <p>&quot;Young  Chipping,&quot; seys Ike.</p>
  <p>&quot;He  rides well, don't he?&quot; seys Rafe.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  wery fair,&quot; says Ike &quot;But if he wos Fred Archer he couldn't win on  'er w'en I've fixed 'er up.&quot;</p>
  <p>Rafe  coughed.</p>
  <p>&quot;There  mustn't be no mistakes,&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>Ike  larfed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Leave  that to me,&quot; seys he. &quot;We don't make any mistakes o' that sort  here.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;All  right, old man!&quot; seys Rafe, confident like. &quot;I like 'em scratched  best, but&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;That's  out o' the question,&quot; says Ike.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  lay the lad &pound;20 to nothin' about Parmesan,&quot; seys Rafe. &quot;It's always  safest to give 'em a bit o' interest in another 'orse.&quot;</p>
  <p>They  went on talkin' for a long time, but I'd heerd enough. If you believe me, I  turned as cold as ice an' then as 'ot as fire, an' so on an' so on four or five  times.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  infernal villins,&quot; I seys, a'most aloud, I wos that indignant, an' then I  creeps round to the mare's box, an' I sits down on the beddin' an tries to  think it out. But thinkin' didn't bring me much comfort, an' arter 'arf a 'our  I feels that miserable as I could ha' near cried. For all that I wos determined  as the mare should 'ave fair play, tho' how I wos to bring it about I didn't  know no more 'n a new-born babe. Sudden I hears footsteps, an' in a moment I 'ad  all my wits about me.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ullo!&quot;  seys Ike. &quot;You 'ere, Chips!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  sir,&quot; seys I, yawnin. &quot;I wos 'arf asleep.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;He  lives with the mare,&quot; seys Ike, larfin. &quot;He's goin' to ride her.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;As  she got any show? asks Rafe.</p>
  <p>I puts  on a long face.</p>
  <p>&quot;She'd  'ave a good enough show if that cove wasn't in it,&quot; seys I, pointin' to a  box across the yard, where Parmesan wos looked arter by Bob Goslin'. An' then I  turns to Ike, an' I seys, &quot;Couldn't you give me the mount on 'im,  sir,&quot; I seys. &quot; It's doosid hard lines to 'ave to ride all the stiff  uns.&quot;</p>
  <p>Both  on 'em larfed.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  think she 'as no show,&quot; seys Rafe.</p>
  <p>&quot;No  more 'n you'd 'ave on foot.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,&quot;  seys Rafe, &quot;you shall be in it a bit. I'll lay you a score to  nuthin.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  winked at Ike, and they larfed agen; but o' course I thanked 'im jest as if I  wos wery pleased.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  couldn't let me ride Parmesan?&quot; I asks agen, well knowin' as Ike wouldn't  put up nobody but Billy Button once his sugar wos on.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  shall 'ave a turn directly&quot; seys Ike.</p>
  <p>As  they walked away I leans my head out o' the half-door.</p>
  <p>&quot;Chips  don't like 'is mount,&quot; says Rafe, with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&quot;He'll  like 'er less wen he tries to set 'er goin,&quot; seys Ike, an' then they both  started larfin fit to bust.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>III.</b></p>
  <p>Wot  wos I to do? That's wot I asked misself over and over agen, for I tell yer I wos  fair flabbergarsted, an' no wonder, at the game as the ojus villains was up to.  Wot wos I to do? All manner of things come into my 'ed, an' wos no sooner there  than somethin' else ud come. I thought o' runnin' away with the mare. I thought  o' barricadin' misself in the stable with 'er, an' keepin' Ike and his mates orf  with the pitchfork or anythin' else as come 'andy. I thought o' flyin' at Ike  an' telling the scoundrel wot I knowed on 'im. But wot I thought on most wos to  rush orf to Mr. Roethorne an' let 'im know wot was up. An' I'd ha done it, too,  if it 'adn't bin for wot Ike 'ad said. &quot;If he wos Fred Archer he couldn't win  on 'er wen I've fixed 'er up. He'll like, er less wen he tries to set 'er goin'.&quot;  Wot did he mean? Wot was he agon' to do? I'd heered o' poison, an' I tells yer  the wery thought on it brought out the sweat on me like a two-year-old filly at  her first handlin'. &quot;No!&quot; says I to misself, &quot;I'll stick to the mare,  an'll take my chance o' bestin' 'im.&quot; And jest as I'd made up my mind who  should walk into the stable but Crumpets, as wos my mate in lookin' arter the jumpin'  'orses.</p>
  <p>Now  I've sed as how Crumpets an' me wosn't over thick arter the first few months as  I jined Ike; but for all that I 'ad more <i>respect</i> for Crumpets than for the whole boilin' of 'em. He wos a wery quiet chap, wos  Crumpets; 'adn't a bad word 'bout nobody, an', as far as I knowed, wos as  straight as a arrow. Directly I seen 'im it flashed on me to tell 'im, an' I  felt a kind o' relief like, an' wondered as I 'adn't thought on 'im before.</p>
  <p>So,  takin' a look round to see as there wosn't nobody a listenin, I jest out an' tells  'im the whole thing, beginnin' with the way as Ike 'ad kidded Mr. Roethorne as  the mare couldn't lose, an' finishin' up with wot I'd heerd pass atween Ike and  Rafe Hyam. I wos that full on it, an' that excited, that I run through' the  whole thing without drorin' breath as yer might say; but when I come to the end  and I stopped short like, an', lookin' at Crumpets, waited to 'ear wot he 'ad  to say. An, if yer'll believe me, Crumpets sat there like a blessed statute  without sayin' a word an' pickin' 'is teeth with a bit o' straw, jest as  careless as if nothin' out o' the way adn't 'appened. It waited arf a minit,  an' then, wen he don't say nothin', I asks 'im straight wot he thinks o' the  bizness, an' why the doose he don't answer.</p>
  <p>&quot;Keep  yer 'air on,&quot; he seys, in his slow quiet way. &quot;Yer won't do no good  a-bustin yerself over it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  Crumpets,&quot; seys I, indignant, &quot;Did yer ever 'ear o' such a piece o'  villainy.&quot;</p>
  <p>Crumpets  looked at me, an' he arf shuts 'is eyes, an' a kind o' smile curls 'is lips.</p>
  <p>&quot;Taint  the first time as he's pulled a 'orse,&quot; seys he, &quot;an' yer ought to know  it, for yer've helped a bit in yer time,&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>That  wos true enough, an' I sed so. &quot;But,&quot; seys I, a good deal more quiet,  for Crumpetses look an' 'is manner 'ad some'ow taken the fire out o' me,  &quot;Mr. Roethorne's 'orses, Crumpets! an' 'im sich a supporter o' the stable.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;O,  it's a jolly shame,&quot; seys Crumpets, &quot;but if yer'll take my adwice  yer'll keep yer mouth shut.&quot;</p>
  <p>An'  with that he turns on 'is 'eel an' wos goin' out. I couldn't stand it no  longer, I catches 'old of 'is arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;Crumpets.&quot;  seys I. &quot;The mare can win if she 'as a show. Parmesan 'as to give 'er  twelve pound, an' he can't give 'er a ounce, for I've riiden 'em both. If <i>you'll</i> give me a 'and we can stop their  little game,&quot; I seys; &quot;an' yer'll do it, won't yer, Crumpets?&quot; I  seys.</p>
  <p>He  looks at me arf a minit.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  yer come that game Ike'll break ev'ry bone in yer body,&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  don't care,&quot; seys I, as bold as brass.</p>
  <p>He  looked at me agen.</p>
  <p>&quot;All  right,&quot; seys he, &quot;that's <i>your</i> lookout. I'll give yer a 'and.&quot;</p>
  <p>That  night jest afore we went to bed he come to me and tells me as Ike 'ad told 'im  as the mare and Parmesan 'ud do a gallop in the mornin'.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  mare's to win,&quot; he seys, &quot;for Mr. Roethorne's to be there.&quot;  Billy Button 'll ride Parmesan. I suppose yer know wot to do,&quot; he seys,  with a wink.</p>
  <p>As we  walks down to the course the next mornin' he comes up alongside. &quot;I  wouldn't say nothin' to Mr. Roethorne,&quot; he seys. &quot;Yer see yer only a  stable lad, an' he believes in Ike, an' 'ud take 'is word afore yours. Keep yer  mouth shut till arter the race. If yer lose there ain't no bones broken, an' if  yer win&quot;&mdash;and then Crumpets larfs an' scratches 'is 'ed,&mdash;&quot;Ike 'll be  that mad that he's as like as not to let the cat out o' the bag himself.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sure  enough, Mr. Roethorne wos there, lookin' as proud o' the mare as a mother o'  her fust babby. He wishes me good mornin' in 'is nice cheery way, an' while  we're saddlin' up 'as a chat with Ike. Jest as I comes near I 'ears Ike say to  'im, &quot;A'most a certainty, sir. I can't see nothink to beat yer. That  cove,&quot; he says, pointin' to Parmesan, &quot;might ha' 'ad a show if she  'adn't been in it. 'Is owner <i>will</i> start 'im,&quot; seys the artful old dog, &quot;but arter they've 'ad their  gallop yer won't be afraid o' him.&quot;</p>
  <p>Jest  as we start he gammons to be shortenin' my stirrip.</p>
  <p>&quot;Make  a good gallop on it,&quot; he says. &quot;Keep with Billy from the jump, an' make yer  run at the turn. Billy 'll manage the rest.&quot;</p>
  <p>Well,  we went at a good gallop, an I beat Parmesan three lengths. I did a lot o' kid,  an' gammoned as I wos tryin' to get ev'ry ounce out o' 'er. I knowed as Billy  never went a yard arter the tarn home, an' I told 'im so wen we wos walkin' the  horses back to where Ike and Mr. Roethorne wos standin'.</p>
  <p>&quot;  'E goes better in company, seys Billy, with a wink. &quot; 'Ave a fiver on 'im,  Chips, for he'll beat you.&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was some talk o' the time not bein fast-rate, an' I seen as Mr. Roethorne wosn't  quite pleased, so wen I gets 'im by hisself I jest tipped 'im the wink as I  could ha' done much better if I'd bin wanted.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  glad to hear it,&quot; he seys, brightenin' up.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  mare'll win in a walk,&quot; I seys. &quot;You needn't be afeard o' that.&quot;</p>
  <p>When  Ike come home (for we'd took the horses straight back to the stable) he come to  me.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wos  that the best as the mare could do?&quot; &nbsp;seys he.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wery  near,&quot; seys I. &quot;If I 'ad 'ad somethin' with me I might ha' got a  little more out of 'er, but wery little.&quot;</p>
  <p>Ike  whistled.</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  she's gone clean orf,&quot; he seys, an that's jest wot I wanted 'im to think.</p>
  <p>The  day afore the race out comes Mr. Roethorne agen in a tyemenjus bustle. The mare  'ad been fair knocked out o' the bettin' the night afore, and 'e'd come to see  wot was up. He made straight for the mare's box, an there, o' course, he finds  me&mdash;'cos I never left it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Is  anything up?&quot; he asks, clean out o' breath.</p>
  <p>&quot;Nothin',  sir,&quot; seys I.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  the doose does it mean, then,&quot; he seys. &quot;Yesterday mornin yer couldn't get two  to one, an' in the evenin' eight to one went a beggin'.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  takes a look round to see as nobody wosn't about.</p>
  <p>&quot;Let  'em lay wot they likes,&quot; I seys. &quot;The mare'll win.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But  they're backin' Parmesan,&quot; he seys, a wipin' 'is fore'ed with 'is  ankercher, &quot;an' the right men, too&mdash;Rafe Hyam an' that lot. He's a strong  fav'rit, an' Hyam laid me two 'undred to one as he'd beat me.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will  he, that's all?&quot; seys I.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  'ud be infernal 'ard luck to be licked by one in the stable,&quot; he says.  &quot;If he's better than the mare, I ought to know it.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  could see he wos in real bad spirits, an' I made up my mind all of a sudden to  spit the 'ole thing out an' take my chance of how he'd take it. An' I'd ha' done  it, too, if at that wery moment Ike adn't come in. Ike 'ad 'ad a drop, an' yer  should ha' heerd 'im pitch. Lord! he <i>did</i> put it in strong, I can tell yer, callin' Rafe Hyam all the damned fools as he  could lay 'is tongue to, an' swearin' by all that wos 'oly as the bloomin' mare  ud walk in.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  suppose I'll lose Rafe's 'orses,&quot; he seys; &quot;an' he's welcome to take  em away for all I care,&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>An'  as he speaks I sees Mr. Roethorne's eyes a kindlin', an' wery nice eyes he 'ad  too, light grey, with wery black lashes, an' he shakes 'ands with Ike, an' seys  he's glad to 'ear as he's that confident.</p>
  <p>&quot;Chips  is as confident as you are,&quot; seys he, larfin', an' then, lookin' at 'is  watch, he seys it's time for 'im to be orf, an' orf he goes.</p>
  <p>Wen  he's clear o' the place in comes Ike into the box agen, an' he starts a larfin'  fit to bust, the tears fair streamin' down 'is cheeks, an' I joins 'im, you can  bet.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  a lark,&quot; he seys. &quot;Wot d'yer think on it, Chips?&quot; An' then he  larfs that 'arty as I thought he'd ha' 'ad a fit, an' started a coffin'. Well,  yer should ha' heered 'im coff. Why he couldn't stop hisself.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  blessed if I ever 'ad to do with such a mug,&quot; he seys. &quot;O Lord! O Lord!  It'll be the death o' me.&quot;</p>
  <p>That  evenin' he goes into town to the bettin' rooms, an' wen he comes 'ome goes round  the stables with Bob Goslin'.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ullo,  Chips!&quot; he seys, &quot;ow's yer mount? The books don't like 'er  to-night,&quot; he seys. &quot;They're layin' any price about 'er. Wot ha' yer  bin doin' to 'er, yer young devil?&quot; he seys, a pokin' me in the ribs.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  jest givin' 'er the finishin' touches,&quot; I seys larfin. &quot;If the books seen  the way she's a tacklin' 'er food to-night, they wouldn't lay a penny agen 'er,  would they, sir?&quot;</p>
  <p>I seys  this by way of a blind, for he'd told me to stuff the mare with all sorts o'  rubbish, bran mash an' green stuff, an' that sort o' thing, an' right glad I  wos wen I seen 'im clear out. Then I whips on the muzzle, an' lyin' down in the  beddin', I never leaves the mare the 'ole night. Lord! I thought it ud never be  mornin', but wen it <i>did</i> come I wos  almost sorry as it<i> 'ad</i> come, I got  that nervous an' excited. Lucky for me things went a bit crooked in the stable  that mornin', Danny Miles gettin' kicked by a two-year-old, and our best  'andicap 'orse gettin cast in 'is box, else I might ha' been twigged.</p>
  <p>Well!  at last it come time to start for the course, an' Ike comes to me, an' a nice  temper he wos in.</p>
  <p>&quot;Everything's  gone wrong to-day,&quot; he seys with a oath as I wouldn't put down in writin'. &quot;There mustn't be any mistake about  you,&quot; he says.</p>
  <p>&quot;Send  the others on a bit ahead,&quot; I seys. &quot;I'll give 'er a bucket o' water.  Jest you watch to see as there's nobody about.&quot;</p>
  <p>An'  then I thinks wot a fool I wos. If he come in he'd give 'er the water in spite  o' me, for he'd ha' twigged in a moment if I wos only gammonin', an 'ud ha'  took me orf the mare as sure as eggs is eggs. But my luck was dead in. He stood  looking over the gate at the 'orses walkin' away, and never turned 'is 'ed  until I called 'im.</p>
  <p>&quot;She  won't catch the judge's heye arter that,&quot; seys I, showin' im the bucket, which  was a'most empty.</p>
  <p>&quot;Take  care as you don't catch the judge's heye over it,&quot; he says larfin'.  &quot;A man's 'ad six months afore this for the likes o' that.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>IV.</b></p>
  <p>I s'pose  everyone as 'as ridden a race remembers every little thing about it the same as  me, but anyway there aint a thing as I've forgotten&mdash;not about this 'ere  race&mdash;there ain't a thing as I'm likely to forget. I could tell yer what clothes  I 'ad on, wot people I spoke to, where I saddled up&mdash;there! I could tell yer  everything! If a man don't remember 'is first mount wot the doose <i>will</i> he remember?</p>
  <p>It  was a lovely day, an' there was a big crowd. The Hurdles was the first race,  an' the bettin' was wery lively, for tho' Parmesan wos a good favrit, there wos  a good many others backed, an' Cinderreller wos a bit fancied for all that  she'd bin fair knocked out for a couple of days or so. Yer see wen 'er clothing  wos orf people seen as there wosn't much amiss with 'er, an' most on 'em liked  'er a deal better than Parmesan as wos saddlin' up next door. &quot;Well! he  may be the best,&quot; seys a young squatter as wos plungin' terrible that  year, to a friend, &quot;but I think I'll 'ave a 'undred,&quot; that's wot he  sed, &quot;a 'undred on the mare I can get ten to one about 'er, an' it's a dev'lish  good price.&quot; An' then he comes alongside me. &quot;I'm goin' to back 'er,&quot;  he seys, &quot;an' I'll lay yer a 'undred to nothin'.&quot; There wos scores as  asked me if I liked my chance&mdash;there always is whatever yer ridin'&mdash;an' I give  'em all the same answer. &quot;The mare 'll win,&quot; I seys&mdash; jest that an'  nothin' more. &quot;The mare 'll win.&quot; An' 'pon me soul I'd got that  confident as I didn't think I <i>could</i> lose.</p>
  <p>Jest  as I wos goin' out into the runnin', Ike Blosely and Rafe Hyam come to 'ave a  look at the mare, an' I could see as there wos somethin' up, Rafe looked that  heated an' excited. When he seen the mare&mdash;an' he knowed a bit about a 'orse,  did Rafe&mdash;he got redder than ever, an' he whispered somethin' in Ike's ear.</p>
  <p>&quot;If  yer don't b'lieve me, ask the lad yer self,&quot; seys Ike, quite short.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  hanged if I don't,&quot; seys Rafe, on'y usin' languidge as aint fit for yer  ears; an' he comes alongside me. &quot;Ha' you got any show?&quot; he asks in a  low voice.</p>
  <p>I  larfs.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wot  show would you have with a bucket o' water on board?&quot; I seys. &quot;An'  bran mash an' greenstuff aint eggsackly the stuff to feed a winner on.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  give a sigh o' relief&mdash;I pledge yer my word he did&mdash;an' went back to 'is mate.</p>
  <p>As  I left the paddock Mr. Roethorne come to me, an' with 'im wos the dear lady as  I've spoken of afore.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  Mr. Chips!&quot; seys she, for she didn't know as Chipping wos my name, an' as I  was ony called Chips for short, &quot;you'll do yer very, very, very best to  win, won't yer?&quot; an' I seen a tear in her eyes for all that she pertended  to larf over it. O' course, I sed as I would, an' I thought to misself as I  looked at them two young people as I'd sooner die than be beaten.</p>
  <p>I'd  bin nervous-like an' queer the whole mornin' for all that I was confident; but somehow  or other, once I wos at the post I wos as cool as a cucumber. Crumpets 'ad  walked across to the start with me, an' on the way we talked as to wot wos the  best way for me to ride. Ike 'ad given me instructions to cut out the runnin'  for Parmesan, an' we come to the conclusion as it wouldn't be a bad plan for me  to go to the front right off, and ride wot they call a waitin' race in front.  I'd drawn a good number; there wos a terrible big field, an' if I rode a waitin'  race I might get blocked, an never set up. So we decided that the mare should  make her own runnin', an' trust to her light weight an good condition to bring 'er  'ome.</p>
  <p>We  wosn't long at the start, an' I tell yer I wosn't the last to get orf. Afore  the flag wos fair down I wos a length an' a arf ahead o' the field, an wot wos  better, next to the rails. I cut out the runnin' at a merry pace for the first  'arf mile, when I must ha' been full eight or ten lengths ahead o' the field,  an' then, findin' as nothin' wos comin' arter me, I took a pull at 'er for a  quarter of a mile or so, an' let the mare selttle down inter wot you'd call a  good stridin' gallop. Two of the Ballarat division lay next to me, but though  they didn't let me get too far away, they didn't take much account o' me,  thinkin' as I was makin' the runnin' for Parmesan, as everyone else did.  Parmesan wos lyin' 'bout three lengths behind them, then there wos a clump of  bout four or five, an' then they tailed off terribly. Jest at the start the  mare 'ad bin jumpin a bit wildly, but arter we'd gone over a couple o' 'urdles  she cooled down an' cleared the le'ps as neat as I could ha' wished. I could hear  the rest on 'em a rappin' away behind me, an' the second time round there wos a  gap or two I promise you, but Cinderreller never laid a toe on nothin'. An' wen  we'd gone nigh on two miles things wos pretty much the same, for all the lads  wos sayin' to themselves as I'd come back to 'em, for, o' course, they'd heard  as I wosn't a spieler, and they wosn't goin' to lose their chance a chasing me.  But wen we'd gone another 'arf mile some on em begun to think as it wos time to  set sail arter me, an' set sail they did. I saw 'em comin', o' course, but I  didn't take no notis. The mare wos goin' strong as a lion, an' as yet I 'adn't  asked her to go. The first un that come to me was the Ballarat big gun, Whitechapel, with Tommy Frost up.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  say Chips, are you on the job?&quot; seys Tommy, meanin' wos I goin' to try an'  win.</p>
  <p>&quot;That  I am,&quot; seys I, for I wosn't goin' to tell 'im a lie.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  devil you are!&quot; seys he.</p>
  <p>All  this time I 'adn't seen nothin' o' Parmesan, an' I 'adn't thought to, for I knowed  as Billy wouldn't come till the turn for 'ome. But jest as we come to the turn  I took a 'urried look an' I see 'im a creepin' up, lyin' abreast o' Whitechapel  as 'ad fallen back a couple o' lengths. Now for it, seys I to misself, an' I  shook myself together, as the sayin' is, knowin' as I'd got my work cut out. Round  the turn we went, me close in 'longside the rails, Whitechapel and Parmesan  lyin' still two lengths behind me. The mare cleared the last 'urdle but one as  beautiful as ever, but, though my ears wos cocked mighty sharp, I didn't hear  Parmesan touch it neither. &quot;By Jove!&quot; seys I to misself, &quot;it's  goin' to be a fight. There <i>ain't</i> no walkin'  in 'bout it.&quot; So I jest niggled at the mare, an' shook 'er up a bit, for I  knowed as at any moment I'd 'ave to stave off Billy's rush, an' the beauty  under me seemed to know wot was wanted of 'er, an' answered me as game as a  pebble. Already I could hear the voices o' the crowd, and I could see the  judge's box, an' my 'art gave a great jump as I thought as I'd only got a  quarter of a mile more. But there wasn't much time to <i>think</i>. I can tell yer, for afore you could say Jack Robinson, Billy  wos on my girths, an' I knowed as I'd got to do my best.</p>
  <p>&quot;Haul  off, will you, you young&mdash;!&quot; shouts Billy with a oath.</p>
  <p>&quot;Haul  off yourself,&quot; seys I, for all my blood wos up.</p>
  <p>I  didn't turn to see 'is face, but it must ha' been a picture.</p>
  <p>&quot;D&mdash;  you!&quot; seys he, only worse than that, an' I heered 'im put the whip into  Parmesan, each stroke goin' like the shot of a pistol.</p>
  <p>I  give the mare a couple o' cuts misself, an' then, puttin' the spurs into her, I  sat down on 'er and rode for my life. For my life! By heavens I had to, for  Parmesan was goin' like a demon, and Billy rode as he'd never done before. At  the last 'urdle I 'ad gained a trifle on 'im, for the mare wos jumpin' over  everythin' in the race that day, an' that 'ad jest got me clear of 'im. But I  wosn't clear long. He was on my quarter&mdash;at my girth&mdash;he got to my shoulder&mdash;an'  then for a hundred yards we wos dead level, or close on it. But all the spirit  that wos in me wos roused to make a last effort, an' 'ard as I'd bin on the  mare it wos nothin' to wot I did the last fifty yards. I couldn't use my whip,  for Billy wos that close to me, so I took hold of her 'ed, an' rammed my 'eels  into 'er. Yard by yard we neared the winnin' post, but there wos Parmesan  wherever <i>I</i> wos, an' I couldn't shake  'im off. Yard by yard as if we wos one 'orse, and the crowd shoutin' like  madmen. Yard by yard till we passed the winnin' post.</p>
  <p>Had  I won? I'm blessed if I knowed. When I pulled up I looked with an anxious eye  to see wot number wos up. Lord! wot a time they wos a puttin' up the numbers.  Ah! there they wos at last. Wot wos it? My eyes wos that dim, I could scarce  see. Number 9. That wos me. I'd won! I'd won! I'd won!</p>
  <p>&quot;You  imp of hell!&quot; says a voice in my ear. &quot;Ike'll break <i>ev'ry</i> bone in your body.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  wos Billy Button, but I didn't answer. Wen a man's won a race like that he  don't take no notis of a bit o' temper.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>V.</b></p>
  <p>Ike  Blosely wosn't at the weighin' in, an' I tell yer I didn't perticler want to  see 'im. Billy Button 'ad sed as he'd break ev'ry bone in my body, an' as I  rode up to the scales the words rang in my ears, and I thought as like as not  he <i>would</i>. But wen Mr. Roethorne came  to take the mare's 'ed an' sed, &quot;Well done, Chipping! You rode a grand  race!&quot; an' so on, I forgot all about Ike. Lord! what a ringin' cheer went  up wen it wos &quot;All right!&quot; at the scales, an' wot a greetin' I  received from the crowd. An' so did Billy, for the matter o' that, an' deserved  it, too, for he'd rode <i>the</i> race of  'is life.</p>
  <p>It  wos Crumpets as led the 'orse out o' the weighing yard. As we passed inter the saddin'-paddock  he give a anxious look about.</p>
  <p>&quot;You'd  better be off 'ome,&quot; seys he. &quot;Ike'll break ev'ry bone in yer  body,&quot; them wos the words <i>he</i> used&mdash;funny, wosn't it?&mdash;&quot;if he catches you while 'is blood's up.&quot;</p>
  <p>Jest  at that wery moment up comes Danny Miles.</p>
  <p>&quot;My  word Chip, you're in for it!&quot; says he with a whissle. &quot;Ike's clean mad.  He an' Rafe Hyum as jest 'ad a fite.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;A  wot?&quot; I seys, for I knowed they wos that thick.</p>
  <p>&quot;A  fite!&quot; he says agen. &quot;Wen you won Rafe comes at Ike foamin' at the mouth  an' callin' 'im all the thieves and rogues as he could lay 'is tongue to. 'You've  ruined me, you d&mdash;d scoundrel,' he seys, an' he flies at Ike's throat. 'Dont be  a fool,' seys Ike, shakin' 'im orf, but Rafe was fair mad an' went for 'im  agen. Then Ike stood orf, an' give 'im a couple in the mouth, as'll make 'im wery  careful 'ow he cleans 'is teeth the next week.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  laughed, not quite comfortable, yer understand, but still I laughed. Crumpets, he  looked grave, an' turned to me agen.</p>
  <p>&quot;Get  orf 'ome,&quot; seys he, &quot;or keep out o' the way. If Ike catches yer  yer'll 'ave a bad time of it.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  didn't like the thought o' leavin' jest then, for tain't often as yer 'ave a win  like that, an' it's pleasant to stand about an' listen to the nice things as everyone  says to you. But Crumpets wos that earnest that I took 'is advice, an' cleared  out at once.</p>
  <p>Crumpets  wos the first to turn up arter the races, an wery soon arter 'im come all the  rest o' the lads. Of course, all the talk wos about the Hurdles, for all that we'd  won the Derby, and wot Ike would do to me wen he caught me. If I wosn't frightened  it wosn't their fault. Then wosn't one of 'em as didn't swear, like Billy  Button, as Ike would break ev'ry bone in my body. Not one! Yes! there wos Crumpets, 'as 'ad bin standin' by listenin' an' never sayin' a word, come  sudden to my side.</p>
  <p>&quot;Keep  yer pecker up,&quot; he says, layin' 'is 'and on my shoulder. &quot;He can't  kill yer.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  words wos 'ardly out of 'is mouth wen we heered the gate o' the yard bang to.  We wos all in a little inner yard atween the house an' the stables, an' afore  you could look round Ike Blosely rushed in, his eyes fair startin' out of his  head.</p>
  <p>&quot;Where's  that young devil?&quot; he yells with a oath, for he didn't see me for the  moment, as I was standin' alongside Crumpets. &quot;Ah! there you are, d&mdash;  you!&quot; he yells, louder than ever, and he rushes at me with 'is fists clenched  an' with murder in 'is eyes.</p>
  <p>Now  I don't know wot come over me for the moment. I've heered o' animals bein' that  scared as they's parrylised, an' I suppose as summat o' the same thing 'appened  to me. Anyways, I never stirred a peg, but stood there like a stuck pig. The'  next moment I was lying on the ground, with the blood pourin' from my nose and  mouth, an' a couple o' teeth&mdash;them two, sir, yer see the gap&mdash;down my throat.</p>
  <p>Wen  I come to&mdash;an' I wosn't 'arf a minit lyin' there&mdash;I'm blessed if there wosn't  Ike and Crumpets at it as 'ard as ever they could.</p>
  <p>Jest  for a moment I looks on, and then, all of a sudden like, my blood got up, an I  jumps up and rushes at Ike. I wos too late. Crumpets slipped at the moment, an'  Ike, catchin' 'im a tremenjous upper-cut, landed 'im five yards away, where he  lay like a log, an' never took no more part in the biz'niss. On that Ike turned  on me, an', drorin' back 'is great fist, made as if he'd knock me down agen.  An' knock me down he <i>would</i> ha' done  'adn't a strong arm shoved me aside, an' another kept Ike at a distance. It was  Mr. Roethorne.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  the doose does this mean?&quot; he asked angrily, takin' a 'asty glance at Ike,  at Crumpets, at me, an' then at Ike agen.</p>
  <p>Ike  stood there like a wooden man, never sayin' a word. But if he'd meant to speak he'd  'ad to be mighty smart, for the words wos hardly out o' Mr. Roethorne's mouth  afore I'd rushed up to 'im, an', catching 'old on him, 'ad told 'im the whole  biz'ness. I 'adn't cried when Ike 'ad 'it me&mdash;and he'd 'it me precious 'ard, I  can tell yer&mdash;but now the tears fair streamed down my cheeks, an' my woice wos  that thick I spoke by jerks as it were.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  all along o' my winnin' with the mare,&quot; I says. &quot;She was a stiff un,  sir, an' he told me not to win. W'en he come 'ome he knocked me down,&quot; I  seys, puttin' my 'and to my bleedin' face, &quot;an' knocked Crumpets  down.&quot; I seys, pointin' to the poor old chap as 'adn't moved since he  fell; &quot;an&mdash; an'&mdash;an' he'd ha' killed me if&mdash;if&mdash;if you 'adn't come wen you  did.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  see a frown come on Mr. Roethorne's face, an' his grey eyes went clean black.</p>
  <p>&quot;Is  this true?&quot; he says, turnin' to Ike, an' gently pushin' me back.</p>
  <p>There  wosn't no need to ask if it wos true. The truth wos written in Ike's mean eyes  as plain as print.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roethorne drew in a big breath.</p>
  <p>&quot;You scoundrel!&quot; he says. &quot;Put up your 'ands.&quot;</p>
  <p>Afore  you could say Jack Robinson there they wos at it; 'ammer an' tongs, an' me lookin'  on, a-ringin' my 'ands an' beggin' Mr. Roethorne to knock off.</p>
  <p>&quot;He'll  kill you sir,&quot; I shrieks out, dancin' about as if I wos mad. &quot;He'll  kill you!&quot;</p>
  <p>For  all that Mr. Roethorne ud ha' given 'im 'is work to do from wot I've heerd  since, 'ad it bin left to the two of em. But as I've sed I was clean mad, an'  catchin' up a shovel that wos lyin' there, I swung it round my 'ed, 'an puttin'  all my strength inter the blow brought it down on Ike's ed. He jest giv' one  cry, an' then fell all on a heap as if he wos dead.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roethorne snatched the shovel from my 'and an' chucked it to the other end o'  the yard.</p>
  <p>&quot;Lend  us a 'and 'ere, you lads,&quot; he seys to Bob Goslin an' the others. &quot;We'll  carry 'im inter the house.&quot;</p>
  <p>When  they'd carried Ike inter the house he comes back to us, an' the first thing as  he did wos to 'ave a look at Crumpets.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  lad's badly 'urt,&quot; he seys. &quot;He must go to the orspitle. My trap's  outside. I'll take 'im. You'd better come with me too, Chips.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was a long drive from Ike's to the orspitle, an' it seemed longer cos we drove  wery slow. Mr. Roethorne 'eld poor old Crumpets in his arms the whole way, an'  I seen 'im give many a anxious glance at 'is face. But he didn't say nothin',  only once he asked the man to drive a bit more careful.</p>
  <p>W'en  we got there they carried 'im in. I wos for givin' a 'and, but Mr. Roethorne  told me to keep where I wos, so' I jest sat in the trap an' waited for 'im to  come out. An' a long time he wos, an' w'en he <i>did</i> come he'd a face as long as your arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;This  is a bad bizness,&quot; he says. &quot;A bad bizness.&quot;</p>
  <p>We  drove to Scott's 'Otel, an' he takes me up to 'is room, an' arter I'd 'ad a 'ot  bath an' a cup o' tea with a glass o' brandy in it, he makes me sit down in a  arm chair.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  Chips.&quot; he says, &quot;I want you to tell me the whole thing. I know  you'll tell me the truth,&quot; he seys, &quot;an' remember it <i>is</i> the truth, an' only the truth, as I  wants to 'ear.&quot;</p>
  <p>So  I jest told 'im all about it, an' if you'll believe me he sat there an' never  sed a single word, not as much as sayin' wot a willin Ike wos, nor swearin' as  you might ha' expected considerin' the way as he'd been treated.</p>
  <p>&quot;This  is a bad bizness,&quot; he says agen w'en I'd finished, an' that wos all.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>An'  that's about all as I 'ave to tell you, though I s'pose as you expects me to  let you know wot come of Ike, an' Crumpets, an,' maybe, misself afterwards.  Well, Ike wos laid up in bed for a couple o' weeks, an' went about with 'is  'ead in a bandage for another couple o' weeks, an' to this day he as a partin'  in 'is 'air as 'ain't been made by a comb. At first Mr. Roethorne 'talked o'  bringin' 'im afore the stewards, but he wos that kind-'arted that w'en it come  to the p'int he let him orf. &quot;He's bin punished enough,&quot; seys he, an'  he let it drop.</p>
  <p>Crumpets  'ad a bad time, an' no mistake. Poor old chap, he wos orf his 'ed arf the time,  for he 'ad wot them doctors call&mdash;wot is it?&mdash;'cussion o' the brain, an' 'tween  you an' me he ain't right in his 'ed even now at times.</p>
  <p>An'  me! Wot come o' me?</p>
  <p>&quot;Chips,&quot;  seys Mr. Roethorne to me the wery next day, &quot;I've taken my 'orses away  from&mdash;from that man's!&quot; I could see he couldn't abear to speak Ike's name,  &quot;an' I've got an idea.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; seys I, for he'd stopped an' &nbsp;wos a pluckin' at 'is moustache.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  oughter know somethin' 'bout trainin' a 'orse now,&quot; he seys, &quot;an' I'm  goin' to start you in life. I've heered o' some nice stables as is to let, an'  I'm goin' to set you up as my trainer; that is you an' Crumpets  together.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  jumped out my chair an' caught 'im by the 'and, an' there wos tears in my eyes,  an' no gammon.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  you are a brick, sir,&quot; I cries, an' he laughs an' seys he's glad to 'ear  it.</p>
  <p>An'  set us up he did, an' we've got the best stables there is about, an' if you  don't believe me&mdash;why come out an' see 'em.</p>
  <p>There,  that's all, except&mdash;Well! I may as well tell yer.</p>
  <p>One  day as I went to see the old feller at the orspitle, wot wos my surprise to see  a pretty girl sittin' 'longside the bed with Crumpets's 'and in 'ers, and a  lovin' look in 'er eye. &quot;Ullo!&quot; says I to myself, &quot;Wot's  this?&quot; for you see Crumpets wosn't wot you'd call a ladies' man, an' I'd  never seen 'im speak to one in my life.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  all right, Chips,&quot; he seys in his quiet way, an' larfin more'n he'd larfed  for many a day. &quot;It's ony my sister Jessie.&quot;</p>
  <p>So  I goes up an' shakes 'ands with 'er, 'an for a minit or so gammoned to be  lookin' at the old chap. But, Lord bless yer 'art, I ain't the bit o' stuff as  can sit 'longside a girl like 'er 'an not look at 'er, 'special wen she wos the  sister o' sich a friend as Crumpets. So 'tween whiles I stole a look at 'er,  'an the more I looked at 'er the more I liked 'er. She 'ad light brown 'air in  ripples on 'er fore'ed&mdash;none o' your fringes but nat'ral curly&mdash;she'd a pair o'  merry eyes as danced even in that dim light, 'an a face as bright 'an a skin as  fair as a bloomin' baby o' six months. If <i>you'd</i> bin there you'd a looked as 'ard as <i>I</i> did.</p>
  <p>Ain't  I puttin' it in a bit strong? Well! if you don't believe me come an' see 'er  for yerself, for Jessie Crumpets&mdash;or rather Jessie Isles&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;you've guessed  it, an' you're right&mdash;is Mrs. Chipping, 'an wot's more, the best wife in the  wide, wide world.</p>

  <h1><a name="dot"></a>DOT:  A REMINISCENCE.*</h1>
  <h3>BY  GEORGE HURDIS PURVES.</h3>
  <h3>Published in The Australasian (Melbourne, Vic.)<br>
Saturday, March 16, 1889</h3>
  <p class="quote">* A  pathetic interest attaches to &quot;Dot.&quot; The following note by Mrs.  Purves accompanied the M.S., which was entirely written in pencil:&mdash;&quot;My husband  intended to make this little story run into five or six chapters, but when  suddenly the doctors found it necessary to have an operation, he thought of a  different ending for it. He finished it the day before the operation, and read  it over the next morning&mdash;the day he died, I may say, for he only lingered in agony  of mind and body. He told me to send you the story if anything happened to him,  and to write and tell you it was the last thing he wrote.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>I.</b></p>
  <p>&quot;ESSCHEN!  ESSCHEN! ESSCHEN!&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was so need to bawl out the name of the station as far as I was concerned, or  to tell me that there was a stoppage of 20 minutes, or to announce that all  baggage would have to be removed to the Customs shed for examination. The train  had no sooner left Roosendaal than I had begun to get ready for the coming  detention and examination, and even before we stopped at Esschen all my  packages&mdash;they did not amount to much&mdash;were deposited on the seat opposite me.  When the porter flung the door open I at once secured his services (I was  riding first-class, which a Continental proverb declares is only used by  Englishmen and princes, and therefore was looked on as &quot;a good  mark&quot;), and handing him down my things, stretched myself a couple of times,  and then leisurely followed him to the Customs shed. &quot;The large baggage  would be unloaded immediately,&quot; so we were informed at intervals by the  head officer of the Customs, who likewise politely advised all those who had  trunks to get their keys ready.</p>
  <p>I  stood back leaning against the wall and watched the crowd with no little  amusement, especially those of my unfortunate countrymen who could not speak  French. There was one family especially that almost monopolised my attention,  so flurried, so impatient, and so little versed in the ways of travelling were  they. They <i>all</i> had different ideas of what should be done; they <i>all</i> wanted  possession of the keys: and they one and all bitterly regretted that Sam, who  probably was a relation, was not there to get them out of their difficulty.</p>
  <p>&quot;To  think of the money that's been spent on 'em, Jane,&quot; said the father, wiping  his perspiring forehead with one hand, as he pointed to two schoolgirls and a  lad of eighteen or so with the other, &quot;and not one of 'em able to say what  these infernal fellows want.&quot;</p>
  <p>Seeing  a countryman in a fix, I stepped forward, and in a few minutes put matters  right. The whole family were so profuse in their acknowledgments that (having  had my own packages marked) I made my way to the refreshment-room, through  which all passengers had to pass to the train, to escape their thanks. But as I  turned away, my hat being still raised as I took leave of them, I came face to  face with a lovely girl, who had evidently not only watched the scene, but  watched it with no little enjoyment. There was a twinkle in her eye of the  keenest appreciation, and though on meeting my glance her face became at once  comparatively demure and grave, a smile hovered still about the corners of her  mouth. I fancy that my eyes brightened as I saw the merriment in hers, but as I  could not stare her out of countenance, I moved past her and gradually was hustled  and bustled into the refreshment-room.</p>
  <p>The  face was such an unusually pretty one that as I placed my things on a seat I  turned round towards the door by which I had entered, and by which I knew she,  too, must come in, determined not to lose an opportunity of seeing her again.  And very carefully I watched too, for she was of such diminutive size that I  thought it quite possible that she might pass by in the crowd and that I might  miss her. I was not kept waiting long. Two minutes after I had entered I saw  her deftly making her way amongst the tough, pushing crowd, with her lips just  sufficiently parted to show her bright, even teeth, and a slight colour of  excitement in her cheeks. She was carrying a medium-sized bag and a parcel of  umbrellas, parasols, etc., and was making her way with difficulty. I was just  on the point of proffering my services, when to the amusement of the  bystanders, no less than her own, she let all the baggage fall to the ground,  and as a bright colour came into her pretty cheeks, and a look of  uncontrollable merriment into her eyes, began to laugh as if the whole thing  was an excellent joke.</p>
  <p>Now  I have said that I was on the point of proffering my services. I had, in fact,  made a step or two towards her. Directly, then, that I saw her luggage fall  from her hand, I made a dive for the things, and rescued them before any damage  was done. The next moment she was beside me, and as she sat down with a sigh of  exhaustion on a bench close by, she thanked me with no little warmness for the  assistance I had rendered. Of course I made light of what I had done (taking  the opportunity of having another good look at what was the very prettiest and  most captivating little face I had ever seen in my life), and professed my  willingness to do anything I could for her. She gave me a smile of gratitude,  and then laughed again even more heartily than before, but what she laughed at  I did not then discover. Just then the doors leading to the platform were  opened, and the guard of the train requested the passengers to take their  places. The announcement had for the moment distracted my attention from the  girl, and when I turned round again she had risen to her feet, and was  preparing to tackle her bundles again, little as she had shown herself competent  to carry them before. But even before I noticed this I had caught sight of her  face, and was rather amused to see that the look of gaiety had given way to a  thoughtful and even business-like expression. She was pursing her plump little  lips, her brows were contracted, and indeed the whole of her face denoted that  she was debating a knotty point.</p>
  <p>&quot;Can  I do anything for you?&quot; I asked again. &quot;Please allow me to carry  those bundles.&quot;</p>
  <p>She  hesitated for a moment, and then apparently made up her mind. She looked up  into my face with a trustful pleading expression in her eyes, and then, coming  quite close to me, said in the very lowest voice</p>
  <p>&quot;I've  noticed your good nature, sir, twice since we left the train. Would it be too  much to ask you,&quot; she here faltered, but looked at me more pleadingly than  ever, &quot;to do me a further favour?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  protested my perfect willingness in a tone the genuineness of which was not  open to doubt.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well  then, it's just this,&quot; she said, still speaking low, but at a great rate.  &quot;I got in at Rotterdam, an', of course, as I was only a girl travellin'  alone, a great big porter got hold o' me and shoved me into the first  first-class carriage he came to. I'd only mounted the first step when I saw the  company wouldn't suit, but the porter went gabbling on at me&mdash;and in Dutch, too,  the wretch, which he must have known I did not understand&mdash;and just fair shoved  me into the car. The door had hardly closed when the train started. There were  five in the carriage already&mdash;you know them, the five you helped just now&mdash;an'  what room they weren't occupyin' they'd stuck their traps on. I looked  round&quot;&mdash;she here turned her pretty head round, so that I caught a sight of  her exquisite little profile&mdash;&quot;but, they never offered to move, or make a  place for me. The father was deep in a newspaper, the mother was knittin' a  family shawl, the boy was readin' a novel and suckin' an orange, and the two  girls were eatin' peppermint at such a rate that I thought they meant breakin'  the record.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  girl here burst into a merry laugh not a loud one, but a crisp, joyous chortle  that was pleasant to hear. The moment she had opened her lips I had known she  was an American; and though, perhaps, her conversation may not read well, I can  pledge my word that it was delightful to listen to. Her face was so alive with  merriment that it alone would have held one spell-bound, as, indeed, it did me  for the time being, had not the gruff voice of a porter peremptorily summoned  the passengers to take their places.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  you want to get away from these people?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p>She  nodded vigorously.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  get into another carriage,&quot; I proceeded.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  that's just it,&quot; she intercepted with a grave face, as we made for the  platform. &quot;The porters say there isn't another seat anywhere.</p>
  <p>Now  it so happened that I had a <i>coup&eacute;</i> to  myself. What could I do but offer it to her? I did so on as polite terms as I  could.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  shall easily find a place elsewhere,&quot; I added.</p>
  <p>She  caught hold of my arm.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ain't  there room for both?&quot; she asked in surprise.</p>
  <p>I  hesitated a moment</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,  yes!&quot; I answered at length. &quot;But you see I'm alone, and&mdash;and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  what do you want to go for!&quot; she asked, opening her eyes to the widest  extent. &quot;I'd like you to stay,&quot; she added emphatically; &quot;and&mdash;and,&quot;  here she laughed right merrily, &quot;you ain't goin' to run away from  me.&quot;</p>
  <p>There  was no time to argue the question, had I been anxious to do so, which, indeed,  I was not.</p>
  <p>With  a smile, I gave in, and we got into the carriage. The door was closed, the  train started, and I was left alone with my pretty little acquaintance. Just  for the moment I felt the situation rather awkward, but my little friend, for  all that she looked but a schoolgirl, soon set me at my ease.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  what comes first?&quot; she exclaimed with quite a grave air. &quot;Oh!  allotment of seats. Which side will you have?&quot;</p>
  <p>I said  it was a matter of indifference.</p>
  <p>&quot;All  right!&quot; she said. &quot;I'll take the seat with the back to the engine.  You don't get any sparks there, an' have a chance of keepin' yourself clean.  Now you understand, sir, that that is your side, an' this is mine. Now, the  next thing,&quot; she said in a tone that implied that she had arranged the  whole programme, and that this was especially a matter of grave moment &quot;is  the introduction. I think,&quot; she said, after some consideration, &quot;that  you had better introduce yourself first.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  happened to have my card-case in my pocket, and taking out a card presented it  to her with a bow.</p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot; Sir Charles Crossley-Crossley,<br>
&quot;Dim&eacute; Oaks.&quot;</font></p>
  <p>She  looked at the card, then at me, then at the card again. Her face was quite  grave, and she bit her lip.</p>
  <p>&quot;Are  you a lord?&quot; she asked, her pretty eyes opening their widest.</p>
  <p>&quot;No,  indeed!&quot; I laughingly answered. &quot;Only a baronet, but my&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>I  have often wondered since whether our acquaintance would have become as intimate  as it did had I finished the above sentence. I do not wish to disguise  anything, and will at once acknowledge that at the time I was a married man, My  wife was entitled to the prefix &quot;Lady&quot; in her own right before I  succeeded to the title, and it was this little fact I was on the point of  divulging.</p>
  <p>&quot;But  my&mdash;!&quot; she repeated after me, still holding the card up, but looking at me  with great interest.</p>
  <p>I  laughed at her persistence, and then mumbled out something about a cousin of  mine being a lord. But I am afraid that I blushed a little as I spoke, for I  instinctively knew, even as the words left my mouth, that my sharp little  friend knew perfectly well that I had kept something back from her.</p>
  <p>She  stopped just a moment, and then took another look at the card.</p>
  <p>&quot;A  baronet ain't much, is it?&quot; she asked, playing with the card. &quot;Bout  the same as a colonel or judge with us?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  could not help laughing, but explained that there were baronets and baronets,  and that there were plenty of families who bore no title at all who were of  very old stock indeed, going back, indeed, much further than half the peerage.</p>
  <p>As I  entered on this explanation she fell back in her seat with a disappointed look.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  I am sorry you ain't a lord,&quot; she said with a sigh. &quot;I've always been  dyin' to meet one. Yes! just dyin'! An' what am I to call you?&quot; she asked,  &quot;for I'd never be able to say all this without keepin' the card in my  hand.&quot;</p>
  <p>She  looked so puzzled that, from a smile, I broke into a hearty laugh.</p>
  <p>&quot;Call  me Sir Charles,&quot; I said. &quot;<i>That</i> won't be a great tax on you. And now for <i>your</i> introduction.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you think Geraldine a pretty name?&quot; she asked with an anxious look in her  eyes,</p>
  <p>I  vowed that it was my favourite name.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  then, <i>that</i> ain't my name!&quot; she  said with the glee of a schoolgirl who has caught her master. &quot;What do you  think of Doretta?&quot; she asked again.</p>
  <p>I  shook my head.</p>
  <p>&quot;Once  bitten, twice shy,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now  this time you are wrong,&quot; she laughed, &quot;for Doretta <i>is</i> my name; an' if you hadn't made that  pretty speech over Geraldine, you could protest that <i>Doretta</i> was your favourite name. Well! my whole name is Doretta Vanloo,  an' what do you think of it?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  said it was a very pretty name.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  if I tell you something more you'll promise you'll never make any use of  it.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  protested against being asked to enter blindfold into any bargain. But she  insisted, and in the end I gave way.</p>
  <p>&quot;Strike  your heart!&quot; she said.</p>
  <p>The  formula was new to me, but I obeyed. &quot;The boys call me Dot,&quot; she said  gravely.</p>
  <p>&quot;Because  you are so sm&mdash;,&quot; I began.</p>
  <p>&quot;No!&quot;  she interrupted, with a vicious little stamp. &quot;Because it's short for  Doretta.&quot;</p>
  <p>After  this we drifted for a time into a general conversation from which we were each  enabled to pick up some information. We thus found that we were each bound for  Brussels by that night's express; that her party was only to join her on Friday  night (it was then Monday); that I expected my &quot;friends&quot; (thus, I  admit, I was mean enough to designate my wife and two thumping boys) over on  Saturday; and that neither of us knew a soul at Brussels. I had asked, and  gained, her permission to look after her things at Antwerp, and there was some  sort of arrangement that I should act as her <i>chaperon</i> in the train to Brussels.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  long do we stop at Antwerp?&quot; she suddenly asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;About  an hour and an half,&quot; I answered, &quot;and a great nuisance it is.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  you may think so, but I don't,&quot; she exclaimed vehemently. &quot;I've had  nothing to eat since breakfast. It was then five o'clock, an' I tell you, sir,  that have somethin' to eat I <i>will</i>,  whatever it is an' wherever I get it.&quot;</p>
  <p>Referring  to B&aelig;decker, I named several restaurants quite near the station, which were  recommended, with the all-powerful asterisk.</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose  we try Bertrand?&quot; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&quot;We!&quot;  she exclaimed, raising her eyebrows. &quot;I thought it was me that was  hungry.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  explained that I, too, had not eaten since breakfast, and proposed that we  should have our meal together. But to this she would not at first listen. She  had no objection to travelling with me to Brussels, or to me looking after her  luggage, &amp;c., but to deliberately set out and eat a meal together was a  very different affair.</p>
  <p>&quot;Is  there a <i>buffet</i> at the station?&quot; she  asked.</p>
  <p>I  replied haphazard that there was not, and renewed my entreaties for her to join  me. For a time she resolutely refused, but in the end she gave in a little,  suggesting that we should walk on opposite sides of the street, and should have  our meal at separate tables. And to this arrangement I was forced to accede.</p>
  <p>Arrived  at Antwerp I gave our luggage in charge of a porter, and we started on our  divided way. But after we had walked a few hundred yards the whole thing seemed  so ridiculous that we both, as we looked from time to time at each other across  the wide street, began laughing immoderately. Suddenly the little lady stopped  and beckoned to me with her parasol.</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,&quot;  she said, laughingly, &quot;this is just too ridiculous. I give in, but  mind,&quot; she added firmly, &quot;I'm to pay my share.&quot;</p>
  <p>Seeing  the little woman so independent, I had to agree to this, and we quickly made  our way to Bertrand's. Just as we turned in at the door she plucked my sleeve,  and, turning round I beheld the family from which I had rescued her at Esschen.</p>
  <p>&quot;We're  done for,&quot; she said. &quot;The two peppermint girls spotted us.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Whatted  us?&quot; I exclaimed, in surprise at such a phrase in the mouth of a young  girl.</p>
  <p>''They  saw us,&quot; she corrected herself quickly, and then added with a pout--&quot;You are partic'lar.&quot;</p>
  <p>We  sat down and ordered something to eat, and though it was &quot;between  meals,&quot; as the head waiter informed us, we were very well satisfied, thanks,  I fancy, to a tip that I gave that indispensable functionary. I must say that  my little friend did justice to the meal, though she managed to get through a  deal of talking between the courses.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I feel real good now,&quot; she said as we left to catch the train, &quot;an'll  last till supper.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Till  supper!&quot; I said. &quot;Shall you be hungry again to-night?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I guess I will,&quot; she answered, as if it was a matter of course.</p>
  <p>On  our way to the station I bought her some chocolate. As we stepped out of the  shop we came face to face with the father of the family already mentioned, he  paid no attention to me, but he cast a look of undisguised contempt at my  companion. His intention was so unmistakable that I felt no little indignation,  and but for the restraining hand of my little friend should undoubtedly have  given him a piece of my mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  mind that,&quot; she said, with a twinkle of enjoyment in her eyes; &quot;I've  had all the best of him.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;How  so?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Did  you see me drop that heavy bag o' mine at Esschen?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I took care it was in a plumb-line with his toes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  it was our friend who swore then?&quot; I laughed.</p>
  <p>The  little lady nodded and laughed.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  shouldn't ha' liked to ha' missed the shot,&quot; she said. &quot;He was  complainin' o' corns the whole way.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  said something about her being a little savage, but I laughed all the same.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>II.</b></p>
  <p>There  were very few passengers for Brussels, and I had no difficulty in arranging for  a carriage to ourselves. The train was some little distance from where our  luggage had been left, so after seeing the little American into the carriage I went  off with the porter to claim our luggage. When I came back I found her reading <i>B&aelig;decker</i>&mdash;my <i>B&aelig;decker</i>&mdash;which she immediately threw on to my seat.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I'm real glad you've come,&quot; she exclaimed with a yawn. &quot;I was gettin'  tired o' bein' alone, and I've read that fellow,&quot; she pointed to the  discarded guide book, &quot;until I just know him by heart&quot;</p>
  <p>Just  then a boy put his head in the carriage-window and asked us if we wanted any  fruit or papers.</p>
  <p>&quot;Have  you a <i>Brussels</i> paper?&quot; she asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  Mademoiselle,&quot; he answered. &quot;<i>L'Etoile  Belge</i>, to-morrow's edition.&quot;*</p>
  <p class="note">*All  Belgian, and most French, papers publish three editions daily, &quot;L'Edition  du Matin,&quot; &quot;L'Edition du Soir,&quot; and &quot;L'Edition de  Demain.&quot;</p>
  <p>She  pulled out a neat little purse and paid him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,&quot;  she said, as she scanned the columns; &quot;I guess this is 'bout the on'y thing  that these foreigners beat us at. Ain't it mighty handy,&quot; she laughed,  &quot;to buy to-morrow's paper, if you only do get the news o' the day before  yesterday?&quot;</p>
  <p>As  she looked down the columns she repeated all the headings, making a running  commentary, as she went, on what the several articles contained. I sat looking  at her with an amused smile, and more decided than ever that she was the  loveliest little thing that I had ever met. Perhaps her nose did not belong to  any recognised style of beauty, but to my mind it was the only nose to suit her  face. Perhaps her mouth was just a trifle large, but had it not been one might  have missed the sight of the most perfect set of teeth that ever ate chocolate  (which they were doing at that very moment). But these defects, if defects they  were, would only have been noticed by an hypercritic; and if the mouth had  pleaded its own cause, aye, and that of the nose, it would have gained a  verdict from any jury&mdash;I mean a jury of men&mdash;in the world. As for her hair, her  eyes, and complexion, they were perfect. No jury of British matrons could have  condemned <i>them</i>. She had taken off her  hat, and the wind just caught her hair and played with a hundred mutinous  ripples that clustered about her temples. What hair it was! How profuse! How  perfect in colour! And how naturally yet suitably coifed.</p>
  <p>And  her dress! It was simple enough, and yet I never saw a more charming or  becoming <i>costume de voyage</i>.  Everything, from her hat to the hem of her skirt, was red and blue&mdash;the  brightest red, the deepest blue. I can't say in what proportion the colours  were used; I can't say how it was made; and still less can I tell you what it  was made of. But I can aver&mdash;and I am not considered a bad judge of such things&mdash;that  the <i>tout ensemble</i> was perfect, and  that bright as the contrast was, having once seen the effect, no one would have  wished her otherwise dressed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah! here we are!&quot; she cried. &quot;Now we will see what's goin' on. No  opera! There never is in summer. Two theatres open&mdash;the <i>Eden</i>, that's a new theatre with naughty plays, an' <i>I</i> can't go; an' the <i>Moli&egrave;re</i>, which is just a bit too stiff an' starchy for me. The  opera band four nights a week in the park. I know the place!&quot; she  exclaimed with no little animation. &quot;You sit under the trees, an' eat  ices, or drink the <i>sherry gobbler</i>, as  they call it, or the <i>whythe wine gobbler</i>;  or the <i>whischkey cocktails</i>, an'  listen to the music. Ah! <i>Joseph Dupont</i> is conductor, so the music is sure to be good. Do you like music?&quot; she  asked.</p>
  <p>I  assured her that I was passionately fond of it, and saw that the warmth of my  assertion gave her no little pleasure.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, <i>I</i> just live for it!&quot; she sighed.  &quot;What sort do you like?&quot; she asked, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  pretty well all sorts, so long as it's good music well played.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!  but what composers, do you like best?&quot; she asked, anxiously.</p>
  <p>I  hesitated a moment, dreading to plump too irrevocably for any particular  school, lest my ideas should not coincide with hers. But Miss Dot (I had  received permission from her at Antwerp to use that form of address) awaited my  answer with such evident impatience that I made a bold plunge.</p>
  <p>&quot;I think I prefer Liszt, and Berlioz, and Schumann, and especially Wagner.&quot;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes had lit up afresh at each name, but when I named Wagner she actually leapt  to her feet and danced for joy. Then as suddenly sitting down, she began to  tell me the effect which the works of such composers produced on her.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah,&quot;  she cried, clasping her little hands together; &quot;give <i>me</i> something that makes you feel&mdash;that makes you go hot an' cold  almost the same time, that makes you so excited that you can't keep your seat,  that makes your hair go out o' curl, an' that finishes you up in one round, as  the boys say. An' that's what their music does. Do you know that Hungarian  Rhapsody&mdash;I don't know its number, I think it's two or four but it goes like  this,&quot; and she began to sing the air.</p>
  <p>I  nodded an assent</p>
  <p>&quot;You  know it begins&mdash;quite&mdash;slowly,&quot; she proceeded, dwelling on the last two  words to add effect to the description, &quot;and the same strain is repeated  over an' over again in a quaint, unearthly sort o' way, and then come the  twiddles.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Twiddles!&quot;  I exclaimed laughingly, but still catching her meaning.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  twiddles!&quot; she answered sharply. &quot;What do <i>you</i> call them? Well, <i>they</i> go on for a bit, and jest when you're beginnin' to think you're bein' fooled,  an' are gettin' that impatient that you could run a pin into the fat gentleman  before you, the whole orchestra breaks into a furious tune, that makes you jump  clean out o' your seat, and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sit  down again!&quot; I venture to suggest</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't  steal American jokes,&quot; she said sharply, and added seriously, &quot;If you  can joke at all about it you don't feel it as I do. You should see <i>me</i> when <i>I</i> hear it. I get that excited I can't keep my seat&mdash;special if it's  a spring one&mdash;an' I bound about just like quicksilver. I always tell whoever I  go with to look after me, for I declare to goodness I'm not responsible for my  actions.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  laughed heartily at her excitement, and said that I hoped that I might be  fortunate enough to see her on an occasion of the sort.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  but I'm worse, much worse, when they're playin' the overture to 'Tannhauser,'  &quot; she proceeded, with even increased animation. &quot;Then I'm just  dangerous. I never dare go except with folk I know real well. Directly the  orchestra strikes the first note I'm off. Bang! bang! bang! goes my heart as if  it wanted to join in, an' I put an extra spike into my hat lest my hair should  raise it off. Before they've finished the first theme there I am clean mad. An'  how shouldn't I be? Why, the mere lookin' at the orchestra's enough to do it.  After they've kept their hair on for about two minutes they begin to get  excited. Then you hear spirits moaning in the 'cellos and shrieking in the clari'nets.  Well, after they've been goin' it a bit like so many Will-of-the-wisps gone  mad, the brass in the band can't stand it any longer. Then <i>they</i> begin, an' don't you know it too! That starts the fun. As the  horns, cornets, and bassoons fill their cheeks till they look like so many  young balloons, the violinists are caught by the fever, an' don't they just get  it bad. Forty or fifty at once start to try and saw their violins in half with  the bow, an' the violins just shriek back at 'em as if they was really doin' it.  An' the more the horns bellow, the more the violins shriek, why the more the  conductor hops about in his box as if he was dancin' a jig barefoot on a  red-hot stove, an' lookin' sometimes at the brass, sometimes at the strings, as  if to say, 'Come on, you ruffians! I'm ready for you.' Oh!&quot; finished the  little lady with a sigh out of all proportion to her diminutive size; &quot;It's  just <i>too</i> lovely!&quot;</p>
  <p>I had  roared with laughter (the expression may be taken almost literally) as she  gabbled off this animated description, and for a time I could hardly pull  myself together to speak. At last I was sufficiently master of myself to put a  question.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  what becomes of you at the end of the performance?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,  sir, I <i>have</i> been found sittin' on my  neighbour's knee,&quot; she said simply.</p>
  <p>Soon  after this we drifted into a conversation about travelling, and I found that  she had been in pretty well every important town of Europe. I could hardly  believe my ears as she rattled off the names of the places she had been to. Up  to that time I had considered myself a great traveller, but here was a girl  half my age who could give me a good start and a certain beating. I looked at  her in amazement, and rubbed my eyes. Had she been a woman of forty her  information, her memory, and experiences would have been remarkable, but here a  mere chit of a girl&mdash;. Well, I had heard that the Americans were a go-ahead  people, but I had never recognised the truth of the assertion so fully as I did  then. I purposely and perhaps a little meanly put questions to her about  out-of-the-way places that I happened to know well, but she always answered  without the slightest hesitation, and added further particulars which always  proved her case. I had tried to puzzle her, and &quot;as the boys would say,&quot;  to adopt her expression, she had polished me off in one round. I just looked at  her in amazement and sank back on the seat.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I'll be&mdash;,&quot; and then I just stopped in time.</p>
  <p>&quot;You'll  be what, sir?&quot; she laughed. &quot;You'll be what Sir Curiosity?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Why,  where the&mdash;I mean how the&mdash;I mean when have you found time to visit all these  places? Do you travel night and day.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Just  depends!&quot; she said, &quot;If it's hot I like the night cars; if it's cold  the day ones.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But&mdash;you&mdash;don't&mdash;mean&mdash;to&mdash;tell&mdash;me,&quot;  I said, sitting up and emphasising each word, &quot;that you travel about just as  you are, alone and unprotected?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No,  I don't mean to tell you,&quot; she said, drily. &quot;Anyway, what do you want  to know for?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  shrugged my shoulders with an air of indifference, which I indeed did not feel.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  I just wanted to know, you know,&quot; I said, inadvertently making use of a  favourite slang phrase of the day.</p>
  <p>She  laughed a pert little laugh, showing those pretty teeth to the best advantage,  and tilted her high straw hat at what I may term an alarming angle over her  brows. Then she looked at me from under the brim.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  perhaps he <i>shall</i> know, you  know,&quot; speaking, upon my honour, as if she were soothing a child.  &quot;Have you ever played Diddle-dee, Diddle-dee, Do?&quot; she asked quite  seriously.</p>
  <p>&quot;No,  indeed!&quot; I exclaimed emphatically. &quot;But I'm afraid that I'm a little  old to start learning any new games.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  no! Not a bit!&quot; she said, shaking her pretty little head quite gravely.  &quot;Any child could learn it. Now just you listen, and don't you forget. You  play it on your fingers. You ask the question three times, and after each time  you say '<i>Diddle-dee, Diddle-dee, Do</i>,'  and if the last <i>Do</i> comes on the  little finger or thumb you win. If it comes on one of the other three I  win.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But,&quot;  I urged, &quot;you have three fingers to my two.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;An'  so I ought,&quot; she laughed, &quot;see the size of yours?&quot; and she held  up her diminutive hands to emphasise the disparity. &quot;Besides, it's only  three to two, an' that's fair odds, so the boys say. Now, then, I'm off. 'Shall  I tell him? <i>Diddle-dee, Diddle-dee, Do</i>.  Shall I tell him? <i>Diddle-dee, Diddle-dee,  Do</i>. Shall I tell him? <i>Diddle-dee,  Diddle-dee, Do</i>.&quot;</p>
  <p>She  held up her first finger. I had lost. I protested that she had cheated&mdash;for she had  gabbled off the incantation at such a rate that it was impossible for me to say  what finger the fatal <i>Do</i> had come on.  She made me then do it myself, lending me one of her tiny hands on which to  operate. The result was the same. I then averred that she had purposely framed  the sentence so that I should lose. But she protested, both then and  afterwards, that I had had &quot;a fair show.&quot;</p>
  <p>Vilvorde  was passed, and looking at my watch I saw that we had only a quarter of an  hour, if that, before arriving at Brussels. I had made up my mind&mdash;in fact, I  thought I could not do less&mdash;to offer to see Miss Dot to her hotel, and proposed  the matter to her as a matter of course, asking her where she stayed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  I've been thinkin' if I ought to tell you,&quot; she said, meditatively;  &quot;but I'll tell you what we'll do.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No  more <i>Diddle-dee, Diddle-dee, Do!</i>&quot;  I interrupted, hastily.</p>
  <p>&quot;No,  no!&quot; she laughed. &quot;We'll each mark the name of the hotel we are going  to stop at in our <i>B&aelig;decker</i>, an' there  we <i>must</i> stay, you understand, an'  there's no altering it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;All  right!&quot; I said.</p>
  <p>&quot;Strike  your heart!&quot; she exclaimed, earnestly.</p>
  <p>Again  I complied with the strange request.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  name of <i>my</i> hotel is already  underlined,&quot; I said, handing her the book; &quot;so just mark yours and  compare them.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oh!  the antics the little monkey went through before she would perform her part of  the bargain. She huddled up the book against her, and kept looking at me,  pencil in mouth, over the back of it. She turned her back to me, and suddenly  looked round to see if I was looking over her shoulder. She went to the other  end of the carriage and nestled right in the corner so that the possibility of  detection amounted to <i>nil</i>. But none  of these positions suited her. She was sure I could guess from the position of  her fingers, and the probable position of the pencil on the page, which hotel  she proposed marking; At last she insisted that I should turn my back. Even  then the performance took some little time.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  sir, you can turn round,&quot; she announced, as she caught up my book which was  still lying on <i>her</i> seat; &quot;but  I'm to have first look.&quot;</p>
  <p>Suiting  the action to the word, her nimble fingers soon found the place in my book.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  mean, horrid thing!&quot; she cried, with an impatient shrug of her shoulders,  and an indignant little pout, as she closed the book with a slam. &quot;You  knew where I was going, and you just&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>I  interrupted with an assurance that a friend had marked it for me before I left  England.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  you will go somewhere else!&quot; she pleaded.</p>
  <p>I  pointed out that that was impossible. My people&mdash;I still adhered to that phrase&mdash;were  going to join me at that very hotel.</p>
  <p>&quot;An'  so are mine!&quot; she said dolefully.</p>
  <p>For  a moment or two she was silent and downcast, but it was not her nature to  remain either silent or sad for long, and in a minute or two she was herself  again.</p>
  <p>&quot;Perhaps,  after all, it's for the best,&quot; she said. &quot;You can act as my  protector, you know, an' keep troublesome people off. How old are you?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  was so taken off my guard by the question that I actually answered it without  protest&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thirty-six!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Thirty-six!&quot;  she repeated. &quot;Well, now, what will you be? I mean what is the best thing  for you to be? You look too young for a father; besides that, you wouldn't like  it&mdash;it would wound your vanity, and there are other objections. You'd have  to call me Dot, and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot; Then she suddenly broke off. &quot;The same  objection applies to a brother, and an uncle. I have it!&quot; she cried.  &quot;You shall be my trustee, and I your ward. If that comes to the ears of  our people, it can be easily smoothed over.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  said to myself that it might easily be smoothed over, as far as her people were  concerned, but I drew a mental picture of my wife's face on receiving the news  which was anything but reassuring.</p>
  <p>&quot;There's  no necessity for them to know it at all,&quot; I suggested in a tone of assumed  indifference, which I feel certain lacked the true ring, for I saw an amused smile  light up my companion's face.</p>
  <p>We  had only a few minutes left before we reached Brussels, and during that time  the little lady's behaviour was in marked contrast to her previous liveliness.  She sat as quiet as a mouse (she was not unlike that frisky little creature, by  the way), biting her lips, and with an air of reflection and gravity that was  rarely met with there. Nor did this demeanour change when we arrived at our destination.  We were going to the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe, and there was an omnibus to take us and  our effects. I helped her in, jumped in myself, and off we drove at a good  pace. But still her face was quite grave. I did my best to arrive at a reason  for this sudden change of manner, but for a time could not divine any  satisfactory one. Suddenly, however, it struck me that, being a mere schoolgirl, she had now got frightened at the length to which her joke had been  carried, and was apprehensive of the future. Under the circumstances, and  perhaps more especially because I did not like to see such a cloud on her  pretty brow, I made her what I considered a generous offer. I said that, after  all, it would not inconvenience me to stop at another hotel till Friday night,  and indeed, seeing the situation caused her annoyance, that I should prefer to  do so. She absolutely refused.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  nice an' kind of you to think of it, Sir Charles,&quot; she answered  gratefully, &quot;but a bargain is a bargain. Besides,&quot; she added, &quot;it  won't make two cents difference.&quot;</p>
  <p>Arrived  at the hotel I took a room for my little friend&mdash;my ward she was henceforth to be&mdash;and ordered her boxes to be taken there.</p>
  <p>Soon  afterwards I saw her tripping up the stairs after the chambermaid, having  promised to meet her in the reading-room immediately &quot;she was fixed  up.&quot; Then, with a budget of letters in my hand, which I had found on my  arrival, I went up to my room to have a wash and peruse my correspondence. Though  I skipped a good deal of the letters&mdash;even of my wife's, who, to be candid, is a  somewhat diffuse correspondent&mdash;it was some time before I got down to the  reading-room. The next moment in came Miss Dot, looking brighter and more  charming than ever; Her hat was off, and her hair seemed to add a new charm to  her beauty.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,  my ward,&quot; I said, sitting down near her. &quot;I want you to enjoy  yourself. I'm told there's a concert in the park. Would you like to go?&quot;</p>
  <p>I  saw a bright light come into her eyes, and as suddenly go out.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do you think we dare?&quot; she asked.</p>
  <p>I  protested that no one was likely to see us, that everyone went, and that we  would pass unnoticed in the crowd. At last she consented, and ran off for her  hat and coat. Two minutes afterwards she arrived and announced herself as  &quot;ready.&quot; Surely there never was a woman who dressed to such perfection!  Every new thing she wore seemed to suit her better than the last. Her hat and  coat seemed to me the prettiest articles of the kind I had ever seen, and I  told her so.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm  so glad,&quot; she said, giving me quite a grateful look. &quot;I'd like to  look nice when I'm going ta-ta with my trustee.&quot;</p>
  <p>On  which we both laughed.</p>
  <p>Well!  we went to the concert, which, I must acknowledge was not up to its usual  standard of excellence, and which did not excite Miss Dot to the extent I  expected. We ate ices, drank coffee, I&mdash;at Miss Dot's request&mdash;smoked a cigar or  two, and we chatted merrily till the concert was over. I enjoyed the concert  none the less&mdash;call me conceited fool if you will, but I wish to confess the  truth&mdash;that I could not help seeing the great admiration that my little friend  excited. As I caught sight of appreciative glances or overheard whispered  phrases of admiration I felt what I may term a pleasant feeling of  proprietorship in my little companion; and, in fact, I do not know that I did  not tell her so.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  about the supper?&quot; I asked, as we left.</p>
  <p>She  laughed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I could eat somethin' if it was handy.&quot;</p>
  <p>That  was enough. I got a cab and drove to the hotel, and having got the address of  the best restaurant went there at once. What a supper we had! What dear little  dishes! What fruit and wine! But, above all, what merry jokes and conversation!  I felt quite sorry to have to break up the feast, but a clock which confronted  me forced on me the impropriety of &quot;keeping it up&quot; any longer. I  ordered a cab, and two minutes afterwards we were on our way home.</p>
  <p>As  we shook hands on going to bed Miss Dot thanked me warmly for the pleasant-day  she had spent.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you know why I knew I could trust you&mdash;why I felt sure you were a gentleman?&quot;  she asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;No,  indeed!&quot; I laughed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!&quot;  she said quite gravely, &quot;when I got in at Esschen I knew you had been  smoking. Now all the way from there to Brussels I know you were <i>dying</i> to smoke.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I  was!&quot; I admitted with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes!  an' you never asked my permission. Then I knew you were a gentleman. If you  could make a sacrifice like that&mdash;not even asking a permission I should readily  have accorded&mdash;I knew you were a man to be trusted, an' I trusted you.  Good-night, Sir Charles.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  watched the little fairy trip up the stairs, and then turning into the  smoking-room took out my budget of letters, which I had only half read. But it  was long before I could bring myself to read them. The events of the day had  been of such a remarkable nature that they <i>would</i> thrust themselves on my mind. And it was the same when I went to bed. I could  think of nothing but Miss Dot and the adventures of the day. I admitted that as  a married man I had allowed myself to be flirted with (I protest the phrase is  the right one) rather more than I should; that I had even encouraged her in her  &quot;quips, and cranks, and wreathed smiles,&quot; and that I had most  certainly not attempted to restrain her from first to last. But, I urged in  self-defence, what opportunity had I of shaping things otherwise? what else  could I have done? and, finally, what harm had come of it? And it was with  thoughts such as these that I at last fell asleep.</p>
  <p>I  awoke late next morning, and my toilette did not take as long as usual. I  thought Miss Dot might be waiting for me, and I hurried down. There was no one  in the <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>. There was no  one in the reading-room. I sent up to her room. The waiter returned with a  message from the chambermaid that <i>Mademoiselle</i> had left very early.</p>
  <p>&quot;You  mean gone out,&quot; I suggested.</p>
  <p>The  waiter shrugged his shoulders. The chambermaid had said <i>Mademoiselle</i> had <i>left</i>.</p>
  <p>I  rushed to the office. The news was true enough. Miss Dot had left for Paris by  the early train. I stood for a minute looking at the man&mdash;astounded, speechless,  incapable of action or thought Then, turning on my heel, I gave vent to but one  word, but it was a word of great strength.</p>
  <p>I  never saw Dot again&mdash;indeed, I never heard of her. I asked Americans without  number&mdash;and I cultivated Americans for the express purpose&mdash;if they could give me  any information, but Miss Doretta Vanloo was utterly unknown. Finding my  researches so fruitless, I have latterly ceased an active search, hoping to  come across a trace of her accidentally. But I fancy somehow that Dot and I  will never meet again. I even doubt at times whether we ever did meet.</p>

  <h2>BEING  AN ADVENTURE WITH A TIGER.</h2>

  <p align="center"><b>I.</b></p>
  <p>I  think I may say, without laying myself open to the reproach of boastfulness, that  the little house to which I took my wife on my marriage was as snug a little  home as the most exacting bride could demand. Not only was it comfortably&mdash;even  luxuriously&mdash;furnished within, but the garden and surroundings were in excellent  order. Creepers covered the pretty little rustic porch, and here and there  encircled the window. Behind the house, surrounded by shrubberies, was a  charming lawn, on which we sometimes played croquet. Behind that was a kitchen  garden, plentifully supplied with fruit trees, and behind that again the  stables, the doors of which opened on a small back street. The country town in  which we lived was noted for its pretty suburban residences, and ours was  admitted to be one of the prettiest.</p>
  <p>Now,  though I was comfortably off, I had spent so much money on the little place  that I did not at first contemplate keeping a carriage, wishing by judicious  thrift to recoup myself the large outlay before I entered on further  expenditure. But somehow I never walked to the end of the garden and saw the  empty stables than I was conscious of a longing to see them filled. If my wife  happened to be with me on these occasions and as we had only been married  eighteen months at the time of my story, she naturally frequently was&mdash;this  longing was intensified, for Jemima had a way of making little observations  which served to bring the matter more forcibly to my mind. &quot;Oh! If we <i>only</i> had a little carriage!&quot; or  &quot;Oh! how I <i>love</i> horses! If we <i>only could</i> afford to keep them!&quot; or  again, &quot;When you have recouped the expenses of the house, dear Jacob, you  will let me have a tiny, tiny, tiny,&quot; these adjectives Mrs. Oilcake in  those days emphasised with little tender touches under the chin, &quot;carriage  of my own, won't you?&quot; So one evening that the empty stables looked more  reproachful than usual, we were walking round the garden after dinner, I forgot  all my prudent resolutions and, quite as much to my own astonishment as my  wife's, came out with an offer which was to be pregnant of results. </p>
  <p>&quot;Do  you know, Jemima, I have made up my mind to let you have a carriage.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh!  you darling! Oh, how delightful!&quot; exclaimed my wife with a beaming face,  clapping her hands.</p>
  <p>&quot;We  need only keep a boy,&quot; I continued as if to excuse my seeming extravagance,  &quot;and when he's not wanted to groom or drive, he can help in the garden,  wait at table, and so forth.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You'd  have a pair of ponies and a basket-carriage, won't you, Jacob?&quot; exclaimed my wife,  putting one arm round my neck, as, with the other she fondled my willing cheek.  &quot;A pair of ponies have been the dream of my life.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well!  I don't know about a pair of ponies,&quot; I answered as I kissed her dimpled  cheek. &quot;We'll see! I'll ask your brother John. <i>He </i>knows all about horses.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  did ask brother John.</p>
  <p>&quot;Pair  of ponies and a basket-carriage be hanged!&quot; rudely snarled brother John.  &quot;What <i>will</i> Jemima want next?&quot;</p>
  <p>Rather  subdued by brother John's manner, I hesitatingly ventured to inquire it he thought  it inadvisable to keep that sort of turn-out.</p>
  <p>&quot;Inadvisable!&quot;  he shouted, in a tone that aggravated the dread that I already entertained of  the man. &quot;Of course I do! What you want is a quiet medium-paced cob and a neat  little gig.&quot;</p>
  <p>Even  in face of this positive assertion I ventured to hint that a gig, though a very  pleasant conveyance for a man, was not the most suitable for a lady.</p>
  <p>Brother  John gave me a look that froze me.</p>
  <p>&quot;I  thought that you came to me for advice,&quot; he said curtly. &quot;I don't <i>think</i> that a gig is best for you&mdash;I <i>know</i> it is. A pony-chaise is well enough  for a girl, or an old married couple, but a sledge in summer-time would be just  as useful to you. Your wife will have her household and her children&mdash;I use the  plural, old man, for you won't keep to the singular long&quot;&mdash;he here gave me  a dig in the ribs and gave his great laugh&mdash;&quot;to look after. What does she  want with a pony chaise.&quot;</p>
  <p>When  I left brother John I asked myself the same question, and the more I considered  it the more I came round to his views. &quot;What does she want with a  pony-chaise?&quot; I exclaimed again and again. I was still debating the matter  when I ran into Blosely, whom I look upon as an incarnation of <i>Ruffs Guide</i>, and to whom in a few words  I explained matters.</p>
  <p>&quot;How  curious!&quot; he said. &quot;There's the very thing, as far as the horse is  concerned, going to be sold to-day at Tattersall's. He's a bay cob, a good  trotter, pretty as a picture, carries a lady, belonged to my brother once. He's  a real treat to sit behind, and as sound as a roach. The gig, you know, you can  get any time. By-the-by,&quot; he added, as he looked at his watch, &quot;you  must be sharp or you won't be in time.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  thanked Blosely profusely and jumped into a hansom, intent on making the  purchase. All the way to the auctioneer's I repeated the &quot;points&quot; of  the equine treasure I coveted, until I had them off by heart. &quot;Bay  cob&mdash;good trotter&mdash;pretty as a picture&mdash;carries a lady&mdash;belonged to Blosely's  brother once.&quot; At first indeed the sentences got confused, and I occasionally  made Blosely's brother &quot;a good trotter,&quot; or &quot;as pretty as a  picture,&quot; but by the time I arrived at the sale yards I had &quot;got him  off&quot; so accurately that I was satisfied I should recognise my cob out of  fifty.</p>
  <p>There  was a large crowd round the ring, where the horses were being paraded prior to  sale. I crashed my way to the front, and at last found myself in a position  whence I could see the animals led into the ring and sold. I borrowed a  catalogue from my next door neighbour&mdash;who I may state smelt strongly of the stables,  and whose eyes I noticed never stopped blinking&mdash;and began to run through the  lots in order to find out the one of which I was so anxious to become the  possessor. To my surprise&mdash;my consternation&mdash;I found lot after lot which would  suit my friend's description. Why there was lot 7, lot 8, lots 14 to 20, lot  32, lots 39 to 47, there were any number of lots that would exactly  &quot;fit&quot; Blosely's brother's cob. They were <i>all</i>, as it seemed to me, <i>bay</i> cobs. <i>All</i> carried ladies. <i>All</i> were good trotters. <i>All</i> were quiet, and <i>all</i> were, no doubt, though it did not expressly state it, as pretty  as pictures. I handed back the list to my odoriferous neighbour with a sigh. He  gave a searching look at me, as he put the catalogue into his brimless cap, and  asked, deferentially enough, if he could do anything for me.</p>
  <p>How <i>could </i>I have been so stupid. Why here  was the very man to help me. I plunged into the whole affair at once, finishing  up of course with the inevitable description. &quot;He's a bay cob&mdash;a good  trotter&mdash;pretty as a picture&mdash;carries a lady&mdash;belonged to Mr. Blosely's brother  once. <i>Do</i> you know him?&quot;</p>
  <p>The  man took a long look at me before answering&mdash;his eyes blinking the whole time.  There was no mistaking his profession. He was an ostler, if ever there was an  ostler in this world! At last, when I had given up any hope of receiving a  satisfactory answer, I  heard a voice which proceeded from&mdash;well! I don't know exactly whence it did  proceed, but some very low part of his body&mdash;exclaim in a contemptuous tone,  &quot;<i>Do</i> I know 'im?&quot;</p>
  <p>Upon  this, without vouchsafing me any further information, he blinked away at me as  if I were an electric light, or something of the sort, of which his eyes could  not bear the strength. And curious eyes they were&mdash;devoid of eyelashes, and with  bright red lids. I was getting impatient when the same stomach-generated voice  surprised me with an observation&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;Stop  'ere, sir! Dun't move! I'll see vich lot yer frien's oss is.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  patiently awaited my friend's return, and watched meanwhile the efforts of the  auctioneer to obtain good prices. A clever little fellow he was, too, with, it  seemed to me, a prodigious memory. Bays and greys, browns and chessnuts, mares  and ponies, carriage horses and draught horses succeeded each other in rapid  succession, but the energetic little salesman knew them all immediately, and  enlarged on their merits in the most surprising way. Nor was he in the least  put out by the constant <i>fusillade</i> of  jokes and banter to which he was subjected by the idlers amongst the crowd,  but, single-handed, parried all their chaff, and gave them at least as good as  they gave. He was describing the merits of a brown mare, and I was wondering what  more he <i>could</i> say, even when my cob was  &quot;put up,&quot; when my weak-eyed friend returned.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,&quot;  I cried, &quot;what number is he?' </p>
  <p>The  man, stroking his stubbly chin with his hand, blinked at me as if he were  blinking for a wager.</p>
  <p>&quot;E's  sold,&quot; he said, &quot;a hower ago.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  could not help showing my disappointment, and probably made use of an oath. My  friend meanwhile observed me carefully, blinking away as usual. At last he  said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;Ef  yer wants 'im pertickler, I thinks as I cud get 'im, but it 'ud cost&mdash;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  d&mdash; the cost!&quot; I recklessly cried&mdash;I'm positive that I used an oath this  time. &quot;I've set my heart on him. I <i>must</i> have him.&quot;</p>
  <p>At  this the ostler gave a low whistle. He then informed me that the horse had been  bought by a man that he knew slightly, and who was &quot;allers open ter make a  profit,&quot; and suggested that we should go immediately to his  &quot;place,&quot; lest the horse should be snapped up in the meantime.</p>
  <p>So  off we went (in a hansom, too!), my strongly-smelling friend and myself. Highly  disagreeable as close quarters with him were, I solaced myself with the  reflection that before night that cob would be mine. At last we stopped in the  lowest part of the town, at a small public-house in a back slum, at the rear of  which were situated some dirty little tumble-down stables. My friend got out,  and telling me to wait, went in to arrange preliminaries with the recent  purchaser of the cob. In ten minutes or so he returned, and bidding me jump  out, we went together to the stables. Here another man met us, almost the  double of my friend the ostler in personal appearance, and&mdash;gracious heaven!&mdash;with  the same eyes! I looked from one man to the other, and rubbed my own to make  sure that I was under no delusion as to the blinking of theirs. No! there they were.  Four blear, bloodshot, blinking eyes, with the same absence of lashes, the same  redness of lid!</p>
  <p>&quot;Good  God!&quot; I exclaimed, addressing the last comer, &quot;what on earth is the  matter with your eyes? Are you brothers?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Lor'  bless yer, no!&quot; he answered in, to my astonishment, much the same  stomachic voice as the other. &quot;My name's Tubbins, 'is is Sudds. We ain't  no relations wotsummerdever. Yer see, sir,&quot; he went on, pointing to his  eyes, &quot;our heyes gits this 'ere way from our trade, likevise our woices,  vich, yer'll observe, ain't eggsackly wot yer'd call soprarnees. Ven a man goes  inter 'oss dealin', sir, 'e relinkervishes all claims ter beauty.&quot;</p>
  <p>Our  business was explained in a few words, and at first I was afraid that our trip  would be a fruitless one. Mr. Tubbins was very sorry to disappoint me, but 'e  'ad bought the cob to the order of a nobleman in the country, whose custom was  worth a &quot;power of money.&quot; It had taken him months to pick up the  thing he wanted: <i>The cob was worth his weight  in gold</i>: and so forth. I was very much put out, and was on the point of going,  when my first acquaintance whispered me that &quot; 'e'd putt it right.&quot;  Taking Mr. Tubbins by the arm, he led him away to a little distance and began  talking to him earnestly.</p>
  <p>I  have no idea what pressure Mr. Sudds brought to bear on the seemingly obdurate horse-dealer,  but presently they came towards me again, Mr. Tubbins's face wearing a very long  look, that of Mr. Sudds being equally bright.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's  all right,&quot; groaned out the latter, in what he meant to be joyous tones.  &quot;Yer kin 'ave 'im.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Tubbins, who apparently had not regained his good humour, gruffly requested us  to &quot;go inter the box, an ave a look at the blamed varmint&quot; (which  possibly is stable slang for &quot;bay cob&quot;), and you may be sure I was  not slow to do so.</p>
  <p>Now,  I was ashamed of myself for it at the time; but I must confess I was rather  disappointed in the cob. Indeed, I had admired many of the horses which I had  seen that day much more than the one before me. I don't know whether it was  that I had had my hopes raised too high&mdash;that I had expected too much&mdash;but I  found it impossible, utterly impossible, to work myself up into enthusiasm over  the animal before me. I repeated, I believe aloud, the description, so often  quoted, that Blosely had given me of his brother's wonderful horse&mdash;&quot;a bay  cob, a good trotter, pretty as a picture, carries a lady, belonged to his  brother once,&quot; and tried to make it tally with the horse before me.</p>
  <p>He  was a bay cob&mdash;nobody could deny that, and a precious ugly bay too, according to  my ideas. He <i>might</i> be a good trotter,  though, if he was he belied his looks; he <i>might</i> carry a lady, though I could not imagine any lady selecting him as a hack; and  doubtless he <i>had</i> belonged to Blosely's  brother. &quot;But I'm d&mdash;d if he's as pretty as a picture,&quot; I said to  myself, &quot;and all the Blosely's in the world would never convince me that  he is!&quot;</p>
  <p>However,  Mr. Tubbins and Mr. Sudds were never tired of descanting on his good points, drawing  my attention every minute to some new beauty, so that ultimately I began to  come round to their views. As I grew familiar with his appearance I began to  think that, perhaps, I had judged him too hastily. I reflected that, after all,  I knew but little about a horse; that this horse would not have a reputation  like he had unless he was something out of the way, and that Blosely, who was  a racing man, should certainly know &quot;what's what&quot; in horseflesh.</p>
  <p>We  adjourned to the public-house to come to an agreement as to the price. Mr.  Tubbins asked a great deal more that I had anticipated, or than I was willing  to give, but, at last, thanks I must say to the representations of Mr. Sudds,  he agreed to abate his demands, and condescended to accept an increase of thirty  per cent on the sum which, he himself told me, he had that very day given for  him. Even this he only consented to take on condition that he should be paid at  once, and that I should accept delivery of my purchase that day.</p>
  <p>Now  I had intended to have got Blosely or brother John&mdash;both acknowledged judges of  a horse&mdash;to see the cob before I actually closed for him, but, afraid lest he  should slip through my fingers, I paid there and then for the horse, and wrote  out a sale-note and a receipt for the purchase money, which Mr. Tubbins signed.  The former was filled in from data supplied by Mr. Tubbins, and within an hour I  drove off the proud possessor of (to quote the sale-note) &quot;Pepper, by  Saucebox out of All-spice,&quot; whom I knew to be, although the sale-note did  not state it, &quot;a bay cob, a good trotter, and as pretty as a  picture,&quot; and who &quot;had belonged to Blosely's brother once.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Sudds, whose eyes were now blinking at such a rate that it had become a matter  of impossibility even to guess at their colour, was left at the stables with  instructions from me to bring the cob home early the next morning but one, and  to receive his reward for the services he had that day rendered me.</p>
  <p>'&quot;Is  sire wos a great 'oss!&quot; Mr. Sudds informed me as I left, pointing his  thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the stables.</p>
  <p>I  was glad to hear it. I remembered Horace's maxim,<i> &quot;Est in equis patrum virtus,&quot;</i> and I hoped that,  notwithstanding his looks, my purchase might have inherited some of the great  qualities of his illustrious sire.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>II.</b></p>
  <p>Now  I had made up my mind that I should give &quot;my little wife&quot; (it is as  well to adopt the phraseology of the time), a pleasant surprise. It was my  intention not to speak of my new purchase until I should present him at the  front door, in all the accompanying glory of new harness and a new gig. Placing  the utmost faith in Sudds, who I felt confident would never leave his precious  charge until he had delivered him safe and sound into my keeping, and, being  excessively anxious to complete all my purchases before night, I rose betimes  the next morning, and, after an unusualy early breakfast, hurried off to town.  Two courses were open to me, or rather I had the choice of placing myself under  an obligation to one of two men&mdash; Blosely or brother John. Family ties would  have dictated the choice of the latter, but having, as I have said, a &quot;wholesome  dread&quot; of the man, I unreservedly plumped for Blosely, and rushed off to  see him.</p>
  <p>I  found him in bed&mdash;which I might have expected. When I roused him out of what he  called his &quot;beauty sleep,&quot; and explained to him how urgently I  required his services, he utterly refused to stir for &quot;an hour or so&quot;  (you know what that means), stating that there was &quot;lots of time in the  afternoon! What was the good at waking a fellow up in the middle of the  night?&quot; I managed, however, in the end to extract <i>some</i> information, and was informed that if I went to Bunsel, the  well-known whipmaker, he would put me in the way of getting a boy, and give me  (that indefinite quantity called) &quot;any amount&quot; of information as to  how a trap should be kept, and what was wanted so to keep it. Blosely having  made this effort, turned on his side and fell asleep.</p>
  <p>In  Bunsel I found a highly respectable and obliging tradesman, and thanks to him I  was soon in the way of getting everything necessary to make my turnout  complete. Under his advice I bought a gig, which he declared a regular bargain,  and which, curiously enough, considering the proposed destination of the bay  cob when I bought him&mdash;had been made for &quot;a nobleman in the country.&quot;  I thought that under the circumstances the cob and gig were bound to match. I  also bought harness, whips, horse-clothing, and a host of other things, which  Bunsel, in whose hands I unreservedly placed myself, declared indispensable. He  said he could even provide me with a boy.</p>
  <p>&quot;Call  back here at one o'clock,&quot; said he, &quot;and I'll have a tip-top young  tiger for you.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  was very near protesting that I did not want anything of the sort, for I had no  idea what &quot;a tip-top young tiger&quot; was&mdash;though I should certainly have  said that the tiger I had seen the Sunday before at &quot;the Zoo&quot; was a  tip-top one&mdash;but I promised Bunsel that I would be there punctually at one  o'clock, and I was.</p>
  <p>&quot;Here,&quot;  said Mr. Bunsel, as he placed his broad hand on the shoulder of a lad standing  by his side, &quot;is the young tiger what I spoke to you about.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  looked at him attentively, and, to tell the truth, discovered but little of the  tiger about him, for he was in appearance&mdash;and subsequently proved himself to be  in character&mdash;a modest and quiet young fellow. There was a good deal more of my  acquaintances of the previous day about him than of any wild animal. His eyes  were not so red, and&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;didn't blink to the extent that those of  Sudds and Tubbins did, but still they were red, and <i>did</i> blink, and there was a sort of promise held out by them that,  if all went well with them, they might even attain at maturity the perfection  arrived at by the two gentlemen named. The lad's figure was very peculiar,  owing to the disproportion between his legs and his back, the former seemingly  having been destined for the use of some lad of seven, whilst the latter gave  one the effect of being a misfit in &quot;backs&quot; of some well-grown youth  of twenty. He wore a striped waistcoat (black and yellow), whilst his  disproportionately youthful legs were encased in knee-breeches and gaiters. He  affected an outrageously stiff and tall collar, so tall indeed that his jaws  seemed to immediately rest on it, and left it a matter of wonder how he ever  turned his head, and a matter of doubt as to whether he had any neck at all. I don't  know whether it was owing to the collar aforesaid reaching up so far behind  that he wore his hat so far forward. I content myself with stating that he did  wear his hat, as it seemed to me, immediately on his eyebrows, and that it gave  him an indescribably rakish appearance. Just then he stood with his hat poked  under his left arm in an attitude of respectful attention, and waited patiently  for me to ask him any questions I thought necessary. A part of my inquiries I  may reproduce.</p>
  <p>&quot;What  is your name?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sam  Chif,&quot; he answered in a remarkably shrill voice.</p>
  <p>&quot;Samuel  Chiff!&quot; I repeated. &quot;C, h, i, double f?&quot; I inquired.</p>
  <p>&quot;Nossir!&quot;  he jerked out. &quot;Sam, not Sam'l. C, haitch, hi, hef, not double hef!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Curious  name!&quot; I observed, as I wrote it down. &quot;So very short.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yessir!&quot;  said Sam, and relapsed into his respectful silence.</p>
  <p>&quot;Your  father and mother are&quot; . . . I began.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ain't  got none, sir. I'm a orphin, a fondlin'. Mister Dossen&quot;&mdash;I understood at  the time, and have firmly believed ever since that by &quot;Dossen&quot; he  meant Dawson, who is an eminent trainer, I understand; I know that he had been  in some training stable&mdash;&quot;Mister Dossen give it me when I fust went ter  'im.&quot;</p>
  <p>The  boy paused. I merely said &quot;Indeed,&quot; seeing that the lad was nerving  himself to make further disclosures.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yessir!&quot;  he went on. &quot;I wos called Sam Chif, arter Sam'l Chifney, the great  celebrated jockey.&quot; He drew himself up with pride. &quot;But I'm most  called Chif for short.</p>
  <p>The boy took a breath after this long speech.</p>
  <p>&quot;It  wos a toss-up as I wosn't Frank Butler, or Nat Flatman, or Tommy Lye; leastways  so I've heerd.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  could only interject another &quot;Indeed,&quot; not having the slightest idea who  those gentlemen were, though Sam spoke of them as if their names were household  words.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yessir!  But I ain't got no reason for not to be content with the one as I <i>as</i> got. I have heerd,&quot; he drew  himself up again, &quot;as I has got cause to be proud o' my fam'ly.</p>
  <p>I  engaged that boy. There was something so cool about him, so eminently &quot;groomy&quot;  in his appearance, so respectful in his demeanour, that I determined at once  that Sam Chif, and no other, should take care of the wonderful cob. I had such  confidence in him that I took him off at once to a tailor's and had him  measured for a suit of livery, fully aware that if he should not suit me it  would be impossible to get another lad to fill his clothes.</p>
  <p>When  I went round to the stables before breakfast the next morning I found Sam  awaiting me&mdash;looking by the way as if he had never been to bed, for his clothes  were arranged to a <i>t</i> as they had been  overnight&mdash;who reported that &quot;the oss is come, an' the 'arniss is arriv.&quot;  Sure enough Mr. Sudds, with his coat off and a currycomb and brush in his  hands, made his appearance that moment at the stable door.</p>
  <p>&quot;Good  mornin', sir,&quot; he blinked out at me. </p>
  <p>&quot;Good  morning,&quot; I answered. &quot;So you've brought the cob over, eh! Bring him  out, and let's have a look at him.&quot;</p>
  <p>He  brought him out and walked him round the yard.</p>
  <p>&quot;Beauty,  ain't he!&quot; asked Sudds, turning his red-rimmed eyes on me.</p>
  <p>I  did not answer. To tell the truth I admired &quot;the bay cob&quot; even less  that morning than I had the night before. There was a squareness about his head,  a straightness about his shoulder, a want of smoothness in his coat that I did  not admire in the least. I did not like his ragged hips, his high, razor-like  backbone, his mean mane and tail, and especially his enlarged joints and big  knees. I noticed, too, that he had a remarkable way of drawing up his hind legs  as he walked, and instead of answering Mr. Sudds's question I called his  attention to this peculiarity.</p>
  <p>&quot;Vy,&quot;  replied he in a compassionate tone that made me feel very small, &quot;thet's  the main beamy of 'is haction. All trotters, leastways all <i>good</i> trotters,&quot; he added, laying some stress on the adjective,  &quot;move their hind legs like thet, sir! Them as does it are allus the fastest&mdash;they  shakes it orf ven they're warm.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Then  he's a good trotter?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Good's  no name for it! Vy, d'ye know wot, sir,&quot; he dropped his voice to a mysterious  whisper, &quot; 'e can break three minits.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Break  what?&quot; I exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Three  minits!&quot; reiterated the man. &quot;It's my opinion, sir, as he can lick  two fifty.&quot;</p>
  <p>Not  having the slightest idea what the man meant by this extraordinary announcement  (I put down all his expressions as forming part of a turf-language to me an  unknown tongue), and not wishing to display my ignorance, I merely told him to  lead the bay cob back to the box. When Mr. Sudds had done this I thanked him for  the trouble he had taken on my behalf, and paid him for it &quot;like a real  gem'men,&quot; to quote Mr. Sudds himself. Then Mr. Sudds, blinking in the most  frightful manner, backed his way out, profuse in thanks, and hoping that it I  ever wanted assistance in his line I would apply to him.</p>
  <p>Sam  Chif meanwhile was standing motionless as a statue, and patiently awaited  orders. He had offered no remarks during the above conversation, and had  contented himself with merely answering when addressed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sam!&quot;  I said, &quot;we'll have him out this morning.&quot; I pointed towards the  loose-box where the famous cob was doubtless hard at work discussing his oats.  &quot;I suppose you know how to put him into the gig, and&mdash;and all that sort of  thing.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Ev  coorse, sir,&quot; ejaculated Sam, in a tone which showed that he was put out  at my doubting his ability. &quot;Ain't I the groom, sir!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well,  let me see!&quot; I said, looking at my watch. &quot;It'll be nine before I  start for the office. I shall want an hour there, say an hour and a half,  Sam,&quot; I went on. &quot;Meet me with the gig at the corner of the  Quarry-road at half-past eleven.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yessir!  Arf-pass 'leven!&quot; repeated Sam.</p>
  <p>&quot;And  Sam,&quot; I said to him as he was walking away, &quot;Mind that your mistress  doesn't hear you go out.&quot;</p>
  <p>Though  the little groom merely, as usual, answered &quot;Yessir,&quot; I felt fully  confident that the lad was clever enough to smuggle out the gig under Jemima's  very nose, if need be, without her knowing that such a thing was in existence.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>III.</b></p>
  <p>How  I rushed through my business that morning! How I &quot;skimmed&quot; the firm's  correspondence! How I put off this, that, and the other! And all in order to be  at the corner of the Quarry-road at half-past eleven. I even got rid of my  mother-in-law&mdash;whom I met in the street shopping, and to whom I usually (like a  newly-married man) devoted half an hour at least&mdash;in ten minutes! I ran into  brother John, too, just as I was stepping into a cab, but I did not tell him of  my destination or of my purchase. I wanted to surprise my little world. I  wanted to take its admiration by storm. So, as I said good-bye to brother John,  I chuckled, &quot;You won't be as ready to laugh at my knowledge of horseflesh  when you have seen my turnout!&quot; For, of course, I fully intended to take  all credit for the purchase, and meant to place Blosely under a promise of  secrecy as to his share in it.</p>
  <p>Hundreds  and hundreds of yards before I could possibly see the corner where Sam was to  meet me I was anxiously on the look out for the gig, and hundreds and hundreds  of times I imagined that I perceived the turnout before it was possible,  according to the ordinary laws of vision, that it could be seen. When at last  we did come in sight of the corner of the Quarry-road, and there I dimly made  out what I intuitively knew was my gig (oh! the joy of that pronoun), I thought  my heart would stop beating with exultation. We had passed all sorts of conveyances  on the road&mdash;well-appointed ones too&mdash;and I had carefully observed them all. But  to my mind, at any rate, there was not one turnout amongst them all which could  come up to mine! There was not a gig like <i>mine!</i> There was not a cob like <i>mine!</i> Why,  there was not a groom like <i>mine!</i> As  to the <i>tout ensemble</i>, I defied  competition!</p>
  <p>It  was perhaps attributable to the excited state in which I was at the time that,  when I dismissed the cabman, I gave him a sovereign instead of a shilling.</p>
  <p>Before  I took my seat in the gig I took a look round at the harness, the cob, and the  gig itself. Not, you understand, that I could possibly detect if anything was  wrong but I had observed that &quot;men who drive&quot; always do so. Then I  took the reins from Sam, who immediately jumped out and stood at the horse's  head, and I proceeded to put on a recently-purchased and rather elaborate pair  of driving gloves. This operation over I took one more look, pressed my hat  firmly on my head (another driver's habit I had picked up), and prepared to  start.</p>
  <p>&quot;Let  go his head, Sam,&quot; I called out. Sam did so, and in a moment was at my  side.</p>
  <p>But,  to my amazement, the cob did not move.</p>
  <p>I  jerked at the reins. I called out &quot;get up!&quot; I produced a tolerable  imitation of a noise in use amongst coachmen for urging on of refractory horses,  effected by an application of the tongue to the cheek, but all in vain. The bay  cob was deaf to entreaty, and would <i>not</i> &quot;get up.&quot; I repeated the measures I have described again, and yet  again. The bay cob did not budge an inch.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  a small crowd of idlers had collected on the pavement, and offers of assistance  were freely proffered me &quot;to lead him on a bit.&quot; <i>Lead</i> him, indeed! <i>Lead</i> my  bay cob? No, never! Rendered desperate by his obstinacy&mdash;when I felt that he <i>could</i> go so well&mdash;and feeling that the  reputation of my whole turn-out was at stake, I gave him, utterly reckless of  the consequences, a tremendous &quot;cut&quot; with the whip, and awaited the  result.</p>
  <p>To  my utter astonishment, and I must acknowledge, somewhat to my relief Pepper,  after giving a flinch as he felt the whip <i>walked  very slowly on</i>. I had not only expected that the very least he would do  would be to gallop off, but I had considered it almost certain that he would  kick the gig to smithereens, or rear up, or do something equally high-spirited  and unpleasant. However, when I found that&mdash;the whip notwithstanding&mdash;he would  only walk, and had apparently no intention of doing anything else, I &quot;laid  it about him&quot; pretty severely. The crowd on the pavement had meanwhile  increased, and several amongst them were now occupying their leisure time in a  running commentary on myself and the horse. I heard the words &quot;screw&quot;  and &quot;moke&quot; frequently used, but whether they were intended to apply  to me or the horse I knew not. One man, addressing me and pointing to the cob,  vouchsafed the unintelligible remark that &quot;he was only fit to go to the  kennel.&quot; I concluded at once that <i>that</i> man was drunk or out of his mind. It is incredible that any man in his sane,  sober senses should not know that kennels are reserved for the exclusive use of  the canine race.</p>
  <p>Goaded  to madness by my fruitless endeavours to make the horse adopt a decent pace,  and wincing at the ever-increasing taunts of the onlookers, I handed the reins  to Sam, who had never offered a suggestion or remark, and, bidding him &quot;drive  that infernal beast home&quot; (thus I already designated the wonderful cob), I  leant back in the gig, and dug my chin in my chest, a picture of disappointment  and disgust.</p>
  <p>Sam  lost no time in getting to work to get the horse &quot;to move on.&quot; <i>He</i> adopted a combination of coaxing and  whipping, but notwithstanding his vigorous efforts the cob for a long time  stood stock still. I was beginning to think that Pepper&mdash;how he belied his  name!&mdash;had made up his mind to do nothing but walk that day, when at last we  moved on at a gentle trot. It was only a very <i>very</i> gentle trot, and yet I was grateful for it. It removed us from  our critics on the pavement. I whispered Sam to drive down a by-street, and at  last&mdash;after the cob had stubbornly refused to turn down two or three, giving  strong premonitory signs of stopping again&mdash;he suddenly trotted of his own  accord down one, for I'm sure Sam had nothing to do with the movement, and  pulled up (again of his own accord) at a little low public-house. I did not  take long to make up my mind. Jumping out I told Sam to drive him home, and  walked off as fast as I could. When I got to the end of the street I looked  back&mdash;I could not resist it&mdash;and saw the tiny groom having a battle-royal with  the cob on the subject of locomotion. When I lost sight of them the cob was in  a fair way of winning.</p>
  <p>The  pleasant surprise I had prepared for Jemima was &quot;knocked on the head,&quot;  for I could not keep the matter any longer secret. I acknowledged to my wife  that I was disappointed with a horse &quot;I had on trial&quot; (my first  hypocrisy), but I took her down to see the gig and harness, with which she  expressed herself highly delighted, she was equally pleased with Sam, though she  was at first of opinion that he was <i>rather</i> small.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sam,&quot;  I whispered when we were alone, seeing that I might as well make a clean breast  of it, &quot;I know nothing about horses&quot; (how I winced as I admitted it),  &quot;I never owned a horse before in my life.&quot;</p>
  <p>I  stopped to give Sam an opportunity of making some remark&mdash;but he made none. It  was hard to ask the next question, but&mdash;it had to be done. </p>
  <p>&quot;Is&mdash;is  Pip&mdash;Pip&mdash;Pepper,&quot; I stammered out, &quot;a really first-class ker&mdash;cob?&quot;</p>
  <p>For  the first time I saw Sam show some animation.</p>
  <p>&quot;Nossir!  Nossir!&quot; he ejaculated quickly, whilst his already short nose assumed an  even more snubbed appearance, to show the contempt in which he held the quadruped  in question. &quot; 'E ain't no good. 'E ain't wuth 'is oats.&quot;</p>
  <p>On  further inquiry I found that the animal was suffering from a disease termed  &quot;stringhalt&quot; and that it was at his peculiar gait that the people had  laughed; that he was a old and broken down, as his enlarged joints plainly  showed; and that I had paid a great deal too much money for him&mdash;Sam asserting that  he &quot;wosn't wuth five bob,&quot; and that the best thing that I could do  was to sell him for what he would fetch, as he would &quot;ony eat 'is blessed  'ed orf &quot; in the stable.</p>
  <p>I <i>did</i> sell him, and &quot;he went for a  song,&quot; and I made up my mind that I would go about getting another horse  very differently. On consideration I thought that Sam was the most likely  person to get me what I wanted, and I accordingly despatched him into town,  giving him <i>carte blanche</i> in his  selection. The only thing that I impressed on him was that it should be a <i>bay cob</i>, for Blosely had so strongly  recommended that description of horse for a gig.</p>
  <p>I  may as well here state what I subsequently learnt about Mr. Sudds and Mr. Tubbins.  Though I had no intention of taking proceedings against them, for I am keenly  alive to ridicule, I made some inquiries as to who and what they were, and tried,  in a quiet way, to get some of my money back. My first supposition had been  correct. They were brothers. Their name was really Sudds&mdash;the one, whom I had  known as Mr. Tubbins, being commonly known as Soapy Sudds, or briefly Soap Suds;  whilst the other was happily nicknamed Sore-eyed Bill. They earned a disreputable  living, partly by dealings such as the one recorded and partly by the practice  of &quot;bishoping,&quot; which I am given to understand has nothing to do with  clerical ceremonies, but is applied to a manipulation of teeth, by which the  animals operated on gain the reputation of a youthfulness they are not entitled  to.</p>
  <p>The  very next day Sam turned up. He had got a horse but wanted me to see him before  completing his purchase. He was, for him, enthusiastic in his praises. &quot;My  heye!&quot; he observed, when I asked him if he was satisfied. &quot;Ain't I neither?  'E's a real clinker! A daisy!&quot;</p>
  <p>I  could not judge, not knowing what the terms meant, whether he <i>was</i> &quot;a clinker&quot; and &quot;a  daisy,&quot; but he was certainly a very nice-looking horse, and after I had  had a trial drive with him, I was so well satisfied that I bought him there and  then. His name was &quot;Blatherskite,&quot; and he was &quot;by Home Rule out  of Creeping Biddy,&quot; and moreover he was, to my joy, a BAY COB.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>IV.</b></p>
  <p>We  had had him three days! three whole days! Three times had we been out for a  drive (Sam generally driving, for I had some misgivings as to whether I was a  good whip), and my wife who of course had sat behind the new bay cob on each of  these occasions, was delighted. There never was such a compact well-put-together  cob! There never was such a neat-actioned, good-shouldered well-ribbed-up  little fellow in the world! There never was such a bright bay, never such a  golden skin! No! Blatherskite was perfection, and everybody admitted it! Blosely  the moment he set eyes on him, confessed that his brother's cob was <i>nothing</i> in comparison with ours, and  even Brother John let out one day in confidence to Jemima &quot;that that  little bay cob was the handsomest little beggar that he had ever seen.&quot;</p>
  <p>It  was true that the gig did not hold three very well, and that we found that Sam's  presence crushed us somewhat. But there were advantages which compensated for  the inconvenience. I had, I repeat, but little confidence in my driving, and  felt that Sam's services might be in request at any moment, and again Sam in his  plum-coloured livery was the <i>beau-ideal</i> of a groom, and his presence ticked Mrs. Oilcake's vanity.</p>
  <p>The  fourth day I made up my mind that I would drive the whole time myself, as  Blatherskite seemed so quiet, and I had had no difficulty with him before.  However, at the last moment, being still somewhat diffident, I took little Sam  with us, and directly after breakfast we started on a visit to Brother John.</p>
  <p>All  went well with us for some time, and, indeed, I was getting quite careless as  to how I held the reins, when Blatherskite suddenly stopped short, and  stubbornly refused to move. We were at the time crossing a common, and the rain  water, which had collected on the high ground on one side of the road (it had <i>poured</i> for some days previously) was  running in a series of miniature brooks across it. It was at the edge of one of  these that Blatherskite stopped. I coaxed him, but endearments were lost on  him. I struck him with the whip, when, to my surprise, he began  &quot;backing&quot; at an alarming rate. In my dilemna I appealed to Sam, who I  knew would never offer a suggestion until it was solicited.</p>
  <p>&quot;E's  jibbin', Blatherskite is!&quot; said Sam, quietly. &quot; 'E won't cross the  water;&quot; and as he spoke he got out of the gig, and, whip in hand, set to  work to make the refractory cob move on.</p>
  <p>But  for some time even Sam's artifices failed to convince the cob. When the little  groom tugged at him he beat a retreat, and when Sam cut him across the  fore-legs with the whip he either stopped still or danced from side to side. I  was almost despairing of his crossing the obnoxious water, when suddenly a cry  from Sam &quot; 'E's orf!&quot; and a simultaneous jerk, which almost threw my wife  out over the back of the seat, announced the fact that the refractory cob had  at last taken it into his head to obey orders.</p>
  <p>Swish!  through the stream, the muddy water flying into our faces; and Sam, who was  climbing in, &quot;sticking on&quot;, for bare life. Swish! through another pool,  and another, and another, and another. Blatherskite's blood was up&mdash;was he not  by Home Rule out of Creeping Biddy? Blatherskite was in a lather from  excitement, and what cared Blatherskite for water <i>now</i>? Swish! swish! swish! Bump! bump! bump!</p>
  <p>I  shortened the reins in my hand, and, rather nervous about the pace we were  going, tried to pull Blatherskite up. But he had no notion of being pulled up  just then, and I found that what Blatherskite had determined on<i> I </i>had to put up with. We had already  been going at a smart canter, which in itself was sufficiently alarming, when  Blatherskite, notwithstanding my frantic efforts to arrest his progress, took  it into his head to launch out into a mad gallop. In vain I &quot;sawed&quot;  at the reins, and exerted all the strength I possessed to stop him&mdash;he <i>would</i> go! Our career before was nothing  to this! <i>Now</i> we absolutely flew along  the road, the wheels of the gig seeming only to strike the ground every now and  then. One moment we were going along the comparatively even surface in the  middle of the road, the next we rolled about in the gutters&mdash;first one and then  the other&mdash;and shaved the kerbstones in the most alarming way. My wife from the  first had never ceased her exclamations, and by this time had burst out into an  unbroken scream. When, at the commencement of Blatherskite's unfortunate  gallop, I had cried out to him, &quot;Woa! woa! then!&quot; and Blatherskite  had paid no attention to me, Mrs. Oilcake had suggested to me, in a faint voice,  that she was sure that &quot;her pa&quot; had always said, &quot;Way!  way!&quot; to <i>his</i> horses when he  wished them to stop. But she had long since given up offering any suggestions, and  now abandoned herself to exclamations of terror and despair. Sam meanwhile sat as  still as if everything was going on swimmingly. Anybody looking at him would  have been under the impression that he was perfectly satisfied with all that  was happening. His composure had its effect upon me, and I was in hope that I  should soon be able to pull Blatherskite up (indeed, I had informed my wife but  a minute before that it was a certainty that I should do so), when a new vagary  of the little cob upset all my calculations, and threw us into a state of  terror in comparison with which all we had gone through was nothing.</p>
  <p>Blatherskite,  who at the time was patronizing the gutter, suddenly rushed across the road,  across the opposite gutter, over the kerbstone&mdash;(imagine the jerk we got&mdash;why our  wheels were nearly off), over the pathway, and plunged frantically across the  common.</p>
  <p>I  turned pale! This common was full of quarry-holes, and even where there were no  holes the huge boulders, which were plentifully strewn about, presented almost  as great a danger. One corner of it, bounded to the north by a succession of  the dangerous holes, was given up to clothes-lines (there was &quot;a washing  colony&quot; near), and it was to this corner we were making. Straight ahead of  me I saw the forest of poles and the &quot;cloud&quot; of linen exposed on the  lines, and I foresaw that unless Blatherskite changed his course we should do  considerable execution amongst the washing.</p>
  <p>Change  his course! Not he! I believe that the brute made up his mind to charge those  poles the moment he saw the white linen fluttering in the wind, for he made for  them in an absolutely direct line. On we flew towards them&mdash;over boulders and  over ruts, the gig meanwhile dancing up and down and from side to side to such  an extent that it was almost impossible to keep one's seat. We were within a  few yards of them! Then, as I uttered a cry to my wife to &quot;duck her  head,&quot; we passed under the first of the clothes lines.</p>
  <p>But  no woman from the time of Lot ever did what she was told to do in cases of  danger and necessity. <i>Mrs. Oilcake did  not duck!</i></p>
  <p>Instead  of doing so, she actually caught hold of the clothes-line with both hands, and  in a twinkling&mdash;notwithstanding the frantic efforts of Sam, who had instantly  caught hold of her skirts and tried to hold her in the trap&mdash;she disappeared  over the back of the seat, leaving Sam half in and half out of the gig, with a  petticoat and half a skirt in his hands.</p>
  <p>Poor  Sam! It would have been better that he had followed his mistress!</p>
  <p>I  had no time to look round and see what had befallen my wife, and knew not  whether, like Mahomet's coffin, she was still suspended in mid-air, or whether  she had fallen immediately to the ground, for the cob, suddenly altering his  course, placed us in such immediate danger that the struggle became a question  of life and death.</p>
  <p>Blatherskite  was heading direct for the quarry-holes to the north!</p>
  <p>In  vain Sam and myself&mdash;for I had enlisted the assistance of the little groom  pulled with all our might and main at the reins, and tried to avert the  catastrophe, the obstinate cob was not to be deterred, and rushed headlong to  destruction. When we were only some fifty yards away I sang out to Sam to jump  out, and, as I did so, jumped out myself. I was conscious of rolling over and  over, striking every part of my body, and performing a variety of involuntary  acrobatic feats, and then&mdash;all was a blank!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>I  came to myself very soon, for, strange to say, I had escaped with only a few  bruises, and found myself surrounded by a crowd. My first thought was for my  wife. I was informed she was all right. I closed my eyes and thanked God for  that. It was some time before I even thought of Sam. I was then told that he  was in a bad way, and that it was hardly likely he would recover. I gave my  address to my informant and asked him to have the lad taken home. Within an  hour my wife and myself were back at our house, and shortly afterwards poor  little Sam was carried in.</p>
  <p>Until  the doctor had seen us we did not know precisely what damage had been done to  any of us. I myself felt sore all over, and was <i>certain</i> that half the bones in my body were broken. I was assured  that I had nothing more serious the matter with me than severe bruises. Mrs.  Oilcake, who was in a highly hysterical state, was suffering from a shock to  the system; her hands had been scraped by the rope almost bare of skin, one  wrist had been dislocated, and she had a fair share of bruises. But little Sam!  Ah, poor Sam! Poor Sam!</p>
  <p>He,  the doctor said, could never recover unless by a miracle. His skull was  fractured, and his brain seriously affected. He might linger a while, he might  rally a little, <i>but</i>&mdash; the end was  certain. Poor little Sam would die. The doctor could not hold out any hope of  recovery.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>You  can form no idea of how we fretted over our little patient&mdash;of the joy we felt  at any improvement, however slight, in his condition&mdash;of our feelings of  depression when he &quot;went back.&quot; We were bound up in that boy. We  could not forget his pluck, that he had been the partner of our danger, that he  had incurred this terrible illness in our service.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!&quot;  said a man who had seen the accident, and who insisted on helping to nurse Sam  free of charge. &quot;Yer shud ha' seen him, sir, arter yer jumped out! He  fott,&quot; (fought) &quot;with that 'oss, sir, like the little brick that he  was, an' at times it was the toss-up of a shillin' if he didn't turn 'im. Lor! ter  see 'im a tuggin' of them reins, with his little shoulders well set back, his  little feet a-planted agen the splash-board, an' his teeth set! But bless yer  'art, sir, it wurn't no good, tho' the little 'ero stuck ter 'im like a little  lion!&quot; (The man had evidently made a zoological mistake. He meant, no  doubt, a &quot;little tiger,&quot; for had not Mr. Bunsel designated Sam as a  tip-top member of that species.) &quot;Fotty Sams, sir,&quot; the man evidently  meant forty&mdash;&quot;Fotty Sams, sir, couldn't a turned 'im, an'&mdash;an' down they  went over an' over&mdash;&quot; The speaker never got farther than this, but, with a  sigh, would relapse into silence, and watch with an anxious face the poor  little suffering figure at his side.</p>
  <p>Week  after week had passed and Sam had not regained consciousness. Some operation of  a very &quot;nice&quot; and difficult description&mdash;a &quot;forlorn hope&quot; in  surgery&mdash;had been performed on his head as a last resource, but seemingly  without any good effect, when one night his nurse knocked at our sitting-room  door, and informed us that Sam was talking coherently, and had asked after  &quot;the master.&quot;</p>
  <p>My  wife and myself hurried to the sickroom, and when I entered I saw immediately that  some change, whether for the better or the worse I knew not, was imminent. Poor  Sam's eyes were open, and he evidently, though in a confused way, recognised  us. I immediately despatched his attendant for the doctor, and sat down at the  bedside, whilst my wife, in tears, leant over the wasted little figure, speaking  to him in those low soothing tones which women, and women only, have the gift  of using at a sick bed. He still seemed to see us, but, as yet, he had not  spoken. Suddenly he turned on his side, and, as he put his skeleton hand to his  shaven head, gave a groan of pain.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,  my 'ed, my 'ed,&quot; he said, articulating painfully. My wife placed an iced  bandage on his burning temples. He gave her a look of gratitude, but, for  another hour, did not speak again. About that time, however, a change again  took place, and I rightly judged that the end was near.</p>
  <p>&quot;Woa  then!&quot; he exclaimed, now perfectly delirious. &quot;Woa, then, will yer?  Where are yer a-running ter, stoopid? Woa, then, Blatherskite. . . My name's  Sam Chif, sir, with one hef, with one hef. Mister Dossen give it me, Mister Dossen  give. . . Ain't got no father, sir; no mother. Never 'ad none. . . Chif, sir;  Sam Chif. Orphin. Fondlin'. . . Now, then, Blatherskite. Woa. Look out, sir. Yer'll  be rite inter it. Woa, yer beggar, woa. . . Oh, my 'ed, my 'ed.&quot;</p>
  <p>At  first the words had been uttered distinctly, but now they came with a dry  whistle from his parched lips. He was fighting hard, very hard, for life, poor  little fellow, but it was easy to see, when one considered his slight and  wasted form, that the battle would not be a long one.</p>
  <p><i>A long one!</i> Why it was over already! With a gasp and a shiver the  poor little fellow turned even then on his side and gave in.</p>

  <p>&quot;How's  your little groom?&quot; asked Blosely of me that very day.</p>
  <p>&quot;The  poor lad's gone,&quot; I answered, sorrowfully.</p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed!&quot;  said Blosely, drily. &quot;Well, you may possibly fill his place, but,&quot; he  added, as he smiled at his unfeeling and ill timed jest, &quot;I'll swear you  can never fill his clothes.&quot;</p>
  <p>I've  never felt the same to Blosely since.</p>
