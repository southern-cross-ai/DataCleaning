  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; SEALED LIPS.</h2>

  <p class="first">Once Lanton Place had been one of the historic landmarks in mid-Devon.
  What remains of it to-day is a mere shell, practically a ruin half-smothered
  in ivy and other parasites, and apparently hiding itself away in the wooded
  country as if half ashamed of the change that time has brought it.</p>

  <p>At one time it had been, to all practical purposes, a castle, a long low
  line of noble buildings overlooking the Dart and dominating that part of the
  country. But that had been in the day when the Dorns were a great clan and
  the head of the family went into the field in front of a thousand or two of
  his own vassals and tenantry. The name is writ largely enough in the history
  of Devon.</p>

  <p>To-day, however, it is another story. To-day Lanton Place consists of half
  a dozen rooms, mere shells hidden away behind thick ramparts of stone covered
  with ivy and clinging plants that served to hide the desolation of the place
  behind a mask of living greenery. For twenty years ago a disastrous fire had
  levelled most of Lanton Place to the ground, which was no bad thing in one
  way, for the fortunes of the family were as decayed as the building itself,
  and Major Dorn and his wife and daughter were more or less content to hide
  their diminished heads in what remained of a great historic house.</p>

  <p>It had been the old story, told over and over again both in fiction and in
  fact. Two generations of reckless Dorns had wrecked the fortunes of the
  family and brought themselves to the verge of ruin. One farm after another
  had been mortgaged to meet dissipation and extravagance, and on the top of
  that had come a ruinous lawsuit which left Major Manby Dorn with practically
  nothing on which to live. But for the fact that the property was in Chancery
  he would not have been there at all. In his cynical moments he described
  himself as a caretaker, and that, literally, was exactly what he was. Some
  day an enterprising purchaser would come along and buy up the dilapidated
  estate with its weed-covered farms, which were a crying disgrace to the
  county, and turn it into smiling land again. Meanwhile Dorn clung there in
  his few rooms, which were still furnished with some taste, until the hour
  arrived when the Court would give him notice to leave. And, in the meantime,
  he contemplated the remains of the family story, the faded carpets and
  tapestry, and the few old pictures, with a certain melancholy pride and a
  bitterness that was but skin deep.</p>

  <p>For he cared little or nothing for the family, of even his own reputation,
  so long as he had the wherewithal to pander to his own vices and
  dissipations. He was the last of his race on the male side, and there were
  plenty of people in the neighbourhood who declared that this was a good
  thing. For, sooth to say, Dorn was not popular. He was vicious and
  dissipated, absolutely and entirely selfish, a soured and disappointed man
  without a single redeeming feature. He was always well dressed, always
  beautifully turned out, and from time to time he managed, by some means known
  to himself, to obtain the funds necessary for an occasional jaunt to
  London.</p>

  <p>What he did there neither his wife nor daughter knew, and, indeed, he
  would not have told them had they asked him. There were times, on the other
  hand, when he was practically penniless&mdash;times when he had not the
  necessary sixpence left for a cigar. And there were times, on the other hand,
  when cigars were plentiful enough and Dorn lived on the fat of the
  land&mdash;that is, so far as he was personally concerned. He had his own
  snug little sitting-room, where he kept his cases of cigarettes and his cases
  of wine, which he indulged all too freely. And these were the times when he
  expanded and became quite amiable to his wife and daughter, who, on the
  whole, preferred him in his darker moods. For that smooth manner and polished
  politeness of his almost covered a sneer or a sarcasm that at one time had
  brought the tears to Sylvia Dorn's eyes, but now she had grown out of that
  and outwardly she was hard enough.</p>

  <p>A gloomy, desolate place on the whole, a place suggesting crime and
  misery, with its weed-grown paths and ragged lawns and overgrown shrubbery
  rambling up to the edge of the house. There were people in the neighbourhood,
  farm labourers and the like, who whispered of the strange things that took
  place there, behind the screen of green that nobody ever penetrated. They
  said that Mrs. Dorn was mad, that her husband's constant cruelty had driven
  her out of her mind, and that in all sorts of weathers she could be seen
  creeping furtively about the blackened ruins always searching for something
  with a rake in her hand. And perhaps there was some foundation for these dark
  legends, for an old servant of the family, now happily married, had spoken to
  intimates of the night when Lanton Place was burnt down, and how, on that
  dreadful evening, Dorn, in a fit of drunken passion, had thrown a lighted
  lamp at his wife. All this was legend of course, though plenty of people in
  the neighbourhood were prepared to believe it, and in this instance it
  happened to be true. It was true, too, that from then on Mrs. Dorn had never
  spoken a sensible word. Now and again some adventurous youth or sanguine
  poacher, approaching too near the house had seen that slim, sad-looking
  figure in black searching about in the charred ruins, like some poor woman
  hunting fuel in a wood. And the daring one had crept away, feeling just a
  little nervous and superstitious and rather afraid of encountering that
  pathetic vision there amongst the ruins.</p>

  <p>So far, that was true enough. There must have been something more on that
  fateful night than tradition spoke of, some terrible shock that had robbed a
  beautiful woman in the prime of life of her reason.</p>

  <p>There were plenty of people in the neighbourhood, of course, who could
  remember the time when Dorn had brought his wife home, a beautiful,
  sparkling, fascinating creature who had been a noted figure on the stage,
  both in London and Paris. Lots of people knew that Mrs. Dorn was half French,
  and in those early days, when things were more prosperous, and before the
  great crash came, she had been a popular figure in the neighbourhood. But for
  years now no local resident had called at Lanton Place. There were lots of
  people who were immensely sorry for Mrs. Dorn, and quite as many who would
  have held out their hand in friendship to Sylvia. But the girl had always
  kept them at arm's length; she was proud enough in her way, and though, like
  most girls, she longed for friendship, she shrank naturally from anything
  that savoured of pity or sympathy.</p>

  <p>Sylvia was about twenty now, tall and slim like her mother, and inheriting
  her proud spirit and vivacious beauty. She had waited patiently enough for
  the time to come when she could turn her back upon that dreary spot and earn
  her own living, and for the last six months she had been touring the country
  with a theatrical company. But misfortune had dogged the venture from the
  first, so that, reluctant as she was, she had been glad enough to come back
  home again till fortune should smile once more.</p>

  <p>She was wondering about the dismal grounds that fine summer morning, a
  morning so fine that even Lanton Place seemed almost attractive. She came
  presently by a well-worn track at the back of the house past a thick belt of
  laurels to the blackened spot where the main portion of the house had stood.
  Her eyes dimmed slightly as she saw that sombre figure in black raking over
  the dead ashes, as she had seen her mother doing many a hundred times. And
  then the look in her eyes changed to one of contempt and loathing as she saw
  her father coming in her direction from the far side of what once had been a
  lawn.</p>

  <p>Dorn was smiling to himself as if something had pleased him. There was a
  cigar in his mouth, his well-cut suit of grey flannels bore the unmistakable
  mark of Bond-street. He was handsome, distinguished enough, despite the
  weakness of his eyes and the shakiness of his lips, unmistakable signs of the
  kind of life he lived. But still, he was a fine figure of a man, looking
  every inch the country gentleman, with an air that there was no mistaking.
  And as Sylvia looked at him and then at the pathetic figure groping there
  amongst the ashes, her lip curled scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Ah, a nice morning, Sylvia," Dorn said, raising his hat gallantly. He
  always prided himself that no misfortune could ever make him forget that he
  was a gentleman. "A most delightful morning, my dear. Any news? Anything from
  those people in London?"</p>

  <p>"I have had a letter," Sylvia said coldly. "A letter from the man I told
  you about."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the man with the funny name?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maxwell Frick, yes. He thinks, from my description, that Lanton Place
  would be ideal for the purposes of cinema photography. The firm that has
  engaged him are making a great picture, or rather a great drama, with
  Dartmoor for a background, and these people want a picturesque place like
  ours that suggests desolation and misery."</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my word, they couldn't have selected a better spot," Dorn said
  cynically. "This might be a haunted house where a murder was committed. But
  the point is, Sylvia, what are these people prepared to
  pay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Sylvia said impatiently. "Mr. Frick is coming down here in
  a day or two, and you can make all arrangements with him. They won't want to
  use the interior of the house&mdash;at least, not very often&mdash;and they
  will erect their own studios here in the grounds. If it is any satisfaction,
  I believe that the firm is quite a wealthy one."</p>

  <p>Dorn turned aside, humming carelessly. Then his eyes turned upon his wife,
  and they narrowed and his thin lips were pressed together ominously. There
  was anger on his face as he spoke, but his words were smooth enough.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, my dear," he said, "that you have done
  enough&mdash;er&mdash;gardening for one morning?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dorn looked up with a vacant expression on that still beautiful face
  of hers. She held up one blackened hand as if for silence.</p>

  <p>"Sealed lips," she whispered. "Sealed lips. But this I have found. Only
  this."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.</h2>

  <p class="first">As Mary Dorn spoke, a scrap of paper fluttered from her fingers. It was
  apparently part of a charred letter or envelope, and had no doubt been there,
  protected from the rain by a fragment of charred wood, all these years. Dorn
  glanced at it carelessly enough, much as one regards some gaudy flowering
  weed which a child has gathered from a neighbouring hedgeside under the
  impression that she has found a treasure. It was only a tiny scrap of paper
  with the ink faded, a scrap of paper that had been evidently torn from an
  envelope. There were only two words "street" and "London, E.C."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are in luck this morning, my dear," Dorn said. "And now having
  done so much, don't you think it about time that you went in and looked after
  the lunch? Sylvia, I want you for a moment or two."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Sylvia asked defiantly.</p>

  <p>She would have turned and followed her mother slowly into the house if her
  father had not detained her. She had only been back home a day or two, but
  she guessed what he wanted.</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to help me," he said. "There is an important letter that
  ought to be written."</p>

  <p>"What, already?" Sylvia demanded. "I can't do it, I won't. I told you
  before I went away that I would have nothing more to do with that sort of
  thing. Of course, you know where it will end eventually."</p>

  <p>Once more Dorn's eyes narrowed, and once more his thin lips were pressed
  together.</p>

  <p>"My dear child," he said, smoothly enough, "you must allow me to be the
  better judge of that. Besides, unnecessary as it may seem, we have to live.
  And when I tell you that I am down to my last five shillings you will see how
  pressing the situation is. As a certain philosopher once observed, 'there are
  people who have plenty of money and no brains, and other people who have
  plenty of brains and no money.' Therefore, by a natural evolution, the brains
  attract the money. You wouldn't have your mother starving, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I quite understand your natural solicitude for my mother," Sylvia
  said bitterly. "You are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There, that will do," Dorn said ominously. "You forget who you are
  talking to."</p>

  <p>"As, I wish to Heaven I could."</p>

  <p>Dorn's manner changed suddenly. He approached Sylvia and grasped her
  roughly by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Enough of that," he said. "Now go and do as I tell you. I can't compel
  you, of course. . . ."</p>

  <p>"No, but you can hit my mother through me," Sylvia retorted. "It would not
  be the first time. Oh, you make me tingle from head to foot with shame. And
  you have brought it all on yourself. You were not so badly off when you came
  into the property. And my mother had money too&mdash;more than enough for all
  of us. Why, her diamonds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are all a myth, my child, all a myth. I don't believe there were any
  diamonds. And if they did exist they were probably stage paste. At any rate,
  I have never seen them, though your mother did say something about them one
  time when we were on our honeymoon."</p>

  <p>"I believe in them, all the same," Sylvia said. "My mother was incapable
  of telling a lie. I believe she is hunting for them now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, pooh! That's a girl's romantic fancy. Let's be practical. I must have
  fifty pounds this week, and I can see a way of getting it. Don't be a fool.
  It's only a few lines I want you to write to a man who has more money than he
  knows what to do with. And you've done it before."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, when I didn't understand," Sylvia said. "I blush for shame when
  I think of the scores of begging letters I have written on your behalf. Oh,
  it is bad enough to borrow money in any case, horrible to write to strangers
  and ask them for assistance. I understand now. Those letters I wrote were
  deliberate frauds, lies written to kind-hearted people. Oh, can't you see how
  criminal it is?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's a nasty word," Dorn said soothingly. "A very nasty word,
  Sylvia. And perhaps, occasionally, I have overstepped
  the&mdash;er&mdash;bound of truth. But what can I do? We are practically
  penniless, and your mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I implore you not to bring my mother into it. If she were in a mental
  condition to know what is going on, she would shrink from it in horror."</p>

  <p>"But, confound it, we can't starve."</p>

  <p>"Why should we starve? I am capable of getting my own living, and
  therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, are you?" Dorn sneered. "Then what are you doing at home again? You
  started out bravely enough. You shook the ashes of the old home from your
  feet in the traditional theatrical way, but you came back, my dear child, you
  came back, as I, a man of the world, knew you would, and here we are, to come
  down to a practical basis, down to our last shilling. Why, by the end of the
  week, we shall actually be short of bread. And you know we couldn't get
  credit here for a pair of shoe-laces. How am I going to tell your mother
  that? Come, don't be silly, Sylvia. I won't ask you again."</p>

  <p>Sylvia stood there, hesitating. It was all hopelessly wicked, indeed
  criminal, and her whole soul revolted against it. But she knew only too well,
  if she refused, that her mother would be made to suffer. Not openly or
  brutally, of course, but with those refined and polished little cruelties of
  which her father was a past master. She followed him meekly enough into the
  house presently, and sat down in the library to write the letter. It was the
  one room in the house where all the comforts and luxuries were gathered
  together, a room where Dorn spent most of his time working out his
  schemes.</p>

  <p>He stood up now, a fine figure of an English gentleman, smiling and
  debonnaire, with a choice cigar in his mouth, whilst he dictated the letter
  that might have brought a blush of shame to the cheek of a harder rascal than
  himself. The address was a fictitious one, an address somewhere in London
  that Sylvia had used on many a revolting occasion before.</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    "Dear Sir (it ran)&mdash;<br>
    <br>
    "May I venture, a mere stranger to you, in deep distress, to approach you
    on a matter that is exceedingly dear to an anxious mother's heart.<br>
    <br>
    "I am the wife, or I should say the widow, of a man who once was a
    distinguished soldier. My name will convey nothing to you, and I will say
    nothing of my dear husband's services to his country; indeed, rather than
    drag his honoured name into it and have his record shown, even to a
    kind-hearted gentleman like yourself, I would rather that you ignored my
    plea altogether.<br>
    <br>
    "But I must approach you, not on behalf of myself, but in the interests of
    my only daughter. For years now I have lived at a little quiet cottage in
    the country, where I have managed to keep body and soul together with the
    aid of my needle. My own friends I cannot approach; there are reasons why I
    shrink from doing so.<br>
    <br>
    "I have managed to bring up my daughter and educate her in the station to
    which she was born. It has been a hard and weary struggle, but, thank
    Heaven, I have managed it. And now the dear child is twenty-one. She has
    been on the stage for the last year or more, and competent judges tell me
    that she is likely to go very far in her profession. She has just a
    magnificent offer from America, which will also enable her to help me
    considerably. But she has to get to America and purchase a wardrobe. This
    we find cannot be done for less than&mdash;&mdash;"<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Dorn paused, and seemed to be turning over something in his mind. Then he
  went on dictating.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Um! yes&mdash;a hundred pounds. Cannot be done for less than a hundred
    pounds."<br>
    <br>
    "Now you, sir, are a rich man, and, moreover, have a reputation for a kind
    heart and overflowing sympathy. And to you I appeal. This sum, which is a
    fortune to us, is nothing to you. But to myself and my daughter it means
    everything. She is a most charming and delightful girl, exceedingly popular
    with everybody, and is wrapped up heart and soul in her profession. She has
    to refuse this offer for the need of the money I mention, then indeed she
    will he heartbroken. And that is why I have adopted the desperate step of
    writing to you and imploring your assistance. Nobody but a mother could
    have done it. I have dragged myself to my desk like a body in pain. I have
    forced myself to write these words to you, and I cannot say any more. Out
    of your plenty, will you help us?<br>
    <br>
    "Yours most gratefully,<br>
    <br>
    "HENRIETTA MARVIN."<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>"Yes, I think that will do," Dorn said. "It is not too gushing, but just
  gushing enough. I can quite imagine a fool of a woman writing a letter like
  that."</p>

  <p>"What's the address?" Sylvia asked coldly, as she took an envelope from
  the case.</p>

  <p>"John Bevill, Esq., Baron's Court, near Tavistock," Dorn said. "I think
  that will do very well. Oh, one moment. A postscript to that letter. Quite an
  inspiration. Now, write as follows:&mdash;</p><br>

  <blockquote>
    P.S. "Since writing the above, I have thought it as well to enclose a
    photograph of my daughter. I have enough confidence in you to do this, and
    besides, I want you to see what the dear girl is like. You will return it,
    I know."<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote><br>

  <p>There, that's a touch of real genius."</p>

  <p>Dorn stopped and smiled as he took the letter from Sylvia's hand. He
  glanced it over carefully, then proceeded to place it in the envelope.</p>

  <p>"And whose photograph are you going to send?" Sylvia asked. "Where are you
  going to get it from? If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She started suddenly to her feet as a dreadful thought crossed her mind.
  Then she hastened up the stairs to her bedroom and flew to the mantelpiece,
  where an hour ago a photograph of herself in theatrical costume had been
  standing.</p>

  <p>The photograph was no longer there.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; AGAINST LONG ODDS.</h2>

  <p class="first">It needed no great discernment on Sylvia's part to see what had happened.
  One glance at the empty frame on the mantelpiece confirmed her worst
  suspicions. Beyond the shadow of a doubt her father had entered the bedroom
  and taken away the photograph for the express purpose of sending it to his
  intended victim. It was a cunning scheme altogether, and not the least
  cunning part of it was the way in which Dorn had lured her on to write the
  letter, even to the very postscript, so that she should not see the trap. And
  here she had walked blindly into it, she had rendered herself liable to a
  criminal charge.</p>

  <p>She had seen quite enough of the world lately to know that. Surely her
  father must have been desperately placed before he would run a risk like
  this? In all the years that Sylvia had been his unwilling tool in his course
  of mean crime he had never placed his own hand on paper. Always he has
  written as if he had been a woman in distress, and invariably Sylvia had been
  his medium. But this was a different matter altogether. She had not the least
  idea what type of man this John Bevill was, but if he made inquiries and used
  that photograph, then there was just a chance that she might have to stand in
  the dock, and face a prosecution. The mere thought of it was terrible.</p>

  <p>And here she was, at the very outset of what might be a promising career,
  face to face with the possibility of ruin and disgrace. She had not gone very
  far on the stage, it was true, the tour in the north had been a disastrous
  failure, but she had made one or two useful friends, poor ones, perhaps, but
  useful from a business standing. There was Maxwell Frick, for instance, a
  seasoned old comedian who bore all his misfortunes with a smiling face and
  who always fell on his feet. It was he who had introduced her to the Western
  Production Company, for whom she had done certain cinema work which had given
  satisfaction and had elicited the promise of further employment later on. It
  was this work that had led up to Sylvia having her photograph taken in
  connection with it, and it was this photograph which had been the cause of
  all the trouble.</p>

  <p>So Sylvia had come home at the end of a fortnight's engagement with a
  promise for something better and more regular in the near future. For
  instance, the Western Company fully intended to establish themselves
  somewhere in Devonshire, and Sylvia's description of her own home had
  appealed to Maxwell Frick who seemed to think that the neighbourhood would
  suit admirably. On behalf of the Company he was coming down in a few days to
  make arrangements. It seemed to Sylvia as if she had found a really good
  opening at last.</p>

  <p>But all this had been blown to the winds by that dastardly act on her
  father's part. The mischief was done now past all recall. She knew only too
  well that no tears or protestations on her part would induce Dorn to change
  his mind. He would only laugh at her; he would only tell her not to be a
  fool, and remind her in his flippant way that necessity knew no law.</p>

  <p>Well, her mind was made up. She would not remain there to be made the
  victim of further conspiracy. She would go back to London, where, no doubt,
  the amiable Frick would find her at least with employment good enough to keep
  body and soul together until her services were required.</p>

  <p>But how to get to London? That was the difficulty. Sylvia had only a
  matter of a few shillings in her pocket, not enough to take her farther than
  Salisbury. And even then she had made no provision for keeping herself on the
  way. But, all the same, she was resolved to go. She was doing no good there,
  and her presence in the house was calculated to do her mother more harm than
  good. She would walk the rest of the way from Salisbury and trust to
  Providence when she got to London.</p>

  <p>Was it possible, she wondered, to see this John Bevill at Baron's Court
  before the begging letter containing her photograph reached him? She could
  walk to Tavistock in an hour or two, and from thence take train to Exeter.
  Possibly she might invent some plausible excuse on the way for getting her
  photograph back; she might even adopt some desperate expedient for getting
  hold of the letter. At any rate, it was worth trying.</p>

  <p>She crept carefully down the stairs a little later on, cautiously avoiding
  her father, and made her way out into the grounds, where she knew she would
  find her mother somewhere. She walked along the narrow track in the grass
  which had been worn bare by Mrs. Dorn's footsteps in going backwards and
  forwards to the ruins. And there the unfortunate woman was, as usual, raking
  over the blackened ashes with a patience that had something pathetic about
  it. She looked up with uncomprehending eyes as Sylvia approached her.</p>

  <p>"I am going away, mother," the girl said, much as if she were speaking to
  a child. "Do you understand, I am going away? I shall probably be back in a
  week or two, but I can't stay now."</p>

  <p>"That will be plenty of time," Mrs. Dorn said in that strange monotone of
  cheers. "I hope to be finished by then. I may find it any time."</p>

  <p>It was quite useless to ask her what she was seeking for, and so Sylvia
  turned aside with the pity in her heart that brought tears into her eyes.
  Some day the whole thing would become plain, but that time was not yet. And
  so it had gone on all these years, and so it might go on till the end. And
  what that end was, Sylvia did not dare to ask.</p>

  <p>She struck off quite boldly and resolutely enough across the fields in the
  direction of Tavistock. Practically all she had in the world she carried in
  her handbag, which contained that slender purse of hers and its precious
  contents. She was not in the least cast down, not in the least daunted at the
  task that lay before her. At any rate, she was turning her back upon the
  so-called home that she hated and loathed more than any spot on earth. It was
  no use her staying there, either. If her presence there would have done her
  mother the slightest good in the world, she might have forgotten her outraged
  feelings and remained. As it was she was best away.</p>

  <p>It was still quite early in the afternoon when she arrived at Tavistock
  and inquired the whereabouts of Baron's Court. It was a big house, she was
  told, on the main road, just on the outskirts of the town. She came at length
  to a pair of handsome iron gates, beyond which she could see a wide-spreading
  park, and the outline of a great house in the distance. Evidently the
  residence of a rich man, and Sylvia smiled a little scornfully as she
  realised her father's worldly wisdom in writing that fateful letter. She
  would have passed through the gates, but they were locked, and therefore she
  had to knock at the lodge and ask for admission.</p>

  <p>The rosy-cheeked woman that came to the door shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't let you in, miss," she said. "You see, no one passes
  this way unless they come here on business. I have strict orders to keep the
  gates locked because of the animals."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" Sylvia smiled vaguely. "Do you mean the deer?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss. Mr. Bevill is a great man with animals. He has spent his time
  with them all over the world. He knows more about them than anyone. We have
  got all sorts of creatures in the park there. You will notice there is a high
  wall all round, and indeed, miss, it's wanted sometimes."</p>

  <p>"But I want to see Mr. Bevill," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you can't, miss," the woman said respectfully enough. "You
  see, he isn't here. He went away a day or two ago on some important
  business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can give me his address?" Sylvia asked.</p>

  <p>The woman shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't do that either, miss," she said. "You see, my master's a very
  peculiar gentleman. He's got this beautiful place here, and two thirds of the
  time he never comes near it. He's always lending it to some gentleman or
  another, and indeed we've got two or three of them staying here now. But you
  see, Mr. Bevill, he's so wrapped up in a book he's writing that he can't
  think of anything else. He's off now in some quiet little bungalow of his
  somewhere writing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you can tell me where he is?" Sylvia said hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Really and truly I can't miss. Nobody knows where the place is. We
  forward his letters to an address in London&mdash;some bank I think it
  is&mdash;and that's all I know about it. But I can't allow any stranger to
  come inside."</p>

  <p>The woman was very civil, but quite firm, so that Sylvia was forced to
  turn away with a feeling that she had wasted her time. But, at any rate, she
  had gained something. She had learnt a good deal about the eccentric owner of
  Baron's Court, and, moreover, she knew now that the fateful letter containing
  her photograph would not reach its destination for a day or two. Her first
  impulse was to turn into some shop and obtain the materials to write a letter
  to him in which she could explain the situation. But, on the other hand, she
  had a certain duty to her father, callous and criminal as he was. She could
  not go out of her way to injure him and place him within the reach of the
  law. No, she could not do that. She made her way quietly along the road in
  the direction of Tavistock; she reached the station at length, and took a
  ticket as far as Salisbury.</p>

  <p>She was proceeding in the direction of her platform when a voice behind
  suddenly hailed her. She turned and looked into the smiling, rosy face of a
  man who might have been any age between fifty and seventy. He was fresh and
  clean-shaven, with a humorous mouth and a pair of twinkling blue eyes that
  would in the most adverse circumstances have looked life cheerfully in the
  face.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Miss Dorn!" the stranger cried.</p>

  <p>"Maxwell Frick!" Sylvia exclaimed. "Whatever are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The fat, rosy little man threw back his head and laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said. "I came down in these parts on a little matter of
  business. And here I am, stranded, without a penny in the world."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE BUNGALOW.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia smiled back again. It was impossible to feel depressed in the
  presence of Maxwell Frick. Here was a man who had been connected with the
  theatrical profession all his life, a sound and experienced comedian without
  a vice save his own incomparable optimism, and yet a man who never contrived
  to remain in a show, as he called it, for more than a month at the outside.
  He was known in the profession from one end of England to the other; he was
  popular, and yet most of his time he spent in a desperate struggle to live. A
  little more businesslike aptitude and he might long ago have had a theatre of
  his own.</p>

  <p>And yet here he was, shabby and smiling, stranded on the platform of a
  local station miles away from everywhere, and treating the whole matter as if
  it were the finest joke in the world.</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" Sylvia asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," Frick explained. "I came down here on business for
  the Western Company, and before I started I clean forgot to give them my
  address. And I forgot to draw any money, either. I only realised I had
  nothing when I walked to the station just now. I was going to see you."</p>

  <p>"Really? Why didn't you write?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. I suppose I forgot all about it. You know my way. I was
  coming to look at that old house of yours. They told me in London that if my
  report was all right they would send the secretary down here to try and make
  all the necessary arrangements with Major Dorn. But where are you off to?
  Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia hesitated, but only for a moment. She would like to have taken this
  friend into her confidence, but she could not; it was not possible just now
  to make a confidant of any one. Whatever happened, she must go through the
  next day or two alone. But, at any rate, Frick might help her at the other
  end. Therefore she would keep her counsel.</p>

  <p>"I am going to London," she said carefully. "I shall be back again when
  you have made your arrangements. But that may be some little time, and there
  are reasons, Mr. Frick, pressing reasons, why I must find something to
  do."</p>

  <p>Frick nodded his grey head sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I understand," he said. "You want a shop for a week or two. Well, I
  think I can manage that."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he fished a dingy card from his pocket and scribbled an
  address upon it.</p>

  <p>"You call there," he said. "And it will be all right. It won't be much,
  not more than two quid a week at the outside, but Coventry Martin will do
  that much for me. He hasn't forgotten the days when we were in the Cambridge
  Dramatic Club together. He will help you all right. And now, about this
  business of yours. Is your father of the same mind?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," Sylvia said. "I discussed the matter with him and he seemed
  to be favourable. Oh, I must be candid with you. We are so desperately poor
  that we cannot turn our back upon money, however small it is. I am sure you
  will find it all right. Lanton Place is an ideal spot for your purpose, and,
  as I know the country so well, I shall be able to help you. And as soon as
  ever your arrangements are made, let me know. I shall be only too glad to
  come back again, only too glad to feel that I am earning my living."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shouldn't worry about that if I were you," the optimistic Frick
  smiled. "With your face and figure, my dear, you are bound to get on. Lor'
  bless you, directly our company gets going, you will be drawing your hundred
  quid a week and forgetting all about poor old Frick."</p>

  <p>"I shall never do that," Sylvia smiled. "I shall never forget how good and
  kind you have been to me. What should we have done up north if it hadn't been
  for you? How should we have contrived to get back to London again?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Frick said. "It's all in the day's work. Why,
  bless you, I shouldn't know what to do with myself if things went
  prosperously for over a month."</p>

  <p>With which characteristic remark Frick saw Sylvia to her carriage and went
  his way smiling. Salisbury came at due length, and then gravely and
  resolutely Sylvia set her face towards London. She walked on till the
  darkness fell, after which she contrived to obtain a night's shelter in a
  tiny cottage on the far side of the Plain, and a simple breakfast at the
  outlay of a shilling. Then all the next day she trudged through Hampshire,
  until evening found her on the borders of the New Forest, and here she supped
  on a loaf of bread and a jug of milk picked up literally by the wayside, and
  that night she slept by the side of a haystack under the summer stars.</p>

  <p>It was something in the way of a desperate adventure, but Sylvia was not
  frightened or in the least cast down. She knew that every step on the way was
  taking her nearer to London, and once there she had every faith in the
  introduction that Frick had given her. And even if that failed, she knew that
  there were one or two humble members of the company she had been with who,
  poor as they were, would be quite willing to share a dingy lodging with her.
  She calculated by the time she reached London she would have just four
  shillings left. And if that was gone then, her situation would be desperate
  indeed. But that was the thought that she put resolutely out of her mind.</p>

  <p>About midday following she contrived, when in the heart of the New Forest,
  to enlist the sympathies of a kindly old dame, who gave her a substantial
  meal and the opportunities of a thorough wash, so that when she turned out on
  to the road again she felt almost as fresh as she had done when she left
  home. It was very quiet and lonely there in the heart of that beautiful
  country, and as she went along she was conscious, for the first time, of a
  certain uneasiness. It had turned very warm and sultry, and overhead the
  clouds began to gather in an ominous manner. And this was a contingency that
  Sylvia had not reckoned on. Whatever happened she must not get wet, and so
  far as she could see, there was every chance of her being drenched to the
  skin in the course of the next hour.</p>

  <p>She pushed on rapidly till the heavy drops began to fall and the thunder
  growled ominously overhead. Then there was a vivid flash of lightning,
  followed by a crash, and then the rain came down in earnest.</p>

  <p>Sylvia dodged under the trees, making swiftly for a little cart-shed
  thatched with heather that she could see in the distance. She was thankful
  enough to gain this shelter, and there, safe at last, for the next two hours
  she stood there looking at the blurred landscape through a curtain of
  drenching rain. And so it went on till night began to fall, and when it
  cleared up at length Sylvia found herself absolutely alone, without the least
  idea where she was or in what direction to turn.</p>

  <p>Well, if the worst came to the worst, she must spend that night in the
  solitude of that lonely hut. Everything was absolutely drenched; the big
  drops were shaken from the trees, which were moaning of the wind that had got
  up, and, moreover, the floor of the hut was running with water. It was
  impossible to stay there unless she stood up all night, and equally
  impossible to find shelter within a mile or two so far as she knew. There was
  only one thing for it, and that was to get away from the trees into the open
  and find some cart-track along which she could make her way.</p>

  <p>It was comparatively early yet, barely ten o'clock, and Sylvia was feeling
  her courage coming back to her again. She was not too tired to walk for
  another mile or two, nor did she despair of finding shelter somewhere. And so
  far as she could see presently when she reached a comparatively high piece of
  ground there was not a light visible in the whole world. Still, she held
  doggedly on with that fine courage of hers until away in the distance, on the
  edge of the moorland it seemed to her, she could see the twinkle of a
  friendly light. But the light was a great deal further off than she thought
  for, and by the time she reached it her limbs were trembling under her and
  she was feeling faint from want of food.</p>

  <p>The light appeared to shine from the windows of a large bungalow that was
  fenced in from the road and backed by a fringe of high woods. This was no
  farmhouse, no labourer's cottage, Sylvia could see, even in the dark. She
  would have passed by and sought shelter elsewhere, but there was no light to
  be seen anywhere, and presently she took her courage in both hands and walked
  up the pathway.</p>

  <p>But though she knocked and knocked again there was no reply, though from
  both sides of the rustic porch a light shone out. It was very strange, all so
  very still and ominous in that desolate spot so far from civilisation that
  Sylvia began to fear that she had stumbled upon some tragedy. Just for a
  moment she fought with a wild desire to fly back along the path into the
  friendly shelter of the night, then she got herself in hand again and tried
  the handle of the door.</p>

  <p>It yielded to her touch at once. She crept inside and looked about her
  cautiously. She saw a big hall sitting-room, a room paved with flags with a
  large ingle-nook in one corner. It was a cosy, comfortable room, luxuriously
  furnished with fine old stuff; there were good pictures on the walls, and the
  floor was covered with skins of various animals. Opposite the door was a big
  roll-top desk littered with manuscripts and proofs, and on the desk a silver
  lamp. There were big lamps, too, on the side-tables, and in the centre of the
  room a dainty supper had been set out on an old oak table.</p>

  <p>And yet, strangely enough, there was no sign of human life anywhere. It
  was all very mysterious and just a little awe-inspiring. As Sylvia stood
  there, her eyes roamed round the place, taking in everything from the
  luxurious meal on the table to a little pile of letters laid on one of the
  plates. With a spirit of pardonable curiosity Sylvia picked up the letters
  and turned them over in her hand. The second letter fluttered from her
  fingers and dropped on the floor.</p>

  <p>Not before she had seen the address. It was the envelope in her own
  handwriting directed to John Bevill, Esq., at Baron's Court, and obviously
  forwarded on.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; ON THE THORNS.</h2>

  <p class="first">Manby Dorn had taken no heed of Sylvia's characteristic outbreak when she
  had discovered the trick he had played upon her. He had seen her like that
  before. Many a time she had written those letters of his either in sulky
  silence or with a wild outburst of passion, and once, indeed, she had
  actually threatened him with a riding whip. But nothing had come of it, and
  in a day or two the usual cold and distant relationship between father and
  daughter had been restored.</p>

  <p>Sylvia knew him for what he was, a fact that did not disturb him in the
  least. Indeed, why should it, when all the world had put a proper valuation
  on him and treated him accordingly? There were, of course, plenty of people
  in the immediate neighbourhood of his own class who had known him from
  boyhood, and there had been a time when young Manby Dorn had been welcomed
  everywhere. But that time had long ceased. Men of his own class met him and
  passed him as if he had been a stranger; there was not a woman within miles
  who would have spoken to him. Not that he cared; he was long past that. So
  long as he could have his creature comforts and retain a certain measure of
  credit with his tailor, nothing mattered. And the last thing in the world he
  thought of was to give any consideration to the feelings of his wife and
  child.</p>

  <p>Therefore he folded his letter and posted it in his own cynical way. He
  would see Sylvia at lunch, no doubt, then the incident would be forgotten.
  But there was no Sylvia at lunch, and no sign of her anywhere in the house.
  This was rather unusual, and Dorn began to have his misgivings. For Sylvia
  had never behaved in this way before. She had been cold and contemptuous or
  blazingly indignant. And now, apparently, she had vanished, bent upon some
  scheme of her own. That she had little or no money he knew very well. That
  she had left the house and was seen walking down the road with a bag in her
  hand, going in the direction of Tavistock, he discovered later on from a
  road-member by the wayside.</p>

  <p>It was useless to ask Mrs. Dorn anything, of course. She did not know what
  had become of Sylvia, and she did not seem to care. That confused mind of
  hers had long been past comprehension of anything. When Sylvia was with her
  she seemed glad enough for the presence of her daughter, but once the girl
  was out of her sight she might have had no identity at all.</p>

  <p>"Here, wake up," Dorn said. "What's become of Sylvia? Where's the girl
  gone?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dorn shook her head slowly. No gleam of intelligence crept into those
  dark eyes of hers, those eyes that would have been as beautiful as any in the
  world had there been but one spark of expression in them.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. "Sylvia, who is Sylvia? And where has she gone?
  I don't know. I shall find it some day; I shall find it before I die. And
  then she will be happy and comfortable, and I shall die in peace."</p>

  <p>Dorn turned away hopelessly. All this was so much beating in the air. And
  it had been going on more years than he cared to count. It was always the
  same. Whether he treated his wife cruelly or indifferently, or with an
  outbreak of passion, she met it in that absent way of hers; it formed a wall
  so thick than even all his cunning could not get behind it. And so it had
  been ever since that fateful night when, in a moment of drunken passion, he
  had hurled that lamp at her, and Lanton Place had been burnt to the ground.
  It never occurred to him that this tragedy had been the culmination of three
  years of torture and tyranny, and that the fine, sensitive mind of his wife
  had gone down before it. It never occurred to him that his neglect and sinful
  extravagance had led to this deplorable condition of things. It never
  occurred to him, when he was away from home spending his own money and hers,
  that he was leading up to a painful tragedy. All he knew now was that he had
  come to the end of his tether, and that he was saddled with a mad wife and a
  daughter who hated and despised him. And, indeed, things were very critical.
  He was at the limit of his resources. He could not think of even one of those
  little criminal schemes of his which had hitherto been successful. If this
  man Bevill failed him now, then within a few hours the Dorns would be on the
  verge of starvation. It was a black and bitter outlook, rendered all the more
  depressing by Sylvia's sudden disappearance.</p>

  <p>Where was she? Where was she gone? Dorn asked himself over and over again
  during the next day or so. It had been so unlike Sylvia to go off like this.
  And Tavistock was not very far off. Had she revolted at length? Had she made
  up her mind that at last she would expose him? Was it her intention to call
  upon John Bevill and throw herself upon his mercy?</p>

  <p>But no, she would never do that; she would never forget that he was her
  father, and that any confession of hers would place him in the reach of the
  police, whom he knew had been only too anxious to lay him by the heels for
  many years. There was comfort in the thought that Sylvia would not so far
  forget herself. And yet, why had she gone? Why had she disappeared in this
  strange fashion without saying a word to anyone?</p>

  <p>Over this problem Dorn brooded for the best part of two days. He even
  roused himself so far as to walk into Tavistock and make a few inquiries. It
  was quite a relief to learn that Mr. Bevill was not at Baron's Court for the
  moment, so that if Sylvia had called there to see him she would most
  certainly have been disappointed. And beside, Dorn was not the sort of man to
  address that begging letter to Baron's Court without first having ascertained
  something about the man he was addressing. And it was characteristic of Dorn,
  too, that he cared absolutely nothing what happened to Sylvia so long as she
  did not betray him. He could have heard without a single regret that she had
  been found dead at the bottom of the Dart. He was thinking of himself
  always.</p>

  <p>At any rate, it was good to discover that Bevill was away from home, that
  nobody knew where he was or when he was likely to return. So Dorn, neat and
  immaculate as usual, plodded his way homeward, relieved in his mind to a
  certain extent and, at the same time, deeply annoyed because he had failed
  with those blandishments of his to elicit a further meed of credit from a
  local wine merchant. There was absolutely nothing to drink in the house, his
  last cigar was between his lips, and the prospect was dreary enough. There
  was a certain amount of food which he partook of later on, seated moodily at
  the table opposite the wife, who never spoke to him now and, indeed, never
  spoke to anyone unless in reply to a direct question. It was like sitting at
  a table with a corpse, some dread skeleton opposite him that reminded him
  vaguely of the past. He was glad to get it all over presently and shut
  himself in the library.</p>

  <p>And there he sat till the light faded and the stars crept out, one by one;
  sat there moodily with an empty pipe in his mouth, and an empty glass by his
  side. He heard the one old servant fasten up the front door, he heard his
  wife creeping restlessly up to her bedroom. Then he opened the window and
  stepped out into the still night.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, what a life!" he murmured to himself. "What an existence! Where
  is it going to end? Where&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He pulled up suddenly, conscious of a solitary figure standing there
  against the background of the ragged shrubbery. It seemed to him that the
  figure carried something in its hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" Dorn demanded.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, sir," the man said civilly enough. "I didn't want to
  disturb you or anybody in the house. I am one of the warders from the convict
  prison."</p>

  <p>As the man spoke he turned, and in the dim starlight Dorn could see that
  he carried a rifle in his hand. The sheen of his peaked cap was visible in
  the gloom.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Dorn asked. "One of those poor devils managed to get away I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the warder said. "Yesterday afternoon. There are a dozen of us
  out altogether and we have tracked him as far as here. We are bound to have
  him before morning. This isn't a bad hiding-place of yours, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are about right there," Dorn said bitterly. "It's an absolute
  wilderness. But we've got no outbuildings he can secrete himself in. Have you
  been all through the shrubbery? Plenty of cover there."</p>

  <p>"There are two other men with me, sir," the warder explained. "And we've
  been all over the place. Don't let us disturb you, sir. You can go back into
  the house with an easy mind."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite so sure of that," Dorn said. "I am practically alone here
  without a weapon, and the man you are looking after is pretty sure to be
  desperate. By the way, has he managed to change his clothes?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he has, sir&mdash;at least he was in prison clothes when he
  was seen by a workman a couple of hours ago. You had better go back to the
  house, sir, I think."</p>

  <p>Dorn made his way listlessly back again and re-entered the library by
  means of the window. At any rate, this had made a pleasant little break in
  the most dreary monotonous evening ever remembered. He was half-inclined to
  stay outside there and join in the man hunt. But then he thought of that
  immaculate suit he was wearing, and decided that on the whole he was better
  off where he was. He sat there gazing into the darkness till the church clock
  struck one, waiting and perhaps hoping for something to happen. Just as he
  was about to close the window the crack of a rifle broke the silence. Then
  there was a shout, followed by another shot.</p>

  <p>Dorn could hear a confused voice in the distance, then a figure flashed
  from the bushes and came headlong in the direction of the open window. It was
  no convict this, but a man dressed in a suit of dark grey with a smart cap on
  the back of his head. He came forward eagerly enough, furtive and desperate,
  and stood in front of Dorn with his hand on the window-ledge. Dorn could hear
  him panting with his exertions. Then, without any warning or invitation, the
  fugitive fell over the window-sill fairly into the room, and as coolly as his
  condition permitted softly pulled the window down.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; OLD FRIENDS.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Put that lamp out," he whispered. "Blow the lamp out and pull the blind
  down, Dorn."</p>

  <p>There was a certain quick ring of command in the stranger's voice that
  caused Dorn mechanically to obey. Not that he was not nervous and uneasy,
  because he was. Dorn was by no means the sort of man that heroes are made of,
  and even if he had been so naturally, the life he had been leading of recent
  years would have taken all the nerve and courage out of him. But the fact
  that this man knew him was ominous. The way in which he spoke subtly conveyed
  the impression that one scoundrel was talking to another. With a hand that
  trembled, Dorn pulled the blind down and lowered the flame of the lamp. He
  would have put it out altogether but for certain prudent instincts.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that for the moment," the fugitive replied. "Yes, perhaps on
  the whole you are right. You always were a cunning beggar, Dorn. If you had
  put the light out suddenly, those devils outside would have spotted at once
  that something was going on. And I expect your reputation is pretty well
  known in this neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>Dorn listened with a certain rising feeling of irritation. He knew that he
  was safe now from any violence at the hands of this audacious intruder. This
  man was in desperate straits, and he was certain not to be rash enough to lay
  hands on one who was shielding him from authority. And, moreover, though Dorn
  could make nothing of the blurred outline of the stranger's face, he could
  see that this man was not in convict garb, and that he had hit upon another
  adventure altogether. And with it all was the feeling of annoyance that we
  all experience when we recognise a voice without being in a position to
  connect it with its owner. And that was what Dorn felt. He was wondering
  where he had heard that voice before.</p>

  <p>"But look here," he began.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool," the intruder interrupted. "They have got a pretty
  good idea where I am. One of those chaps outside must have seen me cross the
  open, or he wouldn't have fired. It was a bit of infernally bad luck running
  straight into the arms of those fellows. But then it's been one of my unlucky
  evenings. Ah, here they come. Push me under that sofa, behind that pile of
  papers. Ask them to come in. Tell them that you heard the shot fired and that
  somebody ran by just as you were pulling down the windows preparatory to
  going to bed. Now, go on; don't keep them waiting."</p>

  <p>Dorn pulled himself together. On the whole, this was a congenial job. Here
  was some scoundrel who knew him, some forgotten accomplice in crime to whom
  he was doing a good turn, and there might be a corresponding advantage in it
  somewhere. Therefore Dorn proceeded to open the front door and admit a couple
  of policemen, together with a man in his shirt sleeves, who might, from his
  appearance, have been an upper servant.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to trouble you, sir," one of the policemen said. "But this is Mr.
  Gregory Smith's butler. There was an attempt to burgle the house about an
  hour ago, and the burglar was traced as far as your grounds. By good luck
  some prison warders were hunting for a convict here, and the fellow ran into
  them. They very nearly had him, and we think he must have got into your house
  somehow. One of the windows was open&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was," Dorn said. "I was speaking to the warders some time ago, and I
  have been sitting in the open window of my library ever since. I had just
  closed it, and was turning the lamp down with the idea of going to bed, when
  I heard a couple of shots fired. So, you see, there can be nobody here. We'll
  go round the house if you like, but I don't think you'll find a single door
  or window unfastened."</p>

  <p>The policeman hesitated for a moment, obviously impressed by evidence as
  direct as this, before he suggested that it would be just as well to look
  around, which they did under Dorn's guidance, only to retire a few moments
  later fully convinced that there was nothing further to be done so far as the
  inside of the house was concerned. They disappeared presently, with many
  apologies, leaving Dorn to return eagerly to the library, where he had turned
  up the lamp.</p>

  <p>"Now come on," he said. "Come out and let me have a look at you. You seem
  to know me well enough, but I prefer not to have all the advantage on one
  side."</p>

  <p>With a laugh the stranger crept out from under the couch and stood there
  before Dorn, a fine, upright, handsome figure of a man with regular features
  and a pair of flashing black eyes. He was quite well-dressed, exceedingly
  neat and natty with his small black moustache and tiny pointed beard,
  obviously a gentleman to outward appearances, and a man certainly accustomed
  to move in good circles. His long slim hands were assuredly those of an
  artist.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't you know me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"De Barsac," Dorn cried. "Victor de Barsac, as I am a living sinner. Now,
  tell me, what is the most famous sculptor in Europe doing here like this? And
  tell me, why is the spoilt child of princes and the darling of society up to
  this sort of thing? Oh, come de Barsac!"</p>

  <p>"Well, you never know," the other man said, as he dropped into a chair. "I
  am supposed to be a man in the enjoyment of a princely income, and, to a
  certain extent, I am. But there never was enough money in the world for me,
  and there never will be. Light come, light go, you know. I tell you, Dorn, I
  am fairly up against it. I haven't a score of pounds in the world I can call
  my own, and moreover, if I can't lay my hand upon a few hundreds within the
  next few days, then I am as good as a convict. You remember, it was always
  the same with me. Now, how many years was it since we were in that little
  business together? It must be quite ten."</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind that," Dorn said impatiently. "What are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Well, at present I am the guest of that distinguished scientist and
  eccentric millionaire John Bevill. I suppose you know his name well
  enough."</p>

  <p>Dorn started, but controlled himself quickly. It was no policy of his to
  tell this old acquaintance in crime what he knew about the wealthy John
  Bevill.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know his name," he said. "But what are you doing in his
  house?"</p>

  <p>"Well it's like this. Bevill has a perfect menagerie at Baron's Court, and
  when I asked him to let me come down and make a study of some of the animals
  he was good enough to put Baron's Court at my disposal. He is not there
  himself. He is hidden away in some secret retreat, where he is finishing a
  book, and has left me and one or two other friends of his in charge of the
  house. Here I am, a potential millionaire, living on the fat of the land in a
  famous mansion and hard up for a five pound note!"</p>

  <p>"No treasures there?" Dorn asked cynically. "Nothing you can lay your
  hands on?"</p>

  <p>"Heaps of them, my dear boy, heaps of them," de Barsac smiled. "But that's
  too dangerous a game. The stakes are too big for that. I daren't touch
  anything there, and all the more so because Bevill is quite an old man and I
  know that I am down on his will for a thumping big legacy. And that's why I
  don't want him to know my desperate position. I had to have money, so I
  planned a little burglary of my own&mdash;by no means the first&mdash;on a
  house in this neighbourhood, and I should have got away with the stuff all
  right but for a bit of sheer bad luck. I was practically caught by that old
  butler and made a bolt for it in this direction. Then, when I got in a tight
  place, I thought about you, and that's just where my luck was out again, for
  I ran bang into the arms of a lot of warders who are looking for a convict.
  If I hadn't happened to have seen that window of yours open, I should have
  been nabbed to a dead certainty with the tools in my pocket. My word, what a
  sensation that would have been for all my dainty society friends! But I think
  it's all right now. 'Pon my word, you look pretty snug here, in spite of all
  I hear from certain shady acquaintances to the contrary. Come, give me a
  drink and a cigar."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," Dorn said. "I haven't so much as a glass of beer in the
  house. And I smoked my last cigar yesterday. There isn't a pipe of tobacco on
  the premises. You seem to be up against it pretty hard, but at any rate you
  have got comfortable quarters where you have everything to your hand. I have
  struck a rotten bad patch. Literally I am down to my last few shillings, and
  I'm hanged if I know where the next are coming from. Haven't you got a
  cigarette?"</p>

  <p>De Barsac laid a silver cigarette case on the table and Dorn grasped it
  with avidity. The Spaniard watched him with a cynical smile and a certain
  narrowing of his eyelids.</p>

  <p>"Let's sit down and talk," he said abruptly. "So far as I can gather, we
  both seem to be in the soup together. You are no fool, Dorn, and there was a
  time when you didn't want for courage. Now, I must have money, and a lot of
  it. So far as I can see, so must you."</p>

  <p>"I'd sell my soul for it," Dorn said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Then you can come in if you like. It ought to be worth
  anything up to two thousand pounds&mdash;perhaps more. I have mortgaged all
  my commissions, in fact I can't raise an honest penny anywhere. So I must try
  the other track. Only I must have you with me, where I can show you the
  ground. Now, suppose you come over to Baron's Court to-morrow and stay the
  night. I can give you all the de Rothschild's cigars' and vintage champagne
  you can drink. Oh, dash it, you can bring back a case or two if you please,
  and as to a few boxes of cigars, well, they're yours for the asking. But
  mind, you must be careful. There are two other men staying in the house, not
  our type at all. But one of them is about as cute as they make 'em. Not that
  they will interfere with us. I am only giving you a word of warning. I can
  send a car over for you and we can go into our plans carefully. It's
  dangerous, I don't mind telling you that, but the stakes are immense. Now, in
  one word, Dorn, are you on?"</p>

  <p>Dorn held out a hand silently.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; BARON'S COURT.</h2>

  <p class="first">Dorn sat in the luxurious library at Baron's Court facing de Barsac, who
  lounged in a big chair opposite him and discoursed more or less casually on
  the scheme that he had laid out. It was yet fairly early in the afternoon,
  and Dorn had arrived in the car which had been sent for him directly after
  lunch. He had come prepared to enjoy himself and hoping to do a fine stroke
  of business at the same time. He sat there with a choice cigar between his
  lips, well content with his surroundings and determined to take the gift that
  the gods had provided, and enjoy them as long as he possibly could. So with
  the prospect of comfortable quarters before him, and the anticipation of a
  dinner the like of which he had not enjoyed for a long time, he was quite
  prepared to wait upon events.</p>

  <p>He had come over there with that complete wardrobe of his much as if he
  had been an honoured guest who had been invited indefinitely, and, indeed, so
  far as he was concerned, he proposed to make it as indefinite as
  possible.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word," he said, "you seem to have fallen upon your feet here, de
  Barsac. You are, to all practical purposes, the master of a fine house
  without any of its responsibilities. But how long is it going to last?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the remotest idea," de Barsac said coolly. "As long as I can
  make it, you can depend upon that. You see, this is my position. I have
  mortgaged my commissions for about a year ahead by drawing money on account,
  so that I can't put my hand upon a shilling. I told you last night that I
  wanted some money desperately, so desperately, indeed, that I had to run a
  big risk, as you know."</p>

  <p>Dorn flicked the end off his cigar. He had his own schemes to think of,
  and the question he proceeded to put carelessly enough to de Barsac meant a
  good deal to him.</p>

  <p>"Um&mdash;yes, I understand," he said thoughtfully. "It is always my
  position. And I suppose the amiable old man wouldn't be disposed to help
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he might. He is very eccentric, but hot-headed and generous where
  he takes, but, at the same time, he doesn't entirely lack worldly shrewdness.
  Now, he regards me as a successful man, which, indeed, I am, and a great
  sculptor, which, without egotism, I am also. But if he knew the truth, he
  might possibly prefer my room to my company, and then I should be
  finished."</p>

  <p>"But you say he is generous?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, amazingly so. Never listens to a story of distress without putting
  his hand in his pocket."</p>

  <p>Dorn smiled to himself. All this sounded very promising for his own little
  scheme.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose we shall have to make the best of it," he said. "Now, we
  are quite alone here, where nobody can hear. Tell me what you have got in the
  back of your mind."</p>

  <p>De Barsac hesitated. Evidently he did not care to utter his thoughts
  aloud, and, indeed, the scheme that he had in the back of his mind was so
  black a one that he hardly liked to mention it to a confederate even as
  unscrupulous as Dorn.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," he murmured. "I haven't thought it out quite. It's very
  dangerous, so dangerous indeed that if anything came to light we should both
  have a strong chance of finding ourselves&mdash;well, don't ask me to be more
  definite."</p>

  <p>"In goal, do you mean?" Dorn whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, in gaol, and perhaps worse than that. You know what I mean."</p>

  <p>Dorn wriggled about uncomfortably. Just for a moment his heart seemed to
  stand still. For there was no mistaking the dread significance of de Barsac's
  words. And, unscrupulous as he was, Dorn shrank back from the idea of taking
  life, for that was unquestionably what de Barsac meant. There was every
  evidence of it in the droop of his voice, in the averted glance of those
  sinister eyes of his and that compression of his lips.</p>

  <p>"But we need not go into that yet," he said. "All I want to know is
  whether you are with me or not."</p>

  <p>Dorn bent eagerly forward.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," he whispered. "I don't like it in the least. But
  there's one thing I like less, and that is the miserable poverty-stricken
  life that I have been leading for the last year or two. I never know from day
  to day how am going to live to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't talk about your scruples," de Barsac said.</p>

  <p>"Scruples. Bless the man, I haven't one. 'Pon my word, I believe I was
  born without any. But this is a serious thing. I don't mind crime, I don't
  mind running the risk of imprisonment if there is a sporting chance on my
  side. But when it comes to taking life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who said anything about the taking of life?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nobody. Not in as many words. But you and I are here alone together
  and we understand one another, and that's what you meant."</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose I did. What then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, we shall have to discuss it some time or another. How much do
  you expect, I mean how much do you expect this eccentric old gentleman to
  leave you?"</p>

  <p>"Anything between forty and fifty thousand pounds&mdash;perhaps more. And
  I want it now, Dorn."</p>

  <p>"And you don't mind how you get it?"</p>

  <p>De Barsac nodded gloomily.</p>

  <p>"That's about what it comes to," he said. "I must have the money, and if
  you can help me, why I don't mind giving you a quarter of it. So now you
  understand. Only it will have to be very carefully thought out."</p>

  <p>Dorn helped himself to a fresh cigar.</p>

  <p>"I see that," he said thoughtfully. "Now if you and I were alone together
  here with the old gentleman it might not be so very difficult. But what about
  the other people in the house? Who are they, and how long are they likely to
  stay?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that I can't tell you," de Barsac exclaimed. "As a matter of fact,
  there are two of them, and I believe they both intend to remain here till
  Bevill returns. One of them is Sir Watney Gibson."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Dorn said with some show of interest. "I suppose you mean the
  famous surgeon? The rather hot-headed Irishman who is always indulging in
  controversies with his confreres in the scientific papers."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the man," de Barsac said. "He is hot-headed and impetuous, I
  know; but, at the same time, he is a long way from being a child in worldly
  matters. He gives you the impression of simplicity, but I should be very
  sorry to make an enemy of him, and the man who tried to deceive him would
  assuredly get the worst of it. His companion is a certain Lionel Markham, a
  young Oxford man who acts as his secretary. I believe they are down here on
  some scientific errand. They don't trouble about me, and I don't trouble
  about them. I have got a big barn out here in the grounds fitted up as a
  studio, and there I spend most of my time. It's a funny sort of household on
  the whole. Of course, I know it is magnificently furnished and everything
  here is of the very best. A man like you, who appreciates a good dinner and a
  bottle of the right sort of wine, will understand that presently. But Bevill
  thinks more of his animals than all the rest of the world put together. With
  the possible exception of Tring Park. Baron's Court boasts the finest private
  menagerie in the kingdom. And that's why I am down here. I never touch
  anything, but animals, as you know, and I am making a particular study just
  now of some remarkably fine tigers. You see, I understand them. I have been
  studying all sorts of animals. With the exception of one particular vicious
  brute, there isn't a cage here that I haven't entered. And that is where my
  opportunity might come in."</p>

  <p>Dorn's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"I think I understand," he said. "You mean some sort of accident? An
  accident that might happen to anybody who chanced to be with you some
  day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dorn's voice trailed off as he spoke, and he saw that de Barsac avoided
  his glance.</p>

  <p>"Well, something like that," the latter muttered. "It's all infernally
  difficult and whichever way I look I can see danger staring me in the face.
  That's why you may be able to help me. You were always a very cunning chap,
  Dorn. Think it over. There's time at least for you to do that."</p>

  <p>Dorn sat there drawing nervously at his cigar and glancing round the
  luxurious room as if in search of inspiration, when the door of the room
  opened and a strange object came in. At the first glance it seemed to Dorn
  that he was looking at a man, and then, in the light of what he had just
  learnt, he saw that it was an ape, or rather a chimpanzee, a queer, wizened,
  misshapen creature in evening dress, a caricature of a man with long hairy
  arms and a preternaturally solemn face. It was so strange and unexpected that
  Dorn fairly started.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce have you got here?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>De Barsac smiled as he saw the startled expression on the face of his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better make the introduction with due formality," he said
  gravely. "Let me introduce you to Vim, the most remarkable simian in the
  world. To all practical purposes Vim is a man; he can do everything but talk,
  and, indeed, Bevill swears that he has a language all right if anybody could
  only understand him. Apart from that, he lives just the same sort of life as
  you and I. He dresses for dinner, and comes down to meals with us, where he
  eats and drinks discriminately and takes a cigar afterwards. He has the bad
  taste to rather dislike me in the house. Here, Vim, come and shake hands with
  this gentleman."</p>

  <p>The chimpanzee crossed the room and placed his hairy paw in Dorn's
  reluctant fingers.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, what a household!" the latter murmured.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; AT DINNER.</h2>

  <p class="first">A thin drift of cigarette smoke sifted over the dining-table at Baron's
  Court, where four men were seated in deep enjoyment of the coffee and
  liqueurs that followed a perfectly served meal. At the upper end of the table
  de Barsac, in his capacity as deputy host, lounged back idly in his chair,
  for he liked to sit there for half an hour or so after the evening meal
  talking idly on the events of the day. The big room was half in shadow, with
  a couple of lamps casting pools of light on flowers and ferns and fruit, on
  the ruby flush of wines in Venetian decanters and glinting on certain
  matchless old silver and priceless Sevres. Here and there, on the dark walls,
  a spot of light gleamed upon the electric bulbs that stood like lighted
  shrines in front of Bevill's famous pictures. It was one harmonious scene of
  luxury and refinement and wealth, and suggested nothing of the tragedy that
  was hanging like a black and sinister cloud over that fine old house.</p>

  <p>Seated at the head of the table there, de Barsac looked the role he was
  playing to the life. He gave the impression of power and strength and success
  in every line of him. His handsome face was lit up with a pleasant smile,
  though there were people who declared that his eyes were a little too close
  together and that those strong lips of his were thin and cruel. But then, no
  great man is without his enemies.</p>

  <p>The elderly man seated opposite to him, the man with the youthful face and
  quick, restless manner, was Sir Watney Gibson, the famous surgeon, and
  perhaps, in his fierce moments, the most pugnacious man that ever made a
  reputation in Harley-street. Always ready to fight for his theories, and
  somewhat intolerant of the opinions of other people, he was yet one of the
  kindliest of Irishmen and a veritable boy in heart, despite his seventy odd
  years. But if any criminal ever deluded himself with the idea that this
  manner covered a native simplicity, then that criminal would have been
  mistaken. For more than one of them had found his way from the Central
  Criminal Court to the dock owing to the brilliant and amazing research of
  Watney Gibson. The young man on his left was his distant relative and
  assistant, Lionel Markham, a young Oxford man who was just beginning to make
  a mark for himself.</p>

  <p>The figures round the table were completed by the chimpanzee, who lounged
  there with a cigarette in his mouth and a tiny liqueur glass at his elbow, a
  quaint imitation of a man of the world in a mood of relaxation. Those queer
  little eyes of his seemed to be taking in all that was going on around him,
  and when the others laughed he threw back that wizened head of his and
  laughed too. He looked quiet and amiable enough now, though he had his moods
  and his little displays of temper, during which the whole household gave him
  a wide berth, for he had the strength of a lion and the tenacity of a
  bulldog. But these intervals were few and far between, and a reproachful
  glance from his beloved master was usually sufficient to restore the great
  ape to his normal serenity of mind.</p>

  <p>Sir Watney, out of the corner of his eye, was watching Vim with keen
  interest.</p>

  <p>"I tell you you are wrong," the great surgeon broke out into a sudden
  explosion. "Bless me, de Barsac, do you think I don't know? Why, I am just as
  well acquainted with the habits of animals as my old friend John Bevill. I
  tell you yonder creature, to all practical purpose, is a man. Look at him. Do
  you mean to tell me he doesn't know what I am saying?"</p>

  <p>The ape seated there grinned and chattered.</p>

  <p>"There, what did I tell you?" Gibson went on. "Ah, my boy, if we could
  only translate his language, we should know all about the missing link. I
  don't care a hang what the authorities say, I tell you, to all practical
  purposes, Vim is a man. Why, he's got the same teeth we have, and the same
  feet and hands. If you will give me some of your modelling wax, I will take
  an impression of his fingers and show you what I mean. You call it a paw, I
  say it's a hand. Look here, de Barsac, I wish you would do me a favour.
  You're about the only man I know who can do it. I want you to let me have an
  exact impression of Vim's arm in bronze. You'll know all about it when I go
  for that ignoramus Watson in next month's 'Scientific Review.' Will you do it
  for me? Or if you get the wax I'll take the impression now. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm agreeable," de Barsac smiled. "It's all in my line, of course. I
  haven't touched anything but animals for years. That's why I am down here. I
  only wish I could afford to make a change sometimes."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Oh come, none of your modesty, my boy," he said. "There isn't a man in
  Europe in your line who's making half so much money as you are. You must be
  drawing the income of a prince."</p>

  <p>De Barsac smiled as he rose and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's all very well," he said. "But if you happen to spend the
  income of a king at the same time, that doesn't go very far. Yes, I rang,
  Jackson. Go into the studio and bring me back a large piece of modelling
  wax."</p>

  <p>The well-trained servant returned presently with the wax, and for the next
  half-hour or so Sir Watney was busy taking the exact impression of Vim's hand
  and forearm. At first it had not been an easy job, for the great simian
  showed certain signs of resentment; but presently, as he glanced into the
  smiling faces around him, he seemed to enter into the spirit of the game, and
  smiled and chattered, till at length Sir Watney professed himself to be
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>"There, my boy," he said. "I flatter myself that's a good job. If you
  reproduce that properly as you can, you will have the finest model of
  muscular strength in a condensed form that exists anywhere. And I believe
  Vim's proud of it. Look at him, grinning all over his face, like some pretty
  girl who is listening to a piece of subtle flattery."</p>

  <p>The party rose from the table presently and scattered themselves about the
  house. Sir Watney made his way in the direction of the billiard-room,
  accompanied by his young relative, who had sat unusually silent throughout
  the whole of dinner. They played a game of billiards, then sat down in the
  solitude of the big room to a final cigar.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, my boy?" Sir Watney asked. "You're not usually so
  quiet."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I'm a bit puzzled," Markham said. "And perhaps a bit uneasy
  too. Do you know anything about Major Dorn? Have you met him before?"</p>

  <p>"Never saw him in my life," Sir Watney replied. "This is a funny sort of
  household, Lionel, and you meet some queer people here occasionally. I make a
  point of asking no questions when I come to Baron's Court. And if you take my
  advice you'll accept things as you find them. I always do. John Bevill is by
  way of being a philanthropist, and philanthropy finds itself in strange
  company."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that, sir. But between ourselves, when we are alone here, how
  does the Major strike you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if you put it like that," Sir Watney said, "he doesn't strike me at
  all pleasantly. I don't like the look of the man. He is a gentleman by birth,
  of course, I know. Anybody could see that. But he strikes me as being cunning
  and shifty, and he drinks a great deal too much. He must have had quite a
  bottle of champagne at dinner, to say nothing of other wines and liqueurs.
  But if it comes to that, I don't care much for de Barsac either. It may be
  prejudice on my part, but I don't much fancy a man whose eyes are as close
  together as his. But why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Markham said. "You will remember before I came to you
  I had a fancy for going into the City. I spent two or three months in the
  office of a man called Lupas, who described himself as at general broker. As
  a matter of fact, he was a money-lender of the worst type and mixed up in
  many shady transactions, though you may be sure I was not allowed to learn
  much on that side. I left him finally because that sort of work was not in
  the least congenial, but I do remember seeing some correspondence which was
  not intended to fall into my hands between Lupas and a certain Major Dorn,
  who resided somewhere in Devonshire. I don't know for certain, but I should
  think this Dorn is a bit of a scoundrel. That's why I asked you that
  question. It's no business of mine, but I'm certain that fellow's here for no
  good. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Markham broke off and hesitated. He looked just a little confused and
  there was a dash of colour in his face.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Sir Watney said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this, sir," Markham proceeded. "When I was taking my
  holiday on the east coast last summer I amused myself for a week or so
  playing a small part with a travelling company. You know how fond I am of
  theatricals. And with this company I met a jolly old chap called Maxwell
  Frick, an elderly comedian of the Mark Tapley type who used to be at
  Cambridge years ago. And he introduced me to a girl called Dorn&mdash;Sylvia
  Dorn. A beautiful girl, well-bred and refined, and quite out of her class
  with a company like that. I saw a good deal of her at the time, and she told
  me that her home was in Devonshire. My dear uncle, she was a remarkably nice
  girl, and&mdash;well, I don't mind telling you I hope to meet her again. She
  didn't say much, but somehow I was sorry for her, and if this man Dorn is her
  father I am sorrier for her still."</p>

  <p>"Um! quite a romance." Sir Watney yawned as he rose to his feet.
  "Good-night, my boy; I'm going to bed."</p>

  <p>For a long time Markham sat at his open bedroom window looking out
  thoughtfully over the silent park. He was disturbed and uneasy in his mind
  and not at all inclined for sleep. Then he heard a door closed softly
  somewhere, and presently two figures appeared through the
  darkness&mdash;figures that appeared to be making their way cautiously across
  the park. Markham's eyes were clear and keen, so that he had no great
  difficulty in making the figures out as those of Dorn and de Barsac.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I wonder what those two rascals are after," he murmured to himself.
  "No good, I'll swear."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE SILENT HOUSE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia stood there irresolutely, with the envelope in her hand. It was a
  desperate situation, and one that she recognised with a heart that beat fast
  and a certain dizziness that caused the room to revolve round and make her
  feel weak at the knees. A cruel situation for a girl to find herself in, and
  one that, for the moment, entirely overpowered her.</p>

  <p>Her first impulse was to sit down on the nearest chair and give way to
  tears. But then tears were not Sylvia's way; she had been brought up in too
  hard a school for that. She could be soft and yielding enough when the
  atmosphere was right, but, on the other hand, she had learnt to look out for
  herself, and she had always known since she had come to years of discretion
  that those criminal practices of her father must end, one day, in dire
  disaster.</p>

  <p>But she had always hoped and prayed that when the time came she would be
  far away from the trouble. And yet here it was, and gripping her in its toils
  like a serpent. And again there was the cruel and amazing coincidence of the
  whole thing. It was as if fate had conspired to drag her into it.</p>

  <p>Well, whatever happened, she would speak the truth when the time came. She
  would not stand quietly by and see her whole career blasted for the sake of a
  worthless man, though he did happen to be her own father. And once she had
  made up her mind to this, the natural courage of the girl came back to her.
  Gradually she got a grip upon herself, gradually the room ceased to revolve
  round her, and every article there came back to her in its proper
  perspective. She opened the flap of the envelope to look inside and see for
  herself whether or not her worst fears were realised. And then she discovered
  that what she held in her hand was nothing but the envelope, neatly slit
  open, and the letter itself was not to be found. Somebody had opened it, no
  doubt, and had placed the contents on one side for further consideration.
  Well, she knew the worst of that, at any rate. And she would have been,
  perhaps, easier in her mind had she known what had become of the photograph.
  The letter in itself was nothing by comparison; it was the photograph that
  would cause trouble for her.</p>

  <p>Just for an instant Sylvia was almost tempted to turn her back upon the
  silent bungalow and seek shelter and safety in the darkness of the night. If
  she could get away without being recognised, she might still save the
  situation.</p>

  <p>The storm which had lulled for a time broke out with redoubled violence,
  the thunder crashed overhead, and the storm of rain, driven by the force of
  the wind, pelted on the windows like a volley of musketry. No, there was no
  escape that way. With all Sylvia's courage and resolution, she could not face
  the open country on such a night as this. Therefore, she resigned herself to
  the inevitable, and, pulling up a chair, seated herself in front of the fire.
  There must be someone about somewhere, she told herself; the people who
  inhabited the bungalow could not be very far away. It was impossible to
  believe the place had been actually deserted. So she sat there for half an
  hour or more until she heard the door open presently and a moment or two
  later a man entered the room.</p>

  <p>Sylvia could see that his handsome face was wet, that his boots were muddy
  and sodden, and his neat black suit was dry enough, and he had the air of a
  man who is quite at home. His face was set and firm, almost like that of a
  mask; his black hair was brushed back from his forehead, and a pair of
  singularly lustreless eyes regarded Sylvia without surprise and much as if
  the new-comer had expected to find her there.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," she said. "I had to come here. I was walking through
  the woods when the storm overtook me, and I came here because I saw a light.
  As no one answered the door to my ring, I ventured to come inside."</p>

  <p>It sounded very unconvincing, even to Sylvia's own ears, but apparently
  the black-haired man standing there in the doorway seemed to see nothing
  wrong about it, for he merely bowed in the respectful manner of a
  well-trained servant and proceeded without speech to arrange one or two
  articles on the table. Then he turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p>"One moment," Sylvia said. "I am afraid you don't quite understand."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly, madam," the man said. "You came here to seek
  shelter."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I did," Sylvia replied. "But that is not everything. Would you
  mind telling me to whom I am indebted for this kindness, and to whom this
  bungalow belongs?"</p>

  <p>"It belongs to my master," the man replied.</p>

  <p>"So I presume. But would you be good enough to tell me the name of your
  employer?"</p>

  <p>It seemed to Sylvia that the man looked a little uneasy, but no more
  uneasy than she felt herself.</p>

  <p>"Professor John Bevill," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed, and is he here?"</p>

  <p>"Not for the moment, madam. But he will not be long. He won't be more than
  an hour at the outside."</p>

  <p>With that the reticent individual with the black hair turned his back upon
  Sylvia and walked out of the room. It was all extraordinary, so amazingly
  unconventional, that despite her difficulties and anxieties Sylvia could
  hardly restrain a smile. Still, there was consolation in the knowledge that
  this silent, well-trained servant had accepted her presence there as a matter
  of course. Evidently he had regarded her as a lady, and equally he had
  believed all that she had to say&mdash;but by no means the kind of thing
  likely to happen in the ordinary conventional household. There was nothing
  for it, therefore, but to sit quietly before the fire and to wait the advent
  of someone more human than the man with the black hair. And all this time the
  rain was coming down in torrents and the bungalow was shaking with the force
  of the storm. Then, presently, it seemed to Sylvia that she could hear the
  sound of wheels outside, followed by the toot of a horn, and a moment or two
  later someone else walked into the room.</p>

  <p>It was a woman of apparently about fifty years of age, tall and with a
  kindly face framed in hair that was rapidly turning to silver on the temples.
  The new-comer flung aside a big cloak, with a hood, and disclosed a typical
  nurse's uniform. Then she turned with a look of surprise in those dark eyes
  of hers, but with a tiny smile in them that gave Sylvia fresh courage. It
  seemed to her, just for an instant, that the smile gave place to a
  half-startled expression that might, indeed, have been one of recognition;
  but it was only for a moment, and then the kindly look was back in those dark
  eyes again.</p>

  <p>Here was someone, Sylvia thought, who might be a friend. Here was someone
  that perhaps she could confide in. She rose from her seat by the fire and
  crossed the room.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you will say or think to find me here," she said. "But
  I hope that you won't resent this intrusion."</p>

  <p>"On a night like this?" the other asked. "Oh, surely not. You are quite
  welcome."</p>

  <p>"I thought you would say that," Sylvia murmured. "I thought you would say
  that directly I saw you. I was walking&mdash;well, I was walking&mdash;oh,
  perhaps I had better tell you the truth. I was walking to London, because I
  hadn't the money to pay my railway fare, and I got caught in this awful
  storm."</p>

  <p>"You are very wet?" the other asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least wet," Sylvia cried. "I managed to get here before
  the rain came down in earnest. I saw the light of the bungalow through the
  trees, and I thought that I might beg shelter for an hour or two until the
  storm was over. I knocked at the door two or three times, but no one came,
  and then I began to feel that something was wrong here. I was terrified, too,
  by the storm and the loneliness, so I ventured to try the door and found that
  it was not fastened. So I plucked up my courage and came in expecting to find
  all sorts of horrors here. And then, to my surprise, I discovered that the
  house was empty. After that a servant&mdash;or I suppose he is a
  servant&mdash;came in, and I tried to explain. For some reason or another he
  took my presence here as a matter of course."</p>

  <p>The woman smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he would," she said. "Garrass is an excellent servant, but the
  quietest and most taciturn man I have ever met. I don't think an earthquake
  would disturb him. A most peculiar creature, who hates everybody in the world
  except his employer, and for Mr. Bevill I believe he would die. But do sit
  down and make yourself at home. You must stay the night here now. You will
  excuse me asking, but have you had anything to eat lately?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia's cheeks flushed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that does not matter," she said. "I am not particularly hungry."</p>

  <p>"Is that true?" the woman asked. "No, I can see it isn't. Now, my dear
  young lady, I'm a nurse, and I understand these sort of things. Mr. Bevill
  won't be very long, and he won't be in the least annoyed if we sit down and
  have supper before he comes back. He is a bit strange and eccentric perhaps,
  but one of the kindest-hearted men in the world. When he hears your story I
  know he will ask you to stay here as long as you like. He always does. Now,
  do come and sit down at the table. And perhaps I had better introduce myself.
  I am a distant relative of Professor John Bevill's, and, as you see, a
  nurse&mdash;Nurse Coterell to be exact. You see, I have been taking a holiday
  for some time, and as the Professor wants a good deal of looking after I came
  down here to stay with him. He is by no means strong, and working all night,
  as he frequently does, is rather too much for him. Now, come along, and let
  me give you a little of this cold chicken and a glass of port. If I were to
  prescribe for you, I should say that this moment a glass of port is the very
  thing you want. Come along."</p>

  <p>There was a trace of tears in Sylvia's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are more than kind," she said. "Let me tell you my name. I am Sylvia
  Dorn."</p>

  <p>Nurse Coterell looked up swiftly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; PROFESSOR JOHN BEVILL.</h2>

  <p class="first">Just for a moment it seemed to Sylvia that there was something like a
  challenge in her companion's eye, and, if not, that it was quite plain that
  the name of Dorn conveyed something to the intelligence of Nurse
  Coterell.</p>

  <p>"You have heard of me before?" Sylvia asked.</p>

  <p>"I have heard your name," the other said guardedly. "Do you happen, by any
  chance, to be related to Major Dorn, of Lanton Place, near Tavistock?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is my father," Sylvia said.</p>

  <p>Again that strange look came into Nurse Coterell's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," she said. "That is interesting."</p>

  <p>"I met him once," Nurse Coterell said in the same guarded tone. "But it is
  a great many years ago, and I don't suppose he would remember it. And so you
  are his daughter. I wonder why it is that I seem to have seen you before.
  Your face is quite familiar to me, and yet I could not be any more definite
  than that. You probably bear a resemblance to some chance acquaintance of
  mine. You know how we often think we have met people before, when there is no
  foundation for any belief of the kind. And yet your features fairly haunt
  me."</p>

  <p>Sylvia laid down her knife and fork and played for a moment or two
  nervously with the stem of her wine glass. She had a deep instinctive feeling
  that she had found a friend here&mdash;indeed, after what had happened, how
  could she possibly doubt it? As she looked in that kindly face on the other
  side of the table the impulse to confide her troubles in Nurse Coterell grew
  more stronger, the idea of deceiving her became hateful. And deep down in her
  heart, too, she knew the reason why her features conveyed so much to her
  companion. Evidently this kind-hearted creature was in the confidence of
  Professor John Bevill, and beyond doubt she had read that artfully
  heart-breaking, begging letter and, no doubt, had become familiar with the
  photograph that had accompanied it. A moment or two later&mdash;and Sylvia
  had made up her mind.</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell you the truth, Nurse," she said. "Have a good look at
  me again. Thank you. Now, though you have never met me before, I am sure, it
  is more than probable that you have seen a photograph of mine. Did you happen
  to see a photograph very like me, but in stage dress, and made up for the
  footlights, that was contained in an appeal that reached Mr. Bevill within
  the last day or two?"</p>

  <p>"Why, bless my soul, yes," Nurse Coterell, cried. "My dear child, you have
  solved the mystery. You are the young actress who wants money to go to
  America. Well, if that's a fact and your story is anything like the truth,
  you are certain to get what you want from Mr. Bevill. But I don't understand.
  The letter you speak of came from an address in London, signed by a man who
  called himself your father, but I am quite sure the name was not Dorn."</p>

  <p>Sylvia flushed to the roots of her hair.</p>

  <p>"It seems very difficult," she said, "and very painful to me. But I assure
  you that I am telling you the truth and that I am Sylvia Dorn. And I have
  been on the stage, though I can hardly call myself an actress as yet. You
  see, I have a chance of getting something to do in London, and though I live
  in a castle, and my father is the head of an old family, I had not the
  necessary money to pay my fare to London, and that is why I decided to walk.
  And as to the rest, it is too shameful. Oh, I cannot tell you."</p>

  <p>"I think I understand," Nurse Coterell said kindly enough. "Mr. Bevill has
  all sorts of appeals for money, some of which are genuine, whilst others are
  downright frauds. I expect that someone has been taking your name in vain.
  Someone has got hold of your photograph and used that pretty face of yours as
  a lure to draw money from the pockets of a man who is notoriously simple and
  kind-hearted. Perhaps it is someone you want to shield, someone you are fond
  of. Ah, my dear child, it is usually the way that we women are fond of those
  sort of people, when we care little or nothing for the less showy men who are
  honourable and upright enough. Yes, I see it is something of that kind; I can
  see it by the look in your eyes and the flush on your cheeks. But if it is a
  fraud, as I very strongly suspect, I am perfectly certain that you are no
  party to it."</p>

  <p>"I thank you from my heart for saying that," Sylvia cried. "Indeed,
  indeed, I am no party to it. I knew what was happening, but it was too late
  to interfere. And now that you know the truth, will you help a little
  further? Will you try and induce Mr Bevill not to take
  proceedings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nurse Coterell laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he would never take proceedings," she said. "Why, if the individual
  you speak of, who has been using your photograph to put money in his pockets,
  were to rob John Bevill of the last shilling he had in the world, he would
  only smile and suppose that the thief was driven to it."</p>

  <p>Sylvia found herself breathing a little easier. So far as she was
  concerned, she had told the truth, and, at the same time, contrived to shield
  her father. She would take good care that he did not benefit by that letter,
  and now, that being assured, she could go on with the supper that she so
  badly needed with a more tranquil mind. And yet the whole extraordinary
  coincidence left her a little strange and dizzy.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it an amazing thing," she cried, "that out of all the houses in
  England I should have come here to-night? And yet there are so many people
  who sneer at coincidences. Now, that photograph of mine. I knew it was here,
  because when I came into the house and looked round for some clue as to the
  identity of the inhabitants, I found that envelope lying on the table there
  in my own handwriting. I was tricked into writing that letter. But it is an
  amazing thing altogether."</p>

  <p>"The most amazing thing I ever heard," Nurse Coterell cried. "But, very
  fortunately, that picture of yours fell into the right hands. Mr. Bevill was
  most interested in it. He locked it up in his safe, with the intention of
  seeking out the original and helping her. My dear child, your photograph made
  a vast impression on him. I won't go as far as to say he fell in love with
  it, but it really was something like that. And you will fall in love with him
  when you meet; for everybody does."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you will think I am rather curious," Sylvia said. "But what
  is an old gentleman at his time of life doing out on a night like this?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, more kindness of heart. A farmer in the neighbourhood had met with an
  accident just at a time his wife was ill in bed. So nothing would do but that
  the whole lot of us must go over there at once with all sorts of comforts and
  things till the doctor could make arrangements to have the poor man properly
  looked after. We have been there all the evening. But the car may be back at
  any moment now. There it is."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later and Professor John Bevill himself came bustling into
  the room. He was a tall man with a scholarly stoop of the shoulders and a
  big, amazingly intellectual face in a perfect forest of white hair. He flung
  his wraps on one side and advanced cheerfully to the supper table.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right, Sara," he said. "I left them all happy and
  comfortable with a doctor and two nurses in the house, and, God bless my
  soul, who have you got here? Who is this young lady who has been kind enough
  to bring the sunshine of her presence into my bungalow? And where have I seen
  her before? The lady of the photograph!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better explain," Nurse Coterell said. "It is a most
  romantic story, and quite worthy of a place in a novel. Now listen,
  uncle."</p>

  <p>Very rapidly the speaker went over the events of the last hour or so,
  laying particular stress upon all that Sylvia had said, and with much tact
  and delicacy skating over the things that Sylvia had not said. But the old
  man seemed to understand, for he rose gallantly from his seat and held out
  his hand to his visitor.</p>

  <p>"I think I have got sufficient intelligence to grasp the situation," he
  said. "And I am not going to embarrass you with a lot of awkward questions,
  my dear young lady. If you want to shield somebody who has not scrupled to do
  you harm to put money in his pocket, then that is no business of mine. But
  from what I gather you need a friend badly, and I want to tell you at once
  that you have found that friend in John Bevill. The idea of a delicate little
  creature like you walking to London! I never heard anything more ridiculous
  in my life. No, I don't mean ridiculous, I mean courageous. Now what you are
  going to do is this. You will stay here and conduct those negotiations of
  yours by correspondence. You will stay here as Nurse Coterell's guest and
  mine till everything is settled. No, I don't want to hear another word. Now,
  sit down and get on with your supper which I interrupted so unkindly. Sara, I
  declare I am as hungry as a hunter."</p>

  <p>"But aren't you very wet?" Sylvia asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Bevill replied. "It stopped raining a quarter of an
  hour ago; as a matter of fact, it's brilliant starlight. Here, let's get
  on."</p>

  <p>With which Bevill proceeded to make a hearty meal. He rang the bell
  presently, and the table was cleared by the taciturn servant, who moved about
  as if he were a piece of oiled machinery. Then the fire was made up again and
  the door closed, whilst they sat round the blaze talking as if they had been
  friends for years. It was getting quite late when there came a knock at the
  door, and Garrass came in creeping softly across the floor and whispered
  something in Bevill's ear.</p>

  <p>The Professor jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"At once," he cried. "Get both cars round without the slightest delay. We
  must go back to Baron's Court at once, Sara. I can't tell you exactly what
  has happened, but we must go. And of course this young lady will come with
  us. We can't leave her here alone. Please don't ask any questions. Run away
  and get your wraps on without the slightest delay."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; IN THE MOONLIGHT.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia listened almost placidly to this strange statement of Bevill's.
  After what she had gone through the last hour or two, nothing seemed
  impossible or out of the question. What was going to happen in the next hour
  or two she neither knew nor cared. By sheer good luck, and because these
  people had accepted her statements implicitly, she had averted what a little
  time ago had appeared to her to be a terrible danger. No longer was there any
  chance of her being compelled to face a police inquiry in connection with an
  attempt to obtain money by false pretences. And now she knew that, whatever
  happened, her father would be safe so far as Professor John Bevill was
  concerned.</p>

  <p>Therefore, beyond a certain sense of bewilderment and a feeling of regret
  that, tired as she was, there was no rest for her yet, she was quite prepared
  to be up and doing and take whatever part was assigned to her in connection
  with this remarkable household. She rose to her feet, but with a kindly
  glance Bevill motioned her back to her chair again.</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion for you to trouble, my dear," he said. "My niece
  here will make all necessary arrangements and Garrass will look to the rest.
  I am only too sorry to be compelled to disturb you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't consider me," Sylvia said. "You have been too kind to me
  already. I am not very tired either. And if you like, I should be quite
  prepared to stay here alone. I assure you, I am not in the least afraid."</p>

  <p>Nurse Coterell had already risen to her feet and had bustled out of the
  room, but she came back presently with the information that it was a
  brilliant moonlight night and that the two small cars were already
  outside.</p>

  <p>"Then we had better get along," Bevill said. "You start, Sara, with
  Garrass, and drive straight to the house, and I will bring Miss Dorn along
  with me."</p>

  <p>According to this programme they set off presently along the high road in
  the direction of Tavistock. It was likely to be a long journey, and indeed it
  was, for the moon began to slide down in a blue and tranquil sky and the
  first streaks of the dawn were coming up from the east some time before their
  destination was reached. From time to time Sylvia stole a glance at her
  companion, and though it seemed to her that he was looking just a little
  stern, he still bore his benign expression and kept up a flow of conversation
  on the way. Without appearing to be in the least curious, he contrived to
  learn a good deal about his companion, and seemed to be particularly
  interested in what she had to say about Maxwell Frick and the cinematograph
  company that mercurial individual represented.</p>

  <p>"Now that is exceedingly appealing," he said. "And it gives me an idea.
  Strange that I never thought of it before. I wonder if you would help
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be only too pleased," Sylvia said, "if you will tell in what
  way."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this, Miss Dorn. You see, at Baron's Court I have one of
  the finest private menageries in England. I have all sorts of animals there,
  both wild and domestic&mdash;indeed, I have spent a small fortune on them.
  For this is my hobby. I have been studying wild animals all my life. I have
  spent most of my time abroad, studying them in their native state; and I
  flatter myself that my researches have not been altogether in vain. I have
  spent nearly three years practically alone amongst the monkeys. With the
  exception of Professor Garnier, I know more of those creatures than any
  living man."</p>

  <p>"And you want me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so," Bevill interrupted eagerly. "I want you to arrange if
  you can for these friends of yours to make photographic studies of my
  animals. There is a splendid opportunity, and it won't cost them anything
  either. Now, do you think Mr. Frick would be agreeable?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite certain he would," Sylvia said. "Especially if he can see his
  way to make a story out of it for the camera. I suppose you see what I mean.
  Didn't you say that you had a wonderful monkey?"</p>

  <p>Bevill broke out enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"The most wonderful in the world," he said. "Vim is practically human. I
  suppose you have heard of those two famous apes called Max and Moritz?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," Sylvia said. "I saw them some years ago when I was a child. They
  were wonderful."</p>

  <p>"I don't think they are any more wonderful than Vim," Bevill said. "He can
  do anything but speak, and I believe, if I had the time, I could learn his
  peculiar language. I used to hope that I could teach him ours, but that was a
  dream. But he can do anything. He has his own bedroom and his own bath and
  looks after his own wardrobe. He eats and drinks practically the same as we
  do, and sits up to the table and appears to join in the conversation. At any
  rate, anything that amuses us always amuses him. He has his likes and
  dislikes just like human beings, and also has occasional outbursts of temper.
  And then, I must confess, he wants looking after."</p>

  <p>"Is he dangerous?" Sylvia asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," Bevill said thoughtfully, "I have never seen him actually
  dangerous, and only on the verge of it once or twice. But I am afraid that if
  any foolish person played a practical joke on him he might get out of
  control. And he is as powerful as any three men. But I don't think we need
  worry about that. No sensible person would ever attempt such a thing. Now, it
  occurred to me that if some of Mr. Frick's literary friends like to write a
  story or two round my animals, especially Vim, they might be able to do a
  good deal with it."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Bevill lapsed into silence and drove a considerable distance
  before he spoke again. And Sylvia, sitting there, turning the events of the
  evening over in her mind, was equally silent. She was trying to picture to
  herself what sort of a household Baron's Court was, and what sort of a man he
  was who dragged people across country at this hour in the morning for what
  was apparently no better than a caprice. And when Sylvia was still debating
  this point the car pulled up in front of two massive iron gates, flanked on
  either side by long stone walls surmounted with three strands of barbed wire.
  In the moonlight behind the gates Sylvia could see a small lodge nestling
  amongst the trees. The whole thing was so familiar and yet so strange and
  visionary that she found herself rubbing her eyes and wondering if she were
  not reconstructing some half remembered dream.</p>

  <p>And then it came to her with a flash. Of course, she had been to Baron's
  Court before. And this was Baron's Court, where she had come in a despairing
  attempt to see its owner and from whence she had been turned away civilly
  enough but quite firmly by the apple-cheeked lodge-keeper who had refused
  politely to let her pass through the gates. It was the same scene right
  enough, though, in the waning moonlight and in the early dawn, it looked just
  a little different.</p>

  <p>From away in the distance somewhere, apparently at the back of the wide
  spreading park, came a plaintive cry or two, and then a deeper note that
  seemed to proceed from some angry animal. Then, too, there was a snarling cry
  that ended in a chatter of rage, and Bevill seemed to grow rigid.</p>

  <p>"It's Vim," he said. "Now, what is the matter with him, and why is he
  roaming about the park at this time in the morning? He ought to be in his
  bed."</p>

  <p>As Bevill spoke he leapt from the car and proceeded to hammer upon the
  gates. He rattled the bars again and again, but no response came from the
  people in the lodge.</p>

  <p>"That's a very funny thing," he said. "What on earth's the matter with the
  woman? She's such a light sleeper as a rule. And besides, she knows that I'm
  accustomed to coming in at all hours of the day and night. You see, Miss
  Dorn, I have to make a strict rule that these gates are never left open.
  There are occasions when some of my wild animals get loose, and if one of
  them happens to enter the road I should find myself in no end of trouble with
  the authorities. What's become of the other car? They ought to have been here
  twenty minutes ago. They must have passed through the gates. I am beginning
  to think there is something wrong here."</p>

  <p>"Is that why you came?" Sylvia asked.</p>

  <p>Bevill did not appear to hear the question. He was rattling the bars again
  now, and displaying an irritation and anxiety that was beginning to get on
  Sylvia's nerves. Then, with an agility that would have done credit to a
  younger man, he climbed perilously over the high gate and dropped on the
  inside. Then he proceeded to hammer on the door of the lodge, until it was
  opened presently by a woman with her head in a shawl who looked out stupidly
  with her mouth open.</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of all this?" Bevill demanded.</p>

  <p>"Eh, what's that?" the woman asked.</p>

  <p>Bevill placed his hands upon the woman's shoulders and fairly dragged her
  into the open. Her eyes were half-closed, her lips were parted, and her face
  was pale and drawn. Then gradually she seemed to come to herself, as an
  intoxicated person might do in the fresh air, and she gazed at her master
  with dawning intelligence in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, sir," she stammered. "But I don't know what's the matter
  with me to-night. I was all right when I went to bed, and now I feel fairly
  dazed. Just as if somebody had been drugging me. My head is ready to
  split."</p>

  <p>Bevill asked no further questions. He procured the key of the gate and
  brought the car inside. He was looking stern enough now as he shut off the
  engine and handed Sylvia out of the car.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll walk the rest of the way," he said curtly. "Mrs. Leach, you
  go back to bed. I'll see to all this to-morrow. Come alone, my dear."</p>

  <p>In absolute silence Sylvia walked by the side of her companion along the
  thick avenue, under the shadows of which it was intensely dark, till they
  came in sight of the house. Then suddenly Bevill pulled up and dragged Sylvia
  backwards into the shelter of a patch of laurels.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE SCARECROW.</h2>

  <p class="first">The assault was so unexpected that Sylvia could only wonder if Bevill had
  been suddenly afflicted with a phase of madness into which she seemed to have
  been plunged during the last few hours. She could see nothing except a little
  patch of moonlight on the far side of the avenue, could hear nothing but the
  hard breathing of her companion, and presently catch his whispered words to
  the effect that she must be quite silent and all would be well. That there
  was some great danger close at hand she realised. Perhaps some wild animal
  had escaped and was even at that moment stalking them through the bushes.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly that strange chattering sound broke out, a chatter that was
  more than half-snarling rage, and a queer figure, like some misshapen human
  being, darted out from the shadow of one of the big trees and went headlong
  to the ground. The strange monstrosity rose again, and then Sylvia's amazed
  eyes made out the outline of a huge ape that seemed, so far as she could see,
  to be fastened by a long chain to the base of one of the big trees in the
  avenue.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Sylvia whispered. "What is it!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be more frightened than you can help," Bevill murmured. "It's Vim.
  And, by Heavens, someone has played a trick upon him. I didn't think it
  possible that anybody could be so foolish. You remember what I told you just
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember," Sylvia shuddered. "How cruel!"</p>

  <p>"Worse than that," Bevill said angrily. "I don't know who is responsible
  for this outrage, but his life would not he worth a moment's purchase if Vim
  were free at this moment. Unless, perhaps, he is caught in a trap. On the
  whole, it is rather a good thing I came home this evening. There is something
  going on here that I cannot fathom. Someone has taken advantage of me. Well,
  anybody can do that up to a certain point. You stay here, my dear."</p>

  <p>Bevill advanced into the open, followed a yard or two behind by Sylvia,
  who, despite the terror she was feeling, could not remain under the cover of
  the trees. She saw Bevill go forward quite cautiously and heard him call the
  monkey by name. The big chimpanzee stood up to his full height and beat his
  paws on his breast in a frenzy of passion. Then he sprang forward, and but
  for the chain about his foot, would have undoubtedly attacked the person that
  in ordinary conditions he loved best in the world. Bevill had only just time
  to spring back and save himself from the infuriated beast that struggled so
  hard to get at him.</p>

  <p>And in this way the best part of half an hour passed, until gradually and
  by slow degrees, keeping just at a safe distance, Bevill managed to pacify
  the maddened ape, until at length it was safe enough to stroke him as he was
  now lying whining and imploring at his master's feet. He had been fastened
  there by a long chain, the end of which had been wound twice round the base
  of the tree, so that another few minutes elapsed before the animal was free.
  He was placid and quiet enough now, whining and fawning on his beloved master
  and evidently grateful for his release. Where he had tugged at his chain, one
  of his feet was cut and bleeding; there was not a vestige of clothing upon
  him, and for the time being at least, he had lapsed into his primitive state.
  Sylvia watched it all with a strange mixture of pity and loathing in her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"He's all right now, my dear," Bevill said. "But if I had gone too near
  him when he was mad with fear and anger, most assuredly he would have torn me
  in pieces. And he can do it, too. There's not a man in the world who would
  have a chance in an encounter with Vim. What I can't understand is how he
  ever allowed anybody to fasten that snap lock round his foot. But somebody is
  going to account for it. Vim!"</p>

  <p>The big animal came fawningly to his master's feet and looked into his
  face with an expression that was almost human.</p>

  <p>"Vim," he repeated. "Come here and shake hands with the lady. She is a
  great friend of mine, and I want you to know her. Shake hands, my dear; don't
  be afraid. Don't show any fear of him, and he will respect you all the more.
  If you display any signs of that sort he will think you despise him."</p>

  <p>Greatly daring, or so it seemed to her, Sylvia held out her hand, which
  Vim took respectfully enough and then proceeded to make her a courtly bow.
  After that he skipped on ahead as if he had quite forgotten his recent
  troubles. Bevill turned to follow when a cry from Sylvia stopped him.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" she said. "Who is that standing there, just out in the
  moonlight? Can't you see a man there?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly looks like one," Bevill said.</p>

  <p>As he spoke he stepped across the open patch of moonlight in the direction
  of the figure. Sylvia following close behind. For a minute or two they
  regarded that rigid outline with a certain puzzled astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Why, it isn't a man at all," Sylvia said. "It's a dummy, a
  scarecrow."</p>

  <p>"So it is," Bevill cried. "Are we both mad, or dreaming, or what? What
  does it mean? Yes, a stuffed figure wearing an old suit of clothes of mine. I
  recognise that old Norfolk jacket. It's the one I always wear when I go into
  the pumas' cage. You see, animals go a good deal by sense of smell, and when
  I am wearing that coat I can do anything with my pumas. And I should like to
  know what all this means. But come along, my dear, I am very sorry. You must
  be utterly worn out with all this excitement, to say nothing of the fact that
  you were walking the whole of yesterday. I hope by this time the others have
  turned up. Let's get back to the house."</p>

  <p>It was practically daylight by this time, just on four o'clock in the
  morning, and the sun was rising behind the avenue. Outside the main portico
  of the great house the other car was standing, and in the hall Nurse Coterell
  was anxiously waiting the advent of Bevill and Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are at last," she said. "I was wondering what had become of
  you. I was afraid you had had a breakdown."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we've been here the best part of an hour," Bevill said. "We found an
  extraordinary thing in the park, which I will tell you all about after we
  have had a few hours' rest. Vim here has met with an adventure."</p>

  <p>Vim chattered as if making an attempt to join in the conversation with the
  rest.</p>

  <p>"Here, don't you interfere, Vim," Bevill said. "You go off to your
  bedroom. Off you go."</p>

  <p>The big animal grinned, but trotted off obediently and then was seen no
  more.</p>

  <p>"But where have you been?" Bevill asked. "When we reached the lodge gates
  you had certainly not been through. I had the greatest difficulty in waking
  Mrs. Leach up, and when I did, she had every appearance of a person who has
  been intoxicated for a month. I should very much like to know what is going
  on here. Something very strange, I am sure. Do you happen to know who is
  staying in the house?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the least idea," Nurse Coterell said. "Probably a few of Mr. de
  Barsac's friends. He generally does as he likes here in your absence. I'm not
  usually ill-natured, uncle, but if Baron's Court belonged to me Victor de
  Barsac would never be inside it. I don't like that man; I don't like the way
  he looks at you; I don't like the expression of his eyes. Oh, I know he's a
  great man, and perhaps the finest sculptor in the world, but I distrust
  him."</p>

  <p>"Ah, a case of Dr. Fell, I suppose," Bevill said. "Well, there's no
  accounting for a woman's prejudices. But you haven't answered my question.
  You ought to have been here first, whereas we were a long time in front of
  you."</p>

  <p>"Well, we took the wrong turning," Nurse Coterell said, "and went out of
  our way for some miles. Luckily, I have the front door latch-key in my
  pocket, and that's how we got in. I don't suppose any of the servants will be
  down for the next couple of hours, and I don't see any reason why we should
  disturb them. You go to your room, uncle, and get an hour or two's sleep. I
  will look after Miss Dorn. I have taken all her things into the dressing-room
  behind my bedroom, and will make her comfortable there. Now, come along."</p>

  <p>Sylvia was thankful enough, a few minutes later, to find herself in a
  spacious dressing-room, where she flung herself on the bed just as she was
  with every intention of sleeping for hours to come. It was broad daylight
  now, and through the open windows she could hear the singing of the birds and
  the call of lambs in distant pastures. And presently, as she tossed about
  there, she began to realise that it would be a long time before sleep visited
  her eyelids, though she closed her eyes and turned her face resolutely from
  the light.</p>

  <p>But it was all in vain; the strangeness of her surroundings, the recent
  adventure, and the amazing happenings of the night before chased one another
  through her restless brain, till at length she rose from her bed and wandered
  out in the corridor in search of a bathroom. This she found presently and,
  refreshed with a plunge into cold water, went back to her room, where she
  dressed herself as carefully as she could, and then creeping down the stairs
  opened the front door and passed on to the wide terrace that overlooked the
  park.</p>

  <p>She did not dare to go too far with the memory of last night before her,
  but stood in a secluded corner of the terrace behind a thicket of flowering
  shrubs in pots, looking out across the landscape, where presently she saw two
  figures coming, as she thought, cautiously in the direction of the house.
  Then, as the figures passed her and disappeared under the big porch, she
  rubbed her eyes with amazement, not altogether free from fear.</p>

  <p>One man she did not recognise; the other, beyond the shadow of a doubt,
  was her own father. She stood there holding her hand to her head for a few
  minutes, trying to grasp what all this meant, then she started as the echo of
  footsteps came in her direction along the terrace. A moment later she was
  looking into the surprised eyes of a young man.</p>

  <p>"Lionel&mdash;Mr. Markham," she stammered.</p>

  <p>"Why, Sylvia, Sylvia Dorn," Lionel Markham cried. "What amazing good
  fortune has brought you here?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; ON THE TERRACE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia smiled faintly enough, for just at that moment it seemed to her as
  if nothing mattered, and nothing in the world could be of the least
  importance. She was too dazed to stop and analyse her own feelings, too
  utterly indifferent to mind or to wonder at the extraordinary combination of
  circumstances that had brought her face to face with Lionel Markham.</p>

  <p>"How do you do?" she said feebly enough.</p>

  <p>Then the stupid banality of the remark appealed to her sense of humour,
  and she laughed unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't think of anything else to say," she went on. "Really, Mr.
  Markham, I am so utterly bewildered that I don't know what to say. And here
  we are, standing face to face at this hour in the morning as if it were the
  most natural thing in the world."</p>

  <p>"Well, so it is," Markham smiled. "I knew perfectly well that I should
  meet you again, and I have been looking forward to doing so, though you did
  treat me badly."</p>

  <p>"Badly? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, didn't you? For some little time up north you and I were the best
  of friends. Then you suddenly vanished without saying good-bye. Don't you
  call that treating me badly?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think perhaps I had better confess," Sylvia smiled. "I had to go.
  We all had to go, for the matter of that. The theatrical tour was an utter
  failure. We were badly treated as well. So I went back home, I managed that
  somehow, and I suppose all the rest of us scattered."</p>

  <p>"I think I understand," Markham said. "And since then you have been doing
  nothing, I suppose. Well, it doesn't matter now. We have come together again,
  and this time I'm not going to lose sight of you, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>He looked down into her face with an expression in his eyes that she knew
  and remembered so well, and a little flush rose to her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better explain," she said.</p>

  <p>And there and then, slowly and hesitatingly, but firmly enough, she told
  him everything. There was nothing that she disguised from him, not even the
  shameful story of that begging letter. It was not a pleasant confession, and
  one that she told with burning cheeks and downcast eyes, but it was finished
  at length, and in a strange, inconsequent way Sylvia felt all the happier for
  it. For she knew perfectly well that in Lionel Markham she had something more
  than a friend. And she had a feeling, too, that the time was coming when she
  would need a friend sorely enough. By great good fortune she had made one
  already in the shape of John Bevill, but then he was old and confiding, and
  lacking in knowledge of the world.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you how sorry I am," Markham said gravely. "You poor
  unhappy girl!"</p>

  <p>"Please don't speak to me like that," Sylvia said. "Please don't pity me
  or I shall break down altogether. I feel that I have had more than I can
  stand. But you'll help me, won't you? You won't think any worse of me for
  what I have said?"</p>

  <p>"I will help you to the end of the world," Markham cried. "Sylvia, I want
  you to believe that there is nothing I would not do for you. And yet I don't
  see exactly what I can do. I have little or no money."</p>

  <p>"As if that mattered," Sylvia said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I think you'll find it matters a great deal. Now listen to me.
  There is something very wrong going on here, something criminal and underhand
  which spells danger to somebody, though as yet it is difficult to say who.
  Your father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Markham hesitated. It seemed difficult enough to speak his mind to Dorn's
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Sylvia said. "Don't let us have any misunderstanding. You
  hesitate because you are afraid of hurting my feelings. You are afraid of
  saying too much about a man to his own daughter. There is no occasion for all
  this delicacy; I know my father. He is capable of any wickedness. It hurts me
  to say so, but we shall gain nothing by hiding the truth."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of that," Markham said. "And you know it. I must have been a
  poor hand at expressing my feelings if I did not show you when we were
  together that time I cared for you. Ah, Sylvia, that is a feeble way of
  expressing it. And though we have been parted all this time my feelings have
  undergone no change. I love you, Sylvia; I shall love you now and
  always."</p>

  <p>As Markham spoke, Sylvia looked up in his face with an expression in her
  eyes that he could not misunderstand. He could not comprehend her feelings of
  admiration and gratitude, the blessed sense of having found a loving friend
  to protect her in the crisis of her life. Quite simply she put her hand into
  his, and he bent and kissed her once quietly and tenderly upon the lips.</p>

  <p>"There," he said as he released her. "Now we understand one another.
  Whatever happens, Sylvia, it will be you and I together to the end now. We
  are going to the bottom of this trouble and save your father if we can. And I
  should like to do something for that unfortunate mother of yours too. We
  shall see. And meanwhile, perhaps it will be just as well if this
  understanding of ours remains a secret between us."</p>

  <p>"I was going to suggest the same thing," Sylvia said. "Because I think I
  shall be able to help you. Oh, I am not afraid; honestly I think I have as
  much pluck as most girls. And despite everything that has happened, I am
  proud to think that I am a Dorn."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure about your courage," Markham said. "Who could doubt the
  pluck of a girl who starts to walk half across England in search of work? And
  now let me tell you the other side of the story. Let me tell you why I am
  here, and what is taking place in this amazing household. Now, listen
  carefully, and don't interrupt, because time is getting on and we may be
  disturbed at any moment."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Markham told his story as briefly as possible; while Sylvia
  listened with all her ears.</p>

  <p>"What are you afraid of?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, frankly, I don't know," Markham said. "But I mistrust that man de
  Barsac, though I believe Mr. Bevill thinks highly of him, and I don't
  understand why your father is here. I feel sure he is up to no good."</p>

  <p>"I am sure he is," Sylvia replied. "It is a shameful thing to say, but
  wherever my father is, he is up to no good. I am very much afraid that he and
  this de Barsac have some business on hand which will certainly not be to Mr.
  Bevill's advantage."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised if it is rather worse than that," Markham said.
  "If it were merely a case of conspiracy to rob that confiding old gentleman,
  I should not so much mind. But there are darker forces at work here. Take the
  case that you told me just now about that extraordinary animal Vim. Who was
  it that chained the ape to the tree? and who was it that dressed up a
  scarecrow in what I call Mr. Bevill's working clothes? I tell you I don't
  like it, Sylvia, I don't like it a bit. I must think it all out quietly. I
  wonder if that extraordinary individual Garrass can help me."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Sylvia said. "Is he really devoted to his master? He is so
  quiet and taciturn that he almost frightens me. Can you trust him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have no doubts on that score," Markham said. "I don't know what
  strong bond there is between those two, but I am quite sure that Garrass
  would take his life in his hand any day to help John Bevill. Bevill is the
  one subject in the world on which he speaks eloquently. But we can put that
  out of our minds for the moment. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"What am I going to do?" Sylvia echoed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, what are you going to do? You can't very well stay here. Unless I am
  greatly mistaken, there is going to be stern work at Baron's Court, and I
  wish to heaven I could see in which direction. Now, I think the best thing to
  do is to go home, go home and wait till you hear from that eccentric
  individual Maxwell Frick again. He will probably come down here within a day
  or two about that cinematograph business of his, and then you will be able to
  come here in the ordinary way without anybody asking questions. Wouldn't it
  be just as well if you got away home before your father knew that you were in
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"But isn't it too late?" Sylvia asked. "Remember, Mr. Bevill knows who I
  am, and so does his niece. My name is bound to be mentioned. I must see my
  father, and let him know that though I have told about the letter he will be
  safe; indeed, so far as he is concerned, I have not told the whole truth. Mr.
  Bevill may guess, but I have not told him that it was my father who dictated
  that shameful letter. And I want to let him know that I have done my best not
  to expose him."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Markham said. "Perhaps you are right. And now I think I had
  better leave you."</p>

  <p>He turned away a moment or two later and left Sylvia to her distracted
  thoughts. She sat there for some time, looking out across the park and
  thinking over the strange events of the night before, until the breakfast
  bell rang, then turned in the direction of the house. As she crossed the hall
  in the direction of the dining-room, she came face to face with Major Dorn.
  He gave her one quick glance of astonishment, and something that seemed to
  Sylvia very like fear, before he spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded. "What is the meaning of this? I
  suppose you know whose house you are in? If you have come here to betray
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have done nothing of the kind," Sylvia replied coldly. "I am not going
  to explain, but so far as Mr. Bevill is concerned you are safe. If he
  guesses, he will do nothing. But you will not get that money, whatever
  happens. Mr. Bevill will give you nothing. And I am not going to interfere
  with you. I am going back to my mother presently, and you can go your own
  way. You are safe for the present; but if you'll only take my advice, which
  of course you won't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll have this out presently," Dorn threatened.</p>

  <p>"We shall do nothing of the kind," Sylvia cried. "And don't forget that I
  have warned you."</p>

  <p>She turned on her heel and left him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; ROGUES IN COUNCIL.</h2>

  <p class="first">Dorn lay luxuriously back in a big arm-chair in the room where de Barsac
  had set up his studio, and smoked his cigar with the air of a connoisseur. He
  had lunched well, a little comforted by the knowledge that Sylvia was no
  longer under the same roof as himself, but there was just the shade of
  anxiety on his face and a moody gleam in his eyes. De Barsac sat opposite
  him, with a cigarette between his lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you make of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll be hanging if I know," Dorn said irritably, "I don't like it a bit.
  So far the whole scheme has been an absolute failure. It's too dangerous
  altogether. Now, who would have expected that that confiding old idiot Bevill
  would have turned up in the middle of the night and just at the moment when
  we particularly didn't want him? Look at the fuss he made about that
  confounded ape of his. Just for all the world as if there was any harm in
  what you did. How on earth can you get your studies of animals in their
  savage state unless you make experiments? And I don't like the way in which
  that conceited young ass Markham asks questions. We shall have to be careful,
  my friend. You are too sanguine. You take too much for granted, your point of
  view is the only one in the world, and you are too fond of thinking everybody
  is a fool except yourself. The scheme is good enough if you give it time. But
  if you rush it as you are doing, it'll all end in disaster. And what sort of
  a disaster I don't need to put into words."</p>

  <p>De Barsac flicked his ash off carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," he said. "Bevill is as innocent as a child. And,
  besides, Gibson and that conceited secretary of his will be gone in a day or
  two. And once they are out of the way we shall be able to work things as we
  like. It is a devilish odd thing that they should have picked up your
  daughter in the way they did. I had no idea she knew them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was a mere accident," Dorn explained. "She is a headstrong,
  impulsive sort of girl who must not be spoken to, and she&mdash;well, she ran
  away from home. Actually started to walk to London. Got caught in a storm by
  the way, and by the blindest chance hit upon the old man's bungalow. It night
  have been a serious matter, but as things have turned out, it doesn't matter
  except that her stupidity cost me a good many sovereigns that I can ill
  afford to lose."</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you've been trying some little game of your own," de Barsac
  grinned. "All right, I'm not going to ask any awkward questions. The young
  lady has gone now, and we needn't trouble about her any longer. What we have
  to do now is to get Sir Watney Gibson and his secretary out of the way, and
  once the house is quiet we can manage all right."</p>

  <p>"There you go again," Dorn exclaimed. "Didn't you hear all that talk at
  lunch-time about a cinematograph company coming down here? If the old man
  persists in this new hobby of his, we shall have those infernal actors
  swarming all over the place for weeks. I tell you, there is no time to be
  lost."</p>

  <p>"You are about right there," de Barsac said grimly. "There certainly is no
  time to be lost. I must have a big sum of money by the end of this week. That
  scoundrel Henderby Lupas is putting the screw upon me. I can't put him off
  any longer. As you have met him before, you know the class of man I have got
  to deal with. As a matter of fact he is coming this afternoon, and may be
  here at any moment. I had a letter from him this morning with the Exeter
  postmark, so I suppose he's got another victim in the neighbourhood. I have
  told them to send him here directly he comes, I think I'll get him to stay a
  day or two if it is only to prove to him what a firm hold I have on the old
  man, and perhaps when he sees that he will be disposed to give me a little
  more time. If he doesn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Barsac shrugged his shoulders and lapsed into silence. For the next
  hour or so the two men smoked moodily without the interchange of a further
  remark, until someone rapped on the door of the studio and a thin, tall,
  wizened man with a face like parchment came twisting into the room and nodded
  curtly to de Barsac before he took a seat. Then he stretched out his hand
  coolly and helped himself to a cigar, after which he turned to Dorn and
  favoured him with a long stare.</p>

  <p>"Ah, another old friend," he said in a voice that was low and husky and
  penetrating as the sound of a saw. "Major Dorn, unless I am greatly mistaken.
  Ah, Major, it is a long time since you and I did business together."</p>

  <p>"Not too long for me, you old rascal," Dorn said. "What ill wind blows you
  here?"</p>

  <p>With the end of his cigar Lupas pointed to de Barsac, who was eyeing him
  with no friendly gaze.</p>

  <p>"Our friend the famous sculptor," he laughed. "The greatest man of his
  kind in the world. The friend of princes, the darling of all the ladies in
  England's fashionable drawing-rooms. The man who makes the income of a king,
  and spends it twice over. The man who ought to be rich, but is really poorer
  than the meanest city clerk; because not only is he up to his eyes in debt,
  but he has done that which the law calls wrong. And I can say this because
  Major Dorn is his friend, and because Major Dorn is not immaculate
  himself."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Dorn asked threateningly.</p>

  <p>Lupas looked at the speaker out of a pair of eyes that gleamed malignant
  as those of a snake.</p>

  <p>"Now, don't you try and bully me, my gallant warrior," he said. "I know,
  and if I liked, I could lay you by the heels too. There are few successful
  scoundrels in England whose history is not known to me. And when I am in the
  presence of the head of the begging letter fraternity, why, I take off my hat
  to him. But no nonsense, please."</p>

  <p>"Here, don't let's quarrel," de Barsac said, as Dorn collapsed
  uncomfortably in his seat. "There's no occasion for any wrangling. Lupas, you
  want money?"</p>

  <p>"I do," Lupas snapped. "And what's more, I am going to have it. Ten
  thousand this week, my boy."</p>

  <p>"Oh that's all nonsense," de Barsac expostulated. "Now how much do I owe
  you altogether?"</p>

  <p>"Say five times the amount."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that all? I thought it was more."</p>

  <p>"It's more than you can pay," Lupas retorted.</p>

  <p>"This week, yes. Next week, no. I'm not going into details, Lupas, but you
  shall have your money within a fortnight."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you have been telling me that once a week for the last year," Lupas
  sneered. "Now, I'm not unreasonable. Show me a fair chance of getting my own
  back, and I am quite prepared to wait. In the circumstances, I can afford
  to."</p>

  <p>"I should think you could," de Barsac cried. "Now, it's like this. You can
  see the sort of place I'm living in. I'm not going to say it's my own,
  because it isn't. But it will be, Lupas, it will be."</p>

  <p>"Ump!" Lupas said. "I'd like to have proof of that. Of course I know that
  Mr. John Bevill is an immensely rich man, and that you are a great favourite
  of his. But there's many a slip betwixt the cup and the lip, my boy, and I
  don't see why I should wait indefinitely."</p>

  <p>"And suppose you don't wait, what then?" de Barsac drawled. "You can only
  make a bankrupt of me."</p>

  <p>"I can send you to gaol," Lupas hissed. "I can disgrace you in the eyes of
  Society; I can break you like a reed, and I'll do it, too."</p>

  <p>"But not if you get the money."</p>

  <p>"No, not if I get my money. I'm not vindictive; at least, not till I find
  out that a man has swindled me, and then if he can't make good, God help him.
  Revenge is a passion that never appealed to me. But, on the other hand, I
  don't spare a man who has robbed me. Now, come, I'll make you a fair offer. I
  am prepared to stay down here a day or two, and if I ascertain that there is
  anything in what you say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you'll wait," de Barsac interrupted eagerly. "You can stay in the
  house, you can live on the fat of the land&mdash;a thing you are fond of at
  other people's expense&mdash;and you can see for yourself on what terms I am
  with Mr. Bevill. I happen to know that his will is locked up here in his
  safe, and it won't be my fault if you don't get a look at that interesting
  document. Perhaps that will satisfy you."</p>

  <p>"It would certainly go a long way," Lupas admitted. "You must be on very
  good terms with Mr. Bevill if you can invite guests under his roof like
  this."</p>

  <p>"He does just as he likes here," Dorn explained. "Mr. Bevill is only here
  by a sort of accident. He has placed Baron's Court entirely at de Barsac's
  disposal during the summer, and he spends most of his time writing in a
  little bungalow of his. You will be quite satisfied in staying here,
  Lupas."</p>

  <p>"Well that's settled, then," Lupas replied. "And now I would like to have
  a look round and see the place. You may not think it, but I am very fond of
  those old houses. Some of these days I'll have one of my own."</p>

  <p>"Well, go," de Barsac said. "Wander about at your own sweet will. I'll
  come out presently when I have finished the business I have got on with Major
  Dorn."</p>

  <p>Lupas strolled away a minute or two later and sauntered along the terrace
  in the direction of the house. He stood there a minute or two admiring the
  view, till the sound of footsteps attracted his attention, and he turned to
  find himself face to face with Lionel Markham.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Henderby Lupas!" Markham exclaimed. "Will you kindly explain what you
  are doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Is that any business of yours, Mr. Markham?" Lupas retorted. "If you wish
  to know, I am a friend of de Barsac's, and he has asked me to stay here a day
  or two."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, I really don't think so," Markham said icily. "There
  must be limits even to the strange type of animal that comes occasionally to
  Baron's Court. Now, you and I know one another; I had the honour of being in
  your employ once. I didn't have your confidence, of course, but I remained
  long enough to discover the fact that Henderby Lupas is the greatest
  scoundrel in England. In common justice to Mr. Bevill, I cannot allow you to
  stay here; and if you force me, I shall have no hesitation in speaking quite
  freely. Now, you go back to de Barsac and tell him that you are not going to
  stay here."</p>

  <p>With which Markham turned away and left Lupas standing there baffled and
  in a cold fury.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; MARKHAM SPEAKS OUT.</h2>

  <p class="first">With a definite course of action marked out in his mind, Markham strode
  along the terrace in the direction of the studio. There, without any
  particular ceremony, he broke in upon a whispered conversation between Dorn
  and de Barsac, who regarded him with anything but favour.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything I can do for you?" de Barsac asked. "Just at the
  moment, however&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," Markham said. "I am evidently intruding. But, in the
  circumstances, I could do nothing else. That man Lupas is a friend of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that depends what you call a friend," de Barsac drawled insolently.
  "It is an expression that is very much misused. For
  instance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not here to argue any abstruse philosophy of friendship," Markham
  broke in impatiently. "I suppose that when you ask a man to stay under your
  roof, or at any rate under the roof of a house where you yourself are a
  welcome guest, you would not object to the word I use. Therefore, for the
  purpose of what I am saying, Lupas is a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Is that a challenge?" de Barsac asked. "Because, if it is, I am quite
  ready to accept it. For the sake of the argument, Lupas is a friend of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Markham said. "Now, de Barsac, you are a man of the world.
  And, being so, do you usually allow yourself to abuse the hospitality of a
  gentleman?"</p>

  <p>De Barsac rose threateningly to his feet. There was a gleam of anger in
  his eyes as he turned upon Markham. But all this was lost upon the younger
  man, who returned the glance with a cold contempt.</p>

  <p>"You had better sit down again," he said. "You are a fairly powerful man,
  I know, but in that respect I think I have the advantage of you. You are not
  in good training. I am. Now, sit down."</p>

  <p>With a shrug of his shoulders de Barsac dropped back into his seat again.
  For he was beginning to ask himself questions. He was wondering how much this
  young man knew, and therefore he grew a little more conciliatory.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "After all, what is there to quarrel about? But you
  must admit, my dear Markham, that your manner is not ingratiating."</p>

  <p>"Neither was it meant to be," Markham retorted. "I understand that you
  have given this man Lupas an invitation to stay here for a day or two."</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? For the time being, at any rate, Baron's Court is my own
  house. It has been placed at my disposal by Mr. Bevill, who, to all practical
  purposes, is my guest at the present moment, though he is under his own roof.
  And that being so, I have every right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, so long as Mr. Bevill is not here. And again, we have ladies
  present."</p>

  <p>"Are you speaking about my daughter?" Dorn asked. "Because, if so, she has
  either left Baron's Court already, or she will be on her way before very
  long. And really, Mr. Markham, I think that as a father I am the best judge
  of the sort of people my child should associate with."</p>

  <p>"You certainly ought to be," Markham said with emphasis. "But,
  well&mdash;frankly, I rather doubt it. Still, that's not the point. The point
  is that Henderby Lupas is a slimy scoundrel that no honest man would touch
  with a pair of tongs. I know what I am talking about, because for some months
  I had the misfortune to be in his employ. I was long enough with him to learn
  something of his methods, and as soon as I found them out I left him. In the
  City of London there is no greater rascal, and I cannot help feeling, de
  Barsac, that you are aware of it."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am not," de Barsac said. "And that's a very serious statement,
  Markham&mdash;a statement that no man ought to make without definite proof.
  Of course, if you are in a position&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not going into that," Markham said. "If you want me to give you
  documentary evidence, I haven't got any. But I assure you that I know what I
  am talking about; and if you persist in keeping that man here, then I shall
  make it my business to tell Mr. Bevill all that I know about him. Our host is
  a kind-hearted, unsuspicious man, but he can put his foot down upon occasion,
  and I am quite sure that you don't want to quarrel with him especially for
  the sake of a worthless rogue like Lupas. The man's presence is an outrage,
  an insult to all concerned. I might have gone to Mr. Bevill at once, but out
  of consideration of your feelings I have come here to tell you this. You may
  have had dealings with Lupas, very likely you have, but that is no reason why
  he should thrust his hateful personality into a house like this. And with
  that I have about finished. You can't say I haven't warned you."</p>

  <p>With which Markham turned on his heel and left the two other men to their
  reflections. For a minute or two they stared at one another before de Barsac
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Unpleasant, deuced unpleasant," Dorn replied. "And, besides, he means
  it."</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest doubt about that," de Barsac said. "The question is,
  how much does he know?"</p>

  <p>"You have hit the right nail on the head there," Dorn said. "How much does
  he know? For my part, I should say a great deal. He spoke like a man who is
  absolutely sure of his ground. And the first question is, is your friend
  Bevill as big a fool as he looks?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's pretty simple. But he has his likes and dislikes, and he can be
  quite firm on occasion if he wants to. And besides, Lupas is not an engaging
  personality. We shall have to go slow, Dorn."</p>

  <p>"Of course we shall," Dorn replied. "You know all the difficulties of our
  position&mdash;difficulties that may be absolute dangers before long. And
  that being so, we must not allow anything likely to prejudice to reach the
  ears of Bevill. You will have to tell Lupas the truth. You will have to get
  rid of him, however unpleasant the consequences may be. Make it plain to him
  that his presence under this roof is likely to prejudice your interests.
  Besides, he can stay in the neighbourhood if he likes. There are plenty of
  farmhouses about here where they put people up at this time of the year. And
  I don't suppose that young Markham objects to your friendship with Lupas as
  long as he doesn't come here. In other words, if we can get rid of him,
  nothing more will be said. And we do know what a poisonous old rascal he
  is."</p>

  <p>De Barsac debated the point in silence for a few minutes before he rose to
  his feet.</p>

  <p>"It's most infernally awkward," he said. "But, all the same, you are quite
  right. It would be a fatal thing if I did anything now to shake the
  confidence that John Bevill has in me. Besides, there are other reasons."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Dorn said darkly. "There are."</p>

  <p>"Well, come on, let's go and see Lupas and get it over. He won't like it.
  But when he comes to realise that it will be to his own material advantage in
  the long run, I don't think he is likely to object."</p>

  <p>Outside Lupas was pacing up and down the terrace in an angry frame of mind
  which he made no attempt to disguise. He turned almost furiously upon the
  other two.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said. "Are you master in that house, de Barsac, or is that
  insolent young hound who has just ordered me off the premises?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he has tackled you, has he?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a mild way of putting it. He came up to me as if I were some
  tramp and ordered me off. Told me that if I didn't go, he would tell Mr.
  Bevill all about me. And now I want to know who is master here."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am," de Barsac said with rather an uneasy laugh. "You see, Lupas,
  I am in rather an awkward position. I am practically the tenant here for the
  time, but I pay nothing and John Bevill foots all the bills. Usually, he
  gives me a free hand as to who I can ask here, and he would raise no
  objection to you if Markham hadn't been here. But then, unfortunately, he is
  here, and has just informed me rudely enough that if you don't clear off the
  premises he will disclose your disgraceful past to Mr. Bevill. If he does,
  there is certain to be a scene, because Bevill can be quite firm on occasion,
  and he has a niece of his here in the house. Look here, Lupas, don't do
  anything foolish. You've just got to put up with it. If that young man was in
  your employ for some months, as he says he was, he is bound to have picked up
  a good deal of information regarding your methods of business. I hope you
  won't mind this plain speaking, but we are three men of the world together
  here and a large sum of money is at stake. Your money as well as mine,
  remember. Now, what are you going to do? Brazen it out and find yourself
  escorted off the premises at the finish? Stick it and run the chance of
  losing all the money I owe you? You'll never be as foolish as that. For the
  time being, that young man is top dog, and the sooner you realise it the
  better. Take it lying down for the moment."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Lupas said between his teeth and drawing a deep breath as he
  spoke. "My time will come. I'll make this insolent young dog suffer for this,
  or my name is not Henderby Lupas. I am not accustomed to be insulted like
  this."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I will help you," de Barsac said. "That young man must be got
  out of the way. I won't rest satisfied till I have got even with him."</p>

  <p>Dorn shuffled about uneasily, for there was a menace in de Barsac's voice
  that suggested violence. And violence, was a thing that was antagonistic to
  Dorn's nature.</p>

  <p>"So that's settled," he said with forced cheerfulness. "You leave it to
  me, de Barsac. I'll find your friend Lupas some comfortable quarters here
  where we can see him if necessity calls for it. And, by Jove, I should not
  like to stand in young Markham's shoes."</p>

  <p>Lupas smiled at this somewhat vague flattery.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right there," he said. "Oh, I'll get even with him. I'll
  teach that young upstart to interfere with my arrangements. And now, don't
  you think we had better set about to find somewhere I can stay."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; A GLIMMER OF REASON.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sylvia had been back for two days at Lanton Place, waiting to hear
  something from Maxwell Frick. That she would hear from him sooner or later
  she knew perfectly well, especially when he discovered that she had not made
  her way to London. But that mercurial individual had his periods of
  forgetfulness, and it might be some days yet before any sign came from him.
  Therefore she set herself down to wait in patience till the time came when
  she could go out into the world and get her own living once more. Meanwhile
  there was consolation in the knowledge that her father was not at home. She
  knew perfectly well that so long as he had free and luxurious quarters at
  Baron's Court he was not likely to return to the gloom and desolation of
  Lanton Place.</p>

  <p>That he was up to some mischief, or perhaps worse, Sylvia did not doubt
  for a moment. At any rate, her courage and the force of circumstance had
  prevented him from robbing John Bevill, and therefore that was something to
  the good. So Sylvia set herself down to wait and watch and look after her
  mother as best she could. Deep down in her heart was a warm affection for
  that unhappy woman, for Sylvia alone knew how she had suffered at the hands
  of a bad man and how her strange mental condition had been caused by all that
  trouble.</p>

  <p>At the same time it was a heart-breaking and melancholy business. There
  were hours, and even days together, when Mrs. Dorn said nothing even to her
  own daughter. She was grateful for any little kindness; there was a look in
  those dark eyes of hers from time to time like that in the eyes of a dog when
  he receives recognition from his master. And there were times when the
  restless fit came upon her and she wandered out of the house in all sorts of
  weather, eternally prowling amongst the blackened ruins and ever searching
  the ashes. And sometimes it seemed to Sylvia there was worse than
  this&mdash;times when her mother wandered about the dim corridors of the old
  house at all hours of the night; and once Sylvia had gone out into the dawn,
  where she had discovered her mother, like another Cassandra, brooding amongst
  the ruins. And once, again, Sylvia had found a pair of her mother's boots,
  caked in clay and mud as if she had wandered far under the cover of the
  darkness. She must have gone far afield then, for she slept all the next day
  like some worn-out animal. It was always the same, never any change in that
  dark and forbidding household.</p>

  <p>It was the third day that Sylvia had been at home, waiting for some sign
  from Maxwell Frick, and wondering vaguely when she was going to see Lionel
  Markham again. She had written and posted one or two letters, which she had
  posted down in the village, and was making her way back through the tangled
  growth of shrubbery towards the house, when she saw the form of her mother
  over there in the ruins with the eternal rake in her hand. She crossed over
  and spoke gently to Mrs. Dorn.</p>

  <p>"Come into the house, mother," she said. "Do you know that you have been
  there for hours? Come and let me make you a cup of tea. Would you like me to
  play something to you?"</p>

  <p>The unhappy woman raised her eyes to Sylvia's for a moment, and then she
  went on with her work again as if she had not heard, which was probably the
  case. With a sigh, Sylvia repeated her question. And then, as she turned to
  go back to the house, she recognised Markham coming in her direction.</p>

  <p>"I said I should come over and see you," he said. "Are you glad, Sylvia,
  or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, as he turned and saw Mrs. Dorn standing there, a
  drab and patient figure in the midst of all that blackness and desolation. He
  had been prepared by Sylvia for something in the way of a tragedy. But he had
  not pictured anything as heart-breaking and pathetic as this.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he murmured, "I did not know that&mdash;I thought you
  were alone."</p>

  <p>"To all practical purposes I am," Sylvia said with an unsettled little
  smile. "Isn't it sad, Lionel?"</p>

  <p>Markham could only shake his head and glance uneasily at the dusky figure
  grubbing in the ruins.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she won't hear you," Sylvia said. "When she is doing this she can
  never hear anything."</p>

  <p>"But why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh I don't know," Sylvia said. "This sort of thing has been going on for
  years, ever since the fatal night of the fire when the house was burnt down,
  and my unhappy mother lost her reason. She is looking for something, though
  nobody knows what&mdash;indeed, I doubt if she knows herself. But
  occasionally she talks to herself, and then one hears little bits about
  jewels and valuable things that are missing. I fancy that she is doing all
  this for my sake. She has delusions that she has lost something which she was
  saving up for me&mdash;something that she concealed from my father, who would
  certainly have taken it had it been discovered."</p>

  <p>"Can't you rouse her?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Very seldom. But I can try. Mother, here is a visitor who has come to see
  you. Mr. Lionel Markham."</p>

  <p>Very slowly and as if the words had come to her from afar off, Mrs. Dorn
  stood upright and gazed with a peculiar intentness of expression into the
  young man's face.</p>

  <p>"I knew your father," she said.</p>

  <p>Sylvia started back in surprise. For the words were sane and commonplace
  enough, the first coherent words that she had heard her mother utter for many
  years. Then, as if she were engaged in some ordinary occupation, Mrs. Dorn
  went back to her work again, leaving the other two embarrassed and amazed.
  She rose again presently and spoke once more.</p>

  <p>"Your father was a friend of ours," she said. "He was a banker; wasn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Markham stammered. "He was."</p>

  <p>"And one of the best and kindest of men," Mrs. Dorn went on. "Ah, if he
  had been alive now there would never have been all this trouble. But he died
  suddenly. Let me try and remember. He was found dead in his own park, shot
  through the head, and they called it suicide."</p>

  <p>"I always doubted it," Markham said.</p>

  <p>"He was murdered&mdash;murdered, I tell you," Mrs. Dorn said in a voice
  that was little more than a whisper. "I can't tell you how, and I don't
  suppose anybody will ever know, but he was murdered. Strange, very strange
  after all these years that his son should come here making love to my
  daughter."</p>

  <p>Markham fairly staggered back, and Sylvia cried out in surprise. The whole
  thing was true, but then, how did this unhappy woman with her clouded
  intellect go straight into the centre of the truth? And she spoke, too, as if
  it were the most natural thing in the world, spoke without looking at the
  others and going on restlessly with that never-ending search of hers at the
  same time.</p>

  <p>And then she spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Ah, they think I know nothing," she said, as if speaking to herself.
  "They think I am blind and deaf. But I know, I know. You come from Baron's
  Court, don't you?"</p>

  <p>The astonished Markham gasped a reply.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought so. My husband is over there. And another man called de
  Barsac. Beware of him, Lionel Markham, beware of him. He is a bad man, an
  utterly bad man. I knew him years ago. How many years ago was it? It seems to
  me to be hundreds. I was young and handsome then, and I had all the world at
  my feet. And because my head was turned, and they flattered me, I married
  Major Dorn. Ah, a bad day's work, a bad and bitter day's work."</p>

  <p>She broke off abruptly and went back to her work again. And from that
  moment she did not speak again. It was as if she had grown deaf and blind
  again to the world.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is hopeless," Sylvia whispered. "She will go on like this
  till she is tired out. And really, it is a kindness not to worry her. Come in
  the house and let me give you a cup of tea."</p>

  <p>In a bewildered and puzzled silence, and with a heart aching in sympathy
  for these two unfortunates, Markham followed Sylvia along the weed-grown
  track that led to the house.</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinary desolate here," he said presently. "And yet this
  place might be made a perfect paradise. Sylvia, I cannot tell you how sorry I
  am."</p>

  <p>"Don't," Sylvia said. "Please don't. I really can't stand it. I must go my
  way, Lionel, and I must do the best I can till the sun begins to shine. And
  surely it must shine for me some of these days."</p>

  <p>"It shall," Markham declared. "It shall be the business of my life to see
  to that. But how strange it all is! Here is a woman like your mother,
  apparently hopelessly insane, but who sees into the heart of things as none
  of us can do. Now, fancy her guessing that I was making love to you. And
  fancy her remembering about the tragic death of my father and all about that
  man de Barsac, whom, by the way, I have always believed to be a scoundrel
  from the first. Well, it's a warning. And, if you will give me a cup of tea,
  I will get back again. Have you heard anything from those theatrical people?
  Have you heard anything from your father?"</p>

  <p>"That's not at all likely," Sylvia said. "There is very little chance of
  us seeing him so long as he is living in the lap of luxury at Baron's Court.
  And as for Maxwell Frick, well, he will communicate with me when he
  recollects. You can quite understand, Lionel, how anxious I am to be doing
  something; indeed, I must do something before long. My mother doesn't realise
  how desperate things are in the house. We have only a few shillings between
  us, and there isn't a single tradesman within twenty miles who would trust
  Major Dorn with as much as a loaf of bread."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Markham was striding down the road in the direction of
  Baron's Court, and presently at a sudden turn, he came face to face with the
  smiling features and striking wardrobe of Maxwell Frick himself.</p>

  <p>"Aha, my gallant youth," the actor cried. "And what are you doing here?
  Have you found her out, my boy? Following her to the ends of the earth, I
  suppose? That's good. Well, I'm on my way to see Miss Dorn myself. Oh yes,
  it's all right. I have got her contract in my pocket. And between you and me,
  my boy, she's worth every penny of it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; THE PUMA.</h2>

  <p class="first">Markham was pleased enough to meet Maxwell Frick again, for the little he
  had seen of that genial Bohemian he had liked well enough, and besides, was
  he not bringing him good news for Sylvia, whom he had gone out of his way on
  more than one occasion to benefit? So that he hooked his arm in that of Frick
  and began to retrace his footsteps.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to hear what you say," he said, "because the news you
  bring is more than welcome. I know that in your kind-hearted way you have
  taken the greatest interest in Miss Dorn, a common interest as great as
  mine."</p>

  <p>"Ah, my boy," Frick smiled. "And that's a good deal, isn't it? I don't
  wish to pry into other people's affairs, and you can tell me as much or as
  little as you like, but I think you know what I mean, and I am very pleased
  to find that you are down here. She is a real nice girl, and&mdash;well, I
  don't think I need say any more. But from what I can hear it is rather a
  funny household, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Dreadful," Markham said. "But perhaps you may be able to judge that for
  yourself in a few minutes. Now, between ourselves, Frick, I take more than a
  usual interest in Miss Dorn's affairs, and that's as far as it is necessary
  to go for the moment. Now, you are a man of courage and resolution, I
  believe, and perhaps a little later on I shall have to ask your assistance in
  a matter that involves personal danger."</p>

  <p>"Is that really so?" Frick asked. "Well, you can count me in. I love
  adventures. And though I am getting on a bit in life I don't think there is
  much that I am afraid of. Are you coming back with me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Markham said. "Now you go and get your business over
  and I will wait for you here. Where do you happen to be staying
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>It was quite characteristic of the comedian that he had not the slightest
  idea where he was spending the night. Possibly he might walk back to
  Tavistock and find a lodging there, but he had quite an open mind on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"In that case, you had better come back with me," Markham said. "Where are
  your belongings? At Tavistock Station? Then we will pick them up and taxi out
  to Baron's Court. I want to introduce you to Mr. John Bevill, who takes the
  keenest interest in this cinematograph venture of yours. He is the man I told
  you about, the man who has the finest private menagerie in England. He is
  very keen on having a series of pictures taken of his wild animals, and I
  thought perhaps you might be able to do a good deal of business on behalf of
  your firm. Now could you work up some sensational story and bring in those
  animals? Has not your firm a sort of stock author, who turns his hand to that
  sort of thing? Do you see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>In his impulsive way Frick fell in love with the scheme and began to
  enlarge upon it.</p>

  <p>"That's a rattling good idea, my boy," he said. "Yes, we have got the very
  thing you speak of. A sensational writer who will throw together a good plot
  in no time. Of course I came down here as a sort of advance agent to get
  everything ready for the big Dartmoor drama we are filming, and from what I
  have heard, Lanton Place will make a magnificent background. We shall want to
  take it over practically, but of course we shall bring all our portable
  studios and all that kind of thing. But that animal story of yours is a great
  idea, and if Mr. Bevill will only put me up for a night or two we can discuss
  the preliminaries at once."</p>

  <p>"He will be delighted," Markham said. "Now, you get on and finish your
  business with Miss Dorn, whilst I sit on the stile here and smoke a
  cigarette."</p>

  <p>It was quite an hour later before Frick came back full of enthusiasm for
  what he had seen, and absolutely certain that the venture was going to prove
  a tremendous success.</p>

  <p>"It's great, my boy, great," he cried. "That melancholy house with the
  blackened ruins will make a glorious background. I have never felt more
  depressed in my life. But we will alter all that presently. When we put up
  our temporary buildings and get our company down here, we'll make things hum
  at Lanton Place and put money in the pocket of the proprietor at the same
  time. From what I have seen, I should say he badly needs it. By the way, he's
  over at Baron's Court, isn't he? What sort of a man is he?"</p>

  <p>"A blackguard," Markham said curtly. "A cold and calculating scoundrel,
  who lives entirely for himself. He was, at one time, a comparatively rich
  man. Once upon a time Lanton Place was one of the show houses in the
  neighbourhood. But it is a melancholy story, and I don't intend to dwell upon
  it. But you will see the man for yourself presently, and you can make your
  own arrangements."</p>

  <p>"In that case, he ought to be pleased to get twenty pounds a week," Frick
  said. "As we shall probably be here for six months he ought to jump at
  it."</p>

  <p>As Markham prophesied, Frick received quite a warm welcome at Baron's
  Court. He found Bevill eager enough to go into the matter and quite ready to
  place the whole of his menagerie at the disposal of the Syndicate. But just
  for the moment Dorn and de Barsac were by no means pleased at the advent of
  the florid little man, who seemed to take everything for granted and who
  talked freely enough about his plans. But when presently he approached Dorn
  with his offer, the latter was amiable enough, and long before dinner a rough
  contract was drawn up and signed on both sides.</p>

  <p>"That's all very well for you," de Barsac muttered. "It ensures you a
  comfortable living for the next months, and that is all you seem to think
  about. But, after all, it's nothing in comparison with the big scheme we have
  on hand."</p>

  <p>"No, but it's a good deal to me," Dorn retorted. "And besides, what does
  it matter? This man Frick and all his company will be at Lanton Place, so
  that they are not likely to interfere with us."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," de Barsac sneered. "That's all you seem to know about it.
  But, as far as I can understand, it will be the best part of a month before
  Frick has made all his arrangements at Lanton Place, and meanwhile it looks
  as if he had made up his mind to make himself quite at home here. You heard
  what passed at tea-time? You heard Bevill ask Frick to regard this place as
  his own, and furthermore, he was invited to bring some out-at-elbows novelist
  who will loaf about here for weeks writing some silly story round the
  menagerie. And we shall have cinematograph operators and goodness knows what
  besides running about all over the place as if it belonged to them, and
  making themselves a general nuisance. It's very unfortunate."</p>

  <p>"You're not blaming me?" Dorn asked. "It's no doing of mine, and even if I
  had not been here at all Frick would have turned up just the same. If I had
  been fool enough to refuse these people the run of Lanton Place, they would
  have found some other suitable spot. Anyway, it can't be helped, and we shall
  have to make the best of it."</p>

  <p>De Barsac listened moodily.</p>

  <p>"It's very unfortunate," he said. "And you know perfectly well that for
  our purpose we want the house entirely to ourselves. The fewer people here
  the better. If we could afford to wait a few months or so, it wouldn't much
  matter, but you know how impatient Lupas is."</p>

  <p>"Lupas is a fool," Dorn exclaimed. "If he doesn't mind what he's doing, he
  will spoil everything. Now, were you talking through your hat, or did you
  really mean it when you told Lupas that you could get him a sight of old
  Bevill's will? If you could only do that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's possible," de Barsac said. "I happen to know where it's kept, and
  I might possibly get hold of the key of the safe. That's not a bad idea of
  yours, Dorn, and I will see what I can do. It ought to be to-night."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the delighted Professor, together with Markham and Frick and Sir
  Watney Gibson, was conducting his guest over the menagerie. They went from
  cage to cage, past the lions and the tigers and the other feline animals,
  until at length the whole collection had been exhausted. They were a fine lot
  altogether, and Frick was loud in his admiration. He looked round the
  wide-spreading park with its little hills and valleys and thick belts of
  trees here and there, and expressed himself as quite satisfied with what he
  called the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "we ought to be able to make a big thing of this. If you
  don't mind, Mr. Bevill, I'll get Stafford Hatton down here to-morrow. That's
  the man who writes up all our scenarios. He's a wonderfully clever chap if
  you can only keep him off the drink, and he'll write a story round those
  animals that will be simply great. Is your park safe? I mean, could you
  manage to get some of those beasts out into the open? Have you got any keeper
  who could handle them if they were once out of their cages? You see what I
  mean? If we could photograph them in the open the pictures would be far more
  effective."</p>

  <p>"There's nobody who could do that but myself," Bevill said. "There isn't a
  single cage here I am afraid to go into. But how my beasts would behave if
  they were once out in the open, I can't say. I don't think it would be
  particularly dangerous for me, but it might be a serious matter for your
  operators."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Frick said thoughtfully. "You see, we've got a new
  dodge now whereby we can get up cameras and direct them from a distance by an
  electric process. For instance, if you drove one of your animals through that
  thicket yonder they could be photographed automatically whilst the operator
  was a long way off&mdash;I don't know, but I rather fancy we could work that
  sort of thing in any light, even in moonlight. But that we can go into later.
  Just fancy that magnificent beast yonder prowling through the wood as if in
  search of prey whilst all the time he has been driven. It would make a
  splendid picture. You see, we could fix up half a dozen cameras and work them
  simultaneously by the process I speak of. Indeed, I don't see any other way
  of doing it. Still, of course, if there is any danger of the animals
  escaping&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They couldn't," Bevill said. "They couldn't possibly get outside the
  park. You see, there's a high wall all round specially built for the
  purpose."</p>

  <p>"That's good," Frick cried enthusiastically. "This is going to be one of
  the biggest things on earth."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; THE OPEN SAFE.</h2>

  <p class="first">John Bevill and his strange assortment of guests sat round the dinner
  table later on in the evening discussing the subject of the wild animals in
  the menagerie and all connected with them, the talk being led
  enthusiastically by Frick, who declared that the Baron's Court menagerie was
  about to take history or something like it. He was immensely taken, too, with
  Vim, who sat by his side smoking his cigarette with the air of a connoisseur
  and sipping his liqueur like a man of the world. Vim seemed to have settled
  down again now; he had lost all the snarling vindictiveness that he had
  displayed the last day or two, and appeared to be taking the keenest interest
  in what was going on around him.</p>

  <p>"It's great," Frick said. "Absolutely great. And if Stafford Hatton
  doesn't say so, I shall be greatly mistaken. He can work Vim here into the
  plot&mdash;indeed. I don't see how we are going to do without him. By the
  way, Mr. Bevill, how does this amazing ape of yours get on with the other
  animals?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, excellently," Bevill said. "He is on the best of terms with all of
  them. He goes in and out of their cages with me. I don't know whether he
  talks to them or not, but most of them seem to understand him."</p>

  <p>"Vim isn't an animal at all," Sir Watney Gibson remarked. "I told you that
  before. He is a human being. His outward appearance is not all one would
  exactly expect from a human, but he's got a soul somewhere, and I am firmly
  convinced that he knows all we are talking about. And if he could speak, he
  would tell us so. Look at his hands. I know you people call them paws. But
  they used to be paws with us a few hundred centuries ago. By the way de
  Barsac, how are you getting on with that model that you were going to do for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"What model?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, the model of Vim's hand and forearm that I measured for you a night
  or two ago. You took the impression in wax. You can't have forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Really, I beg your pardon," de Barsac said. "But all the same, I had
  forgotten it for the moment. You see, I have been so very busy the last day
  or two. But I can promise to let you have it to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"That will be quite all right," Gibson said. "I should like to take it
  with me at the end of the week."</p>

  <p>De Barsac's eyes lighted up for a moment, a fact that was not lost on
  Markham, who sat quietly smoking his cigarette and watching everything
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"You are leaving us then?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am sorry, but I must," Gibson said. "I have got to give evidence
  next week in that Annondale murder case. A most mysterious affair, but I
  think I shall be able to help the authorities to hang the man they have laid
  their hands on."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," de Barsac drawled. "Why is it that all the world is so
  fascinated with a man hunt? Do you happen to be on in this scene,
  Markham?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," Markham replied. "Mr. Bevill has asked me to stay on for a
  few days, and seeing that Sir Watney has no need for me, I am remaining."</p>

  <p>As he spoke Markham could see that this piece of information was by no
  means pleasing to de Barsac. He sat there moodily smoking and sipping his
  port, until at length the little party round the dining table broke up, and
  de Barsac, with Dorn, strolled off in the direction of the studio. The rest
  of the party made their way to the billiard-room.</p>

  <p>There they sat, talking and chatting for the best part of an hour or so,
  until Sir Watney announced his intention of going to bed, and shortly
  afterwards Mr. Bevill followed his example. For a little time Markham and
  Frick smoked their cigars in ruminative silence.</p>

  <p>"Now what do you think of it all, Frick?" Markham asked. "Amazing
  household, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Frick replied. "I have been knocking about all over
  the world for the last thirty years, and if I only had the ability to put my
  experiences on paper I could tell of a great many more extraordinary
  experiences than this. But, all the same, you are quite right, it is an
  amazing household. I felt, to-night, when we were at dinner, as if I were
  dreaming. Every time I looked at that amazing ape I wanted to rub my eyes and
  ask myself whether I was awake or not. I saw those two monkeys they used to
  call Max and Moritz, but neither of them were anything like as human as Vim.
  But is he always quiet like that? Doesn't he break out sometimes? By Jove, if
  he did, he would be able to wipe the floor with the whole household before
  anybody could interfere."</p>

  <p>"I believe he has his moods," Markham said. "And in connection with your
  question a strange thing happened early yesterday morning. Mr. Bevill had
  occasion to come back here from his bungalow in the New Forest and he found
  Vim tied to a tree. Heaven knows who was responsible for that idiotic
  mischief&mdash;probably de Barsac, as far as I can understand. You see, de
  Barsac confines himself almost entirely to the study of animals, and from
  what I can gather he wanted to see Vim in a royal rage. Well, he managed that
  all right, but Miss Dorn told me it nearly cost Bevill his life. It's not a
  very pretty story, and it shows up de Barsac in a very cruel and cold-blooded
  light. Perhaps I had better tell you the story. It's worth listening to."</p>

  <p>"I don't like that a bit," Frick said when at length Markham had finished.
  "And I don't see the point of dressing up a dummy for the purpose of
  infuriating the animal. But then, I am a creature of moods and impulses, as
  you know, and perhaps I have taken an unreasonable dislike to de Barsac. I
  dislike him quite as much as I do Major Dorn. Oh, I know he's handsome enough
  and a great favourite with the women, but I mistrust that sleek appearance of
  his, and I can see the tiger behind those brown eyes. Hang me if he doesn't
  walk like a tiger. I calculate I'm as good-natured and hospitable as most
  people, or I should be if I had anything to be hospitable with, but if I were
  Mr. Bevill, I should have given de Barsac what the Americans call his walking
  ticket long ago. But look here, Markham, isn't there more in this than meets
  the eye? You hinted some little time ago that there was something very wrong
  going on here. Is de Barsac at the bottom of it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if I were in the witness-box, I should say no," Markham replied.
  "But between one man and another I have my doubts. I believe that there is
  some very sinister underhand business going on between those two scoundrels,
  and Mr. Bevill is going to pay for it. What is going on I haven't the
  remotest idea, but I'm going to find out. That's why I'm staying on here. I
  have talked it over with my uncle, and he thinks it would be just as well.
  You heard de Barsac ask me if I was leaving on Saturday with Sir Watney, and
  you may have noticed his expression of disappointment when I told him that I
  was staying on. Did you notice anything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did," Frick said. "I'm a pretty easy-going chap, but there is
  little that escapes my attention."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then you are something like my uncle in that respect," Markham said.
  "He is hot-headed and impetuous enough, and most people regard him as a
  scientific enthusiast who can see nothing beyond the end of his nose. But I
  pity any criminal who banks on that. Once Sir Watney's suspicions were
  aroused, he has the tenacity of a bull dog, and there is not a detective in
  London who has a clearer vision than he. He pretends to take no great
  interest in what de Barsac is doing here, but I believe he does, all the
  same. He listens and asks absent-minded questions, and then months afterwards
  he brings up the subject again, and then you realise that he has been
  following a closely-reasoned train of thought for months. If de Barsac
  imagines that he has a child to deal with, he is making the mistake of his
  life."</p>

  <p>Markham led the way up the stairs a few moments later, putting out the
  lights as he went, and said good-night to Frick outside the latter's bedroom
  door. Once alone, Frick turned on the lights and proceeded to light a cigar.
  It was characteristic of the man that he had put off his correspondence till
  the last moment; but then, as it was an invariable habit of his to turn night
  into day, he dragged his portmanteau from under the bed and proceeded to
  unearth the necessary writing materials. Then for the next two hours or more
  he set himself down industriously until everything was finished and a big
  pile of letters lay on the table by his side. He rose presently with a yawn
  as a clock somewhere downstairs was striking the hour of three, and commenced
  to prepare himself for bed.</p>

  <p>He would have one more cigarette before turning in, he decided; but though
  he searched everywhere, there was no sign of a match to be seen. For once in
  his life he decided that the electric light was not entirely an unmixed
  blessing. He remembered that on a little table in the hall he had noticed a
  box of matches when he came upstairs. He fumbled along till he found the
  switch in the corridor and turned on the light. Then he crept very quietly
  down the stairs and, running his hand along the edge of the table secured the
  matches. As he did so, however, his hand came in contact with a big brass
  tray that fell on the polished floor with a resounding crash. Almost
  immediately a light somewhere at the back of the hall went out, and Frick
  could hear a smothered curse from somewhere near by, followed by the sound of
  retreating footsteps.</p>

  <p>Evidently there were thieves in the house. Without the slightest
  hesitation Frick reached for the big brass tray and beat upon it with his
  fists until the whole house resounded with the hideous din. Bedroom doors
  began to open, and presently figures appeared on the stairs.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" Bevill demanded.</p>

  <p>"Burglars," Frick said. "In the library."</p>

  <p>Surely enough the library door was wide open, and when they came to look
  round it was seen that the door of the old-fashioned fireproof safe had been
  forced. But nothing had gone apparently until Bevill gave vent to an
  exclamation, and he shook his head as he went through the papers in the safe
  for the second time. He was looking grave enough now.</p>

  <p>"Have you lost anything?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Bevill said. "My will has gone."</p>

  <p>He turned away without further comment, apparently not noticing what
  struck Markham as strange&mdash;that, despite all the clamour, there was no
  sign of de Barsac or Dorn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Are you quite certain?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can look again," Bevill replied. "It's a most extraordinary thing
  altogether. There are a good many valuables here, but not one of them appears
  to be missing."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I was a bit too soon," Frick explained. "I had better explain. I
  came down to look for a box of matches. I hadn't been to bed, as you see, and
  I thought that I would have another cigarette before turning in. Naturally I
  had a good deal of correspondence to attend to, and I always do that sort of
  thing late at night. I had just finished and was creeping quietly downstairs
  in search of a box of matches which I remembered seeing on a little table in
  the hall, and in getting them I accidentally knocked down that brass tray. It
  made a good deal of noise, of course, and I expect that it frightened the
  thieves. Probably they had only just begun. That might account for nothing
  being missing."</p>

  <p>"But something is missing," Bevill protested. "I have just told you that I
  cannot find my will. I placed it there a couple of months ago alone on this
  little top shelf, and you can all see for yourselves that it is no longer
  there. Moreover, I have not opened the safe since the day I placed the
  document inside. It's a most extraordinary thing altogether. I don't see how
  anybody could benefit by taking the document. It is certainly of no use to
  anybody as long as I am alive."</p>

  <p>"It is strange," Sir Watney Gibson said. "But how did the thieves get in
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's quite simple," Markham said. "You will see that the window is
  open. They must have come and gone that way. But it might have been
  worse."</p>

  <p>"So it might," Bevill agreed. "And, in the circumstances, nobody is any
  the poorer. They are quite welcome to what they have taken; besides, it will
  be no difficult matter for me to execute a new testament. Really, gentlemen,
  I am very sorry to give you all this trouble. There is nothing for it now but
  to go back to bed and leave further discussion till the morning. It certainly
  is a matter that I must investigate."</p>

  <p>Markham listened in silence, though it seemed to him that he might have
  said a good deal had he liked. In the first place it appeared to him as
  strange that, despite the noise Frick had made in rousing the household,
  there had been no sign, so far, of either Dorn or de Barsac. Everybody else
  had crowded into the library, and it seemed impossible to believe that the
  two men in question had slept through that hideous din. Then, just as
  everybody was disappearing in the direction of their bedrooms. Dorn appeared
  at the head of the staircase, followed a moment or two later by de
  Barsac.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?" Dorn asked with what seemed to Markham to be an
  exaggerated yawn. "I was fast asleep just now when it seemed to me that I
  heard a hideous crash, followed by another one, and I woke up. Thinking it
  was all a dream, I turned over again, and then I noticed a light under my
  door and I heard the sound of voices."</p>

  <p>"Much the same thing happened to me," de Barsac observed. "What's the
  matter, Bevill? Have burglars been making a raid on the house?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that," Bevill said. "They got in through the library
  window and raided my safe."</p>

  <p>"And is anything missing?"</p>

  <p>"Only one thing," Bevill explained. "Those thieves have gone off with my
  will. Why they wanted a useless document like that passes my comprehension.
  There are a lot of valuable things in the safe, too, but not one of them has
  been touched. Mr. Frick suggests that they were alarmed before they had time
  to touch the valuables."</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary thing!" de Barsac said. "Fancy wasting all that
  time and taking all that risk for the sake of a paper not worth sixpence. At
  any rate, you can make a new will to-morrow if you like."</p>

  <p>De Barsac spoke quite easily and naturally as he stood there clad only in
  his pyjamas, as indeed was Dorn. In the doorway, half in the shadow, Markham
  stood, watching everything keenly. He noticed something presently that
  brought a flash into his eyes and the suggestion of a smile to his lips, but
  he said nothing as he turned presently and followed Sir Watney Gibson up the
  stairs in the direction of the latter's bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Can I come inside for a moment?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By all means," Gibson said. "Now, my boy, what is it? You have found
  something out, and want to tell me."</p>

  <p>"I think I have," Markham said. "It's only a little thing, but it might
  lead us a long way. Now, you heard everything that went on. Do you really
  believe that those thieves ran all that risk merely for the sake of getting
  away with Mr. Bevill's will? What is the use of it to them, now they've got
  it? It is perfectly valueless as long as the old gentleman is alive, and if
  he were to die to-morrow they would be bound to produce it."</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," Sir Watney suggested. "Suppose that whoever took it
  knew the contents of that document. Let us suppose for a moment that Mr.
  Bevill intends to leave a large sum of money to someone outside his own
  family. And let us suppose, further, that these audacious thieves have some
  pressing reason why the money in question should not reach the hand for which
  it is intended. They probably count upon the fact that Bevill is a careless
  man who would put his will away and think no more about it, which is just the
  sort of thing he would do. Then, if anything happens to him, the will is
  missing, and all the old gentleman's property naturally goes to his
  next-of-kin. Now, this next-of-kin, as I happen to know, is a ne'er-do-well
  nephew to whom Bevill does not intend to leave a penny."</p>

  <p>"Then you think the case is clear?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate, my theory is plausible," Gibson said. "It looks to me
  as if the scapegrace nephew knew exactly what had happened, and had come down
  here with the intention of getting hold of that document. Once he did that,
  he would feel himself perfectly safe. He would destroy the will and wait for
  his uncle's death. Depend upon it, my boy, that is exactly what has happened.
  If the thief had had five minutes more, he would have got away safely and no
  one any the wiser. Really, I don't think we need worry any more about it. I
  rather gathered from Mr. Bevill's manner to-night that he has some notion of
  the truth, and that's why he did not make any fuss about it. At any rate I
  can ask him in the morning. And, as things have turned out, the thief has
  only had his trouble for his pains."</p>

  <p>Markham shook his head quietly.</p>

  <p>"That's not my idea at all," he said. "If you will give me two or three
  minutes, I will tell you my theory. Now, didn't it strike you as rather
  strange that neither de Barsac nor Dorn put in an appearance this evening
  till most of us were on our way upstairs again?"</p>

  <p>"Oho," Sir Watney said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, they came down last of all. Now, I defy anybody to remain asleep in
  the house whilst Frick was making that hideous din on the tray. It was loud
  enough to waken the dead. It brought everybody in the house downstairs with
  the exception of those two men, whom we both mistrust and suspect. And when
  they did come they were a little too natural. Did you notice how Dorn yawned
  and de Barsac rubbed his eyes? It was acting in a fashion; of that I am
  certain. Innocent men would have showed some sign of alarm, but they were not
  even curious. And there is another thing I noticed. The two top buttons of
  Dorn's pyjama coat were unfastened, and distinctly saw a white shirt and a
  waistcoat beneath. In other words, he was wearing his pyjamas over a portion
  of his clothing. Now, why should a man be doing that at three o'clock in the
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact?" Sir Watney asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am prepared to swear to it. I suggest those men went out through
  the library window at the first alarm, and stood outside waiting till
  everything was quiet again. If the worst came to the worst they could have
  stepped in the studio and slipped in the house to-morrow morning when the
  servants came down. No doubt they stood outside the window there in the
  darkness, perhaps listening to what was going on, or what is more likely
  still, found a ladder somewhere in the garden and contrived to reach a
  bedroom window that way. At any rate, I feel quite convinced in my own mind
  that those two rascals know all about it."</p>

  <p>"Well," Sir Watney admitted, "with what you say, it certainly presents the
  case in a fresh light. There is one thing against your theory. I happen to
  know that Bevill thinks a good deal of de Barsac, and it is his intention to
  leave him a large sum of money. Moreover, de Barsac knows it, and this being
  so, what on earth does the man want to run a risk like that for? Why should
  he steal a document that is worth a small fortune to him?"</p>

  <p>"That we have to find out," Markham said. "That is why I am going to stay
  on here after you go. There is some deep conspiracy here that I mean to get
  to the bottom of. What it is I haven't the remotest idea, but I feel it in my
  bones that it means danger to Mr. Bevill. However, it is no use to discuss
  the matter further, so I'll get along to bed."</p>

  <p>There was no sign on the face of de Barsac when he came down in the
  morning to show that he had been in the least disturbed by the events of the
  previous evening. He and Dorn appeared to be in unusually good spirits,
  discussing the burglary from the point of view that Bevill had made a
  mistake, and that in his absent-minded way he had placed the missing will
  somewhere else, and had forgotten all about it.</p>

  <p>"Just the sort of thing you would do, Bevill," de Barsac said. "I can
  remember one or two occasions in point."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I might," Bevill agreed. "I am prepared to swear I didn't,
  but possibly I am wrong."</p>

  <p>"Of course you are," de Barsac laughed. "You will find eventually that
  your will is in the hands of your lawyer. Solicitors never part with those
  kind of things if they can help it. And, by the way, Sir Watney, I shall
  finish that cast for you this morning. I'll bring it in at lunch time, and
  you can pick it away in your portmanteau."</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" Gibson said. "That's interesting. I shall value it highly,
  and, unless I am greatly mistaken, it will help me to startle society before
  long."</p>

  <p>Gibson spoke lightly enough, but the time was at hand when his prophecy
  was more than fulfilled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX. &mdash; AN ANXIOUS CONSULTATION.</h2>

  <p class="first">Once de Barsac and Dorn were alone together in the studio the mask dropped
  from their faces and they sat regarding one another with deep anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Well?" de Barsac demanded. "What's to be done? It was your suggestion.
  You got me into the mess, and I shall expect you to get me out of it
  again."</p>

  <p>"What's the good of talking like that?" Dorn demanded. "You were just as
  keen on it as anybody else. It was a bit of cruel bad luck, and if that
  blundering fool had not have come down the stairs we should have been safely
  back in our bedrooms within five minutes and no one any the wiser. And
  besides, you've got the old man's will."</p>

  <p>"A precious lot of good that is," de Barsac grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, isn't it? Upon my word, you talk like a child. We have got it, and no
  one else knows anything about it&mdash;that is, no one outside the house. Of
  course, Bevill will make another will, and naturally enough, you will figure
  in it for the same amount as you figured in the last."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all very well," de Barsac retorted. "But his suspicions are
  roused. He knows perfectly well that no ordinary burglar would have any use
  for a paper like that. And, mind you, when he is roused, Bevill is by no
  means the innocent child you take him for. If he gets the slightest inkling
  of what is going on, I can say good-bye to that legacy. And here is Lupas,
  not more than a mile away, fretting and fuming and ready for mischief at any
  moment. If that meddling interfering young Markham drops a hint as to Lupas'
  real character to Bevill, I am done. The old man will see at once that I am
  in Lupas' hands, and if he once learns that he won't leave me a single penny.
  He's got to make a new will now, even if it is only to protect himself
  against that nephew of his, who will come into everything if Bevill dies
  to-day."</p>

  <p>Dorn smiled pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "you are not half so clever as I took you to be. Can't
  you see that we must play up to Bevill's dislike for that nephew of his?
  There's our salvation. You told me about that nephew a day or two ago, and
  when I was dressing this morning the whole pretty scheme dawned on me. When I
  was in the park before breakfast I took the opportunity speaking to the old
  man, and adroitly mentioned his nephew. He rose to it like a shot. He
  swallowed the whole thing like a glass of milk. Before I had finished with
  him he was perfectly satisfied that his nephew, or some scoundrel employed on
  his behalf, had come down here to steal the will. I want to so arrange it
  that the old man should voice his suspicions before witnesses. If we can do
  that&mdash;and it's quite an easy matter&mdash;we shall have done a fine
  morning's work."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"Really, my dear friend, you are very stupid this morning. Supposing we
  get Bevill to do that, and supposing that anything happens to him
  afterwards&mdash;I mean such as an accident or a sudden death? Do you follow
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," de Barsac said hoarsely. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, Bevill is found dead in the park, say," Dorn went on in a whisper.
  "He has met with foul play. If this happens to him, who would be the first
  person to be suspected? Why a dissolute nephew who lives in London and comes
  down here occasionally demanding money and generally causing a scandal. It is
  known that the old man has disinherited this nephew by will. It is known that
  the will has mysteriously disappeared from the safe, following an audacious
  burglary. And, moreover, it is known that, in the presence of witnesses, the
  old man has suggested that the nephew is a thief. Can't you see how suspicion
  will be directed in one channel, almost to the exclusion of everything else?
  My dear fellow, here is fate actually going out of its way to help us."</p>

  <p>For some time de Barsac appeared to debate the point in his mind, then
  gradually his face cleared and an ugly smile spread itself from his lips.</p>

  <p>"You are a cunning devil, Dorn," he said. "I think the most cunning that I
  ever met. I flatter myself that I am pretty shrewd in these matters, but,
  upon my word, I am a perfect child compared with you. But all the same, we
  made an awful hash of things last night, and, on the whole, it would have
  been far better if we had let matters alone. And, so far as Lupas is
  concerned, we are no better off than we were before."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is where you are wrong. Lupas knows nothing about what went on
  last night, and as he cannot possibly come here. He is not in the least
  likely to know. Therefore we can take that precious document and show him,
  and he will see for himself that you have told him nothing more than the
  truth when you said that you would benefit largely by Bevill's death. He will
  see it in black and white, and with any luck he will never learn how you got
  hold of the document. So, you see now, that when young Markham put his foot
  down, and practically ordered Lupas out of the house, he was doing us a good
  turn."</p>

  <p>"Yes, as things have turned out, you are right," de Barsac conceded. "But
  he suspects us."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let him," Dorn said impatiently. "Leave it to me. I think I have
  shown you how all these misfortunes of ours have turned out blessings in
  disguise, and, after all, Markham has no reason to suspect us, except that he
  knows that I have business dealings with Lupas. Oh, there's nothing to worry
  about, everything is going our way, and it will all come right in the long
  run. Really, I am glad that thing happened last night, though it was touch
  and go."</p>

  <p>"It was that," de Barsac grinned. "I shan't forget in a hurry how you
  looked last night when I stood on your shoulders trying to get in my bedroom
  window. Or how shaken you appeared to be when I dragged you up after me.
  Still, it's all over now, and there's not a living soul in the world who
  could trace that burglary to us. What do you say to walking over to Lupas'
  quarters and showing him the paper?"</p>

  <p>"Just what I was going to suggest," Dorn said. "He must be impressed by
  it, and if you play your cards properly he might be disposed to let you have
  a further advance. At any rate, you might try it on."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll certainly do that," de Barsac grinned. "As a matter of fact, I
  am down to my last sovereign. I have drawn every penny of advance commission,
  and I don't know where to turn for a little ready money. Of course, I might
  borrow a bit from Bevill, but knowing what is at stake I dare not do that.
  You see, the old boy regards me as a rich man, as indeed I ought to be if I
  wasn't such a fool. But seeing that I have always posed before him as a
  capitalist, any suggestion to the contrary might do me serious harm."</p>

  <p>"Of course it would," Dorn agreed. "But at any rate, you can try Lupas,
  and if it turns out trumps you might let me have a hundred or two to go on
  with."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll certainly do that," de Barsac said. "Whatever my failings are, I
  am always generous enough to my friends. And, upon my word, you will have
  earned it. That is a really fine idea of yours about the nephew. Now, come
  on, go and get your hat, and we'll stroll across the fields and interview the
  lion in his den."</p>

  <p>They made their way across the fields a few moments later in search of
  Lupas, whom they found presently seated in the sun in a pleasant orchard
  reading his paper and smoking under the shadow of a tree. He glowered with no
  expression of friendliness on his face, and his greeting was not in the least
  auspicious. He looked up sulkily.</p>

  <p>"Well," he asked, "what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I like that," de Barsac said with a forced laugh. "Here are we, come
  all this way to see you, to cheer you in the sylvan solitude, and you receive
  us in this fashion."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you expect?" Lupas asked. "Here am I, actually wasting my
  time in the company of a lot of country clodhoppers, when I might be making
  money in London. It's all very well for you people, living on the fat of the
  land yonder, but I have got to be considered, and don't you forget it. Now,
  have you done anything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I flatter myself we have done a good deal," de Barsac said. "You
  wanted to have a look at a certain document. Wasn't that the idea?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know if it was in existence," Lupas snarled. "I have heard
  those fairy tales before. Half the young men in London who come borrowing
  money from me have expectations&mdash;on paper. And when I ask to see those
  papers they are rarely forthcoming. Oh, Henderby Lupas is a scoundrel, of
  course, a rascally old money-lender whom any sprig of nobility can insult.
  They come into my office and call me Shylock, and all sorts of pleasantries
  which they think I am bound to put up with and yet half of the young devils
  would rob me without the slightest hesitation if I only gave them the shadow
  of a chance. I know them, and I know you too, de Barsac. If you could get out
  of your obligations to-morrow, you would do so like a shot."</p>

  <p>"Nice amiable temper you are in this morning," de Barsac laughed. "I
  rather judge, from what you say, that the document you mention exists only in
  my imagination."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd like to see it," Lupas sneered.</p>

  <p>By way of reply de Barsac produced the document and placed it in the hands
  of the money-lender. Lupas put on his spectacles, and read it carefully line
  by line until he had fairly mastered its contents. Then, for the first
  moment, his grim air relaxed and he grew almost civil.</p>

  <p>"Well, it appears to be all right," he said.</p>

  <p>"Appears to be all right," de Barsac cried. "It is all right. And a nice
  job to get hold of it. I ran the risk of losing everything, including your
  money. But it's all right now, and I can keep that document as long as I
  please. Now, look here, Lupas, I want money."</p>

  <p>"As usual," Lupas sneered.</p>

  <p>"As usual, as you say. Now, on the strength of that document, I want you
  to lend me another two thousand pounds. You can charge me the usual rates,
  but I must have the money."</p>

  <p>"You can have it on one condition," Lupas said. "And I'll send you a
  cheque from town to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"You must leave this document in my hands."</p>

  <p>"All right," de Barsac said recklessly. "All right."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; ON THE ROAD.</h2>

  <p class="first">De Barsac swung along by the side of Dorn, whistling to himself and having
  every appearance of a man who has succeeded in some great endeavour. The mere
  fact that his financial difficulties were at an end for the moment was all
  sufficient for him, but Dorn apparently did not share this opinion. He was
  going to benefit himself, and, indeed, he needed the money badly enough, but
  he appeared to be anxious and ill at ease&mdash;a fact upon which de Barsac
  rallied him.</p>

  <p>"What the matter?" the latter asked. "Upon my word, there's no satisfying
  some people. Here you are, the richer by two hundred pounds which you have,
  obtained merely by the asking for, and yet you look like a man who has been
  robbed instead of one who has had a fine slice of luck."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand all that," Dorn said. "And I am much obliged to you
  for your kind intentions. But you are so rash, so infernally impetuous."</p>

  <p>"The artistic temperament," de Barsac said airily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, curse the artistic temperament. That recklessness of yours will get
  you into serious trouble one of these days. I don't think you care two-pence
  about to-morrow so long as you have got a few pounds to go on with
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh well, I suppose it's no use talking. You'll go on like this till you
  land yourself in gaol. I don't doubt your courage. When it comes to personal
  danger, I would rather have you with me than anybody I know. But you take
  some frightful risks. I like to see my way clear, I like to see the way out,
  and I prefer, if possible, to know what the other fellow is doing. Never
  trust anybody as far as you can see, is my motto. Take Lupas, for instance.
  Wouldn't he throw you over to-morrow if it suited his purpose? Would he
  hesitate a moment to betray you? Not he. Now, you see what you have done. He
  only wanted to see that will, which was quite sufficient for all practical
  purposes, and goodness knows, we took a hideous risk enough to get it. And
  directly it comes into our hands, you part with it. You needn't have done so
  if you had refused to surrender it. Lupas would have let you have the money
  just the same. As it is, you have gone out of your way to strengthen his
  power over you. Ah, my friend, some of these days you will be sorry for
  that."</p>

  <p>"Sounds prophetic," de Barsac said.</p>

  <p>He was to find out how prophetic it was before long. Meanwhile he would
  have dismissed the whole thing as hardly worth another thought, but Dorn was
  not so easily shaken off.</p>

  <p>"Very well," the latter said. "I won't labour the point. Now, look here,
  there's no time to be lost. We shall have a house full of people at Baron's
  Court before long, and before they come we must do something. I propose we
  walk into Tavistock and lunch quietly at some hotel there and settle our plan
  of campaign. It's no use putting things off from day to day, every hour makes
  our task more difficult; and if we are going through with the thing, the
  sooner it is faced the better. Now, listen to me."</p>

  <p>For half an hour or so they walked quietly along the road, whilst Dorn
  talked in a husky voice that was little more than a whisper. He spoke with
  his head hung down, glancing from side to side as if half fearful that the
  woods had ears, whilst he unfolded his scheme that reduced even de Barsac to
  silence and rendered him grave almost to the verge of timidity. Then they
  walked the rest of the distance in absolute silence, after which they lunched
  generously. But it was a quiet and moody meal, with each man avoiding the
  other's glance and each of them furtive and sinister. Then they proceeded in
  the direction of the chemist's shop, where Dorn purchased something which
  necessitated his signing the chemist's book, which he did in an assumed name,
  after which they turned their faces once more in the direction of Baron's
  Court. They reached the lodge gates at length, to find the big iron barriers
  opened and a couple of cars standing just inside. Besides these was a big
  trolley, heavily laden with all kinds of strange appliances. By the gate
  stood Garrass with a gun in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of all this?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"The people from London," Garrass explained in his curt way. "The people
  who take the photographs. They are going farther on in a day or two, but just
  at present some of them are in the park with their cameras."</p>

  <p>"Very lucid," de Barsac said. "And, by the way, Garrass, I have not heard
  you say as much before. You are becoming quite an orator. But what are you
  doing here with a gun in your hand?"</p>

  <p>"They have turned out one or two of the animals, sir," Garrass said.
  "Trying to get a photograph or two, I believe. My master was quite anxious
  for them to begin at once."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he would be," de Barsac said. "Like a child with a new toy, of
  course. I suppose you are keeping guard in case one of the beasts breaks
  away?"</p>

  <p>Garrass nodded and said no more. De Barsac and his companion turned away
  and walked up the avenue in the direction of the house. Before they reached
  the big portico they saw something move in a thicket a quarter of a mile or
  so away, and immediately afterwards a big puma slunk across the open and was
  lost to sight in a mass of undergrowth. Dorn glanced apprehensively over his
  shoulder and quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>"Is Bevill quite mad?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I believe he is at times," de Barsac said. "There is something of the
  comic opera about all this."</p>

  <p>"It is most infernally dangerous," Dorn said. "With all those servants
  about the house, and the men and boys in the gardens, it's criminal. Suppose
  anything happened, as it easily might?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter two-pence as long as nothing happens to us," de Barsac
  said lightly. "It's a confounded nuisance, all the same. Look, there goes the
  old man yonder, right across the opening with that ape of his by his side.
  He'll get killed himself some of these days. I believe he regards that savage
  beast of his as absolutely harmless."</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," Dorn muttered. "I don't like it a bit. Let's get
  inside; we shall be safe there."</p>

  <p>De Barsac smiled at the troubled expression on the face of his companion,
  but followed him all the same without further hesitation. They shut
  themselves in the studio, where they sat smoking and casually discussing
  their plans until through the window they could see Bevill, together with
  Frick and the rest of them, coming along the avenue in the direction of the
  house. Evidently the exciting adventures of the day were over, and obviously
  Bevill was in a state of pleasurable excitement, for he strode along at the
  head of the little procession with Vim equally delighted by his side.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose we shall have to humour him," de Barsac said. "But all
  this is exceedingly unpleasant for us. Upon my word, I've a great mind to
  throw the whole thing up altogether."</p>

  <p>"What's the use of talking like that?" Dorn asked. "You couldn't do it if
  you would. We shall have to see this thing through now, whatever happens.
  Just think what it means to go back. You could no more pay Lupas than you
  could turn one of those bronze statues of yours into life. And if you don't
  pay him he will prosecute you. And once that's done, you are of no more
  account than the meanest tramp on the road. I don't like even to hear you
  talk like that."</p>

  <p>De Barsac shrugged his shoulders as he rose to his feet and moved towards
  the door. At the same time he picked up a heavy object in bronze and placed
  it under his arm.</p>

  <p>"What have you got there?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's the cast for Gibson," de Barsac explained. "A fine piece of
  work, though I say it myself. It's complete in every detail, and you could
  put it on to the scale without finding it vary a hundredth part of an inch.
  Upon my word, Sir Watney ought to pay me for this."</p>

  <p>They drifted into the house presently for dinner, where they found the
  strange house party had been augmented by another guest, a tall thin man with
  an eager, enthusiastic face and a wonderful flow of words, who was introduced
  as Mr. Stafford Hatton, the popular novelist. The individual in question
  seemed to be thoroughly at home, which indeed he was, for he was eminently a
  Bohemian of the old-fashioned type and accepted all the gifts of the gods
  with a cheerful alacrity. He helped himself from time to time to the wines
  that went round the table and dilated at great length upon his work.</p>

  <p>"We are only at the beginning of it," he said. "The cinematograph,
  gentleman, is going to be one of the greatest educators. Of course, I know at
  present it is mainly used to extract coppers from the pockets of small
  children interested in the adventures of Deadwood Dick, and Hawkshaw the
  Detective, but that is so much pioneer work. It is only a toy at present, but
  then there are early stages, so were the wireless telegraph and the
  telephone. I have just been telling Mr. Bevill that we are going to make
  history here. It's a great pleasure to have so enlightened a gentleman and so
  liberal a patron to work with. But he will get his reward later on. Yes,
  thanks, I will have another glass of port."</p>

  <p>For a good hour or more Hatton talked on until at last the fountain of his
  eloquence seemed to dry up, and he settled himself down seriously to the
  decanter of port which he kept absent-mindedly by his elbow. With a smile and
  a shrug of his shoulders, Sir Watney Gibson glanced across the table in de
  Barsac's direction.</p>

  <p>"What have you got there?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's your model," de Barsac said. "And I am vain enough to be
  exceedingly proud of it. I should say that, on the whole, it is the best
  piece of work I ever did. Every hair and muscle and every nail is true to
  scale. Take it and put it by the side of Vim's paw, and you will be able to
  judge for yourself. Then tell me what you think of it."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney reached out for the heavy bronze object, and he proceeded to
  compare it with what he called the hand and forearm of the chimpanzee that
  was seated by his side. It was not altogether an easy job, for Vim appeared
  to be unusually restless and fractious for him, and not altogether too
  good-tempered. But Sir Watney finished at length, and broke out into loud
  praise at the excellence of the work. Markham, watching everything carefully
  as usual, noticed the sudden light that lit up Dorn's eyes and wondered what
  it meant. But he was to know all about that in good time.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; A STRANGE OUTBREAK.</h2>

  <p class="first">"What's the matter with Vim to-night?" de Barsac asked. "He has already
  broken two glasses and a dessert plate. What's the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Bevill said anxiously. "Ever since I came back he has been
  quite a different animal. He has been moody and restless, as if he were in
  some sort of pain. I have been wondering if his teeth want attending to. He
  was just like this two years ago when I had to have a special animal doctor
  down from London to see him, and he was of opinion that Vim was suffering
  from an abscess at the root of his teeth. And that really was the matter. It
  cost me no end of a lot of money to get a dentist to operate, but we managed
  it eventually, at the Zoological Gardens in London. And that was the cause of
  all the trouble. But for days afterwards the anaesthetic upset the poor
  beast, and he was positively dangerous for a time. Just like he was last year
  when he managed to get hold of a bottle of Benedictine and drank more than
  half of it before Garrass discovered what was going on. Garrass, you remember
  that, don't you? You recollect what a time we had?"</p>

  <p>Garrass, waiting solemnly and watchfully behind his master's chair
  inclined his head respectfully, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"And Vim is like that again to-day," Bevill went on. "Perhaps he has
  picked up something that doesn't agree with him. He was fairly quiet all the
  afternoon, though a bit excited when we were getting those cameras into
  position, but nothing noticeable. Did you see anything, Dorn, when Vim
  followed you into your bedroom just before dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," Dorn said carelessly.</p>

  <p>Just for the fraction of a second the speaker looked up in de Barsac's
  direction and caught his eyes. It was all done in a flash, but there was one
  person at the table who did not fail to notice it, and that was Markham. He
  had been sitting there, all through dinner hardly speaking a word, and
  watching everything that was going on. He would have been puzzled, perhaps,
  to say what was uppermost in his mind and what he was looking for, but it
  seemed to him that there was some mysterious influence in the air, some
  sinister undercurrent that centred in Dorn and de Barsac and radiated from
  them like an unseen wave. And all this rendered Markham anxious and uneasy
  and, at the same time, worried him all the more so, because he could not put
  his finger upon anything practical to go on. All he knew was that there were
  mysterious influences at work, and that they boded ill for the kindly,
  generous old man who sat there at the head of the table smilingly dispensing
  his own hospitality. And though Markham had confided his suspicions to Sir
  Watney Gibson, that usually astute individual appeared to have forgotten all
  about it, for he was laughing and talking with Dorn and de Barsac as if they
  had been friends for years. But then, Markham reflected, Sir Watney was a
  seasoned old man of the world, who never allowed his feelings to show
  themselves, which was a fact that had rendered him the terror of many a
  barrister who was defending a prisoner in a case where the great scientist
  was giving evidence on behalf of the Crown. In such cases Sir Watney had
  never been known to lose his temper, and therefore, perhaps on the present
  occasion he might be going out of his way to throw dust in the eyes of the
  two polished and gentlemanly scamps who sat facing him at the top of the
  table.</p>

  <p>The dinner came to an end at length, and the little party scattered, Dorn
  and de Barsac going off in the direction of the studio as usual, whilst Sir
  Watney and his host made their way to the library, leaving the rest to amuse
  themselves in the billiard-room. There Hatton flung himself down on a
  comfortable lounge and helped himself liberally from the whisky and soda that
  Garrass had deposited there. Frick shook his head benevolently at his
  literary friend, and suggested that in view of work on the morrow the casual
  Bohemian had better be careful.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Hatton said. "I always know when to leave off,
  especially when I have a story to write. I have got it all clear in my mind,
  and I shall probably work on it for the best part of the night."</p>

  <p>"How far have you gone?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh well, we have done practically nothing up to now," Frick said. "We
  were only trying a few experiments this afternoon, more to please Mr. Bevill
  than anything else. The man in charge of the cameras set up a couple of them
  to try the electric machinery, and I understand from what he says that he got
  one or two successful snaps of those pumas this afternoon, but that's all in
  the nature of elementary work. To-morrow we shall set up a travelling
  photographic studio with dark rooms and all the rest of it on that piece of
  waste ground just outside the gates, and then I hope we shall show you
  something good."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand," Markham said. "What's the idea? Are you going
  to drive those animal through the covers and take photographs of them as they
  go by, working cameras hidden in trees with some electric arrangement?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's not a bad rough way of putting it," Frick said. "Mind you, we
  didn't come down here originally with that intention at all. What we really
  have to do is to work out a big drama with a scene laid on Dartmoor, the
  centre of which is a dark and mysterious household&mdash;in other words,
  Lanton Place, which is an ideal household. We are going to have escaped
  convicts and prison warders and all that kind of thing, and a real big scene
  in the ruins of Lanton Place. But that's Hatton's job. When he has been over
  the ground and studied it he will be able to write up a story that few men
  could surpass. Meanwhile, during the fortnight or so when he is busy getting
  his local colour, we can fake up a series of splendid animal pictures for
  Hatton to write a story round later on. I don't quite know how it's going to
  be done yet, but of course there will be a hero and heroine. And, by the way,
  what a lovely heroine Miss Dorn will make."</p>

  <p>It was all exceedingly interesting, so interesting, indeed, that Markham,
  forgetting all his dark thoughts and suspicions, sat there, talking and
  asking questions for the best part of two hours, until the rest of the house
  had sunk into silence, and everybody appeared to have gone to bed. Frick was
  full of the most entertaining reminiscences, and Hatton, after resolutely
  putting the whisky and soda on one side, suddenly, became both an interesting
  and intellectual companion. The big clock in the hall was striking the hour
  of one before Markham rose reluctantly to his feet and suggested that it was
  time to go to bed. They were just putting the lights out and making a move in
  the direction of the hall, when suddenly from somewhere on the ground floor
  came an urgent cry for help.</p>

  <p>It was repeated three times in quick succession, each call more urgent
  than the last, and with it mingled strange snarls and cries that seem to have
  come from some infuriated animal. Markham put on the lights again, and,
  followed the other, dashed down the corridor in the direction of the library,
  from whence the cry proceeded. It was intensely dark there, and nothing could
  be seen, though assuredly enough there was some struggle going on in the dim
  recesses of the room. Markham put his head in through the door.</p>

  <p>"What's going on here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"The lights! For heaven's sake, put up the lights!" a panting voice broke
  out. "The switch is just inside the door. Don't hesitate, or I am done."</p>

  <p>With a strange feeling of horror upon him, Markham fumbled along the edge
  of the doorway until his hand came in contact with the switch and the whole
  of the big room was flooded with light. He saw Bevill, clad in nothing but
  his pyjamas, standing in a corner of the room, with the table in front of
  him. He had caught up one of the heavy chairs and was holding it above his
  head. A yard or two away, crouched on the floor as if ready for a spring, was
  Vim&mdash;Vim, changed out of all recognition. His eyes were gleaming with
  madness; he showed his teeth in a hideous grin. As Markham yelled, Vim
  dragged himself slowly to his feet and rubbed his paws across his eyes in a
  strange resemblance to a man who is waking from a nightmare. Then, all the
  murderous rage seemed to fall from him like a garment, and he flung himself
  forward on his face, whining piteously like a dog asking mercy from some
  angry master.</p>

  <p>Bevill came from behind the table, white and panting with his exertions,
  and laid his hand on the shoulder of the chimpanzee. Vim seemed to tremble at
  his touch.</p>

  <p>"Get up, boy," he said. "Get up, it's all right now. There, I'm not angry
  with you."</p>

  <p>Vim crawled to his master's feet and lay there, whimpering and crying in
  the fashion that was strangely human. There was something almost pathetic in
  his grief.</p>

  <p>"You came only just in time," Bevill said. "It was entirely my own fault.
  I ought to have known better. You could see for yourself at dinner-time that
  there was something wrong with the animal, probably the reason I assigned.
  When I went to bed an hour ago, I shut Vim in here as usual&mdash;he always
  sleeps on the couch in the corner there, you know. Then I said good-night to
  de Barsac and Dorn and we all went to bed. I had occasion to come down here a
  few moments ago to get a book I had forgotten, and, instead of slipping into
  some clothes, I ran down here in my pyjamas. Vim has never seen me in them
  before, and directly I came into the room he went for me. If he had killed
  me, it would have been no one's fault but my own. He rushed at me before I
  was able to turn the lights on, and I had just time to get behind that table.
  I am very sorry to cause you all this alarm, but it's all right now. You see
  how sorry the poor beast is. He can't do enough to express his penitence. It
  might have occurred to me that he would not know me; he has never seen me in
  a sleeping suit before. Oh, yes, it's all right."</p>

  <p>Bevill's last words were addressed to Dorn and de Barsac, who, disturbed
  by his cries, had come downstairs and were standing in the doorway listening
  to the explanation of the extraordinary scene that had taken place.</p>

  <p>"A lucky escape," de Barsac said. "Still, there's no reason why we should
  stay here."</p>

  <p>As he turned away Dorn laid a heavy hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Come to my room," he whispered. "I have got something to say to you.
  Everything seems to be going our way just now. We've got it in the hollow of
  our hands. A little bit of audacity on our part and we are rich men."</p>

  <p>"Lead the way," de Barsac said hoarsely.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; MRS. DORN'S DISCOVERY.</h2>

  <p class="first">John Bevill's enthusiastic expectations were not destined to be realised
  quite as soon as he had expected. There had been a great deal more to be done
  than Frick was aware, so, instead of a series of properly developed films
  showing the vagaries of the various animals in the park, nothing had
  materialised beyond an odd picture here and there, which, so Frick said, was
  largely due to the defects in the electrical arrangements. The cinematograph
  operators, on the other hand, declared that Frick had been in too much of a
  hurry, and that he was quite wrong in making all those extravagant promises.
  They could do nothing on a large scale, they said, with regard to animal
  pictures until they were in a position to use more power, and this, of
  course, they could get by accommodating their machinery to the dynamo that
  supplied Baron's Court with electric light. Once that was done, they had no
  doubt as to the result, but it would take a few days, and in the meantime,
  Mr. Bevill would have to possess himself in patience. The cameras were all
  there and the mechanical appliances in proper working order, but they must
  have more power. Then, with the aid of Bevill and his keepers, they hoped to
  do great things both by day and night in the park.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the majority of the company had begun to settle down in the
  neighbourhood of Lanton Place. There was fair enough accommodation for them
  in the adjacent farmhouses, where they were welcomed freely enough and
  subjected, of course, to hundreds of curious questions. Hatton had gone off
  on to the moors to study the locality day by day, with a view to the
  elaboration of what he called his scene plot. And on most of these occasions
  he was accompanied by Major Dorn, who had deemed it prudent to go back home
  again, and keep his eye upon the business side of the arrangement. Dorn had
  been largely influenced in this decision by the fact that de Barsac had been
  summoned in London for a week or to in connection with an important
  commission that was being freely discussed in the columns of the daily press.
  Once more de Barsac was in the limelight, and Dorn smiled cynically to
  himself as he read those florid paragraphs.</p>

  <p>For he knew only too well that there was something behind all this that
  the public little dreamt of. He knew how important it was that de Barsac's
  movements should be chronicled day by day, and how imperative it was, at the
  same time, that he himself should not be at Baron's Court just now. So he
  stayed quietly at Lanton Place, interested, or so he pretended, in Hatton's
  movements and keeping closely by the side of the latter day by day.</p>

  <p>And Sylvia was busy enough. There was always something to do in the
  outdoor studio which had been erected in the grounds of Lanton Place. There
  were odd photographs of interiors, little scenes of odds and ends which,
  sooner or later, would form a part of the big story, All this, of course, was
  done under the eyes of Frick, who was going back to Baron's Court at the end
  of the week with the intention of making good his promise to John Bevill. And
  so a busy fortnight passed.</p>

  <p>There were a good many hours in the day, of course, that Sylvia had
  entirely to herself, and Lionel Markham made the most of these. Most
  afternoons he cycled over to Lanton Place, taking care not to be there when
  Dorn was present, which was not a difficult matter, seeing that the weather
  was fine, and that Major Dorn spent the best part of the day on the moors in
  company with Stafford Hatton. It was lovely summer weather, too, so that
  there was no occasion to waste any time inside that gloomy old house.</p>

  <p>"Are you enjoying it?" Markham asked one afternoon as he and Sylvia sat on
  the edge of the moor amongst the heather. "Do you like the work?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear boy, if you were in my particular position you would like any
  work," Sylvia smiled. "It makes one forget. Of course it is trying, and the
  glare of those big electric lights goes to my head sometimes, but I am
  getting used to that. And, besides, I am earning quite a large income. Fancy
  me with fifteen pounds a week to spend! A little time ago I should have been
  pleased to have earned as many shillings. But, at any rate, it keeps us quite
  comfortably now."</p>

  <p>"And your father?" Markham suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he never dreams of troubling about us. He is getting more than I am,
  but not not penny of his money goes into the house. He said, as I was doing
  well and could not possibly spend anything down here, I might, if only as a
  duty, pay the household accounts out of my salary."</p>

  <p>"And you are doing so?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Lionel, I do so, if only for the sake of peace and quietness. I
  am grateful to have all these people round me&mdash;grateful to feel that I
  am living the life of an ordinary human being, and glad of the chance of
  getting away from the misery and desolation of it all. It's a bit monotonous
  at times, but then it is a good opening, and I think I shall stick to it. I
  ought not to grumble."</p>

  <p>"Stick to it always?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not? A beggar like myself can't pick and choose."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope it won't be for long," Markham said. "It won't be my fault
  if it is. For the time being, at any rate, I am entirely dependent upon the
  salary that my uncle pays me, but I on not going to be content with that. I
  have been promised something that will bring me in a good many hundreds a
  year, and when once that is settled I am going to take you away from Lanton
  Place altogether."</p>

  <p>"But my mother?" Sylvia said. "Oh, I couldn't possibly go away and leave
  her all alone."</p>

  <p>"Of course you couldn't. I wasn't going to suggest anything of the kind.
  She can come with us. We can have a nice little place on the outskirts of
  London, where you could look after her, and perhaps with a change of scene,
  away front this dreary spot, she may recover entirely. I think she would. I
  don't think you need trouble about your father. He will always contrive to
  get a living."</p>

  <p>And so they talked on there, in the golden sunshine, laying their plans
  for the future and thinking nothing about the morrow or what it was likely to
  bring forth. They parted presently, and Markham turned back in the direction
  of Baron's Court with his head in the air, dreaming dreams of the future.</p>

  <p>Some way down the road he came face to face with Henderby Lupas, who was
  plodding along the highway in the direction of Lanton Place. He favoured
  Markham with a scowl and a curt nod of recognition as he passed by.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that old rascal's still in the neighbourhood," Markham said to
  himself. "I wonder what mischief he is up to down here. I wonder if he is in
  any way connected with the mysterious things that are going on at Baron's
  Court. I'd like to know. By Jove, I will know."</p>

  <p>Acting on the impulse of the moment, Markham turned his cycle round and
  followed Lupas at a discreet distance. He saw the latter making inquiries at
  Lanton Place and then go off in the direction of the moor. A minute or two
  later and Sylvia came out of the house.</p>

  <p>"You are back again?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Markham explained. "I followed that man who has just been to your
  front door. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Only that his name is Lupas," Sylvia said. "He has been here twice
  before. I think he is one of my father's mysterious friends. A
  hateful-looking man. He wanted my father this afternoon in a great hurry, and
  has gone to look for him. I thought he was very much upset about
  something."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, never mind him," Markham said. "I only wanted to know. I happen
  to have met Lupas before, and I can tell you nothing to his credit."</p>

  <p>"Do come inside for a minute or two," Sylvia said. "My mother wants to
  speak to you. She has just come in out of the garden in a state of great
  excitement for her. Directly she did so she asked for you. It's a very
  strange thing since she has never mentioned your name since the very first
  day you came here. When I told her you had been and gone, she was greatly
  distressed. She wanted me to run after you and bring you back. It took me
  quite a time to explain that you came on a bicycle."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what she wants?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but I think she has found something. She had something that
  looked like an envelope in her hand. But do come and see her for a
  minute."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dorn sat in the dingy, melancholy dining-room with her face in her
  hands, gazing into space as if she were seeing some vision there, and ever
  and again glancing down at a stained and discoloured envelope that lay on her
  lap. Her sombre eyes lighted with something like intelligence as she caught
  sight of Markham. She held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"So you have come back again," she said vaguely. "You have come back just
  at the right time. Look at this. It's a letter written by your father to me
  twenty years ago. I should very much like you to read it."</p>

  <p>Markham took the dingy, half-blackened envelope in his hand and proceeded
  to read it. He saw a few curt business lines obviously written by a clerk
  acknowledging the receipt of a small locked black box and signed on behalf of
  a firm of private bankers with the signature "Richard Markham."</p>

  <p>"Where is that box?" Mrs. Dorn demanded. "In that box was Sylvia's
  fortune. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't tell you," Markham stammered. "But I can make
  inquiries. When my father died, his affairs were in the most extraordinary
  state of confusion. He never ought to have been a business man, he was never
  intended for a banker. I know that in a cottage belonging to me there are all
  sort of odds and ends of boxes and packages that were removed from the old
  home and possibly yours might be amongst them. But I should say not. This is
  an official letter from the bank, and the box would have been there, of
  course. And everything connected with the bank was wound up long ago. Do you
  mean to say that you sent my father a little black box?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dorn clasped her head wearily.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. "I don't know. It was clear enough a minute or
  two ago, and now it's all gone again."</p>

  <p>She dropped her head on her hands again, and Markham could not get her to
  speak another word.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; MISSING.</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile, Lupas tramped on in that dogged, obstinate way of his for a
  mile or two across the lonely moor in the direction which Dorn had gone,
  plodded on with his head hung down and his jaws moving, as if he were some
  bulldog with his teeth fixed to the throat of his enemy. He made a very
  sinister and forbidding object on the peaceful landscape as he trudged
  forward, until at length he came upon two figures seated by the roadside. One
  was Dorn, smoking a choice cigar, the other was Stafford Hatton inhaling his
  everlasting cigarettes and rattling on in that inconsequent way of his. He
  glanced up humorously at Lupas.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said. "'By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way
  comes.' Say, Major, is this cut-throat brigand looking for you or for
  me?"</p>

  <p>Dorn shrugged his shoulders resignedly.</p>

  <p>"For me, I am afraid," he said. "My dear fellow, that is a London
  money-lender called Lupas. Now, between two men of the world I don't mind
  telling you that I have had sundry dealings with him. And evidently he has
  come here looking for me&mdash;a most thoughtless thing to do on a lovely
  afternoon like this when all nature is smiling peacefully. So, if you don't
  mind, perhaps you will stroll on in the direction of Lanton Place and I'll
  overtake you presently."</p>

  <p>Dorn spoke lightly and frivolously enough, but inwardly he was feeling
  terribly uneasy as he noticed the thunder cloud on the features of Henderby
  Lupas. He knew that something must be wrong, indeed, to induce the town-bred
  money-lender to walk all this way on a blazing hot afternoon. Still, the
  matter had to be faced, and his smile was easy enough as he asked Lupas if
  anything was wrong.</p>

  <p>"Wrong?" Lupas snorted. "Everything is wrong. Now, you must listen to me.
  I have been over to Baron's Court to see if I could find de Barsac, and they
  tell me he has been in London for some days. Back late this evening, I
  believe. I suppose he has been keeping out of my way."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," Dorn retorted, with more heat than appeared to be
  necessary. "Nothing of the kind. De Barsac has a big commission which you can
  see for yourself if you read the paper. He had to go. But what's the use of
  all this? Tell me, what are you driving at?"</p>

  <p>Lupas sat down and produced a cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," he said. "On the strength of that will you and de
  Barsac managed to get hold of in some way I agreed to wait, and, what's more,
  I lent your friend a further sum of money."</p>

  <p>"Knowing the conditions, of course."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I thought I did. But, for once in my life, I was wrong. Now, I
  don't take any risks. I never knowingly took a risk in my life. It occurred
  to me after I had parted with that last lot of money that there might be
  trouble over that will. Mr. Bevill might have found out that it had been
  stolen or 'borrowed' or something of that kind, and in that case I wanted to
  know what he intended doing. If he found out anything, his suspicions would
  naturally be aroused. And after all, it's quite easy for a man to make a
  fresh will. It was up to me, therefore, to discover if the old gentleman
  intended to do anything of the sort, and I took steps accordingly. I found
  out the name of his solicitors, and in their employ is a clerk who owes me
  money. I have never pestered him for that money, because a clerk in the
  employ of a big firm of solicitors is often in a position to supply valuable
  information. Therefore, I put the screw on, and the man came to see me."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Dorn said anxiously. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm going on fast enough," Lupas said. "As I feared, John Bevill
  discovered his loss. From what I gather he is under the impression that a
  scapegrace nephew of his stole that paper. And therefore Mr. Bevill sent full
  instructions to his lawyers to draw up a new will. I have seen that will, all
  ready engrossed for signature. It isn't signed yet, but it may be at any
  moment, and this time it will not be kept in a flimsy safe. It will be
  retained in London."</p>

  <p>"And what's all this to do with me?" Dorn asked uneasily. "I suppose the
  will is practically a copy of the old one, in which case you have got nothing
  to worry about."</p>

  <p>"Quite wrong," Lupas said. "It isn't a bit like the old one. Every penny
  of the money is left in trust for a certain purpose, after which it goes to
  someone else. A girl, I think it is. Her name is not mentioned, but she is
  the only daughter of somebody or another who used to be on the stage. I
  didn't trouble much upon that point, because it makes no difference to me
  whatever. But what I did notice was that de Barsac's name was never
  mentioned. Whether the old man's suspicions are aroused or not I don't know,
  but it is quite clear to me that Bevill has changed his mind so far as de
  Barsac's legacy is concerned. If he dies to-night, de Barsac would not
  benefit by a penny. And I should be the poorer by over forty thousand pounds.
  And I am not the man to sit quietly down and be robbed of a sum of money like
  that. If this latter will is signed to-day or any time, we are all done. I am
  done. And I am not the man to be fooled in this fashion. Now, tell me
  straight out how you got hold of that document."</p>

  <p>Dorn hesitated and stammered, he prevaricated and lied, but gradually
  Lupas dragged the whole truth out of him. It was not a pleasant story, and
  sounded so serious that Lupas lost all trace of his anger.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have made a nice mess of it between you," he said. "Of course
  the old man's suspicions are aroused. He probably knows a great deal more
  about you and de Barsac than you think for. If you had told me this at first,
  de Barsac would never have got another penny out of me. I have a good mind to
  prosecute him for getting that money by false pretences. I had a great mind
  to go to Bevill and tell him everything. If I did, he might think he was
  under a moral obligation to repay me all I had lost. I should not have
  allowed de Barsac to have a penny if I had not been told about that
  legacy."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't do that?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, wouldn't I," Lupas snarled. "I wouldn't hesitate a moment. I am going
  to do something."</p>

  <p>"And suppose that new will is never signed?" Dorn almost whispered
  "Suppose something happened to Bevill?"</p>

  <p>Lupas looked up swiftly with a queer sinister light in those forbidding
  eyes of his.</p>

  <p>"Suppose nothing," he said. "I am not concerned with the sort of things
  that happen in sensational novels. Still, it's a practical proposition, and
  if the old man died before the new will was signed there is nothing more to
  be said. I should get my money in due course, and our interesting friend de
  Barsac will be able to congratulate himself upon a narrow escape from
  something like ten years' penal servitude."</p>

  <p>Dorn shuddered slightly. There was something almost grimly humorous in the
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Well, give us a day or two," he implored. "Don't do anything till the end
  of the week. You know how careless Bevill is. I happen to be aware of the
  fact that he is not likely to go to London for the next week or two, and I
  can't see how that will can be signed until he does so. The fact is, the old
  man's full of excitement over this new toy of his&mdash;the photographing of
  his animals in the wild state. You leave it to de Barsac and myself. I
  believe he is coming back to-night by a late train, and we can talk it over
  before we go to bed. I'll tell him exactly what you say."</p>

  <p>"You had better," Lupas said grimly. "And tell him that I am not going to
  stand any of his infernal nonsense. Here, this is what I am prepared to do.
  You had better 'find' that will. Trump up some story to the effect that you
  have found it in the grounds. De Barsac had better say he had the curiosity
  to read it. Then he can shed a few maudlin tears of gratitude over his own
  legacy, and tell the old man that he has been engaged in disastrous
  speculations and try and induce him to fork out the cash now. You know the
  sort of game I mean. Play on the old gentleman's feelings, snivel about ruin
  and disgrace, which, by George, will be true enough if nothing is done. There
  now, I have shown you a way out of the trouble, and I hope that de Barsac
  will be correspondingly grateful."</p>

  <p>An hour later and Dorn made his way slowly and thoughtfully up the avenue
  in the direction of Baron's Court. He had thought of an excuse for seeing
  John Bevill, who, however, was somewhere out in the grounds with Frick
  engaged in some new series of experiments, for the electric power had been
  installed and before dark it was hoped that some highly successful
  photographs would be taken. They would be all in presently to a late dinner,
  and if Major Dorn liked to stay, no doubt Mr. Bevill would be glad to see
  him.</p>

  <p>All this information Dorn learnt from the taciturn Garrass.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Garrass," he said. "I think I'll stay. I can amuse myself in
  the library with a book for an hour or two. And perhaps you will let Mr.
  Bevill know when he returns."</p>

  <p>Dorn sat there till the light began to fade, and one by one the people
  began to trickle in from the park. It was now past nine o'clock, and Bevill's
  hungry guests were wandering about the house, wondering whether or not it
  would be polite to sit down to the cold dinner set out in the dining-room
  before their host returned. They did sit down presently at the suggestion of
  Garrass, who said that his master had probably been detained and that he
  would be quite upset if his friends waited for him. He very often remained in
  his absent-minded way at the cottage with one of the keepers till quite late
  at night, and, indeed, on one occasion he had not come back at all.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps we had better go on," Frick said. "I hope the old gentleman
  isn't wandering about the park with all those animals loose. Our cameras will
  do their work without any attention now. And I don't mind confessing that I
  am faint for want of my dinner."</p>

  <p>The time drifted on till nearly eleven, when de Barsac put in an
  appearance, having come down by the last train, and motored over from
  Tavistock. Then the clock struck eleven and twelve without any sign of
  Bevill, and a moment or two later Garrass burst into the room.</p>

  <p>"My master is nowhere to be found," he said. "None of the keepers have
  seen him, neither has he been at the lodge. I am afraid that something
  serious has happened to him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; TRAGEDY!</h2>

  <p class="first">Markham jumped to his feet, the first of them there to understand that
  there was something serious. He knew, in the ordinary course of things, that
  Bevill's absence would have meant little or nothing. For instance, it would
  have been nothing strange for that eccentric old gentleman to go off in his
  absent-minded way to the bungalow and there remain for a day or two without
  advising his friends of his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>But this Markham felt by instinct was a different matter altogether. There
  was a chill foreboding at his heart and a strange coldness down his spine
  that seemed to tell of disaster. He glanced at the other men in the room,
  from Hatton and Frick, who were exchanging mystified looks, to Dorn and de
  Barsac, with a queer feeling, utterly illogical, perhaps, that these latter
  men could tell him a good deal if they pleased. He knew perfectly well that
  they were standing there, on the verge of catastrophe, and that something
  very sinister had happened to John Bevill.</p>

  <p>It was all absolutely illogical, of course, but there it was. He knew
  perfectly well that for the last few hours, at any rate, Dorn had been under
  his own eye, and that quite recently de Barsac had come off a railway
  journey.</p>

  <p>"What the matter?" Hatton asked. "Is there anything very wrong? I thought
  it was quite usual for the old gentleman to wander all about the place by
  himself."</p>

  <p>"That's quite correct," Markham said. "But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There he stopped, breaking off abruptly, conscious, perhaps, that he was
  taking too much upon himself, and that it would be much wiser to leave matter
  to de Barsac, who, to all practical purposes, was his host. He turned to the
  latter.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to do something?" he asked. "Surely it is in your
  hands."</p>

  <p>De Barsac shrugged his shoulders. He was perhaps, on the whole, the
  coolest of the company. Markham could see that his hand was perfectly steady
  as he pulled at his cigar. His eyes were indifferent, and his features serene
  enough. Just at that moment Markham's chief regret lay in the fact that Sir
  Watney Gibson was no longer in the house. He felt just then in sore need of
  counsel.</p>

  <p>"Really," de Barsac said, "I don't see any occasion for all this fuss.
  Garrass, how many times has your master gone away like this without saying a
  word to anyone?"</p>

  <p>"A good many, sir," Garrass admitted. "But never before have we opened the
  cages of those animals for the experiments of those gentlemen here."</p>

  <p>"But they are not wandering about now?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"I think not, sir. There may be one or two, but the keepers hope to have
  them all in by nine o'clock. They will be sure to come back for their
  food."</p>

  <p>"Then in that case, I don't see the least cause to worry," de Barsac said.
  "I daresay Bevill is wandering about in the moonlight, too deeply interested
  in some scientific problem to come home. Oh, he'll turn up in the morning all
  right. If we go out hunting him he won't like it. Besides, I suppose he has
  got the faithful ape with him, hasn't he Garrass?"</p>

  <p>"That is so, sir," Garrass said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, in that case, I think I shall go to bed," de Barsac said. "I
  have no anxiety."</p>

  <p>"I don't take the same view of it at all," Markham said coldly. "Suppose
  something has happened? There is certain to be an inquiry afterwards, and if
  so, what will people say when they know that we all went coolly to bed whilst
  the master of Baron's Court was missing? Come along, Garrass, we'll go at any
  rate and have a look round."</p>

  <p>"You can count me in, too," Frick said.</p>

  <p>As Frick spoke he rose and, followed by Hatton, made his way in the
  direction of the door. De Barsac shrugged his shoulders cynically and glanced
  in Dorn's direction. It was as if the latter, too, had good humouredly made
  up their minds to humour a piece of folly on the part of their
  companions.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect moonlight night, warm and dry, so that there was no
  occasion for any change of clothing before the little party set out on their
  errand. For the best part of two hours they searched the woods and thickets
  in the park until it began to dawn upon them that they were looking in the
  wrong direction. They came, presently, to a little clump of trees sheltering
  a spring right in the heart of the park, and in the gloom something seemed to
  stand out like a patch of huddled black and white on the edge of the water.
  With a little cry, Garrass darted forward and bent down.</p>

  <p>"My master," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>It was even as he said. John Bevill lay there as if he had fallen placidly
  asleep. His white still face was turned up to the sky, his dress was not in
  the least disarranged, and those benevolent features of his were singularly
  peaceful.</p>

  <p>He was quite dead; evidently he had been dead for hours. From his
  appearance he might have sat down there to rest, and had died tranquilly in
  his sleep. They lifted him from where he lay, and carried him out in the
  open.</p>

  <p>"This is a ghastly business," de Barsac said. "A terrible business.
  Garrass, run as far as the keeper's cottage and tell him to come along with a
  hurdle. We must get our poor friend to the house as soon as possible. I am
  very sorry, Markham. We were wrong, and you were entirely right. We ought to
  have come here at once. Not that it made any difference. As far as I can see,
  Bevill must have died as he was crossing the park. A peaceful death, and one
  that he would have asked for himself. I can't see any signs of violence."</p>

  <p>Markham said nothing. For the moment, at any rate, he was too overcome
  with the weight of the discovery. From the start he had expected something of
  this kind, but in quite another form. He had feared violence or foul play,
  but so far as he could judge there was no suggestion of either. The full
  light of the moon shone down on the dead man's face, a face that was
  singularly calm and placid. There was no suggestion anywhere of a struggle,
  the clothing was not disarranged, and there was not so much as a scratch on
  those pallid features. It was tragedy, dreaded and feared, but it had come in
  such a strange and unexpected form, that, for the moment, at any rate,
  Markham could make nothing of it. He drew back partly in the shadow and
  waited without another word till Garrass returned with one of the keepers,
  and then the little procession moved silently across the park in the
  direction of the house. They carried Bevill up to his bedroom and left him
  there.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be done till the morning, as far as I can see," de
  Barsac said. "I don't even see the sense of waking Nurse Coterell up. It will
  be time enough to tell her in the morning. Garrass, you had better telephone
  to the police at Tavistock and tell them what has happened. You had better
  say that so far as we can judge there is nothing wrong, and that your master
  was found dead in the park a few minutes ago, obviously from natural causes.
  If the police like to send over here now, they can, but there is no reason
  why they should not wait till morning. If they decide to come at once I will
  sit up and wait for them."</p>

  <p>Garrass came back a moment or two later with the information that a
  superintendent of police was already on his way to Baron's Court, and would
  be there within half an hour. De Barsac appeared to listen rather
  wearily.</p>

  <p>"Well, after all, it is for them to decide," he said. "Garrass, there is
  no reason why we should keep you up any longer. The same remark applies to
  you other gentleman."</p>

  <p>Markham, however, had disappeared, and a few moments later was followed
  upstairs by Hatton and Frick, leaving the other two facing each other in the
  dining-room. Dorn walked over to the sideboard and helped himself liberally
  to a whisky and soda. His face was very pale and his hands were trembling. He
  half irresolutely took a cigar from a box, then, changing his mind, lighted a
  cigarette instead.</p>

  <p>"I think I will follow your example," de Barsac said. "Pour me out a
  drink, will you? A little more, please. This is a shocking business,
  Dorn."</p>

  <p>"It is," Dorn agreed. "A ghastly business. Of course, being a soldier, I
  know something about these things; but when I saw the poor old man lying dead
  there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dorn broke off abruptly, swallowed his drink at one gulp and filled up his
  glass again.</p>

  <p>"Well, it can't be helped," he went on more firmly. "After all, Bevill was
  an old man, and never very strong, I should say. Heart disease probably.
  Really, when you come to think of it, the most merciful of all deaths. And,
  to be quite cynical, a piece of luck for you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't contradict you," de Barsac said. "And besides&mdash;but we
  need not discuss that. The old man was a good friend to me, and in many ways
  I am sorry. But on the other hand, considering my position&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah," Dorn said. "You don't know yet what a narrow shave you had. Another
  day or two and it would have been too late. Perhaps I had better tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"Well, it would be as well, perhaps."</p>

  <p>Dorn carefully closed the door, having first ascertained that the house
  was quiet, and then, in low tones, proceeded to tell de Barsac the story of
  his interview with Henderby Lupas. It was a story that de Barsac appeared to
  find interesting, for he never spoke until Dorn had finished.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, that was a close call," he said. "It will be a lesson to me in
  future."</p>

  <p>"Not it," Darn said contemptuously. "You always will be reckless and
  headstrong. Now, what would have happened if John Bevill had lived?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you," de Barsac, whispered. "I should have lost
  everything. I didn't like to tell you, but the night before I went to town
  Bevill told me that he had changed his mind in regard to my legacy, and that
  he intended leaving me nothing. His idea was that I didn't need it, and as he
  had lost money himself lately, he was going to make another will. Good Lord,
  if he had only known the truth!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; THE FIRST DAY OF THE INQUEST.</h2>

  <p class="first">Dorn wiped the beads from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not tell me that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, what's the good? It would only have upset you. You are
  very clever and very cunning, and in connection with some infernally subtle
  plot you have no superior. But you certainly lack personal courage. Yours is
  not the hand to put the finishing touch, and if I had told you, you would
  probably have been frightened. Well, I didn't tell you, and for the last few
  nights you have slept all the better for it. As far as I can gather Bevill
  has been speculating himself, and losing his money. I don't say he has lost
  all, or anything like it, but his idea was to leave Baron's Court to the
  nation as a sort of college for natural research, and endow it with the best
  part of his fortune. He had an idea of leaving a good many thousands to some
  friend of his, though he didn't say who, and that money was the legacy that
  ought to have come to me. He went on to say that as I was a rich man I could
  not possibly want it, and&mdash;well, you can imagine the absolute rubbish he
  talked. If he had lived, I should have been at Lupas' mercy. Now I shall be
  able to pay that old rascal and get out of his power. It will leave me
  absolutely penniless, but that's a minor consideration."</p>

  <p>"It certainly ought to be with a man who can make money as easily as you
  do," Dorn said. "However, the danger is past and you are free&mdash;till the
  next time. Now, I suppose you see what you've got to do?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. First of all, put that will back where you found it. Lupas must
  let us have it back for the purpose. He can't well refuse. He knows that it
  is to our interest not to destroy it or play the fool in any way; he knows
  that directly the will is proved he gets his money."</p>

  <p>"That's clear enough," Dorn said. "I'll run over and see Lupas directly
  after breakfast. It's not altogether as easy as you think. There are
  difficulties in the way."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got to get that paper back in the safe again. And after
  what's happened, it won't be so easy. Now, for Heaven's sake don't go into
  this thing as if it were of no importance. I thought it all out before I came
  here this afternoon. Now, my idea is this. There will be an inquest this
  morning, probably a purely formal affair, and a good many questions will be
  asked. All sorts of questions about Bevill's private affairs. Somebody ought
  to make a preliminary examination of the papers. I suggest that you telephone
  to Bevill's local solicitor in Tavistock. Let's have him over here early and
  get him to go through the safe. You can help him, or we both can, for that
  matter. Then we can shove that will into a draft envelope and put it in under
  the lawyer's nose so that he can't overlook it. And when he has found it, you
  can make some remark upon Bevill's absent-mindedness and tell the solicitor
  that the will was in the safe all the time and that all the fuss Bevill made
  the other night was totally unnecessary. Now, I dare say you may think that
  all this is unnecessary fussing. But I don't think so. You never know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," de Barsac said. "All right. Have it your own way. At any
  rate, we can shake hands upon a fine get out from a tight place. And now,
  don't you think we had better turn in?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what about the police?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>"Confound it, I had forgotten all about that," de Barsac said. "You go to
  bed and leave them to me."</p>

  <p>It was shortly after nine o'clock the following morning before the
  superintendent of police came for the second time with information to the
  effect that the inquest would be held at twelve o'clock, when the coroner
  would attend Baron's Court for that purpose. After a hasty breakfast de
  Barsac got the local solicitor on the telephone and invited him to come over
  without delay. He arrived in due course, a fussy little self-important man
  who appeared to be duly impressed with the solemnity of the occasion.</p>

  <p>"My name is Grant, Mr. de Barsac," he said. "I think we have met before.
  You were quite right in sending for me. I have never been entrusted with the
  administration of the late Mr. Bevill's London property from whence he
  derives a great part of his income, but apart from that I have enjoyed his
  confidence for years. Amongst other things, I made his will."</p>

  <p>"So he told me," de Barsac lied boldly. Here was the very opening he
  needed. "So he told me. Now, Mr. Grant, you will be betraying no secret if
  you tell me that under that will I benefit to a considerable amount. Not that
  I particularly need money&mdash;a man in my position wouldn't&mdash;but, of
  course, I value the gift as an expression of good will from a dear old
  friend. Now, is that will in your possession?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't," Grant said. "It ought to be, of course. It is the bounden duty
  of all testators to leave their wills in the hands of their solicitors. Such
  a course saves a great deal of trouble. You see, wills get mislaid. But I
  need not go into that. For some reason Mr. Bevill preferred to keep his will
  himself, and the last time I discussed the matter with him he told me that
  the document was in his safe."</p>

  <p>"It certainly was," de Barsac said. "I know that because I saw it there
  myself. But a few nights ago there was an attempt at burglary, and after the
  rascals were driven off Mr. Bevill declared that his will had been stolen. I
  don't think so myself; I don't think that anybody would be such a fool as to
  run the risk for the sake of a document that can be replaced at any moment. I
  don't want to stir up any scandal, but Mr. Bevill had a certain scamp of a
  nephew."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Yes," Grant said. "I know all about that. Now, what is your theory,
  Mr. de Barsac?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my theory is that the will is in the safe all the time," de Barsac
  replied. "In his absent-minded way John Bevill probably put the document in a
  different pigeon hole from the one he intended. I found the key of the safe a
  few minutes ago and here it is. Now, I want you to make a professional
  examination of those papers."</p>

  <p>De Barsac talked easily for some little time. As a matter of fact, he was
  putting the lawyer off till Dorn returned from his visit to Lupas. Nothing
  could be done until Dorn came back with that precious document. And
  presently, with a little sigh of relief, de Barsac saw his confederate stroll
  along the terrace in front of the library window. As he passed he paused to
  light a cigarette and significantly tapped his breast pocket. It was the
  signal agreed upon, and a few minutes later the safe was opened and the
  missing will found in a draft envelope, where it had been placed by Dorn
  ready to be pushed on to the lawyer, much as a conjurer forces a card upon
  one of his audience. Grant held it up triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"There you are, Mr. de Barsac," he said. "You were evidently quite right.
  It only proves what I said just now that no client ought to have charge of
  his own will. I think that I had better take care of this."</p>

  <p>"Of course," de Barsac agreed. "You'll have to prove it and all that sort
  of thing, won't you? Though of course, I suppose in the circumstances it will
  be quite a long time before the estate is administered. Now, what do you say
  to a sandwich and a glass of sherry before the coroner comes?"</p>

  <p>Dorn and de Barsac left the little lawyer to his refreshments, whilst they
  paced up and down the terrace discussing matters in confidential
  whispers.</p>

  <p>"Well?" de Barsac asked. "And how did you find Lupas? Was he
  reasonable?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, about as amiable as usual," Dorn said. "I don't think he would have
  believed that Bevill was dead if he had had to take my word for it. But,
  fortunately for us, he had heard the news before. When I told him what I
  wanted, he was quite reasonable enough. Indeed, he seemed to be rather sorry
  that he had ever handled the thing at all. He's going back to town this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Oh, really? Rather sudden, isn't it? That old fox doesn't want to be
  identified with us any more than he can help. Well, I don't blame him."</p>

  <p>They talked on there in undertones, till at length the coroner made his
  appearance, followed by the jury and one or two curious neighbours, and an
  odd representative of the press who had already learnt something of the
  tragedy. The inquest took place in the library, and after a few words to the
  jury from the coroner the proceedings commenced.</p>

  <p>From the first it was quite evident that this was only a preliminary
  inquiry. The police had only had the matter in hand a few hours, and though,
  so far, there were no suspicious circumstances it was possible that the case
  might not be quite as simple as it looked.</p>

  <p>Garrass was the first witness. He told how he had found the body of his
  late master lying in the park; he spoke of Mr. Bevill's peculiar habits, and
  how it was no new thing for him to be out at all hours of the day and night
  either by himself or accompanied by his faithful chimpanzee.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it rather strange," Markham whispered to Frick, who sat by his
  side, "that nothing should have been seen of Vim the last few hours? I knew
  he went out with his master last night&mdash;in fact, he was with him all
  day. And I don't think anyone has seen him since."</p>

  <p>"It is a funny thing," Frick said. "It makes one wonder. Look here,
  Hatton, you heard what Mr. Markham said. There is a plot for you. The dead
  man and the missing ape."</p>

  <p>Hatton nodded and made a note on a sheet of paper. Then they lapsed into
  silence again and the dreary proceedings went on. Garrass finished at length
  and after him other witnesses were called. Then the superintendent of police
  took a hand. He hadn't got much to say, except that he proposed only to call
  the police surgeon that morning, and afterwards apply for an adjournment for
  a day or two. The police doctor came forward. He had made a careful
  examination of the body, he said, and, as a result, he had come to certain
  conclusions. When asked by the coroner what his conclusions were, the
  superintendent of police jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I think, sir," he said, "that any technical questions had better be
  postponed."</p>

  <p>"In that case," the coroner replied, "the court stands adjourned till this
  day week at the same time."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; A BLOW FOR DE BARSAC.</h2>

  <p class="first">Naturally enough, the tragedy at Baron's Court attracted a good deal of
  attention, not only locally, but throughout the West of England. Then,
  gradually the conviction began to spread that there was something behind the
  mystery that had to be explained. On the face of it there was no ground for
  this theory that did not prevent people talking, especially in the
  neighbourhood of Tavistock. And, strangely enough, one of the reasons given
  for a suggestion that something was radically wrong was that John Bevill's
  pet chimpanzee was not to be found. And, as a matter of facts, Vim had
  disappeared, leaving no trace behind him. He was known to have accompanied
  his master the whole of the afternoon and evening on the day of his death,
  and, indeed, he had been seen in close attendance on John Bevill as late as
  nine o'clock on the evening of the tragedy.</p>

  <p>And, in some extraordinary way, the story of Vim's attack upon his master
  a fortnight or so ago had become public property. People whispered that on a
  certain occasion there had been something like a conflict between the man and
  the monkey, and that, at another time, the chimpanzee had made a violent
  attack upon Bevill in the dead of the night. Who started these reports and
  whence they came, no one seemed to know, but they were freely discussed, and
  there were hundreds of people firmly under the impression that the eccentric
  old scientist had met his death at the hands of his strange pet. It was
  pointed out that Vim was a big animal, possessed of extraordinary strength,
  and quite capable of killing a man with the greatest ease. So that therefore,
  in the course of a day or two, most people in that part of the country were
  ready to declare that this was what had happened, and that in the course of
  subsequent investigations the truth would be made clear. Meanwhile, there was
  nothing to do but to await till the adjourned inquest.</p>

  <p>Life at Baron's Court was going on much about the same. It was not time
  yet for Bevill's next-of-kin to take possession, and seeing that nearly every
  member of the household would be asked to give his evidence, things were
  going on in the ordinary routine with de Barsac as nominal host. He was
  amiable enough to everybody. He showed no disposition to get rid of certain
  people there who had nothing in sympathy with him. He played the host easily
  and naturally, and seemed to go out of his way to make everybody at home.
  And, when de Barsac liked, his manners were absolutely perfect.</p>

  <p>There was one member of the household who listened coldly enough to these
  blandishments, and that was Lionel Markham. He lost no time in writing a
  detailed account of what had happened to Sir Watney Gibson, and invited the
  latter to come over to Baron's Court as soon as possible. And this being
  done, and a favourable reply received, Markham set himself down to watch the
  course of events.</p>

  <p>Dorn still lingered on, apparently more for the sake of the companionship
  for de Barsac than anything else, and Markham noticed that these two were
  seldom together unless it was late at night or early in the morning. Then, on
  the third day, they went off on some errand, and Markham decided to follow
  them. He would have been at some pains to say why&mdash;an instinct, perhaps;
  but he kept carefully out of sight and traced them across the moor, until he
  saw them meet someone whom he recognised as Henderby Lupas. It was an open
  spot, where it was impossible to overhear or even see much that was going on
  without being detected, so therefore Markham retraced his footsteps,
  wondering what the meaning of this secret conclave meant, and carefully
  making a note of what he had seen.</p>

  <p>He had noted that during breakfast both Dorn and de Barsac appeared to be
  preoccupied and uneasy in their minds, but, for the moment, he had to content
  himself with that knowledge, and make his way thoughtfully back to Baron's
  Court.</p>

  <p>The cause of all the trouble, however, was in a short curt note that had
  arrived by post that morning from Henderby Lupas demanding de Barsac's
  presence at a given rendezvous as soon after ten o'clock as possible. There
  was something so menacing in this request that de Barsac decided to obey it
  without delay, and, as a matter of precaution, took Dorn with him. They found
  Lupas awaiting them, and if Markham had gone a little farther he would have
  noticed a little two-seater car without a driver standing amongst the
  heather. It was in this that Lupas had come down from London, quite alone,
  and the fact, by itself, did not tend to reassure de Barsac and his
  companion. It seemed to him that there must be something wrong indeed.</p>

  <p>"Well, here we are," he said cheerfully. "And now, what's the matter? Upon
  my word, Lupas, anyone would think that I had nothing else to do except run
  after you."</p>

  <p>"You will run after me just when and where I please," Lupas growled. "You
  don't suppose I have come down from London all the way by myself for the mere
  pleasure of seeing you two. Here I am, neglecting important business and
  pottering about the country as if I had nothing else to do. I started in the
  car yesterday morning, and it has taken me nearly all my time to get here.
  And I came alone, too."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes why?" de Barsac echoed. "You can afford to come down in style if you
  like. I know you have got a big luxurious car and a competent chauffeur."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've got all that, of course," Lupas said, "but I didn't want anybody
  to know where I was going, and I didn't want anybody to know I was going to
  meet you men."</p>

  <p>"Still more mysteries," de Barsac smiled.</p>

  <p>"I never take any risks. I suppose it's no use asking you what happened to
  Bevill?"</p>

  <p>"Really, I must resent that tone of yours," de Barsac said. "Anybody who
  heard you talk might think that there was something underhanded about my poor
  friend's death."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, thousands do," Lupas snorted. "And I don't mind
  telling you I am one of them. But let that pass. I have no doubt the truth
  will come out in time."</p>

  <p>"The truth is out now," Dorn said soothingly. "There's no mystery. Mr.
  Bevill died suddenly, probably of heart disease. He was picked up dead in the
  park&mdash;in fact, we were both present at the time. He lay there like one
  asleep. There were no signs of violence anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was a very good thing for de Barsac," Lupas interrupted. "Some
  people have all the luck. But in this particular instance the luck is out.
  And that's what brings me down here. What happened over that will?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we managed to get it back in the safe all right," Dorn laughed. "It
  was easily done. We had a fool of a local lawyer to deal with, and we so
  contrived it that the fellow found the will himself. And it is in his hands
  at the present moment, so I suppose before long de Barsac will get his money,
  and, of course, you will be paid."</p>

  <p>Lupas laughed, a queer silent sort of laugh that seemed to come from the
  bottom of his chest. He turned those malignant eyes of his upon the other two
  men and smiled in a way that aroused all de Barsac's fears.</p>

  <p>"Oh, stop that, confound you!" he said irritably. "If you have got
  anything to say, say it."</p>

  <p>"You won't he pleased," Lupas sneered. "Like other men of your type, you
  have been too clever. If you had only left that will alone, everything would
  have been all right."</p>

  <p>"But you would see it," Dorn said.</p>

  <p>"I know that," Lupas admitted. "And I am sorry now that I didn't wait a
  bit. Because it's like this. When Bevill found he had been robbed, he made up
  his mind that his nephew was the culprit. And that being so, he acted in a
  business-like manner for once in his life and instructed his lawyers in
  London to draw up a new will. And this was done."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we know that," Dorn said impatiently. "You told me so yourself. You
  had even seen it. But now that document must be so much waste-paper."</p>

  <p>"And consequently the old will stands," Lupas sneered. "All very nice and
  pleasant for de Barsac, but it's not the fact. The new will was signed."</p>

  <p>De Barsac dropped his cigar in the heather and swore aloud. His swarthy
  features had grown strangely pale and he was trembling from head to foot,
  like some nerveless coward in the presence of some great danger. It seemed
  extraordinary that a man of his sanguine temperament and easy-going
  disposition should have been so deeply affected by an incident that hurt
  Lupas more than it injured him.</p>

  <p>"It's a lie," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"It's no lie," Lupas responded. "It's true enough. You blundered terribly.
  You ought never to have removed that paper from the safe; or, at any rate,
  you ought to have restored it in such a way as to blind John Bevill to what
  was going on. But it's no use crying about spilt milk. I tell you that the
  new will was signed at Tavistock three days before Bevill's death. He would
  have delayed the matter, only those London lawyers were persistent. Perhaps
  they saw the danger. At any rate, they sent one of their confidential clerks
  down to Tavistock with the will, and Mr. Bevill went over there and signed
  it. That document is now locked up in London, and in due course will be
  proved. I know what I am talking about, because the clerk I mentioned to you
  gave me all the information. He even supplied me with a draft copy of the
  will. And now perhaps you understand why I came down here. I have my own good
  reasons for not wishing to be seen with either of you, and if you can't draw
  your own conclusions from that remark you are both bigger fools than I take
  you to be. But that is not the point. What I want to know is what you are
  going to do about it. It's merely a question of money with me. Where am I
  going to get it from?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," de Barsac muttered. "Do you mean to say that my name isn't
  mentioned in that new will?"</p>

  <p>"I do," Lupas said curtly. "And what's more, the money originally meant
  for you has gone to somebody else. It was evidently one of the old man's
  impulsive ideas, for he left that forty thousand pounds to a girl friend of
  his for whom he appears to have been sorry. It is a bequest to her in
  recognition of her courage and honesty in circumstances that were exceedingly
  trying. Quite romantic, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Anybody that we know?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly," Lupas said drily. "The lucky beneficiary is Miss Sylvia
  Dorn, of Lanton Place."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; MORE LIGHT.</h2>

  <p class="first">Lupas threw out this bombshell with characteristic malice and mocking
  laughter in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite a romance, isn't it?" he said. "Fancy that dear old gentleman
  leaving all that money to the daughter of one of the biggest scoundrels in
  Devon! I wonder if he knew you, Dorn. Some of these quiet, placid men are
  very shrewd under their mild exteriors."</p>

  <p>Dorn said nothing. He was too amazed by this extraordinary revelation, and
  besides, that nimble mind of his was already engaged in speculating as to how
  he could turn this information to his personal advantage. Lupas, watching him
  narrowly, seemed to follow what was passing in his mind.</p>

  <p>"I thought I should astonish you," he said. "And I hope you will be
  correspondingly grateful for the information. It's an ill wind that blows
  nobody any luck. Fancy a pretty little scheme to put money in the hands of
  two scoundrels&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Three," de Barsac said. "Three."</p>

  <p>Lupas smiled, quite untouched.</p>

  <p>"Very well, three if you like," he said. "And after all said and done, it
  was my money you were scheming for. Still, there you are. You go to all this
  trouble over a certain sum of money, and the sole result is to throw the
  proceeds into the lap of a young girl who never expected a penny of it. I am
  quite convinced in my own mind that, if you hadn't bungled over the old man's
  safe, it would never have occurred to him to have altered his will at all.
  And now a word in your ear, Dorn. You know this, but you can't use your
  information yet. You can't tell your daughter a fact that probably will not
  be communicated to her for weeks. If you do, all sorts of awkward question
  will be asked. You will probably be required to say where you got your
  information from. And now, de Barsac, what are you going to do? I have come
  down here at a great inconvenience to myself and some risk, if you only knew
  it, because I could not well write you all this. What are you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"For the life of me, I don't know," de Barsac said. "I must have time to
  turn round."</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a week," Lupas said. "And if something substantial is not
  paid on account by that time I shall move. If I lose my money, I'll get even
  some way. And don't say I haven't warned you."</p>

  <p>With which Lupas rose and went off in the direction of his car without
  another word. He drove across the moor in the direction of Tavistock, leaving
  the two conspirators facing one another with blank looks and uneasy glances.
  They stood thus for a time in absolute silence. Then something in a clump of
  heather stirred and a queer caricature of a human face in a fringe of
  red-brown hair looked out.</p>

  <p>"By heavens, it's Vim!" Dorn cried.</p>

  <p>It was even as he said&mdash;Vim, ragged and unkempt, covered with dry mud
  and dust, and without any vestige of his usual neat apparel. As he caught
  sight of the two men there his eyes concentrated vengefully, and he showed
  his teeth in a chattering grin. Just for a moment it looked as if he was
  about to attack the two unarmed men, and it would have gone hard for them if
  he had. But then something changed in that queer, half-human mind of his, and
  with a strange melancholy cry Vim turned his back upon them and set off with
  incredible speed across the moor until he was lost to sight.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's get back," de Barsac said. "This is a real morning of horrors.
  And yet a few hours ago everything seemed to be just plain sailing. Dorn,
  what on earth possessed that old fool to leave your daughter that money?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven only knows," Dorn said moodily. "Pure luck, I suppose. You know
  how Sylvia met Bevill, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you told me that, of course."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all I know about it. I dare say the old man found out
  something of the truth, and no doubt he was impressed by the girl's
  resolution and courage. Besides, Sylvia is an unusually attractive girl, and
  old men are proverbially not blind to such things. However, there it is, and
  we have got to make the best of it."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering," de Barsac said. "Being a mere girl, perhaps your
  daughter might not object&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, wouldn't she," Dorn said. "There's not a more obstinate girl in
  England. If you think it would be any use for me to come the fond parent with
  Sylvia, you are mistaken. To be brutally cynical, she knows me."</p>

  <p>"She knows a good deal, then," de Barsac sneered.</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate, she knows quite enough not to trust me with a penny.
  You don't know what she's like when she's roused. I shall get nothing out of
  her. I know exactly what she'll do. She'll take her mother away and defy me.
  She might, if the worse came to the worst, offer me a pound or two a week to
  go and live somewhere else. Ah, if I'd have only known this was coming! But I
  didn't, and there's an end of it."</p>

  <p>With this sort of talk the two discomfited scoundrels made their way back
  to Baron's Court just in time to see Sir Watney Gibson drive up to the house.
  They avoided him for the moment, for they were in no mood for the ordinary
  conventions of life, but the circumstance was disturbing. They proceeded to
  lunch by themselves, and then, as usual, shut themselves up in the studio,
  whilst Sir Watney and his nephew paced up and down the terrace discussing
  recent events in confidential tones.</p>

  <p>"Now, tell me, my boy," Sir Watney said, "exactly what you asked me to
  come down here for. I am amazingly busy just now, though I should have come
  down for the funeral next Monday, of course. You were very guarded in your
  letter, so guarded, indeed, that I seemed to read between the lines. I
  suppose that's why you asked me to come."</p>

  <p>"That's right," Markham said. "I thought you ought to be here. And yet, if
  you ask me why, I couldn't tell you. I am uneasy in my mind; I cannot rid
  myself of the impression that John Bevill is the victim of foul play."</p>

  <p>"But there were no signs of violence."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I grant you that," Markham went on. "There are no signs of violence
  anywhere. The poor old gentleman lay there as calm and placid as if he had
  died in his sleep. So far, the police surgeon has only made a casual
  inspection of the body, but I rather fancy he knows something, because the
  inquest was adjourned so hurriedly just as he had begun his evidence. Now,
  that was one strange thing. Another thing equally sinister is that Vim has
  disappeared. Now, why should the chimpanzee go off and hide himself in this
  way? He was with his master all that evening in the park; he was seen with
  Mr. Bevill just before dark, when they were apparently on the best of
  terms."</p>

  <p>"Just one moment," Sir Watney said. "Don't forget that Vim tried to attack
  his master on two occasions. And don't forget that he has had outbursts
  before, particularly when he had the opportunity of indulging in his
  favourite liqueurs. I always told Bevill that he would have trouble with Vim
  some of these days. Now, is it possible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't think so," Markham went on. "I know that the chimpanzee
  occasionally kicked over the traces, but he loved Bevill as two brothers
  might love one another. And he was brought up here from quite a small ape
  till the time he grew up. He might have attacked his master in a moment of
  ungovernable rage, but if he had done so with his enormous strength he would
  have torn Bevill to pieces. He could not have helped it. The body would have
  been fearfully mangled, of course. Now, my theory is that Vim saw something
  happen to his master, and either came to the spot too late, or was frightened
  to interfere. He might reason in that curious, half-human mind of his that he
  would be blamed for the tragedy, and I take it that that is why he has
  disappeared. As you know, he is a most luxuriant beast, and he would not be
  out in the open, getting soaked with rain and drenched with dew when
  comfortable quarters awaited him at home. You may depend upon it that Vim is
  hiding because he is afraid of punishment."</p>

  <p>"But if he hasn't done anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but he might be accused of doing something, knowing perfectly well
  that others knew of his displays of temper. Perhaps I am giving a mere animal
  too much credit for intelligence. Perhaps you may not
  agree&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not so sure of that," Sir Watney said. "Upon my word, Lionel,
  that isn't half a bad theory of yours. You know my opinion of Vim. And what
  you say has given me a little idea of my own. Now, you and I are alone here
  together, and we have the greatest confidence in one another. Tell me frankly
  what you suspect. You think that Vim saw some crime committed, and has been
  hiding ever since because he is afraid of being punished for the sins of
  another. That other, of course, would be a human being. Now, who would
  benefit by Bevill's death? It is a cynical question to ask, but it must he
  answered."</p>

  <p>Markham looked cautiously around him.</p>

  <p>"Well, you don't and I don't, as far as we know," he said. "But de Barsac
  does. You remember that Mr. Bevill was leaving him money. He made no secret
  of the fact. And you know I strongly suspect de Barsac and Dorn of a
  conspiracy to get hold of the gentleman's will. You might ask why. And if you
  do I think I can tell you. In some way or another de Barsac is under the
  thumb of that scoundrel Henderby Lupas. Owes him money probably. At any rate,
  they met this morning on the moors secretly, as I know to my personal
  knowledge. When those two came back they were profoundly dejected. There may
  be nothing in what I say, but on the other hand, there may be a great
  deal."</p>

  <p>"There may," Sir Watney admitted. "Now, I have ideas of my own on the
  subject. I think I'll go upstairs and have a look at poor Bevill's body. You
  stay here."</p>

  <p>Markham paced up and down the terrace for three-quarters of an hour until
  Sir Watney returned. His face was very set and stern, and there was a queer
  compression about his lips that Markham had only seen there once or twice
  before.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is anything but well," Sir Watney whispered. "I am not going to say
  anything yet, but I have made a startling discovery. Now, is there any sort
  of conveyance here in which we can get to Tavistock? I want to see that
  police surgeon at once. He'll talk freely to me when he knows my name."</p>

  <p>"You have found light?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my boy, a flood of it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; THE MARK OF THE BEAST.</h2>

  <p class="first">Markham was naturally impressed by his uncle's manner. It had been a good
  many years since he had seen the great scientist look so stern and grave. And
  knowing Sir Watney well, he refrained from asking an explanation.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that will be a difficult matter," he said. "But I take it
  you want this little journey kept as quiet as possible. Isn't that so?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Sir Watney said curtly. "Of course, we don't want to make a
  mystery of it, and if anybody inquires where we are going I shall tell them.
  But I would much rather that no one knew. Now, what do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we can have a dog-cart if you like. Or, better still, nearly every
  morning about this time one of the keepers in the park goes into Tavistock to
  fetch certain articles for the animals. Why not go with him?"</p>

  <p>"That's a very good idea of yours," Sir Watney said. "We will just stroll
  out across the park as if we were taking a little exercise, and you can
  explain to the keeper what we need. And there is no occasion to make a
  mystery of it."</p>

  <p>"You have found something out?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Watney paused before he replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think so," he said. "I merely remark that I think so. It is just
  a theory of mine, and at present almost as intangible as the one you were
  advancing the other day. But in my case I have something definite to go upon,
  and you had nothing. But it flashed across me just now when I was looking at
  the body of my poor friend, and I happened to see something that has
  apparently escaped attention. It may not have been there a day or two ago. I
  suppose you know that bodies change after death. For instance, if you found
  the corpse of a man just after he died, you wouldn't be able to see certain
  things that are plainly apparent a day or two later. That's what I mean in a
  nutshell. A scar may not show within an hour or of <i>rigor mortis</i>
  setting in, but it might stand out like a signal a day later. And with that I
  don't mean to say any more, except to remark that if my suspicions are
  correct, then we are on the track of the most amazing and audacious crime in
  the history of criminology. My idea is so wild and amazing that I hardly dare
  to believe that it is true. However, you will be with me in this matter, and
  you will know before long whether I am correct or not? Now, come along."</p>

  <p>They crossed the park a minute or two later, and during the course of an
  hour or so reached their destination. Arriving at the police station, they
  asked for Mr. Grant, the surgeon, and eventually ran him to ground in his
  surgery. He proved to be an alert little man with a quick eye and intelligent
  manner. He was obviously impressed when he learnt the name of his visitor and
  welcomed him effusively.</p>

  <p>"This is a decided honour, Sir Watney," he said. "Of course, I know you
  quite well, and indeed, I am an eager student of your books. Now, tell me
  what I can do for you, and I need hardly say that it will be a pleasure."</p>

  <p>"That's very good of you," Sir Watney said. "I am perfectly certain that
  you will be of great assistance to me in some investigations I am making. Now
  you are probably aware that I was a great friend of the late Mr. Bevill's,
  and, naturally, I was much concerned over his lamentable death. I understand
  that you were called in."</p>

  <p>"I was," Grant said. "I was called in by the police in the course of my
  professional duties, and I made an examination of the body."</p>

  <p>"So I understand. Now, I am not asking questions out of curiosity when I
  tell you I am anxious to hear if you noticed anything suspicious."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hardly know how to answer that question."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," Sir Watney said shrewdly. "By your hesitating
  manner you have answered it. Besides, I can't forget that your examination
  before the coroner was abruptly interrupted by the police. They wouldn't have
  done that unless you had given them some sort of a hint."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better be candid," Grant said. "In the interests of justice
  it was decided that I should not say all I knew before the adjourned inquest.
  I didn't make a post mortem because it seemed to me that I was not justified
  in so doing. Outwardly, at any rate, it looked to me as if Mr. Bevill had
  died a natural death."</p>

  <p>"But you don't think he did?" Sir Watney asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, candidly, I don't. I am puzzled. As a matter of fact I was going
  over to Baron's Court this afternoon to make a further investigation, and, if
  necessary, hold a post mortem. You see, it's like this. I noticed certain
  marks on the throat of the dead man, a certain suggestion of pressure, not
  exactly scratches, but deep indentations that are only apparent to the
  trained professional eye. They may have entirely vanished by this time; on
  the other hand, they may have become discoloured, just as if for instance
  they had been sketched in ink. And, if so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," Sir Watney said curtly. "The marks are there
  exactly as you expected. I saw them there myself this morning. Mr. Grant,
  despite the fact that my old friend appeared to have died so peacefully, I am
  firmly convinced that he was strangled. And yet, if that had been the case,
  there would have been the protruding tongue and the bulging eye which were so
  conspicuously missing. I tell you that frankly for the moment I am puzzled.
  But I do believe that my old friend was the victim of foul play, and, what is
  more, I shrewdly suspect that you share my suspicions."</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," Grant confessed. "If those marks are on the throat of the
  dead man, as you say they are, then, undoubtedly, he was strangled by some
  exceedingly powerful individual who must have held him by the throat and
  choked the life out of him as if he had been no more than a rabbit. Directly
  I saw the body I came to the conclusion, and all the more so because those
  marks you speak of are now as plain as if my poor friend's throat had been so
  much putty, holding an impression so clean that, by making a cast of it, we
  ought to be able to identify the criminal."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I am working up for," Grant said. "And that's why I
  have deferred coming up to Baron's Court for a day or two. I had hoped that
  in the course of time those impressions would grow clearer, and, from what
  you tell me, they have. But that is not the strangest point. I studied those
  marks as well as I could through a glass, and the more I studied them the
  more they puzzled me. They were finger-prints all right, but what amazing
  finger-prints. What extraordinarily long fingers, and what an abnormal length
  of thumb. Almost prehensile. I believe such things are found in certain
  savage tribes, but certainly not amongst Europeans. That's what puzzled me.
  And if you can throw any light on it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think I can," Sir Watney said quietly. "Did you ever hear of Mr.
  Bevill's famous chimpanzee Vim?"</p>

  <p>Grant almost bounced out of his chair.</p>

  <p>"That's it," he exclaimed. "By Heaven, that's it. What a fool I was not to
  think of it before! Of course I have heard all about that famous ape. The
  country folks here tell all sorts of stories about him. They say that there
  are times when he is positively dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is mere gossip," Sir Watney said. "Vim is only dangerous when he
  manages to get hold of a bottle of liqueur of which he is inordinately fond.
  At such times he was unmanageable, and then Mr. Bevill used to have his hands
  full. But usually Vim is one of the most attractive animals in the world. If
  he is teased&mdash;but no man in his senses would ever tease an ape."</p>

  <p>"But he attacked his master once or twice, didn't he?" the doctor
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Once, I believe," Sir Watney said. "Once quite recently when Mr. Bevill
  came downstairs in his pyjamas in the dead of night, and the chimpanzee
  failed to recognise him. That might have happened to anybody. I have known
  cases in similar circumstances when a man has been attacked by one of his own
  dogs. And there is an instance on record where a huntsman was killed in his
  own kennels by foxhounds under like conditions, killed by dogs that were
  devoted to him."</p>

  <p>"Well, after all said and done, Vim is only a wild animal," Grant said.
  "And it seems to me, Sir Watney, that we have practically solved the
  mystery."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Sir Watney said drily, "we are just at the beginning of
  it. I am telling you this because I shall want your assistance later on. This
  is going to be the most sensational crime that I was ever connected with. I
  have my own idea as to exactly how the thing was done, but for the moment, I
  prefer to keep that knowledge to myself. Now, if you will come over to
  Baron's Court this afternoon I will meet you and we will go into this matter
  together. I want it to appear as if you and I had never seen one another
  before, and I want you to call me in as if casually. What do you say to three
  o'clock this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>This arrangement being made, the conference broke up to reassemble at
  Baron's Court in the afternoon, in the absence of everybody else, after which
  Sir Watney and Grant adjourned to the bedroom of the dead man, where they
  remained for an hour or so. At the end of that time Sir Watney produced
  something that looked like a human hand modelled in some plastic composition,
  and handed it over to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Now, look at that," he said. "That is the model of a hand something like
  the one you describe&mdash;a hand with wonderfully long slim fingers and a
  strangely elongated thumb. It is taken from a bronze cast which I have in my
  possession, a bronze cast taken from life, and the most careful measurements
  by one of the greatest sculptors of our time. I am speaking of Mr. de Barsac,
  who is at present a visitor under this roof. You may have heard of him."</p>

  <p>"World famous," Grant murmured.</p>

  <p>"Quite so. Now, take that cast, which is fairly plastic and oblige me by
  fitting those fingers to the dark marks about the dead man's throat."</p>

  <p>"They fit exactly," Grant whispered. "That is surely the hand that did all
  the mischief. Is it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it," said Sir Watney. "That is an impression of Vim's
  right hand, or paw, as you like."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; A STRANGE DISCOVERY.</h2>

  <p class="first">Naturally enough, the tragic happenings at Baron's Court had put an end to
  the work that Frick and his companions had so gaily taken up. Almost
  immediately they packed up all their belongings and migrated in the direction
  of Lanton Place. There was no longer any thought of going on with the animal
  pictures, so that Frick and those under him were free now to devote their
  attention to the big drama with its scene on Dartmoor, and the sombre
  background of the old house.</p>

  <p>It was on the same afternoon that Sir Watney and Grant were holding their
  important interview upstairs that Markham went off in the direction of Lanton
  Place with the idea of seeing something of Sylvia, if possible, and getting
  away from a spot where, for the moment, his services were not in request. So
  far as he knew, de Barsac was busy in his studio, closeted with Dorn, as
  usual, so that the coast was clear, and Markham free to make the best he
  could of his opportunity.</p>

  <p>He found that Frick had not been wasting time. He and his company had
  already taken possession of the ruins, and all the portable structures had
  been erected in the grounds. Hatton was away somewhere on the moors and Frick
  was seated in the door of his tent with the inevitable cigarette between his
  lips. He greeted Markham with his usual cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>"Very glad to see you," he said. "You have come along just at the right
  time. We had a very busy morning, and I am taking it easy."</p>

  <p>"Where are all the rest?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Hatton is out on the moors, and I believe Miss Dorn is with him. They are
  looking for some picturesque lonely spot likely to form a proper background
  for one of Hatton's grandest ideas. All my operators are in Tavistock. Well,
  how are they over at Baron's Court? Upon my word, Mr. Markham, I was glad to
  get away from there, though it seems rather a selfish thing to say, I suppose
  there's nothing fresh."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't quite understand what you mean by fresh," Markham said.
  "You don't suspect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't suspect anything," said Frick. "I was merely asking a
  question. Ah well, he was a dear old man, and I feel as if I had lost a
  friend. We might have had a fine time there, and have done some grand
  business into the bargain. We were on the verge of it all right."</p>

  <p>"I was going to ask you," Markham said. "Did you get any pictures at
  all?"</p>

  <p>"One or two," Frick said. "We developed a section that was indifferently
  good. You see, Mr. Markham, we were only more or less experimenting. It was
  new work for our operators, and they had to get into it."</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," Markham said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll try. You see, what we did was to place three or four cameras
  in trees so that they could command a good view of the open ground
  underneath. These cameras we could work from a distance with a new electrical
  plant that I was telling you about. We could shut them off or set them going
  as we pleased. You remember that our original current was not strong enough
  and that we had to connect up with the dynamos at Baron's Court before we
  could get sufficient current. That delayed us for over a week, and a fatal
  week it was from our point of view. Well, on the night of Mr. Bevill's death
  everything was in apple pie order and we commenced to take our photographs.
  At first we were only working on leopards and pumas and smaller animals of
  that type, with the idea of going on to the lions and the tigers when Mr.
  Bevill's keepers were more familiar with the handling of savage beasts in the
  open. The scheme was to lay down small quantities of food at intervals and
  lure the beasts into the open that way. Then there was some more food farther
  on leading them gradually round to their cages again. It's a pretty sound
  programme and looked like working out all right. On the night of Mr. Bevill's
  death we were photographing from about seven o'clock till just on ten; no one
  would be anywhere near the cameras, you understand, and all of them being
  worked from some distance off by electric power. Of course, the keepers were
  told to keep under cover as close as possible, so that they shouldn't appear
  in the open and get mixed up with our films, and, therefore, in ordinary
  conditions, we ought to have done very well. We did get some pictures, I may
  tell you, one quite a real corker. Two pumas quarrelling over a piece of
  meat. The real thing, Mr. Markham. Then we shut off about ten o'clock, just
  as it was getting really dark, and you know what happened afterwards. We
  found the body of the poor old gentleman, and Hatton and I decided that it
  would be more decent if we turned our backs upon Baron's Court and came on
  here. Besides, from a business point of view, Baron's Court was off."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you were wise," Markham said. "But, from what you tell me, I
  suppose that you probably have a good many effective pictures on those films
  of yours."</p>

  <p>"I should say that was more than likely," Frick replied. "But I haven't
  the heart to get them developed, and they would be only fragments after all.
  I have put them aside altogether for the present. Perhaps, after we have done
  our big Dartmoor film and things begin to settle down at Baron's Court, the
  new owner of the property, whoever he is, may be disposed to give us
  facilities for working the menagerie there into another story that Hatton has
  got in his mind. Meanwhile, I am representing a business co-operation whose
  one idea is dividends as soon as possible, and they won't thank me to hang
  about Baron's Court on sentimental grounds."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," Markham said. "Perhaps later on, when you have
  time, you may be disposed to develop those photographs, and, if so, I should
  like to have copies as a souvenir of this terrible tragedy."</p>

  <p>Frick gave the assurance readily enough, and presently Markham walked on
  in the direction of the moor. It was a little time later that he came across
  Hatton in his most businesslike mood, with a notebook and pencil in his hand.
  He was seated on a rock by the roadside, scribbling away furiously, and for
  once in his life indisposed to talk. He was very busy, he said, and intimated
  quite plainly that Markham's presence just then was entirely superfluous.</p>

  <p>"You will find Miss Dorn a little farther on," he said.</p>

  <p>With that, he went on with his writing and Markham pursued his way until
  he found Sylvia. She was resting a little off the roadway, gazing across the
  moor thoughtfully, so that she fairly started when Markham spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"I came to look for you," he said. "I haven't seen you for two or three
  days. How is the great work progressing?"</p>

  <p>"It has hardly begun as far as I am concerned," Sylvia said. "We are
  waiting till Mr. Hatton has quite finished his story. He wanted a
  particularly lonely glen for a meeting between the heroine and her lover, the
  escaped convict, and I brought Mr. Hatton here this afternoon and showed him
  the very spot. He was so delighted with it that he went off at once and began
  to work up the scene. I believe we are to have the cameras out here to-morrow
  and get it done. I have got my dresses, and when the dialogue is finished I
  shall have to learn it before I go to bed to-night."</p>

  <p>"Rather strenuous, isn't it?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Sylvia said. "The joy of having something to do is
  very pleasing. You have no idea how dull life is here. I am beginning to
  wonder if I shall ever get out of it. Do you think I shall?"</p>

  <p>Just for the moment it was on the tip of Markham's tongue to tell Sylvia
  how near she was to escaping from that gloomy prison house. For he knew all
  about Bevill's new will, and the legacy it contained, but it seemed to him
  that just then it was no business of his to betray a confidence, and,
  besides, it did not much matter, and, in any case, Sylvia was under a
  contract that she could not break until the great drama was completed. And
  there was another reason, too, that served as a bridle on Markham's tongue.
  He was infinitely glad, of course, to know that Sylvia was placed beyond the
  reach of poverty and anxiety for the rest of her life, but the mere fact of
  her being an heiress brought out his own poverty in strong relief. He was not
  the sort of man to live on a woman's money, though Sylvia had been aware of
  his affection long before there was any prospect of her ever possessing a
  penny. No, he would not tell her now, he would leave her to find out in due
  course.</p>

  <p>And so they sat there for an hour or so, discussing their prospects for
  the future in the golden silence of the afternoon, until the sun began to
  sink down and the dew shimmered over the moorland in the distance.</p>

  <p>"It must he getting very late," Sylvia said. "Lionel, it's past seven
  o'clock! We must be going."</p>

  <p>"Just a few minutes longer," Markham pleaded. "It doesn't matter a bit
  about me; I can get back any time I please, and you can walk back to Lanton
  Place easily in half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Well, another ten minutes," Sylvia smiled. "Lionel, what's that moving
  over there?"</p>

  <p>Something was creeping along in the tangled heather a hundred yards or so
  away, then a queer wizened face appeared, followed by a brown hairy body, and
  Vim stood disclosed. He looked cautiously round, as weirdly mysterious as he
  might have looked in his own native forest, and then, as he caught sight of
  Markham and Sylvia, he commenced to beat those long hands of his upon his
  great hairy chest, and from his lips came a long, dismal, almost
  heartbreaking cry.</p>

  <p>"Oh, poor thing," Sylvia said. "Call him, Lionel."</p>

  <p>With some misgivings Markham complied. Then Sylvia added her voice to his,
  and very slowly and cautiously Vim came along in their direction. He walked
  upright till he was within a few yards of them, then he dropped on all-fours
  and came grovelling like a beaten dog to their feet. As he looked up
  imploringly into their eyes, his own actually brimmed with tears and he
  filled the still air with his cries. He seemed to have a strange fancy for
  Sylvia, for he crept up to her side and held out his paw to her with a
  suggestion of surrender.</p>

  <p>"Take it," Markham whispered. "I suppose you have heard the story. People
  are saying that Vim killed his master. People may be true, but it is hard to
  believe it."</p>

  <p>As Sylvia held out her hand, a sudden shot rang over the moor, fired, no
  doubt, by some sportsman there. The effect on Vim was magical. He jumped to
  his feet snarling and vicious, then, with a yell of defiance, dashed into the
  heather and was seen no more.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; THE DOCTOR'S EVIDENCE.</h2>

  <p class="first">It was natural enough in the circumstances that the wildest stories should
  have gone round in connection with the tragical events at Baron's Court. In a
  country neighbourhood there are always simple people ready to believe
  anything, especially in the case where the dead man had had a great
  reputation for eccentricity, and, indeed, most of the country people
  thereabouts would not cross the park at Baron's Court for a King's ransom.
  But, of course, these had heard all about Vim, and most of them knew the
  great chimpanzee by sight, therefore it was natural enough that, once the
  tongue of rumour was set going, there was no end to the many tales that it
  told. And when it became known that Vim had escaped from the park and was
  wandering about on the moors, something like a state of terror prevailed. One
  or two farmers had gone out with guns in their hand with the avowed intention
  of shooting Vim on sight, for these simple folk firmly believed that John
  Bevill owed his death to a mistaken kindness for a ferocious animal, and held
  that until the beast was destroyed there would be no peace in the
  countryside. It was in vain that those who knew protested; indeed, the more
  they argued the point, the more convinced the agriculturists were that the
  culprit was out there on the moors. And so the time went on until the
  adjourned inquest was reached.</p>

  <p>Despite the whispered horrors and unseen danger, a goodly number of people
  flocked through the gates at Baron's Court, filled with eager curiosity to
  hear the rest of the story. And with them came not only a local correspondent
  or two, but representatives of the great newspapers. Directly the coroner had
  taken his place, Dr. Grant was called.</p>

  <p>"I think," said the coroner, "that at the preliminary inquiry the witness
  declined for official reasons to give us any further information. Am I to
  take it for granted, doctor, that on the present occasion you are prepared to
  continue?"</p>

  <p>"Up to a certain point, sir," the doctor said. "I can tell you all I know,
  but in my judgment there is still a good deal to find out."</p>

  <p>"Pray, proceed," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Well, last time I stood here," Grant went on, "I told you that I had made
  a preliminary examination of the body. And that was the fact. It seemed to me
  then that Mr. Bevill had died from natural causes, and in the ordinary course
  of things I should have been prepared to give a certificate to that effect.
  But now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment," the coroner interrupted. "You say you would have been
  prepared to give a certificate to that effect. What caused you to change your
  mind?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I did change my mind," Grant replied. "It was merely a
  suggestion on the part of the police. There had been rumours to the effect
  that Mr. Bevill had been roughly treated by a pet chimpanzee of his."</p>

  <p>"I think everybody has heard that," the coroner said. "So far as I can
  understand, all sorts of extraordinary stories are going about. I don't think
  there is a single person in the room who does not know all about that
  amazingly clever animal. By the way, what has become of it? I understand
  that, since Mr. Bevill's death, this Vim, as he is called, is wandering at
  large upon the moor."</p>

  <p>"I believe that is a fact," Grant went on. "And I believe also, from what
  I have discovered, that there is a good deal to be said for the many rumours
  one hears."</p>

  <p>A thrill ran through the eager audience as there words fell quietly from
  the doctor's lips.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better continue," he said. "I made the examination of the
  body within a few hours of death. From all outward appearances except to the
  trained eye there was no sign of anything abnormal. Mr. Bevill appeared to
  have died peacefully enough. Anybody would have been justified in believing
  that he expired suddenly, as he was crossing the park, of some heart trouble.
  That the deceased had a weak heart I know for a fact. Once or twice I
  attended him professionally. Apart from that trouble he was in quite good
  health, and as he was a man who lived an exceedingly moderate and regular
  life, I could do nothing for him except to advise him to avoid all excitement
  and physical fatigue. And this is why, in ordinary circumstances, I should
  have given certificate."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"I am just coming to that, sir," Grant said. "I have told you and the jury
  how I came to the conclusion in my preliminary examination that Mr. Bevill
  had died in the ordinary way from a heart attack. But when I came to look
  closer there were certain marks about the throat of the dead man that puzzled
  me. They were queer indentations, little lines and depressions in the flesh
  that had no business to be there. I examined them through a strong glass, and
  I could make nothing of them. They were suspicious marks, but, so far as I
  could make out for the moment, in no way responsible for the unfortunate
  gentleman's death, and therefore I decided to wait to see how they
  developed."</p>

  <p>"Let us have that quite clear," the coroner said. "What exactly do you
  mean by 'developed'?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it's like this. After a time I knew that those marks would
  deepen in colour. And they did. When I made my second examination they were
  as plain as if they had been painted there. They appeared on second
  examination to be rather deep, so deep, indeed, that they might have caused
  suffocation. And perhaps they did."</p>

  <p>Once more a thrill ran round the room, and once more Grant went calmly on
  with his story.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly those marks had been made by a firm grip on the dead man's
  throat. They must have been applied with great force by some one in the
  possession of enormous power. And yet, at the same time, if that grip had
  been the cause of death there would have been certain signs on the face of
  the deceased which were altogether absent."</p>

  <p>"What signs do you mean?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, for instance, a certain blackness about the face, a protruding
  tongue, and a staring of the eyeballs. And, besides, a man of merely normal
  health would certainly have put up something of a struggle if some assailant
  had tried to choke him. He could not help it. And therefore, in that case,
  there would have been signs of a struggle, marks on the grass, disarranged
  clothing, and all that sort of thing. But, as a matter of fact, there were no
  traces of this. Mr. Bevill was found peacefully lying on his back without so
  much as his tie out of place. There could have been no struggle, and yet
  logically, there ought to be."</p>

  <p>The coroner was obviously puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you," he said. "Are we to assume, after all you have
  said, that those marks on the throat had nothing to do with Mr. Bevill's
  death?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly I can't tell you," Grant said. "I am as puzzled as you are. That
  Mr. Bevill was killed in some way or another I feel certain. I should have no
  doubt in saying so if those missing signs had not been present. The marks on
  the dead man's throat are so deep, now that time has developed them, that
  they in themselves would be enough to cause the tragedy."</p>

  <p>"The marks of a human hand?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I said that," Grant went on. "I said they resembled a human
  hand, rather a strange human hand with exceedingly long fingers and an
  abnormal thumb."</p>

  <p>The coroner looked up eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I think I begin to follow you," he said. "The hand of an ape, in
  fact."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Grant said. And, as he spoke, murmurs arose from all round
  the room. "The hand of the chimpanzee, Vim, beyond the shadow of a doubt. I
  am all the more sure of this because I have had on opportunity of testing my
  opinion. A little time ago a copy in bronze of Vim's hand and arm, if I may
  call it so, was made by a famous sculptor, Mr. de Barsac. He is in the room
  here now, and I have no doubt he can confirm all I say if necessary."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," de Barsac murmured. "I did make that cast on the request of
  my friend, Sir Watney Gibson, who wanted it to reproduce in a book he is
  writing, and I may say that the cast is true to a hair's breath."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," the coroner murmured. "But, at the same time, rather
  irregular. We will hear you, presently, Mr. de Barsac, if there is any
  necessity. Go on, Dr. Grant."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, from that cast I took a mould in some plastic composition, and
  when it was sufficiently dry I applied it to the marks on the dead man's
  throat. I may say it fitted exactly. And now you know why I delayed my
  evidence on the last occasion."</p>

  <p>"And you are quite sure," the coroner said. "If what you say is correct,
  and I see no reason to doubt it, Mr. Bevill met his death at the hands of the
  chimpanzee. I fail to see how we can come to any other conclusion."</p>

  <p>"I haven't quite finished yet," Grant said quietly. "An hour or two ago I
  should have said so, but before finally making up my mind I have decided to
  make a further examination of the body. That was only an hour or two ago.
  When I did so I discovered a tiny fracture at the base of the brain, no
  larger, perhaps, than half a crown, but quite sufficient to cause death in an
  old man. As far as I can judge, the blow must have been administered with a
  loaded cane, or more probably with a sandbag, such as is generally used in
  America. That is a bag filled with sand, which makes a formidable weapon. The
  theory I have formed now is that Mr. Bevill was struck a traitorous blow from
  behind, which probably felled him and fractured his skull at the same time,
  as I told you. He may have been just conscious enough to struggle to his
  feet, and grapple with his assailant before he collapsed again. Then,
  probably, the hand clutched his throat and held him there after he was dead.
  But I should say he was dead almost before he reached the ground the second
  time, and if I am correct in that assumption, then there would have been no
  blackening of the face or protruding of the tongue that I naturally looked
  for. In other words, the grip on Mr. Bevill's throat was quite superfluous,
  though his murderer would not know it."</p>

  <p>Apparently there was nothing more to be said or done. It would have been
  merely waste of time to carry the investigation farther. The coroner summed
  up briefly and the jury brought in a verdict to the effect that John Bevill
  had been murderously assaulted by the chimpanzee, Vim, and had received
  injuries which resulted in his death. Then the excited audience poured out to
  discuss the tragedy at its leisure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; ON THE SCENT.</h2>

  <p class="first">The big house was silent again, the excitement of the morning had died
  away, and Sir Watney Gibson with Markham was walking up and down the terrace,
  talking over the recent inquiry. Dorn had vanished, saying that important
  business had called him home, and de Barsac was apparently busy in his
  studio. So that the two men on the terrace could talk freely.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, I am far from satisfied," Sir Watney replied. "It all
  sounded logical enough, and after what Grant had said the jury could come to
  no other conclusion. And the coroner, from his point of view, was equally
  sound. He told the jury that Vim had attacked his master in a moment of
  savage fury, probably with a heavy piece of wood. Oh, I know it sounds all
  right. Vim hit Bevill on the back of the head, and probably thinking his work
  was only half done, clutched him by the throat and held him down till the job
  was finished, to put it in a cold-blooded way. What else could the coroner
  say in the face of Grant's evidence? We know that Vim accompanied his master,
  we know that he attempted violence on him twice in a fortnight, and we know,
  beyond the shadow of a doubt, that those marks on Bevill's throat were made
  by the chimpanzee. And if I had not been here John Bevill would have been
  quietly buried, and, in the course of time, the hideous tragedy would have
  been forgotten. A few farmers would have got together with their guns and Vim
  would have been shot, and buried, and there the story would have ended."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think anything about it," Sir Watney exclaimed. "The whole thing
  is wrong."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear uncle," Markham protested, "you were indirectly the means of
  fixing the guilt on Vim. If that cast had never been taken, you would not
  have been in a position to lend it to the doctor, and
  therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know all about that," Sir Watney said impatiently. "Yet, at the
  same time, they are all wrong. I know they are all wrong, and I am not going
  to rest till I have proved it. And don't forget this, my boy, the cause of
  death was not the finger-marks about Bevill's throat, but that neat little
  fracture at the base of his skull. Keep that clearly before your eyes, and
  you will begin to understand what I am driving at. I shall be greatly
  mistaken and deeply disappointed if within the next week or so I have not put
  a different construction on the case. Now listen. You stay on here for a day
  or two and keep your eye open. If you see anything in the least suspicious on
  anybody's part, no matter who it is, let me know at once. I am going to
  London this afternoon, and you can write or telegraph to me to my place in
  town. If you see anything very queer, be sure and telegraph. Not from the
  village post-office, but from Tavistock. I am going to fade quietly away
  presently, and when dinner-time comes you had best profess not to know that I
  have gone."</p>

  <p>True to his word, Sir Watney went back to town by the afternoon train, and
  though it was late when he reached his destination he telephoned immediately
  to Scotland Yard and asked to be put in communication with a certain
  detective sergeant there. Being a man who was <i>persona grata</i> with the
  authorities, Sir Watney was attended to at once, and half an hour later was
  closeted with Sergeant Gideon in his study. And there, over a cigar and a
  whisky and soda, he began to talk.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a big job at present, Gideon," he said. "But, unless I am
  greatly mistaken, it is going to develop into one of those most stupendous
  sensations of our time. In a few words, it is connected with the Baron's
  Court affair. I don't suppose you know much about that."</p>

  <p>"Only what I have read in the evening paper, sir," Gideon replied. "A
  queer case altogether. But then Mr. Bevill was a queer man, wasn't he? Kept a
  menagerie, and all the rest of it. Murdered by his own ape."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind, Gideon," Sir Watney said impatiently. "Didn't I tell
  you there was a big sensation? At any rate, there will be. Now, here is a
  list of everybody about Baron's Court at the time of Mr. Bevill's death. When
  I say everybody. I mean everybody, from the guests in the house down to the
  scullery maid. If you will glance it over, I daresay you will find that some
  are familiar to you."</p>

  <p>Gideon took the slip of paper and read it.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he said, "I can say nothing about the servants of course. I
  know you and your nephew, and this man Frick I have also heard of. The same
  remark applies to Hatton, the writer. I suppose Mr. de Barsac is the famous
  sculptor who has that big house in Park Lane? Great swell he is, knows
  everybody, and very rich. And&mdash;hello&mdash;here's my old friend Major
  Dorn. Doesn't he live somewhere down in that part? A regular bad lot he is,
  sir. A begging-letter writer, and as cunning as they make 'em. We have never
  been able to lay him by the heels, but perhaps now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind about that chap," Sir Watney cried. "We are flying at much
  bigger game, Gideon. Now, what I want you to do is this. You see that name on
  the list where I put my finger? That's the man I want to know all about. He
  left Baron's Court nearly a week before Mr. Bevill died and came up to
  London. He came on business, I think, but that's a detail. I want to know
  what happened to him from the time he reached London till the hour he left.
  Everything, mind you. What hotel he stayed at in town, because I happen to
  know that he didn't go home, and so forth and so on. I don't expect you to
  find out all at once. When you have traced the first day's doings, let me
  know. How long will it be?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not very long, sir. With my scouts and one thing and another I can
  post you by this time to-morrow evening with a diary of a couple of
  days."</p>

  <p>"That will do very nicely," Sir Watney said. "Ring me up to-morrow night
  about the same time and I will be here to listen. I think that will do."</p>

  <p>Faithful to his promise, Gideon rang up on the following evening with
  quite a budget of information.</p>

  <p>"I have done fairly well, Sir Watney," he said. "Your man reached London
  on Wednesday evening about six o'clock, and put up at a small hotel in
  Norfolk-street, Strand. Half a minute, and I will give you the name of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that," Sir Watney cried. "I am not concerned with with
  the name of the hotel, merely remarking that it seems a quiet sort of place
  for a man of that type to stay in."</p>

  <p>"I thought so, too, sir," Gideon replied. "At any rate, he went there and
  he happened to be driven from Paddington by a taxi-man who recognised him. As
  a matter of fact, he is known to most taxi-drivers in London. Well, he goes
  to this little hotel off the Embankment, and there takes a bedroom for a few
  days. What's more, he doesn't give his own name, but calls himself
  Charlesworth."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Sir Watney said softly. "Oh, indeed. A not unexpected
  development, Gideon, and one that, on the whole, does not displease me.
  Well?"</p>

  <p>"The next day he stays in the hotel nearly all the time, and on the
  following morning, at eleven o'clock, he takes a taxi from the rank just
  outside the Temple Station and drives to Ironmonger Lane, where he spends a
  couple of hours with a financier called Henderby Lupas. Then he walks back to
  his hotel, and, after dining there quietly, goes out to the Strand Theatre
  alone and then he goes to bed. The next morning he goes into Wardour-street,
  and stays a couple of hours or so in the shop of an old man called
  Jonas."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed?" Sir Watney said again, in the same soft tones. "And what
  does Mr. Jonas do?"</p>

  <p>"Just half a minute, sir, while I look at my notes. Ah, here we are. Jonas
  Jonas, a naturalist and taxidermist. A sort of Roland Ward on a small scale.
  In fact, I rather think that he was with Roland Ward at one time."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney chuckled as he listened. He did not appear to be further
  interested, but lent his ear more or less casually to the finish.</p>

  <p>"And that's as far as I have gone, sir," Gideon said at the conclusion. "I
  hope I haven't been wasting my time."</p>

  <p>"Indeed you haven't," Sir Watney replied. "You have done exceedingly well.
  I shall be greatly surprised if you haven't told me all I want. Still, you
  can go on; the more details I have, the more I shall be able to cope with our
  friend presently. Ring me up again to-morrow night at the same time. For the
  present, that will do."</p>

  <p>It was shortly after breakfast the following morning that Sir Watney left
  his house and proceeded in the direction of Wardour-street. He found his
  destination at length, a little dingy shop in that somewhat dingy
  thoroughfare with the name of Jonas in faded guilt letters over the door. A
  small man with a long black beard and a pair of piercing eyes came forward
  and asked Sir Watney's pleasure. When he disclosed his identity, the man
  behind the counter bowed profusely and expressed the honour he felt in having
  so distinguished a visitor under his humble roof.</p>

  <p>"I came to see you," Sir Watney said, "because I am told you are an
  exceedingly good workman."</p>

  <p>"I hope I am more than that, Sir Watney," Jonas said. "A good friend I met
  in London can make casts of animals, and stuff them, but I pride myself on
  the fact that I am a naturalist as well. Sportsmen come to me from all over
  the world. Now what can I do for you, sir?"</p>

  <p>Sir Watney proceeded to put a brown-paper parcel on the counter, and
  opening it, displayed the bronze cast that had been made for him by de
  Barsac.</p>

  <p>"There," he said. "Now, I think you will admit that that is an
  extraordinarily fine piece of work, Mr. Jonas. It was made for me by a famous
  sculptor, and is the exact reproduction of the hand and arm of a chimpanzee.
  Now, I want you to take that and recreate the arm so to speak, in steel and
  leather. I want the arm back again, if you understand me, a hollow imitation,
  but at the same time, so true an imitation that it follows the original in
  every detail. Make it in the form of a glove so that I can slip it on my
  hand."</p>

  <p>Jonas looked up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That's a funny thing, a very funny thing," he said. "I had a precisely
  identical commission about nine days ago from a gentleman who brought me in a
  similar cast."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; THE BLACK BOX.</h2>

  <p class="first">A day or two had elapsed at Baron's Court, and, so far as Markham could
  see, nothing had happened that called for any special vigilance on his part.
  He had his own suspicions, of course, more especially as regarded the
  intimacy between Dorn and de Barsac; but, naturally enough, it was impossible
  for him to follow up his theory in this direction without arousing alarm on
  the part of the two men whom he had every reason to believe were a pair of
  particularly choice scoundrels. But, with all his suspicions, Markham could
  prove nothing, and it was very doubtful as to whether he had any real idea of
  the facts that had taken Sir Watney in such a great hurry to London.</p>

  <p>So, therefore, he hung about the place, pretending to be busy, and keeping
  his eyes open altogether without result, so that by the end of the week he
  was both bored and disappointed and longing for companionship. He was free to
  go over to Lanton Place, of course, and all the more so because Frick and his
  associates were now busily engaged on the great drama, and day by day Lanton
  Place presented a picture of the most extraordinary activity.</p>

  <p>There were at least a dozen caravans in which the operators were housed,
  whilst the actors themselves had overflowed into the various farmhouses in
  the neighbourhood, where they were naturally the source of much interest and
  curiosity. The weather was still brilliantly fine, and outdoor work was going
  on apace. For some little time now, Hatton's scene plot had been finished,
  and thousands of photographs had been taken out there, on the moors. So,
  therefore, Markham's visits to Lanton Place passed almost unnoticed as far as
  Dorn and De Barsac were concerned, and, indeed, they were glad enough to have
  Baron's Court to themselves. Nurse Coterell had vanished directly after
  Bevill's funeral, and so far as she was concerned they had nothing to
  fear.</p>

  <p>It was Dorn's habit to come over to Baron's Court most days now, and pass
  most of the time in the studio, discussing certain projects which materially
  concerned the fortunes of the two men. They would sit there, and talk and
  smoke, afterwards, lunching and dining in the luxurious fashion that they
  affected, whilst they idly speculated how much longer this ideal condition of
  things was going to last, and somewhat uneasily wondering what Henderby Lupas
  was going to do, and why that unscrupulous financier gave no sign. But though
  they talked and schemed, they were no nearer to acquiring the money of which
  they were both desperately in need. They had been too clever, too cunning,
  and now they were practically at the end of their tether.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Markham was over at Lanton Place, and seeing as much of Sylvia
  as was possible. There were occasional breaks in the day's work, when her
  services were not required, and in these intervals they wandered about the
  silent and deserted grounds, discussing the future and what it was likely to
  bring. For most of the day Lanton Place was quiet enough, so that Mrs. Dorn
  was free to creep about the ruins in the old mysterious way and search for
  the lost something that was always uppermost in that clouded brain of hers.
  Markham had been away for a whole day on a little business of his own, and
  now he was back at Lanton Place and seated in a ruined old summer-house with
  Sylvia by his side. From where they sat they could occasionally see the
  pathetic figure of Mrs. Dorn as she went about that ever-ending toil of
  hers.</p>

  <p>"I shall be glad when you can put an end to that," Markham said. "Has it
  always been going on?"</p>

  <p>"Ever since I can remember," Sylvia replied. "And under present
  conditions, it is sure to go on. I wonder if you have done anything,
  Lionel."</p>

  <p>"In what direction?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you remember the letter that my mother gave to you. I mean the
  charred letter that she found in the ruins."</p>

  <p>"From my father. Oh, yes, I have not forgotten. I have not got it with me
  now, but I have read it over and over again, and every day for some time I
  had intended going over that cottage of mine to see if I could discover some
  clue amongst the thousands of odds and ends that were stored there after my
  father's death. That was what I was doing yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Without result, of course," Sylvia said.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether. I didn't find anything. You will remember that the box in
  question was consigned to my father's firm for safe custody. In other words,
  it was sent to the bank in the usual course. Just a black box, sealed and
  locked, to be left until it was required. Now, do you happen to remember what
  sort of a seal it was?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how can I say that?" Sylvia asked. "I could hardly walk at the time.
  But if it was sealed, and sent by my mother as I understand it was, then
  probably she would use that peculiar old ring that she wears on her left
  hand. It is an engraved diamond, a very valuable stone, I believe, and one
  from which she has never parted. Goodness knows what sentimental value she
  attaches to it, but there must be some, because she never takes it off night
  or day. She has never moved it from her finger, as far as I can recollect. I
  am ashamed to say that my father has tried to force her to give it up on
  several occasions, but even his refined cruelty has always been without
  effect. Another of those many mysteries that surround the house, I
  expect."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's all very mysterious," Markham said. "Does your mother ever
  write any letters, Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>"'Three or four times a year, perhaps," Sylvia said. "Heaven only knows
  who her correspondents are. She writes secretly and furtively, and then,
  under cover of the darkness, posts them in the village herself. I have a
  strong suspicion that they are written to quite imaginary correspondents; I
  mean that they are dictated by a disordered brain. Anyway, they never come
  back, and no replies are ever received."</p>

  <p>"That's very strange," Markham said thoughtfully. "But what's all that got
  to do with the engraved diamond?"</p>

  <p>"I was going to tell you," Sylvia proceeded. "Whenever my mother writes a
  letter she always seals the flap of the envelope with green wax. It is a
  peculiar shade of green wax, and she has had it in her desk ever since I can
  remember. She doesn't in the least mind writing letters when I am about so
  long as I don't get too near her, but directly she hears my father anywhere
  she throws everything back in her desk and locks it. But I was going to tell
  you that she always impresses the green wax on the envelope with that diamond
  ring of hers. It makes an impression like a small five pointed star with the
  letter 'S' in the centre."</p>

  <p>An exclamation came from Markham's lips.</p>

  <p>"Then in that case, I have found the box," he said. "As a matter of fact,
  there were three or four black boxes, all of which I opened at once. I could
  see they had nothing whatever to do with this particular business. But the
  other box was a small black affair locked and sealed in half a dozen places
  with a particular shade of green wax. There was nothing on the outside of it
  to identify it with anybody beyond the addressed label, and as my father's
  affairs have been wound up so many years, I decided to open it. Before I did
  so, I noticed the peculiar impression on the wax, which tallies exactly with
  what you have just told me&mdash;a five-pointed star with the initial letter
  'S' in the centre. Of course, if I had identified the box with your mother, I
  should have done nothing of the kind. Well, I opened it."</p>

  <p>"And found something?" Sylvia asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the slightest value. Nothing but several packages of tissue
  paper with some scraps of metal inside. And there is an end of the mystery as
  far as we are concerned."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter in the least," Sylvia said. "But it sounds rather
  disappointing. Can't you see what has happened, Lionel? Can't you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't," Markham said.</p>

  <p>"It is quite plain to me," Sylvia said. "All these years my mother has had
  one idea fixed in her mind. Probably the only sane idea she has. I have told
  you more than once that she is under the impression that she has placed
  somewhere in safety a fortune for me. Her jewels, in fact. I know she had a
  wonderful collection of stones at one time. And in that queer way of hers she
  thinks they are safe in some bank; indeed, she has told you so. She is under
  the impression that your father had them. And so far, she is sane enough.
  Beyond the shadow of a doubt, she did contrive to pack up her valuables in
  that box and send them away to your father's bank. And ever since the fire
  that wrecked her reason, she has been hunting in the ruins to find the
  receipt. I suppose in her darkened manner she imagined that it would be
  impossible to get the box back unless she could produce the receipt. She must
  have done all this for my sake, so that I should be beyond the reach of want
  after she died. And, of course, she did not tell my father anything about
  this, because she new perfectly well that he would have robbed her if he had
  the opportunity, and would squander the money in that selfish way of his.
  Now, can't you see what happened, Lionel? He knew everything that was going
  on. He probably drugged my mother; and, when she lay asleep, took the ring
  from her finger, and, after he had emptied the box, resealed it. Unless, of
  course, my mother was mad when she sent the box along, and was under the
  delusion that all the rubbish she put inside represented valuable gems. But I
  don't believe it. She was much more sane then than she is now, and she could
  not have displayed all that cunning and caution for the sake of a lot of
  rubbish. We shall never know the real truth, Lionel, but I feel perfectly
  certain that I am right. My father took those gems and sold them, and all
  these years he has known exactly what my mother is looking for. What a
  shameful confession it is to have to make about one's own father."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't think about that, Sylvia, if I were you," Markham said. "It's
  no fault of yours, and you can't help having such a father. What I am
  concerned about is your mother. I am wondering what effect it will have upon
  her when we tell her all this."</p>

  <p>Sylvia was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"But why should we tell her at all?" she said at length. "Or at any rate,
  why tell her the truth? Really, she is far happier as she is."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," Markham said. "She knows already what a
  blackguard of a husband she has."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; MORE LIGHT.</h2>

  <p class="first">As Markham spoke, he glanced up in the direction of the pathetic figure
  groping there amongst the ruin, and as he did so he saw Dorn standing there
  before him. The latter must have heard what Markham was saying; indeed, he
  was standing so close by that it was impossible for him not to have done so.
  And besides, his face was dark and angry, and there was an ugly expression in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded. "What right have you got in my
  grounds? So this is what is going on right under my very nose, is it? You
  sneak over here in my absence and make love to my daughter without asking my
  permission. A pretty dishonourable thing to do."</p>

  <p>Markham rose calmly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"This was bound to happen sooner or later," he said coolly. "Sylvia, would
  you mind leaving us alone for a few minutes? I think I know how to deal with
  your father."</p>

  <p>Sylvia glanced irresolutely for a moment from one to the other, and then
  moved in the direction of the house.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean by that, sir?" Dorn blazed out. "You know how
  to deal with me, indeed! Anybody would think you were talking to a
  criminal."</p>

  <p>"They would be quite right," Markham said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Dorn hissed. "I suppose you see this business cannot stop
  here."</p>

  <p>"So I have thought for some little time," Markham went on in the same
  quiet fashion. "Now, look here, Major Dorn, you and I had better understand
  one another at once. You implied just now that I was talking to a scoundrel.
  I am. There, drop that, none of your bluster with me. I know you to be a
  scoundrel of the worst possible type, and, what's more, the police know it
  too. They have never laid the king of the begging-letter writers by the heels
  yet, but I think if I laid certain information that I possess at their
  disposal, the last of the famous family of Dorn would run a strong chance of
  finishing his days in gaol. I know all about you, my friend, and I should not
  have the slightest hesitation in placing the information in proper hands, but
  for your daughter. The mere fact that I know her and intend to marry her has
  saved that rascally skin of yours. It seems almost incredible to me that a
  man of your type could be the father of a girl like Sylvia. But she is as
  pure and good as she is beautiful, and I love her all the more because she
  has such a parent. And I tell you frankly that I am going to marry her."</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it for a moment," Dorn sneered. "Whether you would have
  said the same thing a week or two ago is another question. Astonishing what a
  difference a few days make."</p>

  <p>Markham's lip curled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you have discovered that, have you?" he said. "You have discovered
  the fact that, thanks to John Bevill's generosity, Sylvia is an heiress in
  her own right. But your pleasant suggestion lacks point, because Sylvia knew
  that I loved her long before I came down here. I met her when she was touring
  in the north of England, and there and then made up my mind that she was the
  only girl in the world for me. She knows, and has known for some time, that I
  am only waiting for a promised appointment before offering her a home."</p>

  <p>"And what about her mother?" Dorn demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have not forgotten that unhappy wife of yours. I shall be only too
  pleased to offer her the shelter of my roof. But don't forget this, Major
  Dorn, I may have only a small income now, but Sir Watney Gibson has made no
  secret of the fact that some day I shall have all his money. My good sir,
  your sneers leave me untouched. I know that I am no fortune hunter, and
  Sylvia knows it, and that being so, the rest of the world can go hang. I
  don't care two-pence if everybody knows that I have married the daughter of a
  dissipated old rascal who has spent all his wife's money and robbed her of
  her jewels besides. I know all about that little black box with the green
  seals, the little black box filled with scraps of metal instead of diamonds.
  I know how you drugged your unfortunate wife and removed the ring from her
  finger before you opened that box and extracted the contents. And I tell you
  plainly this: If I have any more of your nonsense, I'll put the police on
  your track if you are ten times Sylvia's father. And if you like you can tell
  de Barsac I said so. You are a fine pair, you two, but you have overreached
  yourselves this time. If you hadn't been so infernally clever, the forty
  thousand pounds John Bevill left to your daughter would have gone to de
  Barsac, and then he would have been able to pay Henderby Lupas the money he
  owes him."</p>

  <p>The angry flush faded from Dorn's face, and a curious whiteness showed
  about the corners of his lips. All the fight had gone out of the man now, all
  his bullying swagger had vanished, and he looked a mean and contemptible
  coward indeed as he glanced furtively into Markham's calm features.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you do, my friend; oh, yes, you do. It wasn't a bad idea of
  yours to steal Mr. Bevill's will so that you could show it to Henderby Lupas
  and convince him of the truth of what you said. But you were in a bit too
  much of a hurry; you might have waited. Instead of which you stole the will
  from the safe, and thanks to Frick being about the house, you were very
  nearly caught. I did not know enough at the moment to denounce you, but I
  know exactly what happened. You and de Barsac fled through the library
  window, and, in the confusion, you managed to get up into de Barsac's bedroom
  with his help. You see, I know all about it. And I was going to keep my
  counsel, only you challenged me just now, and I felt bound to tell you the
  truth. I think you and your partner have been sufficiently punished as it is.
  And perhaps there is worse to come, though I won't say anything about that
  yet. And now, Major Dorn, I should like to know what you have got to
  say."</p>

  <p>But, apparently, Dorn had nothing to say, for he slunk away a few minutes
  later in the direction of the house like a dog that has been beaten. Markham
  followed him with a smile on his face, and then, without waiting to see
  Sylvia again, went off in the direction of the moor.</p>

  <p>He could see several people in the distance, moving about in a sort of
  orderly confusion, and amongst them Frick giving direction. There were
  perhaps forty or fifty people altogether dressed in various costumes, and all
  obviously engaged in connection with the making of pictures. Frick detached
  himself from the group presently and came over to Markham.</p>

  <p>"How are you getting on?" the latter inquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh, famously," Frick replied. "We are doing splendidly. Already we have
  finished most of the main scenes, and if this weather lasts for another
  fortnight we shall be able to get away from here altogether. It largely
  depends upon Hatton. He's a rare enthusiast when he gets his heart into his
  work, and he's always full of ideas. No sooner do we get a series of pictures
  done for one big scene than some bits of brilliant business occurs to him and
  he wants it done all over again. He's never wrong, but it's very expensive,
  though I don't think our people would mind that when they see what fine work
  we are doing. For instance, yesterday we had completed a grand lot of films
  when Hatton had an idea introducing a new character that upset the whole
  scheme. But when it was finished and a lot of fresh photographs taken the
  whole thing was improved out of all knowledge. Ah, here he comes again. It's
  any money he's got a new idea in his head. See how excited he is."</p>

  <p>Hatton, in his shirt sleeves, with a stump of a cigarette in the corner of
  his mouth, came flying across the heather in the direction of the spot where
  Frick was standing.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he cried, "I have got a big thing on here."</p>

  <p>"More expense," Frick groaned.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I like to hear you talking about expenses," Hatton retorted. "You are
  the biggest spendthrift in England. But listen. About a quarter of an hour
  ago, I was walking down the little valley yonder behind that waterfall with a
  view to a background for the scene of the wounded smuggler, and the girl who
  brings him food, when I ran up against the monkey. You know what I
  mean&mdash;Mr. Bevill's ape. He was sitting there, on the rocks, cleaning
  himself up, and when he turned and saw me I thought the poor beggar meant
  mischief. He snarled and showed his teeth and came in my direction, and it
  looked as if my number was up for a moment. You see, the poor brute has been
  hunted all over the place with dogs and guns until he is quite desperate.
  With my heart in my mouth I went towards him and called him by name, and I
  think he remembered having seen me at Baron's Court, for he began to whimper
  and cry like a child. It's a very odd thing to me if that beast ever did any
  mischief to Bevill at all. But that's got nothing to do with it. We were just
  getting on pretty good terms when a shepherd's dog came prowling about, and
  directly Vim caught sight of him he shinned up the rocks like lightning and
  vanished."</p>

  <p>"Very strange," Frick said. "But what's all this got to do with this new
  idea of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Everything," Hatton went on. "I am going to bring some wild animals into
  act four. A dramatic surprise in connection with the menagerie that has
  broken down in crossing the moors. See, what I mean, Frick, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but where are the pictures to come from," Frick asked. "You have
  forgotten that."</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten nothing," Hatton said impatiently. "Haven't we got a
  score or more of pictures of animals somewhere or another that we took the
  few days we were at Baron's Court. You remember, the pictures we took of all
  the animals in the park. I don't suppose there are many of them any use, but
  then I don't happen to want many. Half a dozen films will be quite
  sufficient, I take it, and you can leave it to me to work them in
  artistically."</p>

  <p>"But I don't know where they are," Frick said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there you go," Hatton cried. "What a casual beggar you are, always
  putting difficulties in the way. Well, as it happens, I know where they are,
  and I have asked Johnson to dig them out. He's developing the whole blessed
  lot at the present moment. He'll have them printed in a few minutes, and then
  I shall know exactly where I am. I shall be greatly disappointed if I don't
  find at least a dozen pictures that will be suitable for my purpose. I'll
  just go and see how Johnson's getting on, then I'll come back to you and have
  a drink and a smoke, which I think I deserve. Perhaps Mr. Markham would like
  to stay and see how the pictures come out."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; SUSPENSE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Markham, however, was just a little too exercised in his mind to remain
  and see the development of those films. In any case, he was not particularly
  interested; he had wandered out on the moor more to collect his thoughts than
  anything else, and he wanted to get back to Baron's Court now, for there were
  letters to write and he was just a little conscious that he was neglecting
  Sir Watney's interests.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't stay," he said. "Of course, it is all very alluring,
  no doubt, and if I were not so busy I would stay. Perhaps you will come over
  one of these evenings and show me what you have done."</p>

  <p>"Really, we shan't be many minutes," Hatton said. "Oh, well, if you can't
  stay, there's an end of it."</p>

  <p>"We'll come over to-morrow night," Frick said. "We'll both come. I have
  been working so hard lately that an hour or two in the billiard-room at
  Baron's Court would be welcome enough."</p>

  <p>"All right," Markham said. "I'll regard that as an engagement. And now I
  must be getting back."</p>

  <p>He walked along the road thoughtfully enough, hardly knowing whether to be
  pleased or disappointed as a result of his interview with Dorn. He certainly
  had scored off that somewhat elusive individual, and he smiled to himself as
  he thought of Dorn's face. But, on the other hand, perhaps he had not been
  discreet in letting the Major know how deeply he had dived into his
  antecedents. Without anything definite, Markham felt that he stood on the
  threshold of tragic events, and he was certainly a little uneasy in his mind
  when he came to realise how his indiscretions might have prejudiced Sir
  Watney in certain investigations he was making in London.</p>

  <p>And, again, he would have to meet both these men at dinner. Sit opposite
  to these unscrupulous scoundrels whom he had almost gone out of his way to
  warn. Not that he was in the least afraid of them, but that was not precisely
  the point. How far would they benefit by what he had said?</p>

  <p>But when Markham got back to Baron's Court there was no sign either on the
  part of Dorn or de Barsac of any enmity. On the contrary, de Barsac seemed to
  be exerting himself to be agreeable, and Dorn was quite the man of the world.
  And so the evening passed without friction, so that Markham began to wonder
  if Dorn had confided anything of what had happened to his confederate. It was
  just the same at breakfast the next morning, and subsequently luncheon, after
  which Dorn and de Barsac retired to the studio as usual, leaving Markham
  wondering what the next movement would be.</p>

  <p>But once those two men were alone the smiles vanished from their faces,
  and they regarded one another with gloomy looks.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we managed to throw dust in that young man's eyes," de Barsac
  said moodily. "I can't understand where he got his information from."</p>

  <p>"I think I can," Dorn said. "I would give a good deal to know what
  Gibson's up to in London. Can't you see how it is? Gibson left Markham down
  here to keep his eyes open, and he is doing it."</p>

  <p>"I am not much afraid of Gibson," de Barsac said. "He's rather an old ass,
  isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Now, that's just where you make the mistake," Dorn said. "It's the
  mistake that every sanguine man makes. He always regards everybody else but
  himself as a fool. You mustn't forget the other fellow's points of view. You
  invariably think your plans are perfect, and that there's no flaw in them,
  and because you think so, you can't understand that the other man has the
  ghost of a chance. But don't forget that Sir Watney has been mixed up with
  crimes and criminals all his life."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but only in a scientific way. Only after the police have given
  him all the facts."</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you are wrong again," the Major said. "I happen to know that
  those facts have come quite as often from Gibson as from the police. A great
  scientist like Gibson isn't particularly anxious to pose as a detective. He
  would consider it beneath his dignity, but that doesn't prevent him from
  offering certain theories to the authorities, and getting them to put them
  forward as their own. Gibson is simple enough to look at, and quite boyishly
  enthusiastic in his way, but a good bit of a bulldog all the same. But never
  mind him. What are you going to do about Henderby Lupas?"</p>

  <p>De Barsac shrugged his shoulders indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I don't know," he said. "It's very certain he won't wait
  much longer. And I don't like the way in which he is lying low. He knows we
  are up to something wrong, and he hasn't the slightest intention of
  identifying himself with it. But he'll have his money, all the same."</p>

  <p>"Money you can't possibly pay him?"</p>

  <p>"What's the use of pretending that I can? I am right at the end of my
  tether. I don't know which way to turn. Once Lupas starts to sue me I am
  done. If he makes up his mind he's going to lose his money he'll prosecute
  me, and that means five years at the least. By the time I am free again my
  hands will be ruined. I shall never be able to use a graving tool again. It's
  a fine prospect."</p>

  <p>De Barsac spoke despondently enough now. All the lightness and
  carelessness seemed to have gone out of him.</p>

  <p>"I am not sorry to hear you talk like that," Dorn remarked. "I was
  beginning to wonder when you would realise the true position of affairs."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I always have," de Barsac said. "But what's the use of crying about
  it? Now, look here, Dorn, there's only one thing to be done. The only way to
  keep Lupas quiet is for me to marry your daughter."</p>

  <p>"Really," Dorn smiled. "That's a happy idea of yours. How do you propose
  to carry it out?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's easy enough. She's a young girl, absolutely fancy free, and,
  without undue vanity, would certainly be flattered by the attention of Victor
  de Barsac. I don't say that it is because I am de Barsac, any other public
  man in my position would be the same. I have never met a woman yet who was
  indifferent to my attentions. My dear fellow, she'd jump at having me. She
  wouldn't be blind to the advantage of being de Barsac's wife. A fine house
  and a big position, and all that sort of thing. Motors, and jewels, and
  holidays on the Continent. That's all the average woman thinks about. Fine
  idea, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's nothing much the matter with the idea," Dorn said; "but then,
  with you, an idea is as good as accomplished almost before it is thought
  about. I suppose it never occurs to you that there are one or two girls in
  the world who don't care two-pence about those sort of things."</p>

  <p>"I have never met one," de Barsac said cynically.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no more have I, but they exist. I see what you are driving at. If you
  could become engaged to Sylvia, or rather her money, then Lupas would
  wait."</p>

  <p>"A crude and brutal way of putting it," de Barsac said. "But perfectly
  logical. And I don't suppose you would mind, as long as you made a thousand
  or two out of it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not in the least. I am not likely to touch Sylvia's money in any
  other way. She wouldn't let me have a penny. She will go away from home and
  take her mother with her, and decline to have me under the same roof. I don't
  know anybody who can be more determined than Sylvia if she likes."</p>

  <p>De Barsac rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Then that's settled," he said cheerfully. "On the day that I marry your
  daughter I agree to pay you five thousand pounds. If I can't pay you in cash,
  I can, at any rate, turn out something that you can sell. Now, let's get on
  with it, shall we? I'll come over to your place to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dorn hesitated for a moment. He could see all the possibilities of this
  new development, but the more he thought of Sylvia and that amazing
  determination of hers, the less sanguine he became. As yet he had said
  nothing to de Barsac as to his encounter with Markham on the day before,
  except to drop a few hints to the effect that it might be just as well to be
  civil to the young man who was obviously left behind as a sort of watchdog
  for Gibson.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it won't do," he said. "You see, unfortunately, Sylvia is
  engaged already."</p>

  <p>"The devil she is," the startled de Barsac said. "Why didn't you tell me
  that before? What an infernally secretive chap you are! I suppose you have
  got some game of your own on?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," Dorn said. "On my honour I didn't know. I swear I
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, if you tell me that on your honour, of course I must believe
  you," de Barsac said.</p>

  <p>"That'll do," Dorn said, curtly. "We shall gain nothing by the pot and
  kettle business. I only knew yesterday afternoon, and that was by accident. I
  went over to Lanton Place in the afternoon, as you know, and I happened to
  surprise quite a sentimental little scene in the garden. My daughter with a
  young man's arm round her waist! It was a bit of a shock, because I hadn't
  associated Sylvia with that sort of thing. But there is no doubt of the fact
  that she is desperately in earnest. Those quiet girls always are. But that's
  not the worst of it. Who do you think the man was?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how should I know," de Barsac said.</p>

  <p>"Nobody but Markham. I was never more staggered in my life. It appears
  that he met Sylvia up in the north of England a year ago when she was on
  tour, and he fixed it up then. You can imagine how pleased I was. I tried the
  blustering heavy father business, but that didn't come off. Markham turned
  upon me and gave me a rare dressing down. To make a long story short, he
  knows all about my past, and all about yours too, for the matter of that. He
  spoke freely enough with regard to your dealings with Lupas, and he told me
  quite plainly that he knew exactly what had happened with regard to the
  stolen will. He even knew that you helped me in through your bedroom window
  that night. And he told me that if we hadn't been infernally clever, the
  money that is now Sylvia's would have been yours. I hadn't a leg to stand on.
  But he went further than that, De Barsac, he knows something."</p>

  <p>Dorn spoke the last words in a hissing whisper. Before de Barsac could
  reply, the door of the studio opened and Garrass entered with an open
  telegram in his hand.</p>

  <p>"From Sir Watney Gibson," Garrass said. "I am to tell you that he is
  coming back this evening."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; THE PICTURES.</h2>

  <p class="first">During these last few days Sir Watney had not been idle. He had spent a
  good deal of his time in the dingy little Wardour-street establishment,
  giving directions to the man Jonas, until the work in hand was finished to
  his satisfaction. And once that was done he took Jonas on one side and told
  that startled individual a strange story. When the story was finished certain
  moneys passed between the two men, and the clever naturalist was bound to
  secrecy.</p>

  <p>"Now, you quite understand," Sir Watney said. "Not one word of this must
  pass your lips until I give you notice to. It won't be for long, only a few
  days at the outside, and then you will be free to tell your story to any one.
  There must be at least a score of journalists in London who will be quite
  prepared to pay your price for it. But that will not be till afterwards. And
  when I say that I mean till after you have given your evidence. And, above
  all things, if anybody comes here asking questions, you have never seen Sir
  Watney Gibson. We might go a bit further and say you have never heard of him.
  And if anybody from the police comes here, all you have to do is to tell them
  to ring up 0056 Gerard, and the person at the other end of the wire will tell
  them everything. I don't suppose you will be bothered, because I have taken
  every precaution to prevent such a thing. But still, you never know. And now,
  one word in conclusion. About that cast. You'll have only made one, remember.
  Yes, I think that will do. Good morning."</p>

  <p>With this Sir Watney turned on his heel and made his way rapidly back to
  his own house. If de Barsac could have seen his serious face and set features
  at that moment, he would have been ready enough to reconsider the estimate he
  had made of the distinguished scientist. There was no longer a smile on his
  lips, no longer a merry light in those blue eyes of his, nothing but a stern
  determination of purpose.</p>

  <p>For the next hour or two he was closeted with Sergeant Gideon, who came to
  him with a mass of information in the shape of a daily diary that concerned
  the doings of an individual who was solely indicated by the letter X. Sir
  Watney read it through carefully, and nodded his approval.</p>

  <p>"You have done very well, Gideon," he said. "Very well indeed. So far as I
  can see, except when our man was in bed, you seem to have accounted for his
  movements almost hour by hour. Yes, I think this will serve my purpose. If it
  does, and I see no reason to doubt it, you may get a telephone message or a
  telegram from me at any moment after to-morrow, and when this comes, I ask
  you to act at once. Now listen."</p>

  <p>For the best part of half an hour, Sir Watney talked without a break. But
  he spoke clearly and quietly enough, without heat or passion, but with a
  terrible and merciless logic that carried absolute conviction to his
  interested listener. To a mind like that of Gideon, trained to every move of
  the criminal mind, there was not a single flaw to be detected in Sir Watney's
  logic. It was all theory, so far, but every thread of it was supported by
  cold concrete facts. When the recital was finished, Gideon grew
  enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>"You've got it, Sir Watney," he said. "You've got it beyond the shadow of
  a doubt. I can't see a single weak point in your case. And it's a complicated
  case enough, goodness knows. I have been mixed up with amazing and ingenious
  crimes for the last twenty years, but I don't recollect anything so weird as
  this. It's like one of Edgar Allan Poe's stories. Did you ever read them,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, many a time and oft," Sir Watney said. "And you can't tell me how
  often they have helped me in those criminal investigations of mine. If I had
  never read them, I should be the poorer mentally, and I flatter myself that
  Scotland Yard would have missed more than one of its greatest triumphs. And I
  think that will do, Gideon."</p>

  <p>"I should rather think it would, sir," the enthusiastic detective
  exclaimed. "Good-night, sir, and thank you very much for an object lesson in
  my own business."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney lunched in comfort and ease after a few days of strenuous
  business, and then spent half an hour or so on a ruminative cigar. He gave a
  few instructions to his servant and made his way leisurely to Paddington
  Station. By nine o'clock that evening he was back at Baron's Court, where
  Garrass had seen that a comfortable dinner awaited him, and after that, he
  sent for Markham.</p>

  <p>Lionel Markham came eagerly enough, anxious to know what had taken place,
  but he did not speak until he had assured himself that neither Dorn nor de
  Barsac was within earshot. According to their inevitable custom they had gone
  off to the studio, and in all probability they would not be seen again till
  bed-time. To all this Sir Watney listened with the air of one who is not
  particularly interested.</p>

  <p>"Well, my boy," he said, "And how have you been getting on the last few
  days? As I had no message from you, I concluded that there was no news."</p>

  <p>"Very little, sir," Markham replied. "One rather peculiar incident, but
  that only applied for me personally."</p>

  <p>"In that case, I had better have it," Sir Watney said drily. "In affairs
  like this one never quite knows how one detached incident reacts on
  another."</p>

  <p>In a few words Markham proceeded to tell his uncle of the encounter with
  Dorn in the garden at Lanton Place, and precisely what followed that none too
  friendly conversation.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that must have been a bit of a blow for Dorn," Sir Watney chuckled.
  "I suppose I must congratulate you, indeed I do, for Sylvia Dorn is a
  charming and delightful girl, and as opposite from that rascally father of
  hers as the poles. It's always nice to hear of a girl of that type getting
  hold of a good husband, and I'm sure you'll he that, Lionel."</p>

  <p>"I am going to try," Markham said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are. Now, let me see how this bears upon what I have been
  doing. It was very rash of you to let Dorn know how much you had found out.
  But I suppose on the spur of the moment you couldn't help it. It must have
  been a bitter disappointment to him, too, for I have not the slightest doubt
  that he and that other scoundrel de Barsac have some pretty scheme on hand
  for getting hold of the girl's money. But now that she is engaged to you
  there will be an end to all that. What's their present attitude to you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, they are civil enough," Markham said. "So far as de Barsac is
  concerned a good deal too civil."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney shook his wise old head sapiently.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that sounds bad," he said. "I don't like that a bit. Not that it much
  matters, because those two fellows have come pretty well to the end of their
  rope. As far as I can gather, another day or so will finish them entirely.
  Lionel, I have got to the bottom of the mystery. I am not going to tell you
  now what the solution is, but you shall hear it before many hours have
  passed. You shall hear me tell the story as I conceive it in the presence of
  Dorn and de Barsac. I want you to be there, because you are a pretty active
  young fellow, and they may be up to mischief. I have worked it all
  out&mdash;worked it out to the last detail. The average man in my position
  would wash his hands of it now, and turn it all over to the police. But,
  seeing that I am a student of criminology, I have a natural desire to carry
  this through myself. It's a most extraordinary story of a most amazing crime
  carried through in a most amazing way. In all of my complicated experience I
  have never met anything like it. As I said before, I am not going to unfold
  the drama until the audience is seated. Now, tell me, have you seen anything
  of Frick lately?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him yesterday," Markham replied. "But I have already told you that.
  I was out on the moor where they were busy taking pictures, and I saw both
  Frick and Hatton. The latter had got some wonderful new idea for using some
  of those animal pictures in connection with the big moorland drama."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney started slightly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really," he exclaimed. "Now, I wonder&mdash;I wonder&mdash;but I
  needn't go into that now. I had forgotten all about those pictures taken in
  the park. Do you happen to know whether they were successful or not?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, they haven't been developed," Markham said. "They did
  get a few, I know, but Mr. Bevill's unfortunate death put an end to that
  business altogether, so I believe the films were simply thrown on one side as
  being quite useless, or, at any rate, useless for the moment. Frick was only
  too anxious to get away to Lanton Place, and make up for lost time. It was
  lost time as far as he was concerned, and he was rather afraid that his
  directors would make a fuss about it. So, therefore, the films were thrown
  into a box and the whole concern moved on to Lanton Place."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney listened intently enough. He seemed to be strangely interested
  in these details.</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose they are still in the box?" he asked. "I mean still
  undeveloped."</p>

  <p>"They were yesterday afternoon," Markham said. "But, as I told you, Hatton
  had some brilliant idea that they might be worked into his big story, and
  when I left them they were just starting to develop the films. I was asked to
  stay, but as I was rather worried about that interview with Dorn, I declined.
  By the way, I had quite forgotten, Hatton and Frick are coming over this
  evening for a game of billiards, and they ought to turn up at any moment now.
  Then you can ask them for yourself."</p>

  <p>Almost as Markham spoke, the door of the dining-room opened and Garrass
  ushered in the expected visitors. It only needed one glance at Frick's face
  to see that something amazing had happened. He had lost that perennial smile
  of his, his ruddy cheeks were pale and his hands were unsteady. For once in
  his life Hatton was silent and distracted, standing behind his comrade in an
  attitude of doubt and agitation.</p>

  <p>"You are just in time, gentlemen," Sir Watney said. "We were just talking
  about you. Sit down."</p>

  <p>Frick crossed to the door, and after satisfying himself that no one was
  outside, closed it carefully. Then he produced a bulky envelope from his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"You have found something?" Sir Watney asked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed we have, Sir Watney," Frick whispered. "The most damnable thing
  that ever appeared on a picture."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII. &mdash; CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sir Watney Gibson barely moved from his seat. Quite coolly he took a cigar
  from his case and lighted it, and passed the case along to his visitors. They
  helped themselves almost mechanically, but stood there without lighting the
  cigars they had taken and waited for Gibson to speak.</p>

  <p>"Well, get on, gentlemen," he said. "You have come here to tell me
  something, or rather, to show me something, and I am quite curious to see it.
  Perhaps I may be able to tell you what it is."</p>

  <p>Frick pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"I know you are a wonderful man, Sir Watney," he said. "But I don't think
  you can tell me what's inside the envelope."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney waved his hand comprehensively.</p>

  <p>"They are pictures," Frick went on. "Pictures we developed a little time
  ago. Perhaps Mr. Markham has told you what they are."</p>

  <p>"He did say something about them," Gibson replied. "Photographs, I
  presume, taken in the park here. If so, I trust that they are
  successful."</p>

  <p>"So successful that they fairly startled us," Hatton interrupted. "I had
  hoped to have got an impression or two of some of those wild animals, but I
  never expected anything like this. Oh, yes, we got one or two good studies,
  and then suddenly these things came along. Now, Sir Watney, there are the
  negatives, and there are the prints. They are rather small because we haven't
  got any enlarging apparatus down here, but they are quite clear, and the
  figures are unmistakable. They must have been taken just as the sun was
  setting, with a fine bright light shining through the trees. A magnificent
  light, in fact. I should like you to take those pictures and look at them
  through a strong magnifying glass."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney Gibson rose and proceeded most carefully to lock the door.
  There was a small table in the corner of the dining-room on which stood a
  shaded electric lamp, the light of which he switched on, and then, taking a
  powerful glass from his pocket he made a long careful examination of the
  handful of little flimsy pieces of paper that lay before him. Hatton stood
  and looked over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You have not got them quite in proper rotation, Sir Watney," he said.
  "See here is a piece of film, perhaps a dozen photographs altogether, and all
  taken in a few seconds. Now, let me arrange the pictures one under the other,
  and then you shall tell me what you make of them."</p>

  <p>With this, Hatton proceeded to lay out the pictures in a line one under
  the other, until at length the sequence was complete. He had been speaking
  almost in a whisper and evidently under the stress of a great excitement.</p>

  <p>"Now, what do you see?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, in the first place, my old friend John Bevill, undoubtedly," Sir
  Watney said, as if speaking to himself. "He is standing in the little open
  space with something I can't quite make out by his side. Some blurred object.
  Yes. I see what it is now. It's Vim, just on the very edge of the picture.
  And then someone else comes along. Perhaps he comes out plainly in the next
  print. Yes, here he is, and the monkey has vanished. It's de Barsac."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney paused for a moment, and very gradually his forefinger trailed
  down the little line of pictures that lay before him. Gradually his voice
  sank.</p>

  <p>"De Barsac coming out from between the trees," he said. "Glancing about
  him as if afraid of being seen. He steps quietly behind Bevill, who is
  utterly unconscious of his presence. He carries something in his hand that
  looks like a thick but flexible stick. My God, that's it, is it? He strikes
  Bevill a murderous blow on the back of the head with the stick and thrusts it
  in his pocket. That is what you call a sandbag, I suppose. The poor old man
  struggles to his feet, and de Barsac clutches him by the throat. It's only
  for half a moment, and then he is down on his back with that scoundrel
  bending over him. He holds on with that murderous grip for a moment and then
  it is all over. Ah! That is all I needed. I never expected to get it, and I
  may tell you gentlemen now that I could have done without it. I have enough
  circumstantial evidence in my hands at the present time to hang de Barsac a
  dozen times over. But it is only circumstantial evidence, after all, and you
  never can quite tell what a clever lawyer will do with it. But here we have
  the whole crime taken by a witness that cannot lie. Small as those pictures
  are, there is no mistaking the figure of de Barsac, and that of my
  unfortunate friend John Bevill."</p>

  <p>"They are small pictures," Hatton said. "But, at the same time, they are
  wonderfully clear and accurate, and if we enlarge them, the whole truth will
  be plain to everybody. And if we throw them on the screen they will be
  amazing. What a series of pictures! Looking at them from a business point of
  view, they would fill all the cinema halls in England for months. Just fancy
  the actual presentment of the murder of Mr. John Bevill! But I beg your
  pardon, Sir Watney, I ought not to be talking like that. I was carried away
  for the moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's natural enough," Sir Watney said. "I can quite understand your
  professional feelings. I don't see why those pictures should not be exhibited
  some of these days. But for the present I shall ask you to leave them in my
  hands."</p>

  <p>"We brought them on purpose," Frick said.</p>

  <p>"That's very good of you. I shall pack them up to-night and send them with
  an explanatory letter to Scotland Yard. They will be an absolute supplement
  to the information I already have. I suppose you can see what the conspiracy
  is? If you don't understand, I had better explain. Most people regard de
  Barsac as a rich man. He ought to be, for he makes a big enough income. But
  he is reckless and extravagant, and very deeply in debt; indeed, I have every
  reason to believe that he obtained a large sum of money from a London
  money-lender by false pretence. If my information on this point is wrong,
  then it is the fault of Scotland Yard. But I can assure you, gentlemen,
  Scotland Yard does not make mistakes in these matters. De Barsac owes this
  money-lender a fortune, and if it is not repaid by a certain date, then he
  will be prosecuted. Now, unfortunately for my poor friend Bevill, he thought
  very highly of de Barsac, and meant to leave him forty thousand pounds. I can
  prove that de Barsac knew this, and I have proved to you that he was in
  urgent need of the money. And now you see why he anticipated events. He
  killed my poor friend, and by doing so thought he had made his own future
  safe. But he was far too clever, as I shall prove to you presently. He went
  to London, where he remained for a week. Everything he did exactly that week
  in known to me. Every movement of his was tracked by the police. When he came
  back here and reappeared in this very room at ten o'clock on the night of the
  murder he said he had just come down from town. And he had done nothing of
  the sort. He came down from London the day before on a motor-cycle that he
  had bought in Oxford-street. He came down in mackintoshes and goggles, and,
  thus disguised, hung about in the neighbourhood the whole day of the crime.
  What has become of the motor-cycle we shall find out. And now I come to my
  part of the tragedy. Everybody thinks that Mr. Bevill was killed by his pet
  chimpanzee. That was very cunningly worked by de Barsac, rather too cunningly
  worked, as a matter of fact. Still, it was a very clever piece of strategy,
  and if my suspicions had not been aroused, it would probably have thrown dust
  in everybody eyes. But don't forget it came out at the inquest that the real
  cause of John Bevill's death was a fracture of the skull. It might have been
  argued that the skull was fractured when the chimpanzee attacked him. It
  might have been caused by a violent contact with the root of a tree. But
  these photographs have spoilt that theory. And now I am going a little bit
  further. We will assume for a moment that the marks made by the chimpanzee on
  the throat of John Bevill really caused his death. And we will allow that
  those were the marks of Vim's powerful grip. And, in a way, gentlemen, that
  is strictly true."</p>

  <p>"Then how?" Frick asked. "How on earth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment," Sir Watney said, "I must go and fetch something. I won't
  keep you waiting long, and if anybody comes in the room when I am away, I
  will ask you to try and look as ordinary as you can under the
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>With this, Sir Watney proceeded to unlock the door and make his way up the
  stairs to his bedroom. He came back a little later with two objects in his
  hand. After he had locked the door he proceeded with his story.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen," he said. "This heavy object in bronze is an absolutely
  exact reproduction of Vim's hand and forearm. It is the work of de Barsac,
  and I should say that he has never done anything finer. He actually did it at
  my suggestion because I wanted it for a book I am writing. And I have not the
  slightest doubt that it was this piece of work that put that cunning scheme
  into de Barsac's head. He went to London, and, from the clay model of that
  finished bronze, he had a steel and leather glove made in imitation of Vim's
  paw. Here it is, or at least, here is a duplicate copy of it, made by the
  same man, a clever naturalist called Jonas who lives in Wardour-street. I
  found all this out, never mind how. And now, gentlemen, do you begin to see
  what took place?"</p>

  <p>"It's a bit foggy to me," Frick said.</p>

  <p>"To me it's as plain as daylight," Hatton cried. "But then, you see, I am
  a novelist. After de Barsac had cleared the ground, he took the first
  opportunity of putting his vile project into execution. Of course, he didn't
  expect to fracture the old gentleman's skull, he only wanted to stun him with
  that sandbag, which was an unaccustomed weapon in his hands, and, without
  knowing it, he must have hit his victim a bit too hard. Then, under the
  impression that he was safe, with that leather and steel glove on his hand,
  he left those marks on the throat of the man who was his friend. Oh dear yes,
  it's quite plain to me, Sir Watney. What a cunning plot, what a diabolical
  scheme that did not implicate any human being, only an unfortunate monkey
  that everybody is hunting down. I should like to shoot that scoundrel out of
  hand. May I venture to ask what you are going to do now, Sir Watney?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII. &mdash; FLIGHT.</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile, Dorn and de Barsac were spending the evening in the studio to
  which they always repaired after dinner, with a view to discussing the gloomy
  future. Naturally, they had no idea of the dramatic events which were taking
  place within a few yards of where they were seated. It was a beautiful night,
  with a considerable moon, almost a month from the night when John Bevill had
  met his death. It was warm, too, so that the studio windows were open and the
  blinds pulled on one side.</p>

  <p>For a long time the two scoundrels sat opposite one another, pulling
  moodily at the choice cigars which had been provided for them by the late
  kindly host and glancing at one another furtively from under their eyelids,
  as if each was trying to read the other's thoughts. It was plain enough that
  they were both ill at ease, especially de Barsac, who started at every sound,
  and glanced apprehensively through the open window.</p>

  <p>"What on earth's the matter with the man?" Dorn exclaimed impatiently.
  "You are as nervous as a child."</p>

  <p>"Ah, it's all very well for you to talk like that," de Barsac said. "But
  your position is very different to mine."</p>

  <p>It was the first time that he had intimated plainly the tragedy which had
  so long loomed over Baron's Court. It was, in itself, almost an admission of
  guilt.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of talking like that?" Dorn demanded. "You are safe
  enough. The man is dead and buried, and in a week or two the whole thing will
  be forgotten. Once those thick-headed farmers have managed to destroy the
  chimpanzee there will be no more to be said or done."</p>

  <p>De Barsac glanced about him moodily.</p>

  <p>"Ah, it's all very well for you to talk like that," he said. "But who
  suggested the idea? Who pointed out to me how comparatively easy the scheme
  was? Who stood in the background and pulled all the strings whilst I pulled
  all the chestnuts? And who is going to benefit to the extent of some
  thousands of pounds? And who would have benefited if that sentimental old
  idiot hadn't changed his mind? Look here, Dorn, I killed John Bevill, and you
  know it. And if the rope is ever put round my neck, I'll take damned good
  care it's round yours too. I'll not die by myself."</p>

  <p>A light of terror leapt into Dorn's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" he cried hoarsely. "Oh, you must be, and the windows open
  and all."</p>

  <p>"I don't care," de Barsac said recklessly. "I don't&mdash;good Heavens,
  what's that?"</p>

  <p>There was a sound of something moving outside amongst the leaves, and a
  moment later a queer face looked in through the open window. Then there was a
  chatter of rage, and the great brown shape of Vim came into the room. De
  Barsac jumped to his feet and, like a flash, drew a revolver from his pocket.
  He would have fired, but Dorn restrained him.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot," he whispered hoarsely. "We shall have the whole household
  round us if you do."</p>

  <p>There was no occasion, however, for, at the first sight of the shining
  muzzle, the sagacious chimpanzee leapt like a cat through the open window and
  vanished. Vim had learnt to his cost what a firearm meant. Trembling from
  head to foot, de Barsac dropped into his seat again.</p>

  <p>"That devil meant to kill me," he said hoarsely. "He knows, he knows
  perfectly well. He must have been very near at hand when I&mdash;when his
  master died. And he'll get me some of these days. How it is those farmers
  can't manage to shoot him I don't understand. And this is the second time he
  has been after me lately. I can't stand it much longer, Dorn. This business
  has shaken my nerves more than I can tell you. I am going to clear out; I am
  going to America. You must do the best you can. I have done."</p>

  <p>Dorn listened uneasily enough. De Barsac was in a state now to confess
  everything. What he would do on the other side of the water Dorn neither knew
  nor cared. The great plot had failed; there was no longer any chance of
  raising a penny-piece so far as Baron's Court was concerned. And this being
  the case, the sooner de Barsac was gone, the better. They had hardly settled
  down to discuss the details of this new idea before another face looked in at
  the window, and there, in the moonlight, they could see the sinister features
  of Henderby Lupas.</p>

  <p>"Ay, my Adonis," de Barsac said, with some attempt at swagger. "To what
  are we indebted for this late visit? But come inside, come inside."</p>

  <p>"Only for a moment then," Lupas said, as he climbed into the studio. "You
  are neither of you worth it, but I have come to warn you. The game is up. The
  whole story is known."</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" Dorn asked uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't try and fool me. I'll just ask de Barsac one question. Did you
  ever hear of a man called Jonas, a man who keeps a naturalist's shop in
  Wardour-street?"</p>

  <p>A queer cry came from de Barsac's lips.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"I do. Jonas happens to be one of my clients. I have got hundreds of them
  in London who owe me money. But Jonas is honest enough, but he is a dreamer
  and a poor man of business, and that's how he comes to be in my debt. He was
  with me a few days ago, asking for further time to pay off an instalment,
  and, as an inducement, told me that he had secured an important new customer
  who had promised him a good deal of work. Now, I like all sorts of
  information, and I pressed him to tell me who this customer was. He didn't
  want to tell me, but as I refused to give him more time unless he did so, he
  very unwillingly consented. Then I found it all out. The man he spoke of is
  no less than Sir Watney Gibson."</p>

  <p>De Barsac, with a pale face and lips that he strove in vain to keep
  steady, glanced across at Dorn, whose features were, if possible, more pallid
  than his own.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said hoarsely. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Is there any real necessity?" Lupas asked. "I don't want to say too much,
  and indeed, I have already told you more than is prudent. I don't want to get
  myself into trouble, and, at the same time, I don't want to lose my money. I
  have got a little scheme on hand which I will tell you presently, if de
  Barsac is ever lucky enough to reach a place of safety. I very much doubt it,
  but I am fond of my money, and I have taken the risk of being mixed up in a
  crime by coming down here."</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, get on," de Barsac said with dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well, if you will have it. Sir Watney Gibson went to Jonas, and
  left with him a bronze cast of a monkey's paw. That was your work, de Barsac,
  though Jonas didn't know it, and there is no occasion for me to say what
  particular ape that cast was taken from."</p>

  <p>De Barsac rocked backwards and forwards in his chair and groaned. It was
  plain to him now how the shadows were closing in on all sides, and how
  Gibson, with that amazing instinct of his for putting his finger on the right
  spot, had gone straight to the heart of the conspiracy. And as this came home
  to de Barsac, he glanced across at Dorn with an expression in his eyes that
  was absolutely murderous.</p>

  <p>"You devil!" he said. "You devil! Why did you tempt me to do this
  thing?"</p>

  <p>"Here, that will do," Lupas said uneasily. "You can keep these mutual
  recriminations till you are alone together. I have my suspicions, of course,
  but I don't want to sit quietly down here and listen to a confession of
  murder. Good Lord, fancy me being in the witness-box, and having it dragged
  out of me that I heard that remark."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," Dorn said soothingly. "We shall have to go, both of
  us will have to go. But go on, Lupas; tell us the worst."</p>

  <p>"There's very little left to tell," Lupas went on. "Sir Watney Gibson
  wanted that hand reproduced in leather and steel. Here, hold up, de
  Barsac."</p>

  <p>For de Barsac had fallen forward and lay half fainting in his chair. Then
  he pulled himself together and looked at the other two with wild, haggard
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't it enough?" Lupas demanded. "I can tell you a little more, if
  you like. When I had heard all this I looked up a broken-down police
  detective who does certain touting work and watching for me, and I got him to
  make inquiries. As a result of those inquiries, I discovered that de Barsac's
  movements all last week and the week before were successfully traced from the
  time he left here till the hour of his return. You were watched the whole
  time, de Barsac. They know all about that motor-cycle you bought in
  Oxford-street&mdash;but what's the good of going on? Now, have you got any
  money?"</p>

  <p>"Not five pounds in the world," de Barsac groaned.</p>

  <p>"And I am no better off," Dorn said. "Perhaps I could put my hand upon
  forty pounds. But what's the good of that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it'll take you both to Falmouth, anyway," Lupas said. "You had
  better get there as soon as possible and write to me in London. You will know
  how to write, and you can adopt any <i>nom-de-plume</i> you like. You can
  leave me to make all the other arrangements. And now I'm off."</p>

  <p>He disappeared abruptly, leaving the other two facing one another, until
  at length Dorn rose and moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I am going to get the little car out," he said. "We will drive across the
  moors and get to Falmouth that way. I'll take the car down to the end of the
  avenue, and you can join me in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>A little later on the car slid down the avenue through the open gates into
  the road where Dorn picked up his companion, and together they sped along in
  the moonlight. They did not see the brown shadow that rose from the hedge and
  the pair of red, vengeful eyes that followed them as they tore along the road
  in the direction of the open country.</p>

  <p>"Here, rouse yourself," Dorn said. "That ghastly face of yours would give
  you away anywhere. You would be arrested on suspicion by the first policeman
  you came past. We'll go round this way and make a wide detour and strike the
  moor road again by the other side of the waterfall. It's rather a dangerous
  road at this time at night, but we must risk that."</p>

  <p>They circled wide, going far out of their way at first, and as they turned
  inland again the brown shadow of Vim moved along in the moonlight with a grim
  determination of purpose and a resolution that had in it something human.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX. &mdash; WIPED OUT.</h2>

  <p class="first">The little car scouted round the edge of the park and from thence by the
  winding road on to the moor. This was a matter of a mile or two, and the road
  finally turned almost to the edge of the park again, so that anyone crossing
  it could have been in a position to cut the car off before it left the
  precincts of the house. But once this was done the long wide thoroughfare
  stretched away in the moonlight for miles and miles towards the south-west.
  It was a somewhat narrow track, by no means good for motor traffic, but then,
  on the other hand, it was a lonely road with no hedge on either side, and
  little chance of encountering traffic. Then the road wound again in
  serpentine fashion, so that the best part of an hour elapsed with Dorn and de
  Barsac barely ten miles on their way.</p>

  <p>For a long time they hardly spoke to one another, each apparently wrapped
  in his own gloomy thoughts. They were close together, and yet entirely far
  apart, each wondering what the other was thinking, and each full of suspicion
  and mistrust. It was de Barsac who spoke at length. He had the wheel in his
  hand, and Dorn was huddled down by his side.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think," Dorn said. "I am still wondering if we have
  done the right thing. And if I am not wrong, it isn't too late yet."</p>

  <p>"What, to go back?" de Barsac asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? Nothing is known, nothing can possibly be known. You have
  only got&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, it's all very well for you," de Barsac growled. "You are all right,
  or at least you think so. But not if I like to speak. I am not going to
  shoulder it all."</p>

  <p>Dorn was silent for a little while. He was carefully weighing up his
  chances. So far as he could see, there was no case against him. He knew all
  about that black tragedy; he had known all about it from the first. It was
  he, with his superior cunning, who had suggested the whole thing to de
  Barsac. He remembered vividly enough how he had led up to it, and how the
  scheme had occurred to him that night at dinner when de Barsac had proudly
  produced the bronze cast of the monkey's paw. He recollected how pleased he
  had been when the idea first occurred to him, and how, by slow degrees, he
  had unfolded the whole diabolical conspiracy to his companion. De Barsac had
  demurred at first; he had placed a hundred difficulties in the way; but
  gradually, as the desperate condition of his affairs had been painted by Dorn
  in gloomy colours, he had come round the the plan, and finally accepted it
  with something like enthusiasm. And he had done every bit himself, Dorn had
  seen to that. He had gone to town, where he had had that cast made, or
  rather, reproduced in steel and leather, he had seen to every detail without
  so much as Dorn moving a hand. And finally, in the park, in strict solitude,
  as he thought, he had dealt John Bevill the fatal blow that was to mean
  freedom for himself.</p>

  <p>No, the more Dorn thought it over, the more sure he felt that no blame
  could be attached to him. He was bitterly contemptuous of the cowardice which
  had caused him to turn his back on Baron's Court and fly like a criminal. He
  saw now that he had been carried away by Lupas' dramatic disclosure, and he
  began to see that it would have been better had he remained. De Barsac,
  watching him furtively from time to time, seemed to see what was passing in
  his companion's mind.</p>

  <p>"You want to leave me, do you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?" Dorn asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. I&mdash;I feel it. Well, you can please yourself. But
  don't forget that I can reach you wherever I am. If anything happens to me, I
  shall tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I shall
  tell them that the scheme was yours. It will be useless for you to deny it.
  Now, what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>Dorn moved uneasily in his seat.</p>

  <p>"Let's talk it over," he said. "We can go on to Falmouth just the same. If
  we stay there a day or two, no one will ask us any questions. Now, what have
  you got to be afraid of? Where's the evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, that's all right from your point of view. But you heard what
  Lupas said. Every movement I made in London is known to the police, and, of
  course, to Gibson. He put them on to me. He guessed how those marks came on
  Bevill's throat. Heaven only knows how, but you may depend upon it he saw
  through our scheme, and set to work on his theory. It was a bit of sheer bad
  luck for me when Gibson found out that I had been to Jonas. And you may be
  absolutely certain that Jonas told him all about the commission he was
  carrying out for me. Of course he did. And, once that was done, Gibson would
  be quite clear in his mind. Oh, there's no way out."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," Dorn said. "You can deny it. They can't prove anything.
  Surely we can invent some plausible reason why you went to Jonas. You are a
  sculptor, and you might have wanted that model for any purpose. Leave it to
  me, I will think of something ingenious. And then all you've got to do is to
  brazen the whole thing out."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean well enough," de Barsac muttered; "but you are not looking
  facts in the face. Of course, no one can prove I was in the park that night,
  that fact never will be proved. It isn't enough, Dorn, it isn't enough. What
  am I going to say about my movements in London? What excuse can I offer for
  putting up in a little public-house on the Thames? And how about that
  motor-cycle I bought, which is now at the bottom of the lake in the middle of
  the park, together with my goggles and mackintosh. Why should I want to sneak
  from London in that way and then turn from Baron's Court in the night of
  Bevill's death and tell everybody I have just come back by train? Your scheme
  was too clever. I ought to have gone back to town again by the way I came. My
  game was to say I had read all about Bevill's death in the papers. But it's
  no use crying over spilt milk. It's done now. And again, there's all that
  business of the missing will under which I was to benefit to a big extent.
  The police will investigate my affairs, and it won't take them many days to
  discover how desperately in need of money I am. And yet it looks so plain, so
  easy to place the deed on the shoulders of the chimpanzee, especially after
  he had attacked his master twice. No, we must go on, Dorn, we must go on. You
  play the game with me, and I'll play it with you. Stick to me as long as
  there is any necessity, and I won't let you down."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am going to do that," Dorn said. "But, in spite of all you say, I
  still think that you have everything to gain by facing it out. How do you
  expect to get away? It's all very well for Lupas to promise all sorts of
  things, but he can't carry them out, and if he sees the slightest danger to
  himself he won't hesitate to throw us to the dogs. If what you say is
  correct, all England will ring with this business in a few hours. No, you
  take my advice. Lie up for a day or two in Falmouth and then we can come
  back."</p>

  <p>"Thinking about yourself," de Barsac sneered. "Thinking about yourself, so
  you can stand by and pretend that you knew nothing at all about it. And when
  I am dead and gone, you can whine and snivel to everybody you meet and tell
  them how sorry you are that you ever met Victor de Barsac. And all the while
  this never would have happened if I hadn't listened to you. It was your
  scheme from first to last, you dirty dog, and well you know it. Besides, they
  may have found out other things."</p>

  <p>De Barsac scarcely knew how true this was. As yet, the story of the
  pictures was not known to those two men pushing their way across the country
  in the moonlight, two fugitives from justice with the bloodhounds of the Law
  already upon their track had they only known it. And so they pursued their
  way for some minutes in silence, until they came to a spot eight or ten miles
  from Baron's Court where the road narrowed between two high banks that formed
  a cliff on either side which gave a little farther on until it shelved down
  to a little bridge over a stream that ran in the valley some sixty feet
  below. It was no more than a shining silver thread now, for the hot summer
  had dried up the stream so that it trickled over its rocky bed whispering as
  it went. The bridge was barely wide enough to admit the passing of the car,
  and the parapet on the left side was barely a foot in height. It was by no
  means a safe passage in the dark&mdash;in fact, a highly dangerous
  one&mdash;but it was easy enough in the moonlight with a certain amount of
  care, so that de Barsac slowed up slightly as the car began to climb the
  slight incline to the crown of the bridge.</p>

  <p>Just as it reached the crest, a shadow seemed to move slowly down the
  rocky bank on the right, a shadow that grew nearer and nearer until it seemed
  to rise sheer of the rock and come down heavily right into the car. It was a
  heavy body, heavy indeed, but the impact was singularly light. De Barsac was
  conscious of a warm brown, hairy body clinging about his neck and shoulders;
  he saw two long hairy arms reaching down to the steering wheel.</p>

  <p>Then, as he realised what had happened, a strangled cry broke from his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Here, Dorn," he cried. "Pull that brute off my shoulders. By heavens,
  it's that infernal monkey."</p>

  <p>De Barsac spoke truly enough. With an effort he got the wheel in his hand
  again and tried to steer the swaying car close against the wall of rock. Then
  the long brown hand over his own gasped the wheel again and tugged at it
  viciously. Almost unconsciously, de Barsac had put his foot upon the
  accelerator so that the car shoved forward and, at the same time, turned
  sharply to the left. It crashed against the low stone parapet, and a second
  later fell hideously down those sixty feet to the dry bed of the river below.
  It was all over in less time than it takes to tell. The two men dropped out
  of the car like flies, crashing on the rocks below with the overturned car
  upon them. As it went down over the parapet, Vim made a big leap for safety,
  and swung clear on the branch of an overhanging tree. Then, presently, as
  there was no sound from below he made his way down to where those two bodies
  were lying stark and white in the moonlight. His teeth chattered and he
  showed them in a horrible grin. Then he turned away and swiftly crossed the
  moors; smiling to himself as if at a good deed well done.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>CHAPTER XL. &mdash; ALL SAID AND DONE.</h2>

  <p class="first">It was Sir Watney who first discovered that there was something wrong. He
  had been seated for an hour or more in the dining-room at Baron's Court,
  working out the problem to its last details and making up his mind what to do
  next. His first impulse was to call up Scotland Yard on the telephone, but he
  reflected that the telephone at Baron's Court was in a public place, and
  therefore it would be perhaps imprudent to discuss these startling details in
  the hearing of anyone. He would go over to the studio and see what he could
  do with the two men who were closeted there. Not that he expected much from
  this course, but he might see some signs of guilt on the part of these two
  scoundrels. And, besides, Gibson had no doubt in his mind that Dorn was as
  deep in the business as de Barsac. He hoped not for the sake of Sylvia and
  Markham, but whatever happened as far as these two were concerned, it seemed
  to Sir Watney that his duty lay plainly before him.</p>

  <p>"Stay here a moment," he said, "I'll just go over to the studio and ask
  Mr. de Barsac and Major Dorn to join us. They may possibly be
  interested."</p>

  <p>Sir Watney came back in a few moments with the information that the studio
  was empty, and a little later Garrass appeared with the statement that the
  small car was missing and that Dorn and de Barsac had gone off in a great
  hurry, telling the head chauffeur that they had been called to Falmouth on
  business. Sir Watney listened gravely enough till Garrass had gone.</p>

  <p>"The birds have flown, gentlemen," he said. "Either they must have been
  listening outside and heard what we were saying, or some kind friend has
  given them a warning. At any rate, they have gone, and, for the moment,
  there's nothing more to be done or said. We must wait till the morning. Now,
  I trust you gentlemen will say nothing of this."</p>

  <p>Frick and Hatton went off a few minutes later with a promise to say
  nothing of what they had heard until the police approached them, and once the
  servants had retired and the house was quiet, Sir Watney got London on the
  telephone. It took some little time on a particularly bad line to explain
  what had happened, but it was finished at length, and Sir Watney was free to
  return to the dining-room, where Markham awaited him.</p>

  <p>"Well, were you successful?" Markham asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I managed to make them understand. One of the big men from the
  Yard will be here to-morrow. Of course, Lionel, you realise what all this
  means?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," Markham said gravely. "Those two rascals have found out that
  we know everything and they have flown. It is a terrible thing altogether,
  and what I am to say to Sylvia I don't know. What can I say?"</p>

  <p>"We must hope for the best," Sir Watney replied. "We will try and spare
  the poor girl as much scandal as possible. But, you see, Dorn having gone off
  with de Barsac, practically admits his guilt. There's not the slightest doubt
  that those two men were in it together, and, in all probability, the scheme
  was Dorn's. He's far the more cunning rascal of the two. Let's hope that they
  try and get away. And if, perchance, some accident overtakes them, as it
  might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Markham shook his head hopelessly. There was nothing for it now but to go
  to bed and wait events on the morrow. It was late before Markham and Sir
  Watney were down, and when they came it was only to find a white-faced farmer
  and his shepherd in the dining-room with startling news.</p>

  <p>It was soon told. At dawn the shepherd, crossing the moor in search of
  some lost sheep with his dog, had come across a broken motor-car lying in the
  bottom of the gully on the Falmouth road. It was plain to him that the car
  had run off the track and had collapsed at the bottom of the ravine. It was
  the dog who had first called the shepherd's attention to the fact that there
  was something under the car, and, after a good deal of trouble, the shepherd
  had managed to remove the chassis and, to his horror, had discovered two
  bodies underneath. They were quite dead, and so far as the scared labourer
  could judge they had been dead for many hours. Sir Watney listened with a
  grave face, but with something like hope in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"This is very disturbing," he said. "But why do you come here? What's it
  got to do with Baron's Court?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," the farmer said, "it was Mr. Bevill's car. I have seen it a
  score of times. And I happen to know that those two gentlemen who were killed
  were staying here. One of them was a foreigner, but I forget his name."</p>

  <p>"Was it de Barsac?" Sir Watney asked.</p>

  <p>"That's it, sir&mdash;de Barsac. And the other gentleman is known by
  everybody in these parts. Better known than trusted, if I may be allowed to
  say so. It's Major Dorn, who lives over at Lanton Place."</p>

  <p>In spite of himself, Sir Watney breathed a little more easily. It was
  quite clear that what he had hoped for had come about, and he began to see
  his way clear to keep Sylvia's name out of the scandal. The truth about de
  Barsac would have to be told, of course, but there was no evidence against
  the other man, nor was there likely to be now.</p>

  <p>"What have you done with the bodies?" Gibson asked.</p>

  <p>"We brought them along here in a cart," the farmer explained. "One of the
  servants told us to put them in what he calls the studio. So we can't tell
  you any more than we have, sir. And if you don't mind now, we'll get back. I
  suppose, we shall have to come over for the inquest?"</p>

  <p>The inquest was held late that evening, and the usual verdict was brought
  in. No one knew how the accident happened, and no one could guess except that
  the car had probably skidded on the bridge and had gone over the low parapet.
  Two leading officials of Scotland Yard sat gravely by when the evidence was
  being given, but no comment came from them, neither did they speak until the
  proceedings had terminated and they were alone in the library with Sir
  Watney.</p>

  <p>He told them all that he had discovered, link by link, and chain by chain
  until his case was complete. There was not the semblance of a weak spot in it
  anywhere, so far as the detectives could see and when Sir Watney had finished
  they congratulated him warmly on what he had done.</p>

  <p>"And that's about the end of it, sir," the chief detective said. "The most
  extraordinary case that ever came under my notice. They were probably both in
  it, though naturally we can't be sure as far as Major Dorn was concerned. Of
  course, Sir Watney, you won't mind if we tell all this to the press&mdash;in
  fact, we've got to do it. We must clear the thing up properly. We can't leave
  anybody to be the victim of local gossip. And it seems to me that you have
  cleared everybody, including that monkey. I'd like to see him."</p>

  <p>It was indeed a strange case, vividly told, that filled hundreds of
  columns in the newspapers on the following day. The story excited a
  widespread interest from one end of the country to the other and before
  another twenty-four hours had elapsed large sums of money were being offered
  for Vim from various music-hall entertainers. But Vim, who strangely enough
  had come back home early in the morning following the death of de Barsac and
  Dorn, and was now seated quietly enough in his accustomed spot, was not
  destined to create sensation on any music-hall stage, for Frick and Hatton
  had put in a first claim and had already arranged for that most intelligent
  ape to be transferred to the cinematograph company.</p>

  <p>"He has taken a great fancy to me," Frick said. "He will follow me
  anywhere. As you know, Sir Watney, it was I who found him in the park and
  brought him home. He came up to me like a child, and he has been following me
  about ever since. I believe he knows that justice has to been done."</p>

  <p>And indeed, it seemed like it, for Vim sat at Frick's feet chattering and
  smiling, and obviously pleased to find himself at peace with the world
  again.</p>

  <p>There was much to be done during the next few days, amongst other things
  John Bevill's bequests to be attended to. He had left Baron's Court and the
  greater portion of his fortune to fund a sort of practical natural history
  university. There were big legacies to his niece and servants, and, of course
  the money left to Sylvia besides. The best part of a fortnight had elapsed
  before Sir Watney felt himself free to leave Baron's Court and return to
  London.</p>

  <p>"You had better stay and clear up the odds and ends," he said to Markham.
  "And, by the way, how are the people at Lanton Place? I am sorry to say, I
  had almost forgotten them. What arrangements have you and Sylvia made?"</p>

  <p>"I have hardly seen her since the day of her father's funeral," Markham
  explained. "She was very much distressed, of course, but it would be mere
  hypocrisy to say that she had any great sorrow. But we have made no
  arrangements. She is quite rich now, and I am correspondingly poor, and that
  being so I shall have to wait."</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion to do anything of the sort," Sir Watney said. "Why
  should you wait? Some of these days you will be comparatively rich yourself.
  You'll have all my money, anyhow. And that being the case, I don't see why
  you shouldn't have some of it now. Go and tell her so."</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant meeting for Sylvia and Markham, and none the less
  pleasant because it was quiet and restrained.</p>

  <p>"There is really nothing to wait for now," Markham said. "You must get rid
  of this dreary old place. Those cinematograph people are prepared to buy it,
  I know, and it will be a fine opportunity for your mother to get away from
  here. She must come with us of course; she must live with us as long as she
  lives. Does she understand things at all? Did you make her understand, for
  instance, that the black box was empty?"</p>

  <p>"I did," Sylvia said. "I made her comprehend that she had been robbed, and
  since she has got that into her mind, she has been quite different. She never
  goes near the ruins now. And since my father's death she has begun to rest. I
  believe if we can get her away from here she will be quite normal again."</p>

  <p>"Then there's nothing to stop us," Markham said. "The sooner we get away
  from here the better I shall be pleased. And you won't keep me waiting long,
  Sylvia, will you?"</p>

  <p>She placed her hands upon his shoulders and raised those clear eyes of
  hers to his. And as he bent and kissed her all the shadows vanished and all
  the world seemed full of light.</p>
