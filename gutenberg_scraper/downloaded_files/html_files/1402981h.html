  <h2><a name="c1"
     id="c1"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE peculiar construction of the first four stories in the
  present collection will probably strike both reader and critic and seem to
  call for some explanation, which I accordingly proceed to supply.</p>

  <p>In the conventional "detective story" the interest is made to focus on the
  question, "Who did it?" The identity of the criminal is a secret that is
  jealously guarded up to the very end of the book, and its disclosure forms
  the final climax.</p>

  <p>This I have always regarded as somewhat of a mistake. In real life, the
  identity of the criminal is a question of supreme importance for practical
  reasons; but in fiction, where no such reasons exist, I conceive the interest
  of the reader to be engaged chiefly by the demonstration of unexpected
  consequences of simple actions, of unsuspected causal connections, and by the
  evolution of an ordered train of evidence from a mass of facts apparently
  incoherent and unrelated. The reader's curiosity is concerned not so much
  with the question "Who did it?" as with the question "How was the discovery
  achieved?" That is to say, the ingenious reader is interested more in the
  intermediate action than in the ultimate result.</p>

  <p>The offer by a popular author of a prize to the reader who should identify
  the criminal in a certain "detective story," exhibiting as it did the
  opposite view, suggested to me an interesting question.</p>

  <p>Would it be possible to write a detective story in which from the outset
  the reader was taken entirely into the author's confidence, was made an
  actual witness of the crime and furnished with every fact that could possibly
  be used in its detection? Would there be any story left when the reader had
  all the facts? I believed that there would; and as an experiment to test the
  justice of my belief, I wrote "The Case of Oscar Brodski." Here the usual
  conditions are reversed; the reader knows everything, the detective knows
  nothing, and the interest focuses on the unexpected significance of trivial
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>By excellent judges on both sides of the Atlantic&mdash;including the
  editor of 'Pearson's Magazine'&mdash;this story was so far approved of that I
  was invited to produce others of the same type.</p>

  <p>Three more were written and are here included together with one of the
  more orthodox characters, so that the reader can judge of the respective
  merits of the two methods of narration.</p>

  <p>Nautical readers will observe that I have taken the liberty (for obvious
  reasons connected with the law of libel) of planting a screw-pile lighthouse
  on the Girdler Sand in place of the light-vessel. I mention the matter to
  forestall criticism and save readers the trouble of writing to point out the
  error.</p>

  <h2><a name="c2"
     id="c2"></a>I. &mdash; THE CASE OF OSCAR BRODSKI</h2>

  <h3>PART I. &mdash; THE MECHANISM OF CRIME</h3>

  <p>A SURPRISING amount of nonsense has been talked about conscience. On the
  one hand remorse (or the "again-bite," as certain scholars of ultra-Teutonic
  leanings would prefer to call it); on the other hand "an easy conscience":
  these have been accepted as the determining factors of happiness or the
  reverse.</p>

  <p>Of course there is an element of truth in the "easy conscience" view, but
  it begs the whole question. A particularly hardy conscience may be quite easy
  under the most unfavourable conditions&mdash;conditions in which the more
  feeble conscience might be severely afflicted with the "again-bite." And,
  then, it seems to be the fact that some fortunate persons have no conscience
  at all; a negative gift that raises them above the mental vicissitudes of the
  common herd of humanity.</p>

  <p>Now, Silas Hickler was a case in point. No one, looking into his cheerful,
  round face, beaming with benevolence and wreathed in perpetual smiles, would
  have imagined him to be a criminal. Least of all, his worthy, high-church
  housekeeper, who was a witness to his unvarying amiability, who constantly
  heard him carolling light-heartedly about the house and noted his
  appreciative zest at meal-times.</p>

  <p>Yet it is a fact that Silas earned his modest, though comfortable, income
  by the gentle art of burglary. A precarious trade and risky withal, yet not
  so very hazardous if pursued with judgment and moderation. And Silas was
  eminently a man of judgment. He worked invariably alone. He kept his own
  counsel. No confederate had he to turn King's Evidence at a pinch; no one he
  knew would bounce off in a fit of temper to Scotland Yard. Nor was he greedy
  and thriftless, as most criminals are. His "scoops" were few and far between,
  carefully planned, secretly executed, and the proceeds judiciously invested
  in "weekly property."</p>

  <p>In early life Silas had been connected with the diamond industry, and he
  still did a little rather irregular dealing. In the trade he was suspected of
  transactions with I.D.B.'s, and one or two indiscreet dealers had gone so far
  as to whisper the ominous word "fence." But Silas smiled a benevolent smile
  and went his way. He knew what he knew, and his clients in Amsterdam were not
  inquisitive.</p>

  <p>Such was Silas Hickler. As he strolled round his garden in the dusk of an
  October evening, he seemed the very type of modest, middle-class prosperity.
  He was dressed in the travelling suit that he wore on his little continental
  trips; his bag was packed and stood in readiness on the sitting-room sofa. A
  parcel of diamonds (purchased honestly, though without impertinent questions,
  at Southampton) was in the inside pocket of his waistcoat, and another more
  valuable parcel was stowed in a cavity in the heel of his right boot. In an
  hour and a half it would be time for him to set out to catch the boat train
  at the junction; meanwhile there was nothing to do but to stroll round the
  fading garden and consider how he should invest the proceeds of the impending
  deal. His housekeeper had gone over to Welham for the week's shopping, and
  would probably not be back until eleven o'clock. He was alone in the premises
  and just a trifle dull.</p>

  <p>He was about to turn into the house when his ear caught the sound of
  footsteps on the unmade road that passed the end of the garden. He paused and
  listened. There was no other dwelling near, and the road led nowhere, fading
  away into the waste land beyond the house. Could this be a visitor? It seemed
  unlikely, for visitors were few at Silas Hickler's house. Meanwhile the
  footsteps continued to approach, ringing out with increasing loudness on the
  hard, stony path.</p>

  <p>Silas strolled down to the gate, and, leaning on it, looked out with some
  curiosity. Presently a glow of light showed him the face of a man, apparently
  lighting his pipe; then a dim figure detached itself from the enveloping
  gloom, advanced towards him and halted opposite the garden. The stranger
  removed a cigarette from his mouth and, blowing out a cloud of smoke,
  asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me if this road will take me to Badsham Junction?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Hickler, "but there is a footpath farther on that leads to
  the station."</p>

  <p>"Footpath!" growled the stranger. "I've had enough of footpaths. I came
  down from town to Catley intending to walk across to the junction. I started
  along the road, and then some fool directed me to a short cut, with the
  result that I have been blundering about in the dark for the last half-hour.
  My sight isn't very good, you know," he added.</p>

  <p>"What train do you want to catch?" asked Hickler.</p>

  <p>"Seven fifty-eight," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"I am going to catch that train myself," said Silas, "but I shan't be
  starting for another hour. The station is only three-quarters of a mile from
  here. If you like to come in and take a rest, we can walk down together and
  then you'll be sure of not missing your way."</p>

  <p>"It's very good of you," said the stranger, peering, with spectacled eyes,
  at the dark house, "but&mdash;I think&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Might as well wait here as at the station," said Silas in his genial way,
  holding the gate open, and the stranger, after a momentary hesitation,
  entered and, flinging away his cigarette, followed him to the door of the
  cottage.</p>

  <p>The sitting-room was in darkness, save for the dull glow of the expiring
  fire, but, entering before his guest, Silas applied a match to the lamp that
  hung from the ceiling. As the flame leaped up, flooding the little interior
  with light, the two men regarded one another with mutual curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Brodski, by Jingo!" was Hickler's silent commentary, as he looked at his
  guest. "Doesn't know me, evidently&mdash;wouldn't, of course, after all these
  years and with his bad eyesight. Take a seat, sir," he added aloud. "Will you
  join me in a little refreshment to while away the time?"</p>

  <p>Brodski murmured an indistinct acceptance, and, as his host turned to open
  a cupboard, he deposited his hat (a hard, grey felt) on a chair in a corner,
  placed his bag on the edge of the table, resting his umbrella against it, and
  sat down in a small arm-chair.</p>

  <p>"Have a biscuit?" said Hickler, as he placed a whisky-bottle on the table
  together with a couple of his best star-pattern tumblers and a siphon.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, I think I will," said Brodski. "The railway journey and all this
  confounded tramping about, you know&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Silas. "Doesn't do to start with an empty stomach. Hope you
  don't mind oat-cakes; I see they're the only biscuits I have."</p>

  <p>Brodski hastened to assure him that oat-cakes were his special and
  peculiar fancy, and in confirmation, having mixed himself a stiff jorum, he
  fell to upon the biscuits with evident gusto.</p>

  <p>Brodski was a deliberate feeder, and at present appeared to be somewhat
  sharp set. His measured munching being unfavourable to conversation, most of
  the talking fell to Silas; and, for once, that genial transgressor found the
  task embarrassing. The natural thing would have been to discuss his guest's
  destination and perhaps the object of his journey; but this was precisely
  what Hickler avoided doing. For he knew both, and instinct told him to keep
  his knowledge to himself.</p>

  <p>Brodski was a diamond merchant of considerable reputation, and in a large
  way of business. He bought stones principally in the rough, and of these he
  was a most excellent judge. His fancy was for stones of somewhat unusual size
  and value, and it was well known to be his custom, when he had accumulated a
  sufficient stock, to carry them himself to Amsterdam and supervise the
  cutting of the rough stones. Of this Hickler was aware, and he had no doubt
  that Brodski was now starting on one of his periodical excursions; that
  somewhere in the recesses of his rather shabby clothing was concealed a paper
  packet possibly worth several thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>Brodski sat by the table munching monotonously and talking little. Hickler
  sat opposite him, talking nervously and rather wildly at times, and watching
  his guest with a growing fascination. Precious stones, and especially
  diamonds, were Hickler's specialty. "Hard stuff"&mdash;silver plate&mdash;he
  avoided entirely; gold, excepting in the form of specie, he seldom touched;
  but stones, of which he could carry off a whole consignment in the heel of
  his boot and dispose of with absolute safety, formed the staple of his
  industry. And here was a man sitting opposite him with a parcel in his pocket
  containing the equivalent of a dozen of his most successful "scoops;" stones
  worth perhaps&mdash;? Here he pulled himself up short and began to talk
  rapidly, though without much coherence. For, even as he talked, other Words,
  formed subconsciously, seemed to insinuate themselves into the interstices of
  the sentences, and to carry on a parallel train of thought.</p>

  <p>"Gets chilly in the evenings now, doesn't it?" said Hickler.</p>

  <p>"It does indeed," Brodski agreed, and then resumed his slow munching,
  breathing audibly through his nose.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand at least," the subconscious train of thought resumed;
  "probably six or seven, perhaps ten." Silas fidgeted in his chair and
  endeavoured to concentrate his ideas on some topic of interest. He was
  growing disagreeably conscious of a new and unfamiliar state of mind.</p>

  <p>"Do you take any interest in gardening?", he asked. Next to diamonds and
  weekly "property," his besetting weakness was fuchsias.</p>

  <p>Brodski chuckled sourly. "Hatton Garden is the nearest approach&mdash;?"
  He broke off suddenly, and then added, "I am a Londoner, you know."</p>

  <p>The abrupt break in the sentence was not unnoticed by Silas, nor had he
  any difficulty in interpreting it. A man who carries untold wealth upon his
  person must needs be wary in his speech.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered absently, "it's hardly a Londoner's hobby." And then,
  half consciously, he began a rapid calculation. Put it at five thousand
  pounds. What would that represent in weekly property? His last set of houses
  had cost two hundred and fifty pounds apiece, and he had let them at ten
  shillings and sixpence a week. At that rate, five thousand pounds represented
  twenty houses at ten and sixpence a week&mdash;say ten pounds a
  week&mdash;one pound eight shillings a day&mdash;five hundred and twenty
  pounds a year&mdash;for life. It was a competency. Added to what he already
  had, it was wealth. With that income he could fling the tools of his trade
  into the river and live out the remainder of his life in comfort and
  security.</p>

  <p>He glanced furtively at his guest across the table, and then looked away
  quickly as he felt stirring within him an impulse the nature of which he
  could not mistake. This must be put an end to. Crimes against the person he
  had always looked upon as sheer insanity. There was, it is true, that little
  affair of the Weybridge policeman, but that was unforeseen and unavoidable,
  and it was the constable's doing after all. And there was the old housekeeper
  at Epsom, too, but, of course, if the old idiot would shriek in that insane
  fashion&mdash;well, it was an accident, very regrettable, to be sure, and no
  one could be more sorry for the mishap than himself. But deliberate
  homicide!&mdash;robbery from the person! It was the act of a stark
  lunatic.</p>

  <p>Of course, if he had happened to be that sort of person, here was the
  opportunity of a lifetime. The immense booty, the empty house, the solitary
  neighbourhood, away from the main road and from other habitations; the time,
  the darkness&mdash;but, of course, there was the body to be thought of; that
  was always the difficulty. What to do with the body? Here he caught the
  shriek of the up express, rounding the curve in the line that ran past the
  waste land at the back of the house. The sound started a new train of
  thought, and, as he followed it out, his eyes fixed themselves on the
  unconscious and taciturn Brodski, as he sat thoughtfully sipping his whisky.
  At length, averting his gaze with an effort, he rose suddenly from his chair
  and turned to look at the clock on the mantelpiece, spreading out his hands
  before the dying fire. A tumult of strange sensations warned him to leave the
  house. He shivered slightly, though he was rather hot than chilly, and,
  turning his head, looked at the door.</p>

  <p>"Seems to be a confounded draught," he said, with another slight shiver;
  "did I shut the door properly, I wonder?" He strode across the room and,
  opening the door wide, looked out into the dark garden. A desire, sudden and
  urgent, had come over him to get out into the open air, to be on the road and
  have done with this madness that was knocking at the door of his brain.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it is worth while to start yet," he said, with a yearning
  glance at the murky, starless sky.</p>

  <p>Brodski roused himself and looked round. "Is your clock right?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Silas reluctantly admitted that it was.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take us to walk to the station?" inquired Brodski.</p>

  <p>"Oh, about twenty-five minutes to half-an-hour," replied Silas,
  unconsciously exaggerating the distance.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodski, "we've got more than an hour yet, and it's more
  comfortable here than hanging about the station. I don't see the use of
  starting before we need."</p>

  <p>"No; of course not," Silas agreed. A wave of strange emotion,
  half-regretful, half-triumphant, surged through his brain. For some moments
  he remained standing on the threshold, looking out dreamily into the night.
  Then he softly closed the door; and, seemingly without the exercise of his
  volition, the key turned noiselessly in the lock.</p>

  <p>He returned to his chair and tried to open a conversation with the
  taciturn Brodski, but the words came faltering and disjointed. He felt his
  face growing hot, his brain full and intense, and there was a faint,
  high-pitched singing in his ears. He was conscious of watching his guest with
  a new and fearful interest, and, by sheer force of will, turned away his
  eyes; only to find them a moment later involuntarily returning to fix the
  unconscious man with yet more horrible intensity. And ever through his mind
  walked, like a dreadful procession, the thoughts of what that other
  man&mdash;the man of blood and violence&mdash;would do in these
  circumstances. Detail by detail the hideous synthesis fitted together the
  parts of the imagined crime, and arranged them in due sequence until they
  formed a succession of events, rational, connected and coherent.</p>

  <p>He rose uneasily from his chair, with his eyes still riveted upon his
  guest. He could not sit any longer opposite that man with his hidden store of
  precious gems. The impulse that he recognized with fear and wonder was
  growing more ungovernable from moment to moment. If he stayed it would
  presently overpower him, and then? He shrank with horror from the dreadful
  thought, but his fingers itched to handle the diamonds. For Silas was, after
  all, a criminal by nature and habit. He was a beast of prey. His livelihood
  had never been earned; it had been taken by stealth or, if necessary, by
  force. His instincts were predacious, and the proximity of unguarded
  valuables suggested to him, as a logical consequence, their abstraction or
  seizure. His unwillingness to let these diamonds go away beyond his reach was
  fast becoming overwhelming.</p>

  <p>But he would make one more effort to escape. He would keep out of
  Brodski's actual presence until the moment for starting came.</p>

  <p>"If you'll excuse me," he said, "I will go and put on a thicker pair of
  boots. After all this dry weather we may get a change, and damp feet are very
  uncomfortable when you are travelling."</p>

  <p>"Yes; dangerous too," agreed Brodski.</p>

  <p>Silas walked through into the adjoining kitchen, where, by the light of
  the little lamp that was burning there, he had seen his stout, country boots
  placed, cleaned and in readiness, and sat down upon a chair to make the
  change. He did not, of course, intend to wear the country boots, for the
  diamonds were concealed in those he had on. But he would make the change and
  then alter his mind; it would all help to pass the time. He took a deep
  breath. It was a relief, at any rate, to be out of that room. Perhaps if he
  stayed away, the temptation would pass. Brodski would go on his way&mdash;he
  wished that he was going alone&mdash;and the danger would be over&mdash;at
  least&mdash;and the opportunity would have gone&mdash;the
  diamonds&mdash;?</p>

  <p>He looked up as he slowly unlaced his boot. From where he sat he could see
  Brodski sitting by the table with his back towards the kitchen door. He had
  finished eating, now, and was composedly rolling a cigarette. Silas breathed
  heavily, and, slipping off his boot, sat for a while motionless, gazing
  steadily at the other man's back. Then he unlaced the other boot, still
  staring abstractedly at his unconscious guest, drew it off, and laid it very
  quietly on the floor.</p>

  <p>Brodski calmly finished rolling his cigarette, licked the paper, put away
  his pouch, and, having dusted the crumbs of tobacco from his knees, began to
  search his pockets for a match. Suddenly, yielding to an uncontrollable
  impulse, Silas stood up and began stealthily to creep along the passage to
  the sitting-room. Not a sound came from his stockinged feet. Silently as a
  cat he stole forward, breathing softly with parted lips, until he stood at
  the threshold of the room. His face flushed duskily, his eyes, wide and
  staring, glittered in the lamplight, and the racing blood hummed in his
  ears.</p>

  <p>Brodski struck a match&mdash;Silas noted that it was a wooden
  vesta&mdash;lighted his cigarette, blew out the match and flung it into the
  fender. Then he replaced the box in his pocket and commenced to smoke.</p>

  <p>Slowly and without a sound Silas crept forward into the room, step by
  step, with catlike stealthiness, until he stood close behind Brodski's
  chair&mdash;so close that he had to turn his head that his breath might not
  stir the hair upon the other man's head. So, for half-a-minute, he stood
  motionless, like a symbolical statue of Murder, glaring down with horrible,
  glittering eyes upon the unconscious diamond merchant, while his quick breath
  passed without a sound through his open mouth and his fingers writhed slowly
  like the tentacles of a giant hydra. And then, as noiselessly as ever, he
  backed away to the door, turned quickly and walked back into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>He drew a deep breath. It had been a near thing. Brodski's life had hung
  upon a thread For it had been so easy. Indeed, if he had happened, as he
  stood behind the man's chair, to have a weapon&mdash;a hammer, for instance,
  or even a stone?</p>

  <p>He glanced round the kitchen and his eyes lighted on a bar that had been
  left by the workmen who had put up the new greenhouse. It was an odd piece
  cut off from a square, wrought-iron stanchion, and was about a foot long and
  perhaps three-quarters of an inch thick. Now, if he had had that in his hand
  a minute ago&mdash;</p>

  <p>He picked the bar up, balanced it in his hand and swung it round his head.
  A formidable weapon this: silent, too. And it fitted the plan that had passed
  through his brain. Bah! He had better put the thing down.</p>

  <p>But he did not. He stepped over to the door and looked again at Brodski,
  sitting, as before, meditatively smoking, with his back towards the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a change came over Silas. His face flushed, the veins of his neck
  stood out and a sullen scowl settled on his face. He drew out his watch,
  glanced at it earnestly and replaced it. Then he strode swiftly but silently
  along the passage into the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>A pace away from his victim's chair he halted and took deliberate aim. The
  bar swung aloft, but not without some faint rustle of movement, for Brodski
  looked round quickly even as the iron whistled through the air. The movement
  disturbed the murderer's aim, and the bar glanced off his victim's head,
  making only a trifling wound. Brodski sprang up with a tremulous, bleating
  cry, and clutched his assailant's arms with the tenacity of mortal
  terror.</p>

  <p>Then began a terrible struggle, as the two men, locked in a deadly
  embrace, swayed to and fro and trampled backwards and forwards. The chair was
  overturned, an empty glass swept from the table and, with Brodski's
  spectacles, crushed beneath stamping feet. And thrice that dreadful, pitiful,
  bleating cry rang out into the night, filling Silas, despite his murderous
  frenzy, with terror lest some chance wayfarer should hear it. Gathering his
  great strength for a final effort, he forced his victim backwards onto the
  table and, snatching up a corner of the tablecloth, thrust it into his face
  and crammed it into his mouth as it opened to utter another shriek. And thus
  they remained for a full two minutes, almost motionless, like some dreadful
  group of tragic allegory. Then, when the last faint twitchings had died away,
  Silas relaxed his grasp and let the limp body slip softly onto the floor.</p>

  <p>It was over. For good or for evil, the thing was done. Silas stood up,
  breathing heavily, and, as he wiped the sweat from his face, he looked at the
  clock. The hands stood at one minute to seven. The whole thing had taken a
  little over three minutes. He had nearly an hour in which to finish his task
  The goods train that entered into his scheme came by at twenty minutes past,
  and it was only three hundred yards to the line. Still, he must not waste
  time. He was now quite composed, and only disturbed by the thought that
  Brodski's cries might have been heard. If no one had heard them it was all
  plain sailing.</p>

  <p>He stooped, and, gently disengaging the table-cloth from the dead man's
  teeth, began a careful search of his pockets. He was not long finding what he
  sought, and, as he pinched the paper packet and felt the little hard bodies
  grating on one another inside, his faint regrets for what had happened were
  swallowed up in self-congratulations.</p>

  <p>He now set about his task with business-like briskness and an attentive
  eye on the clock. A few large drops of blood had fallen on the table-cloth,
  and there was a small bloody smear on the carpet by the dead man's head.
  Silas fetched from the kitchen some water, a nail-brush and a dry cloth, and,
  having washed out the stains from the table-cover&mdash;not forgetting the
  deal table-top underneath&mdash;and cleaned away the smear from the carpet
  and rubbed the damp places dry, he slipped a sheet of paper under the head of
  the corpse to prevent further contamination. Then he set the tablecloth
  straight, stood the chair upright, laid the broken spectacles on the table
  and picked up the cigarette, which had been trodden flat in the struggle, and
  flung it under the grate. Then there was the broken glass, which he swept up
  into a dust-pan. Part of it was the remains of the shattered tumbler, and the
  rest the fragments of the broken spectacles. He turned it out onto a sheet of
  paper and looked it over carefully, picking out the larger recognizable
  pieces of the spectacle-glasses and putting them aside on a separate slip of
  paper, together with a sprinkling of the minute fragments. The remainder he
  shot back into the dust-pan and, having hurriedly put on his boots, carried
  it out to the rubbish-heap at the back of the house.</p>

  <p>It was now time to start. Hastily cutting off a length of string from his
  string-box&mdash;for Silas was an orderly man and despised the oddments of
  string with which many people make shift&mdash;he tied it to the dead man's
  bag and umbrella and slung them from his shoulder. Then he folded up the
  paper of broken glass, and, slipping it and the spectacles into his pocket,
  picked up the body and threw it over his shoulder. Brodski was a small, spare
  man, weighing not more than nine stone; not a very formidable burden for a
  big, athletic man like Silas.</p>

  <p>The night was intensely dark, and, when Silas looked out of the back gate
  over the waste land that stretched from his house to the railway, he could
  hardly see twenty yards ahead. After listening cautiously and hearing no
  sound, he went out, shut the gate softly behind him and set forth at a good
  pace, though carefully, over the broken ground. His progress was not as
  silent as he could have wished for, though.</p>

  <p>The scanty turf that covered the gravelly land was thick enough to deaden
  his footfalls, the swinging bag and umbrella made an irritating noise;
  indeed, his movements were more hampered by them than by the weightier
  burden.</p>

  <p>The distance to the line was about three hundred yards. Ordinarily he
  would have walked it in from three to four minutes, but now, going cautiously
  with his burden and stopping now and again to listen, it took him just six
  minutes to reach the three-bar fence that separated the waste land from the
  railway. Arrived here he halted for a moment and once more listened
  attentively, peering into the darkness on all sides. Not a living creature
  was to be seen or heard in this desolate spot, but far away, the shriek of an
  engine's whistle warned him to hasten.</p>

  <p>Lifting the corpse easily over the fence, he carried it a few yards
  farther to a point where the line curved sharply.</p>

  <p>Here he laid it face downwards, with the neck over the near rail. Drawing
  out his pocket-knife, he cut through the knot that fastened the umbrella to
  the string and also secured the bag; and when he had flung the bag and
  umbrella on the track beside the body, he carefully pocketed the string,
  excepting the little loop that had fallen to the ground when the knot was
  cut.</p>

  <p>The quick snort and clanking rumble of an approaching goods train began
  now to be clearly audible. Rapidly, Silas; drew from his pockets the battered
  spectacles and the packet of broken glass. The former he threw down by the
  dead man's head, and then, emptying the packet into his hand, sprinkled the
  fragments of glass around the spectacles.</p>

  <p>He was none too soon. Already the quick, laboured puffing of the engine
  sounded close at hand. His impulse was to stay and watch; to witness the
  final catastrophe that should convert the murder into an accident or suicide.
  But it was hardly safe: it would be better that he should not be near lest he
  should not be able to get away without being seen. Hastily he climbed back
  over the fence and strode away across the rough fields, while the train came
  snorting and clattering towards the curve.</p>

  <p>He had nearly reached his back gate when a sound from the line brought him
  to a sudden halt; it was a prolonged whistle accompanied by the groan of
  brakes and the loud clank of colliding trucks. The snorting of the engine had
  ceased and was replaced by the penetrating hiss of escaping steam.</p>

  <p>The train had stopped!</p>

  <p>For one brief moment Silas stood with bated breath and mouth agape like
  one petrified; then he strode forward quickly to the gate, and, letting
  himself in, silently slid the bolt. He was undeniably alarmed. What could
  have happened on the line? It was practically certain that the body had been
  seen; but what was happening now? and would they come to the house? He
  entered the kitchen, and having paused again to listen&mdash;for somebody
  might come and knock at the door at any moment&mdash;he walked through the
  sitting-room and looked round. All seemed in order there. There was the bar,
  though, lying where he had dropped it in the scuffle. He picked it up and
  held it under the lamp. There was no blood on it; only one or two hairs.
  Somewhat absently he wiped it with the table-cover, and then, running out
  through the kitchen into the back garden, dropped it over the wall into a bed
  of nettles. Not that there was anything incriminating in the bar, but, since
  he had used it as a weapon, it had somehow acquired a sinister aspect to his
  eye.</p>

  <p>He now felt that it would be well to start for the station at once. It was
  not time yet, for it was barely twenty-five minutes past seven; but he did
  not wish to be found in the house if any one should come. His soft hat was on
  the sofa with his bag, to which his umbrella was strapped. He put on the hat,
  caught up the bag and stepped over to the door; then he came back to turn
  down the lamp. And it was at this moment, when he stood with his hand raised
  to the burner, that his eyes, travelling by chance into the dim corner of the
  room, lighted on Brodski's grey felt hat, reposing on the chair where the
  dead man had placed it when he entered the house.</p>

  <p>Silas stood for a few moments as if petrified, with the chilly sweat of
  mortal fear standing in beads upon his forehead. Another instant and he would
  have turned the lamp down and gone on his way; and then&mdash;? He strode
  over to the chair, snatched up the hat and looked inside it. Yes, there was
  the name, "Oscar Brodski," written plainly on the lining. If he had gone
  away, leaving it to be discovered, he would have been lost; indeed, even now,
  if a search-party should come to the house, it was enough to send him to the
  gallows.</p>

  <p>His limbs shook with horror at the thought, but in spite of his panic he
  did not lose his self-possession. Darting through into the kitchen, he
  grabbed up a handful of the dry brush-wood that was kept for lighting fires
  and carried it to the sitting-room grate where he thrust it on the extinct,
  but still hot, embers, and crumpling up the paper that he had placed under
  Brodski's head&mdash;on which paper he now noticed, for the first time, a
  minute bloody smear&mdash;he poked it in under the wood, and striking a wax
  match, set light to it. As the wood flared up, he hacked at the hat with his
  pocket knife and threw the ragged strips into the blaze.</p>

  <p>And all the while his heart was thumping and his hands a-tremble with the
  dread of discovery. The fragments of felt were far from inflammable, tending
  rather to fuse into cindery masses that smoked and smouldered than to burn
  away into actual ash. Moreover, to his dismay, they emitted a powerful
  resinous stench mixed with the odour of burning hair, so that he had to open
  the kitchen window (since he dared not unlock the front door) to disperse the
  reek. And still, as he fed the fire with small cut fragments, he strained his
  ears to catch, above the crackling of the wood, the sound of the dreaded
  footsteps, the knock on the door that should be as the summons of Fate.</p>

  <p>The time, too, was speeding on. Twenty-one minutes to eight! In a few
  minutes more he must set out or he would miss the train. He dropped the
  dismembered hat-brim on the blazing wood and ran upstairs to open a window,
  since he must close that in the kitchen before he left. When he came back,
  the brim had already curled up into a black, clinkery mass that bubbled and
  hissed as the fat, pungent smoke rose from it sluggishly to the chimney.</p>

  <p>Nineteen minutes to eight! It was time to start. He took up the poker and
  carefully beat the cinders into small particles, stirring them into the
  glowing embers of the wood and coal. There was nothing unusual in the
  appearance of the grate. It was his constant custom to burn letters and other
  discarded articles in the sitting-room fire: his housekeeper would notice
  nothing out of the common. Indeed, the cinders would probably be reduced to
  ashes before she returned. He had been careful to notice that there were no
  metallic fittings of any kind in the hat, which might have escaped
  burning.</p>

  <p>Once more he picked up his bag, took a last look round, turned down the
  lamp and, unlocking the door, held it open for a few moments. Then he went
  out, locked the door, pocketed the key (of which his housekeeper had a
  duplicate) and set off at a brisk pace for the station.</p>

  <p>He arrived in good time after all, and, having taken his ticket, strolled
  through onto the platform. The train was not yet signalled, but there seemed
  to be an unusual stir in the place. The passengers were collected in a group
  at one end of the platform, and were all looking in one direction down the
  line; and, even as he walked towards them, with a certain tremulous,
  nauseating curiosity, two men emerged from the darkness and ascended the
  slope to the platform, carrying a stretcher covered with a tarpaulin. The
  passengers parted to let the bearers pass, turning fascinated eyes upon the
  shape that showed faintly through the rough pall; and, when the stretcher had
  been borne into the lamp-room, they fixed their attention upon a porter who
  followed carrying a hand-bag and an umbrella.</p>

  <p>Suddenly one of the passengers started forward with an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Is that his umbrella?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered the porter, stopping and holding it out for the
  speaker's inspection.</p>

  <p>"My God!" ejaculated the passenger; then, turning sharply to a tall man
  who stood close by, he said excitedly: "That's Brodski's umbrella. I could
  swear to it. You remember Brodski?" The tall man nodded, and the passenger,
  turning once more to the porter, said: "I identify that umbrella. It belongs
  to a gentleman named Brodski. If you look in his hat you will see his name
  written in it. He always writes his name in his hat."</p>

  <p>"We haven't found his hat yet," said the porter; "but here is the
  station-master coming up the line." He awaited the arrival of his superior
  and then announced: "This gentleman, sir, has identified the umbrella."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the station-master, "you recognize the umbrella, sir, do you?
  Then perhaps you would step into the lamp-room and see if you can identify
  the body."</p>

  <p>"Is it&mdash;is he&mdash;very much injured?" the passenger asked
  tremulously.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," was the reply. "You see, the engine and six of the trucks
  went over him before they could stop the train. Took his head clean off, in
  fact."</p>

  <p>"Shocking! shocking!" gasped the passenger. "I think, if you don't
  mind&mdash;I'd&mdash;I'd rather not. You don't think it's necessary, doctor,
  do you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," replied the tall man. "Early identification may be of the
  first importance."</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose I must," said the passenger.</p>

  <p>Very reluctantly he allowed himself to be conducted by the station-master
  to the lamp-room, as the clang of the bell announced the approaching train.
  Silas Hickler followed and took his stand with the expectant crowd outside
  the closed door. In a few moments the passenger burst out, pale and
  awe-stricken, and rushed up to his tall friend. "It is!" he exclaimed
  breathlessly. "It's Brodski! Poor old Brodski! Horrible! horrible! He was to
  have met me here and come on with me to Amsterdam."</p>

  <p>"Had he any&mdash;merchandize about him?" the tall man asked; and Silas
  strained his ears to catch the reply.</p>

  <p>"He had some stones, no doubt, but I don't know what.</p>

  <p>His clerk will know, of course. By the way, doctor, could you watch the
  case for me? Just to be sure it was really an accident or&mdash;you know
  what. We were old friends, you know, fellow townsmen, too; we were both born
  in Warsaw. I'd like you to give an eye to the case."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the other. "I will satisfy myself that&mdash;there is
  nothing more than appears, and let you have a report. Will that do?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you. It's excessively good of you, doctor. Ah! here comes the
  train. I hope it won't inconvenience you to stay and see to this matter."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," replied the doctor. "We are not due at Warmington
  until to-morrow afternoon, and I expect we can find out all that is necessary
  to know before that."</p>

  <p>Silas looked long and curiously at the tall, imposing man who was, as it
  were, taking his seat at the chessboard, to play against him for his life. A
  formidable antagonist he looked, with his keen, thoughtful face, so resolute
  and calm. As Silas stepped into his carriage he thought with deep discomfort
  of Brodski's hat, and hoped that he had made no other oversight.</p>

  <h3>PART II. &mdash; THE MECHANISM OF DETECTION</h3>

  <h4>(RELATED BY CHRISTOPHER JERVIS, M.D.)</h4>

  <p class="first">THE singular circumstances that attended the death of Mr.
  Oscar Brodski, the well-known diamond merchant of Hatton Garden, illustrated
  very forcibly the importance of one or two points in medico-legal practice
  which Thorndyke was accustomed to insist were not sufficiently appreciated.
  What those points were, I shall leave my friend and teacher to state at the
  proper place; and meanwhile, as the case is in the highest degree
  instructive, I shall record the incidents in the order of their
  occurrence.</p>

  <p>The dusk of an October evening was closing in as Thorndyke and I, the sole
  occupants of a smoking compartment, found ourselves approaching the little
  station of Ludham; and, as the train slowed down, we peered out at the knot
  of country, people who were waiting on the platform. Suddenly Thorndyke
  exclaimed in a tone of surprise: "Why, that is surely Boscovitch!" and almost
  at the same moment a brisk, excitable little man darted at the door of our
  compartment and literally tumbled in.</p>

  <p>"I hope I don't intrude on this learned conclave," he said, shaking hands
  genially and banging his Gladstone with impulsive violence into the rack;
  "but I saw your faces at the window, and naturally jumped at the chance of
  such pleasant companionship."</p>

  <p>"You are very flattering," said Thorndyke; "so flattering that you leave
  us nothing to say. But what in the name of fortune are you doing
  at&mdash;what's the name of the place&mdash;Ludham?"</p>

  <p>"My brother has a little place a mile or so from here, and I have been
  spending a couple of days with him," Mr. Boscovitch explained. "I shall
  change at Badsham Junction and catch the boat train for Amsterdam. But
  whither are you two bound? I see you have your mysterious little green box up
  on the hat-rack, so I infer that you are on some romantic quest, eh? Going to
  unravel some dark and intricate crime?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "We are bound for Warmington on a quite prosaic
  errand. I am instructed to watch the proceedings at an inquest there
  to-morrow on behalf of the Griffin Life Insurance Office, and we are
  travelling down to-night as it is rather a cross-country journey."</p>

  <p>"But why the box of magic?" asked Boscovitch, glancing up at the
  hat-rack.</p>

  <p>"I never go away from home without it," answered Thorndyke. "One never
  knows what may turn up; the trouble of carrying it is small when set off
  against the comfort of having appliances at hand in an emergency."</p>

  <p>Boscovitch continued to stare up at the little square case covered with
  Willesden canvas. Presently he remarked: "I often used to wonder what you had
  in it when you were down at Chelmsford in connection with that bank
  murder&mdash;what an amazing case that was, by the way, and didn't your
  methods of research astonish the police!" As he still looked up wistfully at
  the case, Thorndyke good-naturedly lifted it down and unlocked it. As a
  matter of fact he was rather proud of his "portable laboratory," and
  certainly it was a triumph of condensation, for, small as it was&mdash;only a
  foot square by four inches deep&mdash;it contained a fairly complete outfit
  for a preliminary investigation.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed Boscovitch, when the case lay open before him,
  displaying its rows of little re-agent bottles, tiny test-tubes, diminutive
  spirit-lamp, dwarf microscope and assorted instruments on the same
  Lilliputian scale; "it's like a doll's house&mdash;everything looks as if it
  was seen through the wrong end of a telescope. But are these tiny things
  really efficient? That microscope now&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly efficient at low and moderate magnifications," said Thorndyke.
  "It looks like a toy, but it isn't one; the lenses are the best that can be
  had. Of course a full-sized instrument would be infinitely more
  convenient&mdash;but I shouldn't have it with me, and should have to make
  shift with a pocket-lens. And so with the rest of the under-sized appliances;
  they are the alternative to no appliances."</p>

  <p>Boscovitch pored over the case and its contents, fingering the instruments
  delicately and asking questions innumerable about their uses; indeed, his
  curiosity was but half appeased when, half-an-hour later, the train began to
  slow down.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, starting up and seizing his bag, "here we are at
  the junction already. You change here too, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "We take the branch train on to Warmington."</p>

  <p>As we stepped out onto the platform, we became aware that something
  unusual was happening or had happened. All the passengers and most of the
  porters and supernumeraries were gathered at one end of the station, and all
  were looking intently into the darkness down the line.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" asked Mr. Boscovitch, addressing the
  station-inspector.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the official replied; "a man has been run over by the goods
  train about a mile down the line. The station-master has gone down with a
  stretcher to bring him in, and I expect that is his lantern that you see
  coming this way."</p>

  <p>As we stood watching the dancing light grow momentarily brighter, flashing
  fitful reflections from the burnished rails, a man came out of the
  booking-office and joined the group of onlookers. He attracted my attention,
  as I afterwards remembered, for two reasons: in the first place his round,
  jolly face was excessively pale and bore a strained and wild expression, and,
  in the second, though he stared into the darkness with eager curiosity he
  asked no questions.</p>

  <p>The swinging lantern continued to approach, and then suddenly two men came
  into sight bearing a stretcher covered with a tarpaulin, through which the
  shape of a human figure was dimly discernible. They ascended the slope to the
  platform, and proceeded with their burden to the lamp-room, when the
  inquisitive gaze of the passengers was transferred to a porter who followed
  carrying a handbag and umbrella and to the station-master who brought up the
  rear with his lantern.</p>

  <p>As the porter passed, Mr. Boscovitch started forward with sudden
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Is that his umbrella?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered the porter, stopping and holding it out for the
  speaker's inspection.</p>

  <p>"My God!" ejaculated Boscovitch; then, turning sharply to Thorndyke, he
  exclaimed: "That's Brodski's umbrella. I could swear to it. You remember
  Brodski?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded, and Boscovitch, turning once more to the porter, said:
  "I identify that umbrella. It belongs to a gentleman named Brodski. If you
  look in his hat, you will see his name written in it. He always writes his
  name in his hat."</p>

  <p>"We haven't found his hat yet," said the porter; "but here is the
  station-master." He turned to his superior and announced: "This gentleman,
  sir, has identified the umbrella."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the station-master, "you recognize the umbrella, sir, do you?
  Then perhaps you would step into the lamp-room and see if you can identify
  the body."</p>

  <p>Mr. Boscovitch recoiled with a look of alarm. "Is it? is he&mdash;very
  much injured?" he asked nervously.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," was the reply. "You see, the engine and six of the trucks
  went over him before they could stop the train. Took his head clean off, in
  fact."</p>

  <p>"Shocking! shocking!" gasped Boscovitch. "I think? if you don't
  mind&mdash;I'd&mdash;I'd rather not. You don't think it necessary, doctor, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," replied Thorndyke. "Early identification may be of the first
  importance."</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose I must," said Boscovitch; and, with extreme reluctance, he
  followed the station-master to the lamp-room, as the loud ringing of the bell
  announced the approach of the boat train. His inspection must have been of
  the briefest, for, in a few moments, he burst out, pale and awe-stricken, and
  rushed up to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"It is!" he exclaimed breathlessly. "It's Brodski! Poor" old Brodski!
  Horrible! horrible! He was to have met me here and come on with me to
  Amsterdam."</p>

  <p>"Had he any&mdash;merchandize about him?" Thorndyke asked; and, as he
  spoke, the stranger whom I had previously noticed edged up closer as if to
  catch the reply.</p>

  <p>"He had some stones, no doubt," answered Boscovitch, "but I don't know
  what they were. His clerk will know, of course. By the way, doctor, could you
  watch the case for me? Just to be sure it was really an accident or&mdash;you
  know what. We were old friends, you know, fellow townsmen, too; we were both
  born in Warsaw. I'd like you to give an eye to the case."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "I will satisfy myself that there is nothing
  more than appears, and let you have a report. Will that do?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Boscovitch. "It's excessively good of you, doctor. Ah,
  here comes the train. I hope it won't inconvenience you to stay and see to
  the matter."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," replied Thorndyke. "We are not due at Warmington until
  to-morrow afternoon, and I expect we can find out all that is necessary to
  know and still keep our appointment."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke spoke, the stranger, who had kept close to us with the
  evident purpose of hearing what was said, bestowed on him a very curious and
  attentive look; and it was only when the train had actually come to rest by
  the platform that he hurried away to find a compartment.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the train left the station than Thorndyke sought out the
  station-master and informed him of the instructions that he had received from
  Boscovitch. "Of course," he added, in conclusion, "we must not move in the
  matter until the police arrive. I suppose they have been informed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the station-master; "I sent a message at once to the Chief
  Constable, and I expect him or an inspector at any moment. In fact, I think I
  will slip out to the approach and see if he is coming." He evidently wished
  to have a word in private with the police officer before committing himself
  to any statement.</p>

  <p>As the official departed, Thorndyke and I began to pace the now empty
  platform, and my friend, as was his wont, when entering on a new inquiry,
  meditatively reviewed the features of the problem.</p>

  <p>"In a case of this kind," he remarked, "we have to decide on one of three
  possible explanations: accident, suicide or homicide; and our decision will
  be determined by inferences from three sets of facts: first, the general
  facts of the case; second, the special data obtained by examination of the
  body, and, third, the special data obtained by examining the spot on which
  the body was found. Now the only general facts at present in our possession
  are that the deceased was a diamond merchant making a journey for a specific
  purpose and probably having on his person property of small bulk and great
  value. These facts are somewhat against the hypothesis of suicide and
  somewhat favourable to that of homicide. Facts relevant to the question of
  accident would be the existence or otherwise of a level crossing, a road or
  path leading to the line, an enclosing fence with or without a gate, and any
  other facts rendering probable or otherwise the accidental presence of the
  deceased at the spot where the body was found. As we do not possess these
  facts, it is desirable that we extend our knowledge."</p>

  <p>"Why not put a few discreet questions to the porter who brought in the bag
  and umbrella?" I suggested. "He is at this moment in earnest conversation
  with the ticket collector and would, no doubt, be glad of a new
  listener."</p>

  <p>"An excellent suggestion, Jervis," answered Thorndyke. "Let us see what he
  has to tell us." We approached the porter and found him, as I had
  anticipated, bursting to unburden himself of the tragic story.</p>

  <p>"The way the thing happened, sir, was this," he said, in answer to
  Thorndyke's question: "There's a sharpish bend in the road just at that
  place, and the goods train was just rounding the curve when the driver
  suddenly caught sight of something lying across the rails. As the engine
  turned, the head-lights shone on it and then he saw it was a man. He shut off
  steam at once, blew his whistle, and put the brakes down hard, but, as you
  know, sir, a goods train takes some stopping; before they could bring her up,
  the engine and half-a-dozen trucks had gone over the poor beggar."</p>

  <p>"Could the driver see how the man was lying?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he could see him quite plain, because the headlights were full on
  him. He was lying on his face with his neck over the near rail on the
  downside. His head was in the four-foot and his body by the side of the
  track. It looked as if he had laid himself out a-purpose."</p>

  <p>"Is there a level crossing thereabouts?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. No crossing, no road, no path, no nothing," said the porter,
  ruthlessly sacrificing grammar to emphasis. "He must have come across the
  fields and climbed over the fence to get onto the permanent way. Deliberate
  suicide is what it looks like."</p>

  <p>"How did you learn all this?" Thorndyke inquired.</p>

  <p>"Why, the driver, you see, sir, when him and his mate had lifted the body
  off the track, went on to the next signal-box and sent in his report by
  telegram. The station-master told me all about it as we walked down the
  line."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke thanked the man for his information, and, as we strolled back
  towards the lamp-room, discussed the bearing of these new facts.</p>

  <p>"Our friend is unquestionably right in one respect," he said; "this was
  not an accident. The man might, if he were near-sighted, deaf or stupid, have
  climbed over the fence and got knocked down by the train. But his position,
  lying across the rails, can only be explained by one of two hypotheses:
  either it was, as the porter says, deliberate suicide, or else the man was
  already dead or insensible. We must leave it at that until we have seen the
  body, that is, if the police will allow us to see it. But here comes the
  station-master and an officer with him. Let us hear what they have to
  say."</p>

  <p>The two officials had evidently made up their minds to decline any outside
  assistance. The divisional surgeon would make the necessary examination, and
  information could be obtained through the usual channels. The production of
  Thorndyke's card, however, somewhat altered the situation. The police
  inspector hummed and hawed irresolutely, with the card in his hand, but
  finally agreed to allow us to view the body, and we entered the lamp-room
  together, the station-master leading the way to turn up the gas.</p>

  <p>The stretcher stood on the floor by one wall, its grim burden still hidden
  by the tarpaulin, and the hand-bag and umbrella lay on a large box, together
  with the battered frame of a pair of spectacles from which the glasses had
  fallen out.</p>

  <p>"Were these spectacles found by the body?" Thorndyke inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the station-master. "They were close to the head and the
  glass was scattered about on the ballast."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made a note in his pocket-book, and then, as the inspector
  removed the tarpaulin, he glanced down on the corpse, lying limply on the
  stretcher and looking grotesquely horrible with its displaced head and
  distorted limbs. For fully a minute he remained silently stooping over the
  uncanny object, on which the inspector was now throwing the light of a large
  lantern; then he stood up and said quietly to me: "I think we can eliminate
  two out of the three hypotheses."</p>

  <p>The inspector looked at him quickly, and was about to ask a question, when
  his attention was diverted by the travelling-case which Thorndyke had laid on
  a shelf and now opened to abstract a couple of pairs of dissecting
  forceps.</p>

  <p>"We've no authority to make a post mortem, you know," said the
  inspector.</p>

  <p>"No, of course not," said Thorndyke. "I am merely going to look into the
  mouth." With one pair of forceps he turned back the lip and, having
  scrutinized its inner surface, closely examined the teeth.</p>

  <p>"May I trouble you for your lens, Jervis?" he said; and, as I handed him
  my doublet ready opened, the inspector brought the lantern close to the dead
  face and leaned forward eagerly. In his usual systematic fashion, Thorndyke
  slowly passed the lens along the whole range of sharp, uneven teeth, and
  then, bringing it back to the centre, examined with more minuteness the upper
  incisors. At length, very delicately, he picked out with his forceps some
  minute object from between two of the upper front teeth and held it in the
  focus of the lens. Anticipating his next move, I took a labelled
  microscope-slide from the case and handed it to him together with a
  dissecting needle, and, as he transferred the object to the slide and spread
  it out with the needle, I set up the little microscope on the shelf.</p>

  <p>"A drop of Farrant and a cover-glass, please, Jervis," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>I handed him the bottle, and, when he had let a drop of the mounting fluid
  fall gently on the object and put on the cover-slip, he placed the slide on
  the stage of the microscope and examined it attentively.</p>

  <p>Happening to glance at the inspector, I observed on his countenance a
  faint grin, which he politely strove to suppress when he caught my eye.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking, sir," he said apologetically, "that it's a bit off the
  track to be finding out what he had for dinner. He didn't die of unwholesome
  feeding."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked up with a smile. "It doesn't do, inspector, to assume
  that anything is off the track in an inquiry of this kind. Every fact must
  have some significance, you know."</p>

  <p>"I don't see any significance in the diet of a man who has had his head
  cut off," the inspector rejoined defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" said Thorndyke. "Is there no interest attaching to the last
  meal of a man who has met a violent death? These crumbs, for instance, that
  are scattered over the dead man's waistcoat. Can we learn nothing from
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see what you can learn," was the dogged rejoinder.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke picked off the crumbs, one by one, with his forceps, and having
  deposited them on a slide, inspected them, first with the lens and then
  through the microscope.</p>

  <p>"I learn," said he, "that shortly before his death, the deceased partook
  of some kind of whole-meal biscuits, apparently composed partly of
  oatmeal."</p>

  <p>"I call that nothing," said the inspector. "The question that we have got
  to settle is not what refreshments had the deceased been taking, but what was
  the cause of his death: did he commit suicide? was he killed by accident? or
  was there any foul play?"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Thorndyke, "the questions that remain to be
  settled are, who killed the deceased and with what motive? The others are
  already answered as far as I am, concerned."</p>

  <p>The inspector stared in sheer amazement not unmixed with incredulity.</p>

  <p>"You haven't been long coming to a conclusion, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"No, it was a pretty obvious case of murder," said Thorndyke. "As to the
  motive, the deceased was a diamond merchant and is believed to have had a
  quantity of stones about his person. I should suggest that you search the
  body."</p>

  <p>The inspector gave vent to an exclamation of disgust. "I see," he said.
  "It was just a guess on your part. The dead man was a diamond merchant and
  had valuable property about him; therefore he was murdered." He drew himself
  up, and, regarding Thorndyke with stern reproach, added: "But you must
  understand, sir, that this is a judicial inquiry, not a prize competition in
  a penny paper. And, as to searching the body, why, that is what I principally
  came for." He ostentatiously turned his back on us and proceeded
  systematically to turn out the dead man's pockets, laying the articles, as he
  removed them, on the box by the side of the hand-bag and umbrella.</p>

  <p>While he was thus occupied, Thorndyke looked over the body generally,
  paying special attention to the soles of the boots, which, to the inspector's
  undissembled amusement, he very thoroughly examined with the lens.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought, sir, that his feet were large enough to be seen
  with the naked eye," was his comment; "but perhaps," he added, with a sly
  glance at the station-master, "you're a little near-sighted."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled good-humouredly, and, while the officer continued his
  search, he looked over the articles that had already been laid on the box.
  The purse and pocket-book he naturally left for the inspector to open, but
  the reading-glasses, pocket-knife and card-case and other small pocket
  articles were subjected to a searching scrutiny. The inspector watched him
  out of the corner of his eye with furtive amusement; saw him hold up the
  glasses to the light to estimate their refractive power, peer into the
  tobacco pouch, open the cigarette book and examine the watermark of the
  paper, and even inspect the contents of the silver match-box.</p>

  <p>"What might you have expected to find in his tobacco pouch?" the officer
  asked, laying down a bunch of keys from the dead man's pocket.</p>

  <p>"Tobacco," Thorndyke replied stolidly; "but I did not expect to find
  fine-cut Latakia. I don't remember ever having seen pure Latakia smoked in
  cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"You do take an interest in things, sir," said the inspector, with a side
  glance at the stolid station-master.</p>

  <p>"I do," Thorndyke agreed; "and I note that there are no diamonds among
  this collection."</p>

  <p>"No, and we don't know that he had any about him; but there's a gold watch
  and chain, a diamond scarf-pin, and a purse containing"&mdash;he opened it
  and tipped out its contents into his hand&mdash;"twelve pounds in gold. That
  doesn't look much like robbery, does it? What do you say to the murder theory
  now?"</p>

  <p>"My opinion is unchanged," said Thorndyke, "and I should like to examine
  the spot where the body was found. Has the engine been inspected?" he added,
  addressing the station-master.</p>

  <p>"I telegraphed to Bradfield to have it examined," the official answered.
  "The report has probably come in by now. I'd better see before we start down
  the line."</p>

  <p>We emerged from the lamp-room and, at the door, found the
  station-inspector waiting with a telegram. He handed it to the
  station-master, who read it aloud.</p>

  <p>"The engine has been carefully examined by me. I find small smear of blood
  on near leading wheel and smaller one on next wheel following. No other
  marks." He glanced questioningly at Thorndyke, who nodded and remarked: "It
  will be interesting to see if the line tells the same tale."</p>

  <p>The station-master looked puzzled and was apparently about to ask for an
  explanation; but the inspector, who had carefully pocketed the dead man's
  property, was impatient to start and, accordingly, when Thorndyke had
  repacked his case and had, at his own request, been furnished with a lantern,
  we set off down the permanent way, Thorndyke carrying the light and I the
  indispensable green case.</p>

  <p>"I am a little in the dark about this affair," I said, when we had allowed
  the two officials to draw ahead out of earshot; "you came to a conclusion
  remarkably quickly. What was it that so immediately determined the opinion of
  murder as against suicide?"</p>

  <p>"It was a small matter but very conclusive," replied Thorndyke. "You
  noticed a small scalp-wound above the left temple? It was a glancing wound,
  and might easily have been made by the engine. But the wound had bled; and it
  had bled for an appreciable time. There were two streams of blood from it,
  and in both the blood was firmly clotted and partially dried. But the man had
  been decapitated; and this wound, if inflicted by the engine, must have been
  made after the decapitation, since it was on the side most distant from the
  engine as it approached. Now, a decapitated head does not bleed. Therefore,
  this wound was inflicted before the decapitation.</p>

  <p>"But not only had the wound bled: the blood had trickled down in two
  streams at right angles to one another. First, in the order of time as shown
  by the appearance of the stream, it had trickled down the side of the face
  and dropped on the collar. The second stream ran from the wound to the back
  of the head. Now, you know, Jervis, there are no exceptions to the law of
  gravity. If the blood ran down the face towards the chin, the face must have
  been upright at the time; and if the blood trickled from the front to the
  back of the head, the head must have been horizontal and face upwards. But
  the man when he was seen by the engine-driver, was lying face downwards. The
  only possible inference is that when the wound was inflicted, the man was in
  the upright position&mdash;standing or sitting; and that subsequently, and
  while he was still alive, he lay on his back for a sufficiently long time for
  the blood to have trickled to the back of his head."</p>

  <p>"I see. I was a duffer not to have reasoned this out for myself," I
  remarked contritely.</p>

  <p>"Quick observation and rapid inference come by practice," replied
  Thorndyke. "What did you notice about the face?"</p>

  <p>"I thought there was a strong suggestion of asphyxia."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," said Thorndyke. "It was the face of a suffocated man. You
  must have noticed, too, that the tongue was very distinctly swollen and that
  on the inside of the upper lip were deep indentations made by the teeth, as
  well as one or two slight wounds, obviously caused by heavy pressure on the
  mouth. And now observe how completely these facts and inferences agree with
  those from the scalp wound. If we knew that the deceased had received a blow
  on the head, had struggled with his assailant and been finally borne down and
  suffocated, we should look for precisely those signs which we have
  found."</p>

  <p>"By the way, what was it that you found wedged between the teeth? I did
  not get a chance to look through the microscope."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Thorndyke, "there we not only get confirmation, but we carry
  our inferences a stage further. The object was a little tuft of some textile
  fabric. Under the microscope I found it to consist of several different
  fibres, differently dyed. The bulk of it consisted of wool fibres dyed
  crimson, but there were also cotton fibres dyed blue and a few which looked
  like jute, dyed yellow. It was obviously a parti-coloured fabric and might
  have been part of a woman's dress, though the presence of the jute is much
  more suggestive of a curtain or rug of inferior quality."</p>

  <p>"And its importance?"</p>

  <p>"Is that, if it is not part of an article of clothing, then it must have
  come from an article of furniture, and furniture suggests a habitation."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem very conclusive," I objected.</p>

  <p>"It is not; but it is valuable corroboration."</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of the suggestion offered by the soles of the dead man's boots. I
  examined them most minutely and could find no trace of sand, gravel or earth,
  in spite of the fact that he must have crossed fields and rough land to reach
  the place where he was found. What I did find was fine tobacco ash, a charred
  mark as if a cigar or cigarette had been trodden on, several crumbs of
  biscuit, and, on a projecting brad, some coloured fibres, apparently from a
  carpet. The manifest suggestion is that the man was killed in a house with a
  carpeted floor, and carried from thence to the railway."</p>

  <p>I was silent for some moments. Well as I knew Thorndyke, I was completely
  taken by surprise; a sensation, indeed, that I experienced anew every time
  that I accompanied him on one of his investigations. His marvellous power of
  co-ordinating apparently insignificant facts, of arranging them into an
  ordered sequence and making them tell a coherent story, was a phenomenon that
  I never got used to; every exhibition of it astonished me afresh.</p>

  <p>"If your inferences are correct," I said, "the problem is practically
  solved. There must be abundant traces inside the house. The only question is,
  which house is it?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," replied Thorndyke; "that is the question, and a very difficult
  question it is. A glance at that interior would doubtless clear up the whole
  mystery. But how are we to get that glance? We cannot enter houses
  speculatively to see if they present traces of a murder. At present, our clue
  breaks off abruptly. The other end of it is in some unknown house, and, if we
  cannot join up the two ends, our problem remains unsolved. For the question
  is, you remember, Who killed Oscar Brodski?"</p>

  <p>"Then what do you propose to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The next stage of the inquiry is to connect some particular house with
  this crime. To that end, I can only gather up all available facts and
  consider each in all its possible bearings. If I cannot establish any such
  connection, then the inquiry will have failed and we shall have to make a
  fresh start&mdash;say, at Amsterdam, if it turns out that Brodski really had
  diamonds on his person, as I have no doubt he had."</p>

  <p>Here our conversation was interrupted by our arrival at the spot where the
  body had been found. The station-master had halted, and he and the inspector
  were now examining the near rail by the light of their lanterns.</p>

  <p>"There's remarkably little blood about," said the former. "I've seen a
  good many accidents of this kind and there has always been a lot of blood,
  both on the engine and on the road. It's very curious."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced at the rail with but slight attention: that question had
  ceased to interest him. But the light of his lantern flashed onto the ground
  at the side of the track&mdash;a loose, gravelly soil mixed with fragments of
  chalk&mdash;and from thence to the soles of the inspector's boots, which were
  displayed as he knelt by the rail.</p>

  <p>"You observe, Jervis?" he said in a low voice, and I nodded. The
  inspector's boot-soles were covered with adherent particles of gravel and
  conspicuously marked by the chalk on which he had trodden.</p>

  <p>"You haven't found the hat, I suppose?" Thorndyke asked, stooping to pick
  up a short piece of string that lay on the ground at the side of the
  track.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the inspector, "but it can't be far off. You seem to have
  found another clue, sir," he added, with a grin, glancing at the piece of
  string.</p>

  <p>"Who knows," said Thorndyke. "A short end of white twine with a green
  strand in it. It may tell us something later. At any rate we'll keep it,"
  and, taking from his pocket a small tin box containing, among other things, a
  number of seed envelopes, he slipped the string into one of the latter and
  scribbled a note in pencil on the outside. The inspector watched his
  proceedings with an indulgent smile, and then returned to his examination of
  the track, in which Thorndyke now joined.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the poor chap was near-sighted," the officer remarked,
  indicating the remains of the shattered spectacles; "that might account for
  his having strayed onto the line."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said Thorndyke. He had already noticed the fragments scattered
  over a sleeper and the adjacent ballast, and now once more produced his
  "collecting-box," from which he took another seed envelope. "Would you hand
  me a pair of forceps, Jervis," he said; "and perhaps you wouldn't mind taking
  a pair yourself and helping me to gather up these fragments."</p>

  <p>As I complied, the inspector looked up curiously.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any doubt that these spectacles belonged to the deceased, is
  there?" he asked. "He certainly wore spectacles, for I saw the mark on his
  nose."</p>

  <p>"Still, there is no harm in verifying the fact," said Thorndyke, and he
  added to me in a lower tone, "Pick up every particle you can find, Jervis. It
  may be most important."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see how," I said, groping amongst the shingle by the light
  of the lantern in search of the tiny splinters of glass.</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" returned Thorndyke. "Well, look at these fragments; some of
  them are a fair size, but many of these on the sleeper are mere grains. And
  consider their number. Obviously, the condition of the glass does not agree
  with the circumstances in which we find it. These are thick concave
  spectacle-lenses broken into a great number of minute fragments. Now how were
  they broken? Not merely by falling, evidently: such a lens, when it is
  dropped, breaks into a small number of large pieces. Nor were they broken by
  the wheel passing over them, for they would then have been reduced to fine
  powder, and that powder would have been visible on the rail, which it is not.
  The spectacle-frames, you may remember, presented the same incongruity: they
  were battered and damaged more than they would have been by falling, but not
  nearly so much as they would have been if the wheel had passed over
  them."</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest, then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The appearances suggest that the spectacles had been trodden on. But, if
  the body was carried here the probability is that the spectacles were carried
  here too, and that they were then already broken; for it is more likely that
  they were trodden on during the struggle than that the murderer trod on them
  after bringing them here. Hence the importance of picking up every
  fragment."</p>

  <p>"But why?" I inquired, rather foolishly, I must admit.</p>

  <p>"Because, if, when we have picked up every fragment that we can find,
  there still remains missing a larger portion of the lenses than we could
  reasonably expect, that would tend to support our hypothesis and we might
  find the missing remainder elsewhere. If, on the other hand, we find as much
  of the lenses as we could expect to find, we must conclude that they were
  broken on this spot."</p>

  <p>While we were conducting our search, the two officials were circling
  around with their lanterns in quest of the missing hat; and, when we had at
  length picked up the last fragment, and a careful search, even aided by a
  lens, failed to reveal any other, we could see their lanterns moving, like
  will-o'-the-wisps, some distance down the line.</p>

  <p>"We may as well see what we have got before our friends come back," said
  Thorndyke, glancing at the twinkling lights. "Lay the case down on the grass
  by the fence; it will serve for a table."</p>

  <p>I did so, and Thorndyke, taking a letter from his pocket, opened it,
  spread it out flat on the case, securing it with a couple of heavy stones,
  although the night was quite calm. Then he tipped the contents of the seed
  envelope out on the paper, and carefully spreading out the pieces of glass,
  looked at them for some moments in silence. And, as he looked, there stole
  over his face a very curious expression; with sudden eagerness he began
  picking out the large fragments and laying them on two visiting-cards which
  he had taken from his card-case. Rapidly and with wonderful deftness he
  fitted the pieces together, and, as the reconstituted lenses began gradually
  to take shape on their cards I looked on with growing excitement, for
  something in my colleague's manner told me that we were on the verge of a
  discovery.</p>

  <p>At length the two ovals of glass lay on their respective cards, complete
  save for one or two small gaps; and the little heap that remained consisted
  of fragments so minute as to render further reconstruction impossible. Then
  Thorndyke leaned back and laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"This is certainly an unlooked-for result," said he.</p>

  <p>"What is?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see, my dear fellow? There's too much glass. We have almost
  completely built up the broken lenses, and the fragments that are left over
  are considerably more than are required to fill up the gaps."</p>

  <p>I looked at the little heap of small fragments and saw at once that it was
  as he had said. There was a surplus of small pieces.</p>

  <p>"This is very extraordinary," I said. "What do you think can be the
  explanation?"</p>

  <p>"The fragments will probably tell us," he replied, "if we ask them
  intelligently."</p>

  <p>He lifted the paper and the two cards carefully onto the ground, and,
  opening the case, took out the little microscope, to which he fitted the
  lowest-power objective and eye-piece&mdash;having a combined magnification of
  only ten diameters. Then he transferred the minute fragments of glass to a
  slide, and, having arranged the lantern as a microscope-lamp, commenced his
  examination.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed presently. "The plot thickens. There is too much glass
  and yet too little; that is to say, there are only one or two fragments here
  that belong to the spectacles; not nearly enough to complete the building up
  of the lenses. The remainder consists of a soft, uneven, moulded glass,
  easily distinguished from the clear, hard optical glass. These foreign
  fragments are all curved, as if they had formed part of a cylinder, and are,
  I should say, portions of a wine-glass or tumbler." He moved the slide once
  or twice, and then continued: "We are in luck, Jervis. Here is a fragment
  with two little diverging lines etched on it, evidently the points of an
  eight-rayed star&mdash;and here is another with three points&mdash;the ends
  of three rays. This enables us to reconstruct the vessel perfectly. It was a
  clear, thin glass&mdash;probably a tumbler&mdash;decorated with scattered
  stars; I dare say you know the pattern. Sometimes there is an ornamented band
  in addition, but generally the stars form the only decoration. Have a look at
  the specimen."</p>

  <p>I had just applied my eye to the microscope when the station-master and
  the inspector came up. Our appearance, seated on the ground with the
  microscope between us, was too much for the police officer's gravity, and he
  laughed long and joyously.</p>

  <p>"You must excuse me, gentlemen," he said apologetically, "but really, you
  know, to an old hand, like myself, it does look a little&mdash;well&mdash;you
  understand&mdash;I dare say a microscope is a very interesting and amusing
  thing, but it doesn't get you much forwarder in a case like this, does
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," replied Thorndyke. "By the way, where did you find the hat,
  after all?"</p>

  <p>"We haven't found it," the inspector replied.</p>

  <p>"Then we must help you to continue the search," said Thorndyke. "If you
  will wait a few moments, we will come with you." He poured a few drops of
  xylol balsam on the cards to fix the reconstituted lenses to their supports
  and then, packing them and the microscope in the case, announced that he was
  ready to start.</p>

  <p>"Is there any village or hamlet near?" he asked the station-master.</p>

  <p>"None nearer than Corfield. That is about half-a-mile from here."</p>

  <p>"And where is the nearest road?"</p>

  <p>"There is a half-made road that runs past a house about three hundred
  yards from here. It belonged to a building estate that was never built. There
  is a footpath from it to the station."</p>

  <p>"Are there any other houses near?"</p>

  <p>"No. That is the only house for half-a-mile round, and there is no other
  road near here."</p>

  <p>"Then the probability is that Brodski approached the railway from that
  direction, as he was found on that side of the permanent way."</p>

  <p>The inspector agreeing with this view, we all set off slowly towards the
  house, piloted by the station-master and searching the ground as we went. The
  waste land over which we passed was covered with patches of docks and
  nettles, through each of which the inspector kicked his way, searching with
  feet and lantern for the missing hat. A walk of three hundred yards brought
  us to a low wall enclosing a garden, beyond which we could see a small house;
  and here we halted while the inspector waded into a large bed of nettles
  beside the wall and kicked vigorously. Suddenly there came a clinking sound
  mingled with objurgations, and the inspector hopped out holding one foot and
  soliloquizing profanely.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what sort of a fool put a thing like that into a bed of
  nettles!" he exclaimed, stroking the injured foot. Thorndyke picked the
  object up and held it in the light of the lantern, displaying a piece of
  three-quarter inch rolled iron bar about a foot long. "It doesn't seem to
  have been there very long," he observed, examining it closely, "there is
  hardly any rust on it."</p>

  <p>"It has been there long enough for me," growled the inspector, "and I'd
  like to bang it on the head of the blighter that put it there."</p>

  <p>Callously indifferent to the inspector's sufferings, Thorndyke continued
  calmly to examine the bar. At length, resting his lantern on the wall, he
  produced his pocket-lens, with which he resumed his investigation, a
  proceeding that so exasperated the inspector that that afflicted official
  limped off in dudgeon, followed by the station-master, and we heard him,
  presently, rapping at the front door of the house.</p>

  <p>"Give me a slide, Jervis, with a drop of Farrant on it," said Thorndyke.
  "There are some fibres sticking to this bar."</p>

  <p>I prepared the slide, and, having handed it to him together with a
  cover-glass, a pair of forceps and a needle, set up the microscope on the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for the inspector," Thorndyke remarked, with his eye applied to
  the little instrument, "but that was a lucky kick for us. Just take a look at
  the specimen."</p>

  <p>I did so, and, having moved the slide about until I had seen the whole of
  the object, I gave my opinion. "Red wool fibres, blue cotton fibres and some
  yellow vegetable fibres that look like jute."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke; "the same combination of fibres as that which we
  found on the dead man's teeth and probably from the same source. This bar has
  probably been wiped on that very curtain or rug with which poor Brodski was
  stifled. We will place it on the wall for future reference, and meanwhile, by
  hook or by crook, we must get into that house. This is much too plain a hint
  to be disregarded."</p>

  <p>Hastily repacking the case, we hurried to the front of the house, where we
  found the two officials looking rather vaguely up the unmade road.</p>

  <p>"There's a light in the house," said the inspector, "but there's no one at
  home. I have knocked a dozen times and got no answer. And I don't see what we
  are hanging about here for at all. The hat is probably close to where the
  body was found, and we shall find it in the morning."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made no reply, but, entering the garden, stepped up the path,
  and having knocked gently at the door, stooped and listened attentively at
  the key-hole.</p>

  <p>"I tell you there's no one in the house, sir," said the inspector
  irritably; and, as Thorndyke continued to listen, he walked away, muttering
  angrily. As soon as he was gone, Thorndyke flashed his lantern over the door,
  the threshold, the path and the small flower-beds; and, from one of the
  latter, I presently saw him stoop and pick something up.</p>

  <p>"Here is a highly instructive object, Jervis," he said, coming out to the
  gate, and displaying a cigarette of which only half-an-inch had been
  smoked.</p>

  <p>"How instructive?" I asked. "What do you learn from it?"</p>

  <p>"Many things," he replied. "It has been lit and thrown away unsmoked; that
  indicates a sudden change of purpose. It was thrown away at the entrance to
  the house, almost certainly by someone entering it. That person was probably
  a stranger, or he would have taken it in with him. But he had not expected to
  enter the house, or he would not have lit it. These are the general
  suggestions; now as to the particular ones. The paper of the cigarette is of
  the kind known as the 'Zig-Zag' brand; the very conspicuous water-mark is
  quite easy to see. Now Brodski's cigarette book was a 'Zig-Zag' book&mdash;so
  called from the way in which the papers pull out. But let us see what the
  tobacco is like." With a pin from his coat, he hooked out from the unburned
  end a wisp of dark, dirty brown tobacco, which he held out for my
  inspection.</p>

  <p>"Fine-cut Latakia," I pronounced, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "Here is a cigarette made of an unusual
  tobacco similar to that in Brodski's pouch and wrapped in an unusual paper
  similar to those in Brodski's cigarette book. With due regard to the fourth
  rule of the syllogism, I suggest that this cigarette was made by Oscar
  Brodski. But, nevertheless, we will look for corroborative detail."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You may have noticed that Brodski's match-box contained round wooden
  vestas&mdash;which are also rather unusual. As he must have lighted the
  cigarette within a few steps of the gate, we ought to be able to find the
  match with which he lighted it. Let us try up the road in the direction from
  which he would probably have approached."</p>

  <p>We walked very slowly up the road, searching the ground with the lantern,
  and we had hardly gone a dozen paces when I espied a match lying on the rough
  path and eagerly picked it up. It was a round wooden vesta.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke examined it with interest and having deposited it, with the
  cigarette, in his "collecting-box," turned to retrace his steps. "There is
  now, Jervis, no reasonable doubt that Brodski was murdered in that house. We
  have succeeded in connecting that house with the crime, and now we have got
  to force an entrance and join up the other clues." We walked quickly back to
  the rear of the premises, where we found the inspector conversing
  disconsolately with the station-master.</p>

  <p>"I think, sir," said the former, "we had better go back now; in fact, I
  don't see what we came here for, but&mdash;here! I say, sir, you mustn't do
  that!" For Thorndyke, without a word of warning, had sprung up lightly and
  thrown one of his long legs over the wall.</p>

  <p>"I can't allow you to enter private premises, sir," continued the
  inspector; but Thorndyke quietly dropped down on the inside and turned to
  face the officer over the wall.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me, inspector," said he. "I have good reasons for
  believing that the dead man, Brodski, has been in this house, in fact, I am
  prepared to swear an information to that effect. But time is precious; we
  must follow the scent while it is hot. And I am not proposing to break into
  the house off-hand. I merely wish to examine the dust-bin."</p>

  <p>"The dust-bin!" gasped the inspector. "Well, you really are a most
  extraordinary gentleman! What do you expect to find in the dust-bin?"</p>

  <p>"I am looking for a broken tumbler or wine-glass. It is a thin glass
  vessel decorated with a pattern of small, eight-pointed stars. It may be in
  the dust-bin or it may be inside the house."</p>

  <p>The inspector hesitated, but Thorndyke's confident manner had evidently
  impressed him.</p>

  <p>"We can soon see what is in the dust-bin," he said, "though what in
  creation a broken tumbler has to do with the case is more than I can
  understand. However, here goes." He sprang up onto the wall, and, as he
  dropped down into the garden, the station-master and I followed.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke lingered a few moments by the gate examining the ground, while
  the two officials hurried up the path. Finding nothing of interest, however,
  he walked towards the house, looking keenly about him as he went; but we were
  hardly half-way up the path when we heard the voice of the inspector calling
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, sir, this way," he sang out, and, as we hurried forward, we
  suddenly came on the two officials standing over a small rubbish-heap and
  looking the picture of astonishment. The glare of their lanterns illuminated
  the heap, and showed us the scattered fragments of a thin glass, star-pattern
  tumbler.</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine how you guessed it was here, sir," said the inspector,
  with a new-born respect in his tone, "nor what you're going to do with it now
  you have found it."</p>

  <p>"It is merely another link in the chain of evidence," said Thorndyke,
  taking a pair of forceps from the case and stooping over the heap. "Perhaps
  we shall find something else." He picked up several small fragments of glass,
  looked at them closely and dropped them again. Suddenly his eye caught a
  small splinter at the base of the heap. Seizing it with the forceps, he held
  it close to his eye in the strong lamplight, and, taking out his lens,
  examined it with minute attention. "Yes," he said at length, "this is what I
  was looking for. Let me have those two cards, Jervis."</p>

  <p>I produced the two visiting-cards with the reconstructed lenses stuck to
  them, and, laying them on the lid of the case, threw the light of the lantern
  on them. Thorndyke looked at them intently for some time, and from them to
  the fragment that he held. Then, turning to the inspector, he said: "You saw
  me pick up this splinter of glass?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied the officer.</p>

  <p>"And you saw where we found these spectacle-glasses and know whose they
  were?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. They are the dead man's spectacles, and you found them where
  the body had been."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; "now observe;" and, as the two officials
  craned forward with parted lips, he laid the little splinter in a gap in one
  of the lenses and then gave it a gentle push forward, when it occupied the
  gap perfectly, joining edge to edge with the adjacent fragments and rendering
  that portion of the lens complete.</p>

  <p>"My God!" exclaimed the inspector. "How on earth did you know?"</p>

  <p>"I must explain that later," said Thorndyke. "Meanwhile we had better have
  a look inside the house. I expect to find there a cigarette&mdash;or possibly
  a cigar&mdash;which has been trodden on, some whole-meal biscuits, possibly a
  wooden vesta, and perhaps even the missing hat."</p>

  <p>At the mention of the hat, the inspector stepped eagerly to the back door,
  but, finding it bolted, he tried the window. This also was securely fastened
  and, on Thorndyke's advice, we went round to the front door.</p>

  <p>"This door is locked too," said the inspector. "I'm afraid we shall have
  to break in. It's a nuisance, though."</p>

  <p>"Have a look at the window," suggested Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The officer did so, struggling vainly to undo the patent catch with his
  pocket-knife.</p>

  <p>"It's no go," he said, coming back to the door. "We shall have to&mdash;?"
  He broke off with an astonished stare, for the door stood open and Thorndyke
  was putting something in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Your friend doesn't waste much time&mdash;even in picking a lock," he
  remarked to me, as we followed Thorndyke into the house; but his reflections
  were soon merged in a new surprise. Thorndyke had preceded us into a small
  sitting-room dimly lighted by a hanging lamp turned down low.</p>

  <p>As we entered he turned up the light and glanced about the room. A
  whisky-bottle was on the table, with a siphon, a tumbler and a biscuit-box.
  Pointing to the latter, Thorndyke said to the inspector: "See what is in that
  box."</p>

  <p>The inspector raised the lid and peeped in, the station-master peered over
  his shoulder, and then both stared at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"How in the name of goodness did you know that there were whole-meal
  biscuits in the house, sir?" exclaimed the station-master.</p>

  <p>"You'd be disappointed if I told you," replied Thorndyke. "But look at
  this." He pointed to the hearth, where lay a flattened, half-smoked cigarette
  and a round wooden vesta. The inspector gazed at these objects in silent
  wonder, while, as to the station-master, he continued to stare at Thorndyke
  with what I can only describe as superstitious awe.</p>

  <p>"You have the dead man's property with you, I believe?" said my
  colleague.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the inspector; "I put the things in my pocket for
  safety."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, picking up the flattened cigarette, "let us have a
  look at his tobacco-pouch."</p>

  <p>As the officer produced and opened the pouch, Thorndyke neatly cut open
  the cigarette with his sharp pocket-knife. "Now," said he, "what kind of
  tobacco is in the pouch?"</p>

  <p>The inspector took out a pinch, looked at it and smelt it distastefully.
  "It's one of those stinking tobaccos," he said, "that they put in
  mixtures&mdash;Latakia, I think."</p>

  <p>"And what is this?" asked Thorndyke, pointing to the open cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Same stuff, undoubtedly," replied the inspector.</p>

  <p>"And now let us see his cigarette papers," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The little book, or rather packet&mdash;for it consisted of separated
  papers&mdash;was produced from the officer's pocket and a sample paper
  abstracted. Thorndyke laid the half-burnt paper beside it, and the inspector,
  having examined the two, held them up to the light.</p>

  <p>"There isn't much chance of mistaking that 'Zig-Zag' watermark," he said.
  "This cigarette was made by the deceased; there can't be the shadow of a
  doubt."</p>

  <p>"One more point," said Thorndyke, laying the burnt wooden vesta on the
  table. "You have his match-box?"</p>

  <p>The inspector brought forth the little silver casket, opened it and
  compared the wooden vestas that it contained with the burnt end. Then he shut
  the box with a snap.</p>

  <p>"You've proved it up to the hilt," said he. "If we could only find the
  hat, we should have a complete case."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that we haven't found the hat," said Thorndyke. "You notice
  that something besides coal has been burned in the grate."</p>

  <p>The inspector ran eagerly to the fire-place and began with feverish hands,
  to pick out the remains of the extinct fire. "The cinders are still warm," he
  said, "and they are certainly not all coal cinders. There has been wood
  burned here on top of the coal, and these little black lumps are neither coal
  nor wood. They may quite possibly be the remains of a burnt hat, but, lord!
  who can tell? You can put together the pieces of broken spectacle-glasses,
  but you can't build up a hat out of a few cinders." He held out a handful of
  little, black, spongy cinders and looked ruefully at Thorndyke, who took them
  from him and laid them out on a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"We can't reconstitute the hat, certainly," my friend agreed, "but we may
  be able to ascertain the origin of these remains. They may not be cinders of
  a hat, after all." He lit a wax match and, taking up one of the charred
  fragments, applied the flame to it. The cindery mass fused at once with a
  crackling, seething sound, emitting a dense smoke, and instantly the air
  became charged with a pungent, resinous odour mingled with the smell of
  burning animal matter.</p>

  <p>"Smells like varnish," the station-master remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Shellac," said Thorndyke; "so the first test gives a positive
  result. The next test will take more time."</p>

  <p>He opened the green case and took from it a little flask, fitted for
  Marsh's arsenic test, with a safety funnel and escape tube, a small folding
  tripod, a spirit lamp and a disc of asbestos to serve as a sand-bath.
  Dropping into the flask several of the cindery masses, selected after careful
  inspection, he filled it up with alcohol and placed it on the disc, which he
  rested on the tripod. Then he lighted the spirit lamp underneath and sat down
  to wait for the alcohol to boil.</p>

  <p>"There is one little point that we may as well settle," he said presently,
  as the bubbles began to rise in the flask. "Give me a slide with a drop of
  Farrant on it, Jervis."</p>

  <p>I prepared the slide while Thorndyke, with a pair of forceps, picked out a
  tiny wisp from the table-cloth. "I fancy we have seen this fabric before," he
  remarked, as he laid the little pinch of fluff in the mounting fluid and
  slipped the slide onto the stage of the microscope. "Yes," he continued,
  looking into the eye-piece, "here are our old acquaintances, the red wool
  fibres, the blue cotton and the yellow jute. We must label this at once or we
  may confuse it with the other specimens."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea how the deceased met his death?" the inspector
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "I take it that the murderer enticed him into
  this room and gave him some refreshments. The murderer sat in the chair in
  which you are sitting, Brodski sat in that small arm-chair. Then I imagine
  the murderer attacked him with that iron bar that you found among the
  nettles, failed to kill him at the first stroke, struggled with him and
  finally suffocated him with the table-cloth. By the way, there is just one
  more point. You recognize this piece of string?" He took from his
  "collecting-box" the little end of twine that had been picked up by the line.
  The inspector nodded. "Look behind you, you will see where it came from."</p>

  <p>The officer turned sharply and his eye lighted on a string-box on the
  mantelpiece. He lifted it down, and Thorndyke drew out from it a length of
  white twine with one green strand, which he compared with the piece in his
  hand. "The green strand in it makes the identification fairly certain," he
  said. "Of course the string was used to secure the umbrella and hand-bag. He
  could not have carried them in his hand, encumbered as he was with the
  corpse. But I expect our other specimen is ready now." He lifted the flask
  off the tripod, and, giving it a vigorous shake, examined the contents
  through his lens. The alcohol had now become dark-brown in colour, and was
  noticeably thicker and more syrupy in consistence.</p>

  <p>"I think we have enough here for a rough test," said he, selecting a
  pipette and a slide from the case. He dipped the former into the flask and,
  having sucked up a few drops of the alcohol from the bottom, held the pipette
  over the slide on which he allowed the contained fluid to drop.</p>

  <p>Laying a cover-glass on the little pool of alcohol, he put the slide on
  the microscope stage and examined it attentively, while we watched him in
  expectant silence.</p>

  <p>At length he looked up, and, addressing the inspector, asked: "Do you know
  what felt hats are made of?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I do, sir," replied the officer.</p>

  <p>"Well, the better quality hats are made of rabbits' and hares'
  wool&mdash;the soft under-fur, you know&mdash;cemented together with shellac.
  Now there is very little doubt that these cinders contain shellac, and with
  the microscope I find a number of small hairs of a rabbit. I have, therefore,
  little hesitation in saying that these cinders are the remains of a hard felt
  hat; and, as the hairs do not appear to be dyed, I should say it was a grey
  hat."</p>

  <p>At this moment our conclave was interrupted by hurried footsteps on the
  garden path and, as we turned with one accord, an elderly woman burst into
  the room.</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment in mute astonishment, and then, looking from one to
  the other, demanded: "Who are you? and what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The inspector rose. "I am a police officer, madam," said he. "I can't give
  you any further information just now, but, if you will excuse me asking, who
  are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am Mr. Hickler's housekeeper," she replied.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Hickler; are you expecting him home shortly?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am not," was the curt reply. "Mr. Hickler is away from home just
  now. He left this evening by the boat train."</p>

  <p>"For Amsterdam?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I believe so, though I don't see what business it is of yours," the
  housekeeper answered.</p>

  <p>"I thought he might, perhaps, be a diamond broker or merchant," said
  Thorndyke. "A good many of them travel by that train."</p>

  <p>"So he is," said the woman, "at least, he has something to do with
  diamonds."</p>

  <p>"Ah. Well, we must be going, Jervis," said Thorndyke, "we have finished
  here, and we have to find an hotel or inn. Can I have a word with you,
  inspector?"</p>

  <p>The officer, now entirely humble and reverent, followed us out into the
  garden to receive Thorndyke's parting advice.</p>

  <p>"You had better take possession of the house at once, and get rid of the
  housekeeper. Nothing must be removed. Preserve those cinders and see that the
  rubbish-heap is not disturbed, and, above all, don't have the room swept. An
  officer will be sent to relieve you."</p>

  <p>With a friendly "good-night" we went on our way, guided by the
  station-master; and here our connection with the case came to an end. Hickler
  (whose Christian name turned out to be Silas) was, it is true, arrested as he
  stepped ashore from the steamer, and a packet of diamonds, subsequently
  identified as the property of Oscar Brodski, found upon his person. But he
  was never brought to trial, for on the return voyage he contrived to elude
  his guards for an instant as the ship was approaching the English coast, and
  it was not until three days later, when a hand-cuffed body was cast up on the
  lonely shore by Orfordness, that the authorities knew the fate of Silas
  Hickler.</p>

  <p>"An appropriate and dramatic end to a singular and yet typical case," said
  Thorndyke, as he put down the newspaper. "I hope it has enlarged your
  knowledge, Jervis, and enabled you to form one or two useful
  corollaries."</p>

  <p>"I prefer to hear you sing the medico-legal doxology," I answered, turning
  upon him like the proverbial worm and grinning derisively (which the worm
  does not).</p>

  <p>"I know you do," he retorted, with mock gravity, "and I lament your lack
  of mental initiative. However, the points that this case illustrates are
  these: First, the danger of delay; the vital importance of instant action
  before that frail and fleeting thing that we call a clue has time to
  evaporate. A delay of a few hours would have left us with hardly a single
  datum. Second, the necessity of pursuing the most trivial clue to an absolute
  finish, as illustrated by the spectacles. Third, the urgent need of a trained
  scientist to aid the police; and, last," he concluded, with a smile, "we
  learn never to go abroad without the invaluable green case."</p>

  <h2><a name="c3"
     id="c3"></a>II. &mdash; A CASE OF PREMEDITATION</h2>

  <h3>PART I. &mdash; THE ELIMINATION OF MR. PRATT</h3>

  <p class="firat">THE wine merchant who should supply a consignment of petit
  vin to a customer who had ordered, and paid for, a vintage wine, would render
  himself subject to unambiguous comment. Nay! more; he would be liable to
  certain legal penalties. And yet his conduct would be morally
  indistinguishable from that of the railway company which, having accepted a
  first-class fare, inflicts upon the passenger that kind of company which he
  has paid to avoid. But the corporate conscience, as Herbert Spencer was wont
  to explain, is an altogether inferior product to that of the individual.</p>

  <p>Such were the reflections of Mr. Rufus Pembury when, as the train was
  about to move out of Maidstone (West) station, a coarse and burly man
  (clearly a denizen of the third-class) was ushered into his compartment by
  the guard. He had paid the higher fare, not for cushioned seats, but for
  seclusion or, at least, select companionship. The man's entry had deprived
  him of both, and he resented it.</p>

  <p>But if the presence of this stranger involved a breach of contract, his
  conduct was a positive affront&mdash;an indignity; for, no sooner had the
  train started than he fixed upon Mr. Pembury a gaze of impertinent intensity,
  and continued thereafter to regard him with a stare as steady and unwinking
  as that of a Polynesian idol.</p>

  <p>It was offensive to a degree, and highly disconcerting withal. Mr. Pembury
  fidgeted in his seat with increasing discomfort and rising temper. He looked
  into his pocket-book, read one or two letters and sorted a collection of
  visiting-cards. He even thought of opening his umbrella. Finally, his
  patience exhausted and his wrath mounting to boiling-point, he turned to the
  stranger with frosty remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"I imagine, sir, that you will have no difficulty in recognizing me,
  should we ever meet again&mdash;which God forbid."</p>

  <p>"I should recognize you among ten thousand," was the reply, so unexpected
  as to leave Mr. Pembury speechless.</p>

  <p>"You see," the stranger continued impressively, "I've got the gift of
  faces. I never forget."</p>

  <p>"That must be a great consolation," said Pembury.</p>

  <p>"It's very useful to me," said the stranger, "at least, it used to be,
  when I was a warder at Portland&mdash;you remember me, I dare say: my name is
  Pratt. I was assistant-warder in your time. God-forsaken hole, Portland, and
  mighty glad I was when they used to send me up to town on reckernizing duty.
  Holloway was the house of detention then, you remember; that was before they
  moved to Brixton."</p>

  <p>Pratt paused in his reminiscences, and Pembury, pale and gasping with
  astonishment, pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, "you must be mistaking me for someone else."</p>

  <p>"I don't," replied Pratt. "You're Francis Dobbs, that's who you are.
  Slipped away from Portland one evening about twelve years ago. Clothes washed
  up on the Bill next day. No trace of fugitive. As neat a mizzle as ever I
  heard of. But there are a couple of photographs and a set of fingerprints at
  the Habitual Criminals Register. P'r'aps you'd like to come and see 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I go to the Habitual Criminals Register?" Pembury demanded
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Exactly. Why should you? When you are a man of means, and a little
  judiciously invested capital would render it unnecessary?"</p>

  <p>Pembury looked out of the window, and for a minute or more preserved a
  stony silence. At length he turned suddenly to Pratt. "How much?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think a couple of hundred a year would hurt you," was the
  calm reply.</p>

  <p>Pembury reflected awhile. "What makes you think I am a man of means?" he
  asked presently.</p>

  <p>Pratt smiled grimly. "Bless you, Mr. Pembury," said he, "I know all about
  you. Why, for the last six months I have been living within half-a-mile of
  your house."</p>

  <p>"The devil you have!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. When I retired from the service, General O'Gorman engaged me as a
  sort of steward or caretaker of his little place at Baysford&mdash;he's very
  seldom there himself&mdash;and the very day after I came down, I met you and
  spotted you, but, naturally, I kept out of sight myself. Thought I'd find out
  whether you were good for anything before I spoke, so I've been keeping my
  ears open and I find you are good for a couple of hundred."</p>

  <p>There was an interval of silence, and then the ex-warder
  resumed&mdash;"That's what comes of having a memory for faces. Now there's
  Jack Ellis, on the other hand; he must have had you under his nose for a
  couple of years, and yet he's never twigged&mdash;he never will either,"
  added Pratt, already regretting the confidence into which his vanity had led
  him.</p>

  <p>"Who is Jack Ellis?" Pembury demanded sharply.</p>

  <p>"Why, he's a sort of supernumerary at the Baysford Police Station; does
  odd jobs; rural detective, helps in the office and that sort of thing. He was
  in the Civil Guard at Portland, in your time, but he got his left forefinger
  chopped off, so they pensioned him, and, as he was a Baysford man, he got
  this billet. But he'll never reckernize you, don't you fear."</p>

  <p>"Unless you direct his attention to me," suggested Pembury.</p>

  <p>"There's no fear of that," laughed Pratt. "You can trust me to sit quiet
  on my own nest-egg. Besides, we're not very friendly. He came nosing round
  our place after the parlourmaid&mdash;him a married man, mark you! But I soon
  boosted him out, I can tell you; and Jack Ellis don't like me now."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Pembury reflectively; then, after a pause, he asked: "Who is
  this General O'Gorman? I seem to know the name."</p>

  <p>"I expect you do," said Pratt. "He was governor of Dartmoor when I was
  there&mdash;that was my last billet&mdash;and, let me tell you, if he'd been
  at Portland in your time, you'd never have got away."</p>

  <p>"How is that?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you see, the general is a great man on bloodhounds. He kept a pack
  at Dartmoor and, you bet, those lags knew it. There were no attempted escapes
  in those days. They wouldn't have had a chance."</p>

  <p>"He has the pack still, hasn't he?" asked Pembury.</p>

  <p>"Rather. Spends any amount of time on training 'em, too. He's always
  hoping there'll be a burglary or a murder in the neighbourhood so as he can
  try 'em, but he's never got a chance yet. P'r'aps the crooks have heard about
  'em. But, to come back to our little arrangement: what do you say to a couple
  of hundred, paid quarterly, if you like?"</p>

  <p>"I can't settle the matter off-hand," said Pembury. "You must give me time
  to think it over."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Pratt. "I shall be back at Baysford to-morrow evening.
  That will give you a clear day to think it over. Shall I look in at your
  place to-morrow night?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Pembury; "you'd better not be seen at my house, nor I at
  yours. If I meet you at some quiet spot, where we shan't be seen, we can
  settle our business without any one knowing that we have met. It won't take
  long, and we can't be too careful."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed Pratt. "Well, I'll tell you what. There's an avenue
  leading up to our house; you know it, I expect. There's no lodge, and the
  gates are always ajar, excepting at night. Now I shall be down by the
  six-thirty at Baysford. Our place is a quarter of an hour from the station.
  Say you meet me in the avenue at a quarter to seven."</p>

  <p>"That will suit me," said Pembury; "that is, if you are sure the
  bloodhounds won't be straying about the grounds."</p>

  <p>"Lord bless you, no!" laughed Pratt. "D'you suppose the general lets his
  precious hounds stray about for any casual crook to feed with poisoned
  sausage? No, they're locked up safe in the kennels at the back of the house.
  Hallo! This'll be Swanley, I expect. I'll change into a smoker here and leave
  you time to turn the matter over in your mind. So long. To-morrow evening in
  the avenue at a quarter to seven. And, I say, Mr. Pembury, you might as well
  bring the first installment with you&mdash;fifty, in small notes or
  gold."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Mr. Pembury. He spoke coldly enough, but there was a
  flush on his cheeks and an angry light in his eyes, which, perhaps, the
  ex-warder noticed; for when he had stepped out and shut the door, he thrust
  his head in at the window and said threateningly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"One more word, Mr. Pembury-Dobbs: no hanky-panky, you know. I'm an old
  hand and pretty fly, I am. So don't you try any chickery-pokery on me. That's
  all." He withdrew his head and disappeared, leaving Pembury to his
  reflections.</p>

  <p>The nature of those reflections&mdash;if some telepathist transferring his
  attention for the moment from hidden courtyards or missing thimbles to more
  practical matters&mdash;could have conveyed them into the mind of Mr. Pratt,
  would have caused that quondam official some surprise and, perhaps, a little
  disquiet. For long experience of the criminal, as he appears when in durance,
  had produced some rather misleading ideas as to his behaviour when at large.
  In fact, the ex-warder had considerably under-estimated the ex-convict.</p>

  <p>Rufus Pembury, to give his real name&mdash;for Dobbs was literally a nom
  de guerre&mdash;was a man of strong character and intelligence. So much so
  that, having tried the criminal career and found it not worth pursuing, he
  had definitely abandoned it. When the cattle-boat that picked him up off
  Portland Bill had landed him at an American port, he brought his entire
  ability and energy to bear on legitimate commercial pursuits, and with such
  success that, at the end of ten years, he was able to return to England with
  a moderate competence. Then he had taken a modest house near the little town
  of Baysford, where he had lived quietly on his savings for the last two
  years, holding aloof without much difficulty from the rather exclusive local
  society; and here he might have lived out the rest of his life in peace but
  for the unlucky chance that brought the man Pratt into the neighbourhood.
  With the arrival of Pratt his security was utterly destroyed.</p>

  <p>There is something eminently unsatisfactory about a blackmailer. No
  arrangement with him has any permanent validity. No undertaking that he gives
  is binding. The thing which he has sold remains in his possession to sell
  over again. He pockets the price of emancipation, but retains the key of the
  fetters. In short, the blackmailer is a totally impossible person.</p>

  <p>Such were the considerations that had passed through the mind of Rufus
  Pembury, even while Pratt was making his proposals; and those proposals he
  had never for an instant entertained. The ex-warder's advice to him to "turn
  the matter over in his mind" was unnecessary. For his mind was already made
  up. His decision was arrived at in the very moment when Pratt had disclosed
  his identity. The conclusion was self-evident. Before Pratt appeared he was
  living in peace and security. While Pratt remained, his liberty was
  precarious from moment to moment. If Pratt should disappear, his peace and
  security would return. Therefore Pratt must be eliminated.</p>

  <p>It was a logical consequence.</p>

  <p>The profound meditations, therefore, in which Pembury remained immersed
  for the remainder of the journey, had nothing whatever to do with the
  quarterly allowance; they were concerned exclusively with the elimination of
  ex-warder Pratt.</p>

  <p>Now Rufus Pembury was not a ferocious man. He was not even cruel. But he
  was gifted with a certain magnanimous cynicism which ignored the trivialities
  of sentiment and regarded only the main issues. If a wasp hummed over his
  tea-cup, he would crush that wasp; but not with his bare hand. The wasp
  carried the means of aggression. That was the wasp's look-out. His concern
  was to avoid being stung.</p>

  <p>So it was with Pratt. The man had elected, for his own profit, to threaten
  Pembury's liberty. Very well. He had done it at his own risk. That risk was
  no concern of Pembury's. His concern was his own safety.</p>

  <p>When Pembury alighted at Charing Cross, he directed his steps (after
  having watched Pratt's departure from the station) to Buckingham Street,
  Strand, where he entered a quiet private hotel. He was apparently expected,
  for the manageress greeted him by his name as she handed him his key.</p>

  <p>"Are you staying in town, Mr. Pembury?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "I go back to-morrow morning, but I may be coming up
  again shortly. By the way, you used to have an encyclopaedia in one of the
  rooms. Could I see it for a moment?"</p>

  <p>"It is in the drawing-room," said the manageress. "Shall I show
  you&mdash;but you know the way, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Certainly Mr. Pembury knew the way. It was on the first floor; a pleasant
  old-world room looking on the quiet old street; and on a shelf, amidst a
  collection of novels, stood the sedate volumes of Chambers's
  Encyclopaedia.</p>

  <p>That a gentleman from the country should desire to look up the subject of
  "hounds" would not, to a casual observer, have seemed unnatural. But when
  from hounds the student proceeded to the article on blood, and thence to one
  devoted to perfumes, the observer might reasonably have felt some surprise;
  and this surprise might have been augmented if he had followed Mr. Pembury's
  subsequent proceedings, and specially if he had considered them as the
  actions of a man whose immediate aim was the removal of a superfluous unit of
  the population.</p>

  <p>Having deposited his bag and umbrella in his room, Pembury set forth from
  the hotel as one with a definite purpose; and his footsteps led, in the first
  place, to an umbrella shop on the Strand, where he selected a thick rattan
  cane. There was nothing remarkable in this, perhaps; but the cane was of an
  uncomely thickness and the salesman protested. "I like a thick cane," said
  Pembury.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; but for a gentleman of your height" (Pembury was a small,
  slightly-built man) "I would venture to suggest&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I like a thick cane," repeated Pembury. "Cut it down to the proper length
  and don't rivet the ferrule on. I'll cement it on when I get home."</p>

  <p>His next investment would have seemed more to the purpose, though
  suggestive of unexpected crudity of method. It was a large Norwegian knife.
  But not content with this he went on forthwith to a second cutler's and
  purchased a second knife, the exact duplicate of the first. Now, for what
  purpose could he want two identically similar knives? And why not have bought
  them both at the same shop? It was highly mysterious.</p>

  <p>Shopping appeared to be a positive mania with Rufus Pembury. In the course
  of the next half-hour he acquired a cheap hand-bag, an artist's
  black-japanned brush-case, a three-cornered file, a stick of elastic glue and
  a pair of iron crucible-tongs. Still insatiable, he repaired to an
  old-fashioned chemist's shop in a by-street, where he further enriched
  himself with a packet of absorbent cotton-wool and an ounce of permanganate
  of potash; and, as the chemist wrapped up these articles, with the occult and
  necromantic air peculiar to chemists, Pembury watched him impassively.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you don't keep musk?" he asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>The chemist paused in the act of heating a stick of sealing-wax, and
  appeared as if about to mutter an incantation. But he merely replied: "No,
  sir. Not the solid musk; it's so very costly. But I have the essence."</p>

  <p>"That isn't as strong as the pure stuff, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the chemist, with a cryptic smile, "not so strong, but
  strong enough. These animal perfumes are so very penetrating, you know; and
  so lasting. Why, I venture to say that if you were to sprinkle a
  table-spoonful of the essence in the middle of St. Paul's, the place would
  smell of it six months hence."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so!" said Pembury. "Well, that ought to be enough for
  anybody. I'll take a small quantity, please, and, for goodness' sake, see
  that there isn't any on the outside of the bottle. The stuff isn't for
  myself, and I don't want to go about smelling like a civet cat."</p>

  <p>"Naturally you don't, sir," agreed the chemist. He then produced an ounce
  bottle, a small glass funnel and a stoppered bottle labelled "Ess. Moschi,"
  with which he proceeded to perform a few trifling feats of legerdemain.</p>

  <p>"There, sir," said he, when he had finished the performance, "there is not
  a drop on the outside of the bottle, and, if I fit it with a rubber cork, you
  will be quite secure."</p>

  <p>Pembury's dislike of musk appeared to be excessive, for, when the chemist
  had retired into a secret cubicle as if to hold converse with some familiar
  spirit (but actually to change half-a-crown), he took the brush-case from his
  bag, pulled off its lid, and then, with the crucible-tongs, daintily lifted
  the bottle off the counter, slid it softly into the brush-case, and,
  replacing the lid, returned the case and tongs to the bag. The other two
  packets he took from the counter and dropped into his pocket, and, when the
  presiding wizard, having miraculously transformed a single half-crown into
  four pennies, handed him the product, he left the shop and walked
  thoughtfully back towards the Strand. Suddenly a new idea seemed to strike
  him. He halted, considered for a few moments and then strode away northward
  to make the oddest of all his purchases.</p>

  <p>The transaction took place in a shop in the Seven Dials, whose strange
  stock-in-trade ranged the whole zoological gamut, from water-snails to Angora
  cats. Pembury looked at a cage of guinea-pigs in the window and entered the
  shop.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to have a dead guinea-pig?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No; mine are all alive," replied the man, adding, with a sinister grin:
  "But they're not immortal, you know."</p>

  <p>Pembury looked at the man distastefully. There is an appreciable
  difference between a guinea-pig and a blackmailer. "Any small mammal would
  do," he said.</p>

  <p>"There's a dead rat in that cage, if he's any good," said the man. "Died
  this morning, so he's quite fresh."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the rat," said Pembury; "he'll do quite well."</p>

  <p>The little corpse was accordingly made into a parcel and deposited in the
  bag, and Pembury, having tendered a complimentary fee, made his way back to
  the hotel.</p>

  <p>After a modest lunch he went forth and spent the remainder of the day
  transacting the business which had originally brought him to town. He dined
  at a restaurant and did not return to his hotel until ten o'clock, when he
  took his key, and tucking under his arm a parcel that he had brought in with
  him, retired for the night. But before undressing&mdash;and after locking his
  door&mdash;he did a very strange and unaccountable thing. Having pulled off
  the loose ferrule from his newly-purchased cane, he bored a hole in the
  bottom of it with the spike end of the file. Then, using the latter as a
  broach, he enlarged the hole until only a narrow rim of the bottom was left.
  He next rolled up a small ball of cottonwool and pushed it into the ferrule;
  and having smeared the end of the cane with elastic glue, he replaced the
  ferrule, warming it over the gas to make the glue stick.</p>

  <p>When he had finished with the cane, he turned his attention to one of the
  Norwegian knives. First, he carefully removed with the file most of the
  bright, yellow varnish from the wooden case or handle.</p>

  <p>Then he opened the knife, and, cutting the string of the parcel that he
  had brought in, took from it the dead rat which he had bought at the
  zoologist's. Laying the animal on a sheet of paper, he cut off its head, and,
  holding it up by the tail, allowed the blood that oozed from the neck to drop
  on the knife, spreading it over both sides of the blade and handle with his
  finger.</p>

  <p>Then he laid the knife on the paper and softly opened the window. From the
  darkness below came the voice of a cat, apparently perfecting itself in the
  execution of chromatic scales; and in that direction Pembury flung the body
  and head of the rat, and closed the window. Finally, having washed his hands
  and stuffed the paper from the parcel into the fire-place, he went to
  bed.</p>

  <p>But his proceedings in the morning were equally mysterious. Having
  breakfasted betimes, he returned to his bedroom and locked himself in. Then
  he tied his new cane, handle downwards, to the leg of the dressing-table.
  Next, with the crucible-tongs, he drew the little bottle of musk from the
  brush-case, and, having assured himself, by sniffing at it, that the exterior
  was really free from odour, he withdrew the rubber cork. Then, slowly and
  with infinite care, he poured a few drops&mdash;perhaps
  half-a-teaspoonful&mdash;of the essence on the cotton-wool that bulged
  through the hole in the ferrule, watching the absorbent material narrowly as
  it soaked up the liquid. When it was saturated he proceeded to treat the
  knife in the same fashion, letting fall a drop of the essence on the wooden
  handle&mdash;which soaked it up readily. This done, he slid up the window and
  looked out. Immediately below was a tiny yard in which grew, or rather
  survived, a couple of faded laurel bushes. The body of the rat was nowhere to
  be seen; it had apparently been spirited away in the night. Holding out the
  bottle, which he still held, he dropped it into the bushes, flinging the
  rubber cork after it.</p>

  <p>His next proceeding was to take a tube of vaseline from his dressing-bag
  and squeeze a small quantity onto his fingers. With this he thoroughly
  smeared the shoulder of the brush-case and the inside of the lid, so as to
  ensure an air-tight joint. Having wiped his fingers, he picked the knife up
  with the crucible-tongs, and, dropping it into the brush-case, immediately
  pushed on the lid. Then he heated the tips of the tongs in the gas flame to
  destroy the scent, packed the tongs and brush-case in the bag, untied the
  cane&mdash;carefully avoiding contact with the ferrule&mdash;and, taking up
  the two bags, went out, holding the cane by its middle.</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty in finding an empty compartment, for first-class
  passengers were few at that time in the morning. Pembury waited on the
  platform until the guard's whistle sounded, when he stepped into the
  compartment, shut the door and laid the cane on the seat with its ferrule
  projecting out of the off-side window, in which position it remained until
  the train drew up in Baysford station.</p>

  <p>Pembury left his dressing-bag at the cloak-room, and, still grasping the
  cane by its middle, he sallied forth. The town of Baysford lay some
  half-a-mile to the east of the station; his own house was a mile along the
  road to the west; and half-way between his house and the station was the
  residence of General O'Gorman. He knew the place well. Originally a
  farmhouse, it stood on the edge of a great expanse of flat meadows and
  communicated with the road by an avenue, nearly three hundred yards long, of
  ancient trees. The avenue was shut off from the road by a pair of iron gates,
  but these were merely ornamental, for the place was unenclosed and accessible
  from the surrounding meadows&mdash;indeed, an indistinct footpath crossed the
  meadows and intersected the avenue about half-way up.</p>

  <p>On this occasion Pembury, whose objective was the avenue, elected to
  approach it by the latter route; and at each stile or fence that he
  surmounted, he paused to survey the country. Presently the avenue arose
  before him, lying athwart the narrow track, and, as he entered it between two
  of the trees, he halted and looked about him.</p>

  <p>He stood listening for a while. Beyond the faint rustle of leaves no sound
  was to be heard. Evidently there was no one about, and, as Pratt was at
  large, it was probable that the general was absent.</p>

  <p>And now Pembury began to examine the adjacent trees with more than a
  casual interest. The two between which he had entered were respectively an
  elm and a great pollard oak, the latter being an immense tree whose huge,
  warty bole divided about seven feet from the ground into three limbs, each as
  large as a fair-sized tree, of which the largest swept outward in a great
  curve half-way across the avenue. On this patriarch Pembury bestowed especial
  attention, walking completely round it and finally laying down his bag and
  cane (the latter resting on the bag with the ferrule off the ground) that he
  might climb up, by the aid of the warty outgrowths, to examine the crown; and
  he had just stepped up into the space between the three limbs, when the
  creaking of the iron gates was followed by a quick step in the avenue.
  Hastily he let himself down from the tree, and, gathering up his possessions,
  stood close behind the great bole.</p>

  <p>"Just as well not to be seen," was his reflection, as he hugged the tree
  closely and waited, peering cautiously round the trunk. Soon a streak of
  moving shadow heralded the stranger's approach, and he moved round to keep
  the trunk between himself and the intruder. On the footsteps came, until the
  stranger was abreast of the tree; and when he had passed Pembury peeped round
  at the retreating figure. It was only the postman, but then the man knew him,
  and he was glad he had kept out of sight.</p>

  <p>Apparently the oak did not meet his requirements, for he stepped out and
  looked up and down the avenue. Then, beyond the elm, he caught sight of an
  ancient pollard hornbeam&mdash;a strange, fantastic tree whose trunk widened
  out trumpet-like above into a broad crown, from the edge of which
  multitudinous branches uprose like the limbs of some weird hamadryad.</p>

  <p>That tree he approved at a glance, but he lingered behind the oak until
  the postman, returning with brisk step and cheerful whistle, passed down the
  avenue and left him once more in solitude. Then he moved on with a resolute
  air to the hornbeam.</p>

  <p>The crown of the trunk was barely six feet from the ground. He could reach
  it easily, as he found on trying. Standing the cane against the
  tree&mdash;ferrule downwards, this time&mdash;he took the brush-case from the
  bag, pulled off the lid, and, with the crucible-tongs, lifted out the knife
  and laid it on the crown of the tree, just out of sight, leaving the tongs
  also invisible&mdash;still grasping the knife. He was about to replace the
  brush-case in the bag, when he appeared to alter his mind. Sniffing at it,
  and finding it reeking with the sickly perfume, he pushed the lid on again
  and threw the case up into the tree, where he heard it roll down into the
  central hollow of the crown. Then he closed the bag, and, taking the cane by
  its handle, moved slowly away in the direction whence he had come, passing
  out of the avenue between the elm and the oak.</p>

  <p>His mode of progress was certainly peculiar. He walked with excessive
  slowness, trailing the cane along the ground, and every few paces he would
  stop and press the ferrule firmly against the earth, so that, to any one who
  should have observed him, he would have appeared to be wrapped in an
  absorbing reverie.</p>

  <p>Thus he moved on across the fields, not, however, returning to the high
  road, but crossing another stretch of fields until he emerged into a narrow
  lane that led out into the High Street. Immediately opposite to the lane was
  the police station, distinguished from the adjacent cottages only by its
  lamp, its open door and the notices pasted up outside. Straight across the
  road Pembury walked, still trailing the cane, and halted at the station door
  to read the notices, resting his cane on the doorstep as he did so. Through
  the open doorway he could see a man writing at a desk. The man's back was
  towards him, but, presently, a movement brought his left hand into view, and
  Pembury noted that the forefinger was missing. This, then, was Jack Ellis,
  late of the Civil Guard at Portland.</p>

  <p>Even while he was looking the man turned his head, and Pembury recognized
  him at once. He had frequently met him on the road between Baysford and the
  adjoining village of Thorpe, and always at the same time. Apparently Ellis
  paid a daily visit to Thorpe&mdash;perhaps to receive a report from the rural
  constable&mdash;and he started between three and four and returned between
  seven and a quarter past.</p>

  <p>Pembury looked at his watch. It was a quarter past three. He moved away
  thoughtfully (holding his cane, now, by the middle), and began to walk slowly
  in the direction of Thorpe&mdash;westward.</p>

  <p>For a while he was deeply meditative, and his face wore a puzzled frown.
  Then, suddenly, his face cleared and he strode forward at a brisker pace.
  Presently he passed through a gap in the hedge, and, walking in a field
  parallel with the road, took out his purse&mdash;a small pigskin pouch.</p>

  <p>Having frugally emptied it of its contents, excepting a few shillings, he
  thrust the ferrule of his cane into the small compartment ordinarily reserved
  for gold or notes.</p>

  <p>And thus he continued to walk on slowly, carrying the cane by the middle
  and the purse jammed on the end.</p>

  <p>At length he reached a sharp double curve in the road whence he could see
  back for a considerable distance; and here opposite a small opening, he sat
  down to wait. The hedge screened him effectually from the gaze of
  passers-by&mdash;though these were few enough&mdash;without interfering with
  his view.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour passed. He began to be uneasy. Had he been mistaken?
  Were Ellis's visits only occasional instead of daily, as he had thought? That
  would be tiresome though not actually disastrous. But at this point in his
  reflections a figure came into view, advancing along the road with a steady
  swing. He recognized the figure. It was Ellis.</p>

  <p>But there was another figure advancing from the opposite direction: a
  labourer, apparently. He prepared to shift his ground, but another glance
  showed him that the labourer would pass first. He waited. The labourer came
  on and, at length, passed the opening, and, as he did so, Ellis disappeared
  for a moment in a bend of the road. Instantly Pembury passed his cane through
  the opening in the hedge, shook off the purse and pushed it into the middle
  of the foot-way. Then he crept forward, behind the hedge, towards the
  approaching official, and again sat down to wait. On came the steady tramp of
  the unconscious Ellis, and, as it passed, Pembury drew aside an obstructing
  branch and peered out at the retreating figure. The question now was, would
  Ellis see the purse? It was not a very conspicuous object.</p>

  <p>The footsteps stopped abruptly. Looking out, Pembury saw the police
  official stoop, pick up the purse, examine its contents and finally stow it
  in his trousers pocket. Pembury heaved a sigh of relief; and, as the
  dwindling figure passed out of sight round a curve in the road, he rose,
  stretched himself and strode away briskly.</p>

  <p>Near the gap was a group of ricks, and, as he passed them, a fresh idea
  suggested itself. Looking round quickly he passed to the farther side of one
  and, thrusting his cane deeply into it, pushed it home with a piece of stick
  that he picked up near the rick, until the handle was lost among the straw.
  The bag was now all that was left, and it was empty&mdash;for his other
  purchases were in the dressing-bag, which, by the way, he must fetch from the
  station. He opened it and smelt the interior, but, though he could detect no
  odour, he resolved to be rid of it if possible.</p>

  <p>As he emerged from the gap a wagon jogged slowly past. It was piled high
  with sacks, and the tail-board was down. Stepping into the road, he quickly
  overtook the wagon, and, having glanced round, laid the bag lightly on the
  tail-board. Then he set off for the station.</p>

  <p>On arriving home he went straight up to his bedroom, and, ringing for his
  housekeeper, ordered a substantial meal. Then he took off his clothes and
  deposited them, even to his shirt, socks and necktie, in a trunk, wherein his
  summer clothing was stored with a plentiful sprinkling of naphthol to
  preserve it from the moth. Taking the packet of permanganate of potash from
  his dressing-bag, he passed into the adjoining bathroom, and, tipping the
  crystals into the bath, turned on the water. Soon the bath was filled with a
  pink solution of the salt, and into this he plunged, immersing his entire
  body and thoroughly soaking his hair. Then he emptied the bath and rinsed
  himself in clear water, and, having dried himself, returned to the bedroom
  and dressed himself in fresh clothing. Finally he took a hearty meal, and
  then lay down on the sofa to rest until it should be time to start for the
  rendezvous.</p>

  <p>Half-past six found him lurking in the shadow by the station-approach,
  within sight of the solitary lamp. He heard the train come in, saw the stream
  of passengers emerge, and noted one figure detach itself from the throng and
  turn on to the Thorpe road. It was Pratt, as the lamplight showed him; Pratt,
  striding forward to the meeting-place with an air of jaunty satisfaction and
  an uncommonly creaky pair of boots.</p>

  <p>Pembury followed him at a safe distance, and rather by sound than sight,
  until he was well past the stile at the entrance to the footpath. Evidently
  he was going on to the gates. Then Pembury vaulted over the stile and strode
  away swiftly across the dark meadows.</p>

  <p>When he plunged into the deep gloom of the avenue, his first act was to
  grope his way to the hornbeam and slip his hand up onto the crown and satisfy
  himself that the tongs were as he had left them. Reassured by the touch of
  his fingers on the iron loops, he turned and walked slowly down the avenue.
  The duplicate knife&mdash;ready opened&mdash;was in his left inside
  breast-pocket, and he fingered its handle as he walked.</p>

  <p>Presently the iron gate squeaked mournfully, and then the rhythmical creak
  of a pair of boots was audible, coming up the avenue. Pembury walked forward
  slowly until a darker smear emerged from the surrounding gloom, when he
  called out&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Pratt?"</p>

  <p>"That's me," was the cheerful, if ungrammatical response, and, as he drew
  nearer, the ex-warder asked: "Have you brought the rhino, old man?"</p>

  <p>The insolent familiarity of the man's tone was agreeable to Pembury: it
  strengthened his nerve and hardened his heart. "Of course," he replied; "but
  we must have a definite understanding, you know."</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Pratt, "I've got no time for jaw. The General will be
  here presently; he's riding over from Bingfield with a friend. You hand over
  the dibs and we'll talk some other time."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," said Pembury, "but you must understand&mdash;?"
  He paused abruptly and stood still. They were now close to the hornbeam, and,
  as he stood, he stared up into the dark mass of foliage.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" demanded Pratt. "What are you staring at?" He, too,
  had halted and stood gazing intently into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Then, in an instant, Pembury whipped out the knife and drove it, with all
  his strength, into the broad back of the ex-warder, below the left
  shoulder-blade.</p>

  <p>With a hideous yell Pratt turned and grappled with his assailant. A
  powerful man and a competent wrestler, too, he was far more than a match for
  Pembury unarmed, and, in a moment, he had him by the throat. But Pembury
  clung to him tightly, and, as they trampled to and fro and round and round,
  he stabbed again and again with the viciousness of a scorpion, while Pratt's
  cries grew more gurgling and husky. Then they fell heavily to the ground,
  Pembury underneath. But the struggle was over. With a last bubbling groan,
  Pratt relaxed his hold and in a moment grew limp and inert. Pembury pushed
  him off and rose, trembling and breathing heavily.</p>

  <p>But he wasted no time. There had been more noise than he had bargained
  for. Quickly stepping up to the hornbeam, he reached up for the tongs. His
  fingers slid into the looped handles; the tongs grasped the knife, and he
  lifted it out from its hiding-place and carried it to where the corpse lay,
  depositing it on the ground a few feet from the body. Then he went back to
  the tree and carefully pushed the tongs over into the hollow of the
  crown.</p>

  <p>At this moment a woman's voice sounded shrilly from the top of the
  avenue.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Mr. Pratt?" it called.</p>

  <p>Pembury started and then stepped back quickly, on tiptoe, to the body. For
  there was the duplicate knife. He must take that away at all costs.</p>

  <p>The corpse was lying on its back. The knife was underneath it, driven in
  to the very haft. He had to use both hands to lift the body, and even then he
  had some difficulty in disengaging the weapon. And, meanwhile, the voice,
  repeating its question, drew nearer.</p>

  <p>At length he succeeded in drawing out the knife and thrust it into his
  breast-pocket. The corpse fell back, and he stood up gasping.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pratt! Are you there?" The nearness of the voice startled Pembury,
  and, turning sharply, he saw a light twinkling between the trees. And then
  the gates creaked loudly and he heard the crunch of a horse's hoofs on the
  gravel.</p>

  <p>He stood for an instant bewildered&mdash;utterly taken by surprise. He had
  not reckoned on a horse. His intended flight across the meadows towards
  Thorpe was now impracticable. If he were overtaken he was lost, for he knew
  there was blood on his clothes and his hands were wet and slippery&mdash;to
  say nothing of the knife in his pocket.</p>

  <p>But his confusion lasted only for an instant. He remembered the oak tree;
  and, turning out of the avenue, he ran to it, and, touching it as little as
  he could with his bloody hands, climbed quickly up into the crown. The great
  horizontal limb was nearly three feet in diameter, and, as he lay out on it,
  gathering his coat closely round him, he was quite invisible from below.</p>

  <p>He had hardly settled himself when the light which he had seen came into
  full view, revealing a woman advancing with a stable lantern in her hand.
  And, almost at the same moment, a streak of brighter light burst from the
  opposite direction. The horseman was accompanied by a man on a bicycle.</p>

  <p>The two men came on apace, and the horseman, sighting the woman, called
  out: "Anything the matter, Mrs. Parton?" But, at that moment, the light of
  the bicycle lamp fell full on the prostrate corpse. The two men uttered a
  simultaneous cry of horror; the woman shrieked aloud: and then the horseman
  sprang from the saddle and ran forward to the body.</p>

  <p>"Why," he exclaimed, stooping over it, "it's Pratt;" and, as the cyclist
  came up and the glare of his lamp shone on a great pool of blood, he added:
  "There's been foul play here, Hanford."</p>

  <p>Hanford flashed his lamp around the body, lighting up the ground for
  several yards.</p>

  <p>"What is that behind you, O'Gorman?" he said suddenly; "isn't it a knife?"
  He was moving quickly towards it when O'Gorman held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch it!" he exclaimed. "We'll put the hounds onto it. They'll
  soon track the scoundrel, whoever he is. By God! Hanford, this fellow has
  fairly delivered himself into our hands." He stood for a few moments looking
  down at the knife with something uncommonly like exultation, and then,
  turning quickly to his friend, said: "Look here, Hanford; you ride off to the
  police station as hard as you can pelt. It is only three-quarters of a mile;
  you'll do it in five minutes. Send or bring an officer and I'll scour the
  meadows meanwhile. If I haven't got the scoundrel when you come back, we'll
  put the hounds onto this knife and run the beggar down."</p>

  <p>"Right," replied Hanford, and without another word he wheeled his machine
  about, mounted and rode away into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Parton," said O'Gorman, "watch that knife. See that nobody touches
  it while I go and examine the meadows."</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Pratt dead, sir?" whimpered Mrs. Parton.</p>

  <p>"Gad! I hadn't thought of that," said the general. "You'd better have a
  look at him; but mind! nobody is to touch that knife or they will confuse the
  scent."</p>

  <p>He scrambled into the saddle and galloped away across the meadows in the
  direction of Thorpe; and, as Pembury listened to the diminuendo of the
  horse's hoofs, he was glad that he had not attempted to escape; for that was
  the direction in which he had meant to go, and he would surely have been
  overtaken.</p>

  <p>As soon as the general was gone, Mrs. Parton, with many a terror-stricken
  glance over her shoulder, approached the corpse and held the lantern close to
  the dead face. Suddenly she stood up, trembling violently, for footsteps were
  audible coming down the avenue. A familiar voice reassured her.</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong, Mrs. Parton?" The question proceeded from one of the
  maids who had come in search of the elder woman, escorted by a young man, and
  the pair now came out into the circle of light.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" ejaculated the man. "Who's that?"</p>

  <p>"It's Mr. Pratt," replied Mrs. Parton. "He's been murdered."</p>

  <p>The girl screamed, and then the two domestics approached on tiptoe,
  staring at the corpse with the fascination of horror.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch that knife," said Mrs. Parton, for the man was about to pick
  it up. "The general's going to put the bloodhounds onto it."</p>

  <p>"Is the general here, then?" asked the man; and, as he spoke, the drumming
  of hoofs, growing momentarily louder, answered him from the meadow.</p>

  <p>O'Gorman reined in his horse as he perceived the group of servants
  gathered about the corpse. "Is he dead, Mrs. Parton?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid so, sir," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Somebody ought to go for the doctor; but not you, Bailey. I want you
  to get the hounds ready and wait with them at the top of the avenue until I
  call you."</p>

  <p>He was off again into the Baysford meadows, and Bailey hurried away,
  leaving the two women staring at the body and talking in whispers.</p>

  <p>Pembury's position was cramped and uncomfortable. He dared not move,
  hardly dared to breathe, for the women below him were not a dozen yards away;
  and it was with mingled feelings of relief and apprehension that he presently
  saw from his elevated station a group of lights approaching rapidly along the
  road from Baysford. Presently they were hidden by the trees, and then, after
  a brief interval, the whirr of wheels sounded on the drive and streaks of
  light on the tree-trunks announced the new arrivals. There were three
  bicycles, ridden respectively by Mr. Hanford, a police inspector and a
  sergeant; and, as they drew up, the general came thundering back into the
  avenue.</p>

  <p>"Is Ellis with you?" he asked, as he pulled up.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," was the reply. "He hadn't come in from Thorpe when we left.
  He's rather late to-night."</p>

  <p>"Have you sent for a doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I've sent for Dr. Hills," said the inspector, resting his
  bicycle against the oak. Pembury could smell the reek of the lamp as he
  crouched. "Is Pratt dead?"</p>

  <p>"Seems to be," replied O'Gorman, "but we'd better leave that to the
  doctor. There's the murderer's knife. Nobody has touched it. I'm going to
  fetch the bloodhounds now."</p>

  <p>"Ah! that's the thing," said the inspector. "The man can't be far away."
  He rubbed his hands with a satisfied air as O'Gorman cantered away up the
  avenue.</p>

  <p>In less than a minute there came out from the darkness the deep baying of
  a hound followed by quick footsteps on the gravel. Then into the circle of
  light emerged three sinister shapes, loose-limbed and gaunt, and two men
  advancing at a shambling trot.</p>

  <p>"Here, inspector," shouted the general, "you take one; I can't hold 'em
  both."</p>

  <p>The inspector ran forward and seized one of the leashes, and the general
  led his hound up to the knife, as it lay on the ground. Pembury, peering
  cautiously round the bough, watched the great brute with almost impersonal
  curiosity; noted its high poll, its wrinkled forehead and melancholy face as
  it stooped to snuff suspiciously at the prostrate knife.</p>

  <p>For some moments the hound stood motionless, sniffing at the knife; then
  it turned away and walked to and fro with its muzzle to the ground. Suddenly
  it lifted its head, bayed loudly, lowered its muzzle and started forward
  between the oak and the elm, dragging the general after it at a run.</p>

  <p>The inspector next brought his hound to the knife, and was soon bounding
  away to the tug of the leash in the general's wake.</p>

  <p>"They don't make no mistakes, they don't," said Bailey, addressing the
  gratified sergeant, as he brought forward the third hound; "you'll
  see&mdash;?" But his remark was cut short by a violent jerk of the leash, and
  the next moment he was flying after the others, followed by Mr. Hanford.</p>

  <p>The sergeant daintily picked the knife up by its ring, wrapped it in his
  handkerchief and bestowed it in his pocket. Then he ran off after the
  hounds.</p>

  <p>Pembury smiled grimly. His scheme was working out admirably in spite of
  the unforeseen difficulties. If those confounded women would only go away, he
  could come down and take himself off while the course was clear. He listened
  to the baying of the hounds, gradually growing fainter in the increasing
  distance, and cursed the dilatoriness of the doctor. Confound the fellow!
  Didn't he realize that this was a case of life or death?</p>

  <p>Suddenly his ear caught the tinkle of a bicycle bell; a fresh light
  appeared coming up the avenue and then a bicycle swept up swiftly to the
  scene of the tragedy, and a small elderly man jumped down by the side of the
  body. Giving his machine to Mrs. Parton, he stooped over the dead man, felt
  the wrist, pushed back an eyelid, held a match to the eye and then rose.
  "This is a shocking affair, Mrs. Parton," said he. "The poor fellow is quite
  dead. You had better help me to carry him to the house. If you two take the
  feet I will take the shoulders."</p>

  <p>Pembury watched them raise the body and stagger away with it up the
  avenue. He heard their shuffling steps die away and the door of the house
  shut. And still he listened. From far away in the meadows came, at intervals,
  the baying of the hounds. Other sounds there was none. Presently the doctor
  would come back for his bicycle, but, for the moment, the coast was clear.
  Pembury rose stiffly. His hands had stuck to the tree where they had pressed
  against it, and they were still sticky and damp. Quickly he let himself down
  to the ground, listened again for a moment, and then, making a small circuit
  to avoid the lamplight, softly crossed the avenue and stole away across the
  Thorpe meadows.</p>

  <p>The night was intensely dark, and not a soul was stirring in the meadows.
  He strode forward quickly, peering into the darkness and stopping now and
  again to listen; but no sound came to his ears, save the now faint baying of
  the distant hounds. Not far from his house, he remembered, was a deep ditch
  spanned by a wooden bridge, and towards this he now made his way; for he knew
  that his appearance was such as to convict him at a glance. Arrived at the
  ditch, he stooped to wash his hands and wrists; and, as he bent forward, the
  knife fell from his breast-pocket into the shallow water at the margin. He
  groped for it, and, having found it, drove it deep into the mud as far out as
  he could reach. Then he wiped his hands on some water-weed, crossed the
  bridge and started homewards.</p>

  <p>He approached his house from the rear, satisfied himself that his
  housekeeper was in the kitchen, and, letting himself in very quietly with his
  key, went quickly up to his bedroom. Here he washed thoroughly&mdash;in the
  bath, so that he could get rid of the discoloured water&mdash;changed his
  clothes and packed those that he took off in a portmanteau.</p>

  <p>By the time he had done this the gong sounded for supper. As he took his
  seat at the table, spruce and fresh in appearance, quietly cheerful in
  manner, he addressed his housekeeper. "I wasn't able to finish my business in
  London," he said. "I shall have to go up again to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Shall you come home the same day?" asked the housekeeper.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," was the reply, "and perhaps not. It will depend on
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>He did not say what the circumstances might be, nor did the housekeeper
  ask. Mr. Pembury was not addicted to confidences. He was an eminently
  discreet man: and discreet men say little.</p>

  <h3>PART II. &mdash; RIVAL SLEUTH-HOUNDS</h3>

  <h4>(RELATED BY CHRISTOPHER JERVIS, M.D.)</h4>

  <p class="first">THE half-hour that follows breakfast, when the fire has, so
  to speak, got into its stride, and the morning pipe throws up its clouds of
  incense, is, perhaps, the most agreeable in the whole day. Especially so when
  a sombre sky, brooding over the town, hints at streets pervaded by the chilly
  morning air, and hoots from protesting tugs upon the river tell of lingering
  mists, the legacy of the lately-vanished night.</p>

  <p>The autumn morning was raw: the fire burned jovially. I thrust my
  slippered feet towards the blaze and meditated, on nothing in particular,
  with cat-like enjoyment. Presently a disapproving grunt from Thorndyke
  attracted my attention, and I looked round lazily. He was extracting, with a
  pair of office shears, the readable portions of the morning paper, and had
  paused with a small cutting between his finger and thumb. "Bloodhounds
  again," said he. "We shall be hearing presently of the revival of the ordeal
  by fire."</p>

  <p>"And a deuced comfortable ordeal, too, on a morning like this," I said,
  stroking my legs ecstatically. "What is the case?"</p>

  <p>He was about to reply when a sharp rat-tat from the little brass knocker
  announced a disturber of our peace. Thorndyke stepped over to the door and
  admitted a police inspector in uniform, and I stood up, and, presenting my
  dorsal aspect to the fire, prepared to combine bodily comfort with attention
  to business.</p>

  <p>"I believe I am speaking to Dr. Thorndyke," said the officer, and, as
  Thorndyke nodded, he went on: "My name, sir, is Fox, Inspector Fox of the
  Baysford Police. Perhaps you've seen the morning paper?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke held up the cutting, and, placing a chair by the fire, asked the
  inspector if he had breakfasted.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir, I have," replied Inspector Fox. "I came up to town by the
  late train last night so as to be here early, and stayed at an hotel. You
  see, from the paper, that we have had to arrest one of our own men. That's
  rather awkward, you know, sir."</p>

  <p>"Very," agreed Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it's bad for the force and bad for the public too. But we had to do
  it. There was no way out that we could see. Still, we should like the accused
  to have every chance, both for our sake and his own, so the chief constable
  thought he'd like to have your opinion on the case, and he thought that,
  perhaps, you might be willing to act for the defence."</p>

  <p>"Let us have the particulars," said Thorndyke, taking a writing-pad from a
  drawer and dropping into his armchair. "Begin at the beginning," he added,
  "and tell us all you know."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the inspector, after a preliminary cough, "to begin with the
  murdered man: his name is Pratt. He was a retired prison warder, and was
  employed as steward by General O'Gorman, who is a retired prison
  governor&mdash;you may have heard of him in connection with his pack of
  bloodhounds. Well, Pratt came down from London yesterday evening by a train
  arriving at Baysford at six-thirty. He was seen by the guard, the ticket
  collector and the outside porter. The porter saw him leave the station at
  six-thirty-seven. General O'Gorman's house is about half-a-mile from the
  station. At five minutes to seven the general and a gentleman named Hanford
  and the general's housekeeper, a Mrs. Parton, found Pratt lying dead in the
  avenue that leads up to the house. He had apparently been stabbed, for there
  was a lot of blood about, and a knife&mdash;a Norwegian knife&mdash;was lying
  on the ground near the body. Mrs. Parton had thought she heard someone in the
  avenue calling out for help, and, as Pratt was just due, she came out with a
  lantern. She met the general and Mr. Hanford, and all three seem to have
  caught sight of the body at the same moment. Mr. Hanford cycled down to us,
  at once, with the news; we sent for a doctor, and I went back with Mr.
  Hanford and took a sergeant with me. We arrived at twelve minutes past seven,
  and then the general, who had galloped his horse over the meadows each side
  of the avenue without having seen anybody, fetched out his bloodhounds and
  led them up to the knife. All three hounds took up the scent at once&mdash;I
  held the leash of one of them&mdash;and they took us across the meadows
  without a pause or a falter, over stiles and fences, along a lane, out into
  the town, and then, one after the other, they crossed the road in a bee-line
  to the police station, bolted in at the door, which stood open, and made
  straight for the desk, where a supernumerary officer, named Ellis, was
  writing. They made a rare to-do, struggling to get at him, and it was as much
  as we could manage to hold them back. As for Ellis, he turned as pale as a
  ghost."</p>

  <p>"Was any one else in the room?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. There were two constables and a messenger. We led the hounds up
  to them, but the brutes wouldn't take any notice of them. They wanted
  Ellis."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Why, we arrested Ellis, of course. Couldn't do anything
  else&mdash;especially with the general there."</p>

  <p>"What had the general to do with it?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"He's a J.P. and a late governor of Dartmoor, and it was his hounds that
  had run the man down. But we must have arrested Ellis in any case."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything against the accused man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is. He and Pratt were on distinctly unfriendly terms. They
  were old comrades, for Ellis was in the Civil Guard at Portland when Pratt
  was warder there&mdash;he was pensioned off from the service because he got
  his left forefinger chopped off&mdash;but lately they had had some
  unpleasantness about a woman, a parlourmaid of the general's. It seems that
  Ellis, who is a married man, paid the girl too much attention&mdash;or Pratt
  thought he did&mdash;and Pratt warned Ellis off the premises. Since then they
  had not been on speaking terms."</p>

  <p>"And what sort of a man is Ellis?"</p>

  <p>"A remarkably decent fellow he always seemed; quiet, steady, good-natured;
  I should have said he wouldn't have hurt a fly. We all liked him&mdash;better
  than we liked Pratt, in fact; poor Pratt was what you'd call an old
  soldier&mdash;sly, you know, sir&mdash;and a bit of a sneak."</p>

  <p>"You searched and examined Ellis, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There was nothing suspicious about him except that he had two
  purses. But he says he picked up one of them? a small, pigskin pouch&mdash;on
  the footpath of the Thorpe road yesterday afternoon; and there's no reason to
  disbelieve him. At any rate, the purse was not Pratt's."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made a note on his pad, and then asked: "There were no
  blood-stains or marks on his clothing?"</p>

  <p>"No. His clothing was not marked or disarranged in any way."</p>

  <p>"Any cuts, scratches or bruises on his person?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," replied the inspector.</p>

  <p>"At what time did you arrest Ellis?"</p>

  <p>"Half-past seven exactly."</p>

  <p>"Have you ascertained what his movements were? Had he been near the scene
  of the murder?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he had been to Thorpe and would pass the gates of the avenue on his
  way back. And he was later than usual in returning, though not later than he
  has often been before."</p>

  <p>"And now, as to the murdered man: has the body been examined?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I had Dr. Hills's report before I left. There were no less than
  seven deep knife-wounds, all on the left side of the back. There was a great
  deal of blood on the ground, and Dr. Hills thinks Pratt must have bled to
  death in a minute or two."</p>

  <p>"Do the wounds correspond with the knife that was found?"</p>

  <p>"I asked the doctor that, and he said 'Yes,' though he wasn't going to
  swear to any particular knife. However, that point isn't of much importance.
  The knife was covered with blood, and it was found close to the body."</p>

  <p>"What has been done with it, by the way?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The sergeant who was with me picked it up and rolled it in his
  handkerchief to carry in his pocket. I took it from him, just as it was, and
  locked it in a dispatch-box."</p>

  <p>"Has the knife been recognized as Ellis's property?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, it has not."</p>

  <p>"Were there any recognizable footprints or marks of a struggle?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>The inspector grinned sheepishly. "I haven't examined the spot, of course,
  sir," said he, "but, after the general's horse and the bloodhounds and the
  general on foot and me and the gardener and the sergeant and Mr. Hanford had
  been over it twice, going and returning, why, you see, sir&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly, exactly," said Thorndyke. "Well, inspector, I shall be pleased
  to act for the defence; it seems to me that the case against Ellis is in some
  respects rather inconclusive."</p>

  <p>The inspector was frankly amazed. "It certainly hadn't struck me in that
  light, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"No? Well, that is my view; and I think the best plan will be for me to
  come down with you and investigate matters on the spot."</p>

  <p>The inspector assented cheerfully, and, when we had provided him with a
  newspaper, we withdrew to the laboratory to consult time-tables and prepare
  for the expedition.</p>

  <p>"You are coming, I suppose, Jervis?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"If I shall be of any use," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Of course you will," said he. "Two heads are better than one, and, by the
  look of things, I should say that ours will be the only ones with any sense
  in them. We will take the research case, of course, and we may as well have a
  camera with us. I see there is a train from Charing Cross in twenty
  minutes."</p>

  <p>For the first half-hour of the journey Thorndyke sat in his corner,
  alternately conning over his notes and gazing with thoughtful eyes out of the
  window. I could see that the case pleased him, and was careful not to break
  in upon his train of thought. Presently, however, he put away his notes and
  began to fill his pipe with a more companionable air, and then the inspector,
  who had been wriggling with impatience, opened fire.</p>

  <p>"So you think, sir, that you see a way out for Ellis?"</p>

  <p>"I think there is a case for the defence," replied Thorndyke. "In fact, I
  call the evidence against him rather flimsy."</p>

  <p>The inspector gasped. "But the knife, sir? What about the knife?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "what about the knife? Whose knife was it? You
  don't know. It was covered with blood. Whose blood? You don't know. Let us
  assume, for the sake of argument, that it was the murderer's knife. Then the
  blood on it was Pratt's blood. But if it was Pratt's blood, when the hounds
  had smelt it they should have led you to Pratt's body, for blood gives a very
  strong scent. But they did not. They ignored the body. The inference seems to
  be that the blood on the knife was not Pratt's blood."</p>

  <p>The inspector took off his cap and gently scratched the back of his head.
  "You're perfectly right, sir," he said. "I'd never thought of that. None of
  us had."</p>

  <p>"Then," pursued Thorndyke, "let us assume that the knife was Pratt's. If
  so, it would seem to have been used in self-defence. But this was a Norwegian
  knife, a clumsy tool&mdash;not a weapon at all&mdash;which takes an
  appreciable time to open and requires the use of two free hands. Now, had
  Pratt both hands free? Certainly not after the attack had commenced. There
  were seven wounds, all on the left side of the back; which indicates that he
  held the murderer locked in his arms and that the murderer's arms were around
  him. Also, incidentally, that the murderer is right-handed. But, still, let
  us assume that the knife was Pratt's. Then the blood on it was that of the
  murderer. Then the murderer must have been wounded. But Ellis was not
  wounded. Then Ellis is not the murderer. The knife doesn't help us at
  all."</p>

  <p>The inspector puffed out his cheeks and blew softly. "This is getting out
  of my depth," he said. "Still, sir, you can't get over the bloodhounds. They
  tell us distinctly that the knife is Ellis's knife and I don't see any answer
  to that."</p>

  <p>"There is no answer because there has been no statement. The bloodhounds
  have told you nothing. You have drawn certain inferences from their actions,
  but those inferences may be totally wrong and they are certainly not
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to have much opinion of bloodhounds," the inspector
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"As agents for the detection of crime," replied Thorndyke, "I regard them
  as useless. You cannot put a bloodhound in the witness-box. You can get no
  intelligible statement from it. If it possesses any knowledge, it has no
  means of communicating it. The fact is," he continued, "that the entire
  system of using bloodhounds for criminal detection is based on a fallacy. In
  the American plantations these animals were used with great success for
  tracking runaway slaves. But the slave was a known individual. All that was
  required was to ascertain his whereabouts. That is not the problem that is
  presented in the detection of a crime. The detective is not concerned in
  establishing the whereabouts of a known individual, but in discovering the
  identity of an unknown individual. And for this purpose bloodhounds are
  useless. They may discover such identity, but they cannot communicate their
  knowledge. If the criminal is unknown, they cannot identify him: if he is
  known, the police have no need of the bloodhound.</p>

  <p>"To return to our present case," Thorndyke resumed, after a pause; "we
  have employed certain agents&mdash;the hounds&mdash;with whom we are not en
  rapport, as the spiritualists would say; and we have no 'medium.' The hound
  possesses a special sense&mdash;the olfactory&mdash;which in man is quite
  rudimentary. He thinks, so to speak, in terms of smell, and his thoughts are
  untranslatable to beings in whom the sense of smell is undeveloped. We have
  presented to the hound a knife, and he discovers in it certain odorous
  properties; he discovers similar or related odorous properties in a tract of
  land and a human individual&mdash;Ellis. We cannot verify his discoveries or
  ascertain their nature. What remains? All that we can say is that there
  appears to exist some odorous relation between the knife and the man Ellis.
  But until we can ascertain the nature of that relation, we cannot estimate
  its evidential value or bearing. All the other 'evidence' is the product of
  your imagination and that of the general. There is, at present, no case
  against Ellis."</p>

  <p>"He must have been pretty close to the place when the murder happened,"
  said the inspector.</p>

  <p>"So, probably, were many other people," answered Thorndyke; "but had he
  time to wash and change? Because he would have needed it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he would," the inspector agreed dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly. There were seven wounds which would have taken some time to
  inflict. Now we can't suppose that Pratt stood passively while the other man
  stabbed him. Indeed, as I have said, the position of the wounds shows that he
  did not. There was a struggle. The two men were locked together. One of the
  murderer's hands was against Pratt's back; probably both hands were, one
  clasping and the other stabbing. There must have been blood on one hand and
  probably on both. But you say there was no blood on Ellis, and there doesn't
  seem to have been time or opportunity for him to wash."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a mysterious affair," said the inspector; "but I don't see how
  you are going to get over the bloodhounds."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shrugged his shoulders impatiently. "The bloodhounds are an
  obsession," he said. "The whole problem really centres around the knife. The
  questions are, Whose knife was it? and what was the connection between it and
  Ellis? There is a problem, Jervis," he continued, turning to me, "that I
  submit for your consideration. Some of the possible solutions are exceedingly
  curious."</p>

  <p>As we set out from Baysford station, Thorndyke looked at his watch and
  noted the time. "You will take us the way that Pratt went," he said.</p>

  <p>"As to that," said the inspector, "he may have gone by the road or by the
  footpath; but there's very little difference in the distance."</p>

  <p>Turning away from Baysford, we walked along the road westward, towards the
  village of Thorpe, and presently passed on our right a stile at the entrance
  to a footpath.</p>

  <p>"That path," said the inspector, "crosses the avenue about half-way up.
  But we'd better keep to the road." A quarter of a mile further on we came to
  a pair of rusty iron gates one of which stood open, and, entering, we found
  ourselves in a broad drive bordered by two rows of trees, between the trunks
  of which a long stretch of pasture meadows could be seen on either hand. It
  was a fine avenue, and, late in the year as it was, the yellowing foliage
  clustered thickly overhead.</p>

  <p>When we had walked about a hundred and fifty yards from the gates, the
  inspector halted.</p>

  <p>"This is the place," he said; and Thorndyke again noted the time.</p>

  <p>"Nine minutes exactly," said he. "Then Pratt arrived here about fourteen
  minutes to seven, and his body was found at five minutes to seven&mdash;nine
  minutes after his arrival. The murderer couldn't have been far away
  then."</p>

  <p>"No, it was a pretty fresh scent," replied the inspector. "You'd like to
  see the body first, I think you said, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and the knife, if you please."</p>

  <p>"I shall have to send down to the station for that. It's locked up in the
  office."</p>

  <p>He entered the house, and, having dispatched a messenger to the police
  station, came out and conducted us to the outbuilding where the corpse had
  been deposited. Thorndyke made a rapid examination of the wounds and the
  holes in the clothing, neither of which presented anything particularly
  suggestive. The weapon used had evidently been a thick-backed, single-edged
  knife similar to the one described, and the discolouration around the wounds
  indicated that the weapon had a definite shoulder like that of a Norwegian
  knife, and that it had been driven in with savage violence.</p>

  <p>"Do you find anything that throws any light on the case?" the inspector
  asked, when the examination was concluded.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible to say until we have seen the knife," replied
  Thorndyke; "but while we are waiting for it, we may as well go and look at
  the scene of the tragedy. These are Pratt's boots, I think?" He lifted a pair
  of stout laced boots from the table and turned them up to inspect the
  soles.</p>

  <p>"Yes, those are his boots," replied Fox, "and pretty easy they'd have been
  to track, if the case had been the other way about. Those Blakey's protectors
  are as good as a trademark."</p>

  <p>"We'll take them, at any rate," said Thorndyke; and, the inspector having
  taken the boots from him, we went out and retraced our steps down the
  avenue.</p>

  <p>The place where the murder had occurred was easily identified by a large
  dark stain on the gravel at one side of the drive, half-way between two
  trees&mdash;an ancient pollard hornbeam and an elm. Next to the elm was a
  pollard oak with a squat, warty bole about seven feet high, and three
  enormous limbs, of which one slanted half-way across the avenue; and between
  these two trees the ground was covered with the tracks of men and hounds
  superimposed upon the hoof-prints of a horse.</p>

  <p>"Where was the knife found?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>The inspector indicated a spot near the middle of the drive, almost
  opposite the hornbeam and Thorndyke, picking up a large stone, laid it on the
  spot. Then he surveyed the scene thoughtfully, looking up and down the drive
  and at the trees that bordered it, and, finally, walked slowly to the space
  between the elm and the oak, scanning the ground as he went. "There is no
  dearth of footprints," he remarked grimly, as he looked down at the trampled
  earth.</p>

  <p>"No, but the question is, whose are they?" said the inspector.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is the question," agreed Thorndyke; "and we will begin the
  solution by identifying those of Pratt."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how that will help us," said the inspector. "We know he was
  here."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at him in surprise, and I must confess that the foolish
  remark astonished me too, accustomed as I was to the quick-witted officers
  from Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"The hue and cry procession," remarked Thorndyke, "seems to have passed
  out between the elm and the oak; elsewhere the ground seems pretty clear." He
  walked round the elm, still looking earnestly at the ground, and presently
  continued: "Now here, in the soft earth bordering the turf, are the prints of
  a pair of smallish feet wearing pointed boots; a rather short man, evidently,
  by the size of foot and length of stride, and he doesn't seem to have
  belonged to the procession. But I don't see any of Pratt's; he doesn't seem
  to have come off the hard gravel." He continued to walk slowly towards the
  hornbeam with his eyes fixed on the ground. Suddenly he halted and stooped
  with an eager look at the earth; and, as Fox and I approached, he stood up
  and pointed. "Pratt's footprints&mdash;faint and fragmentary, but
  unmistakable. And now, inspector, you see their importance. They furnish the
  time factor in respect of the other footprints. Look at this one and then
  look at that." He pointed from one to another of the faint impressions of the
  dead man's foot.</p>

  <p>"You mean that there are signs of a struggle?" said Fox.</p>

  <p>"I mean more than that," replied Thorndyke. "Here is one of Pratt's
  footprints treading into the print of a small, pointed foot; and there at the
  edge of the gravel is another of Pratt's nearly obliterated by the tread of a
  pointed foot. Obviously the first pointed footprint was made before Pratt's,
  and the second one after his; and the necessary inference is that the owner
  of the pointed foot was here at the same time as Pratt."</p>

  <p>"Then he must have been the murderer!" exclaimed Fox.</p>

  <p>"Presumably," answered Thorndyke; "but let us see whither he went. You
  notice, in the first place, that the man stood close to this tree"&mdash;he
  indicated the hornbeam&mdash;"and that he went towards the elm. Let us follow
  him. He passes the elm, you see, and you will observe that these tracks form
  a regular series leading from the hornbeam and not mixed up with the marks of
  the struggle. They were, therefore, probably made after the murder had been
  perpetrated. You will also notice that they pass along the backs of the
  trees&mdash;outside the avenue, that is; what does that suggest to you?"</p>

  <p>"It suggests to me," I said, when the inspector had shaken his head
  hopelessly, "that there was possibly someone in the avenue when the man was
  stealing off."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Thorndyke. "The body was found not more than nine
  minutes after Pratt arrived here. But the murder must have taken some time.
  Then the housekeeper thought she heard someone calling and came out with a
  lantern, and, at the same time, the general and Mr. Hanford came up the
  drive. The suggestion is that the man sneaked along outside the trees to
  avoid being seen. However, let us follow the tracks. They pass the elm and
  they pass on behind the next tree; but wait! There is something odd here." He
  passed behind the great pollard oak and looked down at the soft earth by its
  roots. "Here is a pair of impressions much deeper than the rest, and they are
  not a part of the track since their toes point towards the tree. What do you
  make of that?" Without waiting for an answer he began closely to scan the
  bole of the tree and especially a large, warty protuberance about three feet
  from the ground. On the bark above this was a vertical mark, as if something
  had scraped down the tree, and from the wart itself a dead twig had been
  newly broken off and lay upon the ground. Pointing to these marks Thorndyke
  set his foot on the protuberance, and, springing up, brought his eye above
  the level of the crown, whence the great boughs branched off.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Here is something much more definite." With the aid
  of another projection, he scrambled up into the crown of the tree, and,
  having glanced quickly round, beckoned to us. I stepped up on the projecting
  lump and, as my eyes rose above the crown, I perceived the brown, shiny
  impression of a hand on the edge. Climbing into the crown, I was quickly
  followed by the inspector, and we both stood up by Thorndyke between the
  three boughs. From where we stood we looked on the upper side of the great
  limb that swept out across the avenue; and there on its lichen-covered
  surface, we saw the imprints in reddish-brown of a pair of open hands.</p>

  <p>"You notice," said Thorndyke, leaning out upon the bough, "that he is a
  short man; I cannot conveniently place my hands so low. You also note that he
  has both forefingers intact, and so is certainly not Ellis."</p>

  <p>"If you mean to say, sir, that these marks were made by the murderer,"
  said Fox, "I say it's impossible. Why, that would mean that he was here
  looking down at us when we were searching for him with the hounds. The
  presence of the hounds proves that this man could not have been the
  murderer."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said Thorndyke, "the presence of this man with bloody
  hands confirms the other evidence, which all indicates that the hounds were
  never on the murderer's trail at all. Come now, inspector, I put it to you:
  Here is a murdered man; the murderer has almost certainly blood upon his
  hands; and here is a man with bloody hands, lurking in a tree within a few
  feet of the corpse and within a few minutes of its discovery (as is shown by
  the footprints); what are the reasonable probabilities?"</p>

  <p>"But you are forgetting the bloodhounds, sir, and the murderer's knife,"
  urged the inspector.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut, man!" exclaimed Thorndyke; "those bloodhounds are a positive
  obsession. But I see a sergeant coming up the drive, with the knife, I hope.
  Perhaps that will solve the riddle for us."</p>

  <p>The sergeant, who carried a small dispatch-box, halted opposite the tree
  in some surprise while we descended, when he came forward with a military
  salute and handed the box to the inspector, who forthwith unlocked it, and,
  opening the lid, displayed an object wrapped in a pocket-handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"There is the knife, sir," said he, "just as I received it. The
  handkerchief is the sergeant's."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke unrolled the handkerchief and took from it a large-sized
  Norwegian knife, which he looked at critically and then handed to me. While I
  was inspecting the blade, he shook out the handkerchief and, having looked it
  over on both sides, turned to the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"At what time did you pick up this knife?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About seven-fifteen, sir; directly after the hounds had started. I was
  careful to pick it up by the ring, and I wrapped it in the handkerchief at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Seven-fifteen," said Thorndyke. "Less than half-an-hour after the murder.
  That is very singular. Do you observe the state of this handkerchief? There
  is not a mark on it. Not a trace of any bloodstain; which proves that when
  the knife was picked up, the blood on it was already dry. But things dry
  slowly, if they dry at all, in the saturated air of an autumn evening. The
  appearances seem to suggest that the blood on the knife was dry when it was
  thrown down. By the way, sergeant, what do you scent your handkerchief
  with?"</p>

  <p>"Scent, sir!" exclaimed the astonished officer in indignant accents; "me
  scent my handkerchief! No, sir, certainly not. Never used scent in my life,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke held out the handkerchief, and the sergeant sniffed at it
  incredulously. "It certainly does seem to smell of scent," he admitted, "but
  it must be the knife." The same idea having occurred to me, I applied the
  handle of the knife to my nose and instantly detected the sickly-sweet odour
  of musk.</p>

  <p>"The question is," said the inspector, when the two articles had been
  tested by us all, "was it the knife that scented the Handkerchief or the
  handkerchief that scented the knife?"</p>

  <p>"You heard what the sergeant said," replied Thorndyke. "There was no scent
  on the handkerchief when the knife was wrapped in it. Do you know, inspector,
  this scent seems to me to offer a very curious suggestion. Consider the facts
  of the case: the distinct trail leading straight to Ellis, who is,
  nevertheless, found to be without a scratch or a spot of blood; the
  inconsistencies in the case that I pointed out in the train, and now this
  knife, apparently dropped with dried blood on it and scented with musk. To me
  it suggests a carefully-planned, coolly-premeditated crime. The murderer knew
  about the general's bloodhounds and made use of them as a blind. He planted
  this knife, smeared with blood and tainted with musk, to furnish a scent. No
  doubt some object, also scented with musk, would be drawn over the ground to
  give the trail. It is only a suggestion, of course, but it is worth
  considering."</p>

  <p>"But, sir," the inspector objected eagerly, "if the murderer had handled
  the knife, it would have scented him too."</p>

  <p>"Exactly; so, as we are assuming that the man is not a fool, we may assume
  that he did not handle it. He will have left it here in readiness, hidden in
  some place whence he could knock it down, say, with a stick, without touching
  it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps in this very tree, sir," suggested the sergeant, pointing to the
  oak.</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke, "he would hardly have hidden in the tree where the
  knife had been. The hounds might have scented the place instead of following
  the trail at once. The most likely hiding-place for the knife is the one
  nearest the spot where it was found." He walked over to the stone that marked
  the spot, and looking round, continued: "You see, that hornbeam is much the
  nearest, and its flat crown would be very convenient for the
  purpose&mdash;easily reached even by a short man, as he appears to be. Let us
  see if there are any traces of it. Perhaps you will give me a 'back up',
  sergeant, as we haven't a ladder."</p>

  <p>The sergeant assented with a faint grin, and stooping beside the tree in
  an attitude suggesting the game of leapfrog, placed his hands firmly on his
  knees. Grasping a stout branch, Thorndyke swung himself up on the sergeant's
  broad back, whence he looked down into the crown of the tree. Then, parting
  the branches, he stepped onto the ledge and disappeared into the central
  hollow.</p>

  <p>When he re-appeared he held in his hands two very singular objects: a pair
  of iron crucible-tongs and an artist's brush-case of black-japanned tin. The
  former article he handed down to me, but the brush-case he held carefully by
  its wire handle as he dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"The significance of these things is, I think, obvious," he said. "The
  tongs were used to handle the knife with and the case to carry it in, so that
  it should not scent his clothes or bag. It was very carefully planned."</p>

  <p>"If that is so," said the inspector, "the inside of the case ought to
  smell of musk."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Thorndyke; "but before we open it, there is a rather
  important matter to be attended to. Will you give me the Vitogen powder,
  Jervis?"</p>

  <p>I opened the canvas-covered "research case" and took from it an object
  like a diminutive pepper-caster&mdash;an iodo-form dredger in fact&mdash;and
  handed it to him. Grasping the brush-case by its wire handle, he sprinkled
  the pale yellow powder from the dredger freely all round the pull-off lid,
  tapping the top with his knuckles to make the fine particles spread. Then he
  blew off the superfluous powder, and the two police officers gave a
  simultaneous gasp of joy; for now, on the black background, there stood out
  plainly a number of finger-prints, so clear and distinct that the
  ridge-pattern could be made out with perfect ease.</p>

  <p>"These will probably be his right hand," said Thorndyke. "Now for the
  left." He treated the body of the case in the same way, and, when he had
  blown off the powder, the entire surface was spotted with yellow, oval
  impressions. "Now, Jervis," said he, "if you will put on a glove and pull off
  the lid, we can test the inside."</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty in getting the lid off, for the shoulder of the
  case had been smeared with vaseline&mdash;apparently to produce an airtight
  joint&mdash;and, as it separated with a hollow sound, a faint, musky odour
  exhaled from its interior.</p>

  <p>"The remainder of the inquiry," said Thorndyke, when I pushed the lid on
  again, "will be best conducted at the police station, where, also, we can
  photograph these fingerprints."</p>

  <p>"The shortest way will be across the meadows," said Fox; "the way the
  hounds went."</p>

  <p>By this route we accordingly travelled, Thorndyke carrying the brush-case
  tenderly by its handle.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see where Ellis comes in in this job," said the inspector,
  as we walked along, "if the fellow had a grudge against Pratt. They weren't
  chums."</p>

  <p>"I think I do," said Thorndyke. "You say that both men were prison
  officers at Portland at the same time. Now doesn't it seem likely that this
  is the work of some old convict who had been identified&mdash;and perhaps
  blackmailed&mdash;by Pratt, and possibly by Ellis too? That is where the
  value of the finger-prints comes in. If he is an old 'lag' his prints will be
  at Scotland Yard. Otherwise they are not of much value as a clue."</p>

  <p>"That's true, sir," said the inspector. "I suppose you want to see
  Ellis."</p>

  <p>"I want to see that purse that you spoke of, first," replied Thorndyke.
  "That is probably the other end of the clue."</p>

  <p>As soon as we arrived at the station, the inspector unlocked a safe and
  brought out a parcel. "These are Ellis's things," said he, as he unfastened
  it, "and that is the purse."</p>

  <p>He handed Thorndyke a small pigskin pouch, which my colleague opened, and
  having smelt the inside, passed to me. The odour of musk was plainly
  perceptible, especially in the small compartment at the back.</p>

  <p>"It has probably tainted the other contents of the parcel," said
  Thorndyke, sniffing at each article in turn, "but my sense of smell is not
  keen enough to detect any scent. They all seem odourless to me, whereas the
  purse smells quite distinctly. Shall we have Ellis in now?"</p>

  <p>The sergeant took a key from a locked drawer and departed for the cells,
  whence he presently re-appeared accompanied by the prisoner&mdash;a stout,
  burly man, in the last stage of dejection.</p>

  <p>"Come, cheer up, Ellis," said the inspector. "Here's Dr. Thorndyke come
  down to help us and he wants to ask you one or two questions."</p>

  <p>Ellis looked piteously at Thorndyke, and exclaimed: "I know nothing
  whatever about this affair, sir, I swear to God I don't."</p>

  <p>"I never supposed you did," said Thorndyke. "But there are one or two
  things that I want you to tell me. To begin with, that purse: where did you
  find it?"</p>

  <p>"On the Thorpe road, sir. It was lying in the middle of the footway."</p>

  <p>"Had any one else passed the spot lately? Did you meet or pass any
  one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I met a labourer about a minute before I saw the purse. I can't
  imagine why he didn't see it."</p>

  <p>"Probably because it wasn't there," said Thorndyke. "Is there a hedge
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; a hedge on a low bank."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Well, now, tell me: is there any one about here whom you knew when
  you and Pratt were together at Portland? Any old lag&mdash;to put it
  bluntly&mdash;whom you and Pratt have been putting the screw on."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I swear there isn't. But I wouldn't answer for Pratt. He had a
  rare memory for faces."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected. "Were there any escapes from Portland in your time?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Only one&mdash;a man named Dobbs. He made off to the sea in a sudden fog
  and he was supposed to be drowned. His clothes washed up on the Bill, but not
  his body. At any rate, he was never heard of again."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Ellis. Do you mind my taking your fingerprints?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, sir," was the almost eager reply; and the office
  inking-pad being requisitioned, a rough set of finger-prints was produced;
  and when Thorndyke had compared them with those on the brush-case and found
  no resemblance, Ellis returned to his cell in quite buoyant spirits.</p>

  <p>Having made several photographs of the strange fingerprints, we returned
  to town that evening, taking the negatives with us; and while we waited for
  our train, Thorndyke gave a few parting injunctions to the inspector.
  "Remember," he said, "that the man must have washed his hands before he could
  appear in public. Search the banks of every pond, ditch and stream in the
  neighbourhood for footprints like those in the avenue; and, if you find any,
  search the bottom of the water thoroughly, for he is quite likely to have
  dropped the knife into the mud."</p>

  <p>The photographs, which we handed in at Scotland Yard that same night,
  enabled the experts to identify the fingerprints as those of Francis Dobbs,
  an escaped convict. The two photographs&mdash;profile and
  full-face&mdash;which were attached to his record, were sent down to Baysford
  with a description of the man, and were, in due course, identified with a
  somewhat mysterious individual, who passed by the name of Rufus Pembury and
  who had lived in the neighbourhood as a private gentleman for some two years.
  But Rufus Pembury was not to be found either at his genteel house or
  elsewhere. All that was known was, that on the day after the murder, he had
  converted his entire "personalty" into "bearer securities," and then vanished
  from mortal ken. Nor has he ever been heard of to this day.</p>

  <p>"And, between ourselves," said Thorndyke, when we were discussing the case
  some time after, "he deserved to escape. It was clearly a case of blackmail,
  and to kill a blackmailer&mdash;when you have no other defence against
  him&mdash;is hardly murder. As to Ellis, he could never have been convicted,
  and Dobbs, or Pembury, must have known it. But he would have been committed
  to the Assizes, and that would have given time for all traces to disappear.
  No, Dobbs was a man of courage, ingenuity and resource; and, above all, he
  knocked the bottom out of the great bloodhound superstition."</p>

  <h2><a name="c4"
     id="c4"></a>III. &mdash; THE ECHO OF A MUTINY</h2>

  <h3>PART I. &mdash; DEATH ON THE GIRDLER</h3>

  <p class="first">POPULAR belief ascribes to infants and the lower animals
  certain occult powers of divining character denied to the reasoning faculties
  of the human adult; and is apt to accept their judgment as finally overriding
  the pronouncements of mere experience.</p>

  <p>Whether this belief rests upon any foundation other than the universal
  love of paradox it is unnecessary to inquire. It is very generally
  entertained, especially by ladies of a certain social status; and by Mrs.
  Thomas Solly it was loyally maintained as an article of faith.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she moralized, "it's surprisin' how they know, the little children
  and the dumb animals. But they do. There's no deceivin' them. They can tell
  the gold from the dross in a moment, they can, and they reads the human heart
  like a book. Wonderful, I call it. I suppose it's instinct."</p>

  <p>Having delivered herself of this priceless gem of philosophic thought, she
  thrust her arms elbow-deep into the foaming wash-tub and glanced admiringly
  at her lodger as he sat in the doorway, supporting on one knee an obese
  infant of eighteen months and on the other a fine tabby cat.</p>

  <p>James Brown was an elderly seafaring man, small and slight in build and in
  manner suave, insinuating and perhaps a trifle sly. But he had all the
  sailor's love of children and animals, and the sailor's knack of making
  himself acceptable to them, for, as he sat with an empty pipe wobbling in the
  grasp of his toothless gums, the baby beamed with humid smiles, and the cat,
  rolled into a fluffy ball and purring like a stocking-loom, worked its
  fingers ecstatically as if it were trying on a new pair of gloves.</p>

  <p>"It must be mortal lonely out at the lighthouse," Mrs. Solly resumed.
  "Only three men and never a neighbour to speak to; and, Lord! what a muddle
  they must be in with no woman to look after them and keep 'em tidy. But you
  won't be overworked, Mr. Brown, in these long days; daylight till past nine
  o'clock. I don't know what you'll do to pass the time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall find plenty to do, I expect," said Brown, "what with cleanin'
  the lamps and glasses and paintin' up the ironwork. And that reminds me," he
  added, looking round at the clock, "that time's getting on. High water at
  half-past ten, and here it's gone eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Solly, acting on the hint, began rapidly to fish out the washed
  garments and wring them out into the form of short ropes. Then, having dried
  her hands on her apron, she relieved Brown of the protesting baby.</p>

  <p>"Your room will be ready for you, Mr. Brown," said she, "when your turn
  comes for a spell ashore; and main glad me and Tom will be to see you
  back."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Solly, ma'am," answered Brown, tenderly placing the cat
  on the floor; "you won't be more glad than what I will." He shook hands
  warmly with his landlady, kissed the baby, chucked the cat under the chin,
  and, picking up his little chest by its becket, swung it onto his shoulder
  and strode out of the cottage.</p>

  <p>His way lay across the marshes, and, like the ships in the offing, he
  shaped his course by the twin towers of Reculver that stood up grotesquely on
  the rim of the land; and as he trod the springy turf, Tom Solly's fleecy
  charges looked up at him with vacant stares and valedictory bleatings. Once,
  at a dyke-gate, he paused to look back at the fair Kentish landscape: at the
  grey tower of St. Nicholas-at-Wade peeping above the trees and the faraway
  mill at Sarre, whirling slowly in the summer breeze; and, above all, at the
  solitary cottage where, for a brief spell in his stormy life, he had known
  the homely joys of domesticity and peace. Well, that was over for the
  present, and the lighthouse loomed ahead. With a half-sigh he passed through
  the gate and walked on towards Reculver.</p>

  <p>Outside the whitewashed cottages with their official black chimneys a
  petty-officer of the coast-guard was adjusting the halyards of the flagstaff.
  He looked round as Brown approached, and hailed him cheerily.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, then," said he, "all figged out in your new togs, too. But
  we're in a bit of a difficulty, d'ye see. We've got to pull up to Whitstable
  this morning, so I can't send a man out with you and I can't spare a
  boat."</p>

  <p>"Have I got to swim out, then?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>The coast-guard grinned. "Not in them new clothes, mate," he answered.
  "No, but there's old Willett's boat; he isn't using her to-day; he's going
  over to Minster to see his daughter, and he'll let us have the loan of the
  boat. But there's no one to go with you, and I'm responsible to Willett."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about it?" asked Brown, with the deep-sea sailor's (usually
  misplaced) confidence in his power to handle a sailing-boat. "D'ye think I
  can't manage a tub of a boat? Me what's used the sea since I was a kid of
  ten?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coast-guard; "but who's to bring her back?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the man that I'm going to relieve," answered Brown. "He don't want
  to swim no more than what I do."</p>

  <p>The coast-guard reflected with his telescope pointed at a passing barge.
  "Well, I suppose it'll be all right," he concluded; "but it's a pity they
  couldn't send the tender round. However, if you undertake to send the boat
  back, we'll get her afloat. It's time you were off."</p>

  <p>He strolled away to the back of the cottages, whence he presently returned
  with two of his mates, and the four men proceeded along the shore to where
  Willett's boat lay just above high-water mark.</p>

  <p>The Emily was a beamy craft of the type locally known as a "half-share
  skiff," solidly built of oak, with varnished planking and fitted with main
  and mizzen lugs. She was a good handful for four men, and, as she slid over
  the soft chalk rocks with a hollow rumble, the coast-guards debated the
  advisability of lifting out the bags of shingle with which she was ballasted.
  However, she was at length dragged down, ballast and all, to the water's
  edge, and then, while Brown stepped the mainmast, the petty-officer gave him
  his directions. "What you've got to do," said he, "is to make use of the
  flood-tide. Keep her nose nor'-east, and with this trickle of nor'-westerly
  breeze you ought to make the light-house in one board. Anyhow don't let her
  get east of the lighthouse, or, when the ebb sets in, you'll be in a
  fix."</p>

  <p>To these admonitions Brown listened with jaunty indifference as he hoisted
  the sails and watched the incoming tide creep over the level shore. Then the
  boat lifted on the gentle swell. Putting out an oar, he gave a vigorous shove
  off that sent the boat, with a final scrape, clear of the beach, and then,
  having dropped the rudder onto its pintles, he seated himself and calmly
  belayed the main-sheet.</p>

  <p>"There he goes," growled the coast-guard; "makin' fast his sheet. They
  will do it" (he invariably did it himself), "and that's how accidents happen.
  I hope old Willett'll see his boat back all right."</p>

  <p>He stood for some time watching the dwindling boat as it sidled across the
  smooth water; then he turned and followed his mates towards the station.</p>

  <p>Out on the south-western edge of the Girdler Sand, just inside the
  two-fathom line, the spindle-shanked lighthouse stood a-straddle on its long
  screw-piles like some uncouth red-bodied wading bird. It was now nearly half
  flood tide. The highest shoals were long since covered, and the lighthouse
  rose above the smooth sea as solitary as a slaver becalmed in the "middle
  passage."</p>

  <p>On the gallery outside the lantern were two men, the entire staff of the
  building, of whom one sat huddled in a chair with his left leg propped up
  with pillows on another, while his companion rested a telescope on the rail
  and peered at the faint grey line of the distant land and the two tiny points
  that marked the twin spires of Reculver.</p>

  <p>"I don't see any signs of the boat, Harry," said he.</p>

  <p>The other man groaned. "I shall lose the tide," he complained, "and then
  there's another day gone."</p>

  <p>"They can pull you down to Birchington and put you in the train," said the
  first man.</p>

  <p>"I don't want no trains," growled the invalid. "The boat'll be bad enough.
  I suppose there's nothing coming our way, Tom?"</p>

  <p>Tom turned his face eastward and shaded his eyes. "There's a brig coming
  across the tide from the north," he said. "Looks like a collier." He pointed
  his telescope at the approaching vessel, and added: "She's got two new cloths
  in her upper fore top-sail, one on each leech."</p>

  <p>The other man sat up eagerly. "What's her trysail like, Tom?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Can't see it," replied Tom. "Yes, I can, now: it's tanned. Why, that'll
  be the old Utopia, Harry; she's the only brig I know that's got a tanned
  trysail."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Tom," exclaimed the other, "If that's the Utopia, she's going
  to my home and I'm going aboard of her. Captain Mockett'll give me a passage,
  I know."</p>

  <p>"You oughtn't to go until you're relieved, you know, Barnett," said Tom
  doubtfully; "it's against regulations to leave your station."</p>

  <p>"Regulations be blowed!" exclaimed Barnett. "My leg's more to me than the
  regulations. I don't want to be a cripple all my life. Besides, I'm no good
  here, and this new chap, Brown, will be coming out presently. You run up the
  signal, Tom, like a good comrade, and hail the brig."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's your look-out," said Tom, "and I don't mind saying that if I
  was in your place I should cut off home and see a doctor, if I got the
  chance." He sauntered off to the flag-locker, and, selecting the two
  code-flags, deliberately toggled them onto the halyards. Then, as the brig
  swept up within range, he hoisted the little balls of bunting to the
  flagstaff-head and jerked the halyards, when the two flags blew out making
  the signal "Need assistance."</p>

  <p>Promptly a coal-soiled answering pennant soared to the brig's main-truck;
  less promptly the collier went about, and, turning her nose down stream,
  slowly drifted stern-forwards towards the lighthouse. Then a boat slid out
  through her gangway, and a couple of men plied the oars vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Lighthouse ahoy!" roared one of them, as the boat came within hail.
  "What's amiss?"</p>

  <p>"Harry Barnett has broke his leg," shouted the lighthouse keeper, "and he
  wants to know if Captain Mockett will give him a passage to Whitstable."</p>

  <p>The boat turned back to the brig, and after a brief and bellowed
  consultation, once more pulled towards the lighthouse.</p>

  <p>"Skipper says yus," roared the sailor, when he was within ear-shot, "and
  he says look alive, 'cause he don't want to miss his tide."</p>

  <p>The injured man heaved a sigh of relief. "That's good news," said he,
  "though, how the blazes I'm going to get down the ladder is more than I can
  tell. What do you say, Jeffreys?"</p>

  <p>"I say you'd better let me lower you with the tackle," replied Jeffreys.
  "You can sit in the bight of a rope and I'll give you a line to steady
  yourself with."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that'll do, Tom," said Barnett; "but, for the Lord's sake, pay out
  the fall-rope gently."</p>

  <p>The arrangements were made so quickly that by the time the boat was fast
  alongside everything was in readiness, and a minute later the injured man,
  dangling like a gigantic spider from the end of the tackle, slowly descended,
  cursing volubly to the accompaniment of the creaking of the blocks. His chest
  and kit-bag followed, and, as soon as these were unhooked from the tackle,
  the boat pulled off to the brig, which was now slowly creeping stern-foremost
  past the lighthouse. The sick man was hoisted up the side, his chest handed
  up after him, and then the brig was put on her course due south across the
  Kentish Flats.</p>

  <p>Jeffreys stood on the gallery watching the receding vessel and listening
  to the voices of her crew as they grew small and weak in the increasing
  distance. Now that his gruff companion was gone, a strange loneliness had
  fallen on the lighthouse. The last of the homeward-bound ships had long since
  passed up the Princes Channel and left the calm sea desolate and blank. The
  distant buoys, showing as tiny black dots on the glassy surface, and the
  spindly shapes of the beacons which stood up from invisible shoals, but
  emphasized the solitude of the empty sea, and the tolling of the bell buoy on
  the Shivering Sand, stealing faintly down the wind, sounded weird and
  mournful. The day's work was already done. The lenses were polished, the
  lamps had been trimmed, and the little motor that worked the foghorn had been
  cleaned and oiled. There were several odd jobs, it is true, waiting to be
  done, as there always are in a lighthouse; but, just now, Jeffreys was not in
  a working humour. A new comrade was coming into his life to-day, a stranger
  with whom he was to be shut up alone, night and day, for a month on end, and
  whose temper and tastes and habits might mean for him pleasant companionship
  or jangling and discord without end. Who was this man Brown? What had he
  been? and what was he like? These were the questions that passed, naturally
  enough, through the lighthouse keeper's mind and distracted him from his
  usual thoughts and occupations.</p>

  <p>Presently a speck on the landward horizon caught his eye. He snatched up
  the telescope eagerly to inspect it. Yes, it was a boat; but not the
  coast-guard's cutter, for which he was looking. Evidently a fisherman's boat
  and with only one man in it. He laid down the telescope with a sigh of
  disappointment, and, filling his pipe, leaned on the rail with a dreamy eye
  bent on the faint grey line of the land.</p>

  <p>Three long years had he spent in this dreary solitude, so repugnant to his
  active, restless nature: three blank, interminable years, with nothing to
  look back on but the endless succession of summer calms, stormy nights and
  the chilly fogs of winter, when the unseen steamers hooted from the void and
  the fog-horn bellowed its hoarse warning.</p>

  <p>Why had he come to this God-forsaken spot? and why did he stay, when the
  wide world called to him? And then memory painted him a picture on which his
  mind's eye had often looked before and which once again arose before him,
  shutting out the vision of the calm sea and the distant land. It was a
  brightly-coloured picture. It showed a cloudless sky brooding over the deep
  blue tropic sea: and in the middle of the picture, see-sawing gently on the
  quiet swell, a white-painted barque.</p>

  <p>Her sails were clewed up untidily, her swinging yards jerked at the slack
  braces and her untended wheel revolved to and fro to the oscillations of the
  rudder.</p>

  <p>She was not a derelict, for more than a dozen men were on her deck; but
  the men were all drunk and mostly asleep, and there was never an officer
  among them.</p>

  <p>Then he saw the interior of one of her cabins. The chart-rack, the
  tell-tale compass and the chronometers marked it as the captain's cabin. In
  it were four men, and two of them lay dead on the deck. Of the other two, one
  was a small, cunning-faced man, who was, at the moment, kneeling beside one
  of the corpses to wipe a knife upon its coat. The fourth man was himself.</p>

  <p>Again, he saw the two murderers stealing off in a quarter-boat, as the
  barque with her drunken crew drifted towards the spouting surf of a
  river-bar. He saw the ship melt away in the surf like an icicle in the
  sunshine; and, later, two shipwrecked mariners, picked up in an open boat and
  set ashore at an American port.</p>

  <p>That was why he was here. Because he was a murderer. The other scoundrel,
  Amos Todd, had turned Queen's Evidence and denounced him, and he had barely
  managed to escape. Since then he had hidden himself from the great world, and
  here he must continue to hide, not from the law&mdash;for his person was
  unknown now that his shipmates were dead&mdash;but from the partner of his
  crime. It was the fear of Todd that had changed him from Jeffrey Rorke to Tom
  Jeffreys and had sent him to the Girdler, a prisoner for life. Todd might
  die&mdash;might even now be dead&mdash;but he would never hear of it: would
  never hear the news of his release.</p>

  <p>He roused himself and once more pointed his telescope at the distant boat.
  She was considerably nearer now and seemed to be heading out towards the
  lighthouse. Perhaps the man in her was bringing a message; at any rate, there
  was no sign of the coast-guard's cutter.</p>

  <p>He went in, and, betaking himself to the kitchen, busied himself with a
  few simple preparations for dinner. But there was nothing to cook, for there
  remained the cold meat from yesterday's cooking, which he would make
  sufficient, with some biscuit in place of potatoes. He felt restless and
  unstrung; the solitude irked him, and the everlasting wash of the water among
  the piles jarred on his nerves.</p>

  <p>When he went out again into the gallery the ebb-tide had set in strongly
  and the boat was little more than a mile distant; and now, through the glass,
  he could see that the man in her wore the uniform cap of the Trinity House.
  Then the man must be his future comrade, Brown; but this was very
  extraordinary. What were they to do with the boat? There was no one to take
  her back.</p>

  <p>The breeze was dying away. As he watched the boat, he saw the man lower
  the sail and take to his oars; and something of hurry in the way the man
  pulled over the gathering tide, caused Jeffreys to look round the horizon.
  And then, for the first time, he noticed a bank of fog creeping up from the
  east and already so near that the beacon on the East Girdler had faded out of
  sight. He hastened in to start the little motor that compressed the air for
  the fog-horn and waited awhile to see that the mechanism was running
  properly. Then, as the deck vibrated to the roar of the horn, he went out
  once more into the gallery.</p>

  <p>The fog was now all round the lighthouse and the boat was hidden from
  view. He listened intently. The enclosing wall of vapour seemed to have shut
  out sound as well as vision. At intervals the horn bellowed its note of
  warning, and then all was still save the murmur of the water among the piles
  below, and, infinitely faint and far away, the mournful tolling of the bell
  on the Shivering Sand.</p>

  <p>At length there came to his ear the muffled sound of oars working in the
  holes; then, at the very edge of the circle of grey water that was visible,
  the boat appeared through the fog, pale and spectral, with a shadowy figure
  pulling furiously. The horn emitted a hoarse growl; the man looked round,
  perceived the lighthouse and altered his course towards it.</p>

  <p>Jeffreys descended the iron stairway, and, walking along the lower
  gallery, stood at the head of the ladder earnestly watching the approaching
  stranger. Already he was tired of being alone. The yearning for human
  companionship had been growing ever since Barnett left. But what sort of
  comrade was this stranger who was coming into his life? And coming to occupy
  so dominant a place in it.</p>

  <p>The boat swept down swiftly athwart the hurrying tide. Nearer it came and
  yet nearer: and still Jeffreys could catch no glimpse of his new comrade's
  face. At length it came fairly alongside and bumped against the fender-posts;
  the stranger whisked in an oar and grabbed a rung of the ladder, and Jeffreys
  dropped a coil of rope into the boat. And still the man's face was
  hidden.</p>

  <p>Jeffreys leaned out over the ladder and watched him anxiously, as he made
  fast the rope, unhooked the sail from the traveller and unstepped the mast.
  When he had set all in order, the stranger picked up a small chest, and,
  swinging it over his shoulder, stepped onto the ladder. Slowly, by reason of
  his encumbrance, he mounted, rung by rung, with never an upward glance, and
  Jeffreys gazed down at the top of his head with growing curiosity. At last he
  reached the top of the ladder and Jeffreys stooped to lend him a hand. Then,
  for the first time, he looked up, and Jeffreys started back with a blanched
  face.</p>

  <p>"God Almighty!" he gasped. "It's Amos Todd!"</p>

  <p>As the newcomer stepped on the gallery, the fog-horn emitted a roar like
  that of some hungry monster. Jeffreys turned abruptly without a word, and
  walked to the stairs, followed by Todd, and the two men ascended with never a
  sound but the hollow clank of their footsteps on the iron plates. Silently
  Jeffreys stalked into the living-room and, as his companion followed, he
  turned and motioned to the latter to set down his chest.</p>

  <p>"You ain't much of a talker, mate," said Todd, looking round the room in
  some surprise; "ain't you going to say 'good-morning'? We're going to be good
  comrades, I hope. I'm Jim Brown, the new hand, I am; what might your name
  be?"</p>

  <p>Jeffreys turned on him suddenly and led him to the window. "Look at me
  carefully, Amos Todd," he said sternly, "and then ask yourself what my name
  is."</p>

  <p>At the sound of his voice Todd looked up with a start and turned pale as
  death. "It can't be," he whispered, "it can't be Jeff Rorke!"</p>

  <p>The other man laughed harshly, and leaning forward, said in a low voice:
  "Hast thou found me, O mine enemy!"</p>

  <p>"Don't say that!" exclaimed Todd. "Don't call me your enemy, Jeff. Lord
  knows but I'm glad to see you, though I'd never have known you without your
  beard and with that grey hair. I've been to blame, Jeff, and I know it; but
  it ain't no use raking up old grudges. Let bygones be bygones, Jeff, and let
  us be pals as we used to be." He wiped his face with his handkerchief and
  watched his companion apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Rorke, pointing to a shabby rep-covered arm-chair; "sit
  down and tell me what you've done with all that money. You've blued it all, I
  suppose, or you wouldn't be here."</p>

  <p>"Robbed, Jeff," answered Todd; "robbed of every penny. Ah! that was an
  unfortunate affair, that job on board the old Sea-flower. But it's over and
  done with and we'd best forget it. They're all dead but us, Jeff, so we're
  safe enough so long as we keep our mouths shut; all at the bottom of the
  sea&mdash;and the best place for 'em too."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Rorke replied fiercely, "that's the best place for your shipmates
  when they know too much; at the bottom of the sea or swinging at the end of a
  rope." He paced up and down the little room with rapid strides, and each time
  that he approached Todd's chair the latter shrank back with an expression of
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"Don't sit there staring at me," said Rorke. "Why don't you smoke or do
  something?"</p>

  <p>Todd hastily produced a pipe from his pocket, and having filled it from a
  moleskin pouch, stuck it in his mouth while he searched for a match.
  Apparently he carried his matches loose in his pocket, for he presently
  brought one forth&mdash;a red-headed match, which, when he struck it on the
  wall, lighted with a pale-blue flame. He applied it to his pipe, sucking in
  his cheeks while he kept his eyes fixed on his companion. Rorke, meanwhile,
  halted in his walk to cut some shavings from a cake of hard tobacco with a
  large clasp-knife; and, as he stood, he gazed with frowning abstraction at
  Todd.</p>

  <p>"This pipe's stopped," said the latter, sucking ineffectually at the
  mouthpiece. "Have you got such a thing as a piece of wire, Jeff?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," replied Rorke; "not up here. I'll get a bit from the
  store presently. Here, take this pipe till you can clean your own: I've got
  another in the rack there." The sailor's natural hospitality overcoming for
  the moment his animosity, he thrust the pipe that he had just filled towards
  Todd, who took it with a mumbled "Thank you" and an anxious eye on the open
  knife. On the wall beside the chair was a roughly-carved pipe-rack
  containing: several pipes, one of which Rorke lifted out; and, as he leaned
  over the chair to reach it, Todd's face went several shades paler.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jeff," he said, after a pause, while Rorke cut a fresh "fill" of
  tobacco, "are we going to be pals same as what we used to be?"</p>

  <p>Rorke's animosity lighted up afresh. "Am I going to be pals with the man
  that tried to swear away my life?" he said sternly; and after a pause he
  added: "That wants thinking about, that does; and meantime I must go and look
  at the engine."</p>

  <p>When Rorke had gone the new hand sat, with the two pipes in his hands,
  reflecting deeply. Abstractedly he stuck the fresh pipe into his mouth, and,
  dropping the stopped one into the rack, felt for a match. Still with an air
  of abstraction he lit the pipe, and having smoked for a minute or two, rose
  from the chair and began softly to creep across the room, looking about him
  and listening intently. At the door he paused to look out into the fog, and
  then, having again listened attentively, he stepped on tip-toe out onto the
  gallery and along towards the stairway. Of a sudden the voice of Rorke
  brought him up with a start.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Todd! where are you off to?"</p>

  <p>"I'm just going down to make the boat secure," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind about the boat," said Rorke. "I'll see to her."</p>

  <p>"Right-o, Jeff," said Todd, still edging towards the stairway. "But, I
  say, mate, where's the other man&mdash;the man that I'm to relieve?"</p>

  <p>"There ain't any other man," replied Rorke; "he went off aboard a
  collier."</p>

  <p>Todd's face suddenly became grey and haggard. "Then there's no one here
  but us two!" he gasped; and then, with an effort to conceal his fear, he
  asked: "But who's going to take the boat back?"</p>

  <p>"We'll see about that presently," replied Rorke; "you get along in and
  unpack your chest."</p>

  <p>He came out on the gallery as he spoke, with a lowering frown on his face.
  Todd cast a terrified glance at him, and then turned and ran for his life
  towards the stairway.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" roared Rorke, springing forward along the gallery; but Todd's
  feet were already clattering down the iron steps. By the time Rorke reached
  the head of the stairs, the fugitive was near the bottom; but here, in his
  haste, he stumbled, barely saving himself by the handrail, and when he
  recovered his balance Rorke was upon him. Todd darted to the head of the
  ladder, but, as he grasped the stanchion, his pursuer seized him by the
  collar. In a moment he had turned with his hand under his coat. There was a
  quick blow, a loud curse from Rorke, an answering yell from Todd, and a knife
  fell spinning through the air and dropped into the fore-peak of the boat
  below.</p>

  <p>"You murderous little devil!" said Rorke in an ominously quiet voice, with
  his bleeding hand gripping his captive by the throat. "Handy with your knife
  as ever, eh? So you were off to give information, were you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't Jeff," replied Todd in a choking voice; "I wasn't, s'elp me,
  God. Let go, Jeff. I didn't mean no harm. I was only&mdash;" With a sudden
  wrench he freed one hand and struck out frantically at his captor's face. But
  Rorke warded off the blow, and, grasping the other wrist, gave a violent push
  and let go. Todd staggered backward a few paces along the staging, bringing
  up at the extreme edge; and here, for a sensible time, he stood with
  wide-open mouth and starting eye-balls, swaying and clutching wildly at the
  air. Then, with a shrill scream, he toppled backwards and fell, striking a
  pile in his descent and rebounding into the water.</p>

  <p>In spite of the audible thump of his head on the pile, he was not stunned,
  for when he rose to the surface, he struck out vigorously, uttering short,
  stifled cries for help. Rorke watched him with set teeth and quickened
  breath, but made no move. Smaller and still smaller grew the head with its
  little circle of ripples, swept away on the swift ebb-tide, and fainter the
  bubbling cries that came across the smooth water. At length as the small
  black spot began to fade in the fog, the drowning man, with a final effort,
  raised his head clear of the surface and sent a last, despairing shriek
  towards the lighthouse. The fog-horn sent back an answering bellow; the head
  sank below the surface and was seen no more; and in the dreadful stillness
  that settled down upon the sea there sounded faint and far away the muffled
  tolling of a bell.</p>

  <p>Rorke stood for some minutes immovable, wrapped in thought. Presently the
  distant hoot of a steamer's whistle aroused him. The ebb-tide shipping was
  beginning to come down and the fog might lift at any moment; and there was
  the boat still alongside. She must be disposed of at once. No one had seen
  her arrive and no one must see her made fast to the lighthouse. Once get rid
  of the boat and all traces of Todd's visit would be destroyed. He ran down
  the ladder and stepped into the boat. It was simple. She was heavily
  ballasted, and would go down if she filled.</p>

  <p>He shifted some of the bags of shingle, and, lifting the bottom boards,
  pulled out the plug. Instantly a large jet of water spouted up into the
  bottom. Rorke looked at it critically, and, deciding that it would fill her
  in a few minutes, replaced the bottom boards; and having secured the mast and
  sail with a few turns of the sheet round a thwart, to prevent them from
  floating away, he cast off the mooring-rope and stepped on the ladder.</p>

  <p>As the released boat began to move away on the tide, he ran up and mounted
  to the upper gallery to watch her disappearance. Suddenly he remembered
  Todd's chest. It was still in the room below. With a hurried glance around
  into the fog, he ran down to the room, and snatching up the chest, carried it
  out on the lower gallery. After another nervous glance around to assure
  himself that no craft was in sight, he heaved the chest over the handrail,
  and, when it fell with a loud splash into the sea, he waited to watch it
  float away after its owner and the sunken boat. But it never rose; and
  presently he returned to the upper gallery.</p>

  <p>The fog was thinning perceptibly now, and the boat remained plainly
  visible as she drifted away. But she sank more slowly than he had expected,
  and presently as she drifted farther away, he fetched the telescope and
  peered at her with growing anxiety. It would be unfortunate if any one saw
  her; if she should be picked up here, with her plug out, it would be
  disastrous.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to be really alarmed. Through the glass he could see that
  the boat was now rolling in a sluggish, water-logged fashion, but she still
  showed some inches of free-board, and the fog was thinning every moment.</p>

  <p>Presently the blast of a steamer's whistle sounded close at hand. He
  looked round hurriedly and, seeing nothing, again pointed the telescope
  eagerly at the dwindling boat. Suddenly he gave a gasp of relief. The boat
  had rolled gunwale under; had staggered back for a moment and then rolled
  again, slowly, finally, with the water pouring in over the submerged
  gunwale.</p>

  <p>In a few more seconds she had vanished. Rorke lowered the telescope and
  took a deep breath. Now he was safe. The boat had sunk unseen. But he was
  better than safe: he was free. His evil spirit, the standing menace of his
  life, was gone, and the wide world, the world of life, of action, of
  pleasure, called to him.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the fog lifted. The sun shone brightly on the
  red-funnelled cattle-boat whose whistle had startled him just now, the summer
  blue came back to sky and sea, and the land peeped once more over the edge of
  the horizon.</p>

  <p>He went in, whistling cheerfully, and stopped the motor; returned to coil
  away the rope that he had thrown to Todd; and, when he had hoisted a signal
  for assistance, he went in once more to eat his solitary meal in peace and
  gladness.</p>

  <h3>PART II. &mdash; "THE SINGING BONE"</h3>

  <h4>(RELATED BY CHRISTOPHER JERVIS, M.D.)</h4>

  <p class="first">IN every kind of scientific work a certain amount of manual
  labour naturally appertains, labour that cannot be performed by the scientist
  himself, since art is long but life is short. A chemical analysis involves a
  laborious "clean up" of apparatus and laboratory, for which the chemist has
  no time; the preparation of a skeleton&mdash;the maceration, bleaching,
  "assembling," and riveting together of bones&mdash;must be carried out by
  someone whose time is not too precious. And so with other scientific
  activities. Behind the man of science with his outfit of knowledge is the
  indispensable mechanic with his outfit of manual skill.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's laboratory assistant, Polton, was a fine example of the latter
  type, deft, resourceful, ingenious and untiring. He was somewhat of an
  inventive genius, too; and it was one of his inventions that connected us
  with the singular case that I am about to record.</p>

  <p>Though by trade a watchmaker, Polton was, by choice, an optician. Optical
  apparatus was the passion of his life; and when, one day, he produced for our
  inspection an improved prism for increasing the efficiency of gas-buoys,
  Thorndyke at once brought the invention to the notice of a friend at the
  Trinity House.</p>

  <p>As a consequence, we three&mdash;Thorndyke, Polton and I&mdash;found
  ourselves early on a fine July morning making our way down Middle Temple Lane
  bound for the Temple Pier. A small oil-launch lay alongside the pontoon, and,
  as we made our appearance, a red-faced, white-whiskered gentleman stood up in
  the cockpit.</p>

  <p>"Here's a delightful morning, doctor," he sang out in a fine, brassy,
  resonant, sea-faring voice; "sort of day for a trip to the lower river, hey?
  Hallo, Polton! Coming down to take the bread out of our mouths, are you? Ha,
  ha!" The cheery laugh rang out over the river and mingled with the throb of
  the engine as the launch moved off from the pier.</p>

  <p>Captain Grumpass was one of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House.
  Formerly a client of Thorndyke's he had subsided, as Thorndyke's clients were
  apt to do, into the position of a personal friend, and his hearty regard
  included our invaluable assistant.</p>

  <p>"Nice state of things," continued the captain, with a chuckle, "when a
  body of nautical experts have got to be taught their business by a parcel of
  lawyers or doctors, what? I suppose trade's slack and 'Satan findeth mischief
  still,' hey, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"There isn't much doing on the civil side, sir," replied Polton, with a
  quaint, crinkly smile, "but the criminals are still going strong."</p>

  <p>"Ha! mystery department still flourishing, what? And, by Jove! talking of
  mysteries, doctor, our people have got a queer problem to work out; something
  quite in your line&mdash;quite. Yes, and, by the Lord Moses, since I've got
  you here, why shouldn't I suck your brains?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke. "Why shouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I will," said the captain, "so here goes. All hands to the
  pump!" He lit a cigar, and, after a few preliminary puffs, began: "The
  mystery, shortly stated, is this: one of our lighthousemen has
  disappeared&mdash;vanished off the face of the earth and left no trace. He
  may have bolted, he may have been drowned accidentally or he may have been
  murdered. But I'd rather give you the particulars in order. At the end of
  last week a barge brought into Ramsgate a letter from the screw-pile
  lighthouse on the Girdler. There are only two men there, and it seems that
  one of them, a man named Barnett, had broken his leg, and he asked that the
  tender should be sent to bring him ashore. Well, it happened that the local
  tender, the Warden, was up on the slip in Ramsgate Harbour, having a scrape
  down, and wouldn't be available for a day or two, so, as the case was urgent,
  the officer at Ramsgate sent a letter to the lighthouse by one of the
  pleasure steamers saying that the man should be relieved by boat on the
  following morning, which was Saturday. He also wrote to a new hand who had
  just been taken on, a man named James Brown, who was lodging near Reculver,
  waiting his turn, telling him to go out on Saturday morning in the
  coast-guard's boat; and he sent a third letter to the coast-guard at Reculver
  asking him to take Brown out to the lighthouse and bring Barnett ashore.
  Well, between them, they made a fine muddle of it. The coast-guard couldn't
  spare either a boat or a man, so they borrowed a fisherman's boat, and in
  this the man Brown started off alone, like an idiot, on the chance that
  Barnett would be able to sail the boat back in spite of his broken leg.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile Barnett, who is a Whitstable man, had signalled a collier bound
  for his native town, and got taken off; so that the other keeper, Thomas
  Jeffreys, was left alone until Brown should turn up.</p>

  <p>"But Brown never did turn up. The coast-guard helped him to put off and
  saw him well out to sea, and the keeper, Jeffreys, saw a sailing-boat with
  one man in her making for the lighthouse. Then a bank of fog came up and hid
  the boat, and when the fog cleared she was nowhere to be seen. Man and boat
  had vanished and left no sign."</p>

  <p>"He may have been run down," Thorndyke suggested.</p>

  <p>"He may," agreed the captain, "but no accident has been reported. The
  coast-guards think he may have capsized in a squall&mdash;they saw him make
  the sheet fast. But there weren't any squalls; the weather was quite
  calm."</p>

  <p>"Was he all right and well when he put off?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the captain, "the coast-guards' report is highly
  circumstantial; in fact, it's full of silly details that have no bearing on
  anything. This is what they say." He pulled out an official letter and read:
  "'When last seen, the missing man was seated in the boat's stern to windward
  of the helm. He had belayed the sheet. He was holding a pipe and
  tobacco-pouch in his hands and steering with his elbow. He was filling the
  pipe from the tobacco-pouch.' There! 'He was holding the pipe in his hand,'
  mark you! not with his toes; and he was filling it from a tobacco-pouch,
  whereas you'd have expected him to fill it from a coalscuttle or a
  feeding-bottle. Bah!" The captain rammed the letter back in his pocket and
  puffed scornfully at his cigar.</p>

  <p>"You are hardly fair to the coast-guard," said Thorndyke, laughing at the
  captain's vehemence. "The duty of a witness is to give all the facts, not a
  judicious selection."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear sir," said Captain Grumpass, "what the deuce can it matter
  what the poor devil filled his pipe from?"</p>

  <p>"Who can say?" answered Thorndyke. "It may turn out to be a highly
  material fact. One never knows beforehand. The value of a particular fact
  depends on its relation to the rest of the evidence."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does," grunted the captain; and he continued to smoke in
  reflective silence until we opened Black-wall Point, when he suddenly stood
  up.</p>

  <p>"There's a steam trawler alongside our wharf," he announced. "Now what the
  deuce can she be doing there?" He scanned the little steamer attentively, and
  continued:</p>

  <p>"They seem to be landing something, too. Just pass me those glasses,
  Polton. Why, hang me! it's a dead body! But why on earth are they landing it
  on our wharf? They must have known you were coming, doctor."</p>

  <p>As the launch swept alongside the wharf, the captain sprang up lightly and
  approached the group gathered round the body. "What's this?" he asked. "Why
  have they brought this thing here?"</p>

  <p>The master of the trawler, who had superintended the landing, proceeded to
  explain.</p>

  <p>"It's one of your men, sir," said he. "We saw the body lying on the edge
  of the South Shingles Sand, close to the beacon, as we passed at low water,
  so we put off the boat and fetched it aboard. As there was nothing to
  identify the man by, I had a look in his pockets and found this letter."</p>

  <p>He handed the captain an official envelope addressed to: "Mr. J. Brown, co
  Mr. Solly, Shepherd, Reculver, Kent."</p>

  <p>"Why, this is the man we were speaking about, doctor," exclaimed Captain
  Grumpass. "What a very singular coincidence. But what are we to do with the
  body?"</p>

  <p>"You will have to write to the coroner," replied Thorndyke. "By the way,
  did you turn out all the pockets?" he asked, turning to the skipper of the
  trawler.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," was the reply. "I found the letter in the first pocket that I
  felt in, so I didn't examine any of the others. Is there anything more that
  you want to know, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but your name and address, for the coroner," replied Thorndyke,
  and the skipper, having given this information and expressed the hope that
  the coroner would not keep him "hanging about," returned to his vessel and
  pursued his way to Billingsgate.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would mind having a look at the body of this poor devil,
  while Polton is showing us his contraptions," said Captain Grumpass.</p>

  <p>"I can't do much without a coroner's order," replied Thorndyke; "but if it
  will give you any satisfaction, Jervis and I will make a preliminary
  inspection with pleasure."</p>

  <p>"I should be glad if you would," said the captain. "We should like to know
  that the poor beggar met his end fairly."</p>

  <p>The body was accordingly moved to a shed, and, as Polton was led away,
  carrying the black bag that contained his precious model, we entered the shed
  and commenced our investigation.</p>

  <p>The deceased was a small, elderly man, decently dressed in a somewhat
  nautical fashion. He appeared to have been dead only two or three days, and
  the body, unlike the majority of sea-borne corpses, was uninjured by fish or
  crabs. There were no fractured bones or other gross injuries, and no wounds,
  excepting a rugged tear in the scalp at the back of the head.</p>

  <p>"The general appearance of the body," said Thorndyke, when he had noted
  these particulars, "suggests death by drowning, though, of course, we can't
  give a definite opinion until a post mortem has been made."</p>

  <p>"You don't attach any significance to that scalp-wound, then?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"As a cause of death? No. It was obviously inflicted during life, but it
  seems to have been an oblique blow that spent its force on the scalp, leaving
  the skull uninjured. But it is very significant in another way."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke took out his pocket-case and extracted a pair of forceps.
  "Consider the circumstances," said he. "This man put off from the shore to go
  to the lighthouse, but never arrived there. The question is, where did he
  arrive?" As he spoke he stooped over the corpse and turned back the hair
  round the wound with the beak of the forceps. "Look at those white objects
  among the hair, Jervis, and inside the wound. They tell us something, I
  think."</p>

  <p>I examined, through my lens, the chalky fragments to which he pointed.
  "These seem to be bits of shells and the tubes of some marine worm," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered; "the broken shells are evidently those of the acorn
  barnacle, and the other fragments are mostly pieces of the tubes of the
  common serpula. The inference that these objects suggest is an important one.
  It is that this wound was produced by some body encrusted by acorn barnacles
  and serpula; that is to say, by a body that is periodically submerged. Now,
  what can that body be, and how can the deceased have knocked his head against
  it?"</p>

  <p>"It might be the stem of a ship that ran him down," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you would find many serpulae on the stem of a ship," said
  Thorndyke. "The combination rather suggests some stationary object between
  tidemarks, such as a beacon. But one doesn't see how a man could knock his
  head against a beacon, while, on the other hand, there are no other
  stationary objects out in the estuary to knock against except buoys, and a
  buoy presents a flat surface that could hardly have produced this wound. By
  the way, we may as well see what there is in his pockets, though it is not
  likely that robbery had anything to do with his death."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, "and I see his watch is in his pocket; quite a good silver
  one," I added, taking it out. "It has stopped at 12.13."</p>

  <p>"That may be important," said Thorndyke, making a note of the fact; "but
  we had better examine the pockets one at a time, and put the things back when
  we have looked at them."</p>

  <p>The first pocket that we turned out was the left hip-pocket of the monkey
  jacket. This was apparently the one that the skipper had rifled, for we found
  in it two letters, both bearing the crest of the Trinity House. These, of
  course, we returned without reading, and then passed on to the right pocket.
  The contents of this were common-place enough, consisting of a briar pipe, a
  moleskin pouch and a number of loose matches.</p>

  <p>"Rather a casual proceeding, this," I remarked, "to carry matches loose in
  the pocket, and a pipe with them, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke; "especially with these very inflammable matches.
  You notice that the sticks had been coated at the upper end with sulphur
  before the red phosphorous heads were put on. They would light with a touch,
  and would be very difficult to extinguish; which, no doubt, is the reason
  that this type of match is so popular among seamen, who have to light their
  pipes in all sorts of weather." As he spoke he picked up the pipe and looked
  at it reflectively, turning it over in his hand and peering into the bowl.
  Suddenly he glanced from the pipe to the dead man's face and then, with the
  forceps, turned back the lips to look into the mouth.</p>

  <p>"Let us see what tobacco he smokes," said he.</p>

  <p>I opened the sodden pouch and displayed a mass of dark, fine-cut tobacco.
  "It looks like shag," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is shag," he replied; "and now we will see what is in the pipe.
  It has been only half-smoked out." He dug out the "dottle" with his
  pocket-knife onto a sheet of paper, and we both inspected it. Clearly it was
  not shag, for it consisted of coarsely-cut shreds and was nearly black.</p>

  <p>"Shavings from a cake of 'hard,'" was my verdict, and Thorndyke agreed as
  he shot the fragments back into the pipe.</p>

  <p>The other pockets yielded nothing of interest, except a pocket-knife,
  which Thorndyke opened and examined closely. There was not much money, though
  as much as one would expect, and enough to exclude the idea of robbery.</p>

  <p>"Is there a sheath-knife on that strap?" Thorndyke asked, pointing to a
  narrow leather belt. I turned back the jacket and looked.</p>

  <p>"There is a sheath," I said, "but no knife. It must have dropped out."</p>

  <p>"That is rather odd," said Thorndyke. "A sailor's sheath-knife takes a
  deal of shaking out as a rule. It is intended to be used in working on the
  rigging when the man is aloft, so that he can get it out with one hand while
  he is holding on with the other. It has to be and usually is very secure, for
  the sheath holds half the handle as well as the blade. What makes one notice
  the matter in this case is that the man, as you see, carried a pocket-knife;
  and, as this would serve all the ordinary purposes of a knife, it seems to
  suggest that the sheath-knife was carried for defensive purposes: as a
  weapon, in fact. However, we can't get much further in the case without a
  post mortem, and here comes the captain."</p>

  <p>Captain Grumpass entered the shed and looked down commiseratingly at the
  dead seaman.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything, doctor, that throws any light on the man's
  disappearance?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There are one or two curious features in the case," Thorndyke replied;
  "but, oddly enough, the only really important point arises out of that
  statement of the coastguard's, concerning which you were so scornful."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed the captain.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke; "the coast-guard states that when last seen
  deceased was filling his pipe from his tobacco-pouch. Now his pouch contains
  shag; but the pipe in his pocket contains hard cut."</p>

  <p>"Is there no cake tobacco in any of the pockets?"</p>

  <p>"Not a fragment. Of course, it is possible that he might have had a piece
  and used it up to fill the pipe; but there is no trace of any on the blade of
  his pocket-knife, and you know how this juicy black cake stains a
  knife-blade. His sheath-knife is missing, but he would hardly have used that
  to shred tobacco when he had a pocket-knife."</p>

  <p>"No," assented the captain; "but are you sure he hadn't a second
  pipe?"</p>

  <p>"There was only one pipe," replied Thorndyke, "and that was not his
  own."</p>

  <p>"Not his own!" exclaimed the captain, halting by a huge, chequered buoy,
  to stare at my colleague. "How do you know it was not his own?"</p>

  <p>"By the appearance of the vulcanite mouthpiece," said Thorndyke. "It
  showed deep tooth-marks; in fact, it was nearly bitten through. Now a man who
  bites through his pipe usually presents certain definite physical
  peculiarities, among which is, necessarily, a fairly good set of teeth. But
  the dead man had not a tooth in his head."</p>

  <p>The captain cogitated a while, and then remarked: "I don't quite see the
  bearing of this."</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" said Thorndyke. "It seems to me highly suggestive. Here is a
  man who, when last seen, was filling his pipe with a particular kind of
  tobacco. He is picked up dead, and his pipe contains a totally different kind
  of tobacco. Where did that tobacco come from? The obvious suggestion is that
  he had met someone."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it does look like it," agreed the captain.</p>

  <p>"Then," continued Thorndyke, "there is the fact that his sheath-knife is
  missing. That may mean nothing, but we have to bear it in mind. And there is
  another curious circumstance: there is a wound on the back of the head caused
  by a heavy bump against some body that was covered with acorn barnacles and
  marine worms. Now there are no piers or stages out in the open estuary. The
  question is, what could he have struck?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there is nothing in that," said the captain. "When a body has been
  washing about in a tide-way for close on three days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But this is not a question of a body," Thorndyke interrupted. "The wound
  was made during life."</p>

  <p>"The deuce it was!" exclaimed the captain. "Well, all I can suggest is
  that he must have fouled one of the beacons in the fog, stove in his boat and
  bumped his head, though, I must admit, that's rather a lame explanation." He
  stood for a minute gazing at his toes with a cogitative frown and then looked
  up at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," he said. "From what you say, this matter wants looking
  into pretty carefully. Now, I am going down on the tender to-day to make
  inquiries on the spot. What do you say to coming with me as adviser&mdash;as
  a matter of business, of course&mdash;you and Dr. Jervis? I shall start about
  eleven; we shall be at the lighthouse by three o'clock, and you can get back
  to town to-night, if you want to. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to hinder us," I put in eagerly, for even at Bugsby's
  Hole the river looked very alluring on this summer morning.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke, "we will come. Jervis is evidently hankering
  for a sea-trip, and so am I, for that matter."</p>

  <p>"It's a business engagement, you know," the captain stipulated.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," said Thorndyke; "it's unmitigated pleasure; the
  pleasure of the voyage and your high well-born society."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that," grumbled the captain, "but, if you are coming as
  guests, send your man for your nightgear and let us bring you back to-morrow
  evening."</p>

  <p>"We won't disturb Polton," said my colleague; "we can take the train from
  Blackwall and fetch our things ourselves. Eleven o'clock, you said?"</p>

  <p>"Thereabouts," said Captain Grumpass; "but don't put yourselves out."</p>

  <p>The means of communication in London have reached an almost undesirable
  state of perfection. With the aid of the snorting train and the tinkling,
  two-wheeled "gondola," we crossed and re-crossed the town with such celerity
  that it was barely eleven when we re-appeared on Trinity Wharf with a joint
  Gladstone and Thorndyke's little green case.</p>

  <p>The tender had hauled out of Bow Creek, and now lay alongside the wharf
  with a great striped can buoy dangling from her derrick, and Captain Grumpass
  stood at the gangway, his jolly, red face beaming with pleasure. The buoy was
  safely stowed forward, the derrick hauled up to the mast, the loose shrouds
  rehooked to the screw-lanyards, and the steamer, with four jubilant hoots,
  swung round and shoved her sharp nose against the incoming tide.</p>

  <p>For near upon four hours the ever-widening stream of the "London River"
  unfolded its moving panorama. The smoke and smell of Woolwich Reach gave
  place to lucid air made soft by the summer haze; the grey huddle of factories
  fell away and green levels of cattle-spotted marsh stretched away to the high
  land bordering the river valley. Venerable training ships displayed their
  chequered hulls by the wooded shore, and whispered of the days of oak and
  hemp, when the tall three-decker, comely and majestic, with her soaring
  heights of canvas, like towers of ivory, had not yet given place to the
  mud-coloured saucepans that fly the white ensign now-a-days and devour the
  substance of the British taxpayer: when a sailor was a sailor and not a mere
  seafaring mechanic. Sturdily breasting the flood tide, the tender threaded
  her way through the endless procession of shipping; barges, billy-boys,
  schooners, brigs; lumpish Black-seamen, blue-funnelled China tramps, rickety
  Baltic barques with twirling windmills, gigantic liners, staggering under a
  mountain of top-hamper. Erith, Purfleet, Greenhithe, Grays greeted us and
  passed astern. The chimneys of Northfleet, the clustering roofs of Gravesend,
  the populous anchorage and the lurking batteries, were left behind, and, as
  we swung out of the Lower Hope, the wide expanse of sea reach spread out
  before us like a great sheet of blue-shot satin.</p>

  <p>About half-past twelve the ebb overtook us and helped us on our way, as we
  could see by the speed with which the distant land slid past, and the
  freshening of the air as we passed through it.</p>

  <p>But sky and sea were hushed in a summer calm. Balls of fleecy cloud hung
  aloft, motionless in the soft blue; the barges drifted on the tide with
  drooping sails, and a big, striped bell buoy&mdash;surmounted by a staff and
  cage and labelled, "Shivering Sand"&mdash;sat dreaming in the sun above its
  motionless reflection, to rouse for a moment as it met our wash, nod its cage
  drowsily, utter a solemn ding-dong, and fall asleep again.</p>

  <p>It was shortly after passing the buoy that the gaunt shape of a screw-pile
  lighthouse began to loom up ahead, its dull-red paint turned to vermilion by
  the early afternoon sun. As we drew nearer, the name Girdler, painted in
  huge, white letters, became visible, and two men could be seen in the gallery
  around the lantern, inspecting us through a telescope.</p>

  <p>"Shall you be long at the lighthouse, sir?" the master of the tender
  inquired of Captain Grumpass; "because we're going down, to the North-East
  Pan Sand to fix this new buoy and take up the old one."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better put us off at the lighthouse and come back for us when
  you've finished the job," was the reply. "I don't know how long we shall
  be."</p>

  <p>The tender was brought to, a boat lowered, and a couple of hands pulled us
  across the intervening space of water.</p>

  <p>"It will be a dirty climb for you in your shore-going clothes," the
  captain remarked&mdash;he was as spruce as a new pin himself, "but the stuff
  will all wipe off." We looked up at the skeleton shape. The falling tide had
  exposed some fifteen feet of the piles, and piles and ladder alike were
  swathed in sea-grass and encrusted with barnacles and worm-tubes. But we were
  not such town-sparrows as the captain seemed to think, for we both followed
  his lead without difficulty up the slippery ladder, Thorndyke clinging
  tenaciously to his little green case, from which he refused to be separated
  even for an instant.</p>

  <p>"These gentlemen and I," said the captain, as we stepped on the stage at
  the head of the ladder, "have come to make inquiries about the missing man,
  James Brown. Which of you is Jeffreys?"</p>

  <p>"I am, sir," replied a tall, powerful, square-jawed, beetle-browed man,
  whose left hand was tied up in a rough bandage.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing to your hand?" asked the captain.</p>

  <p>"I cut it while I was peeling some potatoes," was the reply. "It isn't
  much of a cut, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, Jeffreys," said the captain, "Brown's body has been picked up and I
  want particulars for the inquest. You'll be summoned as a witness, I suppose,
  so come in and tell us all you know."</p>

  <p>We entered the living-room and seated ourselves at the table. The captain
  opened a massive pocket-book, while Thorndyke, in his attentive, inquisitive
  fashion, looked about the odd, cabin-like room as if making a mental
  inventory of its contents.</p>

  <p>Jeffreys' statement added nothing to what we already knew. He had seen a
  boat with one man in it making for the lighthouse. Then the fog had drifted
  up and he had lost sight of the boat. He started the fog-horn and kept a
  bright look-out, but the boat never arrived. And that was all he knew. He
  supposed that the man must have missed the lighthouse and been carried away
  on the ebb-tide, which was running strongly at the time.</p>

  <p>"What time was it when you last saw the boat?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"About half-past eleven," replied Jeffreys.</p>

  <p>"What was the man like?" asked the captain.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir; he was rowing, and his back was towards me."</p>

  <p>"Had he any kit-bag or chest with him?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"He'd got his chest with him," said Jeffreys.</p>

  <p>"What sort of chest was it?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"A small chest, painted green, with rope beckets."</p>

  <p>"Was it corded?"</p>

  <p>"It had a single cord round, to hold the lid down."</p>

  <p>"Where was it stowed?"</p>

  <p>"In the stern-sheets, sir."</p>

  <p>"How far off was the boat when you last saw it?"</p>

  <p>"About half-a-mile."</p>

  <p>"Half-a-mile!" exclaimed the captain. "Why, how the deuce could you see
  that chest half-a-mile away?"</p>

  <p>The man reddened and cast a look of angry suspicion at Thorndyke. "I was
  watching the boat through the glass, sir," he replied sulkily.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Captain Grumpass. "Well, that will do, Jeffreys. We shall
  have to arrange for you to attend the inquest. Tell Smith I want to see
  him."</p>

  <p>The examination concluded, Thorndyke and I moved our chairs to the window,
  which looked out over the sea to the east. But it was not the sea or the
  passing ships that engaged my colleague's attention. On the wall, beside the
  window, hung a rudely-carved pipe-rack containing five pipes. Thorndyke had
  noted it when we entered the room, and now, as we talked, I observed him
  regarding it from time to time with speculative interest.</p>

  <p>"You men seem to be inveterate smokers," he remarked to the keeper, Smith,
  when the captain had concluded the arrangements for the "shift."</p>

  <p>"Well, we do like our bit of 'baccy, sir, and that's a fact," answered
  Smith. "You see, sir," he continued, "it's a lonely life, and tobacco's cheap
  out here."</p>

  <p>"How is that?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Why, we get it given to us. The small craft from foreign, especially the
  Dutchmen, generally heave us a cake or two when they pass close. We're not
  ashore, you see, so there's no duty to pay."</p>

  <p>"So you don't trouble the tobacconists much? Don't go in for cut
  tobacco?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; we'd have to buy it, and then the cut stuff wouldn't keep. No,
  it's hard-tack to eat out here and hard tobacco to smoke."</p>

  <p>"I see you've got a pipe-rack, too, quite a stylish affair."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Smith, "I made it in my off-time. Keeps the place tidy and
  looks more ship-shape than letting the pipes lay about anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Someone seems to have neglected his pipe," said Thorndyke, pointing to
  one at the end of the rack which was coated with green mildew.</p>

  <p>"Yes; that's Parsons, my mate. He must have left it when he went off near
  a month ago. Pipes do go mouldy in the damp air out here."</p>

  <p>"How soon does a pipe go mouldy if it is left untouched?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It's according to the weather," said Smith. "When it's warm and damp
  they'll begin to go in about a week. Now here's Barnett's pipe that he's left
  behind&mdash;the man that broke his leg, you know, sir&mdash;it's just
  beginning to spot a little. He couldn't have used it for a day or two before
  he went."</p>

  <p>"And are all these other pipes yours?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. This here one is mine. The end one is Jeffreys', and I suppose
  the middle one is his too, but I don't know it."</p>

  <p>"You're a demon for pipes, doctor," said the captain, strolling up at this
  moment; "you seem to make a special study of them."</p>

  <p>"'The proper study of mankind is man,'" replied Thorndyke, as the keeper
  retired, "and 'man' includes those objects on which his personality is
  impressed. Now a pipe is a very personal thing. Look at that row in the rack.
  Each has its own physiognomy which, in a measure, reflects the peculiarities
  of the owner. There is Jeffreys' pipe at the end, for instance. The
  mouth-piece is nearly bitten through, the bowl scraped to a shell and scored
  inside and the brim battered and chipped. The whole thing speaks of rude
  strength and rough handling. He chews the stem as he smokes, he scrapes the
  bowl violently, and he bangs the ashes out with unnecessary force. And the
  man fits the pipe exactly: powerful, square-jawed and, I should say, violent
  on occasion."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he looks a tough customer, does Jeffreys," agreed the captain.</p>

  <p>"Then," continued Thorndyke, "there is Smith's pipe, next to it; 'coked'
  up until the cavity is nearly filled and burnt all round the edge; a talker's
  pipe, constantly going out and being relit. But the one that interests me
  most is the middle one."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Smith say that was Jeffreys' too?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke, "but he must be mistaken. It is the very
  opposite of Jeffreys' pipe in every respect. To begin with, although it is an
  old pipe, there is not a sign of any tooth-mark on the mouth-piece. It is the
  only one in the rack that is quite unmarked. Then the brim is quite
  uninjured: it has been handled gently, and the silver band is jet-black,
  whereas the band on Jeffreys' pipe is quite bright."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't noticed that it had a band," said the captain. "What has made it
  so black?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke lifted the pipe out of the rack and looked at it closely.
  "Silver sulphide," said he, "the sulphur no doubt derived from something
  carried in the pocket."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Captain Grumpass, smothering a yawn and gazing out of the
  window at the distant tender. "Incidentally it's full of tobacco. What moral
  do you draw from that?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke turned the pipe over and looked closely at the mouth-piece. "The
  moral is," he replied, "that you should see that your pipe is clear before
  you fill it." He pointed to the mouth-piece, the bore of which was completely
  stopped up with fine fluff.</p>

  <p>"An excellent moral too," said the captain, rising with another yawn. "If
  you'll excuse me a minute I'll just go and see what the tender is up to. She
  seems to be crossing to the East Girdler." He reached the telescope down from
  its brackets and went out onto the gallery.</p>

  <p>As the captain retreated, Thorndyke opened his pocket-knife, and, sticking
  the blade into the bowl of the pipe, turned the tobacco out into his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Shag, by Jove!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, poking it back into the bowl. "Didn't you expect it to
  be shag?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I expected anything," I admitted. "The silver band was
  occupying my attention."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is an interesting point," said Thorndyke, "but let us see what
  the obstruction consists of." He opened the green case, and, taking out a
  dissecting needle, neatly extracted a little ball of fluff from the bore of
  the pipe. Laying this on a glass slide, he teased it out in a drop of
  glycerine and put on a cover-glass while I set up the microscope.</p>

  <p>"Better put the pipe back in the rack," he said, as he laid the slide on
  the stage of the instrument. I did so and then turned, with no little
  excitement, to watch him as he examined the specimen. After a brief
  inspection he rose and waved his hand towards the microscope.</p>

  <p>"Take a look at it, Jervis," he said.</p>

  <p>I applied my eye to the instrument, and, moving the slide about,
  identified the constituents of the little mass of fluff. The ubiquitous
  cotton fibre was, of course, in evidence, and a few fibres of wool, but the
  most remarkable objects were two or three hairs&mdash;very minute hairs of a
  definite zigzag shape and having a flat expansion near the free end like the
  blade of a paddle.</p>

  <p>"These are the hairs of some small animal," I said; "not a mouse or rat or
  any rodent, I should say. Some small insectivorous animal, I fancy. Yes! Of
  course! They are the hairs of a mole." I stood up, and, as the importance of
  the discovery flashed on me, I looked at my colleague in silence.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "they are unmistakable; and they furnish the keystone of
  the argument."</p>

  <p>"You think that this is really the dead man's pipe, then?" I said.</p>

  <p>"According to the law of multiple evidence," he replied, "it is
  practically a certainty. Consider the facts in sequence. Since there is no
  sign of mildew on it, this pipe can have been here only a short time, and
  must belong either to Barnett, Smith, Jeffreys or Brown. It is an old pipe,
  but it has no tooth-marks on it. Therefore it has been used by a man who has
  no teeth. But Barnett, Smith and Jeffreys all have teeth and mark their
  pipes, whereas Brown has no teeth. The tobacco in it is shag. But these three
  men do not smoke shag, whereas Brown had shag in his pouch. The silver band
  is encrusted with sulphide; and Brown carried sulphur-tipped matches loose in
  his pocket with his pipe. We find hairs of a mole in the bore of the pipe;
  and Brown carried a moleskin pouch in the pocket in which he appears to have
  carried his pipe. Finally, Brown's pocket contained a pipe which was
  obviously not his and which closely resembled that of Jeffreys; it contained
  tobacco similar to that which Jeffreys smokes and different from that in
  Brown's pouch. It appears to me quite conclusive, especially when we add to
  this evidence the other items that are in our possession."</p>

  <p>"What items are they?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"First there is the fact that the dead man had knocked his head heavily
  against some periodically submerged body covered with acorn barnacles and
  serpulae. Now the piles of this lighthouse answer to the description exactly,
  and there are no other bodies in the neighbourhood that do: for even the
  beacons are too large to have produced that kind of wound. Then the dead
  man's sheath-knife is missing, and Jeffreys has a knife-wound on his hand.
  You must admit that the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming."</p>

  <p>At this moment the captain bustled into the room with the telescope in his
  hand. "The tender is coming up towing a strange boat," he said. "I expect
  it's the missing one, and, if it is, we may learn something. You'd better
  pack up your traps and get ready to go on board."</p>

  <p>We packed the green case and went out into the gallery, where the two
  keepers were watching the approaching tender; Smith frankly curious and
  interested, Jeffreys restless, fidgety and noticeably pale. As the steamer
  came opposite the lighthouse, three men dropped into the boat and pulled
  across, and one of them&mdash;the mate of the tender&mdash;came climbing up
  the ladder.</p>

  <p>"Is that the missing boat?" the captain sang out.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered the officer, stepping onto the staging and wiping his
  hands on the reverse aspect of his trousers, "we saw her lying on the dry
  patch of the East Girdler. There's been some hanky-panky in this job,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Foul play, you think, hey?"</p>

  <p>"Not a doubt of it, sir. The plug was out and lying loose in the bottom,
  and we found a sheath-knife sticking into the kelson forward among the coils
  of the painter. It was stuck in hard as if it had dropped from a height."</p>

  <p>"That's odd," said the captain. "As to the plug, it might have got out by
  accident."</p>

  <p>"But it hadn't sir," said the mate. "The ballast-bags had been shifted
  along to get the bottom boards up. Besides, sir, a seaman wouldn't let the
  boat fill; he'd have put the plug back and baled out."</p>

  <p>"That's true," replied Captain Grumpass; "and certainly the presence of
  the knife looks fishy. But where the deuce could it have dropped from, out in
  the open sea? Knives don't drop from the clouds&mdash;fortunately. What do
  you say, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I should say that it is Brown's own knife, and that it probably fell from
  this staging."</p>

  <p>Jeffreys turned swiftly, crimson with wrath. "What d'ye mean?" he
  demanded. "Haven't I said that the boat never came here?"</p>

  <p>"You have," replied Thorndyke; "but if that is so, how do you explain the
  fact that your pipe was found in the dead man's pocket and that the dead
  man's pipe is at this moment in your pipe-rack?"</p>

  <p>The crimson flush on Jeffreys' face faded as quickly as it had come. "I
  don't know what you're talking about," he faltered.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said Thorndyke. "I will relate what happened and you
  shall check my statements. Brown brought his boat alongside and came up into
  the living-room, bringing his chest with him. He filled his pipe and tried to
  light it, but it was stopped and wouldn't draw. Then you lent him a pipe of
  yours and filled it for him. Soon afterwards you came out on this staging and
  quarrelled. Brown defended himself with his knife, which dropped from his
  hand into the boat. You pushed him off the staging and he fell, knocking his
  head on one of the piles. Then you took the plug out of the boat and sent her
  adrift to sink, and you flung the chest into the sea. This happened about ten
  minutes past twelve. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Jeffreys stood staring at Thorndyke, the picture of amazement and
  consternation; but he uttered no word in reply. "Am I right?" Thorndyke
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"Strike me blind!" muttered Jeffreys. "Was you here, then? You talk as if
  you had been. Anyhow," he continued, recovering somewhat, "you seem to know
  all about it. But you're wrong about one thing. There was no quarrel. This
  chap, Brown, didn't take to me and he didn't mean to stay out here. He was
  going to put off and go ashore again and I wouldn't let him. Then he hit out
  at me with his knife and I knocked it out of his hand and he staggered
  backwards and went overboard."</p>

  <p>"And did you try to pick him up?" asked the captain.</p>

  <p>"How could I," demanded Jeffreys, "with the tide racing down and me alone
  on the station? I'd never have got back."</p>

  <p>"But what about the boat, Jeffreys? Why did you scuttle her?"</p>

  <p>"The fact is," replied Jeffreys, "I got in a funk, and I thought the
  simplest plan was to send her to the cellar and know nothing about it. But I
  never shoved him over. It was an accident, sir; I swear it!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that sounds a reasonable explanation," said the captain. "What do
  you say, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly reasonable," replied Thorndyke, "and, as to its truth, that is
  no affair of ours."</p>

  <p>"No. But I shall have to take you off, Jeffreys, and hand you over to the
  police. You understand that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I understand," answered Jeffreys.</p>

  <p>"That was a queer case, that affair on the Girdler," remarked Captain
  Grumpass, when he was spending an evening with us some six months later. "A
  pretty easy let off for Jeffreys, too&mdash;eighteen months, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was a very queer case indeed," said Thorndyke. "There was
  something behind that 'accident,' I should say. Those men had probably met
  before."</p>

  <p>"So I thought," agreed the captain. "But the queerest part of it to me was
  the way you nosed it all out. I've had a deep respect for briar pipes since
  then. It was a remarkable case," he continued. "The way in which you made
  that pipe tell the story of the murder seems to me like sheer
  enchantment."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "it spoke like the magic pipe&mdash;only that wasn't a
  tobacco-pipe&mdash;in the German folk-story of the 'Singing Bone.' Do you
  remember it? A peasant found the bone of a murdered man and fashioned it into
  a pipe. But when he tried to play on it, it burst into a song of its
  own&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"'My brother slew me and buried my bones<br>
  Beneath the sand and under the stones.'"</p><br>

  <p>"A pretty story," said Thorndyke, "and one with an excellent moral. The
  inanimate things around us have each of them a song to sing to us if we are
  but ready with attentive ears."</p>

  <h2><a name="c5"
     id="c5"></a>IV. &mdash; A WASTREL'S ROMANCE</h2>

  <h3>PART I. &mdash; THE SPINSTERS' GUEST</h3>

  <p class="first">THE lingering summer twilight was fast merging into night as
  a solitary cyclist, whose evening-dress suit was thinly disguised by an
  overcoat, rode slowly along a pleasant country road. From time to time he had
  been overtaken and passed by a carriage, a car or a closed cab from the
  adjacent town, and from the festive garb of the occupants he had made shrewd
  guesses at their destination. His own objective was a large house, standing
  in somewhat extensive grounds just off the road, and the peculiar
  circumstances that surrounded his visit to it caused him to ride more and
  more slowly as he approached his goal.</p>

  <p>Willowdale&mdash;such was the name of the house&mdash;was, tonight,
  witnessing a temporary revival of its past glories. For many months it had
  been empty and a notice-board by the gate-keeper's lodge had silently
  announced its forlorn state; but to-night, its rooms, their bare walls
  clothed in flags and draperies, their floors waxed or carpeted, would once
  more echo the sound of music and cheerful voices and vibrate to the tread of
  many feet. For on this night the spinsters of Raynesford were giving a dance;
  and chief amongst the spinsters was Miss Halliwell, the owner of
  Willowdale.</p>

  <p>It was a great occasion. The house was large and imposing; the spinsters
  were many and their purses were long. The guests were numerous and
  distinguished, and included no less a person than Mrs. Jehu B. Chater. This
  was the crowning triumph of the function, for the beautiful American widow
  was the lion (or should we say lioness?) of the season. Her wealth was, if
  not beyond the dreams of avarice, at least beyond the powers of common
  British arithmetic, and her diamonds were, at once, the glory and the terror
  of her hostesses.</p>

  <p>All these attractions notwithstanding, the cyclist approached the vicinity
  of Willowdale with a slowness almost hinting at reluctance; and when, at
  length, a curve of the road brought the gates into view, he dismounted and
  halted irresolutely. He was about to do a rather risky thing, and, though by
  no means a man of weak nerve, he hesitated to make the plunge.</p>

  <p>The fact is, he had not been invited.</p>

  <p>Why, then, was he going? And how was he to gain admittance? To which
  questions the answer involves a painful explanation.</p>

  <p>Augustus Bailey lived by his wits. That is the common phrase, and a stupid
  phrase it is. For do we not all live by our wits, if we have any? And does it
  need any specially brilliant wits to be a common rogue? However, such as his
  wits were, Augustus Bailey lived by them, and he had not hitherto made a
  fortune.</p>

  <p>The present venture arose out of a conversation overheard at a restaurant
  table and an invitation-card carelessly laid down and adroitly covered with
  the menu. Augustus had accepted the invitation that he had not received (on a
  sheet of Hotel Cecil notepaper that he had among his collection of
  stationery) in the name of Geoffrey Harrington-Baillie; and the question that
  exercised his mind at the moment was, would he or would he not be spotted? He
  had trusted to the number of guests and the probable inexperience of the
  hostesses. He knew that the cards need not be shown, though there was the
  awkward ceremony of announcement.</p>

  <p>But perhaps it wouldn't get as far as that. Probably not, if his
  acceptance had been detected as emanating from an uninvited stranger.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly towards the gates with growing discomfort. Added to his
  nervousness as to the present were certain twinges of reminiscence. He had
  once held a commission in a line regiment&mdash;not for long, indeed; his
  "wits" had been too much for his brother officers&mdash;but there had been a
  time when he would have come to such a gathering as this an invited guest.
  Now, a common thief, he was sneaking in under a false name, with a fair
  prospect of being ignominiously thrown out by the servants.</p>

  <p>As he stood hesitating, the sound of hoofs on the road was followed by the
  aggressive bellow of a motor-horn. The modest twinkle of carriage lamps
  appeared round the curve and then the glare of acetylene headlights. A man
  came out of the lodge and drew open the gates; and Mr. Bailey, taking his
  courage in both hands, boldly trundled his machine up the drive.</p>

  <p>Half-way up&mdash;it was quite a steep incline&mdash;the car whizzed by; a
  large Napier filled with a bevy of young men who economized space by sitting
  on the backs of the seats and on one another's knees. Bailey looked at them
  and decided that this was his chance, and, pushing forward, he saw his
  bicycle safely bestowed in the empty coach-house and then hurried on to the
  cloak-room. The young men had arrived there before him and, as he entered,
  were gaily peeling off their overcoats and flinging them down on a table.
  Bailey followed their example, and, in his eagerness to enter the
  reception-room with the crowd, let his attention wander from the business of
  the moment, and, as he pocketed the ticket and hurried away, he failed to
  notice that the bewildered attendant had put his hat with another man's coat
  and affixed his duplicate to them both.</p>

  <p>"Major Podbury, Captain Barker-Jones, Captain Sparker, Mr. Watson, Mr.
  Goldsmith, Mr. Smart, Mr. Harrington-Baillie!"</p>

  <p>As Augustus swaggered up the room, hugging the party of officers and
  quaking inwardly, he was conscious that his hostesses glanced from one man to
  another with more than common interest.</p>

  <p>But at that moment the footman's voice rang out, sonorous and
  clear&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Chater, Colonel Grumpier!" and, as all eyes were turned towards the
  new arrivals, Augustus made his bow and passed into the throng. His little
  game of bluff had "come off," after all.</p>

  <p>He withdrew modestly into the more crowded portion of the room, and there
  took up a position where he would be shielded from the gaze of his hostesses.
  Presently, he reflected, they would forget him, if they had really thought
  about him at all, and then he would see what could be done in the way of
  business. He was still rather shaky, and wondered how soon it would be decent
  to steady his nerves with a "refresher." Meanwhile he kept a sharp look-out
  over the shoulders of neighbouring guests, until a movement in the crowd of
  guests disclosed Mrs. Chater shaking hands with the presiding spinster. Then
  Augustus got a most uncommon surprise.</p>

  <p>He knew her at the first glance. He had a good memory for faces, and Mrs.
  Chater's face was one to remember. Well did he recall the frank and lovely
  American girl with whom he had danced at the regimental ball years ago. That
  was in the old days when he was a subaltern, and before that little affair of
  the pricked court-cards that brought his military career to an end. They had
  taken a mutual liking, he remembered, that sweet-faced Yankee maid and he had
  danced many dances and had sat out others, to talk mystical nonsense which,
  in their innocence, they had believed to be philosophy. He had never seen her
  since. She had come into his life and gone out of it again, and he had
  forgotten her name, if he had ever known it. But here she was, middle-aged
  now, it was true, but still beautiful and a great personage withal. And, ye
  gods! what diamonds! And here was he, too, a common rogue, lurking in the
  crowd that he might, perchance, snatch a pendant or "pinch" a loose
  brooch.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she might recognize him. Why not? He had recognized her. But that
  would never do. And thus reflecting, Mr. Bailey slipped out to stroll on the
  lawn and smoke a cigarette. Another man, somewhat older than himself, was
  pacing to and fro thoughtfully, glancing from time to time through the open
  windows into the brilliantly-lighted rooms. When they had passed once or
  twice, the stranger halted and addressed him.</p>

  <p>"This is the best place on a night like this," he remarked; "it's getting
  hot inside already. But perhaps you're keen on dancing."</p>

  <p>"Not so keen as I used to be," replied Bailey; and then, observing the
  hungry look that the other man was bestowing on his cigarette, he produced
  his case and offered it.</p>

  <p>"Thanks awfully!" exclaimed the stranger, pouncing with avidity on the
  open case. "Good Samaritan, by Jove. Left my case in my overcoat. Hadn't the
  cheek to ask, though I was starving for a smoke." He inhaled luxuriously,
  and, blowing out a cloud of smoke, resumed: "These chits seem to be running
  the show pretty well, h'm? Wouldn't take it for an empty house to look at it,
  would you?"</p>

  <p>"I have hardly seen it," said Bailey; "only just come, you know."</p>

  <p>"We'll have a look round, if you like," said the genial stranger, "when
  we've finished our smoke, that is. Have a drink too; may cool us a bit. Know
  many people here?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," replied Bailey. "My, hostess doesn't seem to have turned
  up."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's easily remedied," said the stranger. "My daughter's one of
  the spinsters&mdash;Granby, my name; when we've had a drink, I'll make her
  find you a partner&mdash;that is, if you care for the light fantastic."</p>

  <p>"I should like a dance or two," said Bailey, "though I'm getting a bit
  past it now, I suppose. Still, it doesn't do to chuck up the sponge
  prematurely."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Granby agreed jovially; "a man's as young as he feels.
  Well, come and have a drink and then we'll hunt up my little girl." The two
  men flung away the stumps of their cigarettes and headed for the
  refreshments.</p>

  <p>The spinsters' champagne was light, but it was well enough if taken in
  sufficient quantity; a point to which Augustus? and Granby too&mdash;paid
  judicious attention; and when he had supplemented the wine with a few
  sandwiches, Mr. Bailey felt in notably better spirits. For, to tell the
  truth, his diet, of late, had been somewhat meagre. Miss Granby, when found,
  proved to be a blonde and guileless "flapper" of some seventeen summers,
  childishly eager to play her part of hostess with due dignity; and presently
  Bailey found himself gyrating through the eddying crowd in company with a
  comely matron of thirty or thereabouts.</p>

  <p>The sensations that this novel experience aroused rather took him by
  surprise. For years past he had been living a precarious life of mean and
  sordid shifts that oscillated between mere shabby trickery and downright
  crime; now conducting a paltry swindle just inside the pale of the law, and
  now, when hard pressed, descending to actual theft; consorting with shady
  characters, swindlers and knaves and scurvy rogues like himself; gambling,
  borrowing, cadging and, if need be, stealing, and always slinking abroad with
  an apprehensive eye upon "the man in blue."</p>

  <p>And now, amidst the half-forgotten surroundings, once so familiar; the
  gaily-decorated rooms, the rhythmic music, the twinkle of jewels, the murmur
  of gliding feet and the rustle of costly gowns, the moving vision of honest
  gentlemen and fair ladies; the shameful years seemed to drop away and leave
  him to take up the thread of his life where it had snapped so disastrously.
  After all, these were his own people. The seedy knaves in whose steps he had
  walked of late were but aliens met by the way.</p>

  <p>He surrendered his partner, in due course, with regret&mdash;which was
  mutual&mdash;to an inarticulate subaltern, and was meditating another
  pilgrimage to the refreshment-room, when he felt a light touch upon his arm.
  He turned swiftly. A touch on the arm meant more to him than to some men. But
  it was no wooden-faced plain-clothes man that he confronted; it was only a
  lady. In short, it was Mrs. Chater, smiling nervously and a little abashed by
  her own boldness.</p>

  <p>"I expect you've forgotten me," she began apologetically, but Augustus
  interrupted her with an eager disclaimer.</p>

  <p>"Of course I haven't," he said; "though I have forgotten your name, but I
  remember that Portsmouth dance as well as if it were yesterday; at least one
  incident in it&mdash;the only one that was worth remembering. I've often
  hoped that I might meet you again, and now, at last, it has happened."</p>

  <p>"It's nice of you to remember," she rejoined. "I've often and often
  thought of that evening and all the wonderful things that we talked about.
  You were a nice boy then; I wonder what you are like now. What a long time
  ago it is!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Augustus agreed gravely, "it is a long time. I know it myself; but
  when I look at you, it seems as if it could only have been last season."</p>

  <p>"Oh, fie!" she exclaimed. "You are not simple as you used to be. You
  didn't flatter then; but perhaps there wasn't the need." She spoke with
  gentle reproach, but her pretty face flushed with pleasure nevertheless, and
  there was a certain wistfulness in the tone of her concluding sentence.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't flattering," Augustus replied, quite sincerely; "I knew you
  directly you entered the room and marvelled that Time had been so gentle with
  you. He hasn't been as kind to me."</p>

  <p>"No. You have gotten a few grey hairs, I see, but after all, what are grey
  hairs to a man? Just the badges of rank, like the crown on your collar or the
  lace on your cuffs, to mark the steps of your promotion&mdash;for I guess
  you'll be a colonel by now."</p>

  <p>"No," Augustus answered quickly, with a faint flush, "I left the army some
  years ago."</p>

  <p>"My! what a pity!" exclaimed Mrs. Chater. "You must tell me all about
  it&mdash;but not now. My partner will be looking for me. We will sit out a
  dance and have a real gossip. But I've forgotten your name&mdash;never could
  recall it, in fact, though that didn't prevent me from remembering you; but,
  as our dear W. S. remarks, 'What's in a name&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed," said Mr. Harrington-Baillie; and apropos of that sentiment,
  he added: "Mine is Rowland&mdash;Captain Rowland. You may remember it
  now."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Chater did not, however, and said so. "Will number six do?" she
  asked, opening her programme; and, when Augustus had assented, she entered
  his provisional name, remarking complacently: "We'll sit out and have a
  right-down good talk, and you shall tell me all about yourself and if you
  still think the same about free-will and personal responsibility. You had
  very lofty ideals, I remember, in those days, and I hope you have still. But
  one's ideals get rubbed down rather faint in the friction of life. Don't you
  think so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am afraid you're right," Augustus assented gloomily. "The wear and
  tear of life soon fetches the gilt off the gingerbread. Middle age is apt to
  find us a bit patchy, not to say naked."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be pessimistic," said Mrs. Chater; "that is the attitude of the
  disappointed idealist, and I am sure you have no reason, really, to be
  disappointed in yourself. But I must run away now. Think over all the things
  you have to tell me, and don't forget that it is number six." With a bright
  smile and a friendly nod she sailed away, a vision of glittering splendour,
  compared with which Solomon in all his glory was a mere matter of commonplace
  bullion.</p>

  <p>The interview, evidently friendly and familiar, between the unknown guest
  and the famous American widow had by no means passed unnoticed; and in other
  circumstances, Bailey might have endeavoured to profit by the reflected glory
  that enveloped him. But he was not in search of notoriety; and the same
  evasive instinct that had led him to sink Mr. Harrington-Baillie in Captain
  Rowland, now advised him to withdraw his dual personality from the vulgar
  gaze. He had come here on very definite business. For the hundredth time he
  was "stony-broke," and it was the hope of picking up some "unconsidered
  trifles" that had brought him. But, somehow, the atmosphere of the place had
  proved unfavourable. Either opportunities were lacking or he failed to seize
  them. In any case, the game pocket that formed an unconventional feature of
  his dress-coat was still empty, and it looked as if a pleasant evening and a
  good supper were all that he was likely to get. Nevertheless, be his conduct
  never so blameless, the fact remained that he was an uninvited guest, liable
  at any moment to be ejected as an impostor, and his recognition by the widow
  had not rendered this possibility any the more remote.</p>

  <p>He strayed out onto the lawn, whence the grounds fell away on all sides.
  But there were other guests there, cooling themselves after the last dance,
  and the light from the rooms streamed through the windows, illuminating their
  figures, and among them, that of the too-companionable Granby. Augustus
  quickly drew away from the lighted area, and, chancing upon a narrow path,
  strolled away along it in the direction of a copse or shrubbery that he saw
  ahead. Presently he came to an ivy-covered arch, lighted by one or two fairy
  lamps, and, passing through this, he entered a winding path, bordered by
  trees and shrubs and but faintly lighted by an occasional coloured lamp
  suspended from a branch.</p>

  <p>Already he was quite clear of the crowd; indeed, the deserted condition of
  the pleasant retreat rather surprised him, until he reflected that to couples
  desiring seclusion there were whole ranges of untenanted rooms and galleries
  available in the empty house.</p>

  <p>The path sloped gently downwards for some distance; then came a long
  flight of rustic steps and, at the bottom, a seat between two trees. In front
  of the seat the path extended in a straight line, forming a narrow terrace;
  on the right the ground sloped up steeply towards the lawn; on the left it
  fell away still more steeply towards the encompassing wall of the grounds;
  and on both sides it was covered with trees and shrubs.</p>

  <p>Bailey sat down on the seat to think over the account of himself that he
  should present to Mrs. Chater. It was a comfortable seat, built into the
  trunk of an elm, which formed one end and part of the back. He leaned against
  the tree, and, taking out his silver case, selected a cigarette. But it
  remained unlighted between his fingers as he sat and meditated upon his
  unsatisfactory past and the melancholy tale of what might have been. Fresh
  from the atmosphere of refined opulence that pervaded the dancing-rooms, the
  throng of well-groomed men and dainty women, his mind travelled back to his
  sordid little flat in Bermondsey, encompassed by poverty and squalor, jostled
  by lofty factories, grimy with the smoke of the river and the reek from the
  great chimneys. It was a hideous contrast. Verily the way of the transgressor
  was not strewn with flowers.</p>

  <p>At that point in his meditations he caught the sound of voices and
  footsteps on the path above and rose to walk on along the path. He did not
  wish to be seen wandering alone in the shrubbery. But now a woman's laugh
  sounded from somewhere down the path. There were people approaching that way
  too. He put the cigarette back in the case and stepped round behind the seat,
  intending to retreat in that direction, but here the path ended, and beyond
  was nothing but a rugged slope down to the wall thickly covered with bushes.
  And while he was hesitating, the sound of feet descending the steps and the
  rustle of a woman's dress left him to choose between staying where he was or
  coming out to confront the new-comers. He chose the former, drawing up close
  behind the tree to wait until they should have passed on.</p>

  <p>But they were not going to pass on. One of them&mdash;a woman&mdash;sat
  down on the seat, and then a familiar voice smote on his ear.</p>

  <p>"I guess I'll rest here quietly for a while; this tooth of mine is aching
  terribly; and, see here, I want you to go and fetch me something. Take this
  ticket to the cloak-room and tell the woman to give you my little velvet bag.
  You'll find in it a bottle of chloroform and a packet of cotton-wool."</p>

  <p>"But I can't leave you here all alone, Mrs. Chater," her partner
  expostulated.</p>

  <p>"I'm not hankering for society just now," said Mrs. Chater. "I want that
  chloroform. Just you hustle off and fetch it, like a good boy. Here's the
  ticket."</p>

  <p>The young officer's footsteps retreated rapidly, and the voices of the
  couple advancing along the path grew louder. Bailey, cursing the chance that
  had placed him in his ridiculous and uncomfortable position, heard them
  approach and pass on up the steps; and then all was silent, save for an
  occasional moan from Mrs. Chater and the measured creaking of the seat as she
  rocked uneasily to and fro. But the young man was uncommonly prompt in the
  discharge of his mission, and in a very few minutes Bailey heard him
  approaching at a run along the path above and then bounding down the
  steps.</p>

  <p>"Now I call that real good of you," said the widow gratefully. "You must
  have run like the wind. Cut the string of the packet and then leave me to
  wrestle with this tooth."</p>

  <p>"But I can't leave you here all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you can," interrupted Mrs. Chater. "There won't be any one
  about&mdash;the next dance is a waltz. Besides, you must go and find your
  partners."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you'd really rather be alone," the subaltern began; but Mrs.
  Chater interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Of course I would, when I'm fixing up my teeth. Now go along, and a
  thousand thanks for your kindness."</p>

  <p>With mumbled protestations the young officer slowly retired, and Bailey
  heard his reluctant feet ascending the steps. Then a deep silence fell on the
  place in which the rustle of paper and the squeak of a withdrawn cork seemed
  loud and palpable. Bailey had turned with his face towards the tree, against
  which he leaned with his lips parted scarcely daring to breathe. He cursed
  himself again and again for having thus entrapped himself for no tangible
  reason, and longed to get away. But there was no escape now without betraying
  himself. He must wait for the woman to go.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, beyond the edge of the tree, a hand appeared holding an open
  packet of cotton-wool. It laid the wool down on the seat, and, pinching off a
  fragment, rolled it into a tiny ball. The fingers of the hand were encircled
  by rings, its wrist enclosed by a broad bracelet; and from rings and bracelet
  the light of the solitary fairy-lamp, that hung from a branch of the tree,
  was reflected in prismatic sparks. The hand was withdrawn and Bailey stared
  dreamily at the square pad of cotton-wool. Then the hand came again into
  view. This time it held a small phial which it laid softly on the seat,
  setting the cork beside it. And again the light flashed in many-coloured
  scintillations from the encrusting gems.</p>

  <p>Bailey's knees began to tremble, and a chilly moisture broke out upon his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>The hand drew back, but, as it vanished, Bailey moved his head silently
  until his face emerged from behind the tree. The woman was leaning back, her
  head resting against the trunk only a few inches away from his face. The
  great stones of the tiara flashed in his very eyes. Over her shoulder, he
  could even see the gorgeous pendant, rising and falling on her bosom with
  ever-changing fires; and both her raised hands were a mass of glitter and
  sparkle, only the deeper and richer for the subdued light.</p>

  <p>His heart throbbed with palpable blows that drummed aloud in his ears. The
  sweat trickled clammily down his face, and he clenched his teeth to keep them
  from chattering. An agony of horror&mdash;of deadly fear&mdash;was creeping
  over him? a terror of the dreadful impulse that was stealing away his reason
  and his will.</p>

  <p>The silence was profound. The woman's soft breathing, the creak of her
  bodice, were plainly&mdash;grossly&mdash;audible; and he checked his own
  breath until he seemed on the verge of suffocation.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden through the night air was borne faintly the dreamy music of a
  waltz. The dance had begun. The distant sound but deepened the sense of
  solitude in this deserted spot.</p>

  <p>Bailey listened intently. He yearned to escape from the invisible force
  that seemed to be clutching at his wrists, and dragging him forward
  inexorably to his doom.</p>

  <p>He gazed down at the woman with a horrid fascination. He struggled to draw
  back out of sight&mdash;and struggled in vain.</p>

  <p>Then, at last, with a horrible, stealthy deliberation, a clammy, shaking
  hand crept forward towards the seat. Without a sound it grasped the wool, and
  noiselessly, slowly drew back. Again it stole forth. The fingers twined
  snakily around the phial, lifted it from the seat and carried it back into
  the shadow.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds it reappeared and softly replaced the bottle&mdash;now
  half empty. There was a brief pause. The measured cadences of the waltz stole
  softly through the quiet night and seemed to keep time with the woman's
  breathing. Other sound there was none. The place was wrapped in the silence
  of the grave.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, from the hiding-place, Bailey leaned forward over the back of
  the seat. The pad of cotton-wool was in his hand.</p>

  <p>The woman was now leaning back as if dozing, and her hands rested in her
  lap. There was a swift movement. The pad was pressed against her face and her
  head dragged back against the chest of the invisible assailant. A smothered
  gasp burst from her hidden lips as her hands flew up to clutch at the
  murderous arm; and then came a frightful struggle, made even more frightful
  by the gay and costly trappings of the writhing victim. And still there was
  hardly a sound; only muffled gasps, the rustle of silk, the creaking of the
  seat, the clink of the falling bottle and, afar off, with dreadful irony, the
  dreamy murmur of the waltz.</p>

  <p>The struggle was but brief. Quite suddenly the jewelled hands dropped, the
  head lay resistless on the crumpled shirt-front, and the body, now limp and
  inert, began to slip forward off the seat. Bailey, still grasping the passive
  head, climbed over the back of the seat and, as the woman slid gently to the
  ground, he drew away the pad and stooped over her. The struggle was over now;
  the mad fury of the moment was passing swiftly into the chill of mortal
  fear.</p>

  <p>He stared with incredulous horror into the swollen face, but now so
  comely, the sightless eyes that but a little while since had smiled into his
  with such kindly recognition.</p>

  <p>He had done this! He, the sneaking wastrel, discarded of all the world, to
  whom this sweet woman had held out the hand of friendship. She had cherished
  his memory, when to all others he was sunk deep under the waters of oblivion.
  And he had killed her&mdash;for to his ear no breath of life seemed to issue
  from those purple lips.</p>

  <p>A sudden hideous compunction for this irrevocable thing that he had done
  surged through him, and he stood up clutching at his damp hair with a hoarse
  cry that was like the cry of the damned.</p>

  <p>The jewels passed straightaway out of his consciousness. Everything was
  forgotten now but the horror of this unspeakable thing that he had done.
  Remorse incurable and haunting fear were all that were left to him.</p>

  <p>The sound of voices far away along the path aroused him, and the vague
  horror that possessed him materialized into abject bodily fear. He lifted the
  limp body to the edge of the path and let it slip down the steep declivity
  among the bushes. A soft, shuddering sigh came from the parted lips as the
  body turned over, and he paused a moment to listen. But there was no other
  sound of life. Doubtless that sigh was only the result of the passive
  movement.</p>

  <p>Again he stood for an instant as one in a dream, gazing at the huddled
  shape half hidden by the bushes, before he climbed back to the path; and even
  then he looked back once more, but now she was hidden from sight. And, as the
  voices drew nearer, he turned, and ran up the rustic steps.</p>

  <p>As he came out on the edge of the lawn the music ceased, and, almost
  immediately, a stream of people issued from the house. Shaken as he was,
  Bailey yet had wits enough left to know that his clothes and hair were
  disordered and that his appearance must be wild. Accordingly he avoided the
  dancers, and, keeping to the margin of the lawn, made his way to the
  cloak-room by the least frequented route. If he had dared, he would have
  called in at the refreshment-room, for he was deadly faint and his limbs
  shook as he walked. But a haunting fear pursued him and, indeed, grew from
  moment to moment. He found himself already listening for the rumour of the
  inevitable discovery.</p>

  <p>He staggered into the cloak-room, and, flinging his ticket down on the
  table, dragged out his watch. The attendant looked at him curiously and,
  pausing with the ticket in his hand, asked sympathetically: "Not feeling very
  well, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Bailey. "So beastly hot in there."</p>

  <p>"You ought to have a glass of champagne, sir, before you start," said the
  man.</p>

  <p>"No time," replied Bailey, holding out a shaky hand for his coat. "Shall
  lose my train if I'm not sharp."</p>

  <p>At this hint the attendant reached down the coat and hat, holding up the
  former for its owner to slip his arms into the sleeves. But Bailey snatched
  it from him, and, flinging it over his arm, put on his hat and hurried away
  to the coachhouse. Here, again, the attendant stared at him in astonishment,
  which was not lessened when Bailey, declining his offer to help him on with
  his coat, bundled the latter under his arm, clicked the lever of the
  "variable" on to the ninety gear, sprang onto the machine and whirled away
  down the steep drive, a grotesque vision of flying coat-tails.</p>

  <p>"You haven't lit your lamp, sir," roared the attendant; but Bailey's ears
  were deaf to all save the clamour of the expected pursuit.</p>

  <p>Fortunately the drive entered the road obliquely, or Bailey must have been
  flung into the opposite hedge. As it was, the machine, rushing down the
  slope, flew out into the road with terrific velocity; nor did its speed
  diminish then, for its rider, impelled by mortal terror, trod the pedals with
  the fury of a madman. And still, as the machine whizzed along the dark and
  silent road, his ears were strained to catch the clatter of hoofs or the
  throb of a motor from behind.</p>

  <p>He knew the country well, in fact, as a precaution, he had cycled over the
  district only the day before; and he was ready, at any suspicious sound, to
  slip down any of the lanes or byways, secure of finding his way. But still he
  sped on, and still no sound from the rear came to tell him of the dread
  discovery.</p>

  <p>When he had ridden about three miles, he came to the foot of a steep hill.
  Here he had to dismount and push his machine up the incline, which he did at
  such speed that he arrived at the top quite breathless. Before mounting again
  he determined to put on his coat, for his appearance was calculated to
  attract attention, if nothing more. It was only half-past eleven, and
  presently he would pass through the streets of a small town. Also he would
  light his lamp. It would be fatal to be stopped by a patrol or rural
  constable.</p>

  <p>Having lit his lamp and hastily put on his coat he once more listened
  intently, looking back over the country that was darkly visible from the
  summit of the hill. No moving lights were to be seen, no ringing hoofs or
  throbbing engines to be heard, and, turning to mount, he instinctively felt
  in his overcoat pocket for his gloves.</p>

  <p>A pair of gloves came out in his hand, but he was instantly conscious that
  they were not his. A silk muffler was there also; a white one. But his
  muffler was black.</p>

  <p>With a sudden shock of terror he thrust his hand into the ticket-pocket,
  where he had put his latch-key. There was no key there; only an amber
  cigar-holder, which he had never seen before. He stood for a few moments in
  utter consternation. He had taken the wrong coat. Then he had left his own
  coat behind. A cold sweat of fear broke out afresh on his face as he realized
  this. His Yale latch-key was in its pocket; not that that mattered very much.
  He had a duplicate at home, and, as to getting in, well, he knew his own
  outside door and his tool-bag contained one or two trifles not usually found
  in cyclists' tool-bags. The question was whether that coat contained anything
  that could disclose his identity. And then suddenly he remembered, with a
  gasp of relief, that he had carefully turned the pockets out before
  starting.</p>

  <p>No; once let him attain the sanctuary of his grimy little flat, wedged in
  as it was between the great factories by the river-side, and he would be
  safe: safe from everything but the horror of himself, and the haunting vision
  of a jewelled figure huddled up in a silken heap beneath the bushes.</p>

  <p>With a last look round he mounted his machine, and, driving it over the
  brow of the hill, swept away into the darkness.</p>

  <h3>PART II. &mdash; MUNERA PULVERIS</h3>

  <h4>(RELATED BY CHRISTOPHER JERVIS, M.D.)</h4>

  <p class="first">IT is one of the drawbacks of medicine as a profession that
  one is never rid of one's responsibilities. The merchant, the lawyer, the
  civil servant, each at the appointed time locks up his desk, puts on his hat
  and goes forth a free man with an interval of uninterrupted leisure before
  him. Not so the doctor. Whether at work or at play, awake or asleep, he is
  the servant of humanity, at the instant disposal of friend or stranger alike
  whose need may make the necessary claim.</p>

  <p>When I agreed to accompany my wife to the spinsters' dance at Raynesford,
  I imagined that, for that evening, at least, I was definitely off duty; and
  in that belief I continued until the conclusion of the eighth dance. To be
  quite truthful, I was not sorry when the delusion was shattered. My last
  partner was a young lady of a slanginess of speech that verged on the
  inarticulate. Now it is not easy to exchange ideas in "pidgin" English; and
  the conversation of a person to whom all things are either "ripping" or
  "rotten" is apt to lack subtlety. In fact, I was frankly bored; and,
  reflecting on the utility of the humble sandwich as an aid to conversation, I
  was about to entice my partner to the refreshment-room when I felt someone
  pluck at my sleeve. I turned quickly and looked into the anxious and rather
  frightened face of my wife.</p>

  <p>"Miss Halliwell is looking for you," she said. "A lady has been taken ill.
  Will you come and see what is the matter?" She took my arm and, when I had
  made my apologies to my partner, she hurried me on to the lawn.</p>

  <p>"It's a mysterious affair," my wife continued. "The sick lady is a Mrs.
  Chater, a very wealthy American widow. Edith Halliwell and Major Podbury
  found her lying in the shrubbery all alone and unable to give any account of
  herself. Poor Edith is dreadfully upset. She doesn't know what to think."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I began; but at this moment Miss Halliwell, who was
  waiting by an ivy-covered rustic arch, espied us and ran forward.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do hurry, please, Dr. Jervis," she exclaimed; "such a shocking thing
  has happened. Has Juliet told you?" Without waiting for an answer, she darted
  through the arch and preceded us along a narrow path at the curious,
  flat-footed, shambling trot common to most adult women. Presently we
  descended a flight of rustic steps which brought us to a seat, from whence
  extended a straight path cut like a miniature terrace on a steep slope, with
  a high bank rising to the right and declivity falling away to the left. Down
  in the hollow, his head and shoulders appearing above the bushes, was a man
  holding in his hand a fairy-lamp that he had apparently taken down from a
  tree. I climbed down to him, and, as I came round the bushes, I perceived a
  richly-dressed woman lying huddled on the ground. She was not completely
  insensible, for she moved slightly at my approach, muttering a few words in
  thick, indistinct accents. I took the lamp from the man, whom I assumed to be
  Major Podbury, and, as he delivered it to me with a significant glance and a
  faint lift of the eyebrows, I understood Miss Halliwell's agitation.
  Indeed&mdash;for one horrible moment I thought that she was right&mdash;that
  the prostrate woman was intoxicated. But when I approached nearer, the
  flickering light of the lamp made visible a square reddened patch on her
  face, like the impression of a mustard plaster, covering the nose and mouth;
  and then I scented mischief of a more serious kind.</p>

  <p>"We had better carry her up to the seat," I said, handing the lamp to Miss
  Halliwell. "Then we can consider moving her to the house." The major and I
  lifted the helpless woman and, having climbed cautiously up to the path, laid
  her on the seat.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Dr. Jervis?" Miss Halliwell whispered.</p>

  <p>"I can't say at the moment," I replied; "but it's not what you
  feared."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" was her fervent rejoinder. "It would have been a
  shocking scandal."</p>

  <p>I took the dim lamp and once more bent over the half-conscious woman.</p>

  <p>Her appearance puzzled me not a little. She looked like a person
  recovering from an anaesthetic, but the square red patch on her face,
  recalling, as it did, the Burke murders, rather suggested suffocation. As I
  was thus reflecting, the light of the lamp fell on a white object lying on
  the ground behind the seat, and holding the lamp forward, I saw that it was a
  square pad of cotton-wool. The coincidence of its shape and size with that of
  the red patch on the woman's face instantly struck me, and I stooped down to
  pick it up; and then I saw, lying under the seat, a small bottle. This also I
  picked up and held in the lamplight. It was a one-ounce phial, quite empty,
  and was labelled "Methylated Chloroform." Here seemed to be a complete
  explanation of the thick utterance and drunken aspect; but it was an
  explanation that required, in its turn, to be explained. Obviously no robbery
  had been committed, for the woman literally glittered with diamonds. Equally
  obviously she had not administered the chloroform to herself.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to carry her indoors and await her further
  recovery, so, with the major's help, we conveyed her through the shrubbery
  and kitchen garden to a side door, and deposited her on a sofa in a
  half-furnished room.</p>

  <p>Here, under the influence of water dabbed on her face and the plentiful
  use of smelling salts, she quickly revived, and was soon able to give an
  intelligible account of herself.</p>

  <p>The chloroform and cotton-wool were her own. She had used them for an
  aching tooth; and she was sitting alone on the seat with the bottle and the
  wool beside her when the incomprehensible thing had happened. Without a
  moment's warning a hand had come from behind her and pressed the pad of wool
  over her nose and mouth. The wool was saturated with chloroform, and she had
  lost consciousness almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"You didn't see the person, then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, but I know he was in evening dress, because I felt my head against
  his shirt-front."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "he is either here still or he has been to the cloak-room.
  He couldn't have left the place without an overcoat."</p>

  <p>"No, by Jove!" exclaimed the major; "that's true. I'll go and make
  inquiries." He strode away all agog, and I, having satisfied myself that Mrs.
  Chater could be left safely, followed him almost immediately.</p>

  <p>I made my way straight to the cloak-room, and here I found the major and
  one or two of his brother officers putting on their coats in a flutter of
  gleeful excitement.</p>

  <p>"He's gone," said Podbury, struggling frantically into his overcoat; "went
  off nearly an hour ago on a bicycle. Seemed in a deuce of a stew, the
  attendant says, and no wonder. We're goin' after him in our car. Care to join
  the hunt?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. I must stay with the patient. But how do you know you're
  after the right man?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't any other. Only one Johnnie's left. Besides&mdash;here, confound
  it! you've given me the wrong coat!" He tore off the garment and handed it
  back to the attendant, who regarded it with an expression of dismay.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," said the major. "Come, hurry up, my man."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, sir," said the attendant, "that the gentleman who has gone
  has taken your coat. They were on the same peg, I know. I am very sorry,
  sir."</p>

  <p>The major was speechless with wrath. What the devil was the good of being
  sorry; and how the deuce was he to get his coat back&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But," I interposed, "if the stranger has got your coat, then this coat
  must be his."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Podbury; "but I don't want his beastly coat."</p>

  <p>"No," I replied, "but it may be useful for identification."</p>

  <p>This appeared to afford the bereaved officer little consolation, but as
  the car was now ready, he bustled away, and I, having directed the man to put
  the coat away in a safe place, went back to my patient.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Chater was by now fairly recovered, and had developed a highly
  vindictive interest in her late assailant. She even went so far as to regret
  that he had not taken at least some of her diamonds, so that robbery might
  have been added to the charge of attempted murder, and expressed the earnest
  hope that the officers would not be foolishly gentle in their treatment of
  him when they caught him.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Dr. Jervis," said Miss Halliwell, "I think I ought to mention
  a rather curious thing that happened in connection with this dance. We
  received an acceptance from a Mr. Harrington-Baillie, who wrote from the
  Hotel Cecil. Now I am certain that no such name was proposed by any of the
  spinsters."</p>

  <p>"But didn't you ask them?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Well, the fact is," she replied, "that one of them, Miss Waters, had to
  go abroad suddenly, and we had not got her address; and as it was possible
  that she might have invited him, I did not like to move in the matter. I am
  very sorry I didn't now. We may have let in a regular criminal? though why he
  should have wanted to murder Mrs. Chater I cannot imagine."</p>

  <p>It was certainly a mysterious affair, and the mystery was in no wise
  dispelled by the return of the search party an hour later. It seemed that the
  bicycle had been tracked for a couple of miles towards London, but then, at
  the cross-roads, the tracks had become hopelessly mixed with the impressions
  of other machines and the officers, after cruising about vaguely for a while,
  had given up the hunt and returned.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mrs. Chater," Major Podbury explained apologetically, "the
  fellow must have had a good hour's start, and that would have brought him
  pretty close to London."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me," exclaimed Mrs. Chater, regarding the major with
  hardly-concealed contempt, "that that villain has got off scot-free?"</p>

  <p>"Looks rather like it," replied Podbury, "but if I were you I should get
  the man's description from the attendants who saw him and go up to Scotland
  Yard to-morrow. They may know the Johnny there, and they may even recognize
  the coat if you take it with you."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem very likely," said Mrs. Chater, and it certainly did
  not; but since no better plan could be suggested the lady decided to adopt
  it; and I supposed that I had heard the last of the matter.</p>

  <p>In this, however, I was mistaken. On the following day, just before noon,
  as I was drowsily considering the points in a brief dealing with a question
  of survivorship, while Thorndyke drafted his weekly lecture, a smart rat-tat
  at the door of our chambers announced a visitor. I rose wearily&mdash;I had
  had only four hours' sleep&mdash;and opened the door, whereupon there sailed
  into the room no less a person than Mrs. Chater, followed by Superintendent
  Miller, with a grin on his face and a brown-paper parcel under his arm.</p>

  <p>The lady was not in the best of tempers, though wonderfully lively and
  alert considering the severe shock that she had suffered so recently, and her
  disapproval of Miller was frankly obvious.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Jervis has probably told you about the attempt to murder me last
  night," she said, when I had introduced her to my colleague. "Well, now, will
  you believe it? I have been to the police, I have given them a description of
  the murderous villain, and I have even shown them the very coat that he wore,
  and they tell me that nothing can be done. That, in short, this scoundrel
  must be allowed to go his way free and unmolested."</p>

  <p>"You will observe, doctor," said Miller, "that this lady has given us a
  description that would apply to fifty per cent, of the middle-class men of
  the United Kingdom, and has shown us a coat without a single identifying mark
  of any kind on it, and expects us to lay our hands on the owner without a
  solitary clue to guide us. Now we are not sorcerers at the Yard; we're only
  policemen. So I have taken the liberty of referring Mrs. Chater to you." He
  grinned maliciously and laid the parcel on the table.</p>

  <p>"And what do you want me to do?" Thorndyke asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Why sir," said Miller, "there is a coat. In the pockets were a pair of
  gloves, a muffler, a box of matches, a tram-ticket and a Yale key. Mrs.
  Chater would like to know whose coat it is." He untied the parcel with his
  eye cocked at our rather disconcerted client, and Thorndyke watched him with
  a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"This is very kind of you, Miller," said he, "but I think a clairvoyant
  would be more to your purpose."</p>

  <p>The superintendent instantly dropped his facetious manner.</p>

  <p>"Seriously, sir," he said, "I should be glad if you would take a look at
  the coat. We have absolutely nothing to go on, and yet we don't want to give
  up the case. I have gone through it most thoroughly and can't find any clue
  to guide us. Now I know that nothing escapes you, and perhaps you might
  notice something that I have overlooked; something that would give us a hint
  where to start on, our inquiry. Couldn't you turn the microscope on it, for
  instance?" he added, with a deprecating smile.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected, with an inquisitive eye on the coat. I saw that the
  problem was not without its attractions to him; and when the lady seconded
  Miller's request with persuasive eagerness, the inevitable consequence
  followed.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "Leave the coat with me for an hour or so and I will
  look it over. I am afraid there is not the remotest chance of our learning
  anything from it, but even so, the examination will have done no harm. Come
  back at two o'clock; I shall be ready to report my failure by then."</p>

  <p>He bowed our visitors out and, returning to the table, looked down with a
  quizzical smile on the coat and the large official envelope containing
  articles from the pockets.</p>

  <p>"And what does my learned brother suggest?" he asked, looking up at
  me.</p>

  <p>"I should look at the tram-ticket first," I replied, "and then&mdash;well,
  Miller's suggestion wasn't such a bad one; to explore the surface with the
  microscope."</p>

  <p>"I think we will take the latter measure first," said he. "The tram-ticket
  might create a misleading bias. A man may take a tram anywhere, whereas the
  indoor dust on a man's coat appertains mostly to a definite locality."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied; "but the information that it yields is excessively
  vague."</p>

  <p>"That is true," he agreed, taking up the coat and envelope to carry them
  to the laboratory, "and yet, you know, Jervis, as I have often pointed out,
  the evidential value of dust is apt to be under-estimated. The naked-eye
  appearances? which are the normal appearances&mdash;are misleading. Gather
  the dust, say, from a table-top, and what have you? A fine powder of a
  characterless grey, just like any other dust from any other table-top. But,
  under the microscope, this grey powder is resolved into recognizable
  fragments of definite substances, which fragments may often be traced with
  certainty to the masses from which they have been detached. But you know all
  this as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"I quite appreciate the value of dust as evidence in certain
  circumstances," I replied, "but surely the information that could be gathered
  from dust on the coat of an unknown man must be too general to be of any use
  in tracing the owner."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you are right," said Thorndyke, laying the coat on the
  laboratory bench; "but we shall soon see, if Polton will let us have his
  patent dust-extractor."</p>

  <p>The little apparatus to which my colleague referred was the invention of
  our ingenious laboratory assistant, and resembled in principle the "vacuum
  cleaners" used for restoring carpets. It had, however, one special feature:
  the receiver was made to admit a microscope-slide, and on this the dust-laden
  air was delivered from a jet.</p>

  <p>The "extractor" having been clamped to the bench by its proud inventor,
  and a wetted slide introduced into the receiver, Thorndyke applied the nozzle
  of the instrument to the collar of the coat while Polton worked the pump. The
  slide was then removed and, another having been substituted, the nozzle was
  applied to the right sleeve near the shoulder, and the exhauster again worked
  by Polton. By repeating this process, half-a-dozen slides were obtained
  charged with dust from different parts of the garment, and then, setting up
  our respective microscopes, we proceeded to examine the samples.</p>

  <p>A very brief inspection showed me that this dust contained matter not
  usually met with&mdash;at any rate, in appreciable quantities. There were, of
  course, the usual fragments of wool, cotton and other fibres derived from
  clothing and furniture, particles of straw, husk, hair, various mineral
  particles and, in fact, the ordinary constituents of dust from clothing. But,
  in addition to these, and in much greater quantity, were a number of other
  bodies, mostly of vegetable origin and presenting well-defined characters in
  considerable variety, and especially abundant were various starch
  granules.</p>

  <p>I glanced at Thorndyke and observed he was already busy with a pencil and
  a slip of paper, apparently making a list of the objects visible in the field
  of the microscope. I hastened to follow his example, and for a time we worked
  on in silence. At length my colleague leaned back in his chair and read over
  his list.</p>

  <p>"This is a highly interesting collection, Jervis," he remarked. "What do
  you find on your slides out of the ordinary?"</p>

  <p>"I have quite a little museum here," I replied, referring to my list.
  "There is, of course, chalk from the road at Raynesford. In addition to this
  I find various starches, principally wheat and rice, especially rice,
  fragments of the cortices of several seeds, several different stone-cells,
  some yellow masses that look like turmeric, black pepper resin-cells, one
  'port wine' pimento cell, and one or two particles of graphite."</p>

  <p>"Graphite!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "I have found no graphite, but I have
  found traces of cocoa&mdash;spiral vessels and starch grains&mdash;and of
  hops&mdash;one fragment of leaf and several lupulin glands. May I see the
  graphite?"</p>

  <p>I passed him the slide and he examined it with keen interest. "Yes," he
  said, "this is undoubtedly graphite, and no less than six particles of it. We
  had better go over the coat systematically. You see the importance of
  this?"</p>

  <p>"I see that this is evidently factory dust and that it may fix a locality,
  but I don't see that it will carry us any farther."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that we have a touchstone," said he; and, as I raised my
  eyebrows inquiringly, he added, "The Yale latchkey. If we can narrow the
  locality down sufficiently, Miller can make a tour of the front doors."</p>

  <p>"But can we?" I asked incredulously. "I doubt it."</p>

  <p>"We can try," answered Thorndyke. "Evidently some of the substances are
  distributed over the entire coat, inside and out, while others, such as the
  graphite, are present only on certain parts. We must locate those parts
  exactly and then consider what this special distribution means." He rapidly
  sketched out on a sheet of paper a rough diagram of the coat, marking each
  part with a distinctive letter, and then, taking a number of labelled slides,
  he wrote a single letter on each. The samples of dust taken on the slides
  could thus be easily referred to the exact spots whence they had been
  obtained.</p>

  <p>Once more we set to work with the microscope, making, now and again, an
  addition to our lists of discoveries, and, at the end of nearly an hour's
  strenuous search, every slide had been examined and the lists compared.</p>

  <p>"The net result of the examination," said Thorndyke, "is this. The entire
  coat, inside and out, is evenly powdered with the following substances:
  Rice-starch in abundance, wheat-starch in less abundance, and smaller
  quantities of the starches of ginger, pimento and cinnamon; bast fibre of
  cinnamon, various seed cortices, stone-cells of pimento, cinnamon, cassia and
  black pepper, with other fragments of similar origin, such as resin-cells and
  ginger pigment&mdash;not turmeric. In addition there are, on the right
  shoulder and sleeve, traces of cocoa and hops, and on the back below the
  shoulders a few fragments of graphite. Those are the data; and now, what are
  the inferences? Remember this is not mere surface dust, but the accumulation
  of months, beaten into the cloth by repeated brushing&mdash;dust that nothing
  but a vacuum apparatus could extract."</p>

  <p>"Evidently," I said, "the particles that are all over the coat represent
  dust that is floating in the air of the place where the coat habitually
  hangs. The graphite has obviously been picked up from a seat and the cocoa
  and hops from some factories that the man passes frequently, though I don't
  see why they are on the right side only."</p>

  <p>"That is a question of time," said Thorndyke, "and incidentally throws
  some light on our friend's habits. Going from home, he passes the factories
  on his right; returning home, he passes them on his left, but they have then
  stopped work. However, the first group of substances is the more important as
  they indicate the locality of his dwelling&mdash;for he is clearly not a
  workman or factory employee. Now rice-starch, wheat-starch and a group of
  substances collectively designated 'spices' suggest a rice-mill, a flour-mill
  and a spice factory. Polton, may I trouble you for the Post Office
  Directory?"</p>

  <p>He turned over the leaves of the "Trades" section and resumed: "I see
  there are four rice-mills in London, of which the largest is Carbutt's at
  Dockhead. Let us look at the spice-factories." He again turned over the
  leaves and read down the list of names. "There are six spice-grinders in
  London," said he. "One of them, Thomas Williams &amp; Co., is at Dockhead.
  None of the others is near any rice-mill. The next question is as to the
  flour-mill. Let us see. Here are the names of several flour millers, but none
  of them is near either a rice-mill or a spice-grinder, with one exception:
  Seth Taylor's, St. Saviour's Flour Mills, Dockhead."</p>

  <p>"This is really becoming interesting," said I.</p>

  <p>"It has become interesting," Thorndyke retorted. "You observe that at
  Dockhead we find the peculiar combination of factories necessary to produce
  the composite dust in which this coat has hung; and the directory shows us
  that this particular combination exists nowhere else in London. Then the
  graphite, the cocoa and the hops tend to confirm the other suggestions. They
  all appertain to industries of the locality. The trams which pass Dockhead,
  also, to my knowledge, pass at no great distance from the black-lead works of
  Pearce Duff &amp; Co. in Rouel Road, and will probably collect a few
  particles of black-lead on the seats in certain states of the wind. I see,
  too, that there is a cocoa factory&mdash;Payne's&mdash;in Goat Street,
  Horsleydown, which lies to the right of the tram line going west, and I have
  noticed several hop warehouses on the right side of Southwark Street, going
  west. But these are mere suggestions; the really important data are the rice
  and flour mills and the spice-grinders, which seem to point unmistakably to
  Dockhead."</p>

  <p>"Are there any private houses at Dockhead?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"We must look up the 'Street' list," he replied. "The Yale latch-key
  rather suggests a flat, and a flat with a single occupant, and the probable
  habits of our absent friend offer a similar suggestion." He ran his eye down
  the list and presently turned to me with his finger on the page.</p>

  <p>"If the facts that we have elicited&mdash;the singular series of
  agreements with the required conditions&mdash;are only a string of
  coincidences, here is another. On the south side of Dockhead, actually next
  door to the spice-grinders and opposite to Carbutt's rice-mills, is a block
  of workmen's flats, Hanover Buildings. They fulfil the conditions exactly. A
  coat hung in a room in those flats, with the windows open (as they would
  probably be at this time of year), would be exposed to the air containing a
  composite dust of precisely the character of that which we have found. Of
  course, the same conditions obtain in other dwellings in this part of
  Dockhead, but the probability is in favour of the buildings. And that is all
  that we can say. It is no certainty. There may be some radical fallacy in our
  reasoning. But, on the face of it, the chances are a thousand to one that the
  door that that key will open is in some part of Dockhead, and most probably
  in Hanover Buildings. We must leave the verification to Miller."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be as well to look at the tram-ticket?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" he exclaimed. "I had forgotten the ticket. Yes, by all means."
  He opened the envelope and, turning its contents out on the bench, picked up
  the dingy slip of paper. After a glance at it he handed it to me. It was
  punched for the journey from Tooley Street to Dockhead.</p>

  <p>"Another coincidence," he remarked; "and by yet another, I think I hear
  Miller knocking at our door."</p>

  <p>It was the superintendent, and, as we let him into the room, the hum of a
  motor-car entering from Tudor Street announced the arrival of Mrs. Chater. We
  waited for her at the open door, and, as she entered, she held out her hands
  impulsively.</p>

  <p>"Say, now, Dr. Thorndyke," she exclaimed, "have you gotten something to
  tell us?"</p>

  <p>"I have a suggestion to make," replied Thorndyke. "I think that if the
  superintendent will take this key to Hanover Buildings, Dockhead, Bermondsey,
  he may possibly find a door that it will fit."</p>

  <p>"The deuce!" exclaimed Miller. "I beg your pardon, madam; but I thought I
  had gone through that coat pretty completely. What was it that I had
  overlooked, sir? Was there a letter hidden in it, after all?"</p>

  <p>"You overlooked the dust on it, Miller; that is all," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Dust!" exclaimed the detective, staring round-eyed at my colleague. Then
  he chuckled softly. "Well," said he, "as I said before, I'm not a sorcerer;
  I'm only a policeman." He picked up the key and asked: "Are you coming to see
  the end of it, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he is coming," said Mrs. Chater, "and Dr. Jervis too, to
  identify the man. Now that we have gotten the villain we must leave him no
  loophole for escape."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled dryly. "We will come if you wish it, Mrs. Chater," he
  said, "but you mustn't look upon our quest as a certainty. We may have made
  an entire miscalculation, and I am, in fact, rather curious to see if the
  result works out correctly. But even if we run the man to earth, I don't see
  that you have much evidence against him. The most that you can prove is that
  he was at the house and that he left hurriedly."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Chater regarded my colleague for a moment in scornful silence, and
  then, gathering up her skirts, stalked out of the room. If there is one thing
  that the average woman detests more than another, it is an entirely
  reasonable man.</p>

  <p>The big car whirled us rapidly over Blackfriars Bridge into the region of
  the Borough, whence we presently turned down Tooley Street towards
  Bermondsey.</p>

  <p>As soon as Dockhead came into view, the detective, Thorndyke and I,
  alighted and proceeded on foot, leaving our client, who was now closely
  veiled, to follow at a little distance in the car. Opposite the head of St.
  Saviour's Dock, Thorndyke halted and, looking over the wall, drew my
  attention to the snowy powder that had lodged on every projection on the
  backs of the tall buildings and on the decks of the barges that were loading
  with the flour and ground rice. Then, crossing the road, he pointed to the
  wooden lantern above the roof of the spice works, the louvres of which were
  covered with greyish-buff dust.</p>

  <p>"Thus," he moralized, "does commerce subserve the ends of justice&mdash;at
  least, we hope it does," he added quickly, as Miller disappeared into the
  semi-basement of the buildings.</p>

  <p>We met the detective returning from his quest as we entered the
  building.</p>

  <p>"No go there," was his report. "We'll try the next floor."</p>

  <p>This was the ground-floor, or it might be considered the first floor. At
  any rate, it yielded nothing of interest, and, after a glance at the doors
  that opened on the landing, he strode briskly up the stone stairs. The next
  floor was equally unrewarding, for our eager inspection disclosed nothing but
  the gaping keyhole associated with the common type of night-latch.</p>

  <p>"What name was you wanting?" inquired a dusty knight of industry who
  emerged from one of the flats.</p>

  <p>"Muggs," replied Miller, with admirable promptness.</p>

  <p>"Don't know 'im," said the workman. "I expect it's farther up."</p>

  <p>Farther up we accordingly went, but still from each door the artless grin
  of the invariable keyhole saluted us with depressing monotony. I began to
  grow uneasy, and when the fourth floor had been explored with no better
  result, my anxiety became acute. A mare's nest may be an interesting
  curiosity, but it brings no kudos to its discoverer.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you haven't made any mistake, sir?" said Miller, stopping to
  wipe his brow.</p>

  <p>"It's quite likely that I have." replied Thorndyke, with unmoved
  composure. "I only proposed this search as a tentative proceeding, you
  know."</p>

  <p>The superintendent grunted. He was accustomed&mdash;as was I too, for that
  matter&mdash;to regard Thorndyke's "tentative suggestions" as equal to
  another man's certainties.</p>

  <p>"It will be an awful suck-in for Mrs. Chater if we don't find him after
  all," he growled as we climbed up the last flight. "She's counted her
  chickens to a feather." He paused at the head of the stairs and stood for a
  few moments looking round the landing. Suddenly he turned eagerly, and,
  laying his hand on Thorndyke's arm, pointed to a door in the farthest
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Yale lock!" he whispered impressively.</p>

  <p>We followed him silently as he stole on tip-toe across the landing, and
  watched him as he stood for an instant with the key in his land looking
  gloatingly at the brass disc. We saw him softly apply the nose of the fluted
  key-blade to the crooked slit in the cylinder, and, as we watched, it slid
  noiselessly up to the shoulder. The detective looked round with a grin of
  triumph, and, silently withdrawing the key, stepped back to us.</p>

  <p>"You've run him to earth, sir," he whispered, "but I don't think Mr. Fox
  is at home. He can't have got back yet."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Miller waved his hand towards the door. "Nothing has been disturbed," he
  replied. "There's not a mark on the paint. Now he hadn't got the key, and you
  can't pick a Yale lock. He'd have had to break in, and he hasn't broken
  in."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke stepped up to the door and softly pushed in the flap of the
  letter-slit, through which he looked into the flat.</p>

  <p>"There's no letter-box," said he. "My dear Miller, I would undertake to
  open that door in five minutes with a foot of wire and a bit of resined
  string."</p>

  <p>Miller shook his head and grinned once more. "I am glad you're not on the
  lay, sir; you'd be one too many for us. Shall we signal to the lady?"</p>

  <p>I went out onto the gallery and looked down at the waiting car. Mrs.
  Chater was staring intently up at the building, and the little crowd that the
  car had collected stared alternately at the lady and at the object of her
  regard. I wiped my face with my handkerchief&mdash;the signal agreed
  upon&mdash;and she instantly sprang out of the car, and in an incredibly
  short time she appeared on the landing, purple and gasping, but with the fire
  of battle flashing from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"We've found his flat, madam," said Miller, "and we're going to enter.
  You're not intending to offer any violence, I hope," he added, noting with
  some uneasiness the lady's ferocious expression.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm not," replied Mrs. Chater. "In the States ladies don't have
  to avenge insults themselves. If you were American men you'd hang the ruffian
  from his own bedpost."</p>

  <p>"We're not American men, madam," said the superintendent stiffly. "We are
  law-abiding Englishmen, and, moreover, we are all officers of the law. These
  gentlemen are barristers and I am a police officer."</p>

  <p>With this preliminary caution, he once more inserted the key, and as he
  turned it and pushed the door open, we all followed him into the
  sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"I told you so, sir," said Miller, softly shutting the door; "he hasn't
  come back yet."</p>

  <p>Apparently he was right. At any rate, there was no one in the flat, and we
  proceeded unopposed on our tour of inspection. It was a miserable spectacle,
  and, as we wandered from one squalid room to another, a feeling of pity for
  the starving wretch into whose lair we were intruding stole over me and began
  almost to mitigate the hideousness of his crime. On all sides
  poverty&mdash;utter, grinding poverty&mdash;stared us in the face. It looked
  at us hollow-eyed in the wretched sitting-room, with its bare floor, its
  solitary chair and tiny deal table; its unfurnished walls and windows
  destitute of blind or curtain. A piece of Dutch cheese-rind on the table,
  scraped to the thinness of paper, whispered of starvation; and famine lurked
  in the gaping cupboard, in the empty bread-tin, in the tea-caddy with its
  pinch of dust at the bottom, in the jam-jar, wiped clean, as a few crumbs
  testified, with a crust of bread. There was not enough food in the place to
  furnish a meal for a healthy mouse.</p>

  <p>The bedroom told the same tale, but with a curious variation. A miserable
  truckle-bed with a straw mattress and a cheap jute rug for bed-clothes, an
  orange-case, stood on end, for a dressing-table, and another, bearing a tin
  washing-bowl, formed the wretched furniture. But the suit that hung from a
  couple of nails was well-cut and even fashionable, though shabby; and another
  suit lay on the floor, neatly folded and covered with a newspaper; and, most
  incongruous of all, a silver cigarette-case reposed on the
  dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth does this fellow starve," I exclaimed, "when he has a silver
  case to pawn?"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't do," said Miller. "A man doesn't pawn the implements of his
  trade."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Chater, who had been staring about her with the mute amazement of a
  wealthy woman confronted, for the first time, with abject poverty, turned
  suddenly to the superintendent. "This can't be the man!" she exclaimed. "You
  have made some mistake. This poor creature could never have made his way into
  a house like Willowdale."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke lifted the newspaper. Beneath it was a dress suit with the
  shirt, collar and tie all carefully smoothed out and folded. Thorndyke
  unfolded the shirt and pointed to the curiously crumpled front. Suddenly he
  brought it close to his eye and then, from the sham diamond stud, he drew a
  single hair&mdash;a woman's hair.</p>

  <p>"That is rather significant," said he, holding it up between his finger
  and thumb; and Mrs. Chater evidently thought so too, for the pity and
  compunction suddenly faded from her face, and once more her eyes flashed with
  vindictive fire.</p>

  <p>"I wish he would come," she exclaimed viciously. "Prison won't be much
  hardship to him after this, but I want to see him in the dock all the
  same."</p>

  <p>"No," the detective agreed, "it won't hurt him much to swap this for
  Portland. Listen!"</p>

  <p>A key was being inserted into the outer door, and as we all stood like
  statues, a man entered and closed the door after him. He passed the door of
  the bedroom without seeing us, and with the dragging steps of a weary,
  dispirited man. Almost immediately we heard him go to the kitchen and draw
  water into some vessel. Then he went back to the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Come along," said Miller, stepping silently towards the door. We followed
  closely, and as he threw the door open, we looked in over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The man had seated himself at the table, on which now lay a hunk of
  household bread resting on the paper in which he had brought it, and a
  tumbler of water. He half rose as the door opened, and as if petrified
  remained staring at Miller with a dreadful expression of terror upon his
  livid face.</p>

  <p>At this moment I felt a hand on my arm, and Mrs. Chater brusquely pushed
  past me into the room. But at the threshold she stopped short; and a singular
  change crept over the man's ghastly face, a change so remarkable that I
  looked involuntarily from him to our client. She had turned, in a moment,
  deadly pale, and her face had frozen into an expression of incredulous
  horror.</p>

  <p>The dramatic silence was broken by the matter-of-fact voice of the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"I am a police officer," said he, "and I arrest you for&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>A peal of hysterical laughter from Mrs. Chater interrupted him, and he
  looked at her in astonishment. "Stop, stop!" she cried in a shaky voice. "I
  guess we've made a ridiculous mistake. This isn't the man. This gentleman is
  Captain Rowland, an old friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry he's a friend of yours," said Miller, "because I shall have to
  ask you to appear against him."</p>

  <p>"You can ask what you please," replied Mrs. Chater. "I tell you he's not
  the man."</p>

  <p>The superintendent rubbed his nose and looked hungrily at his quarry. "Do
  I understand, madam," he asked stiffly, "that you refuse to prosecute?"</p>

  <p>"Prosecute!" she exclaimed. "Prosecute my friends for offences that I know
  they have not committed? Certainly I refuse."</p>

  <p>The superintendent looked at Thorndyke, but my colleague's countenance had
  congealed into a state of absolute immobility and was as devoid of expression
  as the face of a Dutch clock.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miller, looking sourly at his watch. "Then we have had
  our trouble for nothing. I wish you good afternoon, madam."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry I troubled you, now," said Mrs. Chater.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you did," was the curt reply; and the superintendent, flinging
  the key on the table, stalked out of the room.</p>

  <p>As the outer door slammed the man sat down with an air of bewilderment;
  and then, suddenly flinging his arms on the table, he dropped his head on
  them and burst into a passion of sobbing.</p>

  <p>It was very embarrassing. With one accord Thorndyke and I turned to go,
  but Mrs. Chater motioned us to stay. Stepping over to the man, she touched
  him lightly on the arm.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it?" she asked in a tone of gentle reproach.</p>

  <p>The man sat up and flung out one arm in an eloquent gesture that
  comprehended the miserable room and the yawning cupboard.</p>

  <p>"It was the temptation of a moment," he said. "I was penniless, and those
  accursed diamonds were thrust in my face; they were mine for the taking. I
  was mad, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"But why didn't you take them?" she said. "Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The madness passed; and then&mdash;when I saw you lying
  there&mdash;? Oh, God! Why don't you give me up to the police?" He laid his
  head down and sobbed afresh.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Chater bent over him with tears standing in her pretty grey eyes.
  "But tell me," she said, "why didn't you take the diamonds? You could if
  you'd liked, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"What good were they to me?" he demanded passionately. "What did anything
  matter to me? I thought you were dead."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not, you see," she said, with a rather tearful smile; "I'm just
  as well as an old woman like me can expect to be. And I want your address, so
  that I can write and give you some good advice."</p>

  <p>The man sat up and produced a shabby cardcase from his pocket, and, as he
  took out a number of cards and spread them out like the "hand" of a whist
  player, I caught a twinkle in Thorndyke's eye.</p>

  <p>"My name is Augustus Bailey," said the man. He selected the appropriate
  card, and, having scribbled his address on it with a stump of lead pencil,
  relapsed into his former position.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mrs. Chater, lingering for a moment by the table. "Now
  we'll go. Good-bye, Mr. Bailey. I shall write to-morrow, and you must attend
  seriously to the advice of an old friend."</p>

  <p>I held open the door for her to pass out and looked back before I turned
  to follow. Bailey still sat sobbing quietly, with his hand resting on his
  arms; and a little pile of gold stood on the corner of the table.</p>

  <p>"I expect, doctor," said Mrs. Chater, as Thorndyke handed her into the
  car, "you've written me down a sentimental fool."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at her with an unwonted softening of his rather severe
  face and answered quietly, "It is written: Blessed are the Merciful."</p>

  <h2><a name="c6"
     id="c6"></a>V. &mdash; THE OLD LAG</h2>

  <h3>PART I. &mdash; THE CHANGED IMMUTABLE</h3>

  <p class="first">AMONG the minor and purely physical pleasures of life, I am
  disposed to rank very highly that feeling of bodily comfort that one
  experiences on passing from the outer darkness of a wet winter's night to a
  cheerful interior made glad by mellow lamplight and blazing hearth. And so I
  thought when, on a dreary November night, I let myself into our chambers in
  the Temple and found my friend smoking his pipe in slippered ease, by a
  roaring fire, and facing an empty arm-chair evidently placed in readiness for
  me.</p>

  <p>As I shed my damp overcoat, I glanced inquisitively at my colleague, for
  he held in his hand an open letter, and I seemed to perceive in his aspect
  something meditative and self-communing&mdash;something, in short, suggestive
  of a new case.</p>

  <p>"I was just considering," he said, in answer to my inquiring look,
  "whether I am about to become an accessory after the fact. Read that and give
  me your opinion."</p>

  <p>He handed me the letter, which I read aloud.</p>
<br>

  <p class="letter">"Dear sir,&mdash;I am in great danger and distress. A warrant has been
  issued for my arrest on a charge of which I am entirely innocent. Can I come
  and see you, and will you let me leave in safety? The bearer will wait for a
  reply."</p>
<br>

  <p>"I said 'Yes,' of course; there was nothing else to do," said Thorndyke.
  "But if I let him go, as I have promised to do, I shall be virtually
  conniving at his escape."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are taking a risk," I answered. "When is he coming?"</p>

  <p>"He was due five minutes ago&mdash;and I rather think&mdash;yes, here he
  is."</p>

  <p>A stealthy tread on the landing was followed by a soft tapping on the
  outer door.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke rose and, flinging open the inner door, unfastened the massive
  "oak."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Thorndyke?" inquired a breathless, quavering voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, come in. You sent me a letter by hand?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir," was the reply; and the speaker entered, but at the sight of
  me he stopped short.</p>

  <p>"This is my colleague, Dr. Jervis," Thorndyke explained. "You need have
  no&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember him," our visitor interrupted in a tone of relief. "I have
  seen you both before, you know, and you have seen me too&mdash;though I don't
  suppose you recognize me," he added, with: a sickly smile.</p>

  <p>"Frank Belfield?" asked Thorndyke, smiling also.</p>

  <p>Our visitor's jaw fell and he gazed at my colleague in sudden dismay.</p>

  <p>"And I may remark," pursued Thorndyke, "that for a man in your perilous
  position, you are running most unnecessary risks. That wig, that false beard
  and those spectacles&mdash;through which you obviously cannot see&mdash;are
  enough to bring the entire police force at your heels. It is not wise for a
  man who is wanted by the police to make up as though he had just escaped from
  a comic opera."</p>

  <p>Mr. Belfield seated himself with a groan, and, taking off his spectacles,
  stared stupidly from one of us to the other.</p>

  <p>"And now tell us about your little affair," said Thorndyke. "You say that
  you are innocent?"</p>

  <p>"I swear it, doctor," replied Belfield; adding, with great earnestness,
  "And you may take it from me, sir, that if I was not, I shouldn't be here. It
  was you that convicted me last time, when I thought myself quite safe, so I
  know your ways too well to try to gammon you."</p>

  <p>"If you are innocent," rejoined Thorndyke, "I will do what I can for you;
  and if you are not&mdash;well, you would have been wiser to stay away."</p>

  <p>"I know that well enough," said Belfield, "and I am only afraid that you
  won't believe what I am going to tell you."</p>

  <p>"I shall keep an open mind, at any rate," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"If you only will," groaned Belfield, "I shall have a look in, in spite of
  them all. You know, sir, that I have been on the crook, but I have paid in
  full. That job when you tripped me up was the last of it&mdash;it was, sir,
  so help me. It was a woman that changed me&mdash;the best and truest woman on
  God's earth. She said she would marry me when I came out if I promised her to
  go straight and live an honest life. And she kept her promise&mdash;and I
  have kept mine. She found me work as clerk in a warehouse and I have stuck to
  it ever since, earning fair wages and building up a good character as an
  honest, industrious man. I thought all was going well, and that I was settled
  for life, when only this very morning the whole thing comes tumbling about my
  ears like a house of cards."</p>

  <p>"What happened this morning, then?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Why, I was on my way to work when, as I passed the police station, I
  noticed a bill with the heading 'Wanted' and a photograph. I stopped for a
  moment to look at it, and you may imagine my feelings when I recognized my
  own portrait&mdash;taken at Holloway&mdash;and read my own name and
  description. I did not stop to read the bill through, but ran back home and
  told my wife, and she ran down to the station and read the bill carefully.
  Good God, sir! What do you think I am wanted for?" He paused for a moment,
  and then replied in breathless tones to his own question: "The Camberwell
  murder!"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke gave a low whistle.</p>

  <p>"My wife knows I didn't do it," continued Belfield, "because I was at home
  all the evening and night; but what use is a man's wife to prove an
  alibi?"</p>

  <p>"Not much, I fear," Thorndyke admitted; "and you have no other
  witness?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul. We were alone all the evening."</p>

  <p>"However," said Thorndyke, "if you are innocent&mdash;as I am
  assuming&mdash;the evidence against you must be entirely circumstantial and
  your alibi may be quite sufficient. Have you any idea of the grounds of
  suspicion against you?"</p>

  <p>"Not the faintest. The papers said that the police had an excellent clue,
  but they did not say what it was. Probably someone has given false
  information for the&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>A sharp rapping at the outer door cut short the explanation, and our
  visitor rose, trembling and aghast, with beads of sweat standing upon his
  livid face.</p>

  <p>"You had better go into the office, Belfield, while we see who it is,"
  said Thorndyke. "The key is on the inside."</p>

  <p>The fugitive wanted no second bidding, but hurried into the empty
  apartment, and, as the door closed, we heard the key turn in the lock.</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke threw open the outer door, he cast a meaning glance at me
  over his shoulder which I understood when the newcomer entered the room; for
  it was none other than Superintendent Miller of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"I have just dropped in," said the superintendent, in his brisk, cheerful
  way, "to ask you to do me a favour. Good-evening, Dr. Jervis. I hear you are
  reading for the bar; learned counsel soon, sir, hey? Medico-legal expert. Dr.
  Thorndyke's mantle going to fall on you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I hope Dr. Thorndyke's mantle will continue to drape his own majestic
  form for many a long year yet," I answered; "though he is good enough to
  spare me a corner&mdash;but what on earth have you got there?" For during
  this dialogue the superintendent had been deftly unfastening a brown-paper
  parcel, from which he now drew a linen shirt, once white, but now of an
  unsavoury grey.</p>

  <p>"I want to know what this is," said Miller, exhibiting a brownish-red
  stain on one sleeve. "Just look at that, sir, and tell me if it is blood,
  and, if so, is it human blood?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Miller," said Thorndyke, with a smile, "you flatter me; but I am
  not like the wise woman of Bagdad who could tell you how many stairs the
  patient had tumbled down by merely looking at his tongue. I must examine this
  very thoroughly. When do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to know to-night," replied the detective.</p>

  <p>"Can I cut a piece out to put under the microscope?"</p>

  <p>"I would rather you did not," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Very well; you shall have the information in about an hour."</p>

  <p>"It's very good of you, doctor," said the detective; and he was taking up
  his hat preparatory to departing, when Thorndyke said suddenly&mdash;"By the
  way, there is a little matter that I was going to speak to you about. It
  refers to this Camberwell murder case. I understand you have a clue to the
  identity of the murderer?"</p>

  <p>"Clue!" exclaimed the superintendent contemptuously. "We have spotted our
  man all right, if we could only lay hands on him; but he has given us the
  slip for the moment."</p>

  <p>"Who is the man?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The detective looked doubtfully at Thorndyke for some seconds and then
  said, with evident reluctance: "I suppose there is no harm in telling
  you&mdash;especially as you probably know already"&mdash;this with a sly
  grin; "it's an old crook named Belfield."</p>

  <p>"And what is the evidence against him?"</p>

  <p>Again the superintendent looked doubtful and again relented.</p>

  <p>"Why, the case is as clear as&mdash;as cold Scotch," he said (here
  Thorndyke in illustration of this figure of speech produced a decanter, a
  syphon and a tumbler, which he pushed towards the officer). "You see, sir,
  the silly fool went and stuck his sweaty hand on the window; and there we
  found the marks&mdash;four fingers and a thumb, as beautiful prints as you
  could wish to see. Of course we cut out the piece of glass and took it up to
  the Finger-print Department; they turned up their files and out came Mr.
  Belfield's record, with his finger-prints and photograph all complete."</p>

  <p>"And the finger-prints on the window-pane were identical with those on the
  prison form?"</p>

  <p>"Identical."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" Thorndyke reflected for a while, and the superintendent watched him
  foxily over the edge of his tumbler.</p>

  <p>"I guess you are retained to defend Belfield," the latter observed
  presently.</p>

  <p>"To look into the case generally," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"And I expect you know where the beggar is hiding," continued the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"Belfield's address has not yet been communicated to me," said Thorndyke.
  "I am merely to investigate the case&mdash;and there is no reason, Miller,
  why you and I should be at cross purposes. We are both working at the case;
  you want to get a conviction and you want to convict the right man."</p>

  <p>"That's so&mdash;and Belfield's the right man&mdash;but what do you want
  of us, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to see the piece of glass with the finger-prints on it, and
  the prison form, and take a photograph of each. And I should like to examine
  the room in which the murder took place&mdash;you have it locked up, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we have the keys. Well, it's all rather irregular, letting you see
  the things. Still, you've always played the game fairly with us, so we might
  stretch a point. Yes, I will. I'll come back in an hour for your report and
  bring the glass and the form. I can't let them go out of my custody, you
  know. I'll be off now&mdash;no, thank you, not another drop."</p>

  <p>The superintendent caught up his hat and strode away, the personification
  of mental alertness and bodily vigour.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the door closed behind him than Thorndyke's stolid calm
  changed instantaneously into feverish energy. Darting to the electric bell
  that rang into the laboratories above, he pressed the button while he gave me
  my directions.</p>

  <p>"Have a look at that blood-stain, Jervis, while I am finishing with
  Belfield. Don't wet it; scrape it into a drop of warm normal saline
  solution."</p>

  <p>I hastened to reach down the microscope and set out on the table the
  necessary apparatus and reagents, and, as I was thus occupied, a latch-key
  turned in the outer door and our invaluable helpmate, Polton, entered the
  room in his habitual silent, unobtrusive fashion.</p>

  <p>"Let me have the finger-print apparatus, please, Polton," said Thorndyke;
  "and have the copying camera ready by nine o'clock. I am expecting Mr. Miller
  with some documents."</p>

  <p>As his laboratory assistant departed, Thorndyke rapped at the office
  door.</p>

  <p>"It's all clear, Belfield," he called; "you can come out."</p>

  <p>The key turned and the prisoner emerged, looking ludicrously woebegone in
  his ridiculous wig and beard.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take your finger-prints, to compare with some that the
  police found on the window."</p>

  <p>"Finger-prints!" exclaimed Belfield, in a tone of dismay. "They don't say
  they're my finger-prints, do they, sir?"</p>

  <p>"They do indeed," replied Thorndyke, eyeing the man narrowly. "They have
  compared them with those taken when you were at Holloway, and they say that
  they are identical."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" murmured Belfield, collapsing into a chair, faint and
  trembling. "They must have made some awful mistake. But are mistakes possible
  with finger-prints?"</p>

  <p>"Now look here, Belfield," said Thorndyke. "Were you in that house that
  night, or were you not? It is of no use for you to tell me any lies."</p>

  <p>"I was not there, sir; I swear to God I was not."</p>

  <p>"Then they cannot be your finger-prints, that is obvious." Here he stepped
  to the door to intercept Polton, from whom he received a substantial box,
  which he brought in and placed on the table.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all you know about this case," he continued, as he set out the
  contents of the box on the table.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about it whatever," replied Belfield; "nothing, at least,
  except&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Except what?" demanded Thorndyke, looking up sharply as he squeezed a
  drop from a tube of finger-print ink onto a smooth copper plate.</p>

  <p>"Except that the murdered man, Caldwell, was a retired fence."</p>

  <p>"A fence, was he?" said Thorndyke in a tone of interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes; and I suspect he was a 'nark' too. He knew more than was wholesome
  for a good many."</p>

  <p>"Did he know anything about you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but nothing that the police don't know."</p>

  <p>With a small roller Thorndyke spread the ink upon the plate into a thin
  film. Then he laid on the edge of the table a smooth white card and, taking
  Belfield's right hand, pressed the forefinger firmly but quickly, first on
  the inked plate and then on the card, leaving on the latter a clear print of
  the finger-tip. This process he repeated with the other fingers and thumb,
  and then took several additional prints of each.</p>

  <p>"That was a nasty injury to your forefinger, Belfield," said Thorndyke,
  holding the finger to the light and examining the tip carefully. "How did you
  do it?"</p>

  <p>"Stuck a tin-opener into it&mdash;a dirty one, too. It was bad for weeks;
  in fact, Dr. Sampson thought at one time that he would have to amputate the
  finger."</p>

  <p>"How long ago was that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nearly a year ago, sir."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke wrote the date of the injury by the side of the finger-print and
  then, having rolled up the inking plate afresh, laid on the table several
  larger cards. "I am now going to take the prints of the four fingers and the
  thumb all at once," he said.</p>

  <p>"They only took the four fingers at once at the prison," said Belfield.
  "They took the thumb separately."</p>

  <p>"I know," replied Thorndyke; "but I am going to take the impression just
  as it would appear on the window glass."</p>

  <p>He took several impressions thus, and then, having looked at his watch, he
  began to repack the apparatus in its box. While doing this, he glanced, from
  time to time, in meditative fashion, at the suspected man who sat, the living
  picture of misery and terror, wiping the greasy ink from his trembling
  fingers with his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Belfield," he said at length, "you have sworn to me that you are an
  innocent man and are trying to live an honest life. I believe you; but in a
  few minutes I shall know for certain."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that, sir," exclaimed Belfield, brightening up
  wonderfully.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Thorndyke, "you had better go back into the office, for I
  am expecting Superintendent Miller, and he may be here at any moment."</p>

  <p>Belfield hastily slunk back into the office, locking the door after him,
  and Thorndyke, having returned the box to the laboratory and deposited the
  cards bearing the finger-prints in a drawer, came round to inspect my work. I
  had managed to detach a tiny fragment of dried clot from the blood-stained
  garment, and this, in a drop of normal saline solution, I now had under the
  microscope.</p>

  <p>"What do you make out, Jervis?" my colleague asked.</p>

  <p>"Oval corpuscles with distinct nuclei," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Thorndyke, "that will be good hearing for some poor devil. Have
  you measured them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Long diameter one twenty-one hundredth of an inch; short diameter
  about one thirty-four hundredth of an inch."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reached down an indexed note-book from a shelf of reference
  volumes and consulted a table of histological measurements.</p>

  <p>"That would seem to be the blood of a pheasant, then, or it might, more
  probably, be that of a common fowl." He applied his eye to the microscope
  and, fitting in the eyepiece micrometer, verified my measurements. He was
  thus employed when a sharp tap was heard on the outer door, and rising to
  open it he admitted the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"I see you are at work on my little problem, doctor," said the latter,
  glancing at the microscope. "What do you make of that stain?"</p>

  <p>"It is the blood of a bird&mdash;probably a pheasant, or perhaps a common
  fowl."</p>

  <p>The superintendent slapped his thigh. "Well, I'm hanged!" he exclaimed.
  "You're a regular wizard, doctor, that's what you are. The fellow said he got
  that stain through handling a wounded pheasant and here are you able to tell
  us yes or no without a hint from us to help you. Well, you've done my little
  job for me, sir, and I'm much obliged to you; now I'll carry out my part of
  the bargain." He opened a hand-bag and drew forth a wooden frame and a blue
  foolscap envelope and laid them with extreme care on the table.</p>

  <p>"There you are, sir," said he, pointing to the frame; "you will find Mr.
  Belfield's trade-mark very neatly executed, and in the envelope is the
  finger-print sheet for comparison."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke took up the frame and examined it. It enclosed two sheets of
  glass, one being the portion of the window-pane and the other a cover-glass
  to protect the fingerprints. Laying a sheet of white paper on the table,
  where the light was strongest, Thorndyke held the frame over it and gazed at
  the glass in silence, but with that faint lighting up of his impassive face
  which I knew so well and which meant so much to me. I walked round, and
  looking over his shoulder saw upon the glass the beautifully distinct
  imprints of four fingers and a thumb&mdash;the finger-tips, in fact, of an
  open hand.</p>

  <p>After regarding the frame attentively for some time, Thorndyke produced
  from his pocket a little wash-leather bag, from which he extracted a powerful
  doublet lens, and with the aid of this he again explored the finger-prints,
  dwelling especially upon the print of the forefinger.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you will find much amiss with those finger-prints, doctor,"
  said the superintendent, "they are as clear as if he made them on
  purpose."</p>

  <p>"They are indeed," replied Thorndyke, with an inscrutable smile, "exactly
  as if he had made them on purpose. And how beautifully clean the glass
  is&mdash;as if he had polished it before making the impression."</p>

  <p>The superintendent glanced at Thorndyke with quick suspicion; but the
  smile had faded and given place to a wooden immobility from which nothing
  could be gleaned.</p>

  <p>When he had examined the glass exhaustively, Thorndyke drew the
  finger-print form from its envelope and scanned it quickly, glancing
  repeatedly from the paper to the glass and from the glass to the paper. At
  length he laid them both on the table, and turning to the detective looked
  him steadily in the face.</p>

  <p>"I think, Miller," said he, "that I can give you a hint."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir? And what might that be?"</p>

  <p>"It is this: you are after the wrong man."</p>

  <p>The superintendent snorted&mdash;not a loud snort, for that would have
  been rude, and no officer could be more polite than Superintendent Miller.
  But it conveyed a protest which he speedily followed up in words.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say that the prints on that glass are not the
  finger-prints of Frank Belfield?"</p>

  <p>"I say that those prints were not made by Frank Belfield," Thorndyke
  replied firmly.</p>

  <p>"Do you admit, sir, that the finger-prints on the official form were made
  by him?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that they were."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, Mr. Singleton, of the Finger-print Department, has compared
  the prints on the glass with those on the form and he says they are
  identical; and I have examined them and I say they are identical."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke; "and I have examined them and I say they are
  identical&mdash;and that therefore those on the glass cannot have been made
  by Belfield."</p>

  <p>The superintendent snorted again&mdash;somewhat louder this time&mdash;and
  gazed at Thorndyke with wrinkled brows.</p>

  <p>"You are not pulling my leg, I suppose, sir?" he asked, a little
  sourly.</p>

  <p>"I should as soon think of tickling a porcupine," Thorndyke answered, with
  a suave smile.</p>

  <p>"Well," rejoined the bewildered detective, "if I didn't know you, sir, I
  should say you were talking confounded nonsense. Perhaps you wouldn't mind
  explaining what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Supposing," said Thorndyke, "I make it clear to you that those prints on
  the window-pane were not made by Belfield. Would you still execute the
  warrant?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" exclaimed Miller. "Do you suppose we should go into
  court to have you come and knock the bottom out of our case, like you did in
  that Hornby affair? By the way, that was a finger-print case too, now I come
  to think of it," and the superintendent suddenly became thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"You have often complained," pursued Thorndyke, "that I have withheld
  information from you and sprung unexpected evidence on you at the trial. Now
  I am going to take you into my confidence, and when I have proved to you that
  this clue of yours is a false one, I shall expect you to let this poor devil
  Belfield go his way in peace."</p>

  <p>The superintendent grunted&mdash;a form of utterance that committed him to
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"These prints," continued Thorndyke, taking up the frame once more,
  "present several features of interest, one of which, at least, ought not to
  have escaped you and Mr. Singleton, as it seems to have done. Just look at
  that thumb."</p>

  <p>The superintendent did so, and then pored over the official paper.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I don't see anything the matter with it. It's exactly
  like the print on the paper."</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," rejoined Thorndyke, "and that is just the point. It
  ought not to be. The print of the thumb on the paper was taken separately
  from the fingers. And why? Because it was impossible to take it at the same
  time. The thumb is in a different plane from the fingers; when the hand is
  laid flat on any surface&mdash;as this window-pane, for instance&mdash;the
  palmar surfaces of the fingers touch it, whereas it is the side of the thumb
  which comes in contact and not the palmar surface. But in this"&mdash;he
  tapped the framed glass with his finger&mdash;"the prints show the palmar
  surfaces of all the five digits in contact at once, which is an
  impossibility. Just try to put your own thumb in that position and you will
  see that it is so."</p>

  <p>The detective spread out his hand on the table and immediately perceived
  the truth of my colleague's statement.</p>

  <p>"And what does that prove?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It proves that the thumb-print on the window-pane was not made at the
  same time as the finger-prints&mdash;that it was added separately; and that
  fact seems to prove that the prints were not made accidentally, but&mdash;as
  you ingeniously suggested just now&mdash;were put there for a purpose."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see the drift of all this," said the superintendent,
  rubbing the back of his head perplexedly; "and you said a while back that the
  prints on the glass can't be Belfield's because they are identical with the
  prints on the form. Now that seems to me sheer nonsense, if you will excuse
  my saying so."</p>

  <p>"And yet," replied Thorndyke, "it is the actual fact. Listen: these
  prints"&mdash;here he took up the official sheet&mdash;"were taken at
  Holloway six years ago. These"&mdash;pointing to the framed glass&mdash;"were
  made within the present week. The one is, as regards the ridge-pattern, a
  perfect duplicate of the other. Is that not so?"</p>

  <p>"That is so, doctor," agreed the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now suppose I were to tell you that within the last twelve
  months something had happened to Belfield that made an appreciable change in
  the ridge-pattern on one of his fingers?"</p>

  <p>"But is such a thing possible?"</p>

  <p>"It is not only possible but it has happened. I will show you."</p>

  <p>He brought forth from the drawer the cards on which Belfield had made his
  finger-prints, and laid them before the detective.</p>

  <p>"Observe the prints of the forefinger," he said, indicating them; "there
  are a dozen, in all, and you will notice in each a white line crossing the
  ridges and dividing them. That line is caused by a scar, which has destroyed
  a portion of the ridges, and is now an integral part of Belfield's
  finger-print. And since no such blank line is to be seen in this print on the
  glass&mdash;in which the ridges appear perfect, as they were before the
  injury&mdash;it follows that that print could not have been made by
  Belfield's finger."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about the injury, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. There is the scar to prove it, and I can produce the
  surgeon who attended Belfield at the time."</p>

  <p>The officer rubbed his head harder than before, and regarded Thorndyke
  with puckered brows.</p>

  <p>"This is a teaser," he growled, "it is indeed. What you say, sir, seems
  perfectly sound, and yet&mdash;there are those finger-prints on the
  window-glass. Now you can't get fingerprints without fingers, can you?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly you can," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I should want to see that done before I could believe even you, sir,"
  said Miller.</p>

  <p>"You shall see it done now," was the calm rejoinder. "You have evidently
  forgotten the Hornby case&mdash;the case of the Red Thumb-mark, as the
  newspapers called it."</p>

  <p>"I only heard part of it," replied Miller, "and I didn't really follow the
  evidence in that."</p>

  <p>"Well, I will show you a relic of that case," said Thorndyke. He unlocked
  a cabinet and took from one of the shelves a small box labelled "Hornby,"
  which, being opened, was seen to contain a folded paper, a little red-covered
  oblong book and what looked like a large boxwood pawn.</p>

  <p>"This little book," Thorndyke continued, "is a 'thumb-ograph'&mdash;a sort
  of finger-print album&mdash;I dare say you know the kind of thing."</p>

  <p>The superintendent nodded contemptuously at the little volume.</p>

  <p>"Now while Dr. Jervis is finding us the print we want, I will run up to
  the laboratory for an inked slab."</p>

  <p>He handed me the little book and, as he left the room, I began to turn
  over the leaves&mdash;not without emotion, for it was this very "thumbograph"
  that first introduced me to my wife, as is related elsewhere&mdash;glancing
  at the various prints above the familiar names and marvelling afresh at the
  endless variations of pattern that they displayed. At length I came upon two
  thumb-prints of which one&mdash;the left&mdash;was marked by a longitudinal
  white line&mdash;evidently the trace of a scar; and underneath them was
  written the signature "Reuben Hornby."</p>

  <p>At this moment Thorndyke re-entered the room carrying the inked slab,
  which he laid on the table, and seating himself between the superintendent
  and me, addressed the former.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miller, here are two thumb-prints made by a gentleman named Reuben
  Hornby. Just glance at the left one; it is a highly characteristic
  print."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Miller, "one could swear to that from memory, I should
  think."</p>

  <p>"Then look at this." Thorndyke took the paper from the box and, unfolding
  it, handed it to the detective. It bore a pencilled inscription, and on it
  were two blood-smears and a very distinct thumb-print in blood. "What do you
  say to that thumb-print?"</p>

  <p>"Why," answered Miller, "it's this one, of course; Reuben Hornby's left
  thumb."</p>

  <p>"Wrong, my friend," said Thorndyke. "It was made by an ingenious gentleman
  named Walter Hornby (whom you followed from the Old Bailey and lost on
  Ludgate Hill); but not with his thumb."</p>

  <p>"How, then?" demanded the superintendent incredulously.</p>

  <p>"In this way." Thorndyke took the boxwood "pawn" from its receptacle and
  pressed its flat base onto the inked slab; then lifted it and pressed it onto
  the back of a visiting-card, and again raised it; and now the card was marked
  by a very distinct thumb-print.</p>

  <p>"My God!" exclaimed the detective, picking up the card and viewing it with
  a stare of dismay, "this is the very devil, sir. This fairly knocks the
  bottom out of finger-print identification. May I ask, sir, how you made that
  stamp&mdash;for I suppose you did make it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we made it here, and the process we used was practically that used
  by photo-engravers in making line blocks; that is to say, we photographed one
  of Mr. Hornby's thumb-prints, printed it on a plate of chrome-gelatine,
  developed the plate with hot water and this"&mdash;here he touched the
  embossed surface of the stamp&mdash;"is what remained. But we could have done
  it in various other ways; for instance, with common transfer paper and
  lithographic stone; indeed, I assure you, Miller, that there is nothing
  easier to forge than a finger-print, and it can be done with such perfection
  that the forger himself cannot tell his own forgery from a genuine original,
  even when they are placed side by side."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm hanged," grunted the superintendent, "you've fairly knocked me,
  this time, doctor." He rose gloomily and prepared to depart. "I suppose," he
  added, "your interest in this case has lapsed, now Belfield's out of it?"</p>

  <p>"Professionally, yes; but I am disposed to finish the case for my own
  satisfaction. I am quite curious as to who our too-ingenious friend may
  be."</p>

  <p>Miller's face brightened. "We shall give you every facility, you
  know&mdash;and that reminds me that Singleton gave me these two photographs
  for you, one of the official paper and one of the prints on the glass. Is
  there anything more that we can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to have a look at the room in which the murder took
  place."</p>

  <p>"You shall, doctor; to-morrow, if you like; I'll meet you there in the
  morning at ten, if that will do."</p>

  <p>It would do excellently, Thorndyke assured him, and with this the
  superintendent took his departure in renewed spirits.</p>

  <p>We had only just closed the door when there came a hurried and urgent
  tapping upon it, whereupon I once more threw it open, and a quietly-dressed
  woman in a thick veil, who was standing on the threshold, stepped quickly
  past me into the room.</p>

  <p>"Where is my husband?" she demanded, as I closed the door; and then,
  catching sight of Thorndyke, she strode up to him with a threatening air and
  a terrified but angry face.</p>

  <p>"What have you done with my husband, sir?" she repeated. "Have you
  betrayed him, after giving your word? I met a man who looked like a police
  officer on the stairs."</p>

  <p>"Your husband, Mrs. Belfield, is here and quite safe," replied Thorndyke.
  "He has locked himself in that room," indicating the office.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Belfield darted across and rapped smartly at the door. "Are you
  there, Frank?" she called.</p>

  <p>In immediate response the key turned, the door opened and Belfield emerged
  looking very pale and worn.</p>

  <p>"You have kept me a long time in there, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"It took me a long time to prove to Superintendent Miller that he was
  after the wrong man. But I succeeded, and now, Belfield, you are free. The
  charge against you is withdrawn."</p>

  <p>Belfield stood for a while as one stupefied, while his wife, after a
  moment of silent amazement, flung her arms round his neck and burst into
  tears. "But how did you know I was innocent, sir?" demanded the bewildered
  Belfield.</p>

  <p>"Ah! how did I? Every man to his trade, you know. Well, I congratulate
  you, and now go home and have a square meal and get a good night's rest."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with his clients&mdash;vainly endeavouring to prevent Mrs.
  Belfield from kissing his hand&mdash;and stood at the open door listening
  until the sound of their retreating footsteps died away.</p>

  <p>"A noble little woman, Jervis," said he, as he closed the door. "In
  another moment she would have scratched my face&mdash;and I mean to find out
  the scoundrel who tried to wreck her happiness."</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>PART II. &mdash; THE SHIP OF THE DESERT</h3>

  <p class="first">THE case which I am now about to describe has always
  appeared to me a singularly instructive one, as illustrating the value and
  importance of that fundamental rule in the carrying out of investigations
  which Thorndyke had laid down so emphatically&mdash;the rule that all facts,
  in any way relating to a case, should be collected impartially and without
  reference to any theory, and each fact, no matter how trivial or apparently
  irrelevant, carefully studied. But I must not anticipate the remarks of my
  learned and talented friend on this subject which I have to chronicle anon;
  rather let me proceed to the case itself.</p>

  <p>I had slept at our chambers in King's Bench Walk&mdash;as I commonly did
  two or three nights a week&mdash;and on coming down to the sitting-room,
  found Thorndyke's man, Polton, putting the last touches to the
  breakfast-table, while Thorndyke himself was poring over two photographs of
  fingerprints, of which he seemed to be taking elaborate measurements with a
  pair of hair-dividers. He greeted me with his quiet, genial smile and, laying
  down the dividers, took his seat at the breakfast-table.</p>

  <p>"You are coming with me this morning, I suppose," said he; "the Camberwell
  murder case, you know."</p>

  <p>"Of course I am if you will have me, but I know practically nothing of the
  case. Could you give me an outline of the facts that are known?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me solemnly, but with a mischievous twinkle. "This,"
  he said, "is the old story of the fox and the crow; you 'bid me discourse,'
  and while I 'enchant thine ear,' you claw to windward with the broiled ham. A
  deep-laid plot, my learned brother."</p>

  <p>"And such," I exclaimed, "is the result of contact with the criminal
  classes!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you regard yourself in that light," he retorted, with a
  malicious smile. "However, with regard to this case. The facts are briefly
  these: The murdered man, Caldwell, who seems to have been formerly a receiver
  of stolen goods and probably a police spy as well, lived a solitary life in a
  small house with only an elderly woman to attend him.</p>

  <p>"A week ago this woman went to visit a married daughter and stayed the
  night with her, leaving Caldwell alone in the house. When she returned on the
  following morning she found her master lying dead on the floor of his office,
  or study, in a small pool of blood.</p>

  <p>"The police surgeon found that he had been dead about twelve hours. He had
  been killed by a single blow, struck from behind, with some heavy implement,
  and a jemmy which lay on the floor beside him fitted the wound exactly. The
  deceased wore a dressing-gown and no collar, and a bedroom candlestick lay
  upside down on the floor, although gas was laid on in the room; and as the
  window of the office appears to have been forced with the jemmy that was
  found, and there were distinct footprints on the flower-bed outside the
  window, the police think that the deceased was undressing to go to bed when
  he was disturbed by the noise of the opening window; that he went down to the
  office and, as he entered, was struck down by the burglar who was lurking
  behind the door. On the window-glass the police found the greasy impression
  of an open right hand, and, as you know, the finger-prints were identified by
  the experts as those of an old convict named Belfield. As you also know, I
  proved that those finger-prints were, in reality, forgeries, executed with
  rubber or gelatine stamps. That is an outline of the case."</p>

  <p>The close of this recital brought our meal to an end, and we prepared for
  our visit to the scene of the crime. Thorndyke slipped into his pocket his
  queer outfit&mdash;somewhat like that of a field geologist&mdash;locked up
  the photographs, and we set forth by way of the Embankment.</p>

  <p>"The police have no clue, I suppose, to the identity of the murderer, now
  that the finger-prints have failed?" I asked, as we strode along
  together.</p>

  <p>"I expect not," he replied, "though they might have if they examined their
  material. I made out a rather interesting point this morning, which is this:
  the man who made those sham finger-prints used two stamps, one for the thumb
  and the other for the four fingers; and the original from which those stamps
  were made was the official finger-print form."</p>

  <p>"How did you discover that?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"It was very simple. You remember that Mr. Singleton of the Finger-print
  Department sent me, by Superintendent Miller, two photographs, one of the
  prints on the window and one of the official form with Belfield's
  finger-prints on it. Well, I have compared them and made the most minute
  measurements of each, and they are obviously duplicates. Not only are all the
  little imperfections on the form&mdash;due to defective
  inking&mdash;reproduced faithfully on the window-pane, but the relative
  positions of the four fingers on both cases agree to the hundredth of an
  inch. Of course the thumb stamp was made by taking an oval out of the rolled
  impression on the form."</p>

  <p>"Then do you suggest that this murder was committed by someone connected
  with the Finger-print Department at Scotland Yard?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. But someone has had access to the forms. There has been leakage
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>When we arrived at the little detached house in which the murdered man had
  lived, the door was opened by an elderly woman, and our friend,
  Superintendent Miller, greeted us in the hall.</p>

  <p>"We are all ready for you, doctor," said he. "Of course, the things have
  all been gone over once, but we are turning them out more thoroughly now." He
  led the way into the small, barely-furnished office in which the tragedy had
  occurred. A dark stain on the carpet and a square hole in one of the
  window-panes furnished memorials of the crime, which were supplemented by an
  odd assortment of objects laid out on the newspaper-covered table. These
  included silver teaspoons, watches, various articles of jewellery, from which
  the stones had been removed&mdash;none of them of any considerable
  value&mdash;and a roughly-made jemmy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why Caldwell should have kept all these odds and ends," said
  the detective superintendent. "There is stuff here, that I can identify, from
  six different burglaries&mdash;and not a conviction among the six."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked over the collection with languid interest; he was
  evidently disappointed at finding the room so completely turned out.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea what has been taken?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not the least. We don't even know if the safe was opened. The keys were
  on the writing-table, so I suppose he went through everything, though I don't
  see why he left these things if he did. We found them all in the safe."</p>

  <p>"Have you powdered the jemmy?"</p>

  <p>The superintendent turned very red. "Yes," he growled, "but some
  half-dozen blithering idiots had handled the thing before I saw it&mdash;been
  trying it on the window, the blighters&mdash;so, of course, it showed nothing
  but the marks of their beastly paws."</p>

  <p>"The window had not really been forced, I suppose?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miller, with a glance of surprise at my colleague, "that was
  a plant; so were the footprints. He must have put on a pair of Caldwell's
  boots and gone out and made them&mdash;unless Caldwell made them himself,
  which isn't likely."</p>

  <p>"Have you found any letter or telegram?"</p>

  <p>"A letter making an appointment for nine o'clock on the night of the
  murder. No signature or address, and the handwriting evidently
  disguised."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything that furnishes any sort of clue?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, there is. There's this, which we found in the safe." He
  produced a small parcel which he proceeded to unfasten, looking somewhat
  queerly at Thorndyke the while. It contained various odds and ends of
  jewellery, and a smaller parcel formed of a pocket-handkerchief tied with
  tape. This the detective also unfastened, revealing half-a-dozen silver
  teaspoons, all engraved with the same crest, two salt-cellars and a gold
  locket bearing a monogram. There was also a half-sheet of note-paper on which
  was written, in a manifestly disguised hand: "These are the goods I told you
  about. F. B." But what riveted Thorndyke's attention and mine was the
  handkerchief itself (which was not a very clean one and was sullied by one or
  two small blood-stains), for it was marked in one corner with the name "F.
  Belfield," legibly printed in marking-ink with a rubber stamp.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke and the superintendent looked at one another and both
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I know what you are thinking, sir," said the latter.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you do," was the reply, "and it is useless to pretend that you
  don't agree with me."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said Miller doggedly, "if that handkerchief has been put
  there as a plant, it's Belfield's business to prove it. You see, doctor," he
  added persuasively, "it isn't this job only that's affected. Those spoons,
  those salt-cellars and that locket are part of the proceeds of the Winchmore
  Hill burglary, and we want the gentleman who did that crack&mdash;we want him
  very badly."</p>

  <p>"No doubt you do," replied Thorndyke, "but this handkerchief won't help
  you. A sharp counsel&mdash;Mr. Anstey, for instance&mdash;would demolish it
  in five minutes. I assure you, Miller, that handkerchief has no evidential
  value whatever, whereas it might prove an invaluable instrument of research.
  The best thing you can do is to hand it over to me and let me see what I can
  learn from it."</p>

  <p>The superintendent was obviously dissatisfied, but he eventually agreed,
  with manifest reluctance, to Thorndyke's suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Very well, doctor," he said; "you shall have it for a day or two. Do you
  want the spoons and things as well?"</p>

  <p>"No. Only the handkerchief and the paper that was in it."</p>

  <p>The two articles were accordingly handed to him and deposited in a tin box
  which he usually carried in his pocket, and, after a few more words with the
  disconsolate detective, we took our departure.</p>

  <p>"A very disappointing morning," was Thorndyke's comment as we walked away.
  "Of course the room ought to have been examined by an expert before anything
  was moved."</p>

  <p>"Have you picked up anything in the way of information?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Very little excepting confirmation of my original theory. You see, this
  man Caldwell was a receiver and evidently a police spy. He gave useful
  information to the police, and they, in return, refrained from inconvenient
  inquiries. But a spy, or 'nark,' is nearly always a blackmailer too, and the
  probabilities in this case are that some crook, on whom Caldwell was putting
  the screw rather too tightly, made an appointment for a meeting when the
  house was empty, and just knocked Caldwell on the head. The crime was
  evidently planned beforehand, and the murderer came prepared to kill several
  birds with one stone. Thus he brought with him the stamps to make the sham
  finger-prints on the window, and I have no doubt that he also brought this
  handkerchief and the various oddments of plate and jewellery from those
  burglaries that Miller is so keen about, and planted them in the safe. You
  noticed, I suppose, that none of the things were of any value, but all were
  capable of easy identification?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I noticed that. His object, evidently, was to put those burglaries
  as well as the murder onto poor Belfield."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And you see what Miller's attitude is; Belfield is the bird in
  the hand, whereas the other man&mdash;if there is another&mdash;is still in
  the bush; so Belfield is to be followed up and a conviction obtained if
  possible. If he is innocent, that is his affair, and it is for him to prove
  it."</p>

  <p>"And what shall you do next?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall telegraph to Belfield to come and see us this evening. He may be
  able to tell us something about this handkerchief that, with the clue we
  already have, may put us on the right track. What time is your
  consultation?"</p>

  <p>"Twelve-thirty&mdash;and here comes my 'bus. I shall be in to lunch." I
  sprang onto the footboard, and as I took my seat on the roof and looked back
  at my friend striding along with an easy swing, I knew that he was deep in
  thought, though automatically attentive to all that was happening. My
  consultation&mdash;it was a lunacy case of some importance&mdash;was over in
  time to allow of my return to our chambers punctually at the luncheon hour;
  and as I entered, I was at once struck by something new in Thorndyke's
  manner&mdash;a certain elation and gaiety which I had learned to associate
  with a point scored successfully in some intricate and puzzling case. He made
  no confidences, however, and seemed, in fact, inclined to put away, for a
  time, all his professional cares and business.</p>

  <p>"Shall we have an afternoon off, Jervis?" he said gaily. "It is a fine day
  and work is slack just now. What say you to the Zoo? They have a splendid
  chimpanzee and several specimens of that remarkable fish Periophthalmos
  Kolreuteri. Shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," I replied; "and we will mount the elephant, if you like,
  and throw buns to the grizzly bear and generally renew our youth like the
  eagle."</p>

  <p>But when, an hour later, we found ourselves in the gardens, I began to
  suspect my friend of some ulterior purpose in this holiday jaunt; for it was
  not the chimpanzee or even the wonderful fish that attracted his attention.
  On the contrary, he hung about the vicinity of the lamas and camels in a way
  that I could not fail to notice; and even there it appeared to be the sheds
  and houses rather than the animals themselves that interested him.</p>

  <p>"Behold, Jervis," he said presently, as a saddled camel of seedy aspect
  was led towards its house, "behold the ship of the desert, with raised
  saloon-deck amidships, fitted internally with watertight compartments and
  displaying the effects of rheumatoid arthritis in his starboard hip-joint.
  Let us go and examine him before he hauls into dock." We took a cross-path to
  intercept the camel on its way to its residence, and Thorndyke moralized as
  we went.</p>

  <p>"It is interesting," he remarked, "to note the way in which these
  specialized animals, such as the horse, the reindeer and the camel, have been
  appropriated by man, and their special character made to subserve human
  needs. Think, for instance, of the part the camel has played in history, in
  ancient commerce&mdash;and modern too, for that matter&mdash;and in the
  diffusion of culture; and of the role he has enacted in war and conquest from
  the Egyptian campaign of Cambyses down to that of Kitchener. Yes, the camel
  is a very remarkable animal, though it must be admitted that this particular
  specimen is a scurvy-looking beast."</p>

  <p>The camel seemed to be sensible of these disparaging remarks, for as it
  approached it saluted Thorndyke with a supercilious grin and then turned away
  its head.</p>

  <p>"Your charge is not as young as he used to be," Thorndyke observed to the
  man who was leading the animal.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he isn't; he's getting old, and that's the fact. He shows it
  too."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Thorndyke, strolling towards the house by the man's
  side, "these beasts require a deal of attention?"</p>

  <p>"You're right, sir; and nasty-tempered brutes they are."</p>

  <p>"So I have heard; but they are interesting creatures, the camels and
  lamas. Do you happen to know if complete sets of photographs of them are to
  be had here?"</p>

  <p>"You can get a good many at the lodge, sir," the man replied, "but not
  all, I think. If you want a complete set, there's one of our men in the
  camel-house that could let you have them; he takes the photos himself, and
  very clever he is at it, too. But he isn't here just now."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you could give me his name so that I could write to him," said
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. His name is Woodthorpe&mdash;Joseph Woodthorpe. He'll do
  anything for you to order. Thank you, sir; good-afternoon, sir;" and
  pocketing an unexpected tip, the man led his charge towards its lair.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's absorbing interest in the camels seemed now suddenly to become
  extinct, and he suffered me to lead him to any part of the gardens that
  attracted me, showing an imperial interest in all the inmates from the
  insects to the elephants, and enjoying his holiday&mdash;if it was
  one&mdash;with the gaiety and high spirits of a schoolboy. Yet he never let
  slip a chance of picking up a stray hair or feather, but gathered up each
  with care, wrapped it in its separate paper, on which was written its
  description, and deposited it in his tin collecting-box.</p>

  <p>"You never know," he remarked, as we turned away from the ostrich
  enclosure, "when a specimen for comparison may be of vital importance. Here,
  for instance, is a small feather of a cassowary, and here the hair of a
  wapiti deer; now the recognition of either of those might, in certain
  circumstances, lead to the detection of a criminal or save the life of an
  innocent man. The thing has happened repeatedly, and may happen again
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You must have an enormous collection of hairs in your cabinet," I
  remarked, as we walked home.</p>

  <p>"I have," he replied, "probably the largest in the world. And as to other
  microscopical objects of medico-legal interest, such as dust and mud from
  different localities and from special industries and manufactures, fibres,
  food-products and drugs, my collection is certainly unique."</p>

  <p>"And you have found your collection useful in your work?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Constantly. Over and over again I have obtained, by reference to my
  specimens, the most unexpected evidence, and the longer I practise, the more
  I become convinced that the microscope is the sheet-anchor of the medical
  jurist."</p>

  <p>"By the way," I said, "you spoke of sending a telegram to Belfield. Did
  you send it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I asked him to come to see me to-night at half-past eight, and, if
  possible, bring his wife with him. I want to get to the bottom of that
  handkerchief mystery."</p>

  <p>"But do you think he will tell you the truth about it?"</p>

  <p>"That is impossible to judge; he will be a fool if he does not. But I
  think he will; he has a godly fear of me and my methods."</p>

  <p>As soon as our dinner was finished and cleared away, Thorndyke produced
  the "collecting-box" from his pocket, and began to sort out the day's
  "catch," giving explicit directions to Polton for the disposal of each
  specimen. The hairs and small feathers were to be mounted as microscopic
  objects, while the larger feathers were to be placed, each in its separate
  labelled envelope, in its appropriate box. While these directions were being
  given, I stood by the window absently gazing out as I listened, gathering
  many a useful hint in the technique of preparation and preservation, and
  filled with admiration alike at my colleague's exhaustive knowledge of
  practical detail and the perfect manner in which he had trained his
  assistant. Suddenly I started, for a well-known figure was crossing from
  Crown Office Row and evidently bearing down on our chambers.</p>

  <p>"My word, Thorndyke," I exclaimed, "here's a pretty mess!"</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" he asked, looking up anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Superintendent Miller heading straight for our doorway. And it is now
  twenty minutes past eight."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed. "It will be a quaint position," he remarked, "and
  somewhat of a shock for Belfield. But it really doesn't matter; in fact, I
  think, on the whole, I am rather pleased that he should have come."</p>

  <p>The superintendent's brisk knock was heard a few moments later, and when
  he was admitted by Polton, he entered and looked round the room a little,
  sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"I am ashamed to come worrying you like this, sir," he began
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Thorndyke, serenely slipping the cassowary's feather
  into an envelope, and writing the name, date and locality on the outside. "I
  am your servant in this case, you know. Polton, whisky and soda for the
  superintendent."</p>

  <p>"You see, sir," continued Miller, "our people are beginning to fuss about
  this case, and they don't approve of my having handed that handkerchief and
  the paper over to you as they will have to be put in evidence."</p>

  <p>"I thought they might object," remarked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"So did I, sir; and they do. And, in short, they say that I have got to
  get them back at once. I hope it won't put you out, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," said Thorndyke. "I have asked Belfield to come here
  to-night&mdash;I expect him in a few minutes&mdash;and when I have heard what
  he has to say I shall have no further use for the handkerchief."</p>

  <p>"You're not going to show it to him!" exclaimed the detective, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I am."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't do that, sir. I can't sanction it; I can't indeed."</p>

  <p>"Now, look you here, Miller," said Thorndyke, shaking his forefinger at
  the officer; "I am working for you in this case, as I have told you. Leave
  the matter in my hands. Don't raise silly objections; and when you leave here
  tonight you will take with you not only the handkerchief and the paper, but
  probably also the name and address of the man who committed this murder and
  those various burglaries that you are so keen about."</p>

  <p>"Is that really so, sir?" exclaimed the astonished detective. "Well, you
  haven't let the grass grow under your feet. Ah!" as a gentle rap at the door
  was heard, "here's Belfield, I suppose."</p>

  <p>It was Belfield&mdash;accompanied by his wife&mdash;and mightily disturbed
  they were when their eyes lighted on our visitor.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be afraid of me, Belfield," said Miller, with ferocious
  geniality; "I am not here after you." Which was not literally true, though it
  served to reassure the affrighted ex-convict.</p>

  <p>"The superintendent dropped in by chance," said Thorndyke; "but it is just
  as well that he should hear what passes. I want you to look at this
  handkerchief and tell me if it is yours. Don't be afraid, but just tell us
  the simple truth."</p>

  <p>He took the handkerchief out of a drawer and spread it on the table; and I
  now observed that a small square had been cut out of one of the
  bloodstains.</p>

  <p>Belfield took the handkerchief in his trembling hands, and as his eye fell
  on the stamped name in the corner he turned deadly pale.</p>

  <p>"It looks like mine," he said huskily. "What do you say, Liz?" he added,
  passing it to his wife.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Belfield examined first the name and then the hem. "It's yours, right
  enough, Frank," said she. "It's the one that got changed in the wash. You
  see, sir," she continued, addressing Thorndyke, "I bought him half-a-dozen
  new ones about six months ago, and I got a rubber stamp made and marked them
  all. Well, one day when I was looking over his things I noticed that one of
  his handkerchiefs had got no mark on it. I spoke to the laundress about it,
  but she couldn't explain it, so as the right one never came back, I marked
  the one that we got in exchange."</p>

  <p>"How long ago was that?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"About two months ago I noticed it."</p>

  <p>"And you know nothing more about it."</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever, sir. Nor you, Frank, do you?"</p>

  <p>Her husband shook his head gloomily, and Thorndyke replaced the
  handkerchief in the drawer.</p>

  <p>"And now," said he, "I am going to ask you a question on another subject.
  When you were at Holloway there was a warder&mdash;or assistant
  warder&mdash;there, named Woodthorpe. Do you remember him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, very well indeed; in fact, it was him that&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I know," interrupted Thorndyke. "Have you seen him since you left
  Holloway?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, once. It was last Easter Monday. I met him at the Zoo; he is a
  keeper there now in the camel-house" (here a sudden light dawned upon me and
  I chuckled aloud, to Belfield's great astonishment). "He gave my little boy a
  ride on one of the camels and made himself very pleasant."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember anything else happening?" Thorndyke inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. The camel had a little accident; he kicked out&mdash;he was an
  ill-tempered beast&mdash;and his leg hit a post; there happened to be a nail
  sticking out from that post, and it tore up a little flap of skin. Then
  Woodthorpe got out his handkerchief to tie up the wound, but as it was none
  of the cleanest, I said to him: 'Don't use that, Woodthorpe; have mine,'
  which was quite a clean one. So he took it and bound up the camel's leg, and
  he said to me: 'I'll have it washed and send it to you if you give me your
  address.' But I told him there was no need for that; I should be passing the
  camel-house on my way out and I would look in for the handkerchief. And I
  did: I looked in about an hour later, and Woodthorpe gave me my handkerchief,
  folded up but not washed."</p>

  <p>"Did you examine it to see if it was yours?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I just slipped it in my pocket as it was."</p>

  <p>"And what became of it afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"When I got home I dropped it into the dirty-linen basket."</p>

  <p>"Is that all you know about it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; that is all I know."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Belfield, that will do. Now you have no reason to be uneasy.
  You will soon know all about the Camberwell murder&mdash;that is, if you read
  the papers."</p>

  <p>The ex-convict and his wife were obviously relieved by this assurance and
  departed in quite good spirits. When they were gone, Thorndyke produced the
  handkerchief and the half-sheet of paper and handed them to the
  superintendent, remarking&mdash;"This is highly satisfactory, Miller; the
  whole case seems to join up very neatly indeed. Two months ago the wife first
  noticed the substituted handkerchief, and last Easter Monday&mdash;a little
  over two months ago&mdash;this very significant incident took place in the
  Zoological Gardens."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well, sir," objected the superintendent, "but we've only
  their word for it, you know."</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied Thorndyke. "We have excellent corroborative evidence.
  You noticed that I had cut a small piece out of the blood-stained portion of
  the handkerchief?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and I was sorry you had done it. Our people won't like that."</p>

  <p>"Well, here it is, and we will ask Dr. Jervis to give us his opinion of
  it."</p>

  <p>From the drawer in which the handkerchief had been hidden he brought forth
  a microscope slide, and setting the microscope on the table, laid the slide
  on the stage.</p>

  <p>"Now, Jervis," he said, "tell us what you see there."</p>

  <p>I examined the edge of the little square of fabric (which had been mounted
  in a fluid reagent) with a high-power objective, and was, for a time, a
  little puzzled by the appearance of the blood that adhered to it.</p>

  <p>"It looks like bird's blood," I said presently, with some hesitation, "but
  yet I can make out no nuclei." I looked again, and then, suddenly, "By Jove!"
  I exclaimed, "I have it; of course! It's the blood of a camel!"</p>

  <p>"Is that so, doctor?" demanded the detective, leaning forward in his
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"That is so," replied Thorndyke. "I discovered it after I came home this
  morning. You see," he explained, "it is quite unmistakable. The rule is that
  the blood corpuscles of mammals are circular; the one exception is the camel
  family, in which the corpuscles are elliptical."</p>

  <p>"Why," exclaimed Miller, "that seems to connect Woodthorpe with this
  Camberwell job."</p>

  <p>"It connects him with it very conclusively," said Thorndyke. "You are
  forgetting the finger-prints."</p>

  <p>The detective looked puzzled. "What about them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They were made with stamps&mdash;two stamps, as a matter of
  fact&mdash;and those stamps were made by photographic process from the
  official finger-print form. I can prove that beyond all doubt."</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose they were. What then?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke opened a drawer and took out a photograph, which he handed to
  Miller. "Here," he said, "is the photograph of the official finger-print form
  which you were kind enough to bring me. What does it say at the bottom
  there?" and he pointed with his finger.</p>

  <p>The superintendent read aloud: "Impressions taken by Joseph Woodthorpe.
  Rank, Warder; Prison, Holloway." He stared at the photograph for a moment,
  and then exclaimed&mdash;"Well, I'm hanged! You have worked this out neatly,
  doctor! and so quick too. We'll have Mr. Woodthorpe under lock and key the
  first thing to-morrow morning. But how did he do it, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"He might have taken duplicate finger-prints and kept one form; the
  prisoners would not know there was anything wrong; but he did not in this
  case. He must have contrived to take a photograph of the form before sending
  it in&mdash;it would take a skilful photographer only a minute or two with a
  suitable hand-camera placed on a table at the proper distance from the wall;
  and I have ascertained that he is a skilful photographer. You will probably
  find the apparatus, and the stamps too, when you search his rooms."</p>

  <p>"Well, well. You do give us some surprises, doctor. But I must be off now
  to see about this warrant. Good-night, sir, and many thanks for your
  help."</p>

  <p>When the superintendent had gone we sat for a while looking at one another
  in silence. At length Thorndyke spoke. "Here is a case, Jervis," he said,
  "which, simple as it is, teaches a most invaluable lesson&mdash;a lesson
  which you should take well to heart. It is this: The evidential value of any
  fact is an unknown quantity until the fact has been examined. That seems a
  self-evident truth, but like many other self-evident truths, it is constantly
  overlooked in practice. Take this present case. When I left Caldwell's house
  this morning the facts in my possession were these: (1) The man who murdered
  Caldwell was directly or indirectly connected with the Finger-print
  Department. (2) He was almost certainly a skilled photographer. (3) He
  probably committed the Winchmore Hill and the other burglaries. (4) He was
  known to Caldwell, had had professional dealings with him and was probably
  being blackmailed. This was all; a very vague clue, as you see.</p>

  <p>"There was the handkerchief, planted, as I had no doubt; but could not
  prove; the name stamped on it was Belfield's, but any one can get a rubber
  stamp made. Then it was stained with blood, as handkerchiefs often are; that
  blood might or might not be human blood; it did not seem to matter a straw
  whether it was or not. Nevertheless, I said to myself: If it is human, or at
  least mammalian blood, that is a fact; and if it is not human blood, that is
  also a fact. I will have that fact, and then I shall know what its value is.
  I examined the stain when I reached home, and behold! it was camel's blood;
  and immediately this insignificant fact swelled up into evidence of primary
  importance. The rest was obvious. I had seen Woodthorpe's name on the form,
  and I knew several other officials. My business was to visit all places in
  London where there were camels, to get the names of all persons connected
  with them and to ascertain if any among them was a photographer. Naturally I
  went first to the Zoo, and at the very first cast hooked Joseph Woodthorpe.
  Wherefore I say again: Never call any fact irrelevant until you have examined
  it."</p>

  <p>The remarkable evidence given above was not heard at the trial, nor did
  Thorndyke's name appear among the witnesses; for when the police searched
  Woodthorpe's rooms, so many incriminating articles were found (including a
  pair of fingerprint stamps which exactly answered to Thorndyke's description
  of them, and a number of photographs of finger-print forms) that his guilt
  was put beyond all doubt; and society was shortly after relieved of a very
  undesirable member.</p>
