<h2><a name="c1" id="c1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>It was the ninth of November, a day that was "kept up" at this
time by a section of the people who had plenty of money and no work
to do. Riding and picnic parties had been organised days before,
and a dance arranged in Dumboon township for the evening. The
feminine division, especially the love-lorn, looked forward to it
hopefully, even anxiously. Dances were seldom held in that
neighbourhood, and opportunities for match-making in a scattered,
hard-working community were chance ones, with heart-breaking
intervals between. Occasionally "Long Bill" would meet Amelia Jane
in the bush while bullock-hunting, and they would say "Good day" to
one another. Bill would ask Amelia Jane if she had seen anything of
Battler in her travels; and Amelia Jane would make a similar
inquiry concerning Strawberry. Then they would say "So long," and
go their ways. There wasn't much satisfaction in that. Besides,
Amelia Jane was barefooted, and her old print frock gaped at the
back. It always did have a gape somehow when she met Bill. The
consciousness of her shortcomings was discomfiting, and her manner
towards him restrained in consequence. It was different when they
met in the fine feathers, and it was night, and they could
discourse with strangers, And hug them, too, by special
license.</p>

<p>The ballroom, with its varied associations, communions, whirls
and excitement, is responsible for much of the match-making in such
country places. Masculine Dumboon was not wildly interested in the
marriage question. It had gone its sober way so long that it seemed
to have forgotten there was such a thing as a connecting link. Some
of the girls were drawing perilously near the border of
old-maidenhood, and were desperately anxious to change their
condition. One or two had already ceased to have "birthdays," with
a determination to remain young. They had been young a long
while.</p>

<p>A spinster appeared to them like the black sheep in a flock. She
was liable to be regarded as one about whom there is something
amiss, and, in small places like Dumboon is usually a conspicuous
person. She particularly desired the thrill and the intoxicating
glamour of the ballroom to stir the devil in the other party and
bring him to the scratch.</p>

<p>Amelia Jane was one of the neglected ones. Why, she did not
know; she was as much a woman as any other. She was plain,
sun-browned and toil-scarred; but who wanted good looks in a cedar
scrub? She had the strength of a man, and was not afraid to use it.
As her father, Peter Johnson often remarked, "She's es good a bit
o' stuff in th' yoke es e'er a puncher put a brand on." But Amelia
Jane didn't go off.</p>

<p>She had been running wild in the jungles from infancy, and had
never taken any care of herself in the way that girls do. Being an
only child, she acted as general rouseabout for her father, and
often went with him to the mountain camps to cook and hunt the
bullocks. She could climb like an aborigine, and her knowledge was
principally of timbers, birds and animals. Only lately, when the
sex instinct began to waken and incline her irresistibly towards
the lengthy William, did she consult the looking-glass, and set to
work to cultivate her rebellious hair, and to decorate herself with
bits of ribbon and white myrtle flowers. Nor was this the only
change in the jungle girl occasioned by the propinquity of Bill.
From a bold romp, whose innocent eyes would flinch from no man, she
became shy and reserved, and pensive glances took the place of the
fearless stare of old time. Above all, there came a distaste for
the masculine pursuits that had been the leaven of her jungle life,
and a love for home that was decidedly feminine.</p>

<p>She chanced to meet Long Bill, otherwise "Crackshot" Sooley,
this day near the township. For once she was walking. The pony had
got out.</p>

<p>"Huloa, Bill!" she called from twenty yards off, making towards
him.</p>

<p>"Whey!" roared Bill and his team came to a stand! He was a thin,
sinewy giant, and his face was set in a perpetual grin.</p>

<p>"See yer got a new bullock in t'day," she remarked. "Where'd yer
get him."</p>

<p>"Swopped Yallerman ter Abe Watts for him."</p>

<p>"Thought Yallerman was a clinker?"</p>

<p>"He could heave a trifle when he liked, but 'twas seldom he
liked. Reckon I scored a p'int on Abe in that deal."</p>

<p>"Where's Abe now?"</p>

<p>"Comin' along behind. Ruther a close call he had th' other day.
'Tween me an' you an' that waggon, he was about the scaredest man
as ever dived into water. We wur raftin' logs at Big Hole, an' had
got one poised ready to let go down the slope, when Abe noticed a
junk o' wood in the way, 'bout half-way down, that 'ad been
dislodged by th' last log. We holds on while he jogs down the
shoot, but just as he'd removed th' obstruction th' log slipped
away from us, an' boomed an bounded down 's if it was a live thing
with a special commission to flatten out Abe Watts. Seemed to whiz
round an' jump more'n any log ever did. We let out a yell to warn
him, an' he just shot one look at that revolving horror&mdash;only
a roll or two from him then, an' cut like Charlie Samuels for the
river. Couldn't have escaped any other way very well, as his time
was purty limited, an' the rollin' ground bein' hollow, with, a
dense brush on both sides. There warn't a man there but watched th'
stampede with blanched face, an' scarce a one breathed as Abe dived
wildly into deep water, an' the big cedar plunged with a mighty
splash fair over him. I tell yer, we never expected to see him come
up alive; but up he bobbed, sure enough, ten yards out, an' turned
a scared face towards the dancin' log. 'Are yer hurt?' yells
everybody at once. 'Not much!" says Abe; an' when he'd scrambled
out he said th' log 'ad struck him hard on the soles of his boots,
an' druv him to th' bottom. 'I'll take my solemn oath,' he ses, 'no
logs go pile-drivin' me agin!' "</p>

<p>Bill spat into the grass. "See there's to be a bit of a flare-up
in town tor-night," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yer goin'?"</p>

<p>"Dunno."</p>

<p>"Y' orter."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Be orlright fun."</p>

<p>Bill drew snake tracks in the dust with his whip handle.</p>

<p>"Where'll yer be after tea?" he asked.</p>

<p>" 'T home."</p>

<p>"Might be round," Bill went on. "Think Ginger's runnin' near
your paddick somewhere."</p>

<p>Amelia Jane made snake tracks in the dust with her big toe.</p>

<p>"I've got no mount," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll mount yer," Bill answered with sudden decisiveness. "This
ole moke o' mine's jest in his nateral element under petticoats.
Come third once in th' ladies' hacks at Grafton show."</p>

<p>How many 'orses was there in it?" Amelia Jane inquired.</p>

<p>"Three," said Bill, his eye dwelling admiringly on the veteran.
" 'Ain't much to look at now, but he was a daisy them times. My
oath, yes."</p>

<p>"What ar' you goin' to ride?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'll rake up something 'tween now an' sundown," said Bill. "If
I don't afore I'll be beat, I'll ride ole Brindle in th' pole
there. I stuck a saddle on him up at the scrub one day, when I was
pushed for a 'orse, an' he didn't shape too bad. Bit rough, an'
stiffnecked when yer wanted to haul him round anyways sharp but
he'd gee off an' come hither good enough where he'd plenty o'
ground. An' quiet 's a lamb. Was comin' clitter-clatter down th'
road to see M'Gurren about some logs I wanted to sell in a hurry.
He was buyin' then. Just near Tillalee slip-rails a bald head shot
up from behind a log, an' the next thing I knows, I'm rollin' under
a cockspur bush, an' Brindle's peltin' back to th' mountains, with
th' flaps o' the saddle floggin' him like two big wings; an' ther's
Aleck M'Gurren divin' under th' fence 's if he was after something
an' 'adn't much time to ketch it in. The old scamp 'ad been on his
hands and knees squintin' up a holler log, lookin' for native cats.
'Losh!' he ses, leanin' across th' fence. 'Tis yesel', Bill
Sooley!' 'Some of it is, I ses, unwindin' a yard o' yaller spider
web from me neck, an' subtractin' th' prickles. 'Ye're a lucky mon,
Sooley,' he ses. 'Ye're a varra lucky mon.' 'Where's th' dash luck
come in?' I ses, wipin' the blood off me nose. 'Ye didna break ye'
neck,' ses M'Gurren! 'If ye ken when ye're wul off, mon, yell step
it hame.' Seein' as Brindle was only a speck on th' horizon, an'
still makin' tracks, there warn't much choice about it. Never
straddled him since; but I reckon I'm good for him ter-night if
there's no prad to be got."</p>

<p>"I ken expect yer to call then, for sure?"</p>

<p>"You ken."</p>

<p>Amelia Jane smiled approval, and passed him slowly, looking down
at her feet. Bill lifted his whip. "Whey, come 'ere, Roan! Gee
Brandy!" The loaded jinker strained and creaked, the bullocks
switched their tails as they bent to the yokes, and a dust-cloud
floated between them.</p>

<p>"Crackshot" Sooley was one of the semi-civilised, way-back
settlers of Yeerong Creek&mdash;the pioneers of a wild,
wallaby-haunted region, reeking with the oaths of giant
bullock-drivers, and a-tingle with the far-sounding notes of the
bullfrog bells. These settlers had kept sturdily to their usual
avocations and the ring of the axes and the roar of the whips were
heard in the scrubs as on other days. Why should they go holidaying
in honour of a princeling who was "no relation of theirs?" That was
their philosophic view of the case, expressed in the rough jargon
of their kind.</p>

<p>They were a rugged people. Of various nationalities, of many
shapes and sizes; they displayed as great a diversity in their
dispositions as in their opinions and appearances. Yet the majority
were related, and bound together into one whole like the
correlative inhabitants of Pitcairn Island. It was not safe for a
stranger to speak ill of any one of them, though among themselves
they would pull each other to pieces with the liberality of a
married couple in a domestic squabble. Where there was no other
relationship there was still the always ticklish point of an
anticipatory connection. "Kilfloggin," otherwise George Wrightson,
a teamster who had made a name in Dumboon by frequently getting
drunk, was wont to go beyond this limit by saying, "His old man an'
my bundle o' charms swopped dorgs, an' 'twas a fair an' square deal
if they did palm off wasters on one 'nother, an' I'm not agoin' ter
hear nothin' sed agin him. So look out."</p>

<p>Their main income was derived from the cedar trees that fringed
the banks of the Yeerong, and contributed to the gloom of the
adjacent scrubs. Team after team crawled regularly along the roads
to Dumboon, where the logs were rafted, over bog holes, rocky
gullies and corduroyed swamps. Everyone on the Yeerong could drive
bullocks, even the settlers' wives and daughters; and everyone
could exhort in the picturesque language of the ox-conductor
without misplacing an expletive once in a week. They had been
inured to it from the cradle; and, when some of the men succumbed
to the attractions of Cadby's hostelry, Amelia Jane and "Sarah,
from the Dairy" thought nothing of taking the teams out of town,
while the postmaster and the storekeeper, and the publican and the
policeman, stood looking at them in an idle, used-to-it sort of
way.</p>

<p>Their homes were little slab humpies, with uneven earthern
floors, and roofs of stringy bark, fastened to the rafters with
strips of greenrhide. The doors hung on leather hinges often made
out of the tops of old boots and were fastened with wooden pegs.
Corn sacks hung over the square openings left in the walls for
windows. Fowls and ducks ran in and out all day, and at night
roosted in the surrounding trees. Long grass grew up to the
doorsteps, whence narrow tracks zigzagged to the water-hole and the
cockatoo yards. It wasn't very lonely, though it looked so in the
daytime, when the men and boys, and sometimes the able girls, were
away at work in the scrubs. There was scrub everywhere, thick, dark
jungles, where brush turkeys and wonga pigeons abounded, running
away back to bluecapped ranges. The only fences to be seen were
little dog-leg squares, in which an old horse was kept for rounding
up the bullocks. Among the hills, a short distance off the Yeerong,
were a few settlers who formed quite a different class. They were
farmers and small cattle-raisers. The elite, of course, were
gathered together in Dumboon and none but the most respectable were
received within their circle. Ladies who took in washing, and
gentlemen who had been in gaol, were treated with scorn. Of those
among the hills&mdash;or "The Hielans," as Aleck M'Curren, the rich
bachelor laird of Tillalee, pleased to style them&mdash;three
families had the privilege of entree. These were the Lyntons of
Druton, the Battyes of Murrawang, and the Lethcotes of Fairymede.
The Keatons of Gimbo, the only other homestead on the hills, were
now almost forgotten personages. The triumvirate were copioneers of
the district, and were respected both by the silvertails and
coppertails, though some of them were near as rough and wild as
their surroundings.</p>

<p>"Buit that's naething to fash aboot," said M'Curren when
discussing the subject one day with old Edwin Lynton. "There's gude
under th' rough exterior that appeals mair ta a mon thon softness
o' speech an' gude luks. There's only one I dinna care muckle
aboot, an' that's th' Widow Keaton. I canna stun' that wuman at a',
mon. She's a vulgar wuman."</p>

<p>"She's had no learning," pleaded Lynton in extenuation. "That is
the fault of those who were responsible for her bringing-up."</p>

<p>"She wasna brung oop at a'," said M'Gurren, viciously. "She was
drug oop. But she needna hae sich a bad tongue for a' that. She has
a varra wickit tongue. Why, mon, ye never hear her speakit weel o'
ony one, not e'en o' her ain folk, 'cept it be Eustace. As for th'
lad Mark, he's a gude-for-naething."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mark's all right," said Lynton, who was a widower. "He'll
astonish some of you cynics one of these days, take it from
me."</p>

<p>But M'Gurren shook his head. "It's not in him, mon, it's not in
him," he said, with emphasis. "He's a neer-da-weel, an' he loafs on
th' auld wuman. I dinna like that in ony man."</p>

<p>"He's a clever lad for all that, and he might be a blessing to
his mother yet. Did you see his 'Ode to a Bullfrog' in the last
paper?"</p>

<p>"Ood ta fiddlesticks!" cried M'Gurren, irascibly. "Wul his 'Ood
ta th' Bullyfrogs' bring him bread, an' butter?"</p>

<p>"It would surprise you if it turned out to be the foundation of
fame and fortune," Lynton argued.</p>

<p>"It wad," M'Gurren admitted. "Buit&mdash;losh, mon, I canna see
it, I canna see't."</p>

<p>"Well, time will tell."</p>

<p>"'T wul," M'Gurren agreed. "They telt me his mither an'
Kilfloggin keepit company&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I think poor old George is more at home in the company of a
rumbottle," said Lynton. "I laughed at him at the races last Boxing
Day," he went on hurriedly. He didn't want to discuss the widow
with Mr M'Gurren. Mark was a friend of his.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said M'Gurren, expectantly.</p>

<p>"You were away, I think?"</p>

<p>"Aye; I was owre on the Logan wi' me brither Tonald."</p>

<p>"Well, Kilfloggan and Sooley had taken a little too much of our
friend Cadby's 'extra special' on board, and became troublesome. At
last the trooper took them both, and chained them to a fair-sized
log behind the booth, with the intention of releasing them when the
races were over, if they were then sufficiently law-abiding to be
at large. It was a blistering hot day, and the thirst of the
prisoners soon grew to be unbearable, being aggravated by the
gurgle of liquor through the bush wall that separated them from the
bar. No one heeded their shouts and solicitations; their friends
were too interested in the sports. 'Jumpin' Jemima! this is a bit
too sudding,' says George. 'Must 'ave a beer somehow.' 'Kinder like
to sample some meself,' said Sooley. George stood up. There was
plenty of chain. 'Let's see if we can't breast th' bar, lock-up an'
all,' he says. 'I ken manage my end of her. Hook on.' 'Purty
heavy,' says Sooley, trying the weight. 'Fraid ye'll wobble an'
drop her.' 'Don't you make no error,' says George. 'Ain't that
shikkered. Kon only see one Bill Sooley yet, enyway.' ' 'D'ruther
burn th' consarn 'an carry it,' says Sooley. 'Blamed thing's
chockfull of ants.' 'Wonder wot they're in for?' says George,
regarding the log as an official reformatory. 'Drunk an'
dishorderly,' says Sooley, absently. A race started, and the
clatter of hoofs put fresh vigour into George. 'Got a holt of her,'
he says. 'Can't stand this caper ony longer.'</p>

<p>"They hoisted the lock-up on their shoulders, one at each end,
and, staggering round to the front, banged it down on the bar.
'Beer!' gasps George. 'Bucketful' adds Sooley. They drank their
beers saw the race out, had more beer, then shouldered their
lock-up again, and hurried back with it before the trooper
returned. He found them asleep some time later and when they woke
up the chains were off, the log was gone, and the course deserted.
'Dunno who stole th' lockup,' said George, when I saw him a few
days afterwards; 'but we took our discharge quick' n lively.' "</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c2" id="c2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>Though ignored by Dumboon society, and treated as a nobody by
most people, young Mark Keaton was well received by the few
families among the hills&mdash;with one exception. Mr M'Gurren
could not tolerate him, despite the fact that he was handsome,
prepossessing in manner, and clever in many ways. He was
twenty-one, tall, slightly built, and fairly well educated. His
father, Hugh Keaton, had made his pile in the cedar trade when the
timber was handy, was easily got out, and brought a big price on
the bank. With this he had purchased Gimbo. His predecessor was
Patrick Monaugh, whose relict was the present Mrs Lethcote, who
presided at Fairymede. Hugh had since pegged his claim in
Necropolis, leaving his widow comfortably well off.</p>

<p>Besides Mark, there were two younger sons, Luke and Eustace, who
had left their books for the teams and the scrubs when they had
barely entered their teens. The lushful shadowlands were enchanting
then but when the father died they sold out and went west. How they
got on, or what they were doing there, no one on the Yeerong knew.
Like most men who wander into the bush to look for work, they
"never troubled to write."</p>

<p>Mark had always been a favourite with his father, and as he
lacked the robust physique of his brothers, and was thus less
fitted for the hardships of the cedar getter, he was allowed to
follow his natural bent&mdash;"book learning." He was a perfect
philomath compared with the others. He read and wrote, was always
thinking, and never had much to say. That he had talent, that he
was a colt of some promise, was admitted by his friends, though
none accredited him with being a genius. Some of his poetic efforts
had experienced the glare of print in the local paper, and those
M'Gurren had sneered over, and cited Bobbie Burns, and snickered.
He had also written three or four novels of enormous bulk, and
teeming with hair-bristling incidents and utterly impossible
things. The want of funds, he said, prevented his becoming famous
on the spot, and those who had plenty held tight to it, and refused
to recognise his claims. Mark was sorely wounded by this apathy and
diffidence.</p>

<p>"If I could only get money enough to publish my first book," he
exclaimed, "I would surprise some of these scurrilous cynics of
Dumboon."</p>

<p>"Why don't yer go an' work for it?" his mother snapped. "D'yer
'spect to sit down an' whistle an' see it come rollin' up to
yer?"</p>

<p>"Aint I working day and night!" Mark retorted.</p>

<p>"Phugh!" said his mother. "Th' most yer do is to sit in there,
cooped up like a sittin' hen on wooden eggs, scribblin'. What in
the name o' Patience's th' good o' that? You don't get nothing for
it. An' yer call it work! Look at Luke an' Eustace, how they use
ter buckle to it in the scrubs an' on the road. You work!"</p>

<p>"Mental work is harder than ordinary labour," said Mark,
humbly.</p>

<p>"Get out! Can't I see the difference with me own eyes? Look how
tired they use to come 'ome&mdash;regular knocked up. An' th' way
they use ter sweat. Lord bless' me, when did I ever see you sweat.
No," she iterated, " 'taint work at all simply a continyel worryin'
o' the brain that'll put yer in Collan Park, or Yarra Bend, or
Tarbon Crick, or Woogaroo. That's what bookworms come to. They go
crazy."</p>

<p>That, Mark complained, was another handicap. He had, from a
literary point of view, a bad mother. However much he studied and
struggled, he got nothing but snubs and sneers for his pains. There
were some who took an interest in him, and were sanguine that a
prosperous future awaited him. These were mostly impecunious
persons, who had nothing to give but advice. They made no charge
for the advice. He confided in them, but never wholly in his
mother. There was a time when she was his confidant, before she
knew of the many difficulties a scribe has to contend with in his
first attempts. She thought he was a wonder at that time, and
rushed around, showing the neighbours what her boy wrote out of his
own head. The utter failure of Mark's initial effort opened her
eyes, and henceforth his productions were "useless rubbish." She
was a querulous woman, a pessimist who found fault with the
universe and the inscrutable ways of the Almighty; a selfish woman,
who had an insatiable greed for money, coupled with a relish for
scandal and gossip. This often caused Mark, a modest and sensitive
young man, much embarrassment and confusion when in company of
people of cultivated tastes. This occurred only at the races,
however, when they stood in a crowd.</p>

<p>When the "Dumboon Express" began to blazon, his soulful
effusions before the public eye, he thought his mother's prejudices
would be swept away. He was disappointed.</p>

<p>"What's th' good o' writin' po'try?" she demanded. "There's
enough o' that maudlin stuff writ to supply all creation till
doomsday. If you was paid for it 'twouldn't be so bad, but yer
never get a cent."</p>

<p>"The money will come by and bye," Mark protested.</p>

<p>"Phugh!" said his mother. "Fancy I see Bill Sooley an' Abe Watts
an' Kilfloggin givin' their cedar away to anybody as would take it
for the askin', an' say th' money 'ill come by an' bye. They're not
such fools. They make sure o' the spons fust."</p>

<p>"One has to make a name in literature," Mark explained. "Any
hoodlum can cut and sell cedar."</p>

<p>"He can't sell rubbish though," his mother retorted. "He can't
sell mahogany for cedar. An' seems to me, your books is all
mahogany, while them printer coves wants genuine cedar. 'Taint
names they want to buy. It's quality stuff. I know. I've seen books
with no names on 'em. An' yours 'ud go, name or no name, if they
was the genuine cedar."</p>

<p>She picked up a mat and shook it viciously, then carefully
replaced it.</p>

<p>"I see by th' last paper that cedar's riz, an' it's likely to go
up more," she resumed. "Abe Watts an' Bill Sooley's makin' a good
thing out of it these days. They know which side their bread's
buttered. My word! An' here's you, stuck in the house day in an'
day out, maunderin' like a lovesick fool about a girl's lovely blue
eyes, an' her sweet red lips, an' her rosebud cheeks, an' her
beautiful brow, an' her swan neck, an' her musical voice, an' her
silken hair, an' her snow-white bosom&mdash;Yah! Can she bake a
batch o' bread that yer ken eat, or make a shirt to put on yer
back? You give me th' pip, you do."</p>

<p>Mark shouldered his gun, which he had been cleaning, and
departed hurriedly. What was the use of talking? He could never
make her understand. He felt that a crisis was approaching, and
already in spirit he was wandering over the broad wild lands that
spread around him, knowing that, like Luke and Eustace, he would
soon be far away. And once away, he would be prepared to tackle any
kind of work, and work hard; but here, where every child and every
dog knew him, having set out on the inky way with a blare of
trumpets, he could not bring himself to throw down the pen now and
take up the tools of the cedar getter for such would be an
admission of failure. Foolish pride! But Mark was only a stripling
yet.</p>

<p>With his old dog for mate, he cut across to Druton Hill on the
pretence of getting a duck. In reality the duck he was thinking of
was known as Ethel Lethcote. He was so wrapped up in thoughts of
her that all else was a blank; and presently when his foot and his
eye lit simultaneously on what appeared to be the sinuous body of a
snake, he leaped into the air with, an involuntary cry. Stepping
cautiously back, with gun in readiness, he saw that it was only the
thick part of a broken bullock whip, which had been placed
reptilian fashion' across the track. As he kicked it into the
grass, a low laugh from the road brought a flush to his cheeks. He
was at the teamsters' camping grounds, and Abe Watts, lying in the
bunk under the tail of his waggon, had been, watching him for some
minutes.</p>

<p>"Seem to 'ave th' jumps purty bad t'day, Mark," he said, sitting
up and wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>"Thought it was a, snake," answered Mark shamefacedly. "Didn't
notice it till I was on top of it."</p>

<p>"Reminds me o' Kilfloggin," laughed Abe. "Come home purty late
one night, half sprung as usual. Th' door of his hut (wot is
Thompson's now) was open, an' as he steps in he stumbles agin
something big an' hairy. It sed 'hee-haw,' tremenjus loud an'
sudden, an' as George sprawls out, it bumps him in th' stomick an'
purty nigh knocks th' roof off with him. 'Fore he ken drop back, a
pesky old rooster makes a spring off o' some tin cans he was
roostin' on, an' hits him agin, with th' gol-darndest clatter yer
ever heard. Soon's George got his feet he cut for Cadby's pub like
a barrel down a hill. He was purty wopsy for a week after, an' he
wouldn't sleep in that hut agin for three beers. They told him
'twas only Thompson's donkey what'd fetched him one in th'
bread-basket. But George couldn't swaller that yarn&mdash;not by a
long sight. He punched that donkey though one day 'when it smelt at
him through th' fence. 'Twarnt because he believed the critter 'ad
anything to do with it but he jes' punched him on genrel
principles."</p>

<p>"One gets a daddy of a scare at times from things that would
hurt him no more than his own shadow," said Mark. "I'll never
forget the time I went to get a drink at the Horseshoe Lagoon. I
was lying on a big gum log, and stretching far over to reach the
water, when up pops something wet and hairy right under my eyes. It
gave me such a start that the bit of dead bark I was holding on to
broke, and I shot head-first into the lagoon. I was out again as
quickly as ever a man left water, not knowing yet what kind of
aquarian horror I had encountered. Didn't even want to drink. When
I'd been on dry ground long enough to get my breath back, I saw it
pop up again under the reeds. It was the celebrated ornithorhynchus
paradoxus, whose everyday name is platypus.</p>

<p>"I had a ripsnorter of a fright myself last week," said Abe.
"Was comin' down with an extra big load on, an' jes' past Black
Gully I pulled up to give th' cattle a blow. Was squattin' in th'
shade, with me back agin a coolabah, when something limp an heavy
comes whack on to me head an' begins to claw an' scratch about like
fightin' tomcats. I got the bends out o' me, an' hollered, an' lit
into new territory, all in one spontan-eous act. Then I sees a long
black streak scratchin' gravel like billy-o for th' next tree an'
't 'adn't gone far up when down it comes slap-bang agen, through
hookin' on to a bit of loose bark that give way. That blamed
critter was th' celebrated varanus varius, which his everyday name
is goana."</p>

<p>"I saw M'Gurren in a terrible funk one day with a goana," Mark
rejoined. "It was about twelve months ago. He'd been putting a rail
in his bottom line, and on the way home his dog flushed one from
the grass, and there being no tree handy, it circled round M'Gurren
and scurried up on to his shoulders. And there was the dog
springing and barking at it, and Mac skipping about kicking at it
and yelling to it to lay down. The goana had him clutched by the
shoulder and by the nape of the neck, and Mac daren't lay hold of
its tail to haul him off in case he took some shoulder and neck
with him. He sidled around for about five minutes, squinting
cautiously round, left and right, and perspiring like a cheap
waterbag. The nearest tree was a hundred yards off, and at last,
keeping the dog in front of him, he backed slowly towards it
feeling his way, and wincing and screwing his neck up when the
sharp claws pricked a little more than usual. When he got to the
tree, he put his shoulder carefully against the trunk, and invited
his goanaship to get aloft. As soon as it did, Mac rushed home for
his gun, and pretty soon there was one goana less on the
Yeerong."</p>

<p>There' d 'ave been another missin' at next summer's congress if
I'd spotted that pet fright o' mine when I went back that way,"
said Abe. "Took th' rifle for that, special. But th' carrion 'ad
removed an' left no address."</p>

<p>"Well, I must remove, too," said Mark. "Getting late."</p>

<p>He tucked the gun under his arm, and continued his way to Druton
Hill. Reaching the crest, he paused awhile under a big ironbark,
and looked wistfully towards the homestead. It was some
satisfaction to see the duckhouse, even if the duck wasn't visible.
Just then, however, the report of a gun echoed through the scrub
below him. He ran down, and, picking his way through the underbush,
came suddenly upon the man who had fired the shot. It was
Kilfloggin. Mark had noticed his team on the road near Gimbo, where
he had unyoked for the night. He had conceived a mild feeling of
animus towards the pot-famous gentleman, and this inimical
sentiment was unstintedly reciprocated by the Herculean bullock
driver.</p>

<p>He was singing&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">"Oh, what would you do if the billy boiled
o-ver?<br>
Molly, O Molly, my lo-ver&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hulloa!" cried Mark. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"What's that ter do with you?" Kilfloggin demanded, calmly
tucking a pigeon under his belt.</p>

<p>"It's a lot to do with me," Mark answered. His ears began to
burn. "You're in Lynton's paddock, and he allows no one but me to
shoot here."</p>

<p>"Well, that's his affair, not yours," said Kilfloggin,
reloading.</p>

<p>"You mind yer own bizness, young un."</p>

<p>"I'll make it my business to report you. You're trespassing on
our preserves."</p>

<p>Mark was angered. The man's insolence and sangfroid stung
him.</p>

<p>"You're a bit sudding, young feller. Better mind yer aint too
sudding," Kilfloggin returned as calmly as before.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Mark, mastering his temper.
The other was a big man.</p>

<p>"I've got es much right ter bang around 'ere es you 'ave," the
latter replied. "Who th' jumpin' adder are you, enyway? Jes' you
get along, young 'un, an' hold yer gab. I don't want ter do yer eny
injury&mdash;barrin' yer force me. Be a pity ter spile yer good
looks. That bit o' skirt over th' hill wouldn't like it for one.
Kinder 'urt her feelin's."</p>

<p>"It might be your own looks that would suffer," Mark retorted.
The man took a step forward, and, leaning on his gun, said: "Look
'ere, me cockshaver, you come th' crawlin' informer bizness with
me, an' by th' jumping Jemima, you'll fall in. I'll bundle you out
o' yer home neck an' crop; see if I don't."</p>

<p>"You will?"</p>

<p>Mark regarded the big man with a new interest.</p>

<p>"Yais, I will. I ken do it, mind yer. There's no bloomin'
gassin' about it. So don't be too sudding."</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and plunged through the scrub, with another
burst of song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">"My old bay 'orse run down th' hill;<br>
If he hasn't come up he's down there still"</p>

<p>Kilflogsin was a bit of a mystery on the Yeerong, and for a
moment after he had left him Mark wondered what power he could have
over him or his. Then he laughed scornfully and walked away. Soon
he had forgotten the incident.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c3" id="c3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>Mark beat round so that his way home would take him by Fairymede
House. Ethel was in the garden and saw him coming. As he approached
a side gate that was well screened by trees from the house she came
across the lawn and met him. He raised his hat with stiff
formality. Ethel hated formalities.</p>

<p>"Good sport," she said, her eyes on the gun. "But where's the
game?"</p>

<p>"Only had two shots," said Mark, "Didn't, hit anything,
though."</p>

<p>"You are a duffer," she commented, laughing. "Reminds me of Abe
Watts."</p>

<p>"How did you know him?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"He used to be a rouseabout on Fairymede. Earned his team here.
He was awfully fond of shooting, but could never hit anything he
fired at. One day father was driving home from town, and met him in
the paddock. Abe had nothing, as usual, though he said he had
wounded some fine ducks and they dived. He always wounded something
when no one was with him. Father twitted him. 'D'yer think you
could hit un haystack, Watts?' he said. 'You throw your cady up,'
says Abe, 'an' see if I can't hit it.' Father had a brand new white
helmet on. He got out of the dogcart and threw it into the air. Abe
squinted along the barrel as it went up and covered it while it
came down, and when it lay on the ground&mdash;just a few feet in
front of him he fired and blew a great tunnel through it. Abe has
worn that helmet bullock-driving ever since, with the holes patched
up with brown paper. They call him 'The General.' "</p>

<p>"Didn't he pay for it?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"Not he," said Ethel. "Abe thinks no end of that helmet. When
the bullookies chaff him about his shooting Abe pulls off the old
helmet and shows the holes as proof that he can shoot. When he
tells the yarn, though, the helmet's in midair when he 'plunks it.'
'You ask old Myles didn't I,' he says, as a clincher."</p>

<p>"Bill Sooley's a goot shot, I've heard," Mark observed, by way
of saying something.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's ratty," said Ethel. "He shoots bees and beetles on the
wing with bullets. When he goes fishing and wants bait he shoots
his grasshoppers whilst they're flying&mdash;also with
bullets."</p>

<p>"I've heard of that kind of shooting," said Mark. "Never saw it,
though. There was Stamps our postmaster in Dumboon. According to
his talk, he never missed a shot once in a blue moon. His greatest
ambition was to shoot the first snipe at the opening of the
shooting season. Leonard Lynton swears that he used to crawl about
the moorlands from midnight till sunrise to catch the early bird.
He gained the distinction for three years in succession, but the
fourth year Leonard, bent on beating him, potted his bird the day
before, and hung it in a bush. A bare-legged youngster, with a
bridle on his arm, observed the man&oelig;uvre, and, awaiting his
chance, took the bird and presented it to Stamps. The latter was
out early as usual next morning, deposited the dead bird in a
tussock, and then concealed himself behind a log to watch. About
dawn, Leonard came along, fired at the bush, and, with a
comically-set face, searched around for the game that wasn't there.
Suddenly another echoing report rang out, and Stamps came forward
with a triumphant smile. 'Beat you, Lynton, old chap!' 'Where?'
asked Leonard shamefacedly. 'Fell in that tussock.' Leonard rushed
it; but at the tussock he stopped, and his face became radiant.
Stamps pulled up a second later with a sickly grin. The first snipe
was stiff and cold, and covered with a regiment of ants!"</p>

<p>"I saw Leonard the day before yesterday at Murrawang," said
Ethel. "I was spending the day with Mrs Battye, and Leonard was
over for the mustering. Leila Battye and I helped to muster one
paddock in the afternoon, and then we helped in the yard, perched
up on the cap, working two of the drafting gates. It was great fun.
When I was coming home, I saw Amelia Jane in the Ironbark Paddock.
She was riding full gallop after a dingo, her hat hanging from her
neck, and brandishing a long stick. Poor dingo was cutting for his
natural, his long red tongue lolling out, and his eyes glaring; but
he hadn't pace enough. The pony would rush up with its ears back,
and then you'd hear that stick whiz; but he'd dodge under the
pony's neck and make off in another direction. He'd get about
twenty yards start before she could haul round, then down on him
she'd ride again like a charging lancer. At last he plunged into
Long Swamp, and Amelia Jane plunged in after him. It was deep, too,
and weedy. So you can imagine the state she was in. She caught him
half way over, and brained him in the water. Then she towed him
ashore by the tail, and hacked off his scalp with a tomahawk she
had in a pouch hanging to her saddle. 'What a glorious chase you've
had, Amelia,' I says to her. 'And what a glorious pickle you're
in!' 'Oh, that's nothing,' she says. 'You should a seen me when I
collapsed with the emu eggs.' 'How did that happen?' I asked. 'Had
half a dozen or 'em stowed in the bosom o' me dress,' she says, an'
was joggin' along home quite pleased, when th' pony puts its hoof
in a hole an' soused me. I dropped right on them eggs. Talk about
squash! Th' blessed yolk run all over me. An' sticky! I tried to
scrape it off with a bit o' shell, but that only spread it about
more. Had to get in th' crick, clothes an' all, when I got home.'
"</p>

<p>"Wonder that girl doesn't break her neck," said Mark.</p>

<p>Ethel laughed. She was a pretty girl of eighteen, with dancing
blue eyes, and long brown hair, and she had a brisk, piquant style
that was pleasing. Often had young Keaton looked with longing and
admiration upon her sweet face, and he was enraptured when she
smiled upon him. She was one of the smiling sort; her pleasant
countenance was like a sunbeam. Yet her life was not a happy one,
the consequence of her father's second marriage. She was but a mere
child when her mother died, and her father, Myles Lethcote, worried
with the care of his daughter and his house, and haunted with
financial difficulties, became fascinated with the happy future
pictured for him by the widow Monaugh, who, though ungainly, and
horribly ignorant, was endowed with a fair fortune. Still he
dangled a long while at the bait, but ultimately he was hooked and
landed. He regretted the step ever afterwards, for Biddy soon got
the upper hand of him, and at Fairymede her word was law. The
fortune for which he had married her he never saw, but he very soon
lost sight of the little he had left of his own.</p>

<p>To begin her new state of existence properly, and in accordance
with the dictates of social conscience, Biddy considered it
necessary to have a lady's companion, and so brought her first
husband's sister,' Johanna Monaugh, out from Dumboon. She was an
antiquated spinster, not at all good-looking; indeed, in her
natural state, she might be described as ugly; but, unlike Biddy,
who had a brogue that would trip a donkey, she spoke with the
accent of the native born. She possessed one good quality: she
loved little Ethel, and the girl had learned to call her "Aunt Jo."
This did not accord with the tastes and wishes of Biddy, who
subsequently endeavoured to expel Miss Monaugh, but that good lady
resolutely refused to be expelled.</p>

<p>"Lavinia Lethcote was my dearest friend, and I'm going to stay
here to look after her daughter,'" she said, with a great many nods
and twirling of fingers. "That was her wish."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Biddy, indignantly. "D'ye think now, Jo, I'm not
able to look afther th' colleen just as well as you? Bedad, I'd ate
me hat if I couldn't do that, anyway."</p>

<p>"You could if you liked, Biddy. But you know you don't love the
child. And children want love&mdash;girls above all. They can't
live without it. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh almost invariably ended her arguments in this way.
She knew exactly how things should be, or would be, from previous
experience. It aggravated Biddy more than anything, but, for all
that, she had to put up with it.</p>

<p>So this ill-assorted family continued to live together at
Fairymede until Ethel had grown into the fine young woman that Mark
Keaton saw her&mdash;in a loose, white dress and a broad sun hat,
and a mass of wavy brown hair flooding her back.</p>

<p>"How have you enjoyed your holiday?" he asked her, rubbing an
imaginary rust spot off the barrel of his gun.</p>

<p>"Didn't have one," answered Ethel. "Been working all day."</p>

<p>"What doing?"</p>

<p>"Helping Aunt Jo with her flounces, and tucks and pleats, and
ribbons and laces, and goodness knows what not. It beats me why
some people can't go out of doors without carrying a milliner's
shop front with them. It makes such a lot of work and I don't
particularly love work. However, tonight is my own."</p>

<p>"You are going to the dance?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Unless you are going&mdash;alone?"</p>

<p>"Alone?" cried Ethel. "Now, wouldn't I look well going alone.
All through that dark bush, and running against some rough scrubber
at every turn. That would be nice. If I could ride or drive like
they can, and was used to their gipsy life like Amelia Jane, I
might manage all right without a chaperone. But, you see, I can't.
Another thing, I haven't Amelia Jane's brazen cheek."</p>

<p>"Then may I hope for the pleasure of your company?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Jo is going in. Mr M'Gurren will drive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see!" said Mark, with ill-concealed displeasure. M'Gurren was
frequently in Ethel's company. Consequently, Mark didn't like
M'Gurren. He would tell himself that the Scotchman was a moulty old
bird, while Ethel was only a chicken; but the ugly thought would
obtrude that wealth covereth many defects and forgiveth many sins,
and he would be filled with resentment. M'Gurren, moreover, was a
favoured guest at Fairymede. He dropped in at all times of the
day&mdash;in fact, the dogs had ceased to bark at him. But Mrs
Lethcote did not want Mark. Like M'Gurren, she had no liking for
him. Though the warmest friendship existed between him and the
other inmates of Fairymede, the despotic and unctuous Biddy was
Governor-General, and that closed the portals against indigent
persons. Still, it did not prevent occasional meetings between the
young couple. Where there's a weakness there's a loophole.</p>

<p>"Of course, you'll be there," she added, after a brief
silence.</p>

<p>Mark shook his head, tracing figures on the rail with his
fingers.</p>

<p>"Everybody will be going," Ethel went on, "that is, everybody of
any consequence."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not of any consequence, it seems," he returned. "No
one will miss me. And there's not much fun in dancing&mdash;unless
you can take someone, you like."</p>

<p>He looked at her meaningly.</p>

<p>"What about Amelia Jane or Sarah from the Dairy?" asked Ethel,
mischievously.</p>

<p>Mark threw the gun across his shoulder with savage energy.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll have plenty of fun," he said, doffing his hat
again. "Goodbye!"</p>

<p>Ethel was annoyed, and leaned across the gate, gazing after him.
They had known each other from childhood, and had tramped to school
together. She had always liked him. He was kind and good-natured
and so different from the brawling tatterdemalions who frequented
their road. He had often carried her over the cowals and muddy
places so that she would not soil her dainty shoes. He received no
thanks for those little attentions from her stepmother; but her own
little heart was filled with gratitude. They had gathered wild
flowers together along the slopes of Fairymede's hills; had studied
head against head under the sheltering gums, where he had coached
her through difficult lessons with a patience that was
inexhaustible, so that she might keep at the top of her class and
pulled among the lilies and the moaning reeds on the lagoon in the
evening. These were sweet memories now that the days were so far
away. Though Ethel was to all appearances heart and pocket light,
and fancy free, at eighteen, she often felt the same regret as
Mark, and could murmur in chorus with him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">The days we lived in the bygone<br>
We'd live if we could again;<br>
We'd pass once more into childhood,<br>
That knoweth no ill or pain;<br>
And we'd romp again as we used to,<br>
So glad on the cool green lea,<br>
And confide our thoughts to each other<br>
In the shade of the old gum tree.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c4" id="c4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>Ethel had just turned from the gate, and was picking a bouquet
for herself, when she was joined by Mr M'Gurren.</p>

<p>"Weel? lassie, are ye na ready for the dance ta-nicht?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr M'Gurren, I'm not ready. I'm not quite decided whether
I'll go or not."</p>

<p>"Not gang to the dance! Oots, lassie! What nonsense have ye got
in yer hud noo?" Mr M'Gurren exclaimed, no little astonished at the
change in Ethel; for, until this evening, she had been all
enthusiasm regarding the ball.</p>

<p>"You may call it nonsense, Mr M'Gurren," answered Ethel, "but
I'd rather stay at home. I'm sure I wouldn't enjoy myself a bit if
I went."</p>

<p>"An' whee not?" He bent forward, and his bushy brows
knitted.</p>

<p>"I expected Liola Battye over; but at the last moment she sent
word that she was going with my cousin Leonard. Then Mark told me
just now that he wouldn't be there. So I am disappointed."</p>

<p>"I see!" said M'Gurren, with that strained look on his face that
comes of trying to appear unconcerned when something has gone
against the grain.</p>

<p>"I wasna 'ware th' lad Keaton cam ta Fairymede," he added.</p>

<p>"He passed here on his way home," Ethel explained.</p>

<p>M'Gurren looked doubtful. "Ye' mither dinna ken ye meetit?" he
said, his glance half questioning, half reproachful.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will tell her, Mr M'Gurren," said Ethel, with a
defiant challenge in her eyes. He flicked a pebble hard with his
walking stick. It flew through the palings and knocked a fowl's eye
out.</p>

<p>"You have only to mention it, you know," Ethel went on, "to stop
Mark from coming through here."</p>

<p>"Ye spek varra familiarly o' th' mon, lassie," rasped M'Gurren.
"Om I ta understund ye are abboot ta mak a match o' it?"</p>

<p>"There no reason for you to do so, Mr M'Gurren," said Ethel,
tartly. "I have known Mr Keaton all my life; and I have always
called him Mark. Why shouldn't I? We were children together."</p>

<p>"That's a' varra weel, lassie. Buit ye never call me Aleck. Ye
ha' kent me syne ye wur a wee thing in short frocks, an' mony's th'
time I dancit ye on my knee, an' sung ye ta sleep. Da ye ken hoo
glud ye used tae be whun I singit 'Bonnie Doon' an' 'My Luv She's
Buit a Lassie Yet'? Ye liked them, lassie, ye liked them. Ye didna
look awa owre the hielans whun I'd have a wad wi' ye, buit ye'd rin
am' sit yesel' doon on' my knee. Ye wur a buxom lassie then, buit
I'm afeart something's gang agley wi' ya o' late. What is it,
lassie? Come, mak a clean breast o' it. Dinna fear I'll telt ony
one."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell, Mr M'Gurren," Ethel answered. "I am
only disappointed."</p>

<p>"Aye, an' a' on account o' young Keaton, not ganging awa' wi' ye
ta th' dance. Ye're foolish, lassie, verra foolish. I've naething
ta sey agin th' lad, buit, for a' that, I wadna like ta see ye
marrit ta him."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked, subduing the rebellious spirit that rose
to demand what it was to him whom she married.</p>

<p>"Because ye've been used ta luxury an' gude coompany. Ye'd want
ta be amang cheerfu' folk, an' in a gude hame. He cudna gi' ye ony
o' them, hooever muckle he'd like ta. He's verra poor, an' ye ken
he spends ta muckle o' his time wi' his books. If th' lad wad gang
awa' an' ploo his lan' and graw something, 'twad be better for him
thon a' his books. He 'll ne'er mak a bawbee wi' his scribblin',
ne'er a bawbee." And Mr M'Gurren shook his head, and drummed his
fingers on the palisading.</p>

<p>Ethel offered no comment. She was a patient little soul, and
preferred to await developments rather than to argue with a
stubborn man, for M'Gurren was stubborn, and no amount of reasoning
could change his opinions once they were formed. He had a secret
dislike, as before stated, for Mark, and did his best, in his own
cunning way, to prejudice Mrs Keaton against her son's literary
efforts. Ethel knew this, and so the futility of attempting to
defend him. Besides, she did not wish the Scotchman to know that
she took an interest in the doings of Mark Keaton. M'Gurren had
long been an admirer, and had the full sympathy and support of Mrs
Lethcote, who put it pretty plainly to the girl that she would be
better pleased with her room than with her company, and that
marriage with him would make them all rich.</p>

<p>At that moment Miss Monaugh put her head&mdash;adorned with curl
papers&mdash;out of the window and called to Ethel.</p>

<p>"Gang awa', lassie, an' get yesel' ready," said M'Gurren. "Dinna
fear, there 'll na be plenty o' laddies there wi'oot Mark Keaton.
I'll dreeve ye there an' bock safe an' soond, an' maybe I'll do a
hop wi' ye mesel' afore th' nicht is owre&mdash;if ye wul gi' me
one. Eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly if I go. I'll see what Aunt Jo says."</p>

<p>"A'richt, lassie. I ken she'll bring ye alang wi' her. She wadna
like ta gang alone wi' me, as that wad set folks talkin' aboot
us."</p>

<p>"And might they not talk about you and me?"</p>

<p>"Not at a'. Dinna be afeart o' that. Ye're a wee laesie yet, an'
they'll ken ye're ta young ta be coortin' for a wee. An' Mistress
Jo wul be wi' us. 'Twul be protection in their e', ye ken. An' I'm
only th' dreever. Sa get yesel' ready, an' I'll gang awa' an' help
ye' faither wi' th' dog-cart."</p>

<p>Lethcote was already engaged in harnessing up the horse at the
stables. Ethel saw now that she had spoken too late. She feared a
scolding from her stepmother if she made known her wish to stay at
home, for that worthy dame had arranged with M'Gurren that they two
should go together, and Aunt Jo&mdash; at her own
invitation&mdash;was to accompany them as chaperon.</p>

<p>It was not her first dance; but her father had taken her on all
previous occasions.</p>

<p>M'Gurren walked round the trap and the horse, tugging at a strap
here, and altering a buckle there, making a purring noise the while
with his lips, which was the nearest approach he could get to a
whistle. Old Myles inwardly resented his interference, and eyed him
in the way that a snake looks at a goana when they meet in a hollow
log. He was nominally lord and master of all Fairymede, including
the trap and the bob-tail nag; but, according to M'Gurren's
demeanour, he was only a flunkey, and the Scotchman was boss. It
was his thoughtless way.</p>

<p>"Has he hud a drink, mon?" asked Mac, patting the horse.</p>

<p>"Take un down an' try un," growled Myles, giving the bellyband a
savage jerk that made the horse jump, and the point of the shaft
prodded M'Gurren in the ribs before he could get out of the
way.</p>

<p>"Carefu', be carefu'!" he cautioned, while Myles glared. He
caught hold of the off wheel and shook it; then went round and
treated the near side wheel in the same way.</p>

<p>"A drap o' ile wadna do her ony 'arm, Lethcote," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"Put'n on then, put'n on," snapped Myles, and he bustled round
as though he had suddenly received a new consignment of energy. Mac
examined the stop, and said it wanted screwing up. Myles gasped,
and his eyes almost shed sparks.</p>

<p>Mac wasn't done yet. He surveyed the turnout as a whole,
standing back and looking under it and round it. "I maun sey it's a
dirty trop ta gae ta toon wi'," he remarked, cheerfully. "A drap o'
water&mdash;"</p>

<p>Myles didn't hear any more. He remembered an engagement
elsewhere, and left in a great hurry. Mac completed the
arrangements, and tied Bobtail to a post, wondering what had come
over Myles to make him so "onfreendly."</p>

<p>"I dunno the reason on't, Jo, but Biddy&mdash;she try to shove
me in th' corner when old Mac's here," Mr Lethcote explained,
seating himself shortly afterwards on the verandah and lighting his
pipe. He was an Englishman and, to look at him, one would take him
to be a perfect gentleman; but, as Miss Monaugh averred, he spoke
like a thrall, and was, to those not used to him, difficult to
understand. He was a silent member, for the most part. He liked to
sit in a quiet corner, with his pipe, and listen. But he was not to
be ignored. He took umbrage if the speakers did not occasionally
look or direct a word his way. Not that he desired to take any part
in the conversation. He did not want them to talk to him
individually, only to talk at him now and again to show that he was
included in the company. M'Gurren was a constant offender in this
respect; his manner was such as to imply that he was ignorant of
the old man's existence.</p>

<p>"Baint as I care for meself; baint fair to Etty," he went on. "I
be her father, Jo."</p>

<p>"So you are," Jo admitted.</p>

<p>"Doant want to have nowt to do wi' un but . . . if un come
pokin' arter Etty, I'll crack un bald head for un, I'll warrant!"
And the old gentleman shook a formidable fist at the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>"You are ridiculous, Myles," said Miss Monaugh. "Mr M'Gurren has
no such intentions."</p>

<p>"I hope not, Jo; but . . . drat un, what un allers comin' here
for? Dratty nigh live here now," Myles exclaimed, scowling across
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"He's an old friend of Biddy's, and comes here simply for
company. There's nobody at Tillalee but his man-servant. (And Biddy
thinks there's no one in this place when Mr M'Gurren's not here.)
But don't be alarmed, Myles. He's not infatuated with
Biddy&mdash;nor with Etty either. You forget that I am one of the
household."</p>

<p>Myles gazed thoughtfully at the grass trying to understand the
situation. When he looked round again she was gone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c5" id="c5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Miss Monaugh was standing before a large mirror in her own room,
her head aslant, and both hands engaged in untwisting one of the
notable curlpapers above her ear. A few tresses hung in crumples, a
few twisted papers lay on the table among a various assortment of
toilet requisites. The door opened, and Ethel entered.</p>

<p>"Why, child, what a time you&rsquo;ve been! I thought you were
never coming. Have you become so very interested in Mr M'Gurren all
at once? One would really think so."</p>

<p>"No, Auntie. At least, I am interested in him in one way."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"I want to get rid of him. Auntie, do me a favour to-night. I
don't want to go to Dumboon."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't want to go! Goodness, child, what's come over you?"
cried the spinster, dropping into a plush-covered chair. Her deft
fingers worked with increased speed.</p>

<p>"Auntie," said Ethel, kneeling on the carpet, and clasping her
hands on Miss Monaugh's lap, "Liela is not coming for me, and Mark
isn't going. So I have no one to take me but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Mr M'Gurren."</p>

<p>"He is taking me, child. You go with us."</p>

<p>"Does mother know of that?" asked Ethel, dubiously.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter a pin what she knows, or what she doesn't
know. Let it suffice that we know it."</p>

<p>"But it wont suffice."</p>

<p>"It will have to."</p>

<p>Ethel leaned her head against her hand.</p>

<p>"Auntie," she said, gently, "you don't understand. M'Gurren
doesn't come here merely as a friend."</p>

<p>"Of course not. I know that." Miss Monaugh was emphatic on that
point.</p>

<p>"But you don't know the truth. Mother," said Ethel, lowering her
voice, "mother wants me to marry him."</p>

<p>"Wants you to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"No, Auntie. She hasn't spoken to me about it. But she has
hinted. So I don't want to go with him to-night."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh had let go her curl-papers, and looked at her niece
with something like dismay depicted in her face. She was a tall,
slight woman, with bent shoulders; and her face, never beautiful,
was faded and withered in advance of her forty years. Some of her
acquaintances accused her of being older but Aunt Jo never owned to
more than thirty-two, and that, she said, was a shocking age for an
un-married woman. Had it not been for her own skill, in the
elaborate use of rouge and prunella, and the constant and lavish
application of cream and buttermilk, Aunt Jo would not only have
been unable to compete on something like equal terms with her more
bounteously-endowed sisters, but would have been irrevocably
doomed. As it was, she kept herself in fair order, and could manage
on a pinch to win a smile from the young ones still. She had a
horror of cold winds, of hard water, and more particularly of a hot
sun, which brought out the freckles like mushrooms after a shower.
And this was a sore trouble to her if there happened to be no
buttermilk or lemons handy, in which case she would resort to
vinola, or glycerine and cucumber, or other mysterious concoctions.
She was a good woman at heart, despite her feminine weakness in the
matter of looks but she dearly wanted to become Mrs Somebody, for
people were wont to call her the old maid, and point her out as one
who had missed her mark, and so was fated to be "miss'd" for the
rest of her days. She had started on a husband's track at
sixteen&mdash;sweet sixteen&mdash;and had pursued it diligently for
twenty-four years without meeting the desired party. Some had
smiled upon her, and loitered awhile in her company then passed on
into the world of the rhodomontadist to tell of their adventures
with "Aunt Jo." This was the only complimentary title she had
achieved outside her own home circle. Her life had been one long
routine of disappointments. Only lately a glimpse of hope had come
to gladden her poor old heart. She had come upon his shadow, and
with a little diplomacy, a little tact and patient vigil, she might
gain her end, and in the near future be Mrs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come here, child." Ethel had sat down on the carpet. "You have
nothing whatever to fear. Never mind what your mother wishes. Treat
it as a farce. It is nothing more. Come here. I want to tell you a
secret. I can talk to you while you are doing my hair for me."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you had any secrets, Auntie," said Ethel, taking
up a position behind the spinster's chair. The latter coughed an
aristocratic little cough and smoothed out her dress.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Etty; I have a great secret," she said, nodding her
head in a way that put the papers in shivers. "I have never
breathed a word of it to anyone, and I wouldn't have it known for
worlds."</p>

<p>"Then don't tell it to me, Auntie," Ethel advised.</p>

<p>"I must, Etty. I must confide in you for your own sake; to show
&nbsp;you that you needn't be afraid. Be careful with that
kiss-curl, dear. It's a favourite. Someone admired it last Sunday.
If you notice, it curves so nicely and naturally. Do you think I
have put enough of the golden fluid on?"</p>

<p>Oh, yes, your hair has a nice glow. It's like a picture."</p>

<p>"That's a bad simile. Pictures are painted artificial, in
fact."</p>

<p>"So's your hair, Auntie&mdash;" Ethel stopped abruptly, abashed
at her own slip. Jo coughed again, and pretended not to notice.</p>

<p>"I'm so sensitive that I'd be worried all night if I thought it
didn't look natural," she resumed. "Women take notice of these
things and pass remarks. Men don't mind so much."</p>

<p>She toyed with her curling tongs for a moment as if irresolute.
Ethel said nothing, but pursued her task with skill and rapidity.
Only, the rustle of the paper was heard. Then, Miss Monaugh
said:</p>

<p>"You are not the romping, gadabout little thing you used to be,
Etty. You are older, and you're getting sense. You are growing into
a woman. And a very nice young woman you'll be. I think you ought
to marry well. But I have noticed that you have grown very grave
lately. I know the cause. I have grown grave too. But you don't
know the cause. That is the secret I am going to tell you. Do be
careful of that curl, child. It's the only good one I have."</p>

<p>"If I damage it, Auntie, I'll buy you another," said Ethel,
smiling in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Now, don't be laughing at me, child," said the spinster. "I
hate to be laughed at."</p>

<p>She had a full view of Ethel's face in the mirror, which that
young lady had momentarily forgotten. She was always in a buoyant
mood in her aunt's company, for Jo was not only her best friend and
only confidante, but her shallowness and over-estimation, of her
own importance amused her. Indeed, Aunt Jo considered herself a
very aristocratic personage&mdash;a step above anything on the
Yeerong as well as an authority on all important matters that vex a
woman's mind. She loved a little romance, and would have been in
the empyrean of happiness could she have drawn around her a veil of
mystery without losing her character, and become the envy of her
common, sisters, and the cynosure of masculine eyes.</p>

<p>"I am not laughing at you, Auntie," Ethel replied.</p>

<p>"I saw you smiling, child," Auntie reproved.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of what Mr M'Gurren said," Ethel answered,
unblushingly.</p>

<p>"Ah! M'Gurren&mdash;What did Mr M'Gurren say?"</p>

<p>"He was talking a lot of rot to me this evening. I believe he's
getting childish. He wants me to call him 'Aleck.' "</p>

<p>Aunt Jo bit her thin lips, and clenched her thin hands. Then she
said: "I am surprised that Mr M'Gurren should have so far forgotten
himself as to make such an improper request. It would be
indelicate&mdash;impudent. No lady addresses a gentleman by his
first name, unless he be some near relation, or, better still, her
betrothed. I am sure you are not betrothed to Mr M'Gurren?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not," said Ethel, with an indignant little
pout."</p>

<p>"You have a lover, I think, Etty. Have you not?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Etty, modestly. "He's only a shadow yet, a
phantom that lurks outside the castle walls."</p>

<p>Aunt Jo didn't quite grasp her meaning. She said "If you have a
lover, why don't you let him in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, nothing like that!" mischievously. "It is sometimes
better to keep him out. Absence, you know, makes the heart grow
fonder."</p>

<p>Jo shook her head slowly. "Tis always the pretty girls that play
the deuce with the boys. I was pretty once&mdash;very pretty. I
hope, when you are my age, you won't regret lost opportunities."
And Miss Monaugh sighed. "With regard to Mr M'Gurren," she went on
presently, "do you think he wishes you to be
his&mdash;er&mdash;sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Auntie."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, child! Don't talk nonsense. Mr M'Gurren has been like
a god-father to you, like an uncle. He has known you since you were
a baby and naturally he takes an interest in you. He has, I
believe, some intention of becoming&mdash;er&mdash;related to the
family, and&mdash; Perhaps that is why he wishes you to call him
'Aleck,' " she interrupted herself as this idea occurred to
her.</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Ethel, with a grimace.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, there is some likelihood," the spinster continued, and
a pleased expression settled on her face. Ethel was puzzled.</p>

<p>"In what way do you think he intends to become related to our
family, Auntie?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"By marriage, of course. You know, he's been coming here very
frequently the last few weeks. He has lost his heart, Etty. That's
the long and the short of it. I've had an opportunity of judging.
I've taken an interest in Mr M'Gurren, and have found out a thing
or two. He's a kind, fatherly sort of man, Etty, and one who could
love deeply&mdash;and I am sure he does. He's not over fifty; just
in the prime of life. His beard is a little grey&mdash;such a nice
beard, though&mdash;and his hair thin&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very!" Ethel interrupted. "In fact,</p>

<p class="verse">'He has no wool on the top of his head,<br>
The place where the wool ought to grow.' "</p>

<p>"Ethel, please don't It's rude. And do be careful of that curl,"
said Jo, peevishly. "I am sure Mr M'Gurren is a very nice man,
considering. He has his faults, like the rest of us. No one is
perfect, and never will be. But he has such nice legs, if he is a
bit awkward with his hands&mdash;or arms. And he has such a nice
manner. He speaks so nicely. I've had an opportunity of judging. A
least bit more of a turn to that curl, dear. That's it."</p>

<p>"Your hair will be beautiful tonight, Auntie," said Ethel,
soothingly.</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll admire it?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Al&mdash;Mr M'Gurren."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, he ought to."</p>

<p>"Etty!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" I&mdash; I can trust you, Etty?"</p>

<p>"Of course you can."</p>

<p>"You will never tell a soul?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Nor whisper it even to yourself?"</p>

<p>No. I can think of it just as well. What is it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I love him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Auntie! You!"</p>

<p>"I am sure, child, there is nothing shocking in that," said the
spinster, frowning.</p>

<p>"Not the least. But I am so surprised. I never thought&mdash;I
never dreamt of such a thing. It seems so strange."</p>

<p>"A woman's love strange! All women are born to love."</p>

<p>"Very often they love in vain."</p>

<p>"I shall not love in vain. You will see to-night. That is why I
am so anxious to go. What a chance! He has never had hold of me
yet&mdash;as he must hold me when we're dancing. He may even
propose. He has hinted&mdash;and looked&mdash; You know the way
they look. I am sure he cares for me. I've had an&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ain't you two nearly ready yit? Bejabers, one 'ud think ye were
goin' to a prize show, or something. How much longer are ye goin'
to be, now thin?" cried Biddy, bursting unceremoniously into the
room.</p>

<p>"We'll be ready in a few minutes, Biddy. I'm just finishing my
hair."</p>

<p>"'H'm!" Biddy sniffed. "D'ye think there'll be room in th' cart
for you, Jo?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, Biddy, do I take up so much room that a cart won't
hold me?"</p>

<p>"There's only wan sate."</p>

<p>"Quite sufficient for three, I should think, especially when
none of us can be accused of being afflicted with obesity. If you
were there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't be there. So just spare your 'ifs,' Johanna, if you
please. An' I dunno phwat th' divil an old scrag like you wants to
be goin' to balls for, ayther. I niver wint. Indade, I could always
get a husband whin I wanted wan widout goin' to balls."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Biddy," cried Jo, bristling up, "if I had been through
the mill as often as you I am sure I wouldn't boast of it."</p>

<p>"You have nothing to boast of at prisent, onyway," snapped
Biddy.</p>

<p>"And if I was a married woman, I'd respect my husband," Jo
continued. "I wouldn't have people coupling my name with another
man's."</p>

<p>"'Twould be the height of flattery to you if they did," Biddy
retorted. "And who may the other man be?"</p>

<p>"I won't mention names," Jo answered.</p>

<p>"Thin don't mintion your dirty insinuations," Biddy returned. "
'Tisn't me that's kapin' the other man from couplin' wid you,
enyway. He wouldn't look at ye if I was dead."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Jo, with frigid innocence.</p>

<p>"Ugh" said Biddy, turning away. "Don't think I can't see y'r
drift. 'Tis as plain as you are, Jo."</p>

<p>Ethel accosted her as she was retreating. "Mother, let me stay.
I have no wish to go. I&mdash;I have a headache."</p>

<p>"You have, indade! Well, take it wid you. I promised to let you
go, an' go you will. So just hurry up."</p>

<p>Ethel was about to expostulate when Aunt Jo tacitly enjoined her
to keep quiet. Biddy tossed her head, with an audible sniff, and
passed into the dining-room. Aunt Jo finished her hair, whilst
Ethel gathered up the pieces of paper she had strewn about.</p>

<p>"Etty, just hand me the things as I want them," said she,
smearing her face and neck with an unlabelled cream. "Take this,
and give me the hare's foot and that pot of pink rouge."</p>

<p>Having put a bloom into her cheeks&mdash;fading away gradually
to the faintest tint under the eyes&mdash;with this, the lady of
punctilious and scrupulous taste requested the powder puff. Next
the eyes and eyebrows were delicately embellished with a water
cosmetique.</p>

<p>"Now give me that stick of lip salve. There&mdash;that's it.
Now, I'm ready. How do I look?"</p>

<p>"Oh, charming," said Ethel.</p>

<p>Jo stumped to the end of the room and back. "How's my carriage?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"As graceful as a yard of pumpwater," answered Ethel.</p>

<p>Jo looked doubtful. She turned and twisted before the mirror,
holding a smaller one in her hand to see the back of her head. "I
think it will do nicely," she concluded.</p>

<p>"It ought to fetch 'em," Ethel rejoined. "Don't use such vulgar
expressions, child," Aunt Jo reproved. And please don't insinuate
that I am titivating myself up to catch&mdash;er&mdash;something
opposite. . . . Men are brutes."</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie!"</p>

<p>"Men are brutes," Miss Monaugh repeated, still smarting from
Biddy's cruel stabs. "I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ethel; "all men are brutes but the man I want. For
him I dress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, dear I dress to please myself."</p>

<p>Ethel laughed softly as she passed into the dining-room on the
old maid's arm. Biddy was furious. Myles smiled from his
corner.</p>

<p>" 'Tis a wondher, Jo," said the irate lady, "you don't commince
in th' mornin'. It takes you such a whoile to doll yeself up that
it's hardly worth goin' at all whin ye're ready to shtart. 'Pon me
sowl, I niver saw the like of you. Sit down an' have your tay, for
God's sake. I'll pass th' cups meself."</p>

<p>"I'm sure there's no occasion for such hurry," the spinster
expostulated. "You needn't get yourself out of breath over nothing.
We've got the whole night before us."</p>

<p>"Indade you haven't. The half of it's gone now. Begob, whin I
was a young girl I've often popped on me duds an' had a fly round,
an' been back agin afore me mistress&mdash;me mother&mdash;missed
me from th' house at all."</p>

<p>"That was wrong to go away without leave."</p>

<p>"Indade! An' who gave you leave, pray?"</p>

<p>"I am my own mistress," Aunt Jo replied defiantly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Biddy from her vantage by the side-table, "ye're
old enough to be, God knows."</p>

<p>"I understood you to say you never went to balls," Aunt Jo
returned, icily.</p>

<p>"It's thrue for me, I didn't," said Biddy. " 'Twas visitin' me
frinds I wint, not leg-sparrin' in a ballroom. 'Twas me dad had th'
derry on thim places. ' 'Tis the ballrooms ruin the gals,' he used
to say. I mind him well,"</p>

<p>"Then why are you so anxious for Etty to go?" Miss Monaugh
inquired.</p>

<p>Biddy suddenly struck a listening attitude. "Was that th' cart
runnin' away wid th' horse, Myles?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It warn't," said Myles.</p>

<p>"I heard something like wheels rattlin', enyway," Biddy
persisted.</p>

<p>"Old hen floppin' off roost," Myles explained, and peace
followed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c6" id="c6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>That night all was bustle and excitement in Dumboon. As a rule
the town was as dull as the Old Man Plain, with scarcely a
pedestrian to be seen along the grassy side-walks and only teams of
struggling oxen and creaking timber trucks, filing at intervals
through the streets, and raising clouds of dust in passing.
To-night there was a fair crowd at the principal corner, and in
front of the pub, which stood opposite the "Assembly Rooms," a
noisy lot from the Upper Yeerong&mdash;the "Cedar Push"&mdash;had
congregated.</p>

<p>A mixed few were gathered in the ballroom. The
instruments&mdash;a violin and a concertina&mdash;were already
screeching and screaming when the dogcart from Fairymede drove up,
and there alighted from it Mr M'Gurren, Ethel and Aunt Jo. The
first dance was just concluded, and the two ladies had hardly
dismembered themselves of their wraps when the Master of Ceremonies
requested the gentlemen to "S'lect partners for the fust set o'
quadrilles."</p>

<p>"This is oor dance, lassie," said M'Gurren, as Ethel entered on
Aunt Jo's arm. The spinster frowned, and looked furtively around
her, in search of a probable partner. It would be so embarrassing
to have the companionship of Ethel taken from her. There were
several men present whom she had smiled with in her time, but these
had their quantum of female. For a small back-block town, there was
a distressing quantity of female to be provided for, wherever they
came from.</p>

<p>"I wish you would excuse me, Mr M'Gurren," said Ethel. "I've
hardly had time to get my breath yet, and I'd rather sit it out. I
don't like the figures, and there's such a crowd geting
up&mdash;I'm afraid there will scarcely be room. Do let us rest
awhile&mdash;or, perhaps you and Aunt Jo&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was concluded with an appealing look towards the
latter lady. Of course, it was a preconcerted arrangement that Aunt
Jo was to have the monopoly as far as possible in the matter of
dancing with the laird of Tillalee. She saw that her aunt would
have a poor chance of obtaining a better chevalier among that
assemblage, whose majority was composed of the roughs, and, ever
indulgent to her, Ethel was prepared to forgo her own desire to
dance rather than be an obstacle to her aunt. But M'Gurren was
obdurate.</p>

<p>"Oots lassie, ye mauna sit doon in the cauld. Coom alang noo,
an' dinna brek y'r promise. I ken your auntie winna lack for a
partner th' nicht."</p>

<p>He spoke with some asperity; there was even anger in his voice.
Ethel, without further demur, took his proffered arm and permitted
him to lead her away. Soon the music started, and she was mixed in
the rapidly-moving throng, passing in and out in a continual dizzy
maze.</p>

<p>"It's a strange thing," mused Aunt Jo, sitting down to wait
until good fortune should attend her, "that a man is always chary
of the one he loves on these occasions. Now, if he had loved Etty
he would have asked me to dance and ignored her. I don't quite
understand it&mdash;I suppose I will some day. Perhaps he doesn't
want the public to know he cares for me, though, forsooth, he
needn't be ashamed of me. Perhaps he wants to try me, to make me
jealous. But he needn't trouble&mdash;I'm not jealous." And she
tossed her head in scorn.</p>

<p>Seated on her left were Bill Sooley, in hob-nailed bluchers, and
Amelia Jane, in thirsty 'lastic-sides&mdash;the elastic much
stretched. She moved closer to address Amelia Jane, when both got
up to fill a vacancy in the squares left by the retirement of a
couple at the far end. Aunt Jo could scarcely conceal her
annoyance. Everybody, it seemed, was going to dance. She was the
only wallflower, the only one destined to look on in silence,
denied the unique privilege and the rare pleasure associated with
the dance. It could not be the fault of her looks&mdash;there were
many there who were plainer; her hair was done up in faultless
style, her dress was perfect and becoming yet she was the only
woman there unasked.</p>

<p>She sat it through, contenting herself with the self-assurance
that Mr M'Gurren would take her up in the next. It was a
schottische, and, next to a waltz, that was a favourite with her.
She heard him ask Ethel for it, and heard her tell him that she was
engaged, though it did not appear to her that such was the case.
Then, with glaring eyes, she saw him lead the extra-corpulent,
red-faced Mrs Cadby, the publican's wife, down the hall! Aunt Jo
was fairly vexed, and sought relief in an ante-room. About the
middle of the dance her privacy was intruded upon by two persons
whom she had not wished to meet there. They were Ethel's cousin,
Leonard Lynton, and Miss Liela Battye.</p>

<p>"Why, Jo, what are you doing here?" the latter exclaimed, and
her cheeks went a deeper pink.</p>

<p>"I came in here for a little peace, Liela. I feel so tired after
my drive. I don't know how it is, driving tires me dreadfully of
late. It didn't use to. And those men are so persistent. When one
tells them she doesn't want to dance, isn't that enough? You would
think so. But they won't take no for an answer. No less than seven
begged me to get up with them in the schottische. It's very
annoying. So I had to run away and hide myself. They're such a
nuisance. Are you not dancing, Liela?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But we have only just arrived; and we're a little too
late," answered Liela, who was a pretty little coquette of nineteen
or twenty, the one ewe lamb of Braxton Battye, of Murrawang.
Leonard's uncle, Edwin Lynton, a gentleman-farmer of moderate
means, was Battye's nearest neighbour.</p>

<p>"I think we'll remove to the ballroom, Liela," said Leonard.
"Won't you take a turn at all to-night, Jo? I'm surprised to see
you running away from the boys. You'll never get a husband if you
do that."</p>

<p>"Oh, Leonard, you shock me! A husband! Do you imagine for a
moment that I'd have a husband?"</p>

<p>"Why not? You surely do not intend to die an old maid?"</p>

<p>"I am not otherwise minded, Leonard. There is no disgrace in
that. An old maid, I should think, is deserving of the respect of
all good people. Her state is a credit and an honour. It shows
strength and courage in having resisted the temptations of the
vulgar sex."</p>

<p>"Not always," said Leonard, practically. "Many become virtuous
old maids through the want of temptation. In any case, it's against
Nature. You are shirking your duty to her. It may be in you as in
any other woman, to contribute the strong hand that is always
wanted at the country's helm."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Aunt Jo, smiling demurely, "if all men were like you,
Leonard, I might be prevailed upon to change my mind. But they are
unjust and cruel. They consider themselves woman's superior in
everything. She is man's slave. He commands, and she must obey. Do
you call that fair?"</p>

<p>"She has the power, by her finer qualities, her natural
gentleness and love, to make man all that could be desired," said
Liela, smiling sweetly into Leonard's face. Aunt Jo felt envious, a
little bitter.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes." she said, most girls at your age fall in
love&mdash;they have no control over themselves; and they are apt
to exaggerate far too much for their future happiness. They see
things only with a lover's eyes and you know Cupid attaches an
invisible though beautifying lens to the orbs of his victim and
each in her clientele thinks she has found an angel, and that the
world is a paradise. By-and-bye the veil will be torn away, and
they'll wake up as from a dream. I've had an opportunity of
judging."</p>

<p>"Miss Monaugh," said Leonard, gravely, "you are a
traitress&mdash;you are a mistake! Liela, I can't allow you to
remain longer in such company. Miss Monaugh, I trust, will change
her views and join us presently. Otherwise, the finger of scorn
will be pointed at her."</p>

<p>"Do you really think, Leonard, she means what she says?" Liela
asked as they left Aunt Jo to her own thoughts. Leonard
laughed.</p>

<p>"She'd buckle up this minute if she had the chance. She's as
ugly as virtue, and as flat as a slab. Only a marooned
ourang-outang would get enthusiastic over poor old Jo."</p>

<p>But the old maid thought she had scored a point. She could not
for a moment have it supposed that she remained single for want of
an alternative. To the general public she must appear a woman of
rigidly moral principles, who considered it contaminating to hold
intercourse or associate frequently with the opposite sex when such
was avoidable. She was in reality a little pious&mdash;as little as
she could afford to be. She liked truth, honesty and goodness in
others; but never scrupled to tell a white lie herself when the
truth was inconvenient.</p>

<p>She sat listening to the music, and the trip of many
feet&mdash;sounds that intensify a woman's feelings, and fill her
with longing. Presently she heard voices near her, and the language
was a jarring discord.</p>

<p>"By gosh!" said a deep bass voice, "I'm sweatin' like a 'orse.
Been on the go ever since I come. Reg'lar flyer that larst piece I
'ad. Hang me if I could hold her times. Thought it was a she
wallaby I'd bumped agin. Dyer know her, Crowbar?"</p>

<p>"Never clapped eyes on her afore. Wot dyer think o' Dick th'
Walloper?"</p>

<p>"He's goin' it 'ammer an' tongs. An' twig th' capers o' Roarin'
Tom! Blow me if I could keep it jiggin' at that pace. Think you
could, Doodlum Buck?"</p>

<p>"Not me. Doan b'lieve in it. 'D ruther 'ave a long shandy."</p>

<p>"Doan mind if I do. Works wants a bit o' lubricatin' after
swingin' them heifers."</p>

<p>"Ribuek. Hulloa here's' Kilfloggin. Tip us yer flipper. An' how
yer poppin' up?"</p>

<p>"Fusrate. How goes it with you coves?"</p>

<p>"Tip-top. How's Sarah from th' Dairy tickle yer fancy eh?"</p>

<p>"Yum-yum! Too sudding. Arst her up jest' now, an' got a look
that was frosty enough to make hair grow on a window pane. She's
collared on Abe Watts&mdash;stickin' to him like a leech. No one
else es got a look in. Not es I care a hang personly. I'm off
her."</p>

<p>"Wal, le's go an' 'ave a drink, an' a pull o' the pipe."</p>

<p>Aunt Jo returned to the ballroom, which was now pretty well
crowded. It was a strange medley, and everyone seemed to be dancing
and enjoying themselves except Aunt Jo. She felt extremely small,
and began to fancy that every-body was looking at her, and laughing
at her solitude. She was sorry she had come; she vowed she would
never come again.</p>

<p>"There's too much larrikinism and impropriety going on at
diversions of this sort," she remarked to a young woman who sat
near her, fanning her flushed face. Just then a tall
bullock-driver, in corduroys, striped shirt and black coat,
accosted her. "Hingaged, miss?"</p>

<p>"I am not dancing, thank you," said Aunt Jo, with much
satisfaction, for Mr M'Gurren had just come up in time to hear the
words that were interchanged.</p>

<p>"Whee lass, I havena seen ye oop once ta-nicht," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I didn't feel in the humour for dancing, Mr M'Gurren," she
answered in her sweetest manner. "I've been enjoying myself looking
on."</p>

<p>"Buit ye maun shake a leg ta," said M'Gurren. "Wul ye have a
short squeeze' wi' me? Eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; Mr M'Gurren." Jo assented, with a most enravishing
smile. "I have refused everyone till now. But you are the only one
with whom I care to dance. We are used to each other. And in a
crowded room like this one wants a good partner. It's not an easy
task getting round without a mishap of some sort."</p>

<p>"Dinna be afeart aboot that. I wadna ask ye at a' if I thought
there was a danger. I've been roond mony a time the nicht, an I ken
there's room for a'. Ye maun ken the step, that's a."</p>

<p>Aunt Jo was in raptures as she joined the throng of enthusiasts
for the first time that long and tedious night; but the next
instant she nearly dropped to the floor as she caught the words of
the bullock-driver, whom she had refused a moment before.</p>

<p>"Say Kilfloggin, d'yer see that wry faced old hag bobbin' about
there?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Why&mdash;that's&mdash;Aunt Jo!"</p>

<p>"Yais. The old tomcat told me jes' now she didn't darnce. Only
arst her out o' pity&mdash;she looked so lonely holdin' the wall up
be herself. An' look at her with Moneybags! S'pose I warn't good
enough for her. Aint got enough beans. Wot won't money do, eh? By
cripes, she do make me laugh!"</p>

<p>Other remarks were made about the way she hopped, and some of
the younger girls even giggled as she panted past them, and
altogether made things unpleasant for Aunt Jo. The rough-shod scrub
men bumped her heavily, and once she was knocked off her feet.
M'Gurren, in trying to save her, went down on top of her. The
building shook, and several couples dropped on to the seats in
paroxysms of laughter.</p>

<p>"I theenk we'd better sit down, lass," said M'Gurren, kindly.
But Aunt Jo wouldn't hear of it. She whirled on furiously, with
tears of indignation in her eyes, and swung hard against every
female she could reach, especially the married ones. The
timber-getters took up the gauntlet, and bumped her more than ever.
They went out of their way to meet her, and each collision was
accompanied by ribald jest. One would yell out, "Whoa there! wild
cattle from the Mooni!" Shortly another would send her reeling
towards the centre, and shout as he swung on, "Gee off, Bismarck!"
A third would swing out arid drive her back to the tune of "Stand
over, Brown!"</p>

<p>Finally, Kilfloggin, who had been watching the proceedings with
a sullen look, bumped one of the jokers heavily on the jaw, and the
dance ended in a short but gory fight. Kilfloggin gained the
victory also a black eye.</p>

<p>Aunt Jo, having lost Mr M'Gurren in the confusion, retreated
hurriedly to the ante-room, panting like a knocked up dog. She said
she would never again be induced to go among the libertines that
convene at a bush dance. And she wasn't.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c7" id="c7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>A few days later Leonard called at Gimbo. The house, which had a
garden all round it, with two large mulberry trees in the back
corners, and a front awning of grape vines and honeysuckle, stood
on the prettiest of the Yeerong hills. It looked out upon a long
stretch of moorland, near the head of the lagoon which coursed
round Fairymede. A raised red road ran across it between the
boundaries, over which the cedar teams passed into Dumboon. That
red road was engraven on Mark's memory. He and Ethel used to meet
and part there when they went to school.</p>

<p>As usual, Mark was sitting behind a plodding pen.</p>

<p>"Now then, old boy," said Leonard, haven't you had enough of
that for one day?"</p>

<p>"Never have enough of it," answered Mark. "Think I was born for
it."</p>

<p>"Don't know how you stick to it like you do," Leonard went on.
"One day would kill me."</p>

<p>"You weren't intended for a novelist," said Mark. "I've been at
it for years, and I love it now more than ever."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from the publishers yet?" asked Leonard.</p>

<p>"Got a letter yesterday," answered Mark.</p>

<p>"How did the first book get on?"</p>

<p>"It's waiting for postage to come back."</p>

<p>"And the second?"</p>

<p>"It wants postage too."</p>

<p>"What about the third?"</p>

<p>"It also wants postage."</p>

<p>"Must cost you a tidy sum for stamps," Leonard remarked.</p>

<p>"A good bit," Mark admitted. "That's the result of living in the
bush."</p>

<p>"What are you doing now?"</p>

<p>"The fourth."</p>

<p>"Better chuck it, old man," said Leonard, kindly.</p>

<p>"No," said Mark. "I'm confident I'll succeed some day. I've been
assured by two or three who saw my work that they've often read
worse. I don't allow everyone to see them. I like a man who'll tell
me exactly what he thinks, not seek to flatter me with undeserved
praise."</p>

<p>"Quite right," his friend agreed. "I've read some of your tales,
and I can assure you I spoke my mind concerning them. If you take
my advice you won't write any more like them." Mark tried to look
pleasant. "I told you The Sundowner was too serious," Leonard went
on. "I don't say it couldn't be read through if a man put his mind
to it but there are books, you know, that are harder to read than
chopping wood. Another thing, your hero gets mixed. 'Dunno where he
are' half his time. But&mdash;we've had enough of books for
once"&mdash;with an impatient half-turn on his heel. "Let's go for
a walk. I've got something to tell you, and perhaps I'll be able to
do you a good turn." He nodded towards Fairymede.</p>

<p>Mark was putting on his coat when Mrs Keaton came into the
room.</p>

<p>"Are you off, Leonard?" she inquired, standing in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Have an appointment at the bridge," Leonard answered.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the widow archly, "is that the way the wind blows?
Goin' to see Ethel Lethcote. I thought she was Mark's girl."</p>

<p>"I didn't know she was anybody's girl," Mark said, sulkily.</p>

<p>"Well, she ain't yours, it seems." She made a wry face and
looked towards the red road. "You're too quiet for her&mdash;an'
too slow to catch a cold."</p>

<p>Mark hurried away. He was a little afraid of his mother. As they
turned their backs to the gate, a whip-crack bounded in the
distance. Leonard looked up and laughed.</p>

<p>"Was thinking of Abe Watts," he said, and chuckled again.</p>

<p>What about him?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"One of his bullocks&mdash;Yellowman, he called him&mdash;was
lying down in the yoke as I crossed the road. Abe was prodding him
and twisting his tail and cursing him by turns. Couldn't get so
much, as a grunt out of him. 'That fellow would be better in a cask
than in the team,' I said to him. 'It's a bloomin' pity Bill Sooley
warn't in th' cask with him,' says Abe viciously. 'Swopped me that
crawlin' cow for a spankin' good steer. Sed he could pull like Bill
Beach. By cripes, I'll be one with him. You'll see!' Sooley came
along behind, singing:</p>

<p class="verse">'If I 'ad a 'orse an' he wouldn't go,<br>
Wouldn't I whack him&mdash;no, no, no!'</p>

<p>" 'Wot th' jiggins d'yer do with a bullock that won't go?' says
Abe, sulkily. 'Tell yer fusrate plan,' says Bill, leaning on his
whip. 'Put yer mouth to his ear an' whistle. Takes his mind off
everything else, an' fetches him to his feet in one act.' Abe took
hold of Yellowman's ear, and, thrusting his mouth through the hair,
blew a sharp and sudden blast down the orifice. Yellowman snorted,
and, swinging his big head round, struck Abe on the jaw and knocked
him sprawling in the dust. Then he jumped up and kicked Abe in the
commissariat department, and rushed into the yoke so hard that he
shifted the jinker himself. 'Heerd tell that was a good dodge,'
said Sooley. 'Ye'll know how to manage Yellowman now.' Abe got up
slowly, rubbing his stomach, and spitting out dust. He scowled
across his shoulder as he brushed his helmet, then, walked away in
dead silence."</p>

<p>"Ominous," said Mark. "He'll get back on Sooley before many
days."</p>

<p>"I bet he will," said Leonard. "The other evening Abe went
fishing in Big Hole. Half an hour afterwards Sooley strolled down
for a dip, and found him asleep, with the line hitched to his leg.
He stripped behind a bush, hauled that line up, and cut the hook
off; then he gripped the sinker in his hand, and dived quietly into
the hole with it. A couple of tugs woke Abe, and in a second or two
he was on his feet, bristling with excitement, and hauling in hand
over hand. 'By cripes,' he says, as he gets the full weight of it,
' 's th' old man cod what's been nabbin' hooks 'ere for th' last
forty year.' Bill wriggled and twisted a bit to show he was a live
fish but 'twas like hauling up a log all the same. He had no
propelling force where his tail should be, and he wanted a pull at
the atmosphere pretty bad. He shot up close to the bank, threshing
the water like a harpooned whale. His head and face were covered
with weeds, and as soon as he's out he rears over the first ledge
of bank and astonishes Abe with a snort that would have shamed a
koala. Abe's eyes bulged. 'What in thunder ken that be!' he gasped,
backing away. 'Bow-wow-wow!' barked the fish, making a scramble
after him. Abe dropped the line and cut up that bank like a whipped
dog. Bill washed the mud off himself, and followed with his clothes
under his arm. Abe was at the camp, wildly excited, telling the
other men about the monster. By this time it had red eyes, as large
as saucers, a green mane and tail, four tremendous legs, and claws
ten inches long. 'Never saw th' like of it,' says Abe. 'Never heerd
th' like of it. 'Twarnt no known animal, I'll swear.' Bill walked
up. 'Here's your tackle, Abe Watts,' he says. 'Darned hard lines if
a man can't go for a dive 'thout gettin' hooked an hauled up like a
blamed fish!' The men roared, and poor Abe slunk away to hide
himself."</p>

<p>"A day or two later, when they'd finished rafting, Abe called
out to Sooley, who was paring a lash for his whip. 'Hey, Bill, look
'ere!' He pointed out a boomer kangaroo, standing bolt upright
about two hundred yards away. 'What about some 'rootail soup?' Bill
whipped in and got his rifle. 'He's mine, first pop,' he says,
dropping on his knee. He fired at the chest, but, the roo didn't
fall. It never moved. 'Must 'a' been something wrong with that
cartridge,' says Bill, puzzled. He examined the next, put it in
carefully, and fired again. Same result. 'Why, I thought you could
shoot!' says Abe. 'Danged if I ken make it out,' says Bill. 'Swear
them shots hit.' 'Strange he didn't move,' says Abe. 'Didn't so
much as wince.' 'Never saw a blamed 'roo stand fire like it,' says
Bill. 'Mus' be hard o' hearin',' says Abe. He's lookin' straight at
us, whether-or-no,' says Bill. 'Mus' be par-blind, too,' says Abe.
Another slug was presented to him. Still he stood. 'Well, that
beats all!' says Bill. ' 'S either paralysed with fright, or he
died standin'. Reckon I'll alter his attitude 'fore I'm done with
him.' He walked towards the animal, loading as he went. Fifty yards
off he fired again. No impression. Then he walked right up, sidled
round him, prodded him with the gun fore and aft, and peered into
his eyes. Then Bill pulled him savagely by the ear, and his head
fell over, showing the top of a stake and some dry grass sticking
up through the skin. When Bill came back, he was about the maddest
man ever seen around Big Hole."</p>

<p>They had barely crossed the house paddock when Kilfloggin
thumped into Mrs Keaton's front room. He had lately taken an
interest in that lady.</p>

<p>"Seen yer son, an' 'air gaw'n Fairymede way," Kilfloggin
remarked, flopping into a chair, and spinning his hat under the
table. S'pose yo'll soon be 'avin' a weddin' in th' fam'ly?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;who's there to get married?" asked the widow,
surprised.</p>

<p>"Mark."</p>

<p>"Phugh! He can't keep himself, let 'lone a wife. He's stuck in
that room there, an' not a word out of him, from jackass to mopoke,
an' from mopoke to jackass agin. I tell him if ever he gets married
his wife 'ill run away from him the fust week."</p>

<p>"Too much edjecation, missus, too much on't. 'S all very well
for them as is rich an' ken afford to put on airs an' live up to
it, but for a poor man it spells ruin. Spoils him every way yer
look at it."</p>

<p>"It's spoilt him, 't any rate. I told th' old man it would at
th' outset. I sed as sure as eggs wasn't onions he'd be a ruined
man if he got too much edjecation. An' wasn't I right?"</p>

<p>"You was, missus. There's no two ways about that."</p>

<p>"There's Luke an' Eustace." the widow went on. " 'S there anyone
on the Yeerong can drive bullocks or use a cross-cut saw better'n
they can?"</p>

<p>"There ain't. They was real bobby-dazzlers, them boys."</p>

<p>"An' you should just hear Luke singin'!"</p>

<p>"Heerd him, missus. Fine singer, Luke,"</p>

<p>" 'Way down upon th' Swanee River' was a great favourite of his.
He could sing it grand. I used to sit on that doorstep, a nights
listen in' when Eustace 'ud be on th' woodheap with th' concertina,
an' Luke 'ud be lyin' on his back on th' grass, singin' th'
'Swanee."</p>

<p>"Could play the jews-harp a bit, too," Kilfloggin added,
spitting on the cat; and wiping his mouth with his arm. "Use ter
like ter hear him."</p>

<p>"He was the jolliest of the fam'ly, th' only one with any music
in him. The others couldn't so much as whistle a toon. Luke was
full o' fun. Plenty o' life in th' place when he was 'ome."</p>

<p>"Aye, Luke was the rollickin' sort."</p>

<p>"Bit fond of his nip, like his father. That's his only fault.
We'd all been well off if 't 'adn't been for Hugh drinkin' so, an'
fillin' that boy's head with a lot o' rot. 'S right enough, I use
to tell him, to have enough learnin' in the fam'ly to make up a
log, but we've got no use for any more. 'S like learnin' 'Melia
Jane to play the goana, as old Peter was talkin' o' doin' once. Ah,
well, he's gone now, poor old feller, an' there's no use stirrin'
up old sores."</p>

<p>"Not a bit o' use."</p>

<p>"I only hope Luke won't turn out like the old man. One thing,
he's got Eustace with him, an' that might keep him straight."</p>

<p>"Aye, Eustace 'll keep a pull on him. They'll be comin' 'ome
some day with a good stockin' for y'r."</p>

<p>"God send they will. I'd be sure 'o' what Eustace had. He was
always good-hearted, an' never kept a penny from me. Luke's seldom
got any to give. Fools it away. Mark's the stingy one. He'd skin a
flea for its hide. But he wont work 'cept at them books. He'll go
mad over 'em yet. Mad as a hatter."</p>

<p>"He will; no two ways about that."</p>

<p>"He hasn't enough edjecation to be a real scholar, an' too much
to be a man."</p>

<p>"That's it. Ye've jus' sed it, missis. He ought to go out an'
jine his brothers. They're th' coves 'ud make a man of him. P'rhaps
they'll take him out when they come."</p>

<p>"I wish to God they would."</p>

<p>"Le's 'ave a drop on the strength of it, missus," said
Kilfloggin, with a shy look, at the same time extracting a flask
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"You're a terrible man, George," the widow reproved. "You're
goin' from bad to worse." And she shook her head and looked
sad.</p>

<p>George grinned;. "Come on," he said persuasively. "Wish 'em luck
in a good old nobbler."</p>

<p>"It's the curse o' the country, George," she said, eyeing the
bottle. "It's been the ruin o' many a good fam'ly, but&mdash;" Her
lips were getting dry. &mdash;"Still, there's no 'arm in havin' a
glass now'n agin. Does good at times if taken in mod'ration."</p>

<p>"Them's my sentiments. 'S all right es long's yer know when to
put the peg in."</p>

<p>"What I use to tell the old man," said the widow, rising. " 'Now
Hugh,' I'd say, it's time to put the peg in.' 'S all right, Mary,'
he 'd say. 'We'll put him in by'n-bye.' He would, too."</p>

<p>"When the keg was empty," added George.</p>

<p>"When the keg was empty," the widow repeated, swallowing as the
dryness went down her throat. "Them kegs was the devil's own. Ye'd
see one strapped on top of every jinker that went out after pay
day, an' there'd be carousin' an' fightin' to no end up at th'
mountains. Th' old hands swallered more cedar logs that way an'
ever you seen, George. 'Twas th' drunkenest crick this as ever run
water."</p>

<p>George shook the bottle and held it up to the light.</p>

<p>"Good head," he said.</p>

<p>"Wait till I get the tumblers, George," she enjoined, and
bustled out.</p>

<h2><a name="c8" id="c8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>Mark and Leonard waited at the log bridge that spanned an arm of
the lagoon separating Fairymede from Gimbo. Here was a cluster of
willows overhanging the water, a few rustic seats, and a family
boat moored at the end of a rough plank. It was an old trysting
place, where, as Biddy put it, "many a poor fool had sowed trouble
for future rapin';" and it was here that Aunt Jo dreamt her dreams
of the sweet by-and-bye.</p>

<p>"We are too early," said Leonard, lightning a cigarette. Mark
did not smoke. He was too mean, his mother said.</p>

<p>"Whom are we here to meet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Girls," said' Leonard. He threw himself down on the grass under
the willows. "I've been wanting to tell you a secret ever since the
ball," he went on. "You missed a treat by not going&mdash;and Ethel
missed you."</p>

<p>"D'you think so?" asked Mark, quickly.</p>

<p>"Sure of it. Why didn't you come?"</p>

<p>"Because old Mac carried too many guns. Seems to have the inside
running, confound him."</p>

<p>'"You're making a bloomer," said Leonard. "Your chances are as
good as mine were. I carried my heart in my boots, as you are doing
now. But while the knot's untied there's hope. I pegged
away&mdash;quietly; and to-day I'm the happiest sinner on the
Yeerong."</p>

<p>"So you have won the monopoly?" said Mark.</p>

<p>"Yes, old fellow; she's my copyright," laughed Leonard.</p>

<p>"You're lucky," said Mark, seriously, while his mind pictured
all manner of delightfully amorous scenes, and his eyes wore that
envious look of a fruitless lover listening to the rhapsodies of a
more fortunate swain. "She's a good little girl&mdash;the second
best about here."</p>

<p>"The second best! Who, then, is the best?"</p>

<p>"Ethel."</p>

<p>Leonard smiled. "Of course," he said, "every man considers his
own bit of property the nonpareil. She is par excellence the
sweetest and dearest on earth. We'll not quarrel over that. It's
only natural that you and I, running on separate tracks, should
hold different opinions on this subject."</p>

<p>"Just as well it is so," said Mark, "or we would both be in love
with Ethel. That would be a misfortune."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Rivals can never be friends. We'd be cutting each other's
throats."</p>

<p>"More likely you'd be cutting your own in the background," said
Leonard. "Old M'Gurren's got you flogging now&mdash;and I'd treat
M'Gurren as a joke." Mark glared at the lagoon and chewed grass.
"You are too backward; too slow, in fact," Leonard continued. "A
woman likes a cheerful, fearless man. Ethel is naturally gay, but
she's hobbled. She's at the beck and call of a heartless duenna.
Why don't you stiffen your backbone and oust M'Gurren?"</p>

<p>Mark's face flushed, and his cheeks quivered for an instant. "Do
you mean to tell me," he cried, "that he would marry Ethel?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;if he could."</p>

<p>"He can't though?"</p>

<p>"He can."</p>

<p>Mark bit his lip. A flock of parrots swooped over them. Their
screechings sounded afar off. "I don't believe it!" he said, with
suppressed passion. "Ethel's got too much spirit to marry an old
reprobate like him. He's old enough to be a child's playmate, and
she's not mercenary enough to take his wealth into consideration.
There's nothing mercenary in her nature."</p>

<p>"There is in her stepmother's. She got on the soft side of Myles
Lethcote for his stocking, and she'll sell Ethel for
M'Gurren's."</p>

<p>"And would you stand by and see her do it?"</p>

<p>"How can I interfere?"</p>

<p>"You are Ethel's cousin."</p>

<p>"That doesn't give me the right to oppose her father and
stepmother."</p>

<p>"Surely her father is not a party to it?"</p>

<p>"He's only a mere automaton. He has to lump what Biddy likes. He
owns up."</p>

<p>"Then he's no man!" Mark asseverated.</p>

<p>"He's good-hearted, but he's got no backbone," Leonard
interposed.</p>

<p>"A henpecked husband is a contemptible creature." Mark
persisted. "I'd like to see the woman who would get the better of
me."</p>

<p>"Don't crow," said Leonard. "Seems to me you're just about
beaten now." He nodded towards Fairymede. "You are letting Ethel
drift further and further from you, while M'Gurren follows her like
a poodle. I'd like her to be your wife, but if you dally much
longer you'll lose her. There's too much procrastination about you
for good-fortune to be your hand-maiden. Buck up to her as if you
owned creation. There's only one road to take in
love&mdash;straight ahead. Doesn't matter how much you stumble and
blunder. The main thing is to keep on."</p>

<p>Mark was accustomed to this kind of plain speaking from Leonard.
He remained silent for some time, pulling blades of grass and
nibbling them, his brow knitted in meditation. Leonard did not
interrupt him. He hoped he had at last instilled some determination
in this fluctuating lover.</p>

<p>Presently he said: "Tell me how you did it&mdash;what you said,
and what she said."</p>

<p>"Don't remember exactly," said Leonard. "Proposals are usually
foolish&mdash;as seen by others."</p>

<p>"As seen by cold-blooded mortals and useless old prudes,"
corrected Mark. "You've been through the mill. I might profit by
your experience."</p>

<p>"I don't think you would," said Leonard. "Frankly, I had my
little speech prepared six months beforehand. I used to be
proposing morn, noon and night. I'd lay awake half the night
thinking about it, and mope around all day talking to myself. I
practised an anticipatory dialogue smart, witty and complimentary
what I would lead off with, what she would be likely to reply, and
what I would say to that; and so on till I got her in my arms."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Mark, brightening up.</p>

<p>"All wasted effort," said Leonard. "Ready-made speeches are the
hardest to say when you get the girl in front of you. And she
doesn't say the things she ought, and her actions don't fit. She's
got you bogged in five seconds. Best way is not to think anything
till the opportunity occurs&mdash;then jump into the first opening
she gives you&mdash;say whatever comes handy."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Well, we were looking at the stars (astronomy's a fine
supplementary subject when you're courting; study astronomy), and
she remarked that it was a beautiful night. That was an
opening&mdash;and I braced myself up at once and jumped in.
'Everything's beautiful where you are,' I said."</p>

<p>"What did she say to that?"</p>

<p>"She said, 'That'll do you now!' and looked at me sideways, and
tittered a little bit, you know. That was encouraging, I could see
she was pleased."</p>

<p>"Yes but what did you say then?"</p>

<p>"I said, 'I mean it.' Then I put my arm round her quickly, and
said, 'Liela, I love you!' "</p>

<p>"Ah! And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said, 'Oh, get out!' and tried to pull away."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"I said, 'I do, really.' "</p>

<p>"And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Only hung her head, looked pleased&mdash;and
blushed."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"Hugged her and kissed her."</p>

<p>"Good What did she say to that?"</p>

<p>"Only looked more pleased, and blushed furiously."</p>

<p>"And what happened next?"</p>

<p>"Her old man happened, next. He popped round the corner
suddenly, and he said, 'Hulloa what are you doing here?' I was a
bit flabbergasted, and could only grin. You know the fierce way he
fixes his eyes on you, and stares, with his head thrust forward. He
made no wriggle. We were always first-rate friends, Battye and I,
though he was going to help me off his premises with a stockwhip
once for taking the loan of a horse of his without asking. I
reckoned he'd just about shoot me for taking his daughter. But
seemingly the daughter wasn't as important as the horse."</p>

<p>"You were always a lucky beggar," said Mark, enviously. "If
Biddy had caught me like that with Ethel, I'd have been poll-axed
on the spot."</p>

<p>"Here they come!" Leonard interrupted.</p>

<p>Mark gazed up the track for a moment with flushed cheeks. Ethel
and Liela were coming towards them, leading Aunt Jo and M'Gurren by
nearly half a mile.</p>

<p>"Looks dainty enough to touch the heart of a wheelbarrow," he
said, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's a fine girl," Leonard agreed. "Are you going to put
it to her?"</p>

<p>"I must."</p>

<p>"Go up to her and spit it straight out. Girls like spirit."</p>

<p>They met. A few trite remarks and some maidenly tittering
followed, then Leonard marched off with Liela. Mark stood alone
with Ethel, looking as cheerful as a bear with a sore head. His
heart was thumping into his neck; five minutes later it might have
been a brick he had swallowed by the cold, dead feel of it.</p>

<p>And Leonard, happiest of mortals, dawdling slowly homeward with
his little sweetheart under his wing, and admiring the beauty of
the evening, and everything mundane, never guessed that Mark's
love, like his manuscripts, had been declined with thanks."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c9" id="c9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>Miss Monaugh and Mr M'Gurren strolled slowly towards the willow
trees. The spinster was in excellent spirits, and talked more
flippantly than was her wont. She felt that this was a triumph not
to be lightly passed over&mdash;her walking along with the bird of
Tillalee when Ethel was going the same way. He knew nothing of the
plans that had been carefully concocted before leaving Fairymede
House, or perhaps the two younger ladies would not have eluded him
so easily and gone on ahead.</p>

<p>"We'd form quite a delightful procession from the tryst if we
all went afoot," said the spinster meaningly. "Three couples, one
behind the other."</p>

<p>"I canna see more'n two," said M'Gurren, looking suspiciously in
front.</p>

<p>"We are not all paired yet,&quot; the spinster answered. "Mark
and Leonard are under the willows. See, the girls are now joining
them. Don't you think, Mr M'Gurren, that they would make two
excellent matches&mdash;Leonard and Liela, and Mark and Ethel?"</p>

<p>"I ken Leonard an' Miss Battye are engeeged ta be marrit, buit I
dinna ken muckle aboot th' relationship o' the other twa. Buit she
wadna be sa foolish as ta rin after one o' his ilk, wad she?"</p>

<p>"Surely you have nothing to say against Mr Keaton? He's a good,
honest young fellow, and a gentleman every inch of him. I know that
for certain. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>"That's richt enou', buit he's poor, varra poor."</p>

<p>"What of that? Were not the best of Scotland's heroes poor? Was
not Robbie Burns poor?"</p>

<p>"Dinna coompare a skit o' a mon like that wi' Rabbie Burns. He
was a guid laddie ta his parents. He didna loaf on them like this
mooncalf here. I wadna gi' a bawbee for a mon that cudna earn a
bannock wi' the pattle or the whop, or one that cudna gang awa'
frae his mither's appron strings."</p>

<p>" 'He's a man for a' that,' " the spinster quoted. "As to not
being able to earn a bannock&mdash;whatever that may be&mdash;let
me say, Mr M'Gurren, that Mark works harder than many of those who
accuse him of being a loafer. He's a clever man, and he'd be an
excellent match, I consider, for Ethel. They are so much of an age.
He may be poor as a bandicoot now, but he has good picking before
him."</p>

<p>"I canna see it," said M'Gurren. &quot; 'Tis mair likely he'll
ga ta the dogs a'tagither. He's not unco strang ta work."</p>

<p>"He's not built for a navvy or a cedar-getter but he's got
brains. He's following the avocation that Nature fitted him for. I
hope, Mr M'Gurren, it isn't prejudice that makes you speak so
disparagingly of Mark Keaton?"</p>

<p>"Na, na. I hae varra mickle agin the lad. I dinna like ta see
him carryin' on wi' Ethel in this fashion, that's a'. Her mither
wad make muckle ta do if she kent they meetit at the breedge."</p>

<p>"I actually believe, Mr M'Gurren, that you are jealous."</p>

<p>"Na, na; dinna say that," M'Gurren protested hurriedly.</p>

<p>"You give me that impression," the spinster returned vengefully.
"There's no more impropriety in her meeting Mr Keaton at the bridge
than there is in our walking together. He didn't meet her by
appointment either. It was merely chance. He came, it seems to me,
for an outing with Leonard."</p>

<p>"Buit he mauna kent Leonard was camit ta meet his sweetheart. I
speer Leonard telt him ta cam ta make luv ta Ethel."</p>

<p>"What if he did?" said Miss Monaugh, defiantly. "If Mark is not
a proper person to make love to Ethel, who is? I can think of no
one more suitable for her among the people of the Yeerong. As I
said, he's just the age&mdash;about three or four years her senior.
I hold that no woman should think of marrying a man who is more
than four years older than herself until she has reached the age
of&mdash;er&mdash;thirty. It isn't proper; it's often a sin. Many
who have passed their prime, for instance, like to marry young
girls. There is no love in such matches, only a morbid desire on
the part of the beastly male person. The girl is sacrificed on the
altar of Mammon. It's slavery, pure and simple. Does he not buy the
girl? And is she not in bondage for life? God grant that Ethel will
never be made the victim of such heinous practices. Let her have
love in a bark hut rather than be a slave in a castle. There's no
happiness in ill-assorted marriages. Money can't buy it. I've never
been married myself, but I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>They had now reached the bridge. Leonard and Liela had gone on,
waving their adieux from a distance, and Mark and Ethel stood with
downcast faces behind the willows. The spinster had a quick eye,
and she discerned in an instant that the subject under discussion
was a serious one. She took little heed of this, for Mark was
generally grave and meditative, even when others were rippling with
merriment. Her attention was more occupied with Mr M'Gurren. He was
angry, she could see, and he watched the young couple with an ugly
frown. Even when mere civility demanded a reply to some frivolous
question, he spoke in an altered tone to her, and shot glances
their way that were like flashes of fire. She was puzzled, and was
conscious of a chilly fear creeping over her. She dreaded
something, but she hardly knew yet what that something was. She had
a vague idea that things were not progressing as she wished, that
M'Gurren's fancy was riveted on Ethel&mdash;not on her. In
confirmation of this, there cropped up the remembrance of his
preferment of Ethel at the ball, and the recollection of a remark
passed by the unscrupulous Kilfloggin, that "Ol' Porridge-pot was
breakin' his blamed neck after th' little piece o' Lethcote's."
Many other little incidents she recalled, giving credence to her
suspicions; but she trusted Ethel too implicitly to suspect her of
any conspiracy. If Ethel was a rival at all, it was unwittingly.
She was aware that Biddy had base designs on "Moneybags," but the
thought that he would be willing to gratify that sordid desire had
never entered her mind. She must speak to Ethel. This evening they
two would be alone, and she must be acquainted with everything,
or&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fetch the lassie alang noo, Mis Monaugh, an' I'll get the boat
ready," M'Gurren broke in abruptly, bustling about and knocking
himself out of breath in his eagerness to get the ladies on board
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The bottom of the boat was strewn with willow leaves which had
to be cleaned out; the rowlocks had to be fixed in their places,
and the oars got out, and the seats cleaned. Aunt Jo, instead of
joining Ethel, sat down on one of the rustic seats and watched
operations. This exasperated M'Gurren, who was now very red in the
face, and perspiring like a water-cart. He didn't speak, and Jo was
too pre-occupied to make any comment. She wished to leave Mark and
Ethel together till the last moment, and then to have a word with
the young man before they started to row round to Fairymede. But
when she turned round, intent upon that object, she found herself
face to face with Ethel, and saw Mark, already out of earshot,
hurrying homewards. Then M'Gurren, thinking they were yet in
company, and before he had hardly completed his task, cried out
sharply:</p>

<p>"Noo then, cam alang wi' ye, an' let's gang awa' hame. The nicht
i' camin' on, an' we have a lang pull, I ken."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Mr M'Gurren, that it would be better to leave
the boat where it is and walk back?" Ethel protested. After her
interview with Mark, she dreaded being shut up in that small boat
under the eyes of Aunt Jo and M'Gurren. It would occupy the latter
an hour to pull round, and that time now would seem a week to
Ethel.</p>

<p>She was sorry for Mark. She was pale and excited, and waves of
emotion swept through her at times choking her utterance. She
wanted to get home, to be in her own room, where she could think it
all over, and perhaps "have a good cry." But M'Gurren was not to be
denied. He pulled the boat well up to the landing, and held it
there so that they could step in safely. When they were seated, and
the boat had been pushed off, M'Gurren, taking a precautionary look
around him by way of preface, gave vent to his pent-up feelings in
an abusive outburst against the "moon-calf," holding forth that it
was ungentlemanly; illustrative of ill-breeding, in fact, "to rin
awa' wi'oot e'en a word or a nod to a body. Heigh!" continued the
irate M'Gurren, "nin buit the roughs o' Yeerong wad da sich a
thing. Ta rin awa' wi'oot takin' leave o' a body! Weel, weel, that
beats a'!" And he laughed, a low, gurgling laugh that had little of
mirth in it.</p>

<p>Twice Ethel essayed to speak, and each time a lump seemed to
rise in her throat. At last she broke down, and tears trickled
silently through her fingers as she sat bowed in the stern of the
boat.</p>

<p>For a moment M'Gurren stared, then swung his oars savagely.
Unfortunately, he missed the water on each side, and fell on his
neck over the seat. Jo laughed. She couldn't help it. M'Gurren,
very red in the face, and breathing like a half-winded horse,
scrambled up, and got into swing again with the energy of a
bull-ant on a hot shovel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c10" id="c10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>Aunt Jo monopolised M'Gurren as much as possible, to allow Ethel
to regain her composure. She had never before been in such
perplexity, and her heart was weighted with doubts and misgivings.
She was certain of four things: That Ethel loved Mark Keaton; that
they had quarrelled and parted; that M'Gurren loved or wanted
Ethel; and that the course of her own true love thenceforth could
not run smooth. She was angry with both. And M'Gurren was morose
and taciturn. Consequently the conversation was difficult, and
intervals of painful silence were frequent. He was uncertain and
jerky in his rowing, and twice went near to capsizing the boat. The
lagoon was not an easy course for an amateur to take a boat over
patches of reeds and water-lilies frequently intervened, in which
one or other of the oars would become entangled. Now the left would
be dipped far down into the water, while the other would skim over
the surface, and M'Gurren would nearly go on his neck again; then
he would run her nose into a clump of reeds, and bring down a
shower of furry blossoms that smothered their heads and stuck to
their dresses. Nor was this all. At every second or third stroke a
shower of water went flying over them; and the climax was reached
when M'Gurren, by an awkward lurch, let one of his oars drop in the
stream.</p>

<p>"Dear me," cried Aunt Jo, unable to restrain herself any longer,
"what a treat you are giving us! Hadn't we belter pull ashore?
We'll have an accident."</p>

<p>"Bide a wee," said M'Gurren irritably. "We're gettin' alang
fine&mdash;considerin' I havna hondled a blade for twa months.
We'll be hame in guid time, lassies. I maun be mair heedfu' o the
weeds, that's a'."</p>

<p>He paddled back as one would paddle a canoe, and then Aunt Jo
picked up the floating oar. M'Gurren held out his hand for it, but
Aunt Jo had no intention of surrendering it.</p>

<p>"I am going to help navigate this craft," she announced, with
decision.</p>

<p>"Dinna trooble, lass, dinna trooble yesel'," M'Gurren objected.
"Ah can pull her hame mesel'."</p>

<p>"No, you can't. "It's sundown&mdash;or very near it and this is
a dangerous place to be benighted in. We are wet too. We'll catch
our death of cold if we don't hurry."</p>

<p>It was a cruel little speech, and M'Gurren looked pained.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, lass, ta have wet ye," he said, with genuine
contriteness. " 'Twa on accoont o' the weeds. But there's a clear
stretch ahud noo, an' I'll pull her hame wi'oot a splash."</p>

<p>"No, you wont," said Aunt Jo stoutly. "The exercise is good for
me, and I'm going to pull an oar."</p>

<p>She sat down beside the disconcerted Scotchman, and commenced to
use the oar with more dexterity and vigour than he was able to
show. Ethel, alone in the stern, and finding it trying to her
nerves to remain inertly facing the rowers, took up a short plank
that lay at her feet, and with this improvised rudder steered the
craft safely through the intricacies of the winding, reed-grown
lagoon.</p>

<p>M'Gurren was ill-pleased at the change. He showed it in his
face, and in the manner of his rowing. To be deprived of an oar was
a slur against his ability as a waterman, and to he ousted from his
position of a leader by a woman was, before Ethel, a degradation
not to be permitted to pass unavenged. He watched his
opportunities, and when a huge clump of rushes loomed up before
them, or a snag appeared dangerously near, he threw all his
strength into his stroke to slew the boat round so that she would
strike. He didn't care if he perished himself, as long as he
succeeded in wrecking "that pree-posterous woman." But, to his
chagrin, he saw them passed untouched. Aunt Jo appeared to be
pulling with the greatest ease; he was exerting himself to the
utmost. He grew redder in the face, and breathed hard and short.
Yet her simple, easy stroke counterbalanced his, and try as he
would to force her round, the boat sped serenely on. At last he
paused from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Losh, wuman, I maun sey ye pull a fine strook," he panted,
looking in a dazed and wondering manner at his companion's slender
arms. "I dinna ken hoo it is," he continued, with a mystified air.
"Ye dinna seem ta put muckle power int' ye strook, an' yet I canna
mak ony mair impression on her thon yesel', an' I maun sey I pull
unco hard. I canna mak it oot at a."</p>

<p>"Have you been trying to force her round to show that your
strength is greater than mine?" Jo asked indignantly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll telt the truth, I have. I cudna stund bein' beaten
by a wuman," M'Gurren confessed, wiping the teeming perspiration
from his heated face.</p>

<p>"You've knocked yourself up," said Jo, placidly. "I thought you
were getting rather short in your strokes."</p>

<p>"I kepit time." M'Gurren returned. "Buit I cudna get her
roond."</p>

<p>"You were silly to try. You know, M'Gurren," pursued Aunt Jo in
her most affable manner, "brute strength is little use when pitted
against science. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>M'Gurren had forgotten that Ethel was steering the boat,
otherwise he might have been tempted to try his brute strength
against the spinster's science. She was glad when a diversion
occurred. Round a sharp point they came abreast of an old man
fishing on the bank. This was Myles Lethcote, seated under a broad
straw hat, his rod across his knee, complacently smoking a short
pipe and waiting with his accustomed patience for a bite. Fishing
and reading absorbed most of his time when Biddy wasn't in her
tantrums and giving him the rounds of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Weel, mon, have ye cochit ony fush the day?" asked M'Gurren,
grasping the excuse for a rest with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Five on 'em," Myles answered.</p>

<p>"Guid, varra guid!"</p>

<p>Myles had four very little ones behind a tussock, and one big
one. He held up the big one as a sample put it down and held it up
again, repeating the performance until he had apparently shown five
different fish.</p>

<p>"Losh, they're fine specimens," said M'Gurren. "What i' aboon
the weicht o' them?"</p>

<p>"Purty near three pun, I'll warrant," said Myles. "Nowt t'what
unhooked while ago. Fetched un all but top an' lost un. Didn't
let'n take un far 'nough 'fore I gin haul un in. Been chuckin'
round for hour or more, spectin' he'd come back. Baint seen nowt on
him since, though."</p>

<p>"He wont coom bock, mon," said M'Gurren, with the air of a man
who knew all about the ways of fish. "Get aboord here, an' we'll
tak' ye alang hame wi' us. Ye cochit enough the day."</p>

<p>Myles shook his head, and shifted the pipe to the other side of
his mouth. "E'll come back," he said. " 'N' if I get half a chance
at un, I'll nab un next shot."</p>

<p>"Why, pa, it may be a bunyip," Ethel suggested, laughing for the
first time since they had started.</p>

<p>"Shugh!" said Myles, and shifted his pipe again.</p>

<p>"He dinna b'lieve in the bunyip," said M'Gurren, chuckling.</p>

<p>The fisherman's back seemed to straighten. "Didna ever see
bunyip, Mac?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Na, I canna sey I've seen one; buit I've heard tellit o' 'whops
of 'em. I ken th' bunyip i' the big fush that awa's gets awa,
mon."</p>

<p>Aunt Jo saved the situation for Myles. "There's some awfully big
eels in this lagoon, though, and they come up from the bottom after
sundown. Let's be getting home."</p>

<p>"Oots, wuman!" said M'Gurren. "Are ye afrud of an eel? They
winna da ye the bit o' harm."</p>

<p>Aunt Jo shrugged her shoulders. "I shouldn't like to try them,"
she said. "They're horrid things."</p>

<p>They lay to their oars again and left the old man fishing, a
satisfied smile making curves round the stem of his pipe. At the
boatshed they disembarked. M'Gurren and Ethel went homewards
together! They dawdled along, at the former's request, to allow
Aunt Jo to draw away from them. This she did with more readiness
than might have been expected but Aunt Jo had "good reasons." When
she had got beyond earshot, M'Gurren took Ethel's arm in a fatherly
fashion and said:</p>

<p>"Ye didna seem varra hoppy this afternoon, lassie. Did ye fa'
oot wi' the lad frae Gimbo?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr M'Gurren," Ethel answered simply.</p>

<p>"Ye creed i' the boat, lassie!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have ye ony trouble?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Ethel refused to be drawn out. M'Gurren was at a loss for an
explanation. She kept her face persistently from him, and he was
obliged to stoop his broad shoulders when speaking to her. Mrs
Lethcote, bubbling over with excitement and expectancy, at this
interesting juncture was standing on tip-toe at the lattice window,
which commanded a full view of the long straight path, and watching
every movement of the approaching twain. Aunt Jo, somewhat
flurried, and panting from the prodigious exertion of walking up
the incline, came in and joined her.</p>

<p>"The Lord bless ye, Jo! Ye did fine to come away an' lave thim
together," Mrs Lethcote ejaculated. "He's proposin', Jo! D'ye see
how he's bindin' over her. That's how y'r brother Pat&mdash;God
rist his bones&mdash;bint over me whin he popped the
question&mdash;his hand just so, his head a bit av a skew. Ah! now
she's squintin' at him. Lord bless us, say yis, darlint! Ye've got
your chancer now. Pon me sowl, she'll be Mrs M'Gurren afore the
year's out. Ah, they've shtopt! Didn't I tell you so? They're
havin' the usual bit av a blarney, d'ye mind. Ah&mdash;good! Ooh
drat him, he's put his hands behind him&mdash;no! Well done, me
boy&mdash;he's comin' agin! Be jabers, he's too slow for a funeral.
Why th' divil don't he hug the colleen!"</p>

<p>Aunt Jo's heart was going pit-a-pat, and she observed the
movements of the loiterers with envious eyes. If he would only bend
over her like that; if her ears could catch the tender words meant
only for Ethel; How slowly the time seemed, to drag away. Each
moment seemed an hour, and it appeared that the time when she would
be alone with Ethel would never come. But she heard it all at last,
and it gave her a problem to solve.</p>

<p>At the moment when she had seen them stop, M'Gurren was
saying;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's na use talkin', lassie, I ken ye na hoppy wi ye mither.
She's varra poor, an' I wad like ta help her. I have a fine hoose
owre the loch, buit it's unco lonely by mesel'. I want a wife o' my
ain, d'ye ken. Wul ye coom, lassie, an' share it wi' me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr M'Gurren, please don't ask me!" Ethel cried
affrightedly. "I can't leave my father yet. He's very good to
me."</p>

<p>"Then let's get marrit, an' ye can be guid ta him. I am a wee
bit auld, lassie, buit I am rich, an' I'll gi' ye enough for a'.
He'll live in coomfort an' peace wi' ye mither then, an' Aunt Jo
wul bide wi' us at Tillalee. They telt me yestreen that onless ye
marrit money ye'd have ta gang ta service, an' ye faither maun wuk
like Kilfloggin an' Abe Watts."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" Ethel cried, almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Ye mither tauld me," M'Gurren answered her. "I'd be laith ta
see ye baith wukin' awa' like flunkies whun there's na need ta. An'
ye can dreeve aboot yesel' in fine frocks instud. I spuk ta ye
mither yestreen, an she consentit. Sa ye have only ta sey th' wad,
lassie, an' ye troubles wul be owre."</p>

<p>"My troubles are only just beginning," said Ethel, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>She was agitated. The crisis she had long dreaded was upon her.
Various pictures of the future, resultant upon this or that
decision, flashed through her mind. Poor Ethel! She recognised the
impossibility of remaining longer with her step-mother if she
refused to marry money now that it was offered her. The thought
that poor old pater should have to give up angling for "big uns,"
and go scrub-cutting or something, was the sorest point. For him
she had rejected Mark Keaton. But Myles would sooner be shot than
see her married to M'Gurren. He wanted her near him; but her
presence could not save him from the threatened cropper if she did
not respect the wishes of his better-half. She felt weak.</p>

<p>"Dinna fash aboon troubles, lassie," M'Gurren rejoined. "Gi' me
ye bond, an' I'll mak ye my bonny bride. I'll dreeve ye owre the
hielans in the gig, an' row ye owre the loch; an' evra nicht I'll
singit ye auld favourite sangs&mdash;'My Lav She's Buit a Lassie
Yet,' an' 'Auld Robin Gray.' "</p>

<p>"I know you mean well, Mr M'Gurren, and&mdash;if you really love
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dinna doobt it, lassie," M'Gurren broke in gleefully. "I canna
spak as I ought ta, buit&mdash;I luv ye. I luv ye!"</p>

<p>"Then have pity&mdash;spare me. Oh, spare me!" Ethel cried,
breaking down.</p>

<p>M'Gurren's jaw dropped as though someone had hit him. "Oots,
lassie," he said, roughly, "ye canna ask for mair'n I wad give
ye."</p>

<p>"I am too young to marry," she went on, piteously. "Don't ask me
till I'm twenty. I'll give you my answer then. Grant me
that&mdash;if only that,"</p>

<p>M'Gurren did not respond. He was looking down, and tapping his
foot on the ground. Ethel sighed, and continued:</p>

<p>"My step-mother would force me to marry for money. She doesn't
like me. She wants to get rid of me&mdash;wants to sell me. She's
cruel and selfish. If you love me, don't be her cat's
paw&mdash;don't buy me."</p>

<p>M'Gurren stared at the landscape, looking stunned.</p>

<p>"Tell her nothing of what's passed between us," Ethel went on,
"or she'll pay me out somehow. I didn't mean to tell you
this&mdash;I don't know what I'm saying. Let it end
here&mdash;till&mdash;till I'm twenty."</p>

<p>"Bide a wee. Gin I promise ta mention it na mair tul ye twenty,
wul ye promise ta drap a' intercourse wi' the lad frae Gimbo?"</p>

<p>"All intercourse between us has already ceased."</p>

<p>"Varra quid. Ye ha' my promise."</p>

<p>"And you won't tell my step-mother what took place here this
evening?" asked Ethel, speaking with a little more calmness, though
there was still a frightened look in her eyes. M'Gurren pitied her.
She looked such a helpless little thing standing there, timid and
trembling. He took her hand and fondled it between his own.</p>

<p>"Na, lassie," he answered, more tenderly. "I wad like ye ta be
my ain, buit I dinna want ye ta be onhoppy. Sa have ye way, lassie,
have ye way."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Ethel. As soon as she reached her room Mrs
Lethcote rushed after her.</p>

<p>"Phwat did he say?" she whispered excitedly. "Phwat was he
sayin?"</p>

<p>"He was telling me about the beautiful house he has at
Tillalee."</p>

<p>"Aye?"</p>

<p>"And he asked me would I like to live there."</p>

<p>"Good! An', you towld him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought I would like it."</p>

<p>"Good agin! Phwat did he say to that?"</p>

<p>"Some day I might. I was too young yet."</p>

<p>The lightning change in Biddy's face was almost pathetic.</p>

<p>"Too young yet!" she shrieked. "God sake, does the blitherin'
old fool think ye'r a grane sugar plum or something that 'ill spile
be pluckin'! Too young at aighteen! 'Tis precious little he knows
about wimmen. The owld shrimp!"</p>

<p>"When I was twenty he would ask me to share it with him," Ethel
hurried on.</p>

<p>"Share phwat?" asked Biddy.</p>

<p>"His beautiful house," said Ethel.</p>

<p>"His beautiful fiddleshticks!" Biddy snorted. "Whin ye're twinty
indade!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," Ethel answered.</p>

<p>"The loggerjowl! Phwat's he thinkin' about at all, at all?"</p>

<p>She stood frowning at the wall, her hands on her hips. Ethel,
timid and anxious, toyed with her bangle. She feared, not so much
her step-mother's imperiousness now that a compromise had been
arranged with Mr M'Gurren, but that her duplicity would be
discovered if she were subjected to much cross-questioning.</p>

<p>Presently Biddy inquired: "Phwat did you say to him thin?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say anything," Ethel answered.</p>

<p>"Ye couldn't 'ave sed much less, indade," Biddy retorted.
"Bedad, ye deserve to go to th' washtub, ye do. Whin an illigant
squireen comes a-courtin' ye, an' ye shtand like a booby an' let
him think ye're a bit av a chicken. Did I ever hear th' like of
it!" And the old lady swung sharply, and stamped away with
fireworks in her heels.</p>

<p>Ethel heaved a sigh of relief, and flew to the motherly arms of
Aunt Jo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c11" id="c11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>Mark had become more solitary in his habits than ever, and, like
Myles, spent much of his time fishing. It wasn't a very exciting
diversion for a jilted lover, but it led him to a discovery that
stirred the devil in him. He was sitting in a shaded nook, where he
was screened from view by overhanging lillipillies and wild cherry
trees, nursing a crooked rod, and watching a monotonous floater.
Presently voices disturbed his quietude, and a moment later he
recognised Kilfloggin and "Crowbar." They were on the same errand
as himself, both carrying their whipsticks, the whips being rolled
tightly round them, and a fishing line dangling from the small end
of each. This saved the trouble of cutting special rods.</p>

<p>Mark looked about for a means of escape. He didn't want to meet
those kind of people. They always asked him, with a grin up their
sleeves, "hadn't he got a job yet?" It was humiliating to admit
even that he wanted such a low thing as a job. He hauled in his
lines quickly, and, not having time to slip away unseen, he hid
himself in the thick undergrowth. To his chagrin, they threw down
their tackle close by, and commenced fishing. Under the
circumstances, he could do nothing but remain like a crouching
rabbit until they went away, as discovery now would be doubly
embarrassing. They were in a talkative mood, and soon he was
listening attentively.</p>

<p>"So yer goin' ter spend yer Sunday at Gimbo," Crowbar was
saying; "Whatcher little game there?"</p>

<p>"Jes' wait awhile. Got a good thing on. Sumthin' better'n
roughin' it in them man-killin' scrubs," Kilfloggin replied.</p>

<p>"I see!" said Crowbar. "Hangin' yer hat up to ther widder,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Got it on th' peg, me boy. Goin' ter be spliced soon. This is
strickly confidential, mind yer. Whatcher think of it?"</p>

<p>"Wal, dang me if it don't beat cockfightin'. A wild scrag of a
scrub warrior like you puttin' th' yoke on Widder Keaton. S' must
be kinder 'ard up."</p>

<p>"Hard up be hanged! Reckon I'm good enough for Widder Keaton eny
day. She's not one o' them as goes in for finery, an' puttin' on
airs, an' that sort o' tomfoolery. 'S rough an' ready as they make
'em. Jes' my style to a T. Ye'll see me spare-chainin' her up ter
parson's 'fore long. Won't I cut a shine then!"</p>

<p>"Wot about Lord Muck, th' pote? He'll bite a bit, I reckon."</p>

<p>"He'll bite sumthin' purty hard, you make no error. Wait till
we're hitched up all tight an' square, an' I'll let him know wot
for. I prog-nos-ticate there'll be a lively-bust-up in that fam'ly.
'Tween me an' you an' th' gate post, I've put up with a' lot of his
foppishness for th' sake of old Mary. Why, dynamite his eyes, he's
too almighty big to look th' way we're goin'. Like Mad Sambo down
at th' dairy. Sacked th' best qualified worker he ever 'ad 'cause
th' feller was too much of a white man to crawl round him like a
grovellin' worm. . . . I only took th' job to oblige him while I
was spellin' me bullocks."</p>

<p>"Oh, you was th' bloke wot flung th' dish o' butter over
Sambo?"</p>

<p>"I was. By th' jumpin' Jemima, it took a fall out of him. Lapped
round his mug bewtyful."</p>

<p>"Did yer go back for yer wages?" asked Crowbar.</p>

<p>"I didn't. Wouldn't touch his dirty stuff if he brought it to
me," Kilfloggin answered. "But Mr High-an'-mighty Mark Keaton
Esquire needn't try that game on," he resumed: I'll 'ave it all out
of him, take my tip. Got a spare team, 'n if he don't like to go
an' portify that he ken put a coil in his bluey an' get. I'll 'ave
none of him. 'S a bit too sudding for me."</p>

<p>"Time he chucked th' titty-bottle onyway," said Crowbar.</p>

<p>"I mean ter yoke up th' widder," Kilfloggin went on. "But darn
me if goin' to find grass for th' whole herd of 'em like some
do."</p>

<p>"Ye'd be a chump if yer did," Crowbar rejoined. "I wish yer
luck, ol' man. That's more'n we're 'avin' 'ere, so wot's 'say if we
shift?"</p>

<p>"Jes' as well. Bitin' tarnation slow ter-day. Wanted ter get a
couple extra purtikler too. Ol' gel likes fish, she do."</p>

<p>When they had gone Mark stepped out of his hiding place, filled
with loathing and disgust for his prospective stepfather and
angered with his mother for contemplating the espousal of "a fellow
like that."</p>

<p>As he plodded over the hills he encountered Leonard, who was on
his way home from Dumboon.</p>

<p>"Great bit of fun yesterday," he said, dismounting.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Mark, absently. He was still thinking of
the threatened increase in the family.</p>

<p>"You know, Abe Watts has been breaking his neck for some time to
get home on Sooley. Same time he didn't allow it to be suspected
that he bore any malice, being on the most friendly terms with the
long person. Sooley has the faculty of grasping his opportunities
at a moment's notice, but Abe is a slow mover, and the amount of
brain work he did after that crowning indignity on Red Road was
prodigious. The inspiration came when he saw Peter Johnson driving
home from town with a horse called Stopdead in the shafts of the
spring cart. That horse has one characteristic the thought of which
so pleased Abe that he even patted Yellowman as he unyoked him at
the campingplace. The bullocks were turned up the flat by Peter's
selection for the night. Abe took them up, and rode back on
Stopdead. Said he'd bought him for fifteen quid. Sooley said he was
a fool; the horse was no good. 'Jes' get on an' try him,' says Abe.
Canters like a racin' 'orse, an' ken jump anything with hide on.
Dirt cheap, I reckon.' Sooley got on, smoking, and took a twist or
two out of him. 'Fair ter middlin' he says. Bit hard in the mouth.'
'Try him at th' gutter.' says Abe. 'Go over like a bird, ye'll
find.' The gutter was about ten feet wide, with a foot or two of
water in it, covered with weeds, and very boggy. Bill went a long
way back, and pelted at it with arms and legs and reins swinging.
Doesn't ride as well as he shoots. Abe was standing near the
take-off, and just as Stopdead was going to leap, he yells out
'Whey!' sharp and sudden. The old horse acted up to his name. He
stopped dead&mdash;but Sooley didn't. He shot head first into the
gutter like a frog off a rail. Abe just waited to see him regain
his perpendicular&mdash;with a heap of mud and weeds dripping from
his head. Then he remembered that Johnson wanted the horse at 6.21
sharp, and raced away to keep the appointment."</p>

<p>"Thought he bought the horse?" queried Mark, as cheerfully as
Bill Sooley might have said it after he had combed the weeds and
crayfish out of his hair.</p>

<p>"Bought him be hanged! Just borrowed him to chuck Sooley. Didn't
get back till midnight, having spent the evening exaggerating the
circumstance to Peter Johnson. Sooley was in bed, and Abe was
getting in very quietly when his feet touched something deadly
cold. It was a warm night, but the contact made him feel like an
iceberg. If you remember, he had seven years' growth frightened out
of him once in the scrubs. Woke up one night and felt a snake
crawling under his shirt. Had to lie mighty still while Sooley got
a light and a waddy and as soon as Sooley saw the shirt move he
gave Abe a most unmerciful welt across that part of him where his
supper was digesting. Explained afterwards that he'd forgotten, in
his excitement, that Abe was under the snake. Abe upended like
dynamite, knocked Sooley through the tent, and stood over the fire
till the snake was rooted out and exterminated.</p>

<p>"Well, feeling the cold thing the other night, his hair
bristled, and he bounded out double quick, and yelled out to Sooley
to light up. But Mr Sooley was in an extra heavy sleep and didn't
hear. He snored loudly in confirmation. Abe got the lantern and a
stick, and searched carefully all round then he turned the blankets
back very gently with the stick, and discovered a wet shirt, the
one Sooley had taken his mud bath in, tightly rolled up. Abe
clutched it vengefully, and was tip-toeing towards Bill's bunk when
the long one sprang out and cut away through the bush like a
startled emu. Abe after him with the wet shirt; but Sooley had too
much foot. Chased him half way to Johnson's, then went back and
chopped up a lot of horsehair and sprinkled it in Bill's bunk. Bill
was very restless after he turned in again, and got up earlier than
usual. They cried quits at breakfast time."</p>

<p>Mark walked along in moody silence. He rarely fraternised with
the bullockdrivers, and the yarn only riveted his mind on the
horrible idea of calling Kilfloggin "father."</p>

<p>"I want you to come with us tomorrow," Leonard said, after a
long pause. "I'm taking Liela and Etty to the mountains for a
ride."</p>

<p>Mark shook his head. "We don't speak now," he explained.</p>

<p>"What! has it come to that?" cried Leonard. "What's
happened?"</p>

<p>"She declined me&mdash;I mean," Mark stammered, "she won't have
me."</p>

<p>"The deuce!" said Leonard, pacing steadily, through the grass.
"I'm sure she cares for you. I could stake my life on it."</p>

<p>"She has a queer way of showing it," Mark rejoined.</p>

<p>"It's as I tell you; she's tied to M'Gurren. You must wrest her
from him. Keep your pecker up. A woman's 'no' means nothing."</p>

<p>"Then how can a woman's promise be relied upon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they always mean 'yes.' I'll try and get to the bottom of
this first time I'm alone with Etty. I'll put Mac's pot on if
there's a possible, anyway."</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when they separated; and Mark received
another shock when he reached home. His mother had a visitor for
supper, and that visitor was his now deadly enemy, Kilfloggin. On
the table stood a black bottle, explaining the cause of his
mother's flushed face and garrulity. Mark's brow clouded, and there
was an ominous look in his eyes as he approached the table. He
stopped near the bibulous visitor; and, looking from one to the
other, said:</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, Wrightson? Is it your intention to
make my mother a hog like yourself?"</p>

<p>Wrightson guffawed. "It 'ud take Goramighty to make a hog of a
sow," he said. "Eh, old woman?" Then he turned slowly round in his
chair and faced the old woman's son. "Look 'ere, young' un, if I am
a drunkard it's me own money I get drunk on. You make no error
about that. I'm not a sponger, strike me blue blind if I am. An'
there's no 'arm es I ken see in havin' a friendly nip with yer
mother. She was jes' tellin' me es how she's got a letter from Luke
an' Eustace, who's out Mackinlay way breakin' 'orses, an' makin'
two quid a week an' we've been drinkin' their good healths."</p>

<p>"Luke an' Eustace are both well off, while you've 'ardly a boot
to yer foot," his mother added. "Ye'd better go to work now while
ye've got the chance. George says he's got a spare team, an' he'll
give you the job o' drivin' it."</p>

<p>"Mr George is very anxious to get me out of the way no doubt,"
said Mark. "I happen to know his intentions. Before I'll lift a
whip for him I'll go barefooted."</p>

<p>"It's what ye'll soon have to," his mother retorted. "Ye'll have
to go an' do something. I can't keep you.</p>

<p>"Would you see me driving bullocks for a fellow like that?"</p>

<p>He pointed a scathing finger at the oxen proprietor, while
keeping his gaze on his mother.</p>

<p>"An' who are you that you shouldn't drive bullocks?" that lady
demanded. "Your poor old father wasn't too stuck up to do it."</p>

<p>"He was a man, he was," said George. "Twas an honour ter drive
on th' same road with him."</p>

<p>"The honour was very much one-sided," Mark returned.</p>

<p>Kilfloggin drew his feet in and threw his head forward. "Young
feller," he said, "yer ought ter be ashamed o' yerself. Go an'
buckle to it like a white man, not be a loafer all th' days o' yer
life&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mark's fist shot out suddenly. George blocked it neatly with his
mouth, and fell over a chair. He staggered to his feet, looking
ugly. Mark picked up the chair and poked him through the doorway
with the leg of it.</p>

<p>"Now take yourself off," he cried. "And don't dare put a foot
inside my paddock again."</p>

<p>"Don't bust yourself, young feller. You're rather
sudding&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mark slammed the door, and strode back to the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Mother, why do you encourage that brute here?" he demanded. "Is
it possible you can entertain the thought of marrying such a man as
that? Do you want to make yourself an object of ridicule?"</p>

<p>"Shugh!" cried his mother, with a flourish of her skirts. "I'm
goin' to marry George Wrightson, an' I don't care a fig for what
you or anyone else says. You pack up your duds an' clear. I've had
enough of you an' your cuss-ed books."</p>

<p>"Right!" said Mark. "That settles it."</p>

<p>He went to his room. She heard him packing up, but did not go
near him. At daylight he was gone. Two hours later the widow
entered his room, and found a note on the packing-case table. It
was short.</p>

<p>"Mother, I am going into the bush. If you marry Wrigntson you
will never see or hear from me again. Good-bye, Mark"</p>

<p>Then the silence, the heavy stillness, of that great lonely
house was broken by a mother's sobs. Mark was really gone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c12" id="c12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>Amelia Jane, while riding across the hills at the back of
Fairymede, was surprised to see smoke issuing from the chimney at
Nolan's Hut. It had been empty for two years. Standing back off the
road, and screened by the scrub, it was never visited by
travellers. She bore down, beating a tattoo on the ribs of her grey
pony. The traveller who had broken the repose of Nolan's Hut was
getting grass for a bed. He was a young man, and new chumish in
appearance.</p>

<p>"Campin'?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Campin'," he answered.</p>

<p>"Been 'ere long?"</p>

<p>"Three days."</p>

<p>"Lookin' for a job?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. Prospecting."</p>

<p>"Oh! Y' a gold digger," she cried. "Get ony gold?"</p>

<p>"Haven't tried this neighbourhood yet." he answered.</p>

<p>"Where'd yer try larst?"</p>

<p>"Down country."</p>

<p>"Must be a good way down."</p>

<p>"Why?" She was looking at his white hands and whiter neck. "Y'
seem to've had a longish spell 'tween jobs," she answered.</p>

<p>The prospector hacked off more grass. The pocket-knife was
blunt, and his hands reddened.</p>

<p>"I'm lookin' for Strawberry," the girl volunteered after
watching him awhile.</p>

<p>"Who's Strawberry?" he asked, indifferently.</p>

<p>"One o' father's bullocks. Reg'lar cow ter poke away."</p>

<p>He straightened up again. "You're Miss Johnson, I think?" he
said, thoughtlessly. Then he bit his lip and bent again.</p>

<p>"Amelia Jane Johnson," she amended. She eyed him more
critically, and a look of intelligence came suddenly into her
weather-beaten face.</p>

<p>"Oh! Why you must be th' cove wot writes portry 'bout bullyfrogs
an' things er&mdash;Mark Keaton?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted, crimsoning. "My name's Mark Keaton."</p>

<p>She became reserved at once. She seemed to understand the
situation, and gathered up her reins. "Must find Strawberry," she
said, and went off with her back hair bobbing up and down to the
rough canter of the old grey.</p>

<p>Her recognition of him was sufficient assurance that the news
would soon spread, and he wasn't a bit surprised when next day Miss
Monaugh paid him a visit. She left Myles on the road with the
dogcart, and walked across.</p>

<p>Mark expected a warm lecture from the spinster but she only
laughed, and expressed a hope that he would like the change of
quarters.</p>

<p>"The quarters are right enough," he said. "It's this what's
troubling me just now." He handed her an open letter, which he had
received that morning. "It concerns 'The Sundowner.' They will
publish if I pay part of the cost price. It's a good chance, but
I'm afraid I must let it go."</p>

<p>"That would be a pity," said Aunt Jo, wrinkling her forehead and
frowning as she read the missive. She laid it down carefully and
drummed her fingers on the table. Presently she said: "The amount,
is only sixty pounds. You'll get two-thirds of the profits&mdash;if
there are any."</p>

<p>"There's bound to be a profit," said Mark, confidently.</p>

<p>"How long do you think it would take to recoup your outlay?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Depends," said Mark. "Might be only a few months, might take
years."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's worth the risk."</p>

<p>"I'd risk ten times the amount tomorrow if I had it," said Mark,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Hem! How much&mdash;you'll excuse the question&mdash;how much
have you on hand?"</p>

<p>"Two pounds."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the spinster, with a twitch of her lips. "You only
want fifty-eight pounds more."</p>

<p>Only fifty-eight pounds more," Mark repeated seriously.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," she said, meditatively, "you were too
precipitate in leaving home, Mark. Parents often quarrel with their
children. That's nothing. It doesn't take long for the breach to
mend. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>"You don't know the nature of the quarrel," said Mark,
gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all about it," Aunt Jo interposed.</p>

<p>"Of course! Nothing spreads like scandal," he remarked
grimly.</p>

<p>"There's some talk of your mother marrying George Wrightson," Jo
went on, "and you think it would be scandalous for her to do so.
You make a great mistake. It is her duty. She's been a widow long
enough. Let her marry."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Monaugh, the man is a sot&mdash;low, vulgar, and as
ignorant as the proverbial pig."</p>

<p>"We are not all wiseacres. Besides, you must remember your
mother is not&mdash;er&mdash;refined. She's getting old, too, and
she's lonely, and poor as a bandicoot. You can't keep her, and the
other boys are missing quantities. All good reasons why she should
accept George Wrightson. Marriage will be to their mutual
advantage. The single state to a woman, let me tell you, is not an
unmixed blessing. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of Wrightson's antecedents?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>"His antecedents are all right," she answered easily. "Don't you
worry over that. He's led a wild life, I know. But he's a
hard-working man&mdash;when he working&mdash;and as honest as
circumstances will permit. His worst fault is a weakness for drink.
Plenty of people drink."</p>

<p>"So they do," Mark admitted. "But that doesn't make George
Wrightson any more respectable."</p>

<p>"George isn't as black as he's painted," she responded. "I could
tell you something that might alter your opinion of him. But not
now&mdash;some other time. For the present, rest, assured that she
will he marrying into a good family&mdash;a very good family
indeed."</p>

<p>She stood up and brushed the front of her dress with her hands.
"I would like you to meet me on the hill," she continued, "say
Friday afternoon."</p>

<p>"What time?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"Let me see! I'll be here about four&mdash;with Etty."</p>

<p>Mark started. "Couldn't you come alone? I'd rather not meet Miss
Lethcote. We&mdash;We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Didn't she tell you?" Mark was embarrassed, and found
difficulty in explaining himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Miss Monaugh replied. "She told me. I made her."</p>

<p>"You know, then, it wouldn't do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" she broke in. "I can assure you Ethel won't
be displeased to see you. I've been speaking to her."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm much obliged to you." said Mark, a little
irritably. "But I couldn't think of forcing my society on to a
girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Again I say don't be a fool!" Miss Monaugh interrupted. "Your
besetting sin, Mark, is false pride. You stand too much on dignity.
You are too vulnerable, too sensitive; you are so easily wounded.
The average bushman, in your shoes, with the chances you had, would
not have walked off at the first rebuff with defeat stamped all
over him in large capitals; he would have shown a bold front, and
talked her out of her silly little caprices. It only wants a little
pluck, a little determination. The lack of those qualities in a man
is hateful to a woman. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>"You think I am a coward," said Mark, flushing. "Because I would
not press my suit, when I had no home to offer her, when I hadn't
the price of an engagement ring; and there is the fact that the
family is against me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deuce take the family!" Miss Monaugh interjected fiercely.
"Biddy is against you tooth and nail; but she isn't as numerous as
that. She may be captain of the ship, but she's got a mutinous
crew, and one of these fine days she'll find herself drooped
overboard. I'm one of the family, and you depend on it, when Biddy
reckons without me she makes a false calculation. You be on the
hill on Friday afternoon, and if there is need of a ring after
you've seen Ethel, I'll buy you one. As for the home, the
consummation of the marriage you are kicking against may put that
over your head. But never mind that now. All in good time. You meet
us without fail."</p>

<p>Mark pondered irresolute, and while he pondered Abe Watts rode
up. He peered in with a grin, then gave a violent start, looked
serious, and departed hurriedly without having said anything. But
he carried a bolt in his quiver, and was bursting to throw it out
when he reached the camping-ground, where Bill Sooley had just
turned out for the night.</p>

<p>"By cripes!" he cried, tilting his battered white helmet to the
back of his head. "Wot d'yer think, Bill?"</p>

<p>"What?" Bill was all attention. Abe's manner betokened something
above the ordinary.</p>

<p>"Mark Keaton's took up his residence in Nolan's Hut."</p>

<p>"Go on!" cried Bill. "Is that a fact?"</p>

<p>"An' ol' Johanna's keepin' house for him."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Straight! Jus' seen 'em with me own eyes." said Abe. " 'Melia
Jane told me mornin' he was there, an' I called round, thinkin' to
chiack him a bit. Looks in, an' there they are, the two of 'em, as
thick as flies on a dead 'orse."</p>

<p>"Wot sort o' furniture 'ave they got?"</p>

<p>"They've got a table wot used ter be th' door; a block an' a
gin-case, a billycan, a bottle of ink an' a pen, an' a lot o'
writin' paper."</p>

<p>Bill chuckled, and jerked his head like a dummy at a Punch and
Judy show. "That beats all!" he said. "Never thought Jo 'ud come
ter that."</p>

<p>"She's been, splittin' her blessed self to get a bloke ever
since she ar-rove," Abe went on. "Warn't over purtikler neither.
'Ad serious designs on yours truly, let me tell yer, time I was
workin' on th' station."</p>

<p>"Y' orter copped out on her, Abe. Been well brung up, they say.
Play th' melodium an' all. Why, ye'd been purty near respectable
with a woman like that,"</p>

<p>"Couldn't stand her 't any price. Too boney."</p>

<p>"Don't think Jo's bad lookin' though, when y'r come to know
her," Bill persisted.</p>

<p>"Ye must know her a dash sight better' n I do then, if ye've
seen enything good-lookin' about her," Abe returned. "Her face 'ud
blunt an' axe. An' she's as silly 's an old ewe in a dry paddock.
Never reckoned th' pote 'ud rub chins with her. Thet knocks me
bandy."</p>

<p>"Must be goin' to fetch him out," Bill surmised. "Kinder like to
hear 'em holdin' forth over there."</p>

<p>"Warn't sayin' much when I peered in," said Abe. "Looked 'bout
as eloquent as a pair o' Quakers at a wake. Might a been-ex-orsted
though."</p>

<p>"Hang me if I don't lose some bullocks round that way
ter-morrer," Bill declared. "Kinder like to see 'em."</p>

<p>But Bill had his trip for nothing. Mark was a hatter, looking as
happy as a sick crow in a storm. He went back later to make sure;
but still there was nothing of a suspicious character to be picked
up. After that the long gentleman who shot bees and beetles had a
suspicion that Abe Watts had been pulling his leg. Others went
straggler hunting round by Nolan's Hut, and seeing no sign of the
prude Johanna, they were unanimous in their opinion that Abel was
an inventor. Thus Aunt Jo's good character remained
untarnished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c13" id="c13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>That night Miss Monaugh, after a short consultation with Ethel
and her father, shut herself up in her room. Seating herself at a
side-table, she unlocked a small escritoire, and took from it a
pile of letters. Old and musty letters they were, some older than
Jo, and were tied up with faded red tape. She carefully untied it,
and selected two sealed missives from the packet. The first had
found her at Nanango on the occasion of her only absence from Gimbo
during her brother's ownership of that place. She returned
immediately, and had never since paid a visit to her parents' home.
Since that hurried journey her father had been planted on Baramba
Creek, and her brother among the hills of Yeerong; Gimbo had passed
into the hands of the Keatons; her sister-in law, the redoubtable
Biddy, had yarded Myles Lethcote, and Fairymede had become her real
home.</p>

<p>A big sum of money had been paid for Gimbo by Hugh Keaton, and
what had become of it was a mystery, and the sorest of points to
Biddy. She suspected that he had buried it somewhere, and had
forgotten to tell her; and the thought that a fortune&mdash;which
should be hers&mdash;was hidden somewhere near at hand was galling
in the extreme. She had often spoken of this, and in a hundred
places she had made the sceptic Myles dig for the hidden treasure,
and a hundred times had he carried his spade home and reported that
he had seen "nowt on't."</p>

<p>"Ye don't dig dape enough," Biddy would say. "'Tis only
bandicootin' ye are. 'S well sind an old hen to scratch about as
you."</p>

<p>"Better," Myles conceded. "There be worms for th' hen. There's
nowt else. Onreasonable," he said. "No un 'ud bury money in a hole
's if 'twas a dead cat, an' say nowt. No good un diggin'."</p>

<p>"Phwat th' divil's become o' the money thin?" cried Biddy. "Tell
me that if you know so much about it. Now, thin."</p>

<p>"He mought a spent un," Myles suggested.</p>

<p>"No, he didn't spend it," Biddy rejoined. "Not a skerrick he'd
spend but I'd know it. Divil a fear."</p>

<p>"They mought'n paid un&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They did pay him. He told me he was goin to put it in th' bank,
he did, an' I thought he had. But whin I looked for the resates I
couldn't find thim, an' whin I wint to th' bank the sorra a cent of
it had he put there at all. He went off so suddent&mdash;bad luck
to it&mdash;that I hadn't time to get things in ordher, an' be told
where this was, an' where that was. 'Twas meself searched th' house
high an' low, but th' divil o' use o' sarchin'. 'S well look for a
nadle in a haystack. So where can it be but buried undher a
tray?"</p>

<p>"Naw" said Myles. "Nowt but a gawk ud put un underground. He
warn't a fool, Pat Monaugh. He wouldn't bury un."</p>

<p>Biddy believed otherwise. She had dreamt of it, and each morning
she led him to a fresh spot that a shadowy hand had pointed out as
the repository. Myles came to dread late suppers, as that made
Biddy dream something awful. He believed she ate heavily on purpose
to dream; and she put all sorts of things under her pillow,
including Pat's photo with a sovereign tied to it. But nothing came
of it, and after a time she desisted in her fruitless pursuit, and
ultimately ceased to talk about it.</p>

<p>All this and many other incidents, were recalled to mind by
these two mouldy, time-worn letters, the first of which
ran:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">"My Dear Friend,&mdash;I wish, you would come down
at once. If I could leave my little Ethel in good hands, and know
that she would be well cared for, I could die happy. I wrote to my
brother, Reginald Courtenay, and to my sister, Theresa Lynton, and
begged them to take her and bring her up with her cousins, Leonard
and Adeline. They replied that they could not receive a Lethcote
into the Courtenay family. You know, I married against my father's
and brothers' wishes; married beneath me. It is hard on her, but it
can't be helped. So, my dearest friend, I appeal to you to take
charge of my little girl, and bring her up in the best way
possible. You are yourself but a girl; but you have
influence&mdash;you have wealthy relatives. I will leave you
&pound;200 to use on her behalf. Myles has been a good husband and
a loving father; but, as you know, a man isn't fitted to take sole
charge of child, particularly of a girl. Moreover, he is easily
led, and might be persuaded to give her to some woman who would
neglect her, and even be cruel to her. Therefore I give her wholly
into your charge, with authority to act as you think right in all
matters pertaining to her welfare. But I do not wish you to
separate her from her father unless it becomes absolutely
necessary. Watch over her unobtrusively&mdash;like a guardian
angel. Never desert her, and heaven will reward you. &mdash;Your
sincere friend, Lavinia Lethcote."</p>

<p>"Poor dear Lavinia!" Miss Monaugh murmured, refolding the sheet.
She suspected that Myles would marry again. She wished him to marry
me for Ethel's sake. I was young and hopeful then. But poor brother
Pat followed Lavinia, and Biddy, of course, must step in and cut me
out. It was just like her. She was always selfish and designing.
But my day will come yet, and&mdash; Sigh! I'll snap my fingers at
her."</p>

<p>Mechanically she flipped her fingers above her head, and tossed
the letter back into its receptacle. Then she lay back in her
chair, and gave way to a more sober train of thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've done my duty," she cogitated. "No one, not even Ethel
herself, knows of that money which I have kept in the bank so long.
Nor does Ethel think that the money I give her from time to
time&mdash;in presents&mdash;is in reality her own&mdash;the
accumulated interest on her own capital. Perhaps I ought to tell
her&mdash;no; it's too soon yet. She's doing all right. But I'd
pity her if she had no better guardian than Biddy. A nice one she
is to have charge of another's child. A nice one, indeed. I'll
spoil her little game, trust me. Leonard and Liela will soon be
married now, and Ethel and Mark must come together&mdash;if I know
how many beans make five. They've been very foolish. Just like
young people. But I'll fix that up. Only let me get this
satisfactorily settled, and Widow Keaton and George Wrightson
married, and it won't be very long after before I am mistress of
Tillalee. This' is leap-year, and&mdash; Well, I've had an
opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>She was rocking herself to and fro, with a contented smile on
her face; but now paused as she suddenly bethought her of something
else?</p>

<p>"Let me see," she soliloquised, as the clock was striking
eleven. "Mark's business must be disposed of first. If I'm not
greatly mistaken, that will be an easy matter. I must run over
Pat's last letter to begin with." She took it up and read:</p>

<p class="verse">"My Dear Sister,&mdash;I received the final
instalment of &pound;1000 yesterday for Gimbo. Last night I buried
it at the spot I showed you and this morning, whilst our furniture
was being removed into Dumboon, I planted a willow tree over it.
The other &pound;2000 I sent to the old people. We will never miss
it. My wife will be well provided for when I go. I told her I
invested part of the Gimbo money in mining, and by-and-by I shall
have to invent another story to the effect that my mining
speculations failed, and that I went into it deeper to recoup my
losses and lost all. She's a spendthrift, and the money would be
ruthlessly squandered were it left to her. It gives me more
contentment to divide the bulk of it between my mother and sisters,
knowing it will make them comfortable. When I am gone you can dig
up the money and bank it. Don't be too hasty, however, for your
sudden acquisition of wealth would arouse Biddy's suspicions. I
have done my best for all in a quiet way. Our cottage will soon be
finished, and then I would be glad if you would come and live with
us again.&mdash;Your affectionate brother, Pat."</p>

<p>With her elbow on the table, and her chin resting on the palm of
her hand, Miss Monaugh sat for many minutes poring over her
brother's letter. The town house, she remembered, had been left to
Biddy, and was sold by her after her marriage with Myles Lethcote.
During all the years since then the buried money had never been
touched. Often the spinster had decided to remove it and put it to
some profitable use, and as often again decided to leave it alone.
So the time passed, and the willow grew till now a great tree with
far-spreading roots stood, a silent sentinel, over her treasure. It
might have been better for her had she possessed herself of it, and
so enhanced her own position, and drawn after her a coterie of
followers&mdash;mostly of the indigent order. But a woman never
does know what to do with money, and indecision is often the bane
of her life.</p>

<p>However, Miss Monaugh had now determined to utilise her fortune,
and after accomplishing her various missions, if she failed to
tempt the Laird of Tillalee&mdash;well, people often advertised for
wives. She could answer one of these advertisements. There would be
no harm in that; in the event of failure, she could live with
Ethel, or return to Nanango. She had corresponded regularly with
her mother, who frequently asked her to return. But Miss Monaugh
would not go back to her home. The why and wherefore of this was
the secret which she never allowed to pass her lips&mdash;the
secret of a first love and a dark past.</p>

<p>The house of the Monaughs stood on Baramba Greek. With them
lived Miss Helen Crogan, who was Johanna's aunt, and only two years
her senior. This young lady paid constant visits to a station in
the vicinity, the attraction being the squatter's son, Gerald
Trevors. Gerald was at the time engaged to Miss Monaugh, then on
her first visit to Gimbo. She was only eighteen then; Gerald was
twenty. The families, said rumour, were instrumental in bringing
about the betrothal. There wasn't much love in the match, unless it
were on the weaker side. She, however, on returning and learning
the true state of affairs, broke off the engagement for the sake of
her aunt, and likewise to preserve the good name of the Monaughs.
The sacrifice of a lover was not a very serious matter then;
Eighteen has time and opportunity, Forty has neither.</p>

<p>Gerald eloped with Helen, and Johanna fled to the Yeerong. That
episode had long ago died out, and Miss Monaugh thought that if
Fortune did not attend her now she could return to Nanango without
fear of any humiliation. Having come to this definite conclusion,
she rose and put away her letters. It was past midnight when she
retired to her virtuous couch to dream of Aleck, who just now
appeared to be her last desperate hope. She always called him Aleck
in Dreamland. Once he had kissed her there. Others had kissed her,
too. Ah; the lovers she had known&mdash;in her sleep.</p>

<p>Once she had been nearly married. She stood at the altar
with&mdash;she could never think who the man was; someone she had
picked up on the way to church. There was no church in Dumboon and
no parson. The postmaster officiated in matrimonial matters. But
she was sure this place was a church. She stood in her bridal
robes&mdash;resplendent, triumphant. The parson opened his book,
and was about to grant the license demanded by Mother Grundy when
in waltzed Biddy.</p>

<p>"Phwat the divil's this she cried," aghast.</p>

<p>"Sh, woman!" said the parson.</p>

<p>"God be good to us!" Biddy exclaimed. "Is it a dirty Chow she's
goin' to wed!"</p>

<p>"Jo looked round, and was horrified to see beside her a grinning
Mongolian, with shaven head and pig-tail as long as a
cable&mdash;the ugliest Chinaman she had ever looked at. Then she
saw that she, too, wore a pig-tail, and the two were tied together.
This was the nuptial knot, only wanting to be drawn tight to make
them one until the Divorce Court doth them part. But the bubble
burst, and next day she almost hated Biddy. As it was only in
Dreamland it didn't matter what her husband was. She felt that
Biddy had robbed her of a great opportunity of judging. It was just
what Biddy would do, in any case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c14" id="c14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>On the day appointed Mark set out for Druton Hill. He walked
slowly, his eyes bent on the ground in meditation. So many things
had happened during the last few weeks, and a great deal more was
expected to happen in the near future. Strange to say, his mother
held the foremost place in his thoughts. He wondered how she was
getting on all alone in that big house, and half regretted, in
spite of all he had said to Leonard and Miss Monaugh, that he had
not been more patient and considerate.</p>

<p>In an uncertain mood he climbed the hill. From west to south he
could trace the sinuous course of the Yeerong, and on the flat he
saw Leonard and Liela, arm-in-arm, approaching Druton garden from
the hill. They got into a trap, and he watched them drive away in
the direction of Murrawang. They had evidently left the summit but
a few minutes before he reached it. They would soon be husband and
wife, and Mark thought of the approaching nuptials with horror.
They would want him to be best man, or something, and he would
rather see Leonard lose his girl than go through that ordeal just
now. He had a notion of shifting from Nolan's Hut into some
unfrequented jungle, and lying low until the trouble was over. It
did seem annoying that a man could not take a wife to his bosom
without so much fuss and bother.</p>

<p>Just then he descried Aunt Jo coming from Fairymede, and
observed the patient Myles dodging about after the calves. They met
in the little home paddock but Mark did not know what was said till
long afterwards.</p>

<p>"Goin' up hill, Jo?" said Myles, interrogatively. Jo said she
was.</p>

<p>"Will you see un there, think you?" Myles continued.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered. "He won't fail to keep his appointment.
That is one good point in Mark Keaton."</p>

<p>"I like un," Myles declared. "Like un to marry my little gel.
Where be she?"</p>

<p>"I expect to meet her on the hill. She's been spending the day
with Liela."</p>

<p>"So she be," Myles agreed. "I want to get un away from here, Jo.
Leonard an' Liela will take un on they honeymoon. That 'ull be
summat. Baint enough, though." He edged nearer. "Y' see, Biddy
wants to yoke un on to Mac, cos he's got a pun or two. Mus'n let un
do that, Jo. 'D ruther see un tied to Crackshot!"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Myles. Mr M'Gurren will never marry Etty."
Aunt Jo spoke with a firmness that reassured Mr Lethcote.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said, his eyes twinkling with pleasure. "Good on you,
Jo. Do 'ee think she an' Mark will make a match on't?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Jo. "I know she likes him."</p>

<p>"An' him?"</p>

<p>"He's dead gone on her."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Myles, rubbing his hands. "Do yer best for un, Jo.
If un want t' 'ave a word alone wi' Etty&mdash;why, let'n 'ave
it."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"N' if un seem bit backward, Jo, why&mdash;" He nudged her
meaningly with his elbow. "Help un along, Jo. 'D ruther see it
fixed up 'fore un goes away. An' Biddy won't know nowt on't."</p>

<p>"It will give me pleasure," said the spinster, "to spoil her
little schemes. She's treated Ethel very badly. Poor child! For her
sake I have often regretted that you married that woman."</p>

<p>"Drat un," said Myles, who also regretted that circumstance.
"She bewitched me, Jo. Dunno how. She baint a takin'
sort&mdash;when 'ee come to look at her. . . I didn't know you so
well then, Jo. If I was single&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Myles. It's too late now."</p>

<p>"So 'tis, drat'n all. Mought live long while yet too," said
Myles, reflectively. "But we make, un chew cold cabbage yet, I'll
warrant."</p>

<p>He went on with his calves, and Mark from his coign of vantage
watched the spinster treading cautiously through the grass. She had
a horror of snakes. She encountered them frequently, but, beyond
further surprising them with a sharp scream, and an impromptu skip
and hop, did them no harm. Such circumstances, however, were
detrimental to Miss Monaugh, for horrible snake dreams was the
inevitable result to each encounter, and Aleck was never at hand to
pull the reptiles off her. At times she would stop short, or spring
aside, and when it transpired that the cause of her trepidation was
only a crooked stick, resume her way in the same preoccupied
manner. Mark smiled at her groundless alarms and unnecessary
caution. He liked the old maid. Despite her many shortcomings, she
was a good woman in the main. Presently his attention was diverted
by a sweet voice singing in the scrub. He listened. The trilling
notes drew nearer, and the voice became more familiar. He heard the
words&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">'Twas the last rose of summer,<br>
Left blooming, alone;<br>
All her lovely companions<br>
Are withered and gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Long, long ago he had heard that song, and then it was from the
lips of Ethel. Surely it was her voice he heard now! Jo had
promised to bring Ethel with her. Perhaps she had formed some plan
for a reconciliation, and caused Ethel to precede her for that
purpose. She had assured him that Ethel would he glad to see
him.</p>

<p>He started forward, knowing the meeting must naturally be a
trifle embarrassing for both, and determined to have it over before
Jo arrived. His blood pump worked prodigiously as he approached the
outskirts of the scrub, and heard her step on the withered leaves.
A scrub, with its dulled light, its commingling of aromas, its bird
notes, and everlasting greenery, was a delightful place to meet a
pretty girl in. He quickened his pace, but an unsympathetic lawyer
vine gripped him and tore his immaculate courting pants. The next
moment Ethel emerged from the screening foliage, holding her hat by
a ribbon in one hand, and a bunch of ferns in the other. Her cheeks
went pink at the sight of him. Beyond that she evinced no surprise.
On the other hand, Mark was shy, and felt awkwardly out of
place.</p>

<p>"I've been hunting for ferns," she explained.</p>

<p>The ice was broken, and she spoke with a suavity that encouraged
him.</p>

<p>"I know where there are some pretty ones&mdash;if you will
come," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"It's too late now," said Ethel. "Perhaps another day we shall
have more time."</p>

<p>This was promising, at all events. Mark was in a measure
delighted.</p>

<p>"I'm waiting for my aunt," Ethel continued. "I&mdash;I suppose
you're looking for Leonard?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;not exactly! Er&mdash;your aunt's coming up the
track," Mark stammered. "Shall we go and meet her?"</p>

<p>"We'll go to the top of the hill if you like."</p>

<p>There was considerable restraint yet on both sides; so different
from the freedom of past days.</p>

<p>They climbed slowly up the hill in silence, and when they had
almost reached the top he spoke with an abruptness that startled
her.</p>

<p>"Ethel, did you intend that I should accept the answer you gave
me at the bridge as final?"</p>

<p>She did not speak.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse my speaking of it again," he continued
tremulously. "I'm going away&mdash;soon&mdash;perhaps for
good."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"North."</p>

<p>"Over the border?"</p>

<p>"Far over. I thought I might have taken you unawares&mdash;that
you spoke without knowing your true feelings," he said, reverting
to the vital point. "I think&mdash;I was dear to you once. Am I to
understand that I am no longer so?"</p>

<p>"No, Mark," Ethel replied. "I'll always be your dearest
friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the use of that?" Mark interrupted, desperately. "I love
you, Ethel&mdash;passionately. My whole future's centred in
you."</p>

<p>They had reached the top of the hill, and stood face to face in
the shadow of an ironbark. She was grinding a leaf into the ground
with the ferrule of her parasol. He took the gloved hand in which
she held the bunch of ferns, and placed his arm around her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ethel, do you care for me?&mdash;I know you do!" he cried
passionately.</p>

<p>She felt his lips suddenly touch her cheek, and drew away
abashed. The ferns were scattered at their feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mark&mdash;Mr&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no; call me Mark. Ethel, dearest, you are mine!" He bent
over her. "It's your father's wish that you should be my
bride."</p>

<p>"He never told me so," Ethel answered. "It would be his
downfall."</p>

<p>A change came over Mark. They were standing a little apart
again.</p>

<p>"You are determined," he said, "to marry money?"</p>

<p>"I haven't determined anything. I'm too young yet. Money alone
can save my father."</p>

<p>"And if that money is forthcoming?"</p>

<p>"I am free!"</p>

<p>He clutched her arm in a fierce grip that made her wince.</p>

<p>"Ethel, tell me frankly, do you love me or not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do not ask me! Let me go!"</p>

<p>"Mar&mdash;Mr Keaton, you are hurting me."</p>

<p>She was frightened. Her lips trembled as she straggled vainly to
free herself. Her hat was hanging from her hair; her parasol lay on
the ground.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;I will know!" cried Mark wildly. "Do you wish to
cast me from you for ever?"</p>

<p>"It would be better so."</p>

<p>"That's what your judgment tells you. But your heart&mdash;Can
you say under heaven you do not love me?"</p>

<p>Silence. He turned her so that she faced him.</p>

<p>"Ethel, can you?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash; no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you are mine&mdash;mine! Nothing will ever tear you from
me&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>He clasped her fiercely to him, and covered her face with
kisses. Ethel, breathless and trembling, lay limp and unresisting
in his arms. He lifted her face gently; And then, like a timid
child, she looked up with swimming eyes, hesitated&mdash;then put
her lips to his. And while they stood there, intoxicated with the
lingering sweetness of love's first thrilling kiss, Miss Monaugh,
who had crept up behind the tree, her own heart palpitating,
surprised them. Ethel broke away, blushing. Mark, flushed and
excited, looked blankly at the elder lady.</p>

<p>"I am glad!" she said, simply. She grasped his hand. Ethel
turned away to pick up her ferns.</p>

<p>"It's all right now?" she added in a whisper. "I told you so,
didn't I? Ah! I had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>Mark clutched her arm. His manner, wild and strange, startled
her.</p>

<p>"All right now?" he repeated. "Miss Monaugh&mdash;My God, I've
bought her!"</p>

<p>She thrust him rudely aside. "Fool!" she whispered fiercely.
Then, as Ethel came forward: "My dear child, let me congratulate
you. I am exceedingly glad. You have realised your father's fondest
wish. God bless you!"</p>

<p>She kissed her, then walked away to gather some flowers she
didn't want. She gathered them till sundown, and sat on a log by
herself, arranging them till dusk.</p>

<p>As the dusk deepened she led them slowly homeward, watching the
ground for snakes, and never saying a word. At the sliprails,
opening into the little home paddock, she spoke:</p>

<p>"We will leave you here, Mark. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>And again she turned away to let them kiss good-night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c15" id="c15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>Tuesday was an eventful day. Leonard and Liela were that morning
united in the holy bonds of matrimony. Miss Monaugh was not present
at the ceremony, but presided over the breakfast table in the big
room at Murrawang, where the gentility of Dumboon and most of the
Hill's folk were assembled. She was a gorgeous quantity of white
satin, paint and frizzled hair, and smiled upon everybody with the
utmost Urbanity. To Widow Keaton and George Wrightson, whose
presence was due to the courtesy of Mrs Battye, she was
particularly gracious, and she had successfully contrived to effect
a reconciliation between the former and her son. The widow was
penitent, and begged him to return home.</p>

<p>"It's so lonely," she said. "I'll go mad If I stop there much
longer. I've got Sarah from th' Dairy stayin' with me now. Such a
one to talk an' sing y'r never heard. When I'm too busy to mind
her, she'll sit an' crotchet like anything, with th' music box
goin' all the time&mdash;for hours at a stretch. She makes things
hum a bit, she do. But th' house don't seem th' same with no man in
it. Seems dead an' holler. Abe Watts comes some nights, but he only
comes after Sarah. An' they sit out on the log, muggin' and
titterin' till all hours. Come 'ome an' get a good job on th'
crick. Don't be a fool."</p>

<p>But Mark said he had already made arrangements to go to
Brisbane, and would be off in a few days. She didn't mention the
subject again. Mark was headstrong, and at a time like this she did
not wish to run the risk of another quarrel. He had been down in
the dumps all the morning. A long separation from his sweetheart,
but recently won, was a matter that weighed heavily on a man like
Mark. Ethel was going away with the newly-married couple, and it
would be months before he would see her again at Fairymede, even
should circumstances enable him soon to return to his old
haunts.</p>

<p>Shortly he went in search of her. He found her with Miss Monaugh
and Liela at the side of the buggy, which stood waiting, with old
Myles standing at the heads of the horses. He drew her aside.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're going away from here," he said softly; "and
yet&mdash;I can't tell you how sorry I am to part from you so soon.
We've been engaged such a little while."</p>

<p>"But we'll soon see each other again," said Ethel, more
hopefully. "You are going away yourself, and I consider it a
blessing I am not left here alone with that horrid old man. I know
mother is watching us now. She doesn't like to see us
together."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh, having taken leave of Leonard and Liela, now came
back to the lovers. She had opened her umbrella, and, holding it so
that it screened them from view of all but a few in front whom they
did not mind, said: "There now, no one will be the wiser. I know
you wanted to&mdash;both of you. Kiss her, Mark&mdash; Lors, child,
how you blush!"</p>

<p>Still Ethel did not mind Aunt Jo; she was a motherly old person.
But it seemed to her improper to kiss a man before the eyes of
others. But there was no help for it. They could not be further
screened, and she could not leave Mark with a simple handshake.
Their lips met, lingered rapturously, tremulously; then she
hurriedly disengaged herself from his embrace, and treating her
aunt to a stage kiss (which was too quick for the spinster, who
only smacked at the air as Ethel was drawing back), sprang nimbly
into the vehicle. It was all over in a moment, yet many eyes had
witnessed the erotic scene, and ere another day had passed, half as
many tongues had told the tale, and by the end of the week all
Dumboon and all the Yeerong knew that Ethel Lethcote was betrothed
to Mark Keaton.</p>

<p>The bridal party were delayed by the over-generous Biddy, who
brought out a tubful of grapes, and insisted on stowing them in the
buggy.</p>

<p>"There's no tellin' but ye might get hungry an' thirsty on the
road where there's no shanty to be callin' at. The fust day do make
ye thirsty, an' there's nuthin' like a grape or two to give relafe
to a body, so there isn't. I'm sure the horse can pull thim. Just
shtick thim undher the sate, you bosthoon. There that's it.
Couldn't ye've done that before? Now, off you go, an' good luck be
wid the lot of you."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Liela," said Mrs Battye kissing her daughter. "You'll
come an' see me sometimes, drat&mdash;" And then she burst into
tears; and while she was still &quot;sniffin'," as Mrs Keaton
stoically remarked, they drove off through a shower of old boots,
shoes slippers and rice. The horses reared and plunged, and all the
old hens and ducks came cackling and quacking after the scattered
grain.</p>

<p>"God save us th' mokes have bolted!" Biddy was heard to exclaim
above the general laughter. "Avast, ye bosthoons, don't ye see
they've bolted! Howld 'em tight, acushla."</p>

<p>"They're a' richt, mistress," was the reassuring response from
Mr M'Gurren. "Dinna see th' lad i' whoppin' them oop ta get oot o'
th' fire?"</p>

<p>"Aye," said Myles, chipping in. "There's nowt to be feared on
when Leonard got holt o' the reins. He'll pull un back, I'll
warrant."</p>

<p>&quot;It's a hidiotic pro-sading, anyway." Biddy persisted. "I
can't see how it's lucky to get a whack on the shpine, or a clout
on the jaw wid an owld boot. Where's the luck come in at all?"</p>

<p>"I dinna ken, mistress," said M'Gurren, his eyes on the
departing trio. "Maybe Misstress Keaton can telt us o' the guid
that i' in't?"</p>

<p>"I dunno eny good in it," was the prompt rejoinder. "I think it
'ud be more sensible to toast 'em 'an to pelt 'em with
shoe-leather."</p>

<p>"There ye've sed it!" Mr Wrightson affirmed. "Them's my
sentiments to a T."</p>

<p>When the principals had disappeared the guests gathered in knots
to discuss the prospects of the marriage. Many stayed all day,
dancing and merrymaking, but the greater number made an early move
for home. Among these were the Fairymede people. Mr Wrightson and
his intended bride stayed to "see it out," the former being
ultimately removed under protest to the Red Road. Biddy and Myles
drove back in the dogcart, but Mr M'Gurren and Miss Monaugh elected
to walk.</p>

<p>The spinster had enjoyed herself immensely and was in a very
good humour. From Murrawang to Fairymede was a long walk, but she
would gladly have walked it a dozen times over under the same
conditions. The presence of Mr M'Gurren seemed to lessen the
distance by half, and rendered her proof against fatigue.</p>

<p>"Did you ever notice, Mr M'Gurren," she said, "that one marriage
always leads to another, and very often two or three? This one will
be no exception. It's a certainty that at least three more weddings
will be coming off shortly."</p>

<p>"Heigh, lass, that's guid for Dumboon! Wha are th' parties?"</p>

<p>"The first, I think, will be Abe Watts and Sarah from the Dairy.
Abe is an old acquaintance of mine. The next won't be very far from
Fairymede."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Aleck, looking slyly at the old maid. "Is it yesel'
that wul gang ta the altar in a breedal robe?"</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh sighed. "Oh, no," she answered. "Nobody would take
that much interest in me. I am left in the cold. I'm afraid I am
getting too old and faded."</p>

<p>She was fishing for a compliment, but the laird was not a
gallant man.</p>

<p>"Aye, lass," he rejoined. "I'm afeart your time hae slipit awa'.
Ye're ta auld for the young ones noo."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh shut her parasol with a snap, and drove it
viciously into the ground at every step. "They are not all young,"
she said, tartly. "I know some old men who would marry, but somehow
they have an intemperate desire to wed youth. That is very wrong.
Age and youth cannot connubially cooperate happily. It would blight
a young girl's life like a touch of frost on a summer flower. There
is nothing of that nature in the matches to which I allude. Mrs
Keaton is a middle aged woman&mdash;a widow and in George Wrightson
she has chosen one in her proper sphere&mdash;a man in every way
suited to be her husband."</p>

<p>"Is't true they're ta be marrit?"</p>

<p>"Quite true."</p>

<p>"Ah cudna believe it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He's sich an awfu' drunkard. He'll swallow oop Gimbo in whusky
afore a twa'-month."</p>

<p>"I can assure you he'll do nothing of the kind. Widow Keaton
will keep him under control&mdash;and reform him."</p>

<p>"I hope she wul, lass. I hope she wul," said M'Gurren, with the
air of one who believed that she wouldn't.</p>

<p>"Wha i' the other coople?" he inquired a moment later.</p>

<p>"Mark Keaton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mark Keaton! Losh," cried M'Gurren, laughing outright. His
levity aggravated the dignified Miss Monaugh.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr M'Gurren," she said, with some acerbity, "I can see
nothing to laugh at. There's' nothing ludicrous in Mark getting
married. He's the finest looking man on the Yeerong."</p>

<p>"That's richt enough. Buit what's the guid o' a mon bein' fine
lookin' if he canna keep himsel'? The lad i' verra poor."</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use of talking!" cried the spinster with an
impatient shrug. M'Gurren's frequent references to Mark's poverty
irritated her. "I have told you," she continued, "that Mark has
prospects. He'll be a rich man before many years&mdash;and a great
man. While a man is down keep him down is the motto of a good many,
and I am sure it's no credit to them. Poor men, particularly the
working class, are often of the most sterling worth. I can't say so
much for the majority of the rich. They have no sympathy with their
less fortunate fellows. I've had an opportunity of judging." She
paused for an instant while she again put up her parasol. "Yes,"
she resumed, "I consider Mark, from a social standpoint, the most
eligible parti on the creek. He'll be the most envied, too, for his
betrothed is sans pareil."</p>

<p>"Canna telt a body her name, lass?" said M'Gurren,
pettishly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly. But you must promise me faithfully that you
will tell no one. Their little affaire d'amour is only known to a
select few, and we' don't want it to reach Mrs Lethcote's ears
above all persons. Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;dinna fear I'll telt ony one."</p>

<p>"You know, Mr M'Gurren, Mark and my niece were reared within
coo-ee of each other. They were playmates together, schoolmates
together&mdash;and naturally became much attached to each other. It
is very gratifying, therefore, to reflect that a union so
auspiciously begun in childhood, and deepened into the warmest
affection they grew to man and woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Lud bless us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mark and Ethel are now engaged," Miss Monaugh concluded
imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Engeeged ta be marrit!" her companion gasped, stopping short,
and regarding her with kindling eyes. In the expression of his face
one saw a mingling of incredulity, surprise and dismay, as when a
thing long sought and looked upon as a certainty is suddenly blown
away like a straw in a gale. With his broad acres, his fine house
and magnificent gardens, his huge fortune, and the all-powerful,
indomitable Biddy to back him, he had made dead sure of Ethel. He
had not pressed himself upon her of late. He had proposed to her,
and she had not rejected him; she had promised to acquaint him of
her decision on the day when she would be twenty years of age. He
had admitted the reasonableness of her wish not to become a wife
before she had grown out of her teens. He did not expect that.
Therefore her request had been met with a ready acquiescence. Since
then he had been given no cause to complain, and had met with no
rebuffs from Ethel. She had been the same towards him as formerly,
and he had been satisfied. But Miss Monaugh had thrown another
light upon the matter, and a great fear permeated him that some
intrigue was at work. Either Ethel was false and tricky, or Miss
Monaugh was a designing minx, bent upon working out some villainous
scheme having for its object the advancement of her own precious
ends. He was afraid of Miss Monaugh. She had a way of saying and
doing things that discomfited him. Besides, she had been courting
him outrageously, which gave him the impression that she had a
hankering after his money, but for which she would think no more of
him than she did of the meanest of the scrubbers. In reality, Miss
Monaugh was not of a sordid turn of mind. She merely had an
antipathy for the condition of an old maid. Had another, qualified
by approximation of age and social standing to her own, presented
himself within reasonable distance of Fairymede, she would have
angled for him as energetically as she did for the Laird of
Tillalee. She had made up her mind to acquaint him of Ethel's
engagement that he might understand the hopelessness of his suit,
and give a little more of his attention to her. It was out now, and
her heart was in a flutter; yet she was a strong woman.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "I believe they will be married about the
end of the year. By then he should be drawing an income sufficient
to keep her in comparative comfort. He's not so 'varra poor' as you
imagine. He will be rich, take it from me. I've had an opportunity
of judging."</p>

<p>"If he is a mon," said M'Gurren, angrily, "he wad bide a wee,
an' get marrit whun he cam' inta th' big fortune ye talk aboot.
Whee shud he marry on naething whun he may hae enough for a' if he
wad bide a wee? He hasna got a hame ta tak her ta&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mr M'Gurren," Miss Monaugh interrupted. "He will
shortly come into possession of a splendid property."</p>

<p>"Whaur aboot? Wha hast noo?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the spinster, looking straight ahead, &quot;that's a
matter I am not yet at liberty to divulge."</p>

<p>M'Gurren eyed her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I've hud aboon that afore, lass, buit I doot it&mdash;I varra,
muckle doot it."</p>

<p>"Of course you do," said Miss Monaugh, crossly. "You have a
grudge against him, and it wouldn't suit your purpose to see him
come into property."</p>

<p>Aunt Jo was quit content to let the matter rest at that, and she
was glad when Amelia Jane suddenly shot across in front of them on
the old grey pony.</p>

<p>"Did yer see Strawberry enywhere?" she called out, slackening
for an instant.</p>

<p>"I dinna ken onything aboot un," M'Gurren snapped.</p>

<p>"He's a blister'd swine, that Strawberry. 'S always away, an'
nobody never sees him," Amelia Jane complained, as she whacked the
grey into his paces again. Aunt Jo stopped dead, with a sudden
straightening of her shoulders, and stared after Miss Johnson with
her mouth open.</p>

<p>"That woman has a vulgar tongue," M'Gurren commented.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" Miss Monaugh said, and walked on.</p>

<p>During the rest of the way M'Gurren, contrary to his usual
custom, was taciturn and thoughtful whilst Miss Monaugh chatted
about the wedding festivities, the dresses and the presents, and
such congenial topics. She could afford to discourse on such
matters; she felt that she had gained another point, and was nearer
the state of matrimony than she had been for a long time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c16" id="c16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>A dark and stormy night, with heavy rain clouds hovering
overhead and low rumblings of thunder in the distance. The windows
and doors at Fairymede were barred against the fierce wind. The
willows bowed and sighed, and the dead leaves fell in showers. A
night to hug the fireside, yet two figures stood under the swaying
branches by the bridge. Both were closely muffled, and their cloaks
flapped and twined like living things about their legs. They were a
man and a woman, and that woman was Miss Monaugh. In one hand she
held a huge umbrella; in the other a bull's-eye lantern.</p>

<p>"Jumpin' Jemima! this is a lovely night to bring a feller out
in." the man grumbled. "Couldn't yer leave it till ter-morrer?"</p>

<p>"No. I want a hundred pounds before six o'clock to-morrow
morning. I have nowhere to get it but there; an; as no one must
know of this plant, it must be accomplished to-night at all
hazards. Have you got the tools?"</p>

<p>"They're 'ere."</p>

<p>"Then get to work. The sooner it's done the better. It shouldn't
take you very long."</p>

<p>"Dunno so much about that. I ain't a steam engine. Aint got eyes
like a mopoke neither. How's a feller to see what he's a doin', I'd
like ter know?"</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh turned on the light, which enabled her companion to
find the pick and shovel he had been groping for.</p>

<p>"Where's the spot&mdash;the eggs-akt spot, mindger. I ain't
goin' to turn the whole darned paddick upside down lookin' fort. 'F
I don't drop plump on to't fust shot I claims another fiver. That's
straight wire."</p>

<p>"Now George, don't be unreasonable. Five pounds will pay you
very well. And, bear in mind, I didn't bring the storm."</p>

<p>"No one sed you did. But you ought 'ave knowed 'twas comin'. I
could see it dinner time when them white fleeces was bowlin' up
from back o' Dumboon."</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't."</p>

<p>"That's queer. Warnt so sudding that you couldn't 'ave 'ad a
hopportunity o' judgin'."</p>

<p>"I don't take any interest in the weather, George."</p>

<p>"Don't it stir up your pet corns when there's rain comin'?"
George inquired. "It do mine."</p>

<p>"For all that," Miss Monaugh proceeded, ignoring the rudeness of
her companion, "I am sorry it has turned out so unpropitious for
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unpro-whater?"</p>

<p>"So unfavourable," Miss Monaugh explained.</p>

<p>"Wal," growled George, who was in a cantankerous mood, "why
couldn't yer say so. What's th' use o' chuckin' yer jaw-breakers at
me? Jumpin' Jemima, if this aint a bull-snorter of a black
perisher, tell me."</p>

<p>"At the worst," said Miss Monaugh in a conciliatory tone, "we'll
only get a drenching if it does rain. We're not sugarsticks that
will melt. And there's a chance of its holding off till we're
finished&mdash;if you would only get to work. Look at the time
we're wasting!"</p>

<p>"Where's the eggs-akt spot, that's the question?" Miss Monaugh
gave a little cough, and commenced to examine the root of the tree
under which they were standing. "Have you the axe?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Holy wars!" he exclaimed. " 'S not stuck under that spiflicated
tree, is it?"</p>

<p>"Fair under that tree, George."</p>

<p>"Wal, that's a nice go if yer like."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to grub it out. It has such a cluster of
roots that to undermine it would take too long. A pity&mdash;a
great pity! But there's no help for it. It must come out."</p>

<p>George swallowed an oath. Then he said "Look 'ere, Jo, this is a
bit sudding. There was nuthin' about tree-grubbin' in the contrak,
an' 'less the terms is altered I'm goin' ter strike. Why, 't'ill
take ter Sunday mornin' to finish it an' I doesn't work on Sunday.
Make no error about that. I wants a fair deal, else we'll 'ave to
squash the 'greement an' go 'ome. Them's my sentiments. So there
you are."</p>

<p>"Goodness me" cried Miss Monaugh crossly, "what an aggravating
fellow you are. If I give you a hundred pounds, what would be the
use of it to you? You'd only go and drink it."</p>

<p>"An' what's it to do with you if I did? What do you want with
th' money, eh? I'll tell yer. You wants to buy off a rival, so yer
ken cop old spooneywinks. See! I'm up to you. So jes' fork out, an'
none o' yer funny bizness. Aint I kep' yer secret all these years
so them bobtail swells wouldn't sniff at yer? What 'ud they say if
they knowed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"George!"</p>

<p>"That's me!"</p>

<p>"We can dispense with speculations of that
kind&mdash;please."</p>

<p>"Right-o. Stump up, an' I'm dumb. What's th' bargain?"</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh picked up her skirts, and fidgeted with the
lantern. She was very angry, but to some extent succeeded in
controlling her temper.</p>

<p>"If you get me that money in one hour," she said,
I'll&mdash;I'll double the honorarium though I must say it's very
extortionate."</p>

<p>" 'Onor-rary-orum! Ex-tor-shin-it! Purty good, them!" George
mumbled as he peeled off his coat. "One hour, eh? Yer too sudding,
Jo&mdash;too sudding!"</p>

<p>With these vague expressions the dilatory George spat on his
hands and rubbed them together. "Ye'll soon 'ave yer darbies on it,
Jo," he said, more agreeably. "I ken work like anything when I
start."</p>

<p>The first, half-hour made little impression on the matted roots,
which appeared to defy the repeated assaults of pick and axe. Miss
Monaugh stood by, holding the light, now breaking the monotony with
little coughs, now humming fragmentary songs, to keep up her
patience. At last George, with a long sigh, stood up to straighten
his back. He leaned on his pick handle, and looked at his
companion.</p>

<p>"What th' buckjumpin' adder did he shove it under there for?
Must 'ave 'ad white ants or beetles in his socks, or
something."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" said Miss Monaugh, icily.</p>

<p>"Beg yer parding!" George repeated with scorn, and spat on his
hands again&mdash;impressively.</p>

<p>"George," said Miss Monaugh, sternly, "you should speak
respectfully of the dead."</p>

<p>"He showed respect for th' livin', didn't he?" George retorted.
"He helped me when I come 'ere fust, didn't he? Him with his
thousands; me without a shirt to me back. What was th' use of it to
him after all? Had t'leave it behind him. So will you. An' who'll
get it? Who'll 'ave th' pleasure o' splashin' it up? That
herrin'-gutted' old geyser, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"George!"</p>

<p>"That's me!"&mdash;calmly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you're insulting!"</p>

<p>"I ken understand a man plantin' spuds," George went on;
&quot;but good money. . . . That ain't the aggreeculture wot pays,
Jo. You make no error. Why don't yer splash it up an' enjoy
yerself? I'd help yer&mdash;willingly."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply he drove the axe into the roots with
a vicious thud. Minutes passed. George worked hard, now with the
pick, now with the axe, till at last, with the assistance of a gust
of wind, the tree came down. The second thrust of the pick in the
hollow struck the iron box in which the treasure was secreted. With
a little leverage he hauled it out, and Miss Monaugh, with much
show of excitement and exultation, proceeded to inspect it.</p>

<p>She had hardly scraped the clay off the rust-eaten top when she
heard a footfall close behind her, and, springing round, threw the
light full upon the face of an unexpected intruder. One glimpse of
his face sufficed, and both uttered an involuntary exclamation on
recognising Mark Keaton!</p>

<p>For a moment he stood looking from one to the other, and from
them to the tree they had felled. Then he said, in a voice husky
with anger:</p>

<p>"Miss Monaugh, what is the meaning of this? Why are you
destroying my property in this ruthless manner?"</p>

<p>"It had to be destroyed, Mark," said Miss Monaugh, desperately.
"I'll explain directly."</p>

<p>"That won't replace the tree. I wouldn't have had it destroyed
for a hundred pounds. It was under that very tree my father sat the
last time he was here. And didn't Eustace, perched in its branches,
sing to you, 'Woodmen, Spare That Tree?' And you've cut it
down!"</p>

<p>He almost choked, and Miss Monaugh knew from experience that his
eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mark, I'm sorry&mdash;I couldn't help it&mdash;it had to be
done&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, panting. Then she turned to the dark figure
crouching against the fallen trunk. "George, I wish you would
gather up these implements and&mdash;and go home."</p>

<p>"Go home!" repeated the low, deep voice of Kilfloggin. "That's
what we say to dorgs&mdash;Go home! That's my thanks. An' yet
we's&mdash;old acquaintances! Too sudding, Jo, too sudding!"</p>

<p>When he had gone Mark said, as he took up the box at its owner's
request: "Is that man a special friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no!" she replied, with a hesitation that Mark did not
fail to notice. "I employed him to do this work for me."</p>

<p>"To uproot my favourite tree for this worthless box," said Mark,
reproachfully. "Jo, you have done me an injury."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mark, don't say that! At least, say it is
reparable.&quot;</p>

<p>"How can it be? If the tree were replanted it would wither and
die. I can only preserve its precious wood. Even that must be
entrusted to other hands, for I'm going away in the morning. That's
why I am here tonight. My mother asked me to come and have tea with
her. I wish now I hadn't come."</p>

<p>"Mark, listen to me," said Miss Monaugh. She was almost crying.
"That box isn't so worthless as you think. It contains a&mdash;a
thousand pounds in gold."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Are you so rich?"</p>

<p>At other times Mark would not have been so impertinent as to ask
such a question; he was carried away by the astounding announcement
of the opulence of the spinster whom he had always regarded as
being in straitened circumstances, and dependent on her
relatives.</p>

<p>"Yes, she replied. "I am passably rich, though nobody knows it,
and I can well afford to give you a hundred pounds for the damage I
have done. I intended from the first to give you that, as I could
not get my money without injuring you. You need it too. It will
enable you to bring out your book. So you may consider it a streak
of good luck."</p>

<p>Mark was silent and thoughtful, and Miss Monaugh realised with
pleasure that she had succeeded in accomplishing her generous wish
without hurting his sensitive feelings.</p>

<p>"Now," she continued, with something of her usual buoyancy,
"I'll give you this sum before you go away, so that you won't be
under any inconvenience. And I must ask you as a favour not to
betray the perpetrators of that deed, or reveal your knowledge of
the facts. Old Biddy would be ramping if she knew the truth. Myles
and I will cut up the wood and preserve it for you and I'll plant a
sprig of the old tree on the same spot, and it will have a history
more important than the others. Ten years hence, when you are
master of Gimbo, and a man of wealth and fame, let us hope, you may
sit under its branches and tell the tale to your little wife, and
thank me for cutting down the old one."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a fairy tale," said Mark. "Too good to be
true."</p>

<p>"We mustn't talk any more," she whispered. "I want you to sneak
that into my room for me as quietly as possible. I'll have to hide
it in my big box."</p>

<p>The storm burst on them before they reached the house, and two
miserably wet creatures crept in like burglars going to crack a
crib. He put the box down by the side of Jo's spotless bed, while
she brought out a bottle of wine. The room smelt of lavender, and
it was cosy and warm. A sleek-coated cat (pet and comfort of the
old maid) purred drowsily on a white goat-skin; and on her dressing
table stood a statuette of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>"You're the only man that's ever been in here," she remarked,
with a blushful smile as she handed him a nobbler-glass.</p>

<p>Mark drank it off and left hurriedly.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Early as it was, Miss Monaugh was in Dumboon before the coach
departed with Mark on the box seat. He went away with a radiant
face, and she returned to Fairymede in time for breakfast,
conscious that she had been of service to at least one fellow
creature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c17" id="c17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p>"Are ye goin' out this mornin', Jo?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Biddy. I'm going over to Widow Keaton's," Miss Monaugh
replied as she came in to breakfast, her hair in curl papers. It
was nearly nine o'clock, and Biddy was completing the table
arrangements. Mr Lethcote was in the garden, "potterin' about."
Biddy did all the morning work indoors, and Miss Monaugh officiated
during the rest of the day. The scrubbing, washing, and such
laborious work was done by a black gin&mdash;the only servant Biddy
could afford nowadays.</p>

<p>"Sure, I knew ye were off for a galivant," said Biddy, with an
arch smile, which she generally put on when in a good humour. "
'Tis aisy to tell whin I see you bobbin' about like a paper
facthory. It bates me phwat you see in frizzlin' yer thatch so.
'Twould look as well in a plait."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the spinster sighed, pressing back a rebellious curl over
her ear. "My hair is a great trouble to me since Etty's gone. It
takes such a time, and is so tiresome and awkward."</p>

<p>" 'Tis a waste of time, it seems to me," said Biddy. "Takes
somethin' more'n a bit of curly hair to do the thrick. So it
do."</p>

<p>"Really, Biddy, you try me out of all patience," cried Miss
Monaugh, testily. "According to your idea, I should cut my hair off
and go naked."</p>

<p>"Faith, ye'd be more attractive if ye did," Biddy answered.</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh tossed her head, a look of dull disdain in her
face.</p>

<p>"An' ye're goin' over to Widow Keaton's?" Biddy pursued
presently.</p>

<p>"I am," Miss Monaugh replied, nodding.</p>

<p>"Phwat in th' world are ye goin' over there for at all?"</p>

<p>"I arranged to meet George Wrightson there. I have a little
business to transact with him. Also, I wish to speak to them about
the approaching nuptials."</p>

<p>"Th' Lord save us! Is she goin' to make up to him?"</p>

<p>"Is he going to marry her, you mean. I don't know when it's to
be, but I shall know all about it before lunch."</p>

<p>"Of course you will. An' here I'm left to do all th' work an' Mr
Lynton comin' over for a day's fishin' wid th' old man. He's
beginnin' to ramble, to be sure. I s'pose he finds it lonesome like
now Leonard's gone."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Miss Monaugh returned. "I'll be back for lunch,
so you'll have all the afternoon and evening to gossip with
him."</p>

<p>" 'Tis yeself ought to be a little attractive to him," said
Biddy. "He's a decent man, an' rale good company, Jo."</p>

<p>"So are others," Jo replied, darkly. She picked up a serviette
and examined the ivory ring. Biddy brought the tea in and set it on
the side board.</p>

<p>"Sing out to the old man, Jo. He's clanin' th' flowers out of
the wades somewhere."</p>

<p>"Cleaning the weeds out of the flowers, you mean," Jo
corrected.</p>

<p>"Indade I don't," said Biddy. "The old amhadaun dunno a flower
from a wade. He just makes a guess at it, an' 'tis a fade to a
shmell he guesses wrong. There was me bed o' what-d'yer-call-'ems,
wid some pigwade growin' in it. I showed him which was pigwade an'
which was what-d'yer-call'ems; an', bedad, whin I wint to see how
he was gettin' along wid his job, there was all me lovely
what-d'yer-call-'ems pulled up be th' roots, an' th' dirty pigwade
left in the bed. Sure, the old fool's goin' off his chump."</p>

<p>"Bat you must remember, Biddy," said Jo, more leniently, "Myles
isn't an experienced horticulturist. He does his best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He do&mdash;in the distructin' line. That's about all. Sind a
yell out o' the windy there. Sure, the tay 'ill be cold, an' th'
day's goin' an' nothin' done."</p>

<p>Myles came in, wearing bo-yangs, and dragging his feet like a
working bullock. He sat down at the head of the table, took up the
carving-knife, examined it carefully, and ran his thumb along the
edge.</p>

<p>&quot;D'ye want th' grindstone?" asked Biddy, watchin' him with
arms akimbo.</p>

<p>"Whar's steel?" asked Myles.</p>

<p>"In th' yard where ye left it whin ye killed lasht," said Biddy.
" 'Tis lucky yer head's screwed on. So it is."</p>

<p>Myles picked up another knife, and, having slashed the two
together, proceeded with the carving of a cold joint.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Miss Monaugh immediately betook herself to
Gimbo. The punctual George was ensconced in a big, cushioned chair,
toying with a piece of cotton, while a kitten lay on its back at
his feet clawing at the lower end of it. Little things like that
amused George. Already he looked upon Gimbo house as his own, and
made himself thoroughly at home.</p>

<p>The widow was sitting at the sewing machine, preparing her own
trousseau, as Miss Monaugh remarked, on entering.</p>

<p>"I'm getting a few things ready," the widow admitted. "I've
'ardly got a dress fit to go to a dog-fight in, an' yer want to
look something decent at a time like this."</p>

<p>"Of course," her visitor assented. &quot;This is an occasion
that occurs but once in a lifetime to most people. With some, like
yourself, for instance, it&mdash;it repeats."</p>

<p>"Aye, George chipped in, "an' with some people it's a 'casion
that don't occur at all. Now, that's darn curious, ain't it?"</p>

<p>The spinster winced, and her dark eyes flashed angrily. "Getting
ready for marriage is a momentous thing for maidens," she went on:
"They're in a flurry all the while, and don't know half they want.
With you, of course, it's different. As I said, you've been married
before, and know by experience what's required."</p>

<p>"She's 'ad a hopportunity o' judgin', which you haven't, Jo,"
said George. Jo pretended not to hear him, and went on in a dry,
matter-of-fact way:</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear that you have decided to change your name
again, and must take this opportunity of congratulating you. I'm
sure I wish you every happiness, though, I suppose, it will be a
little hard for you to lose the old home."</p>

<p>The widow shifted uneasily, and looked quickly at George, on
whose face there was a puzzled expression. It was no secret to Miss
Monaugh that George coveted the widow's property, that is, Gimbo
homestead and lands; nor was it unknown to her that he possessed
nothing apart from his teams and a small selection. She had an idea
of helping him to build, but that was a kernel that was not
advanced enough to burst from its casement yet.</p>

<p>But for his drinking and gambling proclivities, George might
have been a rich man. He repented sometimes, when he was alone, and
his thoughts took that course. But invariably he ended his
cogitations with the reflection that it was all in a lifetime, and
a man might as well have all the enjoyment he could while he lived.
He would be a long while dead.</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh smiled. She took it for granted that nothing now
would part them, and was confident of her ability to do with George
as she wished.</p>

<p>"What game now Jo?" asked that gentleman. Jo's only response was
a stony stare. The widow looked up, resting her arms on the stand
of the sewing machine.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the will?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Often," Miss Monaugh replied. "You know, Mr Lethcote is one of
the executors."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Lethcote; Brexton Battye an' Edwin Lynton. Don't you
think it's a fool of a will to go an' make?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no. I consider it very sensible will:"</p>

<p>"But where's the sense come in.?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see, your marrying again is to be considered as more
unfavourable than otherwise to your children. The property would be
at the mercy of your husband." She looked meaningly at George. "Mr
Keaton did quite right in protecting the interests of his sons; and
he naturally expected that, if you married again, you wouldn't
require the place, as your husband would provide a home for
you."</p>

<p>"A bark hut in th' scrub," the widow sneered. "I reckon half th'
wimen are better single. They ken dress themselves decent, if they
do 'ave to go to service. An' they 'ave comfortable rooms, an' good
tucker, an' money of their own to spend as they like&mdash;go to a
dance or a play, or anywhere else, for th' matter o' that. But when
they're married they've scarce got a stitch to put on. Always in
rags, always slavin' an' stuck everlastin' in one place like a
lamp-post."</p>

<p>"Of course, it's nice to have some independence, and fine
clothes," Miss Monaugh assented. "But that isn't everything in the
making of happiness. Fine clothes, after all, are only dead
adornments. There is more satisfaction in having a man than
stagnating in fine clothes."</p>

<p>"Now yev've said it, Jo," cried George, repeating it slowly to
himself. "Ruther like them sentiments. 'More sat'sfaction havin' a
real live man than bein' a stag eatin' fine clothes.' Must r'member
that, Jo."</p>

<p>Jo looked at him with withering scorn.</p>

<p>"You was talkin' about a will," George resumed, unabashed.
"Isn't this place your'n, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 's long's I'm a widder, but when I chuck off the weeds it
goes to Mark."</p>

<p>"Do, it?"</p>

<p>The widow nodded.</p>

<p>"Why didn't yer say so before?"</p>

<p>"What's it matter?" the widow demanded. She faced him sharply.
"Is it me or the 'ouse you want?"</p>

<p>"You, of course!" George answered with emphasis. "But it kinder
'urts me feelings to see th' old place goin' to him. He'll never
work to keep it together."</p>

<p>"Mark Keaton works harder than you do, George, and is already
making money," Miss Monaugh informed him.</p>

<p>"Must 'ave started purty recent," George remarked.</p>

<p>"Mark has always been diligent," Miss Monaugh reproved
severely.</p>

<p>"I'm not sayin' enything agin his intelligence," George drawled.
&quot;He's got enough o' that to keep away from hard graft. Him an'
work fell out at the fust go off. 'S regards splosh, I ain't got
nuthin' to blow about, but I'd back my forty years' gatherin' agin
his, for all that."</p>

<p>"Yer might' fall in th' pot like yer did th' other day," the
widow snapped with sudden ire.</p>

<p>"Don't you make no error!" cried George, and his back seemed to
stiffen.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" said Miss Monaugh. "I hope you two are not going
to quarrel. It would be so inopportune. By the bye, when is the
wedding to be?"</p>

<p>"I dunno&mdash;an' I don't care," the widow snapped. &quot;I
don't see th' use o' gettin' married at all." She turned over the
hem of a dress, and ran it under the needle. George drew a long
face, and remained silent.</p>

<p>"I am sure you would be happier as George's wife than living
here by yourself," said Miss Monaugh, consolingly. "George, I must
tell you, is my cousin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your cousin!" the widow exclaimed; dropping her work. This was
the spinster's trump card.</p>

<p>"That knocks her!" said George, grinning. "Ruther surprises 'er
to hear as I'm 'ighly connected. Worst of it is," he added,
scratching his head, "they won't own me."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" said the widow, somewhat conciliated. "I never
knowed that before."</p>

<p>"Nobody else knowed it. Jo took care of that."</p>

<p>"And I don't wish it to be known now till after the wedding,"
Miss Monaugh rejoined. "You are so indecorous, George&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jumpin' Jemimah!" cried George. I knowed I was a purty bad egg,
but never reckoned I was enything like that. In-de&mdash;what th'
&mdash; is it agin?"</p>

<p>"I am ashamed of you," Miss Monaugh went on. "You are never
respectable; you make no effort to better yourself."</p>

<p>"You an' me warn't made for th' same track." George returned.
"Ye're doin' all right in this country, Jo. Don't you leave
it."</p>

<p>"You are a plebeian. Your own family are ashamed of you," Miss
Monaugh continued severely.</p>

<p>"Dunno what a flea-bean is," said George, rubbing his chin. "As
fer th' High-an'-mightys bein' ashamed o' me, that's nuthin' new.
I'm used to that sort o' thing. 'Twouldn't surprise me if I was to
be ashamed o' meself someday."</p>

<p>"It would surprise me," Miss Monaugh declared with a brisk
inclination of the head. "You ought really to conduct yourself
better&mdash;being my Aunt Mary's child. Poor dear! Do you ever
hear from her?"</p>

<p>"Me?" cried George, chuckling at the bare idea. "No," he
drawled, "I ain't quite stylish enough for them. Neither Crogans
nor Wrightsons ever trouble me."</p>

<p>"Your aunt was a Miss Crogan?" said the widow, addressing Miss
Monaugh. "Is she George's mother?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, she is."</p>

<p>"Dear me! To think of that now!" said the widow, musingly.
"They, are such high people, too, I've heard."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how it happened," said Miss Monaugh, answering
the widow's inquiring gaze. "George was always a scapegrace. He ran
away from home when a boy&mdash;went off with a swagman. They
travelled as father and son, right away into the wilds of
Queensland&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something like a muttered oath from George interrupted her. He
ducked suddenly, and whipped up the leg of his nether garment.</p>

<p>"What's bit yer?" the widow asked.</p>

<p>George screwed a bristly shank round and searched energetically
under the folded tweed, making a lightning grab at one place, and
scratching vigorously at another. "Flamin' bug or something's
assaultin' me," he said.</p>

<p>"There's no bugs 'ere&mdash; unless you brought 'em," the widow
dissented.</p>

<p>"Must be a flea, then," George surmised, baring more leg. He had
no socks on.</p>

<p>"Might be fleas," the widow admitted. "Pincher's always layin'
about inside."</p>

<p>"George!" the spinster cried in shocked tones.</p>

<p>"That's me!"</p>

<p>"How dare you!"</p>

<p>George continued in pursuit of the insect. "Can't stand fleas,"
he said. "Makes you feel like a blackfeller's dorg."</p>

<p>He had another exhaustive look round, then gave it up. "Must
'ave got away," he concluded.</p>

<p>The spinster coughed softly, and resumed: "Mr Wrightson in the
meantime was searching high and low for Master George. He found him
six years after when overlanding with cattle. He was then
stock-riding on a station three hundred miles away from his home.
He was brought back, and everything was done to repair the evil
effects of his wandering. But George was not to be repaired. He
soon ran away again. His father followed him to the Dawson River,
and there lost sight of him. Seven years passed, and one day a
ragged tramp called at Mr Wrightson's and asked for a situation. A
stray word or two aroused the old gentleman's suspicions. 'Who are
you?' he asked. 'Who are me?' cried the tramp. 'Well, that's pure,
that is. Fetch out th' old woman an' see if she'll say who are yer?
She'd know me old hide if she seen it hangin' out on th' fence. I'm
George Wrightson!' It was indeed the prodigal son. His father gave
him some clothes and money, and told him to go. 'Go!' cried George,
abashed. 'Doncher want me?' 'No,' his father answered. 'You have
chosen your bed, so lie on it. Henceforth you are no son of mine.'
George smiled grimly. 'You&mdash;you're a bit sudding, old feller,'
he said, 'too sudding.' He never went home again."</p>

<p>"Well, that beats all I ever heard!" said the widow, looking at
George in a new light. "You never said anything about that. What
'ave yer got to say for ye' self?"</p>

<p>George jerked his thumb towards Miss Monaugh. "Ask Jo," he
said.</p>

<p>"I forbade him to speak of it," she explained. "Now, of course,
it doesn't matter, so far as we are concerned. I considered it my
duty to inform you of these facts on hearing of your engagement.
Now that you know, I hope you don't think any the worse of
him?"</p>

<p>"Worse, no! I think more of him. Ye're quite a hero,
George&mdash;an' Miss Monaugh's cousin, too! Well, I declare, if
that ain't as good as I've heard since I dunno when."</p>

<p>"At least," Miss Monaugh rejoined, "he's to be made a hero, for
Mark's book is founded on his adventures in the bush. He's the
sundowner."</p>

<p>"How did Mark know?" asked the widow.</p>

<p>"I told him the adventures as being those of a Queensland
acquaintance of mine, and instructed him to take Kilfloggin as a
model."</p>

<p>"Jumpin' Jemima!" cried George. "In a book&mdash;makin' fine
speeches, doin' wonders I couldn't manage nohow, an' muggin' some
purty gel I never knowed&mdash;Too sudding, Jo!"</p>

<p>"Do you really think he'll ever do any good at it?" the widow
inquired with a little enthusiasm; and Miss Monaugh was glad to see
that there was a little motherly pride in this woman after all.</p>

<p>&quot;There is abundant reason to hope for the best results,"
Miss Monaugh replied. "I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>The widow leaned meditatively on the machine, her hands
interlaced, staring into vacancy. Presently she said: "Mr M'Gurren
was tellin' me yesterday it was no use goin' into that sort of
thing without capital."</p>

<p>"Mr M'Gurren!"</p>

<p>"He often comes here now. He's not a bad old sort, an' he amuses
me th' way he talks."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh made a grimace, and looked at her watch.</p>

<p>"Dear me, it's after twelve! I really must be going."</p>

<p>She rose and smoothed out her skirt.</p>

<p>"Won't you stop to dinner?" the widow asked graciously.</p>

<p>"No, I thank you. I promised to be home in time for lunch, and
Mrs Lethoote will be annoyed if I keep her waiting. I had no idea
it was so late."</p>

<p>"Mindger come to th' weddin', Jo!" George bawled after her. "Yer
mightn't 'ave another charnce."</p>

<p>"Good morning!"</p>

<p>George chuckled as Jo put up her parasol and departed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c18" id="c18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p>From time to time letters came from Mark and Ethel. The latter
was having a jolly time at Nanango. She asked after Mr M'Gurren.
How was the old fogey spending his time? He was spending a great
deal of it in Widow Keaton's company, she was informed, and it was
rumoured that they were engaged.</p>

<p>"He comes to Fairymede very seldom," Miss Monaugh wrote. "It
seems to me that I have only succeeded in ridding you of him at the
cost of losing him myself. He is flirting outrageously with the
widow, apparently out of spite. Mrs Keaton shows very bad form in
allowing it, considering that she is engaged to George Wrightson,
and cannot possibly hope to hold her head any higher. Mr M'Gurren
may one day regret his behaviour. I am not going to be trifled
with. I have Other admirers; as Mr M'Gurren may yet find to his
sorrow. I shall only wait for him another year."</p>

<p>It was good news to Miss Monaugh to hear that Leonard was going
to manage Woorowolong Station on his return.</p>

<p>"I always told Leonard he could get that billet if he exerted
&nbsp;himself a little," Miss Monaugh asserted. She was seated in
the stern of the boat, her hand trailing in the water. Mr Lynton of
Druton was plying the oars. He rowed up the lagoon to the bridge.
Here the boat was moored, and Mr Lynton courteously assisted his
expectant companion to land.</p>

<p>"I just want to see how my tree is doing," Miss Monaugh
explained. "Neglect at the start is the cause of most trees not
doing well here."</p>

<p>"Have you found out anything with regard to the old tree?" Mr
Lynton asked, looking at the few leafless branches that remained,
and Miss Monaugh answered unblushingly, "Nothing." She was
loosening the soil around the young tree.</p>

<p>"I believe," he added, "there is a little romance attached to
these trees that make them so much thought of by the people
here."</p>

<p>"Yes; each one has its own little story," she replied, and her
eyes grew wistful.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear them," he went on. "Will you take me
round Miss Monaugh, and tell me what they are?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure. There's very little to tell, and nothing to
interest anyone but those concerned. This one was planted by my
dear brother, Pat, on the spot where he confessed his love to Biddy
O'Meilly who is Mrs Lethcote now. Pat dug the hole, and Biddy put
the tree in. Then each took a sprig and kept it as a memento. Poor
Pat is dead now, and Biddy is married again. That second tree, near
the bridge, marks the spot where she used to meet Myles Lethcote
while she was staying with the Keatons. Do you see that little
mound at the lower side? They sat there, and Myles, following Pat's
precedent, planted a tree when they were betrothed. The third was
planted by Lavinia Courtnay. She was staying with the Battyes, you
know. She came over with Mr Battye and Leonards mother, then a
girl, to look at Fairymede. The two latter pulled round in the
boat, and Myles, and Lavinia walked across. While waiting for the
others, he proposed to her there. She was a good woman, the best
friend I ever had. The next tree was planted by Ethel; and,
strangely enough, it was under its branches that Mark first asked
her to be his wife. That is all."</p>

<p>"Very pretty," said Mr Lynton, "each one having an amorous
meaning, and the whole forming a Lover's Walk, or, as Mr M'Gurren
calls it, 'The Tryst.' But you have only spoken of four. There was
a fifth, which, thanks to the unknown vandals, has made way for
this mite. Had that one no little secret attached to it?"</p>

<p>"No-no!" She was leaning on his arm, dawdling along the slope
towards the boat. He stopped where the young tree was planted.</p>

<p>"This, I believe, Miss Monaugh, was grown by your own hands. It
would be a pity to let it grow up without being distinguished.
'T'wouldn't be in keeping with the rest, and lovers would pass it
by as a lonely thing, beneath their notice. Let us consecrate it.
Like that tree, we are two lonely souls. Let us throw our lots
together, and be man and wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Lynton&mdash;I&mdash;I never thought of such a thing!"
Miss Monaugh cried, blushing furiously. In reality she had expected
it as soon as she had begun to speak. There was something in his
manner, in his glances that warned her. But it was all so new and
pleasing, this sudden realisation of a lifelong dream to receive a
proposal of marriage from a man&mdash;a real, live man,&mdash;that
she was startled out of her wits. She was overwhelmed; she was
agitated&mdash;frightened. She stood there irresolute, with
heightened cheeks, her eyes afire and her heart in a flutter. Mr
Lynton was a cool, bold man. There was nothing of the passionate
ardour and impulsiveness of the youthful lover about him. He had
long grown out of that period, and spoke with a calmness and
sobriety that a young girl might take for indifference, not to say
cold-bloodedness, and perhaps resent. But to Miss Monaugh it was as
the dulcet voice of a sylvan idyll whispering in the bowers of
Dreamland. And yet she had never thought of him as a lover!</p>

<p>"What does it matter whether you thought of it or not? We are
well suited for each other, and I'm sure you'll learn to love me if
you do not now. We are not young and foolish. We look for more than
love. You'll want for nothing at Druton. I'll be a devoted husband.
There's no more to be said. The question is, will you or will you
not?"</p>

<p>"It's so sudden, Mr Lynton, that I really don't know what to
say," she answered breathlessly. "You have taken me by surprise.
And it's a question that needs some consideration. It doesn't do to
act in a haphazard fashion. I like to look before I leap. Besides I
have been so happy&mdash;single&mdash;that I don't think I can be
any better off by changing my present state."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! A single woman is only half a woman. It's time
you had a husband of your own&mdash; that is&mdash;I mean, a home
of your own. All women do, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's expected of us that we should. I don't know why it
is. But men can be bachelors to the end of their days, and be just
as much respected as the benedicts; but if a woman comes to be an
old maid she is ridiculed. All sorts of nasty things are said about
her. It's a shame. Woman has just as much right to remain single as
a man."</p>

<p>"I beg to differ from you there. Woman is man's companion. He
has to feed, clothe and shelter her. Many a man finds it difficult
to support himself; others, though comfortable enough themselves,
are not sufficiently well off to keep a wife as she should be kept,
and are too honourable to drag her lower than the position in which
he finds her. Such men deserve credit for keeping to themselves.
For woman there is no excuse. Unless she is morally bad, or what we
term 'fast,' she will find some worthy one willing to espouse her,
and the offer of that man should not be rejected."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh maintained a breathless silence. If she could have
rushed away and had a "good think"! If she could have consulted
with Ethel, or Myles, or even with Biddy! She felt incompetent in
the matter of deciding for herself. She might accept him; but,
then&mdash;what about M'Gurren? He might come round again when he
had got over his disappointment in regard to Ethel, and propose at
any moment. If she engaged herself to him while betrothed to Edwin
Lynton, her misdemeanour would be bandied from mouth to mouth. They
would call her a jilt, and she could not be called a jilt. She must
at all hazard maintain her dignity and honour in the eyes of the
public of Yeerong.</p>

<p>"I am waiting for your answer, Miss Monaugh," Mr Lynton reminded
her. She started and coloured to the eyes. Would this big man put
his arm round her and kiss her if she said "yes?" Would it seem
indelicate, or worse, if she snapped him up at the first asking,
when there had been no courtship?</p>

<p>Then she stammered, while she felt that she would like to be
married at once: "I am sorry, Mr Lynton, but I can't give you an
answer to-day. If you will&mdash;er&mdash;call the day after
tomorrow I&mdash;I will tell you."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh regretted having made the request almost as soon as
the words were uttered. The day after to-morrow seemed such a long
way ahead. She might have lessened the agony by some hours had he
pressed her but Mr Lynton was a patient wooer, and nodding
acquiescence, he commenced to talk about the beauty and sweetness
of gum blossoms.</p>

<p>They strolled slowly homeward, and when he had taken his
departure Miss Monaugh, over the supper table, recounted to Biddy
and Myles exactly what had happened during the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Begob, thin, we ought to chalk it up," was Biddy's unfeeling
remark, which evoked a chuckle from the delighted Myles. He had a
soft spot in his heart for Jo, and he liked to see her have her
proper share of the world's good things. "An' why' th' divil didn't
you say 'yis' at once, you fool?" she demanded in an altered
tone.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask your opinion," Miss Monaugh returned.</p>

<p>"My opinion indade! Phwat 'ave I to do wid it? Ugh! You ought to
think yeself lucky to get th' chance o' marryin' widout anybody's
opinion at all. But some people are niver satisfied. If ye give
thim a pig they want a shtye to put him in."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no need to make a fuss over it," said Jo, testily.
"I haven't rejected the man."</p>

<p>"You haven't, so; but thin he mightn't come agin."</p>

<p>"Don't reject un, Jo," Myles advised. "I've knowed un goin' on
for twenty year, an' baint seen nowt about un to pick at. He'll
make 'ee a good mate, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"The Lord save us, where could she get a better?" cried Biddy,
wrathfully. &quot;She ought 'ave rushed him, so she ought. Beggars
can't be choosers, mind that, an' nixt time he comes spooneywinkin'
around yer if ye ken fetch him on agin&mdash;just clinch th'
bargain there an' thin, an' none o' yer palaverin' about it."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Miss Monaugh with some asperity, "I have more
strings than one to my bow."</p>

<p>"Ye'd better fasten on to wan of thim thin," Biddy retorted.
"They're shlippery things, Jo, an' ye're gettin' purty stale
now."</p>

<p>In the course of further conversation Miss Monaugh learned that
Mr M'Gurren had made a call in her absence, and in declining an
invitation to dinner the following evening, gave as an excuse that
he was engaged to dine with the widow at Gimbo.</p>

<p>"Big George be hangin' fire wee bit long," said Myles. "If un
doan' watch unself Mac 'ull 'cut un out."</p>

<p>"Bad cess to him, he's always shtuch over there," cried Biddy,
frowning. "Phwat do he want to be pokin' over there for at all? He
niver wint next or nigh th' place while Etty was here. 'Tis to be
hoped she'll be back soon. 'Twas a fool I was, lettin' her go.
We're a dhry lot, Jo. There's no more magnetism in us than there is
in a fish bone. So there isn't."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is Ethel's absence that has effected him. He
must have found some stronger attraction at Gimbo," Miss Monaugh
suggested.</p>

<p>"Has he!" Biddy retorted. "That's all you know about it. Just
wait till she comes back, an' you'll see him flyin' over here,
begob, like a shtreak o' scared lightnin' tumblin' down a graised
lamp-post."</p>

<p>"H'm!" Miss Monaugh had her own opinions on the matter. She
decided at once how to act with regard to the refractory
M'Gurren.</p>

<p>"Things are coming to a crisis." she soliloquised. "I shall soon
know the truth."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c19" id="c19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p>On the pretence of seeing Wrightson, Miss Monaugh called upon
the widow the following afternoon. M'Gurren was there; but there
was no sign of George.</p>

<p>"Dear me, how unfortunate! I made sure I would find him
here."</p>

<p>"Ye a' mair likely ta find him in his humpy owre yon," said
M'Gurren. "Loh, I was owre there yestereen lookin' for a stirk I'd
lost, an' there he was on th' brud o' his back, readin' Ned Kelly,
an' sich a fine day to be oot amang the timber ta. Heigh, he's an
eedle mon."</p>

<p>"I have always found him industrious," said Miss Monaugh,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Oots, wuman, ye ken as weel as I dae the mon's an awfu'
drunkard. Evra bawbee he maks gangs ta the publican. He wadna fash
himsel' muckle aboot wairk at a' if he cud get his liquor wi'out
it. Th' mistress can telt ye hoo he used ta cum here wi' his
bottles, an' gang awa' hame in th' middle o' th' 'nicht drunk as a
lud. Buit he winna cam here ony mair."</p>

<p>"I hope you have not quarrelled, Mrs Keaton," Miss Monaugh said,
in some doubt, focussing the latter's downcast face.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered that lady. &quot;But the fact is&mdash;
Aleck, you'd better tell her. I must see to my bread."</p>

<p>Aleck! The truth flashed upon the mind of Miss Monaugh, and her
heart seemed to jump into her mouth. She felt cold and white.</p>

<p>"Weel," said Aleck, throwing one leg over the other, and
complacently stroking his beard, "the fact is, she's na longer th'
Widow Keaton she hae changed her name."</p>

<p>"She is married?"</p>

<p>"That's sae."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"Mesel'."</p>

<p>"To you!"</p>

<p>"Aye. She i' th' Mistress M'Gurren. We were marrit twa days
syne."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" the spinster exclaimed, completely forgetting
herself in the astonishment that this announcement occasioned her.
Her face was the hue of a scraped pig, her nervousness painfully
manifest. All the bitterest feelings of her nature for a moment
held sway; spitefulness, envy, hatred against the widow&mdash;now
widow no longer, but the helpmeet of the one she had ear-marked for
her own, had striven to gain, had cast all modesty to the winds,
and gone beyond the limits of decency, in her unwomanly wooing,
only to discover on a sudden, when there had appeared no obstacle
in the way of achievement, that she had ignominiously lost; This
low, vulgar woman, in her tawdry, indecorous flimsies, had ousted
her; the pessimistic female, who had neither breeding nor
accomplishments, whose obesity and rubicundity were the results of
inebriation and gluttony; this illiterate, shameless, brazen old
trollop had caught the wealthy laird in her indifferently cast net,
whilst she&mdash;the proud and stately Johanna Monaugh, with all
her utilitarian views and disregard of conventionalities&mdash;had
been contemptuously ignored&mdash;spurned&mdash;scorned! Her pride
was deeply wounded; her hands clenched as though they itched to
scratch the wretch who had so basely insulted her; and she was
filled with sickly qualms as she conceived the base character of
that woman who, practising the role of a confidential friend, had
surreptitiously cajoled her, and appropriated that to which her
claim was the most infinitesimal. Only a few hours before she had
breathed ambrosial sweets, now the flames of hell raged within her
breast, and she glared at M'Gurren and the slattern he called wife,
with the bitter hatred of a scorned woman.</p>

<p>"Ye dinna congratulate me, lass," Mr M'Gurren reminded her. This
was adding fuel to an already blazing fire.</p>

<p>"Congratulate you!" she cried, with flashing eyes. "Do you know
what you have done? Are you aware that this woman was all but
married to George Wrightson?"</p>

<p>"I ken she was engeeged ta him, buit that was bruk off long
syne."</p>

<p>"Indeed it was not. George Wrightson does not know at the
present moment that his affaire d' amour is at end. Only the other
day she was preparing her trousseau under his very nose, and
arranging for the wedding. What day it was fixed for I don't know.
But it must be near at hand. The poor fool will come to claim her,
as he has a right to, and find her your wife! She has treated him
abominably; and you, who are her confederate, have acted a part
wholly at variance with the conduct of a gentleman. I'm&mdash;
Really, I'm thoroughly disgusted with the whole business."</p>

<p>"I canna see hoo it concerns ye, lass," said M'Gurren
quietly.</p>

<p>"How it concerns me!" the spinster screeched. "George Wrightson
is my cousin, and naturally I take an interest in his affairs.
Marriage would have been his salvation. Now he will be ruined. He
will drink himself to death. That will be your doing. You don't
know yet half the mischief you have done. Do you know the old
adage: 'Marry in haste, repent at leisure?' You will repent in a
very short time. Retribution will come, mark me, and you'll get
your desserts. I know it. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>Mrs M'Gurren came in, carrying a small parcel in her hand. "Miss
Monaugh, this is some of our weddin' cake for yerself an' Mrs
Lethcote."</p>

<p>"Indeed, madam." said the spinster, bristling again, "as you
didn't consider it worth your while to invite us, after all our
kindnesses to you and Mr M'Gurren, you can keep your cake.''</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Mrs M'Gurren, firing up at once. "Yer needn't
get into such a mighty tear about it. Yer not the only one,
madam."</p>

<p>"Oots, wuman, ye mauna quarrel noo," M'Gurren interrupted. "I'll
telt ye th' truth, lass. Ye ken th' folk aboot here wadna lookit
kindly on oor nuptials. Sae I tuk Mark alang wi' me ta toon last
nicht, an' we were marrit at the registry. There was na party at
a'."</p>

<p>"You told me you were married two days ago?" said Miss Monaugh,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Sae I did, lass. I was just ha'in' a joke wi' ye. Take the
cakes, lass, an' dinna let there be a difference batween us."</p>

<p>"Thank you. If it pleases Mrs Lethcote I will send a servant for
it."</p>

<p>"A servant!" cried M'Gurren, indignantly. "It may be harder,
lass, ta find th' flunkey thun ta carry the cake home wi' ye."</p>

<p>"Make no mistake on that point, Mr M'Gurren," she returned with
an emphatic little bow. &quot;I wish you a good afternoon."</p>

<p>Then, without further words, and still in a temper, Miss Monaugh
bounced out of the room. As she passed through the broken gate she
heard Mrs M'Gurren humming, in evident satisfaction:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">"Alas and alack,<br>
She&mdash;came&mdash;back,<br>
An' she'd a naughty little twinkle in her eye."</p>

<p>The spinster tossed her head in scorn, and hurried homewards
with a flutter of skirts, and oscillation of ribbons and laces,
there to confide to Biddy "the disgraceful conduct of Moneybags and
that female."</p>

<p>Biddy at first was speechless with rage and horror, then she
stormed and raved, and stamped her foot on the floor till
everything in the room shook and rattled. Old Myles retreated
quietly into the next room, and there be shook hands with himself
with much enthusiasm, and chuckled in secret over the good news.
"Etty 'ill have nowt to fear from un now," he soliloquised, tossing
his head waggishly, "an' she'll be right slap glad on't, I'll
warrant."</p>

<p>At dinner Biddy denounced him as a viper, and a two-faced
thing.</p>

<p>"There's no mahn in him; he hasn't th' spirit of 'a louse. He's
only a thing," she raved. "He shall niver come anigh my house
agin&mdash;niver! Myles, I strictly forbid ye ever to spake to th'
spalpeen agin, mind that."</p>

<p>"Doan want to speak to un." Myles beamed with delight.</p>

<p>"I should think not, indade! After all he used to say about
Mother Keaton&mdash;runnin' her down to the lowest, an' goin' on
about Mark so&mdash;to turn round an' marry the owld cow. The Lord
save us! An' th' way he used to talk to me about Etty an' I dunno
how many times he asked me for her. Johanna, take care she niver
associates wid him. By the grace o' God, she shall niver be
polluted be sich company. Niver will she spake to him&mdash;or I'll
spiflicate her. Just moind that now, Johanna."</p>

<p>Johanna answered nothing. She was intent upon her own dismal
thoughts. They were in nowise lightened by the mornings mail, which
brought her a note from Mr Edwin Lynton stating that he had been
called upon to act as deputy for Leonard until that young gentleman
returned from the north, and consequently could not hope to see her
again for some time, unless she favoured him with a visit to
Woorowolong. It was not a love letter, merely a formal announcement
that might have been written by anybody. Her heart sank within her
as the thought struck her that he had mistaken her procrastination
for dismissal, and had abandoned his suit for her hand. It was
feasible, for could he not have called on his way to the
station&mdash;if only just to obtain her answer. She had asked him
to come, and regretted more than ever that she had done so. It made
her feel so small and mean. Perhaps he was indifferent. Old age
does not become infatuated with a woman's charms like youth. He may
have only proposed in a moment of generosity and gallantry, perhaps
out of devilment, thinking that she was already another's, and
would, of course, refuse him.</p>

<p>She carried the letter to her room and wept over it, reread it
and wept again.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I hesitate!" she lamented, her elbows on the
dressing table, and propping her chin up with her palms. "Why
didn't I snap him up, and thus have made sure of one? I have
learned a lesson. Never again will I put off till to-morrow a man I
can have to-day. I could have been Edwin's darling this moment but
for my folly. Now I may lose him. Even if he is sincere, he may not
be courageous enough to ask twice. Well, I could speak&mdash; Ah, I
have it! I will reply to his note, and give him an answer. There is
nothing improper in doing that."</p>

<p>She brightened immediately on grasping this brilliant idea, and,
without loss of time, produced pen and paper and dashed off a
billet doux to Mr Lynton:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Your note brought with it much disappointment. I
was expecting and wishing for you every minute when I received it.
Since I saw you last I have discovered that my heart is not my own.
I have learned the truth of the old saying that absence makes the
heart grow fonder. It does seem an age since we separated, each day
drags away so wearily. I am lonely without you. Do come, or
write.&mdash; Yours for ever, Johanna."</p>

<p>"That ought to fetch him." she mused, after reading it over to
see that it was all right and proper. Her musings carried her along
the old beaten of the expectant woman. She spoilt many envelopes by
addressing them to her future self, "Mrs Lynton" and "Mrs Johanna
Lynton" and "Mrs Edwin Lynton, Druton," and she sketched a postage
stamp in one corner, and two or three imaginary postmarks on the
back and front, just to see how it would look. Then her thoughts
ran on wedding dresses and bridesmaids, and all the silly
appointments with which modern custom surrounds the application of
the connecting link that makes man and woman one indissoluble
whole, till she had almost forgotten the letter.</p>

<p>She re-read the precious document again, then sealed it
carefully, and at the first opportunity despatched it to her "Dear
Edwin." How easy it was to transfer that term of endearment from
Aleck to Edwin!"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c20" id="c20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the bibaceous Kilfloggin called on the false widow at
Gimbo to see to the final arrangements for their wedding. He was
passably sober, and had donned a clean shirt and dispensed with his
bo-yangs.</p>

<p>"How dyer do, Mary? Come to see if yer had things shipshape for
the parson."</p>

<p>"Oh, yer needn't trouble yerself about th' parson. He's not
wanted eny more."</p>

<p>"Not wanted!" cried George. "Surely ter God y' ain't goin' to
jib on it now?"</p>

<p>Look here, Mr Wrightson," said the widow, bracing herself, "it's
no use beatin' about the bush. I might's well tell yer the truth at
once. I thought it over, an' I ses, 'Well, I won't do it without my
boys' consent.' So I wrote to 'em, an' they said, 'If you want to
marry, take Aleck M'Gurren. He can give you a good home, an' keep
you like a lady. George Wrightson drinks, an' he's got nothing.'
"</p>

<p>"Got nuthin'!" cried George. How do they know what I got? Might
'ave a darned sight more'n they have. I'll take my oath I ken make
a better splice than old Aleck M'Gurren, enyway."</p>

<p>"They've knowed Mr M'Gurren since they wur kids, an' I reckoned
it was good advice," she went on.</p>

<p>"Marry th' old Scotchman!" George iterated. "Jumpin' Jemima! y'r
must kid yerself. Why, a bloke like him 'ud never think o' lookin'
yer way, Mary! Though he ain't worth pickin' up as a man, he thinks
th' goldarned sun rises out o' one of his boots an' sets in th'
other."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, if you please. An' don't call me Mary. If me
husband heard yer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yer 'usband!"</p>

<p>"My husband," she repeated, nodding her head.</p>

<p>"Well, by cripes!" he gasped. &quot;Where'd yer get him?"</p>

<p>"I am Mrs M'Gurren," she informed him, reddening.</p>

<p>For a full minute George stood staring at her in speechless
amazement. Presently he laughed, and drew a flask of whisky from
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Here, 'ave a nip, old gel. 'T'll put yer in better humour."</p>

<p>But the old girl made a grimace, and waved him aside.</p>

<p>"Don't come near me with any o' that stuff, or I'll smash th'
bottle on the stones," she said, and there was venom in her
voice.</p>

<p>"What, not havin' any?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I'm not!"</p>

<p>Again George stared at her. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Mrs M'Gurren, eh? By gum, missus, this is a bit sudding."</p>

<p>"We won't haggle over that," she said. "An' I don't think Mr
M'Gurren would like to see you here."</p>

<p>"My troubles about M'Gurren!" said George. "There'll be precious
little of him left after you've had him a year. But don't fret
about me, missus. My shadder 'll be kep' off Gimbo grass. You make
no error!"</p>

<p>With these valedictory expressions he departed. He whistled
softly, as though he didn't mind but he was hard hit. Down the flat
he lifted his voice suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, my heart is broke&mdash;<br>
God knows it is!"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, as he had commenced, and thereafter, as a
musical genius, he was silent. What became of him may be told in a
few words. Now and again he would deliver a load of timber, and
Bill Sooley or Abe Watts, and sometimes Amelia Jane, would take the
team out for him, while he remained in Dumboon "knocking his cheque
down." At times he got paralytic; again he "saw things," and dodged
them wildly among the trees on his way to camp. In the scrubs he
sobered up, and would be moody till he got back to the pub. One day
the expected happened. George had paid another teamster to load his
waggon for him, and went out, drunk, to bring it in himself.
Crossing a gully he fell off his horse, and the wheel went over
him. Amelia Jane was riding behind, and hurried to his aid.</p>

<p>"Yer hurt, George?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Put yer cluver on, 'Melia; I'm goan ter take yer out," said
George, with a sickly smile.</p>

<p>"Why, split me if he ain't gone stark mad!" Amelia Jane
exclaimed. "George, you've gone an' busted yer biler dead
sure!"</p>

<p>"Stand over, Brown!"' said George, breathing hard. "Bang yer
eyes&mdash;mind to knock yer down!"</p>

<p>Amelia Jane got frightened, and coo-ee'd for help. Three or four
bullockies ran up. George smiled bravely, and even tried to
sing&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">Wrap me up in me stockwhip an' blanket,<br>
An' bury me deep down below,<br>
With me saddle an' quartpot for comp'ny,<br>
Down where th' coolabahs grow."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Sooley, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Ol' jinker's knocked me out," George answered. "Ruther sudding,
wasn't it? Too sudding&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was the end of Kilfloggin, and Miss Monaugh swore that she
would never forgive M'Gurren and that "disreputable female" for
having driven him to the deadly bottle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c21" id="c21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p>Midwinter saw Leonard and his wife domiciled at Woorowolong.
Ethel and Mark returned with them, the latter taking the billet of
book-keeper at the station as a pot-boiler. Mr Lynton returned to
his old haunts. Miss Monaugh had called on him at the station, and,
going home across the bush, she encounted Amelia Jane, who was hard
riding as usual on the old grey pony. She pulled up sharply, and
slewed a little off her course to meet the spinster.</p>

<p>" 'D yer see Strawberry enywhere?" she asked, dropping the reins
to do up her back hair.</p>

<p>"No, Amelia," said Miss Monaugh. "Have you lost that troublesome
beast again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a swine," Amelia Jane averred. "He won't stop like
another bullock, but pokes away in th' scrubs on his ace every time
he's let go. Dunno why father don't pole-axe th' cow. Got me rode
blind pretty near."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh was sorry, and hoped the refractory bovine would
soon be found. She did not want to talk today. She was eager to get
home to unburden herself of a great secret to Biddy. But Amelia
Jane was bristling with news just now, and hung on to her.</p>

<p>"Hear about Abe Watts?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What about him?" asked Jo.</p>

<p>"Spliced," said Amelia Jane.</p>

<p>"Go on!" cried Jo, a little interested.</p>

<p>"To Sarah from the Dairy," Amelia Jane went on.</p>

<p>"When did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Larst night. Great dance."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad they're happy." The spinster always took it for
granted that people were happy when they got married.</p>

<p>"Me an' Bill was there," Amelia Jane continued.</p>

<p>"How did you get on?"&mdash;absently.</p>

<p>Amelia Jane tittered, and pulled at the horse's mane.
&quot;Asked me to say when," she said.</p>

<p>"Did he? And when is it to be?"</p>

<p>"Next time he comes in."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm very glad, Amelia. I congratulate you. You were
sensible. Procrastination is the thief of love. I've had an
opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>"I s'pose you know Bill?" Amelia Jane inquired.</p>

<p>"I have seen him a few times," Miss Monaugh replied.</p>

<p>"Ain't a bad old stick when yer come to know him proper. Real
smart, too. Y' orter hear him performin' when he's stuck. Cripes,
he do jump an' holler, an' cracks like guns goin' off."</p>

<p>"He's a good shot, I've heard," Miss Monaugh remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, rippin'. Hits th' bull's-eye every pop. But I meant th' way
he cracks his whip. There's none of 'em comes up to him at that.
Never heard nobody swear like him neither."</p>

<p>"It's very wrong to swear," Miss Monaugh reproved. "You must use
your influence with him, Amelia, and try to reform him."</p>

<p>"But Bill's a champion," Amelia Jane protested. "It's just
lovely to hear him."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh smiled sweetly. "I am so glad you are going to be
settled," she repeated.</p>

<p>"I'll be done jiggin' about after Strawberry enyway," Amelia
Jane responded. "Must get along."</p>

<p>She whacked the old pony on the ribs and went off full speed
again. Miss Monaugh brushed along as rapidly as her dread of snakes
would permit, her dear old face radiant, and her heart throbbing
with goodwill to all creation. The hills and the scrubs had never
charmed her eyes as they did now and the warbling of the magpies,
and the chirrupping of parrots&mdash;every sound fell like sweetest
music on her ears. Her erstwhile prosaic world was an enchanted
land, and the palescent sunset was a dream of Heaven. The quiet old
cows browsing on the hills, the foals gambolling on the flat, and
the croak of the black shag down by the lagoon, all touched
responsive chords&mdash;associations of home and of long
ago&mdash;and filled her with, an indescribable happiness.</p>

<p>On reaching home she rushed in to Biddy to entrust her
immediately with her wonderful secret.</p>

<p>"Would you ever believe it, Biddy," she gasped, dropping
breathlessly into a chair.</p>

<p>Biddy regarded her with a frigid stare. "Got 'em again," she
said.</p>

<p>"I'm engaged!" Miss Monaugh concluded, swallowing huge gulps of
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Engaged!" repeated Biddy, contemptuously. "Indade, haven't you
enough to kape you widout goin' to service? I thought so, anyway.
Phwat's it ye' re goin' to be?"</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh pursed her lips in contempt. "Do you imagine I
could degrade myself by going out to service?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't" Biddy answered. "I imagine ye'd better ye'self a lot.
I've seen more women 'an you at service. You sed you were
engaged?"</p>

<p>"So I am."</p>

<p>"In what capacity, thin?"</p>

<p>"In a matrimonial capacity&mdash;if you'll have it that way. I
am going to be married."</p>

<p>Biddy threw up her hands and laughed loudly. "Ooh, the Lord save
us! Are ye goin' off 'at lasht?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean, am I going away, Biddy?"</p>

<p>" 'Tis off the shelf I mane. Sure, 'tis a harrowin' time ye've
been on it."</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh was annoyed, but tried to look as though she did
not care. "Mr Lynton, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's Mr Lynton thin! Ye did get him?"</p>

<p>"Biddy, how rude you are. I'm surprised."</p>

<p>"So am I, bedad. I didn't think th' old crony had that much
generosity in him."</p>

<p>"Indeed, the generosity is on the other foot, if there's any
generosity about it," Miss Monaugh retorted. "It is not the first
time Mr Lynton has asked me."</p>

<p>"Well, no," Biddy admitted, slowly. " 'Tis a dhry old shtick
he's gettin', all the same."</p>

<p>"Is he!" sullenly. "I'm no dryer than you are, if it comes to
that."</p>

<p>"Whin's it comin' off, Jo?" asked Biddy in a more pacifying
tone.</p>

<p>"Whenever I like," Jo answered, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Did he tell you that?" cried Biddy, with distended eyes.</p>

<p>"He did," said Jo, trying to appear calm while fumbling with her
gloves.</p>

<p>"An' ye're shtill Johanna Monaugh?"</p>

<p>"I'm still Johanna Monaugh, of course."</p>

<p>"Wal, afther that!" cried Biddy, her face eloquent of dissent.
"I'd like to see the bold cockshaver who'd say that to me if I stud
in your boots. I'd give him th' crook of me arm pretty shmart, an'
I'd say to him, ses I, 'Come on, me bhoy; there's no time like th'
prisent.' Men are kittle cattle, an' there's nothin' like takin'
'em on the hop."</p>

<p>"That would be bad form, Biddy," said Miss Monaugh, severely.
"Though I'm not a stickler for conventionalities, I believe in
observing the proprieties in cases of this sort. There are people
who would be glad of something to say about the indecent haste and
that sort of thing. Mother Grundy is a nasty old cat in matters of
this kind. If a person in my position were to go and marry at a
moment's notice, she would turn up her snub nose and talk scandal.
But she won't have the chance. Everything will be strictly formal
and proper, and I'll get there in good time, never fear."</p>

<p>"Ye'll niver do it younger, Johanna," Biddy said.</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh, highly indignant, bounced out of the room. She
found a more sympathetic listener in Myles, and with him expatiated
on the many estimable qualities of her fiance and the amiable Myles
expressed himself as being delighted to know that she had succeeded
in "hookin' summat arter all."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Biddy was much exercised as to what was to become of
Ethel. In her heart she was glad that Johanna was to be taken away
to Druton, for then Ethel would not be so much under her baneful
influence, and would therefore be more tractable and obedient to
her stepmother. She assisted Miss Monaugh all she could in her
preparations, and did not trouble herself much to conceal her
anxiety to be rid of her.</p>

<p>"Of course she doesn't like me," Miss Monaugh confided to Myles,
&quot;because I've upset so many of her plans. But she'll miss me
when I'm gone. If she knew the truth about Ethel she wouldn't be in
each a hurry to kick me out. It serves her right."</p>

<p>It was about sunset on Saturday when Mr Lethcote, who had gone
to the station the day before to meet his daughter, drove her home
in the dogcart. Miss Monaugh had returned some hours earlier, and
now assisted the young lady to alight.</p>

<p>''You look happy, child&mdash;so contented.&quot; she said,
roguishly but only Ethel knew the meaning of the wink and smile
that accompanied the words.</p>

<p>She had benefited immensely by her trip. She was a little
sunburned certainly, but there was a healthy sparkle n the dear
blue eyes that gave her whole face an animated appearance. She was
at times delightfully piquant and her brisk manner was a source of
pleasure to her father and Aunt Jo. But her repartees, her
fearlessness, occasionally disconcerted her stepmother. The latter
realised now that Ethel had grown into a woman, and was not to be
so easily cajoled as she had expected. It was all Johanna's fault,
of course. She had made her "old fashioned," self-willed and
rebellious.</p>

<p>But Biddy did not despair. She'll do my biddin' whin Jo's gone,"
she declared, "or be th' grace o' God I'll knock shpots off her.
I'll let her understand widout eny equivocatin' who's boss of this
establishment. Take it from me now."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="c22" id="c22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p>&quot;How old are you, Etty?" Biddy asked on the Monday
morning.</p>

<p>They were in the drawing-room. In a little sitting-room
adjoining were two gentlemen. They had been smuggled in there by
Miss Monaugh.</p>

<p>"Just keep quiet till you're wanted," she enjoined them. "You
know your role. Pop in at the right time. We'll have a little
drama&mdash;or perhaps I should say comedy to finish up with. It's
the best way to get out of the difficulty."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid ther'll be something of the tragic element in it,"
said the elder of the two gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Of course there will. Biddy will be in an awful rage. I
wouldn't be surprised if she has a fit. But it will soon pass over.
Just follow my instructions, and all will be well."</p>

<p>She returned to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I am nearly twenty;" Ethel answered. Then, after a pause, she
added, "Leonard says I do not look it."</p>

<p>"You mightn't look it," said her stepmother, "but, for all that,
you have the way wid you that tells pretty plain that ye warn't
born yesterday, it's time, Etty, ye begun to think o' settlin'
down. It bates me now what we're goin' to do for you. There was Mr
Fogarty&mdash;a very nice young man. He's just married Miss Cadby,
th' publican's daughter. He always admired you, did Fogarty, an' if
ye 'adn't gone away, I'm sure she wouldn't 'ave got a bit of him.
An' ye lost M'Gurren (the old bog-throtter) ye lost him through,
your own foolishness, so ye did."</p>

<p>"I didn't want Mr M'Gurren, mother. I'm glad he's out of the
way," Ethel returned. "There are better men than Mr M'Gurren on the
Yeerong&mdash;one, at least."</p>

<p>"Who is that, pray?"</p>

<p>"Mark Keaton."</p>

<p>"Phugh! He's not worth his salt. He might own Gimbo (thanks to
old M'Gurren), but what's he got to kape it goin'? He won't work,
an' phwat's the use of his writin'?"</p>

<p>Miss Monaugh tossed her head and passed into the hall.</p>

<p>"He's going to work at the station,&quot; Ethel replied.
&quot;His writing is bringing him in money already. In a few years
he'll be rich, or I'm greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>"I think you are. It ud take half a lifetime at least to make
onything at that game nowadays. Mr Lynton told me so, and he ought
to know. Who th' divil would marry a bookworm on that spec,
enyway?"</p>

<p>"That question is out of date, mother. He's married."</p>

<p>"Mark Keaton is?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Mrs Lethcote dropped her hands over her lap, still holding her
work&mdash;some white material she was sewing. Ethel was slightly
nervous.</p>

<p>"The Lord be thanked for that much!" said her stepmother,
fervently. Her gaze wandered through the open door. Across the
flat, along the Red Road, a few teams were passing. Twining wreaths
of vapour rose like snowclouds from the hills beyond. The sun shone
out, and insect life began to waken, and to relieve the monotonous
stillness of the July morning.</p>

<p>Ethel looked up timidly. "You are glad, mother?" she
questioned.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," her step-mother replied. "I didn't think he'd
do it. but 'tis as well he has. He's beyond harm-doin',
enyway."</p>

<p>"There was never any harm in Mark Keaton, I am sure," said
Ethel, picking up a book that lay on the table. "If he is poor, he
is honest."</p>

<p>"I always thought ye had a fancy for th' bosthoon," said Biddy.
"I hope ye've got over that&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Ethel, slowly. Her eyes were fixed on the
book. "I always loved him&mdash;I love him dearly."</p>

<p>She spoke very tenderly, her face half-hidden in the thick folds
of the curtains. Biddy was horrified.</p>

<p>"Love him!" she cried. "Are ye mad? How can ye say such a thing!
Ye don't know what ye're talkin' about, goose. Ye ought to be
ashamed of ye'self, so ye ought. To say ye love a married man! Did
I iver hear th' like of it!"</p>

<p>"Would you have me hate him?"</p>

<p>" 'Twould be betther so. I wouldn't have ye love him if he was
single, but&mdash;married! God forbid! Ye must be crazy, child.
Phwat would his wife think at all, at all?"</p>

<p>"She thinks it quite proper," Ethel answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>"To love her husband?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"The Lord be good to us! I donno phant sort of a woman she can
be."</p>

<p>Biddy went on sewing very rapidly for a few seconds. Suddenly
she put it down again. "Who did he get holt of, for God's sake?
Some wicked adventuress in Brisbane. I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Ethel, with reproach in her eyes and voice.
"He married in Nanango."</p>

<p>"Indade! An' who is his wife?"</p>

<p>"I am!"</p>

<p>"God be good to us! You-u!"</p>

<p>"Yes. mother, I am Mark's wife."</p>

<p>"God forgive you!" said Biddy, hoarsely. Her face was white, and
her eyes flashed with an angry glare. "An' ye feel mighty proud, no
doubt? Ye think ye'ye done a shmart thing to marry that jackanapes?
Th' dirty scamp!"</p>

<p>She sprang up and stamped her foot oh the floor. "By the powers,
if he ever comes into this house I'll throttle him! I'll knock him
down wid the saucepan! I'll scald the dog, I will!"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>"I'll sphlit his skull open wid the tay-pot&mdash;"</p>

<p>Biddy stopped short. Mark Keaton stood on the threshold, looking
calmly at her.</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, madam," he said, "were you alluding to our
marriage?"</p>

<p>"Indade I was, thin. Drat you for an impudent pup! I'll have ye
presecuted!"</p>

<p>"What wrong have I done?"</p>

<p>"Wrong!" screeched the infuriated woman. "Phwat right did ye
ever do ye dog! Didn't ye take my daughter away an' marry her
against my will! 'Tis abductin' ye've done. She' undher age. Dyer
know that?"</p>

<p>"I do. I obtained permission from the proper authority to marry
Ethel."</p>

<p>"The proper authority! An' who th' divil's the proper authority,
I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>The side door opened, and Aunt Jo entered.</p>

<p>"I am," she said, with an emphasis that greatly disturbed the
curl papers.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;u&mdash;u!"</p>

<p>"Yes, me."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Biddy, don't make a fuss over nothing. Just listen to me.
Before Ethel's mother died she made me the guardian of her child. I
have the deed here." She tapped a paper which she held in her hand.
"I would have told you this long ago, and let you know all about
Mark and Ethel's engagement if you had acted properly towards her.
But you tried your best to sacrifice the poor child for M'Gurren's
money. So we had to indulge in a little game of checkmate."</p>

<p>"Indade!" cried Biddy, wrathfully. I'll take good care I'll
checkmate you for th' future. As ye think so much of her fine
husband, ye can get him to kape yez. I won't, so there."</p>

<p>"You never have, Biddy. I've kep myself&mdash;although," she
added, as an afterthought, "I am indebted to you for the shelter of
your most, hospitable roof"</p>

<p>"Ye won't be any longer thin. I'll stake me sowl on that
much.&quot;</p>

<p>"I won't. I have a home of my own."</p>

<p>"Have you? 'Tis mighty racent ye've found it thin."</p>

<p>"I'm to be married on Wednesday Biddy, to Mr Lynton,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord save us! Do ye mane it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And I should like to be married here. Mr Lynton
wishes it."</p>

<p>Biddy sank into a chair, hardly knowing whether to laugh or to
cry. The clouds were passing over, and Mark, noting the favourable
signs stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Mrs Lethoote," he said, "we have not been on the best of terms
in the past, which was my reason for not asking your permission to
marry Ethel. I knew you would dismiss me at once. We have always
loved each other, Ethel and I, and, for fear of being parted, we
agreed to marry in secret. I have already made a name, and am in a
position to keep her as she should be kept. So I trust you will
forgive us our little delinquency, and be good friends."</p>

<p>He held out his hand. Mrs Lethcote accepted it in silence.</p>

<p>"There now," said Miss Monaugh smiling blandly; "you will be
proud of him yet, Biddy. Of course you could tear my hair out, and
all that, but you'll come to look at it as we do before long. These
sort of matches mostly turn out happily. I am quite satisfied this
one will. I've had an opportunity of judging."</p>

<p>She threw the door open, and, with many smiles and courtesies,
and a modest little blush, announced Mr Edwin Lynton.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs Lethcote," said that gentleman, pompously, "let me
congratulate you. I am very glad things have turned out so happily.
Are you not delighted now? Come?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Biddy, reluctantly, "it might 'ave been worse."</p>

<p>"Of course it might," Mr Lynton assented, patronisingly. "But,"
he added slyly, "it could scarcely have been better. Your
son-in-law, my dear madam, is the lion of the Yeerong."</p>

<p>Mrs Lethcote smiled, and drew her stepdaughter to her. "I hope
ye'll be happy, Etty," she said, and kissed the young wife on the
cheek.</p>

<p>"Happy!" said the excited and delighted Myles, who had been
beaming on the company through the window all the while, and
enjoying Biddy' confusion. "She's got nowt to trouble un now.
She'll be 's happy 's a sandboy, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"There is only one more act to make all complete," said Mr
Lynton, with sly glance at Miss Monaugh, who blushed modestly and
slapped him playfully on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ye're goin' to take Jo away from us?" Biddy broke in. "That's
it of course. Ye don't think she kept that bottled up, do you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I particularly requested her to tell you. I hope
you have no objection&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indade I haven't. Take her an welcome. Bad cess to her, phwat
hasn't she done since she's been here! But niver mind. A bad indin'
often has a good beginnin'. I forgive you, Jo, an'&mdash;the best
of luck be wid you."</p>
