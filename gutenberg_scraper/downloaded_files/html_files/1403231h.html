<h2>All This and Heaven Too<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Rachel Field</h2>

<hr>

<p class="cp">THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED<br>
TO<br>
ARTHUR PEDERSON<br></p>

<hr>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p class="cp">The title of this book is accredited to Matthew Henry
(1662-1714), who wrote of his father, the Reverend Philip Henry:
"He would say sometimes when he was in the midst of the comforts of
this life&mdash;'All this, and Heaven too!'"</p>

<hr>

<h2>A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>DEAR GREAT-AUNT HENRIETTA,</p>

<p>Although I never knew you in life, as a child I often cracked
butternuts on your tombstone. There were other more impressive
monuments in our family lot, but yours for some unaccountable
reason became my favourite in that group erected to the glory of
God and the memory of departed relatives.</p>

<p>Knowing what I know of you now, I should like to think that some
essence of your wit and valour and spice still lingered there and
had power to compel a child's devotion. I should like to believe
that the magnetic force which moved you to plead your own cause in
the murder trial that was the sensation of two continents and
helped a French king from his throne was in some way responsible
for the four-leafed clover I left there on a summer day in the
early nineteen hundreds. But I am not sentimentalist enough for
such folly. You had been dead for more than thirty years by the
time I came along with my butternuts and four-leafed clovers; when
I traced with curious forefinger the outlines of a lily, unlike any
growing in New England gardens, cut into the polished surface of
your stone.</p>

<p>My forefinger has grown none the less curious in the thirty more
years that I have been tracing your legend from that inscription,
bare as a detached twig, stripped of leaf or bloom:</p>

<blockquote>HENRIETTE DESPORTES<br>
The Beloved Wife of Henry M. Field<br>
Died March 6, 1875</blockquote>

<p>There it is, almost defiant in its brevity, without date or
place of birth; with no reference to Paris; nothing to suggest the
transplanting of a life uprooted from obscurity by an avalanche of
passion and violence and class hatred.</p>

<p>Half a century ago no memorial was complete without some pious
comment or a Biblical text chosen to fit the life and works of the
departed. Why should yours be the only one in that group of marble
and slate that asks nothing of God or man? Why is there no hint of
the destiny which was reserved for you alone out of a world of
other human beings? Only you know the answer, and only you could
have written the epitaph that was omitted from your stone.</p>

<p>The omission must have been deliberate. I know that as surely as
if you had told me so yourself.</p>

<p>"My dear great-niece," I think you would answer me with the
wise, faintly amused expression which is yours in the only likeness
I have ever seen of you, "some day you will learn as I did to make
a virtue of necessity." Then, with that slight Parisian shrug you
were able to subdue but never entirely shed, you might add: "Who
knows most speaks least."</p>

<p>Still, legends are not easily shed. Silence and obscurity may
not be had for the asking. You had your way at the last, and your
stone is bare and impersonal; but you could not erase your name
from those records of crime, or do away with the files of French
and English newspapers for the year 1847. It is your fate to be
remembered against your will. You must have waked sometimes in the
big Empire bed of polished mahogany that stands now in my room,
turning from memories of words spoken and looks exchanged in the
Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;; from the din of newsboys
calling out your name on crowded boulevards; from the grey walls of
the Conciergerie where you walked under guard with curious eyes
pressed to the grating. I, too, have lain wakeful in that same bed
half a century later, trying to piece together from scattered
fragments of fact and hearsay all that you spent so many years of
your life trying to forget.</p>

<p>I have grown up with your possessions about me. I know the
marble-topped mahogany bureau that matches your bed; the pastel
portrait you made of the little girl who became your adopted child;
I know the rosewood painting table that held the brushes and paints
and crayons it was your delight to use; I know your silver forks
and spoons with the delicately flowing letter D on their handles.
On my hand as I write is a ring that was yours, and I never take
out a certain enamel pin from its worn, carnelian-studded box
without wondering if it may not have been some bit of jewellery
tendered as peace-offering by the Duchesse after one of her stormy
outbursts. Strange that these intimate keepsakes should survive
when I have never seen so much as a word in your handwriting.</p>

<p>Your portrait, painted by Eastman Johnson, has made you visible
to me as you looked in the years when you were no longer the
notorious Mademoiselle Deluzy-Desportes riding rough seas alone,
but a married woman of assured position, presiding over the house
near Gramercy Park where men of letters, artists, philanthropists
and distinguished visiting foreigners gathered and expanded under
the stimulating spell of your presence. I know your calm dignity of
expression even as I know your bodice of coffee-coloured silk and
that single tea rose tucked in the fall of black lace. Yours was a
strongly marked face, square of chin and broad of brow. The thick
chestnut hair was smoothly parted after the fashion made familiar
by your contemporaries Elizabeth Barrett Browning and George Eliot.
Your eyes, not particularly large or beautiful in themselves, were
keen, full-lidded, and intent above well-defined cheekbones and a
rather flat nose with a wide, spirited flare to the nostrils. But,
of all your features, the mouth was the most dominant, speaking for
you from the canvas in eloquent silence. Too large and firm a mouth
for the accepted rosebud model of your day, it must have been a
trial to you in your youth. Humorous, sensitive and
inscrutable&mdash;one could tell anything to the possessor of such
a mouth and never know what response might be forthcoming except
that it would most certainly be wise and shrewd and worth
hearing.</p>

<p>Fragments of your wit and sagacity have survived, like chips of
flint left where arrowheads were once sharpened. But the arrowheads
themselves, those verbal darts for which you were famous, having
found their mark, did not remain for our time. A phrase here,
tinged with foreign picturesqueness; a quick comment still vivid
with personal pungency; a half-forgotten jest; some humorous
anecdote, they made a meagre and strangely assorted sheaf for your
great-niece to cull.</p>

<p>And I am only your great-niece by marriage. You left no legacy
of flesh and blood behind you. Fate played many tricks upon you,
yet this was the one you most bitterly resented. You were barren,
who should have been the most fruitful of women. To you children
were more than amusing puppets to be dressed and coddled and
admonished after the manner of the Victorian era to which you
belonged. They were a passion, as absorbing as if each had been an
unknown continent to be explored and charted. Even your most
disapproving censors admitted this power, and your sway over the
young Praslins was certainly one of the strongest links in the
chain of evidence brought against you. Youth was a necessity to
your nature, and so you took a child from your husband's family
into your home to be a substitute for your own.</p>

<p><i>"Eh bien</i>," I can almost hear you saying, "one has not the
choice in this world. But to live without a child in the
house&mdash;that would be tragedy. Is it not so, my leetle
Henri?"</p>

<p>Your leetle Henri, who was my great-uncle, agreed, as he agreed
in most of your projects, marvelling not a little at the Gallic
sprightliness and wisdom of that extraordinary lady who had done
him the honour to become his wife. A bird of rare plumage had taken
possession of his home; a strange blend of nightingale and parakeet
was gracing the nest he had vaguely expected to be shared by some
meek, dun-feathered wren. He never quite knew how it had happened,
but he knew his good fortune in having won you. He was proud of
your elegance and wit; of your charm and intelligence, and, yes, of
your slightly arrogant ways.</p>

<p>Great-Uncle Henry was small in stature and was your junior by
ten years; but there was fire in him, and you knew how to kindle
what lay beneath that New England exterior so different from your
own. He may have lacked the shrewdness of your judgment, the
whiplash of your wit; but his enthusiasm, his warmth and idealism
fused with the sterner stuff of which you were made.</p>

<p>I can just remember Great-Uncle Henry as a small elderly man
with a vague smile, whose mind had a disconcerting way of wandering
off without warning into labyrinths of the past where a
matter-of-fact seven- or eight-year-old might not follow. But that
memory has nothing to do with an eager young man who, for all his
Puritanical upbringing and ecclesiastical turn of mind, was born
with feet that itched to walk in far places, and an imagination
that kindled romantically to the plight of a French governess
suddenly faced with the charge of instigating a murder that shook
the empire. He was twenty-five years old when he first heard your
name echoing through Paris that summer of 1847. There he stood,
fresh from a boyhood in the Berkshire Hills where his father had
followed Jonathan Edwards with more hellfire and brimstone sermons
in the meeting-house that faced the village green. A Williams
College valedictory delivered at sixteen, and those first years of
preaching sermons of his own from pulpits that only accentuated his
boyishness, were behind him. There he stood, earnest and young and
unaware that you and he were to spend twenty years together across
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>It may be that, like Victor Hugo who described your enforced
exercise under guard in the Conciergerie courtyard, Great-Uncle
Henry had his first glimpse of you through iron bars. We shall
never know. I set down here only what may have happened. Perhaps I
have put words into your mouth that you would never have said. My
thoughts, at best, can never be your thoughts. I know that, and
still I must write them, since you yourself emerge from the web of
fact and legend as definite as the spider that clears the intricate
maze of its own making, I shall not claim to be unprejudiced,
though I shall try to tell the truth as I know it. For the more
complex the subject, the more each separate version must vary with
the teller. So, each hand that touches the piano strikes a
different chord.</p>

<p>Dear Great-Aunt Henrietta, you will never know what I think of
you, but here it is&mdash;the letter I have always wanted to write;
the story I have always wanted to tell.</p>

<h2>PART I.<br>
<i>"Mademoiselle D."</i><br>
<i>1841-1848</i></h2>

<h3>Chapter One</h3>

<p>Among the ill-assorted group of passengers waiting to leave the
small steamer that had brought them across the Channel from
Southampton to Le Havre, a woman stood erect and alone with her
luggage piled about her. It was unusual in the year 1841 for a
woman of her age and appearance to be travelling unaccompanied. Not
that she showed striking beauty, but a certain spirited grace of
carriage distinguished her from her fellow-travellers.</p>

<p>Late March was not the most propitious time for crossing, and
the English Channel had lived up to its reputation for choppiness.
The night had been rough and rainy, and a general air of limp
resignation prevailed in the little group so soon to be scattered.
Curls and once crisp feathers drooped damply against wan faces;
eyes were circled in unbecoming dark hollows; huddled forms in
shawls and steamer rugs slumped miserably on benches as the edged
wind of early morning blowing across salt water strove with the
thickness of the ship's saloon. The stale scents of food and
tobacco and human occupation mingled with that unmistakable smell
peculiar to all such vessels, a combination of tar and rope and
brass polish, of varnish and smoky oil lamps&mdash;hardly an
atmosphere to enhance a woman's charm. But this solitary female
bore up well under the ordeal. She was young&mdash;at least she
could not be called old&mdash;and she appeared considerably less
than her twenty-eight years; she was vigorous and full of a lively
interest in the world and her temporary companions, and she had
learned long before this how to conduct herself alone.</p>

<p>A shaft of salty air came in with the opening and closing of
doors as men went out into the rapidly thinning dimness on deck. In
response to the freshness her head lifted and her nostrils dilated
as she breathed deeply. Involuntarily she made a half-move to leave
the overcrowded saloon; but the impulse was checked almost at once.
Much as she would have welcomed fresh air, it would not do to go
out and join the men who tramped the damp decks in masculine
freedom, untrammelled by billowing skirts of cashmere or taffeta,
by yards of petticoat and bonnet strings that were prey to every
current of air. Besides, there were all her possessions in the
neatly roped bandboxes and bags and the new leather portmanteaus
with the brass-headed nails driven into the lid to form the letters
"H.D." There was no one to whom she might entrust them.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," she thought, and her shoulders shrugged ever so
slightly under the Paisley shawl, folded to display the richly
patterned border to best advantage, "it would hardly be <i>comme il
faut</i> at this hour of the morning, and with so few women
about."</p>

<p>It was pleasant to hear the sound of her native tongue again
from one or another of the passengers. Though she had spoken
English fluently from childhood, and though she had even come to
think as easily in one tongue as in the other during the years
which she had spent in London, yet she quickened to the familiar
accents. Already she felt younger and lighter of heart for the
sound. She had been away too long. Yesterday, to be sure, she had
shed courteous tears at parting from the Hislop
family&mdash;especially from the grave and gentle girl who had been
her sole charge, and who turned to her with such reverent, adoring
eyes. Those candid blue eyes had been red-rimmed almost from the
moment the matter of a change had been mentioned. It had been
affecting to see the child's genuine emotion.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>ch&eacute;rie,</i> you have shed too many foolish
tears. The time has come when you no longer need a governess. You
are a young lady, almost sixteen, and ready to attend finishing
school. Why, you will be marrying in a year or two more."</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle, you have always been so much more than a
governess. Papa himself says so, and you know he is not easy to
please."</p>

<p>That was true enough. Sir Thomas Hislop expected much of those
who served him, especially of the one into whose charge he had
given the training of his only child. She had never given him cause
to regret the confidence he had placed in her, and as time went on
he had added unusual household privileges to those customarily
accepted as fitted to the station of nursery governess. As his
daughter had said, mademoiselle had grown to be far more than
governess in that home, and never once had she overstepped. His
letter of recommendation, on paper bearing the family crest, was
for an Englishman lavish of praise, informing the world in general
and the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin in particular that Mademoiselle
Henriette Desportes had served him for the better part of eight
years as governess and companion to his daughter Nina, and that, in
all things pertaining to deportment, personal integrity, and tact,
she had proved herself a model and an ornament to her sex. Her
gifts, also, he had added as an afterthought, were considerable,
for besides being qualified to teach the rudiments of learning she
spoke French and English fluently, was familiar with literature and
the classics, and had a charming talent for flower painting and
crayon portraiture.</p>

<p>There had been farewell gifts in token of the Hislop family's
esteem&mdash;the handsome shawl which had cost more than twice what
she might have contrived to save out of her wages; the umbrella
with the ivory handle now crooked over her arm; the beaded bag
worked by her young charge's own devoted fingers. All these were
tangible signs of her personal conquest. She smiled with
satisfaction, and then sighed, remembering that these conquests
were now behind her; remembering, too, certain disturbing rumours
that had reached her ears concerning the household which she would
so soon be entering.</p>

<p>"<i>On arrive</i>," a Frenchman was telling his plump wife,
while the sound of chains and churning water and the sudden bustle
of landing filled her ears.</p>

<p>It required all her attention to marshal her belongings, seize a
blue-smocked porter, and get herself safely ashore. No husband or
father or brother guided her down the steep and slippery gang-plank
and superintended the luggage and formalities of customs and
passport inspection. She awaited her turn alone, shivering in the
pier's half-open shed.</p>

<p>Her passport was duly read and stamped, and the French
authorities thereby informed that Henriette Desportes, aged
twenty-eight years, single woman, native of Paris, parents
deceased, nearest of kin, her grandfather, the Baron F&eacute;lix
Desportes, former officer of Napoleon Bonaparte, now residing at
Paris, was returning to continue her occupation of governess. Port
of embarkation, Southampton, England, March 28, 1841.</p>

<p><i>"Bien</i>." Mademoiselle Henriette Desportes tipped the
porter as frugally as one dared and settled herself for the train
journey to Paris. Just for a moment she had let her mind linger
over the prospect of a first-class ticket. But the habit of economy
had asserted itself, and she had resisted temptation. The
compartment benches were hard and narrow, but she had been
fortunate in securing a place by one of the windows. She felt
comforted by this and a cup of chocolate and a roll she had hastily
secured in the nearest caf&eacute;. From a small package in her
bag&mdash;labelled in a girlish hand, "Mademoiselle, with the
affectionate regard of her devoted pupil Nina H."&mdash;she
selected a glac&eacute; fruit and nibbled it appreciatively as the
last whistle sounded and the train steamed slowly out into the
early morning countryside.</p>

<p>Even the dirty pane of glass could not altogether dim the effect
of sunlight on a world that was dear and familiar to her. She had
been so long among smoking chimney pots and houses of brick and
chill grey stone that she had almost forgotten walls could show
cream-coloured or even softly rose where the sun touched their
plaster and whitewash. The delicate turrets of a far ch&acirc;teau
pricked out of massed woods. Beside a shallow stream a stooped
peasant in sabots and faded blue paused in his turf-gathering to
watch the passing train. A woman drove a flock of white geese
across a bridge under willows that were already dripping green.
Smoke rose blue and wavering from a cluster of thatched roofs.
Indeed, everything seemed to swim in a faint blue haze. Always
responsive to the picturesque in nature and humanity, Henriette
Desportes missed nothing of the passing scene. It filled her with
pleased detachment, and she relaxed under the dreamlike unreality
beyond the window.</p>

<p>Oh, well, it might look like a patterned world, laid out in prim
design, but to those living there it could never be so simple. They
were as alive as she: that old peasant contriving to outwit the
cold; that woman anxiously counting her comical flock lest one
goose escape her vigilance; all those who slept, or toiled, or
loved under the low-hung roofs or the sharp turrets. Those people
out there, if they caught sight of her own face pressed close to
the window pane, might be speculating about her. To them she was
part of the pattern of the lumbering train with its trail of smoke
and little boxlike carriages. Perhaps they envied leer, riding at
ease to distant Paris. How little they knew of that! How little she
herself knew what awaited her at the end of the journey!</p>

<p>Yesterday marked the end of an era. A cycle of her life lay
behind in the dark, well-ordered rooms of the Hislop house. She
could never recapture that part of herself again. Eight years
gone&mdash;and what had she to show for them? A letter testifying
to her good character; a few English pounds that represented years
of patient scrimping; the whole-hearted devotion of a girl who
would presently be too submerged in the cares of marriage to need
her; a modest wardrobe that fitted easily into the luggage on the
rack above and under the seat; some cheap books and trinkets, and
certain experiences in self-denial and discipline that had
strengthened her character at the expense of her youthful freshness
and spontaneity. Twenty-eight was not an advanced age, but it was
certainly not youth.</p>

<p>"What chance have I ever had for youth?" she asked herself in a
surge of unuttered bitterness. "First the convent without even a
summer's holiday free from bells and masses and instruction in
books and conduct, and then more lessons&mdash;only I am no longer
pupil but teacher; and now it will be no different except that I
shall be in Paris, where the heart and step should be lightest if
one has the means to keep them so!"</p>

<p>Perhaps she had been foolish to come. But the offer had been
exceptional. The Hislops had been kind, had urged her to continue
in their home till the right opening presented itself; but she knew
the signs of change. She could read the writing on the wall and see
how soon her young charge would be full-grown. And then this chance
to be governess to the children of one of the oldest families of
French nobility at two thousand francs and her board and apartment
had dropped into her very lap. She could hardly have refused even
if she had wished to remain in England, which was far from the
case. She knew she had made a most favourable impression upon her
interviewer, a friend of the Duchesse who had been commissioned to
find the proper guardian for the Praslin progeny. Yes, her
credentials were impeccable, and her qualifications obvious. Could
she arrange to assume her duties immediately?</p>

<p>In this haste and obvious eagerness, Henriette had sensed
something not quite usual, not quite as it should be. She had
parried with modest adroitness, and suddenly the positions had been
reversed: the questioner became the questioned. The interview was
in her hands. Reluctantly she had ferreted out the truth.
Governesses seldom stayed long in the Ch&acirc;teau Praslin. There
had been quite a procession in the last two years. That was indeed
strange, she had suggested, with just the proper shade of pointed
na&iuml;vet&eacute; in her manner, since the position was obviously
such a desirable one and the salary so generous. Were the young
Praslins perhaps difficult and undisciplined? No, she was assured,
they were charming and intelligent children. It was
only&mdash;Well, perhaps a word to the wise would be sufficient.
Mademoiselle Desportes was not without experience in domestic
affairs, and in this case the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin, though
both were from the best families of France and Corsica and their
marriage certainly was more than fruitful since it had produced no
fewer than nine children in eleven years&mdash;Still it must be
admitted that there were times when they seemed to be not in
complete accord. Of course she must understand this was only a
matter of temperament&mdash;there was nothing to suggest discord;
but the Duchesse, besides having a Corsican inheritance of hot
temper, was far from well. She was not always herself, and the Duc
was not the sort of man to make compromises with another's
moods.</p>

<p>The children were too often witnesses to family disagreements.
In fact it was frequently round them that the controversies raged.
The Duc had a very deep attachment for his children and very
decided ideas about their instruction. The Duchesse, poor woman,
resented her husband's interference in such domestic
matters&mdash;and who could blame her? It required extraordinary
tact and understanding on the part of a governess. That was why
Mademoiselle Desportes had seemed so particularly fitted for the
position, though naturally there were dozens of others as well
recommended as she to fill it. Well, there could be no harm in
giving the matter a trial. Henriette had evidenced not too great
eagerness in her acceptance. She would need a fortnight to prepare
herself; that would be little enough time, but she wished to be as
considerate as possible. She had promised to report for her new
duties upon the first of April.</p>

<p>"And that is day after to-morrow," she reminded herself. "God
knows if I shall last long in this m&eacute;nage!"</p>

<p>Yet she did not dread the thought of entering it. The
difficulties it presented would at least be stimulating. One would
not perish of boredom in a place where charges of gunpowder might
lurk in unexpected corners to explode without warning. She felt
oddly exhilarated&mdash;almost, she thought, as if she were about
to step upon a lighted stage filled with unknown players, to act a
r&ocirc;le she had had no chance to rehearse beforehand. She must
find the cues for herself and rely on her own resourcefulness to
speak the right lines. Henriette Desporte's heart under the plain
grey alpaca basque that was her badge of discreet servitude beat
quickly, but with steady self-confidence. She knew she was no fool,
though she must not betray such an unladylike knowledge.</p>

<p>Rouen with its cathedral towers and market-place was fair and
sleepy under the noon sun. The train stopped there for a
quarter-hour, and she made bold to get out and stretch her cramped
body. She was the only woman to do so, but her own preoccupation
wrapped her in unapproachable dignity. She remembered Rouen from
her childhood years because she had gone there with two of the
Sisters making a pilgrimage to the Cathedral. The dim, austere
beauty of the great Gothic arches and aisles had laid a deep hold
upon her young imagination, and the Sisters' pious recital of
Jeanne d'Arc's martyrdom had stirred her then, as now. She had
veered from the religion those zealous Sisters had instilled into
her youth. She was a Protestant now, but the early association and
mystic ardour sometimes returned as it did to-day. Only now it was
Jeanne the woman, sore beset and alone, not the saint, who
quickened her sympathies.</p>

<p>"You, too," she thought as she returned to the railway carriage,
"you, too, were a single woman, defying the pattern of your world.
We should have understood each other, you and I."</p>

<p>She settled herself for the second part of the journey and
unfolded the English newspaper she had not read the day before. It
was a copy of the London <i>Times,</i> and already the items she
pored over seemed part of another world in which only yesterday she
had been an infinitesimal human part.</p>

<p>Lord Palmerston's foreign policy was receiving much comment at
home and abroad. It seemed to have excited considerable ill will in
France, where Guizot held the reins of foreign affairs. According
to latest reports it appeared that, in spite of Great Britain and
Austria taking part with Turkey against Mehemet Ali, he would be
recognised as hereditary ruler of Egypt. The Queen and the Prince
Consort had formally opened a new hospital for foundlings at
Whitechapel. The Queen's speech was reported in full, and there had
been much enthusiasm in token of the recent anniversary of the
royal pair's first year of conjugal bliss. Her Majesty not only
appeared in excellent spirits but seemed to have improved in health
since the birth of the little Princess. The Royal Family had
graciously sat for daguerreotype likenesses at the newly opened
parlours in Pall Mall. This remarkable process for reproducing the
human features was proving a sensation in Paris and London and even
in America. Monsieur Daguerre deserved all praise for his
invention, which was indeed an artistic achievement worthy of
support though as yet too great a luxury to be indulged in by the
masses. Rachel, the greatest trag&eacute;dienne of her day, would
shortly cross the Channel to introduce her art and repertoire to
London.</p>

<p>Henriette read every word of that last bit of news. To her mind,
Rachel was worth all the Royal Families of England and Europe
rolled into one. She meant to see that pale face and those flashing
Semitic eyes; to hear the vibrant tones of the voice that had
shaken all Paris, even the strait-laced bourgeoisie who disapproved
of her private life while they wept and marvelled at the spell she
cast to the most distant balcony seat. "Where I," Henriette told
herself as she folded the paper, "shall most certainly be sitting
if I am fortunate enough to squeeze myself into the theatre at
all!"</p>

<h3>Chapter Two</h3>

<p>Madame Le Maire's establishment, one of a row of dingy houses in
the unfashionable quarter of Marais, rue du Harlay, was one not
easily defined. Half pension, half school, its narrow
high-ceilinged bed-chambers and musty salons had for many years
sheltered a procession of students from various shores and other
such temporary sojourners to Paris as the extremely elastic
proportions of the m&eacute;nage could accommodate. Madame Le Maire
might be said to specialise in female flotsam and jetsam, though
she made it a point to be sure of the morals as well as the
financial status of her paying guests. Her terms were a week's rent
paid in advance and two letters of reference, carefully scanned and
verified before the prospective occupant was allowed to take
possession. Her reverence for respectability was well known and far
outruled the dictates of her heart and sympathies. If tears and
entreaties fell upon her gold-ringed ears they left less impression
than the drip of rain on the ancient grey slate of her own roof.
But Madame Le Maire was not so much hard as inflexible. She did no
favours herself and expected none in return. Her guests received
care and simple meals so long as they continued to behave
themselves and pay the bills she personally made out every Friday
evening in her fine hand that suggested the tracings of a
mathematically inclined spider.</p>

<p>"I ask nothing else of <i>le bon Dieu</i> and my guests," she
frequently explained to all listeners, "than that my account should
balance to the last <i>sou</i> and the police never darken my door.
So far my efforts have been blessed with success."</p>

<p>Henriette Desportes and Madame Le Maire were well acquainted.
Henriette had spent six months in the old house the year she had
left the convent to continue her studies in art. Since that time
she had returned for brief visits. Only the year before, she had
spent a month there while the Hislop family were travelling in
Switzerland. Madame Le Maire greeted her upon her arrival in a
barouche from the boat train with marked approval, if not with the
effusive welcome of Pierre the porter.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle has returned with the spring," the old fellow told
her as he shouldered her possessions and led the way through the
familiar entrance. "Day before yesterday I heard a songbird in the
Bois, and when I returned from my errand Madame is already
preparing the Needle's Eye because Mademoiselle Henriette is
arriving to occupy it."</p>

<p>"So it is to be the Needle's Eye again." Henriette smiled at
mention of the narrow slit of a room under the roof which she knew
so intimately. Because of its size and inconvenience and the four
steep flights that must be climbed to it Madame Le Maire seldom
managed to keep it permanently filled, but whenever occasion
warranted, she pressed it into service.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Henriette exchanged a knowing look with
Pierre&mdash;"I can put up with a closet this time since I shall be
leaving again day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is leaving, and just as she has arrived&mdash;"
Pierre's old tongue clicked in affectionate concern.</p>

<p>"Not Paris, Pierre, only the Needle's Eye. I have come back to
stay&mdash;at least&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off at sight of Madame Le Maire's erect and tightly
boned form at the head of the stairs. The two women did not
embrace. They never had indulged in such unbusinesslike
pleasantries. They met, as they had always done, on a plane of
mutual respect and shrewd admiration each for the other's
abilities. Henriette had always known that the older woman favoured
her above the other feminine boarders. She had never exactly said
it in so many words, but the girl knew that this keen-eyed, dumpy
Parisienne liked her spirit and good taste in dress and manners.
Some of the young ladies had grown deplorably careless in such
matters. But Madame Le Maire had always let Henriette know that she
knew good breeding when she met it.</p>

<p>"We may have our backs to the wall," she might almost have been
saying as the two stood looking each other over after the absence
of many months, "but we shall always stand straight, you and I.
Yes, our spines will not melt at the first signal of storm."</p>

<p>"Well, Mademoiselle Desportes," was what she really said as they
met, "you might have done me the honour of giving me more time to
prepare for your arrival. Only by the greatest chance and by
considerable shifting about could I find a place for you."</p>

<p>"It was good of you, Madame, to overlook the short notice."
Henriette was aware of the older woman's self-importance and knew
the value of admitting favours and being grateful for them. "The
change was very sudden, and I wrote you at once. I hope it is not
too inconvenient at this time?"</p>

<p>"No, no," Madame Le Maire was mollified. "I am always glad to
oblige if I am able. The only room now vacant is rather small and
at the top of the house. You may perhaps remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;very well," Henriette resisted the temptation to
smile and call it by name.</p>

<p>Better to accept the poor accommodation without protest. Madame
Le Maire's good will was above rubies. She could afford to puff a
little and be cramped for two nights for the sake of keeping it.
There were precious few places in Paris where a lone woman might
find respectable food and shelter within means of a slim
pocket-book. Her tact was rewarded by the offer of a glass of wine
and a wafer in Madame's own salon. She accepted the invitation and,
as her weariness responded to the delicate glow which stole over
her at each sip of the canary, she and Madame grew less formal.</p>

<p>"So you have left London behind you, mademoiselle? And are you
glad to return to Paris&mdash;permanently, it seems, this
time?"</p>

<p>"Very glad indeed, Madame; but as to permanence&mdash;who can
say? I least of all concerned."</p>

<p>"To be sure, nothing is permanent in this world&mdash;nothing
except dying; and that is certainly more my affair than yours if
years mean anything."</p>

<p>"Years should mean very little to one who wears hers so
becomingly." Henriette knew Madame's dread of growing old. She had
always felt inclined to humour, rather than to laugh at, her
attempt to hide the trace of years. The front hair, so darkly
luxuriant and curled in contrast to the scanty greying strands at
the old woman's neck, the pince-nez that so inadequately did duty
for spectacles, the touches of rouge on her faded cushions of
cheeks&mdash;all these seemed pathetic, but commendable efforts.
Madame Le Maire, she thought, was no more brave than the rest when
it came to facing what she really feared. This was her way of
showing defiance, as Henriette had seen children strut and whistle
through the dark stretches of some long corridor leading to
bed.</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;she returned to her earlier remark after she had
taken another sip of wine and felt the pleasant warmth slowly
lifting the weariness from her body&mdash;"when I said 'permanence'
I meant only that one can never count upon certainty in a new
position, and this appointment presents certain new problems."</p>

<p>"Nine altogether new problems if what I hear of the Praslin
family is correct. It is the household of the Duc and Duchesse de
Praslin which you wrote you were about to enter, is it not?"</p>

<p>"It is, but all the children will not be under my supervision.
The older boys have a tutor and three of the daughters are at a
convent. I shall have charge of three girls and the youngest boy
only."</p>

<p>"I should call that more than enough. Well, you have good
courage and tact. You will need more than your share of that."</p>

<p>Her tone was casual, but opaque dark eyes fixed her visitor with
the wise inscrutability of an old parrot. Henriette did not waver
under the look.</p>

<p>"I hope I may please my pupils and their parents." She set down
her glass, brushed a crumb of wafer from her skirt, and rose. "I
shall do my best."</p>

<p>"Naturally." Madame Le Maire made no offer to refill the
glasses. "To please is your bread and butter; and if you are clever
enough to add a bonbon now and then to sweeten your diet, all the
better. But do not acquire the taste for bonbons. A sweet tooth can
be dangerous at your age."</p>

<p>"Madame Le Maire, if you mean that I shall grow too fond of
luxury&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean more than that. The household you are entering is
certainly luxurious, but it is also&mdash;well&mdash;let us say
difficult. You are young to meet the requirements of such a
position, but perhaps you know better than I what is expected of
you. A grey head is sometimes placed on green shoulders. But if I
may offer one bit of advice&mdash;look as much like a governess as
possible when you go to your interview to-morrow."</p>

<p>The sharp old eyes took careful survey of the younger woman,
lingering significantly over the richness of the shawl, the grey
bonnet with cherry ruching and ribbons that brought out the clear
colour of the wearer's cheeks and lips, the sheen of loosely
curling chestnut hair.</p>

<p>"There are times when it is advisable to hide one's light under
a bushel. And now you no doubt wish to refresh yourself after your
journey. You will find hot water in your apartment, and we dine as
usual at half-past seven."</p>

<p>Henriette began the long climb, half amused, half annoyed by
Madame Le Maire's abrupt dismissal. It was not unpleasant to be
warned against her youth, which had of late seemed slipping from
her, but she would have liked to get to the bottom of those
insinuations. Probably the old woman was merely letting her tongue
run away with her; still, she had seldom been so talkative. And the
airs she gave herself&mdash;calling that hole under the roof an
apartment! As for "dining at half-past seven"&mdash;Henriette knew
exactly what the meal would be like, from cabbage soup, whose
familiar fragrance followed her up the stairs, to the pyramid of
withered tangerines and nuts that would accompany the
demitasse.</p>

<p>The Needle's Eye had not changed by one crack less or one piece
of furniture more. All was exactly as she remembered. The couch
which was converted into a bed only by virtue of necessity and good
will on the part of the sleeper, the corner washstand where she had
splashed so often with lowered head because the sloping eaves made
it impossible to stand otherwise, the row of wooden pegs awaiting
their burden of dresses, the shelf which did duty for
dressing-table, and the mirror above it, perpetually dimmed so that
the reflected face appeared blurred with inexhaustible tears. But
beyond the high peaked window all of Paris waited&mdash;ancient and
ageless in the late March twilight, fair as some hazy though well
remembered dream.</p>

<p>Henriette's fingers shook as she unfastened her bonnet strings.
Her breath came quickly, as much from emotion as from her hasty
climb. She opened the casement and leaned out to the cool air that
lifted the hair from her forehead, that seemed almost like a hand
laid to her cheek. All about her, other roofs rose, red-tiled or
grey, with their smoking chimneys less blackened and less ominous
than London chimneypots. Lights were beginning to appear in
windows, and an irregular patch of river between buildings shone
softly luminous like a bit of polished pewter. The Seine&mdash;she
felt its presence in the freshened air; in the faint reflection of
sky it still held; in the occasional sound of passing boats. Almost
she felt that she could distinguish the murmur of its watery flow
from that other flow of sound which was the city itself, man-made
and more insistent.</p>

<p>"Paris&mdash;Paris&mdash;Paris," her pulse beat over and over
while she leaned there motionless at the casement and twilight
dwindled into darkness. It was as if she held the city in her arms
and it in turn held her fate hidden&mdash;in which corner she could
not know.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me be happy here! Let me know that I am alive. Do not
let me be old before I have ever been young!"</p>

<p>So, in the dusk of the twenty-ninth day of March in the year of
our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, Henriette
Desportes prayed to the city whose streets were to ring to her name
six years later. At half-past nine she climbed more stairs&mdash;a
not too clean or well lighted flight that led to the second floor
of an old stone house just off the Boulevard Montmartre. A
slatternly woman answered her ring at the porter's bell and
grudgingly admitted that Monsieur F&eacute;lix Desportes was in his
apartment. Henriette did not care for the appraising glances of the
old creature and explained her presence in crisp accents.</p>

<p>"Please announce me to the Baron Desportes. Tell him that his
grand-daughter is here. He is expecting me."</p>

<p>But the woman only grinned and shrugged.</p>

<p>"Grand-daughter or not," she threw over a lifted shoulder as she
disappeared into the shadows from which she had come, "it's all the
same to me. I ask no questions, and I'm not paid to announce
guests. Be sure you shut the door when you leave,
mademoiselle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Desportes," Henriette repeated with annoyance,
"and please be so good as to remember it."</p>

<p>But there was no further response and nothing for her to do but
climb the stairs alone, picking her way with care in the flickering
light from a single gas jet at the landing. She shook her skirts
free of dust and paused to steady herself before she knocked. It
was not a visit she anticipated with pleasure, but she was
determined to carry off her part of it to the best of her
abilities. Perhaps this time her only relative might display some
sign of affection or interest. The reunion did not, however, begin
with promise.</p>

<p>"Oh, so it's you." There was no welcome in the voice or in the
face that greeted her. "Well, come in since you're here. I hardly
expected you so soon."</p>

<p>"But, Grandfather, I wrote you that I should come at once. You
had my letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I had it. It's somewhere about." The tall old man in a
worn dressing-gown and slippers shuffled back to his chair by the
grate fire, waving a long, veined hand towards a heap of
newspapers, letters, pens, and sticky glasses that crowded a nearby
table to overflowing. "I knew you would turn up whether or no."</p>

<p>Henriette felt a sudden chill at his words. The old resentment
of childhood flooded her at his unresponsiveness. It had always
been so. Ever since she could remember he had made her spirit
shrink inwardly like a leaf the frost can shrivel in a single
night. Upon their rare meetings in her youth he had always made it
clear that he found her a nuisance. She had been a plain child, but
clever and sensitive. She had hoped that her excellence in studies
at the convent might please him, might disarm him into a word of
praise or pride. But he had never uttered one. Before each visit of
her childhood she had gone to him with hope. Always she had come
away with baffled discouragement and a vague sense of actual
physical repugnance which both shared. She had hoped that perhaps
when she grew older it would be different. But now she knew that a
barrier of restraint and even of human dislike must always lie
between them.</p>

<p>"You have dined?" The question was perfunctory, and though
Monsieur Desportes reached for his own glass of brandy he made no
offer to pour her a <i>liqueur.</i></p>

<p>"Yes, at Madame Le Maire's. One of the students escorted me
here. He did not wish me to walk so far alone."</p>

<p>"Well, going about alone should be no novelty to you." He eyed
her shrewdly from under his bushy, greying brows. "You should be
able to conduct yourself without help by this time. You're almost
thirty."</p>

<p>Henriette flushed at his look and words. She was not ashamed of
her age, but no woman cares to be reminded of it.</p>

<p>"I am only too used to making my way alone," she answered,
stretching out her hands to the fire and taking some comfort in
their white shapeliness and the flash of a small ring which caught
the light. "I only thought you might be relieved to know&mdash;But
no matter, I am well, and you? I hope your rheumatism has not
returned."</p>

<p>The veined hand holding the stem of the brandy glass was not
altogether steady, but the denial was instant.</p>

<p>"Rheumatism! I have nothing of the sort. A twinge now and then
in the disgraceful damp of this hole they are pleased to let out in
the name of comfortable apartments. But when one has come through
the campaigns I have and slept with the snows of the Alps and the
steppes for pillow, one learns to put up with poor fare and
hardships. My health need give you no anxiety. Better keep your
concern for yourself, since, if what you wrote is true, you will
have need of it."</p>

<p>"Grandfather!" Henriette leaned forward and laid a hand on his
sleeve. "I had hoped you might be glad that I was returning to
Paris and even a little pleased and proud at the post that has been
offered me."</p>

<p>"Proud&mdash;pleased," he echoed her words heavily. Her hand
might have been a shadow on his arm for all the notice he took of
it. "You have the effrontery to ask me to be glad because you have
chosen to cast your lot with the house of Choiseul Praslin that I
hate."</p>

<p>"But it is one of the greatest families in France."</p>

<p>"They stand for everything that I spent the best years of my
life trying to stamp out of France. This white-livered nobility
that feeds on the life-blood like some poisonous fungus&mdash;that
will fasten on us again now that there is no one strong enough to
defy them."</p>

<p>Involuntarily his eyes turned to the souvenirs of his fighting
days: his sword and the uniform that hung like a grey ghost in a
corner, the portrait of Napoleon in full regalia, his framed
commission as officer in the Imperial Guard, his cherished
decorations for valour in action and the parchment which had
conferred upon him the honorary title of Baron in return for loyal
service to his country and his Emperor. As he recognised each
symbol of the lost cause to which he would always cling, his voice
took on pride along with a more intense bitterness as he
continued.</p>

<p>"First you must go to England, to the country that humiliated us
and betrayed the Emperor into exile and death. But that is not
enough. Now you must choose out of all France those who were the
first to hurry back to the side of Orl&eacute;ans when the wind
veered in that direction."</p>

<p>"Can I help it if the times have changed?" Henriette answered
his accusations quietly, but her colour deepened.</p>

<p>"You could help bringing this last insult upon me. Better
families than this Praslin tribe have not forgotten past benefits
or run so quickly to the side of the King. If the Duc de Praslin
has sold his birthright for what favours he can win from this
blundering Louis-Philippe let him take what he can get. Let him be
made an officer in the royal household. But you need not serve him
and his sons and his daughters."</p>

<p>"Grandfather"&mdash;Henriette spoke, in the firmly soothing tone
she would have used to quiet an over-excited child&mdash;"I am not
royalist in my sympathies. I should like to see France a Republic,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A fine way to show it then." He broke in testily.</p>

<p>"The Emperor Napoleon is dead," she went on, "and his son is
dead. I honour you for your loyalty to the past, but what would you
have me do? The past does not buy one food to eat, or clothes to
wear, or a roof over one's head. For nearly ten years I have had to
think of such things. I cannot afford the luxury of living in the
past."</p>

<p>"So!" The old man drained his glass and reached a shaking hand
to refill it. "Throw it in my teeth that I haven't provided you
with servants and carriages and half the Rue de la Paix to put on
your back! This is the thanks I get for educating you above your
station!"</p>

<p>"And just what is my station?" She stiffened in her chair and
faced him squarely across the untidy table with its green-shaded
oil lamp. "I should very much like to know. It has never been quite
clear to me."</p>

<p>"You need not add insolence to your other faults or reproach me
because you are poor and single. I suppose you think I should have
added a handsome dowry along with this expensive schooling that has
only made you more difficult and headstrong?"</p>

<p>"No, Grandfather, I have never reproached you, and I have not
come here asking you for money. But it is not strange that I should
want to know something of myself now that I am grown."</p>

<p>"If you know enough to keep out of mischief, that is all I ask
of you!"</p>

<p>"But I am asking <i>you</i>." His ruthlessness only made her
more determined to force an answer to what had troubled her so
long. "You have never seen fit to tell me anything of my birth or
of my parents. All I know is that I was christened Henriette
Desportes and that you are the Baron Desportes."</p>

<p>She was careful not to omit the title he clung to the more
tenaciously as it dwindled in prestige.</p>

<p>"I was told at the convent," she went on, "that you were my only
living relative; and when the other girls wrote letters to their
parents each week I wrote to you with all the affection I had in my
heart to give. I was lonely and eager to make you proud of me.
Well, I was foolish and sentimental as children will be. I tried so
hard, and I hoped&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is neither here nor there, and you are no longer a child."
He broke in irritably. "Get to the point, and tell me what you want
of me&mdash;why you have come here to-night."</p>

<p>"You are still my only relative, Grandfather." She pressed her
hands tightly together in her lap. It was hard to go on against the
wall of his displeasure, but she had determined to make one final
effort to break down his reserve.</p>

<p>"It is not right to go on year after year with such a blank in
one's life. If I have anything good in me that was theirs, I should
like to know; and if there are faults and weaknesses that have
continued in me, it is only fair that I should know these, too, and
try to overcome these defects."</p>

<p>"Defects may be overcome without knowing where they were
inherited."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it would help me to understand myself. I feel
sometimes like those silhouettes artists cut from black paper and
paste on a white card just the outlines of a person standing
against nothing. Don't let me be like that all my life."</p>

<p>"I do not propose to rake up the past. Your parents are both
dead. You know that already."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know." She sighed uneasily and watched him refill his
glass for the third time. "I should like to know that something of
passion and love went into my making. I have had little enough of
them since."</p>

<p>Her voice had grown low as she forced herself to put the last
question. But it vibrated with the intensity of her emotion as a
single harp-string twangs suddenly in a still room. The old man
roused himself. He set down the half-filled glass and leaned
towards her. His gaunt, greyish face was only an arm's length from
her, and his expression had sharpened into a hard, malignant
stare.</p>

<p>"My name is, unfortunately, yours," he told her levelly, "but
only so long as you are a credit to it. If you go against my wishes
and take this position which you propose to do, you will forfeit
the right to it."</p>

<p>"But, Grandfather, that is impossible. I cannot return to
England again, where it might be months before I found another
opening. I have done nothing to bring disgrace upon us, and if I
needed a good name before, I need it doubly now in this
family&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not mention their name to me again," he broke in. "You have
your choice. If you persist in taking this place you must not go as
Mademoiselle Desportes."</p>

<p>"But they already know that is my name. If I tell the Duc and
Duchesse otherwise they will think it most peculiar."</p>

<p>"What they think is no affair of mine. You accepted this post
before consulting me, and if you go to them you need not look to me
again for anything. You have no relatives living or dead."</p>

<p>"You cannot speak for the dead." Henriette rose and gathered her
shawl about her. She looked unusually tall in the dim room, and her
face took on a pallor in the green lamplight that gave it the
strength and colour of a marble bust. "You can only speak for
yourself, and I can only answer for myself. You need never be
afraid that I shall come to you again. After to-morrow I shall be
at the residence de Praslin in the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, Number 55, if you should care to know
where to find me."</p>

<p>She moved to the door, and though the Baron F&eacute;lix
Desportes followed her with his eyes he did not rise from his
chair. He still held the glass and, as she paused on the threshold
to the draughty corridor, Henriette saw him lift it towards the
pictured features of his Emperor with the faded knot of tricolour
dangling from the frame. With rage and pity struggling in her she
watched him offering a silent toast.</p>

<p>"Well," she told herself, feeling her way down the dark well of
the staircase, "my only bridge is burned behind me. From now on I
must build them myself or drown!"</p>

<h3>Chapter Three</h3>

<p>She walked to meet her future in the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; as if spring itself were at her heels.
The visit to her grandfather, she put behind her. His words had
shaken her momentarily, but they were, after all, only the
croakings of an embittered old man who resented her youth. To him
her hopefulness was merely one more symbol of his own declining
power. Because misfortune had turned life bitter for him, he could
not reconcile himself to another's happiness. She regretted the
grim interview of night before last, but it could not touch her.
Neither could Madame Le Maire's pointed insinuations of personal
pitfalls take root in her renewed self-assurance.</p>

<p>She felt equal to anything that morning as she passed the little
stalls with their prints and trinkets and tattered volumes along
the Quai. In one of these displays her eyes caught a print of the
Empress Josephine, highly coloured and fluttering in the river
wind, and such was her feeling of confidence that the Empress
seemed almost waving a signal to her.</p>

<p>A blind man, led by his little dog, passed, and Henriette found
a sou in her purse to drop into the extended tin cup.</p>

<p>"God bless you, mademoiselle," the man thanked her.</p>

<p>"How did you know that I am mademoiselle?" she laughed
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Ah, that was easy." He nodded. "I heard the rustle of skirts
and smelled lavender when you opened your purse. Mignon and I wish
you good luck, and may your gift be multiplied."</p>

<p>The pair moved away, the dog full of subdued importance and
curiosity, his master unhurried and detached as became one to whom
smells and rustles and footsteps determined his own small world.
There had been no one else to wish her good luck as she set forth
for her interview, and so she cherished his blessing. Better to
have one she had earned for herself than to have had none at
all.</p>

<p>Flower-vendors were selling primroses and violets. She hesitated
by one basketful, half tempted to buy a small nosegay. But they
would be dear so early, she knew. Besides, her previous experience
had taught her that such a display might create a poor first
impression. Otherwise considerate mistresses did not tolerate
jewellery and flowers on the persons of governesses in their
households. She would take no chance of offending the Duchesse at
their first meeting by even so innocent a lapse of dignity.</p>

<p>When she was within several streets of her destination she
hailed a fiacre, telling the driver to take her to the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, Number 55. Then she settled back to
compose herself for the interview.</p>

<p>The hiring of the carriage was a gesture of strategy rather than
one of fatigue. For her to have arrived on foot would have been to
make a fatal entrance. At best her position was bound to be
unpopular with the servants in any household. If it were reported
by the footman to his companions below stairs that the new
governess had walked up to the door like any nursemaid or
milliner's apprentice, she would be treated as less than such.
There would be friction enough in preserving her rights without
making a mis-step at the start. By nature Henriette was independent
of spirit. There was little of the snob about her, and at heart she
disliked class distinctions. Yet she was practical. She knew that
only by demanding the special privileges accorded a governess could
she be acknowledged a successful one.</p>

<p>"Please the family, and you offend the servants," she reminded
herself as the carriage rolled on. "Please the servants, and the
family no longer trust you. I must walk the difficult path between
and keep from slipping too far in either direction. <i>Allons,</i>
a governess needs the skill of a tight-rope dancer and the cunning
of a fox."</p>

<p>They were drawing up to the entrance of an imposing residence
now. The fa&ccedil;ade with its long windows, the crest above the
exquisitely wrought ironwork of the gates, and the clipped trees in
their pots made the London house she had so lately left seem shabby
by comparison. Her impulse was to jump out quickly and pull the
bell, but she restrained herself and sent the grumbling driver to
do so for her. When the porter in livery answered the summons she
alighted decorously, paid the fare and tip; and was admitted into
an inner courtyard, round which the wings of the house were built.
Through this she followed the servant into a chilly reception-room.
A footman accepted her card on a silvery tray, and she was left to
wait alone. She rose and studied her reflection in a wall mirror,
and felt relieved to discover that the wind had not disarranged her
hair, which curled softly on either side of her face and was drawn
into a low knot behind. She pulled the strands forward a little to
suggest more oval contours than Nature had seen fit to give her.
The walk had brightened her colour, and her bonnet was really
becoming and at the same time not to dashing for her r&ocirc;le.
Yes, she was sure the servant had been impressed by her appearance.
If he did not instantly label her as the new governess, she had at
least one point in her favour.</p>

<p>She heard his returning footsteps and had just time to reach her
chair and spread her skirts about her when he entered.</p>

<p>"The Duc and Duchesse will see you, mademoiselle. This way, if
you please."</p>

<p>She followed him up a flight of stairs and then along a carpeted
hall of vast length with many doors opening on either side. At the
far end they paused, and the servant raised his hand to knock. As
he did so a woman's voice raised to a shrill pitch of intensity
came too distinctly for the listeners to miss.</p>

<p>"You know my feelings; it's no use pretending surprise. Every
one in this house knows the pleasure you take in humiliating
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lower, indistinct murmur of a man's voice under complete
control followed, and then the woman's rose again.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is humiliating before the children and the servants,
and now you will have a new audience in her. Don't think I'm fool
enough not to know why you've sent for her. Mademoiselle Maillard
satisfied me in every way, but because she was no longer young and
attractive&mdash;because she sympathised with me in my
misery&mdash;you must turn her out. I tell you I cannot stand
another change and more insults. Every day the children treat me as
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>Once more the deeper tones broke in and, seizing this
opportunity, the servant knocked loudly. As they waited the word to
enter, he turned and fixed Henriette with a significant look. She
pretended indifference, but she was quick to catch its
meaning&mdash;the sly amusement that accompanied the almost
imperceptible shrug of his shoulders in their green broadcloth
livery.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Henriette Desportes," he announced in formal
accents and left her standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>She was always to remember that room as she saw it in the spring
sunlight with her own senses heightened by anxiety over the
impression she hoped to make and startled at what she had
unwittingly overheard. It was a small, intimate room, evidently the
parlour of a woman's suite. The draperies were deep rose colour,
the white and gilt furniture exquisitely upholstered in flowered
brocade that repeated the same shade. Sun streamed in at the long
windows, touching the garlands on the carpet to brightness wherever
it fell. Potted plants bloomed on the window-sill&mdash;rose and
white cyclamens with flowers like tropic birds arrested in flight.
A small secretary stood near by with scattered sheets and quill
pens flung down as if someone recently writing there had been
hastily disturbed. She was aware of all this before her eyes found
the man and woman to whom the voices must have belonged.</p>

<p>The woman lay upon a chaise longue beside a small grate fire,
and even in the loose n&eacute;glig&eacute; of cr&ecirc;pe de Chine
and lace which flowed about her voluminously, Henriette saw that
the lines of her body were soft and full, heavy with natural
voluptuousness and the wide contours of childbearing. One was aware
of her flesh first and of her features and expression afterwards,
as one must notice the body before the spirit in any canvas by the
artist Rubens. The Corsican strain was apparent in the inky shadows
of her falling hair, in the thick dark brows and the startlingly
red lips that showed in such marked contrast to the pallor of her
over-full face. It was the most sensuous and at the same time
unsatisfied mouth Henriette had ever seen, and there was no smile
of even perfunctory greeting upon it or in the velvet black eyes
under their lazy lids.</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse"&mdash;Henriette had not expected to speak
the first word, but the silence grew too marked&mdash;"I trust I am
not too early, but I understood you would grant me an interview at
eleven."</p>

<p>The occupant of the chaise longue made a vague gesture with her
head, but gave no other sign of acknowledgment. Henriette took a
step forward and looked about for a chair. As she did so the other
figure moved into her view from the windows. He had been standing
close to the hangings, but now he took shape before her with
extraordinary vividness. She saw that he was in his middle
thirties, and that he wore a grey and green-striped dressing-gown
that accentuated his fairness and the long lines of his body. His
hair and the side whiskers which he wore trimmed close were yellow
as corn silk, and the skin above them had a warm, healthy glow. His
chin showed prominent and clean-shaven with a deep cleft under a
full lower lip. In contrast the upper one was short and thin, and
when he smiled, as he was doing now, the effect was youthful
despite the high-bridged nose and the rather tired eyes. Those eyes
were far from youthful, however: they were unmistakably those of a
man who was experienced, and who could be inflexible as well as
pleasure-loving.</p>

<p>"Allow me, Mademoiselle Desportes." She recognised the timbre of
the voice she had heard from the other side of the door as she
accepted the chair he placed for her near the fire.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Monsieur le Duc," she said, seating herself
carefully so that her skirt folds might fall gracefully about her.
It was warm in the room, and she let her shawl slip over the
chair-back. Her grey alpaca was far from stylish, but it fitted
well; and she drew off the new dove-coloured gloves she had
purchased yesterday in an extravagant impulse. She busied herself
with their removal, not wishing to continue her scrutiny of the Duc
and his lady. Except for a heavy sigh the latter made no attempt to
begin the inevitable questions. It was awkward, this silence,
broken only by the soft sound of the fire and the idle drumming of
long, well-kept fingers on the marble mantelpiece as the Duc leaned
against the fluted pillars which supported it. Henriette had never
been so openly inspected, but she felt no embarrassment at the
appraisal. Rather a sense of power and strange security filled her.
This luxurious room, this expensive robe of silk and lace, this
family title, and even this handsome husband might belong to the
woman before her; but for all that she was less at her ease than
the governess who waited respectful, and completely
self-possessed.</p>

<p>She was just in time to catch a frown and an impatient motion
from the Duc to the Duchesse. It was the wife's place to conduct
such interviews, and she evidently from annoyance or timidity
refused to assume the expected r&ocirc;le. Henriette gave no hint
that she had noticed the sign; but she realised that the reins of
authority had slipped from her prospective mistress's hands, and
she lost no time in seizing them. Very well then, since the other
woman had not availed herself of her rights, the positions would be
reversed, and she must begin the questioning.</p>

<p>"Please allow me to express my gratitude for the compliment you
have paid in summoning me to discuss your children's education. I
hope my references were satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"The references&mdash;Oh, yes&mdash;quite so." The Duchesse's
manner did not vary from its irresolute vagueness.</p>

<p>"More than that, they were excellent." The Duc's voice caught up
the unfinished sentence, and he continued to regard Henriette
intently.</p>

<p>"There must, of course, be much more that you would wish to know
about me. Many points, that is to say, which could not be put into
a letter. And I, for my part, should wish to know more about my
charges before I could assume such responsibility." Henriette
deliberately paused and turned to the woman on the chaise longue.
But she scarcely seemed to be listening. Her eyes never left her
husband's face. "For instance, Madame la Duchesse specified a very
generous salary, but she did not mention the ages of the children
or the instruction which would be expected of me? It may be that I
am not proficient enough in certain lines to meet the
requirements?"</p>

<p>"The requirements are not taxing, mademoiselle." The Duc
unhesitatingly answered the question addressed to his wife, and she
allowed him to continue without protest, indeed without any effort
at entering into the conversation. "With your experience you will
have little difficulty. Our two older sons, as you may already
know, have their own tutor, while three of our daughters are
attending the Convent of the Sacred Heart. That leaves four who
would be your sole charge now. Isabella, our eldest daughter, now
nearly fourteen; Louise, just entering her teens; and two much
smaller&mdash;Berthe, who will be six next month, and our youngest
child, Raynald, not yet four. You do not have any objection, I
hope, to undertaking the care of a boy?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Henriette responded, pleased at the interest
he took in his children, "I should relish a touch of masculinity in
the nursery. I think it far better when boys and girls mingle,
certainly while they are still so young."</p>

<p>"He is a bright little fellow, but I must warn you that he is
rather delicate. His health has given me grave anxiety."</p>

<p>She did not fail to notice that he said "me" instead of the "us"
she expected to hear.</p>

<p>"I understand," she answered. "Such a child needs particular
watchfulness. An over-active mind can so easily exhaust a frail
body."</p>

<p>"I am sure we may rely on you, mademoiselle, to instruct without
over-taxing his strength. I can see you are sympathetic to the
special needs of a high-strung child."</p>

<p>"Raynald is very sensitive like me." The Duchesse spoke
suddenly, though she addressed her words towards the fireplace and
the man beside it, not to the governess she was ostensibly
interviewing. "I was ill and unhappy before his birth, and he will
always bear the marks of my suffering."</p>

<p>The Duc gave the fire an impatient kick. Sparks started up from
the logs. Henriette was less aware of these than of the intangible
sparks of human antagonism which filled the room.</p>

<p>"Have you any preferences," she continued after an awkward
period of silence, "as to the language I should use in their
studies? I am accustomed to teaching in both English and
French."</p>

<p>The Duchesse having dispatched her dart, relapsed into
preoccupied apathy and made no effort to answer.</p>

<p>"English, I think, for the two older girls." Her husband again
took command of the situation. "They speak it fairly well, but both
need practice in writing it. With the younger two, I should leave
that to your discretion. I wish them to learn it naturally."</p>

<p>"I think that will come about easily if they are in the room
while I go over the lessons with their older sisters. They will
unconsciously absorb much of the conversation without realising
that they are doing so."</p>

<p>"An excellent suggestion. I am sure we shall see an improvement
in their speech. Mademoiselle Maillard complained of a difficulty
in forcing them to use anything but French."</p>

<p>"Certainly they will never acquire proficiency in any language
by force," Henriette agreed.</p>

<p>"I have had no fault to find with Mademoiselle Maillard." Once
more the Duchesse roused herself, and once more Henriette felt that
the conversation had become a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te in
which she was an unwilling participant. "She has proved her loyalty
and her affection, Theo, which you seem to forget all too
quickly."</p>

<p>"We are not here to discuss Mademoiselle Maillard, Fanny," he
broke in coldly. "Mademoiselle Desportes must in no way be hampered
by past methods. I wish her to feel free to handle the children as
she thinks best."</p>

<p>The dark eyes in the pale face on the chaise longue took on a
sudden gleam, as if a second fire smouldered behind their darkness.
"As <i>you</i> seem to think best," were the unspoken words she
directed towards her husband. Disregarding this mention of her
predecessor, Henriette hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p>"I regret to say I am not sufficiently skilled to instruct in
the art of music. I play a little on the piano, and I could
supervise practising if that were necessary."</p>

<p>"Their music lessons are already arranged, mademoiselle, and
they also have dancing lessons once a week. I see from your
credentials, however, that you are gifted in painting. Perhaps you
would undertake to develop little Berthe's talent in that
direction?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should be most happy to."</p>

<p>"You will find her more headstrong than her brother," the Duc
went on; "she has spirit, but if you win her
affections&mdash;well&mdash;" He smiled suddenly, showing his fine
white teeth and making a slightly deprecating gesture. "You must
pardon a father's prejudice, but she is an unusually charming and
lovable child."</p>

<p>"You need not apologise for your daughter's attractions,
Monsieur le Duc." Henriette had seldom heard a man speak with such
naturalness of his children. She felt the bond which existed
between him and them, and it filled her with surprise and
admiration. "Never having known a father's interest and affection
myself, I can think of no greater blessing than such loving
prejudice. They are most fortunate."</p>

<p>The Duchesse sighed heavily. It was the only sign of life from
the heap of silk and lace before the fire.</p>

<p>"I should also speak of religion." Henriette felt she could no
longer postpone a subject which she knew must be faced, and which
she dreaded to open. "I think you already know that, although I was
christened and reared in a convent, I have adopted the Protestant
faith. I tell you this now, frankly, because I should not wish
misunderstandings."</p>

<p>A triumphant gleam appeared in the Duchesse's eyes. "There,
Th&eacute;obold." She spoke before he had time to answer. "You see
what comes of sending to England as you insisted upon doing. The
situation will be impossible."</p>

<p>"I cannot see why it should be, Fanny, unless Mademoiselle
Desportes wishes to make an issue of religion; and she strikes me
as being far too wise for that."</p>

<p>"Nothing is further from my mind." Henriette dared to direct a
grateful glance towards the Duc. "I must follow my own beliefs as I
wish others to follow theirs. I have reverence and affection for
the good Sisters who cared for me in my childhood. It would never
cross my mind to interfere in the religious training of your own
children:"</p>

<p>"Your very presence would be enough to upset their faith." The
Duchesse's voice had lost its vagueness. For the first time that
morning Henriette caught a defiant note in her accents. "It would
be hypocrisy to disregard it."</p>

<p>"That would depend entirely upon Mademoiselle Desportes's
attitude, Fanny," the Duc remonstrated. "She says she respects the
faith of others, and I see no reason to doubt her assurances.
Besides, the Abb&eacute; Gallard has always dealt with their
religious instruction, as he will continue to do."</p>

<p>"It is an insult to the Abb&eacute; to allow such a thing."</p>

<p>"I will explain it to him myself if you wish." He turned once
more to Henriette and continued in a firm, self-composed
manner.</p>

<p>"So long as your religious convictions remain your own, I am
sure there will be no reason for complaint. I think"&mdash;he
turned and fixed his wife with a long, meaning look&mdash;"that
tolerance is a virtue we could all benefit by cultivating."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Henriette allowed the relief to show in her answer.
"I am very grateful, and I shall do nothing to betray your trust in
me." She waited a moment, wondering if the Duchesse would press the
issue. But only the sharp rising and falling of the lace on the
soft curves of those ample breasts gave evidence of emotion. "And
there is another matter." Henriette pressed her handkerchief
tightly between her hands as she summoned courage to mention the
other obstacle that she found so difficult to express. "It is
rather a personal one which I could not explain in my letter. It is
a little favour to ask, but I should prefer to be called by the
name Deluzy&mdash;Henriette Deluzy."</p>

<p>"This is rather unusual," the Duc answered. "Are we to
understand that you are not Mademoiselle Desportes?"</p>

<p>It seemed to her that both pairs of eyes, the greenish-grey and
the dusky, stared at her with suspicion. Everything, she knew,
depended upon the plausibility of her excuse. She disliked telling
a lie, but her grandfather had driven her into a tight place. She
must stick to the story she had concocted in the wakeful hours
following her visit to him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid this must seem like a strange request." She went on
in her most deferential manner. "I hesitate to bore you with
details of my own life, which has not"&mdash;she sighed effectively
and pressed her handkerchief to her lips as if to steady
them&mdash;"been too happy so far."</p>

<p>"That is to be regretted." The Duc covered his curiosity with
polite concern. The Duchesse roused herself a little, as if this
new turn of affairs renewed her confidence.</p>

<p>"Very few of us are happy in this world." The Duchesse gave
another of her deep, meaning sighs. "Have the goodness to explain
this mystery of your name."</p>

<p>"Give her time, Fanny. Can't you see that is what she is trying
to do!"</p>

<p>Reassured by his tone, Henriette went on, summoning all her
skill to touch her listeners.</p>

<p>"No, it has not been easy to face life alone. For a man it must
be different, but a woman was not meant by nature to be brave and
lonely. I have often felt&mdash;" She broke off with just the
proper shading of helplessness, and the effect was not lost upon
one of her audience of two. The Duchesse moved impatiently, but she
refrained from interrupting. "I have been known as Henriette
Desportes because the name belonged to my relative&mdash;my
foster-father, who was also my guardian. Out of respect to him I
made no protest, but now there is no further need to use it."</p>

<p>"He is dead, then, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes with an inclination of the head. It was
somehow easier to lie by implication than by word; and after all,
she reminded herself, her grandfather had been foster-father to
her, and he was certainly dead now as far as she was concerned.</p>

<p>"I am quite alone in the world," she added with resignation and
appeal in her voice, "and one turns back to one's own parents, even
if there is no memory of them. I felt I could speak of this to you
and that you would understand my request because of the great
reverence you bear to your own family names. Mine is unknown
compared to yours; but it is mine, and I take pride in it."</p>

<p>"Well!" The Duchesse frowned and tapped the floor with a satin
slipper. "I must say it seems very strange to me after all these
years to shift about so."</p>

<p>"There is no reason why mademoiselle should not be called
whatever she pleases in this house." The Duc swept aside his wife's
objections impulsively. "I am glad you did not hesitate to express
your wishes. You must always feel free to do so while you are with
us&mdash;and may I hope that will be for a long time, Mademoiselle
Deluzy."</p>

<p>Henriette warmed to the graciousness of his answer. It was
impossible not to respond when this man cared to exert his charm as
he was doing now in his consideration of her. His masculine
magnetism dominated the whole room. Even more than his good looks
and vitality, this easy naturalness and unaffected cordiality
filled her with delighted surprise. She had expected, if she saw
the father of her young pupils at all, to find him formal and
detached as became the head of one of the oldest and most
influential families of France, and here he was full of concern for
his children and eager to put her at her ease. Intentionally or
not, he had won her allegiance. Common sense and past experience
warned her that it would be far more advisable to keep in the good
graces of the children's mother, yet Henriette realised that in all
differences&mdash;and she felt instinctively after half an hour's
association with these two that there would never be any lack of
such clashes&mdash;she would always find herself and
Th&eacute;obold, Duc de Choiseul-Praslin, in complete accord.</p>

<p>The interview was over. She had won her points, and her white
lie had been accepted. No turning back now. She must answer to the
name she had chosen because the initials would match the copper
nails on her portmanteau.</p>

<p>It was the Duchesse's place to dismiss her, but when Henriette
turned to the woman who was now her mistress she found the heavy
lids had drooped over the dark eyes. The plump white hands moved
inadequately among the laces of her n&eacute;glig&eacute;, and she
appeared almost to have forgotten the whole discussion. All her
thoughts were centred upon the man who stayed motionless near the
fire. He alone existed for her in that room. The more she turned,
reaching out invisible arms to hold him, the more he seemed to
stiffen and hold her back though he leaned as carelessly as he had
before. It was awkward waiting there for her dismissal like a
charity child. But it was not the Duchesse who came to her
rescue.</p>

<p>"Then we may rely upon Mademoiselle Deluzy to take up her duties
to-morrow." He pronounced the name with emphatic clarity. "Does
that meet with your satisfaction, Fanny?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you say." The voice had lapsed into injured
acquiescence.</p>

<p>There was that in the tone which said far more than the
perfunctory agreement. "You will do what you wish in any case,
whether you humiliate me or not," was the implication.</p>

<p>Henriette made a move to suggest that she was ready for
permission to leave. But the Duc motioned her to remain seated.</p>

<p>"I have sent for the children," he explained. "They will be
through their morning lessons at twelve, and I asked Mademoiselle
Maillard to bring them here. I thought it might be easier for you
to meet now, before you begin your duties."</p>

<p>The Duchesse's heavy brows drew together in a frown. Already
Henriette was beginning to know that expression and to dread
it.</p>

<p>"You might have told me, Theo. I was planning to dress for a
drive before <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>."</p>

<p>A knock cut short her protest, and the Duc hastened to open the
door himself. Henriette turned with sharpened curiosity to face the
little group she was to know intimately in so short a time. A
spindling, dark-haired boy and a rosy, fair little girl came first,
breaking away from the efforts of a middle-aged woman of
nondescript dress and appearance who tried to curb their jubilance
at sight of their father.</p>

<p>Behind them two older girls clung together in dumpy shyness.
Both were brunette, like their mother, and would have been
attractive except for adolescent self-consciousness and poor
carriage. Their merino dresses were an unbecoming shade of
dark-blue with white braid edging, fashioned too childishly for
their already maturing figures, and their hair, though naturally
thick and lustrous, was strained back severely from their foreheads
and ears. Mentally Henriette saw them changed before her; saw them
moving erect and at ease, their young bodies responding to softly
draped dresses of crimson or mulberry, their eyes less anxious,
their lips more ready for laughter.</p>

<p>"Isabella&mdash;Louise, come and make your curtsies to
Mademoiselle Deluzy," their father was urging.</p>

<p>Obediently they went through the painful motions of
presentation&mdash;awkward and solemn as two performing bears being
put through their paces.</p>

<p>"We shall change all that," Henriette thought, inwardly rising
to meet their need. "Grace will come when they are happy and at
ease."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Maillard acknowledged the introduction with even
greater stiffness, though youthful shyness could scarcely be
offered as her excuse. Henriette knew at sight that the former
governess would be a thorn in her side so long as they both
remained under the same roof. But she did not fear her as a rival.
She knew her type too well&mdash;colourless, bitter-lipped, and
ambiguous; one who would be overbearing with servants and those she
considered inferior, and would overdo her meeching and humility
with superiors. Such a woman resented her position yet had not the
cleverness or good sense to take advantage of the possibilities it
offered. Her narrow, hunched shoulders gave her away as did her
hands. Yellowing, ineffectual hands, Henriette noticed, typical of
the gentlewoman who works against her will and as seldom as
possible.</p>

<p>It was only too evident where Mademoiselle Maillard's allegiance
lay. She acknowledged the Duc's casual greeting with formality, and
then overwhelmed the Duchesse with solicitous inquiries for her
health.</p>

<p>"See," her attitude seemed to be saying as she crossed to a
place by the chaise longue, "we must stand together against this
new enemy. Your husband may find me too plain and dull to suit his
fancy, but Mademoiselle Maillard will never desert you or let a
younger face and figure come between us and our rights."</p>

<p>The two older girls watched her and their mother with anxious
glances; but the little boy and girl had eyes and ears for their
father, and their father alone. Mademoiselle Maillard's nervous
remonstrances fell upon heedless ears.</p>

<p>"Raynald, take care! How many times must I tell you to watch out
for the fender. Some day you will fall head-first into the fire and
be burned to a crisp. Berthe, come here. Your slipper is untied.
No, no, leave your mamma's desk alone. The ink&mdash;<i>Mon
Dieu!</i> You will upset it."</p>

<p>But her words fell on these two like the drip of distant rain,
especially upon little Berthe.</p>

<p>"What a child!" Henriette thought, following the swift, gay
grace of the small body; noting the merry glance of those clear,
fearless eyes, the fine bright hair that fell about the
warmly-rounded cheeks. She was one of those rare children who seem
to carry some charm against evil and pain and despair. Their
laughter rings clearer and higher; their tears are more tempestuous
and must be dried more quickly; their footsteps are more light and
sure. Such a little boy or little girl becomes to older eyes less
an individual than the very embodiment of all childhood knocking at
the doors of an anxious old world. Always they are unaware of the
secret that wins them more favours, and more friends than their
mates. They never guess the reason till the gift has been lost for
ever along the thorny, difficult road that lies between childhood
and maturity.</p>

<p>Watching the little girl as she moved about the room like some
new species of bird or flower, Henriette forgot momentarily the
other occupants of the Duchesse's small salon. She looked up at
last to find the Duc in turn watching her. He must have caught the
softness that lingered in her eyes, for his own turned to her
across the room. No muscle of his face moved, but a light filled
those eyes staring into hers; and she knew he was touched by her
admiration of his child.</p>

<p>"No, Raynald!" Mademoiselle Maillard's voice rose in shrill
command. "Come away from there at once. You naughty, naughty boy to
pick mamma's flowers."</p>

<p>She darted to the window-boxes, but too late to prevent the
catastrophe. Raynald stood rooted in his place, his face awry with
dazed guilt; a broken bloom of cyclamen in his hand. Mademoiselle
Maillard's discipline broke over his smooth dark head.</p>

<p>"For this you will stay at home to-day when we drive to the
Guignol, and for supper no baba&mdash;not one spoonful. Whatever
made you do such a thing?"</p>

<p>The large, inexplicable tears of childhood began to rise and
pour down his cheeks. "It was for mademoiselle." Still clutching
the forbidden flower, he struggled to explain away his crime. "To
put on her dress."</p>

<p>A surprised smile spread over Mademoiselle Maillard's lips, and
she could not resist directing a triumphant glance in the
Duchesse's direction.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was kind, Raynald. A very kind thought, but you should
have asked mamma's permission first. Perhaps if you do so now she
will let you give it to me."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" He choked back a sob, and the truth came
out in a rush before the next spasm. "I picked it for the new
mademoiselle because she has pink ribbons on her b-b-bonnet."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Maillard stiffened visibly; the two older girls
lowered their eyes, and even the Duc turned hastily to occupy
himself with the fire. The Duchesse put her hands to her head as
Raynald's sobs broke out afresh, and Henriette stirred uneasily in
her chair. Only small Berthe continued her explorations of pens and
paper at the desk, oblivious to the crisis which had arisen.</p>

<p>"Well, you may give it to her then, since you have picked it."
Mademoiselle Maillard's voice had resumed its dry accents of
nursery authority once more. "But you will stay at home from the
drive and go without dessert for your disobedience."</p>

<p>With hanging head and heaving chest the boy drew close to
Henriette and limply offered the flower that had precipitated so
much trouble. She took it from his hand and thanked him politely. A
rush of tenderness and pity for his plight and bewilderment, and of
pleasure at this early sign of devotion, filled her. But she knew
better than to show her gratification. She must be tactful now at
the start, and besides, Mademoiselle Maillard was the loser.</p>

<p>"I think," Henriette bent low to whisper in the little boy's
ear, "I think since it is your mamma's flower it would be nice if
you gave it to her."</p>

<p>She turned all her powers of persuasion upon him, while he
hesitated, unconscious of the importance of his response.</p>

<p>"See how pretty it will look in her lace," Henriette continued
softly, feeling the silky smoothness of his dark hair and the
stubborn set of his small shoulders. "I will pretend I am wearing
it when I go out&mdash;here." She went through the motions of
tucking an imaginary flower in her dress as she urged him.</p>

<p>The bit of play worked. Raynald flashed her a moist smile and
ran to offer the flower. His mother took it with an absent-minded
caress. Mademoiselle Maillard, slightly mollified, hurried to set
the desk to rights, while Berthe ran to embrace her father about
the knees.</p>

<p>The servant who had shown Henriette in an hour before now
appeared to conduct her to the gates. She rose and made her
farewells. The salon door closed behind her first encounter with
the Praslin family, but not before she had accepted a grateful
glance from the Duc.</p>

<h3>Chapter Four</h3>

<p>To lie warm and unhurried in the depths of a bed soft with
eiderdown and fine linen; to hear the pelt of rain at the windows
and know that by merely reaching for the bell-rope beside her she
could summon a maid to draw her curtains, light a fire, and fetch
hot water: this was a sensation so new to Henriette that even after
a week she still marvelled at the recurring miracle. No more
valiant charges from bed into arctic chillness and determined
splashings of cold water while teeth chattered and icy fingers
fumbled to fasten buttons and arrange hair. No more standing on
tiptoe to peer into cracked or dimming mirrors. Now she sipped her
<i>caf&eacute; au lait</i> at ease and made her leisurely toilette
by a fire, before a mirror that did not distort her features. At
half-past eight she would emerge, trim and refreshed, to greet her
charges and preside over their morning rolls and chocolate at the
head of the table where Mademoiselle Maillard sat at the opposite
end, grey and furtive, waiting to pounce upon slights and
misdemeanours with the avidity of a hawk.</p>

<p>The two ends of that table were identical, and yet from the
first morning they had breakfasted there together, Henriette's end
had become the head and Mademoiselle Maillard's the foot.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy, Raynald has upset the honey. Quick! It's
running into my lap."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy, Berthe ate three crescents, and now
there's none left for me!"</p>

<p>"But I tell you I didn't mean to spill the cream. How could I
help it, Mademoiselle Deluzy, when Louise tickled me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mademoiselle Deluzy! I dreamed last night that Papa took us
to the opera&mdash;Isabella and you and me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And me, Louise&mdash;did I go too?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, Berthe&mdash;you're too little, even in a dream.
And, Mademoiselle Deluzy, they say if you dream the same thing
three times it always comes true. Do you believe it might."</p>

<p>Their spontaneous including of her in all their doings, their
natural appeal to her as the centre of authority was flattering;
but it had its drawbacks. Mademoiselle Maillard's long face grew
daily longer and more disapproving. Her air of injured pride
wrapped her like an ominous mantle. She brooded on slights real and
imagined. Henriette guessed in what light they were duly reported
to the children's mother. Secretly elated over her triumph,
Henriette determined to give her predecessor no cause for
complaint. She made it a point to draw Mademoiselle Maillard into
the conversation whenever possible, to take no apparent notice of
sniffs, and frowns and pointed sighs. But perhaps she would have
done better to return the order woman's hostility in kind; to repay
envy with an envy she had no need to feel since the welfare of the
east wing of Number 55 Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; had now
been transferred into the hollow of her hands. It was a spacious
wing, this that housed the young Praslins and their staff; but it
was not large enough for two governesses to reign equally supreme.
Already the servants in their quarters were watching and laying
bets on the probable winner.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Maillard had lasted longer than other governesses
and she was not without her household supporters. Madame Marguerite
Leclerc, lady's maid to the Duchesse, and she were on the best of
terms. Euphemia Merville, the concierge's wife, frequently invited
her in to drink coffee on her free afternoons. Maxine and
Ren&eacute;e, the nursemaids, had found her an easy superior; for
she seldom interfered with their management of the children.
Domestic newcomers were always regarded as natural enemies till
time or some household crisis proved them to be otherwise; and
there was about Mademoiselle Deluzy a crisp assurance of manner, a
nicety of speech that prejudiced inferiors. Nothing escaped those
keen hazel eyes of hers, and they knew it. She performed her own
duties with conscientious and efficient scrupulousness; therefore
she would not be apt to tolerate any laxness in others. Gone were
the easy days when Mademoiselle Maillard reigned, wrapped in her
own concerns, and the children's wing might safely gather a layer
of dust or remain cluttered for days on end without comment.</p>

<p>The subject of the new governess's name had already aroused
curious comment among the staff. Jean, the porter, and
Andr&eacute;, the footman, both insisted they had announced her
first as Mademoiselle Desportes; yet here she was being addressed
by all as Mademoiselle Deluzy. In all such matters Jean's memory
was reliable, and it seemed strange indeed that this change should
have occurred without explanation. They were unanimous in feeling
that Deluzy was not a proper name for one they considered an upper
servant no better than themselves&mdash;much too fanciful and
high-flown for their approval; and they resented it
unreasonably.</p>

<p>And then there was the matter of religion. Ang&eacute;le, who
cared for the rooms in the east wing, had reported that there was
no sign of crucifix or rosary in Mademoiselle Deluzy's apartment.
Only a Bible and a book in English with a cross on the cover kept
them from branding her as an infidel. Perhaps, Ang&eacute;le even
dared to suggest, she might actually be one, and these some cunning
ruse to deceive the Duc and Duchesse. Certainly she left the
schoolroom during the Abb&eacute; Gallard's hours of religious
instruction and remained apart till he left. Whatever her faith, it
was not that of the Praslin household; and, since the Duchesse was
devout almost to the point of fanaticism, this in itself took on
the proportions of eccentricity.</p>

<p>Henriette herself was only half aware of this domestic
disapproval. She expected a certain amount of antagonism in any
household where a governess must keep her difficult footing in the
shifting gulf that lies between drawing-room and kitchen. The
social dignity of dinners and receptions was denied her as well as
the hearty freedom of a servants' dining-room. It was lonely to be
slightly more than maid and considerably less than mistress. But
she had grown used to loneliness; her training in it had begun
early. Experience had taught her immunity to slights and petty
jealousies. She knew how far she might safely press her privileges
and when to waive her authority, for her technique had been
perfected in a hard school. She relied upon her personal magnetism
and versatility to hold the affection of her young charges, and
upon her tact, reliability, and skill as an instructress to win the
parents to her side. Servants might at first resent her; but if
they were good ones, they usually came to accept her in time. If
they were inefficient they were not apt to remain long enough to
cause her lasting inconvenience. But an old governess who must be
met and placated at every turn presented an altogether different
problem.</p>

<p>"Always a fly in the ointment," she thought, stirring in the
green and gilt Empire bed as she prepared to rise and face the last
day of her first week in the Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;. "More
like a spider than a fly, she is&mdash;and how she would love to
see me packing my bags again!"</p>

<p>In spite of a downpour outside, the rooms seemed positively gay
in their gold and green. Yellow draperies lent false sunshine to
the small boudoir beyond her bedroom, and the thick carpet lay like
green moss under her feet. After years of retiring to some cramped
haven of an upper bedroom or an alcove adjoining the schoolroom
with its mingled scents of chalk and ink and scalded milk,
Henriette had been unprepared for the elegance and charm of what
had already become a personal and private small world of her own.
Each morning when she woke and each evening when she returned to
this sanctuary, those rooms welcomed her with their bright ease
till her spirit responded.</p>

<p>"Almost I can feel myself purr like a cat," she told her own
reflection in the gilt-framed oval of mirror above her
dressing-table.</p>

<p>To Henriette the mirror was more a symbol of new-found luxury
than anything else in the whole apartment. More than the fire, the
thick carpet, the comfortable bed and chairs, more even than the
rosewood bureau that could be converted into a perfectly appointed
desk, the mirror's flawless glass made her an equal, as it were,
with women who were desirable to husbands or lovers. Heretofore
some inadequate square of glass set too high, or dim with age and
imperfections, had been good enough for a governess to take stock
of her appearance. A good mirror need not be wasted on
mademoiselle, since an inconspicuous neatness of person was all
that any household expected of her. Indeed, to give more was
regarded as a distinct breach of taste and propriety. Years
afterwards Henriette could summon to her memory every curve of the
gilded scrollwork which framed that glass. She never mentioned it
to any one else, but to herself she admitted the part it had played
in shaping her life, in making her a woman first, and a governess
second.</p>

<p>She did not admit that there was a subtle, new incentive for her
to appear her best upon all occasions. Until now she had not known
what it was to feel the approval of a man's eyes as they rested
upon her. Of course there had been a brief masculine encounter or
two, such as passing friendships with the students at Madame Le
Maire's. But these had been casual, and for the most part they had
flourished upon mental congeniality. In London she had been
consigned to the society of women. The Hislop dinners and
receptions were middle-aged and formal, and those at which she had
occasionally been privileged to "fill in" had brought no
stimulating male contacts. A curate at the Protestant chapel she
attended had shown her marked favour, conducting her home
discreetly after service while he discoursed upon the varied trials
and inspirations of his calling. But she had not warmed to his
attentions. He was too meek and pallid to please her, and she found
him a decided bore. If she had been less clever, or more
sentimental, she might have endowed the curate or any other
unattached male she managed to meet with qualities of mind and
person supplied by her own imagination. She might have compromised
because of her own loneliness. But Henriette did not take naturally
to compromise and so, for all her shrewdness and intelligence, and
for all her emotional need, she was still heart-whole and untouched
as the two Praslin daughters who awaited her in the breakfast-room;
as Mademoiselle Maillard, who grimly faced the narrowing horizon of
her days. Henrientte's heart might be unscarred, but it was neither
youthfully hopeful nor quiet with mature resignation. For the most
part it obeyed her will, conforming to economic necessity as
rigidly as her mind and body had done in those years between the
convent and her return to Paris. Only sometimes, unaccountably, she
was aware of its power.</p>

<p>"I am like a piano," she told herself sometimes, "a piano in a
closed house. There it stands, capable of music, but doomed to
silence because no one touched the keys. Who put me in a closed
house to gather dust? Why am I lying here at twenty-eight years,
alone in a narrow bed?"</p>

<p>Yesterday she had been reminded of her unanswered question.
While Isabella and Louise were having their afternoon dancing
lesson under Mademoiselle Maillard's watchfulness, she had been
reading aloud to amuse the two younger children. Faintly along the
corridor of the east wing the notes of a polka had sounded, and her
wits had wandered though her lips mechanically uttered the words on
the pages before her. The book was a collection of fairy tales,
chosen emphatically by Berthe over the protests of Raynald, who had
asked for <i>Aesop's Fables.</i></p>

<p>"To-morrow it shall be your turn to choose, Raynald," Henriette
had promised. "Now, Berthe, find the story you wish, and listen
carefully because to-morrow I shall ask you to tell it to me in
English."</p>

<p>They had settled themselves on a window-seat, and she had begun
reading absently, half her mind on the distant music, the other
half aware of the children's soft bodies pressed close on either
side. Then suddenly the words took on reality. The old tale glowed
with personal significance:</p>

<blockquote>"And the Fairy Godmother spoke to the Princess and
said, 'My child, I have only one gift to bestow upon you. Mark my
words well, for once your choice is made it cannot be changed. It
is within my power to give you happiness while you are young or
happiness when you are old. What shall it be?'<br>
<br>
"The Princess pondered in deep thought. 'It is a hard choice, dear
Godmother, but if I spend all my share of happiness while I am
young, then I shall have nothing left to look forward to; so let me
have my happiness when I am old, and may heaven send me
patience.'<br>
<br>
"The Godmother then embraced her. 'You have made a wise choice, and
you will not regret it, my dear. Go now with my
blessing.'"</blockquote>

<p>Henriette's voice had taken on a deeper note. The children had
pressed closer, held by the dramatic intensity of her manner, and
so absorbed had the three become in the story that they had not
heard a door open and the Duc slip softly across the room to
listen.</p>

<p>"And do you agree that she made the right choice?" His voice had
startled them, breaking unexpectedly into the words of the
book.</p>

<p>"No," Berthe's decisive answer rang out. "I think she was
foolish to wait so long!"</p>

<p>"But what could she do?" Henriette had found herself smiling up
at the Duc, while she pointed out the seriousness of the problem
involved to the two little people beside her. "She had to choose
one or the other."</p>

<p>"Couldn't she haye asked for a little when she was young and a
little when she was old?" Raynald's precise small voice had
volunteered as his dark eyes turned from Mademoiselle Deluzy to his
father for reassurance.</p>

<p>"Ah, Raynald already shows signs of diplomacy." The Duc had
smiled, drawing the frail, serious child close. "But it's not so
easy as that, is it, Mademoiselle Deluzy?"</p>

<p>His tone had been light, but she had felt his eyes bent upon
her. Site had tried not to look up, not to be drawn into the
discussion, but she had not been able to keep herself apart. For
all his bantering veneer of manner, she had felt a curious
persistence behind his question, as if he really wanted to know her
answer. When she had raised her eyes from the book, they met his
intent gaze. His lips had been gay and smiling, but his eyes had
held hers in a look of genuine appeal. She had caught the appraisal
behind them, and this made her feel both elated and
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"No," she had answered in all seriousness, "it is not so easy as
that. I hope I should have made as wise a choice as that princess,
but not many are wise when they are young; and happiness isn't a
little cake that can be cut to fit our needs, a crumb here, a slice
there."</p>

<p>"If it were I'm afraid our little Berthe here would swallow hers
much too fast." He had lifted the child to his lap and stroked the
thick fair hair that was so like his own. "Go on, mademoiselle. I
find myself as impatient as these two to hear the rest of the
story."</p>

<p>He had watched her across the children's heads, his eyes still
challenging, still grave above his smiling, red mouth. She had read
on, stimulated by her new audience, giving her voice and mind to
the unfolding of the tale. The Princess had suffered and been
sorely tried. Thorns and a cruel stepmother had beset her path; her
burdens had weighed heavily, and dangers beset her on every hand.
The Prince had been long in arriving. Twilight had fallen on the
schoolroom before they were united at last to live happily ever
after and fulfil the Fairy Godmother's prophecy.</p>

<p>"Bravo, mademoiselle," the Duc had praised when she closed the
book. "I shall know how to avoid boredom on other rainy afternoons.
Do you know you are very dramatic? I came very near shedding a tear
or two for that unfortunate heroine."</p>

<p>"Ah! Now you make sport of me, Monsieur le Duc." But Henriette
had felt a pleased glow steal over her under cover of the darkening
room.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy reads beautifully, Papa," the little girl's
eager voice insisted. "She doesn't read like a mademoiselle at all,
does she?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I was trying to tell Mademoiselle Deluzy."
She felt that he turned to her again, though the room had grown too
dim for her to see his face.</p>

<p>"That part where the Princess pleaded her innocence before they
threw her into the dungeon would have done credit to the great
Rachel herself. You caught the same tragic thrill of voice. It was
extraordinary."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary indeed," Henriette had protested; "particularly
since I have never heard or seen her."</p>

<p>"You have never seen Rachel?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur le Duc. You see I have been away in England, and
now that I am no longer there she will pay her promised visit to
London. <i>Eh bien</i>&mdash;so it goes."</p>

<p>"Well, well, that can be easily remedied. She has not crossed
the Channel yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>The appearance of a servant to light the lamps and draw the
curtains had interrupted his sentence.</p>

<p>Henriette had made no further comment. He had spoken
impulsively, and there was no reason to expect him to remember his
words.</p>

<p>Presently Mademoiselle Maillard had returned with Isabella and
Louise and after a few words with them he had slipped away as
quietly as he had come.</p>

<p>These unexpected visits of his gave a new zest to the days. At
any moment he might appear in the schoolroom, now in the loose
dressing-gown that lent such casual informality to his handsome
face and figure; or again he might be in street attire with
spotless fawn or dove-grey trousers strapped to shining boots, a
high stock setting off his fairness, and a broadcloth coat of rich
blue or green cut in the latest fashion. Only the night before, he
had come in full evening regalia before he and the Duchesse
departed for dinner and the opera. Henriette and the two older
girls had been alone by the lamp-lit table, deep in the next day's
history lesson. He had stood above them like a blond giant in snowy
white and dense black, his silk hat shining and his opera cloak
flowing from broad shoulders. Henriette had seen such apparitions
alighting from carriages or strolling past caf&eacute;s on the few
occasions that she had been out at the hour when theatres and opera
houses opened or closed their doors. But she had never been within
a few feet of such a figure of masculine elegance, and the sight
was extremely pleasant to her.</p>

<p>"Papa, are you going to a reception at the Palais Royal?"
Isabella had cried in admiration.</p>

<p>"No, only to dine and then with Mamma to the opera."</p>

<p>"The opera? Oh, Papa, which one, and when shall we be old enough
to go too?"</p>

<p>"Not too soon, Louise. For Isabella in two years perhaps; for
you at least another three." He had smiled at their flushed
impatience and flicked away a bit of lint from his lapel. "The
opera is called 'Norma,' and I must confess I find it extremely
boring. Thank God, most women do not lose their tempers or tell
their most cherished secrets in high C!"</p>

<p>Henriette knew this comment had been added for her benefit. She
would have liked nothing better than to retort with a smile: "A
high C or D is nothing for a woman to reach when her temper is
roused." But she had remained silent while the two girls surrounded
their father with eager chatter and admiring comment.</p>

<p>"A gardenia for your boutonniere," one of them had cried.
"Gardenias are Mamma's favourite flower. She told me so
herself."</p>

<p>"How fortunate!" he had told them. "She is wearing a wreath of
gardenias to-night. Here"&mdash;pulling the flower from his
buttonhole, he had tossed it to the two before he turned to go. "I
came to ask about Raynald, Mademoiselle Deluzy. He did not seem
well to me this morning, and I wished to be reassured before we
left."</p>

<p>"He complained of feeling chilly at supper, Monsieur le Duc; so
I put him to bed early myself and saw that he took his medicine. I
think"&mdash;she had hesitated before finishing her
report&mdash;"it would have been better if he had not gone for the
drive this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Most certainly he should not have gone. Why did you allow such
a thing?"</p>

<p>Henriette had turned her eyes full upon him before she answered.
"I was brought word by Mademoiselle Maillard that his mother wished
him to go out with her. It was not my place to advise the Duchesse,
though I did suggest that with his cough he should not be exposed
to this raw wind."</p>

<p>"Next time you will do more than suggest." His voice had boomed
at her across the book-strewn table. "I have made you responsible
for the children, and there is to be no questioning your
authority."</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur le Duc, if the children's mother&mdash;if the
Duchesse decides otherwise?"</p>

<p>"I will speak to the Duchesse. I will tell her what I have told
you. She is sometimes over-impulsive. Her affections run away with
her sense. A mother's failing, you understand." His last words had
been in the nature of a hurried afterthought.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I understand." Henriette had continued as if the
conversation were of a most matter-of-fact sort&mdash;the next
day's lessons, or a new lamp for the schoolroom. "I will do my best
though my judgment may not always agree with hers, or with
yours."</p>

<p>"The children's health and welfare must come before any
preferences of my own or their mother's. I shall respect such rules
as you may choose to make, mademoiselle. If you feel the need of
advice, send for me, and we will consult together."</p>

<p>Henriette left her pupils at the table and followed him to the
door. "And Mademoiselle Maillard?" She had not meant to mention the
old governess so soon, but there was no help for it.</p>

<p>"It must be made plain that Mademoiselle Maillard is to take her
orders from you from now on."</p>

<p>"I am grateful for your confidence in me, but perhaps you do not
altogether realise that it puts me in a very difficult
position."</p>

<p>"And you are afraid to face difficulty?" His fair brows had
drawn together as his eyes met hers in direct challenge. "I confess
that surprises me."</p>

<p>"I said a difficult position, and I repeat that, monsieur."
Henriette had stood her ground, meeting challenge with challenge.
Too late, she realised that she had unconsciously omitted to
address him by his title. She had spoken to him as a man, rather
than as a member of the nobility. But he had taken no notice
apparently, and she had continued: "I never said that I was afraid.
It would not be true. But you must know that this authority will be
resented."</p>

<p>"By Mademoiselle Maillard?"</p>

<p>He had put the question directly, so she had seen no reason for
veiling her answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, my presence is already resented by her. It could not be
otherwise. I had not meant to speak of this so soon, but I am
balked and hindered at every turn; and the children will suffer in
consequence. No household can survive two governesses, and I should
prefer that you, and the Duchesse chose between us."</p>

<p>"But it is not a matter of choice, mademoiselle. That has been
already made. I only ask your patience for a little while longer. I
ask you simply to go your own way and hear nothing, see nothing and
feel nothing."</p>

<p>"That is not exactly a simple request. When one has eyes and
ears and feelings&mdash;But I will try."</p>

<p>"And I will do the rest. You have my word."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Monsieur le Duc. I will visit Raynald again before
we retire to make sure he is sleeping quietly and well covered.
To-morrow he will be himself again, I hope."</p>

<p>He had given her a grateful smile as he turned back to caress
the smooth dark heads of Isabella and Louise. The door had closed
behind him, and the schoolroom had seemed very empty and quiet
after his going. The clock had ticked loudly, and the fire had made
its hissing accompaniment to the wind that rattled the casements in
the darkness outside. Unconsciously, Henriette and the two girls
had drawn closer together about the table with its green baize
cover and scattered books. The gardenia lay there, too, incredibly
white and glossy-leaved in a pool of lamplight, its fragrance
increased by the warmth till it enveloped them all as if a
languorous cloud of incense were slowly drugging their senses.</p>

<p>"Well, now to the Wars of the Roses again." Henriette had urged
herself and her two pupils back to the interrupted lesson.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Louise, which English king could claim both the white
rose of York and they red rose of Lancaster for his coat of
arms?"</p>

<p>But Louise had yawned, and Isabella's attention had wandered.
The confusing royal houses of England had faded into obscurity
before the glorious reality of Papa in evening dress and gardenias
and hints of the opera.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to the opera, mademoiselle?" Isabella had
broken in.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear." Henriette had not added that it had been only
once and then in a seat under the roof. "But come. We must finish
the lesson for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I can't seem to remember things that happened so long ago and
in England, not France," Isabella had complained.</p>

<p>"When I taught a little English girl your age French history,
she said the same thing," Henriette had answered with a smile. "She
could not believe that anything important ever happened except in
her own country. Now listen, and I will explain it again; and you
will repeat the little verse after me:</p>

<blockquote>"'With this seventh Henry both roses unite,<br>
His own was the red and his wife's was the white.'</blockquote>

<p>"See how easy it is to remember. The King's coat of arms had the
red rose of Lancaster for an emblem, and the Queen's had the white
rose of York."</p>

<p>"Just like Mamma and Papa," Louise had remarked unexpectedly.
"She had a crest of her own before she married him, only his is
better than hers."</p>

<p>"Well, Mamma had the most money," Isabella had hastened to add.
"You know what Maxine and Ren&eacute;e said about the big dowry she
brought him when they were married."</p>

<p>"Hush!" Henriette had difficulty in hiding the interest she
felt. "You must never go about listening to what the servants say
and repeating it."</p>

<p>"But Mademoiselle Deluzy, it must be true. Papa told us once
himself that he could not rebuild the burnt wing at Melun until
after he married. He said Grandfather Praslin couldn't afford to.
It's a lovely place with woods and a little lake with a boat and
swans. We'll be going there any day now. There'll be the bluest
violets you ever saw, but I like Olmeto much the best."</p>

<p>"The better, Louise, just as you would say, 'I like blue better
than red,' when you are comparing two of anything. What do you mean
by Olmeto?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle, don't you know? It's Grandpapa
S&eacute;bastiani's place in Corsica, where Mamma lived when she
was a girl. We go there nearly every August to be by the sea. You
can pick up real coral on the beach and the pinkest&mdash;or is it
the pinker shells?"</p>

<p>Henriette had closed the covers of the book before her. There
was no use, she had told herself, in trying to continue with the
Wars of the Roses when the flush of remembered happy experience had
come to young cheeks, and young voices were so eagerly telling her
of loved places. So she had given her whole attention to their
recital, and when it had ended at half-past nine she had
accumulated a vast number of useful details about life at Melun and
in Corsica and many other bits of information concerning the manner
in which the Duc and Duchesse passed their time in both places.</p>

<p>"Here, mademoiselle, you can have Papa's gardenia." Louise, the
ever impulsive, had pressed the flower into her hand at parting for
the night. "Only be sure to bring it back to the schoolroom
to-morrow. It smells so sweet."</p>

<p>"And don't touch the petals&mdash;because they turn brown if you
do," the methodical Isabella had added.</p>

<p>Henriette had lain awake a long time that night with the
unaccustomed sweetness of the gardenia filling her room. Incredible
that so small a thing should be so subtly disturbing to the chaste
formula of her nights. But there it was, and she could not deny the
response of her senses. It made the lavender sachets in her bureau
drawers and her bottle of Cologne water seem poor and na&iuml;ve by
comparison. Suddenly she knew she had outgrown such simple scents,
even as she had the innocent daisy wreaths of childhood. One might
masquerade in such, but they no longer fitted a woman. Strange to
be made so aware of this change in oneself, and by the fragrance of
a single flower.</p>

<p>She had lain there in the dark wondering what it must be like to
go to the opera with such a man as the Duc; to know that under all
the excitement of footlights and music and such fragrance as this
he sat beside one in a box, and later one would not return alone.
Well, she would probably never know what that was like. One worked
and was thankful for it, she had reminded herself sensibly. One
made much of small blessings; one saved one's money against a rainy
day and old age. In time one grew less sure of one's position; one
faded and became difficult and bitter like Mademoiselle Maillard.
Henriette was not given to indulging in such ruthless reveries, but
that night she had not been able to disassociate herself from the
old governess.</p>

<p>"Have I any reason to expect otherwise?" she had cried in
smothered desperation into her pillow.</p>

<p>Sleep came at last to dry her wet cheeks. She woke renewed, and
the black mood of the night before had fallen from her. The
gardenia stood in a glass on the table, a drooping waxy flower in
its cluster of dark green leaves. Only a stale ghost of its
sweetness remained to haunt her as Henriette took stock of herself
in the oval mirror where no suggestion of Mademoiselle Maillard met
her careful scrutiny.</p>

<h3>Chapter Five</h3>

<p>She entered the schoolroom refreshed and positively reckless
with good will towards the world. It was well that she did so, for
gloom pervaded the east wing. The younger children's nurse, Maxine,
reported that Raynald's cold had turned into chills and fever
during the night; and Berthe, taking advantage of this
complication, had contrived to get herself into her best dress and
then stumbled against the grate and smudged the front breadth with
black. Her small, energetic figure darted about the corridors while
the harassed nursemaid followed hot in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Very well, Maxine." Henriette signalled to the puffing maid to
stop the chase. "Leave Mademoiselle Berthe alone. If she wishes to
go through the day looking like a little pig, we must let her. Go
back to Raynald now, and make him as comfortable as you can. I will
be with you soon."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Maillard has already gone to notify the Duchesse,"
Maxine explained.</p>

<p>"In the future, Maxine, come to me immediately about the
children." Henriette managed to keep the annoyance out of her
voice.</p>

<p>"But we always reported to Mademoiselle Maillard first." The
maid's shoulders were set square and stubborn under her cotton
dress, and her eyes had a look of resentment that Henriette knew
only too well.</p>

<p>"I am speaking of what you will do from now on," Henriette told
her evenly. "There must be no more misunderstandings, so please be
good enough to remember."</p>

<p>She greeted Isabella and Louise and saw them embarked upon
breakfast. Mademoiselle Maillard's place remained conspicuously
empty, and Berthe made no move to take hers. Henriette ignored the
little girl and motioned the sisters to do likewise, knowing that
the high-spirited child would soon tire of a tantrum that won her
no audience. In a week Henriette had learned the best tactics for
dealing with her four charges. She understood Isabella's cautious,
practical mind that responded to quiet reasoning, as she knew that
careless, good-natured Louise could be reached only through an
appeal to her sentiments. Berthe, volatile and shifting of mood as
quicksilver, could be handled by the method of example or outwitted
with tactics as clever as her own, while the sensitive Raynald must
not be confused by too sudden commands, but rather gently persuaded
by appeals to his affection.</p>

<p>She found the little boy flushed and heavy-eyed, protesting
hoarsely that he could not swallow even one spoonful of his morning
chocolate. Henriette took the tray from Maxine and motioned the
maid to set the room to rights while she dealt with the small
invalid.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the chocolate, Raynald," she told him. "Here
is a tangerine, and when I peel it you must guess how many pieces
it has."</p>

<p>"Do you know how many?"</p>

<p>"No, but we'll soon see, and then you can suck the juice." He
watched gravely as she peeled the fruit. She felt the dry heat of
his hand on hers and noted the quick beat of the little pulse in
his delicate neck. "There, let's count: one, two, three, four,
five, six." She spread out the segments for him to see as she
spoke. "Twelve. Try this one first. It's nice and cool. Just let
the juice go down your throat. There, it didn't hurt much, did
it?"</p>

<p>"Not very much." His eyes grew moist with the effort to
swallow.</p>

<p>"Now another," she persuaded gently. "There, you'll have three
down, and then four and then perhaps five."</p>

<p>"My head feels very loose, mademoiselle," he sighed plaintively,
leaning against her between swallows. "You don't think it will fall
off like Berthe's doll that got left out in the rain and all the
sawdust ran out?"</p>

<p>"No, we'll hold it on tight." She brushed back the damp, dark
hair from the moist forehead soothingly. "Besides, Raynald, your
head isn't stuffed with sawdust. Now one more piece of tangerine,
and then half will be gone."</p>

<p>"You eat the other half, mademoiselle, please." His head dropped
against her, and his breath came short and difficult.</p>

<p>To her relief the door opened; but it was the Duchesse, not the
Duc, who entered. Mademoiselle Maillard followed, and Henriette
might have been a piece of the bedroom furniture for all the notice
they paid her. Raynald winced at the sudden violence of his
mother's embrace. He pulled away from the pressure of her arms and
burrowed deeper into the pillows.</p>

<p>"Raynald, my darling," the Duchesse cried, once more straining
him to her. "My poor little boy, you are burning with fever.
Mademoiselle, feel his head and his hands."</p>

<p>The older woman bent over to comply, but the child pushed her
away with all the strength he could muster.</p>

<p>"No, no," he insisted hoarsely, "the other mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Henriette felt a rush of satisfaction at his spontaneous call
for her, but she knew too much to come forward until the Duchesse
gave her permission. She waited quietly at the foot of the bed,
hoping that she might be left alone with the boy and his mother.
But Mademoiselle Maillard had no intention of leaving the
Duchesse's side. Her back had stiffened at Raynald's call for
Mademoiselle Deluzy, though she gave no other sign of having heard
it.</p>

<p>"Why was I not told before?" The Duchesse, still pressing the
boy to her with frantic and undisciplined affection, turned
accusing dark eyes first upon the hovering Maxine and then upon
Mademoiselle Deluzy. "Do you think I would have stirred a step from
this room last night if I had known? He was ill, and you
deliberately kept it from me, his mother."</p>

<p>"I told them he had a bad cough." Maxine hastened to acquit
herself. "I told both mesdemoiselles yesterday morning that they
should keep him indoors; but of course I'm only his nurse. I'm good
enough to dress and undress him and tend him if he wakes; but a
governess has to decide whether he's fit to be out in a freezing
wind, and then you ask me why he's ill to-day. He's always ailing,
the poor little thing. It's a wonder he's lived this long with that
delicate chest of his and the fever he can raise if a summer breeze
blows on him, and you think I'm nothing but a cackling hen when I
tell you."</p>

<p>"Maxine, in heaven's name be quiet." Henriette's voice cut low
and sharp into the nurse's shrill recital. "You will only give
Raynald more fever. Yes, you did tell me about his cough, and I
advised against his going out yesterday."</p>

<p>"You advised every one except his mother, Mademoiselle Deluzy."
The Duchesse turned black and accusing eyes towards the foot of the
bed while the child still struggled to be free of her enveloping
arms. "I have no doubt you and the Duc decided the matter between
you. In this house a mother is the last to be consulted on matters
that concern her children."</p>

<p>Henriette gripped the bedpost with a hand that shook at this
sudden outburst. But her voice was calm and even when she spoke.
"The Duc noticed that Raynald had a cold," she answered, "when he
visited the schoolroom yesterday morning. He came again last night
to ask about him."</p>

<p>A triumphant look passed from Mademoiselle Maillard to the
Duchesse, but the child's high, plaintive wailing made further
discussion impossible. Between his tears and struggles to be free
of frantic embraces, the boy was working himself into a state of
hysteria.</p>

<p>"Go back to the schoolroom." The Duchesse motioned Henriette
away. "The doctor will be here presently."</p>

<p>Raynald's cries grew more frightened at mention of a doctor. She
longed to stay and reassure him as she left the room. A fine state
he would be in when the physician arrived. Poor little fellow, he
was really ill&mdash;no doubt of that.</p>

<p>She settled Isabella and Louise at their geography lessons and
turned to Berthe, whose earlier tantrum had been forgotten except
for tell-talc smudges on her dress.</p>

<p>"Is Raynald very ill, mademoiselle?" she inquired cheerfully
between the sentences she spelled out from an English primer. "Will
he die and have to take nasty medicine?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Berthe, go on with your reading. Raynald probably will
have to take medicine to make him better, but we don't talk about
people dying like that. You've lost your place&mdash;here: 'The two
boys with the kite are running to the garden.' Now you can go
on."</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle, people <i>do</i> die. My white rabbit died,
and I loved it more than the brown one that didn't."</p>

<p>"Do you think we can go to Melun just the same, mademoiselle?"
Louise put in from her place across the schoolroom table. "Papa
said we'd he going next week, but if Raynald is ill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll all be ill," interrupted Isabella.</p>

<p>"What an idea!" Henriette urged them back to the maps they were
copying. "Louise, you've been careless and put North America below
the equator line."</p>

<p>"Oh, America! What does that matter? It's so far off, and only
queer people live there anyway. You wouldn't like to live in
America, would you, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>Henriette smiled at the girl's intolerant shrug.</p>

<p>"Why," she admitted, "I've never given it much thought, but it
might not be as bad as you think. I'm not afraid of new
places."</p>

<p>She turned back to Berthe and the two boys with their kite. An
hour passed during which she tried not to be aware of hurrying
footsteps in the corridor and muffled wailing when the sick-room
door opened and shut. Presently Mademoiselle Maillard appeared
looking glum and important.</p>

<p>"You are wanted"&mdash;she flung the order at Henriette without
further comment&mdash;"in there."</p>

<p>The girls' faces grew sullen as the governesses exchanged
places. Berthe flung down her book and tried to follow. Henriette
turned her about firmly and shut the door. To her surprise the Duc
was pacing the long hall, evidently waiting for her. She was quick
to notice a mixture of concern and annoyance in his face as he
greeted her.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said without preliminaries, "he is a very sick child.
We fear it may be diphtheria."</p>

<p>Another hoarse, hurt cry came from the sick-room. They both
winced involuntarily at the sound.</p>

<p>"The doctor's treatments are painful," he told her, "and Raynald
hasn't learned to be brave. Four is too young to have courage.
Besides, he was badly frightened."</p>

<p>Henriette opened her lips to speak, but he cut her short.</p>

<p>"I know," he hurried on, "it was not your doing; but his mother
was alarmed. She is far from well and easily unstrung. You
understand&mdash;" He broke off and continued his quick pacing
while the cries behind the closed door broke out afresh.</p>

<p>"Certainly." She caught the plea he had flung her. "It is an
ordeal to see a child suffering, and if he is your own&mdash;Well,
I cannot think how that might be."</p>

<p>He thanked her with his eyes, though his words gave no sign that
he had snatched at her sympathy.</p>

<p>"We must send the others away at once," he was going on. "We
cannot run the risk of three more invalids. They will leave for
Melun this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Very well, monsieur. They will be ready. I will see to
that."</p>

<p>"Good." He nodded, but he still stayed by the door as if it were
a comfort to unburden his mind to her.</p>

<p>"The doctor has forbidden the Duchesse to go in there. She is
not strong, so for her sake and the boy's it would be dangerous.
And Raynald must have absolute quiet and skilful care. More scenes
like this morning's might do serious harm. He will need all the
strength he can muster, poor child."</p>

<p>"Raynald has spirit for all his frailness. He's a reasonable
little fellow, too, if he's not frightened or confused." She
hesitated; then the anxiety in his face moved her to go on. "I know
all about diphtheria, monsieur. There was an epidemic at the
convent years ago. I, myself, recovered from it, so there would be
no risk if I stayed in the sick-room. Of course, it's not my place
to suggest, but I should be glad to do anything in my power at such
a time."</p>

<p>"You mean you're offering to stay here with him, Mademoiselle
Deluzy?"</p>

<p>"That's what I meant. I may not be a skilled nurse, but I know
how to keep him quiet and amused."</p>

<p>His face lighted suddenly in a relieved smile.</p>

<p>"That's what he needs most. Maxine and others can do the
nursing, but he's taken a fancy to you. He was calling for you just
now. Still it's sure to be a long siege at best, and at the
worst&mdash;" He broke off.</p>

<p>"We must not think of the worst, monsieur, only of the
best."</p>

<p>His smile answered her&mdash;sudden and grateful. At the same
moment the sick-room door opened on the doctor and his ominous
black bag. Tactfully Henriette stood apart while the two men talked
in low voices. She caught fragments from one or the other as she
waited for permission to go to the child.</p>

<p>"The throat is badly inflamed. Two days ago we might have kept
it from spreading. Now all we can do is continue the treatments
every hour."</p>

<p>"They seem to be very painful from the way he resists them."</p>

<p>"It's important that he should resist as little as possible. We
cannot afford to have the fever rise. Above all things he must not
be frightened as he was this morning."</p>

<p>"You will speak to the Duchesse yourself, doctor? She is very
much upset."</p>

<p>"Naturally. Now as to the child's nourishment: his strength must
be kept up, but he can only take a small amount at a time."</p>

<p>"And if he refuses?"</p>

<p>"He must be made to take food if we are to fight this infection.
I have left instructions with his nurse, but I hardly think she's
the person to take charge of a serious case."</p>

<p>"There will be some one who is equal to it."</p>

<p>Henriette felt the Duc's eyes meet hers in quick appeal. She
came forward at his summons, and presently all her attention was
bent upon following the doctor's directions.</p>

<p>"Yes," she repeated after him. "I understand. The throat must be
swabbed every hour unless he is sleeping. The medicine every two
hours; food as we can persuade him to take it&mdash;milk and
sherry, broth and an egg. He must be kept well covered. And if he
should be taken with chills, what then?"</p>

<p>"I was coining to that." The doctor eyed her with respect as he
continued. "But quiet is the main thing now. These tantrums are too
exhausting. Yes, by all means go in and see if you can distract
him. I will return later this afternoon."</p>

<p>The two men started along the corridor towards the other wing
and the Duchesse's apartments. Henriette reached for the door-knob,
but before she turned it the Duc wheeled about.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy!" He stood beside her again. "You must know
the thanks I feel for what you are doing." He spoke impulsively,
with a naturalness that was altogether disarming. The hand he held
out felt warm as it closed over hers in firm vitality. "When the
Duchesse knows of it she will be grateful, too."</p>

<p>"As to that," she thought, watching him as he rejoined the
doctor in long strides, "we shall see. Her gratefulness strikes me
as rather unpredictable; however&mdash;" She shrugged and lingered
a moment with her hand on the door, remembering the Duc's
spontaneous gesture. He had not snubbed her offer or spoken in the
impersonal tone, reserved for maids and governesses, to which she
had grown accustomed. He had accepted her help as simply as if she
had been a friend coming to his aid. It was pleasant and
stimulating to be treated like an equal. She would prove that his
confidence had not been misplaced. It was grave responsibility, but
responsibility was what she throve on. Already new energy and
resourcefulness flowed through her at the prospect of that small
world beyond the sick-room door&mdash;a world of which she had
suddenly been put in command.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" Raynald's hoarse, fretful tones rose
shrill. She roused herself and stepped across the threshold.
"Mademoiselle!" The child's voice grew less complaining at sight of
her. "Why did you go away? They hurt me&mdash;see."</p>

<p>He pointed to the bandage about his throat.</p>

<p>"Why, now you're wearing a high stock like Papa's." She
pretended to admire the affect. "Bring Raynald a mirror, Maxine, so
he can see for himself how grown-up he looks. He'll be getting a
cane and a tall hat before we know it."</p>

<p>The game worked like magic. Raynald regarded his image with
satisfaction while Henriette propped the pillows at his back and
drew the covers closer about him. He was flushed with fever, and
his eyes looked enormous and far too bright. His lips smiled
faintly now, but she knew they could close in stubborn resistance
at any moment. It was going to take infinite patience and all her
powers of strategy to deal with this intricate bit of human
machinery.</p>

<p>"Now, Raynald"&mdash;she took both his hot, small hands,
noticing as she held them how plainly the blue veins showed under
the delicate skin&mdash;"I'm going to stay here with you, and
Maxine will bring your <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>." His eyes darkened
and his lips opened to begin a protest, but she hurried on.
"<i>D&eacute;jeuner</i> on a tray, the way your Mamma has hers,
with a flower folded in the napkin. Be sure to remember the flower,
Maxine," she cautioned the maid. "That's the most important part,
because Raynald and I will try to guess what it will be while
you're gone. You shall have the first guess, <i>ch&eacute;ri.</i>
What kind of flower do you think we'll find in the napkin?"</p>

<p>"A rose?" Raynald forgot his objections to food in delighted
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But it's early for roses. I guess a lily of the
valley. Now, it's your turn again."</p>

<p>"Those yellow flowers in the garden."</p>

<p>"Daffodils? Oh, but they're all gone. Try another."</p>

<p>"A violet?"</p>

<p>"It might be. They're selling violets in the Bois, and
primroses. Suppose I say a yellow primrose."</p>

<p>"Pink are nicer. I'll say pink."</p>

<p>And so began those days and nights of tireless manoeuvres to
keep a four-year-old boy unaware of his own grave plight.
Henriette's brain and hands had never been so active; and while she
soothed and watched, cut pictures or spun endless tales till her
head ached and her voice grew almost as hoarse as the sick child's,
spring marched through Paris, taking the city's stone and brick by
storm. Beyond the window sills she could feel that heady stir sweep
past like a warm tide mounting into summer. She had never been so
conscious of a season before; so quickened by unseen natural
forces. Because she was shut away from the strong sunshine, she
felt its will to renew all life with power. Her own senses
responded. Even in a darkened sick-room she felt exhilarated as if
a tangible current charged every vein and nerve in her body.</p>

<p>In country places spring was something one saw, a changing
miracle before the eyes. But in the city it was something subtly
felt. It seemed to her that a different quality crept into the
voices of street vendors crying their wares through the morning
hours; a bustle of hopeful activity that vibrated in the beat of
horses' hoofs on those afternoons when smartly fitted carriages
took ladies shopping or for airings in the Bois and
Champs-Elys&eacute;es; an added quickness to the wheels speeding to
dinner and theatre and opera each warm May evening. She came to
know the very rhythm of the city, and yet she was no more a part of
it than if she and her small charge had been marooned at the bottom
of a deep well where pain kept them grim company.</p>

<p>Other people came and went: Maxine and her assistant bringing
fresh linen, food and flowers; the dreaded spectre of the doctor
with his bag which had become for Raynald the symbol of pain and
the signal for tears; the Abb&eacute; Gallard in his black robes;
the Duchesse hovering on the threshold she had been forbidden to
cross, wringing her white hands and weeping ineffectual tears; the
Duc, tiptoeing nearer in his shiny boots, his eyes anxious and his
arms and pockets full of presents that Mademoiselle Deluzy must
unwrap for a child whose hands had grown too weak to hold them.</p>

<p>"See, Raynald," she would hear her own voice trying to distract
both the Duc and her patient. "New soldiers. A whole regiment of
cavalry with a general on a white horse. They're climbing the Alps
where the coverlet's humped over your knees."</p>

<p>Sometimes she could coax the drooping mouth into a smile, and
the Duc would answer with a grateful one as he bent over the bed
and helped encourage the taking of medicine or food.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, we will show you how the eggnog goes down. This
way, <i>ch&eacute;ri,</i> the head tipped far back. Now, as the hen
drinks. Once more. Another swallow. Ah, that was not so good. The
hen forgot to tilt the head. This time it will be better."</p>

<p>She urged the child with praise and playful strategy, but her
eyes and the Duc's would meet in unspoken question and answer above
the boy's head.</p>

<p>Raynald watched for his father's visits and even stretched out
weak hands in welcome. But at sight of his mother he grew restive
and hid his face. If she came while he slept he seemed to be aware
of her disturbing presence. He would toss feverishly or wake and
cry for "Papa" and "Mademoiselle." Henriette came to dread that
dark, uneasy shadow that appeared without warning a dozen times in
a single forenoon. She spoke to the doctor discreetly, but he only
shrugged and raised a professional eyebrow.</p>

<p>"She is his mother," he answered. "It's all I can do to keep her
away from his bed. If I forbid her to look in the room she'll work
herself into another sort of fever, and there'll be two invalids.
I've tended the Duchesse before, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>There came a day when the fever had reached its height, and when
no amount of persuasion could force anything down the inflamed
throat. The doctor looked grave after his morning visit.</p>

<p>"We can do little now but watch and wait," he told Henriette
before he left to report to the parents: "We've done everything in
our power for him, and now we shall see if his strength will carry
him through the crisis. Yes, I expect a change before night, for
better or worse. Keep him quiet and well covered and guard against
draughts of fresh air."</p>

<p>"But, doctor!" Henriette followed him to the door. "He complains
of the dark and closeness. Surely a breath of sun and air would do
no harm if he were not exposed to it directly. He asks about the
garden, and perhaps if he saw it had come into bloom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, have you lost your senses this morning?" The
middle-aged medical man regarded her as if she had spoken treason.
"He is a desperately sick child; a breath of air might be fatal at
this stage."</p>

<p>She said no more, but the staleness of the room seemed even more
oppressive as she turned back to it again.</p>

<p>"Sick or well," she told herself, "we were not meant to
suffocate in this world."</p>

<p>A screen had been placed about the one window where the shutters
were not closed and curtains drawn. Seeing that Maxine was busy
rearranging the sickbed, Henriette seized the chance to draw a few
breaths of fresh air. Cautiously pushing the shutters wider, she
stood in a shaft of May sunshine with the screen between her and
the room. She supposed herself hidden when suddenly a step and a
voice at her elbow made her turn from the green glimpse beyond the
window sill. The Duc stood beside her, and she saw instantly that
the doctor had alarmed him. His face looked drawn, and a mask of
apprehension had settled over the fair, handsome features she was
beginning to know so well.</p>

<p>"Monsieur"&mdash;she no longer addressed him by his full title,
and she spoke as if he had told her what was in his
mind&mdash;"don't be too despairing. Raynald will recover. I can't
help feeling it. He'll be picking daisies a month from now, and all
this will be forgotten."</p>

<p>"You almost make me believe that, Mademoiselle Deluzy"&mdash;he
attempted a smile as he spoke; "but after what the doctor said just
now, and with the crisis coming to-night&mdash;" He could not go
on.</p>

<p>"It must come some time. Let it be to-night. And you forget that
spring is a doctor, too. We cannot resist the spring, monsieur. It
finds us whether we will or no. Can you look out there and deny
it?"</p>

<p>His eyes followed hers to the half-closed shutters, where the
air came up fresh and sunny from the enclosed garden and from the
more distant spaces of the adjoining Champs-Elys&eacute;es. Early
green of young leaves and vines and grass blades filled the narrow
space, and in the midst of the little square court a flowering
almond tree stood up stiff and small, as if it were astonished by
the rosy cloud of its own bloom. Perhaps it was because she had
been unable to sleep except in broken snatches for the last few
nights, and because her eyes had been fixed too long on nearer
things, that Henriette felt stirred by that vista of sun and bloom.
In one of those sudden flashes which all of us experience without
warning, she knew that she would never be able to forget the very
shape and colour of that flowering bush in its grass plot. It took
on a significance all the more keen because she could not explain
why it had moved her.</p>

<p>His voice brought her back to the sick-room.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I should have more confidence in your words
than the doctor's, Mademoiselle Deluzy, and yet I have. You're not
giving me false hope because you have a kind heart?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm too fond of Raynald for that," she told him. "And
governesses are seldom reminded of their hearts. You'll find I've
learned to keep mine well in hand. I meant what I said just now,
only I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off at the sound of choking from the bed. After the
spasm passed Raynald lay back limply among the pillows. His lips
moved so faintly that she had to put her ear beside them to catch
the whisper.</p>

<p>"No, <i>ch&eacute;ri,</i> the doctor thinks not yet. Perhaps, if
you are better to-morrow." She turned to the Duc with a little
futile gesture.</p>

<p>"What is it he wants so much? Can't we manage it somehow?" She
sighed and shook her head.</p>

<p>"It's against the doctor's orders," she explained in low tones.
"Raynald won't believe me when I tell him how green the garden has
grown, and that the almond tree is really in bloom. He begs so to
look out, and if I had my way I'd let him. After all, the sun and
air are good for every other living thing."</p>

<p>They had spoken in low tones, but the child chimed in
plaintively as if he had heard.</p>

<p>"I want to see the spring, Papa. Now, please."</p>

<p>His voice was scarcely more than a tiny thread of sound from the
bed, but it brought his father closer. Concern and pity spread over
the big blond face.</p>

<p>"And you shall see it, Raynald," he promised with sudden
decision. "Wait a moment." Once more he turned to the governess as
if he were asking for reassurance. "You think it cannot hurt
him?"</p>

<p>"It's a very mild day and such a little thing to ask. He'll be
satisfied once he's seen the garden, but I couldn't take the
responsibility alone."</p>

<p>"Well, wrap the quilt close then. Now, Raynald, lie very still
while I lift you. <i>Mon Dieu,</i> but he's no weight at all. I
might be carrying a shadow."</p>

<p>They moved like a pair of conspirators with the child between
them. Neither spoke, and it was only when they reached the window
and the square oasis of green was revealed through the half-opened
shutters that they dared to exchange a look across the dark head
muffled by bedclothes. For a moment Raynald seemed dazzled by the
sudden brightness; then, as if some magnet drew him towards it, he
stretched a hand to the blossoming tree. In that clear shaft of
sunlight he seemed even more fragile. Watching him with solicitous
eyes, Henriette was reminded of those pale shoots brought out of
dark places to be set in pots on window sills and turned first this
way and then that to catch the sun. Gently she took his hand that
was like a bird's claw and held it out to the golden warmth.</p>

<p>At the same instant she and the Duc knew that they were being
watched. The Duchesse was bearing down upon them with hostile eyes
and a defiant rush of satin and lace.</p>

<p>"Theo, are you mad?" Her voice filled the room with frightened
accusations. "Do you want to kill him, mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>Raynald buried his head against his father's shoulder as the Duc
reached the bed once more and laid him on it.</p>

<p>"Hush, Fanny. I'll explain in a moment. Don't speak so loud.
You'll upset him."</p>

<p>"I'll upset him!" the Duchesse's voice vibrated through the
whole room.</p>

<p>Henriette, trying to quiet the boy and get him safely back
between the bedclothes, could feel the tension behind those words.
A tumult of bitterness and jealousy and fright began to gather and
take shape in a storm of protest which the Duc was trying vainly to
quiet.</p>

<p>"Fanny, please, not now, not here!"</p>

<p>"And why not now and here in this room you are all set against
my entering? I have a right to know what goes on here. I'm not
going to be shut out while my child, my little boy, is helpless in
the hands of a stranger."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I can explain. Listen, Fanny! It may have looked
strange to you, but it was a fancy he had to see the garden, and
when Mademoiselle Deluzy told me, I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was Mademoiselle Deluzy's idea. I see. She knows more
than the doctor. What's one child more or less to her so long as
she gets her way in this house? Not a month since she came, and
already a mother is nothing but a nuisance to her, someone to be
swept out like a broken dish. But I won't stand here and see
Raynald harmed before my eyes. The doctor shall hear of this, and
if he dies tonight&mdash;" Her voice rose shrilly before it broke
into wild weeping.</p>

<p>"Fanny, you mustn't say such things. You mustn't blame
mademoiselle. Come, you're ill. You can't stay here now. Maxine,
here, help me get Madame to her room."</p>

<p>His voice which had been soothing at first had grown cold. It
was as if each word he uttered were held taut. Henriette could
almost feel the words straining at some invisible leash. It was
impossible not to listen; not to be humiliated for both husband and
wife.</p>

<p>"My darling!" The Duchesse broke away and reached the other side
of the bed. Henriette saw the large white arms reach out. She saw
that the eyes were dark and tortured, that the tears pouring down
those cheeks were real. This was certainly no feigned anguish. The
Duchesse's full bosom rose and fell with emotion as she strained
the little boy to her in a spasm of despairing affection.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>The child summoned all his strength in that appeal to save him
from the tempestuous embraces. Tears and lamentations enveloped
him. He struggled against them as he might have resisted an
avalanche of honey.</p>

<p>Henriette leaned across the bed to answer his appeal. But as
quickly she restrained the impulse and turned to the Duc with
lifted brows. After all, she must take her cue from him. He met her
eyes without flinching, yet she saw that his mouth had taken on a
grim set. There was a half-shamed appeal in the look which answered
hers. He seemed in that moment to be another Raynald asking her
aid, begging her not to fail him. With a quick gesture he motioned
her away.</p>

<p>"Come, Fanny, no more of this." Firmly he began to disentangle
the Duchesse from her shrinking child. "Come with me."</p>

<p>Henriette busied herself at the bureau. She would not humiliate
him by watching their exit. She had seen and heard enough for one
day. The room grew suddenly quiet again, and she turned to pacify
her patient. He soon lapsed into weary sleep, but she could not rid
herself of the vibrant bitterness of that accusing voice; of the
gleam in those dark, Corsican eyes that had rested on her so
jealously.</p>

<p>"She is half crazy with worry," Henriette tried to reason. "It's
only natural she should want to stay with her sick child, that she
should resent my doing for him. If she were not such a fool with
this undisciplined affection, he would not turn from her as he
does. Poor darling, I can't blame him for that."</p>

<p>She would not own to herself what had been revealed so clearly.
She had felt a clash of temperaments, a suppressed tension, between
husband and wife from her first meeting with them. Something was
wrong there, so seriously wrong that she dared not let herself
think of it. She had a distinct impression that this other woman
was staring at her out of hell; that those great, anguished eyes
distorted whatever they looked upon. Yes, she had been aware that
morning of what she had dimly guessed before. The Duchesse saw
those about her only in relation to the Duc. He was her world, and
she must already be feeling it slip away from her clutching
fingers.</p>

<p>"That woman would be jealous if he caressed a kitten," she
decided. "I believe she would order it killed or sent away, and if
he turned from her to admire a rose, I'm sure she would trample it
underfoot at the first opportunity. God, what must their nights be
like if scenes like this can happen in broad daylight!"</p>

<p>All through the next hours, while she gave orders to Maxine,
while her brain and hands carried out the intricate details with
which she had been entrusted, the unhappy Duchesse continued to
stalk her mind like a violent ghost.</p>

<p>"But there is no reason for her to hate me," she argued
inwardly. "I've done nothing to hurt her."</p>

<p>Yet she knew the answer. She, Henriette, had won a child's
affection and a father's confidence. That was crime enough to stir
the antagonism of an already unhappy woman. The governess had
become a symbol rather than a personality. Yes, she was beginning
to understand the reason for that word most often used to describe
the household Praslin: "Difficult, mademoiselle, very
difficult."</p>

<p>Raynald was all too quiet by late afternoon. He could seldom be
roused from his apathy. That small, weak body scarcely changed the
contour of the smooth bedcovers. He might have been the shrunken
mummy of a child lying there except for the painful breathing and
flushed face. Without protest he allowed the doctor's treatments.
Henriette felt her earlier hopefulness waning as she tried not to
see how the boy's strength had failed since morning.</p>

<p>Towards twilight she was aware of an unusual stir at the door.
Suppressed whispers and hurrying footsteps sounded in the corridor.
It was the time of day when the Abb&eacute; Gallard had been in the
habit of making his visit to the sick child. The appearance of this
black-robed spiritual adviser had come to be her signal to retire.
Having no part in these prayers, she was free to leave the house
and take the air with those who walked the boulevards. So while
they called on Heaven in that darkened room in the east wing,
Henriette's brief contacts with the world took place. Rather
ironical, she had thought, that it should be so, yet she had
welcomed these excursions into life and light. She could not help
feeling that she brought back something of all that to the child on
the bed whether he waked or slept upon her return.</p>

<p>But to-day she had no heart to set foot on the streets and
mingle with unconcerned crowds. She knew even before the
Abb&eacute; stood at the door in his vestments with the young altar
boy he had brought with him, even before she heard Marine's
smothered exclamation and saw her lift reverent hands to cross
herself and then reach for her rosary, that this was no ordinary
visit. The last rites of the church were about to be
administered.</p>

<p>"He is too little to be frightened."</p>

<p>Her first thought was for Raynald who lay staring at the
Abb&eacute; with glazed, apathetic eyes. But she saw that he made
no outcry and seemed hardly aware of the altar being improvised
across the room.</p>

<p>"No," she thought, "he cannot know what it means. Perhaps he
will like to hear the little bell, and think it's some Heaven-sent
toy."</p>

<p>She made her way through the group gathered by the door; the Duc
and Duchesse, the valet and lady's maid, and two other house
servants. They waited with their rosaries in hand. The Duc's blond
head was bent too low for her to see his face as she passed, but
his shoulders had a dejected droop. She knew that he despaired of
his child's life.</p>

<p>Her feet carried her along the corridor and on down the stone
staircase till she came to the door that opened on the garden. She
let herself out into the square of green, which seemed greener
because of the late light and because her eyes were still
accustomed to dimness. Her knees shook as she crossed the
flagstones to a bench by the wall, where a jet of water splashed
from a bronze dolphin's mouth into a shallow pool below. Now that
others had taken the welfare of her charge into their keeping, she
felt lost and lonely. A great weariness and fear possessed her in
place of the earlier energy and confidence that had been hers since
the illness began.</p>

<p>The springing freshness and fragrance of the small garden seemed
suddenly a mockery in the face of what she knew was going on in
that upper room. Overhead the sky showed bright with gathering
sunset. A long flare of rosy light was filling the place with a
false glow that would soon fade. The little almond tree stood its
ground, still flushed with the fever of spring. But the sweetness
of bloom all about her was not strong enough to overcome the
incense drifting down from that window above. The hum of life on
the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; could not quite drown out
the sound of a ringing bell.</p>

<h3>Chapter Six</h3>

<p>The petals of the almond tree were all scattered by the time
Raynald was able to be carried into the garden each sunny noon. His
recovery had been nothing short of a miracle, for which the doctor,
the Abb&eacute;, Maxine and every one who had entered the sick-room
took a share of the credit. Only Mademoiselle Deluzy made no
comment beyond thankfulness that it was so. She had no explanation
to offer as she went about her duties. These continued to be taxing
even with the danger well past, for returning health made the child
a lovable but exacting invalid. He needed constant attendance: he
must be kept amused, but not over-excited. The lively brain must
not outstrip the energy of the frail body wrapped in layers of
eiderdown. Fortunately Henriette possessed limitless ingenuity in
the art of keeping children entertained. Each day her crayons
conjured up new pictures to fit endlessly concocted stories. Sheets
of paper became alive for the child as the scissors moved by her
clever fingers shaped people and animals at his command. There were
new picture-books to be opened and read aloud; a canary as golden
as the cage that held it to be marvelled at; a miniature Punch and
Judy show that mademoiselle could manipulate by concealed strings,
and a wonderful Swiss music box that played six tunes. The precise,
gay notes that flowed from the wooden box lent festivity to the
days. It was as if a world of perpetual spring and childhood and
tinkling laughter were locked there, Henriette thought, as she
listened.</p>

<p>"What does the music keep saying over and over?" Raynald asked
her suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why," Henriette smiled, "I suppose it says something different
to every one who hears it. For me it says: Spring weather, warm
sun, green grass for a little boy to run and skip on."</p>

<p>"And is that little boy me?" Raynald wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Who else but you?"</p>

<p>She bent to kiss the top of his dark silky head. It was
difficult to restrain herself from such demonstrations. She wanted
to feel the response of his small live body. Yet she knew she must
fight off the growing illusion that he was indeed her own child.
This youngest Praslin, so sensitive and appealing in his
dependence, had been her favourite from the first. The two older
sisters she found pleasant and intelligent companions, and Berthe,
with her bounding health, her blonde beauty and spirited ways,
swept all before her with the Duc's own magnetic charm; but Raynald
had crept into a special niche of his own in her affections. The
days and nights of anxious care had settled him there too firmly to
be crowded out.</p>

<p>There had been no more scenes with the Duchesse. Her visits were
less frequent and disquieting. Raynald still shrank from these
contacts with his mother, but Henriette by adroit manoeuvres
usually kept an appearance of dutiful response on the child's
part.</p>

<p>"Doesn't Mamma look fine in her new bonnet and dolman?" she
would point out tactfully at sight of the Duchesse appearing from
an afternoon drive. "You'll give her the hug and kiss you forgot
yesterday, won't you? And be sure to tell her you like the talking
animal book."</p>

<p>"I told Papa so."</p>

<p>"But your Mamma brought it to you. Show her how you pull the
string to make the cow moo. I'll fetch it now from upstairs."</p>

<p>In leisure moments Henriette had had occasion to recall the
violent outburst so unmistakably directed at her that day when
Raynald had been close to death. She still felt embarrassed by such
a display of uncontrolled emotion. She still smarted at the
injustice of the accusations hurled at her head. Disciplined as she
had been since childhood to holding her own feelings in bounds, she
instinctively recoiled from such exhibitions of temper. Children
and fishwives gave way to such furies. But one had the right to
expect dignity and breeding from a woman in the Duchesse's
position. If this cyclone of unreasoning rage had lashed out once
without provocation, Henriette knew there would be repetitions. It
was inevitable, and the prospect was far from reassuring. She could
have coped with the hysteria of a high-strung, pampered woman,
whose overwrought nerves gave way under the strain of her child's
illness; she could have, overlooked words spoken hastily in anxiety
and fear, but she could not forget the venom that had been flung at
her across the sick-bed. She tried to put this from her, yet the
memory laid a chill of restraint upon their meetings.</p>

<p>But in common with most hot-tempered individuals, the Duchesse
had a short memory for her own flare-ups. She could veer like a
weathercock from mood to mood. Suddenly she smiled upon the
governess, overwhelming her with approbation. Henriette could only
marvel at the change, which she found almost as difficult to
understand as the earlier hostility. She had learned to be wary of
too swift intimacy between women, and now she felt more than ever
baffled for explanation. She felt instinctively that the Duc was
responsible for this new affability, though she had no actual proof
that the tension between them had lessened, since they seldom
visited Raynald at the same time.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" She shrugged and tried to dismiss the situation.
"It's no concern of mine. I should be grateful that she looks less
like a thundercloud without bothering my head for the reason."</p>

<p>Still she could not help wondering about those two. By day she
knew little of their comings and goings, but once Raynald had been
settled for the night with Maxine in attendance, Henriette had a
chance to speculate on much that went on in the opposite wing
across the garden. On several occasions she had awakened to hear
voices in argument. She could not distinguish words, but the tones
were certainly those of a man and a woman in anything but complete
accord. Often, too, she noticed that, though lights burned late in
the Duchesse's bed-chamber and in the Duc's private salon, the
small room between, which was hardly more than a passageway
connecting the two apartments, remained conspicuously dark. More
than once she had wakened late or in the early hours of morning to
see clearly silhouetted in the lamplight of a certain window the
Duchesse bent over her secretary, her hand driving a quill pen with
tireless speed. This recurring vision filled Henriette with
curiosity. The Duchesse hardly seemed like a woman to spend her
energies in writing. She appeared more a creature of violent
emotions and of action than one who would weigh words and patiently
set them on paper. She gave little evidence of intellectual
accomplishment. She might, like many another woman before her, have
found relief in writing long, flowery letters. But she seemed to
have few women friends, and being an only child she had no
scattered brothers and sisters with whom to correspond. True, she
had several uncles, and her father, the rich, old Mar&eacute;chal
S&eacute;bastiani, adored her. But he had only recently left Paris
for Corsica. Even if she had written him full accounts of Raynald's
illness these could hardly have occupied her so late and so
long.</p>

<p>She was mystified a morning or two later to find on her tray of
early coffee a small box and a sealed envelope with an embossed
crest and her name in a flowing but immature hand. It bore no stamp
or sign of having come by post or messenger. Wonderingly she broke
the seal, and while her coffee grew cold she read and re-read the
words that sprawled across that pale blue sheet of note-paper:</p>

<blockquote>DEAR MADEMOISELLE DELUZY,&mdash;Sleep is denied to
those who long for peace, and yet feel hostility about them. If in
my anguish and fear for the life of my youngest child I may have
judged you too harshly I ask your indulgence. I would not wish to
wound you for I myself have been too cruelly hurt to inflict like
pain upon another, especially to one living under my own roof. You
are clever, mademoiselle, possessed of unusual attractions and
gifts. It is natural that you should exert yourself to win the
Duc's favour and the children's devotion. But not, I am sure, at
the cost of a mother's right to be first with those to whom she is
bound by the holiest of ties.<br>
<br>
I will say no more. A word to the wise is sufficient. From my heart
I thank you for your ministrations to my little boy when a mother's
care was denied him. From my heart I also earnestly beg your loyal
support and tender this small token of my appreciation. May it be a
pledge of our friendship and future accord.<br>
<br>
FANNY S&Eacute;BASTIANI PRASLIN.</blockquote>

<p>The jeweller's box when opened revealed a modest but charmingly
designed brooch&mdash;a circle of blue enamel whose ends met in a
tiny dragon's head of gold. Henriette held it a long time, turning
it this way and that between her fingers. Certainly the pin was in
exquisite taste, the sort of gift a governess might accept without
being under obligation to the giver, but the dragon's head, like
the carefully veiled words of the letter, seemed chosen with
peculiar significance.</p>

<p>As she dressed, Henriette weighed her response. Twice she went
to her secretary and took out pen and paper, but each time she laid
them away. Why should there be such formality between them, she
reasoned? If the Duchesse had fault to find, or if she honestly
wished to make amends, why had she not sent for her and spoken
directly what she wished to say?</p>

<p>"No," she decided at last as she put the finishing touches to
her morning toilet, "I will not continue this foolish pretence. It
will only make constraint between us when we meet. I will go to her
now before the day's activities begin."</p>

<p>Madame Marguerite Leclerc, the Duchesse's personal maid,
answered her knock a few minutes later. This plain woman of
indeterminate years and dress had weathered every cataclysm in the
Praslin m&eacute;nage, thereby strengthening her position into
something between companion and domestic. Of all those who served
that oddly assorted household, this woman, Henriette guessed, would
be her most dangerous enemy. Stolid she might appear outwardly; yet
there was a firmness of tread, an uncompromising set to the mouth
and a keenness of the eye that Henriette recognised as
authoritative. To-day Henriette's request to speak with the
Duchesse was met with a look of chill disapproval. The maid
followed her into the little salon, where she hovered nearby, busy
with obviously unimportant tasks, while in the bed-chamber beyond
several portmanteaus stood open and waiting to be packed from the
piles of feminine apparel overflowing bed and chairs.</p>

<p>"Ah, good-morning, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>The Duchesse acknowledged her visitor with a perfunctory
greeting. Her dark, lustreless eyes lifted, then dropped once more
to a sheaf of fashion plates strewn about the sofa. It was almost,
Henriette thought, as if a window blind had been lowered between
them.</p>

<p>"Madame"&mdash;as usual the other woman's preoccupation forced
Henriette to make the first advance&mdash;"I hope I am not
intruding upon you so early, but I could not begin my duties
without first coming to express my gratefulness. I was unprepared
for such a gift. It has been happiness enough to see Raynald
convalescing and to feel I had a part in his recovery, but I won't
deny that this proof of your good will has overwhelmed me." She
laid her hand on the enamel pin which fastened the white collar of
her printed challis dress.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the brooch." The Duchesse spoke absently. "A small
souvenir. I am glad if it pleases you." Her voice trailed away,
muted and uncertain, almost as if she had not heard the words to
which she responded. Henriette had a sudden conviction that this
woman, perversely enough, would write in cold black and white what
she should better have left unsaid; that she would keep silence
when she should make an effort to speak.</p>

<p>Once more a silence fell between them and once more it was
necessary for Henriette, to take the initiative.</p>

<p>"I see by these signs of packing," she began, "that you are
planning to leave Paris shortly."</p>

<p>"For Melun, yes," the Duchesse assented. "You will follow with
Raynald as soon as the doctor thinks he is able to travel. We leave
this afternoon, the Duc and I."</p>

<p>Only when she spoke that last phrase, "the Duc and I," did
animation creep into the dull voice. She lingered over it
caressingly, with na&iuml;ve emphasis which in a lovelorn girl
might have been overlooked, but which in a mature, married woman
sounded unpleasantly possessive.</p>

<p>"She gives herself away whenever she speaks of him," the younger
woman thought, studying the pale, broad face with its discontented
mouth and unhappy eyes. "Her very protests would make me guess he
preferred to stay here. She's a fool with her affections, but she's
desperately miserable in spite of all she has."</p>

<p>"I must not keep you long from your preparations for the
journey," Henriette continued, casting a pointed look at the maid
who still hovered in the background. "If you could spare me a few
minutes&mdash;alone, I should be grateful."</p>

<p>At a sign from her mistress Marguerite Leclerc reluctantly took
herself into the bed-chamber. In the silence that followed they
could hear her heavy tread and the thumping of valises. Still the
Duchesse waited, her hands knotting and unknotting the sash of her
robe. Henriette watched those plump hands twisting the length of
rich satin which she could not help knowing must have cost more
than any one of the dresses in her own simple wardrobe. She had to
look away to keep back a wave of resentment at those careless, idle
hands which fumbled aimlessly instead of holding fast to all that
fate had placed in them.</p>

<p>"Madame," she went on, summoning all her powers of tactful
persuasion, "I was touched that you should have written me as you
did. Believe me, I want harmony above all things. I am eager to
carry out your wishes for the children, for Reynald in particular,
and I beg you to speak frankly. If I have fallen short of my duties
in any way I will do my best to remedy the fault."</p>

<p>"I did not say you had fallen short of your duties,
mademoiselle. On the contrary, you have been altogether too eager
in your efforts."</p>

<p>"I had no intention of overstepping my position. I am sorry if I
have. Perhaps if you would be more definite I should know how to
conduct myself better in the future."</p>

<p>"The future&mdash;ah&mdash;who knows?" The Duchesse gave one of
her deep, habitual sighs and lifted her heavy lids wearily as if
Heaven alone could answer for that.</p>

<p>"I have tried to follow the Duc's directions," Henriette
persisted without letting her annoyance at this ineffectual
response become apparent. "And I should like to follow yours too,
Madame, if you will give me any. The Duc has seemed pleased with
the children's progress and behaviour. At least he has made no
criticism."</p>

<p>"I never interfere with the Duc's plans for the children. Their
instruction is entirely in his hands."</p>

<p>Another deep sigh made the silken folds rise and fall on the
broad bosom.</p>

<p>"But, Madame, it should be possible to please you both. A
governess has no place in a household where she does not feel the
confidence of both parents. In this one month I have grown attached
to your children, and Raynald's illness has made him especially
dear to me. Perhaps in my anxiety for him I have offended in some
way, but you must believe me when I repeat that it was
unintentional, that I only meant to spare you such strain as I
could and follow the doctor's orders."</p>

<p>"It was not the doctor's order that you and the Duc should
expose a sick child to an open window and draughts of cold air.
But, no matter, by a miracle he survived, and according to your own
notions you have tended him faithfully. We will say no more about
it."</p>

<p>"But I still feel your disapproval, Madame, and I still want to
carry out your wishes if you will give them to me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, mademoiselle, I can only repeat what any mother has
a right to wish and expect&mdash;that she should come first with
her children. Nothing must come between me and my sons' and
daughters' affections&mdash;nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naturally." Henriette spoke impersonally and disregarded the
pointed dart behind those words. "But children grow and reach out
to others each year. A mother cannot keep them for ever babies at
her breast. Your children are intelligent and high-spirited. They
respond to affection, but sometimes, if one demands it of them,
they are like skittish colts scurrying away at the first sign of a
bit&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, for it was evident that the other was no longer
listening. Her attention had turned from the children to the
adjoining apartment, from which a sound had come. The distant rasp
of an opening window casement had interrupted their conversation
just as it was reaching a climax. Watching this woman before her,
seeing the dark head tilt furtively in the direction of that sound
and sudden excitement begin to show in every feature, Henriette
knew it would always be like this. All reality for Fanny, Duchesse
de Praslin, was centred in the magnet of her husband's physical
presence.</p>

<p>"No," she thought, still standing there beside the couch,
forgotten by the woman stretched upon it, "she does not dislike me
for myself. The children and I do not matter to her. We only exist
if he notices us."</p>

<p>The interview was over, and she felt more baffled than before it
had begun. Plainly the Duchesse was straining to hear further
sounds from the other side of the wall. Her whole mind and body
waited expectantly for his coming, and there was no use in
continuing the subject that had brought Henriette to the small
salon.</p>

<p>"Well, Madame, I can only say again that I thank you for your
gift, and that I hope you will trust me and let me know your
wishes. Meantime be happy in the reunion with your daughters and
know that Raynald will be well cared for till you send for us."</p>

<p>When the door closed behind her Henriette sighed. Nothing had
been accomplished. She felt that her gesture and words had made no
more impression than if she had pounded futile on a feather
mattress. But at least there had been no more specific accusations.
She would go her way without further attempts to untangle this
subtle feud in which she somehow found herself drawn against her
will.</p>

<p>"Where is her pride?" she thought. "If I had such a husband and
such children, all this as well&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shrugged expressively and started back along the corridor,
determined to put the whole bewildering business from her mind.
After all, those two were man and wife, and she was their
children's governess. Let it be so, and forget implications that
should not concern tier. She would no longer try to solve this
Chinese puzzle of human emotions that was far more intricate than
she had imagined. Better use all her wits to steer a straight and
steady course through unpredictable currents and rough waters that
might be ahead. Instinctively she gathered her skirts about her and
hurried on.</p>

<p>But passing the Duc's quarters she stopped short, her eyes
caught by what lay almost at her feet. A letter had been thrust
under the doorsill in such a way that one corner showed against the
carpet. Even in the dimness something about that fragment struck
her as familiar. She bent down and recognised the same texture and
peculiar shade of blue notepaper that had lain on her own morning
tray.</p>

<p>Somehow she could not forget that corner of envelope. It would
creep between her and the pages of the stories she read to Raynald.
She saw it so clearly before her that when the Duc strolled in
after <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> she half expected to see a triangle of
pale blue showing from one of his pockets.</p>

<p>She searched his face for some sign that he knew of her visit to
the Duchesse. But if his wife had given him her version of what had
taken place in her salon he gave no hint of it in look or manner.
He had never appeared in better spirits, nor looked more striking
and carefree than in the mulberry coat and dove-grey trousers that
set off his strength and height and fairness.</p>

<p>Raynald, now up and about each afternoon, was at first
disconsolate at the news of the departure for Melun without him.
But between them Henriette and his father cleverly distracted the
child. Henriette reminded him that if he should leave that
afternoon he would have to miss a visit to the Guignol, and his
father assured him that the new duck-pond at Melun would not be
ready for another week at least. As a final gesture of farewell the
Duc carried the small boy on his shoulders up to his own
apartments.</p>

<p>"I'll send him back in half an hour," he promised. "He can sit
in my big chair and amuse himself while the bags are being
strapped, and watch us leave in the carriage."</p>

<p>Henriette heard the bustle of departure as she waited for the
child's return. She was relieved to be spared his mother's
farewells, and she only hoped that her charge had endured them
gracefully. When he was carried back by the porter the little boy's
eyes were bright with importance, and he bent intently over a pair
of scissors with which he snipped diligently at a piece of
paper.</p>

<p>"Papa let me have them," he explained. "They're not sharp like
yours, mademoiselle, and I'm making something for you."</p>

<p>"A present? Dear me! I wonder if I can tell across the room what
it's going to be."</p>

<p>He held up the cutting for her to guess.</p>

<p>"Why, I do believe it's going to be a heart. Is that right?" He
nodded, satisfied, and went on with his snipping.</p>

<p>"What made you choose a heart?" she persisted, watching the
pucker deepening in his soft brows as the effort neared
completion.</p>

<p>"Because," he told her gravely, "a heart is the easiest of all
things to cut."</p>

<p>"Ah," she thought, "what words from a child! He doesn't know
what he's saying, but he's right. Hearts are the easiest of all
things to cut."</p>

<p>The gift was finished at last and presented with much admiration
on both sides. But as Henriette smoothed the folds of the lopsided
and rather ragged object she was startled once more at sight of
familiar blue note paper. Turning it over, she was even more
startled to see fragments of writing on the other side. Words
leaped at her, the more vivid and painful because a child's
unconscious fingers had separated them from each other. They seemed
alive there in her hands. Tortured, inky things it was impossible
not to read and, once having read, impossible to forget:</p>

<pre>
  My Darl     only a wall
 separates     yet a worl
    lies be     I have cried
   not sleep  Oh, if I had
known that    all that once we
  and shared.   How can I
</pre>

<p>With shaking hands she folded and laid the heart away in her
workbox before she turned once more to the child.</p>

<p>"Raynald"&mdash;she lifted him to her lap and tried to speak
casually&mdash;"you did not go rummaging in Mamma's secretary to
find the paper for my present, did you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mademoiselle. Papa told me I could have anything from
his waste basket, and this was the prettiest colour I could
find."</p>

<h3>Chapter Seven</h3>

<p>"Mademoiselle Henriette has returned!" Pierre the porter stood
bowing and beaming beside the shiny carriage drawn up before the
entrance of Madame Le Maire's. "She went away on foot, and she
returns by coach. It's like a fairy tale." The old man blinked at
the small crest painted on the door and at the woman who sat on the
cushions, familiar of face, yet so elegant in green shot silk and
bonnet and veil. "Oh, yes!" he went on, bowing his stiff body in
the patched porter's coat. "The sun dances for mademoiselle. Didn't
I predict it? Didn't I say always you were born under a fortunate
star?"</p>

<p>Henriette hoped the pawings of the horse drowned out his words.
She had no wish for the driver or his liveried mate who held the
spirited animals' heads to overhear them. Old Pierre's pride in her
was very touching, but he might go too far in his delight at the
outward change in her appearance. After all, there was no need for
the Praslin servants to know how poor and shabby she had been two
months ago.</p>

<p>They resented her enough as it was, especially since she had
been left in full charge of Raynald and the household at Number 55,
Rue du Fauborg-Saint-Honor&eacute;. She was wise enough to take no
notice of the grudging responses and sullen looks that followed her
orders, but she knew well enough that feeling ran high against her
in the servants' wing.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Pierre. Yes, I'm very well and happy. The Duc and
Duchesse have gone to the country, but young Master Raynald here
has been ordered to drive each pleasant afternoon and I accompany
him. I sent a note by messenger to ask Madame to come with us for a
little turn to-day. Tell her we're waiting, please."</p>

<p>When the porter had hobbled off with her invitation, Henriette
leaned back against the cushions and stared about her at the dreary
familiarity of the street. The strong sunshine only made the houses
seem more dingy than she remembered. A blind was missing here, a
shade askew there, dead stalks showed in a forgotten window box,
and water stains from leaky gutters scarred the walls.</p>

<p>"How was it possible for me to be hopeful or happy even for an
hour here?" she asked herself, staring up to find the little peaked
window of the "Needle's Eye" through which she had peered so often.
There it was, the casement open and a tattered bit of curtain
blowing out like a signal from the past.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle"&mdash;the child's clear voice broke into her
memories&mdash;"I don't like this street. Why are the houses all
grey and sad-looking?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps because they're very old, Raynald. Perhaps because the
people who live in them are poor and not very happy."</p>

<p>"Then let's not stay here," he decided quickly. "Let's go to the
Bois or the Luxembourg Gardens."</p>

<p>She reassured him. They would only stay till a lady came out to
drive with them. The lady was an old friend of mademoiselle's. She
might look a little queer to him, but he must be polite and not
seem to notice that her hair was two different colours, or that her
face was full of lines and her clothes not like Mamma's or
mademoiselle's. He must say <i>"Bon jour"</i> and make his bow and
let her sit in the best place because this lady did not often go to
ride in a carriage behind two such lively horses.</p>

<p>Madame Le Maire emerged at last in her best beaded black, her
bonnet well anchored and her sallow cheeks decorated with two round
spots of rouge. The footman held open the door, his face impassive,
his shoulders eloquently scornful. Raynald went through his formula
and reluctantly yielded the outside seat. The horses clattered over
the cobblestones to the admiration of old Pierre and other
astonished eyes pressed to window panes.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" the older woman breathed as the carriage swung
into broader and smoother lengths of street. "This is a pleasant
surprise, my dear Mademoiselle Desportes. Pardon, I forgot you
prefer this other foolish-sounding name which I'll never be able to
get out easily. I thought you'd forgotten all about us in the Rue
du Harlay!"</p>

<p>Henriette was full of explanations, though she spoke guardedly
because of the child between them. Perhaps it would have been wiser
to stay away from her old haunts, but she had not been able to
resist the temptation to visit them while the Praslin horses and
carriages and liveried attendants were at her disposal, and before
her new costume had lost any of its crispness. She had needed to
see the admiration in old Pierre's eyes and the shrewd appraisal as
Madame Le Maire looked her over from the new bonnet with its green
feather curling against the chestnut waves of her hair to the trim
kid slippers that rested on the foot cushion. She craved such
reassurance. After all, one might as well have stayed poor and
shabby, if there were none to notice one's rise to better things.
How expect an actress to play to empty benches?</p>

<p>For more than a week now she had presided over Number 55, Rue du
Fauborg-Saint-Honor&eacute;. The servants might scowl and protest
behind her back, but they dared not openly rebel. The Duc had left
orders that Mademoiselle Deluzy was to be in full charge. One could
afford to disregard slights and black looks when one held the
whiphand as she did. Yet she was also careful not to overstep her
privileges by making too personal demands. That would be a fatal
error at this time. So she continued to devote herself to her small
charge, not only because he had grown dear to her, but because
there must be no possible chance of any laxness being reported
through the elaborate system of domestic espionage which existed in
such establishments.</p>

<p>The departure of the Duchesse had removed, as it were, the
proverbial pebble from Henriette's shoe. It no longer nagged her at
every step. Now she could move freely without feeling that violent,
tortured presence always at her side. The very air of the place
lifted, as if cleared of the sultriness that precedes thunder.
Perhaps, she tried to reassure herself, her own fatigue had
exaggerated the other woman's outbursts. Certainly it had been no
time to judge her. No doubt when they met again in the quiet of the
country with all the children well and romping through a summer
holiday, it would be otherwise. She could have made herself believe
it except for those broken, desperately penned words on a scrap of
blue paper.</p>

<p><i>"Au revoir,</i> Madame Le Maire," she said an hour later as
they turned into the Rue du Harlay again. "I am glad you could take
the air with us. Any day now we may start for Melun."</p>

<p>As Madame allowed herself to be helped out, a thin young mart
with an armful of books stopped to peer at the unusual sight of
such a handsome carriage. Henriette smiled in recognition and
reached out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Remey, have you forgotten me?"</p>

<p>She was pleased by his admiring, incredulous acknowledgment as
he stammered his greeting:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Henriette, I hardly know you. No, it's not just
this&mdash;" He waved his free hand towards the horses and footman.
"It's you yourself. No need to ask how it goes with you these
days."</p>

<p>"And I hope it goes well with you, too."</p>

<p>"I'm still on foot, you see." He looked rather ruefully at his
scuffed shoes and tried to hide the frayed cuffs that showed at his
wrists. "But I'm very happy. Perhaps Madame has told you of my good
fortune? My thesis is to be published, and Marie Aubert and I are
betrothed." His eyes grew softly sentimental as he spoke the name
of his beloved. "We're to be married in August."</p>

<p>"Like a pair of foolish sparrows," Madame Le Maire broke in,
taking the arm the young man offered her. "Two can live as cheaply
as one. I know how it is now, and how the tune can change." She
shook her head and sighed.</p>

<p>"I remember Marie&mdash;a sweet girl," Henriette told him, "and
I offer you both my congratulations. You will live in Paris?"</p>

<p>"Where else?" Lines of worry deepened between Monsieur Remey's
eyes. Even happiness could not quite hide the anxiety that seldom
left his serious, student's face. "I must continue my research if
I'm ever to be appointed to a professorship. Meantime I pick up a
pupil or two as I can find them. Marie may not bring us a dowry,
but she makes wonderful soup!"</p>

<p>"Without bones or carrots or onions, I suppose," Madame Le Maire
teased. "If she can make nourishing soup out of love and a kettle
of water, she'll be a miracle worker."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Desportes, I'm not one to ask favours, but&mdash;"
Young Monsieur Remey lingered by the carriage, though the driver
showed plainly that he agreed with the horses' impatience to be
off. "Now that you've gone so far and move in a circle of such
wealth and influence, perhaps you'd be good enough to help us. If
you should hear of a pupil and if you could recommend me as tutor,
it would mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>The horses were too restless to be held any longer. His words
were lost in a clatter of hoofs and wheels as the carriage moved
away. But Henriette caught the appeal in his hesitant words. She
turned and nodded and waved an encouraging farewell. Poor,
impractical Monsieur Remey in his skimpy clothes and that bundle of
books that had worn his coat threadbare where they pressed his arms
and side! He had dared to love and to be happy with only the
prospect of a couple of rooms up many flights and a girl as shabby
as he who knew how to make good soup. Yet she found herself envying
those two. That radiance behind his near-sighted eyes had been
genuine. She could not forget the way they had shone when he spoke
of his good fortune. Somehow the shot-silk folds of her new dress
as she smoothed them seemed a poor substitute. Perhaps she might be
able to find him a pupil, though why she should trouble about a
struggling student and his bride she didn't know. Still, the glow
of gathering sunset above the river kept reminding her of the
warmth that had taken his face in those few moments. She had a
distinct inner conviction that young Monsieur Remey and his bride
and she must join hands to keep themselves from slipping into the
insecurity that awaits to engulf the eager and the intelligent.</p>

<p>"Why did that man carry such heavy books, mademoiselle?" Raynald
was asking. "And what makes him wear such queer clothes?"</p>

<p>"He's a student, <i>cheri</i>," she heard herself responding,
"and students are too busy reading big armfuls of books to notice
what they wear or what they eat."</p>

<p>"I'm never going to be a student. Do you think I can have cake
for supper?"</p>

<p>The afternoon drive and her reunion with two old friends did not
lift Henriette's spirit as she had expected. It was all very well
to play Lady Bountiful, but once the glow of that faded she felt
lonely and restless. With Raynald settled in bed and her duties
done, the evening stretched before her as empty as the corridors
and rooms through which she passed. Alone in this beautiful house,
she had the distinct sensation of rattling like a dried seed in a
gourd.</p>

<p>Though she spread out her portfolio under the shaded lamp on the
schoolroom table and dipped her pen resolutely to continue the
letter she had already begun to Nina Hislop in England, she could
not fix her mind to summon words. The ink dried on the quill tip
while she sat staring beyond the lamplight towards the dimness of
the open windows above the garden. Down there late lilacs were
blooming, giving out a fragrance she did not trust herself to smell
at nearer range.</p>

<p>"Fool!" She shook herself firmly and set pen to paper. "What
more do you want?"</p>

<p>But she knew, even while she wrote careful and mildly
instructive descriptions of a drive in the Bois and an afternoon at
the Louvre for her late pupil's benefit, she knew in her heart that
one was not meant to be sitting alone on a May evening like this.
What good was it to know that lilacs were in bloom and everywhere
people strolling together, two by two?</p>

<p>The letter was finished. She shut the portfolio and consulted
the clock on the mantelpiece. Ten minutes to nine&mdash;for Paris
the evening had scarcely begun; for her it might as well be over.
This curse of aloneness: what had she done to deserve it?</p>

<p>Among the school books on the shelves was a small green volume
of English verse, and without knowing why, she singled it from the
rest. Idly she turned the pages, only half aware of the neat rhymes
that met her eyes. Polite, well ordered lyrics, they were, for the
most part, innocuous garlands of chiming words: love and dove;
care, despair and lady fair; flower and bower. Then, suddenly,
words started into life before her eyes. They were no longer gentle
and ladylike with the suggestion of clinking cups and spoons about
a sedate tea table. They challenged her.</p>

<blockquote>How should I your true love know<br>
From another one?<br>
By his cockle hat and staff,<br>
And his sandal shoon.<br>
<br>
He is dead and gone, lady,<br>
He is dead and gone;<br>
At his head a grass-green turf,<br>
At his heels a stone.</blockquote>

<p>She read no further, but her heart beat unaccountably as she
thrust the book back into place, and a faint chill crept along her
spine. She could not say why they should affect her so
strangely.</p>

<blockquote>He is dead and gone, lady,<br>
He is dead and gone...</blockquote>

<p>Some time she would know the reason why they stirred her like
this, though as yet they were but a fleeting shadow of some shape
she did not know.</p>

<p>Once more she shrugged free of presentiment and crossed the room
to a square piano which had been closed since the older girl's
departure. Her fingers stole over the black and white keys as she
tried to recall the notes of a waltz she had mastered years before
with much pains. As she played the melody came back to her, though
she fumbled over the deeper chords.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>So absorbed had she been that she had not heard hurrying feet
and voices in the corridor. She looked up to see a tall man's
figure standing in the schoolroom door and an eager and dishevelled
young girl hurrying towards her with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"Louise!" She returned her pupil's embrace. "What brings you
back so late? Monsieur, this is a happy surprise. I hope all is
well?"</p>

<p>In a moment the atmosphere of the schoolroom was charged with
life. Voices met and mingled in a quick exchange of greetings; the
lamp laid a charmed, mellow circle over the three who drew together
in its light. A servant hurried in with a hastily prepared tray of
food&mdash;cold meat and salad and rolls; milk for Louise and a
decanter of wine for the Duc.</p>

<p>Henriette listened to the explanations and made occasional
replies to questions, but all the time her eyes were on the
decanter with its glowing contents and the well-shaped hands that
carefully filled two glasses. She was struck by their strength and
pallor in marked contrast to the rich red of the wine. A drop fell
from the lip of the bottle and lay like a splash of blood on the
white skin. He brushed it away with his handkerchief and leaned
across the table.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy, you will not refuse a sip of port? It is
not good to drink alone."</p>

<p>She accepted the glass with a smile. His face took on a new look
in the lamplight enveloping them both. The hair on his forehead
shone like gilt. His eyes were more green than hazel under their
thick lashes. She could not help hoping that the artificial light
was as becoming to her. She thought it must be because his eyes
lingered on the ringlets at either cheek.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Duchesse is greatly improved by the country," she
heard him answering a question she must have asked. "She is busy
devoting herself to the poor of the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"I have heard she is much beloved for her good deeds. Louise,
<i>ch&eacute;re,</i> what is the matter with your cheek? Why is it
so swollen?"</p>

<p>Presently Henriette was hearing all about the painful tooth that
would not stop aching and how Papa had decided to bring her back to
Paris where he had business to conduct to-morrow.</p>

<p>"You're to take me to the dentist, mademoiselle," Louise
explained, "and if it has to be pulled and I'm very brave, Papa has
promised a surprise. We planned it coming on the train from
Corbeil. You'll never guess what it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If she guesses, it won't be a surprise, Louise," the Duc
reminded his impetuous daughter.</p>

<p>"But the surprise has nothing to do with me," Henriette
protested. "It's not <i>my</i> tooth that aches."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's going to be for you, too, mademoiselle. We'll
wear <i>our</i> best clothes and sit in a box and not go to bed
till midnight. Now can't you guess?"</p>

<p>The Duc gave an amused shrug and raised his blond eyebrows as he
lighted a cigar. He regarded Louise fondly while he changed the
subject to Raynald and the affairs of the household. Henriette's
reports were clear and impersonal. He listened attentively and
nodded his satisfaction through the blue smoke that lent such an
air of masculine worldliness to the ordered schoolroom.</p>

<p>"I am well pleased, Mademoiselle Deluzy," he remarked as he rose
to go to his own apartment. "Your management here in my absence has
been excellent. We'll all be returning to Melun in a few days, and
it may interest you to know that Mademoiselle Maillard will be
leaving in August."</p>

<p>She had only time to answer with a relieved smile before he was
gone.</p>

<p>"Mamma didn't want Mademoiselle Maillard to go," Louise
confided. "She cried about it, but we didn't. We're glad she's
going away, and Berthe even told her so to her face. Mademoiselle,
the surprise was Papa's idea because he remembered you'd never been
to see Rachel!"</p>

<p>Always she was to connect the great actress with the smell of
violets from a bunch in her own lap. A flower seller had thrust his
tray into the carriage as they drew up by the lighted entrance to
the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, and the Duc had tossed
the fellow a coin. One bunch for mademoiselle and one for an
excited and wide-eyed Louise. It was a casual gesture, and the
violets were already withering in their own sweetness, but those
two purple nosegays somehow became the symbol of that evening of
unforgettable enchantment. Louise moved between the Duc and
Henriette, her cheeks so flushed that the swelling from her
abscessed tooth was scarcely noticeable. She walked on tiptoe in
young rapture; her hair fell in shining blackness upon her
shoulders, and the soft yellow of the dress selected for so great
an occasion brought out her best points. She was still a child, but
hints of the dusky, mature beauty which was to be hers were
apparent.</p>

<p>"She's like a young leaf dancing in its own shadow," Henriette
thought; and she shivered suddenly, thinking of that creeping
shadow of age, which lengthens for every living creature year by
year.</p>

<p>But she could not give herself long to such thoughts, for
Louise's animation was contagious. Even the Duc, seasoned
theatre-goer that he was, responded to the expectant mood of the
guests beside him in the gilded box. Henriette saw him glance with
approval at her costume as he helped her lay aside her wrap. It was
her old dolman, but the green silk of her dress was becoming even
though its lines were not <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>. She
regretted that her white throat and shoulders must be hidden, yet
it was some satisfaction to know that the fit of the bodice was
faultless, and that the soft green made her skin appear more
dazzling and brought out the rich lights in her hair.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that <i>Judith</i> is hardly the most appropriate
play for Louise's introduction to the theatre." Her host leaned
towards her to lay a programme on her lap. "But I had no choice.
This is Rachel's last performance before leaving for England."</p>

<p>"I doubt if Louise will be shocked," she reassured him
"Innocence, you know, is its own guard. I believe we find whatever
we are looking for in books or plays, monsieur&mdash;or in life,
for the matter of that."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;he smiled and shrugged his broad
shoulders&mdash;"perhaps you're right. At all events you'll have to
answer any embarrassing questions Louise may ask to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Papa," the girl broke in, "I want to look through your opera
glasses at some people because they're staring at us through
theirs."</p>

<p>Henriette followed Louise's glance to one of the side boxes,
where four people had just been seated. A dowager and a younger
woman were settling themselves on the gilt chairs, while two men
levelled opera glasses upon the Duc and his party. He met their
stare, bowed stiffly, and turned to devote all his attention to his
daughter.</p>

<p>Lights were being lowered all over the packed house. The gas
jets that edged the stage flared into magnificence. The curtain
became a burnished wall of light while violins and cellos soared
and swelled and were suddenly silent. Then hushed whispers and
sighs of expectancy ran like little waves from row to waiting
row.</p>

<p>Henriette drew a deep breath and leaned forward in her seat. She
felt, as always on the few occasions she had attended the theatre,
almost suffocated with anticipation. Though she continued to feel
the chair on which she sat, and though she was aware of the
programme and violets in her lap and of the dim shapes of the man
and girl beside her, something in her was carried out and beyond
the great audience till she and the rising curtain became one.
Completely severed from her ordinary self, in that moment she knew
ecstasy and release.</p>

<p>So the curtain rose on the painted tents of Holofernes' camp.
Drums rolled, and bugles shrilled. Figures edged with light moved
and spoke stirring words; the very boards of the stage seemed
waiting with all that breathless houseful of people for the
greatest trag&eacute;dienne of her day to appear. She came swiftly,
more like a wind than a woman. Soft draperies wrapped her light,
almost childish frame as she stood there motionless, holding a
thousand people in the hollow of one thin outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very good," Henriette was to say many times in praise
of this or that actress in years to come. "A beautiful performance;
but, of course, if one has ever seen Rachel&mdash;"</p>

<p>She never tried to finish that comment. Impossible to find words
to describe the power of leashed lightning; for the darkly curved
wonder of a wave in the moment of breaking; for the flare of a
comet in winter skies. How tell of the vibrancy of that voice,
clear as ice and rich as warm honey?</p>

<p>Watching this frail Jewess of barely twenty years, with her
pale, oval face and compelling eyes, hearing that unforgettable
voice that could chill or rouse or ensnare the listener at will,
Henriette knew that the age of miracles had not passed. She herself
was witness to one.</p>

<p>It mattered not at all that this woman on the lighted stage was
notorious from one end of France to the other for her excesses;
that her illicit love affairs were more often tawdry than
magnificent. Born in cheapness and squalor, she would never be
quite free of that heritage. But even as a ragged child, begging
and singing at the doors of saloons and brothels, greatness had
claimed her for its own. She had only to lift her dark, proud head,
to point one quivering finger, to let words pour out in fiery
torrents from her parted lips, and the dream of ancient alchemists
became real&mdash;the baser metal turned to purest gold.</p>

<p>When the curtain fell for the first intermission and the house
burst into a storm of clapping hands and echoing bravos, Henriette
sat quiet. One did not hail a rising sun with applause or cry bravo
to some blazing meteor.</p>

<p>"Well, Mademoiselle Deluzy"&mdash;the Duc's voice brought her
back to reality&mdash;"does the great Rachel measure up to your
expectations?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" She shook herself slightly, as if she were with difficulty
accustoming her lungs to breathing different air. "Oh, monsieur,
what is there left to say?"</p>

<p>He seemed pleased by her response as he turned to answer some
question of the flushed and exuberant Louise.</p>

<p>"Yes." He rose with a smile to take a brief promenade. "I must
admit she's a great actress. I know it when I can see how she makes
Louise look like a woman and you like a child in your
eagerness."</p>

<p>Henriette scarcely knew when he returned to their box, for the
curtain had risen again and she had given herself wholeheartedly to
the unfolding drama. Holofernes was in the sensuous toils of his
love for the spying enchantress, and Rachel moving with the
desperate grace of a panther to the scene of his beheading, Judith
had triumphed. Her wiles had overcome the enemy of her people, and
the severed head of the general was being borne aloft in her hands.
Horror and passion and untamed beauty reached out across the
footlights to a breathless audience. And then it was over. The pale
heroine of the Apocrypha was gone, and in her place a rather worn
young Jewess was being led before the curtain to acknowledge the
applause. Flowers rained about her from above and below the
stage.</p>

<p>"Mine, Papa, mine!" Louise thrust her violets into the Duc's
hand.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated; then at the eagerness in the child's
face, he leaned over the box rail and threw the little bunch
straight at his human target. They fell nearest to her, and though
she did not stoop to pick the flowers up, it seemed that the dark
eyes were fixed for a moment on the box and the handsome fair man
and his two companions.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa!" Louise was too excited to notice the coat
mademoiselle was trying to wrap about her. "Did you see? She really
looked straight at us. I'm glad Holofernes came out and bowed too.
He was too handsome to have his head cut off. Didn't you think so?
I cried, mademoiselle. See, the tears have made spots on my best
dress."</p>

<p>As they left the box the Duc shrugged amiably at his daughter's
quick chatter.</p>

<p>"For myself, I prefer comedy," he explained. "It's a sign of
growing old, they say, but I can't help it. There's danger and
horror enough in the world&mdash;and we needn't buy our tears."</p>

<p>His lips closed tightly on those last words. Looking up at the
profile of his face in the brilliance of the lighted corridor,
Henriette was struck by the grim set of his jaw and the way his
eyes took on a sudden blankness, as if to hide something secret and
painful.</p>

<p>She did not answer. The crowd milling about the foyer was so
great it required all his manoeuvring to lead them through. As they
moved towards the street Henriette was aware of curious eyes
following the Duc's tall figure. She heard his name spoken and
caught admiring glances directed towards their little
party&mdash;glances that included her curiously. Presently she was
conscious of particularly searching eyes, and she recognised the
group that had scrutinised them with such intentness from the
opposite box. Once more the Duc bowed formally, acknowledging a
greeting from one of the men. He did not pause as his acquaintances
evidently expected, but swiftly piloted his charges out to the
pavement where carriages were being called. Henriette kept close to
his side. She felt a hot rush of blood creeping into her cheeks
because of the way those two men had stared at her in cool
appraisal. Their eyes had been hard like glass, like little convex
mirrors, she thought, distorting something innocent to the ugly
proportions of something evil.</p>

<h3>Chapter Eight</h3>

<p>Corsica in August had for Henriette the unreality of a feverish
dream. A savage beauty lay upon those shores, and a remoteness that
chilled her at first sight. She was never to lose an early-morning
memory of the Strait of Bonifacio, with distant Corsica and
Sardinia rising in peaked magnificence like Scylla and Charydbis on
either hand. As the vessel which old Mar&eacute;chal
S&eacute;bastiani had chartered to bring his daughter and
grandchildren from Marseilles for their annual visit drew steadily
nearer those sheer cliffs, the strange quality of the landscape
overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>They might have been approaching the mountains of the moon, so
deserted were the dark heights and hollows; the jutting headlands
and deep indentations, with scarcely any sign of life or
habitation. Even when Henriette was able to make out a few
scattered farms, a cluster of fishing boats in harbour, or some
bleak stone church and tiny hamlet in a fold of hills, the
impression of sombre wildness persisted. She could not shake
herself free of dread.</p>

<p>"Ajaccio yonder," a sailor told her as an insignificant huddle
of houses became visible. "Napoleon Bonaparte was a boy there."</p>

<p>She looked at the straggling town with new interest. Out of this
uncompromising small world of rocky hills and dark harbours had
come the consuming genius of the little Emperor whose shadow still
lay across the face of Europe. Twenty-one years since he had died
in exile. The golden bees that had been the emblem of his glory
were scattered now like his lost legions, and the hive had been
despoiled. But something of that fierce, indomitable energy which
had goaded him on still lingered about these shores. Hidden fires
might even then be smouldering under the jagged hills and meagre
pastures. The glassy waters below those cliffs might suddenly
seethe, and the fishing boats rock ominously to the rumble of
volcanic thunder.</p>

<p>"Yes," she thought, turning to answer the greetings of Isabella
and Louise, who appeared just then from the cabins below. "It is
beautiful, this place, but alien. I wish we were leaving, not
arriving."</p>

<p>All through those weeks of salt and sun, while the children ran
and splashed in unrestrained freedom and grew brown as the kelp
drying above the tide line, she felt this sense of being alien to a
place. She might sketch the unspoiled wildness in her drawing book,
yet even as her pencil set down the bold outlines of crags and the
crude rigging of fishing boats something in her drew away in a
dread she would not put into words. At every turn she was aware
that Corsica and the Duchesse were curiously in accord. The dark,
heavy-eyed woman with her shifting moods of despair and frenzy, her
sullen broodings, and her violent displays of unrestrained
affection belonged here as surely as if in some inexplicable way
the island had given her its actual counterpart in human
temperament. In the luxurious estate at Olmeto where she was still
the pampered only child of a rich and influential old man, with her
brood of handsome boys and girls as tangible proof of her fruitful
marriage into one of the first families of France, Fanny, Duchesse
of Praslin, could afford to patronise Mademoiselle Deluzy.</p>

<p>"She stands on her own grounds here," Henriette told herself
early in the visit. "Also she means to let me see that she holds
the purse strings. No wonder he chooses to stay behind, rather than
listen to his pompous father-in-law singing her praises."</p>

<p>Without the Duc's presence to lend her his approval and support
Henriette had less authority over the younger children. They
remained devoted as ever. No excursion could be complete without
Mademoiselle Deluzy; not a day passed that one or another did not
bring her some present&mdash;a bit of coral from the shore,
curiously curled shells, pebbles with lucky bands, the first ripe
plum from the garden. But unconsciously they realised their
grandfather's indulgence and took their cues accordingly. She found
it almost impossible to keep to the well-ordered routine of nursery
and schoolroom with distractions tempting from morning till night.
There was no denying the lure of saddled donkeys waiting to be
ridden into the hills, gaily painted boats with smiling brown
boatmen eager to sail the young Praslins across the wide bays or up
narrow hidden inlets. Each pleasant day new excursions were planned
and led by the old Mar&eacute;chal; and Henriette's protests that
piano practice must continue and the weekly letter to the
children's father should not be forgotten, were easily brushed
aside. This was holiday time, the Duchesse and her father would
insist.</p>

<p>"They're only young once, Mademoiselle Deluzy," the doting old
man would say, fondling Berthe, who was his favourite. "Before we
know it they'll be betrothed and busy with homes and husbands of
their own. Isn't it so, my Fanny?"</p>

<p>And the Duchesse would sigh and agree and pointed out the Duc's
extraordinary ideas about the education of his daughters&mdash;as
if they needed all these accomplishments when it would never be
necessary for them to earn their own livings.</p>

<p>Henriette held her tongue against such remarks. She was far too
shrewd to take issue with the Duchesse, now that her powerful ally
and supporter was absent. No use putting up an offensive campaign
on enemy soil. Besides, she wanted to avoid all dissension. There
must be no criticism of her behaviour when they returned to Paris.
Perhaps, she dared to hope after certain excursions in which they
all joined, or on days when the Duchesse had seemed more kindly
disposed towards her, perhaps they might even come to an
understanding. So she continued to exert all her art of tact and
consideration. The old Mar&eacute;chal praised her retiring
deportment and congratulated his daughter more than once upon the
superiority of the new governess.</p>

<p>Henriette heard his words on several occasions and modestly
protested against such praise.</p>

<p>"I only seek to serve the children," she told him, "and hope to
please the parents. If I fail sometimes, no one regrets the
shortcomings more than I."</p>

<p>"My daughter belongs with the saints of this world," the
Mar&eacute;chal confided to her a few days later on an afternoon
when the Duchesse had retired with one of her migraine
headaches.</p>

<p>Henriette could not help noticing that the attack had followed
the arrival of mail from Paris. She had seen those plump white
hands shuffle through a sheaf of envelopes, seize one from the
rest, and tear it open in frantic haste. The contents of a single
sheet of notepaper could not have pleased the Duchesse, for she had
crushed it into a crumpled ball and gone immediately to her room.
Henriette was thinking of it now as she listened politely to the
anxious old man eulogising his daughter.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on, "Fanny is generous to a fault. She'd give her
very life for those she loves."</p>

<p>"Who wouldn't?" Henriette thought. "It's much more difficult to
live and let live."</p>

<p>But she waited in tactful silence while he continued.</p>

<p>"Nine times my poor Fanny has brought forth new life at the risk
of her own. She has been blessed with fine sons and lovely
daughters, yet I sometimes think the cost has been too great. Each
year has taken heavy toll of her strength, and since Raynald's
birth she has not been herself."</p>

<p>"And Raynald was four in June. Surely the doctors can find some
cure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It goes deeper than that, mademoiselle." The old man
sighed.</p>

<p>"She suffers cruelly, and what good is my wealth if it cannot
lessen her pain?"</p>

<p>"We cannot buy happiness, can we, monsieur&mdash;not for
ourselves or those we love?"</p>

<p>"True, too true," he agreed, pleased by her interest rather than
offended by her curiosity. "She brought one of the largest dowries
in France to her marriage," he went on. "Everything smiled on them
then, those two&mdash;" He broke off with another puzzled sigh.</p>

<p>Henriette made no comment, although she could not help recalling
an old saying she had heard in England years before: "A great dowry
is often a bed of brambles."</p>

<p>"Yes," her host went on without noticing her silence. "Time has
turned white sugar to white salt before now. Pardon, mademoiselle,
if I have said too much, but I beg you not to take offence if my
poor daughter sometimes appears distraught. Humour her,
mademoiselle, and your services will not be forgotten."</p>

<p>He left her before she had a chance to reply or learn if this
were a deliberate bribe or simply the effort of a worried old man
to win sympathy for his daughter. How much did he actually know,
she wondered, staring after his sturdy, retreating figure. How much
did she herself actually know when it came to that? She shrugged
and tried to dismiss the whole baffling matter from her mind. The
sun was bright beyond the windows, and the sea incredibly blue
between the garden cypresses. She could hear the voices of Berthe
and Raynald at play under the grape arbour.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," they called, "where are you?"</p>

<p>She turned to go to them, but as she stepped through the french
doors she was not thinking of the brilliance of sun and sea and the
warm gold of ripening fruit trained against oyster-white walls. She
was thinking of tortured, unforgettable words on a scrap of blue
paper, and of those adjoining apartments in the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, separated by a few square feet, but
with a widening gulf of bitterness and discord between.</p>

<p>"If it is no better when we return," she decided, "I must go. I
must find another place." But she spoke without conviction. It was
as if she guessed already that she would not be able to shed the
Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; so easily.</p>

<p>September wrapped the island in a warm, delicious haze. The
mountains took on a softened, remote purple, and the sharp-toothed
shores were less formidable in the mellow light that quickened the
brown grass and meagre vegetation to unsuspected beauty. On the
lonely beaches where the young Praslins played with scantily clad
companions from nearby fishing hamlets, each salt pool was an
irregular mirror of brightness, every wet shell and starfish and
polished pebble a fresh miracle of wonder and delight.</p>

<p>Henriette responded to this change. She relaxed in the heady
fruitfulness about her. She gave herself complete to sun and salt
air and the sweetness of ripening grapes in the small vineyards
that clung as they climbed stubbornly up steep hillsides. She fell
asleep quietly with the sound of far surf in her ears; she woke
refreshed to the incredible blue of morning with a sense of hopeful
well-being. Even the Duchesse and her unaccountable moods no longer
oppressed and irritated. She could endure them because she herself
felt equal to life and its exigencies.</p>

<p>Fanny S&eacute;bastiani, Duchesse of Praslin, seemed in better
spirits than at any time since Henriette had entered the household.
Once or twice she had even made timid advances towards the
governess, though the brooding apathy prevailed. Still, that was
better than the earlier pent-up outbursts. Henriette began to hope
that, though perhaps there could never be congenial relations
between herself and the children's mother, there might at least be
freedom from this suspicion and resentment.</p>

<p>"It's Mamma's birthday, Wednesday," Isabella announced
importantly one morning. "That's why we've postponed sailing till
Friday. Grandp&egrave;re is giving a banquet for her, and he says
Louise and I may come down afterwards and listen to the music."</p>

<p>"Yes, and what shall we do for gifts, mademoiselle?" Louise
demanded.</p>

<p>"You must finish your crewelwork mat then," Henriette decided.
"Fetch your workbag now and let me see how fast you can sew in four
days. Isabella, you should have told me before. There's nothing for
it but for you to illuminate a poem in your best script. You may
use my paints and foolscap if you will be careful."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle's ingenuity must also provide gifts for Berthe and
Raynald to present. That was not an easy undertaking with two small
people whose minds skipped more foolishly than the island goats,
and whose fingers were as yet unskilled. But the problem was
solved. Berthe produced a cabbage-leafed rose in lurid crayon
crimson and mauve with "<i>Ch&egrave;re Mama&mdash;Souvenir de
Berthe</i>" in crooked letters beneath, while Raynald gathered tiny
cockleshells for mademoiselle to glue into a frame. Both children
were overcome with awe by the beauty of this joint creation.</p>

<p>"When will it be your birthday, mademoiselle?" Berthe asked as
they wrapped the gift in readiness. "I'll make you a much more
beautiful picture."</p>

<p>"Yes," Raynald chimed in, "and I'll give you the piece of coral
I found. It's the most precious thing I have."</p>

<p>Henriette smiled and thanked them, but she was relieved these
remarks had not been overheard. Their very devotion might be her
undoing. Madame Leclerc, the Duchesse's maid, had a way of stealing
silently in and out of rooms, and she would be only too eager to
repeat such treason.</p>

<p>The old Mar&eacute;chal spent himself in lavish celebration of
the birthday. Long before daylight the kitchen fires roared in
preparation for the feast; the gardens gave up their spoils that
the long rambling villa might be transferred into a bower. Choice
wines in dusty bottles were brought from the cellars, and all day
streams of tenants came with nosegays to pay their respects to the
daughter of their landlord. Henriette could see that the Duchesse
was touched by these humble signs of good will. To all she was
gracious, yet she remained aloof, in a cloud of kindly detachment.
It was plain that her heart was not in these festivities centring
about her. Even the gifts he children laid in her lap only roused
her interest briefly.</p>

<p>"Madame," Henriette ventured in presenting hers, "I have only my
own handiwork to offer. I wish that I were more skilful; still,
since I give you back the likeness of your charming daughter, I
hope you will accept it with my good wishes."</p>

<p>"Your good wishes are more than enough." The Duchesse raised
drooping lids and fixed dark, reproachful eyes upon the governess
standing before her.</p>

<p>"Madame," Henriette went on, undaunted by the heavy sigh that
followed these words and by the other's indifference to the
offering, which lay untouched on the table, "the good Sisters at
the Convent taught me as a child to count each birthday the
beginning of a New Year. I could find it in my heart to hope that
you will let to-day be such between us. If I have made mistakes or
failed in my duties I beg you to tell me, to let me know your
wishes."</p>

<p>"My wishes," the Duchesse repeated with a note of bewildered
irony, "my wishes have ceased to matter. You are more of a fool
than I take you to be, mademoiselle, if you haven't noticed
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, but surely, Madame&mdash;" Before she could answer this
unexpected thrust, Berthe ran in from the garden.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" The child pointed impatiently to the unopened gift.
"You haven't looked at mademoiselle's present. Here"&mdash;she
thrust it into her mother's listless fingers&mdash;"I sat still as
a mouse for hours, didn't I, Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>ch&eacute;rie,</i> you were a fine subject."</p>

<p>The interruption had been opportune, and when the charming
pastel portrait was unwrapped the Duchesse showed genuine pleasure.
Henriette had caught the likeness extraordinarily well, and
Berthe's fair, round face stared out from the cardboard with
wide-eyed candour and innocence. Yet the resemblance to her father
was startlingly revealed behind the chubby contours. Too late,
Henriette decided, it would have been more tactful to have selected
brunette Louise or Raynald, in whose black brows and eyes their
Corsican inheritance was more apparent.</p>

<p>But the Duchesse, if she marked the Praslin features, made no
comment. Her praise and thanks rang true, and the tension which had
filled the room a few moments before was broken.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Madame"&mdash;Henriette lingered when Berthe
returned to her play&mdash;"I meant what I said just now. You must
believe that I want only harmony between us."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have wronged you," the older woman spoke wearily, but
without the film of bitterness that the governess had come to
associate with her words. "God knows I would not hurt another as I
have been hurt. But it's not easy to break the habits of doubt and
suspicion once they've been thrust upon one. Here in Corsica, where
my own carefree childhood walks beside me at every step, I can
almost forget the indignities I have suffered. I could almost come
to believe again in a world where those we love are not indifferent
to us."</p>

<p>Henriette felt embarrassed by this appeal for sympathy. To
confess openly that one was not beloved seemed almost a breach of
decency. Yet, in spite of her distaste for such a show of emotion,
she recognised that the cry had been genuine. She heard herself
answer soothingly, in a tone she might have used to quiet an
over-excited Berthe or Raynald.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, Madame, we must take affection in others for
granted. The minute we doubt, a cloud comes between us and them.
Love isn't so much sugar or tea that we can measure and weigh it in
scales."</p>

<p>"You seem to know a great deal about love, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Henriette gave no sign that the thrust had gone home. She went
on speaking steadily.</p>

<p>"I'm alone in the world, Madame, and I've learned to take what
bits of love come my way and piece them together as best I can to
keep me warm. I am reminded of those coverlets patched together
from odds and ends of other people's garments." She paused,
surprised that she had said so much to this other woman who to all
outward appearances possessed everything desirable in life. "Don't
begrudge me any stray bits of affection that come my way while I'm
under your roof," she went on. "Remember they're very small
compared to the whole piece of goods that is yours."</p>

<p>"But even little pieces can leave great holes in time. Don't
forget that, mademoiselle, since you are speaking of
patchwork."</p>

<p>Henriette found herself recalling their conversation as she
stood before the mirror that evening. She resented the Duchesse
having had the last word. It had put her at a disadvantage and left
them no nearer to the reconciliation she had hoped the birthday
might bring. They could never, it seemed, meet on the impersonal
footing of the employed and the employer.</p>

<p>"She turns the simplest word into a dart aimed at her
sensibilities," Henriette thought, brushing the lengths of her hair
about her fingers and letting them fall in smooth ringlets. "No
wonder she's unhappy, poor soul, and no wonder all who cross her
path hurry to be clear of the shadow she casts."</p>

<p>She hoped Isabella and Louise would appear affectionate and
dutiful at the reception to-night. There had been a regrettable
scene that afternoon when Raynald had insisted upon remaining at
home with mademoiselle instead of driving with his mother in the
carriage. There, her toilette was complete. The folds of her
shot-silk billowed green as sea water to her slippered feet. In the
fitted bodice her waist looked trim and small, and a white triangle
of neck showed where the ends of lace fichu met. There was colour
in her cheeks, and the waves of her hair lay softly upon her brow
and shoulders. She had not worn the dress since the night they had
gone to the theatre to see Rachel. As she leaned closer to the
glass to tuck a loosened curl into place she found herself thinking
of the Duc, wishing that he would be in that company below stairs.
Down there guests had been gathering since dusk, and now the
banquet must be at its height. The sound of bows on taut strings
came to her in mounting sweetness from the landing where the
musicians were stationed. They were a band of gipsy players from
Olmeto. Henriette and the children had watched their arrival in an
old cart&mdash;three fiddles and two guitars, a tambourine and a
crude flageolet. The tunes were strange to her. Listening, she was
stirred with sadness and an unrest. She moved to the window and
stared at the irregular pricking of lights on the mountain sides,
and below the garden and steep terraces to more lights that edged
the shore and to still more remote lanterns on the mastheads of
anchored boats. She felt far, far from all familiar things, and the
music with its sensual rhythm and melody drew out a response from
her pulses that made her feel a stranger to herself.</p>

<p>"Isabella, Louise!" She rapped on the door of the room where the
two girls waited in their ruffled white muslins and wide sashes of
pink and blue. "It's time to go down now. Stand up and let me see
if you are ready to make your bows."</p>

<p>Deftly she tightened knots of ribbons and adjusted the smooth
dark hair on the young shoulders.</p>

<p>"There, that's better. Remember, Isabella, to keep your
shoulders back. And, Louise, don't act as if you'd swallowed a
poker. Here are your basket of mottoes to pass."</p>

<p>"What if there shouldn't be enough to go round,
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Now, Isabella, when emergencies come we'll face them, not
before."</p>

<p>She smiled encouragingly at the overgrown, serious-faced
girl.</p>

<p>"But I like to know beforehand what things are going to happen,"
Isabella protested. "I wish Papa were down there instead of way off
in Paris. I think he might have come, don't you, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>Henriette avoided an answer by hurrying them out into the
corridor and down the great staircase. Hundreds of tapers burned,
doubling their brightness in mirrors and polished marble. A hum of
many voices from the long tables in the hall below rose and mingled
with the music that throbbed and swelled as the swarthy players
bent to their instruments. They passed close to the musicians, the
two excited girls in front clutching their baskets, the governess
moving discreetly behind, her face as smooth and taut as the lifted
tambourine which echoed the rhythmic confusion of her own
heart.</p>

<h3>Chapter Nine</h3>

<p>In the park about the Ch&acirc;teau de Vaux-Praslin yellow beech
leaves made rivers of rustling gold for the children's feet to
ford. Oaks darkened to russet and under the chestnut trees the
ground was thick with bursting burrs. Each noon the fierce October
sun melted the ice that coated pools in the road ruts, but each
night the frost laid on a new film and whitened the wide lawns and
terraces. No matter how early Henriette and her four charges set
out after morning lessons and <i>d&eacute;jeuner,</i> darkness
always overtook them as they trudged home to the persistent throb
of crickets.</p>

<p>There was, for Henriette, a stirring quality to the landscape at
this season, <i>l'&eacute;t&eacute; de Saint Martin.</i> Always
before, she had been forced to return to city streets and narrow
rooms at the first sign of frost. But now she gave herself to those
afternoons. The clear amber light was all the more precious because
of it briefness. It seemed to her an interlude of mellow completion
between the richness of summer and the bleakness of winter, with
the whole round earth a burnished apple hung in space.</p>

<p>The routine of her days had been smooth and unruffled since the
return from Corsica. They had gone at once to the ch&acirc;teau,
where the three other daughters had spent a month's holiday from
their convent. Later they had accompanied their mother and father
to a watering-place in the South of France where Dr. Simon had
recommended the salt baths. Whether these had benefited the
Duchesse or not, at least her absence had removed the sense of
strain and tension from nursery and schoolroom. The children's
lessons were no longer broken by their mother's unsettling
appearances and the inevitable aftermath of hurt feelings when one
or another drew away from her violent embraces or showed
insufficient interest in an avalanche of toys and sweetmeats. It
was far more simple, Henriette found, to supervise dutiful little
notes addressed to "<i>Ch&eacute;re Mama</i>" than to make them
respond affectionately to her actual presence. Isabella and Louise
grew noticeably less self-conscious and shy, and Raynald lost much
of his nervous intensity during these weeks. There were no
shattering scenes to leave him bewildered and hysterical. His sleep
and appetite improved till he was able to walk almost as far as
Berthe without tiring.</p>

<p>The servants at the ch&acirc;teau were not a hostile element to
baulk Henriette at every turn. They accepted her orders without
protest, and she did not feel they waited to betray her. For the
most part they were peasants not given to the petty scheming of
city-bred domestics. They accepted the Duchesse's bounty, her
wealth that had restored the Praslin estate to its old impressive
stature; they honoured her for her religious devotion, and for
giving the line a new heritage of sons and daughters, but the old
feudal instincts of family loyalty persisted tenaciously.</p>

<p>So the days flowed smoothly on with only shortening hours of
daylight to mark one from the next. October brilliance would soon
slip into the tarnished softness of November.</p>

<p>"It will be All Hallows Eve to-night," Louise announced as they
set out for their afternoon walk. "We must hurry back before dark.
I shouldn't like to meet a ghost, should you, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Well, Louise, I don't know. There must be good ghosts as well
as bad ones. But we're not going to meet any this afternoon," she
added quickly as she felt Raynald's fingers tighten in her own.</p>

<p>She was never to forget that afternoon in the woods at Melun.
Years afterwards she could recall the way the light shifted between
huge beech trunks as sleekly grey as mouse skin, and how the brook
was a torrent of gold leaf more solidly choked than if Midas had
turned it to metal. The sky showed brilliantly blue and polished in
gaps between yellow and bronze overhead, but for all its clearness
a faint, bitter blue haze drifted. One was always losing and
finding it again, like fragments of an old tune. Somewhere leaves
were burning the lovely ghost of summer in every whiff.</p>

<p>They found deep hollows where gold and russet leaves were
knee-deep, and Berthe and Raynald played at burying each other in
great rustling armfuls. They gathered pocketfuls of chestnuts,
defying the cruel sharpness of prickly burrs to feel the incredible
satin guarding the brown treasure. How sweet the kernels tasted as
their teeth crunched into the milky crispness! How the squirrels
rattled and raged from the boughs above!</p>

<p>They walked a mile out of their way to stop at the old mill and
see the mossy wheel turning, turning for ever under the press of
hurrying water. Leaning over the half-open door, their heads grew
dizzy with watching; their ears rang with the rushing din.</p>

<p>The miller and his plump wife came out full of smiles and
compliments.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Isabella is quite the young lady now. Her own
mother wasn't much taller when she came as a bride to the
ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p>"And Mademoiselle Louise&mdash;what lovely colour! Like ripe
peaches in the sun. And the two little ones, how they've grown
since summer! Berthe here&mdash;she's all Praslin, fair like the
Duc. Yes, she's her father's daughter and no mistake. And the
little fellow isn't a baby any more, though his face hasn't caught
up with those big black eyes yet!"</p>

<p>Such praise might be a trifle too lavish, but the friendly
meetings with country tenants were good for the children, Henriette
decided. She had difficulty in starting them towards home again.
The miller advised a short cut through the woods instead of the
longer way by the meadows and orchard, and he started them upon it
with careful directions. But Henriette had not reckoned on losing
the sun so soon. It dropped fast behind the old trees, and shadows
turned to twilight all about them.</p>

<p>"We must hurry or we'll lose the way," she told her little
troop.</p>

<p>"Take my hand, Raynald. Watch for the path ahead, and don't
stumble on roots."</p>

<p>"It's growing very dark, mademoiselle," Louise complained. "I
wish we'd brought one of the dogs with us."</p>

<p>Henriette wished so too; but she urged them on confidently,
keeping her eyes fixed on the narrow gap between the ranks of
trees. Woods where shifting sunlight dappled mossy trunks were
romantic places to be lost in, but woods close-packed after dark
were an altogether different matter.</p>

<p>"I smell a fire." Berthe stopped short in the path, sniffing and
pointing towards a faint, wavering glow. "It's over there."</p>

<p>They pushed on and presently found themselves in a clearing by a
small hut. A bent old figure moved about a sunken pit where a
brush-fire burned brightly. Henriette stood still with her feet
held fast to the frosty ground. She could scarcely believe in the
reality of the scene before her&mdash;the pagan glare of the
crackling fire and the old man heaping more brush upon it as if he
were following some mysterious rite, so old that he himself no
longer knew the meaning. She was almost sorry when she saw Berthe
dart into the circle of firelight and heard voices raised in
everyday greeting.</p>

<p>"It's old Loti, mademoiselle," Isabella was explaining. "He
gathers wood for our fires and keeps the park trim."</p>

<p>"Yes," broke in Louise, "Papa says he's older than anything but
the carp in the pond, and they're supposed to be over a
hundred."</p>

<p>Henriette could believe that when she saw the brown grooves of
his face. He might have been some resurrected mummy except for the
brightness of his two specks of eyes reflecting the firelight. His
wiry arms and legs were hardly more than thin sticks that showed
under his shapeless garments. His hands might have been
earth-darkened roots as the gnarled and crooked fingers grasped
more bundles of brush or prodded the fire with an iron fork.</p>

<p>"He says he's just going to roast apples for All Hallows Eve,"
Berthe hurried back to tell the rest. "It's some kind of spell, so
please, mademoiselle, can't we stay? He says there'll be one for
each of us and you, too."</p>

<p>Henriette hesitated. She knew they should be at home, not here
in the frosty twilight. Yet she herself was tempted to linger by
the fire. Their strange host, moving with the jerky spryness of an
antiquated grasshopper, filled her with curiosity. He might have
stepped from the woodcuts of some fairy book she had pored over in
childhood.</p>

<p>"It's good luck to eat an apple hot from the fire and wish the
dead well to-night," Louise was telling her.</p>

<p>"And he says the moon will be up soon, mademoiselle," Isabella
pleaded. "It will be light as day then."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Henriette allowed herself to be persuaded&mdash;"if
Raynald promises to keep warm." She buttoned his jacket and
fastened the muffler about his neck. They seated themselves on a
log near the fire while old Loti prepared the apples. This was
evidently an important ceremony, not to be carelessly undertaken.
First he brought two pans from the house and a bundle of long,
pointed sticks. Each apple was scrutinised, dipped first in a pan
of water, then rolled in what appeared to be sugar and cinnamon.
This done, he pressed the sharpened end of a stick into the core
and put the treasure into one of the children's hands. The sticks
were long and strong enough to reach over the hottest part of the
fire without the heat becoming to great for the holder to bear. He
showed them in pantomime how to turn the stick so that the apple
should be cooked evenly, not burned black on one side. It was
necessary above all things, he told them impressively when they had
each been supplied, not to drop the fruit into t he fire. That
would mean good fortune lost and bad luck for seven long years.
When the apples were done they must be eaten, every morsel, but the
core and the seeds counted and saved. If you were a girl, he
explained, the seeds stood for the number of years you must wait
before marriage. If you were a boy they foretold how many children
you would have.</p>

<p>"Twelve in mine last year," old Loti chuckled and gave Henriette
a sly wink. "But then, who says the age of miracles is past?"</p>

<p>She smiled and shrugged as she accepted the apple he pressed
upon her.</p>

<p>"There's no sense in my counting apple-seeds," she remarked as
she added hers to the others.</p>

<p>"Aren't mesdemoiselles allowed to marry?" Louise inquired
without lifting her eyes from the fire.</p>

<p>"There's no law against it," Henriette answered, "but as a
matter of fact they seldom do."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Raynald was curious.</p>

<p>"Oh, usually they're too busy looking after little girls and
boys. Careful, <i>ch&eacute;ri,</i> your apple is much too close to
the flame."</p>

<p>She helped him steady his stick and soon all the apples were
bursting their rosy skins. The fire sputtered as drops of hot juice
and sugar fell into it. Their faces burned in the heat, but the air
at their backs grew frosty with the deepening darkness.</p>

<p>Presently old Loti began to sing in a thin, rusty voice like the
chirp of a cricket. His withered lips scarcely moved, so the sound
seemed to be less a part of him than some essence of the night and
the fire and the apples sizzling in their own sweetness. The song
was strange to Henriette, and though many of the words escaped her
she made out that it belonged to All Hallows Eve and the restless
souls, lighter than dry leaves, who might be abroad.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle!" She felt Raynald edge closer. "It makes me
afraid. Let's go home."</p>

<p>"Hush!" She drew him to her. "There's nothing to be frightened
about. It's only an old song. Keep your eyes on the fire and your
apple."</p>

<p>The droning old voice sang on, and all at once Isabella and
Louise took up the refrain in their high, bird-like trebles:</p>

<blockquote>"Salt and bread we've set for you<br>
And we've scattered ash and rue,<br>
Now we'll say a prayer for you&mdash;<br>
<i>Requiescat in pace.</i>"</blockquote>

<p>Listening there in the dim clearing, Henriette could almost
believe in the superstition. The voices of the living lifted for
the dead, in a tune so old and plaintive, made her heart echo like
a hollow shell.</p>

<p>She would remember this moment always, she knew; the firelight
on old Loti, grotesque as some ancient effigy, and the faces of the
children, round and rosy as the apples they held to the fire. Pagan
or Christian, she thought, what did it matter except that so fair
and moving a custom should go on from generation to generation? It
was right that on one night of the year the quick should take
thought of the dead.</p>

<p>They ate their apple while the great fall moon pushed its way up
through the trees. Hot juice burned their impatient tongues; their
lips and fingers were sweet with smoky spice. Raynald forgot and
dropped his apple core in the fire, and Berthe lost hers underfoot.
The older girls tied their seeds carefully in their handkerchiefs
to count when they reached home. They rose to start back; but
something stirred at the edge of the clearing, and panic seized the
little group.</p>

<p>"A ghost, mademoiselle, a ghost!" Raynald buried his head in
Henriette's skirts and whimpered.</p>

<p>As she bent to reassure him old Loti chuckled.</p>

<p>"A pretty solid ghost, I must say! Don't you know your own
father when you see him?"</p>

<p>"Papa! Papa!"</p>

<p>They all ran towards the figure which had emerged from the
trees. Swift-footed Berthe reached him first&mdash;excited words
about fires and apples and ghosts tumbling pell-mell from her lips.
He set her on his shoulder and advanced into the circle of
firelight. In the low, pulsating light of the burning brushwood he
appeared gigantic and golden as some figure out of a legend, his
fair hair brightened to copper, the folds of his long brown cloak
turned to bronze. Even so, Henriette thought, must the early Norse
heroes have looked striding from triumphant battle, their proud
faces set towards Valhalla.</p>

<p>"I guessed where I should find you." He laughed and showed his
strong white teeth as he clapped the old man's bent shoulders.
"Loti roasted apples for me when I was no bigger than Raynald
here!"</p>

<p>"Take mine and welcome." Loti urged his fruit upon the Duc.</p>

<p>"Not a bite have I taken, and who knows but you'll find a
surprise or two in the core?"</p>

<p>But the Duc smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No more need for me to count apple-seeds, Loti. Nine children
are enough for me to manage, thank you! Raynald, it's your turn for
a ride. The rest of you keep close behind me, and the moon will see
us home."</p>

<p>Following that tall figure, they pressed through the woods in
single file, the three girls between and Henriette bringing up the
rear. The path showed dim before them, broken by patches of light
and shadow. Henriette kept her eyes fixed on their guide as he
strode forward, his bare head gleaming pale in the moonlit spaces.
Sometimes he looked back and waited for them to catch up to
him.</p>

<p>"I forget my legs are so long," he apologised, "and then I know
these woods so well. I could walk them blindfolded. I should know
if a root or a stump were not in its right place."</p>

<p>"That's a gift, monsieur, almost like a sixth sense," Henriette
told him.</p>

<p>"No, it's much more simple. You have only to be young in a place
to learn its secrets. Sometimes I think&mdash;Ah, well, one is apt
to grow sentimental about childhood, particularly one's own."</p>

<p>As they came in sight of the ch&acirc;teau Henriette noticed
that the rooms usually occupied by the Duchesse were the only ones
not lighted.</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse did not come with you?" she asked
politely.</p>

<p>"No, she remained in Paris. I am here for a few days to see how
work on the new wing is progressing. It's lonely in the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; without these four, and I confess I
wanted a sight of them too."</p>

<p>"I trust the Duchesse's health has benefited by her treatment at
the spa?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat, yes." He spoke guardedly. "But she is far from well
and easily upset. The doctors can do little for her, I fear."</p>

<p>Henriette said no more. She felt that he had no wish to continue
the subject; and she, for her part, could only feel relief at the
poor woman's absence. There would be no trying scenes to meet that
night or the next day.</p>

<p>They were very gay about the schoolroom fire. The Duc did not
eat alone in the blue and gold salon, but ordered his meal served
upstairs with the children's supper. Afterwards they cracked nuts
while the fire burned with soft hissings in the grate and the wind
outside only increased the sense of warmth and coziness behind
drawn curtains. The hours of walking in the open, the hot supper
and the warmth of the lighted room filled them all with relaxed
contentment. But the Duc's presence charged the atmosphere with
festivity.</p>

<p>Henriette sat with her needlework by the table, watching and
listening to the little group by the fire. She marvelled at his way
with the children. Whenever he spoke they hung on his words, and he
in turn listened intently to theirs. And how well he understood
those four! Stubborn, serious-minded Isabella and impulsive,
scatter-brained Louise chattered of their plans, and projects like
two excited magpies. He knew so well how to keep Berthe's high
spirits from turning to arrogance. As for Raynald, the frail child
seemed to take on new vigour and assurance whenever he was with his
father. "Yes," she thought as she led the two little ones away to
their bedrooms, "he is more than just a parent. This gift of his
for the young amounts to genius. Lucky he has it, for he needs to
be father and mother both!"</p>

<p>When she returned she found the older girls still arguing about
the number of seeds their apple cores had contained.</p>

<p>"We're facing a serious problem," he said, keeping a grave face
though his eyes twinkled suspiciously. "Louise, it seems, has six
seeds in her apple and Isabella eight. What shall we do about that,
Mademoiselle Deluzy?"</p>

<p>He had never fallen into the easy habit of addressing her by the
impersonal title "Mademoiselle." She had grown accustomed to that
wherever she worked, and this acknowledgment that he considered her
a personality as well as a governess was flattering.</p>

<p>"I'm hardly the one to advise," she told them.</p>

<p>"But a younger sister could marry first, couldn't she,
mademoiselle?" Louise persisted.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I believe it's possible." Henriette smiled as she
spoke. "It seems to me I remember reading in some old book that if
an elder sister dances in her stocking feet at her younger sister's
wedding she'll have a husband herself within the year."</p>

<p>"The first to marry isn't always the happiest." The Duc wound up
the discussion at last. "Off to bed now, you two, and don't worry
your heads about husbands yet. You'll have plenty of suitors when
the time comes!"</p>

<p>He kissed them and stood at the door watching them go down the
long corridor arm in arm. When he turned back to the fire Henriette
saw that a slight frown had deepened between his eyes.</p>

<p>"It makes a father feel old when his daughters begin to talk
about their husbands. It seems only yesterday I was being married
myself, but I'm thirty-seven. Before I know it I'll be a
grandfather."</p>

<p>"You'll make a delightful grandfather, monsieur. I think you'll
rather enjoy the r&ocirc;le."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he agreed. He was silent for a moment before he went
on. "But I might as well face the fact that my daughters are
growing fast. Four, five, six years at the most, and we'll have to
be finding them husbands. Yes." He sighed and stared thoughtfully
into the fire. "It's a barbarous custom&mdash;this matter of
dowries and suitable mating. I wonder sometimes if the English
aren't more sensible than we about marriage. But then, what does a
girl of eighteen or a boy of twenty know of love, or raising a
family for the matter of that?"</p>

<p>"The young Queen Victoria seems more than happy in her choice of
a mate," Henriette remarked, sorting out strands of coloured silks
from a snarl in her lap. "But I suppose she's hardly a fair
example."</p>

<p>He made no immediate response, but settled back into a chair
from which he could stretch his long legs in their polished boots
to the fire. She had not expected him to linger on after the
children's bedtime, but since he had lingered it seemed the most
natural thing in the world that he should be there just the other
side of the lamp-lit table.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy," he went on after a long pause, "I hadn't
thought to speak of this now, but since we seem to be on the
subject of marriage I may as well tell you what is on my mind.
These next years will be difficult ones for Isabella and Louise.
They're maturing fast. Physically they're almost women, though
they're children still in their minds and feelings. I want to let
them grow easily out of their childhood. There must not be shocks
and changes to upset them as there have been in the past. This
procession of maids and governesses coming and going in the
household, and with their mother's health what it
is&mdash;well&mdash;" He spread out his large white hands in an
expressive gesture of helplessness. "What can I say to you that you
do not know as well as I?"</p>

<p>"I beg you to go on, monsieur. If I have fallen short in any way
I want you to tell me."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no." He leaned forward earnestly and fixed her with
anxious eyes. "I have no fault to find, only praise for you and
what you have been to my children. You have brought order and peace
where all was confusion before."</p>

<p>"I have tried to do my best, but I know I've often made
mistakes&mdash;" But he brushed her words aside.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten what peace was," he went on. "But to-night in
this room I have found it again. Do you know I think it's years
since I felt anything like this&mdash;a quiet room, a fire and a
lighted lamp, work in a woman's hands, the children going to bed
without a trace of tears on their faces."</p>

<p>She was touched by his words, yet embarrassed at the implication
behind them. He had broken off abruptly to sit staring before him,
his fingers idly plucking at one of the silken snarls that had
slipped from her lap. The lamplight shone full on his face, and she
saw that he looked tired. In his eyes there was an expression of
humiliation and appeal. His mouth sagged at the corners. In that
moment, with the barriers of reserve down, she realised that he was
not the heroic creature he had seemed in the wood that
afternoon&mdash;golden, magnificent and equal to all things. She
saw him suddenly for what he was&mdash;a handsome, unhappy man in
the prime of life who reached out to her as helplessly as one of
his own children might have done.</p>

<p>"Don't go away!" His voice was tense in its appeal. "Don't take
away this refuge you've made in the household for all of us. It's
asking a great deal of you. I know that. I know the slights and
humiliations you have to put up with. God knows I know them all,
and still I ask you to pocket your pride and stay&mdash;for all our
sakes!"</p>

<p>"I cannot make such a promise, monsieur. You are free to give me
notice, and I must have the same privilege if it seems best. Things
have a way of changing, almost overnight." He made a queer sound in
his throat&mdash;half sigh, half groan. She hesitated a moment,
then hurried on. "Not that I'm intending to leave. I want to stay.
I'm very fond of the children, and I want to please you and
Madame&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, though it was on the tip of her tongue to add,
"&mdash;if that's possible."</p>

<p>"I'll make it worth your while," he persisted, "if you'll stay
till Isabella marries I'll see that you have a pension. We need not
mention it to the Duchesse, but I'll have my lawyer draw up an
agreement; so you can feel perfectly assured."</p>

<p>"Why, monsieur, your word would be enough. I need nothing more
binding."</p>

<p>"Still," he went on, "if anything happened to me, you would have
something beside my word. Mademoiselle Maillard is gone; so there
will be no more interfering with your management of the children
when you return to Paris. Everything is to be in your hands from
now on, and if you need help you can choose your own assistant. You
will agree, Mademoiselle Deluzy, so that I need not be afraid every
time I see a trunk carried out that you are leaving us?"</p>

<p>It was hard to resist him when he brought the whole force of his
personality to bear upon her. But she clung stubbornly to her
stand.</p>

<p>"I cannot make a promise I might have to break," she repeated.
"But I'll do my best. You can rely on me not to take offence
easily. All women in my position must learn to put up with certain
slights; and perhaps I've had too much pride, but it's been my only
dowry, you see."</p>

<p>He nodded and continued to twist the tangled silks into a more
hopeless snarl.</p>

<p>"It will be easier now I know I have your confidence."</p>

<p>Outside, the wind had gathered force. They could hear it among
the nearer oak trees and whipping the dried fingers of a vine
against the casement. On the nursery mantelpiece the squat marble
clock struck ten musical notes. The Duc drew out his own watch with
the heavy gold seals, compared both timepieces and rose to take his
leave. But he stood for some minutes by the window, peering out
between the curtains as if he saw more than the dark pane of
glass.</p>

<p>"All Hallows Eve," he said. "I'd forgotten till old Loti and the
children reminded me this afternoon."</p>

<p>"It's easy to forget in the city where there's only time for the
living," she answered.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;he turned towards the door&mdash;"we won't begrudge
the dead their privilege. We have all the other nights of the year.
Goodnight, Mademoiselle Deluzy. I shall see you to-morrow at
<i>d&eacute;jeuner."</i></p>

<p>She heard the sound of his boots descending the stairs, and she
continued to hear their echo long after she knew that silence had
fallen on the place.</p>

<h3>Chapter Ten</h3>

<p>There was no snow for Christmas, 1842, but on the last afternoon
of the year the sun grew pale as a frosty penny and then retired
altogether behind a fine curtain of slanting flakes. Henriette
stood at her window and watched the wintry garden at Number 55 Rue
du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; take on miraculous whiteness. The
bronze dolphin wore an icicle at his open mouth, and the gateposts
soon had thick white wigs of snow on their round tops. All the bare
trees and evergreen shrubbery were transformed before her eyes, and
still the streams of flakes fell tirelessly like grains of sand
shaken from some inexhaustible hour-glass.</p>

<p>"Beautiful," she murmured, "but it will be cold on the streets,
and those windy rooms on the Left Bank will be freezing. Well,
there's no help for it. I've promised to go, and Marie and Albert
will be expecting me."</p>

<p>She had been given a half-day to herself and was to dine with
Monsieur and Madame Remey. Madame Le Maire was to join them for the
meal, and the occasion had been planned a fortnight before. For six
months now Albert Remey had tutored Isabella and Louise in all
their lessons except the painting, which Henriette continued to
supervise. This gave her more times to teach Berthe and Raynald,
and to chaperon the older girls on their visits to museums and
theatres and concerts. This choice of an assistant had been
Henriette's when the Duc insisted upon her having help in the
schoolroom. It had been a successful arrangement. Young Monsieur
Remey had proved himself an excellent teacher&mdash;conscientious,
dignified and scholarly. Above all, Henriette knew she could rely
on his personal loyalty. Intrigues might be brewing under his nose,
and he would never scent them. Like the symbolic monkeys of India,
he literally saw no evil, heard no evil and spoke no evil.</p>

<p>The Remeys' gratitude to Henriette might sometimes become
tiresome, yet it was sincerely moving. Her thoughtfulness in
securing the teaching post for Albert had been for her a natural
and spontaneous gesture of friendship. But for these two gentle,
devoted souls it had been nothing short of a miracle. Because of
her, their life together took on the bloom which only small
comforts and security can give. She had made possible those four
rooms high up in an old house on the Left Bank that were their
pride, rooms which Marie's thrifty domestic gifts had transformed
into a quiet sanctuary where Henriette was welcomed with warmth and
affection whenever she had leisure to visit them.</p>

<p>"They're like a pair of birds in a nest, as Madame Le Maire once
said," she thought after one of her first evenings there. "Two
birds that can be happy in their wisps of straw and dry
crumbs."</p>

<p>She might smile at their na&iuml;ve ways and their tireless
enthusiasm for the smallest detail of their humble existence, but
for all that she envied them the refuge their love for each other
had made. It was good to have such simple, loving friends as these;
good to feel that she was in a large part responsible for their
happiness. For each one of us there must be someone for whom we
assume the r&ocirc;le of Goddess of Plenty. In Albert and Marie
Remey, Henriette found this reassurance.</p>

<p>She sighed as she selected her old blue merino dress instead of
a new garnet velvet she had planned to wear. When she had so few
occasions to go out alone, it seemed a pity that the weather should
have thwarted her.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," she thought, taking out her black beaver bonnet and
heavy cloak, "the Remeys won't notice what I have on my back; and,
at least, Madame Le Maire will have no reason to remark on my
extravagance."</p>

<p>She did, however, permit herself one luxury. The round sealskin
muff she had bought for herself would not be ruined by snow. She
lifted it from its box and sank her hands luxuriously in its warm
depths. She laid the sleek darkness against her cheek fora moment.
Then she blew lightly on the rich pelt, remembering as she did so
how years ago the Sisters in the Convent had reproved her for doing
that very thing to the fur tippet belonging to one of her mates.
They had talked in sad seriousness of this unfortunate love of hers
for the vanities of this world. A knitted woollen muffler, they had
pointed out, would serve the purpose of protecting her from the
elements as well. She smiled now, remembering their grave, sweet
faces, remembering also that all the while she had stood listening
in dutiful silence, she had been inwardly vowing to own just such a
muff as the one she now held.</p>

<p>She seldom went empty-handed to the Remeys, and to-day as she
set off she had all she could do to handle the muff and a large
basket of fruit in gay wrappings. Besides this bulky gift she
carried a box of nuts and bon-bons salvaged from the children's
lavish Christmas celebration, and in her bag were handkerchiefs for
Marie and Madame Le Maire, embroidered by her own hands in the fine
convent stitches she had learned. It was difficult to manage all
these articles, but she decided against ringing for help. She had
learned in that year and a half not to ask favours of the servants.
She saw to it that they performed rigidly all duties connected with
the children in the east wing, but, knowing their resentment of her
position, she was shrewd enough to give them no cause to complain
of her demands. The porter would hail a cab for her, or if he
seemed surly and there were no public conveyances to be hired
nearby, she would walk on till she found one for herself.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy!" She had just reached the corridor leading
to the entrance when she heard her name spoken.</p>

<p>Turning quickly, she saw the Duc hurrying down the stairway
behind her. He ran down like a boy, two steps at a time, his long
cape blowing behind him, his hat and cane under one arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you going so laden down?" he asked as he joined her.
"Why not call one of the servants to help you? That basket's much
too heavy."</p>

<p>He took it from her, weighing it in his own strong hands.</p>

<p>"Oh"&mdash;she smiled&mdash;"I'm used to getting along alone. I
never like to bother any one on my free afternoons. Please, you
shouldn't trouble yourself on my account just as you're going
out."</p>

<p>But the Duc continued to hold her basket. He did not hand it
over to the footman at the door or to Merville, the concierge, who
hurried out from the gatehouse to be of assistance. By the waiting
carriage he stopped.</p>

<p>"I'll see you and your holiday cargo safely to port." He smiled.
"This is no day for you to be out on foot."</p>

<p>In spite of her protests she found herself on the cushioned seat
with the Duc beside her. A robe was being spread over their knees.
The carriage was partly closed, the top protecting their heads and
shoulders from snow, but the robe on their laps soon held miniature
drifts in its thick folds. On the dark fur of Henriette's muff the
white flakes lay without melting, pointed and delicate as tiny
feathered stars.</p>

<p>"You're not cold, Mademoiselle Deluzy?" she heard him asking
beside her.</p>

<p>Politely she heard herself responding that she was quite
comfortable. Comfortable&mdash;what a dull, inadequate word it was
for the glow and exhilaration she felt as they swung along the
familiar street, made suddenly new and strange by snow and this
unexpected adventure! They turned into the narrower channel of the
Rue de Marengo, and from there into the Rue de Rivoli with its
glittering shop windows on one side and the open square and vast
walls of the Louvre on the other. Although it was not yet four
o'clock gas had been lit in the shops, and the windows of
jewellers, modistes and florists took on a detached, yet magnified
brilliance through the falling snow.</p>

<p>"If this keeps up," her companion was saying, "we shall need to
get out the sleighs."</p>

<p>"And Paris will have more bells to welcome in the New Year," she
answered. "Sleigh-bells have a holiday sound, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but one needs to hear them in the country, coming from a
long way off, then growing nearer. I wish now that we had gone to
Melun for the holidays. It will be beautiful there in the
snow."</p>

<p>There was a deep stillness on the river as they crossed the
Pont-Neuf. The tall old houses on the Left Bank showed dim as
spectres and the vast bulk of Notre Dame rose on its island like an
angular mountain, its peaks softened and indistinct.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," Henriette broke the silence with another apology,
"that this is taking you out of your way."</p>

<p>"My way," he repeated. "Well, if you must know, it happens to be
yours for this afternoon."</p>

<p>"It's more than generous of you to do me this favour." But he
brushed her thanks aside.</p>

<p>"The fatour's on my side," he insisted. "I was bored,
Mademoiselle Deluzy, horribly bored. The children were off with
their grandfather for the afternoon, and Madame expected a visit
from the Abb&eacute;; besides, she has no taste for snow. I thought
I should go mad if I sat on at my desk or by the fire in that house
which will never be mine."</p>

<p>She looked up startled by his words and tone. His mouth, she
saw, had taken on a bitter curve, and his thick brows were drawn
close in a frown.</p>

<p>"But, monsieur"&mdash;she tried to pass off those words
lightly&mdash;"surely you don't mean that! It's natural in the
holidays when the children are all at home to feel the place is
given over to them and their doings. By next week it will he
different."</p>

<p>"I did not mean the children. Thank heaven for what they bring
to the place. But it's S&eacute;bastiani, not Praslin. Don't you
understand? The old Mar&eacute;chal owns it. He comes and goes
whenever he pleases. At Melun, now, it's different."</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, and another long silence followed. Not
since the autumn night at Melun more than a year ago had he spoken
so personally. Scarcely a day had passed in all that time when they
had not met and discussed matters that concerned the children
intimately. Always he had been considerate, generous and wise in
his judgments, but that windy night of All Hallows Eve and this
afternoon driving together through softly streaming snow, it was as
if he had let the reins slip from his hands and given the dark
steeds of bitterness and despair their way. Only for a moment now
as on that earlier occasion did she feel the violence of the
emotion he kept so coolly in check. Almost instantly he had himself
in hand and was speaking to her of other matters in casual tones.
But she was not deceived. She was herself so accustomed to
repressing her own feelings that she had grown quick in scenting
others'.</p>

<p>"Yes," she thought, "he's right. It's not his house as the
ch&acirc;teau is. He needed their money, and they needed his title.
He was young, and it must have been an excellent match. But whoever
marries for money pays for it in this world."</p>

<p>She remembered that discussion in the schoolroom when Isabella
and Louise had explained casually that their Mamma had had the
money. And yet it could not always have been like this, cold and
perfunctory on his part, passionate and turbulent on that of the
Duchesse. They must have loved richly and well once. Were not the
children living proof of that? She felt her cheeks flushing at her
thoughts, and she caught up her muff and laid it to her face,
forgetting the snowflakes that stung her with their sudden
chill.</p>

<p>"Look!" she said. "It's like fairyland there among the
trees."</p>

<p>They were driving by the nearly deserted Gardens of the
Luxembourg. About each tall lamp-post the spinning flakes glittered
like a swarm of tinsel bees, but beyond the lights mysterious white
branches and frosted trunks of trees were only half visible in the
dimness.</p>

<p>"Why did you smile just now?" he was asking her. "Surely you can
share whatever made you look so pleased."</p>

<p>"You'll think it silly, I'm afraid," she explained, turning her
face impulsively towards him. "But ever since we began to drive
it's bothered me&mdash;you and I here in the carriage and the snow
falling all round us. I couldn't think why it kept reminding me of
something I used to know. And just now I remembered. There was a
paperweight on a desk long ago&mdash;a little round glass globe
with figures and a snow scene inside&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know!" His face broke into a pleased smile that made him look
suddenly boyish. "My mother had one. You shake it and the snow
whirls out of nowhere in a blinding storm."</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed with a soft laugh. "That's exactly what I
meant. Somehow this doesn't seem like a real snowstorm. It's as if
you and I and all Paris were caught fast in a little glass globe
with the flakes going round and round like frozen stars."</p>

<p>It seemed the most natural thing in the world to share her fancy
with him. Only afterwards, alone in her room with the evening spent
and another year rung in by all the clamouring bells of Paris, did
she marvel at her lack of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>"Here," she said at last, peering ahead to find the familiar
street, "this is the corner. The Remeys live in the court behind.
Your horse will never be able to turn in such a narrow place, so
let me down here."</p>

<p>He insisted on conducting her himself to the door, the basket
still on his arm. The rusty bell echoed in the dark hall, but they
waited some minutes before the door was opened. As they stood
together on the snowy steps she thanked him once more. Then,
hesitantly, she asked if he would come in.</p>

<p>"The Remeys would be so honoured," she added. "And you've made
him happy by your generosity, you know."</p>

<p>But he shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he told her. "I've an errand to do before I return. Wish
them well, and drink my health if you're making New Year
toasts."</p>

<p>He touched the top of a bottle that protruded from the basket
and looked up with an amused expression.</p>

<p>"I won't forget, monsieur. Happy New Year."</p>

<p>"Happy New Year to you, Mademoiselle Deluzy. It will be 1843
before we meet again!"</p>

<p>She scarcely felt her feet taking the long uncarpeted flights of
stairs. Laden down with gifts as she was, she did not have to pause
for breath on any landing. She moved, trance-like, through the
dingy halls, wrapped in her own warmth and exhilaration. Vaguely
she was aware of her host's eager welcome as she surrendered basket
and box into his hands, of her hostess's gentle, sisterly kiss on
her cheek, and of Madame Le Maire's thorny greeting from the
fireplace where she sat drying her damp skirts.</p>

<p><i>"Ciel,</i> but you look blooming!" the old woman exclaimed
after a searching scrutiny. "It's plain you didn't come on foot, or
your skirts would be more bedraggled than mine."</p>

<p>"No, I was driven," Henriette admitted. But she did not enlarge
on that simple fact and quickly changed the subject. "You'd better
unpack that box at once, Marie. The cakes crumble easily, and the
bon-bons will be damp. Take care how you handle that bottle,
Albert. It's not champagne, but even so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bottle's a bottle these days!" Madame remarked, and spread
her dress hem nearer to the grate fire.</p>

<p>"Henriette does look blooming to-night," Marie agreed. "If I
didn't know better I'd say you had a touch of rouge on your cheeks,
my dear, and your eyes shine so. Doesn't she look a picture,
Albert, with the snowflakes still caught in her hair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, indeed," Albert responded dutifully, peering at their
guest out of his near-sighted, student's eyes. "This spell of cold
certainly seems to agree with you."</p>

<p>"Cold&mdash;fiddlesticks!" sniffed Madame. "It's luxury she
thrives on. Butter a cat's paws if you want to keep it purring by
your fireside."</p>

<p>"Now, Madame, for shame to tease her." Marie flew to her
friend's defence. "You know how hard Henriette works, and how
generous she is to us all!"</p>

<p>But Henriette only laughed at the old woman's sly dig. She was
in no mood to take offence and rather relished this joke at her own
expense.</p>

<p>"Oh," she admitted, laying aside her wraps and bonnet, "I'm not
above enjoying a soft cushion and a saucer of cream when they come
my way. I'm not unselfish like you, Marie, or a scholar like Albert
who can forget himself in his books. If I'm to work all my life I
will, but not for scraps and cast-off clothes and the wages of a
kitchen-maid."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" croaked Madame. "I always said you had more than
your share of ambition. But remember, we can't any of us go to
heaven in a feather bed."</p>

<p>"No, but we can enjoy it before we get there. Here, Madame, I've
brought you a little remembrance for the New Year."</p>

<p>The handkerchiefs were presented, and the fruit and sweets
unpacked, amid exclamations of pleasure and awe.</p>

<p>"Such oranges, Henriette, and hothouse grapes&mdash;big as
plums; and marrons and little rum cakes to have with our
coffee."</p>

<p>She listened with detached pleasure in their happiness. Her own
happiness seemed to have retired to a far place within herself.
Secret and rosy and almost suffocating, it warmed her with a glow
which the mulled wine Marie and Albert had prepared under Madame's
instructions only increased. They drank it by the fire, clinking
their china cups and pledging one another's health.</p>

<p>"Madame Le Maire&mdash;your good health, and plenty of students
in all your rooms."</p>

<p>"Marie and Albert&mdash;" Somehow it was impossible to toast
them separately, those two who thought and spoke and moved as one.
"And Henriette, your health and good fortune."</p>

<p>She stood holding her cup while they drank with the firelight
edging the familiar outlines of their faces, somehow making them
new to her in that moment. Snow drove white against the darkening
window panes where the candle flames repeated their orange points.
On the tablecloth the fruit was a rich pyramid of colour, the
tin-foil wrapping the bon-bons she had brought was turned to
silver.</p>

<p>"Shall we make one more toast?" she heard her voice saying
quietly. "We've drunk to one another, but there's someone else
whose health I'd like to propose." Their faces grew curious as she
hurried on. She could not forget the favour asked of her on the
snowy steps an hour ago. "The Duc de Praslin is responsible for
your work, Albert, and for mine. I think we should wish him and his
household well before our cups are empty."</p>

<p>"Of course, Henriette." Albert raised his wine. "He's been very
generous to us. May he have health and prosperity, and may we
continue to find favour in the schoolroom,"</p>

<p>She had planned to word the toast herself, and she would have
said happiness instead of prosperity. But no matter, she had kept
her promise to him, though no doubt he had not meant his request to
be taken literally. It was only after their cups had been drained
that Madame Le Maire spoke her usual last word from the
fireside.</p>

<p>"It's a queer thing you drink to the Duc and not to the Duchesse
as well."</p>

<p>Henriette felt grateful that for once Albert Remey answered for
her.</p>

<p>"It may seem queer to you, Madame Le Maire, but Henriette and I
both know whom we serve. I don't wish the Duchesse any ill will,
mind you, but if we depended on her for our bread and butter we'd
be begging crumbs of the sparrows in the Gardens."</p>

<p>"He must be a remarkable man to stir such devotion in you both,"
the old woman persisted. "I did not guess you were on such intimate
terms."</p>

<p>"I'd hardly say intimate," Remey went on, "though I naturally
see less of him that Henriette. He makes few comments except where
the interests of his children are concerned. A rather cold man, I
should say, shouldn't you, Henriette?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps 'reserved' describes him better." She spoke casually
and avoided the old woman's eyes. "But he can be cold, yes,"</p>

<p>Madame did not drop the subject, though Albert had gone to the
kitchen to help Marie serve dinner,</p>

<p>"Handsome, too, I've heard," she observed. "Cold, you both say.
Well, don't be taken in by that. There's plenty of fire in the
coldest flint!"</p>

<p>Henriette was glad when they were summoned to the steaming
tureen of bouillabaisse whose fragrance filled the room. Now Marie,
flushed from the fire and her supreme domestic efforts, became the
centre. She beamed at their words; and her small, plain face grew
radiant with loving hospitality as she watched the food
disappear.</p>

<p>"You'll spoil me," she told them shyly. "It would have been
better if we could have afforded lobster in place of shrimps, and
perhaps I put in a pinch too much of saffron."</p>

<p>The roast duck with bursting apple stuffing, the vegetables and
coffee&mdash;all were praised in turn while the candles burned in
four clear points of light, one for each face at the table; and the
snow made faint clickings at the window panes. They sat on and on,
eating Henriette's fruit and bon-bons, cracking walnuts and talking
now of the world in general and now of themselves in
particular.</p>

<p>Madame Le Maire complained of business. Trade was dull with the
Court still in mourning for the death of the young Duc
d'Orl&eacute;ans. She hoped the talked-of visit from Victoria and
Albert to Louis Philippe would materialise next spring or summer
Not that she expected royal guests from across the Channel to fill
her rooms in the Rue du Harlay, but it might help. Still, with
taxes and the cost of food steadily mounting she would be lucky not
to be out of pocket, let alone making any profit.</p>

<p>Henriette and Albert exchanged furtive smiles. They were
familiar with Madame's complaints, and they both knew from
experience her capacity for paring every franc and sou.</p>

<p>Under Marie's urging Albert admitted that he had been asked to
contribute an article on the Greek philosophers to a volume in
preparation for elementary students. The remuneration would be
small, but it would be paid upon delivery of his manuscript, and if
by working at night he could finish it by Easter he and Marie might
hope for a short holiday together on the coast of Brittany or even
in England. He was anxious to examine some material in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>Presently they spoke of books. Marie opened her soft eyes wide
in astonishment that Henriette should have read the latest work of
the notorious Madame George Sand.</p>

<p><i>"Un Hiver &agrave; Majorque.</i> All about her love affair
with the popular composer Chopin. Was it really as shocking as
people said?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly, Marie. Daring, one might call it, but I must
confess parts of it seemed dull to me."</p>

<p>Then she was telling them of something else she had read&mdash;a
remarkable story she had come across in a recent periodical. It was
a translation, she believed, from the pen of some obscure American
writer whose name she had already forgotten. "The Murders in the
Rue Morgue," it was called, and she had almost missed it because
she always shunned accounts of murder and violence. But this
one&mdash;well, it was extraordinary and had kept her broad awake
till daylight.</p>

<p>"Really, Albert," she advised, "you should read it. The way the
crimes are detected, and the amazing deductions, would hold even
your academic mind spellbound."</p>

<p>But Monsieur Remey shook his head. Such tales of ghoulish
fiction were not for him. For a woman Henriette possessed the most
stimulating mind he had ever met. It was a pity to have her waste
it on such worthless literature. Still, why argue with her on New
Year's Eve on so trivial a matter? For all her intelligence, she
was a woman and could never hope to go far in lines of
scholarship.</p>

<p>Home again through the snow in a hackney coach. It had been
secured with difficulty, and the driver had asked an outrageous
price. But it was New Year's Eve, and any sort of vehicle brought a
premium. Henriette might have hesitated, but to-night she felt
above haggling over francs. A mild recklessness overcame her
economical scruples. She felt warm and in complete accord with the
world as she helped Madame Le Maire in beside her.</p>

<p>"I'll leave you at your door," she assured her. "No, it's only a
little out of my way, and you're not to go floundering about on
such a night."</p>

<p>"Well, since you're set on being extravagant I suppose I may as
well profit by it. You're generous, Henriette. Yes, I'll say that
for you."</p>

<p>Henriette smiled under cover of the darkness. Madame so seldom
paid compliments that when she did so her manner became even more
grudging and reluctant. She could not help admiring the old woman's
spirit. She needed it to cling tenaciously as she did to the small
niche she had made for herself. Bargaining and scrimping, week in,
week out, to keep her independence in a world of dependent women,
Henriette understood her companion because of the stubborn will to
succeed which was probably the only trait they shared in
common.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she thought as their carriage crawled along on its
difficult course through the snowy streets, "I shall be old and
alone as she some day."</p>

<p>But the thought did not alarm or sadden her because she did not
believe it. Impossible at thirty, with the blood warm in one's
veins and with a new year waiting to be explored; impossible to
believe in age and loneliness and death. Other people grew
querulous and stiff-jointed and grey; other people died and were
forgotten. But somehow you were the exception. You would stay hale
and hopeful by sheer force of will.</p>

<p>She was aware that Madame was speaking beside her. Yes, she
agreed, it had been a very pleasant evening. The Remeys certainly
made delightful hosts, and she was glad to see them so happy. She
hoped the article Albert had been commissioned to write would be
the first of many.</p>

<p>"They'll always get along somehow," Madame Le Maire said. "You
see they believe in ravens."</p>

<p>"In ravens, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when you don't know where to find your month's rent or
to-night's dinner, the ravens mysteriously provide. You acted as
one when you put that tutoring his way. It's a great gift, having
faith in ravens, for they never desert you if you really believe in
them. Unfortunately they always knew I was sceptical."</p>

<p>Henriette laughed.</p>

<p>"I've never believed in them either, now I think of it."</p>

<p>"No, you're not the sort to. Ravens like helpless, gentle people
like Albert and Marie. You're much too independent, but you'll get
on. Oh, you'll get on in the world. I saw that before we'd
exchanged two words."</p>

<p>The driver pulled his horse up sharp and shouted at another
carriage which blocked the way into the Rue du Harlay. When the
shouts and confusion were over and they moved on, Madame Le Maire
began gathering up her belongings, continuing to talk as she did
so.</p>

<p>"I've watched plenty of young people come and go. Some of them
had looks, and some had brains, and some had both and didn't know
how to make the most of either. But you've got what none of them
had, and it won't wear out and leave you like a pink and white
complexion or a graceful figure." She stooped to find her umbrella
on the floor, while Henriette waited to hear final judgment
pronounced. "You're like yeast. Put you anywhere and you'll rise to
the top. They can't keep you at the bottom, and you couldn't stay
there if you wanted to. Well, Happy New Year, whatever it brings to
all of us!"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure whether she meant that for praise or not,"
Henriette thought as she drove on alone, "and I'm not at all sure I
like being compared to yeast."</p>

<p>There was only the under porter at Number 55 to return her Happy
New Year wishes when she reached the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; at half-past eleven. If the evening
had not been stormy she would have been tempted to prolong her
drive until the hour struck, but as it was she knew she should be
thankful to be safely back in her own apartment. There were worse
things than to welcome the New Year in alone.</p>

<p>She turned up the lamp and stared about the little sitting-room
which now seemed as much a part of her as the gloves she slipped
from her hands. Its soft curtains had been drawn, and the fire laid
ready for lighting. Potted begonias bloomed in delicate rose, and
ivy trailed glossy greenness from a shelf below the window. In the
bedroom beyond she could see that the covers of her bed had been
turned back. The mirror's curves and her brushes and stoppered
bottles gleamed on the bureau below. She thought of the bleak walls
and shabby furnishings of that other room in the Needle's Eye, and
was well content as she bent to light the fire. This was luxury,
and she had earned it for herself. She would never go back to
narrow iron bedsteads, to cracked china and dim, distorted
looking-glasses hung under sloping eaves.</p>

<p>A knock at the door startled her from her reverie. She answered
it, expecting to see Maxine or one of the other maids, and was
surprised to find the Duc's valet standing there. She accepted a
small box which he held out to her on a silver tray, and turned
back with it to the fire.</p>

<p>There was no mark on the wrappings, though the box bore the name
of an expensive shop she had often passed in the Rue de Rivoli.
Wonderingly her fingers explored the cotton and felt an object
heavy and smooth and round. She had it in her hand at last&mdash;a
paperweight of clear glass with a little red-cloaked figure inside.
At her touch a miniature storm of white flakes rose and whirled
about the tiny human replica. She stared fascinated till the show
stopped spinning. Then she set it down on the table and moved to
the window. No need to search in the box for the card she knew she
would not find.</p>

<p>It was midnight: the first solemn strokes were sounding, from
her own clock and others in the great house, from still others
throughout Paris. She pushed back the curtains and, pressed her
flushed cheeks to the cold pane. Another year, and all the bells
hailing it with their rich metallic din. She knew the clear,
musical tones of Saint Roch, swelling nearby, and she believed she
could distinguish the distant notes of others&mdash;even of Notre
Dame from its island in the Seine. Such old bells. God only knew
how many other years they had welcomed for long dead listeners to
hear. And they would go on and on ringing with the same clear
solemnity when she was no longer there to listen, to wonder what
this New Year would bring in its procession of untried nights and
days.</p>

<p>She felt tears gathering in her eyes, and her heart set up an
unreasoning beating which she had no power to quiet. She was
suddenly afraid of her own heart. It had never betrayed her like
this before. Why was she standing there happy and sad, full of
questions like a frightened child? But she found no answer. It is
better not to ask questions of the heart.</p>

<h3>Chapter Eleven</h3>

<p>The spring of 1844 flowed into summer on clouds of bloom. At
Vaux the cherry and peach trees had scarcely flung their, last
petals to earth and air before the apple orchards put on miraculous
white and rose, and their sweetness filled the dark with such
subtle fragrance that Henriette woke night after night to a new
unrest.</p>

<p>Beauty like this was too much to be borne alone, she thought,
and she was glad when heavy rain swept the apple tree bare in an
afternoon. Nature mocked her on every hand with its burden of
prodigality. She could not shut her eyes to this promise of budding
fruitfulness all about her. Even the children seemed aware of the
significance. They were continually asking questions that stabbed
her anew as she tried to make plausible answers.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, will every blossom turn into an apple?"</p>

<p>"No, Berthe, not every one."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, the branches would break under such a load, and there
would not be barrels or cellars big enough to hold them all if
every flower were to bear fruit."</p>

<p>"But who decides, mademoiselle? Who says which shall turn into
apples?"</p>

<p>"God knows," thought Henriette, watching Berthe and Raynald
skipping before her as gay with spring and new grass as the young
lambs in the sheepfold. "God knows the answer to that
question!"</p>

<p>And then it was summer again with long, warm days of dappled
sunlight on lawns and in the beechwoods. Roses filled the great
rooms with sweetness, and the countryside was brilliant with the
flames of poppies in fields of wheat. The three Praslin daughters
returned from the convent, and the two elder sons and their tutor
arrived; but the Duchesse lingered in Paris, to Henriette's relief.
The Duc had a way of appearing without warning, for a day or a
week, and as usual his coming brought an air of holiday to the
entire household.</p>

<p>His old mother had taken up residence in one of the wings of the
ch&acirc;teau, and Henriette found her presence comforting. Besides
being an indulgent and devoted grandmother she was a woman of
remarkable character&mdash;gentle but firm, and with unusual
simplicity for one of her position. Henriette came to enjoy the
daily visits to her rooms, and before many weeks a genuine
attachment had developed between these two women of such varying
ages and backgrounds.</p>

<p>Their friendship seemed to please the Duc, and often on his
visits he joined them in his mother's apartments. Since that snowy
drive on New Year's Eve Henriette had had few opportunities to be
alone with him. He took his meals with the children and was likely
to turn up in nursery or schoolroom at any time of day without
warning. But he seemed absorbed and withdrawn and seldom expressed
himself on any subject that did not concern their welfare. Yet
always when Henriette saw his height and fairness dominating the
room she felt a new animation. Between the visits she found herself
storing up remarks of the children, or even observations of her own
to tell him at his next appearance. It was reward enough to hear
his deep laugh or to see his face light up in pleased response.
More and more the stimulation of a masculine audience charmed her;
more and more she felt restless and depressed when she was thrown
back upon her own resources. At first she would not admit the
change. She had always been happy in her independence and
self-sufficiency. What had come over her so insidiously? Why was
she always straining her ears for the tread of a man's foot on the
threshold, for the sound of a deep, resonant voice speaking her
name?</p>

<p>"My dear son holds you in high regard," the dowager Duchesse
told her more than once. "It was a fortunate day indeed for us all
when you came into the household."</p>

<p>As she murmured a grateful reply, Henriette could not help a
pang that the words sounded so impersonal. "High regard" certainly
should be all a governess could ask, and yet she asked for
something less formal.</p>

<p>"Fool," she told herself as she recalled them on those mornings
when she woke early and lay fearful of her own crowding thoughts
while birds sang with maddening cheerfulness in the branches of the
Praslin oaks outside her windows. "Fool, what more do you
want?"</p>

<p>All went peacefully and well through the month of June; and even
when the Duchesse arrived she seemed less irritable, more calm and
pleasant in her dealings with the children.</p>

<p>"She has accepted me at last," Henriette decided. "Perhaps she
is happier with him now, and I need no longer walk on
egg-shells."</p>

<p>But it was a short-lived hope, and presently the ch&acirc;teau
rocked to echoes of dissension. The Duchesse, who had begun by
joining the group about the dining-room table in the children's
wing, rose abruptly from her place one morning and refused to
return. When Henriette brought the two younger ones to their
mother's salon at tea time they found her red-eyed and querulous on
her sofa. She embraced Raynald with such vehemence that the child
struggled to be free and ran to the protection of mademoiselle.
When Berthe, reluctantly following instructions, presented her
mother with a bouquet of wild flowers, the Duchesse roused herself
to a slight show of interest and drew the little girl close.</p>

<p>"For you, Mamma," piped Berthe dutifully, turning her eyes
towards Henriette for approval.</p>

<p>"Did you gather them for me all by yourself, my Berthe?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was mademoiselle's idea. Mademoiselle knows how to fix
flowers better thin F&eacute;lix even, doesn't she, Mamma?"</p>

<p>The Duchesse laid the bouquet aside without further enthusiasm,
and when the three took their leave half an hour later the delicate
ferns and blue chicory were already drooping for lack of water.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't Mamma like you, mademoiselle?" Berthe asked
suddenly as they neared the schoolroom.</p>

<p>"Yes," Raynald chimed in before she could answer. "Why doesn't
she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're wrong about that." Henriette tried to pass off the
questions lightly. "Your mamma is often ill and tired, and perhaps
that makes her seem different from other people."</p>

<p>"But I like you when I'm ill and tired," persisted Raynald. "I
like you even more if I'm sick."</p>

<p>She bent down and gathered his soft dark head into the crook of
her arm. He was growing tall and spindling for his age, but still
he turned to her with the same affection of the frail child she had
nursed through that dread siege of diphtheria.</p>

<p>"It's nicer when just you and Papa are here." Berthe went on
pronouncing judgment in her firm nine-year voice. "I wish she
wouldn't go to the f&ecirc;te at Melun."</p>

<p>Of late there had been much talk of the coming festival of Saint
Ambrose, an event which meant much to the whole countryside since
the old Roman saint was the special patron of the village and
neighbouring hamlets The festival was familiar to the older
Praslins, but this year Berthe and Raynald had been given
permission to attend. There would be services in the old stone
church and later merrymaking in the village with travelling shows
and gaily decked booths where all manner of knick-knacks might be
bought. Henriette had heard nothing for weeks past but the wonders
in store for them on Saint Ambrose's f&ecirc;te day.</p>

<p>Fortunately the weather stayed cloudless and fine, though so
warm that the Duc shook his head over his coffee and said the
horses would be in a lather before they were half-way to the
village, and he himself would prefer to spend the day swimming in
the river with his boys. But no festival would be complete without
Praslins in attendance. He would ride ahead with the older boys on
horseback and the landau and barouche would be ready for the rest
at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>"Will Madame la Duchesse attend?" Henriette asked as he rose to
go.</p>

<p>"Most certainly. The Duchesse has missed only one celebration
since the year we were married. That was the summer after Raynald's
birth, when she was too ill to attend."</p>

<p>Henriette felt pleased with her reflection in the glass as she
tied the ribbons of her leghorn bonnet under her chin. Flat green
leaves wreathed the crown and were stitched under the brim. They
gave a greenish reflection to her eyes and brought out the sheen of
her chestnut hair. Her dress of grey lawn looked cool and crisp
with its wide sash and narrower bands of green grosgrain. Hoops,
she reflected, were becoming larger and larger, but she dared not
go too far in that direction. Governesses were taking up too much
room as it was. She dabbed cologne on her handkerchief and stepped
out to join the children. They looked like delightful human
versions of butterflies, she thought, in their billowing dotted
Swiss muslins and sashes of blue and pink and mauve; and Raynald
was resplendent in nankeen trousers and coat with scarlet
braid.</p>

<p>"How fine you look!" she exclaimed. "Be careful of those skirts
getting in and out of the carriage. You especially, Louise,
remember to smooth the folds as you sit down. Stand still, Berthe,
while I tighten your sash. Now, my dears"&mdash;she faced them with
firmness as they trooped about her towards the door&mdash;"whatever
your mamma wishes about seating in the carriages, you must do as
she says. No protests, please, you understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle," they chorused obediently.</p>

<p>But Raynald kept tight hold of her hand as they descended the
stairs. She sighed and hoped they would all keep their promises.
Sometimes devotion made difficulties, and she wanted the day to go
well.</p>

<p>The carriages were waiting, horses and harnesses decked with
green garlands and wild flowers in honour of the day. These already
drooped in the intensity of the sun. Even at eleven in the morning
the heat was oppressive. Henriette opened her small parasol and
tried to keep Raynald under its shade. She dreaded the long drive
in the dust and glare for him and the undue excitement of crowds
and fair booths. There was a long wait before the Duchesse
appeared, large and impressive in lilac silk. Henriette did not
envy her the mammoth hoop skirts swelling in fashionable fullness.
She was thankful not to be carrying such a decorative load in the
heat and close quarters of the carriages. The Duchesse, she
noticed, was so tightly laced that she moved with discomfort. Her
usually pale face was suffused with warmth, and beads of moisture
showed on her brow and along her upper lip.</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle!" She paused by the open landau, her face
drawing into an annoyed frown. "I did not think you were planning
to go with us. Perhaps you did not know that this is a church
festival?"</p>

<p>Henriette realised from the tone that this was to be one of the
Duchesse's difficult days. She must be careful not to give offence,
even though the remark was humiliating before the children and
coachmen.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Madame," she spoke quietly. "I understood that I was to
drive with the children in one carriage, but naturally I will not
intrude in the church service. If you wish I can wait with the
horses till it's time to return."</p>

<p>She hoped her irony was not lost on the other woman.</p>

<p>"That's impossible," snapped the Duchesse, allowing herself to
be helped into the seat. "But, no matter since I wasn't consulted
about plans, you may as well get in." She waved towards the other
carriage and singled out the children she wished to have with her.
"Raynald," she called, "there's room for you on the seat opposite,
only take care not to put your boots in my lap. Berthe, Louise,
Isabella and Marie, get in the other carriage."</p>

<p>Raynald clung tightly to Henriette's hand; and his mother spoke
more sharply, pointing to the narrow seat behind the driver's
box.</p>

<p>"Madame"&mdash;Henriette stepped quickly to the
carriage&mdash;"if you'll let me make a suggestion, riding
backwards never agrees with Raynald. You know his delicate stomach,
and in all this heat&mdash;perhaps Berthe or one of the others
could sit there instead."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, mademoiselle, I know how to plan for my children.
Jean, lift Monsieur Raynald to the seat, and let's have no more
delays and discussions."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. Henriette saw a struggling
small boy hoisted to the seat and heard his protests as the
carriage rolled ahead of theirs out of the long driveway. It had
not been an auspicious beginning for the feast day of Saint
Ambrose.</p>

<p>The drive, which usually delighted her with its vistas of river
and wood, of farms and fields of ripening grain, seemed endless to
her that morning. She scarcely heard the girls' chatter as their
carriage followed behind the dusty cloud the other stirred before
them. When they drew up by the little church she sent her charges
to join the rest while she found a shady spot under a tree at the
edge of the enclosure. She was glad to sink down on an old stone
bench, to be alone and cool off in body and spirit.</p>

<p>Noon Mass had already begun. She could hear the faint ringing of
the bell; the chanting of voices and responses coming from the open
doors and windows, all dim and far removed as if they sounded from
the bottom of the sea, like that sunken city of legend. If sailors
heard that ringing of lost bells under leagues of salt water, they
crossed themselves and put back for the safety of shore. Yes, that
was the story they told along the coasts of England and Brittany.
Perhaps she, too, was being warned all these miles inland.</p>

<p>But she shook herself free of such thoughts. The heat and
Madame's unreasonableness were enough to set her nerves on edge.
She must try to relax and prepare herself for the ordeal of the
travelling shows and booths which she could see had already
appeared like mushrooms on the village square. She untied her
bonnet ribbons and leaned back, closing her eyes against the glare.
But she opened them again almost instantly at a sound of
footsteps.</p>

<p>The Duc was hurrying from the church with Raynald in his arms.
One look at the child's limp figure told her the story. She sprang
up and hurried towards them.</p>

<p>"Lay him flat, monsieur, here on the grass. I know what to do
for him. Here, <i>ch&eacute;ri,</i> let mademoiselle help you.
You'll be better soon."</p>

<p>"I saw him growing paler and paler in there," she heard the Duc
saying while she loosened the child's coat and steadied his head
through the nausea. "There was nothing to do but get him out
quickly. What's come over him since breakfast? He seemed well
enough then:"</p>

<p>"I was afraid of this," she explained. "The drive was very hot
and dusty, and then riding backwards always upsets him. Now,
monsieur, if you'll lend me your handkerchief we'll make him more
comfortable. Luckily I brought some cologne in my bag."</p>

<p>"But he shouldn't have been allowed to ride backwards. Wasn't
there room enough on the other seat?"</p>

<p>"In our carriage, yes, but his mother wished him with her. I
tried to tell her it would disagree with him. The excitement of the
day hasn't helped either. There, Raynald, doesn't that smell nice?
You needn't try to move. Just lie still with your head on my
lap."</p>

<p>The Duc said nothing more, but turned quickly in the direction
of the village inn. Henriette waited with the child, hoping that
Mass would not be over till his father's return. Presently the
carriage drew up; and Raynald was being carried out to it. He
leaned limply against her, too sick to protest at leaving the feast
day celebration.</p>

<p>"I'll manage now, monsieur," Henriette said as the Duc stood
uncertainly by the steps. "There's no need to spoil the others' day
because of this."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;he still hesitated, frowning and drumming impatient
fingers on the carriage door&mdash;"I suppose that's the best plan.
The Duchesse and I have always made it a point to appear at this
festival, and I shouldn't want the villagers to think anything was
amiss."</p>

<p>He gave an order to the coachman to return and stood watching
their carriage roll away.</p>

<p>Thinking over his words on the hot drive back to the
ch&acirc;teau, Henriette tried to decide what lay behind them. He
had been reluctant to stay. That was plain. But he and the Duchesse
must be seen together by all the countryside, ostensibly a devoted
husband and wife with their children about them.</p>

<p>"On the feast day of Saint Ambrose they celebrated Mass and went
about the village arm in arm, dispensing gifts and going from stall
to stall."</p>

<p>That was what the villagers would tell one another afterwards.
They would remark on the Duc's strength and good looks and on the
Duchesse's pious, generosity. Henriette gave a rather wry smile and
tilted her parasol to keep the sun out of Raynald's eyes.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, when the sun laid long golden shafts on the
brilliant green of the lawns and the oaks rose tall from their own
dark shadows, when a light wind brought refreshing coolness,
Henriette went out to walk on the broad terrace. Raynald had fallen
into exhausted sleep, and the place was deserted save for the Duc's
mother in her wing of the ch&acirc;teau. Henriette would have liked
to pay a call upon the kind old lady, but she feared to alarm her
by this early return from the village. So she walked alone,
watching the surrounding woods grow shadowy, hearing the birds call
with small, watery cries above the splashing of the fountains. She
tried to give herself to the greenness and peace about her. But she
felt tired. Her head ached from the sultry atmosphere and the long
drives, and she dreaded the return of the family.</p>

<p>They were upon her before she realised that the carriages had
turned into the drive, the two older boys on horseback beside their
father. "Mademoiselle, wait, mademoiselle!" The girls' voices
shrilled above the carriage wheels and horses' hoofs on the gravel.
They were out in a swirl of muslin, hurrying to reach her with
out-stretched hands. Henriette glanced towards the carriages and
saw a heavy figure in mauve being helped down. Something about that
distant shape filled her with misgivings. Even so far off she felt
that the heaviness was not all physical. She hoped the Duchesse
would go in at once, but instead she saw her stand quite still,
watching the rush of white-clad girls who sped away from her
without a single backward glance.</p>

<p>"Yes, Berthe, it's a beautiful handkerchief, Did you really buy
it for me at the Fair? Louise, what a pretty chain! And a whistle
and knife for Raynald&mdash;that will make up to him for missing
it."</p>

<p>She heard her voice responding to them, but all the time her
ears were strained for something else. She dared not lift her eyes
again to the driveway and that other figure.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," she thought, "will this day never be
over?"</p>

<p>She and the group of chattering girls were half-way up the long
staircase when a sound made them all stop short and draw close in a
startled group. It rose from below, a terrible mingling of sobs and
laughter. Then broken, hysterical words.</p>

<p>"No, no, don't touch me, Theo! Leave me alone. I'm used to that.
I've had enough. You'll see I meant what I said!"</p>

<p>Somehow Henriette found herself and the children upstairs in the
familiar quiet of the schoolroom. Berthe clung fast to her skirts;
and the older girls turned large, frightened eyes upon her for
reassurance. Her hands shook as she laid their gifts on the table,
though she managed to keep her voice steady and matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>"Now, my dears," she heard it saying, "this has been a long, hot
day for you all. Better go to your rooms and make yourselves fresh
and tidy. Then we'll have time to read another chapter in our book
before supper."</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle, I'd rather stay here with you, please."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, did you hear just now? Mamma was very strange all
this afternoon, and she wouldn't speak to us on the way home."</p>

<p>"Well, Isabella, she was probably tired, nothing more."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it was much more! And I heard her tell Papa that she
would ki&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Henriette laid quick fingers to the quivering young
lips. "Whatever she may have said, she didn't mean you to hear.
Now, go to your rooms, all of you, at once."</p>

<p>Supper was a strangely quiet meal. Instead of eager voices
interrupting one another with accounts of the f&ecirc;te day, the
girls sat subdued and large-eyed round the table. Even when
Henriette opened a box of sweetmeats as an unusual treat, their
enthusiasm was perfunctory. She found herself listening
unconsciously for sounds beyond the children's quarters.</p>

<p>She knew he would come, but when he did she could hardly lift
her eyes to meet his.</p>

<p>"What long faces here!" He went through the motions of a smile
and greetings, pinching Isabella's cheeks and drawing Louise to him
with a pretence of gaiety. But Henriette saw that his face was
grave in spite of the forced smile. She saw, too, that he held his
right arm rigid and kept that hand thrust into the front of his
coat.</p>

<p>"Mamma has gone to bed with one of her migraine headaches." He
made light of the anxious questions. "The heat and crowds were too
much for her. She sends you her good-night."</p>

<p>After the younger ones had left for bed, Henriette sent the two
older sisters into the adjoining room to practise piano and
penmanship. She and he were alone at last, though the precise notes
of a minuet executed by Isabella's painstaking fingers sounded
above their words. The long blue twilight of early summer filled
the room, making the Duc's face seem unnaturally pale and
strained.</p>

<p>"Oh, monsieur!" She sank down on the window seat and leaned
towards him. Their faces were on a level though the table separated
them. "Tell me the truth. She did not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No." He shook his head wearily. "She did not harm herself. I
don't know how much you heard, but, thank God, you got the children
out of the way."</p>

<p>His voice was low and almost monotonous as he told her of the
Duchesse's attempt to kill herself; of the Arabian dagger kept as a
curio in the drawing-room which she had caught up in her frenzy.
Somehow he had managed to gain possession of it. Listening to his
brief words, it seemed to her that he dared not let himself speak
fully of the tragedy he had so lately averted.</p>

<p>"What has happened to you, monsieur?" She pointed to the hand he
still held inside his coat. Her voice, also, was low, but the
thumping notes of the paino could not cover its tense concern. "Why
do you keep your hand so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that! It's nothing, but I did not want to frighten the
children."</p>

<p>Reluctantly he drew out his hand. She saw that it was bandaged
and that a dark stain had oozed through the lint. Her own hand
shook as she laid it gently on his. The gesture had been
instinctive; only when she felt that live heat under her cold
fingers did she realise her rashness.</p>

<p>"Your hand is throbbing and feverishly hot." She wondered as she
spoke if he had felt her tremble. "You're sure it's not
serious?"</p>

<p>"Only a cut in the palm, but that old blade was sharper than I
thought."</p>

<p>He made no move to take his hand away, and she seemed to have
lost the power to lift hers. How long they might have stayed so,
she did not know; but the piano came to an abrupt stop in the next
room, and Henriette roused herself.</p>

<p>"Try the polanaise now, Isabella," she called. "It's not time to
stop yet."</p>

<p>When the notes began again, Henriette folded her own hands
tightly in her lap before she turned back to the Duc.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she began, "if anything I said or did was the cause
you mustn't try to spare my feelings."</p>

<p>"The cause goes deeper than anything you could have said or
done." He sighed and brushed a moist lock of hair from his
forehead. "It always comes back to me."</p>

<p>She did not offer more words, but sat quietly, waiting for him
to go on.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have spoken as I did. But, Mademoiselle Deluzy,
when I saw the boy suffer because of her petty jealousy I couldn't
keep silence; and I said&mdash;Well, I hardly know what I said. If
it had been one of the other children, not Raynald&mdash;but his
frailness has always been a reproach to me. I've tried to make up
to him for what I hope he will never know&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, and she was wise enough to keep silence. But her
mind caught at his words. The hesitant, blurred phrases became
suddenly open admissions to her now. Raynald, she guessed, must
stand for his father as the living symbol of a love that had been
revived briefly from cold embers. Almost, she felt, that youngest
child had been a last defiant gesture of the Duchesse to prove that
she still had power to breathe those embers into flame. So plain
was it all to her in that moment that she seemed to see the other
woman blowing frantically upon an actual fire. No use to do that
now, to stir dead ashes tirelessly day and night: didn't she know,
when love was burned out, it could never be rekindled in such a
fashion?</p>

<p>"Monsieur"&mdash;she spoke at last with quiet
directness&mdash;"what's to be done? Things cannot go on this
way&mdash;for her, for you, for me, or for the children."</p>

<p>A helpless gesture was the only answer.</p>

<p>"It's better that I should go," she persisted. "Perhaps if I
leave now she will be happier. You may even become reconciled in
time."</p>

<p>"That's impossible!" He roused himself from his absorption, and
his voice had the old authoritative note. "What is dead and done
can't be brought to life. I'm not pretending to be above reproach.
I do not play the martyr. I leave all that to her. If it gives her
any comfort to seem the pious, injured wife, I'm not interfering.
But the children&mdash;they're another matter. They're alive, and I
can't make them suffer for what is no fault of theirs. For their
sakes and for mine you must not talk of leaving."</p>

<p>"There's an old saying I heard in my childhood," she told him,
"and I've been remembering it to-night. To cause trouble between
man and wife is like coming between the bark and the tree."</p>

<p>He smiled, but there was a wry twist to his lips.</p>

<p>"When the bark and the tree are no longer one, Mademoiselle
Deluzy, when they are miles apart, your saying has no meaning."</p>

<p>"Well, monsieur, I don't pretend to know your heart, or
Madame's; but I know she hates me, and the children know it, and
sooner or later there will be more tragedy like this that so nearly
happened to-day."</p>

<p>"Even so I am asking you to stay. If you saw someone drowning,
wouldn't you reach out a hand to help? Wouldn't you try to free an
animal caught in a trap? Well, then, remember that I am trapped in
a snare of my own making&mdash;at least I've had a share in it; and
the more I struggle, the tighter it closes round me. You may see me
moving freely about, but don't he deceived. I'm in hell, whether
you believe in such a place or not."</p>

<p>"Oh, please!" She was moved by his quiet intensity. "What can I
say when you speak such words? I only know she loves you, and when
she tortures you and others it's because she must be goaded by her
terrible need of you. Being a woman, too, I can understand that,
though I cannot understand these shocking exhibitions&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, fearful that she had gone too far.</p>

<p>"You're right, Mademoiselle Deluzy. Love turned back on itself
becomes a disease that corrupts all it touches. I know too well,
too well." Wearily he let his head rest in his hands, and the
bandage showed white in the gathering dimness of the room. "But I
hope you will never understand what it is to be slowly smothered by
a love one is no longer capable of returning."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have presumed to speak of love at all," she
apologised. "I had no right, and I ask you to forget it."</p>

<p>"No, don't ask that because it will help if I can remember your
sympathy for my plight. To-day, when this nightmare was over, I was
afraid to be alone. I came here as I have come before when it
seemed that I couldn't face the future, not even for another
hour."</p>

<p>Though he did not raise his face from his hands, the intimacy,
the appeal in his words made her heart set up a wild beating. She
dared not trust herself to speak, and presently he went on.</p>

<p>"It seems a little thing to ask for peace in my home. But
instead I stand like a bull in a ring, badgered by darts that prick
him to fury. Some day one goes in too deep, and then the blood is
up. I live in dread of that day."</p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet, and his great height and strength,
his physical presence took possession of the place. She did not
herself rise. Her knees felt too weak, and her pulses still
throbbed. She sat staring up at him as he stood staring down at
her.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "now you know."</p>

<p>"What one knows, it is useful sometimes to forget, monsieur."
Still he loomed above her.</p>

<p>"You haven't said whether you will stay. But you will, won't
you? You aren't going to deny me and the children the only
sanctuary we have?"</p>

<p>"You make it very hard to say no," she heard her voice
answering. "But there are some things in this world it's useless to
fight against, and one is another woman's jealousy. God knows I've
done nothing to earn it except to win the children's devotion and
your&mdash;your confidence in me. But that's an unpardonable sin in
her eyes, and she will never forgive me. If I stay because you ask
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am asking it of you. You have many gifts, Mademoiselle
Deluzy, but none that I admire so much as your courage to face
issues."</p>

<p>"It takes courage to live by one's wits. It teaches one to be
practical. I'm trying my best to be practical now, though you make
it difficult."</p>

<p>He saw that she was weakening, and he pressed her in her own
words. "Let's be practical then," he urged. "There is only one
reason to make you go, and there are ten reasons to keep you
here."</p>

<p>"Ten reasons?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mademoiselle Deluzy, nine young Praslins and their father.
Shall I count them on my fingers for you?"</p>

<p>He smiled, and she smiled back. But, for all that, their voices
remained grave.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, you needn't trouble to do that." Then, without
hesitation, she went on, her voice low and more serious than
before. "You have asked this of me, and that is reason enough. If
you had tried to bribe or drive a bargain with me I shouldn't have
yielded against my better judgment."</p>

<p>He was touched by her response. She knew that even before he
spoke.</p>

<p>"We don't drive bargains after we've opened our hearts," he told
her. "And remember, to be beloved is above all bargains.
Good-night, Mademoiselle Deluzy."</p>

<p>He did not wait for her reply, but turned to go to his daughters
in the next room. On the threshold he paused and Henriette saw him
lift his injured hand and slip it awkwardly into his coat again.
The gesture went to her heart.</p>

<h3>Chapter Twelve</h3>

<p>Outwardly nothing was changed. The long bright days of summer
slid on into autumn. Lessons continued with the regularity of
clockwork. The Duc travelled to Paris at intervals and returned,
always well groomed and debonair, always thoughtful and generous
towards his children, and considerate of their governess. The
Duchesse remained aloof from the activities of nursery and
schoolroom, making few of those disastrous advances to force the
affections of her offspring. More and more she withdrew into
herself, and her full face took on a sultry expression of martyrdom
that Henriette found irritating, but less difficult than the old
unrestrained outbursts.</p>

<p>But Henriette knew herself to be changed. A cycle of her life
was over as surely as if she had shed for ever some grey, confining
chrysalis of youth. It had begun on a spring morning three years
before when she had first crossed the threshold of Number 55, Rue
du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, to take her orders, not from a
pale, petulant woman on a chaise-longue, but from the tall man in a
dressing-gown who stood beside the fireplace, and it had ended in
that twilight schoolroom on the feast day of Saint Ambrose. Since
that talk she could never be the same. She only marvelled, as she
stared at her face in the mirror, that she could find no tangible
marks of her new maturity.</p>

<p>She had no explanation to offer to herself, for she had lost the
ability to analyse her own feelings. Always before, her mind and
heart had been kept as tidy and well ordered as her bureau drawers,
the contents carefully sorted and useless or disturbing souvenirs
ruthlessly discarded. Now she acknowledged her powerlessness to
bring order out of inner confusion. In the year 1844 a young woman
of her background and moral standards would not have confessed to
interest in a married man; much less would she have dared to admit
even the possibility of such love. Henriette did not admit it now.
Knowing herself to be an acknowledged spinster of nearly thirty-two
years, she felt humble and ignorant upon the subject of love. And
it was not natural for her to be either humble or ignorant on any
subject. She had spoken truthfully in telling the Duc that life had
taught her to be practical. She was trying her best to be practical
now, even against this strange new restlessness and elation that
possessed her. She felt proud that he had turned to her in his
extremity&mdash;this man who of all his kind on earth could never
be hers. But pride could not completely account for the change in
her, for shifting moods of unreasoning despair and sheer,
inexplicable delight. Once she had been able to think of the past,
painful though much of its lonely striving had been; she had also
been able to think ahead, to plan for a future that she would make
secure through her own efforts. Now she could not concentrate on
past or future. Only the present seemed to count in those timeless
garments of days and nights which she put on and off like one
walking in sleep.</p>

<p>"But this cannot be love," she reasoned with herself sometimes,
and she really believed what she said.</p>

<p>Love was something altogether different if one could go by
romantic novels and certain poems of Lord Byron not approved as
reading for young ladies. Love couldn't be this urgent unrest, this
sense of a volcano about to erupt common sense into fragments. It
couldn't be this asking for nothing beyond the quick response of a
smile, of a look or words that implied complete understanding, of a
jest that had no humour except when shared with the one other
person who held the key to its meaning. Love, she was certain,
asked much more than this which seemed to be all that mattered to
her of late. One ought to feel exalted by love, lifted high above
oneself and one's surroundings. Yet here she was, if anything, more
acutely aware of every smallest detail that concerned herself and
those about her. Why think of love at all? Certainly in that tense,
troubled conversation which she returned to again and again she
could not find any allusion the Duc had made to it that had not
been bitter, except just at the last. "To be beloved," he had said,
"is above all bargains." And that might mean so much or so little.
Probably, she decided, he was thinking of the children and their
devotion to her. One thing only she dared to admit&mdash;that he
had turned to her for help, and that she would never fail him.</p>

<p>Only when she and the Duchesse met was she conscious of a new
assurance in herself. It no longer mattered to her whether she
faced approval or disapproval. Tirades of suspicion and accusations
might be hurled upon her, but they left her unshaken. Her
indifference acted like a goad to the Corsican temperament, but
since the night of the Duchesse's attempted suicide Henriette could
summon neither anger nor pity for this other woman whose violent
exhibitions disgusted her with their lack of pride and personal
dignity. She would stand quietly under the furious flow of words
and reproaches or the sighs of self-pity&mdash;to all outward
appearances listening respectfully, but inwardly so chill with
contempt that she felt frozen from head to foot. The heavy-lidded
dark eyes might flash, the white, ring-laden hands might be wrung,
but Henriette would retire unmoved by the spectacle. The servants
might be ranged against her. No matter, she would return to her
duties with a light step and renewed confidence.</p>

<p>"There's not another governess in Paris or England who works
harder or has more obstacles to contend with than I," she would
argue. "In the three years and a half since I entered this house
there's not been a word or an act of mine she or any of them could
use against me. If she's half out of her mind with jealousy it's
because she's afraid to blame herself for losing him; and if the
servants have spying eyes and evil tongues it's no affair of mine.
I'll go my own way. They shan't humiliate me to please
themselves."</p>

<p>She reasoned truly and with conviction, but she left one
important factor out of her calculations. The science of
mathematics had always been a difficult one for her to master. In
algebra she had particularly disliked those problems dealing with
X, the unknown quantity. In life, being honest and idealistic and
free from a spirit of malice, she reckoned her problem without
taking scandal into account. And scandal has a way of catching up
with those who disregard its power.</p>

<p>She was therefore quite unprepared when the bolt fell.</p>

<p>They had stayed late at the ch&acirc;teau that year, returning
to Paris for the holidays. After a brief outing at Cannes the
Duchesse rejoined her family, refreshed and in better humour than
for many months. Christmas had passed off without discord and with
elaborate gifts for all, including Mademoiselle Deluzy. The
Duchesse had been more affable, and temporarily at least the
household seemed calm and the children responding to the more
normal atmosphere. Their grandfather, the old Mar&eacute;chal
S&eacute;bastiani, was travelling in Spain, and Henriette hoped he
would remain away another month, for he was a disrupting influence
in the house. His presence always irritated the Duc, and his
concern over the Duchesse's health and happiness only made her more
difficult and self-centred. As for the children, he spoiled them by
all manner of indulgences and upset the carefully planned scheme of
their lessons and recreations.</p>

<p>Henriette had greater responsibility now that the three middle
sisters were through their convent studies and in her care. These
girls, C&eacute;leste, Am&eacute;lie and Marie, would never be as
near to her as the others, with whom she had been so closely
associated since her coming. They were pretty and docile, but
without the marked personalities of Isabella and Louise and the
captivating Berthe. Monsieur Remey continued to instruct all the
daughters in literature, grammar and composition, while Henriette
taught them history, painting, embroidery and superintended their
piano practice. She also chaperoned them on their walks and drives
and on visits to such places of amusement as were felt to be
appropriate to carefully guarded <i>jeunes filles.</i> Besides this
she continued to teach Raynald his lessons. He was unusually
precocious for seven and, though his health had improved greatly,
he still needed constant watching. Only Mademoiselle Deluzy could
keep him interested and amused without overtaxing his strength. So
he remained her most loved and most complex charge.</p>

<p>Isabella, nearing her eighteenth birthday, and Louise, at
sixteen, had bloomed into charming young ladies, fulfilling the
possibilities that Henriette had foreseen under their adolescent
awkwardness. The Duc was enormously proud of his two elder
daughters with their shining dark hair and eyes and delicately
moulded oval faces. Already he spoke to Henriette of their future
husbands and what manner of men would best suit their different
tastes and dispositions. It was strange to her to discuss this with
him, and yet she felt pleased and touched at his own
confidences.</p>

<p>"They must be happy," he would say, following their youthfully
rounded figures with a half-admiring, half-anxious expression. "At
least we must see that they have every chance at happiness from the
start."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, monsieur, happiness isn't to be bought or given
away in prize, packages," she would remind him, feeling her heart
contract as she spoke of such things to a man who seemed too young
to be the father of girls already of marriageable age. "But you're
right in making certain that there will be no clash of
temperaments. I think Isabella will be harder to please than
Louise. She's more decided in her views and less adaptable to
circumstance."</p>

<p>"She's stubborn as a Corsican donkey, you mean," he would laugh.
"But if she once gives her devotion she's loyal."</p>

<p>"And very methodical," Henriette would insist. "Oh, yes, she can
be trusted to take great responsibilities. Louise, now, will always
shed them like water, and she's too careless and easy-going for her
own good."</p>

<p>"Yes, Louise will need a firm hand at the check rein. The man
who marries her will never know what fancy may take her next; but
she'll keep him amused at any rate. Heigh-ho! I must be bestirring
myself soon with such pretty daughters. Still, I don't believe in
too early marriages."</p>

<p>Always, she noticed, he would end these conversations with some
such remark, as if the subject stirred too many personal memories
to be continued.</p>

<p>Those weeks after the holidays were crowded with plans and
projects. Isabella and Louise especially wanted to go here, there
and everywhere. Each day they begged Henriette to accompany them on
this excursion or that, rebelling against their own lessons and
those of the younger children. One treat, however, had been
promised to which she was not invited. The Duchesse had a box at
the opera, and Isabella and Louise and the two eldest sons were to
attend a performance of the great Meyerbeer's <i>Les Huguenots.</i>
The brothers showed little enthusiasm for this treat, but as the
evening approached Isabella and Louise were in a fever of
expectation. Their dresses of white net over rose taffeta were laid
out in readiness with their gloves and slippers and velvet-hooded
cloaks when word was sent down by Madame Leclerc that their mother
had been seized with one of her severe headaches and would not be
able to attend. It would be necessary for Mademoiselle Deluzy to
accompany the party.</p>

<p>Almost as excited by this magnificent prospect as the two girls,
Henriette hurried through supper and prepared the best toilette
possible on such short notice. She had been especially active that
day, but weariness fell from her as she bathed and curled her hair
and took out the dress of apricot mull, banded in blue, which she
had not yet worn. The neck-line was cut lower than any she had
owned before, and her throat showed white and almost as youthful as
the girls'. She had no jewels, but the dress fitted perfectly and
that, she reflected as she took a last look in her mirror, was far
more important.</p>

<p>"No one," she thought with satisfaction as she caught up her
cloak and hurried to join the waiting group in the schoolroom,
"would take me for a governess or a poor relation!"</p>

<p>The girls were more than satisfying in their admiration and
seemed almost to have read her thoughts.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful dress, mademoiselle!" exclaimed the critical
Isabella. "Doesn't she look lovely, Louise?"</p>

<p>"They'll think you're our sister to-night," Louise impulsively
decided. "Let's act as if you were when people stare at us through
their glasses."</p>

<p>Henriette quickly discouraged this idea, but as she marshalled
them down to the carriage, she could not help feeling flattered at
the na&iuml;ve suggestion.</p>

<p>As they entered, a peculiar air of brilliance and expectancy
pervaded the Opera House, and they soon learned from the attendant
who unlocked their box and helped them with their wraps that this
was to be a great night indeed since the King would attend in
person. The Royal Box was already decorated, and the young Praslins
were enchanted to discover that their own directly faced it.
Henriette smiled at their eagerness. It was plain that the stage
and singers would meet with a serious rival.</p>

<p>"If Papa only were here," Louise sighed, "it would be much
better because he knows the King, and they'd probably exchange
bows; and then every one in the house would be envious of us."</p>

<p>"Ho! I've seen the King," bragged her brother Louis, "and he's
not much to look at. You'd never guess he was a king if you didn't
know and see all the guards."</p>

<p>The curtain had been up, and the first act was more than half
through when royalty entered. Cheers sounded from crowds outside
the doors, and the house rustled as if a sudden wind had stirred it
while the King and his party were being seated. When the curtain
fell and the house blazed with lights once more, the King rose and
accepted the applause that echoed from below and from tiers of
balconies above. A thick-set, undistinguished man past middle age,
he stood smiling in mechanical acknowledgment. Across his chest a
broad blue ribbon showed along with other decorations; but except
for these he might have been any banker or retired officer
occupying an opera box with his faded wife and a group of sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>"I wonder which princess that is in blue?" Louise was
asking.</p>

<p>"Isn't she pretty, mademoiselle? Oh, look! The curtains are
moving&mdash;someone's coming to our box. Why, it's Papa! What a
surprise!"</p>

<p>Surprise indeed. Henriette knew the Duc's distaste for classical
music, his preferences for the Op&eacute;ra Cornique and lighter
entertainment. But there he was, parting the curtains behind her
chair. He tried to stay in the background, but the girls clustered
about him as he stood conspicuously tall in his evening dress.
Before he could seat himself in the empty sixth seat, their box had
become second in conspicuousness to the royal one.</p>

<p>"Papa, the King! Did you know he'd be here to-night? Was that
why you came?"</p>

<p>"No, Louise, I needn't go to the opera to see the King. I only
wanted to have a glimpse of my daughters in their new costumes
sitting in a box."</p>

<p>He nodded approvingly at the four young people and then turned
to their governess. Although he paid her no spoken compliment she
knew that he also approved of her appearance. His eyes studied her
minutely, lingering at the lines of her bare throat and shoulders.
She felt her cheeks flush under his glance, and a glow of animation
spread over her as it always did whenever he appeared unexpectedly.
How fortunate she had decided to christen the new apricot mull
instead of wearing the green silk he had seen so often!</p>

<p>"Papa, the King is looking at our box," Isabella told him. "I'm
sure he recognises you."</p>

<p>It was true. Royalty was actually bowing and smiling in their
direction. The Duc rose and acknowledged the honour while the
crowded house followed this exchange of greetings. But Henriette
detected an expression of annoyance on his face.</p>

<p>"I should have waited till the lights were lowered for the next
act," he admitted in a low voice under cover of the soaring violins
and deeper-voiced 'cellos and bass viols: "I didn't intend to bring
every eye to our box."</p>

<p>"You'll stay to see us home, monsieur?" she asked. "There will
be a great crowd outside, and I dread getting to the carriage."</p>

<p>"The King will leave first," he explained, "and I know a side
exit. Don't be worried about that."</p>

<p>Those were the only words they spoke together the rest of the
evening, but Henriette was conscious of his presence beside her
till the curtain fell. To the end of her days she could never give
an accurate account of the latter half of <i>Les Huguenots</i>
though she was perfectly clear about the action of the first act.
Driving home in the carriage, they were all crowded close
together.</p>

<p>"Like sardines in a box," he laughed, apologising for crushing
the full skirts of mull and net and taffeta.</p>

<p>"Well," he smiled, bidding them all good-night at the foot of
the staircase, "you must be sure to get your beauty sleep to-morrow
after this evening of dissipation. You must see to that,
Mademoiselle Deluzy, for I'm off in the morning for Marseilles.
It's on a matter of business, and I don't relish the long journey
in this cold winter weather."</p>

<p>Henriette gave little thought to this remark. The Duc was often
away on business or pleasure trips, and since the S&eacute;bastiani
family controlled certain properties near Marseilles she gathered
that he must be attending to his wife's financial interests there.
She missed his visits to the schoolroom those next days, the more
so because cold rains kept them from their daily drives and
exercise. The children's pent-up energy overflowed the rooms; and
Berthe, in particular, grew difficult and fractious. She did not
seem at all like her usual gay self; and Henriette felt her own
patience leaving her under the strain of keeping the child from
interfering with the others. It was especially trying that lessons
should be interrupted in the middle of the morning by Madame
Leclerc with a peremptory summons: Mademoiselle Deluzy would please
present herself to the Duchesse at once.</p>

<p>Something was amiss. She could tell by the superior gleam that
lingered in the eyes of the lady's maid when she delivered the
message. As she hurried along the corridors in answer to it,
Henriette mentally ran through the activities of the last week,
trying to think what offence she could have given. Usually, with
the Duc away, the Duchesse left the children and their governess
alone. Henriette had discovered that it was his physical presence,
above all his preferences of the schoolroom to his wife's private
apartments, that brought on her fits of jealousy. Well, she would
soon learn the reason, even if she could not be forearmed.</p>

<p>She found Madame seated at her writing-desk by the window and
was relieved that her maid was not in evidence. She had come to
gauge this other woman's humour by certain signs, more or less
after the manner of weather-wise sailors watching for the first
storm signals in sea or sky. Instantly she noted that the plump
hands fumbling through a mass of papers were far from steady, and
that the lace and ribbons of the elaborate n&eacute;glig&eacute;
rose and fell with each short, almost panting breath. These and the
fact that the Duchesse did not look up at once, though she had told
her to enter, meant trouble.</p>

<p>"She's dangerous to-day," Henriette decided. "I must be careful.
Perhaps it's nothing really serious."</p>

<p>But when the full lids were raised at last and the dark eyes met
hers, she was not reassured. She could have faced flashing sparks
of rage better than the glazed intensity of this stare.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, Madame," she prompted. Anything to break that
look. Let the storm begin, and let it soon be spent.</p>

<p>"Yes, I sent for you. There is something here for you to read.
It concerns you, mademoiselle, and all of us."</p>

<p>She held out a sheet of newspaper, and her shaking finger
pointed to an item which had been circled in red pencil. Henriette
recognised the paper as one she had often seen displayed on news
stands. It had an unsavoury reputation, and she remembered vaguely
hearing that it supplied malicious social gossip to all Paris. But
even this meagre knowledge did not prepare her for the shock of the
printed words in that red circle:</p>

<blockquote>The Duc and Duchesse de Praslin [she read] are in their
Paris residence for the winter, but as usual this pair are seldom
seen together in public. Lately, however, the Duc has been seen
much in the company of a certain lady of marked personal
attractions. Night before last at the performance of <i>Les
Huguenots,</i> which was attended by the King, he was observed in
his box with four members of his large family and the lady in
question, Mademoiselle D&mdash;&mdash;, who we have learned on
excellent authority has occupied for some time the enviable post of
governess in the household Praslin. The Duchesse, we hear, has not
been enjoying good health, but the Duc from all appearances has
never been better. He has remarkably fine taste and has been long
regarded as a connoisseur in many lines.</blockquote>

<p>The words swam and danced before her eyes as she tried to
re-read the paragraph. "The lady in question, Mademoiselle
D&mdash;&mdash;..." She felt the words sink like leaden weights
into her consciousness, and her voice and even her breath failed
her as she continued to stand holding the paper.</p>

<p>"Now you know why I sent for you."</p>

<p>She heard the Duchesse's voice muffled and far off like the echo
of the sea in a shell. But it rallied her nevertheless, and her
numb senses began to come to her aid almost before she knew she had
summoned them.</p>

<p>"Madame"&mdash;she was startled to find that she had not lost
all power of speech, though she felt cold from head to foot and
could not keep the paper from shaking between her
fingers&mdash;"Madame, this is as much of a shock to me as it must
be to you."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, do you realise what such a paragraph means?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to, Madame." Henriette felt her knees weakening,
but she braced her body against the desk rather than ask for leave
to sit down. '"If you will give me a moment I can explain about the
opera, though I cannot see why such a piece of gossip should have
been directed at me."</p>

<p>"You don't see!" The Duchesse's pent-up feelings were already
loosened in torrents of furious abuse. Listening, Henriette was at
first hardly aware of the words. Then gradually they penetrated her
mind as she steadied herself against the comforting solidity of
that desk.</p>

<p>"Ever since you set foot in my house it's been one insult after
another&mdash;a deliberate campaign on your part to take all that I
love from me&mdash;first the children and now my husband. You've
been diabolically clever, mademoiselle, far more clever than I. But
don't think this smiling, innocent face of yours ever deceived me
for a moment. You can pull wool over Theo's eyes, but not over
mine. I always knew what you were and what schemes you were laying.
But for once you weren't clever enough! Oh, it's intolerable that
you should have dared to plan this last insult, that while I lay
ill at home you flaunted your hold over him in public for the King
and all Paris to see!"</p>

<p>She paused to draw a long, gasping breath; and Henriette seized
her chance to speak. Now that she had reacted from the first shock
all her years of training in self-control came to her aid.</p>

<p>"Please, Madame," she answered with a quietness of manner and
clear conviction that was maddening to her accuser, "let me speak
for myself. I have that right before you pass judgment on me. I
regret this piece of slander as much and more than you. But you
must believe I'm telling the truth when I say I had nothing to do
with the Duc's appearance in the box that night. I went because you
were ill and asked me to take the children. No one was more
surprised than I when he joined our party. Your daughters will tell
you so, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My daughters," the heavy voice broke in. "My daughters whose
minds you have poisoned against their mother. You stand there and
call upon them to repeat lies that their innocence cannot
understand. You're a better actress than I thought, but your
talents are wasted on me. I'll never fall under your spell as they
have."</p>

<p>Henriette laid the newspaper clipping on the desk and clenched
her hands so tightly that her nails cut into the flesh.</p>

<p>"We'll leave the children out, Madame, please."</p>

<p>"It's impossible to leave them out. Not when you've deliberately
taken their affection from me."</p>

<p>"No one can take away affection that does not exist. If your
children have turned to me it's because they're afraid of you and
your violence. One moment you smother them with caresses, and then
if their father so much as touches one of them you resent it. No
wonder they're hurt and bewildered. It's as if"&mdash;Henriette was
speaking her mind at last since there seemed no longer any use in
keeping silence&mdash;"it's as if you seized upon them because
they're fragments of him, like some puzzle you're for ever trying
to put together. No, Madame, I've stolen nothing from you!"</p>

<p>The Duchesse's face had changed from pallor to mottled purple,
and she made an inarticulate, almost animal sound in her throat.
Henriette pointed to the item in the red circle and continued
steadily: "I'll say no more of that, but of this vile insinuation I
can only repeat that there's no truth in it except what I cannot
deny&mdash;that Monsieur le Duc did come to the box and sit with
us. I couldn't very well drive him away, could I?"</p>

<p>The Duchesse's lip curled derisively. "I have not sent for you
to question me, mademoiselle. But I ask you again: Do you know what
this insinuation, as you choose to call it, means?"</p>

<p>"It means that this gossip sheet which I have never stooped to
read before implies that the Duc and I&mdash;well, you force me to
say it in plain terms&mdash;that I am his mistress."</p>

<p>"Exactly. You admit that much."</p>

<p>"I admit nothing, Madame. It's impossible. Even if you imagined
that I would be capable of such a thing, you must see that, living
here as I do with my every move watched and commented upon by the
servants, I've about as much privacy as a goldfish in a globe. You
must believe facts, even if you won't believe me."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps there has been nothing actually wrong between you
and my husband." The duchess was forced to grant that much
grudgingly. "But if you have let it appear otherwise to the world
you must take the consequences. The public believes that you are
what you deny; so for all of us it might as well be so."</p>

<p>"And if it also appears to the world," Henriette continued, "and
to this public whose opinion you value so highly, that you and
monsieur are not on good terms, does that also become a fact
whether there's truth in it or not?"</p>

<p>Henriette's face and voice did not change as she put the
question, though she knew it was the only trump card she held in a
pack that was already stacked against her.</p>

<p>"You dare to say such a thing to me!"</p>

<p>The Duchesse wheeled about in her chair, and her anger seemed
almost visible under the heaving lace and silk that wrapped her
body.</p>

<p>"I only spoke, Madame, because we were both mentioned in the
article. If I have been put in a false position, the same may be
true of you."</p>

<p>"Don't go on coupling our names, and stop talking of the true
and of the false as if you could tell the difference between
them!"</p>

<p>"But I know that there <i>is</i> a difference between what we
are and what people may think we are. Reputation is one thing, and
character is another; and they may be as far apart as the poles.
And now, Madame, I will go and pack my trunk unless you wish me to
stay out the week."</p>

<p>By the time she reached her own room she was shaking so that she
could hardly write legibly the note she sent to Monsieur Remey:</p>

<blockquote>Please, my dear Albert, take over all the lessons
to-day and see that the little ones are occupied. I have a slight
indisposition and will explain the reason to you later.<br>
<br>
H. D.</blockquote>

<p>When the strength returned to her knees and she had warmed her
chill hands at the grate fire, she went to the wardrobe and began
taking down her dresses. Mechanically she laid them on the bed and
turned to the drawers of her bureau. A maid came to inquire of
Mademoiselle Deluzy wished <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> served in her
room; but she shook her head and went on with her work.</p>

<p>"I must call the porter to fetch my portmanteau and band-boxes,"
she reminded herself in the midst of her sorting. "And then there
are the children. I cannot go without seeing them. They mustn't be
upset, especially Raynald."</p>

<p>Presently she stopped her work and went to the little secretary
where she had taken such pleasure in writing and painting. She
would leave a letter for him, so he would understand why he would
not find her here on his return. It was going to be a difficult
letter to write: How could she make clear her side of the ugly
story that would be sure to greet him on the instant of his
arrival? She had never addressed him in writing before, and she
felt suddenly at a loss to tell him of the complexity of feeling
that filled her as she sat in that half-dismantled room where she
had been so happy for nearly four years and which she was being
forced to leave.</p>

<p>How could she tell him without bitterness that the outcome of
her standing firm against the abuses of the Duchesse had been
disaster with herself the target of malicious gossip? Everything
had been against her from the start. She realised that now. The
blow had been dealt when he was not there to help her. She knew he
would always reproach himself for that and for his impulsive
gesture that had been the cause.</p>

<p>Now that her mind was clear again, she knew that the greatest
shock had not been to her pride. The Duchesse's words had not
really pricked beneath the surface, and the ugly implication of
that printed paragraph had not in itself shaken her. But always
before she had believed that the boundary of integrity was her own
conscience, and now she knew that a clear conscience was not enough
in itself. She felt the same helpless futility sweep over her that
she had known as a child when she had been powerless against
injustice.</p>

<p>Once more she dipped her pen and tried another beginning to the
letter; and once more she crumpled the sheet and added it to others
in the waste-basket.</p>

<p>"My dear monsieur," she began simply. "Do not reproach yourself
or others for what has happened. It was impossible to keep my
promise to you, and so when you return you will find me
gone..."</p>

<p>But as she sat among her disordered personal possessions, trying
to summon phrases to her will, a timid knock interrupted, and
Isabella stood beside her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle!" she was saying. "Please come at once. It's
Berthe: she's suddenly very ill, and Maxine doesn't know what to
do. Hurry, mademoiselle&mdash;they need you."</p>

<p>The letter was never finished, and the trunks were never brought
up to be filled, for by midnight Dr. Simon had pronounced Berthe
seriously ill with scarlet fever, and once more Henriette had been
put in command of a sick-room.</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirteen</h3>

<p>During the long weeks of attendance in the sick-room Henriette
had time to consider her situation from all angles, but she reached
no conclusion whatsoever because the matter of her dismissal seemed
to have been forgotten in the concern over Berthe's recovery. When
the child was herself once more, the subject of that newspaper item
was never reopened. If the Duc knew of the scandalous bit of gossip
he never alluded to it. Several times she gave him a chance to
discuss it. But he did not avail himself of the opportunity, and
something in his manner kept her from pressing the subject.</p>

<p>With the Duchesse, too, it was as if it had never been. As if,
Henriette thought, those harsh and bitter words they had both
spoken had been erased by a wave smoothing out ugly markings on a
sandy beach. Time and anxiety for the small invalid must be
responsible. Yet Henriette could not forget what had passed between
herself and the Duchesse. "She said such terrible things to me and
I to her," she often thought. "I'm not sorry I said them. I'm glad
I stood firm upon my rights, but I can't forget; and if I were in
her place I couldn't forget. She's beyond my
comprehension&mdash;roused like a tigress and then forgetful of
what provoked her anger."</p>

<p>No, she could never make the Duchesse out. Whenever she tried
to, her efforts ended in a baffled shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>But, temporarily at least, the sky was clear of thunderclouds;
and spring was in the air once more. The almond tree bloomed in the
garden; and first it was primroses, then violets, and then
daffodils and tulips in the street flower stalls. Perhaps the
Duchesse's habitual cloak of distrust and melancholy had lifted
because of the new element of romance that ran like a spring
freshet through the entire Praslin household.</p>

<p>Isabella was betrothed. In six months she would marry the son of
a rich and important business man of excellent family. She would
live in Turin, where her fianc&eacute; had been put in charge of
certain financial interests. It was the first break in that family
group, and with all the rejoicing there was also a consciousness of
approaching change and loss. Henriette caught the Duc following his
eldest daughter with a loving but thoughtful expression. She knew
he was thinking that with her wedding the end of an era would have
come for all of them. There was infinite tenderness in his look,
too. He seemed to be calling on Heaven to deal kindly with this
untried creature whose youth could so easily flower or be blighted
by the approaching experience.</p>

<p>"Don't be troubled, monsieur," Henriette told him more than once
when she saw his anxiety. "Isabella is ready for love. You've done
all you can to find her a good husband. The rest lies with God or
Fate or whatever we may call it. You can do nothing about
that."</p>

<p>Isabella herself took the matter calmly. She was not a highly
sensitive or emotional girl. Her qualities were of a less
spectacular sort. She seemed attracted to the well-mannered young
man with his good looks and handsome clothes who had been provided
for her. Perhaps that was all that could be expected, since she had
met no other young men except her own brothers. Naturally she
responded to the excitement and to becoming suddenly the centre of
attention; and she bore up remarkably well under her mother's
bursts of tearful affection and orgies of lavish buying for her
trousseau and household equipment. Only occasionally did Henriette
sense any doubt or fear in the girl's mind.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," she asked once after she had had a long session
with the Abb&eacute; Gallard, "I don't always understand what the
Abb&eacute; means when he talks to me about the duties of
marriage."</p>

<p>"What don't you understand, Isabella?"</p>

<p>"Well, he spoke about submission, and&mdash;and then almost the
next minute he was talking about my children and how they must be
baptized and brought up in the Church. And somehow, mademoiselle, I
couldn't see how such things fitted together."</p>

<p>The smooth young brow puckered, and the dark eyes were fixed on
Henriette anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't be worried, my dear," she said. "If you love and are
loved in turn it will all come about naturally, and this submission
he spoke of will take care of itself. I've never been married, you
know; so, if there are things that you want to know, go to your
mother and ask for advice."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I couldn't do that!" The girl flushed as she spoke. "I
can't talk to her about such things; and when I marry,
mademoiselle, I don't want to be like Mamma."</p>

<p>"Isabella, my dear!" Henriette felt it her duty to remonstrate
in spite of her secret sympathy. "You mustn't say such things. When
you marry you'll feel differently and understand why your mother is
often ill and depressed."</p>

<p>"But that's exactly what I meant: I don't want to be ill all the
time, and I'd like a few children but no so many as in our family.
But from what the Abb&eacute; said&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off uneasily, and Henriette turned away from the
question in those candid eyes. Haltingly she explained as much as
she could of marriage. It was not her place to do so, and the
Duchesse would no doubt be furious if she discovered that a
governess had so far overstepped the bounds of propriety. But
Henriette was too moved by such blending of innocence and ignorance
not to come to the girl's rescue. How could she deal with one and
still leave the other untouched?</p>

<p>"Now do not be troubled," she ended her remarks. "Meet
experiences as they come. Be generous and think the best of your
husband even if this new life seems strange to you at first. Be
happy, my dear, for I believe that the greatest good comes out of
the greatest happiness. And above all never let what the
Abb&eacute; or any one else may say make you anxious and
afraid."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, mademoiselle. Thank you very much, mademoiselle."
The old schoolgirl manner had returned once more. "And,
mademoiselle, do you think I might wear the new cherry poplin when
I go with Louise for chocolate with my S&eacute;bastiani cousins
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>Smiling, Henriette gave her consent, though she felt the cherry
poplin to be inappropriate to the occasion. But Isabella was so
young, so young and so touchingly untried.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu,"</i> she thought when the girl had gone off,
humming a tune and holding a bon-bon between her fingers, "they
know so little, and they feel so much!"</p>

<p>She sighed and turned back to the next day's lessons she was
preparing, wondering if she had been wise in her advice. It was all
very well to say, "Be happy, and the rest will take care of
itself." But the girl had keen eyes and ears and was acutely aware
of what went on about her. No wonder she felt qualms at stepping
boldly into unknown country where she must blaze her own trail
through the bewildering jungles of the heart and senses.</p>

<p>"Some day," Henriette thought, "it will not be like this. A
young girl will step across the threshold of marriage knowing
almost as much of its necessities as her brothers. She need not
walk into it blindfolded and fearful."</p>

<p>In another month they all journeyed to Melun in time to see the
orchards bloom in drifts of white and rose. May passed smoothly and
June. Reynald celebrated his eighth birthday in that month, and
there was a f&ecirc;te in his honour to which all the tenants and
their children were invited. Henriette was proud of the little
boy's looks and behaviour on this occasion, and even the Duchesse
expressed satisfaction.</p>

<p>"He does you credit, mademoiselle," she actually remarked when
the celebration was over. "I begin to have hopes that he will some
day be as vigorous as his brothers."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Madame," Henriette had answered, following the small
boy as he proudly collected the gifts that had been brought him.
"He's made great strides in the last year, and I suppose that means
that soon he will be going away to school, and then my work here
will be over. A boy can't stay close to petticoats for ever."</p>

<p>"That is true," the mother agreed. "But they're all growing up
too quickly, and he's the youngest alas!" She sighed and lapsed
into one of her reveries. "Eight years. It doesn't seem possible it
can be so long since his birth. He nearly cost me my life,
mademoiselle. The Duc was beside himself."</p>

<p>"I can well imagine," Henriette murmured tactfully. "And I.
Madame, can hardly believe sometimes that it's over four years
since I came here to care for your children."</p>

<p>She did not add that sometimes it seemed far longer than that,
because the years before seemed to have lost all reality for her.
She had been another person then, wrapped in a cocoon of emotional
immaturity almost like that which still protected Isabella and
Louise. She had rubbed elbows with life, but not until she entered
the Praslin m&eacute;nage had she known the sharp prick of its
ecstasies and its despairs.</p>

<p>That summer of 1845 it was Berthe who needed her special care;
though she had recovered, the illness had left her ailing. She who
had been the gayest one, abounding in vitality and high spirits,
was now utterly changed. She had been a rosy and beautiful little
girl when the scarlet fever attacked her, and she had emerged from
the siege pale and scrawny and listless. She had grown too fast
during those weeks in bed, and her childish beauty had vanished.
The Duchesse mourned over her child's appearance, and the Duc
worried even more over this change.</p>

<p>"Her listlessness is what worries me, monsieur," Henriette told
the Duc, "not her lost beauty. That will return in time. She spent
all her strength fighting the fever. We cannot expect it to come
back all at once."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," he agreed. "And you say her appetite is poor.
We must do something about that. When I spoke to Dr. Simon last
week he seemed to think she would improve at the seashore, and her
grandfather has been urging a visit to Olmeto in August. Well, I
will talk to the Duchesse about it if you approve of the plan."</p>

<p>Almost invariably he deferred to her in all matters, not only
those which concerned the young people but affairs of the
household, and lately even about his own political career. It was
flattering to have him turn to her for advice, even more flattering
when he followed it. Her suggestions, he had discovered, were both
shrewd and wise.</p>

<p>Sometimes they even discussed politics, and she amazed him by
her knowledge of affairs in France and in the world. Their views on
governments and on foreign policies did not always agree, but her
opinions were always stimulating, and provocative. By birth,
inclination and upbringing he was a conservative and an aristocrat,
while she was frankly Republican. But more than this she belonged
to a minority that defies classification. She was highly
individualistic in all her reactions. Like a spirited horse, she
rebelled at anything which restrained personal liberty and freedom
of expression. Frequently he smiled and shrugged at her arguments
because they were his only weapons against her brilliance of speech
and her gift for vivid language. Still he held his ground against
her, stubbornly though good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll see," she would tell him after some arguments in
which the King and the House of Peers figured prominently. "Some
day you'll see that a Royalist government can go too far. Levying
higher and higher taxes and silencing public opinion behind
censorship and prison bars has never strengthened a weak party,
whether kings or commoners happen to be in power."</p>

<p>"Oh, so we have treason in our midst, Mademoiselle Deluzy!" He
laughed at her. "I suppose I ought to report you to the police. But
I've noticed that you have no objections to sharing the privileges
of this system you so hotly denounce. You don't really want to see
the Bonapartes back in power, do you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Of course I like luxuries as well as you do, but so do the
people over on the Left Bank and along the docks at Le Havre and
Marseilles, and so do all the little shopkeepers who dread the
sight of a gendarme and the tax collector with his new list of
levies. No, I'm not a Bonapartist. We can't go back to campaigns
that bleed France white. But even the English are more progressive
than we. They let a young Queen sit on the throne, to be sure, but
they made certain that her ministers keep the upper hand."</p>

<p>"Don't forget their House of Lords is still all-powerful."</p>

<p>"Don't forget to mention their House of Commons, too, monsieur.
And don't forget there are Republicans across the water. When I
read of them, it seems to me that in America they are at least
trying to put into practice an ideal we once were brave enough to
fight for, but foolish enough to let slip through our fingers."</p>

<p>"Oh, those Republicans in America! They don't count&mdash;a new
half-settled country of savages, or at best a stewpot of riffraff
from every nation in Europe. You can't take them seriously."</p>

<p>"But they take themselves seriously, and that in time may change
the world."</p>

<p>"Well, they bore me." He made a wry face and snapped his fingers
as if to put an end to America and Republicans and all such
nuisances. "You can be very eloquent at argument, Mademoiselle
Deluzy; and I admire you for it, which surprises me since I've
always disliked women who talk like men."</p>

<p>"But I never talk like a man, do I, monsieur?" she
challenged.</p>

<p>"No, you don't," he admitted. "That's why you're so baffling.
You're as inconsistent as any woman alive, and you know it. All
these fine convictions of yours, and yet you don't try to follow
them. Why not go to America? Answer me that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall some day," she retorted, "when your King
Louis-Philippe is no longer in power, and you can no longer afford
to keep a governess. Of course"&mdash;the fun went out of her
voice&mdash;"I'm only joking, monsieur. I love France. I wouldn't
live anywhere else, and I mean to live and die here; only I do
believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That the King and his peers are a set of rascals, and that
their days are numbered&mdash;is that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I believe that a change is bound to come sooner or
later." "That we're a lot of Neros fiddling while Rome burns?" he
pressed her.</p>

<p>"In a way, yes. The fire hasn't started yet, and perhaps you and
won't live to hear it crackle; but your sons may."</p>

<p>"You don't mean another Revolution? We're past all that kind of
bloodshed and butchery."</p>

<p>"I hope so. It may not be like that, only I know that something
stirs in the air of Paris when I walk about and hear what men and
women in streets and shops are saying to one another. There have
been these attempted assassinations of the King lately. They're all
signs that times are changing, monsieur, and we must change with
them if we wish to survive."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;I shall count on you to tell me in advance when all
this is to happen. It will be a comfort when I take my place in the
House of Peers to know that Mademoiselle Deluzy will warn me of the
deluge."</p>

<p>"You are really going to be made a member of the House of Peers?
Of course I had heard rumours, monsieur, but I didn't know it was a
fact."</p>

<p>"Yes," he told her with a note of pride creeping into his voice.
"It's a certainty. With my father gone and the older peers thinning
out it's inevitable that we younger members of the nobility should
take over our responsibilities. Perhaps you didn't realise that I
took mine seriously." He rose and stood looking down at her with an
amused expression. "And now, do you turn from me because I shall so
soon be part of the Court you hate?"</p>

<p>She shook her head as she caught his smile and humorously lifted
eyebrows. His words came to her as from a long way off because she
could hardly keep her mind on what he said. She could only be
acutely aware of his strength and vitality. He stood so tall and
fair above her, faintly fragrant of bay rum and leather and a
recently smoked cigar. Somehow their arguments always ended like
this because, when that subtle scent of masculinity which was so
much a part of him overcame her, she could never be completely
logical.</p>

<p>The plans for an August holiday in Corsica were all made, and
the old Mar&eacute;chal had chartered a private vessel to carry the
party from Marseilles. The two older boys were remaining at the
ch&acirc;teau, and the Duc was to return there after accompanying
the others and seeing them aboard the boat. Henriette felt glad
that he would be with them on the long journey. The weather was
extremely hot, and even luxurious travel was uncomfortable with
unforeseen delays and crowded accommodations at hotels. She had her
hands full enough with the six girls and Raynald and two nursemaids
in her charge. Madame Leclerc could be very trying on such
expeditions, and the Duchesse's health made travel difficult. With
the Duc at hand, Henriette felt she had a powerful ally, and his
presence also laid a certain restraint on the servants, who never
lost an opportunity to put a governess at disadvantage.</p>

<p>But before Paris was well behind them the rumblings of discord
began. The Duchesse refused to continue by train, insisting that it
made her ill, and that she would collapse before they reached the
seaport. Whether she really was as indisposed as she claimed,
Henriette never knew; but the fact that the Duc protested against
shifting their plans was enough to bring on one of her worst
attacks of combined migraine and hysteria. There was nothing to do
but put up the whole party at an inn for two nights and a day.
Quarters were crowded, and the children restive. The Duc, to while
away the tiresome delay, took Mademoiselle Deluzy and the young
people for a day's outing in the country, and unfortunately a
broken axle to one of the carriages kept them away until early
evening. This incident only added fuel to the already smouldering
fire of the Duchesse's injured sensibilities, and for hours the
floor occupied by the Praslin party reverberated with the quarrel
which raged. What lightning would follow the rumblings, Henriette
wondered as she tossed wakefully in a stifling room. She had no
doubt that she figured prominently in the Duchesse's accusations;
and she wished with fervour that the pleasant outing had never been
arranged, or at least that she had not been involved in it.</p>

<p>Next morning, as she and the children gathered for <i>petit
d&eacute;jeuner,</i> the Duc unexpectedly appeared in his
travelling clothes. He looked worn and grim to Henriette, and he
was unusually quiet through the meal. When the very poor coffee and
rolls had been finished, Henriette ventured to ask what his orders
might be for the day. Was Madame la Duchesse able to continue with
the journey?</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse will not accompany us," he told her briefly.
"She insists upon remaining here till she is recovered, and she
says she cannot continue to Corsica; so we must go without her.
There has been enough needless delay." His lips tightened as he
spoke. "The ship has already been kept waiting too long, and
there's no reason why one of us should spoil the holiday for all
the rest."</p>

<p>Henriette asked no more questions, and the journey continued by
train and carriage. A marked relief showed in the spirits of the
little party. No one except the two servants seemed to mind the
absence of Madame and her maid, and by the time they reached
Marseilles the Duc had recovered his good spirits. They boarded the
chartered vessel that night though the skipper explained that the
tide and difficult harbour conditions would keep him from weighing
anchor until the next morning; no one minded this slight delay
after the longer ones they had undergone. The boat was far cleaner
and more comfortable than the provincial hotels, and the children
revived in the fresh salt air.</p>

<p>"Suppose we take Isabella and Louise ashore, Mademoiselle
Deluzy," the Duc proposed after the younger ones had gone to their
cabins. "We'll hear a concert on the Quai and have a
<i>cr&egrave;me de menthe</i> at some caf&eacute;."</p>

<p>It was delightful to stroll in the cool darkness of evening
along an esplanade above the harbour with all the anchored ship
lanterns doubling their brightness in black water. The city's
close-packed buildings were honeycombed with luminous streets and
innumerable lamp-lit windows; and more lights followed the curve of
the waterline, dwindling into the distance like a string of
brilliants on some unseen throat. And still farther away, the
single lonely eye of a lighthouse guarded the channel that led to
sea.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it is!" Henriette drew a faint sigh of
contentment as they paused to lean over a stone parapet. "And by
day it seems so sprawling and ugly."</p>

<p>"Yes, coast cities look best after dark," the Duc agreed.
"They're like some women in that respect. Gaslight and jewels and a
certain blurring of features transform them."</p>

<p>She made no further comment as they entered a small park where a
band played in a pavilion and tables were spread under the trees.
He must know so much of women, she thought. A man of his sort,
high-born and rich and handsome&mdash;why should he not be a
connoisseur of her sex? And yet he seldom made her aware of that.
When he looked at her she never felt that mentally he was peeling
the clothes from her naked body with the cool appraisal of other
men from whose glances she had turned. For all his masculine
assurance and vigour and in spite of the physical passion which she
had seen flicker like a whiplash across those features she knew so
well, she felt him to be instinctively decent, even reticent
regarding the temptations of the flesh. The Duchesse, she believed,
had offended this personal reticence. That perhaps was the true
reason of the widening rift between them.</p>

<p>The band was playing a Viennese air when they entered the little
park. The music had a sweet, sad undertone that for her almost
obscured the gaiety of the melody. It made a catch in her throat as
she walked beside him with the two girls following just behind.
They threaded their way between the tables, nearly all of which had
been taken. People stared at the four as they passed. Henriette
knew that the glances were admiring as well as curious, and it
pleased her to guess that these men and women probably mistook her
for his wife, the mother of the two girls in their full, smartly
cut travelling dresses and flower-trimmed bonnets. The waiter was
leading them to an unoccupied table some distance off. She would
have followed without protest, but the Duc shook his head. With a
gesture that was authoritative without being conspicuous he
signalled to the head-waiter and explained that they must have a
better table. As if by magic one was brought and placed to the best
'advantage. From force of habit she moved to take the seat with its
back to the harbour. But instead he selected the best chair of the
four and held it out for her. She accepted it with almost a guilty
feeling. Governesses were expected to sit with their backs to a
view.</p>

<p>Yes, that was it; that was what made her somehow a stranger to
herself in this unfamiliar city. She did not feel like a governess
tonight.</p>

<p><i>"Oui, oui, cr&egrave;me de menthe frapp&eacute; pour les
jeunes files.</i> Napoleon brandy for monsieur. And for
Madame?"</p>

<p>Her cheeks grew hot as she bent over the menu card.</p>

<p>"Champagne cup," the Duc suggested, and she agreed.</p>

<p>It was folly to let oneself believe in the impossible because a
waiter had made a careless blunder. Yet how she blessed him for it!
What harm could there be to feel for an hour the assurance that one
was a <i>madame</i> and not a mere <i>mademoiselle</i> of
indeterminate years? The cool bubbles of champagne slipped
deliciously down her throat and tingled in her veins, mingling with
other bubbles of happiness and pride that were as transient in
their potency.</p>

<p><i>"Gar&ccedil;on,"</i> he called to the hurrying waiter,
"<i>l'addition.</i>"</p>

<p>She watched him pull a handful of silver and notes from his
pocket and lay a generous tip on the china saucer. Once more that
easy gesture of assurance enchanted her with its novelty. No
feminine tumbling in bag or purse, no counting out change and
wondering how small a tip one dared to leave without the
humiliation of a waiter's frown or muttered complaint. Quickly she
gathered her shawl about her shoulders. Better let the evening be
over soon, before the old habits of a woman making her way alone
became too difficult to resume.</p>

<p>The music from the pavilion followed them as they started back
to the pier, but suddenly it seemed to have lost its power over
them. Their feet no longer quickened to a gay tempo. Silence had
fallen on the four, and Henriette for one had no inclination to
sprightly talk.</p>

<p>She dreaded the weeks in Corsica more than she would admit to
herself. The old Mar&eacute;chal would spoil his grandchildren and
patronise her; and she would feel as she had felt before on those
other visits&mdash;an alien in a still more alien land.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are." The Duc led them to the waiting tender
which would take them to their boat, whose lights they could barely
distinguish from other anchored vessels. Between the pier and those
lights inky water lapped, and still farther liquid miles stretched
between them and their destination. A cool wind had risen and blew
moist against their faces as they pressed closer together by the
slippery steps of the landing-place. Below them the dark-skinned
sailors waited in the small rocking boat, their hands outstretched
to help the voyagers aboard. The moment of parting had come.
Henriette braced herself for it.</p>

<p>Seated in the stern of the boat with Isabella beside her and
Louise in front, she looked up and held out her hand in farewell.
But the Duc was not bending above them, saying good-bye and
offering words of advice for the last lap of their journey. Instead
she saw him leap aboard and seat himself in the empty forward seat
as the men bent to their oars.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa!" Isabella and Louise exclaimed in unison, their
voices shrill with surprise and happiness. "You're coming with us
after all instead of going back to Paris. What fun, and how
surprised grandfather will be! When did you change your mind?"</p>

<p>"Just now." Henriette heard his voice though she could no longer
see him for the darkness that had closed round them. "Just a minute
ago, to be exact!"</p>

<p>He laughed out suddenly like a boy who has just run away from
school.</p>

<p>"If there are any objections from the stern," he called
again-.and there was a challenging note in his voice that Henriette
knew must be meant for her&mdash;"I'd like to hear them now.
There's still time for me to swim back."</p>

<p>But the only sound was the creak and dipping of oars in the
darkness. There were no objections from the stern.</p>

<h3>Chapter Fourteen</h3>

<p>How the Duc explained his presence and his wife's absence to the
Mar&eacute;chal S&eacute;bastiani, Henriette never knew. But the
old man made no comments to her after their arrival, and he and his
son-in-law seemed upon less strained though slightly formal
relations. During the week that he stayed at Olmeto she had few
opportunities to talk alone with the Duc. The weather being
exceptionally fine, the days were spent much in the open with
sailing expeditions and elaborate picnics planned to amuse the
children. But on the afternoon before he left Henriette found
herself alone with him as they waited for the children and the old
Mar&eacute;chal to return from exploring some vineyards of which
their host was particularly proud.</p>

<p>They sat in a small arbour, with the sea's vehement blue
stretching before them and the shadows of grape leaves in the
strong, salt sunshine making strange patterns on their faces.</p>

<p>"How blue the sea is!" she said as one or the other had
exclaimed twenty times before that day. "From here it does not look
flat, but like a curtain hanging there between us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Between us and what?" He took up her words, his eyes narrowing
against the brightness beyond their shelter.</p>

<p>"I don't know, monsieur," she told him. "But to-morrow you'll be
setting off, and it will all look flat and different to you
then."</p>

<p>"Flat, yes." He spoke absently, and his eyes turned from the
water to her once more. "Life is often like that for me in spite of
all I have. Do you ever feel so?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, never!" The curls swung warm against her cheeks
as she shook her head. "Life troubles me often, but I've never felt
that it was flat. Always there's something just ahead that I feel
I'm going to meet."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle Deluzy," he told her simply, "your zest for
life is contagious. When I'm with you the old savour returns to me.
I envy you this gift, and I hope you'll never lose it."</p>

<p>Silence fell between them there in the sun-dappled arbour.
Though Henriette could hear men singing as they mended nets on the
shore and the far-off voices of the children calling to one
another, it seemed to her that she and her companion were the only
two people in the world; as if a circle had been drawn about them,
so that he and she were set apart in some peculiar intimacy more
like transcending contentment than love. She could almost visualise
that circle as if his boots and the hem of her skirt actually
touched it. But another circle came to her mind, a crudely drawn
band of red crayon about words she could never forget. She sighed,
remembered them, and the charm of the interlude was broken. She
knew she must speak to him of less pleasant matters. There might be
no other chance between now and to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she began, "I haven't liked to spoil this little
holiday&mdash;" He turned questioning eyes upon her, and she went
on slowly. "It's been so happy for us all to have you here, and
I've tried not to think of&mdash;of the accounting that you and I,
too, must give to the Duchesse. I cannot help feeling that
you&mdash;that we shall pay dearly because you came with us and
left her behind."</p>

<p>"I always pay." He spoke evenly, but his brows drew together in
a frown. "Sometimes I pay most for what I never had. I've been
happy these few days, and at least that's something on my side of
the ledger."</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, it was madness for you to come without her. The
servants' looks told me that all the way here, and when we return
their tongues will say even more."</p>

<p>"So you mind what servants say?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "I don't mind. Only it doesn't stop there. I
used to feel that it didn't matter what people might think and say
of one, so long as one's conscience was clear; but now I'm not so
sure. And after that scandal in the paper last winter&mdash;Well,
monsieur, you must know what they say about us?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He passed his long strong fingers wearily across his eyes
as he spoke. "Yes, I know. But ugly words like that can't hurt when
we know they're untrue. Besides," he hurried on more casually,
"that scurrilous gossip sheet thrives on lies. Every one knows
that. It's famous for sly campaigns against the nobility. I
believe"&mdash;he smiled rather grimly&mdash;" that some of those
Republicans you champion are behind it."</p>

<p>"That may be so; but leaving the Republicans out, gossip is
gossip; and there's no end to it once the pebble has been tossed
into the pond. The ripples go on and on, spreading and growing
larger, and then it's beyond our power to stop them."</p>

<p>The voices of the children sounded more clearly. They were
returning and would burst into the arbour in a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," he told her. "There have been storms before; and
we've weathered them, haven't we? Well, then, we'll meet this if it
comes. I'm going back to-morrow, and you know what I mean when I
say that&mdash;suspicion and reproaches and jealous outbursts.
You've witnessed plenty of them in nearly five years. And letters!
<i>Mon Dieu,</i> those letters&mdash;always when I return I find
one on my desk or under my door. Sometimes they're wet with
pleading tears, and sometimes they're the ravings of a madwoman. It
doesn't matter which; they're all the same&mdash;demanding,
demanding what it's not in my power to give. If I lose my reason,
too, and they tie me in a strait-jacket some day, you'll know that
scribbled words on note-paper have driven me to desperation."</p>

<p>He had risen, and his breath came quick and difficult between
the words. Usually he was so reserved, so guarded, in what he said
that she was frightened by the change that had overtaken him.
Before she could collect herself to speak he strode out into the
sunshine to meet the group returning from the vineyard. Henriette
stared after him, watching his body's indolent strength and grace,
and how the sun brightened his bare, blond head.</p>

<p>The children's voices echoed as they hailed their father, and
the faint, ghostly repetition of broken words had never been so
eerie before. Something prophetic stirred in her at the sound. They
would haunt her always, she knew, in the future that seemed to lie
behind that curtain of blue sea.</p>

<p>Then they were flocking round her, proudly holding the jug of
fresh grape juice they had brought from the vats for her to
share.</p>

<p>"Look, mademoiselle!" Raynald was boasting with a boot in either
hand. "I treaded the grapes in my bare feet. You can see it's still
purple between my toes!"</p>

<p>After the Duc's departure she remained with the children for
three more weeks. Berthe was regaining her health and beauty in the
salt air and sunshine, but she needed constant attendance.
Henriette gave this lavishly to the child, yet all the time her
mind seethed in the whirlpool of her thoughts. At night she lay
wakeful in her room often till the great burnished sun pushed
through a welter of glowing clouds and the sea caught that glory on
its wide, heaving waste.</p>

<p>Now that the spell of the Duc's magnetic yet dependent presence
no longer held her, she could think clearly and even reason about
the problem which each day brought nearer. She had never been one
to escape into unreality when issues must be faced. She did not
turn now from the inexorable, hard facts. She did not try to blur
their outlines with rosy hopes of impossible reconciliations. No,
it all came to the same question, no matter how she might shift and
sort over the threads that had tangled themselves more tightly
about her each year she had remained in the Praslin household.
Should she go, or should she stay?</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;go now," caution and common sense urged. "The
situation will never be better, and it may be much worse.
Reputation is a prize you've won for yourself with self-denial and
hard work. If you throw it away, what have you left to fall back
on? How will you contrive to live without it?"</p>

<p>But the stubborn sense of independence, the high spirits and
ambition that were as much a part of her as shrewdness and prudence
would always break in.</p>

<p>"You've done no wrong, that you should be forced to leave
against your will and in disgrace. You met the Duchesse more than
halfway, and whether you go or stay there will always be someone
she can find to blame for her unhappiness."</p>

<p>"But she cannot blame you if you are not there. What do you
expect to gain by staying?"</p>

<p>"A pension for my old age. But no, that's not really the reason.
They need me&mdash;these children I love, and a man who is
desperate and miserable."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, but children grow fast, and they forget
easily. This man, what is he to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I don't know. There's never been a word or a
gesture between us that couldn't have been shared by all the spying
eyes in the world."</p>

<p>"But your feelings, can they be shared?"</p>

<p>"My feelings belong to me and to me alone. They're the only
personal property many women possess&mdash;women born to scrimp and
work and rely on themselves as I've done all my life."</p>

<p>And so the debate went on within herself. She was still arguing
on that August afternoon three days before the holiday when she was
summoned to Mar&eacute;chal S&eacute;bastiani's library.</p>

<p>That morning a large sack of mail had been received. Isabella
and two of the girls had had notes from their mother, and they had
reported her better again and back at Melun. There had also been a
paint-box for Berthe which her father had promised to send. It had
been mailed from a shop in Paris, Henriette noticed. There had been
many letters for the Mar&eacute;chal and large quantities of
newspapers. Henriette had hoped that she might have a chance to
read some of these, for she was eager for news in this remote place
where world events were far less important than fair winds and
shoals of fish to be caught in nearer waters.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," the old man greeted her after the servant had
taken himself off, "I regret the interruption, but it was important
that I see you at once. Please sit down."</p>

<p>Though the day was sunny outside, that library was dark in its
leather panelling which also seemed to hold and give out
accumulated dampness from many seasons of fog. Row upon row of
heavy volumes filled the shelves, and the great mahogany desk stood
in the centre. It was a flat-topped desk, and at each corner a
fierce dog's head had been carved. The life-like expression of
their bared fangs was hardly reassuring to Henriette as she seated
herself nearby. Neither were the bundles of papers the old man had
been studying. An open letter also lay under his hands, and it took
only a hurried glance for her to recognise the writing. She did not
let her eyes linger there, but spreading her dimity skirt carefully
about her she waited for him to speak:</p>

<p>"I am not going to mince words with you, mademoiselle," he began
in his rather thick, provincial voice. "I've been greatly disturbed
by what has come to me in the post."</p>

<p>He cleared his throat and fumbled among the papers before
him.</p>

<p>As he did so Henriette saw the familiar lines of red drawn about
certain paragraphs, and she knew what to expect.</p>

<p>"Isabella had a letter from her mother," she remarked to fill in
the pause. She was determined to remain casual as long as possible.
"She tells me that Madame la Duchesse is recovering from her
indisposition in the country."</p>

<p>"She is at the ch&acirc;teau, yes; but, far from being
recovered, she is apparently in a state of collapse. You will see
why when you read what she has sent." He took up the sheaf of
newspapers and laid them in her lap. "It has been a great shock to
me, a very great shock indeed."</p>

<p>She took the papers up resolutely and began to read. It was very
quiet in the room, so quiet that a bee buzzing on the window-sill
and the distant thud of surf below the headlands made the very
stillness hum.</p>

<p>She did not skip a word, though they were ugly words and there
were many more of them than in their forerunner. Not one, but
several papers carried versions of the latest Praslin scandal. The
r&ocirc;le that Mademoiselle D&mdash;&mdash;, a siren in the guise
of governess, had played in carrying the Duc off to Corsica, into
the very stronghold of the abandoned Duchesse, was commented upon
fully. Few who read Parisian newspapers could have missed the
various maliciously worded items, and this time there were no
clever insinuations, but bold statements. What, one paper asked,
was the country coming to when a Peer of France could so affront
the code of family ethics?</p>

<p>Henriette laid the sheaf down at last and faced the old
Mar&eacute;chal directly. She had turned pale, but that and the
beating of the little pulse in her throat were the only signs of
emotion. Her voice was low and steady as she spoke.</p>

<p>"If you are shocked by this, how do you think I feel?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mademoiselle. I am waiting to hear."</p>

<p>She moistened dry lips and spread out her hands in a futile
gesture.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Mar&eacute;chal," she said, "there's no use in
explanations and denials. If you believe in these lies after seeing
us here for a week and in Paris also&mdash;if you believe that
there is more than friendship between the Duc and myself, then
nothing I might say could convince you otherwise."</p>

<p>He was unprepared for the simplicity of her answer. Used as he
was to the tears and protests and frenzies of his hysterical
daughter, he could have dealt better with wild pleas and
expostulations than with the calm self-control of this woman who
sat waiting for his verdict.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he told her, "in all fairness I must admit that
I do not believe these vulgar charges against you. All my life I've
been a man of action, and so for me actions speak louder than
words. But words like these are very serious, as you yourself must
realise."</p>

<p>"I do. It only takes a drop of poison to turn what is sound to
something rotten and corrupt. You needn't point out to 'me that
after this my reputation is gone."</p>

<p>"You should have thought of it before, mademoiselle. You should
have not allowed the Duc to accompany you and so put yourselves and
my poor daughter in such a position. Your indiscretion has laid you
open to these attacks, unjust though they may be. And I understand
there was a similar one, too, some months ago."</p>

<p>"There was, and I was ready to leave at that time; but then
Berthe became so ill I stayed. After all I love your grandchildren
almost as much as if they were my own, and I've given them my best
always."</p>

<p>"And afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Afterwards they still needed me, and the Duchesse was gracious
to me once more. Oh, monsieur, please believe that I tried to go.
Many times I have told the Duc that it was best, but he would never
hear of it."</p>

<p>"My son-in-law is not always wise in his judgment, mademoiselle.
He's impetuous and easily swayed, far too easily swayed."</p>

<p>"When do you wish me to go? To-day, to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Wait." He had risen and was pacing the floor. His stocky,
vigorous body seemed charged with energy, despite his white hair
and beard and the veined hands that betrayed his age. "We must not
be too hasty. No, we must find the best way to quiet these
insults."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful for your consideration, monsieur."</p>

<p>His dark, filmed eyes turned upon her with a flash of the
Corsican temper she had learned to know so well. For a moment the
resemblance between himself and the Duchesse was startling.</p>

<p>"Keep your gratitude, mademoiselle. It's my daughter I'm
considering, not you or the Duc. Her welfare is all that matters to
me. God knows, it's not in my power to give her much happiness; but
I mean to spare her all the humiliation I can. She's had enough to
bear."</p>

<p>Henriette pressed her lips firmly together and ventured no
further comment. The old man continued his pacing, and it seemed
the better part of an hour before he spoke again.</p>

<p>"There's only one way to handle this situation, and that is to
seem indifferent to gossip. They expect you to leave the Praslin
household now, and the fact that you remain and apparently on
excellent terms will help to contradict all this."</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur." She had not given him credit for so much
astuteness.</p>

<p>"We must go on exactly as usual except, of course, that my
son-in-law and my daughter must make it a point to be seen together
more frequently in public. You will remain, and we will all return
to France the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And you will explain to the Duchesse that I stayed at your
request? I want her to know that this decision is entirely
yours."</p>

<p>"I will make her understand. Fanny has always been reasonable
with me. Yes, that will be the best course for us all to take."</p>

<p>He seemed relieved now that the decision had been made. Seating
himself once more at the desk, he drew out note-paper and a pen and
prepared for action.</p>

<p>"I shall write them both at once," he told her, "and dispatch
the letters by special messenger to the next packet. They'll reach
France before us. The Duc must be made to remember his position,
and that he cannot humiliate his wife further. She has been pushed
too far, mademoiselle, and as her father I shall find means to
bring him to his senses."</p>

<p>His voice grew harsh, and he dipped his pen fiercely in the ink
to express his feelings. Watching the hardening of his usually kind
old face, Henriette knew that this retired officer still believed
in force; that he could still wage campaigns other than those of
the battlefields he had known. Gunpowder, she thought, was not the
only ammunition at his command. Mentally she could almost see
Mar&eacute;chal S&eacute;bastiani tightening the cords of his
money-bags if his son-in-law refused to comply with his plans.</p>

<p>"Well," she reflected as she made her way from the musty
library, "I ought to be leaving, and here I am only more deeply
caught. <i>Mon Dieu,</i> to see the end, to know what to do!"</p>

<p>Thinking that Berthe and Raynald were in the summer-house at the
end of the rose garden, she went out to find them. But she paused
on her way, arrested by the sound of singing. In the kitchen garden
the other side of a high hedge she heard the twanging of a guitar
and a girl's voice lifted in one of the plaintive gipsy airs that
never failed to stir a responsive chord in her. This was one she
had not heard before, and the words came clear and distinct through
the thick green that hid the singer:</p>

<blockquote>"I hung my heart on a blackthorn tree,<br>
For I was young and gay;<br>
I feared that love would follow me<br>
And my poor heart betray.<br>
But who can guess what the end will be?<br>
Love played me a bitter jest&mdash;<br>
I dance, though my tears fall salt as the sea,<br>
I sing, with a thorn in my breast."</blockquote>

<p>She stood listening, rooted to the spot as if some invisible
warning finger had tapped her on the shoulder. She was trembling
long before the song ended. Chill shivers flickered along her spine
though the sunshine beat down upon her bare head.</p>

<p>Peering through a gap in the hedge she saw the two musicians, a
young stable-boy with his guitar and one of the girls from the
laundry, bending over some linen spread out to bleach. To her own
surprise Henriette found herself addressing the peasant girl who
knelt there.</p>

<p>"You were singing just now. No, I'm not scolding. You have a
very sweet voice. Can you tell me the name of that song?"</p>

<p>The pair turned from fright to foolish giggles of confusion.
Still kneeling, the girl pushed back the red and yellow 'kerchief
that covered her hair, and answered shyly.</p>

<p>"It's a very old song, that one&mdash;too old to have a
name."</p>

<p>"Isn't it rather a sad song?" Henriette persisted by way of
accounting for her interest.</p>

<p>The young man and girl exchanged knowing glances. Evidently her
remark amused them by its obviousness.</p>

<p>"Well, yes." The girl shrugged her shoulders eloquently. "But
why not, mademoiselle? It's always sad when love makes people
afraid."</p>

<p>She hurried on along the path, but she could hear those two
whispering and giggling behind her.</p>

<p>"When love makes people afraid&mdash;it's always sad."</p>

<p>Why had it taken a Corsican peasant girl to tell her what she
had fought off admitting to herself?</p>

<h3>Chapter Fifteen</h3>

<p>It was New Year's once more; 1846, and the papers predicting
higher taxes, wider skirts, and further foreign alliances. Across
the Channel, Great Britain under Sir Robert Peel's ministry rocked
with agitation over a repeal of the Corn Laws, and already the
spectre of famine stalked over Ireland. Shut away in a London
parlour, an invalid poetess named Elizabeth Barrett thrilled to the
visits of a certain Robert Browning, with whom she would flee to
Italy before the year ended.</p>

<p>In prison at Ham, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte had plenty of leisure
to brood upon the late glories of his uncle and to speculate on the
future while he waited to regain his freedom. He must be ready to
step forward when his supporters should decide that the moment had
come to strike at the House of Orl&eacute;ans.</p>

<p>In his palace the tired, ageing King of France conferred with
his ministers and House of Peers. He missed a certain hearty ring
in the cheers that greeted his public appearances, but the band
played louder to cover the thinness of lifted voices. They called
him Louis-Philippe now, and only a few remembered his old nickname
of Citizen King. But he no longer bothered about that. It took all
his energy to go through the motions expected of him. At least
France was at peace, and her relations with England and the young
Victoria and her German consort were extremely friendly. As for the
rest, he left them to Guizot, his Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>In her room at the ch&acirc;teau of Choiseul-Praslin, Henriette
Deluzy, who only occasionally remembered that the letter D on her
brushes and writing-case had ever stood for Desportes, welcomed the
New Year in alone. She had scarcely been in Paris since the return
from Corsica. The old Mar&eacute;chal had kept his word, and a
reconciliation of sorts had taken place. The Duc and Duchesse
attended soir&eacute;es and receptions together and were seen
frequently driving and at the theatr&eacute; and opera. All the
household, from grooms and kitchen-maids up to the Duc's valet,
Charpentier, and the inscrutable Madame Leclerc knew this was a
mere formality; but at least it gave no further opportunity for
items in the gossip sheets.</p>

<p>The Mar&eacute;chal S&eacute;bastiani settled himself at Number
55 Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, and two of his brothers
with their large families resided nearby. It seemed to Henriette
that they had deliberately closed in round the Duc, that he must
literally feel engulfed with S&eacute;bastiani relatives. She
guessed that his every movement was being watched, and that his
father-in-law had laid down his ultimatum.</p>

<p>Certainly he seemed worried and preoccupied whenever she saw
him. But he never mentioned such matters on the few occasions when
they were alone together. She knew that he dared not trust himself
to speak of his despair. He had been trapped and humiliated; and
there seemed to be no way out but to submit, at least to the extent
of keeping up the appearances of a happy marriage.</p>

<p>Henriette could feel a greater tension in him. She did not
believe that this outward domestic accord was more than a temporary
state. It was only an interlude, like the brief pause that follows
the breaking of one wave and the rising of the next. She, too, was
caught in this unnatural quiet between storms. It was a strange and
lonely time, but she almost welcomed it because of the illusion of
peace it gave her. So, she thought, people must live through a
siege, glad of sun and green leaves and such happy manifestations
of the seasons, while their ears were ever on the alert for the
rattle of shells that sent them scurrying for shelter. In a way the
Duc's absence was a relief, even though the days seemed savourless
without him. She need not be so terribly aware of his every word
and glance. She need not strain to catch the personal meaning
behind every inflection, or constantly try to give him sympathy
without crossing that boundary which separated governess from
married employer.</p>

<p>Isabella had been married in October. The ceremony had taken
place in the family chapel at the ch&acirc;teau in order that the
Dowager Duchesse of Praslin might be present. The Abb&eacute;
Gallard had journeyed from Paris to perform the rites. It had been
a time of great rejoicing and felicity, and the members of both
Praslin and S&eacute;bastiani houses forgot their grievances to
lavish affection and good wishes upon the young bride and
bridegroom. The ch&acirc;teau overflowed with relatives of all
ages; and Henriette found herself not only in charge of the young
people but superintending the activities of the household, seeing
that new servants were added to the staff, and that all the details
connected with so important an event went smoothly. Her genius for
directing others had never been given so large a scope, and she
rose to the occasion magnificently. Even the Duchesse complimented
her, and the Duc's gratitude had been touching.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she had insisted the day after the wedding when
he overwhelmed her with praise. "I love orderliness, monsieur. It
hurts me to see disorder in a desk or drawer, and it is even more
painful and unnecessary in the affairs of life."</p>

<p>"Yes," he told her, "you hate a passion for order. You've even
brought it to the chaos of my own life as well as the routine of my
household. It's a pity you can't take over the whole country." He
smiled and gave her one of his direct admiring glances. "I can
almost see you going about it with your quiet air of pleased
determination, sorting out the affairs of state, tidying all Paris
as if it were an overturned work-basket!"</p>

<p>"You make fun of me," she had protested. "I'm really a very poor
housekeeper. I may tell others what should be done, but if it were
necessary for me to build a fire and bake a loaf of
bread&mdash;well, we should all go hungry."</p>

<p>But she treasured his praise.</p>

<p>And so it was New Year's again, and she sat alone in her room
trying to read from a beautifully bound book on the scenic wonders
of America which the Duchesse had sent her as peace offering at
Christmas. She turned the pages idly, trying not to think of Paris
at this hour with the bells and the lights and the boulevards
thronged with revellers, the churches warm with lights and incense
where the devout raised prayers for the coming year. Louise,
C&eacute;leste and Marie had been privileged to sit up, till
midnight, and she had gone with them to wish their grandmother
Happy New Year. The old Duchesse, grown increasingly frail in the
last two years, they had found propped among her pillows, her
fingers moving along her rosary beads while she waited for midnight
to strike.</p>

<p>When the last note of the clock had sounded she put aside her
beads, kissed her grand-daughters on either cheek, and called for
seed cakes and canary wine.</p>

<p>"Ah, the years!" the old lady had sighed in response to
Henriette's good wishes for her health. "For me they are not what
they used to be. At my age one is for ever walking backwards,
stumbling over souvenirs of the past, left by those who have
already gone. Never pray for a multitude of years, mademoiselle,
for it is not meant that we should be ghosts to haunt
ourselves."</p>

<p>"You're not a ghost, <i>Grand'm&eacute;re."</i> Louise had
broken in with one of her impulsive embraces. "Is she,
mademoiselle? It's going to be a wonderful year, and Papa says I
shall be betrothed before another."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll be flying from the nest soon, my pet." Her
grandmother had laid her shrivelled fingers to the fresh young
cheek. "May you be happy, whether or not I live to hear you make
your vows. The years come and the years go; so enjoy them while
you're young and heart-free."</p>

<p>Fond as she was of the old Duchesse, Henriette could not help
agreeing with Louise's impatience at such familiar plaints.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," the girl had asked when they paused to say
goodnight, "why do old people always talk as if you could be happy
simply because you're young?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she had answered, "unless it's because we forget
grief more easily than joy. Perhaps that's the kindest trick memory
can play on us when we're old. But aren't you happy to-night, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so, only I miss Isabella; and I keep wondering
how she feels now she's a married woman. All the time I wonder how
it will be for me. I want things to happen soon; and yet I'm a
little afraid too."</p>

<p>Henriette had been reassuring, and they had parted
affectionately. But alone by her sitting-room fire she could no
longer fight off dejection and restlessness. The frosty stillness
of the country lying behind the rosy, drawn curtains depressed her.
She envied the servants the companionship and good cheer they must
be enjoying in the ch&acirc;teau's domestic quarters. She was not
given to self-pity&mdash;she despised the trait in other people;
yet for once it threatened to overwhelm her. To-night she rebelled
at being alone.</p>

<p>"Why should I be cursed with this loneliness?" she thought.
"Must I always be caught between two generations without a chance
to know my own? If I cannot have love, at least I could take
comfort in the companionship of those who think as I think, who
feel as I feel."</p>

<p>The tears she so seldom gave way to rose behind her eyes. She
made no effort to check them, but let the salty rush have its
way.</p>

<p>"Yes," she told herself, "it will always be this way. Always
like to-night, you will stand between the old and the young,
listening to sighs for the past and hopes for the future. You
belong to the present, and yet what good is that to you, caught
between what is over and what is waiting to begin&mdash;the old
Duchesse, whispering to dead friends, and Louise with her untried
schoolgirl heart?"</p>

<p>After her tears dried, she rose and went to her desk. She could
not sleep, and since she longed to be in Paris she would distract
her mind by writing to the few friends she had there who might even
now be speaking her name&mdash;the kind Remeys, cantankerous Madame
Le Maire, and another whose interest had lately come to mean much
to her. She had met the Reverend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod
through the Protestant Church in Paris, which she attended whenever
possible. Several times this brilliant writer on theological
subjects, this man whose eloquence and faith were as moving as the
sure logic of his mind, had preached from that pulpit to a
congregation that had been swayed by his power. After listening to
one of these sermons, Henriette had been prompted to write to the
preacher. One of his points, she had felt, might be enlarged
further and given a double interpretation. She had written
impersonally and scarcely expected to receive a reply. But the
Reverend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod had been impressed by her
intelligent grasp of his sermon. His response had been cordial, and
a meeting was arranged on one of her free afternoons. From this
first encounter each had found the other a stimulating personality.
She found in him a most unusual type of clergyman for France or any
other country. Here was a man of fine physical presence with the
intelligence of a scholar and the religious zeal of a prophet. Well
born and prosperous, with tolerance for others yet with the highest
of personal standards, he was that rare combination&mdash;a
minister of the gospel and a man of the world.</p>

<p>He lived simply but with dignity in a large old house where he
received Henriette in his study on more than one occasion. Each day
except Saturday and Sunday he opened his doors between four and six
o'clock to any who might care to come, and for those hours he gave
his whole mind and heart to the religious and personal problems of
his visitors. Henriette told him little directly of herself and her
life in the Praslin m&eacute;nage. They talked usually of matters
he had mentioned in his sermons, or they discussed the unrest and
discontent among the people of France, the mistakes of the King and
his ministers in their policies. Always his comments were wise and
worth hearing, and he had a way of drawing her out to express her
own views.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle Deluzy," he would caution, "you're much too
headlong and idealistic. You must not jump to conclusions so fast,
not even if you have read your John Stuart Mill so thoroughly and
though you can quote Miss Barrett's 'Cry of the Children in such
perfect English. Of course the world would be better if all the
people in it could be well fed and well educated. But remember,
there's no way been found yet to pry holes in men's brains and pour
the learning in. It's discouraging how many seem to carry a
complete immunity to education in their system."</p>

<p>"That may be," she would retort stubbornly, "but I still say let
every one have a chance at it. That's the only way we can ever tell
those who, you say, are immune from those who might learn and
benefit."</p>

<p>So they would amicably exchange opinions, sometimes arguing
their points, sometimes in complete accord until other visitors
arrived or coffee was brought in an old family urn that spoke to
Henriette eloquently of her host's background and financial
independence. Always she left that house refreshed in mind and
spirit. She had met his wife only once, and she knew as little of
his life and habits as he knew of hers. It was a friendship of the
mind that in no way involved the senses, for which, in her inner
perplexity and stress, she gave fervent thanks.</p>

<p>So to-night, after she had written notes to the Remeys and
Madame Le Maire, she also wrote to the Reverend
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod to wish him well in the coming year.
It was a courteous, charming note; and she felt in a more
benevolent mood towards the whole world when she had sealed it. It
was pleasant to let her pen slip over the smooth, expensive
note-paper provided by the ch&acirc;teau. Impulsively she reached
for another sheet and addressed the greeting to her grandfather.
She could afford to be charitable to the harsh old man. After all,
he was her only relative, and she would make the gesture of
forgetting past differences. It gave her no small satisfaction to
slip a hundred-franc note into the letter.</p>

<p>"After all," she thought, "he cannot say that I am ungrateful,
no matter what other names he may find for me."</p>

<p>Still she sat at the desk, her eyes fixed on the remaining sheet
of note-paper. Blank and white it lay under her fingers. There were
the pens and ink&mdash;so near, yet she might not write the one
letter it would have eased her heart to put on paper. A simple
Happy New Year addressed to him and signed with her initials might
fall under other eyes that would twist the words to mean something
ugly and evil. She dared not allow herself even this innocent
gesture of good will.</p>

<p>All went smoothly and well in those early months of 1846. The
weeks slipped by, serene and uneventful, save for the brief,
unpredictable appearances of the Duc. He spent long hours with his
mother and also much time supervising work in the park. The
building of a luxurious conservatory to replace an old greenhouse
had been started, and he was full of elaborate plans for raising
rare varieties of plants.</p>

<p>"Why must you have all these hothouse flowers, monsieur?" she
asked him once when he was taking her through the half-finished
glass addition, explaining all that would be blooming there by
another winter. "Soon there will be snowdrops and primroses in the
woods, and then summer will be coming. Of course these artificially
raised flowers will be rare and beautiful, but somehow I think we
were not meant to upset the course of the seasons."</p>

<p>"But that's what pleases me," he told her. "I like to do just
that, to feel I have power over the seasons. And then it's a
distraction. One must have something to do."</p>

<p>Though he smiled and shrugged, she felt the boredom behind his
words. So she said no more about the greenhouse. It would probably
cost, she reflected, more than enough to support the Remeys for a
year, and in less than that time he would be tired of it. He left
her presently to consult some workmen building one of the great
brick furnaces. She watched him as he stood there, head and
shoulders above them, dwarfing their bodies by the magnificent
proportions of his own. His head was turned sideways, and she was
struck anew by the beauty of his features. In full face he was a
handsome man; but the indolent fullness of lips and cheeks and the
lines about his eyes made him look his forty-one years. But in
profile the proud, clear modelling was accentuated. He reminded her
of some sculptured head on an old coin.</p>

<p>"Oh," she thought, "what a pity he was not born in another age
than this! Not in Greece, perhaps&mdash;he's too rugged for
that&mdash;but in the north somewhere. Yes, he's like the
figurehead of some old Viking ship. He belongs to a time when it
was enough for a man to be strong and beautiful. Now that's less
valued than the cunning of a man's mind to outwit the schemes of
other minds."</p>

<p>She had never been deceived that the Duc's mind was remarkable
in any way. His gifts lay not in that direction, but in his body's
vigour. He had been endowed above others with vitality and good
looks. And all this was going to waste before her eyes. There was
no outlet for this power that possessed him, and some day it would
break loose with the very weight of its unused force, and his own
strength would be his undoing. She felt this instinctively, as she
waited in the half-completed conservatory. It seemed to her only
another symbol of the futile extravagance by which he tried to
appease his own unrest.</p>

<p>Why must she stand there helpless to meet his need? Time was
slipping by them both with every breath they drew, and he played
with piles of brick as he must have played with blocks long ago on
a nursery floor. There must be something she could do, something
she could say. But what? She belonged to a world where people made
their own way, living precariously by their wits or the work of
their hands. That was not his world. He could never understand what
she meant when she talked of such things. He had not been born to
understand; and, in a way, that was what she loved in him.</p>

<p>"Come!" He was beside her again. "You must see where I mean to
put up the new pavilion by the lily pond next summer."</p>

<p>"Ah, but, monsieur," she began. Then she broke off before she
had started to protest.</p>

<p>She could not say simply to him: "Monsieur, a pavilion by the
lily pond is not going to make you happy. It will not change your
life by so much as a single grain. Face your misery, and find some
means to overcome it. Work at something till you ache and the sweat
runs into your eyes. Make haste before it's too late and this
unused power strikes back at you."</p>

<p>"No, I've been away from the schoolroom too long," she said
aloud. "I must go now; besides, I'm cold standing here in this
February wind."</p>

<p>"You don't look cold, Mademoiselle Deluzy," he persisted, his
eyes disarming her by their scrutiny. "Your lips aren't blue, and
your cheeks are positively rosy."</p>

<p>But she did not give in. "I tell you I'm cold," she repeated
stubbornly. She hurried back to the ch&acirc;teau with that queer
mixture of glowing inner warmth and conflict of emotions which was
more and more the aftermath of her meetings with him. Only now she
no longer asked: "Where will it all end?" She acknowledged that she
was caught fast in an intricate web not of her own making. In the
beginning she had believed she could keep free of its threads.
Later she had tried to break away. But now she had given up both
these courses. She had no wish to escape.</p>

<p>In mid-February the older girls returned to Paris, and she had
good reports of their progress in studies from Albert Remey and of
their social doings from Louise, who wrote of theatres and opera
and numerous outings with her mother and her S&eacute;bastiani
cousins. Henriette had more time than she knew how to use, with
Berthe and Raynald her only charges. She busied herself with her
painting; spent much time reading aloud to the old Duchesse; she
read volume after volume to herself in the long evenings; and wrote
letters to her scattered friends. Many of those she wrote that
winter went to Isabella in Turin and to her other ex-pupil in
England, Nina Hislop, who had also been married. These two young
women, who differed so greatly in temperament and upbringing, both
turned to their governess with affectionate confidences. Their
detailed accounts of themselves and their households were hardly as
absorbing to her as to the writers of these lengthy and na&iuml;ve
letters. She often smiled over their characteristic outpourings:
the English girl's, so shy and conventional, so true to the pattern
of domesticity being set by the young Queen; Isabella's less
restrained and far more lively descriptions of social activity and
domestic bliss. But both were happy; their physical contentment and
the secret intoxication of being wives and heads of prosperous
households pervaded every letter and seemed almost to leap out
between the neatly penned words.</p>

<p>"Dearest Mademoiselle," one posted from Sussex might begin,
"your felicitations upon the happy event to which we look forward
in midsummer filled me with joy. I pray that I may be equal to the
responsibilities in store for me, though I must confess that often
I feel very young and not in the least like one so soon to become a
mother. But my dear husband is very devoted and considerate of me
at this time. He quite spoils me with surprises from his visits to
London, and I wish that I might show you his latest one&mdash;a
rosewood drawing-room set, done in crimson damask. How strange to
think that not so long ago I was still a timid schoolgirl, and you
were correcting my French exercises..."</p>

<p>Or it might be: "Ch&eacute;re Mademoiselle: Your letter was most
dear to me. I was homesick at sight of your writing on the familiar
ch&acirc;teau paper, but only for a moment, for though I think
often of the old schoolroom I would not wish to return to it. The
days fly, and each so full of things to see and do, and my dear
husband lavishes every attention he can think of upon me. We dine
out often and entertain frequently ourselves now that we are
settled in our own villa which I can scarcely wait to have you see.
And I am so happy, ch&eacute;re mademoiselle. It seems impossible
that I could ever have entertained those doubts and fears about
which you once tried to reassure me..."</p>

<p>She was proud of these two, and their affectionate gratitude was
sweet to her. Yet, when the letters came, brimming over with happy
confidence, she could not repress a pang. These girls were married
women now&mdash;secure and beloved and already meeting experiences
she lead never known, that perhaps she would never know. Each would
fulfil the destiny that Nature had intended. Soon one would be a
mother, and before long the other would be writing as rapturous an
announcement. And here she sat, still a spinster and a governess. A
dozen such years lay behind her, and no doubt a dozen more lay
ahead. In a few months she would be thirty-four years old. She
flattered herself that she appeared considerably younger than her
age. Still one could not overlook facts. She had not had the means
or the opportunity to marry well. She had only had her youth to
offer for a dowry. And now she no longer had that. It had been
spent, without stint, on the youth of girls like Nina and Isabella.
She did not begrudge it, but sometimes she smiled a little grimly
as she put away their letters.</p>

<p>There was never the faintest hint of bitterness in her answers,
because she loved youth for itself. She had always given herself to
it&mdash;first from necessity and then because it had become a
habit. It was natural for her to reach out to others. She gave
freely all that she had to offer, and by the same token she drew
from others and was nourished even by experiences she might not
share. Like a tree set in meagre soil, she drove her roots in every
direction, seeking the elements her spirit craved.</p>

<p>The talked-of visit to Isabella in Turin came about, however,
far sooner than she had expected.</p>

<h3>Chapter Sixteen</h3>

<p>It was early summer, and the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin had
taken a villa by the sea for the month of June. Dr. Simon had
recommended a watering-place for Madame's health after the winter
in Paris; and since she had not felt equal to the long journey to
Corsica, Dieppe had been chosen. Henriette and the two younger
children had joined the rest of the family there a week before, and
the reunion had been a happy one. The weather was fine, with
sunlight glittering on each wave that broke in rhythmic whiteness
on the beach below their windows. At first the Duchesse was almost
cordial in her meeting with Henriette, though she still refused to
eat at the same table with her.</p>

<p>This had been the first cause of trouble. The villa was far from
large, and serving two separate sets of meals simultaneously could
not be managed as easily as in Paris or at the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>The Duc had made the mistake of trying to argue with her, and of
pointing out her unreasonableness in such petty matters. At last,
when he refused to humour her and even went so far as to take all
his meals with the children and Henriette, the old grievances and
outbursts began. Through the flimsy walls that separated the young
people's apartment from those of their parents Henriette heard the
familiar reverberations of that heavy, accusing voice directed not
so much against the Duc as against herself. No matter what actually
happened to touch off Madame's temper, Henriette knew that it would
somehow end by her being to blame. Though she had long ago learned
immunity to similar tirades, she could not entirely close her eyes
and ears. Once she even begged the Duc to make some sort of
compromise.</p>

<p>"Please, monsieur," she had pleaded, "let me eat alone if that
will help the situation. Quarters here are small, and we must make
adjustments."</p>

<p>"The Duchesse refuses to make any, and I see no reason why the
whole household should be upset to satisfy this whim of hers."</p>

<p>"Then, monsieur, I beg you to dine with her. I hesitate to
interfere in such personal matters; still, if you could humour her
these few weeks for the children's sakes, it would be easier for us
all."</p>

<p>But he shook his head, and the old obdurate expression settled
about his lips. He shrugged expressively.</p>

<p>"If it's not this, it will be something else," he insisted.</p>

<p>She knew then that matters were no better, but worse, between
them. The strain, she guessed, was far greater than before the old
Mar&eacute;chal had given his ultimatum months ago. The very fact
that the Duchesse had her husband's company in public, that to the
eyes of the world they were reunited, only made his indifference to
her in private more unbearable. And she would never let go for an
instant, though what she clung to so doggedly must be more
merciless in its power to hurt than nettles stinging bare
flesh.</p>

<p>"Poor fool," Henriette thought often during those difficult days
by the sea, "she's only goading him and herself to desperation. How
can she and her father be so blind as to believe that their money
can win back his affections? Why can't they see that it only makes
him more bitter because it mocks his manhood. <i>Ciel</i>, I wish
this month at Dieppe were safely over."</p>

<p>Outwardly she took no notice of black moods and rebuffs. But
under her apparent serenity she writhed at this tyranny imposed by
the Duchesse. She seemed bent on infecting the entire household
with her own misery. The children felt the tension and reacted
according to their dispositions. In a week the long anticipated
holiday had taken on the confused unreality of a nightmare.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Henriette thought, "the weak learn kindness in
self-defence; but it's not so with this woman. She must torture
others with her own misfortune. It's terrible when the weak are
also cruel for then we are defenceless against them."</p>

<p>It was a combination that shocked her. It was as if, when these
two elements joined forces, they produced an almost inhuman quality
from which she reacted violently. There were times when she had all
she could do to keep silence as one or another of their little
group suffered. At other times she turned chill with her own
contempt for such exhibitions of petulance and uncontrolled temper.
The only excuse for them, she told herself, must be temporary
madness, and there were occasions when Henriette actually doubted
the Duchesse's sanity.</p>

<p>At such times the children's welfare became her first concern,
and she manoeuvred to keep them away from the villa as much as
possible. Louise and the three middle sisters had acquired
considerable skill at avoiding their mother's demands. So the two
younger ones were most often pounced upon. Almost invariably
disaster followed. Berthe was not easily hurt. She had a thick skin
and seldom let others prick below the surface. But this shell of
indifference which protected her had a particularly irritating
effect upon the Duchesse. Raynald, on the other hand, took his
mother's moods and reproaches to heart. Although he had become
sturdier physically, he could still be nervously upset by any
emotional strain, and his mother's slighting moods reacted upon his
whole system. Particularly he resented any slights, real or
imagined, to his beloved Mademoiselle Deluzy. He would fly like a
furious small dog to her defence, and this the Duchesse naturally
took as a deliberate campaign on Henriette's part to turn her
youngest child against her.</p>

<p>That fortnight in Dieppe grew daily more unendurable. Between
her efforts to appease the Duchesse and her efforts to make the
children respond to unwelcome affection, Henriette's usually steady
nerves felt frayed; and her patience had never been more tried. She
had few chances to talk with the Duc, for she was more than ever
certain that the servants had been ordered to watch them both.
Several of the old ones had left the Praslin service, and the
newcomers were all on the best of terms with Madame Leclerc; so
Henriette knew they would be only too eager to bear tales to her
discredit. She went her way with care and a stubborn determination
to put through the stay without disaster. For disaster was in the
air. She could read the warning signals altogether too well by now,
yet she was unprepared for the storm when it finally broke upon
them.</p>

<p>It had been a glorious, bright blue day, and she had spent most
of it on the sand with Berthe and Raynald while the older girls
went on some expedition with their father. The water had been warm,
and the two children had splashed and bathed delightedly while she
kept watchful eye upon them from under the striped umbrella beside
their bathing machine. They had started back by mid-afternoon
walking along the promenade where the small shops faced the ocean.
Their progress was slow because of numerous shells and starfish
which Raynald insisted upon bringing from the beach. When they were
not pausing to retrieve these treasures from underfoot, Berthe
would be held by some particularly enticing window display.
Half-way to the villa, they met the Duc and the others, and that
meant purchases of toys and sweetmeats. They reached home at last
full of chatter and in gay spirits after the hours of salt air and
sun. The villa seemed deserted, and the drawing-room beckoned cool
and pleasant in its soft grey and rose with the glass doors open to
the terrace and the blue water beyond. They all drifted in, and
presently one of the girls went to a square piano and began trying
the keys.</p>

<p>"Oh, here's some music," Louise exclaimed, looking up from a
cabinet she had been investigating.</p>

<p>Evidently the former tenants of the villa had not been inclined
to classical music. The pieces were all gay and popular, with
waltzes and polkas predominating. Polkas had been the rage for the
past two seasons, and the girls needed no urging to dance. The
drawing-room furniture rocked to the lively tunes and the quick
steps of Marie, C&eacute;leste, Am&eacute;lie and Berthe while
Louise's fingers sped over the black and ivory keys. Henriette
leaned against the sofa cushions and gave herself up to the
infectiousness of dance music and the spontaneity of the girls'
delighted response to it. Their young, slim bodies in full ruffled
skirts moved with such lightness and spirit. Their cheeks grew
flushed, their eyes were starry, and their curls kept time with the
quick steps. Up and down the room they went, weaving in and out of
furniture, now dancing into patches of brightness by the open
doors, now moving into dimmer corners.</p>

<p>With the sea so blue and the music so gay and the young limbs so
slim and sure, Henriette felt entranced. The headache she had been
fighting off after the glare of the beach left her miraculously.
She felt light-hearted and festive, as if the polka had taken
possession of her, too, though only her toes hidden under her wide
skirts gave her away by discreet tapping. She looked across at the
Duc, who stood by the terrace doors. He was watching his daughters
with intent appreciation; and his look disarmed her as it always
did when she caught him unawares, studying his children. All that
was simple and genuine and kind in the man was uppermost then. She
stared at him fascinated, while the artist in her tried to fix that
image clearly in her mind. She wished that she had the power to
paint him as she saw him in that moment of affectionate
relaxation.</p>

<p>He looked over in her direction and smiled as their eyes
met.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," Louise pleaded, "couldn't you play one polka for
'us? I haven't had a chance to leave the piano. Please do."</p>

<p>Henriette obligingly took her place, and presently she saw
Louise catch her father's hands and lead him into the room as her
partner. She had never seen the Duc in this r&ocirc;le before,
though she had always known that he must be a superb dancer. As she
saw him begin the lively steps with that easy, effortless grace,
she envied Louise, and for the next few minutes she scarcely lifted
her eyes from the sheets of music before her. Then, growing more
familiar with the notes, she allowed herself to look up and catch
glimpses of the reflected scene in a long mirror that faced the
piano.</p>

<p>It was in one of these glimpses that she became obsessed by a
peculiar sensation&mdash;not of arrested motion in space, but
rather as if all motion were gathered in that room, embodied in the
whirling dancers and her own speeding fingers. She bent to the keys
in sudden frenzy. She was possessed with the idea of keeping alive
this gaiety, this lovely rhythm which would die when she stopped
playing as surely as it had been born when the music began. In her
ten fingers lay the power to evoke this miracle of motion. This
must not end, this must not be over. Quick feet, stepping so surely
and freely in unison; warm swaying bodies and glowing
cheeks&mdash;it was as if she saw them all cold and still for ever.
But the revelation only spurred her on. She played faster and more
furiously, gaining what rest she could on some longer note as it
flew past her like the flight of a bird seen from a train window.
And always, under the music her hands made, a warning beat in her
ears, faint and fine as the imprisoned whisper of sea in a shell:
"Some day you will remember all this; some day when time has caught
up with these swift feet and all of you in this room are scattered
to the four winds."</p>

<p>Over and over she played the tune, her own tireless energy
willing the dancers to go on without pause. It was only when a
sudden shadow darkened the mirror and Raynald plucked anxiously at
her arm, that her hands fell limply into her lap. Unable to rise
from the piano bench, she turned and saw the Duchesse standing
alone in the doorway. For a moment no one moved, the dancers stood
still where they had left off. Then she saw the heavy figure bear
down upon them, trailing yards of violet silk as she came.</p>

<p>"So, Theo," the tense throaty voice was beginning, "so I find
you at last after hours of waiting! What excuse have you to give me
this time?"</p>

<p>"Excuse?" he announced with determined casualness, keeping his
arm about Louise. "Why, Fanny, surely I need no excuse to be here
at home, dancing with my own daughters?"</p>

<p>Before she spoke again the Duchesse's glance swept the room and
rested suspiciously upon Henriette, who still sat before the mute
piano.</p>

<p>"You need not try to mend matters by making light of them."</p>

<p>The dark eyes flashed, and Henriette caught the peculiar reddish
lustre that she had come to dread in them. It was like an ominous
light in the sky that always preceded some cataclysm. The girls
shifted uneasily and drew together; Raynald pressed closer.</p>

<p>"Isn't it enough for you to humiliate me at home, without doing
it publicly as well? Do you think I enjoyed being made a fool of
before them all at the Villa Quelques Fleurs?"</p>

<p>"At the Villa Quelques Fleurs? What are you talking about,
Fanny?"</p>

<p>"Where we were invited this afternoon by Signor and Signora
Mantino, and where I've been waiting for you to join me for the
last hour and a half. Do you think I enjoyed their questions about
your absence and the sly looks they exchanged when I had to leave
alone? And all the time I made excuses that no one believed, you
were here, enjoying yourself&mdash;without a thought of me except
to laugh and say: 'While the cat's away, the mice will play.' Oh, I
know what goes on behind my back!"</p>

<p>"Please, Fanny, be still for a moment." He dropped Louise's arm
and stepped in front of the girls. "I knew nothing about this
invitations, this appointment that I failed to keep."</p>

<p>"And you care nothing, that's plain. But if you'd taken the
trouble to read what I wrote you this morning you'd have known. I
left it myself at your door since I'm not permitted to speak to you
any longer, except when you feel in the mood to grant me a few
minutes of your time."</p>

<p>He must have left the Duchesse's letter unread. Henriette
guessed that from the way he reddened at mention of it. But he
managed to keep his voice cool and deliberate.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if I caused you inconvenience," he explained. "But I
left my room early to take the older girls on a little outing.
We've only just returned, and I dare say the letter is lying now
unopened on my secretary."</p>

<p>"And I dare say there are many others unopened there and in your
waste-basket; or perhaps you and mademoiselle use them to light the
fire. Perhaps she even enjoys keeping my letters for curl-papers.
It's the sort of irony that would please her."</p>

<p>Henriette did not hear his response. The Duchesse's attack had
been so unexpected that composure left her. The drawing-room and
the figures in it turned hazy before her eyes. She felt a dull
pounding in her ears, but whether it came from the surf on the
beach below the terrace or from the blood that mounted in a hot
wave to her neck and cheeks and forehead she could never tell. She
wanted to rise and lead the children from that room. The Duchesse
seemed to fill it with her own distorted imagination. But Henriette
could not move. She had no power to make herself leave the piano.
The little black notes of music moved fantastically before her
eyes, and she could scarcely focus her attention on the flow of
words that came across the room. She knew that they concerned her.
Out of the vehement torrent of this other woman's rage she caught
her own name, recurring again and again, almost like a refrain.</p>

<p>"No, Theo, no! You can't stop me. I've kept silence too long.
Let the children know how you torture their mother; how you and
this woman have turned them against me. Some day they'll
understand, when their own hearts are breaking from neglect and
cruelty; only then it will be too late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fanny, in God's name, I beg you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may well call on Him, for He knows my sorrows and my tears
and my prayers. Yes, God knows what I've suffered ever since you
brought Mademoiselle Deluzy here. As if I hadn't been shamed enough
before she came. And now I'm ridiculed or pitied wherever I go. I
see it in people's eyes whether they humiliate me by words or not.
And she sits at the head of my table while I eat alone like an
outcast in my own house. You and my children hang on her every
word. It's mademoiselle this and mademoiselle that, till I declare
she has more wiles than the serpent in the Garden of Eden!"</p>

<p>Her voice broke, and a second of horrified silence followed
before Raynald lifted up his head and answered with a shrillness
that brought Henriette back to her senses.</p>

<p>"No," the little boy cried, and she felt his whole frame
trembling beside her. "No, mademoiselle isn't a serpent. She's good
and kind, and I love her. I love her, and I hate you!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Henriette laid her hand to his lips and tried to quiet
the wild sobs that overtook him. "Be quiet, Raynald. Please,
<i>ch&eacute;rie,</i> please."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but she called you wicked names. Sh&mdash;she has no
right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, you see, even Raynald, my baby, takes her part. She's
bewitched you all, and I might as well be dead and out of your way
for ever."</p>

<p>"Fanny, please, you must listen to reason."</p>

<p>The Duc laid a restraining hand on her arm. But his touch only
seemed to excite her. Her resentment had been gathering for days,
and now nothing could stop the savage force of it, not even her
children drawing away from her in a frightened, wide-eyed group. He
kept his hand on her arm. Henriette guessed the intensity of his
feeling from the way his fingers sank into the plumpness under the
violet silk. What a grip he had! His strength must be phenomenal
when he was roused. Such a change had come over his face that she
recoiled before the transformation. Only a few minutes ago he had
been a different human being. Now all that was amiable and pleasant
and kind had given way to hardness and cruelty and a positive
hatred. The features themselves actually seemed to have altered
before her eyes; to have assumed the crude exaggeration of a
painted mask.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu,"</i> she thought, "if she should try him beyond
the limits of his endurance! I must do something. I mustn't sit
here and let this go on."</p>

<p>The Duchesse had begun speaking again, her voice now heavy and
accusing, now rising with uncontrolled shrillness. Henriette no
longer heard the words she was saying. With an effort she forced
herself to rise from the piano bench. Keeping firm hold of
Raynald's hand, she moved forward.</p>

<p>"Madame, monsieur." The clear firm tones of her voice silenced
the Duchesse's hysterical outpouring for a moment. She regarded
Henriette out of eyes that had the glassy stare of a half-crazed
animal. "With your permission I will take the children to their
rooms."</p>

<p>Raynald shrank against her, his face hidden. The five girls
pressed closer. Their stiff full skirts made a faint rustling in
the sudden quiet.</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble, mademoiselle." The Duchesse's voice fell
like whiplash upon them all. "Don't think of inconveniencing
yourself on my account! No, go back to the piano. Go on with your
music. Dance, all of you! Don't give your mother a thought. Let me
go Theo, let me go!"</p>

<p>She shook him off before he could restrain her, and made for the
terrace They saw her disappear down the steps that led to the
sea.</p>

<p>So abrupt had been her bolt from the room that for a full moment
not one of them uttered a sound or moved. Yet they had all caught
the desperate note in her voice. There was not a doubt what she
meant to do.</p>

<p>"Papa! Papa!" Louise found her voice first. "Don't let her!"</p>

<p>She would have followed her father as he started through the
long doors, but he pushed her away. Then he ran hatless towards the
water.</p>

<p>Mechanically Henriette heard herself quieting the sobbing
Raynald and reassuring the sisters. But all the time she helped
them put away the scattered sheets of music and set the disordered
room to rights her ears were strained for any unnatural sounds from
the beach or promenade. Any moment she expected to hear warning
shouts from below; and as time passed she waited for the tread of
men's boots on the flagstones as they bore a lifeless form in
dripping violet silk between them. But half an hour passed, and the
house remained quiet; the waves twinkled blue in the sun and broke
in steady rhythm on the hard-packed sand. The tears dried on the
children's faces though they still appeared strained and furtive
and they spoke in scared whispers. Raynald clung to her as had been
his habit years before. He gulped forlornly and could hardly be
persuaded to spread his sea treasures to dry in a tray on the
window-sill.</p>

<p>It was another half-hour before the sound of steps and voices
from the next apartment told her that tragedy had been averted.
With relief she recognised Madame's voice speaking to her maid.</p>

<p>She did not see the Duc again till they gathered for early
dinner. He reappeared just as the soup was being served,
immaculately dressed for the evening. Only a faint tension about
his eyes and at the corners of his mouth gave any hint of his
recent experience. That was plain from his manner and the brief,
curt assurance to his daughters that their mother was quite herself
again and that he did not wish to discuss what had taken place in
the drawing-room. To a timid question from Louise he replied
guardedly that Mamma had been badly affected by driving in the
strong sunshine. She had taken something to quiet her nerves before
retiring.</p>

<p>But the strain of the afternoon had been too great for Raynald.
Half-way through the meal he grew pale, slipped from his chair, and
left the table with a hurried excuse. Following him to his room
Henriette found the boy struggling against an attack of nausea. She
made him as comfortable as possible and sat by his bed till he fell
asleep at last, exhausted, and she could return to the others.</p>

<p>The Duc was playing chess with C&eacute;leste, but he called
Louise to take his place. Henriette found herself following him to
a balcony which opened from the room. It did not adjoin the next
apartment, so they were sure of privacy there.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she spoke to him through the darkness, "I must know
if she is safe. She did herself no harm?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not this time, though I thought it was the end.
Perhaps it might have been better so&mdash;God forgive me for what
I say."</p>

<p>"Tell me what happened? What did she try to do? You were gone so
long I almost went mad listening."</p>

<p>"There was no sign of her on the beach. I ran along it, as close
to the water's edge as I could get. People pointed to me. They must
have thought I'd lost my mind. Then I decided she must have made
for the amusement pier&mdash;perhaps she'd even plunged from it
already. I kept looking everywhere for that violet dress and I was
afraid to ask people if they'd seen her. But as I started back
along the Promenade, in one of those little shops I caught sight of
her. There she was, bending over a tray full of knick-knacks,
talking to the shopkeeper and picking out what she wanted."</p>

<p>"It's not possible, monsieur. How did she seem then?"</p>

<p>"Calmer than I am now. I stood beside her while she made the
purchases. Then I called a carriage and made her get in. We drove
back, and I left her at the door of her own room."</p>

<p>"Did she have anything more to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. It was exactly as if that scene you witnessed had
never been. I was too unnerved myself to bring it up. My one idea
was to see her safely indoors."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of it except that we mustn't run the
risk of another. She's never given way like this before the
children. They are not to be subjected to it again."</p>

<p>"They've heard enough to-day, monsieur. Whether they know what
she meant or why she turned on me, they guessed she meant to kill
herself. They realise that she hates me. Raynald is ill now as a
result. What am I to do? I can't stay on here, that's plain."</p>

<p>"You will take Louise and the two youngest and go to Turin at
once. There's a train you can catch to Paris to-morrow noon.
Isabella has been begging for a visit, and the change will do
Raynald good. Yes, that's the best plan."</p>

<p>He was so close to her there in the darkness on the narrow iron
balcony that she could hear him draw a deep breath of relief at the
decision he had made. Even without seeing him she was acutely aware
of his bewilderment and confusion, of his need of her. They
whispered together like two frightened children who had just
escaped from danger, but who clung to one another because they knew
that even greater danger might be lying just ahead.</p>

<p>"And after Turin&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>She wanted so much to take his hand that she had to keep both
her own pressed to the cold iron railing at her back.</p>

<p>"God knows," he murmured. "We'll face that when it comes. Act as
if this had never been. Put the children off if they question you,
and in a fortnight she'll no doubt be urging your return."</p>

<p>"But I must think of myself, monsieur. You heard her this
afternoon. She&mdash;she wasn't quite human. That's what terrifies
me. I think she's deranged, particularly so where I am concerned.
You know I've tried to go before, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He reached out and laid his hand on her shoulder. The pressure
of his strong fingers came hotly through the thin material of her
dress.</p>

<p>"And now you will go in and pack your things and get a long
night's rest. The train leaves at noon to-morrow precisely."</p>

<p>"But it's no use to bury one's head in the sand like a silly
ostrich when facts must be faced."</p>

<p>"I shall see you to the train. Arrangements will be made for you
to spend the night in Paris at the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; and continue south the day after."</p>

<p>"Please listen to me, monsieur. I've Only brought you trouble,
though I've tried to do my best for you, for the children."</p>

<p>"And I'd consider it a great favour, Mademoiselle Deluzy, if you
would see that Berthe and Louise write their mother from Turin.
Perhaps you also would write her a letter with your own impression
of Isabella. Such a letter would please the Duchesse, but of course
I shall leave that to you. You have excellent judgment in all
things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In all but one, monsieur"&mdash;she moved away from him towards
the room where the girls clustered together in the
lamplight&mdash;"or I should never let you persuade me against my
better judgment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you'll do what I ask? Good! I'll order the carriage for
eleven to-morrow."</p>

<p>She wavered there on the doorsill, then impulsively turned back
to him and the darkness. She felt the warm strength of his great
frame behind her, and for a brief moment she let herself lean
against it.</p>

<p>"You ask too much." She drew away resolutely. "Do I have to tell
you that what happened this afternoon is sure to happen again?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing you could tell me that I do not know already.
But if I should tell you what my days and nights have become you'd
understand what it means to have you here in my household. One
snatches a moment now and then to forget. To be happy&mdash;that's
why I'm asking this of you, for the children, most of all for
myself."</p>

<p>"Monsieur"&mdash;she dared not let him guess how the urgency of
his appeal affected her&mdash;"I'd help you if I could, but there's
little enough I can do. I've only brought discord and scandal to
your household, at least to the eyes of the world."</p>

<p>"Who cares for the world? I didn't suppose, Mademoiselle Deluzy,
that with your courage, your independence, you'd let yourself be
dictated to by gossip and convention."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I've been too independent because my own conscience was
clear. But I'm beginning to realise that when we break through the
shell of convention we can never crawl back into it again. That
protection is gone. I've gained many things by staying here with
your children, monsieur, but I've lost much also."</p>

<p>"And you'd do it again because you're brave and generous,
wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>She was moved by the simple directness of his question. His
almost childish trust in her devotion and integrity were more
eloquent than any other appeal he might have made.</p>

<p>"I will go to Turin to-morrow," she told him at last.</p>

<p>Bending over her boxes and portmanteau later that evening, she
asked herself again and again why she had not held out against him.
Where was her spirit that she had not written the Duchesse a letter
of resignation before she put out her lamp for the night? What had
become of her pride? At what moment in the five years that lay
behind her had she let that precious commodity slip out of her
keeping?</p>

<h3>Chapter Seventeen</h3>

<p>The reunion with Isabella was so delightful that they lingered
in Turin for the rest of the summer. After those days in Dieppe
this carefree interlude in new surroundings reacted upon the young
people like wine. It was like old times, they all agreed, to be
together again. Isabella's young husband made a most agreeable
host, and when it became necessary for him to go to Sardinia on
business, he was grateful to leave his wife in such congenial
company. She and Louise were inseparable. When the older sisters
had plans of their own Henriette took Berthe and Raynald on long
drives and excursions. She found distraction in this. It eased her
of problems she could never quite shake from her mind. So they
visited the Cathedral, the palaces, and explored the outlying
regions for relics of early Roman civilisation. "See," she would
point out, "this is part of the old wall. The Romans built it
before Christ was born, and here we sit and rest ourselves on it in
the year 1846. It's strange to think that what men's hands built a
thousand years ago can still endure."</p>

<p>In making the past vivid to the children she was often able to
forget the present, more particularly the future. But there were
other times when she would grow absent-minded in the middle of
something she was saying till Berthe or Raynald prompted her
politely. This happened once as they were examining some stonework
in a chapel.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Berthe had pointed to a design of leaves and crude but
unmistakably carved mice. "Why do they have such horrid things as
mice in a church?"</p>

<p>The priest who was showing them about had smiled
indulgently.</p>

<p>"It's part of an ancient legend from the East," he explained.
"No one knows how old it is or how it found its way into a
Christian church. But the story concerns a traveller lost in a far
country, who is perishing from thirst. At last he sees a plant
growing above a precipice. On its broad leaves is a flower, its cup
filled with delicious nectar. The traveller manages by clinging to
the stalk to reach the cup, but just as he prepares to quench his
thirst he sees below him two mice, one white and one black,
nibbling the stem which is his only support. Slowly they are eating
it, fibre by fibre. When they meet, the traveller knows that he
will be swept away to destruction, but still he puts his lips to
the flower's cup and drinks."</p>

<p>"And what then, <i>mon p&egrave;re?"</i> Raynald's eyes were
wide and dark.</p>

<p>"Well, my son, there's no more to the story. We call it an
allegory, and I can only explain it to you in symbols. That
traveller stands for all men who have ever lived on earth. The mice
are day and night&mdash;one white, one black; and they slowly
nibble time away from under us. Yet, even in the face of certain
death, men still reach for the good things of life and find them
sweet to the taste."</p>

<p>The children were not impressed. Already they had found some new
distraction. But Henriette lingered by the primitive piece of
stone-cutting, and when they left she thanked the priest for his
trouble and dropped more coins than usual in the alms box. She
could not put the legend out of her mind. It seemed to have
survived the ages solely for her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she told herself. "I know that leaf above the precipice.
I know because I'm clinging to it now, and the mice are eating my
days and nights away. But how many of us, I wonder, cling to leaves
that hold no nectar?"</p>

<p>She no longer twisted and turned possibilities this way and
that. She went from one day to the next, and the old dread lifted
like a fog bank from her immediate horizon. She would go back to
Paris with an open mind and decide then upon the wisest course. She
would talk to Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod, tell him something of
her difficulties, and asks his advice. Autumn would be a better
time to seek another position if need be. Here in Turin the
problems of the Praslin household no longer closed in about her.
She did not feel completely surrounded by domestic intrigue and
conflicting emotions from which she could never escape. Almost she
convinced herself that everything might come out right in the end
if she could be patient enough.</p>

<p>This hope was encouraged in late August by the arrival of a
letter from Melun, addressed to Henriette in the Duchesse's own
hand. It was in reply to a rather guarded and perfunctory report
she had sent the Duchesse about her daughters.</p>

<blockquote>Praslin, August 25, 1846.<br>
<br>
I will not delay a moment further, my dear mademoiselle, in
thanking you for your kind letter which gave me great pleasure. You
apologised for its length, but far from finding it tedious, I could
have wished it to have been twice as long. It was brought me with
Berthe's from the village post office this evening. Truly I cannot
deny that it was time a letter reached me, for my head and my heart
had been much disturbed by the long silence. But all's well that
ends well.<br>
<br>
You can guess how overjoyed I am at all you tell me of Isabella and
her happiness. But I am rather surprised that you should find her
so unchanged by the new life and experiences. Her letters to me
show a great difference, so much more painstaking and
expansive.<br>
<br>
I am indeed counting on your kindness in continuing to send me
information about my absent ones. My little girls here are
constantly at my side. On fine days we spend hours in the Park, and
often we gather and read aloud from the works of Moli&egrave;re.
There has been an epidemic of fever in the neighbourhood, so we
live completely isolated; but, far from being prisoners, my dear
daughters and I are enjoying our solitude.<br>
<br>
I was glad to hear that both Louise and Berthe speak of me often
with Isabella, even though you may only have mentioned this to
please me. But in any case the words brought happy tears to my
eyes.<br>
<br>
Forgive, dear mademoiselle, this poor letter, written from the
fullness of my heart. Once more I thank you a thousand times for
your note; and I beg you to write me further details, as I could
never hear enough of them.<br>
<br>
FANNY S&Eacute;BASTIANI PRASLIN.</blockquote>

<p>This letter Henriette read and re-read, trying to fathom the
mood and meaning behind its unusual affability. What could she do
but take it in the spirit of goodwill in which it had evidently
been written? She knew the Duchesse was not clever or subtle enough
by nature to assume a r&ocirc;le she did not feel. Whatever her
faults she was at least sincere and simple to the point of
primitiveness. Henriette could only hope that the outburst at
Dieppe had cleared the air. Perhaps it took violent measures to
purge so violent a nature of accumulated grievances. If she
regretted her behaviour and wished to be reconciled, Henriette
would certainly meet her half-way; and if the unfortunate attack
had passed from her mind completely, then at least their next
meeting would be less difficult. That, Henriette decided as she put
the extraordinary letter away in her writing-case, was all she
could make of it for the present.</p>

<p>Looking back to those last months of 1846 and the early winter
of 1847, she was always at a loss to explain why they should have
been so harmonious and uneventful. She returned, refreshed and
girded for battle, only to find peace and reconciliation both at
Melun and later on in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;. The
scene at Dieppe and the other stormy sessions she had had with the
Duchesse began to take on the unreality of bad dreams. A sort of
tacit understanding, a mutual truce, seemed to have been
established between them: They were not trustful of each other, but
now they could meet without sparks flying. Even the servants,
though they continued to range their loyalty on the side of their
mistress, were less hostile to the governess.</p>

<p>Henriette asked no more than that she should be left to her
duties without interference, and the Duc on his part seemed
thankful for even temporary peace in the household. He continued to
take his meals with the children and Henriette, but a slight
compromise in this matter appeared to have eased the situation. The
old Mar&eacute;chal had taken up residence in his quarters and the
Duchesse took her meals with him. Each day one of the four older
girls joined them at <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> or dinner. Furthermore
the Duchesse's health had improved sufficiently for her to attend
more theatres and concerts than usual; and Henriette, to her great
surprise, was often included in the party. In these invitations she
suspected the hand of the Mar&eacute;chal, who doubtless felt it
would be advisable for the governess to be seen in public with his
daughter. Henriette did her best not to abuse the privilege. It was
strange to find herself in favour again. Often it was difficult to
adjust herself to this new state of affairs after the long
estrangement. She tried to put suspicion from her, though she still
unconsciously braced herself for slights before they came her way.
"Take heed of a wind that comes in at a hole and a reconciled
enemy" was an old saying that constantly recurred to her that
winter.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas, Louise's betrothal was announced, and the
household united in celebration. She was to marry a man somewhat
her senior, and the marriage would not take place for another year.
Between this and holiday festivities it was New Year's Day again
before Henriette realised that another year had gone.</p>

<p>Albert Remey came daily to the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; to continue his teaching. Henriette
took comfort in this and in her visits to these old friends. She
went to see Madame Le Maire, too, though her free afternoons were
rare. The Reverend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod she heard preach
occasionally, but the chance to talk with him as she had planned
did not materialise. Either there were other visitors to his study,
or time was pressing; so she postponed asking his advice. Sometimes
she discussed her difficulties with Albert and Marie, but their own
ideally happy marriage and their complete loyalty to her made it
impossible for their judgment to be altogether unbiased. In their
eyes Henriette could do no wrong. They could only insist that the
difference in religion must be to blame for the Duchesse's
prejudices. Like Henriette, they belonged to the Protestant faith,
and like herself, they knew that this could present serious
difficulties. Albert had forfeited several teaching appointments
because of his religious beliefs and, as he frequently pointed out,
it was only the Duc de Praslin's tolerance in such matters that had
given them their present opportunities.</p>

<p>Madame Le Maire, however, gave her opinion gratis and
frequently.</p>

<p>"The sooner you get clear of these Praslins, the better," the
old woman insisted. "That's no household for a girl like you to be
in."</p>

<p>"But I'm not exactly a girl any more."</p>

<p>"Well, you're far more dangerous than if you were one. Remember
you're just enough younger than his wife and older than his
daughters to attract a man like the Duc. And you can be altogether
too attractive when you care to be."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, you flatter me!"</p>

<p>"I'm not flattering. I'm warning you, as I did before you ever
took up your duties there; before your name got into print."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you read the scandal sheets, Madame Le Maire!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I read what all Paris reads, and I can make as much
of it as the next one. Apparently you can't, or you'd have sense
enough not to sail so near to the wind."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of this wind you speak of." Madame's croakings
only made Henriette feel more confident in her own ability. "I'm
used to steering through rough waters and narrow courses, and I
like managing my own boat."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, but wait till your boat capsizes, as it's
bound to some day. Then you'll be glad enough to come back to the
Rue du Harlay."</p>

<p>Henriette always shrugged and changed the subject at this point.
No use arguing with one who always expected the worst of any
situation. She wondered, idly, what harsh blows life could have
dealt this obstinate old woman to make her so sceptical. She hoped,
if she herself lived to be as old, she would not fall into the same
mould of bitterness. Still, in her heart, she knew that Madame's
cold eyes were more shrewd than either Albert's or Marie's; that
she was as wise in her untutored way as the Reverend
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod.</p>

<p>The weeks slipped by. Spring blew into Paris once more with its
aromatic invitation to the country. But the Praslin family did not
accept as usual, for the Duc was to take his place in the House of
Peers in April. All that winter he had been much absorbed in
matters of politics and had spent, more time than formerly at the
palace. He had always been a favourite with the King who, feeling
the growing dissatisfaction in the country, leaned more heavily for
support on the younger peers. Henriette felt relieved at this new
interest in affairs outside his personal life, even though she
disapproved of Louis-Philippe and his policies. The Duc was more
guarded now in his remarks to her upon affairs in the country, and
she on her part was careful not to express her own opinions so
freely. He spent less time in the schoolroom of late, and it seemed
to her that he deliberately avoided opportunities that would throw
them together. She missed the stimulation of their earlier and more
frequent meetings, but she knew it was better for all concerned
that they should meet less often. Yet always she felt the
cross-currents of restlessness and dissatisfaction in him. She knew
he craved her approval and reassurance whether he asked them of her
or not.</p>

<p>One particular day she was always to remember out of that spring
because he shared it with her; because some fortunate wind of
chance seemed to have given it to them without plan or forethought.
She had promised to drive to Versailles with Berthe and Raynald on
the first fine Saturday in April; and when the morning came and
they were being stowed into the carriage, the Duc had unexpectedly
appeared to join the expedition. He was in excellent humour, and
all their 'spirits mounted as they left the city behind. After they
reached Versailles the four went on foot in search of a place to
eat lunch in the open. The palace itself did not appeal to Berthe
and Raynald. The fountains were not playing that day, and the
children's hearts were set elsewhere. They wanted to find the
remains of Marie Antoinette's <i>hameau</i> with its thatched
cottages and barns and dovecots in half-ruin. They must explore the
mysterious rock grotto, once dedicated to the god of love, and they
must eat their luncheon by the fish pond and the little stream that
had been brought there for a Queen's pleasure, and that still
gurgled among artificially piled rocks that were green now with
more than half a century of moss.</p>

<p>"Here, here it is!" the two children called as they came on the
pathetically romantic little group of buildings. "Look, Papa, that
must have been the mill over there. Mademoiselle, see how the brook
tumbles over the little waterfall!"</p>

<p>Their delight in this deserted miniature world was contagious.
Henriette could not help thinking that Marie Antoinette herself
would have been pleased by this tribute paid so many years
afterward to her favourite toy. The three left her with the lunch
basket while they explored the little stream and hunted for the
hidden Grotto of Love. She spread a carriage rug on the steps of a
tiny peasant cottage and, seating herself upon it, let the
melancholy charm of the place work its will.</p>

<p>How still it was, and yet alive with the pulses of spring! The
air came fresh and redolent with earthy dampness. The warm noon sun
touched her with the same magnetic rays that summoned green grass
blades from brown loam; that urged buds to uncurl on bare branches.
Nothing disturbed the peace of that small clearing. Not even a
caretaker passed on his rounds. Henriette relaxed against the
mouldering wall, noticing as she did so faint remnants of the paint
that had been cunningly laid on to give the impression of worn
bricks and plaster chipped away. It struck her as ironical that
this subterfuge should remain. No need now, she thought, for the
builder to simulate age. It made her think of some child who draws
lines on a smooth brow, believing that wrinkles will not leave
their marks there soon enough.</p>

<p>And yet she could understand how one might believe that nothing
could ever shatter the peace and sunny quiet of this place. She
felt glad the mob had not wrecked it in their madness all those
years ago. It seemed, in those few moments, almost like a personal
refuge for her and for the birds, nesting and flying all about. She
reached into the basket for a bit of bread and watched them find
it, even as some remote feathered ancestors might have eaten cake
crumbs from a Queen's table.</p>

<p>Later, over their luncheon, the four talked of that unfortunate
Queen. She seemed curiously real to them all that day, almost as if
she were their absent hostess.</p>

<p>"It must have been fun to fish in the pond," Raynald observed.
"I wish I had a line now to try."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Marie Antoinette fished here, too?" Berthe
added.</p>

<p>"I believe she did," the Duc told her. "At least that's what
they say. But she only played at catching them. If one came to her
hook, she always made someone throw it back. She had such a tender
heart, you see."</p>

<p>"Then why did they have to kill her, Papa?"</p>

<p>For answer the Duc only shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why did they, mademoiselle?" Raynald persisted.</p>

<p>"Well, the people were poor and hungry. They thought she and the
King spent too much money. It cost a great deal to build just this
little hamlet, and then there were the palaces and the fountains
and the gardens. After all it was the people's money, and they
didn't like being half starved and poor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that's ridiculous&mdash;every one can't be rich. Some
people have to be poor, don't they?"</p>

<p>Berthe dismissed the whole subject as she flung a crust to the
birds.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's another question for mademoiselle to answer." The
Duc gave Henriette a sly smile. "But at least I can see," he added,
"you haven't been making them into little Republicans to fit your
own views."</p>

<p>"I doubt if Berthe could be made anything but a Royalist," she
told him with amusement. "She was born to the purple, monsieur. She
and Marie Antoinette would have had much in common."</p>

<p>"They don't cut off kings' and queens' heads any more, do they
Papa?" Raynald inquired a trifle anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not lately," his father answered. "That's as much as any one
can say."</p>

<p>Berthe and Raynald went off presently to pick wild flowers. The
Duc stretched out his long legs and lighted a cigar while Henriette
gathered up the luncheon things. For some time neither spoke. There
seemed no need for words in the sunny contentment of the moment. At
last he broke the silence, his voice coming slowly between fragrant
puffs, his eyes following the children as they moved about under
the clumps of old trees.</p>

<p>"It's strange," he said, "that we should be here. I wonder what
Marie Antoinette would think of the guests at her <i>hameau</i>
to-day?"</p>

<p>"She would think well of you and your children, monsieur, but
not so much of me, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because she would be suspicious of me and the world I belong
to, even though she came to understand many things and many sorts
of people before she died, poor soul."</p>

<p>"You're inconsistent. You despise what she stood for, yet you
say poor soul."</p>

<p>"I say 'poor soul,' and I mean it. She paid dearly for what she
learned too late."</p>

<p>"So do we all." The old bitterness tinged his voice. "We all pay
for experience, and then it's too late to make use of it. But I was
thinking that you're rather alike in one respect. She was
ambitious, Mademoiselle Deluzy, and so are you."</p>

<p>"I used to think I had ambition, monsieur, but now I'm not so
sure. It may have been only discontent. They're easily
confused."</p>

<p>"And you're not discontented any more?"</p>

<p>"Not often. It's only&mdash;" She broke off uncertainly and then
went on, "Sometimes it's not easy caring for what doesn't belong to
you."</p>

<p>"But once you've cared for a thing it becomes yours."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but I used the wrong word. I was really speaking of
people." She looked up and met his eyes. The directness of the look
in them made her turn her own away. "It's not the same, this
tending plants whose seeds you haven't sown. Well, that's what it
is to be a governess, monsieur." She bent to gather up a crumb from
the robe and laughed unsteadily before she could trust herself to
go on. "But I never mean to sound complaining&mdash;not to-day of
all days, when I'm so happy here in this place."</p>

<p>He smiled and shrugged again.</p>

<p>"I believe you're more sentimental about this place than I, for
all your fine talk of progress and changing times. Do you know,
Mademoiselle Deluzy, I was thinking just now that life, like
history, has its quiet moments between revolts."</p>

<p>He seldom spoke so gravely, and she was moved by his words. She
felt as if he were trying to tell her that he had accepted his own
misery; that he no longer hoped for anything better for himself,
except perhaps such brief moments as this, free from reproaches and
demands. Resignation always affected her, whether she met it in man
or child or beast. She could never bear to see defeat in eyes, or
the droop of shoulders bent to any yoke. It was better, she knew,
that he should not struggle against his fate. Yet she missed the
old rebellion in him.</p>

<p>"Let's hope," he went on after they had both been silent and
preoccupied for a while, "that because we've shared Marie
Antoinette's happiness here, we need not also share her grief."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, monsieur, I don't believe we can ever really share
that. Perhaps it's the reason why we're able to forget pain and
sorrow, because we must always bear them alone."</p>

<p>He turned and regarded her intently. "You're right," he said.
"Only happiness can be shared with another, and we so remember it,
as I shall remember this hour here."</p>

<p>"If only it could last!" She sighed.</p>

<p>"It lasts as long as it's remembered."</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and went in search of the straying children.
She watched him move away across the sunny spaces, and his words
stayed with her because they were so unlike his usual manner of
speaking. It was the last time she was ever to talk with him
so&mdash;quietly, without constraint and fear, and the dread of
spying eyes and ears.</p>

<p>The long drive back was uneventful, but the children chattered
and waved and remarked on a hundred passing sights. They were late
in reaching home; the lamplighters of Paris were making their
rounds; and the windows of 55 Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;
were already alight. As the carriage clattered into the courtyard,
Henriette noticed a figure emerging from the doors. She recognised
the tall, black-robed form of the Abb&eacute; Gallard. She saw that
he watched their arrival, though he did not come forward to greet
the Duc and the children.</p>

<p><i>"Bonjour, mon p&egrave;re,"</i> Raynald called out as he
spied him, while Berthe curtsied.</p>

<p>"Hardly <i>bonjour,</i> my children," the Abb&eacute; responded
to their greeting. "The day is already over. I waited till late
hoping to see you and hear your prayers."</p>

<p>"Well, there's to-morrow, isn't there?" Berthe muttered
impatiently.</p>

<p>Henriette hoped the Abb&eacute; had not heard her. It was
unfortunate enough that he had met them returning together from the
long day's outing without impudence being added. The Duc greeted
their religious adviser rather hastily, she thought, as she turned
to go indoors. Something made her look back, and through the iron
grillwork she saw that the Abb&eacute; had not left the courtyard.
Retracing his steps, he followed them into the entrance hall. But
he did not continue up the staircase. Instead she saw him turn in
the direction of the old Mar&eacute;chal S&eacute;bastiani's
private apartments. His soft-shod feet made no sound on the marble
floors, and his spare body in its dark garments moved with a
sepulchral, unhurried tread, like a black cat, going stealthily
upon some secret errand of its own. An errand, she felt, that in
some way concerned herself.</p>

<h3>Chapter Eighteen</h3>

<p>It takes only a small spark to set the explosive free, and the
dynamite of human emotion is no exception to the rule. When the
charge is ready, the least friction may light the fuse. For six
years the feud between Henriette and the Duchesse had been
gathering force, but it was June, 1847, before it was ready to be
touched off.</p>

<p>The trouble began over a trifling domestic matter, though
Henriette had suspected, ever since her return from the expedition
to Versailles, that the old Mar&eacute;chal and the Abb&eacute; had
joined forces against her. Lisette, one of the two maids in special
attendance on the young ladies, happened to be the cause. Lisette
had long been a trial to Henriette. She was devoted to the
children, particularly to Berthe, but she had an annoying manner of
self-importance, and it pleased her to disregard the governess's
orders whenever possible. Because she had come from Corsica and was
the daughter of an old nurse in the S&eacute;bastiani household, a
bond existed between her and the Duchesse. Lisette knew herself to
be a favourite with her mistress, and the knowledge gave her an
assurance which could become insolence with the slightest excuse.
Henriette had had more than one tilt with her; but always the
maid's violations of orders had been minor offences, irritating to
the nerves and disastrous to the children's discipline, but not
worth an issue with Madame.</p>

<p>But when Berthe came down with a slight case of jaundice and
Lisette paid no attention to the diet ordered by Dr. Simon,
Henriette was forced to take action. Berthe had almost recovered
when a mysterious relapse occurred. The doctor was baffled till the
invalid confessed that she had persuaded the maid to bring her
forbidden delicacies from the pantry. Dr. Simon blamed Henriette
for this, and she in turn called Lisette to account.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I'm not going to see the poor young lady starve," the
maid had stolidly maintained. "I don't care what you and the doctor
say, she shall have what she wants to eat so long as I'm here to
fetch it to her."</p>

<p>"In that case you may not be here to disobey orders," Henriette
told her, taking no notice of the defiant look the maid flung at
her as she left the room.</p>

<p>She seldom troubled the Duc with domestic problems, and she
hesitated to do so just then while he was so deeply absorbed in new
political activities. But knowing that Lisette would take further
advantage, and that Berthe's recovery would be hindered, she
explained the difficulty to him that night.</p>

<p>"She must leave at once," he decided. "It's outrageous. Why,
she'll be dosing the child with laudanum next. You should have
dismissed her this morning."</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, it's not my place to do that. You know the
Duchesse is very fond of Lisette, and I'd prefer you discussed it
with her first."</p>

<p>He agreed to that reluctantly, and though the maid departed next
day, bag and baggage, the effects of her dismissal were
far-reaching. The Duc and Duchesse quarrelled violently as a
result. The Duchesse took to her bed for a week while the Duc
retaliated by keeping to his own apartments and dining out every
night. He did not refer to the subject again, but Henriette guessed
that the issue had turned upon herself and her influence in the
household, rather than upon the servant.</p>

<p>Lisette, however, ran true to her Corsican traditions of
revenge. Just as the Duchesse emerged and Berthe recovered and
peace had been somewhat restored, a new crisis arose. Lisette, it
appeared, had gone directly to the newspaper which had printed the
first article about the Duc's affairs, and given her version of the
story. She spared no detail that would reflect against Mademoiselle
Deluzy. Such unsavoury items as she omitted, the editors of the
scandal sheet were only too ready to supply; and once more the rift
in the Praslin home and the Duc's infatuation for an unscrupulous
and scheming governess became common gossip on the Right and Left
banks, at Court as well as in shops and caf&eacute;s. News happened
to be dull at the moment the story appeared, and for several days
each new edition elaborated on the open scandal of such affairs
among the highest nobility. There were hints that the Duchesse had
lost her reason through humiliation and harsh treatment, that grief
had driven her to enter a convent, that she had been denied the
privilege of seeing her own children, that this was not the first
conquest of the brazen and beautiful Mademoiselle D., even that the
King himself had threatened to interfere if the Duc persisted in
this folly.</p>

<p>It so happened that Henriette learned of this latest attack long
after the paper that carried it had been read and discussed in the
servants' quarters. The blow fell upon Raynald's birthday, when she
had been particularly busy. Lessons were hurried through before
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> so that the afternoon might be free for
celebration. Monsieur Remey had been invited to go with them to a
matin&eacute;e of short plays for children in the Passage Choiseul.
The big barouche had been crowded with full skirts and high spirits
as they set off. The June day was sunny, and the trees everywhere
in full leaf, but with no hint as yet of summer dust and heat to
mar the fresh green. Flowers were blooming everywhere&mdash;in the
parks, on flower stalls, in baskets, window-boxes and on ladies'
bonnets.</p>

<p>"How lucky you are to be born in the month of June!" Henriette
congratulated Raynald, who sat beside her in his new linen jacket
and trousers and red-topped boots. "Even without presents it would
be good fortune."</p>

<p>But Raynald thought presents were very necessary. In fact, on
the drive home he decided to share his birthday with mademoiselle
and buy her a gift with his own money. His pockets were burning
with francs and ten-franc notes, supplied that morning by his
father, his grandfather, and two indulgent S&eacute;bastiani
great-uncles. Nothing would do but that they stop at a small shop
just off the Rue de Rivoli, where they had often watched a jeweller
cutting cameos.</p>

<p>Reynald's heart was set on buying a cameo for mademoiselle,
though she tried to dissuade him from such extravagance. Albert
Remey was invited to help in the selection while Henriette and the
sisters waited in the carriage. The final decision became so
difficult that Henriette had to be called into the shop.</p>

<p>"He's found two small ones the shopkeeper will let him have for
half-price," Albert explained in a whisper. "I doubt if you'll care
for the designs, but you'd better let him have his way. It would
never do to curb his generous impulse."</p>

<p>It was dim in the shop after the sunny street, and the cameos
were very small and finely cut. The elderly jeweller had been
explaining their best points to his small customer.</p>

<p>"Now, mademoiselle, it's for you to choose," Raynald urged her
with a magnificent gesture.</p>

<p>It was plain that the boy had taken a fancy to one that showed a
monk holding a death's head against a brownish background. Raynald
had reached the age at which human skeletons were fascinating, and
there was no denying that the cameo cutter had been very skilful in
his portrayal. No wonder, Henriette thought, that the shopkeeper
will let him buy it for half-price. It's hardly a cheerful
subject.</p>

<p>"You'll never see one like it anywhere," the jeweller was
saying.</p>

<p>Henriette agreed that she doubtless never would, and looking
into Raynald's eyes, so eager and shining with pleased generosity,
she had not the heart to disillusion him.</p>

<p>"What a strange choice!" she murmured to Albert as the cameo was
being wrapped in cotton and fitted into a tiny box. "He's the most
unpredictable child. I hope it hasn't taken all his money!"</p>

<p>Albert Remey did not answer. She saw that he was bent over a
newspaper that lay open on the counter. Something in his expression
startled her. His mouth had fallen open, and he looked suddenly
pale in the dimness of the shop. Her eyes followed his to the
article that held his attention, and in a flash she saw the word
Praslin and her own name. The printed letters grew larger and
larger before her. She felt for the edge of the counter and gripped
it hard. From a long way off she heard the polite tones of the
shopkeeper bidding them good-day.</p>

<p>"And if monsieur would care for the paper, I shall be only too
delighted to let him take it. I've finished reading."</p>

<p>"No, no, thank you, monsieur," she heard Albert's hurried
response, and she felt the distress in his tone and the touch of
his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>He was urging her out of the shop, but before they reached the
door, the dizziness left her. Quickly she turned back to the
counter.</p>

<p>"If you please, I would like to have that paper if you are quite
through with it."</p>

<p>Her hand closed over the sheet. She could see the word Praslin
under her fingers. With calm precaution she folded it so that the
column was hidden. She could not run the risk of the girls' sharp
eyes seeing that name.</p>

<p>Mechanically she heard herself answering questions as they drove
the short distance to the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;.
Albert sat very quiet in the opposite seat. She avoided meeting his
eyes. When they reached the house he made excuse to go back to the
schoolroom for some books. As the children started up the stairs he
kept at Henriette's side and spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It's dastardly, this attack. How could such foul lies
originate? Who can be responsible?"</p>

<p>Henriette clutched the paper more tightly, and as she climbed
the stairs beside him she gave a grim smile. Lisette's hatred and
vindictive threats at parting had just come to her mind.</p>

<p>"I think I know who is behind this latest piece of slander," she
told him. "But that's no help now. Did you read it all,
Albert?"</p>

<p>"Practically, though I was so shocked, coming on it there in the
shop, the words hardly made sense to me. But I'm afraid it's worse
than the others."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I'm afraid so. And even if it were not so
serious, Monsieur le Duc has so lately been made a member of the
House of Peers that it will reflect greater discredit to him. As
for me&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>She gave a shrug that suggested more than any words she could
summon.</p>

<p>"I know; but Henriette, they see you here every day as I do.
They know there can be no truth in these reports that you and the
Duc&mdash;" He broke off in embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Why do you hesitate to say the word?" she asked bitterly. "All
Paris is saying it."</p>

<p>"I know it's a lie, and I'm going with you now to tell the Duc
and Duchesse so."</p>

<p>"No, Albert, no! You mustn't be dragged into this. Nothing you
might say could help, and you would only be hurting yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll not keep silence while these insults to your good name are
bandied about everywhere. I must do something to prove my trust and
friendship."</p>

<p>"You'll have plenty of chances for that," she told him. There
was an unnatural grimness in her voice, though her hand shook as
she reached out impulsively and laid it on his. "Please go quickly,
Albert, and when you return to-morrow act as if you knew
nothing."</p>

<p>He stood by the schoolroom door, holding her hand and searching
her face with distress and perplexity in the eyes behind his
spectacles.</p>

<p>"But, <i>mon Dieu,</i> how can I act such a part when you're in
such trouble? I hardly know what to do."</p>

<p>"Do what I say, please, and remember you're a scholar, absorbed
in your books. You never read newspapers, and you never saw this
particular scandal sheet."</p>

<p>Almost without feeling she washed and slipped into fresh
clothes.</p>

<p>The dress she put on was of pale green challis, strewn with
small bright brown flowers the colour of her hair. It had been
delivered from the dressmakers' only day before yesterday, yet
already that seemed ages ago.</p>

<p><i>"Bien,"</i> she thought as she smoothed her hair before the
mirror and fastened on the enamelled brooch with the dragon's head
which had been the Duchesse's peace offering to her that first
spring in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;. "I look my best
to-night, and for what? But I begin to understand why the condemned
take such pains with their toilettes when they make their last
appearances in public."</p>

<p>Dinner passed off quietly. The young people were so gay and
talkative they did not apparently notice her preoccupation. She had
feared the Duc might take his place, and she felt grateful that it
remained empty. It would have been too difficult to sit opposite
him, knowing what she knew, what he must surely know also by this
time.</p>

<p>"We'll ask Papa to have your cameo set in gold," Raynald was
telling her. "I didn't have money enough for that. And there must
be writing on the back. Mamma has that on her brooches and inside
her rings. What do you want to have there, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know, <i>ch&eacute;ri.</i> I haven't thought."</p>

<p>"They always engrave names and dates," Berthe explained.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have it say, 'Raynald, June 18, 1847,'" the boy
decided, "so you'll always remember to-day."</p>

<p>"Even without that, I couldn't forget the day," she assured him
as they admired the cameo under the lamplight.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the summons she had been expecting came: The
Mar&eacute;chal S&eacute;bastiani's compliments, and would
Mademoiselle Deluzy please present herself immediately at his
apartments? Following the servant along the corridors and down the
stairs, she prepared as best she could for the ordeal. They must
consider the situation very grave indeed, she decided; otherwise
she would have been called to account by the Duchesse, not by her
father. Also the Mar&eacute;chal would have been likely to postpone
the interview till morning if he had not felt that matters were
imperative. Well, at least she preferred father to daughter.</p>

<p>A door opened. She found herself entering the S&eacute;bastiani
drawing-room, where two old men awaited her. There in one chair was
the Mar&eacute;chal's short, soldierly figure and in the other she
recognised the lean and black-clad Abb&eacute; Gallard. The Duc and
Duchesse were conspicuously absent. A chair was indicated, and she
seated herself between them. But as she spread her skirts in
decorous folds she knew that she might have been wearing her shabby
poplin for all the impression her appearance made.</p>

<p>It seemed to her in the tenseness of the slight pause which
followed, that these two men, who represented as it were the
prosperity of earth and the hosts of heaven, were gathering forces
to pass judgment upon her. The Mar&eacute;chal appeared more than
ever like the hard, crude Corsican whose shrewdness and energy
dominated the elegance of his surroundings. But she had less dread
of this plain man of action than of the Abb&eacute;, who sat
motionless, wrapped in his robes and his self-imposed aloofness.
His face was turned slightly, and something about his profile
struck her as familiar. He reminded her of someone else as he sat
silhouetted against the yellow-shaded lamp. It came over her
suddenly that he might have posed for the monk's head on her cameo.
There was a pale austerity to the features; the flesh seemed to
have hardened to the same shell-like consistency. She felt that her
distaste for the design had been almost prophetic. He only needed
the death's head to complete the human replica.</p>

<p>So fascinated had she become, studying the resemblance, that she
had to force her mind from the Abb&eacute;'s profile to the
Mar&eacute;chal's words.</p>

<p>"You know, mademoiselle, why we have sent for you? You have seen
the papers?"</p>

<p>"I've read enough, yes. They're malicious lies as they were
before."</p>

<p>"Lies they may be," he answered, and a long look of meaning
passed between him and the Abb&eacute;; "but this time they have
gone too far. We can no longer sit back and accept such
insults."</p>

<p>"You say 'we,' monsieur, and I am glad of that. I hope it means
that you are considering my position in all this."</p>

<p>"Your position has become intolerable to us all." The dark,
deep-set eyes flashed threateningly. "The Abb&eacute; agrees with
me that there is but one course to take. You must leave this house
at once."</p>

<p>There was complete silence in the room&mdash;the stillness that
comes after a thunderbolt has fallen. Henriette felt her heart
hammer at her side, though her body and brain went numb.</p>

<p>"One moment!" she heard her voice speaking at last. "Let me
remind you, monsieur, that before matters reached such a serious
pass I tried to leave this household of my own free will. But
always I was persuaded to stay. Two years ago in Corsica you
yourself insisted upon my remaining. You said that would be the
surest way to quiet such rumours."</p>

<p>"Evidently I was wrong. These rumours, as you call them, have
grown to alarming proportions."</p>

<p>"But you know as well as I do, monsieur&mdash;and Monsieur
l'Abb&eacute; here also knows&mdash;that to send me away at this
time will put me in a false light."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, there are others who come first in our thoughts."
It was the Abb&eacute; who spoke this time. He leaned slightly
forward in his chair; and his long, colourless hands lay thin and
transparent on his dark robe. "I am here as the spiritual adviser
of a loving, pious and devoted mother&mdash;a woman who has
suffered cruelly because of your presence in her home."</p>

<p>"I've suffered too." Henriette braced herself against the chair.
She knew there was no use in making this last stand, but she was
determined to go down with her back to the wall. "For six years
I've never known what it was to be trusted or treated with respect
and consideration except by Monsieur le Duc and the children. My
devotion to them has been turned into something ugly and false.
I've been spied upon at every turn, and my words and actions
doubted and maligned till I was tried almost past the point of
endurance."</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle," the Abb&eacute; answered with a faintly
sardonic inflection. "I have often marvelled at your endurance. It
will undoubtedly prove valuable to you in your next situation. But
I happen to be more concerned with the Duchesse and her welfare
than with your difficulties. I cannot stand by any longer and see
her made a recluse in her own home, ostracized by those she loves,
who are bound to her by holy ties."</p>

<p>"Holy ties are one thing, and I honour them, but they don't take
the place of love that springs from sympathy and confidence. We
can't command the love of others; we must earn it, monsieur, as we
earn the right to be loved. I'm sorry for the Duchesse. I've
honestly tried to make allowances for her ill-health and
temperament. I'm not passing judgment upon her now. If she is a
recluse in her home, as you say, it's because she has made herself
so. Her own moods have created the prison walls that keep her dear
ones from her."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, we are not here to discuss personalities. You
have many gifts, but evidently humility does not seem to be one of
them."</p>

<p>"Humility doesn't help much when one has one's living to make."
Henriette refused to be brushed aside as if she were some annoying
fly that had lighted on his brow.</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," the Abb&eacute; continued frigidly, "the
Mar&eacute;chal and I are agreed that you cannot remain here."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we must be practical," the other hurried on. "It's
not only my daughter's distress and the humiliation of this latest
attack, but the Duc is now in public life; and such things reflect
on the Court and on the King himself. A repetition of such scandal
might have very serious effects, and we must think of the
future."</p>

<p>"I must think of the future too. Whether it affects the Court of
France or not, it happens to matter to me."</p>

<p>"Certainly, mademoiselle." Her irony was lost on the
Mar&eacute;chal, but not, she hoped, on the Abb&eacute;. "That's
what I say&mdash;we must be practical, and of course I will see
that you do not suffer financially."</p>

<p>"But what about my prospects, monsieur? I needn't tell you that
a dismissal now will make it almost impossible for me to secure
another teaching post in France."</p>

<p>"Exactly. That's why it will be better for you to go to England,
where I understand you have influential friends. Surely they will
be able to find you more congenial employment than if you remained
in Paris. We have decided that will be the best plan, and I am
prepared to help you financially if you agree."</p>

<p>"So I'm to be shipped out of the country, like other
undesirables. No, thank you, monsieur. You have a right to ask me
to leave your house, but not to leave France."</p>

<p>"Wait," the Mar&eacute;chal interposed, his face flushing purple
at her words. "You must hear me out. In view of your services to my
grandchildren I intend to provide you with a comfortable
settlement."</p>

<p>"Please don't misunderstand me," Henriette broke in. "I was not
the one to bring up this matter of money."</p>

<p>"It's not to be overlooked, mademoiselle. By leaving now I
understand you will forfeit a pension the Duc promised if you would
stay till the older girls married."</p>

<p>"I did not stay because of that. All I ask now is a fair chance
to continue my work without prejudice."</p>

<p>"That's why you will do well to go to England, and with an
assured annuity from me you should be able to manage comfortably
for yourself. Shall we say twelve hundred francs a year?"</p>

<p>"I'm not talking about francs or about England, monsieur. I
shall stay in France&mdash;in Paris, probably; and I ask for no
bribes. I only want the assurance that what has happened while I
worked in this house will not injure what means most to a
governess&mdash;her good character."</p>

<p>"You should have thought of your character before to-night," the
Abb&eacute; interposed. "I'm afraid we cannot give that back to you
unspoiled. It seems to me the Mar&eacute;chal is being more than
charitable in his offer."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking for charity of the Mar&eacute;chal or any one
here. But I do ask the privilege of earning my living where and how
I choose. If I could have been allowed to stay the summer out, or
until this unfortunate matter died down, it would have been easier;
however, that's not for me to say. But a letter from the Duchesse
recommending me is very important. I think I deserve that after
these six years of service."</p>

<p>"You make it difficult." The Mar&eacute;chal's thick fingers
drummed on the arm of his chair. "Very difficult. I still advise
your going to England. You will not consider that?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, I prefer France. I've never believed in running
away from trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, then, there's nothing more to be said."</p>

<p>"And you will speak to the Duchesse about the letter. Tell her I
will be out of the house to-morrow, but I will leave word where it
can be sent."</p>

<p>It was horrible to sit there bargaining together as if they were
two peasants haggling in some market-place. Yet she knew she was
fighting for her rights, that her whole future was at stake.</p>

<p>"I will speak to my daughter," he agreed hesitantly, "but I
can't answer for her. She's been tried too far."</p>

<p>"The Duchesse is noted for her goodness of heart," Henriette
pointed out as she rose. "I'm sure she won't begrudge me a few
words of honourable discharge. She might even be generous enough to
let it appear that I left for reasons of my own."</p>

<p>"You go too far, mademoiselle," the Abb&eacute; once more
answered for his friend. "It's not your place to dictate terms with
those who have suffered so long from your arrogance and conceit. It
seems to me that you protest your innocence too vigorously."</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute;'s cool denunciation stung her as all the furies
of the Duchesse had never been able to do. She flung back her head
and faced him directly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that, monsieur. I couldn't speak too vigorously
against these lies."</p>

<p>"You talk glibly of lies, but let me remind you that there are
others than those uttered by word of mouth or set on paper, For
these unspoken ones we are also held to account as you will be for
the suffering you have caused another&mdash;a good woman whose
prayers you have turned into a mockery."</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; sighed deeply and raised his eyes&mdash;almost,
Henriette thought, as if he were enlisting allies from above to his
side. She knew she was helpless before the power of this man, yet
she was determined to have the last word.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she said, "you may not know that I, too, am
accountable to a father confessor. It happens to be my own
conscience, and a clear conscience may also give absolution."</p>

<p>She did not remember bidding the two good-night or leaving the
S&eacute;bastiani apartments. She had no idea if the interview had
lasted an hour or a few minutes. She knew only that for her this
was the end of an era, and it seemed strange to find the older
girls still busy under the lamplight with their books and
embroidery and games about them.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, mademoiselle!" Louise sprang up as she
entered. "Papa was here a few moments ago, but he couldn't stay. He
wrote a note and told me not to forget to give it to you. What's
the matter, mademoiselle? You look pale, and your hands are so
cold."</p>

<p>"Well, I might as well tell you, my dears." She sank down in the
midst of the little group. "I've had bad news to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle, I'm sorry! You're not ill?"</p>

<p>"No." She tried to smile a reassurance she did not feel as she
hastily sought for some logical explanation. "I'm as well as usual;
but my grandfather is ill, and I must go to him."</p>

<p>"Well," she argued to herself, remembering the Abb&eacute;'s
recent words on the subject of lies, "it's the truth in one way. He
is ill, and it's not my place to go into facts. By to-morrow it
won't be my place to tell them anything."</p>

<p>"But you'll come back soon?"</p>

<p>She faltered under the searching gaze of those clear young eyes.
"I can't say when&mdash;it may be a long time."</p>

<p>"Why, mademoiselle! It's queer I never knew you had a
grandfather. You never spoke of him to us before."</p>

<p>"Why should I, my dear? It didn't concern you."</p>

<p>"Oh, but mademoiselle, everything that concerns you concerns
us."</p>

<p>Their sympathy and affection unnerved her more than the shock of
the newspaper, more than the interview that had just ended. She had
difficulty in restraining their generous offers of help in packing.
They wanted to go to her rooms and stay with her till long past
their bedtime. They showered her with embarrassing questions about
her grandfather, his illness, and the probable length of her stay.
She answered them as best she could. But all the time the slim,
girlish bodies in full pink and blue and sprigged muslin pressed
about her, all the time the quick, young voices buzzed in her ears,
she was telling herself that this was the end. They would never be
together like this again, gathered round the lamp-lit table where
they had refought campaigns of long dead armies and waged more
personal wars against columns of figures and the vagaries of
irregular verbs. "Going&mdash;gone; going&mdash;gone," the familiar
brown clock ticked like an auctioneer's hammer to Henriette.</p>

<p>She went through the ritual of good-night, set the schoolroom to
rights, and reached her own quarters at last. It was only then,
with the door locked against possible interruption, that she dared
to read the letter Louise had delivered. Except for two or three
brief notes giving her impersonal directions about her duties, the
Duc had never written her. This was without address, and she saw
that the pencilled words had been hastily scribbled on a sheet of
ruled paper from one of the girls' copy-books:</p>

<blockquote>I feel much, and there is nothing to say; nothing that
I can do. My hands are tied, and I am powerless to help you, my
dear friend, as your support has so often helped me. Misfortune has
marked me for her own, and whatever move I make I seem to bring
disaster upon others, especially upon you, whom I most wish to
spare. It is as you so truly said&mdash;we can only share
happiness, not grief; and yet I know that I am responsible for the
ordeal you must meet alone. But remember, I, too, am alone. Small
comfort indeed, but perhaps you can make something of it. You are
braver than I. I do not fear for you as I do for myself.<br>
<br>
Keep the older girls informed of your whereabouts, and be sure that
we will visit you. Good-night, and forgive this poor
note.</blockquote>

<p>There was no signature, and her own name had not been written.
Even on this last night of her stay there, she guessed that he had
not dared so great a risk. The words showed signs of haste and
agitation. Some were black and heavy, some light; and the pencil
point had broken in one place under the pressure of those strong
fingers.</p>

<p>She hesitated by the little secretary, wondering if she should
write a discreet answer to his letter. But she decided against
that. Even the most politely formal note might be misinterpreted;
and, besides, he evidently wished to forestall that impulse, so
expressly did he ask her to tell the children where she meant to
go. Poor soul, he was afraid of further consequences. She smiled
wanly at that. He had deserted her. But she could not reproach him.
He could do nothing by taking a stand. He was not brave, as he
himself had admitted. He had been like an overgrown boy who had
reached out to her because he was afraid of the dark. She had given
him her hand, and they had taken comfort in each other's nearness.
That was all that had ever been between them. And now that, too,
was gone. The time had come for her to go away.</p>

<p>After a little she moved to the window and opened it. Below her
the garden lay dark and warm with June fragrance, and from the
distance the familiar sounds of Paris came to her&mdash;the
dwindled hoofbeats and the clatter of carriages on the Champs
Elys&eacute;es, the pulse of the city she was determined not to
leave.</p>

<p>She turned back to her room, fetched her night clothes from the
closet, and with a quick impulsive gesture blew out the lamp. She
undressed in the dark because she did not wish to look about those
rooms where she had experienced such varying emotions for six
years. She would not sentimentalise about each object that had been
part of her life there&mdash;the little gilt clock under the glass
dome, the secretary, the work-table, the vases of fresh-cut
flowers, and the mirror that had reflected her face in moments of
delight and perplexity and fear. No, she would not brood upon what
was over for good and all.</p>

<p>"It's misery enough," she thought as she pressed her face
against the cool pillow, "to have once been happy here."</p>

<h3>Chapter Nineteen</h3>

<p>Back to the Rue du Harlay; to the sloping eaves and cramped
quarters of the Needle's Eye. It seemed narrower and shabbier after
the luxurious apartment in the Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, where
Henriette had grown used to down pillows and fine linen and
upholstered furniture. She had not realised how insidiously such
comforts could become necessities. She had steeled herself to meet
the loneliness and depression and sense of defeat which she knew
would inevitably follow her departure; but she had not guessed the
physical repugnance she would experience in the noise and heat and
squalor of that dilapidated establishment in the Marais. The fact
that she was lucky to have even this refuge did not lessen her
gloom, though Madame Le Maire reminded her of it at every turn.</p>

<p>"So," the old woman had greeted her a month before, "here you
are, bag and baggage, just as I've been expecting you to turn up on
my doorstep some day. You held out longer than I thought you would,
but it was bound to end like this. I told you so."</p>

<p>"You did, Madame Le Maire." Henriette had smiled wearily. "I'll
always give you credit for that."</p>

<p>"And now you're asking for another kind of credit, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Not yet. I've been able to put by a little money. I can pay my
way, but of course summer is a bad time to find another place. It
may be a long wait, and meantime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And meantime you must live, and there aren't so many pensions
in Paris that will care to open their doors to the notorious
Mademoiselle D., now she's left the H&ocirc;tel Praslin! No, you
needn't go into explanations. What I didn't read in those papers I
got out of Albert Remey."</p>

<p>Henriette had given her unspoken gratitude to Albert when she
heard that he had already been there to intercede for her. He and
Marie had begged her to come to them, but she had refused. She
would not bring her misfortune into their household, though she had
been touched by their offer and their loyal support. As briefly as
possible she had told Madame Le Maire of her difficulties. It had
been strange to hear herself humbly asking for the privilege of
room and board and a chance to teach or chaperon any of the
boarders. But she had laid her case calmly before the old woman
without asking for sympathy. She would pay her way, and she would
work at anything for the present. She asked nothing more than
that.</p>

<p>"Well, Mademoiselle Desportes"&mdash;Madame had pronounced her
old name with peculiar emphasis&mdash;"any one else in my place
would refuse you. It's not only the scandal which always leaks out
sooner or later, but it is you yourself. Things happen to you, and
they always will."</p>

<p>"Can't I help that?" Henriette had asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't say you could, and in a way it's what I've always
liked about you. When I was young they used to say people only
threw stones at the tree that was loaded with fruit."</p>

<p>This grudgingly admitted compliment had been Madame's only
assurance that Henriette might remain even in the dubious security
of that least desirable room. She had made no promises about
keeping her, and as the weeks passed and the letter of
recommendation from the Duchesse did not materialise, the old woman
became more insistent. Although there had been no written agreement
about this, Henriette had been assured verbally before leaving that
it would be given her. She had written the Duchesse reminding her
of this and giving the Rue du Harlay address, and she had also
mentioned it to the Duc at each of their two meetings.</p>

<p>These had been brief and difficult, and the presence of the
tearful children, who clung to her and refused to believe she would
not return with them to Melun, had not made conversation easy.
Berthe and Raynald would not be reconciled to her absence, and
these reunions only left her more exhausted and despairing. She
wrote several letters to Louise; letters which echoed her misery,
and which she hoped might be shown to the Duc. Not that she counted
on his help, but it eased her a little to put her loneliness on
paper; to ask for news and reassurance of their affection during
those intervals between the unsatisfactory visits. Once she found
her emotions carrying her too far, and she left a sentence
unfinished that she had begun in a transport of unhappiness. Still
she must think of her pupils before herself. Louise was to be
married in early autumn, and she must not be burdened with an
ex-governess's plight.</p>

<p>On a stifling night in late July Henriette lay sleepless on her
hard bed. Up there under the roof that narrow box of a room
gathered heat by day and stayed like an oven till morning. If any
breeze stirred in the Rue du Harlay it could hardly have found the
gabled window of the Needle's Eye or helped to clear the air of
stale smells of past cooking and the faint stench of sewer gas.
Henriette pressed a damp handkerchief to her nostrils and tried not
to listen as the hours and half-hours struck through the
close-pressing darkness. Her eyelids felt hot and swollen, her lips
were salty from hours of crying. But she had no more tears to shed,
though her breath still came convulsively. She tried to keep it
quiet, for two of the maids slept next door, and they had
complained that her restlessness and weeping kept them awake.
Madame Le Maire was already displeased with her. The old landlady's
patience was wearing thinner each day that passed without the
arrival of the Duchesse's letter, and that very night at dinner
Henriette had further annoyed her by having to leave the table
because she had been overcome by a wave of faintness.</p>

<p>The afternoon had not helped her fortitude. It was her second
reunion with her former pupils and their father, and each meeting
had upset her. That day she had taken Marie, Berthe, and Raynald to
the dentist because her presence and encouragement had always
helped them through such ordeals. It had been like old times, and
she had forgotten her own troubles for those few hours. After the
visit to the dentist they had gone to the Luxembourg Gardens. The
Duc had joined them, and they had eaten frapp&eacute;s and listened
to a band concert under the trees. But it had been an
unsatisfactory meeting. He had seemed grim and strained, and spoke
little. She guessed that he dared not trust himself to reopen the
painful subject of her departure. The King was away from Paris, and
the House of Peers did not claim his attention. This was a pity,
she had thought, since it gave him too much time to brood on the
hopeless tangle of his own domestic affairs.</p>

<p>He had been solicitous for her, commenting upon her paleness and
lassitude. He had urged her to take a brief holiday from the city,
or at least to let Dr. Simon prescribe for her health. But she had
tried to make light of this. It was the heat, she had explained;
once the weather grew cooler, she would be able to sleep
again&mdash;better yet if she could only find some work to absorb
her. It was then that she had reminded him of the promised letter
from the Duchesse. There had been no sign of it, and Madame Le
Maire was becoming more pressing in her demands. There were several
young ladies in the pension who wished instruction in English and
painting. She had started a small class, but she could not continue
without good references from her last position, since the young
ladies had been entrusted to Madame's care. She had waited a month
now, and she had even written reminding the Duchesse; but no word
had come.</p>

<p>He had flushed darkly, his brows drawn into deep lines. It was
outrageous that the Duchesse had not kept to the agreement. He
would take the matter up with her at once.</p>

<p>"I would not be so insistent, monsieur," she had said, "but I
think I have a right to ask that much of her. It's so little for
her to do, and it means my whole future to me."</p>

<p>"You shall have your letter," he had promised as they walked
together from the Gardens. "Make sure that I shall see to that if
it's my last act on earth."</p>

<p>The children had begged her to drive with them to the depot of
the Corbeil railway, and she had consented against her will. There
bad been the inevitable tears when the parting took place at the
train gates. She had not been able to keep back her own tears as
Berthe and Raynald clung to her.</p>

<p>"Try to be happy if you can," the Duc had said in parting. "It
only makes it harder for me to know you are miserable too."</p>

<p>"I'll try," she had promised. "Night after night as I lie awake
I say to myself, 'Why should you expect to be singled out for
happiness from a world of people?' And yet, somehow, I go right on
believing that it is my right."</p>

<p>He had pressed her hand, and then she had turned away from the
little group going down the long platform. The tears in her eyes
made everything indistinct. On her way out she had collided with a
man hurrying towards the train.</p>

<p>"Pardon," she had murmured.</p>

<p>Looking up, she had seen that he was the Duc's valet, Auguste
Charpentier. He had recognised her, she knew, and she wished that
he had not seen her crying.</p>

<p>Well, the afternoon was over. The precious minutes had only been
wasted with useless tears and regrets. She would not waste any
more. A nearby clock was striking three. She must try to catch a
little sleep. She would have need of that to face another day. But
the bed was so hard, the room so hot. She turned and twisted
endlessly. This was the hour before daylight, when she was trapped
by her own thoughts, when hope retreated, and her own vitality
ebbed away in the darkness. The little clock that the children had
chosen for her one Christmas ticked tirelessly on a shelf she could
not see. Time smocked her so, night after night. She was afraid to
think of the past or of the future. Both were painful to her now.
There was only the present, and what was that, that she should
cling to it?</p>

<p>After a while she slipped from bed to crouch by the window as
she had done through other wakeful hours. But no freshness rewarded
her as she leaned at the casement, peering into the hollow pit of
the street below where the opposite houses stood dark and lifeless,
and only a lamp glimmered feebly at the corner. Sometimes a
stealthy grey rat sped across that circle of light; sometimes a
slow, stooped human figure passed and was gone. Even at this
distance such shapes filled her with shudders of pity and disgust.
The rats of Paris going upon their secret missions were less
repellent than these other night scavengers. Where did they hide
themselves by day? How had their shame begun, and where, she
wondered, would it end? Where would she herself end, for the matter
of that?</p>

<p>Everything came back to that. Every sight and every sound
stabbed her with the sharpness of personal futility. She leaned her
arms on the window ledge and buried her face upon them to shut out
the vision of interminably stretching years. What could they bring
but a shifting from post to post? Board and rooms in exchange for
the best years of her life; her capacity for love spent on other
people's children, and if they loved her in return, only bitterness
and hard feelings for reward. She would grow withered and querulous
like other ageing mesdemoiselles, and in time give herself up to
fancywork and tedious reminiscences. She would share with her kind
such crumbs of gentility as they could muster. Dullness would be
her heritage. All her struggles against it had only brought the
spectre nearer. She could feel it at her heels. There in the foetid
room it seemed actually to have overtaken her.</p>

<p>"Henriette Deluzy. Henriette Desportes, spinster." She repeated
the words with ruthless emphasis on the last one.</p>

<p>Thirty-five years old, and alone. So she might live to be an old
woman. Spinsters often did. They had so little to spend themselves
upon.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu,</i> never let it be so for me!"</p>

<p>She writhed at the thought, and sweat broke out on her brow and
under the folds of her nightgown, though she continued to pant for
breath in the closeness of the room.</p>

<p>He had said she had courage. Perhaps she had, but not enough to
face that. When life held nothing, nothing that one wanted, where
was the harm in letting it go? Not to worry, not to scheme and
scrimp, not to compromise with one's self while the eagerness of
youth died a slow death in unwanted flesh&mdash;that was all that
mattered now. God would not be too hard on her. He had created a
world of beauty and had given her eyes and capacity to respond to
its wonders. He could not have meant it to turn out this way for
her. If He really did know the secrets of all hearts there would be
no need to explain things to Him.</p>

<p>The bottle of laudanum was in the top drawer of the chest. She
knew just where she had hidden it in her handkerchief-case. It was
a small, squat bottle, but nearly full. Dr. Simon had entrusted it
to her care during one of Berthe's illnesses, and he had explained
how fatal an overdose might be. Her mind had stored away his words,
and now they and the bottle were ready to answer her need. The
drawer stuck obstinately under her hands. It seemed to be thwarting
her in an almost human manner as she struggled to open it without
disturbing those in the next room. She heard the rustle of a
mattress as one of the sleepers stirred. Her hands found the
bottle, and she stood there holding it close while she made sure
that the steady breathing continued from the other side of the
wall. Queer to think that so soon those few inches of plaster would
divide the living from the dead.</p>

<p>Noiselessly she moved to the washstand under the eaves and felt
for the tumbler and pitcher of water...</p>

<p>Someone groaned. She was aware of the long, shuddering sound of
distress before she realised that she herself had made it. She
strained to raise her eyelids, but a blinding light and a blur of
faces that looked larger than full moons turned her dizzy again. A
wave of nausea overcame the blackness, and sharp odours and still
sharper pangs made her conscious once more.</p>

<p>"There now!" she heard Madame Le Maire's familiar voice faintly
through a haze of pain. "She's through the worst of it. We need not
send Pierre for a doctor. Get downstairs as fast as you can."</p>

<p>Another spasm shook Henriette, and when it passed and she was
able to fix her attention on nearer objects she saw that she was
still in the Needle's Eye, blinking painfully at the strange
brightness of the room. Morning was at the window, its light
mingling with that of a lamp on the stand beside her bed.</p>

<p>"Madame," she whispered, "how did you know? Why did you have to
come?"</p>

<p>"Why?" The answer came short with annoyance as the old woman
rubbed her vigorously with wet towels or pressed smelling-salts to
her nostrils. "Haven't you given me enough trouble without adding
suicide? You might have thought of what a police report would mean
to my business. But Jeannette has sharp ears, praise heaven! She
heard you fall and the glass shatter, and we lost no time. Here,
lift your arms, and let me get you into a clean nightdress."</p>

<p>In spite of the brusque words and manner Henriette knew that
Madame was being very kind as she made her clean and comfortable
and later forced her to drink black coffee with a dash of brandy.
She lay limp and exhausted, scarcely aware of those who came and
went, though she knew that Madame and the maids and even old
Pierre, the porter, took turns sitting by her bed, urging her to
eat the food they brought and fanning her to keep away the flies.
Sometimes she slept, and woke drenched with sweat, beating off the
black wings of ugly dreams. Towards evening her head cleared, and
the air freshened as a summer shower cooled the streets. She lay
back weakly and turned to Madame Le Maire with a faint, apologetic
smile.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Madame, for making you so much trouble," she
faltered. "I know now that I have been very weak and foolish."</p>

<p>"It's something to admit one's folly. Well, you're alive whether
you want to be or not."</p>

<p>"It's no use trying to explain, but I was desperate."</p>

<p>"So I gather. I mistrusted it from the way you looked at dinner
last night. You were seeing them most of yesterday. I suppose that
accounts for it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Madame. But nothing happened. They are not to blame.
Only it came over me as it has before, that there was no use in my
going on."</p>

<p>"So you tried laudanum. Well, you're not the first. But it's not
so easy as all that, Henriette Desportes. Life doesn't mean to be
cheated of you."</p>

<p>Tears of weakness gathered in Henriette's eyes. She found it
difficult to speak, but after a time she mastered her sobs and went
on.</p>

<p>"It was wrong, I know, but there are times when&mdash;when
to-morrow, even one more hour, seems too much. I couldn't sleep.
You know how it is after you've counted every stroke of the clock
and your troubles grow like a mountain and you can see nothing
else."</p>

<p>"Most certainly I know." Madame wagged her head so vigorously
that her fringe of black hair shifted slightly over one eye. "Who
doesn't?"</p>

<p>Again they were silent for a time, and only the sounds of
vendors calling their wares from the wet street below sounded in
the room.</p>

<p>"And I felt so alone, you see," Henriette ventured at last. "If
there had been someone to turn to, someone for me to lean on."</p>

<p>"Listen to me." The sharp old eyes blinked fiercely out of their
nests of wrinkles. "You'll never find that, so stop wasting your
time looking for shoulders to lean on."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but other people have that comfort. Why shouldn't
I?"</p>

<p>"Because your shoulders were made for them to lean on. You were
born a prop and not a vine. You can't go against your pattern as
you tried to last night. Believe me, mademoiselle, I know what I'm
saying. An oak may not turn into a strawberry plant for the
wishing."</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty</h3>

<p>It was mid-August, and in the Rue du Harlay Madame Le Maire's
dinner had been over nearly an hour. At least the tables had been
cleared; the halls and parlours and draperies were still
reminiscent of cabbage and onion, fried fish and coffee. Henriette,
seated near a lamp with piles of sewing about her, paused at
intervals to wipe the moisture from the needle she forced through
the coarse cotton sheets she was hemming. She pressed her
handkerchief to her nose, and the sharp fragrance of cologne
revived her enough to go on for another brief period of work. She
sat in Madame's small parlour, separated by folding doors from the
drawing-room where a group of students were trying to while away
another dull summer evening. Most of the students were females, and
a more nondescript and unattractive lot Henriette thought she had
never seen. The three male residents of the pension had gone out
immediately upon finishing dinner, and a dispiriting lull had
settled down upon the rest. They read or wrote letters, embroidered
or gossiped, while several more musically inclined took turns at
the square piano. But this music failed to enliven the scene. No
players were gifted or even very accurate, and the piano needed
tuning. Henriette tried to shut the sound from her consciousness;
but it was impossible not to wince when false notes were struck, or
when some key refused to budge.</p>

<p>Usually she sat with the students, chaperoning or assisting them
at their various occupations. But to-night she had been spared
that. It was a luxury to be allowed to sew by herself while she
waited for the announcement of special visitors. Flies buzzed
incessantly about the oil-lamp. It was very hot in the small
parlour, but she was growing used to that, now the summer had
dragged two-thirds through. She had become accustomed to many
things that in June had seemed unendurable.</p>

<p>"Well?" Madame Le Maire surveyed her from the doorway. "No sign
of your visitors yet? You're sure you made no mistake?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame." Henriette looked up from the long hem under her
hands. "Louise wrote plainly the 17th of August."</p>

<p>"I've told Pierre to not keep them waiting. They're to be shown
up here immediately. I must speak to the girls next door, but I'll
be back directly. It will be less awkward if I'm sitting here with
you when they arrive."</p>

<p>The brisk old figure rustled away, and presently her orders were
being issued in the next room. Henriette's ears were strained for
the rattle of a carriage stopping outside, for the peal of a bell
and the sound of familiar voices on the stairs. She had faced much
in the last three weeks since she had seen them. The episode of the
laudanum bottle had left its mark upon her spirit, though it had
not injured her physically, thanks to the maid's and Madame's
prompt action. But the starch had gone out of Henriette,
temporarily at least. She was even ready to compromise now if need
be. There would be no other way if Madame failed to-night in her
demand of the letter.</p>

<p>All day she had waited, restless and yet in a state of suspended
activity, knowing that her fate would be decided before another day
passed. Almost, it seemed to her as she pushed the needle in and
out with precise, even stitches, that her future had gone out of
her keeping. Madame had laid down her ultimatum, not unkindly, but
with a firmness that Henriette knew would never be shaken. The
letter must be guaranteed. She would speak to the Duc herself since
Henriette's efforts had not been successful. There had been nothing
to do but agree to this arrangement, much as she disliked the old
woman's meddling.</p>

<p>"Forget those fine stitches you learned in the convent," Madame
was saying presently. "These sheets will never be worth the pains
you're putting on them. What's the time? Nearly nine. Well, I must
say they might have paid you the compliment of coming before
this."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later they heard the sounds of arrival.
Before the sewing could be laid aside the children had run up the
stairs with eager cries for "Mademoiselle Deluzy." Berthe and
Raynald were first with flowers in their hands; Louise and Marie
came next; last of all came the Duc, bearing a basket of fruit and
one of the famous ch&acirc;teau melons. Henriette stood in their
midst again, struggling to keep herself in hand when so much
depended upon her to-night. She took as long as possible with the
young people's greetings before she turned to their father.</p>

<p>When the introductions to Madame Le Maire were over, they fitted
themselves into the parlour as best they could, the chairs occupied
by the adults, the children squeezed close together on a horsehair
sofa. The room seemed suddenly too small to hold all this influx of
life and good looks and expensive clothes. It was like a pot on a
hot stove ready to boil over in another moment. Henriette felt her
head begin to swim as she tried to answer the eager, bubbling
questions of the young Praslins; to listen to the conversation of
Madame and the Duc on her other side, and to keep her eyes from
turning in his direction.</p>

<p>"Oh, these roses and heliotrope!" She buried her face in the
fragrant bouquets. "Berthe, you remembered how I love mignonette,
and this is the first bit I've seen all summer. And ferns from the
woods!"</p>

<p>"And the fruit, mademoiselle; we wanted you to have the first
peaches, and the grapes grew in the new conservatory. The
strawberries are all gone, and the blackberries were too green to
pick. But this melon will ripen if you keep it in the sun. It was
the biggest on any of the vines."</p>

<p>Over their quick mingled voices she strained to catch what the
other two were saying. Had they reached the point yet? Was Madame
leading tactfully to the matter of the letter?</p>

<p>"You are pale, mademoiselle," Louise was saying, "and your eyes
look&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you've just forgotten how I look," Henriette broke in
hastily. They must not ask if she had been crying.</p>

<p>"I've done a study of flowers, mademoiselle: yellow and white
lilies and purple iris in a green jar. The flowers were easy, but
the jar was hard to do&mdash;to make both sides look the same."</p>

<p>"I can't wait to see it, Berthe. Be sure you make a great many
more sketches at the seashore&mdash;shells and seaweed and ships.
The other day I was looking at the ones I did in my old sketchbook
at Olmeto, and they made me quite homesick."</p>

<p>Chit chat, chit chat. Flowers and shells and such, when her
heart felt as if it were tied fast in a double knot, when her
throat was aching and her lips felt dry, holding back all the words
of love and homesickness and longing that she must never say.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank you, mademoiselle, the others are all well. At
least all except Mamma. She's been poorly since we went to the
ch&acirc;teau. Dr. Simon and Dr. Louis came from Paris to see her.
It was their idea to go to Dieppe. But we have a much larger villa
than the old one. You remember the other where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember," Henriette once more interposed hastily.
"And you're off in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Not till the day after. The others went straight to the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, except mamma and the boys. They were
going to the booksellers on the Rue du Coq first. Mamma wants to
take some new novels with her."</p>

<p>"I see. And you have good news from Isabella? She wrote me a
sweet letter a fortnight ago. Louise, you look blooming. Has your
wedding day been finally settled upon?"</p>

<p>From behind the folding doors the murmurs of the boarders
sounded with occasional shrill giggles. The piano began again. They
could scarcely talk above it. Madame rose, excused herself, and
went in to put a stop to that.</p>

<p>"This is a funny little parlour you have, mademoiselle, and
where do you sleep?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Raynald, don't ask such questions."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, monsieur. It's no secret. This parlour belongs
to Madame. She only invites me to share it if I have company, and
when I sleep, which I haven't been doing so very well lately, my
room is high among the chimneypots. The melon will ripen nicely
there, almost as soon as if it were in your greenhouse."</p>

<p>She broke off quickly, seeing the surprised pity in the
children's eyes and realising she had admitted too much. She had
meant the Duc to hear, and he had. She saw him shift uneasily in
his chair.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Deluzy"&mdash;he spoke hurriedly and glanced
towards the hall to make sure their hostess had not
returned&mdash;"I am greatly worried about you. Your health has
suffered. I should have guessed that even if Madame had not told me
you have been ill." He looked at her intently, and she knew he must
be referring to the laudanum. "You must see Dr. Simon at once, and
you must accept my offer to send you on a little holiday. Please
let me help you."</p>

<p>There was a note of appeal in his voice, yet once more she could
not continue to look into his eyes. What she saw there frightened
her. His face had fallen into heavy, listless lines, but his eyes
showed his own inner tension.</p>

<p>"Well, monsieur," she sighed and made a little futile gesture
with her hands, "there's only one thing that can help me. I suppose
Madame Le Maire has already told you."</p>

<p>He had only time to nod before the old woman was in their midst
again. Once more Henriette turned to the group on the sofa, and
there were further inquiries and answers.</p>

<p>"How is your sick grandfather, mademoiselle? Will he soon be
better so you can come back?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, <i>ch&eacute;rie.</i> You mustn't count on my
coming back."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we do! We don't want any other governess. Monsieur
Remey can teach us till you come back&mdash;all except painting.
He's not very good at that."</p>

<p>Berthe's sudden laughter filled the room with clear, untroubled
gaiety.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock. A distant clock struck, and the Duc rose to make
his farewells. How his height and strength filled the room! The
bric-a-brac and furniture seemed nothing but a clutter of flimsy
feminine trash by contrast, sticks and straw and bits of china that
he could demolish by a single sweep of his hands.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Madame, and I think you for the honour you have
done me. Come, Louise, Marie, Berthe, Raynald. It's late, and we
must make our adieus."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Monsieur le Duc," Madame Le Maire peered up at him,
looking in her rusty black rather like an aged and scrawny crow.
"It was most considerate of you to come to-night, and I hope I've
made my situation clear."</p>

<p>"Perfectly clear, Madame, though as I said, in case of a slight
delay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's been two months' delay already. It's not that I'm being
insistent. You understand how it is when I'm responsible to others
and with the circumstances what they are."</p>

<p>"I understand, Madame, and all I can say is, I will do my best.
Good-night."</p>

<p>Henriette followed the five to the head of the stairs. She
kissed the soft faces turned up to hers and then stood with her
hands on the stair rail, searching his face under the flickering
hall light.</p>

<p>"Don't take what she says too much to heart, monsieur," she told
him. "I know better than any one else the position you are being
placed in because of me, because of this letter."</p>

<p>"I've tried already." His voice was low beside her. "I've done
everything in my power, but I play a sorry part in all this."</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse has found a way to punish me. She can force
me to leave here, and she'll probably end by getting her way."</p>

<p>"She has put you out of the house. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"Apparently not, monsieur. But, please, be careful what you say.
I shall manage somehow."</p>

<p>She turned to go back to the room they had just left, but he
caught her hand.</p>

<p>"I will make one more effort," he promised. "Perhaps if I go to
her now&mdash;to-night, she will listen to reason."</p>

<p>"Don't count on it, monsieur." She could not keep her voice
altogether steady as she went on: "Don't go too far for my
sake."</p>

<p>"Papa&mdash;Papa," the children were calling from below. "Aren't
you coming? It's very dark down here, and we can't find the
doorknob."</p>

<p>"In a moment," he answered. Then he turned to her once more.
"Come to the Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; to-morrow about two
o'clock. I can make no promises, but perhaps by then&mdash;well, we
shall see. Good-night till to-morrow."</p>

<p>His boots clattered down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Good-night, mademoiselle," the young voices called up to
her.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she called back. "Till to-morrow then, at
two."</p>

<p>Madame Le Maire looked up as she returned to the parlour.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked with that rising inflection whose meaning
Henriette knew.</p>

<p>"I'm to go to the Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; at two o'clock
to-morrow. That's all I know. But I'm not counting too much on
that."</p>

<p>She reached for the half-finished sewing and took up the needle
and thread.</p>

<p>"He's a very fine figure of a man," the old woman remarked after
they had stitched in silence for some time. "I don't wonder the
Duchesse wanted to catch him early. He must have been very handsome
when he was young."</p>

<p>"He's not so old." Henriette tried to speak casually as she
threaded her needle. "Forty-two. That's young to be a grandfather,
but he will be soon."</p>

<p>"Grandfather or not, he'd better watch where he's heading."
Madame bit off the thread emphatically before she went on. "They're
pretty children, and their manners do you credit, I don't envy the
mademoiselle who comes next after the fuss they made over you."</p>

<p>Henriette refused to be drawn into further conversation about
the visit. When the sewing was done, she divided her fruit and
flowers with Madame and climbed the stairs to her room. She felt
spent from the evening and yet strangely calm and settled in her
mind as she put the drooping flowers into water and set the basket
of fruit with the melon on her window-sill. The early sun would
ripen it in a day or two, and she would share the delicacy with
Albert and Marie. They had been begging her to make them a little
visit, and she guessed that the time was not far off when she would
be glad to accept their invitation.</p>

<p>The Duc would never be able to secure that letter. It had been
foolish to cling to the hope of it so long. The Duchesse was taking
the revenge she had waited for all these years. It was consistent
with her Corsican heritage that she should do so, though she would
never have been clever enough to plan so subtly cruel a way. Out of
the hopeless tangle of their lives this power had been put into the
Duchesse's plump, ineffectual hands. Merely by a few pen strokes
she could give Henriette back her independence and good name. By
refusing them she could make her into an exile, and her future a
downhill road. Well, there must be some way out. There came a time
when one could no longer struggle against difficulties not of one's
own making. She had plunged hopefully into a maelstrom of human
emotions. It was not strange that she had been caught between the
fierce crosscurrents of these two lives till she was blind and
dizzy, battered by her efforts to keep her own head above water.
For six years she had been part of this dark and dangerous
whirlpool, but now she was on land again; she would turn her back
on all that. The ground still felt uncertain under her feet, but it
would grow firmer in time if she could keep her footing for a
little while.</p>

<p>"I mustn't try to hop against the hill at first," she told
herself. "One step after another, and there's less chance of
slipping. And I will not look back."</p>

<p>She hung her dress up with more care than she had taken since
her return to the Rue du Harlay, smoothing its crisp silk folds
with the stripes of blue against the grey background. It was such a
pretty dress, yet already it seemed years ago that she had chosen
it&mdash;not barely four months before. Standing presently in her
nightgown before the blurred square of looking-glass she marvelled
that she should still be able to recognise herself. Outwardly she
had not changed. Her face showed paler and thinner; but the faint
shadows about her eyes were not unbecoming, and her loosened hair
still shone in the candlelight.</p>

<p>She blew out her candle and lay down in the darkness. The air
outside had freshened slightly; the Needle's Eye was less
oppressive. A great weariness and relaxation overtook her. Better
to give up this futile battering at doors that were closed. There
must be some way out of her difficulties. To-morrow she would face
them with new eyes. She would write to the Hislop family in England
and ask their help. The Reverend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod would
return in another week, and she would explain everything to him.
Perhaps he could find her work even in France. And meantime she
would sleep as she had not slept in many weeks. Already her breath
came more easily, and the gentle bliss of unawareness crept upon
her.</p>

<p>She scarcely stirred, so deep and dreamless was her sleep. Dawn
slipped into Paris, into the Rue du Harlay. Milkmen with their
carts rattled over the cobblestones, and early vendors began their
morning rounds. The sun rose red above the clustered chimneypots,
touching them to brightness, finding the basket of fruit on the
window ledge with the melon waiting to be ripened. But still
Henriette slept though, many flights below her, old Pierre hobbled
out to answer the insistent jingling of the house bell.</p>

<p>Steps were mounting the stairs to the Needle's Eye, quick
hurrying footsteps and heavier ones. Someone knocked sharply at her
door. The door-knob was frantically shaken.</p>

<p>"Henriette! Henriette, wake up! Please hurry. It's I, Albert
Remey.</p>

<p>"Get up, mademoiselle, and let us in before we rouse the
house."</p>

<p>Still only half awake, she stumbled to the door and unbolted it.
Wide-eyed, she stood there in her long white nightgown, her hair
flowing on her shoulders, her feet bare. Madame Le Maire had thrown
a heavy shawl over her own night-robe and, for once, her scanty
greying knot of hair was unrelieved by the luxuriant black false
front. That, more than all other signs of agitation, alarmed
Henriette. Madame must be at the last extremity to have forgotten
that.</p>

<p>"Shut the door, Albert," the old woman commanded, "and come in.
This is no time for worrying about the proprieties."</p>

<p>"But what is it? What are you doing here, Albert, at this hour?
Is Marie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's bad news, Henriette. I came as soon as I heard it. Here!"
He pulled her to the tumbled bed and forced her to sit down, while
he bent over her, his face chalky and twitching. "Sit down. You
must prepare yourself for a shock. There's been a murder in the Rue
du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;&mdash;at Number 55&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Murder. Do you understand?" Madame's head jerked like a
frightened bird. "The Duchesse de Praslin was found brutally
murdered not two hours ago."</p>

<p>"The Duchesse." Henriette stared from one to the other, and
though her lips repeated their words her eyes remained wide and
incredulous. "But that can't be. I'm to see her at two o'clock
to-day."</p>

<p>"She's dead, I tell you." The old woman's fingers were like
claws on Henriette's arm. "Don't sit there as if you were still
asleep. All Paris will know it in another hour, and then what will
become of us?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Madame! Give her a moment to come to her senses. Let me
tell her what I can."</p>

<p>Albert took her cold hands and rubbed them between his own,
which were only a shade less chill. He was speaking to her while
Madame continued to babble and jerk hysterically.</p>

<p>"I'd been working all night on that paper for the
Acad&eacute;mie," he was saying. "I couldn't sleep, so when it grew
light I went out to walk. I often do early in the morning to calm
my nerves. That was about five, I think. I was going along the Rue
du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, and it seemed to me there was an
unusual stir for that hour. People ran past me, and when I came in
sight of Number 55 I saw a crowd collected. I thought the family
were away at Melun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They were till last night," Henriette whispered.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get near the entrance. The police were already
there."</p>

<p>"And they'll be here next," Madame was whimpering. "They'll be
pounding on my doors, saying, 'Open in the name of the law,' and
all because I took you in."</p>

<p>Albert planted himself between Madame and Henriette and tried to
go on.</p>

<p>"I asked a workman what had happened, and he told me the
Duchesse had been murdered. Hacked to pieces, he said. <i>Mon
Dieu,</i> I didn't believe him till I saw they were drawing the
blinds of her apartments. They were beginning to call the news in
the streets as I came away. I got here as fast as I could. I didn't
even stop to tell Marie. I could only think of breaking the news to
you before you heard it being shouted under your windows."</p>

<p>Henriette could not answer him. Numbness was creeping over her
as she sat in her nightgown on the edge of the bed, staring blankly
before her. Madame Le Maire's words of fright and distress fell on
her unheeded as rain.</p>

<p>"They'll be coming to arrest us all," she kept insisting. "This
is the thanks I get for sheltering you. Oh, that this should happen
to me!"</p>

<p>"But, Madame"&mdash;Albert tried to calm her&mdash;"nothing has
happened to you. Henriette has nothing to do with this frightful
crime. She was here sleeping quietly till we waked her. I only came
to prepare her for the shock. There's no reason she should be
dragged in."</p>

<p>"But she will be. You'll see. She can't be kept out. I know how
it will be, and she mustn't stay in my house another hour."</p>

<p>"Please, Madame! You mustn't give way like this. We must find
out more of this. I'll go for a paper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she'll go with you. Take her away before they come."</p>

<p>"But I must be here if I'm sent for." Henriette gathered
strength to speak at last in a toneless thread of voice. "The poor
children! They'll need me now, more than ever before."</p>

<p>"You'll not be here for the police to find."</p>

<p>The dry, difficult sobs of old age were shaking Madame Le
Maire's body under the shawl. Albert looked at her and hesitated;
then he touched Henriette's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You'd better come with me," he said. "It will be easier for you
over there with Marie. If they send for you, though I can't see why
they should, we'll leave word where you've gone. I'll wait
downstairs till you're ready."</p>

<p>Somehow he got Madame Le Maire out of the room. She waited till
their footsteps sounded faintly on the floor below. Then she got to
her feet and began to dress. Mechanically she reached for the
clothes she had left folded on a chair. Without feeling, her
fingers found brush and comb and sponge; felt for buttons and loops
and lacings. Only when she fastened the bodice of the grey and blue
silk and adjusted the full skirt did it come over her that she had
last put it on in expectation of the Duc's visit.</p>

<p>The household was already astir as she descended the stairs, her
cold hands clinging to the railing, grateful for the solid
familiarity of the wood. Albert and Pierre were waiting by the
door. The old man had forgotten his coat. He stood there anxious
and unshaved in his coarse blue blouse.</p>

<p>"Don't let any harm come to her," she heard him caution Albert
Remey. "She's not been like her old self all summer." Then, as he
let them out, he touched her arm, and his old eyes searched her
face. "Maybe it will all turn out a mistake," he whispered
encouragingly. "These papers are nothing but lies. That's why I
never read them. Mind the steps there. I spilled a jug of milk just
now. But no matter, it will give Madame something else to scold
about."</p>

<p>It was half-past six as they stepped into the street, which was
still quiet and deserted. But just around the corner they could
hear the cries of the news-vendors. Even in the distance there was
a queer exultant, almost animal note in those lifted voices,
something more than mere shrillness.</p>

<p>"Blood is in their voices," she thought, and for a moment she
turned faint and had to lean heavily on Albert.</p>

<p>"I'll get a carriage," he said.</p>

<p>She shook her head. He must not spend so much money, and she
realised that she had forgotten to bring her own purse. They walked
on without speaking, but they kept close together. She took comfort
from the sense of his kind, bodily nearness.</p>

<p>Every one they passed held a paper or was in the act of buying
one. Workmen were reading the black-lettered sheets so avidly that
she and her escort often had to turn aside to escape collision.
They alone were empty-handed. But the words of the news-vendors
followed like hounds at their heels:</p>

<p>"Murder in the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;...Murder&mdash;Praslin...<i>Catastrophe
fatale...</i> Praslin. Murder."</p>

<p>A man thrust one of the news sheets rudely into her face before
Albert could push him away. But those bold black letters could not
be thrust aside.</p>

<p>"Only a few more blocks," Albert encouraged her. "Don't listen
to them, Henriette, and forget what Madame said. She lost her
senses for the moment, that was all."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Albert, she's right! I am somehow part of
this&mdash;this&mdash;" She could not bring herself to say the
dreadful word that was echoing all about them. "Don't ask me how I
know, but I do."</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-One</h3>

<p>On the Ile de la Cit&eacute; the Palais de Justice was a sombre
pile of stone against an August sunset. Shreds of cloud, softly
brilliant as flamingo feathers, drifted across the sky and were
reflected in the river flowing between buildings. But the walls of
the Conciergerie caught no hint of that brightness. It stood grey
and unshaken by sunsets and sunrises, by revolutions and intrigues,
but the swift procession of years and the men and women it had
sheltered in the name of the law. There Marie Antoinette had spent
her last night on earth. Danton, Madame Roland,
Robespierre&mdash;these and countless others had passed through the
gate on the Quai de l'Horloge and into the Salle des Gardes. And
now on the 18th of August in the year 1847 another pair of feet had
been led across the worn stones of the courtyard; another pair of
eyes stared through one of the barred windows.</p>

<p>Henriette had made no protest when the police had come for her
at eight o'clock that morning. She had been calmer than the Remeys
then. She had even tried to reassure them as she had left between
two guards.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Marie," she had begged. "It's only a formality. I am
wanted for questioning, they say. Please, Albert, don't try to
reason with them. You only make it more difficult for us both. I'll
be back again in a little while."</p>

<p>But she had known better than to believe the words she had
spoken. Now it was evening, and still she sat alone in the small
bare room where they had brought her, the latest corner to the
Conciergerie she had so often passed. She had not guessed what it
would mean to be there. The sight of a cage is only frightening to
the bird that has once been caught. But the sound of a key turning
in the door that had just closed upon her had brought a sharp and
sudden sense of reality. It was as if a trap had been
sprung&mdash;a trap that caught but did not kill. In that moment
she had known overwhelming panic, such as she had not experienced
since early childhood. A wild impulse to beat on that door, to
scream in futile protest, had overtaken her. She had needed all her
powers of control to make no protest as the footsteps retreated
along the corridor.</p>

<p>Twice during the day they had brought her food, and a matron had
come with water, and a coverlet for her bed. They asked her if she
would care to buy a bottle of wine to drink with
<i>d&eacute;jeuner.</i> But she had declined the privilege. She
could not bring herself to explain that she had brought no money;
she could not venture a question as to why she was confined there.
All she knew she had gleaned from one of those early news sheets.
It had been under her feet that morning as she reached Albert's
door. She had picked it up and carried it with her later. They had
not taken it from her, and now in the failing light she pored over
the meagre account. For perhaps the hundredth time she forced her
aching eyes to read the words, forced her mind to believe the
reality behind those ink-smudged symbols. This concerned someone
she had known, whose home she had shared for the last six years.
The phrases were so familiar now she knew them by heart. Still she
could not realise them in relation to the Duchesse, to the plump,
dark woman whose bounty and bitterness, whose storms of jealousy
and spasms of affection she had known so intimately.</p>

<blockquote>The noble Duchesse de Praslin is no more...She breathed
her last this morning some time between half-past four and five in
the family residence in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;,
Number 55...Little is known as yet of the brutal attack on the
person of this wealthy and benevolent member of the nobility, wife
of Charles Laure Hugo Th&eacute;obald, Duc de Choiseul-Praslin,
mother of nine children, only daughter of the Mar&eacute;chal
S&eacute;bastiani...At the early hour mentioned, people on the
street and within the residence were shocked to hear violent
screams of agony and the repeated ringing of a bell from the
Duchesse's bedroom. According to report three servants&mdash;her
maid, Madame Leclerc; Madame Merville, the porter's wife; and
Auguste Charpentier, the Duc's valet de chambre&mdash;rushed to the
scene.</blockquote>

<p>Strange to read those names in cold black type when she could
summon up the persons behind the letters so clearly; when she had
exchanged good-morning and good-evening with them day after
day.</p>

<blockquote>These three tried the doors but found them locked. When
they finally effected an entrance all was in the utmost confusion
and the unfortunate woman already expiring in pools of her own
blood. The Duchesse had evidently put up a fierce struggle against
the blows of her assassin, who is believed to have escaped through
the garden and into the Champs Elys&eacute;es. According to the Duc
de Praslin, who...</blockquote>

<p>Here the paper had been torn at the very place she most longed
to read. In vain she tried to piece out the explanation which must
have followed. But she could not go beyond the impossible fact that
she had not yet been able to make herself believe. Murder did not
happen to those we have known intimately in the past, to those we
are expecting to meet to-day or to-morrow. Sensational horror or
crime cannot touch us. Other people's lives perhaps, may be crossed
by such violence, but not our own. We are somehow secure against
that.</p>

<p>Twilight settled down over the courtyard of the Conciergerie,
crept through the identical windows and deepened in the narrow
rooms. But for once darkness was not kind. More vividly than ever
she saw the pale, full face of the Duchesse with every shifting,
unpredictable mood reflected upon it. She saw, too, those luxurious
rooms which had been turned into a shambles. She could not rid her
mind of pictures those printed words had conjured up before her
eyes.</p>

<p>She saw the disordered bed and rich hangings spattered with red
stains; chairs and tables overturned; books and bric-a-brac
scattered on the carpet with its gay garlands where sinister pools
were drying in dark patches. On the secretary between the windows
where the Duchesse had so often given vent to her grievances, her
quill hurrying faster than the bird that had once borne it,
unfinished letters might still be lying in confusion. There might
even now be one beginning: "To Whom it may concern: I hereby
recommend Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy for those excellent
qualities of mind and character which she has maintained during her
years of service as governess in my household..." Such a letter
might have been penned in those last six hours of the Duchesse's
life. But Henriette knew that she would never receive it now. It
would never be presented to Madame Le Maire or another possible
employer.</p>

<p>Someone was unlocking the door. A lamp was being screwed into an
iron socket. Once more the woman in charge was speaking her name.
She set a bundle down on the cot and went through the contents
carefully. Henriette recognised her own Paisley shawl and other
articles of her clothing.</p>

<p>"Your friends brought them a little while ago," she was told.
"They wanted to see you, but you're allowed no visitors yet."</p>

<p>Marie Remey must have been to the Rue du Harlay and have
collected these few belongings. No one else would have thought of
such personal needs, and Henriette blessed her for that. This
simple gesture was all that one woman could offer to another. Yet
it comforted Henriette a little to handle the familiar lengths of
shawl, to set her brush and comb and handkerchiefs on an empty
shelf. She was most grateful to Marie for the handkerchiefs. They
smelled faintly of vervain from the gardens at Melun. A dried leaf
of it still lay between the folded squares. Strange to smell that
fragrance in this place, even stranger to be able to smell at all,
to recognise a scent when one felt this numbing paralysis of the
senses.</p>

<p>The Conciergerie cot was less hard than hers had been last night
in the Needle's Eye; the room was less stifling. Yet she lay,
staring wide-eyed into the darkness, listening to the quiet all
about her, a quiet so intense that as the hours passed she longed
for anything to break the unnatural stillness. It was a relief to
hear the hours strike or a footstep echo in courtyard or corridor.
Here, in the very heart of Paris, it was as if life were suspended.
Whether they slept or lay, wakeful as she, those within these walls
were no longer part of the city and its activity. Their lives,
their loves, their ambitions, their destinies were for the time
being entirely out of their keeping. The idea obsessed her as she
waited for morning and the first thin greying at the window.</p>

<p>She forced herself to take the bread, and coffee that was
brought her. From the guard who came to take away the tray she
begged for permission to read a morning paper, but he could not
grant that favour. He was a pleasant, talkative fellow, easily
persuaded to tell her what he could of the murder.</p>

<p>The papers were full of it, he said. No one talked of anything
else. Every caf&eacute; and shop and street corner buzzed with each
new detail of horror that leaked out. That first rumour about an
assassin having broken into the Duchesse's bedroom was all
nonsense. It appeared now that the Duc de Praslin himself was under
suspicion, though it seemed unthinkable that such a thing could
be&mdash;a husband guilty of an inhuman attack upon his own wife.
The poor woman had bled to death from over a score of wounds and
had been brutally beaten besides.</p>

<p>"No, no!" Henriette could scarcely whisper the protest that
interrupted his recital. "That's not possible. Monsieur le Duc
could never&mdash;You don't know what you're saying."</p>

<p>But he merely shrugged expressively. He was only repeating what
all Paris was saying. At first even the police had refused to
believe it. But they had had to believe what was all too plain
before their eyes. When they had followed the advice of the Duc's
own valet and searched his rooms they had found plenty of evidence
against him. Oh, yes, it looked very bad indeed for Monsieur le
Duc. He was under guard and they were taking no chances of his
escape. No matter if he was a Peer of France, answerable only to
the King, people meant to see that he paid for murder like any
other criminal.</p>

<p>"And what&mdash;do they say of me?" Henriette heard herself
asking faintly.</p>

<p>He answered with another shrug, eyeing her curiously across the
tray with its thick pottery cup and plate. Her name had certainly
been mentioned. He could not deny that. Some said that she and
Monsieur le Duc had been&mdash;well, what men and women often were
to one another. There had been rumours before about the part she
had played in that family. They said there had been no love lost
between the Duchesse and the children's governess; they hinted much
worse things than that. That was why the police had brought her to
the Conciergerie for questioning. They meant to get to the bottom
of what lay behind so ghastly a murder. She would be answering them
herself soon. Then she would know more than he could tell her. No,
he could not say how long she must stay in the Conciergerie. But
she should be thankful she was here. It would not be safe for her
to walk the streets of Paris just now.</p>

<p>It was not a public courtroom into which they led Henriette, but
a smaller, private one where perhaps a dozen men had gathered.
Their faces were so many blank disks to her as she took her place
in their midst and waited for the questioning to begin. The shock
of the guard's words that morning had left her numb, with the same
incredulous despair she had felt when Albert Remey had aroused her
from sleep with the fatal news. She had lost the power to think,
much less feel. It surprised her to find that she could still walk
erectly and without trembling, that she could seat herself calmly
on the chair that had been placed for her near the judge's
desk.</p>

<p>Monsieur Broussais, who was to conduct the interrogation, barely
looked up as she entered. His hands were busy with numerous papers,
and he appeared engrossed in conversation with another man, <i>le
Procureur du Roi.</i> They talked together in low tones, while the
rest regarded her with undisguised curiosity and made whispered
comments among themselves. Flies buzzed maddeningly; one lighted in
her hair and though she brushed it away again and again, it always
returned. So absorbed was she in trying to rid herself of it that
she hardly realised the hearing had begun until she was being
addressed. They were speaking her name, yet it seemed to belong to
someone else, to bear no relationship to her personally. So began
the first examination of Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes,
aged thirty-five years, spinster, governess, native of Paris,
resident of the pension conducted by Madame Le Maire at Number 9,
Rue du Harlay, in the district Marais.</p>

<p>The first questions put to her were perfunctory: How long had
she been in the employ of the Praslin family? What salary had she
received? What had been the nature of her duties? She replied in a
steady voice that surprised. But the next question came in a
different tone. Monsieur Broussais leaned across the desk and fixed
her with his enigmatic, deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>"We have already learned that you were guilty of grave wrong in
this household: that you did not show the deceased Duchesse proper
regard, that you sought to alienate the affections of her husband
and children. Is this true?"</p>

<p>The other occupants of the room also leaned forward in their
places. Henriette felt the slight rustle of excitement that
followed his words, and she knew that the time had come to give
more than a perfunctory answer. All eyes were upon her as they
waited for words from her lips. She summoned them to her as one
might call upon a well-trained pack of hounds to perform their
duty.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur." She spoke clearly and without hesitation. "That
was never so. When I first entered the Praslin household matters
were already on a very bad footing. There had been governesses
before me, but they had left because they found it impossible to
get on with Madame la Duchesse. Always there was trouble over the
children and their education."</p>

<p>"And what was the nature of this trouble you mention?"</p>

<p>"The Duc wished to direct that himself, and it was understood
from the first that I should be accountable only to monsieur. I was
to live and dine with the children in separate quarters. I told the
Duc that this was a difficult position for me and great
responsibility, and some adjustments were made. But it was not
easy. The former governess was still there when I took up my
duties, and naturally she resented my presence. From the first she
prejudiced the Duchesse against me. Madame continued to interfere
with the children's affairs and the results were unfortunate.
Monsieur was greatly displeased and expressed himself so to Madame.
So we came to live more and more apart, the children and I, though
I never consciously tried to win them away from their mother. The
disagreements between the Duc and Duchesse continued, and it was
beyond my power to change that. Perhaps it was wrong for me to have
accepted so extraordinary a position, but I never tried to hurt
Madame. If I did sometimes answer her with annoyance it was only
because I had been myself unjustly hurt."</p>

<p>"And what," the questioning voice was going on, "were the causes
of this dissension you speak of between the Duc and the
Duchesse?"</p>

<p>"On the Duchesse's part it seemed to be a desire to dominate the
children, and above all her husband. With the Duc it seemed to be a
fixed spirit of resistance, though he was less violent by
nature."</p>

<p>"Your presence in the intimate life of this family seems to have
particularly inspired the Duchesse's jealousy. Was there good
cause?"</p>

<p>"I cannot deny that at times Madame la Duchesse showed marked
jealousy towards me, jealousy which had no grounds whatsoever. Then
at other times the situation between us was less strained. When she
was in good humour and treated me graciously I could forget her
unjust accusations. There I was, messieurs, without money or
friends. I had to try my best to keep the position though often it
took all my patience. Then, too, Monsieur le Duc offered me a
pension if I had the courage&mdash;those were his very
words&mdash;to complete the education of his older daughters, and I
had promised, difficult though that might be."</p>

<p>The matter of the pension had to be investigated: Had it been
part of the original agreement when she took up her duties? Had a
definite figure been set? What could she recall of the conversation
concerning it? A long pause followed while Monsieur Broussais made
notes on the papers before him. Then he cleared his throat in
preparation for his next sally. In the tense quiet of the room that
had an ominous sound.</p>

<p>"Is it not true," he asked, "that the Duchesse, particularly of
late, believed that intimate relations existed between yourself and
her husband?"</p>

<p>So, the old scandal had cropped up again. Henriette had known it
must, and she was prepared to face it.</p>

<p>"Never, monsieur, no, never that!" She made the denial swiftly,
then she spoke more slowly, weighing her words with care, realising
as she did the significance of the question. "The Duchesse knew
that such relations could not have existed. She did not accuse me
of them. She may have said so to others, but not to me. Certain
libellous articles did appear in the newspapers. Two years ago,
while I was staying with the children in Corsica, there was a very
malicious one and I wanted to leave at once because of it. But the
Mar&eacute;chal S&eacute;bastiani, the Duchesse's own father,
persuaded me to stay. For some time the Duchesse did treat me
harshly. But then she grew less cold, and all through this past
winter she was gracious to me. I had even hoped we might come to a
better understanding when two months or so ago I was overwhelmed to
be told that my presence was no longer desired."</p>

<p>Monsieur Broussais's expression remained impassive during this
recital. When she stopped speaking he reached among the papers
before him and selected one which he handed to her. It was written
on a sheet of the Duchesse's own note-paper, and though it bore no
date or salutation she recognised it as one written to her,
beginning:</p>

<blockquote>If it is forbidden to go to rest without being
reconciled to one's neighbour, it seems to me that a New Year is a
still more urgent reason for putting aside all disagreements and
forgetting all complaints.</blockquote>

<p>So, she thought, staring down at that familiar writing, they had
already been to Madame Le Maire's and rifled the box where she kept
her private possessions.</p>

<p>"This letter," she explained, "was written by the Duchesse to me
a year ago. It came with a bracelet as a New Year's gift. I
remember it very well because it marked a change in her former
coldness. She took me to the theatre with the young ladies
sometimes, and even discussed the subject of their future marriage.
She asked me to use my influence with the Duc about his views on
this matter, but I had to refuse that. I could not intrude in
anything so personal."</p>

<p>When the letter had been returned to Monsieur Broussais's
portfolio, more questions followed. These concerned her dismissal,
the date of her leaving the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;,
and whether she had continued to see the Duc. There were others, as
to how and where she had passed the night of August 17th, how she
had first heard of yesterday's tragedy, and why she had not been at
Madame Le Maire's when the police agents came for her. It was the
next question that brought her to her feet, her eyes wide and
panic-stricken as they turned upon her questioner.</p>

<p>"Have you learned of the grave charges against Monsieur le Duc?
Do you know that he is believed to have murdered his wife?"</p>

<p>"No, no, messieurs!" She found herself searching the faces one
by one in frantic appeal. "Tell me it's only some unfounded rumour.
I cannot believe he could have done it. He could never bear to see
the slightest suffering of one of his children. Please tell me
these charges are not&mdash;what you say!"</p>

<p>But no one reassured her; the eyes continued to watch the effect
of the news upon her. She knew from their silence that this was
more than some wild rumour. It could not be true, and yet if it
should be...Somehow she must make them understand the part she had
unwittingly played in all this. The letter! She must try to explain
about it. It came over her now in a lightning flash of conviction
that she alone held the key to this horror. That letter of
recommendation had been written in the Duchesse's blood.</p>

<p>Her knees were shaking; her hands clasping and unclasping
themselves. She heard herself pleading, babbling broken, incoherent
phrases, as Madame Le Maire had done yesterday.</p>

<p>"Please, messieurs, listen to me. He could never have done this
dreadful thing but if he should have had any part in
<i>it&mdash;Mon Dieu,</i> then it is I who am the guilty one
because I asked too much...I, who so loved the children, adored
them...was a coward not to accept my fate. I wrote them. You can
see the letters for yourselves. I told them how unhappy I was, that
I no longer cared to live. I was afraid to face the future. Oh, I
was wrong, wrong! I ought not to have let them know my misery. I
should have pretended I was resigned, even happy in that bare small
room. I ought to have told them to forget me and think only of
their mother. But I was not brave enough for that. I was driven to
despair, and I wanted to die. I had a bottle of laudanum, and I
drank it. Unfortunately I was called back to life, and life was
bitter to me. After six years of such happiness among those
children I loved and who loved me, the emptiness seemed unbearable.
I can see it all now, and now it is too late. He must have gone to
her demanding that fatal letter of recommendation the Duchesse had
promised me. She must have refused him, and then...There, you see,
I am guilty. Write it down there in your records&mdash;guilty."</p>

<p>Monsieur Broussais's voice cut into her recital, cool and
precise and edged with irony.</p>

<p>"It seems hardly possible, mademoiselle, that such a display of
emotion, and such lofty sentiments as these you have just
expressed, should be applied to children. Was it to these children
only that you addressed the despairing letters you mentioned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur." She raised her eyes directly to his. "All
sentiments can be lofty, as you say. Can't you understand that? But
I won't deny that when the Duc was so good to me, always so
generous and thoughtful, there did not mingle with the love I felt
for the children, a genuine affection for their father." She caught
her breath sharply, and went on, her voice rising in the stillness
of the room. "But I never brought sin into that home&mdash;adultery
then, since that is in your minds. I could never have held those
children close if I had been guilty of that. They were like my own
children, thought perhaps I am wrong to use those words for this
whole little band. Still, that is how it was. Can't you understand
that it is possible to love honestly?"</p>

<p>Question followed question, but she answered, without
hesitation, Monsieur Broussais's bombardment. Now that she had
rallied from the first shock, her wits returned, and she was able
to meet and turn aside his deft, sarcastic implications. She met
the challenge with squared shoulders and a swift, sure fire of
words that kept all eyes upon her; that even brought a grudging
hint of admiration into the voice of her examiner. She knew he
waited like a cat to pounce on any remark that might be
misinterpreted, to twist anything that could be turned as evidence
against her. She knew how much depended on her answers. It was not
enough to speak the truth and that alone. One must be clever as
well as honest.</p>

<p>Outside, the noon sun stood high over the roofs of Paris, over
the metallic glitter of the Seine parting its watery coil above the
Ile de la Cit&eacute;, about the Palais de Justice and the
Conciergerie. Inside the crowded room the air grew heavy, and a
merciless glare filled the unshaded windows. Men's faces gleamed
with heat. Monsieur Broussais paused often to wipe the moisture
from brow and spectacles. Henriette's handkerchief was a limp ball
in her hands. She pushed the damp hair from her forehead and
accepted a sip of water from a glass an attendant offered. She must
not let her mind wander for an instant. No matter how the flies
buzzed or how her eyes and head ached from trying to catch the full
meaning of the words addressed to her, she must keep on the alert.
All her life she had loved words and kindled to them, but now she
was in their power. They shot to and fro, like shuttles weaving the
threads of some invisible pattern. If only one could know the
pattern one wove in that hot room while minutes ticked away into
hours!</p>

<p>Ruthlessly as a surgeon dissecting a patient, Monsieur
Broussais's questions probed to the very core of that life in the
Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, in Melun, and in Corsica. The
quick blade of his irony delicately laid bare the tissues wrapping
cause and motive. He must trap her into some unguarded admission of
complicity. But she, too, held a blade as powerful as her
questioners. She was speaking the truth. She had nothing to hide
from him.</p>

<p>At last Monsieur Broussais pushed aside his papers with an
impatient gesture. It was plain that he tired of these constant
allusions to the Praslin children and the controversies between
them and their mother. Here was a crime of unspeakable brutality,
the most significant socially and politically he had ever been
given to investigate, and this poised, attractive woman sitting
before him refused to allow herself to play into his hands. She
dared to confound him with answers as crisp as his questions,
answers in which he could not find the admissions of guilt he had
expected to uncover without much difficulty.</p>

<p>"Come, mademoiselle." He spoke brusquely. "We must keep to the
point. We are here to consider, not these suspicions between
yourself and the deceased Duchesse, not the jealousy which brought
about your immediate dismissal, or this letter of recommendation,
the importance of which you have stressed. What concerns us now is
a matter of the most serious trouble that can be brought into any
household&mdash;discord between man and wife. You were supported by
the husband against the wife. Can you deny that this was so?"</p>

<p>"In certain matters, true. But how could I know how far it was
carried, or how serious the trouble between them actually had
become? As to what is evidently in your mind, monsieur, I can only
repeat that the Duc de Praslin never showed other feelings for me
than friendship and esteem. Again I must protest, and I will not
mince words&mdash;he was never my lover."</p>

<p>The sincerity of her denial was apparent. But Monsieur Broussais
was not through.</p>

<p>"Yet in the brief interval since you left that household," he
pressed her, "you have penned letters which you yourself admit you
did wrong to write, and you allowed the Duc to pay you visits,
three at least. Yesterday you were to have gone to that house to
see the Duchesse about this letter, and yesterday she met a violent
death. How do you explain all these coincidences?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain them, to myself or to you. I can only say what
I have said before. I can only repeat that nothing wrong ever
passed between myself and Monsieur le Duc, and there was never any
future wrong intended."</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, gathering words to answer a question
that had not yet been put to her.</p>

<p>"I tell you the children's interests came first with me always.
If the Duchesse had died a natural death, and if the Duc had then
asked me to marry him, I should not have consented for their sakes
to such a misalliance. And I have no idea of any other wrong. If
Monsieur le Duc had loved me, there is no telling&mdash;I might
have sacrificed my life and reputation for him. But as it was I
never tried to come between him and his wife. I would not have
harmed a hair of her head. I'm telling you the truth, monsieur, and
you must believe me. Is there not something in the tone of a voice
that can convince you of that?"</p>

<p>Her ability at anticipating questions and turning her answers
into direct appeal had scored her several points. The group of
listeners could not help being swayed by her eloquence and lack of
pretence. Monsieur Broussais was himself amazed. He had never been
called upon to examine such a witness. But he could not afford to
be lost in admiration. The interview was not over. Once more he
brought out a handful of papers for her to identify.</p>

<p>"You have here before you," he interposed, "certain letters.
Were they written by you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur. I sent them to the older Praslin daughters a
month or so ago."</p>

<p>"One of them contains an unfinished sentence, whose full meaning
is not clear: 'You do not speak of your father. I hope that he is
well and continues to keep his courage. It seems to me I should be
less unhappy if I were sure to suffer&mdash;' Will you please
complete 'the sentence for us?"</p>

<p>Henriette's heart sank. She had regretted that letter ever since
it had been dispatched. She had written it impulsively to Louise on
a day when it had seemed impossible to go on alone in the Rue du
Harlay. Read aloud like this, apart from its context, the sentence
certainly took on more significance than she had intended at the
time.</p>

<p>"I must have meant to end the sentence with the word 'alone,"
she told them, "or perhaps with the phrase 'for all of you.' I
cannot remember why I broke it off. Perhaps I decided it would be
better not to speak to the young girls of their father."</p>

<p>Monsieur Broussais nodded as he took charge of the letters once
more.</p>

<p>"You did right," he commented dryly, "quite right, because it
contained expressions of feeling which were not fit for young girls
to share."</p>

<p>A quick protest rose to her lips, but the hearing was over. For
the present at least Monsieur Broussais and his associates were
done with her. A court clerk was already beginning to copy down the
notes he had made of those questions and her answers.</p>

<p>"God alone knows," she thought as she passed by that desk on her
way from the room, "who will read these words that have gone out of
my keeping."</p>

<p>Outside those doors, the spirit that had carried her through the
ordeal left her completely. She felt limp and exhausted, as shaken
and spent as if she were an old woman. The store of energy that she
had called to her aid for the last hour was gone. She was grateful
for the guard's arm as she mounted once more to her room in the
Conciergerie.</p>

<p>She could not swallow the meal they brought her. She shook her
head when they gave her permission to walk in the courtyard for
half an hour. So they left her, and she sat on through the
interminable afternoon, trying to recall each word that had been
spoken at the hearing. Why had she not thought of such and such an
answer? Had she made them understand about that letter? What other
private papers of hers, of the Duc and of the Duchesse, might not
Monsieur Broussais and the police be poring over at that very
moment? They all believed the Duc was guilty, and that she was his
accomplice in crime. Though she had not slept in the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; that night, they all believed that she
had had a part in this horror.</p>

<p>"It's not possible," she repeated as she had repeated that
morning. "It's not possible. Monsieur le Duc could never have done
such a terrible thing."</p>

<p>She said the words over and over, and yet all the while she was
unconvinced. She wanted to believe in that first rumour of the
mysterious assassin who had escaped into the garden, but she could
not. She was remembering the strained expression of his face as she
had seen it last in Madame Le Maire's poorly lighted hall. She
remembered how the stair rail had quivered under his grip. She
thought of those large, powerful hands that she had seen so often
laid fondly upon one child or another or on Berthe's yellow hair.
And now they were stained with blood. The sudden recollection of a
spring night came to her, the night when he and Louise had
surprised her by their return from the country. He had poured out a
glass of port, and some of the wine had spilled. She felt faint
now, remembering the red drops on his white skin and how
fastidiously he had wiped them away. Six years ago last May, that
had been...</p>

<p>"It's not possible," she kept repeating stubbornly.</p>

<p>Yet she knew too well the truth her lips denied. The daily venom
of the Duchesse's jealousy had corroded his self-control. It was as
if an oak tree that had defied storms and woodsmen had fallen at
last under the incessant hammerings of a woodpecker.</p>

<p>A key clicked in the lock, and the door was opened. She roused
at the sound of a familiar voice speaking her name, scarcely daring
to believe in the reality of her visitor. Yet there before her
stood the Reverend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod. Sobs shook her as
they had not shaken her through the long, dark hours of the night
or during the hearing that morning. She was no longer alone, and
that knowledge overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"But how did you come here?" she asked when she grew calmer.
"Albert and Marie Remey tried, but they were turned away; and I
thought I had no other friends in Paris."</p>

<p>He kept her hands in his and spoke reassuringly.</p>

<p>"I am your friend, Mademoiselle Deluzy, Mademoiselle
Desportes&mdash;it does not matter which name you go by, and I am
also your spiritual adviser. They cannot deny you the comfort of
your Church, no matter what the charges are against you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur Monod, I hardly know yet what the charges are.
This terrible crime, and they say he has done it, and only night
before last he came, with the children&mdash;" She struggled
against her tears at the memory.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you will," he said. "Don't be afraid that I shall
repeat your confidences. I know what they are saying of your part
in this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't believe that I am guilty?"</p>

<p>"No." He shook his head. "But even if I were in doubt I should
have come to you here. You would have needed me even more. I was in
the country when I read the news. Those first reports made no
mention of your name, but I knew you were a member of that
household, and I guessed the shock would be too much for you. I did
not know you had left. I did not know till I reached Paris this
morning that they had taken you into custody."</p>

<p>She managed to tell him all she could of her dismissal, of the
Duc's last visit, and the letter which she insisted must have been
the cause of the tragedy.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "it may be as you say. Goliath went down
before a pebble from David's sling, and this letter of yours, no
doubt, was the final blow. But you must not dwell on that. You have
made mistakes; so have we all, though some of us are less ready to
admit them."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Monod"&mdash;she faced him through her tears as she
poured out the story of those six difficult years, while light
faded in the courtyard of the Conciergerie&mdash;"I ought to have
told you all this before&mdash;before it was too late. I ought to
have asked your advice. But I was so sure of myself. I believed I
could manage my own life. Mud might spatter and spoil other skirts,
but not mine. Somehow I believed no harm could come to me because I
meant no harm to others. I was defiant and proud because I felt too
sure of myself."</p>

<p>"You are not the first to make that mistake," he answered
gravely. "We all believe our lives are our own till we find we
cannot separate them from other lives."</p>

<p>"And I thought," she went on, "I thought, because I committed no
actual wrong, that I was above reproach. But now&mdash;it's
terrible to think that she met this violent death, and that I, too,
am being held to account for it. I could never like her. I could
never respect her. Even now I can't bring myself to forget her
faults and her stupidities, but I can never forget that she might
be alive to-day, poor soul, if I had not insisted on what I
believed was my right. Nothing I can do or say can ever change
that. She is dead, and. God knows what will become of him and of
the children."</p>

<p>Monsieur Monod did not try to ease her with trite phrases of
comfort. He did not offer to pray for her as other ministers of the
Gospel might have done.</p>

<p>"You are too honest to make excuses for yourself," he said. "You
are suffering far more than you deserve; for, the greater one's
capacity for living, the greater one's capacity for suffering. But
remember that the greatest wisdom is to find out one's folly. Keep
your courage, mademoiselle. You'll need it, whether Monsieur le Duc
is able to clear himself of these charges or not."</p>

<p>She begged for news of the Duc, but he could tell her little
more than she already knew&mdash;that he had been taken into
custody by the police. Each newspaper edition published a more
sensational story than the last. Monsieur Monod told her what he
could, without attempting to keep other aspects of the case from
her. The whole country was aroused, and feeling grew more and more
intense. It involved the King and the whole structure of his
Court.</p>

<p>"Out there," he told her, "the people believe that the Duc is
guilty, and they want to see him tried like any other criminal.
But, being a nobleman, he is answerable only to his superiors in
rank&mdash;the King and the House of Peers. If he should be freed
of this murder charge, the King is sure to be accused of
discrimination; and if he is convicted, that will bring great
censure on the Court circle. You know the discontent that is in the
very air."</p>

<p>Yes, she knew, though she had not thought of that before. Her
personal problems had absorbed her completely. But now she sensed
what lay behind his words. The King was far from popular, the
public ready to pounce on anything that savoured of corruption in
Court circles. This might be the chance the country had been
waiting for, to assert its power. It was ironical, she thought,
that she should figure in a case involving the House of Peers and
the King himself&mdash;she, who had championed the cause of a new
Republic, who had always been so outspoken in her denunciation of
the House of Orl&eacute;ans.</p>

<p>"I know the feeling is against me, too," she said. "One of the
guards told me so this morning. He said I was safer here in the
Conciergerie than at large in Paris."</p>

<p>Once more Monsieur Monod did not try to soften his answer.</p>

<p>"There are wild rumours going about," he admitted.
"Unfortunately your name is coupled with the Duc's. You know the
public is more easily swayed by persons than by principles. It's
simpler to fasten blame to a man or a woman than to a system of
government. Of course no one can guess how this feeling will be
from hour to hour. I've seen public opinion shift like a wind and
put out the very fire it lighted."</p>

<p>"Or the fire can spread, monsieur, till there's no longer any
chance to put it out."</p>

<p>"Well," he told her, "the King is hurrying back to Paris. It's
not a simple case of murder that he has to deal with. For that
reason it is important that you have a good lawyer at once. You
have a right to legal advice, and I shall see that you have the
best we can find."</p>

<p>But she shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur Monod, I can do without a lawyer. I can answer
their questions for myself."</p>

<p>"But you have no knowledge of the law, my child, and you must
have help in giving your testimony. Some ignorant blunder on your
part, some sudden impulse, might do you great harm."</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk. I'll tell them anything they want to know
as I did to-day."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be hasty in this. If it's the matter of money that
makes you hesitate, you're not to give that a thought. I have means
enough to help you, and I happen to have influential friends in the
law. You shall have the best possible counsel."</p>

<p>"You're more than kind to me," she broke in. "I don't know why
you should be when I have no claim upon you. I ask no reason for
your generosity, I am only very grateful. But a lawyer would
confuse me. The truth is all I have to offer, and I must give it to
them in my own way."</p>

<p>He smiled at her in spite of his disapproval.</p>

<p>"Have it your way then," he said.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and a voice warned them that
Monsieur Monod had overstayed his allotted time.</p>

<p>"I haven't prayed with you, my child," he said as he rose, "but
I think you are capable of making your own prayers. Mine you will
have, and those of my household."</p>

<p>"It's good to know that. And you'll come again?" She clung to
him anxiously.</p>

<p>"As often as they will let me. Remember, you are not alone. You
have friends. The Remeys are waiting for me now. Have you any
messages for them?"</p>

<p>"Only my love and thanks. And perhaps if you were to talk with
my grandfather&mdash;" She told him the address and hurried on: "He
has never thought well of me. He opposed my taking this place. That
was why I used another name; but still he is my only relative, and
at such a time he might be willing to come to my aid."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do. I'll go to him with your message at
once. Is there anything else on your mind?"</p>

<p>"If you could bring me any word of the Praslin children it would
relieve me, especially of the younger ones. And, yes, there is one
more thing. Tell Albert and Marie to remind Madame Le Maire of the
basket on my window-sill. It would be a pity to have the fruit
spoil, and the melon ought to be ripe by now."</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-Two</h3>

<p>During that week of August 18th to 24th, 1847, all France rocked
with horrified impatience at each day's revelation in the Praslin
murder case. Not only in Paris and Marseilles, but in Brussels,
Amsterdam and Berlin, in London and Manchester, men and women
discussed it in shocked voices, avid for more details. They read
the doctors' reports on the body of the Duchesse, describing
minutely the score of wounds, almost any one of which had been deep
enough to prove fatal. They pored over diagrams of Number 55 Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, following those gruesome ink marks
which represented the bloody tracks the victim had left on
furniture, floor and walls during the savage struggle; the red
prints of her fingers groping desperately to find the bell cords.
They devoured the testimony of the servants who had answered her
summons; that testimony which was united in its accounts of
domestic discord and in its insistence that the lately dismissed
governess had been the chief cause of quarrels between Monsieur and
Madame. They read of the valet, Charpentier, and his shrewd advice
to the police not to search for the murderer outside the house, but
to look into his master's quarters.</p>

<p>They marvelled at the reiterated denials of the Duc, confronted
as he was by such irrefutable evidence as a blood-stained
dressing-gown and shirt; the charred remains of burned letters and
papers in his fireplace, and those unexplained scratches and bites
upon his hands. How could he cling so stubbornly to his flimsy
story of an assassin in the face of such indubitable proof of his
own guilt? How could any man, let alone the head of one of the
noblest families in France, do such a deed of violence and
brutality, people asked one another on either side of the Channel.
The opinion everywhere was unanimous in branding him as the most
inhuman criminal of his day. From statesmen to shopkeepers and
street vendors, it was agreed that no further evidence was needed
to condemn him, and no death sentence could be cruel enough for
such a man.</p>

<p>And this Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, the
ex-governess whose name and accomplishments figured so prominently
in every version of the crime&mdash;what of her? She, too, was
being torn to shreds in a variety of languages. Always a woman in
the case, they agreed, and what a woman she must be! No man hacked
a faithful wife, the mother of his nine children, to death unless
some other woman had driven him to madness. She must be the most
subtle siren on record. Yet how could that be possible for a
governess in her middle thirties, and not beautiful, either,
according to the papers? But one could never explain such things.
The Duc had visited her with several of the children only a few
hours before the murder. She had admitted that much and more in a
secret hearing. The police had taken charge of her and her
belongings. It was well they had done so at once, for with feeling
running so high against her there was no telling what a mob might
do.</p>

<p>As early as Friday, August 10th, the London <i>Times</i> was
already commenting on the importance of the case in an
editorial:</p>

<blockquote>The Paris papers of Wednesday, received by our ordinary
express, contain no political news of any importance. "Even had it
been otherwise," says one of our correspondents, "public attention
is so painfully absorbed by the murder of the Duchesse de Praslin
that nothing short of an insurrection would attract
notice."</blockquote>

<p>On Saturday, August 21st, Paris papers announced that the Duc de
Praslin had the night before been secretly removed under close
guard from his residence to the prison of the Luxembourg. There he
was said to be suffering from a mysterious illness. His
indisposition was considered serious enough to warrant the
attention of his personal physician, Dr. Louis, and to delay his
examination by Chancellor Pasquier, President of the House of
Peers. Alarming rumours began to circulate later that day as to the
prisoner's condition, which was said to be growing serious.
Meanwhile the Court of Peers gathered to present the
arraignment.</p>

<p>No one who reported on the events of that week could actually be
sure what new turn the case might take from hour to hour.
Information received on good authority might be worthless by the
time it had been set in type. The most conservative papers read
like lurid gossip sheets, and even important figures in literary
circles left their desks to crowd the benches at the first public
hearings, setting down their impressions of those concerned in
<i>l'affaire Praslin.</i> Victor Hugo, writing a day-to-day account
in his <i>Choses Vues,</i> commented on many phases of the
investigation. He noted on Sunday, August 22nd:</p>

<blockquote>At the present moment one can perceive, in Mademoiselle
Deluzy's window in Madame Le Maire's house, Rue du Harlay, the
melon, the bouquet and the basket of fruit which the Duc brought
from the country the very evening before the murder. The Duc is
seriously ill. People say he is poisoned.</blockquote>

<p>After an account of her position in the family and excerpts from
her first questioning, he continued:</p>

<blockquote>Mademoiselle Deluzy is still in the Conciergerie. She
walks about in the courtyard each day for two hours. Sometimes she
wears a nankeen dress, sometimes a striped silk gown. She knows
that many eyes are fixed upon her at the windows. Those who watch
her say she strikes attitudes.</blockquote>

<p>Another writer in <i>Gazette des Tribunaux</i> added a more
detailed account of her during that period of daily exercise:</p>

<blockquote>"The description of Mademoiselle Deluzy given in
&mdash;&mdash; is not altogether correct. She is dressed simply,
but is not wanting in distinction or grace. Her figure has lost the
suppleness of early youth, but her eyes, which are circled with
dark rings, have an intelligent expression. Her complexion is pale
and shows fatigue; her hair, of rich brown, is arranged with taste.
She wore yesterday a nankeen dress, a black scarf, and a straw
bonnet with lilac ruching. She walked slowly, her arms crossed on
her breast, and her head bent."</blockquote>

<p>So the days passed for Henriette without transition, but with
one shock after another in the avalanche of calamity that had
overtaken her. Her second examination took place, this one before
Chancellor Pasquier. Of this <i>proc&egrave;s verbal</i> Victor
Hugo made mention, quoting one of his colleagues as saying:</p>

<blockquote>You will see Mademoiselle Deluzy. She is a rare woman.
Her letters are masterpieces of wit and style. Her response to
questioning is admirable...If you had heard her you would have been
astounded. No one has more grace, more tact, or more intelligence.
If she wishes to write some day for us, we will give her, <i>par
Dieu,</i> the Montyon Prize. For the rest she is headstrong and
imperious; a woman at once wicked and charming.</blockquote>

<p>Henriette was better prepared for her second ordeal, though the
sleeplessness from which she suffered and the strain of waiting had
told upon her. She needed no mirror to confirm her feeling that
youth had left her for ever. The elasticity of hope was gone out of
her step and out of her heart. But she met the questions with the
same unflinching directness she had shown before. Her answers came
without hesitation; each word as direct and well chosen as the
Chancellor's own. For hours the verbal tournament went on.</p>

<p>"You did not try, then, as you should have tried in every way
possible, to bring these children closer to their mother?"</p>

<p>"I tried sometimes, at first, but it was useless; and though the
Duchesse did not approve of many of Monsieur Praslin's ideas on
their education, she seemed willing to leave that to him. She never
gave me any orders about their welfare, except in matters that
concerned their dress, and she rarely talked to them. When we were
by ourselves, which was seldom, she would talk to me of matters
above the heads of children. They grew restless and preferred to be
alone with me, and this annoyed their mother."</p>

<p>"Did you not realise," Chancellor Pasquier persisted, "that such
isolation from her children must be painful to a mother&mdash;that
it would cause difficulties between herself and the Duc de
Praslin?"</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary, monsieur. I believe on my soul and honour
that Madame de Praslin was far more preoccupied with her feelings
for her husband than about her children, whom she sent away when
their father was present in order to be alone with him. She was
constantly trying to divert his attention from them to herself. I
have seen her leave the room abruptly if Monsieur le Duc played
with or fondled one of the children. She was always showing her
jealousy and irritation at such marks of affection. The children
realised this and, with the innocent malice of their age, only
redoubled their demonstrations to their father. I saw the harm that
this sort of struggle did them, but it was not always in my power
to prevent the bad effect of it. As time went on and my love for my
pupils grew greater, I could not keep entirely impartial to all
this daily friction. I could not give back to Madame de Praslin
those she had wilfully, or at least imprudently, allowed to slip
away from her."</p>

<p>Her explanation left the Chancellor unconvinced. There was open
rebuke in his next words and in the manner of their delivery.</p>

<p>"From all you say, it is evident that you are trying to throw
the entire blame upon Madame de Praslin. It is hardly your place to
be the judge in such matters, and your words lead me to doubt that
you did all it was your duty to do in meeting so deplorable a
situation between this mother and her children. It appears from the
testimony of others and from documents in our possession that you
exercised almost absolute power over these young people. We are
forced to believe that you have been far, very far, from conducting
yourself in such circumstances as you ought to have done."</p>

<p>Once more Henriette gathered all her forces to reply.</p>

<p>"I would not for the world be lacking in respect for Madame de
Praslin's memory," she began. "But you ask the truth of me, and I
am bound to tell the whole truth to the best of my ability. I do
not criticise Madame's heart or her intentions, but her character
is another matter. Her temperament was difficult, very irritable
and inflexible, which made her incapable of handling so many
children of various ages, minds and dispositions. She had not the
faculty of winning the heart and confidence of youth. She would
take undue offence over some small matter where indulgence was
needed and then pass over some important issue that called for
firmness. These were the reasons why Monsieur le Duc insisted upon
her not meddling in the children's education. Unfortunately the
Duc's pleasure in his daughters' company angered the Duchesse. We
all suffered in consequence."</p>

<p>"And so it appears that the authority which had disappeared
entirely from Madame de Praslin's hands passed into yours; the
affection of the children for their mother also became concentrated
in you. Suppose you did not actually exert yourself to bring this
about, you must have seen how matters were and known that it was
your duty to prevent rather than aggravate the situation. We must
therefore hold you responsible to a large degree for the fatal
results which have followed."</p>

<p>Chancellor Pasquier had shifted from question to direct
accusation, but Henriette had her defence ready.</p>

<p>"I never said, 'I will turn the affections of these children for
their mother to myself.' But I loved them and I devoted my whole
self to them. Their pleasures were my pleasures; their pain was my
pain. Six years I watched over them by day and by night. They loved
me with all the enthusiasm of their years, and I returned their
love. I was without family ties, without friends, and all my
feelings were bound up in my duties, which were so congenial and
pleasant. What more can I say except to ask you this: Could not any
mother have won her children to her if she had wished to do
so?"</p>

<p>This unfortunate ability for turning questions upon her
questioners made her a spirited witness. Like Monsieur Broussais,
the Chancellor found her more than his match in repartee. But she
never went too far in her efforts to justify herself. She clung
tenaciously to her points and, though at times her crispness verged
on arrogance, she maintained a respectful dignity of bearing and
speech that was above reproach. Again she was questioned about her
last meeting with the Duc, and again she gave a full recital of
that evening visit to Madame Le Maire's with its fatal emphasis on
the letter of recommendation. Only once did she falter, when it
came to repeating his last words to her: "I play a sorry part in
all this...Good-night till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And Monsieur de Praslin said nothing that might have led you to
think he was roused to go to such lengths with the Duchesse?"</p>

<p>"No, never." She spoke with unusual vehemence. "By all that I
hold sacred in life! I do not know if I am allowed to mention here
certain facts, known to me alone, which proved that the violence
was not always on Monsieur le Duc's side. I often heard the
Duchesse threaten to take her own life, and twice to my knowledge
she attempted to do so. Once at Melun she tried to stab herself,
and the Duc in disarming her wounded his hand. Again at Dieppe,
after a quarrel, she rushed out of the house, threatening to throw
herself into the sea. But with those unpredictable and changing
characteristics of which I have told you, she was found later by
Monsieur le Duc in a shop, apparently quite calm again and making
some purchases."</p>

<p>She had hoped to arouse sympathy for the Duc, but it was evident
from the Chancellor's comment that he considered this only another
proof of the desperate extremity of the Duchesse. The hearing
proceeded much as the first one had done, but with more minute
questioning on the daily life and routine of the household. Where
Monsieur Broussais had questioned her specifically as to improper
relations with the Duc, Chancellor Pasquier seemed more inclined to
believe her protestations that no such liaison could have existed.
He seemed determined to prove her guilty of a far less obvious
crime. His interest now centred upon her undue influence over the
Praslin children and the direct results of this upon their parents.
It was a clever move on his part to shift the emphasis in order to
prove her guilty of a deliberate campaign to estrange the children
from their mother. Her own admissions could be used against her in
this way. If she tried to justify her hold over her young pupils by
explaining their mother's jealousy and indifference, she would be
accused of laying the blame upon a dead woman who could not be
called upon to clear herself. If she did not account for her
sympathy towards the children and their father, she would appear
more than ever what the public believed her to be&mdash;a scheming
serpent whose wiles were behind that tragedy of August 18th. She
knew she stood between the two pitfalls. She could only cling, as
she had told the Reverend Monsieur Monod she would cling, to the
truth. That was her only weapon of defence against these officials
in their red robes who sorted and weighed her acts and words as
deliberately as if they were actually balancing them on mental
scales.</p>

<p>"No," she reiterated wearily as the session dragged on and on.
"I did not try to take them from their mother. One cannot steal
affections, messieurs; they are given freely or not at all. And you
must believe me when I tell you I am not maligning the Duchesse.
She was the same to others, often unjust and fault-finding, but she
had kind impulses, too. One moment she could cut to the quick, and
in the next be generous and pleasant. Often in the space of an hour
she would be like that, perhaps blaming me because she thought I
exerted too great influence over her family and then presently
coming to beg me to use it to gain some favour for herself. She
would hurt me cruelly or make me some handsome present. One never
knew what to expect."</p>

<p>But this seemed to be taken by her questioners as further proof
of the Duchesse's goodness. More questions followed. Henriette's
head throbbed with them. The room with all those watching faces
swam in a haze before her, and the scratching of pens on paper went
on without pause.</p>

<p>"In every answer you make, you insinuate some wrong against
Madame de Praslin," the voice rebuked again.</p>

<p>Tears of protest and weariness rose to her eyes. She wiped them
away and forced herself to answer in a voice that shook from the
long strain.</p>

<p>"I wish sincerely that I need not say what I do. She is dead,
messieurs. If I could bring her back to life by giving mine, even
by suffering those horrible tortures, I would do so. But I can do
nothing now. I knew every turn of her mind in these six years, her
every change of mood. No one knows better than I her strange power
of shifting from anger to generosity, from disdain to kindness. I
have not said a word that was disrespectful or untrue. I do not
defend myself. I have only tried to make things clear."</p>

<p>The second examination of Mademoiselle Henriette
Deluzy-Desportes was over. They led her back to her room in the
Conciergerie.</p>

<p>By that evening of the 23rd of August the rumours concerning the
Duc de Praslin's condition had grown alarming, though Henriette was
ignorant of them. Across the river in the prison of the Luxembourg
it was plain to the doctors that they could do nothing to combat
the poison that was steadily gaining possession of their patient.
The Duc de Praslin was dying. Only his superb strength had kept him
alive with all that arsenic in his system. They agreed among
themselves that he must have taken enough to kill half a dozen men,
judging by the tortures he suffered. A smaller dose would have
proved fatal within a few hours, but the amount he had managed to
consume some time during the day he had been taken into custody was
so powerful that he had all but defeated his own end. For nature
had reacted to the poison instead of being immediately overcome by
it.</p>

<p>He had borne his sufferings at first with stoical indifference,
but as the agony increased his half-suppressed groans were terrible
to hear. These and the convulsions that shook him at intervals
were, however, the only signs he gave to those gathered about his
bed.</p>

<p>He had already been questioned, first by the police on the
morning of the crime and later by Chancellor Pasquier. The latter
had urged him to make full confession, but he had persisted in his
denials. From first to last he had clung to the same story,
insisting that he had been awakened by shrieks and had hurried to
his wife's bedroom. In the horror and confusion that ensued he
could give no clear account of himself and his actions. The
bloodstains on his robe and shirt must have come there when he had
taken the dying Duchesse in his arms; the pistol found near her was
his; he had caught it up when he went to her aid. He could not
account for the blood and strands of hair upon it. Why had he tried
to wash away the bloodstains? To that question he answered that he
had done so because he did not wish to frighten his children by
such a sight. He made no effort to explain the burning papers in
his fireplace. A match must have been thrown there. How could he
remember what he had done at such a time, and under such stress? He
begged them to spare him further questions till to-morrow. He felt
too weak to answer.</p>

<p>But the Chancellor had persisted. It would not take much of
Monsieur le Duc's breath to reply briefly "Yes" or "No" to the
charges. What about those marks on his hands? The scratches, he
explained, he had suffered in the country when he had helped to
pack the trunks and boxes for their journey. And the bites? They
were not bites. The doctors said otherwise. Well, he could not
answer for the doctors, and he felt too weakened to be pressed for
details.</p>

<p>"You are always speaking of your weakness, Monsieur de Praslin.
No wonder you feel so when you think of your children and of this
horrible crime you have committed."</p>

<p>"Crime!" The Duc had roused himself a little. "I have committed
no crime. As to the children, they are always in my thoughts."</p>

<p>He had buried his head in his hands and remained silent for some
time.</p>

<p>"Were you urged to this act by evil counsel?" His questioner
hoped to draw him out in this way, but the prisoner could not be
forced into any mention of Mademoiselle Deluzy. His stubborn
denials of all part in the murder continued.</p>

<p>"I have had no counsel. People do not counsel such things."</p>

<p>"You are being devoured by remorse. Would it not ease your
conscience if you told the truth?"</p>

<p>Again the evasive plea: "My strength fails me to-day."</p>

<p>"Do you dare to affirm that you have not committed this crime?"
Again no response, and again the questions was repeated.</p>

<p>"Your silence gives the answer for you," the Chancellor
continued.</p>

<p>"You are guilty. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"You have come here with a conviction of my guilt. Nothing I
might say could change your opinion."</p>

<p>"You can do so if you will give me a reason to believe
otherwise. Without further explanations we can only hold you
responsible."</p>

<p>"I tell you I am not able to go on. It is beyond my
strength."</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Praslin, you are in a state of torture; and, as I
said to you just now, a simple answer is all I ask of you. Are you
or are you not responsible for this murder? Answer yes or no."</p>

<p>"I cannot reply to such a question."</p>

<p>Once more the Duc took refuge in silence which he steadily
maintained to the last. The doctors marvelled at his vitality. They
did what they could to relieve his pangs, but they had been
forbidden to administer opiates. He must not be allowed to lapse
into unconsciousness while there was still a chance to bring him to
a confession of his guilt.</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, August 24th, at five o'clock, the Duc de
Praslin drew his last breath in the prison of the Luxembourg, just
seven days after his arrest. His death and burial were attended
with secrecy, and the news kept from the public as long as
possible. Of this event Victor Hugo noted:</p>

<blockquote>It would appear that Monsieur de Praslin was a very
well made man. At the post-mortem the doctors were much struck. One
exclaimed, "What a beautiful corpse!" He was a fine athlete, Dr.
Louis tells me...The tomb in which they laid him bears a leaden
plate, on which is the number 1054. A number after his death, as
convicts have in life, is the only epitaph of the Duc de
Choiseul-Praslin.</blockquote>

<p>But others were less restrained in their comment. Once
published, the news spread rapidly, and public opinion was united
in condemning the government for such negligence. All officials,
from gendarmes to King Louis-Philippe himself, suffered severe
censure. The murder had been shocking enough without allowing the
obvious culprit to escape from the consequences. Suicide was too
easy a way out for such a criminal. The law should have exacted the
extreme penalty for this deed, and instead it had been cheated of
its victim. Everywhere people grew hot with indignation against a
government that had condoned such evasion of justice.</p>

<p>It did not matter to readers of newspapers whether that dose of
arsenic had been deliberately smuggled in to the Duc by his
superiors, or if he had foreseen his own extremity and prepared for
it. One fact they all agreed upon&mdash;this prisoner had not met
the fate of an ordinary criminal. If he had not been a close friend
of the King, and a Peer of France, he would be alive to face the
grave charges against him.</p>

<p>What was the use now of all the detailed reports of the
examiners?</p>

<p>Of the carefully tabulated evidence prepared by the police? Of
the testimony of doctors and domestics?</p>

<p>There was no need now to fill columns of fine type with the
pitiful, passionate contents of the Duchesse's journal, or to print
those letters the Duc had not burned, anguished appeals for
affection that would never be gratified; jealous tirades against
"Mademoiselle D." Murdered and murderer were both mute. They could
not be called back to life to answer the questions of high
officials in red robes. The Praslin murder case had become a dead
issue as far as the law was concerned. It was only a skeleton now.
But skeletons in royal closets are not easily dismissed, as King
Louis-Philippe was to discover all too soon.</p>

<p>Across the Channel, a far-sighted editor in the London
<i>Times</i> wrote prophetically of <i>l'affaire Praslin:</i></p>

<blockquote>Nothing could be more contrary to the interests of the
Government than the scandal arising from such an act at the present
moment. It is more likely to exercise an unfavourable influence on
their fortunes than a systematic sapping and mining of the public
liberties for twenty years. The Government had but one chance: to
hand the Duc de Praslin over to the public indignation...We foresee
that this most injudicious withdrawal of a culprit from justice
will be turned against the French Government. We do not mean to
attribute any share to the leading people of Paris in this most
horrible and revolting crime. But it would be vain to deny that a
profound demoralisation does at this moment exist in the very heart
of French society. We will not pursue this subject of the suicide
of the Duc de Praslin. If the French Government have connived at
it, they will soon find cause to repent their error. It is not
probable that we have yet come to the end of this disastrous
tale.</blockquote>

<p>Henriette may have read these very words, for during those last
days of August she was allowed the privilege of newspapers. She
still remained in the Conciergerie, still took her exercise in the
courtyard each day, and still waited for the law to decide what to
do with her. It was a vexing problem. The most careful examinations
had revealed nothing that could be used as tangible evidence
against her. She had made a remarkable impression upon her
examiners during those hours of questioning. Yet the whole country
believed her to be a party to the crime. Next to the Duc de Praslin
she was most hated; and, now that he was dead, she alone remained,
the bird in their hands. From being an obscure governess without
friends and in search of work, she had become in the course of a
single week the most despised and talked-of figure in France.</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-Three</h3>

<p>Paris roofs were sleek with November rains. The river flowed in
sluggish grey under its bridges, and the tall old buildings on
either bank were as drab as the blowing smoke from their
chimneypots. The gardens of the Luxembourg and the Tuileries
dripped in duns and browns, their benches damp and deserted, even
by beggars and sparrows, those most indefatigable city tramps. Only
splashing horses and the vehicles they drew moved on the wet
streets, or sodden figures under the domes of umbrellas.</p>

<p>In an upper room of a house near the intersection of the Rues de
Monceau and T&eacute;h&eacute;ran, Henriette stared through a moist
windowpane at a still more moist world. The room was not much
larger than the Needle's Eye, though its furnishing showed far more
taste and comfort. A table had been drawn close to the window, and
a variety of objects littered it&mdash;books, sewing materials, a
pot of marigolds, a box of pastel crayons, besides writing
materials and a portfolio of papers. But her hands were not
occupied with any of these; they lay idle and listless in her
lap.</p>

<p>A maid tapped at the door and, in response to a "Come in,"
opened it a crack to deliver her message.</p>

<p>"Madame Monod's compliments, and would Mademoiselle Desportes
care to join Monsieur and Madame in the salon for a cup of
chocolate?"</p>

<p>But Henriette shook her head. "My thanks to Madame and Monsieur,
but my headache still prevents my joining them, and I will not be
down for dinner."</p>

<p>After the maid had left, Henriette sat without moving while the
rain kept up its monotonous drumming in the gutters outside. She
had no headache, but one must give some excuse for refusing the
kindness of friends. She was under enough obligation to the
Reverend Frederic Monod and his wife without appearing indifferent
to their efforts to distract her from the lethargy which she could
not shake off. They had been goodness itself, those two, insisting
that she make her home with them as long as she cared to stay in
Paris. That September day when she had been given her discharge by
the law they had made her welcome, and she had been glad to take
refuge in this shelter they offered. There had been no other choice
except to go to Albert and Marie, for she could not return to
Madame Le Maire's establishment, and after the notoriety of the
murder no hotel or pension would have dared to take her in. Her
grandfather had made no effort to aid her, and she learned from
those who had tried to enlist his sympathies that the old man's
health and finances were in a precarious state. He lived near
Passy, completely under the domination of an unscrupulous old
woman. So she could not look to her only relative for help in the
difficulties she now faced.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Monsieur Monod had taken her and her cause
to heart. He was a powerful and prosperous ally as well as his two
brothers, one a wealthy merchant of Havre. The other, Adolphe, was
also an influential Protestant divine who had lately been called to
preach at the Oratoire in Paris. The brothers Monod not only
believed in her innocence and admired the courage with which she
had met her ordeal, but they were determined to rally their
congregations to her side. Her Protestant faith had been against
her in that Catholic household, and the murder now had taken on
religious as well as political significance. In a Catholic country
like France it was inevitable that this should be so. The Monods
knew that even' among the minority which their church represented
prejudice against her would be difficult to overcome. All they
could do for her now was to give her their support and hope that
they could influence others of their faith to do likewise. They
knew the violence of public opinion too well to expect it to be
changed overnight. That would take months, even years, to
alter.</p>

<p>Everywhere people branded Mademoiselle Deluzy-Desportes as the
real instigator of the Praslin murder. Since her release she had
become the target of a more intense and bitter hatred because she
was the only living link in that triangle of domestic tragedy. The
press and public still believed her guilty and would have relished
nothing more than to see her go to the guillotine. In her discharge
they saw only another example of legal incompetence and
governmental procrastination. Already the Duchesse de Praslin wore
a martyr's halo and was mourned as the victim of a husband's
infatuation for a clever and scheming rival. Everywhere wives and
mothers denounced this "Mademoiselle D." and praised the dead
Duchesse as a paragon of virtue, whose only fault had been to love
her husband and children too well. "Let the women of France lay
hands on this governess," was the hue and cry in streets and shops
and homes, "and then she would soon see how we feel about her. All
those fine speeches of hers to the lawyers and Chancellor would be
wasted on us. Let her suffer as she made another suffer. She has no
right to go free!"</p>

<p>It was essential that her whereabouts be kept secret; so only
her few friends knew her hiding-place. She must not go out alone
for fear of recognition and the consequences that might follow. She
must use an assumed name if she ventured beyond that loyal
household. Although the subject of future plans had been carefully
avoided so far, it was plain to all that when she was able to
resume her old occupation of teaching she could not do so in
France, where the ghost of scandal would always follow her from
post to post. She would never be free of it. A spying glance, a
whispered word, an awkward question, and that shadow would fall
upon her. She knew how it would be, though as yet she dared not
speak of that to her generous hosts.</p>

<p>No, her head did not ache. She was past all physical pain. All
feeling had left her; she was held fast in the grip of inertia.
Once she had had courage to live and feel, once she had even had
courage enough to die. But now life or death seemed immaterial. She
continued to breathe; to wake and sleep; to eat and drink what was
set before her; to go through the mechanical gestures of the
living&mdash;that was all. Whatever was put into her hands to do,
she did with her old skill and efficiency. She helped about the
house&mdash;sewing, dusting, copying sermons and letters for
Monsieur Monod, hearing his children's lessons. She was glad to
make herself useful so long as nothing more was asked of her.</p>

<p>She could even read those newspaper accounts of the Praslin case
without flinching. They seemed not to concern her now, though the
faces of the Duc and Duchesse, of the old Mar&eacute;chal and each
of the children were as clear as if they still moved about her.
Even now, nearly three months after that morning of August 18th,
the ashes of that tragedy were being raked over and sifted by the
press. She could scarcely pick up a paper without finding some
reference to herself and the investigation, and already legends
were springing up. Workmen making repairs on the Duc's apartments
in the ch&acirc;teau had discovered a fancy-dress costume stuffed
behind a loose piece of moulding, a scarlet devil's suit the Duc
had worn to a masquerade. The Duchesse's maid had then recalled a
dream her mistress had had earlier that summer. Madame had told her
of it and of the frightening apparition of a devil all in red who
had stood threateningly above her bed. She had screamed, and it had
vanished. They had given the matter no further thought. But now it
took on a sinister significance. Surely so macabre a premonition
was more than a mere dream of the Duchesse. There were stories from
Corsica of a gipsy warning that mentioned danger and blood, and as
a bride Fanny S&eacute;bastiani had dared to wear pearls, defying
the superstition that each pearl will mean tears shed in bitterness
and grief later on. Henriette read these fantastic stories unmoved
as she read the dead woman's frenzied and pitiful outpourings in
her published letters and journal:</p>

<blockquote>Do not be astonished, my dear Th&eacute;obald, at my
fear of being alone with you. We are separated for ever&mdash;you
said so; a sad reflection that will ever be attached to
yesterday...<br>
<br>
Wherefore, my beloved, do you refuse to let me share your
confidences? You deprive our life of all the charms of
affection....Do you deliberately wish to become a stranger to
me?...You alone know that it is in your power to console me, yet
you withhold your consolation...I only wish to share completely
your life, to embellish it, and to pour balm upon your wounds...I
will blindly obey you. I will no longer torment you by
jealousy.<br>
<br>
You have deprived me of my children, and placed them in the care of
a stranger who has usurped my place in your house...It is long
since I have written, and my position has since become more and
more painful...Mademoiselle D. reigns absolute. Never was a
governess seen to assume so scandalous a position. It is impossible
to believe that this is only a friendly intimacy between a man of
your age and a young woman in her position. What an example to give
to young persons!<br>
<br>
When I reached here I had hoped for peace, but the illusion did not
last long. The carriage steps had not been let down before I saw in
your icy, discontented air, in the constrained expression of the
children's faces, in those green eyes which appeared behind your
shoulder, that I was about to be subjected to the most painful
humiliation...Mademoiselle D. must remain at all cost...But why do
you, who believe it so simple, so easy to replace a mother, think
it so impossible to replace a governess? If you had desired it, she
might have been a good governess, but you have changed her
functions, her position...How is it possible that her head should
not be turned when your conduct says to her every day, even more
clearly than words: "I have a wife, but I prefer your society, your
attentions."...Through love for you I was weak enough to surrender
the children to your care, and I have been betrayed. I ought to
have died sooner than to have made this sacrifice...You have
established a complete separation between us&mdash;we are no more
than strangers to each other. Things cannot endure in their present
state...you are weak, and you have reached a point where you are so
much under her yoke that you dare undertake nothing without her.
You cannot leave her; and your wife, the mother of your children,
must live and die alone...<br>
<br>
Why will you not read my letters? Why will you not at least accord
me your confidence or some explanation? You have too plainly shown
that you no longer love me, that you wish all relations to cease
between us...<br>
<br>
You have a rare and precious talent for poisoning everything. While
your conduct only affected my happiness, I kept silence. But you
cannot force me to approve in public or in private the conduct of a
person I despise. I know well enough that you have not always been
faithful, and that it is not solely with her that your life is
occupied. But she assumes the attitude. It is this which I have the
right to blame. I cannot interfere in your private conduct and
affections, but no threats or ill-treatment can prevent my
repeating, what I have a right to do, that you deceive yourself by
putting your children into the hands of a woman who has no regard
for her reputation, since she has ceased to respect herself...<br>
<br>
If you knew what I suffer, my beloved, by your coldness towards
me&mdash;I cannot believe that you wish to abandon me thus for
ever, to deprive us both of our happiness. Life is so short, my
beloved, and we have been separated already so long. Soon I shall
not dare to make these pleas&mdash;always refused, like my
caresses...Your wife will die of grief unless you return. Return,
return to her!&mdash;My pillow is wet with bitter
tears.</blockquote>

<p>Strange to read the broken phrases, the denunciations of
herself, the demands that would never be gratified now. Strange to
know that the hand that had penned them would never be warm with
love or hate again. Light was fading fast in the upper room. The
words of the long columns of newspaper print grew dim before her
eyes. Yet still she must read the words&mdash;her own replies to
the questions of the judges; the Duc's last testimony; and letter
upon letter of the Duchesse. She could feel nothing as she read
those wild and bitter words, though behind the type she could see
clearly that familiar blue note-paper with its family crest and the
heavy, flowing pen strokes she had come to know and dread in the
last six years. She remembered so well the first note that had been
addressed to her. She remembered how shocked she had been by the
discarded one from which Raynald's scissors had snipped a heart.
She had felt guilty then to have such intimate revelations put into
her hands, and now the whole world was reading them.</p>

<p>A knock sounded on the door. The rap was loud, but it came from
lower down than usual, just the height of a child's reach. She put
the papers away and turned to greet ten-year-old Th&eacute;odore
Monod. He carried a bird-cage in one hand.</p>

<p>"I've brought my goldfinch to keep you company," he announced,
setting the cage carefully on the table. "I'm sorry your head
aches."</p>

<p>After she had thanked him for the loan of his bird, the boy
stayed on, eyeing her in timid fascination.</p>

<p>"You should put cologne on your forehead," he told her. "I can
get you some of Mamma's. I know where she keeps it."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Th&eacute;odore, it's not that kind of headache
cologne would help. How did you get on at school to-day?"</p>

<p>Even in her state of apathy it was natural for her to take an
interest in the child, who was only too eager to respond. He and
his older sister had already fallen under her spell, though they
had received strict orders not to disturb their guest.</p>

<p>"I did all my arithmetic right," he assured her, "and the
Professor read my composition about the shells to the class, the
one you helped me with. But I failed in my Latin. The plural case
is so hard. I had to stay after the rest and write <i>Exeunt
omnes</i> a hundred times. Do you know what that means,
Mademoiselle Desportes?"</p>

<p>"'They all go out,'" she translated. Then she turned from him
with a catch of her breath. "Yes, I know what that means."</p>

<p>Presently Monsieur Monod himself appeared, and Th&eacute;odore
was sent downstairs.</p>

<p>"I thought I should find him here." Her host lingered after his
son had gone. "You draw our young people like flies to a honeypot,
but you mustn't let them impose upon you. My wife and I are sorry
to hear you have another of these headaches. We had hoped we could
count upon you to help us to-night."</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"You've not forgotten we are giving a small reception?"</p>

<p>She had forgotten, and the mention of it only made her shake her
head and beg leave to stay upstairs.</p>

<p>"No one is coming who might annoy you," Monsieur Monod
persisted, studying her with anxious intentness in the failing
light. "A few friends besides my brother Adolphe and his family. My
niece has promised to sing, and we though perhaps you might be
willing to accompany her on the piano."</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur Monod, do not ask me to move among people yet.
It's too much for me."</p>

<p>He sighed and laid his hand persuasively on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"The longer you postpone it, the harder it will be. You can't
shut yourself away from people for ever, you know. I realise it
must be gradual, but you will not be subject to the curious
to-night. These are friends who sympathise with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's it," she broke in. "I can't face their sympathy
yet."</p>

<p>"You must, my dear Henriette; you have need of all that is
offered you. You were so brave during your ordeal, you can't afford
to lose your courage now that's over."</p>

<p>"I spent all I had," she told him. "I've no more courage in
me."</p>

<p>"You underestimate yourself. I've come to ask you as a favour to
me, to join us and our guests this evening."</p>

<p>"I can hardly refuse when you put it so. I'm under too great
obligation to you and Madame Monod. But I wish I might be
spared."</p>

<p>"If you want to leave after the music, we shall understand; but
I hope you will feel like staying longer. There will be several
Americans, and you know their usual difficulties with the language.
Your English is so excellent, it would be a comfort to rely on you
to act as interpreter. The chances are, they will have no idea of
your identity, and I shall not mention your name; so there is no
need for you to dread introductions."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Monsieur Monod, you don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you will do your best." He smiled encouragingly.
"Remember, it's no time to retreat when the battle's won."</p>

<p>At the door he turned and spoke again.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy does not concern us now. She
belongs to the past. But I have great hopes for a certain
Mademoiselle Desportes."</p>

<p>When he had gone she sat a long time in the gathering darkness
before she forced herself to light a lamp and lay out her clothes
for the evening. She dreaded going to the wardrobe and bureau
drawers, where each article she handled kept some painful
association. Memories clung to every fold and mocked her as she
shook them out. Her linen still smelled of vervain from the
ch&acirc;teau gardens. There was not a dress she owned which did
not recall some remark of Louise or Berthe or Raynald, or the
approving glances of their father. In the little white jewellery
box with the carnelian-studded lid lay the bracelet and blue enamel
pin which had been peace offerings from the Duchesse. The cameo
brooch of Raynald's choosing was there, too, with all its poignant
memories. It had been mounted according to his own ideas, with his
name and the date of his birthday engraved on the gold back.</p>

<p>She turned it over and stared at those letters in the lamplight:
"Raynald, June 18, 1847." But even that failed to melt the ice at
her heart. She moved in numbness to the wardrobe and selected her
best dress, the moss-green moire with bands of russet and small
bronze buttons that matched the slippers she took from their
tissue-paper wrappings. How Louise had delighted in those bronze
slippers the day she had borrowed them to dance the polka up and
down the old schoolroom! How gaily she had danced! And now, where
were those quick, light feet? Were all those Praslin daughters
dressed in mourning? Were the clear eyes red with weeping shocked,
incredulous tears, or clouded with dumb bewilderment? What of
Berthe, with her father's ways and hair and smile? What of Raynald,
sensitive and loving, who had shared his own birthday with
mademoiselle? She would never know how they fared. She would never
see them again. Better so, perhaps, since by now their minds and
hearts must be poisoned against her. No, she could not have met
disillusionment in those young eyes that had always turned to her
in love and trust.</p>

<p><i>"Exeunt omnes</i>," she thought bitterly as she made her
preparations.</p>

<p>It was half-past nine when she entered the large, old-fashioned
salon where some eighteen or twenty guests had already gathered.
She slipped in unobtrusively through the adjoining study and joined
her host's brother Adolphe and others whom she knew slightly. As
she stood there, speaking of she scarcely knew what, she caught
sight of herself in a long mirror and marvelled that she should
look much as she had looked when she had last worn the green moire
six months before. She appeared somewhat paler and thinner, and her
face had fallen into graver lines. But these were the only outward
changes she could find. Her hair still curled and shone on either
side of its parting. Her brow was as smooth and unlined, her mouth
wide and full-lipped as ever. How, she wondered, could it be that
she bore no visible signs of inner blight?</p>

<p>People were being kind&mdash;far too kind, she decided after
half an hour had passed. Their determined efforts to be casual
embarrassed her more than all the curious scrutiny she had been
subjected to in the Conciergerie. Those she knew greeted her
cordially, but pointedly refrained from addressing her by name.
They talked rapidly of the most inconsequential matters, and
carefully avoided looking her full in the face. She understood the
reason for their feigned indifference. She had often tried in the
same fashion to disregard the sightless eye or scarred cheek of
another. Never, she vowed to herself in the crowded room, would she
be guilty of such obvious kindness again. Better to peer curiously
at crippled infirmity or disfigured flesh; better the frank stare,
than the polite, surreptitious glance.</p>

<p>It was a relief to turn her attention to the piano and the
sheets of music spread in readiness on the rack. Fortunately the
airs were familiar, since Madame Monod had lately prevailed upon
her to play many of them for herself and her daughters. The young
singer had a sweet, fresh voice; and her manners were childlike and
modest. She had not pretensions to soar to the heights of the
Swedish nightingale, who had taken Europe by storm. She knew she
was no future Jenny Lind, so she contented herself with pleasing
her family and their friends and keeping on pitch without
spectacular tremolos and trills. Henriette took her place on the
bench grateful that the piano was placed so that her back was to
the room which the singer faced. As her eyes followed the notes and
her fingers moved over the keys, she forgot for a little the
constraint that her presence had brought to that roomful of
people.</p>

<p>She had planned to make her escape after the musical interlude,
but escape from the crowded room was not easy. More people had
arrived. She recognised one group, standing a little apart, as the
guests from America. There were five of them, two women and three
men, less stylishly dressed and assured of manner than their
countrymen one saw in shops and on the boulevards. She knew she
ought to join them and try to put them at their ease. But somehow,
to-night, she did not feel equal to making an effort for these
strangers. She felt even a sudden resentment that they should be
there at all. Why hadn't they stayed on the side of the Atlantic
where they belonged? Why must they come here in their queer-looking
clothes, butchering the English language, probably, in their even
queerer voices?</p>

<p>She wished they did not look so much like a flock of uneasy,
disappointed birds of a feather, huddled on some alien bough. And
then, without warning, one of them left the bough. He hurried
towards her, his face beaming with frank, pleased curiosity, his
eyes looking straight into her own with a sudden light of
recognition. She tried to turn away, but even if there had been
room to pass the groups of people, something about the eagerness in
those eyes held her where she stood. She felt annoyed and furious
and yet at the same time compelled to notice this young American
who advanced upon her. She did not encourage him by so much as a
flicker of an eyelash, but he still hurried on, a small,
inconspicuous figure charged with excitement that fairly bristled
under a poorly fitted coat the colour of snuff. Now he was speaking
at her elbow in a voice that surprised her by not being the nasal,
high-pitched twang she had come to associate with Yankee
visitors.</p>

<p>"You are Mademoiselle Deluzy&mdash;Desportes," he began without
preliminaries. "I should have known you anywhere, even without the
bonnet with the lilac trimmings."</p>

<p>Earlier that evening she had felt embarrassed by the tactful
restraint of her acquaintances; now she was experiencing the blunt
frankness of an unknown young man. He could be hardly more than
some student, to judge from his looks. Still he was old enough to
know better. One expected a certain amount of crudity from
Americans, but such blundering as this was too much to
overlook.</p>

<p>"I see," she responded crisply, "that you read the
newspapers."</p>

<p>Her shoulders lifted in a slight shrug, and there was an ironic
edge to her words. But her disapproval made no impression on
him.</p>

<p>He continued to fix her intently with his candid blue eyes,
oblivious to every one else in the room.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I do read the newspapers," he admitted, and a sudden
disarming smile transformed the plainness of his face. "I can read
French better than I'll ever be able to speak it, I'm afraid. The
papers were full of you. I read every word; but they never told me
all I wanted to know. You see, ever since I landed in
France&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was preposterous! She would really have to snub him, even
if he were an invited guest. She frowned and cut short the eager
rush of words on his lips.</p>

<p>"It's quite unnecessary to explain that you've heard of nothing
but the Praslin case since you came. Probably you know far more
than I do about it."</p>

<p>"I know that you have been brave and steadfast under great
misfortune; that you met their attacks with honesty and eloquence.
Is it any wonder then, that you have&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Please!" Again she cut him short. "Please don't say anything
more. And now, if you will excuse me, I was just on the point of
leaving."</p>

<p>But he did not stand aside politely. He actually came a step
nearer to block her path of escape.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you can't do that now!" he went on, unaware that he had
been dismissed. "I was going to tell you that, ever since I landed,
you have been so much on my mind."</p>

<p>"On <i>your</i> mind, monsieur&mdash;"</p>

<p>He nodded an emphatic assent.</p>

<p>"I confess"&mdash;she forestalled another rush of impetuous
words, and went on quickly&mdash;"I confess I see no reason why I
should have been there. Haven't you Americans troubles enough of
your own without crossing the sea to hunt down more?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed simply, again ignoring her bitterness, "we have
troubles of our own, as you say, but yours happen to be very
important to me. That's why, when I saw you in the Conciergerie
courtyard, and now to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You couldn't resist satisfying your curiosity still further!
You thought a few questions more or less wouldn't matter after all
those I've had flung at me!"</p>

<p>She managed to keep her voice chill as an icicle, but she felt
her cheeks flush in angry betrayal.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said, "if I have made you think that. I hoped
when I heard you speak such fluent English that it would be easy to
make myself clear. But that's difficult sometimes in any language.
My trade is in words, you see; so that's why I know they can't
always be depended upon to say what we feel."</p>

<p>"You are a writer then?"</p>

<p>She might have guessed there was some such reason behind his
persistence. A young newspaper man from America&mdash;probably he
had been sending back reports of the investigation. Perhaps he
meant to write the story of her life with embellishments of his
own. The sooner she put a stop to that, the better.</p>

<p>"Only in a way," he was explaining. "I do write articles
sometimes when I have time between my sermons."</p>

<p>"Sermons?" It was her turn to stare curiously at the boyish face
looking into hers. "You are a minister! But, no, you can't be!"</p>

<p>"But I am," he insisted with another smile. "It's not necessary
to look like an Old Testament prophet to preach the Gospel, is
it?"</p>

<p>"No," she was forced to admit. "I suppose there must be all
kinds, only I never happened to meet a minister like you."</p>

<p>"And I have never met any one like you&mdash;so there we
are."</p>

<p>"You really preach sermons from a pulpit," she repeated, eyeing
him half amused, half admiring. "It's hard to believe that. You
look too young."</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-five," he told her, "and I've been preaching off and
on for ten years."</p>

<p>"Oh, so they let children preach in America?"</p>

<p>"I was fifteen," he explained patiently, "half-way through
college. My father is a minister, too, so I suppose it comes
naturally. But"&mdash;he turned to her again with that swift
smile&mdash;"I'll never forget that first experience. It was a
little country church where students were often sent to
preach."</p>

<p>"And what was the subject of your sermon?"</p>

<p>"On Christ throwing out the money-changers from the Temple. I
thought when I saw my congregation of farmers and their families
that perhaps I hadn't made a very wise choice. But they didn't seem
to mind about that, or my not having a robe. You see," he went on
confidentially, "my family were very poor, and I usually wore one
of my brothers' coats, and they are all much bigger than I. A
cut-down roundabout hardly made me look impressive when I mounted
to that pulpit. It didn't seem so difficult at the time, but that
first sermon did age me. I know, because I had to pay full railway
fare on the trip back, and they had let me ride for half-fare
before!"</p>

<p>He looked so rueful over this early plight that she had to laugh
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, studying her with even more pleased intentness
than before, "I thought you would look like that when you
smiled."</p>

<p>She made no reply, and he did not seem to expect one. Other
people jostled at their elbows, or brushed by them with billowing
skirts, but they stood quiet together as if they had made an island
for themselves in some hurrying human stream.</p>

<p>Then it caught them up and whirled them apart once more. Marie
and Albert Remey seized upon her, and presently she must go to help
Madame Monod serve refreshments in the adjoining room. For the next
hour Henriette had no chance to talk with the American, though she
saw him now and again, watching her with that air of intimate
expectancy which was so strangely disturbing. She wished that he
would leave, as others were doing, but he lingered on, a small,
determined figure on the fringes of animated groups of men and
women. His quietness made him conspicuous by contrast, although he
had so little physical presence to boast of. Perhaps the fact that
he did not gesticulate when he spoke gave him a kind of dignity.
Yet it was more than just that, she decided. At close range one
might be deceived by plain features, a too na&iuml;ve eagerness of
manner, or by the queer cut of foreign clothes. But at a distance
he assumed his real proportions, as a certain mountain peak that
has been indistinguishable among others will rise when viewed in
its true perspective. The artist in her recognised this, and the
woman in her felt his integrity. He stood out in that gathering,
not only because of a racial difference, but because of some inner
simplicity and sureness of purpose which possessed him so
completely that he was himself unaware of the power.</p>

<p>"No wonder," she thought, smiling at the memory of his
confession, "no wonder that first congregation of his did not dare
to laugh."</p>

<p>She felt a touch of remorse, remembering how hostile she had
been towards him, mistaking his honesty for crudeness, confusing
his enthusiasm with effrontery. She need not have behaved so
rudely, trying to snap his head off simply because her own nerves
were on edge. But, then, she was not used to the headlong
exuberance of visitors from America who could be almost indecently
personal at first meeting.</p>

<p>The company was thinning out rapidly. She would be able to slip
upstairs to her room without much notice now. But there he was
coming towards her again with that confident, bright look. She was
sure he would outstay all the guests, for he seemed completely
unaware of time, despite the gold watchchain that flapped on his
vest.</p>

<p>"Now we can talk," he began almost before he had reached her
side. "I was growing impatient. You were so busy. Now tell
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But first you must tell me something, monsieur&mdash;your
name."</p>

<p>"Field," he said, "and you'll find my first one
simple&mdash;Henry. Then Martyn in the middle."</p>

<p>"Henri," she repeated, "Henri, then Martyn in the
middle&mdash;Field."</p>

<p>"They never made it sound like that at home," he told her
admiringly. "They would call you Henrietta over there."</p>

<p>("Field," she thought, "I might have known it would be a short,
plain name like that. But it fits him&mdash;simple and
unpretentious, and yet full of living importance.")</p>

<p>"I like your name, Monsieur Field," she heard herself saying.
"It seems right for you."</p>

<p>"It's one of the few things any father thinks his sons should be
proud of," he told her. "We're a fair-sized family," he added. "I
have two sisters and six brothers."</p>

<p>"Whose clothes you sometimes wear," she prompted.</p>

<p>"Not since I left Williams College." He laughed. "Yes, that's
the penalty of being the youngest and smallest son. I'll tell you
how our family goes: David Dudley, Emilia Ann, Timothy Beals,
Matthew Dickinson, Jonathan Edwards, Stephen Johnson, Cyrus West,
Henry Martyn, and Mary Elizabeth."</p>

<p>He had to pause for breath.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me any more names," she begged. "Henri Martyn is all
I can remember to-night."</p>

<p>"I shall be writing them about you," he went on, "by the next
mail packet."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, please!" she began, but she could not finish because
the two Monod brothers joined them.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you brought me that letter of introduction." Adolphe
Monod spoke cordially to their guest. "We should have missed having
you with us to-night."</p>

<p>"I would 'not have missed to-night for all the rest of my stay
put together, and I've been in England and Scotland, too."</p>

<p>"And you're off to. Brussels in the morning, I hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and then on to Germany and Austria, and perhaps as far as
St. Petersburg if my money holds out. I've been saving for this
these last five years."</p>

<p>"What globe-trotters you Americans seem to be!"
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod smiled wonderingly and shook his head.
"He must have been born with an itching foot. Don't you think so,
Henriette?"</p>

<p>"He must indeed," she agreed. "I have often wondered, when I've
seen tourists tramping about and looking so tired and
uncomfortable, whatever made them come so far."</p>

<p>"You should be able to answer that question for her, Monsieur
Field."</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way, I think. "He grew suddenly serious and
pushed back a straight brown lock of hair that had fallen into his
eyes. "For most of us one book is not enough to satisfy our minds,
and so one life is not enough either. We want to experience more
than can ever be crowded into seventy or eighty years. I am too
greedy, perhaps, but I want to catch at the meaning of different
lives in different places. I want to find out what goes on under
the thatched roofs of cottages and behind the walls of palaces and
hotels. I want to walk in old ruins and in new cities. I want to
watch people everywhere, whether I can understand the words they
are saying or not. It is too much to ask, perhaps, but I want to
get behind the faces of men and women and feel what they are
feeling." He broke off with a sigh. "Do you understand what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Henriette spoke before either of the men had a chance to
answer. "You've made me understand."</p>

<p>"Some day you must put that all in a book, for those who travel
and those who stay at home." Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod spoke
with approval.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur Field," his brother Adolphe joined in. "You have
a true passion for travel, so let us hope you will go far, in more
ways than one."</p>

<p>As their visitor turned to leave with the last guests, Henriette
held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"I wish you a fortunate journey," she said, "and a safe return.
Good-night."</p>

<p>After he had gone the brothers Monod spoke of him to Henriette.
A most extraordinary young man, even for an American, they all
decided. Perhaps a trifle too eager, but with a good heart and high
intelligence. The letters he had presented from friends across the
Atlantic all praised his mind and character. They said he was
considered a brilliant scholar, a particularly fine student of
Greek and Hebrew and philosophy, and that he showed unusual promise
in the ministry. His family were of the best Puritan stock,
although he certainly had nothing of Puritan coldness and
constraint in his make-up. Yes, when one became used to his
na&iuml;ve frankness of manner, one realised that he had a fine
mind and largeness of sympathy, even a rough-hewn sort of
charm&mdash;didn't Henriette agree? At all events she had been most
kind to devote herself to putting him at his ease. They thanked her
for the effort she had made, and hoped it had not been too
tiring.</p>

<p>As she climbed the stairs to her room she remembered the
unabashed admiration in the eyes of the little American. She had
aroused his ardour and idealism, and such was the power of his
belief that her sense of futility lifted a little. All these last
weeks she had tried to hide behind a wall of her own making, to
shut herself away where nothing could ever hurt her again as she
had been hurt. Others had respected her wall; even the considerate
Monods had only rapped there discreetly. But he had known better.
Walls were something to be scaled, and he had leaped over hers in a
single bound.</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-four</h3>

<p>In the crowding political events of that winter of 1847 and 1848
Henriette attached little significance to the Monod reception; yet
it marked a distinct transition in her life.</p>

<p>She began to feel once more and to suffer as her numbed senses
thawed. Shock and disaster had till then overwhelmed her almost
completely; but as strength returns to paralysed limbs with sharp
pin-pricks of pain, so even more cruel stabbings troubled her mind.
Whether she woke or slept, she was beset by memories the more
bitter because they had once been sweet. Everywhere they assailed
her, whether she handled personal possessions or turned some street
corner that brought her face to face with the past. Without
warning, ghosts would rise up from the very pavement to confound
her. A fiddler's tune, a shop window, a playbill announcing the
great Rachel's coming performances, the smell of roasting apples,
the fragrance of a man's cigar, children with eyes shining above
parcel-filled arms, children singing carols, Notre Dame seen dimly
through falling snow&mdash;she was at the mercy of them all.</p>

<p>Some chance remark of Th&eacute;odore Monod or his sisters could
make her eyes film suddenly or her lips stiffen as the screws of
memory tightened at her heart. A man's tall figure swinging towards
her with the long vigorous strides she had come to connect with the
Duc could keep her trembling long after he had passed. Night after
night she dreamed that he was alive. It was all a
mistake&mdash;this horror of blood and violence and disgrace that
had seemed so real. Then she would wake and truth would strip her
of this brief comfort. She must lie chill and alone, rehearsing the
tragedy against her will, ruthlessly recalling every step that had
led to disaster.</p>

<blockquote>He is dead and gone, lady,<br>
He is dead and gone.</blockquote>

<p>What was the rest of the song? She racked her brain to remember.
At last it came:</p>

<blockquote>At his head a grass-green turf,<br>
At his heels a stone.</blockquote>

<p>But, no, even that had been denied him. Somewhere he had been
laid away in secret shame. They had not dared to put his name above
that spot.</p>

<p>She alone out of all the world did not hate or revile him. "We
can only judge another," she thought, "as that person affects us."
Whatever had been his passion and weakness, he had never meant to
hurt her. Since the day of their first meeting he had shown her
only the best in himself. It was his right to ask that she remember
him so. He had been loyal and generous to her always, and nothing
should mar that memory.</p>

<p>"I play a sorry part in all this." Those final words he had
spoken came back to her now, heavy with meaning.</p>

<p>Only God and she knew what lay behind that last futile act of
fury. She knew far less than God, but enough of the life that
husband and wife had lived to keep her from passing judgment. She
herself was alive. The law had freed her of those charges. But
would she ever be able to free herself of his presence when for six
years it had dominated her world? She would never know now what he
had felt for her. Perhaps it had been love, perhaps merely the need
for sympathy of which she had been the human symbol. They had asked
so little of each other, and yet that little had been too much. She
had not belonged to his world, or he to hers. Some fierce current
beyond their control had caught them up and swept them away to
certain destruction. Why had she not broken away before they
reached the precipice? Why had she not heard the thunder of the
rapids in time? That was what she could never answer through those
interminable nights and days.</p>

<p>"If I lose my reason some day," she heard him saying again
through the hot Corsican sunshine against the blue curtain of sea,
"you will know that scribbled words have driven me mad."</p>

<p>Calais&mdash;graven for ever on an English queen's heart;
Waterloo, on Napoleon's; and on hers, Praslin. Time might blur that
name as moss softens the inscription on old gravestones, but it had
been cut there too deeply to be erased.</p>

<p>The Monod brothers and their wives must have realised something
of her state of mind, for they did not press her to personal
confidences. They wisely refrained from advice giving, and kept her
occupied as much as possible. The hours of copying sermons, helping
with fine sewing and the children's lessons, reading aloud,
painting and practising served to fill part of the days. But her
returning energies cried out for better fare. She needed hard,
stimulating work as she had never needed it before, especially now
that the Christmas holidays were over and the dark, short days of
winter stretched bleakly ahead.</p>

<p>The Remeys did all in their power to distract her. She visited
them sometimes, though she could never enter those rooms without
fresh reminders of the tragedy which had touched all their lives.
Albert had secured a few scattered pupils, but times were bad for
such work; and he missed the security of his teaching post in the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;. Henriette knew this, and it troubled
her to see them anxiously counting every franc and sou. She saw
Madame Le Maire sometimes, and though the old woman had recovered
from her first hysterical denunciations on the morning of the
murder, their meetings were too full of unspoken thoughts to be
comfortable.</p>

<p>Of all the little group there was only one with whom Henriette
could talk or keep silence with complete ease. With old Pierre; the
porter, she found herself talking naturally, of what she could not
mention to others. He had the simple directness of those who work
with their hands, whose brains, uncluttered by learning, remain
clear and shrewd. The stubborn devotion of an ageing sheepdog
looked at her out of his eyes, and more than once she unburdened
her heart to him in a small caf&eacute; near the Rue du Harlay. It
was a cheap place, but the coffee was fresh and strong, and old
Pierre could leave his post for half an hour of an afternoon to
drink a cup with his favourite mademoiselle. "You're fretting
yourself to fiddle-strings," he would say, peering at her
disapprovingly over his lifted cup. "Didn't I tell you to get all
the sleep you could?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you told me, Pierre," she would admit, "but that's easier
said than done."</p>

<p>"I know, mademoiselle, it's hard when we have the black dog on
our backs."</p>

<p>"The black dog?"</p>

<p>"It's by way of saying everything troubles you. Yes, he sits
heavy on all our backs sometimes; but he will go away. By spring
you will forget he was ever there."</p>

<p>"But spring is a long way off, Pierre."</p>

<p>"My knees have told me that already," he would tell her, trying
to straighten out his stiff old joints. "But no matter, spring will
come, and it will bring you good things. I know it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pierre, what good can it bring after all that has happened.
You know there is nothing for me in Paris&mdash;or in France, for
that matter."</p>

<p>"Then you will have to travel across the water to find your good
fortune, mademoiselle&mdash;as far as America, maybe."</p>

<p>She set her cup down and stared at his seamed old face. He must
have read what was in her mind, though she had not spoken of it to
another person. She had indeed hardly been willing to consider the
idea consciously herself.</p>

<p>"Whatever put America into your head?" She tried to dismiss the
subject.</p>

<p>"Because it's the place for you to go," he insisted between
gulps of coffee. "There's trouble brewing in Paris. I can feel it,
the way I feel a spell of bad weather in my knees while the sun is
still shining. You'll see it won't be long."</p>

<p>Queer old fellow, she thought, croaking away like some rusty,
rheumatic crow.</p>

<p>"I too, should go to America," he continued. "Perhaps you will
send for me when you have grown rich over there."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I have no intention of going to America; and, if
I had, why should you want to go there?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm an old dog that would be willing to learn new tricks,
mademoiselle, new tricks in a new world&mdash;or perhaps even my
old ones will pass for new over there." He chuckled and dipped his
brioche in the syrup at the bottom of his cup. "Put the ocean
between yourself and this trouble you've had," he urged her. "Go
while you're still young."</p>

<p>"I'm not so young any more," she confessed, "and I'll carry my
trouble with me whether I go or stay."</p>

<p>But he shook his head as he rose to go.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing to eat your brown bread first," he said.
"Then you'll have plenty of white to look forward to. Don't forget
to save a crumb for me, mademoiselle. <i>Au revoir.</i> Madame has
no doubt been shouting herself hoarse for me these last ten
minutes."</p>

<p>She watched him hobble off towards the Rue du Harlay and sighed
at the folly of an old man's dreams of seeing a new world. But in
February old Pierre's predictions began to be shared by most of
Paris. Trouble and tension gathered in the air.</p>

<p>"Power," said B&eacute;ranger, "is a bell which prevents those
who set it pealing from hearing any other sound." So it was with
King Louis-Philippe and his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guizot.
The sound of that bell, whose clapper they had managed to keep in
motion so long, drowned out nearer and more ominous rumblings.
<i>"Enrichissez-vous,"</i> it cried out mechanically with Guizot's
own self-assured voice, but even his bourgeois supporters were
growing sceptical of the refrain. How could one grow rich under a
r&eacute;gime of government inertia and political corruption, with
steadily mounting taxes issued under the guise of false
prosperity?</p>

<p>The Praslin murder case was not a closed issue. A peer of France
had been allowed to evade justice, and that still rankled. It had
put the match to public indignation, and once the blaze was started
a score of other grievances caught fire. Few guessed, least of all
the complacent seventy-year-old monarch, how briskly the dead wood
that had held the Empire together would burn.</p>

<p>Rain had been falling for days; and a thick, smoky fog hung over
all Paris. It was the 22nd of February, and since early morning
streets had been either deserted or thronged with determined,
rain-soaked people. Th&eacute;odore Monod had been brought home
from school at midday in charge of an older student. He reported
that crowds had been thick about the Madeleine. Men in smocks and
old coats, beggars and gamins and women too had been waiting for
hours in the downpour, though no one seemed certain what they
wanted. Some had shouted, "Down with Guizot," and others had tried
to sing the Girondist refrain of defiance. There had even been a
bedraggled red flag or two hoisted above the heads, and one
particularly ragged figure had worn a placard with something about
the "right to work" in letters the rain had almost obliterated.</p>

<p>Monsieur Monod confirmed his son's report when he returned at
twilight.</p>

<p>"No one seems to know what is happening," he answered his wife's
anxious questions. "But there has been fighting in the Champs
Elys&eacute;es. The Municipal Guard has come out in full force. I
saw men burning benches in the streets and tearing down lamp-posts.
A man told me several shops had been looted. He said he saw one
stripped of firearms."</p>

<p>"Then it must be revolution." Henriette heard herself speaking
calmly, almost as if she were making some comment on the weather.
She did not realise the meaning of her words till she saw the
colour drain out of Madame Monod's cheeks and lips, till she saw
how that family drew instinctively closer together. Fear was in
their faces, and suddenly that word had become a reality to them
all.</p>

<p>Troops were encamped round bonfires in the streets that night.
Wet and shivering, the mobs scattered for shelter while the rain
continued to fall in torrents. The easy-going old King reassured
himself that the weather was on his side. The people of Paris, as
he remarked to his household, were not accustomed to making
revolutions in winter. But by another evening Louis-Philippe had
grown less smug. Those hours of falling rain did not dampen the
spirit of insurrection that charged all Paris. The crowds were
sullen and dogged. Companies of students marched through the
streets, denouncing Guizot with challenging cries: "<i>Vive la
r&eacute;forme!</i> Down with Guizot! <i>Vive la
R&eacute;publique!"</i></p>

<p>The ministers and officials of France heard the shouting and
waited tensely for Guizot to mount the rostrum and take his stand.
It was half-past one when he appeared, frail and precise and
looking, as a foreign visitor described him, "a cross between a
professor of French and an old actor." But he held his head high.
He kept his old impelling manner even though he announced his
resignation. His words fell like lead on the shocked ears of his
supporters. "We have been betrayed," they cried. But the victorious
Leftists cheered them down, and the crowds outside hailed the news
with transports of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"The Royalist Government has collapsed," Frederic Monod reported
to his household when he returned late that afternoon. "Guizot has
resigned, and God knows who will be his successor. There's been no
violence yet, but the National Guard has been called out as well as
the Municipal one."</p>

<p>"But the Citizen Militia hate the Municipal Guard," Henriette
broke in. "Does that mean there may be fighting?"</p>

<p>"I fear it. Already there is disorder among the regiments."</p>

<p>Few slept in Paris that night. Crowds gathered on the wet and
wind-swept streets, ragged coats and military uniforms making
strange human patterns under the flare of torches. At nine o'clock
the mob grew thicker on the Boulevard des Capucines, where the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was under heavy guard. But when the
marchers advanced upon the gates they were met by crossed bayonets.
A shot rang out, and others echoed in sharp metallic patter.</p>

<p>By early morning there had been another massacre in the Place de
la Concorde. Carts were parading the dead in improvised biers under
slaty skies, followed by shouting, water-soaked companies of men
and women. Fresh columns of soldiers were being sent out to restore
order, but when they reached the Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle and other
important arteries of the city, they found the way blocked by rough
barricades of mud and stone that had been hurriedly thrown up in
the night. Bedraggled red flags and equally limp banners of
tricolour mingled as one company of soldiers after another marched
out, only to scatter uncertainly. Everywhere muskets were being
reversed. Soldiers broke ranks and marched with the working men
they had been sent to disperse.</p>

<p>The Palace was in confusion. Without Guizot at his side, the
King vacillated like a ship without a rudder. Orders were
countermanded almost the moment after they had been dispatched.
Reform or repression&mdash;the King favoured now one, now the
other. It was as if, they said of him afterwards, "he held out his
right hand and shook his left fist."</p>

<p>There was no time to waste in argument if the Palais Bourbon was
to hold its own against the rival government that was even then
being formed in the Hotel de Ville. At eleven o'clock on the
morning of February 24th, Louis-Philippe called his two sons and
prepared to make his last royal appearance. He had decided upon a
personal appeal to his subjects. He would review the National
Troops on guard before the palace. They were a picked regiment of
his Citizen Militia whose uniform he wore, and they represented the
powerful bourgeoisie on whose support he had always relied.</p>

<p>But that drizzling day, as he rode along their lines in the
Carrousel, no spontaneous burst of cheers rose to greet him. Only a
few half-hearted cries of "<i>Vive le roi!"</i> answered his
challenge. The air was heavy about him. He knew that he had failed.
Abruptly he turned his horse back to the palace. An hour later the
abdication had been signed; he had exchanged his uniform for
civilian dress and with his family had turned his back on a Paris
that was no longer his capital.</p>

<p>News of the abdication and the flight of the royal family was
not generally known for some hours. In the region about the Monod
home there had been less disturbance than on the day previous, and
Henriette, grown restive from staying so long behind shuttered
doors and windows, had ventured out upon an errand. Word had
reached the household that a member of Monsieur Monod's
congregation was seriously ill and in need of help. The minister
had left some hours before, and there was no way of reaching him;
so she had volunteered to go to the sick parishioner. It was out of
the question for Madame Monod to leave her children, and besides,
Henriette rather relished the idea of leaving the house that had
held them prisoners for two long, anxious days.</p>

<p>"No, I am not in the least afraid," she had smiled reassuringly
from the door. "It seems quiet now, and the rain has stopped."</p>

<p>She reached the stricken home without difficulty, making her way
there by back streets. The patient was very ill. She could do
nothing beyond reassuring the family that Monsieur Monod would come
when he could, and that Madame Monod sent her sympathy. But when
she found herself on the street once more she could not resist
returning by a different route.</p>

<p>Streets and gutters were still wet, but the clouds had broken
overhead. She turned towards the Champs Elys&eacute;es and made her
way along familiar streets. Here there was more activity. People
passed her, all moving in the direction of the Tuileries, but in
their own haste they took no notice of her, an inconspicuous woman
in bonnet and shawl.</p>

<p>It was only when she found her path blocked suddenly by a
barricade of mud and cobblestones and a struggling mass of people
that she regretted her rashness in choosing that way. Hastily she
turned to retrace her steps, only to be met by a crowd that had
closed in behind her. Too late she realised she was caught fast
between two groups that had met from opposite directions, and that
were now mingling like a dark mass of gigantic human bees driven
out of a hive. There was nothing to do but keep from falling under
the rush of trampling feet. It took all her strength to do that.
She had no time to think or feel anything except the immediate
necessity not to lose her footing; to hold her own among those
swaying heavy bodies.</p>

<p>All her life that next hour remained a confusion of sights and
sounds and smells without semblance of reality. Sharp detached
pictures remained with her always&mdash;more like the shifting
patterns of a kaleidoscope held to her eyes than an actual scene of
which she was part.</p>

<p>"<i>Vive la r&eacute;forme! Vive la R&eacute;publique!</i>"
voices were shouting all about her&mdash;men's deep voices and the
thinner cries of women. She had no breath to join in. The sound
rolled over her head in dull thunder before it was broken by
distinct pattering of gunfire and the quick thud of hoofs on
cobblestones. A company of soldiers bore down the street, and the
crowd scattered in panic before the plunging hoofs and bared
sabres.</p>

<p>Henriette caught at an arm beside her to keep from falling as
the soldiers clattered by. They passed so close that a clod of mud
struck her cheek The man she clung to was a workman. She felt the
coarse cloth of his blouse under her fingers. His face was streaked
with sweat and mud, and a gash showed over one eye. He cursed
thickly and shook his fist at those riders in the uniform of the
Municipal Guard. A woman's scream shrilled out above the hoofbeats,
and then the crowd closed in about a body that lay sprawled and
limp where the riders had cut a path through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Henriette gasped to those beside her. "Someone has been
hurt, perhaps killed. We must stop. Let me get through."</p>

<p>But no one answered or moved to make way for her. Her lifted
voice was like a cricket's chirp protesting the roar of a
waterfall.</p>

<p>Up one street and across another to avoid more barricades, more
crossed bayonets&mdash;it was as if an invisible flood were
carrying her along with it. Her feet scarcely felt the ground under
them, and her arms were locked with those of a woman at her left
side and a man at her right. She felt more like a piece of
driftwood than a human being swept along without effort of her own.
But she was not afraid. A queer kind of exhilaration quickened her
senses like wine.</p>

<p>Somehow, though she never knew how it had happened, they were
nearing the Tuileries. The bare branches of trees showed against
the sky above the heads of the crowd. Once more the ranks broke
about her because a huge bonfire of blazing benches and furniture
blocked the way. Henriette smelled the smoke before she could see
the flames. Charred wood and sparks whirled up with the blue bitter
smoke that choked in her throat and made her eyes water. She could
hardly see where she was going, but she felt someone pulling her
away. Presently she found herself in a group of people huddled on
some stone steps under the arched entrance of a shop.</p>

<p>"Better stay here as long as we can," a shabby youth who looked
like a student told her. "They've broken into the palace, and there
will be shooting."</p>

<p>Almost before he had finished speaking she heard again the
distant crackle of gunfire, and the pavement about them became
blocked with people retreating in panic at the sound.</p>

<p>They must have been looting the Tuileries. She guessed that from
the objects they clutched as they ran past. She saw women,
wild-haired and jubilant, clinging fast to some bit of royal
finery&mdash;a S&egrave;vres ornament, a porcelain vase, a robe
embroidered with gold thread dragging in the mud. Men held other
incongruous trophies high above their heads. Their pockets were
stuffed full. She saw silver spoons fall under hurrying feet, saw
them whirl away in the brown water at the gutter.</p>

<p>Shock-headed urchins strutted fantastically in dress uniforms
resplendent with scarlet and gilt braid. Men stopped to wrangle
over the possession of a bottle. It slipped from between them and
crashed against the steps where she stood. She could smell the wine
that splashed her skirts.</p>

<p>Her ears rang with a multitude of voices, all lifted together,
yet all crying out different words. She made out now and again:
"Guizot&mdash;<i>R&eacute;forme</i>&mdash;Thiers&mdash;Lamartine&mdash;<i>R&eacute;publique</i>&mdash;Praslin!"
She felt sure she had heard that name It could not be merely some
echo in herself. "Praslin!" She heard it again, and a man near her
spat derisively at the word.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!"</i> she thought, drawing closer into the folds of
her shawl. "If they knew my name! If they guessed who stood beside
them, they would make short work of me!"</p>

<p>It came over her then that here she was in the midst of a
revolution she had indirectly helped to bring about. She had not
chosen to play a part in this fierce storm that had overtaken
Paris; the r&ocirc;le had been thrust upon her. Her own sufferings
and the calamity that had struck at the very core of her personal
life were bound up with a French king taking leave of his throne,
with the fate of these frantic men and women whose ideals seemed
lost for the moment in jubilant chaos.</p>

<p>She felt frightened suddenly by the knowledge. How had she ever
dared to speak of reform, of revolution, like a presumptuous child
prattling of the unknown? She had thought of revolution in terms of
a dignified change of power, a transition from one r&eacute;gime to
another, not this wild scramble for silver spoons and royal
uniforms, not these battered men and women trampling one another
down in muddy streets, shouting incoherently for they knew not
what.</p>

<p>"Revolution is like death," she thought. "We say the word, but
we never quite believe it can touch us."</p>

<p>Somehow she made her way back to the Monod house. When the
crowds thinned a little she crept along close to the walls of shops
and houses, inching her way towards side streets, and so by slow
degrees into quieter channels. Her bonnet had been lost; her shawl
hung about her shoulders in tatters; she was pale and mud-splashed,
but unhurt by the experience.</p>

<p>She even paused near a small open square to watch a shabby man
dividing a loaf of bread with a flock of noisy brown birds. There
he stood with outstretched hands in the midst of fluttering wings
as if the ground were not shifting perilously underfoot; as if, in
spite of all disaster, it were still important to feed sparrows.
Henriette felt an overwhelming gratitude for the gesture as she
hurried on her way.</p>

<p>The entire Monod household met her at the door with relieved
faces. They had heard the distant sounds of shooting and echoes of
disturbance, and had feared for her safety. Madame Monod was full
of reproaches that she had allowed her to take such a risk alone;
and her husband had seen enough violence in other quarters of the
city to realise how narrowly she had escaped harm. Between sips of
the wine they brought her, Henriette told them what she had seen in
the last two hours. They listened aghast to her recital. It was not
until later that Monsieur Monod remembered a message he had
forgotten to deliver.</p>

<p>"Who do you think I found at my brother's this afternoon, along
with others who had taken shelter there? That young minister from
America named Field. You remember him, Henriette?"</p>

<p>"The little American who had such a passion for travel? Yes, I
remember him. So he's back in time to see a revolution."</p>

<p>"Don't say the word, please," Madame Monod begged. "My heart
turns over each time I hear it."</p>

<p>"Well," her husband went on, "he will be able to witness more
than most travellers. He wanted to find out for himself what people
were thinking and feeling, and now he will have his chance. By the
way"&mdash;he turned to Henriette&mdash;"he sent you a message. He
wanted me to tell you that you were still on his mind."</p>

<h2>PART II.<br>
Mademoiselle Henriette Desportes<br>
1849-1851</h2>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-Five</h3>

<p>Once more she stood alone in early morning on the deck of a
vessel and stared at a distant shore whose outlines were beginning
to sharpen as the sun mounted. Staten Island, a steward had called
it the evening before when the <i>Celtic</i> had cast anchor at
last after nearly four weeks of salty progress. September, 1849,
eight and a half years since that other morning when she had waited
impatiently to go ashore with high-hearted confidence in the next
adventure. But the port of Havre lay thousands of watery miles
behind her now, and she had learned to be wary of adventure. There
was trouble enough in the world without running to meet it.</p>

<p>Only a few of the two dozen cabin passengers were astir at that
hour. She had left her five female companions asleep in their bunks
or busy with packing in the ladies' cabin below. How cramped those
quarters had seemed the day she had come aboard! Yet now she
dreaded taking leave of them. This compact world of wood and canvas
that had ploughed unhindered through a trackless waste of grey or
blue had soothed her nerves overwrought from the strain of
decisions and partings. It was an interlude when time ceased to
matter. One might hear the ringing of ship's bells or the call of
the watch by night, but there was no past to be reckoned with
because that lay far behind the white wake at the stern; no future,
because the dripping prow still pointed towards an unbroken
horizon.</p>

<p>"I was never able to visualise Eternity till now," she had
written in her journal a few days before. "I am not sure that I
believe in such a state, but after these weeks at sea I have had a
foretaste of what it might be like. One's spirit expands in the
strong sunlight and salt air. The fog closes in with the soft chill
of infinity. Stars loom large with importance when one knows that
one's course is being set by them, and it is strange how
differently people move and talk in the middle of the Atlantic.
Their voices grow less sharp and hurried. They speak simply and
gravely of life and death, even of God, sometimes to a comparative
stranger."</p>

<p>And now the <i>Celtic</i> lay at anchor in the harbour of New
York. Her side-wheels no longer churned, and her salt-drenched prow
had caught up with the new world. Its busy tempo was already
stirring about Henriette. Everywhere hatches were open, bales and
barrels being hoisted from the hold to the rattle of chains and the
groaning of windlasses. Gulls fought for the food thrown from the
ship's galley. Their cries mingled with the activity above and
below decks, and from the steerage came excited voices lifted in a
medley of tongues.</p>

<p>Henriette could see these emigrants pouring up from their dark
quarters like hordes of enormous rats eager to leave the vessel.
They packed the small deck space allotted them, crowding to the
rail for a first sight of America, jostling, gesticulating and
jabbering. She watched them as they waited there, marvelling at the
almost tangible quality of hopefulness that animated that scene.
Expectancy and the early-morning brightness laid a strange radiance
upon so many of the upturned faces; faces that had come to be
familiar to her during the voyage, and that she had classified as
old, ugly, sullen or stupid until she saw them suddenly transformed
before her. Tears filled her eyes at the poignancy of that look.
She felt envious of these people. What had they that she had
not?</p>

<p>"Faith," she thought, remembering the words of the Epistle to
the Hebrews, "'the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.'"</p>

<p>But they kept together in little groups, held apparently by ties
of blood, or friendship, or the common bond of language. Vainly she
searched among them for any who might be single like herself. She
noticed one, who stood apart, a woman of indeterminate years
shabbily dressed with a handkerchief over her head and a heavy
bundle at her feet. There was something unmistakably French about
her, the lines of a peasant in the shape of her body. Leaning over
the rail, Henriette attracted the woman's attention and greeted her
in French. The other smiled and answered in the dialect of
Brittany.</p>

<p>"We have arrived after all the long weeks, madam; and, God be
praised, the sun shines."</p>

<p>"You seem to be alone," Henriette ventured.</p>

<p>But the woman shook her kerchiefed head. Only for a little, she
explained. Her husband waited for her. No, not in New York; much
farther than that. She pointed to a white square of paper pinned to
her dress and tried to pronounce a difficult name. Others,
Henriette noticed, wore these same badges proudly displayed. There
would be someone waiting for them at the end of even longer
journeyings.</p>

<p><i>"Bon voyage,"</i> she wished the woman, and moved away.</p>

<p>She heard a fiddle playing a lively jig. Earlier on the voyage
that same instrument had wailed dismally, and rich Irish voices had
sung heartbreaking laments for the shores of Erin. Now the gay tune
went rollicking across the water. Tears had dried on the faces of
these boys and girls turned towards new shores. But she could not
give herself to the spirit of rejoicing. She felt no mounting
exhilaration as she stood at the rail. She was alone, more
completely alone than in all the thirty-seven years of her
life.</p>

<p>The nearer shores stood out clearly now. She could distinguish
brown fields and woods of frowsy trees that showed yellow and
russet in the morning sun. It had been summer still when she had
sailed. Somehow she had expected to find the familiarity of lush
green awaiting her across the Atlantic, not this tawny, unkempt
landscape dotted with frame houses. Whether these were set close
together or stood apart, their flimsy wooden shapes depressed her.
She missed the reassuring solidity of stone or brick. There was a
sense of impermanence about them that reminded her of Raynald's
architectural experiments with packs of playing-cards.</p>

<p>"Dear God," she thought with a shiver,' "to have come so
far&mdash;and for what?"</p>

<p>Several of her fellow-passengers passed and greeted her. A
family group&mdash;father, mother, tall son and pretty
daughter&mdash;who had sat near her at table paused to say
good-bye. Their faces were shining with happiness at being so
nearly home.</p>

<p>"No place like it," the man said with a broad smile; "and I've
seen the best they've got over there. Yes, ma'am, give me America
any time, and I'll make you a present of all the rest of 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Papa, that's no way to talk to Miss Desportes," his
wife apologised. "But I guess it's only natural to be kind of
partial to the place you come from. Don't forget, now: if you're
ever near Cherry Valley we'd be pleased to entertain you."</p>

<p>How kind they were, these Americans, with their easy offers of
hospitality! They seemed like a race of overgrown children to her,
with their na&iuml;ve curiosity in the world, their satisfaction in
their native land, and their directness of expression. Perhaps she
would grow used to their abrupt ways in time, but to their
voices&mdash;so high-pitched, so nasal&mdash;she would, she felt,
never become reconciled. They gave such strange twists to the
English language. They bore down upon syllables with such queer
emphasis where she least expected it. Where, they asked, would she
locate in New York? She must kick up her heels a bit and see the
sights before she got <i>swamped</i> with her teaching. One day
they introduced her to sweet-and-sour-tasting preserves called
"pickles," and the next day they told her of some mishap that had
left them in "a pretty pickle." The precise, pure English she had
prided herself upon speaking often brought puzzled looks as she
tried to make her meaning clear to American travellers.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Miss Desportes. Pleased to have made your
acquaintance, I'm sure."</p>

<p>She found herself responding to more farewells as the little
group of cabin passengers gathered to watch the arrival of the
tender which was to take them ashore. It was a river steamboat with
a blackened smokestack and a short blunt whistle that matched its
stubby prow. "Here, ma'am." A tall bearded American with whom she
had scarcely exchanged a dozen words on the entire voyage spoke at
her side. "You better keep by me, changing craft. I can lug that
bag of yours along with mine, and I guess we can all scrouge in
this first load."</p>

<p>She tried to smile as she thanked him. American men, she
decided, had no manners in the accepted sense of the word, yet they
were very polite. They treated women with natural respect, unlike
the more sophisticated appraisal of European males. Their speech
and dress and bearing might be awkward and unpolished, but they
seemed to take it as a matter of course that a woman should be
looked out for, whether she travelled alone or not. In France one
did not accept the arm of a strange man or let him help and advise
one about the transfer of luggage. But here she realised that no
familiarity was intended and no unfair advantage would be taken
later. She liked this easy kindness in the men of the New World as
much as she disliked their fondness for chewing tobacco and then
spitting it out like the spray from a rusty fountain.</p>

<p>The wind was fresh as the tender steamed away from the
<i>Celtic.</i> Henriette's bonnet ribbons began to flap, and her
long cloak and skirts to billow. There was nothing for her to do
but join the other women passengers in the stuffy cabin. Pressed
close to a pane of glass, she had her first sight of Manhattan. A
forest of shipping fringed the waterfront, close to docks and dingy
warehouses, and beyond that a jumble of brick and brown-stone
stretched away as the land rose higher. This, then, was New York,
the Queen of the New World. Henriette, accustomed to the impressive
buildings and bridges of Paris, to the dark dignity of London, felt
a shock of disappointment. Even though these buildings were less
flimsy than those on the nearby shores, they seemed hardly more
permanent. They, too, had a crude, unfinished look, and she peered
in vain for parks and green spaces to break the monotony of
close-packed streets.</p>

<p>"Only the ships are beautiful," she thought, watching a
clipper-built vessel slipping gracefully by; "and they go and come.
Why, even Marseilles was more picturesque than this."</p>

<p>It cheered her somewhat to distinguish a number of church
steeples rising above the roofs and chimneys. She counted more than
a dozen in plain sight as the steamer drew closer, and now she made
out a round stone structure resembling a fort with grass and trees
at the island's tip.</p>

<p>"Castle Gardens," she heard a man explaining to a woman
passenger. "It's getting pretty crowded down here, not much like my
grandfather's day. Must have been a nice little city then, but now
it's too big&mdash;six hundred thousand people, and still growing.
Don't know where we'll end with all these foreigners crowding us
off the streets."</p>

<p>"Yes," the other agreed, "they're getting to be a regular
nuisance, and I say they'd ought to stay home where they
belong!"</p>

<p>Henriette turned away. This was not a cheering conversation to
hear on her first morning in America. She had not come over in
steerage quarters, but all the same she was only another of "these
foreigners." Instead of growing more distinct as they neared the
landing-place, the buildings blurred before her eyes. In that whole
city of six hundred thousand souls there was not one she knew, not
a single familiar welcoming face. With all her heart she wished she
had stayed at home where she belonged.</p>

<p>But she reminded herself that the country she had left behind
had not been eager to keep her. France was still in a sorry state
of upheaval after the collapse of the government. The new ruler
Louis Napoleon had been hailed with desperate hope, but could he
bring order and prosperity out of economic chaos? Could he give
work to discouraged and bitter people who had lost their means of
support as well as she? Her only chance of work lay here, somewhere
in those streets spreading before her in the September sunshine.
Someone there had been willing to overlook the shadow of scandal
which she would never be free of in her own country. She must hold
fast to that one certainty and be thankful for it.</p>

<p>She tried to remember that when she and her possessions were set
down with the other entering foreigners in the emigrant depot,
where she waited to have her credentials passed upon. It was an
interval that seemed endless to her. She was never to forget that
place with its bare walls relieved only by printed rules and
regulations; the throngs of inarticulate men, women and children
grown anxious now under the questions of busy, harassed officials,
and just beyond the stonework of the building the jungle of ships'
masts and rigging dark against the morning sky.</p>

<p>She felt lost and insecure in all that confusion about her. In
vain she looked for a blue-bloused porter to shoulder her luggage.
She must wait till help came from some direction. Meanwhile the
wood of her stoutly-roped chest became a refuge for which she felt
grateful. For more than an hour she sat there, clinging fast to a
bag that held her credentials, her small amount of American money,
her letter of credit on the banking firm of August Belmont, and the
letter assuring her of employment. The familiar shapes of her
belongings only accentuated the strangeness of the world into which
she and they had suddenly been projected. They seemed pathetic bits
of wreckage from her own past&mdash;the umbrella, the bandbox with
the label of the milliner's shop in the Rue d'Antin, the flowered
carpet bag, the portmanteau with her initials in brass-headed
nails. It looked battered now, the corners rubbed, the brass
tarnished. She bent down and laid her hand to the worn leather,
almost as if it were something alive, an ageing pet dog that had
followed her into exile. The years they had shared had taken toll
of them both. Together they must, adapt themselves to new ways.</p>

<p>Through that hour of waiting she tried to recall the
encouragement of the friends she had left behind. Albert and Marie
had been so devoted, so steadfast in their belief in her ability to
make a new start across the Atlantic. Madame Le Maire, too, had
forgotten past differences and had actually wept at parting. Old
Pierre had wept, too, drawing his rough blue sleeve across his eyes
while he assured her he envied her the chance to go to America.</p>

<p>"You will find your fortune over there, Mademoiselle Henriette,"
he had insisted. "It's walking to meet you even now."</p>

<p>And the Monod brothers&mdash;without their help and practical
plans, where would she be to-day? They had sent out appeals to
influential friends on both sides of the sea to secure for her
another position. They reiterated their belief in her innocence,
and they called upon their Protestant associates to come to her
aid. It had seemed a hopeless undertaking, but their confidence had
never wavered; their efforts in her behalf had only been redoubled.
And when the miracle happened and the offer came for her to teach
in a select finishing school for the daughters of rich New Yorkers,
the brothers Monod had arranged everything for her comfort on the
long journey.</p>

<p>She had clung in sudden panic to Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod's
arm as he helped her into the railway carriage that last day. She
had hardly been able to see his kind, strong face through her
tears. But his words at parting remained the more clear.</p>

<p>"You will be valiant, Henriette," he had said. "It will always
be so, for you were cast in a brave mould."</p>

<p>"I shall try," she had faltered, "but I do not feel brave.
Somehow it was easier to face the charges in the Conciergerie than
this going so far away&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>She had struggled to master her tears, but he had not blamed her
for them.</p>

<p>"'Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy,'" he had reminded
her. "I hope I shall live to see your harvest, Henriette. It will
be a good one wherever you go. Yesterday when I was helping my boy
with his Latin I found a motto worthy of your own particular coat
of arms. Say it over after me. You will remember it better in the
Latin: <i>Qui transtulit, sustinet</i>&mdash;'He who transplanted
still sustains.' Never be afraid to send your roots deep into that
new soil. I think you will grow there and be happy in time."</p>

<p>He had written the Latin words on his card and slipped it into
her hand before the train moved away. She had repeated them to
herself many times on the voyage, and now on the doorstep of the
New World she repeated them again: <i>Qui transtulit,
sustinet.</i></p>

<p>She was free of the building at last. She and her possessions
were being stowed into an open hackney coach that presently was
clattering over the cobblestones. The driver, with good-natured
volubility and a rich Irish brogue, was determined that she should
miss nothing. He continually turned on his box to point out with
his whip this or that sight of interest.</p>

<p>City Hall Park surprised her by looking like a well-kept English
square. The Hall itself had fine proportions and a cupola that rose
above the few shade trees. Across the Park the Astor House boasted
six stories. Its broad steps and marble pillars were impressive,
and the shops on its ground floor showed glittering window
displays. Barnum's Museum and Stewart's Dry Goods Store, a huge
marble building, both adjoining the Park, were pointed out by her
guide, who continued to bombard her with information as they
rattled along a busy thoroughfare called Broadway. It was crowded
with vehicles at that hour. Often their horse must be pulled up
short to avoid collision; often they were caught fast in a snarl of
omnibuses, smart carriages, lumbering drays, or other public
conveyances. The unevenness of the cobblestones made the hack sway
and lurch with a motion that was far more trying than that of a
small ship in rough water. Mud splashed from gutters and worn
hollows in the pavings. Henriette felt dizzy and deafened by the
confusion of motion and sound.</p>

<p>A medley of impressions had taken over her mind before that
drive ended. She was struck by the compactness of these streets.
Only an occasional vacant lot broke the solid ranks of brick and
brownstone as one narrow, high building dovetailed the next with
scarcely a foot to spare. Signs were displayed on nearly every one,
huge boards proclaiming wares of every description. They added to
the unfinished look of the city&mdash;as if, Henriette thought,
children had built it haphazard to suit their changing tastes, and
then plastered their handiwork with na&iuml;ve embellishments in
the way of pictures and printed signs. Then there were markets and
hand-pushed carts loaded with vegetables and fruit. She marvelled
at such careless profusion; she marvelled, too, at the sense of
sturdy independence and activity which charged the very air she
breathed. Even to the casual observer there was less contrast among
those who crowded the pavements. Beggars were not so much in
evidence. There were fewer fashionably dressed strollers. All
appeared bent on some definite purpose, and they moved at a brisker
pace than Europeans going about their business. "Time is money"
seemed to be a motto that Americans took for granted.</p>

<p>Churches, shops, hotels and theatres-she tried to fasten names
and fa&ccedil;ades together as they were pointed out by her guide.
But most of them&mdash;Niblo's Garden, the Bowery Theatre, the
Astor Place Opera House, the American, the Irving, the St. Nicholas
and the Prescott hotels all ran together in her mind. Union Square,
looming between handsomer buildings, with its benches and
flower-beds, its trees and tall flagpole, was a relief after the
commotion of the bustling thoroughfares. Then presently they turned
into a quieter side street of comfortable, unpretentious homes set
about a small enclosed plot of grass and trees where nurses were
watching their charges at play.</p>

<p>"Gramercy Park," the driver turned to announce with a flourish
of his whip, and Henriette welcomed the reassuring name.</p>

<p>The horse was tied to a hitching-post before a row of brick
houses each with a flight of steps leading up to a white-trimmed
doorway where brass knobs and knockers shone prominently. Henriette
peered once more at the letter in her bag to verify the numbers.
Ten&mdash;yes, there could be no doubt that the house next to the
church on the corner marked the end of her long journey. A neat
brass plate on the door left no doubt as she read the words: "Miss
Haines' School."</p>

<p>She followed a housemaid into a long, cool parlour, shaded from
the glare of the street by drawn blinds. The half-light gave a
thin, watery look to everything as if she were suddenly at the
bottom of the sea, and the subdued sounds from the street in the
hushed stillness of the house only intensified the illusion. She
had barely time to note that the room was furnished in austere but
excellent taste with heavy mahogany pieces. Sofa and chairs were
still sheathed in summer dust covers, and a light matting lay on
the floor.</p>

<p>Then she rose to take the extended hand of Miss Henrietta
Haines.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle Desportes, you have arrived in good time and I
hope in good health. Did you have a comfortable voyage on the
<i>Celtic?"</i></p>

<p>As she responded, Henriette found herself pleasantly impressed
by the middle-aged lady in the primly cut grey dress, relieved only
by white collar and cuffs and a black taffeta apron. She liked the
fastidiousness of person and the refined manner of speech of this
schoolmistress. There was quiet authority in the voice and in the
direct glance of those eyes that were somehow youthful in spite of
the wrinkles about them. This woman had traditions and spirit which
Henriette recognised at once. There would, she felt, be no need of
subterfuge between them.</p>

<p>"I am naturally a little tired and confused after the long
journey," she was assuring her new employer; "but you must know how
grateful I feel to be here, especially under obligation to you for
your lack of prejudice in giving me this opportunity to work."</p>

<p>"You must not feel under any obligation to me personally." The
other smoothed her apron and continued to sit erect as the
proverbial poker in the opposite chair. "I came to the decision
after long thought and considerable investigation."</p>

<p>"I am thankful that you know all the facts of&mdash;of the
tragic episode in which I was so unfortunately involved. It will
make things less difficult if I need not rehearse them to you
again."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am fully acquainted with the Praslin case. Our own
newspapers here were full of the affair, and then from our pastor I
learned further details of your plight. After the letters he
received from the Monod brothers I felt certain that you had been
the victim of circumstance. From the Monods and other members of
our faith I also learned that you had suffered because of your
religious convictions. That was what really decided me to help you.
Some of my own forefathers settled here to escape religious
persecution&mdash;on my mother's side there was a French Huguenot.
I remembered that when we heard of you."</p>

<p>"I shall do my best," Henriette promised, "so that you will
never regret your decision."</p>

<p>"Well," Miss Haines continued, "I did not arrive at it without
prayer and trepidation. You had such excellent qualifications, and
you were so highly recommended; but still in a school like this,
where the daughters of the city's best families are entrusted to my
care, your coming seemed perhaps to present too many difficulties.
I had my own reputation and responsibilities to the parents to
consider."</p>

<p>"I know. I have taught long enough to understand all that."</p>

<p>"It was really providential for you that young Mr. Field should
have come to me as he did."</p>

<p>"Mr. Field?" Henriette repeated in bewilderment. "I did not know
that he had anything to do with my coming to America."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, our minister brought him to call on me soon after his
return from Europe. His personal account of you convinced me more
than all the letters of recommendation. Such high praise coming
from a young man of his standards, and family, naturally carried
great weight. He made it plain"&mdash;a faint suggestion of a smile
hovered about her lips as she spoke&mdash;"that, besides filling
every requirement, you would be an ornament to any situation you
might fill."</p>

<p>Henriette felt her cheeks flush. She had almost forgotten the
eager admiration of that persistent little American, and now she
found him responsible for her fresh start in the New World. One
chance meeting a year and a half before, yet it had brought her
across all the watery miles to this cool, impersonal parlour. She
had been rude to him that night, and he had repaid her in this
fashion. How strangely things came about, past the power of
reckoning! We meet; we exchange words; we part; we are caught up in
separate currents of activity, only to be brought together again,
to have the whole course of our lives changed by a word from the
other&mdash;spoken, or left unsaid. She had never expected to
encounter that young minister with the candid blue eyes and
impetuous manner again, yet here he was, bound up in the pattern of
her very existence.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," she ventured with a slightly deprecating shrug,
"that Mr. Field may have been somewhat prejudiced by his own
enthusiasms. Did he tell you that we met but once?"</p>

<p>"Once seemed to be quite enough for him; and now, Mademoiselle
Desportes, let us discuss your duties before we go upstairs. School
will reopen next week, so there will be plenty of time for you to
rest and accustom yourself to our ways."</p>

<p>Miss Haines had very definite ideas about how a school should be
conducted, but Henriette found them sensible. She was to have all
the French classes and instruct an older, more advanced group of
girls in painting. Henriette and two other resident teachers were
expected to supervise daily walks to relieve the strain of too long
work at desks, and there were other duties outside the classrooms,
for half a dozen girls were boarding pupils. Miss Henrietta Haines,
however, assumed most of the executive tasks herself.</p>

<p>"And now I am sure you wish to rest and unpack." The
schoolmistress rose, and the first interview was over
satisfactorily. "Our noonday meal is over, but I will order some
refreshment sent to your room. We dine at half-past six, and only
Fr&auml;ulein Schmit, who teaches German and mathematics, will be
with us. I believe a letter came for you yesterday. I will have it
sent up with your things."</p>

<p>Once more Henriette found herself in a small room up several
flights of stairs. The school filled two adjoining houses which had
been thrown together. The kitchen, servants' quarters and
dining-room occupied the basement, with parlours and classrooms
directly above. Miss Haines had her own apartments on the top floor
of one building, while the resident teachers and boarders had
smaller rooms in the other. The one assigned to Henriette had two
windows that faced the little park and the brick row beyond. It was
a pleasant outlook over the trees, and a cool breeze stirred the
crisp white muslin curtains. The furnishings were plain, but the
place was immaculate, and everything had been arranged for her
comfort.</p>

<p>Still, it had a precise, unadorned look that reminded her of the
old convent days. She sat down on one of the stiff, straight-backed
chairs and tried not to give way to depression. The varying
emotions of the morning, the confusion of a new city&mdash;all this
had left her suddenly spent. She felt, as she often did when great
weariness overcame her, utterly detached in spirit. She saw
herself, sitting alone and friendless on her own wooden chest in a
corner of the cheerless emigration depot. She knew exactly the way
her cloak had fallen about her drooping shoulders, how small her
belongings had looked about her. Always that picture of loneliness
at the gates of a strange land would stay with her. Some day, she
knew, she would put that scene, that woman's figure, those few
possessions, and the flapping printed rules and the grey walls, on
canvas or paper. Her brush or crayons would make it a remembered
reality. But just now she must try to forget how very real it had
been.</p>

<p>When her luggage had been brought up, the room took on a more
personal look, and presently a maid appeared with food on a tray,
and a letter. Henriette held the light square of paper in her hands
and studied it curiously. It was too soon to have news from France;
and, besides, the stamp was as unfamiliar to her as the writing.
There must be some mistake, yet there were the letters of her name
and the address set down plain in strong, flowing penmanship. "St.
Louis, Missouri." She made out the postmark and was further
mystified.</p>

<blockquote>MY DEAR MADEMOISELLE DESPORTES [it began],&mdash;May I
be the first to greet you by letter on the day of your arrival in a
country where I hope you will be very happy?<br>
<br>
From my kind friends Adolphe and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod I
learned of your plan to resume your former occupation, and it was
also my privilege to speak of you to the good lady in whose school
you will teach. I am sure that this association will be mutually
pleasant, and I envy the young minds fortunate enough to be
inspired by your own.<br>
<br>
I regret the distance that makes it impossible for me to welcome
you when you land for the first time, but as you see I am many
miles away from New York. My father and brother Stephen and I were
united in London this past summer, but I sailed before them, and it
seemed best that I should return to my old pastorate here for a few
more months. My brothers Cyrus and David are both living with their
families in New York and have urged me to make headquarters in
their homes, so, my dear Mademoiselle Desportes, it is my hope to
call upon you there before long.<br>
<br>
I have not forgotten our conversation together, nor could I forget
you if I wished to do so, which is far from the case. Your welfare
means much to me, and I find myself impatient to hear of your safe
arrival and how you find yourself in the new situation.<br>
<br>
Soon you will count many friends on this side of the Atlantic, but
I trust you will remember that I welcomed you here even before you
set foot on these shores.<br>
<br>
May I remain, dear Mademoiselle Desportes, with pleasant
remembrances of our first and even more pleasant anticipation of
our next meeting,<br>
<br>
Faithfully yours,<br>
HENRY MARTYN FIELD.</blockquote>

<p>She paused later in the midst of unpacking to read the letter
through a second time. How characteristic it was! The impulsive
gesture of friendliness and admiring goodwill under the slightly
formal phrases; the simple directness with which he took their next
meeting for granted; the appealing way he hoped that she would be
happy in his country.</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle," she remembered how Louise had carelessly
dismissed this country and its inhabitants, "only queer people live
in America. You would like to go there, would you?"</p>

<p>Strange how the words came back to her after so long.</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>, queer or not, they have taken me in," she
reminded herself as she laid her first American letter away to be
answered. "It is good to have a friend here. I like this little
minister&mdash;this Henri Martyn-in-the-middle Field."</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-Six</h3>

<p>Six times round Gramercy Park, then north on Lexington Avenue as
far as the paving continued smooth, and back again: Henriette
dreaded that mid-morning exercise period with the thirteen girls in
her charge. They were in the difficult middle teens, and though she
had favourites among them individually, collectively they tried her
patience. These daily promenades were what she most disliked in the
school routine. She was supposed to keep them walking in step at a
brisk pace; to see that they did not lag or behave conspicuously.
Above all, she must make sure that they did not attract the
attention of any passing male, young or old. This was not easily
managed, but Miss Haines insisted upon strict observance of a rule
drawn up according to the school's best standards of deportment:
"Young ladies are urged at all times, but especially during
exercise periods, to maintain an erect carriage, proper decorum of
manner, and to pay no attention to extraneous objects."</p>

<p>"Extraneous objects," Henriette soon discovered, had come to be
a phrase with double meaning in Miss Haines's School. It covered
the entire male species, but more especially the young men of the
neighbourhood, who delighted to congregate and watch these
daughters of Manhattan's most prosperous families put through their
paces. Henriette walked in the centre of her little group, and if
by far-sighted strategy she managed to manoeuvre the three first
couples past masculine obstacles, the set behind her would
invariably lose composure. If she turned her attention to her rear
guard, then those in advance might be guilty of some breath of
etiquette.</p>

<p>On a certain day of February, 1850, she set off with her
charges, feeling particularly low-spirited. She had been
disappointed at having no letters on recent ships from France, and
the weather was bitterly bleak and depressing. There had been heavy
snow in January and then a thaw, followed by an intense cold that
crusted streets with ice. Raw winds blew in from the rivers,
chilling to the marrow when one ventured out. Indoors it was not
much more comfortable. Those who sat near the grate fires in each
classroom grew flushed and stupid from the intense heat, while
those a few feet off shivered with numb fingers and toes. Extra
woollen stockings and layers of flannel petticoat helped somewhat,
Henriette found, but they weighted her down as she moved among her
pupils, trying to keep their wits from wandering. They had plenty
of ability, these select young ladies of New York, but little
application; and it took all her energy to drive them to their
work. Lately, among the girls in the older group she had detected
more than ordinary signs of restlessness and suppressed excitement.
They whispered more frequently and passed little three-cornered
notes from hand to hand. She found them studying her with furtive
curiosity and then exchanging sly glances full of personal
significance. This had been going on for over a week now, though
she had been careful to take no notice of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Now, as she marshalled them down the steps of Number 10 Gramercy
Park, she felt more than ever aware of secret activity. In some way
she knew it concerned her. They had been restless and difficult
before, but she had not been the sole object of their attention.
Something had turned them against her. She could feel an almost
tangible hostility as the little procession formed.</p>

<p>"Marianna Van Horn, you will please walk with Kate Delany;
Isabelle Lorillard with Agnes Brevoort; Rebecca Jay with Ellen De
Peyster." She tried to pair them discreetly, separating the more
lively spirits. "Louise Jumel will please accompany me part of the
way, and Lucy Schuyler will change places with her on our return.
The rest take your places behind us. Emily Delavan, please to
fasten your tip-<i>pet</i>."</p>

<p>Ordinarily she would not have minded their amusement when she
accented the wrong syllable, but to-day the muffled giggles annoyed
her. A sharp retort rose to her lips, but she kept it back. She
would order them all to speak in French during the walk, and that
would restrain them somewhat. Again she racked her brain for some
explanation of their behaviour, but she could think of nothing to
account for their antagonism.</p>

<p>"But I tell you I <i>am</i> sure," a lowered voice came from
behind her. "Mother's maid C&eacute;leste kept all the papers, and
I read them. Imagine, he was a Lord or Duc or something, and he
killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Henriette lost the next words as a sleigh went gliding past on
smooth runners with bells jingling. She forced herself to make
polite comments in French to the girl at her side while her ears
strained to catch more conversation from the rear.</p>

<p>"You mean she's all mixed up with murder? Oh, Emily! If it's
true, it's the most exciting and romantic thing I ever knew, and
she's right here in Miss Haines's school."</p>

<p>"It certainly is true. I borrowed the papers, and Ellen and
Louise are stopping to see them on the way home. I don't think it's
so romantic, and I guess Mamma won't either when she gets back from
Baltimore next week and she finds out the kind of French teacher
we've got."</p>

<p>"Hsh, Emily, she's turning round. Speak French to me, quick!
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est, s'il vous plait?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Oh la, la, prenez garde de tomber ici. Cet</i>
icy.&mdash;What's French for sidewalk? There, that's enough to
satisfy her, but you just wait and see, Rebecca Jay, what I've got
to show you. You'll be surprised. Of course I don't intend to make
trouble, but if she starts correcting me for my accent again before
the class, I'm going to look her right in the eye and ask her a few
questions myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, Emily, you wouldn't dare!"</p>

<p>"I would so. I'll ask her how to pronounce P-R-A-S-L-I-N and
C-O-N-C-I-E-R-G-E-R-I-E, and we'll see how she acts then!"</p>

<p>Henriette separated the two girls on the walk back. She took
Emily Delavan for her own companion and placed Rebecca Jay directly
in front. Temporarily, at least, she had silenced the whispers; but
she knew that soon every girl in the school would have heard some
garbled version of the story. Later, as she moved about tidying her
classroom, she found a folded bit of paper under a desk.</p>

<p>"Just wait till you hear the awful thing Emily has found out
about Mademoiselle D.," she read in an immature girlish hand.</p>

<p>That use of the initial must have been unconscious; yet if they
had tried to be malicious they could not have devised a more cruel
way to hurt her.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle D.," she thought bitterly. "So she has crossed the
Atlantic also. I had hoped she was left for ever in France."</p>

<p>That evening she asked Miss Haines if she might see her upon a
rather important matter. She found her settled before a coal fire
in the small sitting-room, busy with books and correspondence under
the lamplight.</p>

<p>"I hope that you are happy with us, Mademoiselle Desportes."
Miss Henrietta Haines laid down her book and studied her visitor
keenly. "You have seemed a trifle tired these last few days. I hope
you are not finding our American winters too severe?"</p>

<p>No, she assured her employer. What she had come to discuss with
her had nothing to do with weather. She reiterated that she enjoyed
her classes. Group teaching had been new to her, but she found it
stimulating. Until lately she had felt that she and her pupils were
in complete accord, but for the last week a change had come over
the older group of girls. This had puzzled her until to-day, when
she had discovered the reason. Briefly she repeated the fragmentary
conversation overheard on the walk, and she produced the crumpled
note.</p>

<p>"Emily Delavan," Miss Haines remarked thoughtfully. "That is
unfortunate, for she is a leader, and her family are influential.
Still, I suppose, this was bound to happen sooner or later."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Henriette agreed. "I have been trying to think
of the best way to meet it. I did not wish to take any steps
without consulting you."</p>

<p>"Several of the parents already know of your connection with the
Praslin tragedy," Miss Haines continued. "I consulted them before
offering you the post. They agreed with me that old scandals should
be forgotten in your case. I had hoped that, since you were
referred to oftener by the name Deluzy in accounts of the trial,
you might escape notice as Mademoiselle Desportes."</p>

<p>"I had hoped so, too, but girls are clever at spying out
secrets."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. We must be prepared for trouble and perhaps
complaints from parents. I shall take your part, of course, but I
must say I should not relish a visit from the Delavans or the Van
Horns, or Mrs. De Peyster."</p>

<p>"They are a very spirited group of girls," Henriette agreed,
"particularly this Emily Delavan. But she has a good heart, and so
have the rest. I believe, if I could tell them exactly what
happened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean give them all the sensational details of the murder
and your&mdash;your connection with it?" Miss Haines was openly
shocked and incredulous.</p>

<p>"By to-morrow they will all have read those old newspapers,"
Henriette went on. "They will know all the scandalous details, as
you say. But if I tell them in my own way I think I can still keep
their respect. I should like to have you give me leave to try."</p>

<p>"And suppose your method fails. What shall we do then,
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"In that case I will not embarrass you by staying. You will find
another teacher of French, and I will try to find another place. I
see no other way to keep this trouble from spreading."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right; but it seems rather strange to confide
your story to a group of young girls who lead such carefully
sheltered lives."</p>

<p>"But they live and breathe; they will love and suffer in a few
more years. I think it will not hurt them to know the truth. It is
better that they hear it from me than that they magnify the words
of servants and newspapers to mean what is false. With your
permission I will trust myself to these girls to-morrow and take
the consequences."</p>

<p>"It seems rather rash." Miss Haines hesitated.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but one must be rash sometimes. If I did not take
these girls into my confidence, always between us there would be
this barrier. We could never work freely together."</p>

<p>"Well, Mademoiselle Desportes, since you are ready to take the
risk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you. To-morrow, then, during the ten o'clock French
conversation, I will tell them my story."</p>

<p>"You will be very circumspect, please?"</p>

<p>"You can trust me. And if I fail, you need not feel under
obligation to keep me here. Good-night."</p>

<p>That night she lay wakeful after she had finished correcting
exercises in French grammar and blown out her lamps. It was
intensely cold. The wind from the East River tugged at the window
shutters, and wheels and hoofs sounded sharply from icy streets
below. In spite of all the comforters and a hot brick at her feet
she stayed stiff and shivering as she planned to-morrow's campaign.
She felt lonely and middle-aged. Exactly, she reminded herself, as
a spinster schoolteacher nearing thirty-eight should feel. Yet she
faced the future calmly, though she knew how much depended upon her
handling of a delicate situation.</p>

<p>"I have been through too much," she thought, "to care so
desperately what others may think of me. I shall never make
compromises with myself for others again. I shall say what I think
and feel from now on. That is what I learned in the Conciergerie.
One cannot go through blood and tears and disgrace and not be
changed."</p>

<p>She dressed with special care next morning. It was not fitting
for a school-teacher to wear the flowing curls of Paris boulevards.
She had already made that discovery, but she brushed her hair to
gleaming softness on either side of her face and put on a blue
cashmere dress that was especially becoming. At the collar she
fastened the enamelled pin with the gold dragon's head. She had
worn it through so many days of stress since the Duchesse had
presented it that she had come to feel an almost superstitious
attachment to the piece of jewellery. Yes, she felt ready to meet
the enemy on its own territory.</p>

<p>Her first class was for the youngest scholars, and all through
that hour her mind kept looking ahead to the next. Plans and
phrases raced through her mind as she copied out simple poems and
heard the children recite them.</p>

<blockquote><i>"Je suis le petit Pierre<br>
Du Faubourg Saint-Marceau<br>
Messager ordinaire,<br>
Facteur et porteur d'eau..."</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Their strange high-pitched voices droned after her in sing-song
unison. It was torture to hear their pleased mispronunciations. But
how sweet they looked&mdash;round and rosy-cheeked, with such
innocent clear eyes, such small perfect bodies in full dresses and
starched aprons! One little girl with yellow hair reminded her of
Berthe, and Berthe had looked so much like her father.</p>

<p><i>"Merci, mademoiselle, je vous remercie."</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Au revoir, mademoiselle,</i> and please, I've lost my
handkerchief!"</p>

<p><i>"Votre mouchoir, ch&eacute;rie</i>," Henriette corrected, and
offered a fresh one from her desk.</p>

<p>They had gone, and the advanced French class was filing in. She
watched them from under lowered eyelids while she pretended to be
busy over some papers. An undeniable air of bravado was stirring in
the room. Those thirteen girls were fairly bursting with importance
as they took their places. Emily Delavan's black curls quivered
excitedly. She whispered to Marianna Van Horn, and they nodded in
complete understanding.</p>

<p>Henriette continued to study the little group, fascinated as she
always was by the different racial inheritances that cropped out in
spite of dominant Americanism. These daughters of early settlers
showed their stock. The Dutch Van Horns, Brevoorts, Schuylers and
De Peysters were sturdy, placid and blonde. The English Delancys,
Jays, and Wards were also fair-skinned, but with more delicate
features. The spirited, dark French strain showed plainly, in the
Lorillards,</p>

<p>Jumels, Delavans and De Rhams, descendants of Huguenot
families.</p>

<p>How the types persisted in spite of transplanting!</p>

<p><i>"Bonjour, mesdemoiselles,"</i> she began when the clock
struck the hour and they were settled in their seats before her.
"Our lesson will not be conducted in French to-day. You may lay
aside your books, for it is to be entirely oral. All I ask is that
you give me your whole attention, and that you will do your part
faithfully when I shall call upon you for comments. I am going to
tell you a true story, and it is important that we understand one
another perfectly. Are you ready that I should now begin?"</p>

<p>An uneasy rustle followed this announcement. Puzzled looks were
exchanged. Something in Mademoiselle Desportes's manner let them
know that this was to be no ordinary recitation period. The
classroom had grown very still during this pause. Blue, brown and
grey eyes were turned expectantly towards the teacher's desk.</p>

<p>"Well, then, we shall go to Paris, to a large and beautiful
house in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, the residence of
a noble family named Praslin&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again an uneasy presentiment stirred the classroom. Emily
Delavan shifted in her place and glanced sheepishly towards Rebecca
Jay.</p>

<p>"This Duc and Duchesse de Praslin had many children," the quiet
voice continued, "sons and daughters of various ages; so it was
necessary that they employ a governess. It is of this governess
that I shall tell you."</p>

<p>Once she was well launched into her recital, there was no more
restlessness. The girls sat without moving except for an occasional
long-drawn breath or a rustle of skirts as they leaned forward
absorbed and intent. A pencil fell to the floor, but no one thought
of picking it up. There must be no interruption. From the first
Henriette had their undivided attention. But that was not enough.
She must have their sympathy, too, and to this end she brought all
her gifts of eloquence and persuasion to bear. She called words to
her command as she had summoned them under the questionings of
Monsieur Broussais and Chancellor Pasquier in the courtroom. It was
more difficult, however, to make herself clear in English and to
remember her promise to Miss Haines that she would be circumspect.
She was nearing the most difficult part of her recital.</p>

<p>"And so"&mdash;she leaned towards them across the desk, and her
voice grew even more low and vibrant&mdash;"and so, just when she
thought there was more harmony in that household, just when she
hoped there would be no further lies printed about Monsieur le Duc
and his attentions to his children's governess, there appeared
another article in the newspapers&mdash;a much more slanderous one
than before. She was ordered to go, and she could do nothing but
pack her things and leave that house where she had been so
happy."</p>

<p>"I call it a shame, a regular shame!" Agnes Brevoort's cheeks
were scarlet as the words burst from her involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Hush!" the other girls whispered in hasty rebuke.</p>

<p>"It was not easy for her to find other work." The voice was
going on. "You yourselves must know how careful your mothers are
about the characters of those who serve them. Without a letter of
recommendation from the Duchesse de Praslin, what could she do? And
that promised letter, it did not arrive. A month she waited, and
her despair&mdash;you cannot think how great it was. But worse was
yet to come. Oh, very much worse!"</p>

<p>The schoolroom clock had struck the half-hour, and still they
hung on her words. Their ears were strained to miss none, and no
one giggled at strangely misplaced accents.</p>

<p>"The investigation, it was ended. The law declared her innocent,
and she was allowed to leave that prison, the Conciergerie. But
where to go? What to do? So horrible a crime had shocked the people
of France, and many still believed her guilty of having a part in
it. She was without friends, but a kind family took her into their
home. She must hide there for many months, since it was not safe
for her to go among people even though she had partly changed her
name. She was very miserable in those long months. She wished to
die, but that was not possible. God must have meant that she should
endure. But how was she, then, to live? Where, then, was she to
go?"</p>

<p>"To America!" This time the exclamation came from Lucy
Schuyler.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, but suppose the terrible things that this governess
wished so much to forget should follow her to America? Suppose even
were she able to pay her passage across the ocean and find work to
do in a strange city&mdash;suppose even then she might not be
allowed to leave her troubles behind her? People can be as cruel in
one country as in another. They can find copies of old newspapers
and stir up what is best forgotten. They can exchange sly glances
and whispers; and though they perhaps mean no harm, the ugly story
spreads and grows till there is no peace for her&mdash;not even in
America."</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle, please don't go on." A smooth brown head went
down on folded arms, and a girl's sobs broke out suddenly in the
stillness.</p>

<p>"One moment, please, and I shall say no more."</p>

<p>Henriette had risen to make her final appeal. The intense quiet
of the room was broken only by a stifled sob or a tell-tale
sniffle. All eyes, even the most tearful, were fixed on her face as
she began to speak.</p>

<p>"It is for you to tell me the end of my story. But first the
question I shall put to you, which I beg you will answer
truthfully: Do you, mesdemoiselles, think that this governess
deserves to suffer the rest of her life, or do you think that she
has earned the right to continue her work without prejudice in a
country where many before her have sought refuge?"</p>

<p>Their response was overwhelming. Rachel herself, though facing
far larger audiences, had never been more compelling; and she had
certainly never received a more spontaneous ovation. Between tears
and vehement protestations they rallied to her side.</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle, it was wonderful! I mean, she was, to stand
up before them all and plead her own case."</p>

<p>"Of course, she shouldn't have to suffer any more, and any one
who ever mentioned it to her ought to be, to be&mdash;Well, they
ought to be put a stop to!"</p>

<p>"Goodness me, but she was spunky! Excuse me, mademoiselle, but I
mean she certainly had a lot of grit."</p>

<p>"Of what, Lucy? What word is that you are saying?"</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, you can count on us never to breathe a word."</p>

<p>Henriette smiled as they flocked about her. "I thank you all
from my heart. But you, Emily Delavan, you have said nothing. That
surprises me. I thought you would be the first to ask me a
question."</p>

<p>The girl's dark head lifted. Her usually bright, defiant eyes
were clouded as they met Henriette's.</p>

<p>"I haven't any question, mademoiselle." She faltered, and her
lips quivered suspiciously.</p>

<p>"What! You do not wish to know the name of that governess? I am
quite ready to tell you."</p>

<p>"No." The dark curls shook emphatically. "You needn't tell us
any more. I guess you know how we feel. We're just&mdash;just plain
skunks."</p>

<p>"Why, Emily Delavan!" The others opened their moist eyes in
shocked surprise. "If Miss Haines ever heard you use that word
she'd send you home for good and all!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's what we are, and I don't care who hears me say it.
I'm going to burn every single one of those old newspapers when I
get back, and I'm never going to mention a word of this to any one
as long as I live. Here, let's all cross our hearts and hope to die
and be cut in little pieces if we do!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but please, no," Henriette interposed hastily. "That is far
from necessary. I shall trust you, and you must trust me. We shall
have understanding now. That is all we need, I think, and to-morrow
we will resume the exercise in French conversation that you
prepared for this morning. This hour has not been lost, since it
has shown me how wise it was that I crossed the Atlantic Ocean to
find new friends. Make haste now, <i>mes ch&eacute;res,</i> it is
already time for our walk."</p>

<p>Once more the procession set off on its daily round. Snow was in
the air, and the sky a dull grey above the leafless trees in
Gramercy Park. But a new harmony possessed the little group. They
moved as one, united by a common enthusiasm. Mademoiselle Desportes
was a heroine. Before, she had been only their French teacher,
correcting accents and grammar and supervising these tiresome
walks. Now, though she walked beside them in the same brown cloak
and beaver bonnet she had worn yesterday, she moved in a romantic
haze. They saw her now as one of those who gather legends to
themselves. Jeanne d'Arc; Marie Antoinette, Charlotte Corday, and
Portia&mdash;their ordeals were as nothing compared to the
sufferings and triumph over injustice of their own Mademoiselle D.
She had taken them into her confidence, not as children, but as
contemporaries. She had shared her secret with them, and they would
never betray that sacred trust.</p>

<p>Henriette felt the reflected glow of this new enthusiasm as she
walked in their midst. She was exhilarated by her conquest, yet
deeply touched by their loyal response. Young championship was very
sweet and also very affecting. They chattered eagerly about her,
drawing her into their conversation continually. "Don't you think
so, too, mademoiselle?" She could hardly answer all the questions
in French and English. She smiled into those bright, admiring eyes
and thanked God that she had not lost the power to quicken young
hearts.</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-Seven</h3>

<p>Spring reached Manhattan early that year. The last remnants of
dingy snow had hardly melted before unsuspected green appeared
between brick and brownstone. Buds swelled wherever a tree or shrub
could manage to grow, and in Union Square and Gramercy Park
delicate tassels and soft dottings that would soon be leaves lay
like mist on brown branches. Everywhere window-boxes bloomed with
pansy, hyacinth and geranium plants. Fresh paint brightened blinds
and doorways, and in all well-conducted houses east and west of
Fifth Avenue violent orgies of spring cleaning began.</p>

<p>By late April the girls came to school in fresh new dresses of
gingham and poplin, gay with stripes and plaids and sprigged
patterns. They looked as fresh and charming as the bouquets they
brought to her desk&mdash;daffodils and tulips and the first apple
blossoms from their families' country places at Spuyten Duyvil or
Harlem or suburban Bloomingdale. It was hard to pay strict
attention to the classwork with these flowers filling the
schoolroom with distracting fragrance. They made Henriette homesick
for the gardens and lawns and the woods of Melun. Sometimes on a
Saturday or Sunday she would be invited by Emily Delavan or Rebecca
Jay or Lucy Schuyler to drive out to their country places. She
enjoyed these outings, and found the region beyond the city full of
a simple and prosperous beauty. The houses pleased her by their
rambling and unpretentious style. She had come to like these
estates set along the Hudson and the East River. Their white wooden
walls and neat pillars fitted into the landscape, set among
orchards and groves of fine trees with lush lawns sloping down to
the water, where small craft anchored in sheltered coves.</p>

<p>Now that the days were longer, she often walked about the city
with Fr&auml;ulein Schmit or another teacher. Women could go safely
without male escort until darkness fell and the lamplighters began
their rounds with ladders and torches. After that the ladies of New
York did not go abroad unaccompanied, though they sat at their open
windows or high front steps, greeting neighbours and watching their
children at play. Henriette had a passion for exploring the byways
of Manhattan. Fr&auml;ulein Schmit enjoyed these excursions except
when Henriette's curiosity carried them beyond the limits of
propriety, as in the exploration of Dutch Hill.</p>

<p>Dutch Hill turned out to be a crazy-quilt village of board and
mud shanties cluttering a section of the East River on that
northerly outpost of the city, East Forty-second Street. Henriette
had been fascinated by this squatter community of picturesque
squalor, with its nondescript barking dogs, its rooting pigs and
goats, its swarms of ragged, exuberant children. She was eager to
talk with them and with the untidy women picking over great heaps
of rags, bottles and bones they had salvaged. But Fr&auml;ulein
Schmit was shocked by this spectacle.</p>

<p>"It iss scandalouse!" she had exclaimed in horrified accents.
"Come at once away, Mademoiselle Desportes, lest we the cholera
catch!"</p>

<p>Fr&auml;ulein Schmit preferred sedate promenades in the
fashionable Stuyvesant Square quarter where they passed the
handsome pillared homes of many of their wealthy pupils. Or if they
had a whole free afternoon and the day was especially fine they
might turn south and stroll down Fifth Avenue as far as Washington
Square. North on Fifth Avenue to the city limits at Forty-second
Street was another favourite promenade where they usually made the
huge stone pile of the Croton Reservoir their objective. Going and
returning, they always paused by the Waddell suburban villa on the
corner of Thirty-eighth Street with its gardens and miniature
Gothic lodge, its impressive brick and sandstone mansion set behind
smooth lawns and shrubbery. Fr&auml;ulein Schmit considered this
place the only elegant one in New York, but Henriette did not
admire its ornate imitation of foreign architecture. She found
Fr&auml;ulein Schmit's conventional opinions more tiresome than the
provincial preferences of the Americans she had met. She longed for
more adventurous companionship through that first spring in New
York, and at last the wish was granted.</p>

<p>On a midday morning with the last school term ending in a
fortnight, she received two letters that affected her variously.
One came from Paris, bringing news of her grandfather's death. He
had died without being reconciled to her, and though Henriette's
legal representative had put in a claim for her as his only heir,
the woman with whom he had taken shelter had managed to gain
possession of his small estate. Times were still very precarious in
France, the letter told her. There was almost as much confusion in
the government as before the new r&eacute;gime under Louis Napoleon
had been established. She had done well, it seemed, to find refuge
with the Republicans across the sea, since the French Republicans
were steadily losing power; and it appeared that the formation of a
second empire was inevitable.</p>

<p>The other message, from Henry Field, told her that he had
finished his duties in St. Louis and was on his way to New York. He
expected to be there almost as soon as his letter. He would visit
his brother David Dudley and would call upon her at the earliest
opportunity. She laid the letter away with mingled feelings, for
she both dreaded and anticipated this meeting. To see this young
man who was so bound up with the most unhappy year of her life
would be difficult. Wounds that were healing could so easily be
reopened. Yet she welcomed the thought of his companionship. She
had met few men in New York, and she wearied of female society with
its narrow, domestic chatter. During that year she and the little
minister from New England had corresponded frequently. His letters
convinced her that besides being well read and scholarly he
possessed a flexible and at times brilliant mind. With all his
learning he had kept the capacity of response to the world about
him. He shared her curiosity and enthusiasm for people. She had
been impressed by his fine discrimination and by a natural gift for
expressing all that he felt and believed.</p>

<p>He came one warm May evening, and she knew at once that she need
not have dreaded their reunion. He was twenty-eight now, but only a
trifle less eager and boyish, though his travels abroad had given
him more maturity of outlook. She had forgotten the blue directness
of his eyes and the way his plain face kindled to his thoughts. She
had forgotten, too, his absent-mindedness. He sat for half an hour
holding a bunch of lilacs he must have bought from some corner
vendor for her. It took a good deal of sly manoeuvring on her part
to remind him of the intended gift.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" He smiled suddenly and handed them over. "I knew
there was something I had left undone. Lilacs are not so fragrant
here as our country ones. Our Berkshire bushes will not be out for
another fortnight. You will like Stockbridge, Mademoiselle
Desportes, and find many things to paint there."</p>

<p>His easy assurance that she would visit his old home amused and
touched her. She had met American hospitality before, but this was
something more. He wanted her to share his own enthusiasms, which
included an appallingly wide range of subjects. He had much to tell
her of his brothers: of David Dudley, whose legal opinion was
becoming rapidly the most respected in the country; of Cyrus and
his financial success in the wholesale paper business. Cyrus was
only thirty, but already he headed his own company. And then
Stephen J.! He was bursting to tell of this brother's adventures
across the continent on the Western Coast. Stephen had studied law
and been partner in David's firm, but when gold was discovered in
California he had gathered his resources and set off by sailing
vessel for the Isthmus of Panama. From there by long and difficult
stages he had reached the Pacific and sailed for San Francisco.
Only lately the family had received letters from that far-off
frontier.</p>

<p>"No, Stephen has staked no claim," he told her. "Panning gold
didn't appeal to him. He wanted to be one of the first lawyers in
California. He landed in San Francisco with ten dollars in his
pocket; but he writes that his shingle was hung out at once in
Marysville, where he's had plenty of cases. They pay in gold out
there."</p>

<p>"And is it true what I read, that they answer arguments with
their pistols?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Stephen didn't say, but he's got plenty of the fighter in him.
He writes that California is the most beautiful place he has ever
seen, with high mountains like the Alps in some places, and that
the Bay of San Francisco with its islands reminds him of
Greece."</p>

<p>"He has been to Greece?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, and to Turkey. My sister and her missionary
husband took him with them when he was a boy. Stephen speaks Greek
fluently. He keeps his journal in Greek so he will not grow rusty.
But just now his heart is set on drawing up a legal code for the
State of California. There will be confusion till that is done, and
he thinks they could not do better than to adopt David Dudley's
code for New York."</p>

<p>"So this Stephen, he believes in keeping laws all in the
family." She smiled. "What brothers you are, one for another!"</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;he joined in her laugh&mdash;"we all had to stick
together when we were young. And now I am perplexed. Stephen wishes
me to come to California, where there is also a great need of
preachers, and I have just received a call to a church in New
England. I should like to ask your advice, Mademoiselle
Desportes."</p>

<p>"But how is it that I should advise you? I have met you, to be
exact, only once. We have exchanged letters&mdash;true, but I have
not heard you preach."</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow you can hear me," he told her. "I have been
asked to fill the pulpit of Dr. &mdash;&mdash;'s church on East
Ninth Street. My brother David Dudley and his wife will be pleased
to call for you at a quarter to ten, and it will make me proud and
happy to know you are in the congregation."</p>

<p>She was waiting in Miss Haines's parlour in her best green
poplin, black silk dolman and bonnet with black lace and bunches of
green and purple grapes. It was not a new costume, and the hoops in
her skirts were considerably smaller than fashion decreed. But she
had brought it from Paris, and it had, she knew, "a certain air."
She felt sure that the tall, distinguished Mr. Field, who helped
her into the open carriage, and his handsomely attired wife were
favourably impressed by her appearance. They eyed her with
well-bred interest on the drive down Fifth Avenue, and exchanged
polite questions and answers.</p>

<p>"Henry has told us so much of you, Mademoiselle Desportes." The
blue eyes that were larger and infinitely keener than the younger
brother's were bent upon her. "We have been anxious to make your
acquaintance. We should have called upon you earlier in the winter,
but my practice has taken me often from the city."</p>

<p>"And I, too, have been busy," Henriette answered. "It is, I
think, better that your brother Henri should himself make the
introduction."</p>

<p>"You are younger than I pictured you," Mrs. Field remarked.
"You're not in the least what I expected."</p>

<p>"What you mean, perhaps"&mdash;Henriette reacted at once to the
appraisal behind those words&mdash;"is that you would not at once
mistake me for a school teacher, and perhaps you also wonder that I
do not bear the marks of the ordeal I suffered in Paris."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Mr. Field answered quickly. "That was not what my wife
meant; but according to Henry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," she broke in with a smile. "I can imagine that his
enthusiasm, as you say in America, 'ran away with him.' Henri must
be always the champion of some cause or some person&mdash;is it not
so?"</p>

<p>She sat in the corner of their pew and watched the stylishly
dressed women in their billowing silks and taffetas and poplins
rustle up the aisle beside frock-coated men. A group of girls from
an orphanage filled one section, and there were shabby individuals
scattered here and there; but for the most part it was a
representative gathering of the city's most conservative and
prosperous families. She wondered what Henry could have to say to
them. She tried to picture his youthfulness in that high mahogany
pulpit.</p>

<p>But when she saw him climbing the steps and taking his place on
a tall Gothic chair she was struck by his dignity and
unselfconsciousness. He was no novice to his calling, and there was
authority in his manner when he rose and announced the opening
hymn.</p>

<blockquote>"Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve,<br>
And press with vigour on;<br>
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,<br>
And an immortal crown-n,<br>
And an <i>immortal</i> crown."</blockquote>

<p>The words were new to her. She pronounced them carefully, trying
to keep her accent like the voices that rose about her in a great
surge of sound.</p>

<blockquote>"A cloud of witnesses around<br>
Hold thee in full survey.<br>
Forget the steps already trod,<br>
And onward urge thy wa-ay,<br>
And onward urge thy way."</blockquote>

<p>Singing that stanza with the rest, she was startled by the
personal significance of those words. They might have been written
for her and for her alone. Had Henry chosen them for her peculiar
benefit in all that congregation? She lifted her eyes from the hymn
book to find that his were fixed upon her face. It was no time or
place for an exchange of smiles. Neither he nor she moved a muscle,
but they answered each other across the pulpit and intervening
pews.</p>

<blockquote>A cloud of witnesses around<br>
Hold thee in full survey&mdash;</blockquote>

<p>And then her head was bowed in prayer. She could hear the tones
of his voice, but his words were lost in those of the hymn. "Cloud
of witnesses"&mdash;the accusing faces of the Paris courtroom came
before her with such clearness that she trembled in her corner of
the pew. Only he and she in all that congregation guessed what that
phrase could mean, what it had meant in her life.</p>

<blockquote>Forget the steps already trod,<br>
And onward urge thy way&mdash;</blockquote>

<p>A wave of thankfulness flowed over her. It was not easy to go on
one's way without looking back. No, it would never be easy, but
somehow she felt it was not going to be so difficult from now
on.</p>

<p>The collection plates had been passed, another hymn had been
sung, and the congregation settled itself for the sermon. Henriette
felt a sudden anxiety for that young minister towards whom all the
eyes were turning. He looked very small behind the high desk with
its great open Bible, small and boyish. His serious beardless face
was lifted in earnestness from the page before him. His voice came
clear and vigorous as he took his text from Paul's First Epistle to
the Corinthians:</p>

<blockquote>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling
cymbal.<br>
<br>
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that
I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing.</blockquote>

<p>She had long been familiar with the verses, but as he spoke them
on that warm spring Sunday, they took on a new and personal
meaning. He seemed to have chosen them, like the hymn, for her
alone out of that congregation. She had begun by watching and
listening with critical anxiety, hoping that he might create a good
impression, yet preparing herself to make allowances for his youth
and for crudities of delivery. But from the first she recognised,
beside his gift of expression and his sincere and scholarly
interpretation of the Scriptures, a latent power that commanded
respectful attention. He had a way of illuminating passages rather
than distorting them to fit his points, and he was not given to
overstressing and elaboration. Eloquence, in the accepted sense of
the term, was not his, but his lack of affectation and his own
simplicity and goodness gave weight to his words. Hearing him
preach, she thought, was like looking through the clear water of
some deep and quiet pool where nothing on the surface marred what
lay below.</p>

<p>But long before he was through she had given up analysing his
ability. Almost she forgot that he was her friend. She lost the
circumstances of their acquaintance in what he had to say. Charity
had never seemed a virtue worth cultivating until then. She had
looked down upon it as a weak and negative quality. It was
something that made one the object of patronage, that laid one at
the mercy of others. Now he made her see how wrong she had been.
She knew suddenly that charity in its highest sense might be
stronger than all the more obvious virtues she had admired and
tried to cultivate. She, who had been so proud and arrogant, so
sure of herself and her own actions and opinions, she had lacked
this greatest of all attributes. She had asked charity of others,
but had she been willing to give it in return? She had prized her
own independence, her sense of honour and the gifts with which she
had been endowed, but she had not prized charity. She had not given
it a thought. If she had, there might have been no such tragedy in
the Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;.</p>

<p>She and the preacher of that sermon had little chance to talk
together after the service or later at his brother's home, where
Henriette had been invited for dinner. The David Dudley Fields
lived in a large house between Fifth Avenue and Stuyvesant Square,
and the other brother, Cyrus, and his wife had come for the meal
from their nearby home. Henriette studied with interest these three
members of a New England family The brothers were so completely
different in appearance and tastes, yet closely bound by
inheritance and family loyalty. She had seldom seen so strong a
clan spirit in three men of such varying personalities.
Unquestionably David Dudley, the eldest brother, had the most
original and brilliant mind of the three and by far the widest
range of interests. He talked with ease and authority on matters of
international importance. She found his knowledge of European
affairs more stimulating than anything she had heard since her
landing in America. She had been hungering for just such talk, and
his response to her eager questions soon dominated the conversation
about the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Cyrus she found less intellectual; but he also was a thoughtful
commentator upon affairs outside the provincial limits. He had
travelled extensively in Europe and had much to say upon political
and social changes across the Atlantic. But his interests were more
centred upon business affairs. He was shrewd, stubborn, and
intensely practical. Like David Dudley, he had a commanding
presence, and his height, aquiline features and red hair and beard
made him noticeable. His eyes were not blue, but grey and deep-set
under prominent brows. He gave the impression of hawk-like
keenness, and he seemed to be charged with some inexhaustible fund
of energy. There was an indomitable quality to this brother&mdash;a
fierce and unshakable determination that Henriette sensed from the
moment he entered the house.</p>

<p>"I should not like to cross his will," she thought. "He could be
very ruthless. He is like the man who, once having put his hand to
the plough, cannot turn back. Yes, he is more what I believed these
Yankees to be&mdash;hard-headed, as they say, but also, I think,
far-sighted. Henri is not like either of these two. They are more
shrewd and dominant than this youngest brother. He must take care
that they do not overshadow him."</p>

<p>It fascinated her, to study and compare their traits and
resemblances. Henry was like a smaller, less toughly bound family
edition. His features were not so sharply cut, his eyes milder, his
mouth more generous but also less firm. Their minds and energies
had already determined their characters and achievements, but Henry
was still flexible, like half-formed clay.</p>

<p>"They are devoted to Henri," she decided. "They are helpful and
loyal to him because he is their flesh and blood, but I think they
do not quite take him seriously yet. To them he is still the little
brother going to college in their made-over suits. But he will show
them what he can do. He <i>must</i> show them."</p>

<p>Watching him across the table, she was filled with a great
determination to see this youngest brother develop to the utmost
all the gifts she knew he possessed, different gifts from the
assured successful pair who were deep in discussion of the
development of the Far West and its resources. She guessed his
power, and she also guessed his weaknesses. This boyish modesty was
charming, but it must not grow into lack of self-confidence. This
enthusiasm for the minds of others must not make him neglect his
own. He must not step back and let them pass him because he was so
trusting and idealistic. Yes, she decided, he was at that stage in
his career where he could easily be drawn up or down. He had not
the flinty determination of these brothers. He had been endowed
with a remarkable mind, but he lacked their practicality, their
will to achieve. Still, he could be made to achieve. It ran in the
blood. She felt it in him, though he was himself unaware of it.</p>

<p>"I could make him succeed," she thought. "He needs a wind
pressing behind his sails to drive him on the right course."</p>

<p>She flushed, embarrassed at her thoughts, and turned from them
hastily.</p>

<p>After dinner she found it dull to sit with the two wives while
the Field brothers retired to talk in the library. She would have
infinitely preferred their conversation to the domestic duet of the
sisters-in-law. Their interests seldom ranged from household
activities, and their talk of clothes, meals, house furnishings and
of the rising cost of wages bored Henriette since she could
contribute nothing. It did not seem a major tragedy to her that the
price of bed and table linen had risen or that an Irish maid fresh
from the steerage had the presumption to expect two dollars a week
as well as board.</p>

<p>She felt instinctively that these wives regarded her with
suspicion and pity. They disapproved of the active part she had
taken in the dinner-table conversation. Women should rule their
homes absolutely and leave international affairs to their husbands.
If they had no husbands, they should be especially careful to
maintain a self-effacing manner, and avoid laying themselves open
to the accusation of unladylike behaviour. How much Henry had told
them of her past, she could not guess; but they had evidently made
up their minds not to include her in the intimate circle of their
completely feminine world. If she had been a spinster sister,
living in some sheltered home, at the beck and call of parents,
married relatives and nephews and nieces, they would have accepted
her as one of the less fortunate members of their sex. But she
showed too much spirit in speech and dress, and far too much
independence in earning her own living, to be altogether
trusted.</p>

<p>It was a relief when the gentlemen rejoined them; and Henry at
last suggested that he see her home to Gramercy Park.</p>

<p>It was not pleasant to ride in one of the crowded stages, and
though her escort offered to call a carriage, she convinced him
that she preferred to walk. They took their way with other Sunday
afternoon strollers along the shady side of Stuyvesant Square and
north up Second Avenue with its large houses and handsome doorways.
The fine spring weather had brought out more carriages than were
usual on Sunday in Manhattan, and the clatter of hoofs and wheels
broke into their talk. But they felt happy to be walking together.
They responded to the sun and nimble air and to the pleasure of
each other's company. Henry's sermon was behind him, and he felt
pleased with the impression Mademoiselle Desportes had made upon
his brothers. Despite his usual preoccupation with deeper matters,
he was not unaware of her distinction and grace. To him she
possessed beauty, the provocative beauty of the unexpected. He
could not have told what she wore, but he knew he could not take
his eyes from her as she moved in a cloud of swaying green and
black, with dark lace making a shadow about her face and clusters
of artificial grapes bobbing against her hair. He only knew that it
filled him with secret elation to be there beside her.</p>

<p>"I liked your brothers," she told him, "but most of all I liked
your sermon."</p>

<p>He flushed under her praise and looked so pleased that she half
expected to see him snatch off his high Sunday hat and toss it in
the air like a schoolboy.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," he said. "It seemed good when I wrote it; but when I
stood up and began I felt unequal to my subject, almost as if it
were presumptuous of me to interpret the words of the Apostle
Paul."</p>

<p>"You did not spoil them," she insisted. "It moved me, what you
said about charity, for you made me know my own lack of it."</p>

<p>They had reached the gates of Gramercy Park, yet somehow neither
he nor she went on towards the door of Number 10. Only a few people
were in the small enclosure. The old man who tended it opened the
gate and greeted Henriette. He knew her as he knew all in the
neighbourhood who shared this privilege. They found a bench under a
horse-chestnut tree, and the five-fingered young leaves made
delightful patternings on her out-spread green skirts.</p>

<p>"There is a difference of opinion regarding various
interpretations of that chapter of Corinthians," Henry was going on
to explain. "I cannot quite decide myself whether 'charity' or
'love' is the more exact meaning. Even in the original Greek it's
hard to tell.</p>

<p>"Love is, of course, a more comprehensive term, and yet for that
reason I hesitated to use it. And then it has come to mean&mdash;"
He broke off in confusion at having become involved in so difficult
a definition.</p>

<p>"Yes," Henriette answered without taking apparent notice of his
embarrassment. "It has come to mean much that Saint Paul did not
perhaps intend."</p>

<p>He smiled at her gratefully and laid his hat on the bench.
Somehow it seemed the most natural thing in the world to be sitting
in this sanctuary of green shade discussing love in the abstract,
while above them city birds were interpreting it in terms far more
shrill and personal.</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-Eight</h3>

<p>May was over, and school was over for the long summer holiday.
The girls had departed with their families for suburban retreats
from the noise and heat of the city, and Miss Haines's
establishment on Gramercy Park suddenly became very large and
still, with echoing, empty schoolrooms. Only Miss Haines,
Fr&auml;ulein Schmit, Henriette and the servants were left to fill
it. Henriette was free to spend the summer there if she wished, and
she planned to do so except for brief visits to several of her
pupils' country places. But these would not be till August. June
and July stretched before her with long uninterrupted days to spend
as she pleased. She had looked forward to this time. It would be a
chance to catch her breath after the busy winter of confining work.
She would resume her painting again, she decided, and write her
long neglected journal besides long letters to the friends across
the sea. Yet the summer was slipping by, and she had done none of
these things, for during those weeks the youngest Field brother had
been a constant visitor.</p>

<p>He had been filling several pulpits in the city while he made up
his mind whether to go West and join his brother Stephen or accept
the call to duties nearer home. He, too, had plenty of time on his
hands, and at first there were frequent excuses for his dropping in
at Number 10 to ask Henriette's opinion on a variety of subjects.
Of late he had discarded even these flimsy pretexts. He appeared
each afternoon as regularly as clockwork for the simple and
altogether too evident reason that he could not stay away.
Sometimes they rode as far north or south as the stages could take
them; sometimes they explored the half-settled regions along the
waterfronts or in the rocky, half-cleared squatter communities
beyond the reservoir; sometimes on excessively warm days they went
no farther than the little Park or the quiet parlours where
shutters dimmed the glare from the streets. Often Miss Haines
pressed him to stay for supper and the evening, and Henriette could
not very well discourage such invitations from her hostess. She
approved wholeheartedly of Mademoiselle Desportes's friendship for
this young minister. He supplied the masculine element that had
been lacking in Number 10 and a new animation crept into the meals
as the four gathered about the table on those long summer
twilights. Perhaps, too, Miss Haines was more romantically inclined
than she would have cared to admit to herself or her pupils.
Certainly she was sympathetic to this visitor's absent-minded
lapses when he heaped mustard on hot biscuits instead of butter, or
sprinkled salt on strawberries while his eyes remained fixed on
Henriette sitting where the slanting light brightened the soft
frame of her hair. She heaped his plate and refilled his cup as if
she were supplying the needs of a growing boy. But she asked his
opinion on many subjects and listened to his comments with
respect.</p>

<p>"A most unusual young man," Miss Haines often remarked after
such a visit. "Really, it's a comfort in these days when so many
are rushing off to the West with nothing but gold and land
speculation and making money on their minds, to find one with good
manners and principles left."</p>

<p>Henriette did not disillusion her about the possibility of his
also starting for California, though they discussed the advantages
and drawbacks to such an uprooting when they were alone. In those
weeks their conversation ranged far and expanded like the balls of
dried ferns that unfold to miraculous greenness in a bowl of water.
It was amazing, they continually told each other, that they should
feel so alike upon nearly every subject under heaven when no two
people had ever been born and reared under such different
circumstances.</p>

<p>"I knew you would agree," Henry would nod with satisfaction,
whether they discussed Louis Napoleon and French politics, slavery
in the Southern States of America or a mutual dislike of dandelion
greens.</p>

<p>"I knew before you spoke exactly how you would feel!"</p>

<p>They had come a long way since the May Sunday when they had
first sat together on the bench in Gramercy Park. Henry had left
off comparing "love" and "charity" in the Greek of St. Paul's
Epistle to the Corinthians, for he was revising his own version of
love. This personal revelation that looked out of his eyes had
begun to disturb Henriette. She had at first refused to notice
certain signs. She made excuses for the frequent calls, the eager
confidences, the sense of completeness in each other's company. She
told herself that he was lonely, that he had few friends with
congenial tastes, that he had known few women outside his family.
This was true enough, yet it did not explain the growing conviction
that lighted up his face each time they met. She was afraid of
love, and she had resolutely turned her back upon it. She wanted to
keep this new friendship that had flowered so amazingly; she did
not want to lose it just when it had become satisfying and
necessary to her. So she manoeuvred conversation away from the
dangerous channels of sentiment. She tried to overlook what she had
no wish to see and hear. She threw out occasional subtle hints
which she hoped would discourage ardour, without destroying
congeniality. But her efforts were not successful. In fact Henry
Field took no notice of them whatsoever.</p>

<p>"It is incredible that I should find love waiting to trap me on
this side of the Atlantic, where I thought to be secure from it,"
she would sigh after he had left and the house was still. "I must
put a stop to it at once. I would not for the world hurt him, and I
cannot afford to let him hurt me."</p>

<p>But when to-morrow came, and when her visitor came with that
look of secret exhilaration and complete faith in her
understanding, she had not the courage to keep to her resolutions.
One more day together shot through with this magic current of
shared happiness could do no harm, she would reason. To-morrow she
might be able to break this thread that she felt drawing them
closer together. For she, too, was happy, though not as she had
been happy before. The wild clamour of startled ecstasy, the
terrible restlessness and delicious pain no longer stirred her.
What she felt now was something steady and strong and quiet that
had crept upon her so gently, she had not guessed its presence till
too late to arm herself against its force.</p>

<p>"This cannot be love I feel," she argued. "It is too kindly and
simple for that. <i>Mon Dieu,</i> if I had the right to keep it
always! But no, for him it would not be enough. He is so young and
inexperienced, and I know too much because I have been through the
fires."</p>

<p>She saw herself suddenly as the burned-out shell of a house. The
blackened walls remained. In time vines and weeds might cover them
with green, but that was all one could hope for. The house would be
empty. Yes, she told herself, it must stay empty. That was the
penalty of fire and ruin.</p>

<p>And then, in July, he announced that he was going away&mdash;not
far, he explained, but to spend a few weeks with his parents in
Stockbridge&mdash;and he hoped that she would come for a visit. She
shook her head and tried to make excuses which did not in the least
convince him.</p>

<p>The afternoon was warm, but a breeze stirred from the East River
as they walked up the familiar lengths of Fifth Avenue. It was
almost deserted in Croton Cottage, a small restaurant that faced
the Reservoir and the Paupers' Burying Ground that lay behind the
huge stone pile. They found a secluded table and ordered root beer
and seed cakes while they rested before starting the long walk
back.</p>

<p>"Why do you put me off with these excuses?" he asked her,
resuming the subject she had hoped he would drop. "Why do you say
it's impossible for you to come to Stockbridge when you know I want
it above all things?"</p>

<p>"But it is impossible, Henri." She sighed and gave her little
Parisian shrug that always enchanted him. "Why do you insist that I
force myself upon your parents? You will return in a few weeks, yet
you behave as if you were setting off for California&mdash;no
less."</p>

<p>"Whether I go to California or not depends entirely on you." He
leaned across the table to search her face. "Everything depends on
you," he added in sudden intensity.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Henri, how can you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because it's true, and I must say it. I have been trying to for
weeks now. Surely you must have known. You must have guessed."</p>

<p>She felt a chillness creep over her though the heat was
oppressive. It had come, then, all in a moment. Now there was
nothing she could do to put him off. He had said the words, and
more were coming&mdash;the hesitant, half-articulate phrases of
love that she had waited so long to hear. Too late, she told
herself; they had 'come too late. Yet they fell upon her like rain
on parched earth, and the deep roots of her loneliness and need
responded in spite of all the doubts her reason could muster. Love
was all the more miraculous and dear because she had never expected
to find it here, speaking its own language with alien accents.</p>

<p>"You are everything to me." The eyes across the table would not
let her turn away. "Everything that has ever seemed good and
beautiful and desirable in this world or&mdash;or the
next&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Henri, please! Even you know nothing of the next world; but
I know so much more than you do of this one. I cannot let you go on
because each word you say only&mdash;only makes it more
difficult."</p>

<p>Tears rose and filled her eyes. They came between her and his
face, but she felt his hand, warm and urgent, on her own. She ought
to draw hers away, but she had no power to do so.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Henriette."</p>

<p>She felt herself answering his quiet command.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I knew how you would look with tears in your
eyes, though I never saw them there before. Now I have seen you in
every mood, and I love you in every one."</p>

<p>Long ago on the night of their first meeting she had known this
same sensation, this feeling of completeness with another. They had
been among many people then&mdash;now they were alone; yet it was
as if they were close together on an island of their own making.
She must wrench herself free while she could still command her
feelings. She must resist the terrible temptation to answer his
love with love.</p>

<p>"Henri." She spoke with all the ruthlessness she could summon.
"You must listen to me. You are not practical, so I must be
practical for us both."</p>

<p>How it dogged her always, that word! "I am a very practical
person," she had insisted years ago with the Duc's eyes on her
face. "We must be practical, messieurs." She could hear the very
tones of her voice answering the old Mar&eacute;chal and the
Abb&eacute;. And now at another crisis of her life the fatal word
rose to her lips.</p>

<p>"You have given me too much already, Henri," she was going on,
"&mdash;help when I most needed it, your loyalty and friendship;
and now your love. You ask me to be your wife, and a man can offer
nothing more to any woman. You overwhelm me, so that I can hardly
say what I must. But, Henri, what you wish is not possible, not
after all that has happened to me."</p>

<p>"What happened to you is also responsible for our being here
together to-day. Don't forget that because the past was bitter. Oh,
my dear, if I could make you feel what I feel you would not think
the price had been too great to pay."</p>

<p>But still she shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of the price you also would have to pay. I need
not rehearse my story to you. I thank God that you know every part
of it. But there will be others who do not know, and who will find
it out. It will always follow me wherever I go, and by whatever
name I am called. You do not realise the difficulties, Henri, even
though you are generous enough to share them with me."</p>

<p><i>"Ad astra per ardua,"</i> he murmured. "To the stars through
difficulties."</p>

<p>She smiled, thinking how natural it was for him to drop into
Latin even at such a time. But still she shook her head.</p>

<p>"We are not alone in the world," she pointed out; "at least you
are not. We would have no right to bring my past troubles upon your
family."</p>

<p>"My family will love the woman I love. I can count on them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;you are very closely bound together. But family
ties cannot be stretched too far. I come of a different race from
yours; and, though you and I might learn to forget that, they never
would. And, then, there is another reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not listen to it," he broke in.</p>

<p>"It is there, whether you listen or not, and it is a matter of
mathematics." She tried to smile, but failed miserably in the
attempt, as women dislike mathematics, especially where their ages
are concerned. Still, I must remind you, if you have forgotten what
you must have read in Paris newspapers, that there is a difference
of ten years in our ages."</p>

<p>"As if years had anything to do with us!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but they have when they happen to lie in the wrong
direction. If those ten years were on your side it might be another
matter."</p>

<p>"Hearts are more important than calendars. Do I have to tell you
that?"</p>

<p>"We can never cheat time," she persisted. "We should be fools to
think we could; and, whatever else you and I may be, Henri, we are
not, fools. You are just twenty-eight, and that means I am nearing
forty. Your best years are all ahead, and, as women go, mine are
not." She found it difficult to keep her voice steady. "It is not
easy for me to remind you of this. But you have the right to wish
for a marriage that will bring you all a man desires, and it might
be that I could not give you that&mdash;" She broke off, then
forced herself to go on. "I mean children, Henri. Have you thought
of that?"</p>

<p>He reddened at her words and shifted uneasily in his chair. No
unmarried American or English woman would have thought of
mentioning the possibility of unborn children as anything but
impersonal gifts from heaven. He was taken aback, yet at the same
time curiously stirred by her Continental frankness. He saw that
her eyes swam with more tears, that she could not speak because of
her deep emotion. He cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I can think only of being with you always," he reassured her,
"as long as we both live and feel what we are feeling now."</p>

<p>She gathered herself for further protests, but he would not
listen. A new quality of possessiveness had taken him. He seemed
suddenly older and more determined as he refused to be shaken in
his resolve. He would not insist upon her answer yet. He begged her
for the present to put aside all her scruples and preconceived
ideas on marriage. All he asked was that she give herself to her
own feelings and let them guide her. He would accept the verdict of
her heart, but not of her head. In the meantime he urged her to
make the visit to his parents before she came to a definite
decision. At last he persuaded her, though she agreed with some
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Give me a week to prepare myself, Henri," she told him. "It
will be best that you go to them first. Tell them all that they do
not already know of me. Do not soften the story of my part in the
Praslin tragedy because of your own feelings. Tell them that we
have seen much of each other, but that we have as yet no
understanding as to our future. And, Henri," she suggested
tactfully, "the waiter looks discouraged. Perhaps he would like you
to settle the bill."</p>

<p>It was a week since that afternoon and now she had almost
reached the end of her long and dusty journey into New England. She
had set off at eight in the morning, exchanging her place in the
rumbling horse-drawn stage for another in one of the steam trains
at the railway terminus uptown at Thirty-Fourth Street. The heat
had been intense from the start, and by noon the cars were like
ovens, with smoke and cinders pouring in at open windows. Henriette
shifted on the hot seat and tried to forget her discomfort. She
unfastened the ribbons of her straw bonnet and wished that she
might discard more than her lace mitts and shawl. She could not
sleep because of the noise and jolting motion of the train and the
annoyance of flies that lighted on her face. At first she had found
diversion in the landscape beyond the window, a world that grew
steadily greener and more pleasant as they puffed into less
populous country. But at last the glare became too strong for her
to stare steadily at rolling meadows and farms and woods, at busy
small towns and quiet villages clustered about pointing white
steeples.</p>

<p>He head ached with the throbbing vibrations of the engine and
her own anxiety that had increased with each day and night of that
week. She was ho nearer the answer that Henry expected, and she
dreaded this ordeal of family as much as she had dreaded other more
spectacular ones.</p>

<p>"Oh, why is he not alone in this world?" she thought under the
grinding rumble of wheels on endlessly stretching miles of track.
"Why must he be one of nine children, and these brothers with their
wives and their ambitions? And his father&mdash;a Puritan of the
old school, no doubt, who will believe the worst of me. I wonder if
love can surmount these difficulties?"</p>

<p>She knew now that she loved him. Yet she was not sure that this
would be enough for marriage in the New World. She had managed to
regain her lost foothold on life after misfortune had struck her
down. She had fought to win back her old independence and pride,
and though she was sure of herself again in the capacity of
teacher, she knew that the responsibilities of marriage were great
and completely unknown. She loved this impetuous, idealistic young
man too much to run the risk of failing him. Once she would have
been as eager as he to plunge headlong into the wonder and
excitement of this experience. But now she was older and wiser, and
her wisdom had been painfully acquired. Yet she longed for marriage
all the more because she had faced the impossibility of it for
herself.</p>

<p>"Only the heart knows its own boundaries." She had read that
once; it did not matter where. They were comforting words to
remember. Perhaps, she thought, even a heart could not measure its
own capacity for love.</p>

<p>She left the train in mid-afternoon and changed to another that
branched from the main line in the direction of Stockbridge. Henry
had promised to meet her part way in the family carriage. He had
explained exactly where and when to look for him, and the conductor
seemed to know all about the plan as he helped her aboard with her
bag and bandbox. Only a little longer, she told herself, before she
would see him waiting for her with that look on his face that she
both dreaded and longed to see.</p>

<p>The air was fresher now, and as the train rumbled on into the
rolling ups and downs of green country she revived. So this was the
New England from which Henry and his brothers had come! Even in
that first meeting she had felt that his roots were here, and now
she was more than ever certain of it. He belonged to these wooded
hills; these rocky half-cleared pastures where cattle grazed among
fern and juniper; these fields that sloped to quiet streams or made
rough patchwork of green and brown in the distance. The farms were
smaller than she had expected, the houses boxlike and plain beside
the great red barns that dwarfed them. But she liked their
uncompromising simplicity of line, their square chimneys and neatly
stacked woodpiles. She liked their sturdy orchards and small
gardens bright with sunflowers, phlox and delphinium, the
morning-glory and scarlet bean vines about their kitchen doors. It
was a hard-won land, where even in the lushness of summer a hint of
frost lingered like some minor chord that haunts a melody.</p>

<p>It was the haying season. Everywhere men moved with their
scythes in long, swinging strides, or tossed and piled the hay in
yellowing heaps for old blue wagons to carry from field to barn.
The air was strong with sun and fragrance. Henriette drew deep,
contented breaths and waved to a group of children as the train
slowed down at a country crossing.</p>

<p>She alighted at the appointed place&mdash;a country depot with
bales piled on a wooden platform. An old horse and buggy were tied
to a hitching-post and Henry stood beside them. They greeted each
other with shy restraint, conscious of curious glances from the
train. Even after it had rumbled on, they found it difficult to
speak. There was so much to say after seven days of separation. He
stowed away her things and helped her up, spreading a home-spun
coverlet over her lap.</p>

<p>"To keep off the dust," he told her gravely as he settled
himself beside her on the seat and took up the reins. "Giddap,
Boney."</p>

<p>"Boney?" she questioned as the white horse turned into a side
road and set off at a surprisingly brisk jog for one of such
apparent age.</p>

<p>"It's really Bonaparte," he explained with a smile. "She was
named that before she came to us, and it hardly seemed appropriate.
Boney suits her better, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Much better," Henriette agreed. "She is no longer in her first
youth, but she appears very wise."</p>

<p>"There's not is road hereabouts she doesn't know. When father
used to drive out to visit church members he could sit back and
think out his next sermon on the way home. She always brought him
back safe and sound, and it was a great comfort to mother. Boney
has travelled all over Connecticut too; but since father gave up
the church in Haddam she has got about less than she used to."</p>

<p>"Your father does not preach each Sunday now?"</p>

<p>"No, though he often fills neighbouring pulpits when there's
need. Now that he has retired and David and Jonathan and Cyrus have
put the old parsonage in order, he has leisure to revise his
sermons. Several have already been published, and more will be. By
the way, I've finished an article on certain aspects of the
Catholic Church. I want to read it to you and ask your advice
before I submit it to the <i>Evangelist."</i></p>

<p>"And your book on the Irish Rebellion. You have not laid that
aside?"</p>

<p>"No, but I was moved to set down certain arguments for and
against the Catholic Faith. It seemed the right time to express
something of my feelings. I hope it may be published. See!" He
broke off and pointed with his whip. "That's Bear Town Mountain
over there. You will be glad to know the bears have all gone."</p>

<p>"How beautiful it is, this country! You did not tell me it would
be so green, or that it would smell so sweet."</p>

<p>"It always does in haying time. I helped my brother Jonathan
pitch hay in the back meadow yesterday. It's four years since I've
done that, and I'm rather stiff so-day in consequence. Mary
Elizabeth warns me I shall grow fast to a desk if I'm not
careful."</p>

<p>"Mary Elizabeth&mdash;she is your younger sister?"</p>

<p>"She's just a year younger than I, and the only one left at home
now. But Jonathan and his family live a little way up the street,
and David and his family are in their cottage nearby for the
summer. You'll meet a lot more of us here in New England."</p>

<p>"New England," she repeated. "It is more like England certainly,
than France. Yet I feel that I could be happy here."</p>

<p>He pressed her hand. The hopeful urgency stirred so strongly in
him that it was contagious, though they were still reluctant to
give words to what they felt. It was enough happiness for the time
being to be riding together in the creaking buggy behind the old
horse. Late afternoon light slanted in long golden fingers across
hillsides and fields and between free trunks when woods closed
about the road.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, my dear?" he asked after a long silence. "Was
the journey too long?"</p>

<p>"Very long, but now I could wish this part of it would be even
longer." She leaned back with a soft sigh. "<i>Je suis tr&egrave;s
contente."</i></p>

<p><i>"Moi aussi,"</i> he responded with a fervour that made up for
his accent.</p>

<p>Near another farm they passed a lanky youth driving cows home
from pasture.".</p>

<p>"Evening, Henry," he hailed them.</p>

<p>"Evening, Seth," Henry answered, waving the whip.</p>

<p>"One of the Wells boys," he explained. "An old friend of
mine."</p>

<p>"I should hardly call him an old friend, Henri," she protested;
"rather, I should say, an early friend."</p>

<p>"You're right." He smiled. "I stand corrected."</p>

<p>The sun was setting behind the hills that enclosed the
Housatonic valley as they turned into the village street under
great arching elm trees on either side. At the far end the slim
white tip of another steeple rose above more trees; and nearer by,
the substantial houses with their lawns and gardens were all warm
with reflected brightness from the western sky. A far clock was
striking six, and the delicious smell of freshly-baked bread met
them even before they came in sight of the square brick
parsonage.</p>

<p>Boney quickened her pace from jog to spirited trot. They rattled
into the yard almost before Henriette realised that she had reached
the end of her journey. In the reunion with Henry, in the beauty
and sense of complete well-being that had taken possession of her
as they travelled those miles together, she had forgotten her
weariness and all her doubts and misgivings. Now they rose to
engulf her as she faced the meeting upon which so much depended.
For herself, she did not mind if this family disapproved of her.
She had met far too much antagonism in the last few years to be
easily dismayed. But for Henry's sake she cared to make <i>a</i>
good impression upon these people. His eyes were so loving and
anxious, she must not fail him.</p>

<p>A girl in a blue cotton dress was bending over a flower-bed; but
at the sound of wheels she set down her watering-can and came
hurrying with outstretched hands. She was young and fair, with
broad brows under smoothly parted hair and clear, thoughtful eyes
that lighted in eager responsiveness.</p>

<p>"She is kind and intelligent," Henriette decided after the
introductions were over and they walked together up the flagstone
path between orange lilies and phlox. "We shall be friends."</p>

<p>Submit Dickinson Field, mother of seven sons and two daughters,
stood in the doorway, a small woman nearing seventy in a plain
cotton dress and lawn cap and kerchief. She had been beautiful in
her youth, and in age she was still lovely to look upon with the
fine features and colour only a little dimmed by years of activity
and fulfilment. Her eyes were soft and kind in their framework of
delicate wrinkles, and her lips kept a half-smile even in repose.
"I have given my best to life," that radiant old face seemed to be
saying unconsciously, "and it has given its best to me in return.".
Henriette felt the warmth behind the greeting in the hand that
closed over her own.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said with cordial scrutiny. "Come in and rest
you. My, but you're a little body to have come across all that
water!"</p>

<p>"But I did not swim the Atlantic, you know," Henriette responded
with a smile.</p>

<p>"My boys and girls are all travellers, too," the pleasant old
voice was going on. "Emilia Ann lived ten years in Turkey;
Stephen's in California; David and Cyrus and Henry and Mary
Elizabeth here are all back from far parts; and Timothy&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off and turned away. She could never speak of this
second son without tears, for Timothy had been lost at sea
somewhere off the coast of South America fifteen years before.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on, "they all want to see far places but me.
I've been content to stay at home and let them see the world
instead."</p>

<p>"They have brought the world to you, Madame," Henriette told her
while Henry beamed upon them both.</p>

<p>("So far, so good," Henriette thought as she put on a fresh
dress and brushed her hair. "But I have not met his father.")</p>

<p>The room she had been given was simple to the point of bareness,
but the curtains and bed linen were snowy white, the home-made rugs
and blankets woven in plain, soft colours. The bed, the chest of
drawers, the washstand and two chairs were of cherry and maple. She
liked the variation from the mahogany, walnut, and rosewood of city
houses. There was no wardrobe, merely a row of wooden pegs for her
dresses, and the mirror was very small. Evidently the matter of
feminine adornment played little part in this household. Yet both
mother and daughter had been appropriately and freshly dressed, and
one of them must have taken pains to arrange the glass vase of
flowers on the chest. She fastened a tea rose in the ruffles of her
green and white muslin before she answered the ringing of the
supper bell. Henry waited at the foot of the stairs to conduct her
to his father. The pressure of his hand was reassuring, though she
also felt that he was bracing himself for the meeting.</p>

<p>The Reverend David Dudley Field had a presence that filled the
house with Old Testament dignity, though he was less tall and
commanding than she had expected. As he rose from his chair to
greet her, Henriette was struck by the spare erectness of his
figure and by the angular beauty of his features. The silver-white
hair that almost touched his shoulders grew away from the high dome
of forehead that dominated the whole face. The eyes were deep-set
and searching. Later she was to discover that they were blue and
capable of kindness as well as intensity, but on that first meeting
they appeared dark and almost fanatical under jutting grey brows.
For the rest, his nose was long, large and straight; the cheekbones
high, the chin, sharply prominent, and the mouth tight-lipped. A
sombre austerity wrapped him like a mantle, and behind that stern
old face the flame of the spirit was almost visible. So, Henriette
thought, the prophets of old must have looked&mdash;Isaiah, Ezekiel
and Jeremiah. He would never falter in performing whatever the Lord
might call upon him to do. Almost she believed him capable of
sacrificing a son or a daughter to the Will of God, as Abraham had
been called upon to offer up Isaac.</p>

<p>Yet he turned fond eyes upon his two children and spoke grave
words of welcome to their guest.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Field"&mdash;he addressed his wife as formally as if they
were not nearing the completion of fifty years of married
life&mdash;"let us go in to supper now, for Henry and I must
uncover the young melon plants before dark."</p>

<p>Henriette stood with bowed head at her place while he delivered
the blessing before their meal. He seemed, she thought, to be
speaking with an intimate Presence to whom he was used to confiding
the simple details of garden and barn as well as more complex
matters of the spirit.</p>

<p>Supper, in this New England household, delighted her with its
simple perfection. Fresh bread and butter and cottage cheese; a
platter of cold meat; a pitcher of milk and a bowl of strawberries
were spread on the table with its white cloth and willow-ware
china. A country girl who helped in the kitchen took her place
among them as a matter of course and was included in the family
conversation.</p>

<p>"Jonathan raised these strawberries," Mrs. Field explained with
pride. "He's promised us a mess of early peas soon. I expect you've
had them for weeks in New York. The season's later up here in
Berkshire. Jonathan's very pleased with his garden. He'll want to
show it to you, Miss Desportes."</p>

<p>Mary Elizabeth was almost as eager as Henry to talk of world
affairs. She had travelled with Cyrus and his wife and showed
unusual gifts of observation and insight in her questions and
comments. Besides studying the classics under her father's
instruction, she had attended a female institute in Albany. Like
Henry, she expressed herself well, and Henriette discovered that
she had already contributed a number of articles to newspapers upon
her foreign experiences. It was pleasant to compare personal
reactions to European cities, and to discuss the latest news from
France, Italy and England. Between Mary Elizabeth and her father a
peculiar bond existed. Though he seldom joined in the conversation,
Henriette noticed that he listened with interest and watched this
youngest daughter with tender regard. Once only he addressed their
visitor directly, and she was startled by his reference to Paris
and by his giving the French pronunciation to her name.</p>

<p>"I found Paris a beautiful city, Mademoiselle Desportes," he
remarked. "There were great extremes of poverty and vice as against
ostentation and luxury, but no more than in other capitals, and the
French people impressed me by their buoyancy and thrift and by
their good manners."</p>

<p>His son and daughter exchanged amused glances.</p>

<p>"We never worried about father wandering the streets of Paris by
himself," Henry explained. "Stephen told me that someone always
brought him back to their hotel if he lost his way."</p>

<p>Henriette thought that such a remarkable old face would have
awed any Frenchman into respectful solicitude. Yet she felt before
him something of what she had felt when she had faced the Judge and
Chancellor in the courtroom. It was as if his austere goodness made
others turn inner scrutiny upon their own shortcomings One felt
this Minister of the Gospel not only had been chosen to exhort the
faithful, but also had been endowed with an almost supernatural
power to wrestle with the hosts of Satan. Her own worthiness was
about to be tested by unflinching standards. Woe to her if she
should be found wanting in his eyes.</p>

<p>They rose from the table. Henry and his father went out to the
garden. Mary Elizabeth and the helper went into the kitchen to wash
and wipe the dishes, while Henriette and her hostess repaired to
the parlour. An overflowing work-basket was brought out, and Mrs.
Field drew close to the window to make the most of the failing
light. Henriette watched her bent over yarn and knitting needles as
a woollen sock lengthened under her busy old fingers.</p>

<p>"Yes," she looked up and smiled, "I can knit socks with my eyes
shut, all but turning heels. My sons still like to wear the kind I
make. I used to be a good hand at spinning wool and flax when I was
younger, but with the mills turning out such good cloth, it hardly
pays to do your own weaving nowadays. I make my husband's shirts
still, and I always wash and starch them and his stocks myself.
These socks are for Stephen in California," she added, holding out
the half-finished piece of knitting; "but dear knows how long it
will take to send them so far!"</p>

<p>Henriette offered to help with some mending, but her hostess
would not hear of it.</p>

<p>"No, no, you sit and rest yourself. This first evening it's your
privilege to be idle. To-morrow you can lend me a hand with a quilt
I'm patching if you've a mind to and Henry makes no objection.
He'll want to take you calling, maybe. He's told every one on both
sides of the street all about you."</p>

<p>"Henri is too kind and generous, Madame," she ventured. "I am
sometimes fearful that he does not see faults in those he&mdash;"
She broke off, not wishing to commit herself too far.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, he believes the best of every one. All Henry's
geese were swans when he was little, and now he's a man it's the
same way. Not that I mean you by that," she added with her wise,
disarming smile.</p>

<p>"Henri has&mdash;has told you of me?"</p>

<p>"There, I can never get used to your saying his name in French.
Makes him sound so outlandish, some way, but I guess he likes to
hear you do it. Yes, whatever you do and say suits him. I've known
that a long time now. He's told us plenty about you and your
troubles, too. You've had more'n your share, but I hope you've seen
the last of 'em."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Henriette was touched by the genuineness of the old
woman's sympathy. "My troubles seem very far off here in your house
where it is so serene and comfortable. I do not wish to bring them
into your midst, for I have respect for a family such as yours, and
though it would be an honour to become a part of it, perhaps I have
no right&mdash;after what has happened. There are many who believe
the worst of me, Madame, things that I could not even speak about
to you. To the day I die this tragedy will be with me. I cannot
unravel the tangle of my life and knit it over again as you might
unravel that yarn in your hands."</p>

<p>"I guess there's not a one of us but would like to pick up a few
dropped stitches," the kind voice answered as the needles clicked
on in the gathering twilight. "No, you're not the first to wish you
could make over the past, and you won't be the last, if that's any
comfort. But I say, never put the past between yourself and the
future. If Henry loves you and you love him, that's for you both to
decide."</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame, your life has been sweet and good and beautiful
with no dark places to mar it. I can see that, and so perhaps you
do not know what evil things the world can say and think. Suppose,
for argument's sake, that I had committed grave wrong. Would you
wish your son to marry such a woman, then?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather see a son of mine married to a woman that loved
him&mdash;" The needles stayed poised in stillness before the voice
went on in soft conviction: "Yes, I'd rather he did, even if she
might have fallen from grace, than to have him marry without love.
There, don't you ever press me so hard again, and never let Mr.
Field hear me say such a thing. It's heresy, maybe, but women know
some things that men can never fathom, for all their learning."</p>

<p>Mary Elizabeth came in just then, and their conversation ended.
After she had set an oil lamp on the table she brought a large
Bible, which she laid in readiness.</p>

<p>"Father and Henry are through in the garden," she told her
mother. "They're washing up in the kitchen and will be ready for
prayers in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Presently the two men and the young household helper appeared
and took their places about the table. Mrs. Field laid down her
work and joined them. It was absolutely still in the cool parlour,
except for the fitful, sleepy calling of birds in nearby trees. The
lamplight threw a warm circle about the reverent small group, and a
heavy sweetness from rose bushes laden with bloom came in through
the open windows.</p>

<p>"Let us turn to the Book of Proverbs for our evening lesson."
The Reverend David Dudley Field took up the Bible and began to turn
its worn leaves. Deep and compelling as the tones of a bell, his
voice reached out to the farthest corners of that quiet room.</p>

<p><i>"Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that
he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil
all the days of her life. She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh
willingly with her hands. She is like the merchants' ships; she
bringeth her food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet night,
and giveth meat to her household..."</i>
</p>

<p>Henriette kept her eyes fixed on the folded hands in her lap.
She dared not raise them to the face of the preacher, or to Henry,
whose look would have been too hopeful for her to bear. She could
only listen with the blood throbbing at her temples, knowing that
she had been singled out for this particular challenge.</p>

<p><i>"With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard..." The
words continued. "Her candle goeth not out by night. She layeth her
hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. She
stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her
hands to the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her
household..."</i>
</p>

<p>A great grey-green moth fluttered close to the lamp. But the
voice did not falter. Henriette looked up and saw the hand that
brushed it away. In the light that long forefinger made her think
of those solemnly pointed New England steeples. She was struck by
the resemblance.</p>

<p><i>"Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
elders in the land...Strength and honour are her clothing; and she
shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the
ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her
children shall arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou
excellest them all. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a
woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of the
fruit of her hands; and let her own words praise her in the
gates."</i>
</p>

<p>Long after prayers were over and they had gone their separate
ways for the night, Henriette lay in the darkness, hearing the echo
of those verses from Proverbs. They mingled strangely with the
faint guttural of frogs in some far meadow and the chirping of
crickets like summer's own throbbing pulse. Yes, she knew why
Henry's father had chosen that passage. She and he understood each
other all too well, though gulfs of age and tradition and differing
beliefs separated them.</p>

<p>"Search your heart, O strange woman," were the words he had been
asking her, "and see if you can do all this for my son."</p>

<h3>Chapter Twenty-Nine</h3>

<p>The days in Stockbridge were a revelation to Henriette. She was
revived by the clear, enlivening air with every breath she drew,
and no less revived by contacts with the remarkable personalities
gathered into this narrow valley folded in by the Berkshire Hills.
She had not yet heard the principle of "plain living and high
thinking," but she felt it here in the homes to which Henry brought
her. He beamed with undisguised pride as he conducted her from
house to house along that elm-shaded street or drove her to
outlying homesteads in the pleasant countryside. Everywhere
hospitable doors were thrown open, and the Dwights, the Cannings,
the Williamses, the Sedgwicks and other neighbours made her
welcome, first because the son of their former pastor had seen fit
to bring her with him, and later because a congeniality of mind and
interests had sprung up instantly between them.</p>

<p>They knew the world, these New England men and women, who had
read and travelled widely, and who were as well informed upon the
latest news from the Continent as upon country doings. She knew
that they must be aware of her identity and of her connection with
the Praslin case. Many perhaps disapproved of her part in it, yet
there was no hint of this in their cordiality. Some dropped into
French with her, and the sound of her native tongue spoken in so
different a setting was a continual amazement and delight.</p>

<p>There was a memorable all-day excursion to Monument Mountain
with a dozen congenial spirits. They drove as far as the road could
take them, then climbed the last steep stretch on foot and ate
lunches from baskets. Half the countryside lay spread out below
them, looped and laced by the pale thread of the Housatonic. There
was an adventurous trip to the sunless depths of Ice Glen, where
the ladies of the little party squeezed through the narrow rock
caves in their full skirts with considerable excitement. There was
another outdoor luncheon on the shores of the Stockbridge Bowl at
which particularly lively conversation flourished. The Charles
Sedgwicks came from Lenox, with Miss Catharine Sedgwick, the author
of <i>Hope Leslie</i> and <i>The Linwoods,</i> those picturesque
novels of domestic life in New England. Henriette found this plump,
plainly-dressed woman in the sixties stimulating company with her
shrewd and witty comments on matters foreign and domestic. They
discussed Thackeray's latest work, <i>Pendennis,</i> and compared
their reactions to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's newly published
<i>Sonnets from the Portuguese.</i> Both were admirers of the
poetess, but Henriette was forced to confess that she had not read
the works of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne, the novelist from Salem, who
ranked, to Miss Sedgwick's mind, with the foremost fiction writers
of Europe. With the sister-in-law, Elizabeth Sedgwick, she
exchanged views on educational methods, for this woman's Berkshire
school for girls had won an enviable reputation.</p>

<p>She listened intently to Judge Sedgwick and David Dudley Field
taking opposite sides on points of legal controversy. She prompted
Henry tactfully when he held forth on those days of revolution in
Paris when barricades had been set up and the palaces stormed. And
then there was the visitor from Boston, a lawyer named Sumner,
whose words struck like sparks when he spoke of slavery in the
southern states. They could not long avoid that subject, for
agitation over Henry Clay's Fugitive Slave Act was in the very air
they breathed. Henry had talked of it, but it was Sumner's
eloquence that kindled her indignation. Compromise, he insisted,
could never be effective. To have admitted California as a free
state was only a concession to northern sentiments. It could never
compensate for this greater concession to the South&mdash;the
Fugitive Slave Act that not only prohibited aiding escaped slaves,
but required citizens of free states to capture such fugitives and
return them to their slave owners. Who could keep such a law to the
letter, he asked them, and not be guilty of committing a crime
against all their principles of liberty and the rights of
man&mdash;white or black? His fiery appeal stirred her as she had
not guessed she could be stirred by the politics of these unknown
United States.</p>

<p>The party broke up in the late afternoon, still arguing,
discussing and comparing views.</p>

<p>"You did not tell me, Henri"&mdash;Henriette turned to him with
mock reproach before the group scattered&mdash;"that I should find
here a new Parnassus, and drink at the Castalian spring!"</p>

<p>They were pleased to have her compare their mountain and
countryside to the ancient abode of the Muses. Her enthusiasm was
contagious, and even those who had been prejudiced and sceptical of
her before found themselves disarmed by her quick comments and by
the unexpected facets of her mind. They responded to her wit and
repartee, and if they were slightly startled, not to say shocked,
when she raised her skirts higher than propriety allowed to scratch
a mosquito bite, they reminded one another that Mademoiselle
Desportes was French and therefore to be allowed certain
liberties.</p>

<p>"These mosquitoes," she remarked with a vigorous slap to
emphasise her feelings, "they do bite my legs!"</p>

<p>Henry saw nothing out of the way in her naturalness. In his eyes
her every move and word were perfection. He moved at her side in a
blissful trance or waited impatiently for her coming when they were
separated. Pride and wonder in her filled his days and nights,
making him more absent-minded than usual. His mother smiled and his
sister shook her head over his lapses, but his father took no part
in their tolerant amusement. His presence was a shadow that lay
long and disturbing across the sunny greenness of those days.
Henriette knew that, for all his polite hospitality, this stern old
man was not reconciled to her presence.</p>

<p>In a way she liked him better for that. His reserved and
unflinching standards were in keeping with the strictness of his
own moral code. He had more power and strength than all his
vigorous family, and because she had learned through adversity to
be strong and uncompromising herself, Henriette understood and
honoured him. Sometimes, when his lips tightened and that sudden
flame lighted behind the clear gravity of his deep-set blue eyes,
she was conscious of strange conflicts beneath the quiet exterior,
conflicts that rose from the core of his being like stirrings of a
hidden volcano. He had not won his peace without struggle. She
still suspected him of wrestling with the Devil and all his hosts.
No, she did not smile at the hell-fire and brimstone convictions
which her more liberal generation could not share. She did not
condemn him for hardness, since hardness was something she had come
to respect. She did not think of this old minister as narrow or
bigoted, but rather she recognised him as one who had set up more
exacting rules and obligations for himself to follow in the game of
life. He had not yet accepted her into the circle of those who
carried on the heritage of his flesh and bones. She would have to
convince him of her right to belong there, and so he quickened the
challenge she had come prepared to meet. Until he gave the signal
she would wait. And she must keep Henry waiting although his
urgency was growing pathetic.</p>

<p>Jonathan Edward Field lived in a low wooden house half-way up
the street with his children. His wife had died a year before, and
already it was rumoured that he would marry again. This brother
Henriette found genial and easy to know. Like the older sons, he
was large-framed, with reddish hair and ruddy skin. He had studied
law in David's firm, had practised it later in Michigan, and he now
took part in county politics. But his heart was in the land that
had called him back. Henriette went almost daily to his home,
helping to gather berries and vegetables in the garden, making
friends with his two sturdy sons and pretty daughters.</p>

<p>David Dudley lived on the Hill, a steep shoulder of green that
rose directly behind the village street. His acres were impressive
in beauty and richness of growth. Trees old and young grew about
the large rambling house that was in marked contrast to the more
compact, older dwellings in the valley. His son and daughter were
there, back from college and European travel, eager to exchange
views and experiences with a former resident of Paris.</p>

<p>This older brother and his wife were less formal in their
country home than in the New York atmosphere. Henriette pleased
David Dudley by her appreciation of the scenery he loved. Nature
was this busy lawyer's relaxation and delight. Henry saw trees as
vague mounds of green foliage, but to this brother each leaf and
twig, each peculiar marking of bark and branch took on vital
significance. He pointed out every variation to Henriette, praising
her artist's eye that was quick to learn names and shapes, that
never mistook maple for elm or confused birch with ash and beech.
On a corner of his property stood a small frame house, square and
weathered, but with crude dignity to the carving about the door.
This was the Mission House that had been built more than a century
before from oaks hewn in what was then a wilderness. It had housed
John Sergeant, man of rare gifts and learning, who had answered the
call to bring the Gospel to the Stockbridge Indians. As long as he
lived, David Dudley Field told her, it should be preserved, a
tangible reminder of the spirit that had first blessed the
valley.</p>

<p>"Yes," Henriette had agreed, laying her hand on the solid wooden
door and bending to peer at the worn sill over which the feet of
white and red men alike had passed. "The spirit lingers here. One
feels if good or if evil has been done in a place. I could ask
nothing better than to live in such a house."</p>

<p>From there she and Henry often walked along the crest of the
hill where the road ran between pasture and steep fields that
sloped to the clustered houses of the village.</p>

<p>"If there is a more beautiful prospect than this," he told her
on one of their visits to the Hill, "I have not yet seen it.
Perhaps it is because most of my childhood is bound up with this
place that I feel as I do. When father used to read of the Holy
Hill I always pictured it something like this."</p>

<p>Later he pointed out to her a great granite boulder that rose
high on the crest and commanded a wide view of the valley, the
nearer green hills, and the more distant purple ones. Some ancient
cataclysm had split the rock almost in half, and in that deep cleft
a maple tree had taken root and grown in vigour.</p>

<p>"I used to come and sit for hours here," he confessed shyly,
"and think all the things that boys think. I learned the Greek
alphabet under this tree, and once when I was very young I preached
a sermon standing here all alone with my bare feet braced in that
crack. A family of robins nesting nearby were my only congregation,
and I'm afraid they were not greatly impressed by my theology."</p>

<p>She turned to him in quick response, smiling fondly at the
picture he drew,</p>

<p>"Ah, my little Henri," she said, "you were young to feel the
call! I should like to have known you then, but I can almost see
you so, like a child of St. Francis. Come, let us go down to your
first pulpit."</p>

<p>They sat for a long time on the boulder with the stubborn-rooted
maple shading them from the afternoon sun. Shadows deepened in the
green hollow of fields below. The delicate silver coil of river was
bright and smoke rose, blue and faint, from the chimneys of houses
that already she had come to know and call by name. At the far end
of the street the white steeple of the old meeting-house dominated
the scene. It must, she thought, have marked Henry for its own long
ago, though he had been unaware of it.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, Henriette?" He leaned towards her
with his loving serious face that still seemed boyish to her as on
the occasion of their first meeting, though now she knew every
characteristic change of expression that could take him. "You have
grown so silent."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of you, Henri, and a little of myself, too, and
how strange that we should be here together. I am almost afraid
when I think of it, and I must believe that it is not by mere
chance that we have come to this place, to this stone that is older
than any living thing, that will be here long after we are both
gone. It is like&mdash;like a sign to us&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off and laid her hand caressingly on the rough
lichened surface beside her, warm in the sun.</p>

<p>"'A house built upon a rock.'" Henry's hand closed over hers,
and he drew closer. "Ours must be like that. No, my dear, it was
not chance that carried me so far to be near you in your time of
trial, and it was not chance that brought you across the water to
me. We must never be afraid to think of it, even though it is
beyond our understanding. Only fools could be so blind as to doubt
a Divine Providence, and this rock shall be our sign, as you
say."</p>

<p>"But, Henri, to think that Divine Providence should single us
out of a world of people! It is too much for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," he echoed simply, "it is too much."</p>

<p>He dared to kiss her then for the first time with the familiar
hills and valley, the grey boulder, the maple tree and the ghost of
his boyhood for witnesses. She closed her eyes and let past and
present and future mingle in a daze of incredulous delight. Over
the warm response of her senses the air blew fresh and fragrant
with the spices of summer. In her ears the hum of unseen insects
was clamorous as the louder beating of her heart, of that other
heart so close to her own.</p>

<p>He had been a boy to her till that moment, but now the pressure
of his lips and arms told her that he was a man, needing her as she
had despaired of ever being needed. The long, lonely years of
waiting fell away like dried forgotten fruit crowded from orchard
boughs in the miracle of spring bloom. She did not question the
miracle in herself, though it had come out of its appointed season.
The sweet unused sap of her youth rose the stronger in her because
it had retreated before treacherous frosts. In sudden wonder and
thankfulness she knew that early blight had not killed, but only
deferred, her blossoming.</p>

<p>They hardly felt the road ruts under their feet as they
descended the hill with an orange sunset flaring before them. They
did not speak till they came in sight of the Parsonage.</p>

<p>"You will let me tell them to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, Henri, not yet."</p>

<p>"But why? Whether we speak or not, they will feel our
happiness." Still she shook her head.</p>

<p>"Your father," she reminded him. "He is not yet ready for this.
No, do not say that he is. I know better."</p>

<p>Reluctantly he agreed, though it was difficult for him to
contain his feelings.</p>

<p>They ate supper hurriedly, for they had been invited to attend a
gathering at the Sedgwick home in Lenox and would drive there with
David Dudley and his family. The reception was to be in honour of
the great actress Fanny Kemble, who spent her summers in a cottage
nearby. Henriette dressed with particular care. In a happy trance
she put on her best cream-coloured mull with bands of moss-green
trimmings, made over a green under body. The neck was, perhaps, cut
lower than village standards allowed, so she added her black lace
scarf and let her hair fall in ringlets at either side of her face.
Peering in the square of looking-glass before she went downstairs
to join Henry, she was startled by her own reflection. It was not
merely that her eyes were brighter and her cheeks more flushed than
usual. A new softness, an inner radiance had taken her features, so
that they seemed strange to her. She had seen this in others, but
she had never hoped to see it in herself.</p>

<p>Henry looked his best, too, she thought, as she slipped her arm
in his, and felt the swift, possessive touch of his hand closing
upon hers.</p>

<p>The five-mile drive through the fragrance of early evening was a
delight. She hardly knew what others said or what she answered as
the horses trotted on and on. Henry was silent beside her, but it
was a silence that they continued to share. As darkness deepened
about them they touched hands now and again, not for reassurance so
much as for the sheer delight of feeling that incredible response.
The lights of the Sedgwick house streamed out to meet them, and
guests were already arriving on foot or alighting at the broad
stone carriage step by the hitching-post, where a lantern hung in
festive anticipation of the evening.</p>

<p>And what an evening it was, from the moment they crossed that
threshold till the last carriages clattered off through the quiet
of the sleeping countryside! The Sedgwicks welcomed their guests
with such gracious ease of hospitality, making as much of townsfolk
as of their more distinguished visitors. Henriette found herself
talking with animation not only to Mr. Charles Sumner, whom she had
already met, but to the Boston lawyer Rufus Choate, to President
Mark Hopkins of Williams College, and to an older poet and editor,
William Cullen Bryant, with a handsome bearded face that reminded
her of a Michael Angelo head. Henry had spoken with awe of this
Massachusetts-born poet and of the great power he exerted as part
owner of the New York <i>Evening Post;</i> but Henriette was not in
the least awed by his appearance or the weight of his editorial
influence. She found him friendly and eager to listen to her
comments.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Desportes," he had said at their introduction,
giving her a long look of interested approval, "I have long wished
to take you by the hand."</p>

<p>"Here it is, Monsieur Bry-<i>ant</i>," she had said, smiling up
into the dignity and benevolence of his face. "I am happy to take
the hand that could pen 'To a Waterfowl.' You did not know,
perhaps, that my pupils in France once ordered me to translate it
from English into French. That is how I came to know how great a
poet you are."</p>

<p>"Repeat it to me, mademoiselle," he had urged.</p>

<p>"No, not here with so many people. But I will write it down for
you if you will promise not to be critical."</p>

<p>He promised, charmed by her vivacity and her quick Parisian
shrug.</p>

<p>"You express yourself in English far more easily than I speak
French," he confessed. "I can read it; but the accent!" He smiled
and sighed. "My spirit is willing enough, but my tongue is
weak."</p>

<p>They laughed together, and then he went on more seriously:</p>

<p>"I meant what I said just now, mademoiselle, from my heart. I
have long wanted to tell you of my admiration for the way in which
you conducted yourself in that terrible calamity. As a newspaper
man I followed your testimony to the smallest detail, and now that
we meet I know that my respect was well deserved. I only hope that
America will not disappoint you in the future it offers."</p>

<p>"I thank you," she acknowledged his praise. "You will
understand, since you already know so much of my past, why I wish
only to live in the future, and in the present," she added with a
quick smile of appreciation, "which it seems to me could not be
improved upon."</p>

<p>They talked for some time together. He, too, had spent his youth
in New England, he told her, and he often returned to Great
Barrington, where he had studied and practised law in his twenties,
snatching such leisure as he could to write poetry, He was eager to
hear her impressions of America; to draw out her comparisons
between Paris and New York. By the time Henry joined them she and
this poet; editor were already friends.</p>

<p>"I believe you know him better in ten minutes than most people
would in ten years," he whispered fondly. "He's considered very
grave and dignified, but he laughed at something you said just now.
Come this way. Catharine Sedgwick tells me Mrs. Kemble will give
her reading in the back parlour, and you must not miss a single
word or expression."</p>

<p>Henry had already heard the great actress give one of her
readings, but Henriette had not been able to attend the
performances in New York the winter before. It seemed extraordinary
to have journeyed to this remote village to enjoy the privilege of
meeting this famous daughter of England's most famous theatrical
family. But here she was&mdash;a superb, glowing creature whose
very presence made a stage of the floorboards on which she stepped,
whose voice seemed to vibrate with the lost tones of her Aunt Sarah
Siddons. One forgot a certain heaviness of feature in the spirited
flash of brilliant dark eyes, in the sensitive quiver of lips and
nostrils.</p>

<p>"She is more than beautiful," Henriette whispered to Henry as
they watched her take her place at a small table by the bay window.
"She shines like that 'rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear.'"</p>

<p>She was most curious to see this woman to whom she felt drawn by
the bonds of common misfortune. Both had shared scandal and censure
and weathered the storm of personal shipwreck. Henriette, like all
the others gathered under that roof, knew Fanny Kemble's tragedy
and the courage with which she had surmounted it. They were all
aware of her early meteoric rise to the position of foremost
actress of her day on both sides of the Atlantic, of her retirement
from the stage at the height of her success to marry the prominent
Philadelphian, Pierce Butler, whose clash with her views concerning
marriage and slavery on his Georgia plantation had ended in a
humiliating divorce case and enforced separation from her two
daughters. She, too, had met slander alone. She had stood in the
ruins of all that she had built her hopes upon, and had not been
crushed by the weight of its collapse. Overbearing, generous,
tactless, and inspired by turns, Fanny Kemble the vivid and
unpredictable raised her proud dark head, and a hush fell on those
sedate New England parlours.</p>

<p>Only the art of Rachel had moved Henriette to such answering
emotion. To-night, with her senses keyed to the highest pitch of
intensity, she missed not a single shade of meaning, not one
exquisite inflection of that compelling voice. Now it was Titania
conjured up before them, the symbol of all foolish deluded
womankind; now it was blundering Bottom; and now Ophelia, wringing
all their hearts. "There's rosemary, that's for remembrance..." The
eyes and voice of another woman stirred Henriette to old pain even
in the warm security of new joy. She knew that she, too, must carry
rosemary with her to the grave.</p>

<p>And then it was Macbeth who appeared before them, waylaid by the
Weird Sisters on a Scottish heath. Henriette felt Henry shift
uncomfortably beside her as the murder approached. She saw Miss
Sedgwick look anxiously in her direction and several guests
exchange meaning glances. She kept her composure, knowing that her
kind hostess and Henry must be wishing that Fanny Kemble had not
selected this play out of all the rest.</p>

<blockquote>"Duncan is in his grave;<br>
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;<br>
Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,<br>
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing<br>
Can touch him further."</blockquote>

<p>The past rose suddenly to overwhelm her. She forgot the friendly
faces all about, the crickets chirping in the peaceful country
stillness beyond the windows. She was back in Paris with the cry of
"Murder" ringing in her ears.</p>

<blockquote>"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,<br>
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,<br>
Raze out the written troubles of the brain<br>
And with some sweet oblivious antidote<br>
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff<br>
Which weighs upon the heart?"</blockquote>

<p>She trembled, hearing that cry that might once have been her
own. Later in the evening she was presented to Fanny Kemble.</p>

<p>"Ah, Madame Kemble," she said, "there will be many to praise you
to-night, but only I of all who are gathered here can perhaps know
the true greatness of your art, for I have lived some of the drama
you interpreted. I shall not trust myself to your 'Macbeth'
again."</p>

<p>She did not sleep well that night. The varying emotions of those
hours had been too much for her, and when the' sun brightened the
eastern window she rose and dressed herself. This was to be the
last day of her visit, and she knew it would be filled with
activity. She wished to make some gift to Henry's parents before
her leave-taking, and she had decided upon enlarging a drawing of
the house. She would go out and work upon it now before the
household was astir. With her crayons and sketch-book in hand she
stole downstairs. No doors were locked in the village. She slipped
out alone into the morning freshness.</p>

<p>Dew brushed her ankles in chillness as she moved across the
grass. The knobs of half-ripened apples fallen under an old tree
were silvered with wet. Only robins marked her coming as she spread
out her work on a bench under a tree near the vegetable patch. From
here she liked the angle of the square brick house among its trees.
Her hands moved with swift skill, outlining and blocking in flat
colour masses, preparatory to shading. She had been busy for some
time before she heard the village clock strike six. The sun grew
warmer on her shoulder and the parsonage chimney sent up a fresh
blue feather of smoke. Someone must be astir in the kitchen, though
the family would not gather for morning prayers and breakfast till
seven. By that time she hoped to have finished her little
study.</p>

<p>Just then a figure emerged from, the house, and she recognised
the spare frame and white hair of old Dr. Field. He carried some
gardening tools and a basket as he came towards her between the
rows of potatoes, beans and peas. His eyes were fixed on the
hillside beyond, and when he was within some fifty yards of where
she sat she saw him set down his implements, fold his hands and bow
his head. His lips moved in what she knew must be prayer, though if
he uttered words she was too far off to hear them. He was almost at
her side before she startled him with a greeting.</p>

<p>"Yes, a beautiful day," he agreed. "I have just thanked God for
it. I see that your hands are already busy with your gift of
delineation. That is good. One who greets the early morning as a
friend will not squander the future."</p>

<p>"Are you always up at this hour, Monsieur Field?"</p>

<p>"I find it the best time to work here in my garden," he
explained gravely, "for it is after all a small counterpart of the
world, and one must labour without ceasing that good may overcome
evil."</p>

<p>"Is it that you mean by evil these armies of weeds that would
choke your plants and vines?"</p>

<p>"Weeds, yes, and caterpillars and potato bugs&mdash;surely
instruments of evil, if I may be permitted to say so."</p>

<p>Grimly he bent to capture one of the invaders on a potato
plant.</p>

<p>Such a remark from another would have sounded ludicrous, but
this old patriarch lent dignity even to garden pests.</p>

<p>"But, monsieur," she persisted, "the caterpillar and the bug are
not doing evil in their own eyes. How do you justify that in your
destruction of them?"</p>

<p>He gave her the faint suggestion of a smile.</p>

<p>"The laws of life are hard to explain," he said, "but we must
believe that we have greater potentialities for good than the
insect in the grass."</p>

<p>She laid down her work and looked into his eyes with sudden
directness.</p>

<p>"There is another question, Monsieur Field," she began, "one
which I have wished to ask you ever since I came here to stay in
your home. You do not accept your son's love for me or my love for
him. Is it because you believe I am not all that a woman should
be?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me what only your own conscience can
answer?"</p>

<p>"Because that is not enough. I have come to see that such a
family as yours is like a living tree whose branches may reach out
in different directions but are all bound to the same roots. I
would never wish to separate you from your son, for that would be
striking a blow at both the root and the branch. I must know from
your own lips to-day whether you are reconciled to a marriage
between us."</p>

<p>"I know that you have undergone great suffering." He seated
himself on the bench beside her, but his voice was still grave and
detached. "Henry has told me of the evil that engulfed you, and
that you proved your innocence."</p>

<p>"But unless I can prove that to you, I am still guilty in your
eyes."</p>

<p>"I see that you believe me a harsh man." His eyes searched her
keenly from their deep sockets. "Perhaps I am. Yet I continually
remind myself: 'Judge not, that ye be not judged.'"</p>

<p>"Let me put my question differently, then. Suppose, on some path
where I walk, I dislodge a pebble from its place and a flood is
loosed in consequence. Do you believe that the hand or foot that
moved the stone is responsible for the calamity? Must we pay the
penalty for great evil that has come through some act of
carelessness or omission?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You seek an answer that would try the wisdom of Solomon,
Mademoiselle Desportes; and I, alas, am not Solomon."</p>

<p>A long silence fell between them, broken only by the call of
robin and the distant lustiness of a village rooster.</p>

<p>"Shall we pray here together?" he spoke at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, please."</p>

<p>She folded her hands and closed her eyes and heard his voice as
if it were part of that summer morning.</p>

<p>"O Almighty and Merciful God, who knowest the secrets of all
hearts and whether there be good or evil therein, look upon this
Thy servant and this Thy daughter as they call upon Thee in the
shadow of Thy hills. For Thou hast seen fit to bring her from afar
through the troubled waters of grief and humiliation. Free her of
old doubts and bitternesses, that she may in strength and joy use
the gifts Thou hast bestowed in the new life opening before her.
Bless her and keep her and him whom Thou hast also blessed. May
their deeds be acceptable in Thy sight, and may Thy Spirit move
them all the days of their lives. Amen."</p>

<p>He rose, but still he lingered by the bench, obviously
struggling to say something more. It was far easier, Henriette
guessed, for him to express himself in prayer than in the more
casual words of daily speech.</p>

<p>"I should like to feel that I had your blessing also," she
ventured. "It is yours." He took the hand she held out to him.
Then, still holding it, his firm lips relaxed into a smile, and he
added: "I think you are quite capable of answering your own
questions, my daughter." "Oh!" Her voice was a little tremulous
with relief. "Do you call me that because you are a Minister of
God, or because you are Henri's father?"</p>

<p>His eyes were gentle as they met hers.</p>

<p>"Henry's father and the Minister of God will always be one and
the same man, I hope," he reminded her as he turned back to the
potato patch.</p>

<h2>PART III.<br>
Mrs. Henry M. Field<br>
1851-1875</h2>

<h3>Chapter Thirty</h3>

<p>On a bleak grey day in the autumn of 1851 the Reverend Henry M.
Field led his wife to the door of their new home in West
Springfield, Massachusetts. He was jubilant as he pressed her arm
in a surge of affection while they stood together in the empty
hall.</p>

<p>"Ours, my dear," he whispered. "Our first home, and you will
make it beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes, my little Henri." Her hand was cold in his, and she hoped
he would not notice the shiver she could not suppress under the
folds of her cashmere shawl. "I will try, but you must not expert a
miracle."</p>

<p>"You have made me expect them."</p>

<p>His face still glowed, and he continued to see her rather than
the narrow hall with the four rooms opening from it in sombre
bareness. They had been married since May, and the summer had
passed swiftly. They were still incredulous of their joy in each
other; of the wonder of days and nights together without dread of
parting; of the revelation of shared thoughts and intimacies.</p>

<p>Henry had managed a leave of absence from the church duties he
had assumed in this Connecticut River community during that winter
of waiting for Henriette to finish her classes in Gramercy Park.
After their quiet wedding and some weeks of travel they had been
glad to accept David's offer to spend the summer in the Mission
House on the Mill. Life had been simple and idyllic there with the
days and nights unfolding before them like the soft procession of
flowers in meadow and garden.</p>

<p>It had been easier than Henriette expected to be part of this
large and dominant circle. The Field brothers, and more
particularly their wives, had not been enthusiastic she knew, over
her entrance into the family. But once Henry had convinced them of
his determination to marry this woman of foreign speech and ways
and rather too great notoriety, they had accepted the inevitable
and had been kind. If they regretted the marriage in private, they
were loyal in public; and between the old minister and his French
daughter-in-law there was complete accord.</p>

<p>The summer had been happy, even on certain days when Henriette
could not help reminding herself that there must be many advantages
to marrying an orphan. But she liked the companionship of young
nieces and nephews, who appeared at strange hours with strange
requests of their new relative, who had instantly been adopted as
"Aunt Henrietta." She had enjoyed the excursions to remotely
situated friends and relatives, the little parties in her honour,
and trips to the city to choose furniture for the new home. Then
there had been the excitement of letters from abroad, overflowing
with felicitations. The Monod brothers were overjoyed by the
marriage, for which they claimed to be responsible. Albert and
Marie sent good wishes by every other ship, and across the Channel
her old pupil, Nina Hislop, extended invitations to visit her in
England. But the response from the Rue du Harlay had been most
unexpected of all.</p>

<p>Henriette had written Madame Le Maire of her good fortune and
had enclosed a letter to Pierre. From time to time she had
contrived to send the old man small drafts of money, and in a
sudden burst of gratitude and affection she had dispatched fifty
dollars from her savings. Henry had not criticised her generosity,
and they had both discussed certain comforts it would procure for
the ageing porter, who could not hope to continue much longer at
his post. They had given little thought to his response, knowing
that letters were not part of his stock in trade. And then, one hot
day in midsummer, word came from Miss Haines in New York that old
Pierre had arrived. What to do with him? The newly-wedded pair had
stared blankly at each other and met their first domestic
problem.</p>

<p>"But how could I know that he would spend the money to buy a
passage to America?" Henriette had sighed. "Nothing was further
from my mind."</p>

<p>"Well, poor fellow, he probably thinks you have married a rich
man. To a French porter all Americans are rolling in money. Don't
be upset. I will write to have one of the clerks in Cyrus's firm
see him safely on the boat for Hudson. We can borrow father's horse
and drive there to meet him."</p>

<p>"And then what? Oh, Henri, I do not believe he knows a dozen
words of English, and with his rheumatism he will be less help than
hindrance. I told him to use the money to go to a place in the
country where old soldiers are cared for. Even if we do not pay him
wages, we cannot afford a man-servant."</p>

<p>So old Pierre had made his appearance, considerably stiffer in
the knees and more stubbornly devoted than he had been in Paris.
His pride in "Mademoiselle," as he persisted in calling her,
touched their hearts even though his presence became an increasing
problem as the summer passed. Henriette's fears were justified. He
spoke no English, and his hearing was beginning to fail, so that
there was little hope of his acquiring a passable, vocabulary. Save
for service in Napoleon's army, he had spent his entire life in
city streets, and was hopelessly ignorant of country ways.
Vegetables and berries were foodstuffs to be purchased from shops
and carts, not weeded and watched over. He could not milk cows or
help with haying. His hands were clumsy at carpentry and tinkering
of all sorts. If he was set to scare off crows from the cornfields,
he trampled more young stalks than he saved; if they entrusted a
patch of lawn to his care he invariably broke tools against rocks
or cut down some favourite bush or plant. All he wanted was to
stand guard in his blue coat with the worn braid and fling the door
wide to possible visitors. But since most doors stood open in
summer, and visitors walked in unannounced in that quiet community,
old Pierre soon became a decided inconvenience. He christened
himself <i>valet de Monsieur,</i> though he knew even less of
valeting than of gardening. Henry was long-suffering, but others
were far from patient; and before the summer was over Henriette was
at her wits' end.</p>

<p>In vain she had reasoned and advised the old man, suggesting as
tactfully as possible his leaving for France when cold weather
began. Stubbornly he refused all offers of a return passage.</p>

<p>"I always told them you would succeed in America," he
maintained, "and now that you have done so I only ask to serve you
the rest of my days. A corner by the stove, a crust of bread, a
little wine and coffee&mdash;my wants are simple, mademoiselle, now
that my dearest wish to come to America has been granted. You and
monsieur have need of old Pierre, and in time your children will
need him, too."</p>

<p>No matter how firmly she resolved to be ruthless, the trust and
admiration in his eyes always disarmed her. She could never forget
his devotion during her dark days, and so she made small tasks to
keep him occupied and hoped that some way might be found to rid her
of this unexpected burden. It was a comfort to talk with him in
their native tongue, though she was continually reprimanding him
for faults and urging him to be less intolerant of American ways.
Still his shrewd French comments upon people and places often so
perfectly matched her own that she could hardly hide her amusement.
Above their protests he had insisted upon coming to West.
Springfield; even now he was dropping boxes and bundles and
generally getting in the way of the men unloading furniture from a
hay wagon.</p>

<p>Henriette was always to smile and sigh, remembering her arrival
in that little town on the banks of the broad Connecticut River.
Stockbridge by comparison seemed like a cosmopolitan community,
more than ever dear as she stared at the frame houses along this
other New England street. In summer greenness they might not have
looked so plain and forbidding; but rains had swept the tree bare
of leaves, and the gardens and lawns were everywhere brown and
frost-nipped. She tried not to let Henry see how empty and dismal
she thought it, or how much she wished that the square parlours on
either side of the hall had not been painted a depressing
yellow-green that would clash with the claret-brown of her chairs
and sofa. She wanted to cry at the ugly iron stove that jutted into
the middle of the dining-room, crooking an elbow of pipe to the
ceiling its smoke had already blackened; at the chilly bed-chambers
above the long uncarpeted flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Calamities beset her at every turn during those difficult days.
First there had been the unfortunate episode of Pierre and the
currant bushes. To get him out of the way while she directed the
men unloading furniture, Henriette had told him to busy himself
outside the house. Pierre, thinking to rid the yard of some
dead-looking shrubs, had attacked them with a pruning knife. But
his attempt at improving the landscape was short-lived. He had
hardly cut one bush down and started on the second before a group
of agitated women surrounded him. They protested in their language,
and Pierre even more volubly in his. Words flew like missiles, and
the old man brandished the knife and stood his ground as stubbornly
as the massacred Swiss Guard on the staircase at Versailles. It had
taken Henriette's most emphatic French to dissuade him from further
destruction, and all Henry's tact and persuasiveness to placate the
ladies of his parish.</p>

<p>"But, Henri, how were we to know that these sad-looking bushes
were so greatly cherished?" she had sighed after the disgruntled
group had finally left.</p>

<p>"Of course you couldn't know, my dear," he had comforted, "but
you <i>see,</i> they depend on these currants. I suppose they saw
their next year's jelly disappearing before their very eyes."</p>

<p>"Ah, but they did look so grim and desperate, and now I have
made a bad start, just when for your sake I most wished to please
them."</p>

<p>Henriette's own efforts had proved even less successful than
Pierre's, and all because these new neighbours did not share her
sense of humour. She had been prepared for a steady stream of
callers those first days, but not for the donations of pie that
filled kitchen and pantry shelves to overflowing. No visitor came
empty-handed, and some brought two and three varieties of this
popular fare. Apple, mince, pumpkin, squash, custard and lemon
meringue pies were supplemented by every possible combination of
berry. Henriette received these gifts with mystified gratefulness
at first, then with grim fortitude, since Henry explained that the
ladies meant to be kind. After three days she was ready to scream
instead of expressing thanks at sight of a familiar round shape
wrapped in a napkin. And still they came.</p>

<p>"Oh, Henri!" she exploded in desperation. "Is there no end to
these pies? They descend upon us like one of the plagues of
Egypt!"</p>

<p>Henry laughed at her dismay and ate all he could. But even his
New England heritage failed him when it came to having pie served
for breakfast, dinner and supper.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to seem disloyal to the good ladies of my
congregation," he pleaded at last, "but I would be grateful if
Cassie Sampson could make us a rice pudding for supper."</p>

<p>Cassie Sampson had joined their household as "accommodator," and
though Henriette found her so far unresponsive and disapproving,
she had been thankful to place all kitchen activities in her
capable hands. Cassie had been recommended as smart and thrifty,
but Henriette wished that she looked less like one of the pear
trees by the back door dressed in shapeless calico. She had arrived
on their first morning while Henry struggled with a smoking stove
and Henriette stared at two eggs cooked to the consistence of
bullets.</p>

<p>"You will please tell me what is wrong with these eggs," she had
besought the newcomer. "I boil them and boil them, and they will
not be soft!"</p>

<p>It had not been the best possible introduction. Cassie had set
to work with a will, but her eyes were shocked and her lips grim.
They had remained so ever since. In vain Henriette had spent her
charm upon this nimble-fingered, silent woman with ageless face and
angular body who made her own efforts seem awkward and childish by
contrast to her swift accomplishment. Cassie Sampson, she felt
sure, would not approve of wasting these dozens of pies; and yet
something must be done about them.</p>

<p>The solution came to Henriette as she stood by the gate after
watching Henry leave with the doctor to visit a stricken family
some miles away. Her eyes had been drawn irresistibly towards the
eaves of the house and a narrow ledge that ran along just under a
small half-moon of window. In a flash she remembered the picture in
an almost forgotten book of her childhood&mdash;gingerbread cakes
in a frieze under the peaked gable of a cottage. Why not try the
effect? There were certainly plenty of pies to be sacrificed, and
Cassie was hanging clothes to dry in the side yard; so no
explanations would be necessary. It would have been pleasanter to
share the experiment with a young conspirator.</p>

<p>How Raynald or Berthe would have entered into the spirit of it,
or one of her newly-acquired nephews! She missed clear, impetuous
young laughter and the adoring looks she knew how to bring into
children's eyes.</p>

<p>The attic stairs were narrow and steep, and her billowing skirts
and petticoats were a decided inconvenience. But with persistence
and loaded trays she managed to transfer eighteen pies from the
pantry. The tiny window that looked like a Cyclops' eye, stuck
fast. She was showered with dust when it finally yielded to her
efforts. Her arms ached, reaching over the sill, and twice she
almost lost her balance placing the pies upright. But the beam
below held them well, and she took pains to vary the
design&mdash;now a thick crusted top, now one with a criss-cross
pattern of pastry. At last they were all in place, and she went to
her room to remove dust.</p>

<p>Foolish, she thought, standing before her mirror, to have wasted
a morning in such childishness. Yet she felt young and gay as if
she had been engaged on some secret adventure of her school days.
Her eyes were bright as they stared back at her from the glass. Her
cheeks were warm and glowing, and her hair had strayed from its
smooth bands. Thirty-nine years old, she reminded herself, and she
still felt young, almost younger than in the twenties that lay
behind her. Once her fortieth year had seemed the furthermost
boundary of life, the end of the road stretching before her. But
roads seldom ended. They only dipped behind hills or branched in
new directions leading into the unknown. Years were nothing when
one felt strong and full of vitality. She loved and was beloved.
Disaster and shame lay so far behind that only rarely now did their
shadow overwhelm her. She had come to a strange world with grim
determination to make the best of a ruined life, and suddenly the
best of life had come to her, with all that she had ever hoped for
laid in her hands. Well, perhaps, not all&mdash;it would be
terrifying to have everything. But so much, so much where once
there had been so little. She pressed her hands to her heart
because there were moments like this when happiness seemed to swell
through her in a warm, sweet tide of well-being.</p>

<p>Henry's socks met her eyes in an accusing heap in her sewing
basket. She ought to sit down and darn them and mend the pocket of
his second-best coat, and there were tablecloths to be hemmed, and
napkins and towels. But no, she was too happy to give herself to
such humdrum housewifely tasks. She ran to her little rosewood
painting table and opened the lid. Inside, her cardboard sheets and
brushes and crayons cried out to be used. She would paint a picture
for the parlour wall to hide that ugly water stain&mdash;a little
vase of flowers such as she had loved to bring in from the
Stockbridge garden&mdash;a moss rose with fuzzy leaves, a pansy or
two, dark as velvet, white clematis, misty against the blue
background she loved, and a single drooping crimson spray of
fuchsia. She would have it finished by the time Henry returned. She
would tell Cassie Sampson not to disturb her for dinner. Almost,
she believed, she could force herself to eat another piece of pie,
she felt so charged with the urge to make her own happiness
tangible on paper.</p>

<p>Henry returned that afternoon to find a cluster of outraged
ladies gathered before his home, and he spent the rest of the day
in visits of apology. His wife was a stranger and an artist, he
explained with pride that still overcame his annoyance. They must
not take offence if she brought strange customs with her. The
appeal in his eyes and voice helped to assuage the insult. But
Henriette was never quite able to live down that frieze of pies
which continued to haunt her eaves long after their removal.</p>

<p>But even such mistakes and difficulties could not dim the bliss
of those first weeks together in their own house. Henriette had a
genius for arranging and rearranging furniture till the perfect
combination was found. She could make a room take on unsuspected
beauty merely by the addition of a picture, a mirror, a lamp or a
bright square of cloth laid over a table. She turned a cheerless
upper bedroom into a studio for herself, and one of the square
parlours became Henry's study, a wonder to callers with its
mahogany secretary and leather-padded chair, its shelves of books
that reached to the ceiling, its clock shaped like a church, and
the Franklin stove with brass fittings where a wood-fire was always
ready to be lighted. Pierre preferred charcoal, but so long as
firelight could be summoned Henriette did not complain. Nothing
mattered on those evenings when there was no midweek prayer meeting
to conduct, no sermon to prepare, when with the crimson curtains
drawn against the chill darkness she and Henry had their coffee
together from the new flowery gilt cups of French china.</p>

<p>Even the grimness about Cassie Sampson's lips could not spoil
their pleasure in this ritual.</p>

<p>"You and your foreign furbelows!" the stiff set of her shoulders
seemed to be saying as she carried in the tray. "Why can't you
drink your coffee at the supper-table like sensible folks?"</p>

<p>Henry remained blissfully unaware of this disapproval, and
Henriette did her best to ignore it. Cassie, she had decided, might
rule absolute in kitchen and pantry, but elsewhere she must not
intrude.</p>

<p>"Henri," she would chide fondly as he reached towards the sugar
bowl. "I beg you will stir your cup, for I have already put in
three spoonfuls of sugar."</p>

<p>And he would smile at the reminder and settle back in his chair.
He had never known that such contentment of the body could be
combined with the mental stimulus she brought him. Even her
mistakes lent an air of uncertainty and charm to each day. This
Continental custom of coffee served by the fire delighted him,
though noon dinner had been eaten hours before. No less than she,
he was incredulous of their happiness. He marvelled that this woman
who had from the first so stirred his imagination should be here
beside him, sharing his hearth and his home. Her presence in his
life lent new importance to each thought, each act, each intimate
small detail, for she charged whatever she touched with a zest and
colour peculiarly her own. He loved to look up from his desk and
see her in the lamplight, bent over a piece of needlework or
turning the pages of some book&mdash;like any other wife, he would
tell himself, when all the time he knew there was not her like
under the sun.</p>

<p>He loved an excuse to question her, whether it happened to be
upon some problem of the world in general or of themselves in
particular. She had a way of giving her whole attention to the
matter, weighing it gravely with a slight tilt of her head, like a
thoughtful bird. Her response might be a smile, curving the
generous fullness of her wide mouth, or that little French shrug
that never failed to enchant him, or perhaps she would speak with
that swift discernment of thought, like an arrow speeding from the
taut bowstring of her brain.</p>

<p>He could never make her understand what he felt that first
Sunday when he looked down from the pulpit and saw her sitting in
the pew reserved for the minister's family. He had served this
congregation for several months the year before, but that pew had
always been empty, as his life had been empty till she had taken
possession of it. Such a wave of thankfulness and elation overcame
him as he felt the reassurance of her eyes meeting his from under
the grey bonnet with the cherry velvet trimming, that he wanted to
rise and read Solomon's Song of Songs instead of the less exuberant
text from Ecclesiastes he had already selected.</p>

<p>"Ah, my little Henri!" she was thinking from the pew below. "How
young he looks, and how good, much too good for this world and this
very cold church!"</p>

<p>Outside, the ground was already frozen solid as iron, and though
it was not yet November, an edge of snow sharpened the air. Inside,
the congregation's breath mounted visibly with their voices, raised
in the opening hymn:</p>

<blockquote>"Must I be carried to the skies<br>
On flowery beds of ease,<br>
While others fought to win the prize,<br>
And sailed through bloody seas?"</blockquote>

<p>How little, she thought, as she tried to sing through chattering
teeth, how little do they know about beds of ease! She was
remembering in a flash the gilded scrolls and horns of plenty, the
seductive cupids and garlands on a certain bed in the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;. She shivered, recalling its
significance and the blood and violence that had sprung from it.
What would these good people lifting up their voices about her
think if they knew she had been part of all that? For a moment old
panic seized her and she wanted to throw down the hymnal and run
out through the white doors and down the church steps. But the
momentary panic passed. The blur cleared before her eyes as she
lifted them once more to the high pulpit and Henry's face.</p>

<p>She was sure of Henry and his love, and she had been sure of so
few things in her life till now. Nothing should ever come between
them, certainly not the past, which she had put aside like a worn
garment.</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-One</h3>

<p>"But, Henri, this cannot be possible! You could not have
understood what they said."</p>

<p>Henriette pushed the half-written letter to the Monads aside and
regarded her husband with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's not the least doubt about it. Deacon Judd
and Dr. Willard wouldn't have told me unless it were true, and I
hurried back as fast as I could."</p>

<p>Once more he was telling her what he had learned by a chance
meeting with two sympathetic members of his congregation&mdash;that
this afternoon some twenty or more ladies of the parish would
appear at the door without warning and expect to be supplied with a
bountiful tea. This barbarous custom of discovering whether the
latest arrival in the community could prove herself equal to such
domestic emergencies had long been in practice. Henry, during his
years of bachelor preaching, had naturally been spared this ordeal
since it was an entirely feminine affair, arranged in strictest
secrecy. If the unexpected guests were well received and ushered
out to a loaded table, then the surprised hostess was the object of
respect among her neighbours. If, however, she failed to rise to
the occasion, if more particularly there was plain or scanty fare,
she had failed miserably in that first requisite of a New England
wife, which was to be a good provider. Fortunately two husbands had
discovered the plan in time to warn the minister and give Henriette
an hour's start.</p>

<p>"It's kind of a mean trick, I say," the doctor had added when he
and the deacon had broken the news to Henry. "But you know how
women can be about such things, and your wife wouldn't be expected
to know our ways yet; so we thought we'd tell you what they're up
to. You tell Mrs. Field to expect 'em round about four and then you
take my advice and clear out. A tea-squall's no place for a man.
And, whatever you do don't let on we told you!"</p>

<p>For once Henry's absent-mindedness left him. He realised that
this was a crisis&mdash;one in which he could do little to help.
The village clock was striking three as he hurried towards home
feeling like Paul Revere with the British at his heels. He was
breathless when he burst into the quiet of Henriette's upper room,
and it took some minutes to explain the situation.</p>

<p>"But why should they come here when they have not been invited?"
she questioned, mystified and annoyed. "Have they not plenty to eat
and drink in their own homes?"</p>

<p>Henry had to confess that the logic of the surprise tea-party
was altogether beyond him. But he felt sure she would know how to
meet the emergency. Henriette felt anything but sure as she rose to
go downstairs.</p>

<p>"Well, first of all we're short on cream. The Reverend will have
to go over to Blodgetts and see what they can spare us. Here!"
Cassie rose and held out a jug to Henry. "You can talk 'em into
letting you have some if anybody can do it. Hurry right back."</p>

<p>They knew she had taken command. By he time Henry had left,
Cassie was moving from woodshed to stove, from pantry to table with
the precision of a general marshalling his resources in preparation
for the enemy advance. Orders issued shortly from her lips as she
sifted flour, broke eggs and measured sugar into mixing-bowls.</p>

<p>"You tackle the china closet. I've got no time for that. Here's
a dish-towel. You better wipe every last one of the cups and plates
and glasses. If there's a speck on anything it won't be overlooked.
I'll need those two cake-stands you put on the top shelf, and all
the preserve dishes you can muster."</p>

<p>"But if we have no preserves, what good are dishes?" Henriette
faltered from the door.</p>

<p>"You leave that to me. I've been expecting this; but I did think
they'd be considerate enough not to select a Monday, with half the
linen soaking-wet. Well, it can't be helped. Here's a piece of
flannel for the silver. We won't have time to give it a polish, but
you can kind of shine it up!"</p>

<p>Henriette found herself following directions meekly without
further questions. She recognised the creative fire in Cassie
Sampson's eyes. She felt awed by the power that emanated from this
woman, willing the fire to burn, the cake batter to assume golden
smoothness and hidden stores of preserved peaches and pears to
appear from dark corners.</p>

<p>"I fetched them from my sister's last week," she answered
Henriette's incredulous look. "Thought they'd come in handy some
time, though I didn't count on it this soon. Better bring the tea
and coffee pots out here, and I'll need another dish for
butter."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Henriette sighed as she filled the orders. "If I had not
been so foolish with all those pies! I begin to see now the reason
for such presents."</p>

<p>"Don't you fret about them. 'Twouldn't do to serve folks back
their own baking, anyhow. Now you get that big platter for the cold
ham."</p>

<p>"Ham, Cassie?" This time Henriette felt that she certainly could
not believe her ears.</p>

<p>But there it was when she returned, a large boiled ham falling
into thin pink slices.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;how?" Henriette gasped.</p>

<p>"I've been keeping it," was all Cassie would admit as she
sliced, "against some rainy day. I guess this is it, and no
mistake."</p>

<p>Henriette did not question further. If the Angel Gabriel had
come down to her kitchen and exchanged his horn for a wooden spoon
and set to work, she could not have been more grateful.</p>

<p>"It's half-past three," Cassie told her. "Time you went upstairs
and got spruced up. Let's see, now&mdash;" She swept a strand of
limp brown hair out of her eyes and surveyed Henriette critically.
"Won't do for you to look too dressed up or they'll know they was
expected. That green silk's your handsomest, but I guess you better
put on that printed challis with the blue braid and be on the safe
side. You can kind of make excuses for it when they come."</p>

<p>"A lace collar, do you think, or would a plain one be best?"
Henriette meekly sought further advice.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe the lace looks a little mite too fancy. Stick to
the plain one, but there's no harm in a breast pin and some cologne
on your handkerchief."</p>

<p>As she went to her room and took out the dress Henriette
marvelled anew at Cassie Sampson. She had not guessed that she
noticed, much less cared for, clothes. Yet apparently she knew and
speculated upon every article of her wardrobe. For the first time
in those three weeks since Cassie's coming as accommodator, they
had talked as woman to woman, not as mistress and maid. Cassie did
not really disapprove of her, and she need not meet this dreaded
avalanche of unbidden tea drinkers alone. Together they would
contrive to meet the crisis and emerge triumphant.</p>

<p><i>"Bien!"</i> She commended her reflection in the glass before
she hurried downstairs again. "Cassie has chosen well. I should
never have thought of the challis."</p>

<p>"Well, now you look as if you'd come right out of the top
drawer," Cassie praised. "I just dusted the parlour and filled the
wood-boxes. You hung up everything in your room, I hope, for
they'll manage to snoop the house through."</p>

<p>Strange words were falling from the lips that had remained
sealed so long. Henriette listened as if she were hearing an
unfamiliar language in those last frantic minutes before the
knocker sounded. Cassie's natural genius had far outrun her
vocabulary, but they understood each other as only two women united
against desperate odds can understand and move in complete
accord.</p>

<p>"I put the extra leaves in, and there'll be room for ten each
side and one at each end," Cassie was saying from the dining-room.
"If more turn up we'll squeeze 'em in some way. Here, just give me
a hand with this cloth, will you? It's a mercy you've got one big
enough."</p>

<p>But when its smooth damask folds were spread out upon the
lengthened table they stared at one another in dismay. A large rust
mark showed prominently. How it had happened, Henriette could not
explain, but there was no disguising it. All the other cloths were
too small or already in the washtub, and no amount of manoeuvring
could bring the stain to the centre where a pot of fern or dish of
apples might have hidden it. Even Cassie's resourcefulness failed
her momentarily.</p>

<p>"We shall have to manage with a bare table," Henriette sighed,
"or perhaps two of the smaller cloths put together."</p>

<p>But Cassie shook her head emphatically.</p>

<p>"Might's well serve tea without sugar and cream," she decided,
"as do anything like that. Why, you'd never hear the last of it.
No, we'll just have to brazen it out between us some way!"</p>

<p>Henriette ventured no further suggestions as they set the china
and silver in place. Pierre was called in from the barn and given
instructions about opening the door. He was to make no remarks in
French or English, and he was to bow with restraint and make a good
impression upon the ladies he had so incensed by attacking the
currant bushes. Pierre beamed with approval and clicked his heels.
At last the occasion he had been waiting for. But why had not
mademoiselle told him that morning in time to wax his moustache and
give his blue coat a thorough brushing?</p>

<p>Henriette left him peering through the narrow glass panels
beside the door in anticipation of the first arrivals while she
returned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"It is almost time," she said. "What are we to do about the
tablecloth?"</p>

<p>Cassie drew a pan of perfectly browned biscuits from the oven
before she answered. She stood by the stove, where the kettle
rocked on a red-hot lid. Through the clouds of steam that rose
about her, Cassie's plain moist face wore an ageless look, like a
moon on the wane, but still holding its own against the elements.
She rested her weight squarely on her two large feet and wiped her
hands on the all-enveloping apron of horizontal blue stripes. So,
Henriette thought, some ancient soothsayer might have looked above
her sacred brews, and so she might have issued her warnings.</p>

<p>"Now you listen to me," she ordered as she shifted stove
dampers. "You do same 's I tell you to, and everything 'll be all
right. The sugar bowl's set over that spot now, and when the time
comes to move it you've got to act all put out and provoked. Yes,
you've got to make a regular fuss so's they all stop talking to
listen. You turn on me and point to it and say real sharp: 'Cassie
Sampson, what do you mean by disgracing me in front of everybody
with a tablecloth that isn't fit to be seen?' That'll be your part,
and you've got to sound mad 's a hornet."</p>

<p>"But, Cassie, it was not your fault. I cannot have you taking
all the blame."</p>

<p>But Cassie Sampson stood her ground.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about me," she sniffed. "You got plenty on your
mind without that. Just remember to make a big fuss when the time
comes; and for the love of heaven get out of my kitchen 'fore you
spill something on your dress and we have to explain two spots
away!"</p>

<p>Henriette did as she was told. The spiciness of Cassie Sampson's
baking cakes filled her nostrils, and her heart and eyes overflowed
with gratitude. Her resentment at such outrageous spying of
neighbours into the privacy of one's home faded before this
evidence of unsuspected devotion. Where but in America, she asked
herself, could such things be? Still, one could forgive America its
crudities when they were compensated for by such loyalty.</p>

<p>The surprise tea-party passed off without mishap, and the
impromptu scene over the tablecloth was managed with real finesse.
Cassie threw herself into the spirit of the occasion, and
Henriette's reproof rang out with a dramatic zeal that would have
done credit to the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise. The guests were
decidedly impressed and discussed the incident before they
separated at the gate to go their various ways in the chill
November dusk. Everything, they agreed, had been above reproach,
and she certainly set a good table, if that tea was any sample. If
it hadn't been for the tablecloth they would almost have thought
she had got wind of their coming beforehand. But she had seemed so
upset over the accommodator putting on a spotted cloth they felt
sure the surprise had been complete. No wonder she had been
embarrassed! My, but she had worked herself into a state over it,
and the way she had lit out and scolded with those funny foreign
words and gestures thrown in had been a caution, they all decided
as they compared notes on the episode. The guessed the Reverend
Field could have done a lot worse for himself as long as he had
seen fit to take a wife from far parts.</p>

<p>It would have shaken them considerably to see their recent
hostess fly to the kitchen with outstretched arms when the last
guest was safely out of sight.</p>

<p>"Ah, my. Cassie, but you are an angel from heaven!" she cried.
And in a burst of gratefulness she reached up and kissed her
impulsively, French fashion, on either cheek. "You were
<i>magnifique!</i> There is no other word. And the biscuits and the
cake&mdash;did you see how they ate each little crumb? Did you hear
how they praised the peaches and the spiced pears?"</p>

<p>"Well, you don't need to go into hysterics now it's all over,"
Cassie reproved in embarrassed pleasure. "You keep out of here in
that good dress. I just see the Reverend sneaking back, so you go
let him in. Tell him I've saved out enough for his supper. You can
fetch it in his study on a tray while I get the table cleared."</p>

<p>But Henriette lingered because she must somehow make this other
woman understand the thankfulness she felt.</p>

<p>"You were so generous about the tablecloth. All the time I was
feeling such gratefulness, and yet I must make myself say those
harsh words to you."</p>

<p>"Shucks, that was nothing! Kind of like playing a game nobody
but us knew. You certainly made things hum when you got under way.
Had me scared for a minute or two there."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Henri will think we were wrong to do it. After all, I
suppose, we did tell a lie."</p>

<p>"Don't you say a word to him. I guess women have got some
privileges of their own in this world. We paid 'em back in their
own coin, and I'll take the consequences right up to Judgment Day!
But you see what I mean 'bout a ham coming in handy."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes! You are right. I shall leave all such matters to
you in the future. I should have been taught to mix flour and eggs
and sugar as well as to mix paints and crayons and play the
piano."</p>

<p>But Cassie thought otherwise.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to cooking," she insisted. "Look at all the
women that can do it. I'll swap the stove for a piano any day, but
much good it would do me."</p>

<p>She stared at her large hands and sighed.</p>

<p>"You wish to play the piano?" Henriette tried to hide her
astonishment. "But why did you not tell me this before?"</p>

<p>Cassie flushed to the roots of her thin brown hair and turned
back to the crowded sink.</p>

<p>"I expect you never heard the saying: 'If wishes were horses,
then beggars would ride'?"' she volunteered sheepishly. "Guess I
better let well enough alone; but I'd be satisfied if I could just
play one piece."</p>

<p>"Why should you not play one? I will teach you. You shall have
your first lesson this very night if you are not too tired."</p>

<p>Henry was sympathetic when she told him of the plan, and later''
in the great mahogany bed upstairs they laughed and sighed over the
day's happenings.</p>

<p>"This eating and drinking&mdash;why should it be so important?"
she demanded. "Food is necessary, and we should not spoil or waste
it. But why must there be all this ceremony, all this fuss, about
it?"</p>

<p>"And yet, my dear, the French are the finest epicures in the
world," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"It is considered an art in France, not a moral virtue. I do not
condemn one who has no ear for music. Why should they think the
less of me if I serve plain bread and tea, or even no tea at
all?"</p>

<p>Henry smiled in the darkness and was forced to confess he had no
answer.</p>

<p>"But," he added, "we must not forget the miracles in the Bible
that concerned eating and drinking&mdash;the water turned into
wine; the feeding of the multitude from the loaves and fishes."</p>

<p>"Ah, miracles!" She caught at the word. "That is a different
matter altogether. What I tire of is this petty vieing from one
kitchen to another."</p>

<p>"But you forget, my dear, because you have lived so richly and
because your talents have brought so much to fill your mind, how
little most women have beyond the world of their own kitchens."</p>

<p>"You are right, Henri, and I have been wrong," she told him in
one of those swift, unpredictable changes of mood that were for him
one of her chief charms. "I have been stupid not to see before that
these pies and cakes and preserves are no less masterpieces than
the works of Raphael and Michael Angelo because they vanish so
quickly down people's throats. And it is a miracle to do what
Cassie did this afternoon. What the flour and butter and eggs and
sugar would have been in my hands&mdash;I do not like, to
think!"</p>

<p>"I prefer your gifts," he assured her.</p>

<p>"Ah, my little Henri, that is fortunate." She drew closer and
sighed, a sigh half of contentment, half of apology. "But I am too
often impatient of their looks and ways that are so strange to me.
Yet I must be even as strange to them. Only this morning I
misjudged Cassie Sampson. I thought her like those plants you call
thistles&mdash;all stiff, sharp points. And to-night I find that
the wish of her heart is to play 'The Last Rose of Summer.'"</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Two</h3>

<p>It was going to be a severe winter. Every one predicted it and
remarked on certain infallible signs. The squirrels were unusually
active in their nut hoardings; the wild geese had started south
ahead of schedule; and all the village cats were growing extra
heavy coats of fur. Frost had come early, and snow fell before
Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Henriette watched the first snow from the window of her
improvised workroom and felt the stirring of old ecstasy and pain
as the flakes began to whirl. Snow was the same wherever it fell,
whether it dimmed the outlines of Notre Dame and the grey buildings
along the Seine; whether it whitened the roofs and red barns of a
New England landscape. Each year while she had eyes to see and a
heart to remember she would dread that first sight of falling snow,
not for the long months of cold it promised, but because a storm of
memories would rise to envelop her even as the flakes swarmed in
stinging whiteness. She would feel caught once more, like some
traveller who finds himself walking backwards through a storm he
has already weathered; like the figure in the glass paperweight
that had come with her across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The few possessions she had brought from France were displayed
on bureau and mantelpiece&mdash;all but this souvenir of the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; and a snowy New Year's Eve. That was
too poignant a memento to be kept in sight or even to be shown to
her husband. Some days, perhaps, she might trust herself to look at
it unmoved; but that time had not yet come. To-day, however, she
felt a need to hold it in her hands again. Her fingers shook as she
lifted the little globe from its wrappings and at her touch the
miniature snowstorm began to envelop the small red-cloaked figure
in a white flurry.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu,"</i> she thought, "that this should be all that
remains of those years which were so sweet and so bitter! This
frail bubble of glass is still whole in my hands, though the giver
of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off. After four years she could not think of the Duc
de Praslin as dead. Impossible to believe that one who had been so
alive and vigorous, so strong and good to look upon, should be
lying, hated and shunned, in a numbered grave. Even his children,
whom he had so dearly loved, must have learned to forget their
father's disgrace.</p>

<p>"And even I," she told herself, "who perhaps knew him better
than any, even I have been forced to put an ocean between that past
and this present. It is as if I, too, had died and been raised from
the dead!"</p>

<p>At such moments, when crowding memories overcame her, she would
feel a curious conviction that she had actually died and been I
born again. She would stand as she stood now, holding some trinket
that had been intimately associated with the old life, and marvel
that together they had survived those years of uncertainty and
despair.</p>

<p>Old Pierre was coming up the stairs. She heard his slow, heavy
steps that paused hopefully as they neared her closed door. It was
an annoying habit he had formed, this method of telling her that he
was lonely in this place where he did not matter to any one but
herself; where only she cared or understood what he might say. His
utter dependence upon her was growing increasingly difficult, the
more so since he grew daily stiffer in his knee joints and more
unyielding in his mind. 'Each night she and Henry discussed the
problem of what could be done with Pierre, and as yet they had
found no solution that would not be too painful to his
feelings.</p>

<p><i>"Entrez,</i> Pierre." Henriette could not resist the unspoken
plea from the other side of the door.</p>

<p><i>"Regarde&mdash;la neige!"</i> The old porter burst in,
pointing to the windows with his chapped hands. <i>"La neige,
mademoiselle."</i></p>

<p>She nodded and returned to her easel and the sketch she had
begun from memory of a bookstall on the Quai with the arch of the
Pont-Neuf and the Ile de la Cit&eacute; in the background. He
hobbled to her side and regarded it intently.</p>

<p><i>"C'est bon, bon,"</i> he praised after a long scrutiny. "I
know the exact spot. You have caught the very look of the Quai. I
can almost smell the river damp and hear it flowing under the
bridge. Ah, yes, I marvel at your gift!"</p>

<p>He sighed and continued to stare as she laid on a pale blue wash
for sky and mixed colours for the foreground. Presently Henriette
laid aside her brushes and turned to study his face. She was struck
at the way he had aged since his arrival. There was a dejected
droop to his mouth, and his shoulders sagged. His hands hung
forlornly at his sides, and his legs were bowed with rheumatism.
She had seen bewildered peasants look just so as they waited in
strange depots far from their own provinces. Pierre had come too
far from home, yet he would never admit that to her, or to
himself.</p>

<p>"Pierre!" She reached out impulsively and took his stiff old
fingers in her warm ones. "I am not the artist you think me. No, do
not protest. I know my own limitations. You fill in these outlines
of mine with the longing that is in your heart. Your homesickness
is mixed with my paints&mdash;isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"No, no, mademoiselle," he protested. "You are a true artist You
bring Paris back to me on that piece of cardboard. I will not deny
that I often think of it and wonder how it goes in the Rue du
Harlay and those boulevards where I used to walk. But you must not
think for a moment that I wish to return. I am not complaining of
this place, though it seems to me that you and monsieur might have
done better to remain in the city."</p>

<p>She repressed a smile and tried a different method.</p>

<p>"It is not a crime to miss one's own country, or to return to
it," she went on. "See how the snow falls out there. It will be
like that for many months, Pierre, only the drifts will grow deep
and the cold will be more bitter than you have ever known. I should
miss you if you left us, but I should be happier knowing you were
in Paris, where you belong."</p>

<p>"I belong to you." He clung stubbornly to the old refrain, but
she saw his eyes remained on her easel.</p>

<p>"There is an old saying," she persisted, "that 'the heart's
letter is read in the eyes'; and your eyes tell me what you will
never bring your lips to say. You are lonely here. Tell me the
truth: Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Can you tell me that you also are not lonely sometimes?" he
asked her in turn.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am. But for me love is here, and that is all that
really matters to a woman. Love can take the strangeness out of any
land, Pierre. For you it is different."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" He frowned to cover his emotion and looked
away. "You mean that the old dog is not able to learn new
tricks?"</p>

<p>"That dog should not be ashamed because he is faithful to his
old ones," she comforted.</p>

<p>And so Pierre was persuaded to return. Henriette used the last
of her savings to buy him a third-class passage to France, and she
dispatched a letter to the Monod brothers asking them to take the
old man in till he could be enrolled in a comfortable pension for
retired soldiers near Passy. She missed her old friend more than
she would admit to Henry or to herself. There was no one now to
understand her French outbursts; no one to call her "mademoiselle"
and remind her of Paris. He had been a blundering and difficult
charge, but when he went he took with him another link with the old
days.</p>

<p>Gradually she was beginning to know and sort out the various
members of Henry's congregation. The men she found easy to classify
and much less formidable than the women. There were so many more of
the latter, for one thing: widows, wives, grandmothers, spinsters,
and a few unmarried daughters. These were the first with whom she
made friends, for youth continued to respond to her. The older
women kept their reserve, and the wives were smug and suspicious
and completely absorbed in their own households. If she tried to
please them, they resented her efforts and decided among themselves
that the minister's French wife was bold and gave herself too many
airs. If she remained aloof and waited for them to make the first
advances, she was criticised as being superior and standoffish.</p>

<p>"They are so stiff in their ways," she would sigh to Henry after
an afternoon of parish calls. "Their manners are like the horsehair
furniture in their parlours, and they hoard their smiles as the
squirrels do their nuts."</p>

<p>"Don't be discouraged," he would reassure her. "In time they
will show you where they keep them."</p>

<p>Henry was right, but it took patience. He made few suggestions,
though it was through one of these that she made her next conquest
after Cassie Sampson.</p>

<p>"Dr. Willard tells me that Ora Newton is poorly again," he told
her one day at dinner. "Her mother is a member of my congregation,
and the daughter a poor conscience-stricken young thing. I think
perhaps if you visited there you could do more for her than I."</p>

<p>Ora Newton, Henriette learned further from Cassie, was the only
child of a widow who lived at the far end of town. They had a
difficult time making ends meet by sewing for the village and
frequently had to be tided through the winter by more prosperous
neighbours. Ora was sixteen and the apple of her mother's eye; but
already she bore the signs of consumption.</p>

<p>"She was headed for it from a child," Cassie explained with
professional relish. "You can always tell, some way. That Bates
young one has got the look already. You mark my words, they'll
never raise her to marry. Yes, you go see Ora this afternoon. Put
on that plum-coloured cashmere if you've a mind to, and carry your
muff. She needs to have her mind taken off the next world now and
then."</p>

<p>Henriette was shocked and curious.</p>

<p>"But surely, Cassie, this poor young girl does not know that she
is going to die?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my yes! She don't think of much else, and you wait'll you
hear her go on about her sins. Here, I'll put up a basket of food
for you to take along. Most any contribution comes in handy over to
Newton's."</p>

<p>Henriette set out with vague misgivings. She had followed
Cassie's advice and put on her plum-coloured dress and matching
bonnet. But in spite of her warm dolman and sealskin muff she was
chilled through before she reached the edge of town. Winter was at
her heels. She felt its frigid finger upon her as she hurried over
the frozen ruts. The road was still open enough for wheels, but the
distant hills, the pastures and nearer lawns were already whitened
with light snows. The Connecticut River below its banks was icy
except where the open water of the main channel showed like the
steely length of some gigantic coiling snake. Along its shores the
willows strained in the wind that whipped Henriette's fashionably
full hoop skirts. She was thankful when at last she came in sight
of her goal, a small red house behind two dark, symmetrical
hemlocks.</p>

<p>With the coming of winter she began to understand why New
England farmers chose red paint for their barns. It answered the
need for colour in their lives through the long, bleak months that
stretched ahead. Mentally she made a note to remind Henry to
suggest that the ladies' sewing circle dye the new material for pew
cushions a rich crimson. Coming from him, the suggestion might be
adopted, whereas if she made it the ladies would probably decide on
a serviceable brown, as dull as the old covers.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter welcomed her with open arms. She found
herself expanding under the warmth of their greeting as she had not
done in any home since her arrival. They hung upon her words, and
not the smallest button or ruffle of her costume escaped notice.
While they talked, the fingers of her hostesses were
active&mdash;the mother's over a skirt hem she was binding, the
daughter's with tiny scallops on a flannel sack. Ora helped with
the light sewing when she felt able, and her pale, almost
transparent fingers were deft.</p>

<p>"Let me show you a stitch the Sisters in the Convent taught me
to do," Henriette offered, taking up a piece of flannel. "See, like
this. And when you join the chain, it makes a pattern of
roses."</p>

<p>The two were enchanted. Under Henriette's guidance they soon
mastered the stitch.</p>

<p>"Well, that beats, all!" the widow Newton exclaimed. "I never
knew nuns gave a thought to fancywork. Now, long 's you're here to
keep Ora company, I'll just run over to Weeks's with this dress. I
was hating to leave her here all by herself."</p>

<p>The mother hurried off, leaving Ora and her visitor in the
kitchen together. Seeing that the girl looked flushed and feverish,
Henriette took the piece of sewing from her hands and went on with
the scallops. The kettle on the stove hissed with a comforting
sound, and the clock ticked away on the shelf by the door. Ora lay
back on the pillows that propped her up in a large rocker and
regarded her guest hopefully. Henriette felt that something
important was expected of her, and for once was at a loss for
conversation.</p>

<p>"My Henri has told me of you," she began, "and he wished me to
say that he will soon be coming himself to see you. He has gone to
Springfield this afternoon, so I came in his place. Do you like to
crochet as well as to sew?"</p>

<p>Ora nodded and continued to regard her visitor.</p>

<p>"In that case I will bring you some wool to make a shawl for
your shoulders. It is red," she went on, though without receiving
encouragement. "I think red is a pleasant colour for winter, and it
would become you."</p>

<p>Yes, she thought, red would be a great improvement on the grey
wrapper that only accentuated the false brightness on those
prominent cheekbones.</p>

<p>"I can't see as it makes much difference," the reply came
dishearteningly. "I'll be going where it don't much matter what I
wear 'fore long."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to hear you speak so. You are much too young not
to&mdash;to care for colour and pretty clothes."</p>

<p>Ora eyed her with surprise and picked at the afghan fringe
uncertainly.</p>

<p>"You talk awful queer," she said at last. "I expected
different."</p>

<p>"And what did you expect of me?" Henriette questioned with a
directness that seemed to startle the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, I figured you'd come to discuss my spiritual state. You
being the minister's wife, it's only natural you'd want to talk
about my soul."</p>

<p>Aghast, Henriette laid down the work and faced her.</p>

<p>"I leave such matters to my husband," she said. "And to tell you
the truth I know very little about this state you speak of."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes widened in shocked surprise, but Henriette paid
no heed to that disapproval. With a quick, impulsive gesture she
leaned forward and touched the fair hair strained back unbecomingly
from the pale forehead.</p>

<p>"You have such pretty hair," she said admiringly. "It is the
colour of yellow primroses, and it would curl charmingly about your
face with even a little encouragement."</p>

<p>"I haven't got much time left to think about curling my hair,"
Ora reproved. "When your days on earth are numbered&mdash;"</p>

<p>Henriette cut her short.</p>

<p>"That is all the more reason to look your best, to make your
mother forget you are not well. Do you think God would have put
beauty into the world if he did not wish us to enjoy it?"</p>

<p>"Well," Ora hesitated, "I don't know about that. But the
minister we had before Mr. Field thought I ought to consider my
spiritual state first, and it's not as if I could ever hope to get
married."</p>

<p>The wistful appeal that crept into her voice touched Henriette.
She rose and brought a brush and comb from the adjoining bedroom,
and without further comment began to rearrange the soft hair.</p>

<p>"You see," Ora continued, though she submitted to the
hairdressing without resistance. "I haven't experienced religion
yet, and if I shouldn't 'fore I die&mdash;"</p>

<p>Once more Henriette broke in firmly.</p>

<p>"Ora," she said, "must you talk always of dying? Can you not
think of something else for a few minutes?"</p>

<p>"But I'm going to die. I've known it an awful long time."</p>

<p>"We are all of us going to die"&mdash;Henriette stepped back and
studied the side of hair that she had curled&mdash;"every one of us
here in this world; so I do not see why you talk as if you alone
had been chosen."</p>

<p>"Well, the doctor from Springfield told Ma he'd be surprised if
I got through the winter."</p>

<p>"Hush!" Henriette emphasised her command by a flourish of the
brush and comb. "I will not listen to you. I am going to curl the
other side now, and then I shall bring the mirror and let you see
yourself."</p>

<p>Ora remained silent for a few minutes, and the work
continued.</p>

<p>"I guess you must be same 's they all say&mdash;frivolous," the
girl spoke at last.</p>

<p><i>"Bien!"</i> Henriette set the last strand in place and nodded
approvingly. "So they say that I am frivolous. Ah, well, there are
worse things than that in this world. A woman should not be vain,
but she should not neglect her appearance. Now, tell me if you are
not pleased with your reflection?"</p>

<p>She brought a small mirror from the next room and held it up
before the girl.</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;Ora's anxious expression relaxed slightly&mdash;"I
wouldn't hardly know it was me, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now no more of these buts, if you please. I shall expect you to
wear your hair exactly so when I see you next, and I shall tell
Henri to report to me if you have not curls when he comes to
call."</p>

<p>She seated herself once more and resumed the sewing. Her heart
ached with pity for this frail troubled child, but her spirit also
rose in wrath at the stern doctrines that had taken such hold upon
her. It was cruel enough that her life should be cut short by this
fatal disease without her mind being haunted by morbid fears and
confused ideas about her soul's salvation. Henriette could see that
the time was indeed short. That was all too apparent on the
innocent, plain face. But it made her the more determined to put
what she could of youth and light-heartedness into the months that
remained.</p>

<p>"I must distract her from these fears," she vowed to herself.
"If I can only make her smile and forget the shadow of death for a
few minutes, that will be all that I can do."</p>

<p>Twilight was beginning to creep across the snowy fields, closing
in about the small house and the kitchen where they sat and talked.
Their two voices wove a pattern of sound, with the steady ticking
of the clock beating its relentless rhythm under their words.
Henriette listened and responded, but she felt a strange, almost
primitive, sense of holding some intangible presence at bay by the
very power of her own will. She was more than twenty years older
than this girl, yet Ora was already marked as Cassie had said. The
shadow had fallen upon her while she was still hardly more than a
child.</p>

<p>"It's not that I'm scared of being dead," Ora was confessing;
"only when I think about dying, nights I can't sleep&mdash;"</p>

<p>A pang stabbed Henriette at those words. For a moment she felt
almost suffocated by memories of a narrow upper room in the Rue du
Harlay. Yes, she knew the panic of lying awake with nothing but
blackness ahead.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm not very brave," the girl sighed.</p>

<p>"I was not very brave, Ora, when I had to leave my friends and
all that I knew behind; when I had to cross those miles of water
alone and come to a strange country." She took the girl's hands
between her own, as if she could somehow let her own vitality flow
from palm to palm. "I do not think it will be so very different,"
she went on, "for that was almost like dying. I did not know what I
should find on the other side of the sea where people would not
speak as I spoke or perhaps even feel as I felt. But I found
happiness in America after a while, and I can tell you not to be
afraid, even when you cannot sleep at night."</p>

<p>"You mean"&mdash;the girl turned to her hopefully&mdash;"that
maybe heaven will be like America?"</p>

<p>"I should not be surprised if it were. But you must ask Henri
about that," she added hastily.</p>

<p>"Maybe I won't go to heaven." Ora's fears seldom left her for
long.</p>

<p>"You see, I've been such an awful sinner, and I haven't
experienced salvation yet."</p>

<p>Impatience overcame Henriette's pity, and she faced the girl
once more with brisk protest.</p>

<p>"Ora, you must not keep saying such dreadful things. You are not
a sinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am! Mrs. Field, you don't know how wicked I've
been."</p>

<p>For a moment Henriette felt hysterical laughter on her own
lips.</p>

<p>She thought of newspapers, black with the inky horror of murder
and her name; of the accusing eyes and voices of judges uttering
words she could never forget; of those dark pools of scandal she
had struggled through alone. And here she sat in the security of a
New England kitchen listening to this poor child who insisted that
she was a sinner in doubt of heaven.</p>

<p>"But what wrong could you possibly have done?" she heard herself
demanding. "How can you be a sinner, Ora, when you have never been
out of this little town?"</p>

<p>Afterwards, making her way home through the chill December dusk,
she felt that she had been too hasty. What had the confines of a
town to do with this searching of the secret places of the
heart?</p>

<p>Lamps were being lighted in the plain, square houses along the
village street. She could see into kitchens where women bent over
stoves and families gathered for supper. Men hurried home carrying
pails or bundles, and by the general store a group of loungers
laughed at some jest&mdash;the low, throaty chuckle of men
exchanging some sally not meant for women's ears. A horse and buggy
jolted over the icy ruts, and she recognised Dr. Willard's huddled
shape on the seat. He was heading away from town, from those
lamp-lit windows, out into the bleak countryside where pain must be
fought, as it was being fought in Paris, in West Springfield, and
in houses the world over.</p>

<p>Passion, violence, love, hatred and sacrifice&mdash;she felt
them all striving about her there in the gathering dark. They raged
and flowered behind those frame houses she passed. Her neighbours'
kitchens held them all, and those unlighted windows above that
would later be pale oblongs of lamp or candlelight. What could not
lurk there of the bitter and of the sweet? Those chill upper
bedrooms&mdash;might they not hold the beauty of fulfilment in
their four walls? Might they not hide secrets, dark as those of the
Conciergerie?</p>

<p>"Fool!" she called herself as she quickened her steps and
hurried towards the church and the familiar shape of her own house.
"Fool, to think that good and evil are a matter of geography!"</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Three</h3>

<p>You ask, dear friends, the views of Henri and myself upon this
much discussed question of slavery.</p>

<p>Henriette dipped her pen and embarked upon another sheet of the
thin paper she kept for her foreign correspondence. It was the
first opportunity she had had for many days to answer the last
letter from the Reverend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod and his wife,
and her pen moved steadily on over the pages she filled with the
French words she so seldom heard nowadays. The parsonage was very
quiet, and since Henry had left to attend a Presbyterian Conference
in Hartford the day before, she had settled herself at his desk and
indulged in the luxury of a fire. He would be back late that night,
full of news to tell her and probably with a present in his
bag&mdash;a new book, perhaps, or a pair of gloves. One could never
tell what object his glance might light upon to admire and bring
back for her pleasure or adornment. He had urged her to accompany
him, as he had on several trips to Springfield, where he introduced
her with pride to old friends and the most casual acquaintances.
She would have enjoyed the visit to Hartford, but such journeys
were expensive and already Henriette had taken charge of the
household expenses and knew that extravagances must be carefully
considered and resolutely curbed.</p>

<p>Yes, I suppose we might be called Abolitionists, since we side
most ardently with those opposed to the institution of slavery [she
wrote]. You will understand the term better when you read the
copies of speeches by Mr. Sumner and Mr. William Lloyd Garrison
which I will also send you in a separate packet. Ever since my
arrival in America the most vital topic of discussion has been the
passing of the Fugitive Slave Bill, which has aroused much feeling
in the North and particularly here in New England. Can you imagine
being forced to turn from your doors an escaped negro who perhaps
still bears the marks of chains and blows upon his unfortunate
body, black though it be? Not only does this law deny one the right
to shelter such a fugitive, but it further requires that one return
him into slavery. How, one asks, can such injustice be sanctioned
in a free country? I know that I could not find it in my heart to
keep to the letter of the law were I personally to be put to the
test, which I most earnestly hope I may never be.</p>

<p>Yet, as my little Henri admits, it is not so simple a matter as
this. The runaway slave is but the symbol of something far more
complicated and intangible, which involves the constitution of this
Republic and the whole structure of the economic system of the
South. The latter, Henri believes, is at the bottom of the trouble,
and he grows very grave when I ask him what the end of it all will
be. For, as you know, cotton is needed in France and in Great
Britain, and it appears that only with slave labour can the supply
keep pace with the demand. So what is to be done? The Abolitionists
feel that there is but one course to take: free the slaves, even if
in so doing the South becomes bankrupt. The Southern States refuse
to be dictated to, and even threaten to withdraw from the Union,
and already there is a great agitation over this newly settled
territory of Kansas, whether it shall be admitted as a slave or a
free state. Each side claims the right to it, and I can only say
that it seems to me rather like a bone which two stubborn dogs are
each determined to possess. A sorry state of affairs.</p>

<p>You have doubtless read of the arrival of Kossuth on these
shores. He is the popular hero of the day, and there is much talk
of the cause of Hungarian patriotism. I rejoice that he has found
refuge in America even as I and other enforced exiles have
done.</p>

<p>Do you smile at this championship of my adopted country? Do the
agitations that rock this New World seem relatively unimportant to
you who witness the present crisis in France? Louis Philippe is
dead, and already the Revolution through which we lived, and of
which we hoped so much good might come, is forgotten in this new
imperialistic r&eacute;gime. It is hard for me to believe all that
you write. So Thiers's influence is failing and this new Napoleon's
eyes are fixed upon another throne! I do not know what I feel when
I think of all that has happened in less than five years. My head
reels before the shiftings of parties and persons.</p>

<p>She rose and lit the student lamp, laid more wood on the fire
and drew the curtains against the sudden darkness of mid-December.
She need not be interrupted by a summons to supper. Cassie had gone
to see her sick sister and would not return till late. It was good
sometimes to be alone, without demands, without the relentless
procession of small doings. She was grateful for such activity, for
all that bound her to Henry and the life he had chosen. She stood
smiling by the desk, thinking of his return, of his step outside
and the eager rush of words on his lips, the reassurance of his
eyes. Once more she took up the pen, and her thoughts began to flow
in the rhythm of French which lay behind her consciousness, ready
to rise like a hidden spring of water.</p>

<p>Here I sit, secure and content [she wrote on], in a world you do
not know, while the Paris of which I was once a part is shaken by
new reverberations. First Revolution and now, if what you predicted
in your last letter comes to pass, a Second Empire. Like you, I
have grave misgivings. I am too much of a Republican at heart to
rejoice in the return to imperialism. My grandfather would have
died happy if he could have known that another Napoleon had been
recalled to France. Yet I do not trust what I hear of him. He is
neither an aristocrat nor an inspired peasant. He is, it seems to
me, merely a stupid fellow upon whom opportunity has smiled.</p>

<p>Ah, my dear, dear friends, how changed is the Paris we shared!
It is as if time had reversed our positions, for you seem to live
in a strange world, not I myself who have journeyed.</p>

<p>You ask after my health and happiness. It is easily told in the
small space that remains. My little Henri is all generosity and
affection, and I can only say that he has multiplied all that was
good in life a hundred times over, and he shares my difficulties
with me. Already his influence grows in religious circles, though,
between ourselves, I feel he is destined for a wider scope than one
church can afford. His gifts are inclined to writing, rather than
to preaching. I notice that he is more happy and absorbed at a desk
composing his sermons than when he stands in the pulpit delivering
them. But for all that he has won the respect and devotion of his
congregation.</p>

<p>As for my part, often I fail; but Henri is my unfailing
prompter, and I try to be unobtrusively adequate. I attend all
religious services and church gatherings, and return the calls of
the ladies of the congregation. I visit the sick and take my place
in the sewing circle and missionary meetings.</p>

<p><i>"Ciel!"</i> She dropped her pen and left the unfinished
letter at a sudden recollection. "The 'Little Season'&mdash;I did
all but forget it!"</p>

<p>With relief she saw that the hands of the clock pointed to a
quarter-past six. She had remembered in time to save herself the
embarrassment of arriving late at the home of Mrs. Adam Weeks,
where the affair was to be held. The invitation had come several
days ago, and she had forgotten to mention it to Henry before his
departure. It was unfortunate that he would not be able to attend.
She sighed, thinking how she would miss his presence beside her,
for social functions in West Springfield were still a little
baffling and unpredictable. But she would go. She would take
special pains with her toilette and array herself with the best her
wardrobe had to offer, exactly as if she were going to the opera or
an evening reception. Never should it be said of Mrs. Henry Field
that she did not make the most of whatever Society had to
offer!</p>

<p>Though her teeth chattered in the chillness of the bedroom, she
hummed as she set the lamp on her bureau. This "Little Season" had
a festive, almost Continental sound, she thought as she began to
rearrange her hair. Seven o'clock did seem a rather strange hour,
too early for a soir&eacute;e, and there had been no mention of
supper. But she no longer questioned the times at which her
neighbours ate and rose and retired. It was unfortunate that she
had not thought to ask Cassie what to expect of a "Little Season,"
for Cassie's advice had proved invaluable on more than one
occasion. It was a pity, too, that Cassie should miss this first
appearance of the bottle-green taffeta, with its low-cut bodice and
black lace overdrapings on the skirt that boasted more yards of
crinoline stiffening than any other in town. Cassie had almost
worshipped that dress as it hung waiting for an opportunity to be
worn.</p>

<p>She had forgotten how becoming it was! The brilliant colour anti
lustre of the silk set off her best points. It intensified the
whiteness of her bare neck and arms, the sheen of her hair which
she had brushed from smooth bands into curls, and greenish light
into her eyes. The black lace gave an elegance and grace to the
wide bell-shaped skirt that pleased her as she caught glimpses of
it in the tilting pier glass that had been transported from New
York at such peril of being shattered. She snapped on a pair of
black enamel bracelets, sprinkled her handkerchief liberally with
vervain toilet water and hurried down the stairs. She sighed at the
necessity for goloshes and mittens, and for a woollen shawl to
cover her head; but these would soon be discarded as the butterfly
sheds its cocoon of dull protective wrappings.</p>

<p>Her spirits continued high as she left the dark house behind and
started on her way. She felt exhilarated, walking abroad after dark
with only the far sound of sleigh bells and the crunching of snow
under her hurrying feet to break the quiet. These winter skies of
America thrilled her with their high, unhindered clearness. The
deep blue dome, she often thought, seemed arched to fit a race of
giants. She knew where to look for Orion and the Pleiades, for the
Big Dipper tilted above the pale steeple of Henry's church. The
stars were particularly brilliant to-night, almost as sharply
pointed as the tinsel ones she used to help Berthe and Raynald
fashion to hang above the carved <i>cr&egrave;che</i> at Christmas.
But those two would be past all that now. They were no longer the
children who had pressed close, whispering holiday secrets in her
ears. Berthe was no doubt betrothed, probably married, and Raynald
would be a tall young student with a man's deep voice.</p>

<p>The thought of the approaching season warmed her with joyful
anticipation, for this would be like no other she had ever known.
Christmas with Henry in a home of her own! Soon the house would be
filled with spicy fragrance from Cassie's kitchen. She would ask
freckled children, with whom she had begun to make friends, to take
her to the woods to gather greens and those shining scarlet berries
that grew by the frozen swamp. She would fasten these in sprays at
her windows and door, and she would herself make a beautiful wreath
to hang below the pulpit. There would be Christmas hymns, not the
familiar noels of her childhood, but others that also echoed "Peace
on earth; good will toward, men." And Henry would open the great
Bible and read in his earnest voice of Wise Men and Shepherds and
of a star over Bethlehem: "And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye
shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a
manger."</p>

<p>She caught her breath sharply at the miracle behind those words;
at the miracle of new life that assailed her everywhere. If only
she could know that before another Christmas...She longed for a
child so deeply that often she prayed in secret as those other
wives of the Old Testament, Sarah, Rachel and Hannah, had prayed
before her. Their tears had been rewarded, and surely she had a
right to hope that the miracle would not be denied to her and to
Henry, who hoped no less than she. She had only to watch his face
when a child was put into his arms for baptism to know the thoughts
with which he would never reproach her. But to-night all things
seemed possible as she hurried through the cold in her handsomest
dress, warm with self-confidence and the knowledge that Henry would
be proud of her upon his return.</p>

<p>As she neared the Weeks's house she overtook several
neighbours&mdash;Mrs. Asa Deane and her daughter Rebecca; Miss
Annie Stillwell and her sister Jane; Mrs. John Holden and her two
daughters, Hattie and Ruth. It surprised her a little to notice
that they were without male escort, but she decided that perhaps
this was not so strange since the Misses Stillwell were unmarried
and Mrs. Holden's husband suffered from rheumatism. Mrs. Deane was
a widow of substantial stature, the mother of many married sons and
daughters, who clung to this remaining child with a tenacity that
puzzled Henriette. She had already noticed a number of such sturdy
older women leaning upon frail young daughters.</p>

<p>"Poor things!" she thought now, watching Rebecca's girlish
figure piloting her mother up the path. "They are like vines trying
to support trees. I do not think it is according to nature; but
perhaps there will be some young men to divert them at the
party!"</p>

<p>The ladies paused to greet her and remark upon the unusual
coldness of the weather.</p>

<p>"We most always have a white Christmas, but we don't count on it
getting below zero much before January. Still, you might's well get
used to it early."</p>

<p>"I do not mind the cold," she assured them. "When it is so clear
and fine it makes me feel gay. I had my first ride on a sled day
before yesterday. Your grandson, Mrs. Deane, was most gallant and
lent us his sled. My Henri wished to give me the experience."</p>

<p>"Yes, we heard." There was a world of disapproval in the three
words.</p>

<p>Henriette felt it and hurried on.</p>

<p>"There is as much and sometimes more of the boy than of the
minister in Henri," she explained. "Your grandson was astounded
that he had not forgotten how to take a sled down a steep hill. I
am sorry," she added as they reached the doorstep, "that Henri
could not come to-night, but he is still away at the Conference. It
is a thousand pities he should miss such festivity."</p>

<p>She saw a mystified look upon their faces in the light from the
open door, and puzzled glances passed from one to another at her
words. What had she said that was wrong? She had only made apology
for her husband's absence. Ah, well! She gave an audible sigh and
followed them into Mrs. Weeks's hall. It was a large house, for
their hostess had been left in comfortable circumstances by her
late husband. She was one of the pillars of the church and helped
liberally in its support. Her donations to the sewing and
missionary circles did much to relieve the financial strain of the
parish, and she had been particularly thoughtful of Henry during
the months he had preached there in his bachelor days.</p>

<p>Henriette moved eagerly towards her hostess, a woman as solidly
built as her house, dressed in a severe grey alpaca with bands of
black. She returned Henriette's greeting with a subdued smile and
inclination of the head. From the parlour beyond there was no
reassuring buzz of conversation.</p>

<p>"It is strange," she thought as she laid aside her wraps. "They
speak in whispers, almost as if there were a death in the house.
But I should have known if it were a funeral. They would have sent
for Henri."</p>

<p>She saw that the guests were being motioned towards the parlour,
and she hastened to follow them. But as she removed her dolman a
button caught in the lace of her dress, and by the time she had
disentangled it those who had arrived with her had already gone
forward to join the rest. She followed them, the crisp crackle of
yards of taffeta sounding about her as she went. The parlour was
chill as a vault from disuse. Its cold smote upon her bare
shoulders as she crossed the threshold, and she shivered
involuntarily. She had expected a cheerful blaze of firelight and
the glow of tapers in a candelabra, but instead the high-ceilinged
room appeared cavernous, lit as it was by one oil table-lamp and a
pair of candles. She paused to take stock of her surroundings, and
as she did so she was aware of a distinct stir about her, an
audible gasp from a simultaneous intaking of breath. A score of
women stiffened in their chairs, and the hush that followed her
entrance was more ominous than a thunderclap.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ma!" she heard young Cora Weeks whisper faintly in the
silence. "Oh, Ma!"</p>

<p>Somehow Henriette found herself in one of the chairs that had
been set in a large circle about the room. As her eyes became more
accustomed to the dimness, and the shock of her own surprise grew
less, she realised that the room was entirely given over to women
members of the church. Without exception they were soberly clad and
their hands were folded decorously in their laps while they waited
in silence. Their eyes kept turning upon her, large with curiosity
and disapproval, only to be lowered once more to their folded
hands. It was disconcerting, Henriette thought, not knowing whether
to disregard or meet their glances, and it was certainly not
according to the school of social etiquette in which she had been
trained. Their hostess moved at last to the centre of the room,
where the lamp burned on a round, cloth-covered table.</p>

<p>"A s&eacute;ance!" It came to her suddenly that this must be the
solution. "Ah, in that case they should have explained to me. But
at least it will be diverting!"</p>

<p>S&eacute;ances had been quite the vogue in Paris before she
left. She had attended one once with the Remeys, and though
naturally unsympathetic to the macabre, she had been rather
impressed by certain phenomena and the fragmentary messages
received. She had not suspected that her neighbours were interested
in the occult, but that showed how she had misjudged them. And
Henry had certainly never warned her of this particular trend. She
rather doubted that he would approve. Well, she could do nothing
about that at the moment. Mrs. Weeks had taken up a small black
book and was about to speak.</p>

<p>"We are gathered together to-night," she began solemnly, "as has
long been our custom, for a Little Season of Prayer."</p>

<p>There was a light in the study window as Henriette came in sight
of the parsonage two hours later. Henry was back! She felt for the
icy door-knob and flung herself upon him in a whirl of taffeta and
shawl fringes.</p>

<p>"Oh, my little Henri!" Her cheeks were cold against his, her
lips warm and tremulous. "Oh, my Henri, such an evening! And you
were not here, and I did not know. Again I did not know, and all
the ladies&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had been troubled at not finding her there. And now to have
her appear, a vision of colour and vehemence, pouring hysterical
phrases into his ears, went to his head like champagne. They clung
together as if they had been parted for years, and it was only
after much questioning that Henry was able to reconstruct the
evening.</p>

<p>"What is this you say, my dear?" He could hardly listen to her
words, she was so vividly alive and beautiful in the green and
black dress, with her bare white shoulders and her curls in warm
showers about her tingling cheeks. "You have been&mdash;where? And
what is this you keep saying about a Little Season?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Henri! At first I thought it would be a soir&eacute;e, and
so I put on my best for it. For your sake I did it, and I did not
think about the neck."</p>

<p>"The neck&mdash;yes, it is a little low, but very becoming. Go
on."</p>

<p>"And then when they sat in that dim room and all so
still&mdash;I thought it must be a s&eacute;ance. But it was not.
They prayed. Oh, Henri, we have prayed and prayed! It was&mdash;I
cannot tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes were wide and tragic, her arms flung out in a dramatic
gesture of appeal, yet the corners of her mouth twitched like a
child's, uncertain whether to laugh or to cry.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Henry urged with tender curiosity, "why you are so
upset. Perhaps your costume did startle them somewhat. But surely
the prayers did not trouble you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Henri, it was for <i>me</i> they prayed! Each one of the
ladies in turn. First they got down upon their knees and they
prayed for many things; but before they said 'Amen' they prayed for
me."</p>

<p>"But that cannot be possible, my dear. What makes you think so?
What did they say?"</p>

<p>"They prayed for that poor heathen that had come amongst them.
No, I am not mistaken. I listened and listened before it came my
turn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your turn? You also prayed, Henriette?"</p>

<p>"What could I do, since it was expected of me?"</p>

<p>Henry's throat felt dry with apprehension. But his heart was
divided between resentment at these women and a sudden flood of
loving protectiveness. He had been to many Seasons of Prayer, and
he could visualise the scene as if he had actually been present.
Henriette rustling to her knees in yards of taffeta, her bare
shoulders gleaming in the subdued religious light, her clear voice
with its unexpected accents, ringing out authoritatively in what he
dared not think.</p>

<p>"And what did you say?" he pressed her gently.</p>

<p>"I prayed for that poor heathen, too," she told him simply.</p>

<p>He stared at her helplessly for a moment before his own lips
began to twitch. Then a spasm of laughter suddenly overcame his
anxiety. Only Henriette, he reflected with pride and a host of
misgivings, would have taken up the challenge and carried it
through.</p>

<p>"But, my dear," he sighed when they had both regained their
composure, "if only you had asked me about the Little Season! It
seems impossible that you should not have known what to
expect."</p>

<p>"Ah, my Henri!" she protested. "Here in America you have seasons
in the year and you season your food. How was I to know?"</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Four</h3>

<p>Always when she thought of those years on the banks of the
Connecticut River, Henriette was to remember the very tones of the
bell that summoned worshippers to the old white church; the clatter
of wheels and hoofs over the long bridge to Springfield; the voice
of Cassie Sampson lifted in song above the pleasant activities of
kitchen and pantry. She was to remember the revelation of spring,
when ice broke and floated down the river and water overflowed the
lower meadows in sheets of quicksilver. There was the early wonder
of pussy-willows the neighbours' children brought her in
preparation for the great wonder of bloodroot and hepatica and
arbutus hiding its incredible pink and white under last year's
leaves in the woods behind the town.</p>

<p>Henry had brought her the first bunch, but even he had been
unprepared for the reception she gave this fragrant symbol of New
England.</p>

<p>"Henri," she had said, bending over the rosy buds and starry
white flowers he put in her hands "It is the strangest, sweetest
perfume in the world&mdash;cool like snow, yet sweet as spice.
There is&mdash;how shall I say ?&mdash;a wild innocence about it
that makes me wish to cry!"</p>

<p>There were many things that made her wish to cry because they
moved her by their strangeness and unexpected beauty. There was the
sudden yellow of cowslips fringing brown rushing brooks and
dandelions like gold coins in the new grass. There was delicate
shadblow in the woods when she drove with Henry on his parish
calls, or when she went exploring with some young neighbour and
returned with wet shoes and draggled skirts and a basket of ferns
or violet plants to set out in her border.</p>

<p>"We have seen a bluebird," she would call to him through the
study window. "It moved in the sun like a flash of pure
cobalt-blue. Katy and Jane Whitcomb tell me it is good luck to make
a wish upon the first bluebird of the spring. Did you know that, my
Henri? No? Ah, well, I did so for us both."</p>

<p>Her wish was invariably the same. It lay upon her heart even as
she knew it lay upon his, whether they made mention of it or not.
Her candour in expressing a wish for children startled her more
reticent women neighbours, though her open envy of large families
and her appreciation of their own offspring was disarming.</p>

<p>"It's tempting Providence to want young ones so bad," Cassie
reproved her sometimes. "The surest way to get 'em is not to hanker
so. But there, who am I to talk?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Cassie, I cannot but feel bitterness when I see women who
have so many more than they want."</p>

<p>"I know, it goes against the grain."</p>

<p>"I spent my youth on the children of others, and now when the
time comes to hope for my own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, it's pain if you have 'em and pain if you don't. It's the
pattern we're cut on&mdash;women, I mean."</p>

<p>She found herself turning to Cassie Sampson often in those first
years of her marriage. They talked for hours sometimes, and Cassie
told her many things&mdash;how to keep jelly from clouding and the
best way to wash woollens, and now and again of her meagre
childhood and the hoarded secrets of her own heart. She came to
know, little by little, why Cassie had never married.</p>

<p>"He was all set to marry a girl in his home town before he came
to help his uncle in the mill," she explained. "I was working in
the place where he boarded or I'd never have got to say
good-morning to him even. He had lovely manners, always spoke soft
and pleasant, not rough and loud-mouthed like the rest, and you
wouldn't have wanted to see a handsomer man when he was dressed to
go to church. I've had my chances since, but somehow he spoiled me
for taking 'em. Well, it's something to know what love is, even if
it don't get you anywhere in the world."</p>

<p>In those recurring seasons of orchard bloom, of green summer
warmth and autumn brilliance, of winter whiteness, she came also to
know her neighbours and to share certain experiences with them.
When Ora Newton was failing fast and poor Mrs. Newton grieved that
she could not afford the luxury of a daguerreotype likeness,
Henriette made a crayon portrait of the girl for the mother to
keep. When Will Hardy's house and barn burned to the ground she
took the Hardy twins in for a month till another house could be
found for the family. She gave lame Ellen Riggs lessons in painting
and fine needlework and let several of the older girls practise on
her piano. When <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> came out and she owned the
only copy in town, she did not keep it to herself. Any one could
borrow it for the asking, and when it was returned at last with the
pages dropping from between the covers and with thumb marks and
tear blisters all over it she did not complain of the damage.</p>

<p>"Books were written to be read," she had said. "I am sure it
would gladden Mrs. Stowe's heart to see this copy."</p>

<p>Yes, they all agreed she was generous and meant well once they
grew used to her queer ways. And she in turn came to recognise, if
not to understand, their reserves. It was a small world, but as she
became part of it the same currents of life and death, of marriage,
success and calamity swept her along with them as surely if not as
fiercely as they had done in Paris years before.</p>

<p>Then there were visits to Stockbridge and New York, to
Williamstown where Henry had spent his college years, to the old
home at Haddam and other Connecticut River towns. There were
frequent trips to Westfield and across the river to the thriving
nearby city of 'Springfield, which seemed busy and almost
cosmopolitan compared to the smaller community. Here she could
attend an occasional lecture or concert, and here she was included
in much social activity of an informal sort. The <i>Springfield
Republican</i> was a newspaper of distinction exerting a powerful
influence, and its editor, Samuel Bowles, entertained a wide and
unusual circle of friends. Henry Field and his vivacious French
wife were made welcome here, as they were in the home of J. G.
Holland. This rising poet and essayist soon became a particularly
congenial host and friend. He delighted in Henriette's apt
comments, her humour and Gallic charm. She expanded in this
atmosphere of culture and hospitality. They knew the world beyond
the Connecticut Valley, these New England men and women. They
recognised the quality of her mind and the shrewdness of her quick
response. They listened when she had an opinion to offer, and she
snatched eagerly at all they had to say upon matters foreign and
domestic. Now it was of the restoration of the French Empire under
Louis Napoleon of which they talked; now the forthcoming
inauguration of the Democratic President Franklin Pierce, or the
all-absorbing topics of Slavery and Secession. Their words wove to
and fro like shuttles across the long dinner-tables while food
cooled on the plates before them. Some of these new friends and
acquaintances, Henriette guessed, were fully aware of her story and
of her part in the Praslin murder case, but there was no trace of
curiosity or constraint in their meetings. They accepted her on her
own terms as the wife of a neighbouring friend and minister for
whom they bore deep affection and high regard.</p>

<p>In summer when the weather was fine she often accompanied Henry
if he exchanged pulpits with neighbouring ministers. These
expeditions pleased her. She delighted in the long drives behind a
hired horse. It was so pleasant to ride along unfamiliar roads
through the rich farming country that Henry knew and loved. Even
when he grew absent-minded discussing some new article or his next
sermon and they found themselves miles from their destination, it
was adventurous, and farmers and their families were always kind
and hospitable. Once they drove to Amherst, and Henry preached to
the college students, a broad-shouldered, long-legged group that
moved Henriette by reason of their youth and earnest expressions.
Raynald, she reminded herself, must have reached this age by now.
What was he like? She seemed to see him in every thoughtful,
dark-eyed face that passed.</p>

<p>Later they were entertained for dinner by the most prominent
citizen of the town, a distinguished lawyer named Dickinson.
Henriette was impressed by the dignified atmosphere of that home
with its large, beautifully proportioned rooms, its shelves of
books and handsome furniture and also by the arresting grace and
spirit of his elder daughter, a girl in her early twenties named
Emily. Her hair and eyes were the rich russet of oak leaves in
October, and her skin as white as the rose she pressed upon
Henriette at parting. She was never to forget the gesture or the
haunting beauty of this girl, though years afterwards she heard it
whispered that Miss Dickinson had turned remote and shy, flitting
through the rooms of that house and across the lawns in her dresses
of white dimity like some pale moth. Strange, she thought,
remembering how vivid the girl had been that day and how intently
she had listened when Henriette spoke of Paris.</p>

<p>And so the months passed. It was 1853, and she and Henry were
well launched into their third year of marriage. In Stockbridge the
Reverend David Dudley Field and his wife Submit would celebrate
their Golden Wedding in October, and their children and
grandchildren would gather in the old parsonage to honour them. It
would be a great family reunion, and Henriette did not look forward
to it. Not that she would have stayed away. The old parson and his
wife were dear to her, and she knew she held a place of her own in
their affections. But she would always be an outsider in this close
family circle. She had made friends with the brothers and their
wives, and she was fond of Emilia Ann Brewer, who had returned with
her missionary husband from the Far East to live in Connecticut.
Mary Elizabeth and she were congenial, and now this youngest
daughter had been married for more than a year and was expecting a
child the coming winter. Matthew was still an unknown quantity, but
he and his family were back from several years of bridge building
in the South. Only Stephen, prospering in California, and the lost
brother Timothy would be absent. No, what she dreaded was the
thought of the grandchildren who would fill those rooms with
promise, with the healthy din of their young activity. How could
she bear to meet that press of new life, knowing that she and Henry
could claim none of it for their own? How could she harden herself
to meet the ordeal?</p>

<p>She tried not to let Henry guess her thoughts as they set off
together on the journey. He was eager as a boy on a holiday. Almost
he seemed to have slipped away from her, he was so full of the long
anticipated reunion. At such times she was more than ever aware of
the closeness of these family ties. It came over her, as upon her
first visit to the Stockbridge home, that no matter how far this
group of brothers and sisters might scatter and disagree, they were
still branches of the tree that bore them. She did not begrudge
this deep-rooted strength that she felt in them. Yet she was after
all a grafted branch. Only if she were fruitful could she truly be
part of the growing whole. It made her feel lonely and even a
little sad, knowing how it would be as she sat among them all
to-morrow.</p>

<p>"If only Stephen could have come," Henry sighed regretfully at
intervals in the seat beside her. "I know he will be thinking of
us, though when the sun reaches California to-morrow the Golden
Wedding will be half over. I hope the new room David and Cyrus are
building on the parsonage will be done in time. Did you remember to
pack those books I promised to lend father, my dear? I laid them
with my sermon in the study, but I am not sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Henri, they are at the bottom of the valise; and I also
put in the last two numbers of <i>Harper's.</i> Your mother enjoys
them."</p>

<p>"Good. I should have forgotten. You seem quiet to-day, my dear.
What makes you so silent?"</p>

<p>"I am listening to you instead, my little Henri." She smiled and
laid her hand on his with one of her quick demonstrative gestures.
"You are happy hurrying home to your parents. There will be so many
of you, it makes me feel a little&mdash;well, a little like a bird
of a different feather when I see how you all flock back to the old
nest."</p>

<p>Henry laughed.</p>

<p>"It's not that I want to leave our nest," he reassured her; "at
least only for a few days, and because this is a great occasion.
Think of being married for fifty years and living to see your
children and grandchildren gather from every direction to be with
you."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered quickly, turning to the train window that he
might not catch the glint of tears in her eyes. "I have thought how
it must be, and I rejoice for your father and mother."</p>

<p>"Fifty years," she repeated to herself as the train rolled on
through the glory of scarlet and gold and russet of New England in
October. "I am over forty now. Henri and I shall be lucky if we
have half that number together."</p>

<p>She moved instinctively closer to his side, and the words he was
saying mingled with the grinding of the train wheels. They mattered
less than his presence. Years in themselves meant little or
nothing. It was what one shared in them that counted.</p>

<p>They had an hour between trains at a country junction. Presently
the little station was deserted save for themselves, and a
nondescript dog stretched out in the sun. A distant mill whistled
the noon dinner-hour, and from the houses across the tracks the
fragrance of food on stoves mingled with the dusty sweetness of
summer's end&mdash;wild grapes, goldenrod and asters, apples and
bonfires. They found a shady bench under a nearby maple and spread
out the lunch they had brought. About their feet crickets were
clamorous in the burnt brown grass and above their heads the sun
came warmly through matted gold. Now and again a yellow leaf let go
its hold and spiralled down to fall on their laps in noiseless
surrender. Henriette reached for one and held it between her
fingers.</p>

<p>"It goes in beauty, now its season is over," she said, "like
your parents, Henri, in golden fulfilment. I think that must be
what Nature intended for people as well as trees."</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "it should be so. May I borrow your words for
the reunion to-morrow?"</p>

<p>She gave him one of her swift smiles.</p>

<p>"My little Henri, when we are together like this I hardly know
which of us thought or spoke, we are so close and the world is so
beautiful&mdash;almost too beautiful sometimes to bear."</p>

<p>But before he could answer her their attention was attracted to
the figure of a man striding towards them along the tracks. He was
a tall man, well over six feet, with broad shoulders and a powerful
frame under the loosely fitting grey coat. He carried his hat and a
shapeless carpet-bag as if he had forgotten them, and his hair was
thick and burnished red in the noon sun. At sight of him Henry
sprang to his feet with an eager hail.</p>

<p>"Matthew&mdash;it's Matthew!"</p>

<p>"Henry!" The answer came deep and vibrant as the long legs
quickened their pace.</p>

<p>This, then, was the brother of whom Henriette had heard much;
the self-taught engineer and inventor who had been busy with his
bridge building in the South. She watched the two as they met on
the wooden platform.</p>

<p>"Ah, these Field brothers!" she thought, smiling at the warmth
of their greeting while she waited for Henry to remember that he
had left his wife sitting under a tree. "How strong is the bond
between them!"</p>

<p>She felt sure she would have known Matthew for a member of the
clan wherever she had encountered him. There was a marked family
resemblance, though in some peculiar way he seemed a composite of
them all. He had Jonathan's build and ruddy skin; Cyrus's bushy red
hair; a look of David about the brows and a smile that was frank
and illuminating like Henry's. As they came towards her, this older
brother towering above the younger, she felt that he belonged more
to the earth than the rest. His big feet moved as if he were in
accord with the laws of gravity and magnetic forces. When he lifted
his eyes to the sun one knew that he was on friendly terms with it
and needed no instruments to measure its course. The elements had
marked him for their own. All that he knew he had somehow acquired
by natural keenness of eye and intuition. He must, she felt as she
studied him, have been born knowing how to build bridges and dam
streams, as beavers know their craft without consulting books. It
was in keeping with the pleasant simplicity of this man that his
boots were in need of polishing, his coat worn at the seams. She
felt his easy kindness in the direct glance of his deep-set eyes,
in the friendliness of his handclasp. But for all his powerful
frame and tawny colour, she felt that he lacked the relentless
mental force of David, the driving energy and will-power of
Cyrus.</p>

<p>"I like this brother," she decided, "though he will never make
his mark in the world. I think he will always remain pleasant and
shabby and hopeful."</p>

<p>As he shared their lunch Matthew answered Henry's questions and
alternated between schemes for his next business ventures and
accounts of his family. Yes, he explained, they were back for good
from Kentucky and Tennessee; his wife Clarissa hoped they could
settle down again and have the children all under the roof of the
old farm-house in Southwick. They had been scattered too long, and
the new baby, born in July, was a fine little boy, but not robust.
All this junketing from pillar to post and malaria and mosquitoes
were bad for children.</p>

<p>"Wait till you hear the young ones talk," the father laughed.
"They learned from the darkies, and I doubt if father and mother
will make out half they say. They all went to Stockbridge
yesterday. Caty is old enough to help tend the baby. But Clarissa's
got her hands full this winter wherever we go."</p>

<p>Later, in the train, they listened to his talk of conditions in
the South. You couldn't condemn slave owners wholesale, he
admitted. It was like everything else in the world, some good and
some bad in it. But it was no place for a New Englander right now.
Feeling had been growing bitter these last few years, and this book
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> had stirred up a perfect hornets' nest of
trouble. Clarissa had tried to buy a copy of it on a visit to
Charleston and had been nearly run out of the city for mentioning
the name. Well, he had built his bridges at Nashville and
Frankfort, but he didn't fool himself they would last long. Bridges
and railroads were the first things to go when there was any
fighting, and he'd seen and heard enough to know they were heading
for that.</p>

<p>"We won't live to see it, maybe," he told them, "but my boys
will; and it'll be war between the States and no mistake."</p>

<p>Henriette listened and joined in the questioning. But she could
not make herself believe in even the remote possibility of war. It
seemed, in that golden, glowing countryside through which they
travelled, that security and fruitfulness must be the only
realities in so fair a world. Indian summer had taken the valley of
the Housatonic. The familiar hills were softened in a mellow haze,
the trees everywhere were arrayed like Solomon in all his glory.
Her eyes ached with the brilliance, and her heart sagged under the
weight of external beauty that had been laid upon it.</p>

<p>"There they are!" Matthew shouted as they came in sight of the
old parsonage and an eager group hurried out to meet them.
Henriette recognised Matthew's three older children, two boys and a
girl, for they had been left to attend school in the North the last
few years. The others were strangers to her. Matthew's wife,
Clarissa, was a slight woman with a worn, sweet face. She held a
baby in her arms, and two young children pressed close to her
skirts. One of these was a boy of seven, red-headed and sturdy like
his father, the other a little girl with hair that matched the
late-blooming marigolds in the border by the door.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>la belle petite!"</i> The words rose involuntarily to
Henriette's lips at the child's beauty. "It is too much, too much,"
she sighed, "a world and a child like this&mdash;all in one
day."</p>

<p>She was hardly more than a baby, not much over two years, yet
all the innocent perfection of childhood seemed centred in her. Not
since Berthe had danced gay as a young leaf into the room in the
Rue de Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, not since Raynald had beckoned
her with imperious trustfulness, had Henriette been so drawn to a
child. She saw that under the tawny curls, the eyes were clear as
brown brook water, the tiny features firm and delicately cut for
all their softness. Such tender confidence, such directness of
gaze&mdash;Henriette trembled before them and could not look away.
So they continued to regard each other with grave understanding
while the babel continued on every side.</p>

<p>Then, almost as if some inner signal had passed between them,
the small fingers loosened from the skirt folds they had been
clutching. Henriette made no move but waited while the little girl
came steadily and surely towards her across the grass. She felt her
throat contract and her breath grow painful as each step brought
her nearer. She tried to steel her heart to meet that advance, yet
she could not resist it.</p>

<p>"This is Clara," she heard someone saying presently.</p>

<p>But she had no notion who spoke the introductions for she was
only aware of the warm reality of that small hand in her own. The
family group about them retreated in a blur, and the tightness that
had held her in its grip all day also retreated in that moment to
which she would return in memory all the remaining years of her
life. Together they followed the others into the house and together
they celebrated the Golden Wedding next day.</p>

<p>The day was a long one of reunion and rejoicing. Emilia, David
and Jonathan's families were there; Cyrus, back from months of
travel in South America with his neighbours, came bearing gifts;
letters were opened and read with moist eyes; the noonday meal was
eaten with rows of faces on either side turned towards the two who
had spread and blessed that board fifty years before. Apples and
pumpkins and ears of Indian corn heaped the centre in a rich pile,
like the early symbols of plenty, cherished by all such households,
time out of mind. Even the daguerreotype artist who had been
brought from the city to commemorate the event by his skill, rose
nobly to the challenge. Somehow he managed to crowd all the sons
and daughters and grandchildren about the frail old couple into his
picture. The sun shone on all the heads; the crickets shrilled
under the tumult of eager voices, and the parsonage doors stood
open to all who came and went. It was a great occasion with
something of Old Testament dignity and magnificence about it.</p>

<p>And Henriette, who had dreaded the day, found herself moved by
the sight of these generations that filled the rooms with a great
press of life. Here, she thought, past accomplishment and the
promise of greater accomplishment met and paused for a brief
moment. Tomorrow they would all be scattered again; to-day they
lifted their voices in the Doxology and bowed their heads as the
old minister rose to give them his blessing.</p>

<p>"And His truth endureth from generation to generation." The
voice of the preacher and the voice of father and grandfather were
one as he spoke the words with solemn pride.</p>

<p>And always Henriette was aware of the little girl who stayed
close at her side; whose small body relaxed drowsily as the long
festivities ended and Henry rose to offer evening prayers. She sat
at the edge of that group, yet she did not feel apart from them as
she had expected to be. She was proud of Henry, standing erect in
his best black coat with the late afternoon light lending radiance
to his face. All the fullness of his heart was in his voice as he
read from the family Bible.</p>

<p>"'The lines have fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have
a goodly heritage."</p>

<p>She lifted the sleepy child to her lap and settled the head that
was so heavy for all its softness into the crook of her arm. The
fine bright hair lay warm against the silk of her dress; the small
chest rose and fell with intricate rhythm of life.</p>

<p>"Let us pray together," Henry's voice was saying across the
room.</p>

<p>She heard him faintly through a sudden tide of happiness that
overwhelmed her. Yesterday she would have slipped to her knees as
the rest were doing, but for once she belonged with those other
women who bowed their heads without disturbing the children in
their arms. This was the ancient pattern for which women were
fashioned from the beginning of time. Perhaps it did not matter
that the child was not one's own.</p>

<p>That night she and Henry slept in the upper bedroom that had
been his in boyhood. They talked late of the Golden Wedding and all
the goodness which had flowed to and from that home for half a
century. But they had been silent a long time before she ventured
to speak of what concerned her more personally.</p>

<p>"Henri," she began, "I have been guilty of a sin to-day. I broke
a commandment."</p>

<p>He turned to her mystified, but she cut short his protest.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my Henri! You know the one I mean. I have coveted thy
brother's child."</p>

<p>He felt her tremble beside him in the darkness.</p>

<p>"There are laws of nature that go back even farther than those
of Moses," he reminded her, "and I think you were following them
to-day. And as for breaking a commandment it seems to me that you
were fulfilling another. To love thy neighbour as thyself also
means thy neighbour's child."</p>

<p>"Oh, Henri, you are comforting. You make goodness not a
difficult virtue but a simple pleasure."</p>

<p>And then, as if the inspiration were entirely his own and not an
answer to a question she had not asked, he suggested that it might
relieve Clarissa and Matthew at this time if they took the little
girl back for a visit in West Springfield.</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Five</h3>

<p>Henry's sermon barrel in the hall closet was full to
overflowing, but still he spent longer and longer hours at his
study desk. It had taken only a little urging from Henriette for
him to recast certain of his discourses into more literary form and
send them off to various newspapers and religious periodicals in
Springfield, Boston and New York. Few of these carefully copied
manuscripts in his flowing, legible hand returned to him. In fact
there began to be requests for more, and even small drafts arrived
to be added to the funds deposited in a Springfield savings bank.
Henriette took charge of these and the family finances, for though
she lacked skill in cooking and other domestic arts she had been
born with a passion for thrift. Under her shrewd management the
household was run comfortably and with a margin of profit on
Henry's small salary.</p>

<p>"We must think beyond the Connecticut Valley, my Henri," she
would remind him when they discussed finances. "You were not meant
to stay a country minister all your life. There will be larger work
for you to do, and we must be ready when that time comes. I think
it would be well that you reminded the editor who published your
article on 'The New Rome' that you have as yet received no
payment."</p>

<p>Such letters were more difficult for generous, absent-minded
Henry than the writing of half a dozen such articles. He was simple
enough in his own tastes. Books and travel and an occasional
indulgence in the matter of presents for her were his chief
extravagances. But money in itself meant nothing to him except that
it disappeared mysteriously from his pockets. Time and again
Henriette had to curb his impulse to give away more than they could
afford.</p>

<p>"One of us must be prudent," she would tell herself. "It seems
that I have been elected to that office!"</p>

<p>It was at her suggestion that he brought out the journal he had
kept during his European travels of 1847 and 1848. Together they
read and relived those months of change and upheaval. Strange to
read his entries about the Praslin case, his earliest mention of
Mademoiselle D., the remarks concerning her in her imprisonment at
the Conciergerie and his burst of spontaneous enthusiasm written
after their first meeting at the reception.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she told him, raising her eyes that had filled with
tears to his, "sometimes I cannot believe that this woman you
mention could ever have been I."</p>

<p>"I am changed, too," he said. "You have given me so much of
yourself."</p>

<p>As they read those closely packed pages evening after evening
she was more than ever struck by his ability to put into words not
only the very look and colour and atmosphere of a place, but the
character and temperament of the people in it. She was amazed by
his power of analysis as well as by the vividness of his
descriptions. He was not only a born traveller with an
extraordinary knowledge of history and the classics; he had a human
understanding that made him see with the eyes of a simple man as
well as the mind of a scholar. To Henry the past was always showing
through the immediate present. He was able without apparent effort
to link the two so that neither lost its identity.</p>

<p>"Henri," she told him with conviction, "this journal of yours
must not lie gathering dust in a desk drawer. You should take out
what is significant and join it with the events that have followed.
In time you will have enough sketches to make a book. Ah, how is it
that you miss nothing of any scene or chance conversation, yet you
never notice if your pocket is being picked or your umbrella
forgotten!"</p>

<p>He smiled and admitted his inconsistency, but her words had set
the machinery of his mind in motion. He began to see possibilities
in the journal, and all through the winter he reshaped and wrote
again many of its passages in the light of recent events and
greater maturity of vision.</p>

<p><i>"Non, ch&eacute;rie."</i> Henriette would lift a warning
finger as small Clara started for the forbidden study door. "Uncle
is busy writing. We must not disturb his pen."</p>

<p>Clara's visit had lengthened from week to week. First there had
been difficulties in settling the farm-house in Southwick, and then
one or another of the children had been ill. Matthew had many
business schemes afoot which took him often to 'Springfield, to New
Haven, Boston and New York. He often stopped on these trips, and
upon each visit Henriette feared he would announce that the time
had come for the child to return. But when he left her with them
she would draw a long breath as if she had been granted a reprieve.
She tried not to become too possessive in her growing love for this
third member of their household. Clara, she reminded herself a
dozen times a day, had been lent to them for a little while; that
was all they might expect. She talked to her daily of her father
and mother, of her sister and brothers. "Aunt" was as near as she
would let herself come to "Mother." Yet when she dressed and
undressed that round, small body, when she watched the widening
eyes and heard new words uttered in the surprising accents of
childhood, she felt renewed, Young life quickened the rooms again,
and while Cassie cut out gingerbread men and women in the kitchen
she fashioned miniature garments and cut down her old sealskin muff
to set off the sheen of copper hair and the warmth of
frost-brightened cheeks.</p>

<p>Clara, even at that tender age, had a character and mind of her
own. Not only did she bear a marked family resemblance in features
and colouring, but the traits of determination, independence, and
impetuous affection were already noticeable. No child could have
differed more from the young Praslin than she in gifts and
temperament. With the ease of early childhood she understood
whatever Henriette might say to her in French. But when she
answered it was always with a firm New England accent, that sounded
more like Cassie Sampson's each day. Even Henry smiled to hear her
and remarked on the family likeness. She was all Field, he told
Henriette with pride in his discovery.</p>

<p>"Yes," Henriette admitted, "and she has the spirit that goes
with her hair. She had need of it yesterday when the children next
door set her on their sled and she went down that steep hill alone.
She will not repeat the little French noel I am trying to teach her
for Christmas; but she was so devoted and quiet yesterday when my
head ached, and she runs with open arms to all who come to the
door, even the tin pedlar with his ferocious black beard."</p>

<p>Christmas had never been so beautiful as that year with pine
boughs sending their spice out into the warm rooms, with red
berries from the woods and bare feet hurrying from bed in the early
hours of morning. There was a chair of the exact size to fit a
three-year-old waiting by the fire, and in it a wonderful rag doll
with the most lifelike of painted faces. Henriette had executed it
with all her best skill and oil paints, and Clara's delight when
she saw it was reward enough.</p>

<p>It was late January when Matthew stopped unexpectedly one
evening to break a journey from New York. The cold was intense, and
he had been delayed by snowdrifts before he reached their door. He
was tired as he stretched his big boots to the study fire and drank
the coffee Henriette poured. But his tawny hair vibrated with inner
energy; his eyes had a peculiar light, and his whole presence
charged the room with a sense of excitement.</p>

<p>"Matthew has another invention on his mind," Henry had warned
his wife after they had welcomed him. "I know all the signs."</p>

<p>Certainly he was full of something of tremendous importance. He
could not keep it suppressed for long, and presently he had
launched into his subject.</p>

<p>"I met Gisborne in New York," he began. "Pure chance that we ran
into each other in front of the Astor House, and a lucky thing for
us both."</p>

<p>"Gisborne?" Henry questioned vaguely.</p>

<p>"Yes. An Englishman and an inventor. I suppose you wouldn't know
about him, but he's accomplished a lot in his line. He knows
electricity and more about the telegraph than any one except Morse
himself. He'd come down from Newfoundland where he's been working
on new telegraph lines. Well, we got to talking, and that's how the
scheme hatched. I tell you it's going to revolutionise the whole
world if it works, and I don't see why it shouldn't. Funny thing
is, I'd sort of been playing with the notion myself lately; so it
didn't take long for us to put our heads together."</p>

<p>Henry leaned forward in his chair, and his coffee grew cold as
he listened. Henriette laid aside her cup, but she made no move to
take up her basket of sewing. Matthew's voice rose and fell in the
quiet room, and each word seemed winged with a conviction that held
them spellbound. The whole village might have been burning up
beyond the drawn curtains, and not one of the three would have been
aware of it.</p>

<p>Matthew was a practical man. Whatever else might be said of him,
that was certain. When he built bridges there was no guesswork
about them. Their spans were true, and they were built to last.
When he laid railroad lines they fulfilled all requirements. His
enthusiasm was great, but it had never run away with his common
sense before. Yet what could they think, what could they do except
gasp and look at each other incredulously when he was telling them
that if a telegraph could operate successfully on land there was no
reason it could not also be laid under the Atlantic Ocean?</p>

<p>"It's as simple as that," he was saying. "Morse had proved it by
land. We'll prove it by sea. If you don't believe me, ask Cyrus.
He's all steamed up about it."</p>

<p>And so he went on to explain. Gisborne had taken concessions to
extend telegraph lines in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Part of
these must be laid under water with the wires protected by
waterproof cables. The work was well under way, but he had had to
stop when his funds gave out. That was why he had been in New York
trying to raise more. Matthew had been convinced that it would be a
sound investment and had immediately thought of Cyrus. Cyrus had
sold out his paper business at a large profit and had plenty to
invest. He was spoiling for some new enterprise to undertake. So,
he and Gisborne had gone to Cyrus's new house in Gramercy Park and
talked for hours. At first Cyrus' had been indifferent to the idea.
He was after all a business man and a capitalist, not given to
science and inventions. No, he had not been much impressed by the
Newfoundland telegraph project. It was later on that the real
possibilities of the idea had taken hold of him. Why stop with a
short cable line between some northerly islands? Why not an
Atlantic cable between Europe and America?</p>

<p>"Yes," Matthew went on, his voice full of pride and generosity,
"I've got to give all the credit to Cyrus, for Gisborne and I
weren't seeing much beyond our own noses&mdash;neither of us could
afford to," he added with an apologetic smile.</p>

<p>"But, Matthew," Henry put in mildly, "even if the theory is
sound, how could it ever be put into practice? Surely Samuel Morse
has carried the telegraph as far as it can go."</p>

<p>"Not by a long shot, he hasn't. And Morse is all in favour of
this. He said years ago it could be done, but that's as far as any
one went. Well, you know Cyrus when the sparks begin to fly!"</p>

<p>"I thought I knew Cyrus, but this&mdash;this wildcat scheme
hardly sounds like the hard-headed business man of our family."</p>

<p>"You wait till you hear him. Cyrus has got to do things in a big
way or not at all. Nothing picayune about him. I wasn't too hopeful
when we left the house round midnight; still, I figured I'd hang
around New York another couple of days just in case anything
happened."</p>

<p>The logs in the Franklin stove had burned down to a handful of
dwindling embers. The room had grown so chill that Henriette
shivered suddenly and pointed to the woodbox. Matthew paused long
enough to replenish the fire before he continued.</p>

<p>"I was right. Cyrus was on my trail first thing the next
morning. Seems he sat there in his library after we'd gone, turning
that big globe of his round and round when the notion took him, all
in a minute. He walked the floor, he said, all alone in the middle
of the night, knowing a telegraph line was going to be laid between
two worlds and he was going to put it through."</p>

<p>But even Matthew had been astounded by his brother's response.
He had not guessed that any one could start a ball rolling so fast.
Before another day passed Matthew and Gisborne were putting all
their engineering experience at his disposal. He had begun
immediate negotiations for scientific advice from Morse himself,
the Secretary of the Navy and Lieutenant Maury of the National
Observatory. They had responded at once and favourably. It all came
down to the problem of financial backing, but already Cyrus was
talking in sums that paralyzed the rest of them. David Dudley had
been called in as legal adviser. There must be no chance of
possible claims and lawsuits later on when a company was
formed.</p>

<p>Henry gasped and shifted in his chair.</p>

<p>"David, too," he murmured, "and Cyrus talking in figures. That
means business. But, Matthew, it's beyond my power to believe in
such a colossal possibility. Two hemispheres joined by a coil of
wire thousands of miles long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what it is&mdash;colossal." Matthew caught eagerly at
the word. He usually bowed to Henry in matters of vocabulary. "And
that's only the half of what it's going to mean. Think of it, in an
hour we'll know what's just happened over there in London and
Paris!"</p>

<p>"I cannot think." Henriette spoke for the first time. "It is
wonderful and it is also terrible."</p>

<p>Matthew's voice grew deeper and more jubilant. "I tell you it's
going to revolutionise the world! No more waiting for news that's
dead and done with by the time we get it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but bad news also travels fast."</p>

<p>The brothers both laughed at her dismay.</p>

<p>"That's like a woman," Matthew reproved her. "Cyrus's wife made
almost the same remark when she heard about it, and I'll miss my
guess if Clarissa won't, too, when I tell her. Can't you see any
farther than your own front yards, you women?"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is not that. I am not against this great invention," she
tried to explain. "Only it frightens me when I think of all it can
mean."</p>

<p>She felt her cheeks flush, and she could not go on to tell them
what was in her mind. She realised that she had left the two men in
the quiet parsonage study and had gone back across the years to
Paris and the voices of news vendors, crying murder and her name.
In an hour's time, Matthew had said, such things would he known
round the world. Well, that was over. What had she now to fear of
this live coil that would carry the pulse beats of the universe
under restless salty miles?</p>

<p>With a smile she rose and turned to them both.</p>

<p>"We do not serve strong drink, as you know," she said to her
brother-in-law, "but this is no ordinary night, and we must
commemorate it. Do you think, my little Henri, that we might drink
to the future of this deep-sea monster in some of Cassie's cherry
syrup?"</p>

<p>They were still engrossed in talk when she returned from the
pantry with three small glasses and seed cookies.</p>

<p>"About how big will it be?" Henry was questioning.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe the size of my fist, maybe smaller. There will be
many interwoven strands of wire in the cable."</p>

<p>Henry made a faint, incredulous sound in his throat and stared
at his own fist as he closed it.</p>

<p>"We must drink our toast standing," Henriette decided. "It would
not be fitting to remain seated when we propose the success of so
great and perilous an enterprise."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking the right way, Henriette!" Matthew beamed at
her as he got to his feet. "I'll leave the toast to Henry. Words
are his line."</p>

<p>They lifted their three glasses, and the home-made cherry bounce
showed ruby-red in the lamplight. Henry's face was very serious as
he wrinkled his forehead in thought.</p>

<p>"We cannot call it a telegraph," he said. "What name is it to go
by?"</p>

<p>Matthew shook his head.</p>

<p>"I guess Cyrus hasn't got that far yet," he admitted. "Call it
whatever you want to, Henry, but be sure you get in the Atlantic
Ocean."</p>

<p>"And it is this 'cable' that you say will carry it," Henriette
added.</p>

<p>"Well, then"&mdash;Henry's face has grown uplifted&mdash;"to the
Atlantic cable."</p>

<p>The little glasses clinked, and it seemed to Henriette standing
between the two that the air quickened and hummed about them in
some prophetic way.</p>

<p>"We shall remember to-night always," she told them gravely. "It
is somehow a most solemn occasion."</p>

<p>Midnight was striking as they climbed the stairs. They tiptoed
across the landing, that the little girl who slept might not be
wakened.</p>

<p>"Matthew will have a part in this new project," Henry confided
to her when they were alone in their room. "When the plans are made
and the company organised his engineering skill will be needed. He
tells me he thinks Cyrus will send him to work at the Newfoundland
end."</p>

<p>She caught a note of wistfulness in his voice. It was as near as
Henry would ever come to expressing envy. Swiftly she went to
him.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Henri," she commanded. "No, do not try to hide your
feelings. I can read your thoughts too well. You wish to have a
part in this even as your brothers. Why should you not wish
it?".</p>

<p>He smiled in sheepish apology.</p>

<p>"I must remember that I am a man of words, not of actions. But
to-night as I listened to Matthew I could have wished it might be
otherwise."</p>

<p>"You will have your own part in it," she told him with
conviction. "I am certain it must be so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but after all this is still a dream of theirs, not yet
under the ocean."</p>

<p>"Yes, but when such a thing takes possession of men's minds, of
a man of such indomitable will as your brother Cyrus, it already
exists by the very power of his belief. It may take years, but I
feel that we shall live to see it, you and I."</p>

<p>"Yet you seemed against it at first," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"Not against the invention," she told him. "But it came over me
suddenly how different my life might be now if this living wire,
this Atlantic cable, had brought you news of that tragedy in the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; before you had set out upon your
travels. I could not help thinking that if you had known you might
not have come&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew her close as she broke off.</p>

<p>"My dear!" His lips were warm with reassurance against hers.
"Don't you know that I should have come to you all the sooner?"</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Six</h3>

<p>Change stirred in the air all through that spring of 1854.
Pussy-willows and skunk cabbage had hardly showed in the woods
behind West Springfield before Henry celebrated his thirty-second
birthday. In honour of this he and Henriette paid a week's visit to
New York, her first in many months. They stayed with David Dudley,
whose large new house adjoined the one Cyrus had taken on the
north-east side of Gramercy Park. A door had been cut between the
two homes, and the brothers and their families moved intimately
from one to the other. There was much activity and the talk was all
of the absorbing new enterprise; which had progressed far since the
night Matthew had talked of it. Peter Cooper, another Gramercy Park
neighbour, had been won over by Cyrus's eloquence. He was not only
one of the richest men in the country, but New York's most
important citizen philanthropist. With his support and that of
other prosperous friends&mdash;Moses Taylor, Marshall O. Roberts
and Chandler White&mdash;and with the aid of David's legal
knowledge and the scientific co-operation of others, Cyrus was
beginning to organise his own deep-sea telegraph company and
preparing to sail for the bleak coast of Newfoundland as soon as
the weather would permit. He was impatient to see for himself how
the land lay at this northerly base and how far the telegraph line
there had been extended.</p>

<p>By the time Henriette and Henry returned to the Connecticut
Valley they had acquired an amazing fund of information on the
subject. But their days in New York were important in other more
personal respects. Henry visited the editors of several
publications to which he had been a contributor. Among these was
the <i>Evangelist,</i> a religious weekly that had published some
of his articles. The paper had been growing steadily in quality and
influence and was beginning to be read widely. A new editor was
needed, a man of Presbyterian background, literary ability, and
liberal outlook. Henry's age and tastes, his experience and
broad-minded views were ideal, and the editorship was offered him.
He had all qualifications but one. It would be necessary for him to
buy a controlling interest in the paper.</p>

<p>He had smiled regretfully as he told Henriette about the offer.
If only he had the means to take over such a post! But, of course,
he must not consider the possibility. It would take more funds than
they could muster to meet such financial output, and the salary
would be small till the paper had justified its new policy and
enlargement. New York was an expensive place to live in compared to
a small New England village. No, Henry did not feel he could
accept. Yet he was loath to refuse. Such a chance might never come
his way again, and it was so exactly the work that he longed to
do.</p>

<p>"But certainly you will accept!" Henriette had flung out her
arms in one of her unguarded Gallic gestures. "You did not refuse
it? <i>Bien,</i> it is a gift from heaven. No, do not keep
murmuring these foolish <i>buts!</i> When do they wish to make the
change? At once?"</p>

<p>Impractical though he was by nature, Henry had all the details
at hand. The present editorial policy and staff would continue
through the summer. He need not begin duties till September. That
would allow time for his resignation from the West Springfield
church, and for the parish there to find a successor. He could
contribute articles and editorials by mail before he assumed full
responsibility. That part of it was not difficult; but the
money&mdash;how could that ever be managed?</p>

<p>But Henriette had no uncertainty. There were times to take
risks; times to borrow money if the cause justified it. She knew
that he stood at a significant parting of the ways. She saw more
clearly than he that all his success and happiness in life would be
determined by the decision.</p>

<p>"Henri," she told him with a decisiveness that swept away all
objections, "you will take this post. It is right, and you will
make a good editor because your heart is in it. I have known for a
long time that you needed a larger scope. We have no children of
our own. It is not in our power, it seems, to change that. But this
we can do. Have no fears. Be happy in this opportunity that has
come because you are so well fitted to take it, and leave the rest
to me."</p>

<p>The Sunday following, Henry read his resignation from the pulpit
of the old white church. Before he began, he gave one swift glance
towards the pew where his wife sat. Her eyes reassured him as he
made the announcement that would bring such a change into their
lives.</p>

<p>"This decision has not been entered into hastily," he was
telling his surprised listeners. "I am not severing the ties that
bind me to you, to this church or others where it has been my
privilege to interpret God's word according to the faith that has
been mine and my father's before me. I seek a larger congregation,
not a better or a more devoted one than this which I have served
for nearly three years. It is not as if I were leaving to enter a
different field. My service will only, I trust, be further
enlarged, and my pen reach beyond the range of my voice."</p>

<p>Henriette felt the sincerity behind his words. She was moved
with greater love, greater pride in him, as she listened. Later,
standing at his side on the church steps, she was touched by the
expressions of regret that came from various members of the
congregation before they scattered to their homes in the early
spring sunshine. Some she knew had been critical of him, and
perhaps justly so. Although he was above reproach in matters of
principle, and although he had tried to deal justly and wisely in
all problems concerning this church, she knew that he had sometimes
made mistakes in judgment. He as well as she had offended some
members. His duties had often been irksome, and perhaps she had not
helped him to meet these parish controversies as might a wife who
had come from such a small community. But this chapter was nearly
ended. Henry had served these men and women honestly and well. They
were sorry to see him go.</p>

<p>In the months immediately following his resignation, Henriette
gathered all her resources to meet the challenge she had accepted.
Henry had double work to do, carrying on the church activities till
another minister had been chosen to fill his place and at the same
time writing his weekly articles for the <i>Evangelist.</i>
Henriette must meet alone the strain of their financial problems
and the transplanting to New York at the end of the summer. She
took minute account of their resources and found that with what
they had been able to put aside under her management and a loan,
based on personal integrity rather than tangible assets, the
necessary stock in the paper could be secured. Once this had been
done, she set about reducing their household expenses to the lowest
possible basis of operation. She drew up a long list of domestic
necessities and questioned Cassie for hours upon how the best
results might be achieved at the smallest expenditure. Cassie gave
valuable information on purchases and economies of all sorts. She
was only too eager to be helpful, but when the departure was
mentioned she invariably broke down at the thought of leaving those
three she had come to love with an almost fanatical devotion.</p>

<p>"It's bad enough with Clara gone to her folks for the summer,"
she would sigh over stove or sink. "I can't look a ginger cookie in
the face or go by the door of that little room without getting all
choked up; but when I think there'll be another minister and his
family in this house just 's we've got it all fixed so nice, and
you and the Parson off in the big city without me to look after
you&mdash;well, I could just sit right down and give up. I declare
it's on my conscience not to pack up and go too."</p>

<p>But Henriette had to discourage her generosity. Cassie Sampson
would, she knew, be as unhappy in New York as a duck set down in
the Sahara Desert. Even if this had not been so there was a married
sister in poor health who needed help frequently in her own large
family. Though she was tempted more than once to bring Cassie with
her for the settling at least, she resisted the impulse and was
firm.</p>

<p>"No, Cassie." She would shake her head and try to lighten the
woebegone face before her. "We must be sensible. Change comes to us
all, and I have been fortunate that you were sent to share these
years with me. I cannot think how I should have done without your
gifts and your advice to guide me. I hope I shall be a credit to
your teaching. You will find someone who needs you as much as I
did."</p>

<p>"I won't find no one like you and the Reverend." Cassie dug her
big knuckles into the bread dough she was kneading and turned her
face away with a suspicious sniff. "I guess I won't have the heart
to play that piece you taught me even if I do ever get another
piano to practise on."</p>

<p>"Oh, come! That is not fair to your teacher," Henriette reminded
her gently. "No, you must play it whenever you can and think how
happy we have been together. I believe that certain people are sent
to be our friends at times in our lives when we have most need of
them. I know it is true, Cassie, for there have been times when I
could not have gone on otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off and stood quite still for a moment staring through
the window past the thick-starred syringa bush where the bees
clustered and hummed. In that moment her mind left West Springfield
and turned back upon itself down a strange vista of years peopled
with figures grotesque in their variety. They passed before her
there&mdash;the tall Duc, handsome and graceful, with his children
about him; Albert and Marie Remey, gentle and affectionate, moving
hand in hand; Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod and his brother, coming
to her aid; Madame Le Maire, sharp-tongued and shrewd; old Pierre
in his faded blue porter's blouse; Miss Haines welcoming her to the
school on Gramercy Park; and Henri&mdash;ah, but Henri was a whole
procession of love and loyalty and understanding in one.</p>

<p>She returned once more to the kitchen's immediate present and
the admiring curiosity in Cassie's face.</p>

<p>"When you stand and look like that," she said, almost as if she
guessed what had passed in Henriette's mind, "I know you're kind of
figuring things out. Your being here, I mean, from such a long ways
off. You've been through plenty. I always knew that. But first time
I ever set eyes on you I said to myself, 'She's one that'll land
right side up.' Well, as I was saying yesterday, you'd better leave
me put up a lot of bread and butter pickles, and soon as the early
peaches come along we'd better lay in plenty. You'll need all the
jars of preserve fruit you can fetch with you to New York. They'll
help out come next winter."</p>

<p>Henriette had written of their plans to Miss Haines and had
received a prompt and encouraging reply. She was delighted at the
prospect of having her once more a neighbour. A French teacher had
already been engaged for next year; but pupils were always
requiring special lessons to keep up with the classes, and once the
school opened there might be a group of older girls who wished to
continue their French conversation and more advanced instruction in
literature and painting. She would use her influence to send them
to such an able teacher. Continuing with her practical advice, Miss
Haines further suggested that she had lately received inquiries
from out-of-town parents who wished to send their daughters to the
school if they might be cared for in some nearby home. The school
had no facilities for admitting more boarding pupils, but if
Henriette could find a house in the neighbourhood and felt like
taking these paying guests she would be well repaid.</p>

<p>"But, Henri, we must consider it," she had met his first
reluctance at the idea. "I, too, prefer that we need not share our
home; but it will only be for a year or two, and it will mean our
security and comfort. I confess I should dread older guests, but
you know I am used to the responsibility of young girls. It will
seem like old times to me, and I will let nothing interfere with
your work and with our life together."</p>

<p>It was not easy to find a house that answered the requirements
of proper location and small rent, but she discovered one after
days of discouragement. She had come to the city with Henry in the
last stifling heat of August, but he had returned to his church,
leaving her at David's home to continue the search. More and more
families were moving from the old streets below Washington Square
to this neighbourhood which had been almost rural a few years
before. The rows of houses had grown fast and were beginning to be
in demand. She could not afford one that fronted the little green
park, but she was determined to be within easy distance of it and
the school. There was nothing to distinguish those in a long block
on East Eighteenth Street from one another. All were brown and
narrow, built on the same pattern with basements and high stoops
and three stories, each containing three windows at front and back.
Only the numbers and an occasional variation in the matter of door
and shutter paint gave individuality, but once the landlord had
named a monthly rent within the range of possibility Henriette had
taken mental possession of number 102. There were certain
undeniable drawbacks. The stairs were steep, and the kitchen dark
and inconvenient. All the grates were rusty, and many broken. Such
sanitary conveniences as had been installed were badly out of
repair, and plaster on the upper floor gave mute evidence of a roof
that leaked. But there were long parlours with folding doors and
fireplace mantels of white marble that lent dignity even to the
empty rooms, and there was a small room that could serve as Henri's
study. She saw them all with fresh paint and plaster even before
she wrung a promise of these from the landlord.</p>

<blockquote>I shall remain to see that he keeps his word (she wrote
Henry that night after a jubilant account of her find). Once that
is done, I shall hasten back, and we can begin the great upheaval.
Miss Haines approves the situation and has written to a family in
Chicago who wish to place their daughter with her. Cyrus returned
to the city from one of his recent business trips in connection
with his project. He looks worn and shows the effects of his grief
in the loss of his little boy. His earlier elation has, I notice,
settled into a dogged determination. He read me Matthew's most
recent accounts of his labours with the telegraph lines at the
Newfoundland base, and it appears that a more bleak and difficult
spot could not have been chosen. But there is no turning back. I
could not but think, as we sat in the library and Cyrus talked with
his hand upon the globe, that the same gleam of accomplishment must
have lighted the eyes of Columbus before he set out to prove that
the world was round!<br>
<br>
The heat is still oppressive, but I bear it better now that a roof
has been found to shelter us for the winter. May it prove tight is
my fervent prayer as I argue with the owner and go about armed with
yardstick and pencil.<br>
<br>
Yesterday in a shop window on Fourteenth Street I paused to look at
an engraving of the Empress Eug&eacute;nie. Her elegance and beauty
are undeniable, and she carries herself with proud assurance of her
own worth. They make a strange pair, this royal couple. One cannot
but wonder how the Second Empire will fare under the rule of this
branch of the Corsican peasant tree and his Anglo-Spanish bride. In
the same shop I secured a copy of Victor Hugo's remarkable pamphlet
"Napoleon le Petit" which I am eager to discuss with you.<br>
<br>
The papers here commented at considerable length upon your friend
Beecher's sermon in Brooklyn last Sunday. He delivered another
stirring appeal to keep the territory of Kansas free of Slavery. I
wish we might have heard him. You have done well to win his promise
of a series of articles for the <i>Evangelist.</i> Perhaps it will
even be possible for you to secure others by his sister Mrs. Stowe.
What a feather that would be in your editorial cap!<br>
<br>
Good-night, my little Henri. Continue to miss me as I miss you, but
let your mind be at rest about the winter. We shall be busy and
happy in our new home, and may the door that will soon bear your
name upon its plate be open to men and women of wide vision and
inquiring minds.&mdash;Your most loving H. D. F.</blockquote>

<p>Those words hurriedly penned on a sultry late summer night were
more in the nature of a prophecy than a wish. That narrow
brownstone house on East Eighteenth Street became almost at once
the accepted gathering-place of a variety of friends and visitors
to New York. It was not chance that the phrase "inquiring minds"
had been set down by her pen. She cared little for other traits in
those she met. Integrity of thought, flexibility of mind, and a
consuming curiosity concerning the world and its occupants were the
touchstones to her friendship. Whether she happened to find these
in some struggling gifted youth or in some person of recognised
achievement, her response was equally sincere. The sensitive
antennae of her own sympathy and human awareness reached out in a
room full of people and unerringly found minds to quicken hers,
talents to match her own. She loved wit, but not at the expense of
wisdom. She delighted in good company and the exchange of talk, yet
she was seldom deceived by mere superficial brilliance.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she might agree if Henry or another tried to draw her
out upon some rather too voluble person. "He has been so busy
collecting the best opinions that he seems not to have found time
to have any of his own."</p>

<p>The years of discipline had tempered her impatience at duller
minds and less quick wits. Her own misfortunes had taught her
tolerance, had brought her a deeper sense of human values than it
was given to most women of that time and place to know. Facing
scandal, ruin and hostility as she had done had intensified her
natural independence. She was too dominant to be capable of
compromise once her convictions were established. But her husband's
love and the generosity and largeness of his views had made her
gentler, more indulgent of others.</p>

<p>"This is my belief," she would wind up some devastating comment
upon a subject under discussion, "but Henri says I do not paint the
picture in fairness. He thinks that I mix my colours with
prejudice, and it may well be so."</p>

<p>"But you still believe you are right, my dear," Henry would
smile with indulgent pride across the long table about which more
and more guests gathered.</p>

<p>Entertaining as a means of social advancement meant nothing to
either of them. "Society" was a word that made them smile and shake
their heads. They had nothing in common with the lavish receptions
and dinners of that select circle of wealthy and aristocratic
matrons who fancied themselves New York's social mentors.
Sympathetic as Henriette might be with human inconsistencies and
shortcomings, she could never hide the deep-rooted scorn she felt
for those who considered themselves superior because of wealth or
position.</p>

<p>No, Henry and she had come to that house on the edge of a good
neighbourhood without social ambitions and with no thought of
formal entertainment. That he should give his best to the new work,
that the paper should expand and prosper under his editorship, and
that they should keep their heads above water financially was all
that occurred to them in those first years. Under Henriette's touch
the house took on personality. Its inconveniences remained, but its
comforts and charm increased. Those who came there remembered the
easy intimacy of chairs drawn close to the fireplace, the vases of
French porcelain, and the mirror above reflecting the red curtains,
the picture and books on the shelves. They forgot, if they noticed,
the worn places in the carpet, the unevenness of floor boards, and
the faded wallpaper.</p>

<p>Few who stayed for supper in that house remembered the steep,
dark stairs that led to the basement dining-room, where the table
with its fresh linen and fine silver and china was spread under a
softly shaded hanging lamp. They could usually recall the
conversation about that table, but they were seldom aware of the
plainness of the food some young Irish girl set down for their
hostess to serve. They usually began with a tureen of steaming
soup. After that a platter of cold meat might follow, or perhaps
fish with a French sauce that disguised humble cod or haddock.
Vegetables were invariably potatoes, onions, carrots, or winter
turnips, though there might be a special treat of preserved fruit
in small glass dishes or a plate of thin sugar-sprinkled cookies.
But there was always coffee, enough to fill cups again and again.
The fragrance came like a tantalising preface long before the pot
appeared.</p>

<p>"It should be so with coffee," Henriette would make simple
acknowledgment of the praise that was sure to follow its arrival.
"One should feel as one raises the cup the same expectation that
precedes the rising of the curtain at a play, or the cutting of the
first page of a new book."</p>

<p>No, she did not take her housekeeping duties as seriously as
other women of her acquaintance. She refused to waste half her time
considering meals and fretting over the ineptness of Irish
immigrant help. She learned to market in the smaller shops far to
the east where women with shawls and baskets haggled over the price
of eggs and sugar and butter. Two mornings a week she went with a
small boy from the next block to carry the baskets home. If she
managed on a little less than the sum laid aside for expenditure,
the balance went into the bank as a matter of course. She taught
the raw young immigrants fresh from landing what she had learned
from Cassie Sampson and her own limited domestic experience. She
explained the simplest principles of service and let the training
end there. She understood these girls and their homesickness, their
bewilderment at strange ways. She made allowance for mistakes, but
not for waste or disobedience. They came and they went after the
order of their kind&mdash;good-natured and willing for the most
part, but eager to marry of move on to higher wages in more
prosperous households.</p>

<p>It amused Henriette in those first years when she must practise
such strict economy; when without the French lessons she gave
privately or the boarding pupil who occupied their most comfortable
bedroom&mdash;it amused her to hear other women rattle on for hours
about their domestic difficulties. They took such problems so
seriously, as if it mattered in the scheme of creation whether one
served boiled fish with an egg sauce or drawn butter. She felt like
reminding them that the sun had risen as usual and the stars
remained in their courses even if yesterday's pudding sank in the
middle or Sunday's roast had been tough. When her sisters-in-law or
some inquisitive friend expressed surprise at the number of
distinguished guests she and Henry entertained, she would smile and
shrug.</p>

<p>"But they do not come for what is put upon their plates," she
would point out in all honesty. "Do you think that Mr. Bryant's
mind is upon the beef stew when he and Henri are quoting the Greek
of Homer to one another?"</p>

<p>These other housewives could not understand her casualness, but
the fact remained that more and more important men and women came
to that house off Gramercy Park. Now that Sunday had changed from
being Henry's most arduous to his most restful day, he had fallen
into the habit of asking friends and visitors to the city to drop
in towards the end of the afternoon. He was the most hospitable man
alive, and it was inevitable that they should be invited to remain
for a light supper. As the months passed and their circle of
friends widened, these impromptu Sunday evenings became something
to be reckoned with even by so informal a hostess. She did not
overlook the importance of food; she knew that good conversation
flourished about a dining-room table. Her problem was to provide
the essentials of hospitality for the least possible outlay of
money and effort. Once again she fell back on Cassie Sampson's
advice about keeping a ham on hand. By practising strict economy
during the week she was able to afford generous platters of cold
sliced ham when Sunday came round. Potato salad had not yet become
generally popular in New York; but in France its value was known,
and it could be stretched to meet the emergencies of unexpected
guests or late arrivals. Pans of biscuits could be heated on short
notice. Relays of fresh coffee appeared and disappeared. By giving
the maid of all work the unheard-of luxury of a whole week-day to
herself, Henriette was able to enlist full support on Sundays, and
she was lenient in allowing dishes to be stacked and washed the
following morning.</p>

<p>She never knew beforehand how many would gather. It might be a
night of rain or sleet or snow with only a half-dozen about the
lamplit table, or it might be that the brass knocker kept up a
steady rapping and those who had already finished supper rose and
gave their places to newcomers, lingering nearby to continue the
topic in which they had become engrossed. Sometimes they sat on
about that table for hours while controversies raged, or they all
stayed spellbound as some guest warmed to a subject and poured out
his best to sympathetic listeners. Henriette was wise enough not to
disturb a group that had fallen into congenial conversation, not to
break the frail thread of mental intercourse. She had no patience
with hostesses who felt called upon to rearrange their guests
during the course of an evening.</p>

<p>"It is most barbarous," she would protest vigorously, "this
custom of shuffling and dealing out one's visitors as if they were
so many cards in a pack. If I desired to play whist I should
certainly not do so with my guests."</p>

<p>Henry agreed; he loved people. Human beings renewed him in some
deep inner way that only Henriette understood. He demanded less of
people than she, was less discriminating in his appraisals. Not for
nothing had his family smiled at his enthusiasms and reminded one
another that "All Henry's geese are swans." But somehow with
experience and his wife's shrewder judgment he made fewer mistakes
in human equations, and his writing expanded and took on new ease
and sureness under the stimulation of these contacts with the most
intelligent minds of his day.</p>

<p>With her it was different. She was always a gracious welcoming
hostess; always an attentive listener; but unconsciously she was
also the centre of their domestic stage. She had been born with an
oversupply of creative energy, and it found its best outlet in her
genius for friendship. In a group of people her mind took on an
uncanny power, like the hazelwood divining rod that in certain
hands will tug and turn at the presence of water. In the same
instinctive way she was always seeking thirstily the hidden springs
of other human minds and hearts. Consciously or unconsciously they
all responded to her: Peter Cooper, the eccentric millionaire, from
his great house across Gramercy Park; William Cullen Bryant, poet,
philosopher and editor; Samuel Morse, artist-inventor; the
Beechers, brilliant preacher and famous sister; Bowles and Holland
and Gilder; Fiske, the historian; Youmans, the scientist; Bayard
Taylor; Edmund Clarence Stedman; Eastman Johnson, the painter.</p>

<p>So they flocked to the house oft East Eighteenth Street or to
others that succeeded it. Wherever she and Henry might move in
those years before and during and immediately after the Civil War,
the door knocker would begin to be active; chairs would be drawn to
the fireplace; plates and cups would be set out in readiness on the
dining-room table, and the fragrance of fresh coffee would begin to
climb the stairs. Some of the men and women whose feet passed over
that threshold had a part in the shaping of events, political,
scientific, literary and artistic; some of them lived and died in
obscurity. But years after, when they were scattered and that house
was only a memory, it still served its purpose of friendly
introduction.</p>

<p>"Didn't we meet one Sunday evening at the Henry Fields'?"</p>

<p>It was like a password, one that would have warmed Henriette's
heart as she had warmed theirs.</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Seven</h3>

<p>Rachel had landed in New York! Under the brass blare of P. T.
Barnum's superlatives she would make her d&eacute;but in
Corneille's tragedy <i>Les Horaces</i> at several New York theatres
that autumn of 1855.</p>

<p>Henriette read the announcements heralding this forthcoming
event with feelings that she could not share, not even with Henry.
No, she could not explain to him why she had stood in the
relentless glare of noon sun on busy Fourteenth Street devouring
each word of the theatrical handbills displayed before the new
Academy of Music entrance. The familiar French names stirred her
mind as if they had been so many pebbles flung into the still
depths of her consciousness to spread out in disturbing ripples. In
a few weeks Rachel would be playing here, too, at this theatre only
a half-dozen city blocks from her own door.</p>

<p>How long it was since the night she had sat with the Duc and
Louise in that luxurious box! How little had they guessed,
listening to the magic of that voice, watching the play of feeling
that illumined those features like flashes of summer
lightning&mdash;how little they had guessed the tragedy that would
descend upon them, too! Fourteen years since then, yet even now
Rachel's name on a cheaply-printed playbill could set Henriette's
heart pounding with echoes of lost emotions.</p>

<p>She turned from the announcement at last. But before she moved
on, her eyes began searching curiously for the door which admitted
players to the theatre. "Stage Entrance"&mdash;she read the
inconspicuous sign and peered through a grating set in a door that
gave upon a dark alleyway. The contrast of those two entrances
struck her poignantly as she turned away. Perhaps it was symbolic,
she thought, that those whose destiny it was to kindle fire in
others must grope their way first through such narrow tunnels as
this. But Rachel must be used to dark stage doors by this time. She
wished her well in this venture.</p>

<p>This Yankee, Barnum, was a genius in the art of showmanship.
There had never been his like for exploitation, whether he made the
diminutive General Tom Thumb a national character overnight or
roused the American public to such heights of frenzy over Jenny
Lind that they cheerfully fought their way to hear the Swedish
Nightingale warble at ten, twenty and even thirty dollars a ticket.
P. T. Barnum for all his shrewdness was capable of mistakes.
General Tom Thumb had been a droll freak of nature, a human being
cast in miniature to be marvelled at in frank curiosity. A voice
like Jenny Lind's soared to the farthest gallery seat unhampered by
barriers of language. But Rachel's art was far less simple and
direct in its appeal. It required a response. And how could there
be answering emotion when only a fifth of those beyond the
footlights found the words intelligible? In vain the great actress
summoned her best gifts for this public she had travelled so far to
conquer. She called upon every ounce of her strength, every
dramatic mood within her range. The brilliant passages of Racine
and Corneille fell like pearls cast before&mdash;not the proverbial
swine, but bewildered and dwindling audiences. A meagre group of
theatrical enthusiasts hailed her greatness, it was true, and the
papers praised her power as a tragedienne. Henriette took some
small satisfaction in this, though she felt humiliation at New
York's indifference and at Mr. Barnum's crude methods. His
announcements that Rachel would be loaded down with jewels valued
at some two hundred and forty thousand dollars and presented to her
by many different admirers, was certainly in the worst possible
taste. Yet she read eagerly any and all comments upon the actress
and her troupe. She sprang to her defence at the first hint of
criticism.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say, Mrs. Field, I couldn't see anything to brag
about in her," some casual acquaintance would volunteer. "If they
like her so much in France I don't see why she didn't stay over
there. Fanny Kemble may have been a Britisher, but at least you
could understand what she was saying."</p>

<p>"An actress is hardly responsible for the minds of her public,"
Henriette would point out with spirit. "It is their misfortune if
her art is lost upon them. I suppose to a deaf-mute Jenny Lind must
have seemed no more than a blonde woman beside a piano opening and
closing her rather large mouth."</p>

<p>So through that month of September Henriette fought off the
impulse to see Rachel act again. It was not that Henry would have
disapproved. Unlike many of his profession, he had no prejudice
against the theatre. He would have taken her gladly if she had
expressed a wish to see her great compatriot. But she could not
bring herself to mention it to him, though as the days passed the
longing to hear her own language in those unforgotten accents
became an obsession.</p>

<p>She might, perhaps, have continued to control it if the
engagement of the French troupe had not begun at the nearby Academy
of Music the same week that Henry left for a short trip to New
England. His mother's health had been poor of late, and he wished
to see her and attend to certain commissions connected with the
paper. He was eager to go to Concord and meet Ralph Waldo Emerson,
who was at work upon a new series of essays, <i>The Conduct of
Life.</i> On the way back he would stop in Southwick and visit
Matthew's family. Clara had spent the summer there with her mother
and brothers and sister, but she would return to New York with
Henry for the winter. Without actually planning that the
arrangement should be permanent, the child had grown more and more
at home with her uncle and aunt. The months she spent with her
family circle were more in the nature of long visits, and it could
not be denied by the generous Matthew and his wife that the child
benefited by advantages they could not give her.</p>

<p>"Be sure you do not mislay Clara's belongings on the way back,"
Henriette cautioned Henry as he set off for the week of travel,
"and do not let the child out of your sight when you wait between
trains. Give your parents my affection, and Clarissa also. I hope
Matthew will soon be home from the North. I shall have time to
write you once, and perhaps you will send me word too, along the
way."</p>

<p>After he had gone she kept herself as busy as possible that her
thoughts might not stray too often in the direction of Fourteenth
Street. She called upon Miss Haines and discussed the requirements
of three pupils who were behind in their French classes, and she
gave her first evening to helping their young school boarder from
Chicago rearrange her room. Next day, having an unusual amount of
leisure on her hands, she began a water-colour sketch which had
long been haunting her. It was to be a study of an emigrant girl
with her few possessions waiting for entrance to America. Although
she had no intention of making it a self-portrait, she could not
help visualising herself and her feelings in every line. Once she
would have been too close to the subject to snatch at the
essentials and transfer them to paper with her brushes. But now the
time had come to make that homesickness and hope tangible in the
slumped figure waiting as she had once waited with those souvenirs
of the old life about her and with the masts and prows of shipping
in the background.</p>

<p>"It is good," she said as light faded and she rose from her
easel. "I think I have caught the attitude and feeling. To-morrow I
can finish the final washes of colour."</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Cooper dropped in after supper to see Henry, but he
stayed to talk with Henriette for more than an hour. They spoke of
the cable project and of the latest difficulties which Cyrus must
meet. She had brought the unfinished sketch into the parlour to
study it by lamplight, and his eye fell upon it with interest. He
thought it good and said so after his own blunt, emphatic
fashion.</p>

<p>"No reason at all, my dear," he said, "why most of the
interesting work in the world should belong to the men. Not that I
hold with all this women's rights nonsense. If a woman's made the
way she should be she'll get her rights and more. But I'd like to
see boys and girls, too, with a talent have a chance to put it to
some good use."</p>

<p>She nodded and listened with intentness as the eccentric,
benevolent old millionaire warmed to his theories of youth and
labour. People admired him because of his wealth and vision in
industry, but they laughed at his peculiarities and independence of
thought and speech. He had seen the possibilities in the
development and manufacture of iron and made a fortune in it and in
glue. His own inventions ranged from locomotives and lawn-mowers to
a contrivance to rock a cradle, keep off flies and amuse the
occupant with music-box tunes. But Henriette never smiled behind
Peter Cooper's back at his extraordinary schemes. She found him a
most stimulating man, a most generous friend.</p>

<p>"I mean to found a school," he was telling her, "according to my
own potions, and it won't be all mixed up with the classics. Not
that there's anything wrong with them for men like your Henry and
others. But this one I have in mind will be for a different sort of
young man and young woman. It'll teach them to use their hands
along with their brains. How 'd you feel about helping me plan it
and maybe teach painting to girls that show any knack at it?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she had agreed. She would be most happy to help.
She believed there was a great need of such an institution in New
York. Where, certainly, were there so many young people growing up
in poverty and squalor with the gifts and traditions they had
brought from their native countries all being wasted and forgotten
in the struggle to live on this single overcrowded island of
Manhattan?</p>

<p>"Well, then, you promise to help me," he had said as he prepared
to walk home round Gramercy Park and see how the new trees he had
had set out there were flourishing. "I'm mulling it over in my mind
along with a few dozen other schemes."</p>

<p>But she did not take him too seriously. After he had gone she
went upstairs to bed, missing Henry and trying not to think of the
lighted doors of the Academy of Music and of that smaller entrance
from which a woman's cloaked figure would soon be stepping.</p>

<p>She kept well occupied till the third evening of that week, when
her resolutions not to give way to her desires suddenly left her.
Rachel was to play Ph&egrave;dre, her most famous r&ocirc;le.
Temptation was no longer to be resisted. Henriette hurried through
an early supper and helped the young pupil with next day's French.
Then, instructing the Irish maid to remain on duty before locking
the house at ten o'clock, she hurried upstairs. With careful, swift
fingers she made herself ready, putting on fresh linen and curling
her hair before the pier glass. At the wardrobe she surveyed her
dresses and weighed the advantages of her new plum-coloured poplin
and her made-over green taffeta with the black lace drapings. The
poplin was more fashionable in cut, but it was not
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>. She selected the taffeta, feeling
that the occasion demanded full evening dress.</p>

<p>"I must honour Rachel with a costume worthy of her art," she
decided as the shimmering folds rustled about her.</p>

<p>She felt grateful that her dark wrap was inconspicuous, and that
it could be fastened close to her chin. A scarf of black lace
covered her head, and she carried a small beaded bag as she closed
the front door behind her and set off alone upon this adventure.
Respectably married women did not walk alone after dark. She was
well aware that in doing so she was defying neighbourhood
conventions. Not that she felt any timidity, but she hoped to avoid
meeting those who might expect some explanation. Luck was with her,
and presently the bright lights of Fourteenth Street beckoned and
the Academy of Music loomed before her like some brilliantly
illumined cave.</p>

<p>Traffic was heavy on that thoroughfare. She had to wait some
moments before she could cross between the carriages clattering
eastwards towards the theatre. Men and women in evening dress were
alighting upon the crimson carpet that Mr. Barnum had had laid from
curb to entrance. Henriette took her place in line before the
ticket window, the only woman in that crowd of men and boys. Their
curious stares meant nothing to her as the line moved steadily
nearer the grille-protected opening behind which a man's fingers
exchanged bits of cardboard for silver and paper currency. She
relaxed somewhat, once her hand held a ticket and she could move on
into the lighted lobby. She paused to slip back her scarf and open
the fastenings of her wrap. As she did so her attention was drawn
to the ticket collector beside his little box and an excited old
man who gestured and protested in French.</p>

<p>The ticket taker refused to let him in because the one he held
entitled him to a gallery seat. He must go outside again and climb
the stairs that led from the street. The old fellow could not
understand him. He believed his ticket was not being honoured, and
his face was a puckered study in bewildered despair that reminded
her of old Pierre. Henriette turned on the attendant in reproof for
his shortness and then in swift French made the situation
clear.</p>

<p><i>"Merci, madame. Je vous remerci."</i>
</p>

<p>The old soul poured out a torrent of thanks and blessings, and
the familiar words fell refreshing as dew. She had been missing the
sound of her native tongue more than she had realised.</p>

<p>"Good-night and enjoy yourself, monsieur," she answered in
French as they parted. "The great Rachel will at least be sure of
two across the footlights to understand her words."</p>

<p>The incident put her in an even more expectant frame of mind,
though she wished she might have afforded to buy another orchestra
seat for the old man. Her own was a little to the side, though no
pillar interfered with her view of the stage. The gilded boxes were
not all filled, and a few rows at the back were empty; but it was a
better house than she had expected from reports of former receipts.
And it was apparently a well-mannered, well-fed and well-dressed
audience. It pleased Henriette to see so many men in formal black
and white, so many women in silk of various hues with their bare
necks and arms gleaming under the brilliance of gas-light. It
pleased her to hear the rising chatter of voices all about her.
Vendors of English versions of the play moved up and down the
aisles, doing a thriving business with their sales. Every one, it
seemed, but herself was preparing to follow the play by means of
these texts. An elderly man at her right was studying one as if his
life depended on it, and the young girl in blue satin with the
heavy-scented bouquet of tube-roses who sat on her left kept
fluttering the pages between bursts of conversation.</p>

<p>"Mamma was very set against my coming," a shrill girl's voice
was proclaiming behind her. "You know what she thinks of actresses,
and she was shocked when she read about Rachel having so many
admirers and dear knows what beside!"</p>

<p>"Ssh, don't mention it so loud, or Cousin May will make us leave
before the first act. I only teased her into taking us because I
said it would improve our French. O, look, the Vandercamps are just
coming into that second box. I wonder if Ellen really is engaged to
Will Leonard. He's sitting next to her and they look sort
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>To Henriette's relief the orchestra cut short this conversation.
Violins were mounting, high and sweetly singing to the roof, with
'cellos and piano keeping the melody anchored to earth and the
orchestra pit. There, she recognised the tune! It was a polka, so
infectious, so much a part of the old life that Henriette could
scarcely breathe, remembering the grace of young girls in summer
dresses and a tall blond man dancing to it in a drawing-room by the
seashore.</p>

<p>Now the footlights grew bright, the curtains were parting on the
rather bare stage which had already drawn unfavourable comment from
New York's theatregoers. Henriette cared nothing for elaborately
painted scenery. She waited tensely for the first words to be
spoken that should transport her across time and space. When they
came even from the lips of those less important members of the
troupe she could have burst into tears at the perfection of accent,
at the beauty and rhythm of the dialogue. About her the audience
stirred restlessly, and at regular intervals the actors' voices
were drowned out by the rustle that rose from all parts of the
house at the simultaneous turning of some thousand pages. But she
forgot even this irritation as the play unfolded, as the moment for
Rachel's entrance approached.</p>

<p>At last she stood before them in the flowing Greek robes that
fell from her shoulders, the white folds accentuating her pallor
and the darkness of her eyes and hair.</p>

<p>"Ah, but she has aged!" That was Henriette's first reaction as
she applauded till her palms tingled. "We have not grown younger
with the years, Rachel and I!"</p>

<p>She saw that those features had sharpened subtly as if a cameo
cutter had been too diligent with his instruments. The eyes
appeared more brilliant because of the deep sockets that held them.
The exquisite oval of the face was a shade too angular, and under
the flattering draperies the frame was more gaunt than she
remembered. But that voice! Though Henriette was aware that the
tones were less resonant and full than they had once been, what
flexibility and power still charged it as the words flowed out with
the old magic!</p>

<p>Long before the curtain fell for the first intermission
Henriette had surrendered to the spell. She had been stirred before
by Rachel's art, but not as she was moved to-night sitting alone in
that alien audience on Fourteenth Street. She had been young and
untried then; now she was a woman of middle age and bitter
experience. The more one suffered and lived, the more one had known
of joy and grief, the deeper the response must be if an artist were
great enough to summon it. She leaned forward in the dimness,
scarcely daring to breathe lest she miss a single glance of those
eyes, a single syllable from those lips.</p>

<p>Rachel was giving out her best. But for one member of that
audience it was more than a magnificent theatrical performance. It
was for Henriette a renewal of her very self through the art of
another. Every gesture, every look, every inflection of that voice
brought back lost ecstasy and lost despair as if the actress had
known and evoked them. So the present slipped from Henriette,
forgotten like the lace scarf that had fallen from her bare
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Bravo, bravo!" she cried out as the curtain fell.</p>

<p>She was oblivious to the curious glances that her enthusiasm
drew from those about her. As the girl in blue satin rose to
promenade with her escort during the intermission, her bouquet fell
at Henriette's feet. In a daze she rescued it.</p>

<p>"You have dropped your violets, mademoiselle," she said.</p>

<p>It was only the astonished look on the girl's face that brought
her back to reality. She had spoken in French and called tube-roses
violets! Yet the memory of a little purple bunch that had lain
fragrant on her lap all those years ago had returned stronger than
the living flowers between her fingers. Could any actress ask a
greater triumph than this, she wondered?</p>

<p>So the evening continued until, as the play neared its climax,
Henriette was so completely under its spell that she would hardly
have responded if her own name had been shouted through the
theatre.</p>

<p>She trembled as Ph&egrave;dre poured out her anguish to
Hippolyte:</p>

<blockquote>Miserable! et je vis et je soutiens la vue<br>
De ce sacr&eacute; soleil dont je suis descendue...</blockquote>

<p>She was shaken to the core with answering emotion.</p>

<blockquote>Wretch that I am! I live and still must<br>
Endure the sight of the sacred sun.<br>
I have for ancestor the father of the God,<br>
Heaven and all the Universe is full of my ancestors.<br>
Where can I hide myself?</blockquote>

<p>When the final curtain fell tears were streaming down
Henriette's cheeks. But she did not pause to wipe them away. With
her hands lifted high she was responsible for at least two curtain
calls.</p>

<p>"Oh, to tell her that I heard and felt as no one in all this
city could have done!" she thought as she joined the audience that
crowded the aisles.</p>

<p>If Henry or any member of his family had been beside her she
would have curbed her impulse that followed this thought. But she
<i>was</i> alone. There was no one to remind her that she had been
rash enough to come here unaccompanied without seeking out an
actress of Rachel's reputation.</p>

<p>Somehow she found herself at the stage entrance, where several
men stated at her appraisingly.</p>

<p>"Who do you want, ma'am? What's your business here?" one of them
asked her bluntly.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mademoiselle Rachel," she announced in a voice
that surprised her by its calmness. "Here is my card, which you
will be good enough to present her if you will lend me your pencil,
monsieur."</p>

<p>He handed her out without further questions. There was something
in her manner that impressed him. Women of her type seldom appeared
at the back doors of theatres. This woman spoke with authority and
a French accent. It was against his orders, but he would let the
actress's brother deal with this visitor.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Henry M. Field," the calling card was neatly engraved; but
below this the hasty pencilling read: "N&eacute;e Henriette
Deluzy-Desportes."</p>

<p>Presently she was following the man down the dark alleyway. He
led her into the wings, where she was vaguely aware of dangling
ropes and properties that had a strange yet familiar look because
she had so recently seen them across the footlights. She stumbled
against an artificial orange tree and the bench upon which
Ph&egrave;dre had wept her tears of bitterness. A dark rather too
conspicuously dressed man received her. She disliked his scrutiny
and self-importance, but his French was excellent when he
introduced himself as Mademoiselle Rachel's brother and her
manager.</p>

<p>"A beautiful, a superb performance," Henriette hastened to
assure him "As a compatriot I could not resist the desire to offer
my praise."</p>

<p>"My sister will see you," he explained as he led her across the
darkened stage. "She is not at all well," he went on, "and far from
happy at her American reception."</p>

<p>"I know, Monsieur F&eacute;lix, and I regret it. That is why I
ventured to express my gratitude to-night as I should not have done
in Paris. But if she is too tired after so exacting a r&ocirc;le I
will not intrude upon her."</p>

<p>"No, no, she has expressed a wish to meet you."</p>

<p>He gave her a look of such obvious curiosity that she lowered
her eyes and waited without speaking while he knocked at a door. A
maid appeared behind it. The two spoke in low tones together before
they both stood aside to let Henriette enter alone.</p>

<p>Her first impression was of disorder. The small room seemed
overflowing with costumes and baskets of flowers whose fragrance
mingled with the scent of powder and pomades. Then she became aware
only of the woman who dominated it. Rachel lay on a divan wrapped
in a cloak of crimson wool. Under her make-up she looked utterly
spent and no flecks of light stirred in the sombre darkness of her
eyes. Seen at such close range, there was no disguising the worn
lines of that face, the hollows that showed too prominently at
cheeks and throat. But the full red lips curved into a smile as a
long transparent hand was extended in greeting.</p>

<p>"You are Mademoiselle Deluzy-Desportes?"</p>

<p>The question came almost in a whisper. Rachel was evidently
saving her voice from all possible strain.</p>

<p>"I was," Henriette answered simply.</p>

<p>She had not until that moment given a thought to what she should
say to the great actress. Now that their paths had crossed in this
cluttered dressing-room across the Atlantic, her composure for once
deserted her, though she continued to speak in the French that rose
so naturally to her lips.</p>

<p>"You have brought her back to life to-night," she was
explaining. "To-morrow she will be gone again. But it seemed only
right that she&mdash;that I&mdash;that we should thank you in
person."</p>

<p>"It is incredible," Rachel answered. "Of all strange meetings
this is surely the most strange. That we should both be here so far
from home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is my home now," Henriette reminded her. "I have been
fortunate to find happiness and peace in the New World. Here the
tragedy in which I was forced to play a part is forgotten."</p>

<p>"Ah, Madame!" Rachel gave her a long, intent look. "You also
have known tragedy. Drama has come to us both in different ways.
Compared to what you have lived, my r&ocirc;les must seem like the
charades of children."</p>

<p>Henriette acknowledged the common bond. "Drama has marked both
our lives. For me it took the form of a yoke; for you&mdash;wings."
Rachel sighed.</p>

<p>"This long journey was too far for those wings. I feel that they
are failing me."</p>

<p>She made a futile gesture and the cloak fell back. Under its
vivid folds Henriette could not help seeing how frail that body had
grown.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mademoiselle Rachel," she said. "I salute your
genius."</p>

<p>The interview was over. She sped along the dark alley and
deserted streets, a woman hurrying to the security of her own home.
For an evening only she had entered this world of artifice where
even the make-up was more pungent than the scent of living flowers.
She felt for the latchkey in her bag. As she climbed her doorsteps,
the present reclaimed her, and once more she shed the past.</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Eight</h3>

<p>Looking back to those years of 1855 to 1858, Henriette realised
how the Cable, or Atlantic Telegraph, as it was still called,
dominated their thoughts. Not only Cyrus, completely in the toils
of his electrical sea serpent; not only Matthew battling the
elements of the Newfoundland coast&mdash;not only these active
brothers, but scholarly Henry too was obsessed by this dream of
joining two worlds.</p>

<p>"It is perhaps fortunate," Henriette thought as those months of
suspense lengthened into years of grim effort, "that Henri and I
have not the means to invest in this enterprise, or we should long
ago have been ruined."</p>

<p>Cyrus, it began to be rumoured, was on the verge of bankruptcy.
All his business assets, real estate and personal properties were
pledged to the support of the company he headed. The original
capital of a million and a half dollars which the first little
group of backers had subscribed had been swallowed up almost
immediately&mdash;a mere drop in the bucket. Land extensions of the
line alone had cost more than a million, and of this Cyrus had
contributed over two hundred thousand. No wonder his wife looked
anxious as thousands followed thousands to meet new demands and one
unforeseen setback after another. There were times when Henriette
regretted her impulsive toast to the adventure.</p>

<p>But Henry remained steadfast in his belief. Cyrus could
accomplish the miracle. It was merely a question of time. He had
set himself the task of recording the progress of the undertaking
from start to finish. His part would be less spectacular, but when
the goal was accomplished he would have his history ready to give
to the world. Tirelessly he prepared notes on all that Cyrus and
Matthew told of their activities; patiently he copied and filed
away all letters and documents that might have future bearing upon
the work. Besides this, he had himself been an eye-witness to the
first experiment in cable laying between Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia. A party which included, besides Cyrus and Henry, Peter
Cooper, Samuel Morse and others concerned in the expedition had set
off by steamer from New York harbour. But the attempt seemed doomed
almost from the start. The captain of the steamer was not
experienced enough for such an undertaking. He grew stubborn and
seriously bungled the delicate operation of towing the bark which
was to pay out the miles of cable. Half-way across the Gulf of St.
Lawrence a violent gale had threatened to sink both ships. The
heavily loaded bark and the steamer that towed it were in such
danger that it had been necessary to cut the cable. Forty miles had
been laid, and nothing to show for the attempt but loss and
discouragement. The party had returned in a far less confident mood
than it had set out.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a bitter blow when the order was given to cut the
cable," Henry had admitted. "But perhaps the experience was needed,
since it proved to Cyrus beyond a doubt that sailing vessels are
unfitted for the work. He realises now that the cable must be paid
out from a steam-propelled one where speed and smoothness can be
regulated."</p>

<p>Yet even Henry's natural optimism had been somewhat shaken when
the Telegraph Company confronted the losses of this disastrous
experiment. It meant a year's delay at the least, for months would
be required to make a new cable, which could not be safely laid
until the following summer. New funds must be raised, and a cable
of more and heavier wire strands manufactured. Without hesitation
Cyrus set off for England to undertake these responsibilities.</p>

<p>Through most of the year 1856 he remained there, conferring with
British scientists and financial backers. Brett, who had laid the
first cable across the English Channel, and Bright, another pioneer
in ocean telegraphy, gave him their advice and support. But such
cables had been short, barely a hundred miles in length, and the
proposed line from Newfoundland to the coast of Ireland must be
reckoned in thousands. The general opinion in Great Britain, as in
the United States, was that Cyrus Field was an impractical
visionary. His scheme would never work, and those who were fools
enough to believe him deserved to lose their money at the bottom of
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>It was not comforting to hear what people thought of Cyrus in
those days. Henriette came almost to dread the mention of his name.
Not that she had lost faith in him or in the great undertaking; she
still believed in the driving force of his energy and in the
indomitable willpower that was strong enough to remove mountains.
But she dreaded the effect upon Henry of the doubting head-shakes,
the easy ridicule and biting criticism. These instantly roused
Henry to his brother's defence. For all his mildness and tolerance,
Henry had his share of the family spirit. He could cling as
tenaciously as Cyrus to the idea of the invention and its
practicability. He spent himself trying to convince sceptics till
Henriette feared that his writing and health might suffer from the
strain. The <i>Evangelist</i> had grown and prospered under his
editorship, and his weekly editorials had begun to be quoted and
watched for. He must keep his family loyalties and personal views
separate from his work, she had to remind him frequently when his
enthusiasms mounted. Often she must restrain him from penning a
sharp reply to some article that charged Cyrus with wasting
millions on what was obviously a fool's dream.</p>

<p>"Uncle Cyrus isn't crazy, is he?" the child Clara asked
anxiously as she returned from playing with a group of
neighbourhood children on the front steps.</p>

<p>"Most certainly not," Henriette hastened to reassure her. "What
put that into your head, <i>ch&eacute;rie?"</i></p>

<p>"They said so, just now. I told them 'No,' but Mary and Sam and
Lucy wouldn't believe me. They said they heard their father tell
their mother he was, because he'd got crazy notions in his
head."</p>

<p>"You must not listen to what they say, and you must never repeat
such things to Uncle because they make him very unhappy."</p>

<p>"I promise. But when I told them that my father was helping
Uncle Cyrus they all laughed and they tapped on their foreheads,
like this."</p>

<p>Her plump fingers gave an eloquent imitation.</p>

<p>"Think no more of it," Henriette told her. "Get your bonnet and
you can come with me to Third Avenue, where I am going to Mrs.
Pope's shop to buy more cinnamon and raisins and perhaps a bag of
peppermints, since you and Uncle enjoy them so much."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Bryant, too," Clara added as they set off. "He ate four
the last time."</p>

<p>"Ah, it is not polite to notice how much a guest eats,"
Henriette impressed upon the child. "And the last time Mr. Bryant
came you failed to make your curtsey. I fear you forget your
manners."</p>

<p>"I hate manners." Clara spoke cheerfully at her side, avoiding
the cracks between the pavings.</p>

<p>"You will like them better some day, <i>ch&eacute;rie.</i> Why
do you jump so from stone to stone?"</p>

<p>Because it's a game we made up, and one of the rules is never
step on a crack."</p>

<p>"Well, then, manners are a game, too. I am only telling you the
rules of politeness so that you will play well and not make
mistakes when you are grown up."</p>

<p>"Is politeness like checkers?" Clara was very definite once her
interest had been roused. "My brothers play checkers on a red and
black board."</p>

<p>"A little like checkers, yes&mdash;more perhaps like a difficult
game called chess. Now be sure to be very polite the next time Mr.
Bryant or any of Uncle and Aunty's friends speak to you. I shall
let you select the peppermints."</p>

<p>Henry smiled later when she told him of this conversation.</p>

<p>"It is hard to discipline Clara," he said. "Her natural
friendliness defies rules."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must admit she has a gift for people, but she must learn
now without conscious effort the social formalities. Politeness
should be a matter of course."</p>

<p>"I seem to remember a certain occasion when politeness deserted
you, my dear," he reminded her with fond amusement in his look. "If
I had not overlooked it as I did&mdash;who knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, my little Henri, I believe you actually treasure my
rudeness to you that first evening! Can you not be charitable and
forget that lapse now that we have been married for over five
years?"</p>

<p>Henriette came to dread the arrival of mail from across the
Atlantic in those months. Cyrus's family had joined him abroad,
taking Henry's sister Mary Elizabeth with them. She had been left a
widow soon after her marriage, and her health was failing. Her
death in Paris shocked and saddened the whole family group. But
Cyrus must push on with his negotiations. He could not take time
for grief just when he had persuaded British officials to furnish
ships for another experiment in cable laying and to promise a
Government subsidy for official messages if the venture succeeded.
England had responded to the practical possibilities of his
Atlantic Telegraph more readily than his own country. A new company
was being organised, he wrote home with confidence in every stroke
of his pen.</p>

<p>This time it was to be upon an infinitely larger scale. Three
hundred and fifty shares of stock had been issued at a thousand
pounds a share. Queer, Cyrus added in a postscript to Henry, that
he, a dyed-in-the-wool Yankee, should find himself heading a
company that had turned out to be predominantly British.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Day when he landed in New York with the second
venture before him and over sixty shares of undisposed-of Atlantic
Telegraph stock standing in his name. If Congress could be
persuaded to follow England's example and support the enterprise,
he was certain of success.</p>

<p>"He's off to Newfoundland again, and in such weather!" Cyrus's
wife sighed as she shook the snow from her bonnet and shawl and
drew closer to Henry's fireside.</p>

<p>"But he'd promised to keep New Year with you and the children,
Mary," Henry protested. "He told me so only day before
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't like the sound of those reports in the letters
that were waiting. I kept them from him as long as I could. I don't
know what another rough voyage will do to that cough of his. He'll
never give up, no matter what."</p>

<p>"No, he'll never give up." There was pride in Henry's voice,
though he too shook his head anxiously. "Not if it kills him."</p>

<p>"Hush, Henri, please; that is no comfort to Mary." Henriette put
in. "If this deep-sea demon could kill him it would most certainly
have done so before now!"</p>

<p>She had never been congenial with Cyrus's wife. They had little
in common except family matters. But Henriette gave credit where
credit was due, and she admitted that Mrs. Cyrus was meeting the
strain with fortitude.</p>

<p>"Well," their guest said later as she rose to go home, "it'll be
1857 before we know it, and what the new year will bring, I don't
even let myself think."</p>

<p>"All that Cyrus hopes for," Henry reminded her. "We must pray
for it with all our hearts."</p>

<p>"Oh, Henry, I'm so worried all the time, I'm afraid my prayers
won't do much good. You don't know what it's like," she said,
turning to Henriette, "&mdash;and I hope you never will&mdash;to
have people shake their heads when your husband's name is
mentioned, or have your friends take you aside and say his mind's
affected and he ought to&mdash;to be put away somewhere."</p>

<p>Henry's face was grave when he returned from seeing his
sister-in-law to her door.</p>

<p>"Poor Mary," he said; "her endurance is being tested. I wish
Cyrus were not heading into these northern fogs; but he'll find
himself in thicker fogs when he goes to Washington to talk
congressmen into voting the appropriation he needs."</p>

<p>"Yes," Henriette agreed, "of the two evils, I should choose
Newfoundland."</p>

<p>Henriette was to remember the year 1857 with peculiar vividness.
In the far west Stephen Field, the brother she was yet to know, was
elected to the Supreme Court of California, while in Washington
Cyrus, overwrought from illness and anxiety, began his campaign for
a congressional subsidy of seventy thousand dollars. He roamed like
a restless ghost through the Capitol lobbies, trying to convince
senators and representatives of the reasonableness of the proposed
bill. If England, he pointed out, had voted such an appropriation,
the United States should be willing to assume an equal share in the
support of his enterprise. But everywhere he met opposition and
indifference. Political machinery baulked him at every turn. From
his down-town editor's desk Henry followed the progress of the
bill, hardly daring to believe it had a chance to win.</p>

<p>"The Atlantic Cable," Henry was to write later of this critical
stage, "has had many a kink since, but never did it seem to be
entangled in such a hopeless twist as when it got among the
politicians."</p>

<p>Congressmen and senators wrangled. Spokesmen from the South,
with their minds on States' Rights and matter of more immediate
economic pressure, opposed it, but Cyrus's few supporters, headed
by Mr. Seward, the influential senator from New York, were
determined that it should not be lost in the last sessions of
Congress. It was mid February when the bill passed the House by a
slim majority.</p>

<p>"We've got the president on our side," Cyrus assured them on one
of his hurried visits home. "Now if we can get it past the Senate
we can start work again this summer."</p>

<p>Henry repeated Cyrus's words to his wife that evening.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is a chance?" She put the question
directly.</p>

<p>"With Senator Seward behind it, yes, I think so. Still there's a
bare fortnight to do it in."</p>

<p>It was March 4th before they knew that it had passed the Senate
through fierce hostility and won by a single vote. President Pierce
had signed it a few hours before he left office.</p>

<p>That was the spring that Henriette saw a young actor named Edwin
Booth give a remarkable performance of <i>Richard II.</i> at the
Metropolitan Theatre. Henry had complimentary tickets, and they had
gone, knowing little of the chief player save that he came of a
famous theatrical family, that his father was Junius Brutus
Booth.</p>

<p>"He is young, and this is to be his New York d&eacute;but,"
Henry had warned her as they waited for the curtain to rise. "I
believe he has had some experience with a travelling company, but
we must not expect too much."</p>

<p>They had sat incredulous in the not too crowded theatre before
the miracle of genius that wrapped a slender, dark-eyed man of
twenty-four in the mantle of dramatic authority. When the curtain
fell for the first intermission they turned excitedly to each
other.</p>

<p>"Oh, Henri," she exclaimed. "This young Mr. Booth is already a
great actor! He speaks with the tongue of men and angels. What a
Hamlet he will be some day!"</p>

<p>All that summer through the heat of July and August a sultry
sense of uncertainty hung over the country, though the storm of
financial panic did not break until September. Henriette was glad
when Henry proposed that they go to Stockbridge for part of August.
The old parson and his wife had failed greatly since the Golden
Wedding celebration. They showed the effects of their youngest
child's death and the strain of waiting for letters from Matthew in
the north and Cyrus in English waters on the latest cable-laying
expedition.</p>

<p>It was in the tranquillity and green beauty of Stockbridge they
waited with impatience through those late summer days, knowing that
the second attempt to link two worlds was in progress. This time
Cyrus was to start from the coast of Ireland in the screw-propelled
ship <i>Niagara.</i></p>

<p>"Now they must be well on their way," Henry said again and
again, as he consulted Cyrus's last letters and the most recent
British newspapers.</p>

<p>"'Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
to the end of the world,'" old David Dudley Field murmured, pacing
under the elms along the village street with his thoughts those
thousands of watery miles away.</p>

<p>It was three weeks before they knew that once more disaster had
overtaken the expedition. Four days out, with nearly four hundred
miles laid on the ocean bed, the cable had parted without warning.
On board the <i>Niagara</i> Cyrus and his men had stood helpless as
half a million dollars and the work of two years sank to the
bottom.</p>

<p>"Once again&mdash;failure." Henry could say no more when he
brought back the news.</p>

<p>"It cannot be possible he will have the courage to try again,"
Henriette said later when they were alone. "There must be an end to
Cyrus's money if not to his confidence."</p>

<p>But Henry shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know how he will do it," he insisted, "but I know he
will."</p>

<p>Two days later they returned to a city where new fears already
crept up from the congested streets about the Stock Exchange,
through the long channels of Broadway and the avenues, into the
prosperous security of Stuyvesant Square and Gramercy Park. The
glorious bubble of Western expansion, of speculation in railroad
stock had burst. The Ohio Life and Trust Company was the first bank
to close its doors, and five thousand others were to follow its
example as if a cyclone had struck them. Panic was
everywhere&mdash;in New York and New England, in Philadelphia, in
the cotton centres of the South and the newer cities of Ohio and
Kansas, in the ports of the Great Lakes and as far west as San
Francisco.</p>

<p>"No," Henriette told her Irish servant patiently again and again
that autumn, "we will not preserve peaches and pears this year.
Times are hard, so be saving with butter and eggs and molasses. We
do not know what to expect."</p>

<p>Henry remained calm. He understood little of stock markets and
over-expansion. But, like Henriette, he knew what it meant when
banks closed their doors; when presidents of old firms and heavily
capitalised railroad lines disappeared or shot themselves rather
than face their creditors; when the best houses in the
neighbourhood suddenly stood empty with "To Let" or "For Sale"
signs on their walls. They shivered and crept closer together when
ragged men marched by the house, tramping east towards Tompkins
Square to the hunger meetings of the unemployed.</p>

<p>"It was like this in Paris&mdash;just after&mdash;" Henriette
faltered to Henry more than once in those first damp, chill weeks
of November. "Where will it end, my Henri, for the world&mdash;for
us?"</p>

<h3>Chapter Thirty-Nine</h3>

<p>It was early June of 1858. The year of stress and anxiety they
had somehow weathered lay behind them, and the green beauty of
England beckoned across the bows of the steamer <i>Amazon.</i>
Henriette strained her eyes for the loom of the Old World as nine
years before she had strained her eyes for sight of the New. In
spite of financial panic and uncertainty they were to have the
summer holiday in Europe that they had planned and hoped for since
their marriage. Not quite a holiday, Henriette reminded herself as
she found a sheltered spot where the land breeze would not play
quite such furious havoc with the yards of blue mohair in the
fashionably stiffened skirt of her new travelling costume. No,
Henry was to furnish a series of travel articles for his paper and
several others, and he would also contribute his editorials and
comment upon affairs in European capitals for his American readers.
The <i>Evangelist</i> had survived the hard times. It would never
compete with <i>Harper's</i> or the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in
popularity, but it had gained steadily in its following under
Henry's editorship. His business associates were trustworthy, and
he had proved a wise and scholarly commentator with a liberal
outlook on the religious and political affairs of the day.
Henriette's predictions had been fulfilled, and now his gifts for
travel and writing were to be combined as she had hoped they might
be.</p>

<p>She watched his small vigorous figure pacing the decks as
impatient and eager for the voyage to be over as he had been for it
to begin. His appetite for travel could never be satisfied. And his
enthusiasm! It flowed out to every one he met, whether that person
happened to be a distinguished foreign statesman, the ship's
captain, or some weather-beaten sailor on watch. How boyish he
still looked, swinging towards her with quick step and a smile
spreading across his face!</p>

<p>"Yes," she thought fondly, "my little Henri hardly looks his
thirty-six years."</p>

<p>She did not resent this quality of youthfulness in him, even
though it might, in time, accentuate the difference in their ages.
She was not without her personal vanities. She faced her mirror
deliberately, marking as she did so the lines that had deepened at
the corners of her eyes, the contours of cheek and chin and throat
that were no longer softly rounded. But her hair was still thick
and richly brown, her large mouth as full and generously curved. A
few months more and she would be forty-six. Ah, well, if years were
crowded with activity, with friendship, and with love, they were
not to be dreaded. She would not have Henri look older than his age
because it might be more flattering to her.</p>

<p>"Good news, my dear," he was telling her. "The pilot has just
come on board and reports that the <i>Niagara</i> is still off
Falmouth. We shall be in time to see Cyrus before he sails."</p>

<p>His arms were waving like a windmill's, and his coat blowing.
She half expected to see him take leave of the deck, blown out to
sea under his own power.</p>

<p>They landed in Plymouth, and Henriette longed to linger in that
harbour town of clean, white and grey houses sunk into the lush
green that flourished even where the sea beat so near on the great
sea-scarred cliffs. But Henry was set upon Falmouth seventy miles
away, where Cyrus was supervising the final preparations for his
next expedition. They found him at the Royal Hotel deep in
discussion with the directors of the company. Instantly they were
drawn into the bustle of preparation as he welcomed them and
launched into explanations that left them breathless. Suspense
quivered in the air of that little English inn, and in the harbour
the "wire squadron" waited orders for departure.</p>

<p>"We can't fail this time," Cyrus was assuring them. "We've
profited by past mistakes and we know our problem better. This trip
the <i>Niagara</i> and the <i>Agamemnon</i>, each with escort, will
carry the cable to a rendezvous in mid-ocean. We'll splice the
lines there and then start in opposite directions. I'll be on the
<i>Niagara</i> heading for Newfoundland and the <i>Agamemnon</i>
will make for the Irish coast. This new device for the release of
the brakes works automatically and relieves any sudden strain. If
we'd had it a year ago the break wouldn't have occurred. And then
we've increased the weight of the cable."</p>

<p>He drew a bit of the coil from his pocket and laid it on the
tablecloth between them. His lean, nervous fingers played with it
lovingly as he pointed out the strands of copper wire which would
be the living core in that protective covering of interwoven hemp,
iron wire and gutta-percha.</p>

<p>Henriette could not suppress a feeling of awe and unbelief as
she took it into her own hands.</p>

<p>"But it is so little!" she exclaimed. "No, it cannot be possible
that this can stand the fury of the sea and the weight of miles of
water!"</p>

<p>"It's tougher than it looks, Henrietta," Cyrus was going on with
almost parental pride. "This new one weighs three times as much as
the old. Not that mere weight matters; it's strength and
flexibility that count when we start to pay out. Our tests show it
can carry eleven times its own weight in water, and we figure a
depth of about two and a half miles on the course we've picked.
Allowing for that, it's more than equal to the strain."</p>

<p>"Ah," she thought as she watched Cyrus's worn flushed face and
heard his tense voice, "but will the man be equal to the strain as
well?"</p>

<p>He was, as she had said before, possessed of a demon. He
scarcely seemed to eat or sleep; and a fierce, half-fanatical light
showed in his grey, deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>"I cannot look into his eyes," she told Henry. "They frighten
me. It is as if they also were charged with this electrical
current."</p>

<p>They visited the cable-loaded vessels and attended a ship's
service the Sunday before the sailing. The officers and crew stood
with bare, bowed heads while Henry prayed and repeated the
familiar, significant words of the 107th Psalm:</p>

<blockquote>"They that go down to the sea in ships, and occupy
their businesses in great waters, these men see the works of the
Lord, and his wonders in the deep."</blockquote>

<p>Henriette could not see for tears as those men's voices were
lifted together.</p>

<blockquote>"Oh hear us when we cry to Thee<br>
For those in peril on the sea."</blockquote>

<p>Her eyes were still blinded with them as men's hands helped her
into the tender.</p>

<p>"Don't you load us down with those tears, ma'am," a pleasant
voice cautioned her. "We'll ship enough salt water before we get
our lady passenger spliced safe and sound. She's like all the rest
of you: needs plenty of humouring."</p>

<p>And then she and Henry were in Paris! It did not seem possible,
but there they were with the familiar streets and signs, the sounds
and smells and the rhythm of her native tongue on every side. She
wept, and she laughed, and she sat silent under such a press of
memory that she hardly knew what Henry said in English beside her.
He had chosen a new hotel, not too near the
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute;, and yet close enough to the old
scenes to please her. Their parlour and bedroom windows faced the
green of horse chestnut trees, the walks and carefully tended
flower-beds of the Tuileries Gardens.</p>

<p>"Oh, my Henri!" she told him again and again through the wonder
of those first days. "It is too much for me to be here once more
and to be happy in my return."</p>

<p>"I had hoped it might not be too difficult, and yet I was half
afraid that certain memories&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But no," she hastened to reassure him, "I see Paris through
your eyes, and so even the past has no power to hurt me."</p>

<p>Some of the old friends were no longer there to welcome her.
Pierre and Madame Le Maire had gone, and Adolphe Monod's recent
death had left a gap in that hospitable circle. But
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod and his wife embraced her as if she
had been a long-absent sister, and their affection for Henry had
doubled. Night after night they talked in those rooms with the
furniture exactly as she remembered it&mdash;the sofa set between
the long windows, the gold and onyx clock ticking on the mantel
under the mirror, the silver coffee urn shining in its old place on
the sideboard. There was a sense of reassuring permanence about
these inanimate objects that had remained unchanged, as there was
reassurance in this reunion with old friends. They talked for hours
on end; and whether it was of now or of then that they spoke, there
was sure to be the same refrain: "Do you remember?" Those three
simple words held them close and would keep them so always.</p>

<p>With Albert and Marie Remey it was the same. They were as serene
and content in their modest prosperity as they had been in the old
precarious days. Marie had grown plumper, and there was grey in her
hair; but her eyes were as soft and dove-like as they had been when
she was a bride. Albert stooped more and wore heavier spectacles;
otherwise he seenied unchanged, though he now lectured to crowded
classes, and his scholarly theses were praised by the academic
world where he had found his own niche. They lived in comfort now
and could afford the luxuries of a pleasant apartment nearer the
Sorbonne and a maid to help in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"But I would not trust the soup or the sauces to her on such an
occasion as this," Marie confided when they gathered about the
table. "See, we have kept the basket you brought that snowy New
Year and filled it with fruit once more. And here is the cake dish
you gave us on our first wedding anniversary. I always wash and dry
it with my own hands."</p>

<p>These souvenirs, cherished because she had presented them long
ago, brought the past back to Henriette with almost too great
vividness. She stared at the forgotten shape of the basket,
remembering also the shape of the strong, fine hand that had lifted
it from the carriage through falling snow. Those incredibly plump
pink roses were bright on the china dish, impervious to revolution
and change and the rising fortunes of a new French Empire. Memories
that even Henry and her kind hosts could not share crowded upon her
in those moments like a flock of unseen birds.</p>

<p>"Only see, Monsieur. Field," Marie was going on, "she made this
sketch in Corsica, and this pastel of flowers she did in the
ch&acirc;teau de Vaux Praslin&mdash;"</p>

<p>Confused, she broke off at mention of the Praslin name. Albert
hastily changed the subject, but later Henriette drew him back to
it.</p>

<p>"Tell me all you know of them, Albert," she asked when they
spoke together and Henry and Marie were viewing the city from the
balcony. "I long to hear what has become of those children."</p>

<p>He told her what he could, though all he knew had been gleaned
from hearsay and meagre newspaper items. The eldest son had
inherited the title. All the daughter's were married. Sometimes he
read the announcement of a birth in that family circle.</p>

<p>"And Raynald." Her face grew tender and remote as she spoke his
name. "He must be a young man now. We could pass one another on
some street, and I should not know him. It is strange and a little
sad to think that when he was so dear to me."</p>

<p>"Yes," Albert agreed, "but his childhood will always be yours.
You made it happier for your presence. Never forget that,
Henriette."</p>

<p>"I like to think that he and Berthe will remember the old days
with less bitterness than the rest. Send me news of them when you
hear it."</p>

<p>"I will," he promised. "I had thought it might be painful for
you to be reminded of the old days."</p>

<p>"No, I am past all that now. Oh, Albert, it is good when we can
face our bitterest memories and find that the sting has gone out of
them."</p>

<p>But for all that she did not linger by certain personal
landmarks. She felt her knees shake once as she passed the small
jeweller's shop where the cameo had been bought on Raynald's
birthday, where that fatal newspaper had lain on the counter. She
looked the other way whenever they were in sight of the grey pile
of the Conciergerie. She did not regret that in his remodelling of
certain sections of Paris Napoleon III had demolished part of the
Rue de Harlay. She was glad that shabby house and the window of the
Needle's' Eye were gone for ever.</p>

<p>It was on her last afternoon in Paris that she had her first
sight of the new emperor and empress. She was returning alone from
a shopping tour. Her arms were full of gifts for the relatives in
America, and she glowed with the zeal of feminine accomplishments
as she neared the hotel. She had just crossed the Rue Castiglione
and was continuing along the Rue de Rivoli when she heard a distant
commotion&mdash;cheers and the clatter of hoofs. Mounted guards,
brilliant in the palace uniform, were clearing the way for
royalty.</p>

<p>"Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Imp&eacute;ratrice!"</p>

<p>Scattered shouts mingled with hoofbeats and the grinding of
wheels as the royal carriage came to a halt beside the curb where
Henriette stood, curious and bundle-laden. In that brief pause
while the street was cleared of other vehicles she found herself
staring straight into the faces of Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie. She
was so near that she thought she smelled the perfume that rose
faintly about the empress, who bent and bowed acknowledgment of the
crowd's cheers. Napoleon seemed less impressive in the flesh than
in the various portraits displayed in shops and stalls. He looked
sallow and dyspeptic, and his limp goatee and heavy lids gave him a
sleepy expression. But Eug&eacute;nie surpassed any likeness of
herself. Only the German artist Winterhalter had been able to put
any hint of her spirit and beauty on canvas.</p>

<p>"Yes," Henriette decided, noticing the pure, proud cut of those
features, "she is all queen whether she is the Spanish upstart they
call her or not."</p>

<p>Everything about her was perfection&mdash;the grace of her body
under the billowing blue folds of skirt and tightly fitted bodice,
the burnished bronze of her hair beneath the small feathered hat
she had made fashionable that season, the brilliance of her
complexion and of her eyes. Their glance rested on Henriette for
the fraction of a second. Cool, impersonal eyes, she thought, but
blue as gentians.</p>

<p>A cracking of whips, and the carriage with its Imperial crest
began to move again. New cheers broke out as it rolled on towards
the Tuileries. As she stood staring after it Henriette could not
help remembering those very different cries that had rung in her
ears ten years before while the palace was looted and another royal
family made its escape through barricaded streets. Napoleon III had
been an exiled prisoner then with few political prospects, and
Eug&eacute;nie had been only an exceptionally pretty girl with a
title from her Spanish father that meant little and an ambitious
Scotch mother. Ten, eleven years ago, who could have guessed how it
would turn out?</p>

<p>"But for the Praslin case," people still speculated on Louis
Philippe's disastrous exit, "there might have been no Second
Empire."</p>

<p>Henriette knew what they said. A murder in the Rue du
Faubourg-Saint-Honor&eacute; had touched off fires of discontent
that might have smouldered for years and come to nothing. Sometimes
on such an occasion as this she asked questions that had no
answers. If she had stayed in England, if some other governess had
taken her place, would an exquisite woman in blue and a thickset
man of Corsican stock have been acknowledging those cheers on the
Rue de Rivoli? What would they have thought, those two in the royal
carriage, if they had known the identity of a woman with parcels in
her arms who had watched them pass? Ah, well. She gave a quick
shrug and hurried on. Mrs. Henry M. Field must not keep her husband
waiting. They were dining out that evening, and to-morrow they were
starting for Denmark.</p>

<p>"See!" As she bent over the packing late that night, Henriette
held out an engraving of the actress Rachel. "I could not leave her
likeness to flap to tatters in that stall on the Quai. She has been
dead six months now, and already Paris seems to have forgotten her.
Oh, Henri," she added, "I have felt to-day a little homesick."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps that is only to be expected," he comforted. "Of
course you will be homesick for Paris now you have seen it
again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mais non</i>, not for Paris," she corrected him quickly. "It
was for America the feeling overcame me."</p>

<p>"I believe you think of it more often than I." He smiled as he
drew her to him from among their unpacked possessions. "Nothing you
might have said could have made me so happy."</p>

<p>"I did not know how I should miss America," she went on. "It may
not be the country from which I came, but it is a country I have
shared. No, Henri, you belong to that soil, and I, too, have
somehow taken root there with you. I shall not be sorry to return
when the time comes."</p>

<p>They were in Switzerland in August when the news reached them
that the Atlantic Cable was laid. Henry could not speak for his
emotion, and at first they scarcely dared to believe in the truth
of the rumour. But it was true. There had been delays and another
break in the lines on the earlier start. The ships had crept out of
harbour a second time that summer almost without notice, so weary
and sceptical had even the loyal British public grown of the
enterprise. The lines had been spliced in mid-ocean, and the ships
had steamed in opposite directions, uncoiling their miles of cable
to eastward and westward. The <i>Niagara</i> with Cyrus on board
had reached Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, without mishap. The cable
had been joined to the telegraph base on shore, and contact
established with Ireland, where the <i>Agamemnon</i> had
successfully completed her course. Live currents ran from Europe to
America on that August morning. From Stockbridge to San Francisco
word of the miracle sped. Boston fired a salute, and New York set
off fireworks; Factories and ships whistled and schoolboys rang
bells and lit gigantic bonfires. London, Paris, Berlin and Rome
confirmed the report of the triumph. At last Queen Victoria's
message of congratulation crossed the Atlantic, and President
Buchanan returned her felicitations. Almost overnight Cyrus had
become an' international hero.</p>

<p>"Listen, listen, Henriette. They're all talking of Cyrus and the
cable!"</p>

<p>Henry's face was radiant in those days. Wherever they went they
heard the familiar name. In French, in Italian, in German they
heard it spoken with every conceivable accent and intonation.</p>

<p>"Oh, to be at home now!" Henry sighed at each fresh burst of
jubilation.</p>

<p>Even his love of travel could not make up for missing New York's
demonstration in his brother's honour. Having shared in the
preparations and discouragements only to be absent when success
came was almost more than he could bear. He would have hurried back
on the next westbound ship if Henriette had not restrained him. It
<i>was</i> impossible, as she pointed out, to reach New York in
time for the celebration; and he could not afford to shift his
plans and give up the remaining articles he had undertaken.
Besides, she reminded him, his part was to write the history of the
Atlantic Cable, and Cyrus would be too deluged by this first frenzy
of rejoicing to give him accurate details of the final
accomplishment.</p>

<p>So they continued their journey, and it was three weeks before
they learned that while the official celebration to the promoters
of the enterprise was at the height of its glory, the cable signals
had suddenly grown faint. Engineers at the Newfoundland and Irish
coast bases had worked frantically, but all their efforts had
failed. The spark had flickered fitfully for a time and then gone
out.</p>

<p>"The Atlantic Cable is dead!"</p>

<p>They heard it as they boarded the ship at Havre that was to take
them back to America. Public reaction was only too apparent. Sullen
looks and sneers took the place of recent elation. "People were
ashamed of their late enthusiasm," Henry was to write years later
of that aftermath, "and disposed to revenge themselves on those who
had been the object of their idolatry."</p>

<p>Henriette touched her husband's arm and tried to urge him away
from a group clustered about the latest editions of French
newspapers that had been brought on board just before the ship left
dock. The dejection in his face smote her as she saw him reading
the headline that confirmed this new failure. She was thankful the
talk was in such swift French that Henry could not follow it as
well as she.</p>

<p>"No," he insisted when she tried to distract him, "tell me what
they are saying."</p>

<p>"Please, Henri," she begged, "do not make me repeat it."</p>

<p>"But I must know."</p>

<p>"Well, then," she told him reluctantly, "they say that the
undersea telegraph is dead. It has ceased to operate."</p>

<p>"Suppose it has&mdash;temporarily! It will work in time. What
has been done once can be done again. But tell me what they're
saying of Cyrus. I caught his name just now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Henri, they are saying such terrible things! They say it is
a gigantic 'hoax,' and that Cyrus speculated with his shares,
selling them when the messages were coming through successfully.
Now that the line is dead, they say he has abandoned it. Of course
we know that is not true, but, Henri, do not press me to go on. I
beg you not to protest. Come to the other side of the ship, where
we can have another sight of France. Our summer holiday is so
nearly over. Give me these last few days. You will hear the truth
soon enough."</p>

<h3>Chapter Forty</h3>

<p>Henry stamped the snow off his boots and sighed contentedly as
he shed his hat and overcoat and found the fire lighted in his
study. Snow had been falling all day, and the horse-car that had
brought him from his down-town office had been hampered by wind and
drifts and other struggling vehicles. He felt chilled and tired,
and he hardly heard the greetings of nine-year-old Clara, who
rushed to meet him. It had been a difficult day, and he was weary.
His eyes ached from finishing his writing by gaslight in time to
reach the printers' hands, and there had been a long and difficult
conference of the editorial staff and owners to discuss new
contributors and the paper's policy in the forthcoming presidential
elections. Even a religious weekly, it seemed, could not keep
altogether clear of politics when they were so bound up with the
very life of the nation. No one who read or thought at all could
help being aware that the issues were very grave and were growing
graver each day. All the men whose opinions he
respected&mdash;Bowles of the <i>Springfield Republican,</i> Bryant
of the <i>Evening Post,</i> Greeley of the <i>Tribune,</i> Peter
Cooper, Henry Ward Beecher, his brothers David and Cyrus across the
Park, and Stephen in the far West&mdash;agreed that the Union was
threatened with perhaps the most serious crisis since its
formation. There were even those who predicted that the country was
on the verge of war. That, of course, was carrying pessimism too
far, but no one could deny the existence of this rift between North
and South; no one could deny the situation called for a President
of the calibre of Washington and the far-sighted genius of
Jefferson if the country was to weather the next four years. And
where was such a man to be found?</p>

<p>Henry dropped into his leather chair by the fire. It was good to
relax in the warmth without taking up the evening paper he had
bought on his way home. He gave another sigh and stretched his feet
to the fender. Times were growing too strenuous and uncertain for
him. Once, he reflected, a minister need concern himself only with
the welfare of human souls. But now, whether one preached or wrote,
religion could not be kept clear of politics. It was no longer
enough to believe in God and to live according to Christian
standards and try to love one's neighbour as oneself. Neighbours
across the Mason and Dixon line wanted no love and certainly gave
none in return. That brutal attack on Charles Sumner in the Capitol
had proved how high the feeling ran.</p>

<blockquote>"John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave,<br>
John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave,<br>
His soul goes marching on.<br>
Glory, glory, hallelujah."</blockquote>

<p>Clara's young voice was lifted as she came clattering down the
stairs; every word rang out, clear and thoughtless and sweet. Poor,
fanatical John Brown and his raid on Harper's Ferry! Henry did not
like to be reminded of that misguided martyr.</p>

<blockquote>"Glory, glory, Hallelujah&mdash;</blockquote>

<p>"Uncle!" She stopped in the middle of the line.</p>

<p>"Yes, Clara. But please sing another song. You know how I feel
about that one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot. Aunty said to tell you she'll be right down.
Dinner's nearly ready. It's early to-night because you're going to
the meeting."</p>

<p>"Meeting? What meeting?"</p>

<p>But Clara was gone without hearing his question. He hoped the
child had made a mistake. This was not Henriette's evening to teach
the art class she had undertaken at Peter Cooper's new school, and
she had given up taking pupils in the evening now that debts were
paid and his salary was enough to cover their needs. He wanted an
evening alone with her by the fire, with snow dulling the noise of
hoofs in the street and no interruptions from a too complex world.
Perhaps he could finish that remarkable new book <i>Adam Bede</i>
that had been recommended as deserving of a review. Henriette had
been so impressed by its dramatic power and by the depth of its
human sympathy that she had urged him to make an exception in his
policy of leaving fiction reading for her.</p>

<p>"Henri!" He heard his name and the soft rustle of her skirts as
she hurried to him across the hall. "What a night! You are not
chilled from the cold ride?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I am almost thawed out; but it's been a trying
day, and I'm rather tired. I've been hoping all the way home for
the luxury of an evening here by the fire with you."</p>

<p>But she shook her head as she bent to kiss him.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten that to-night we go to hear this Westerner
speak? The one your brother David and Mr. Greeley regard so
highly."</p>

<p>"Must we go on such a night?"</p>

<p>"You promised Mr. Bryant. He sent the tickets this morning, and
he will introduce the speaker. The name is a strange
one&mdash;Abraham Lincoln." She stressed the last syllables in the
French fashion she could never overcome.</p>

<p>Henry laughed in spite of his weariness.</p>

<p>"I guess Honest Abe, as they call him out there in Illinois,
would be surprised to hear you giving a French accent to his name.
Well, it's certainly the last thing I feel like doing to-night, but
I'd never dare to face Mr. Bryant if we stayed at home."</p>

<p>"Or David. He has promised to call for us on his way to Cooper
Union. We must not keep him waiting, for he will escort this
Westerner to the platform."</p>

<p>"Yes, David's supporting his platform in more ways than one,"
Henry told her. "He thinks the man has a fair chance of being
nominated by the Republicans for the Presidency next summer. It
seems an odd choice; but David heard him debate against Stephen A.
Douglas two years ago, and he never forgot it. There must be
something about this Lincoln, if he can get David and Greeley and
Bryant behind him."</p>

<p>"But not Cyrus," Henriette put in. "The Field brothers have very
different opinions on our next President."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd expect Cyrus to favour Seward," Henry reminded her.
"Without Seward the Cable appropriation bill would never have gone
through, and if he's elected Cyrus can count on his support again.
It's hard," he went on, "being pulled in two directions. Of course
I'd like to see Seward in the White House when it means so much to
Cyrus and his plans for raising the cable. But David and Bryant
both want what's best for the country, too. Nothing to do, I guess,
but give up our evening at home and hear this Rail Splitter for
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Rail Splitter?" she questioned, puzzled. "You cannot expect me
to know these political terms."</p>

<p>Henry smiled in amusement as they went in to the dinner
table.</p>

<p>"It has nothing to do with politics, my dear. This Abraham
Lincoln, it appears, spent his youth cutting logs into fence rails
out there in the backwoods. He's completely self-taught, if one can
believe what's said about him. He picked up what education he could
for himself. Learned law by practising it mostly. I doubt if you've
ever met his type in America, and he's probably never seen an
eastern audience like the one he'll address to-night."</p>

<p>"If there <i>is</i> any audience for him in such a storm.
Listen. Henri, to the snow ticking on the window-panes. I am
thankful David will take us. There will be few cabs out for
hire."</p>

<p>Cooper Union, towards which they were soon moving in the comfort
of a private closed vehicle, had materialised from the vague scheme
that Peter Cooper had outlined four years before. The large, red
bulk of a building partially filled an irregular piece of property
that had been redeemed from an unsavoury open space formerly used
as a slaughtering place for cattle. It stood on Seventh Street,
bounded by Third and Fourth Avenues and the district known as the
Bowery. Their capitalist neighbour had personally supervised its
construction and had spent many hours at the Henry Field home
discussing his architectural and educational theories. In Henriette
he had found an appreciative listener and a shrewd adviser. He
consulted her particularly in matters connected with the department
to be devoted to the instruction of young women. Woman's place, he
firmly contended, was predestined to be in the home. But Mrs. Henry
Field was one who could combine a home with creative work, and he
adopted a number of her practical suggestions. Her sympathy in the
undertaking had endeared her to him, and he had appointed her
principal of the institution's Female School of Art. He liked
nothing better than to drop in and discuss the problems of this pet
project, this "Union of Art and Science" for which he had set aside
six hundred thousand dollars of the fortune he had made in glue and
iron works. He liked, too, to roam through the building that bore
his name.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Mr. Cooper will be here to-night," she said as they
drew up before the great building, its gas-lit windows magnified by
the falling snow.</p>

<p>"Not many seem to be going in." David looked anxiously about as
they entered.</p>

<p>"It's still early," Henry reminded him as they scanned the
half-empty auditorium which was the founder's special pride. "I
recognise some faces among those present. Colonel Harper, the
publisher, just went in, and that looks like Beecher over there;
and I see our Twentieth Street neighbour, Mr: Roosevelt."</p>

<p>"Numbers count less than faces, perhaps." David tried to sound
cheerful. "However, it's a pity we have such a night. This first
eastern speech may make or lose the nomination for Lincoln. But we
can gauge his chances better to-morrow from the newspaper reports.
Well, I must go now to join Mr. Bryant and our speaker. I'll want
to hear later how he impresses you."</p>

<p>Their seats were in the middle section, well forward, and gave
excellent opportunity to watch the audience that straggled, in. It
was late in arriving and almost entirely masculine though a few
women, like Henriette, had accompanied their husbands. In the
warmth of the hall damp coats gave out a faint steam, and there was
a continual stamping of snowy boots and flapping of wet
mufflers.</p>

<p>"How many do you think are here?" Henry asked a young newspaper
man of his acquaintance who stopped to speak on his way to a front
seat.</p>

<p>"Well over a thousand, I'd say. Not a bad turnout, considering
the weather. Most of them seemed to have bought tickets, too, and
it's not all Republican party. I see plenty of Democrats are out to
size up this Abe Lincoln and his chances for the nomination. Looks
as if he might be matched with Douglas again."</p>

<p>"What do you know about him?" Henry questioned.</p>

<p>"Not much, but I'd hate to be in his shoes to-night. It'll be a
hard audience to win over, He's a good way from the home folks back
in Illinois."</p>

<p>His words and the half-expectant, half-hostile atmosphere of
those about her roused Henriette from indifference to curiosity.
She had come, almost in complete ignorance of the speaker, merely
because David and Mr. Bryant had seemed so insistent upon their
attendance. But now she found herself impatient to see and hear
this western Rail Splitter, this self-taught debater who had
somehow managed to draw a surprisingly large number of influential
men there on a night of snow and sleet. What would this Abraham
Lincoln be like, she wondered. What would he have to say? Did he
appreciate the honour that the author of <i>Thanatopsis,</i> one of
New York's most revered newspaper editors, was doing him by making
that introduction? Did he realise what it meant to have Henry's
brother David act as his escort? Did he guess that Henry Ward
Beecher, the most inspired master of words in the country, might
even be there to hear him?</p>

<p>A buzz of voices swept through the hall as the men took their
places on the platform. She had an impression of some one dark and
of immense height and thinness between her brother-in-law and Mr.
Bryant. Then they sat down, and her view was broken by those in
front. David looked unusually distinguished, she thought, in his
black, well-fitted clothes. He had grown grey though he was only in
his middle fifties; but it set off his fine features, his
strikingly blue eyes and fresh colour, and lent dignity to his
erect, strong figure. Mr. Bryant was rising now with his benevolent
poet's face, his full beard and impressive dome of forehead. His
words were, as always, well chosen and delivered with calm
precision. There was no doubt of his sincerity, his admiration,
from the beginning to the close of his introduction:</p>

<p>"I have only, my friends, to pronounce the name of Abraham
Lincoln, of Illinois," he was saying, "I have only to pronounce his
name to secure your profoundest attention."</p>

<p>Henriette moved in her seat to make sure of an unimpeded view of
the platform. But she need not have done so, for the figure that
rose was tall enough to be visible above any interfering head. It
seemed to her in the hush following the patter of applause that a
grotesquely lengthened shadow rather than a man dominated the
platform.</p>

<p>"Henry was right," she thought. "I have never seen any one like
this before."</p>

<p>Her first impulse was a desire to laugh at the ungainly
apparition. Then the very incongruity of that ill-contrived shape
filled her with a sense of pity. She braced herself mentally
against the titters she expected. To her relief none came. People,
she decided, must have been startled into silence even as she had
been.</p>

<p>He did not hurry to begin. In spite of his strange, shambling
walk he balanced his great frame squarely on his incredibly long
feet, and when he stood still, looking out across his audience, the
pause was deliberate, not hesitant. Studying the stark black and
white of that gaunt face, she marked the power of the jaw, the
glint of the eyes under their heavy brows, the nose that had the
flinty strength of some outcropping of granite rock in a pasture.
She found herself suddenly reminded of such bold natural outlines
that defied even summer's softening of green.</p>

<p>She smiled, too, remembering those figures set in cornfields to
frighten crows&mdash;angular frameworks in the guise of men, whose
garments hung as limp and shapeless upon them as did this man's. A
scarecrow, yes, but somehow touched with a sad magnificence as she
had seen them transformed sometimes by the setting sun.</p>

<p>He was speaking now, and at first she found it hard to follow
him because of the strange twang of his speech, unlike any she had
ever heard. The voice was not what she had expected. It was not
deep and resonant, such as that great frame might have produced; it
was not hoarse or rasping, which might have been in keeping with
that thinness of body. It was low and gentle though it carried his
words to the farthest seats. He spoke as if he were not on a
platform, rather as if he were leaning across the counter of some
country store, talking to a customer about the state of the
nation.</p>

<p>As he went on, Henriette lost the man and his voice in his
words. Then she became less aware of the words than of the thoughts
that transcended them. Without conscious effort his mind and hers
were fused into one. Issues and policies that had seemed beyond the
range of her understanding emerged clear as a pane of glass washed
clean of confusion and perplexity.</p>

<p>He spoke of the South, of those states upon whom the permanence
of the Union rested. Fearlessly, quietly and without bitterness, he
reviewed the cause of dissension between North and South. It was as
if a wise and ruthless surgeon laid his hand at the root of a dread
malady.</p>

<p>All the heated, fierce arguments for and against slavery that
Henriette had heard in those last ten years; all the controversy
over states' rights and free states, the inconsistencies that had
confused her as she tried to reconcile them with her own personal
views suddenly crystallised in the sure simplicity of his words, in
the tolerant conviction that made them significant:</p>

<blockquote>Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let
it alone where it is, because that much is due to necessity arising
from its actual presence in the nation. But can we, while our votes
will prevent it, allow it to spread into the national Territories
and to overrun us here in the free states? If our sense of duty
forbids this, then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and
effectively.</blockquote>

<p>He waved no oratorical banners from that platform. No figurative
eagle screamed ill-advised war cries in the name of patriotism.</p>

<p>Henriette sat, scarcely aware of herself, of Henry at her side,
of the whole tensely listening audience about her. Without fanfare
he finished what he had come there to say:</p>

<blockquote>Let us have faith that right makes might; and in that
faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand
it.</blockquote>

<p>Henry and she found themselves moving automatically with the
rest towards the doors. They stood together, waiting for David, as
the crowd departed. But they were too moved to heed the comments
about them. Mechanically they acknowledged the bows of
acquaintances who passed.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Henry spoke faintly as if he had just wakened from
sleep&mdash;"what did you think of Abraham Lincoln?"</p>

<p>"I could not think," she answered, "not after he began to speak.
Henri, he is America."</p>

<p>"You mean," he corrected her absently, "that he is an
American."</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head. "I meant it the way I said&mdash;he
<i>is</i> America. I would cast my vote for him if I were a
man."</p>

<h3>Chapter Forty-One</h3>

<p>On a Sunday evening just before Christmas of 1860 the talk that
flowed through the house on East Eighteenth Street was particularly
animated. Guests had never been more varied or congenial. Peter
Cooper and Mr. Bryant had both dropped in. Henry's publisher friend
George Putnam was there, and a young man named Charles Scribner
also with publishing ambitions. David Dudley Field had brought his
colleague William Evarts the lawyer. Edward Youmans had arrived
with John Fiske, who had come down from his Cambridge lectures. The
two had scarcely stopped their discussion of Darwin's theory of
evolution long enough to remove their hats and overcoats and greet
their hosts. J. G. Holland had appeared early to ask Henriette's
opinion of a new poem, and there were visitors from New England who
happened to be in the city&mdash;President Hopkins of Williams,
Charles Sedgwick of Lenox, and Professor and Mrs. Calvin Stowe from
Andover, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>"Yes," Henriette answered the question of the artist Eastman
Johnson, in whose work she saw great promise. "That is indeed the
authoress of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin,</i> Mr. Beecher's sister. You
will have no doubt of it if she feels in a mood to talk of her
experiences with that book or of her travels in England. But she
may prefer to listen, for she is at work on another novel to follow
<i>The Minister's Wooing.</i> Her husband is less well known but he
has a most stimulating mind. Mr. Henri finds his knowledge of Greek
and Latin amazing, and he is an ardent spiritualist. Do not
encourage him to talk of his messages from beyond, or our evening
will turn into a s&eacute;ance."</p>

<p>But they were all too busy with the affairs of the present-day
world to talk of the next. One subject after another held them
about the table and later round the parlour fire. Once Mr. Youmans
embarked on the works of Darwin, Huxley and Tyndall it was not easy
to stop him.</p>

<p>Then there was so much to discuss of other books and authors.
Mrs. Stowe's comments were well worth hearing, and she spoke from
personal experience&mdash;of Dickens and Thackeray whom she had met
in England. From the latest works of Carlyle and Ruskin and William
Morris they ranged to Tennyson, Kingsley, Matthew Arnold and the
Brownings, and nearer home to Emerson, Longfellow and Holmes.
Henriette even dared, in that advanced circle, to mention the name
of George Eliot, whose unorthodox union with George Henry Lewes had
been causing as great a sensation as her latest novel, <i>The Mill
on the Floss.</i></p>

<p>"I care nothing for what is said of her personal life,"
Henriette flung out a quick championship of this woman who had also
become the butt of scandal. "She has written a great book. There is
more honest religion between its covers than in twenty volumes of
narrow-minded sermons."</p>

<p>"It would surely surprise her to hear a minister's wife say such
a thing," some one ventured.</p>

<p>"She knows what I think of her and of her books," Henriette
assured them. "I have already written and told her of my
admiration."</p>

<p>Henry added his approval.</p>

<p>"With Henriette, to feel is to act," he said. "She must respond
to whatever has moved her. It would not have surprised me if she
had journeyed out to Chicago to tell Abraham Lincoln of her
satisfaction when he was elected."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lincoln!" Instantly the pulse of talk quickened at the
mention of that name. "What state will the country be in next March
when he takes the oath of office. Will there <i>be</i> a United
States by then, the way we're heading?"</p>

<p>"South Carolina means to show Old Abe and the rest of us she
won't be dictated to. She's the first one to talk back, but
there'll be others. They're only waiting for their
chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plough them under, I say. Plough them under." A cool New
England voice startled the room with unexpected intensity. "Might
as well do it now as later. They've got their dander up, and we'll
have to show them we've got our share of that, too."</p>

<p>They were off, and Henriette knew it. Words had left the safer
channels of books and theories. The <i>Origin of Species</i>, the
singing of that girl prodigy Adelina Patti, the possibility of
resurrecting the Atlantic Cable, the wonder of the pony express
that would bring mail from California in ten days or even
less&mdash;all these topics were forgotten once those names had
been spoken: Abraham Lincoln, South Carolina.</p>

<p>"But Lincoln can't hope to abolish slavery. He came right out
and said so&mdash;at Cooper Union."</p>

<p>"Who said it's a question of slavery? Though how he can take
that solemn oath to support the Constitution of the United States
and not know what it's going to mean if he keeps to the letter of
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I tell you he's against war. He's got to keep it from
coming to that."</p>

<p>"Remember his nomination speech in Chicago?" One of the younger
men had taken the floor. "I can't forget that part about a house
divided against itself." The speaker's face flushed as he repeated
the words: "'I believe this government cannot endure permanently
half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be
dissolved&mdash;I do not expect the house to fall&mdash;but I do
expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing,
or all the other."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, young man," a sceptical voice cut in;
"but he wrote that speech over six months ago, and South Carolina
has voted to secede. What's he going to do about that?"</p>

<p>"God knows! God knows what we're heading for in another
year!"</p>

<p>Henriette looked from face to face. Old friends, most of them,
there in the firelight, and yet to-night they seemed unfamiliar.
Fear, uncertainty, confusion and doubt had made strangers of them.
Insecurity was a tangible presence in the room. A year ago she had
hardly heard the name Abraham Lincoln and now she, like the others
there, knew that the fate of the country and all their small,
cherished destinies were in his keeping. "A house divided against
itself cannot stand." How terrible those words were, how beautiful
and true! How had he known with such sure instinct where to find
them in time of need?</p>

<p>"I've been called many names." Every one had stopped to listen
because the author of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> was speaking. "And a
good many were uncomplimentary. They say I must be an Abolitionist
because I wrote as I did about slavery. I'm against slavery, of
course, but I'm against violence, too. As my father put it:
'Abolitionists are like men who burn down their houses to get rid
of rats.'"</p>

<p>"Meaning certain southern states, Mrs. Stowe?" someone asked
pointedly.</p>

<p>"She means nothing is worth a war that would cripple free states
as well as slave ones," Henry interposed. "I'm in complete
agreement on that. I can't help feeling that this gesture of
defiance on South Carolina's part will blow over. It's only a small
section of the country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Small, yes," a voice interrupted, "but so are wasps. It's been
a little wasp from the beginning!"</p>

<p>The talk grew more heated. It seemed to Henriette that it
quivered and twisted about her like flames. As the actual fire in
the grate dwindled, this verbal one flared higher. It ignited them
all as they listened or flung out questions and answers. Opinions
leaped from every side; opinions that met and mingled and changed
hands in that room while the oil lamps flickered out and only the
gas jets on the walls burned blue with orange cores. Even when
their last guest had left, she and Henry could not stop talking.
They must go on, recalling opinions, hopeful or pessimistic;
comparing this remark or that, wondering which predictions and
warnings might prove to be prophetic by the end of another year.
The first milk wagon was jolting by in the stillness of early
morning when they fell asleep.</p>

<p>Christmas came and went. Bells everywhere rang in the year 1861,
and New York drank to it in eggnog, Madeira and champagne.
Washington warned South Carolina that Fort Sumter was Union
property and would be defended to the last extremity. New York was
in the grip of winter. It thought first of keeping warm and second
of national difficulties. Chimneys smoked with tons of burning coal
from the Battery to the less populous region above what the City
Fathers had taken over to be developed into a park. People hugged
grate fires and stoves. In Gramercy Park, Peter Cooper's pet trees
stood whitened with snow or dark with cold rains. Horses slipped on
the icy streets that tilted towards the rivers; street vendors
carried buckets of burning charcoal to keep their hands and feet
from freezing. Clara Field and the neighbours' children, the young
Putnams and Roosevelts, slid on the pavements going to school. They
sang "John Brown's Body" till their breath froze and stiffened the
mufflers round their necks.</p>

<p>Each evening Henry returned chilled by the long horse-car ride
from his office, carrying an evening paper that brought little
comfort in its news and editorials. By March faces, as well as
days, were growing longer. South Carolina was not alone in her
rebellion. Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia and Florida had
joined the scramble to secede, and Texas was preparing to follow
suit. They were a close-knit group of Confederate states, and they
meant business as even the most complacent northern newspapers were
forced to admit. They held a congress of their own and elected
Jefferson Davis president. The day Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated
in Washington, a new flag with seven stars and three stripes was
raised above another capital at Montgomery, Alabama.</p>

<p>There was a Confederate Army now with General Beauregard taking
command at Charleston. He had made formal demand for the surrender
of Fort Sumter. That was going too far, most Northerners said, and
yet there were others, even a Mexican War veteran like General
Winfield Scott, who thought it should be evacuated. But Major
Anderson and his seventy-five Union soldiers were there, awaiting
orders and the relief ships that had been dispatched.</p>

<p>In those days Cyrus moved feverishly between New York and
Washington. The winter had broken his buoyancy, but not his belief
that his cable could save the country from war. He was sure he
could prove that, if only he had a chance to resurrect it from the
bottom of the Atlantic. He had met bankruptcy that last December.
The mercantile firm he had bought and operated had felt the strain
of the recent financial panic and had been forced to suspend
business along with others in the city. Cyrus had paid his
creditors what he could by mortgaging his personal property. He was
carrying a heavy burden in loans, and every one with the exception
of himself considered his shares of stock in the New York,
Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company worth less than their
weight in paper. But Seward had been appointed Secretary of State
in Lincoln's Cabinet, and Seward believed in Cyrus and the project.
With the Government behind him again he could organise a new
company and begin work at once. Congress must listen to him before
another summer was wasted. If only he could make Washington listen!
He knew he could convince them from the new President down to the
most indifferent representative. All this talk of war only spurred
him on. His cable was the surest way to head off trouble. It would
never come to a war between the states if England and France knew
what was happening in America from day to day and could take
measures to prevent serious trouble.</p>

<p>"Lots easier to stamp out a bonfire before the house and barn
catch on," Cyrus was insisting one April evening when he had
stopped to see his brother and sister-in-law and report on the
progress he was making. "Not that we've got to the bonfire stage
yet, but there's no telling when we will be."</p>

<p>"I see your point, Cyrus," Henry agreed. "Still, I'm not sure
things haven't gone too far for even such an invention as the cable
to help. I wouldn't have said so last year or last month even; but
now you'll have to mend a break in the whole country as well as in
those undersea lines of yours. I'm afraid that's beyond any human
power."</p>

<p>"But it stands to reason&mdash;" Cyrus was on his feet, moving
about the room restlessly. His face showed strain and lack of
sleep, and he was so charged with nervous tension that Henriette
watched apprehensively as her mantelpiece ornaments quivered in
response to his pacing.</p>

<p>"Please sit down, Cyrus," she begged. "You are not a lion in a
cage, though you often remind me of one."</p>

<p>"I feel like one these days," he admitted with an apologetic
smile. "Sometimes I think I'll go crazy if I can't push through the
bars they've raised around me. You see"&mdash;he turned to Henry
again&mdash;"it all comes down to a question of dollars and
cents."</p>

<p>"Your cable&mdash;most certainly, and far more dollars than
cents."</p>

<p>"No, Henry, not the cable alone. I mean the situation we're in.
You never did understand finance, and why should you? But I'm a
business man, and I know it takes more than flags and bunting and a
lot of cheers to start a war and see it through. The South can get
money raising cotton, and England's her best customer. There you
have it in plain words. England and these Confederate States, as
they please to call themselves, are partners. They raise the
product, and she manufactures it. Great Britain, if she knows in
time, isn't going to see them leave their cotton-fields to go to
war. I said if she knows in time&mdash;that's the crux of the
matter."</p>

<p>"But if England should support the South the country would be
more divided than ever," Henry argued. "It might mean another war
with Great Britain for all we know.</p>

<p>"England's got trouble enough right now with her colonies and
her sepoy rebellions. All she wants is to make sure that Manchester
and some of her other big industrial centres don't have to stop
spinning. I know what the feeling is over there."</p>

<p>"Cyrus." Henriette broke into the discussion once more. "How
soon could you start work on the cable if you had the Government
behind you?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow!"</p>

<p>His reply was instantaneous, and the old excited glint that she
knew so well leaped into his eyes.</p>

<p>"For two years now," he was going on, "this committee of
investigation has been making tests and experiments, and they all
show it can be raised and spliced, or, what would be best, a better
line laid. There's a new ship, the <i>Great Eastern,</i> that would
answer my purpose exactly. I went over her while she was building,
and she's large and steady enough to lay it in half the time and
with half the risk. Just give me the summer, and I'll prove the
Atlantic Cable is alive, not dead!"</p>

<p>"I would most gladly give it to you if I could," Henriette
sighed as she laid down her sewing.</p>

<p>She was at her desk writing letters to go on the weekly steamer
for Europe, and listening to make sure that Clara did her full
half-hour of piano practice, when she heard Henry's voice at the
door. Even in fine spring weather he seldom returned before
half-past five or later. This was the day the paper went to press,
and that usually delayed him. But here he was, coming up the stairs
at a quarter-past four. She knew from his step that something was
wrong. He did not call her name as he usually did the instant he
closed the front door. Her heart began to pound even before she
caught sight of his face. She had not seen him look so stricken
since they had heard the news of that last cable failure.</p>

<p>"Henri, what is it?" She hurried to him, searching his face in
alarm. "You are ill?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear. I did not mean to frighten you by coming back
early."</p>

<p>"But something has happened. I know it from your look. The paper
has failed? We are ruined?"</p>

<p>"No, at least not yet. But I thought you'd be hearing soon. The
papers are beginning to be full of it, but we heard the news first
downtown. It's Fort Sumter&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off because his voice failed him. She took the paper he
had brought, and spread it on the desk. Her hands were shaking. The
headlines were large and in fresh black ink that smudged her
fingers as another hurriedly printed news sheet had done years
before. Then it had been "Murder" that the letters spelled. Now it
was "War." She read them with the same sense of unbelief.</p>

<p>Fort Sumter had been fired on off Charleston Harbour. Major
Anderson had stood by his order and refused the demand to
surrender, and Confederate guns had begun their bombardment. The
relief ships were too late in arriving, and the Fort had been
forced to lower the flag in surrender. It was war now. Nothing
could prevent that. The country only waited to hear the President's
proclamation.</p>

<p>Clara ran up the stairs, calling that she had finished her
practising. Pale mid-April sunlight slanted across the room, so
dear, so familiar, where she and Henry had been so secure in their
love, in each other, in the hope that somehow the worst could not
happen to this world of which they were a part.</p>

<h3>Chapter Forty-Two</h3>

<p>Twice in those four years Henriette was to stand with Clara at
her side, while flags and marching troops went by that she could
not see for the blur of her tears.</p>

<p>Marching figures in blue uniforms with packs and muskets became
an everyday sight to New York after Lincoln's proclamation that
followed the firing on Fort Sumter. He had called first for an
emergency militia of seventy-five thousand, and the response had
been immediate. Union or Confederate, every state must answer the
call to join one side or the other. No dodging the issue
now&mdash;one must stand by Lincoln or Jefferson Davis. Virginia's
choice was inevitable with Robert E. Lee in command of her forces.
North Carolina, Kentucky, Arkansas and Tennessee were added to the
southern cause. But Lincoln had the North and his own Middle West
solidly behind him. Regiments from New England and up the Hudson
poured into New York on their way to. Washington and points south.
By June Henriette scarcely went out upon an errand without hearing
the sound of fife and drum corps and the steady tread of men's
boots on city streets. She would look up to see some passing
company with a banner that proclaimed they had responded from Rhode
Island, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont or
Massachusetts. Once she read the name Hampden County on a flag and
thought as she did so of the neighbours' boys in West Springfield
who would be old enough to enlist.</p>

<p>Matthew's two older sons had both joined&mdash;nineteen-year-old
Henry with the 34th Massachusetts volunteers and Heman with the
71st New York Regiment. Heman was twenty-three now, a tall,
friendly, fun-loving young man who worked in Cyrus's firm. He was
going to war in a new uniform that he displayed with pride to his
uncles and aunts and to his admiring ten-year-old sister. He had
answered the first call for "Ninety-Day Volunteers," and now he was
leaving for the front. Perhaps he would cross over one of those
suspension bridges his father had built ten years before. But that
was unlikely. Matthew had prophesied his Tennessee and Kentucky
bridges and railroad lines would be the first to go in
war-time.</p>

<p>"You'll come to see us leave to-morrow, Aunt Henriette," the
young soldier had begged on a mid July day when he had come on
leave to say good-bye. "Mother and Father won't be able to get down
from Southwick, and Uncle can't leave his office to wait for hours
on a street corner, but I'd like for you and Clara to be there. If
you stand on the corner of Twenty-third Street and Fifth Avenue
I'll be sure not to miss you."</p>

<p>"Most certainly we will be there. At what hour will you
pass?"</p>

<p>But he could not be sure of that. He was not sure of anything
except that the regiment was to move South the next day.</p>

<p>Though they had been expecting the change for some weeks, they
could hardly realise the finality of the order. Matthew's oldest
son was going away into this something they call war. To-morrow he
would have left these rooms where his laugh echoed Clara's and his
feet in his new army boots tripped up the corners of the best
rug.</p>

<p>"It is not possible," Henriette thought as she watched him
consuming coffee and gingerbread in hearty gulps. "No, it is not
possible he is going away to kill&mdash;to be killed perhaps."</p>

<p>They stood with a crowd at that busy corner of Fifth Avenue.
They had been there since an early breakfast, and now it was nearly
noon. The July sun blazed down fiercely on their heads, and heat
almost as intense rose from the pavements. About them men, women
and children wilted as they waited. One division of the brigade
that was leaving had already passed on its way to entrain, but
there were long gaps between the battalions. Clara peered as far as
she could see down the length of Fifth Avenue and inquired once
more when the 71st Regiment would appear. Henriette envied the
child's endurance, her cheerful responses to those about her. Every
one within hearing distance knew that they were watching for her
brother's company, that he would be on the look-out for them, that
she had brought a package of lunch to give him and that she hoped
he would surely be on their side of the line.</p>

<p>"Some other soldier will be glad of the food if you cannot reach
him," Henriette had pointed out, to forestall possible
disappointment.</p>

<p>"But it's got his name on the paper, Aunty. They'd give it to
him, wouldn't they? I'd hate for him not to have the gumdrops I
picked out."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better eat 'em yourself, Sissie," a man at the curb
suggested. "You might get hungry before that brother of yours comes
by."</p>

<p>But Clara refused to think of such a thing. "I must get it to
him some way," she insisted.</p>

<p>Henriette and the man exchanged weary smiles. Argument was
useless, they saw. The child's face was flushed and eager under the
straw bonnet with its blue ribbons. There was a determined
expression that her aunt had come to recognise when she met it on
the face of that family whose name she answered to.</p>

<p>"Now they're coming! Listen, Aunty, you can hear the music! I'm
praying God to make it the 71st Regiment."</p>

<p>More drums were rolling out their mock thunder, challenging
pulses to quicken, urging feet to keep pace with that primitive
beat. One long blue line was swinging after another through the
dazzle of noonday. Henriette felt the hot press of bodies behind
her, crushing the crinoline of her skirts, knocking her bonnet
askew in eagerness to see over her head. Clara strained forward
calling out the numbers and names on banners that perspiring
colour-bearers held high. Cheers rose, now for this company, now
for the next.</p>

<p>For herself, Henriette had given up trying to distinguish the
marchers. The nephew who had sat in her parlour yesterday was
swallowed up like a single drop of water in those heaving blue
waves that were men's bodies moving in unison. They had no reality
in their uniforms and visored caps, and yet they were real. Their
feet and legs moved steadily, their arms swung and carried muskets;
and sometimes she saw eyes move and lips smile. Some were tall,
some were stocky, some were dark, some were fair&mdash;except for
that they might have been one soldier infinitely multiplied. Under
the shining mask of sweat they all wore, age, features, and
individuality were lost. She was grateful for the tears that shut
them from her sight.</p>

<p>"He saw us!" Clara cried out jubilantly above the noise of feet.
"Did you see him smile? He was way in the middle, but I guess he'll
get the package. I gave it to the man on the end."</p>

<p>Somehow they made their way through the crowd and began to walk
east. A few shops had awnings out, and Henriette made for these
patches of shade wherever possible. She scarcely heard Clara's
remarks at her side.</p>

<p>"Violence," she thought. "I cannot escape it. It follows me from
France to America."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Aunty?" Clara was asking. "You cried when
the 71st marched by, and now you're walking ever so slow and you
look&mdash;queer."</p>

<p>"I am tired, <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>," she said. "If I walk slowly
it must be because my heart is heavy with the weight of this
war."</p>

<p>"Uncle's too old to go, I guess," the child comforted her, "and
besides he's a minister and wouldn't know how to fire a musket.
Heman says you have to learn to be quick on the trigger or some
other fellow 'll get you."</p>

<p>"Clara, please! You do not know what you are saying."</p>

<p>"But <i>he</i> said it, Aunty. I'm only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, but do not repeat such words."</p>

<p>Henriette thought suddenly of her grandfather who had fought
through Napoleon's campaigns. She could not remember the Battle of
Waterloo, but her childhood had been passed in the ebb-tide of its
aftermath. She had witnessed revolution, had even been a part of it
herself. But that, it seemed, was not enough. The ruthless cycle of
war was to be repeated, and she was helpless before the forces
behind those marching troops. No wonder the elasticity had gone out
of her step; no wonder her heart felt like one of those lead
bullets whose power she knew. It was a signal of age when one
thought and felt like this even though one had no son to wear a
blue or a grey uniform.</p>

<p>"Well," she reminded herself, "why should you not feel old? You
are forty-eight years old, within sight of forty-nine."</p>

<p>Years had always meant little to her, but now for the first time
in her life she felt her age.</p>

<p>"Listen," Clara urged, "you can still hear the music. They're
playing 'John Brown's Body.'"</p>

<p>A military band was playing it on another morning when she and
Clara stood with a larger, quieter crowd at the same corner. It was
April, 1865, and in those four years the tune had come to be
whistled or sung as naturally as breath was drawn. "Dixie" in the
South,&mdash;"John Brown's Body" in the North&mdash;those two
melodies were for ever part of the struggle that had ended at
Appomattox Court House less than a month ago.</p>

<blockquote>"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the
Lord;<br>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are
stored."</blockquote>

<p>All about them people were singing new words that fitted the old
tune.</p>

<blockquote>"He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible
swift sword:<br>
His truth is marching on.<br>
Glory, glory, Hallelujah..."</blockquote>

<p>The men's voices sounded husky; the women's trembled as they
joined in; only the children's rose clear and unconcerned by the
significance of those words, by the solemn rolling of muffled
drums, by flags at half-mast. Across the Avenue fa&ccedil;ades of
buildings were draped in black crape. Hardly a house they had
passed but had worn some sign of mourning. The dark knots were
<i>soggy</i> from yesterday's rain.</p>

<p>Clara stood quiet beside her, a tall, half-grown girl of
fourteen. Her eyes were serious under the hat brim that partly hid
her long bright curls. "Copperhead," her playmates had teased her
through those years while she had protested her loyalty in furious
defence.</p>

<p>"Aunty!" She pressed closer and spoke in awed tones. "I never
saw men cry before. I didn't know they could."</p>

<p>The first divisions of the military escort were
passing&mdash;veterans of Bull Run and Shiloh, of Vickburg,
Antietam, and the Battle of the Wilderness. They marched with a
difference now. Their steps were surer, more wary. Their faces were
marked by experience no less plainly than the banners they carried,
faded or bullet-riddled. There were carriages for some who could
not march. Limp blue sleeves were pinned against the chests of
others.</p>

<p>If Matthew's sons had come home like that! But thank God they
were both safe. Heman had been honourably discharged from service,
though Henry was still with his regiment in Texas.</p>

<p>People pressed thick behind Henriette, but no one jostled to
gain a better place. There were no cheers, only low murmurs as the
divisions filed by. A hush of waiting hung over them all. It was as
manifest as the fresh wind that spread the flag folds in the thin
April sunshine. Somewhere in the crowd a name was spoken, and a
bitter oath answered. Clara turned with a shocked expression.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunty!" she whispered. "They swore at Mr. Booth's brother.
Isn't it terrible?"</p>

<p>"Hush, we must not speak of it here. We must remember that Edwin
Booth is a great actor; nothing can change that, whatever his
brother may have done. If Edwin Booth ever plays 'Hamlet' again we
will go to show that this makes no difference to us."</p>

<p>"And will he come into the box afterwards in his costume and
talk to us, the way he did before?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. There, I think I hear the Funeral March in the
distance, and men are removing their hats."</p>

<p>It was coming at last, the strong slow-stepping horses with
their burden under black covers.</p>

<p>"Death is swallowed up in Victory." Henriette found herself
remembering those words.</p>

<p>That was from the burial service. They were glorious words.
Surely Abraham Lincoln deserved them more than any man who had ever
lived. But she must think rather of his own words that she had
heard his living voice say on a night five years before: "Let us
have faith that right makes might; and in that faith let us to the
end dare..."</p>

<p>She could recall the very tones of his voice. She could have
sketched his large hands in charcoal on paper, so vividly had their
shape remained with her. Hands like roots, she thought, roots that
hold the earth in its place when, storms threaten. She had seen
them cling tenaciously to the soil even after the tree had been
felled.</p>

<h3>Chapter Forty-Three</h3>

<p>Henriette woke early on that July Sunday of 1866. The dimity
curtains scarcely stirred though the air was still fresh from night
dew and darkness. It would be another warm day, and the Stockbridge
robins and finches and orioles had been clamorous ever since
sunrise. She slipped from bed, wrapped a shawl about her
nightdress, and left the bedroom without disturbing Henry. No one
was astir in the house but herself. She paused at the foot of the
stairs, as she often did when she was alone, reaching out to those
quiet rooms in a rush of possessive affection. Sometimes, in such
moments, it seemed to her that the walls and all the familiar
furnishings responded to her happiness in them.</p>

<p>"It is our own," she reminded herself and Henry again and again.
"We shall return to it each year to renew ourselves in this country
that I, too, have come to love."</p>

<p>They had bought the place a year before when they had learned
that these acres on the hill and a small frame dwelling were for
sale. The house had been little more than a flimsy shell set on the
foundation of an older one. But it faced the hills and the valley
with its houses and church steeple. The bright thread of the
Housatonic wound below through meadows and wooded green. And if one
stood on the doorstep, as she was standing now, that tilted field
with the grey boulder and rock maple tree showed plainly beyond the
road. That landmark had been too much to resist. Henriette knew
they must not hesitate.</p>

<p>"It cannot be meant that this land should belong to others who
might perhaps cut down your tree or remove that stone where you
preached your first sermon, and where I first knew that your life
and mine must go on together."</p>

<p>She met the wish in his face with immediate decision.</p>

<p>"It does not matter," she hurried on, "that the house is small
and ugly. We will change that. Hills and trees and a rock to remind
us each day of your youth and of our love are far more important.
Is it not so, my little Henri?"</p>

<p>And he had agreed, knowing that this, miracle also would be
accomplished.</p>

<p>So many years of her life had been passed in cities that she
quickened to this renewal of acquaintance with the earth. Each foot
of their land she came to know intimately from the patch of woods
that closed in behind to the sloping field across the road where
the grass was fragrant with hidden wild strawberries and with sweet
clover and buttercups and daisies white as sea foam in the sun. She
would not let them be mowed down. Scythes might cut a narrow path
from the road to the boulder, but that was all. And after the
daisies passed there was the wonder of Queen Anne's lace, delicate
as hoar frost, and later 'the splendour of purple asters and
goldenrod at the first hint of fall.</p>

<p>The house conformed to no school of architecture, and therein
lay its charm. "A little brown teacup of a house," Henry had said
after their first inspection. "We will give it a handle and
saucer," she had decided, "and then it will fit our needs." With an
added wing, dormers for the upper rooms, and a veranda that faced
the valley, the teacup took on an air of rambling comfort among its
clumps of trees with the ground about it gradually turning into a
lawn. Flowers and vines began to prosper under the care and
encouragement she and Clara gave them.</p>

<p>"Often I feel the urge to pin back my skirts and dig and hoe,"
she told Henry. "The woodcutters on the road beyond us are so
wasteful it pains me to see how they leave twigs and branches
strewn about. If it were not that I feared to shock some of our
neighbours I should make bundles of faggots and carry them home for
your fires. Yes, Henri, now that we have acres of our own I could
easily become a peasant. Did you bring from New York the last
numbers of <i>Blackwood's</i>, and <i>Harper's Monthly?"</i></p>

<p>Henry had smiled at her inconsistency, and she smiled now on
this Sunday morning as she weighed the advantages of dressing to go
out and weed her flower border, or writing letters before the day's
activities began. She decided upon letter writing, for Henry could
take them with him to post in New York. Every other Monday he
journeyed to his office to spend several days over business
affairs; and when be returned to Stockbridge he continued his
editing from the upper study that overlooked the valley.</p>

<p>Here, as well as in New York, friends gathered on Sunday
evenings.</p>

<p>In fact, at all hours and on all days of the week they climbed
the hill on foot or by carriage. In pleasant weather the door stood
open for any visitor to enter without the ceremony of knocking.
Henry brought strangers and friends with him from the city;
neighbours appeared from all over the county; David and Jonathan
Field and their families came and went. Henry's father wandered up
from the village to sit for hours looking off at the valley which
was so bound up with his own life and the life of his children. He
liked to talk to Henriette of the past&mdash;of his wife who had
been gone now for five years, of the son who had sailed away to sea
and never returned, of his youngest child, the daughter whose death
he could never reconcile. His mind wandered through its maze of
experience and sometimes lost the way.</p>

<p>But she did not confuse him by trying to help sort out the
happenings of eighty-five years. He had the right, she thought, to
remember or to forget what he pleased. The dignity of his fine old
face, the lonely detachment that enveloped him touched her
deeply.</p>

<p>"Henri," she had said to her husband only the night before, your
father has failed in these last few months. When I see him with his
white hair I am reminded of the dandelions just before they go to
seed. Sometimes I am fearful he will blow away before my eyes as
they do."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Henriette?"</p>

<p>"I do not know exactly&mdash;only there is a look of waiting in
his face whenever he sits alone."</p>

<p>A clock struck eight. The smell of freshly ground coffee came
from the kitchen. Henriette folded the letter she had written as
Clara hurried downstairs fastening the sash of her dotted Swiss
muslin.</p>

<p><i>"Bon jour,</i> Aunty. Did you see the morning-glory by the
fence is out at last? And there are more sweet peas and mignonette,
and I'm sure that bud on the yellow rosebush must be open. I'll
have time to pick some before breakfast if I hurry."</p>

<p>Henriette watched Clara speed over the lawn, past the clump of
white birch trees that stood in the shade of their own foliage.
Then she rose from the desk and her letters. Henry was moving about
in the room above. She heard the sound of drawers being pulled
open. Probably he had forgotten his Sunday clothes had all been
laid out on a chair last night. She must hurry, or he would have
every drawer turned upside down just when she had finished tidying
them.</p>

<p>"Henri," she called, "wait a moment. I am coming."</p>

<p>She had forgotten to date those letters she had left unsealed.
What day was it? She glanced at the calendar in the hall to make
certain. Sunday, July 29, 1866, she read without knowing that she
would have reason to remember it always. The world beyond the
windows might look as it had looked yesterday, but for all that it
would never be the same world made up of smaller worlds separated
by salty miles of ocean; worlds going their own separate ways in
insular self-sufficiency. The Atlantic Cable had been successfully
laid at last, though it was high noon before they heard of it.</p>

<p>David had driven them to church. She and Henry and Clara had sat
together in the high white pew with its mahogany rail, conscious
that when the minister prayed for "those of this congregation whose
hopes are fixed upon a distant son and brother" he had referred
specifically to Cyrus and the latest cable expedition and the news
they awaited. But they had heard nothing for the last fortnight,
and in those ten years of suspense and disappointment they had
learned to take both prayers and congratulations calmly.</p>

<p>The service was over. They moved with the rest down the aisle to
the open doors and the steps leading to the shadow-and-sun-splashed
green. Old Dr. Field stood bareheaded among his sons and daughters
and their children, answering the greetings of the churchgoers.
Another minister might preach the sermon, but he still looked with
grave kindliness and concern upon those who had come to worship at
his former church.</p>

<p>"Father." David touched the old man's arm. "You'll come back
with us for dinner. I've a letter from Stephen to read you."</p>

<p>"From California? They come fast nowadays."</p>

<p>"No, Father," Henry reminded gently. "Stephen's been in
Washington for three years. You forget Lincoln appointed him to the
Supreme Court."</p>

<p>They had started towards the waiting carriage when the sight of
a man running down the village street, shouting as he came, made
them pause and peer curiously. No other figure moved in the quiet
of that Sunday noon; and there was something arresting about the
way he came on, waving a piece of paper and gesticulating. Too
breathless by the time he arrived to speak, he flung himself upon
the group about the old minister. David took the paper he held out.
He scanned it quickly, then handed it to Henry. No one spoke for
the moment it took to read those words. But in another moment the
decorous Sunday stillness had been shattered.</p>

<p>"It's laid&mdash;the Atlantic Cable's laid!" The messenger from
the telegraph office had found his voice again.</p>

<p>No doubt of it this time. The <i>Great Eastern</i> had come to
anchor off Newfoundland with her task well done. Her burden of wire
was all paid out safely, and living words were already speeding
under the Atlantic.</p>

<p>"This message is for you, Father," Henry put one of the papers
into the thin old hands. "It's from Cyrus at Trinity Bay."</p>

<p>Henriette had given up trying to speak or listen in that babel
of excited voices. Every one about her was talking, crying or
shouting in jubilation. Henry's hat had fallen to the ground under
their feet; David's urban clothes and manner were shaken as he
tried to hear questions and give replies.</p>

<p>"Yes," she heard him say, "it's been working for two days, but
the news just got through. Damage to the land wires this time, not
the cable. They'd about given up hope and didn't keep the line in
repair after last summer's failure Cyrus must have been wild when
he had the line to Europe working and had to send his New York
messages by vessel. But that's a small matter now. Cyrus
says&mdash;"</p>

<p>The church bell from the steeple above their heads drowned out
his words.</p>

<p>Henriette pressed Henry's arm in the din and tried to keep her
embroidered shawl in place. She had lost sight of the old minister,
but she saw him presently moving alone across the green grass. She
knew why he was hurrying away from the ringing bells and the crowd
of rejoicing neighbours. She knew where he was going even before
she saw him cross the village street and pass through the gates of
the burying-ground.</p>

<p>"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace," she
thought as she watched that spare figure in Sunday black go its
solitary way. "'For mine eyes have seen the glory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where's Father?" Henry was asking.</p>

<p>"I know where he is," she said, pointing across the road. "No,
Henri, wait. Give him a few minutes there before you bring him
back."</p>

<p>It was late that night before she and Henry were alone again.
They could hardly speak for their weariness after the hours of
rejoicing. Message had followed message, and friends had flocked
from every direction as the news spread. Their ears still tingled
with the ringing of bells; the smoke of a huge bonfire still hung
in the air though the valley was dark and quiet at last.</p>

<p>"It's true this time," Henry said as they turned out the light.
"Cyrus has changed the present and the future. He'll go down in
history the way they're all saying. What a day to remember!"</p>

<p>"What a day!" she echoed. "And your father has lived to see
it."</p>

<p>"Yes. I shall never forget his face, when he heard that his son
had joined two worlds."</p>

<p>"He has other sons, too," she reminded him. "David's a great
lawyer, and Stephen sits in the Supreme Court; and you, my Henri,
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he cut her short.</p>

<h3>Chapter Forty-Four</h3>

<p>Only now when she was a woman in her fifties did Henriette
understand fully the truth of a saying she had heard in her
childhood. "Rue and thyme both grow in one garden." Cassie
Sampson's shrewd reminder to "take the bitter with the sweet" also
came back with a personal ring in those months that immediately
followed the cable's success. At first it had been thrilling to be
included in the celebration; to be a part, though vicariously so,
of such fame. But long before the return to New York she felt
irritated by the avalanche of acclaim; revolted by the exhibitions
of bad taste and unabashed emotionalism that had been given free
rein.</p>

<p>America, with characteristic fervour and an unbridled talent for
enthusiasm, completely lost all sense over the new marvel of the
age. The nation rocked at such sensational achievement and promptly
took Cyrus to its heart. He was the darling of the gods, the hero
of the hour; and no praise could be too extravagant to do him
honour. The fact that his own country had been sceptical of his
Atlantic Telegraph of late years, only made the demonstration more
violent. Great Britain and her capitalists had shown greater belief
in the enterprise, had risked more in giving it financial support;
and this knowledge rankled a little in Yankee hearts. They must vie
with the old country in their appreciation. An American had been
the promoter of the undertaking. Now that it had succeeded that was
enough for his countrymen.</p>

<p>Parades and processions, bonfires and bells went into action
from Maine to the Golden Gate. The South was distracted momentarily
from bankrupt bitterness; the prairie states of the Middle West
responded in lusty ardour. Superlatives gathered momentum as they
sped. It was as if the entire country became another P. T. Barnum,
hailing its hero as the greatest man on earth. Cyrus W. Field had
become a name to conjure with, synonymous with glory and renown. He
was "the Columbus of his time." "Our Field is the Field of the
World," they said of him, and "The Old Cyrus and the New. One
conquered the world for himself, the other the ocean for the
world." Rhymes flourished:</p>

<blockquote>Let nations' shouts, 'midst cannons roar,<br>
Proclaim the event from shore to shore.</blockquote>

<p>Poetical pens were dipped into the ink of jubilation. John
Greenleaf Whittier was not above composing a "Cable Hymn," slightly
more restrained and dignified than the jingle revived from an
earlier <i>Harper's Weekly</i> of 1858:</p>

<blockquote>Bold Cyrus Field, he said, says he,<br>
"I have a pretty notion<br>
That I can run a telegraph<br>
Across the Atlantic Ocean."</blockquote>

<p>From platforms and backwoods schoolhouses the stanzas were
rendered with appropriate emphasis:</p>

<blockquote>And may we honour evermore<br>
The manly, bold and stable,<br>
And tell our sons, to make them brave,<br>
How Cyrus laid the cable.</blockquote>

<p>By October Henriette felt that the subject, even though it
warranted the highest possible praise, had been thoroughly
exhausted, She grew weary of such harping upon a difficult task
achieved. Even Henry found it a little trying to be bombarded with
questions and requests for anecdotes of his distinguished brother,
to be introduced wherever he went as "the brother of the Atlantic
Cable promoter." He was too generous and admiring to begrudge the
world-wide acclaim that had come to Cyrus. But neither he nor the
other brothers had realised the proportions it would assume. It had
never occurred to them that this would effectively dwarf their own
lives and achievements.</p>

<p>"One would think," Henriette had remarked to her husband in
private, "that there had been only one Field since the creation of
the world. Almost," she had added with spirit, "one would think, to
hear people talk, that Cyrus had created two worlds as well as
joining them!"</p>

<p>Henry had reproved her, but more gently than he might have done
several months before.</p>

<p>"Cyrus isn't to blame because people have lost their heads," he
reminded her. "He said yesterday that if he had to hear another
recitation of 'How Cyrus Laid the Cable' he wouldn't answer for the
consequences."</p>

<p>"He likes it, nevertheless," she had insisted. Then she admitted
honestly: "It would not be in human nature not to respond to the
honours, even though one may tire of the banalities. No, I am not
holding him responsible for those who make fools of themselves. I
cannot but remember in the old days how they said Cyrus would hang
himself with his own cable; and now it seems to me it will be the
death of us all."</p>

<p>Her endurance had begun to wear thin under the added strain of
Cyrus's return from England. In August he had headed another
expedition to raise and repair the earlier cable. Now that this had
been accomplished and two ocean telegraph lines were in operation,
an orgy of f&ecirc;ting and feasting began. It irritated her that
Henry should so often be an unofficial spokesman at these
functions, whether or not he was invited to attend. Henry could
never say no to any family call for help, and Cyrus could not keep
up with the demand for appropriate responses to toasts and
after-dinner speeches. So Henry continually laid aside his own work
to concoct these for his brother. The sight of them reprinted in
newspapers all over the country next day was particularly trying to
Henriette.</p>

<p>"Cyrus wants me to give him a few notes for a speech next week,"
Henry would apologise as he went to his desk after a long day of
editing. "He stopped in at my office on his way to Washington on
company business."</p>

<p>"But, Henri, you have scarcely had a free evening in a
fortnight, and if you must work so late, there is your own
manuscript to finish. You know Mr. Scribner is holding the presses
in readiness."</p>

<p>"I know." Henry sighed. "He spoke to me about it again
yesterday. He says the demand for my <i>History of the Atlantic
Telegraph</i> is urgent."</p>

<p>"Certainly, and with all the material you have been gathering
you could have finished it last month except for these
interruptions,"</p>

<p>"Well, but, Henriette, I can't refuse to help Cyrus out when
he's so pressed with business matters."</p>

<p>"You have spent years on this history already, and as Mr.
Scribner told you delays now will affect your returns. You have put
your time and your skill into the cable as well as those who
invested their money in it. You have a right to your small share of
the returns."</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted, "but without Cyrus there'd be no profit for
any one. He must give all his attention to these matters of
reorganisation now that the different cable companies are to be
consolidated. There's friction between the English and American
backers, and he's the only one who can straighten that out and
start dividends paying."</p>

<p>"Please, Henri, make haste with your book and let the speeches
go."</p>

<p>But she knew her words were wasted. Those brothers, though they
might disagree, though they might even know the pangs of envy,
would always come to one another's aid. In legal matters connected
with the cable David Dudley was well versed, but only Henry had the
incidents of each attempt, the letters, the documents, the most
minute newspaper item concerning its accomplishment, at his
fingertips. Cyrus could trust him down to the smallest detail.</p>

<p>"Ah, well." She watched him spreading out his notes and papers.
"You will be working late. I can see that, and when you read the
words you have prepared it will not matter to you that your name is
not signed to them. No, do not begin to explain to me again that
you must devote your evening to what profits you nothing. I
suppose"&mdash;she bent and kissed him as she turned to
leave&mdash;"I suppose I should not be your wife to stand here and
scold you for it, if you had been made otherwise."</p>

<p>No, she could not always master the resentment she felt in that
aftermath of cable furore. Henry was too much of a person; he had
accomplished too much in his own right to be dismissed merely as
"Cyrus Field's brother." There were times when she could not keep
her annoyance to herself.</p>

<p>There was, for instance, the occasion when she had been forced
to attend a large reception without Henry. She had hoped to the
last moment that he would go with her. But no, she had left him at
his desk with another assignment to be finished before morning. The
evening was spoiled for her from the start, and though the guests
were particularly congenial and there were visitors from Europe she
had wished to meet, she took little pleasure in the occasion and
prepared to leave early. It had been unfortunate that she
encountered Cyrus's wife at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"And is not dear Henry here to-night?" she had asked as they
greeted one another.</p>

<p>"No." Henriette had been powerless to keep back the crisp reply
though she had not expected it to carry quite so distinctly in a
sudden lull in the conversation. "No, dear Henri is at home writing
the speech for dear Cyrus to give at to-morrow's banquet!"</p>

<p>She had felt no contrition at the time. She even relished her
little sally when she confessed it to Henry on her return. But when
her words went the rounds of New York and Brooklyn she wished she
had been less outspoken.</p>

<p>"But, Henri, our sister-in-law asked for the truth," she
protested, "and it was indeed the truth that I gave her. There,
forgive me for being so hasty. If you will only copy the last
chapters of your book I promise to keep my tongue under lock and
key!"</p>

<p>The house on East Eighteenth Street with all its associations of
their first years in New York had passed to other tenants. That
winter they took temporary quarters in the Fifth Avenue Hotel,
since Henriette was to accompany a party of friends to Europe in
the spring of 1867. She had been reluctant to go without Henry, but
it was impossible for him to leave America. The task of editorship
had grown heavier, and his father's health was too precarious for
him to be so far away. But he urged her to visit France again and
at the time of the great Paris Exposition. It was nearly nine years
since their last trip abroad. Already other links in the
friendships that held her to the past were broken.
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod would not be there to welcome her. He
had been dead for over three years now. But his family begged her
to come to them once more. Henry had set his heart upon her going
now that his <i>History of the Atlantic Telegraph</i> was in print
at last and bringing in fair returns.</p>

<p>"Adieu, my little Henri." She clung to him as the gong of the
<i>P&eacute;reire</i> sounded the warning for visitors to leave the
ship. "Now that the moment has come, I could find it in my heart to
wish to stay with you on this side of the Atlantic."</p>

<p>"You will find it in your heart to go," he told her, "and be
happy in all that you see and do in France and England."</p>

<p>He was gone, leaving her alone in the stateroom he had been so
happy in providing for her. It was still winter outside. The Hudson
was filled with floating ice as the <i>P&eacute;reire</i> moved out
to sea. But the morning was clear and fine, the shores and all the
shipping glittered in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Cher Henri". It seemed impossible that she should be writing
him from Paris, only twelve days later, but so it was. And at that,
the ship had been delayed by a terrible storm that threatened to
send them all to the bottom of the Atlantic to join the cable. She
was safe and had wished for him beside her on that trip from Brest
through the ancient, beautiful province of Brittany that once had
been as large as his own beloved state of Massachusetts. They had
reached Paris comfortably. How inadequate words were, she thought
as her pen hurried on, flying across the paper to Henry in New
York:</p>

<p>"As we arrived by the left bank of the Seine, our course lay
through the Faubourg-Saint-Germain, where every street, every
house, was familiar. Nothing was changed. As we rode along, I
recognised every spot, and was in a constant reverie, until the
carriage drove into the courtyard of the Grand Hotel...I have a
charming little room on the second floor, looking out on the new
opera house which is in the process of construction. Here for the
first few hours I give myself up to my thoughts. My heart is too
full to go among strangers, or even to go among friends. This is my
native city, and is dear to me by a thousand associations...And now
as I sit at my window and look into the street at this evening hour
so many forms go floating by in the twilight; memories, sweet, sad
and tender, come back upon me&mdash;memories that I shall cherish
to the last hour of my life..."</p>

<p>Yes, it was good to be back. She laid down her pen and leaned
her cheek on the window-frame. Good to be back in the most
beautiful city she knew. Yet&mdash;what hour was it now in New
York? Was Henry just boarding an omnibus to bring him home from his
office? Was Clara happy at school in Massachusetts? And did they
both miss her as she was missing them? In two, no, perhaps not two,
but surely in four days she could hope for mail from America.</p>

<p>"The Americans, like summer birds," she was writing in her next
letter, "have been flying southwards, to sun themselves during the
winter months on the shores of the Mediterranean. It is said that
there are eight hundred at Nice alone! Our countrymen swarm also in
every city of the peninsula. Of course they will all flock to Rome
for Holy Week, and then return slowly northwards over the Alps,
winding up at Paris for the Exposition. Such was the programme of
my friends who left last week and who pressed me to go with them.
But that would have taken me still farther from home. It is not
merely the added distance but that when travelling you are almost
as a soldier would say 'cut off from communications.' Letters
follow you about from city to city, perhaps not to find you after
all."</p>

<p>Friends, she added, were constantly calling to see her. She had
attended the last reception at the American Embassy. General Dix,
the new minister, was making a most favourable impression. He
seemed admirably fitted for the post. She had enjoyed the evening
and had been surprised to find so many acquaintances from New York
in Paris. Professor Morse and his family were there, but she had
just missed Mr. Bryant, who had left for Spain.</p>

<p>Everywhere one met Americans&mdash;in caf&eacute;s and hotels,
in the Louvre, at the theatre, and if one stepped into a shop. "Our
young countrywomen flit about here and there," she wrote, "like
humming birds, in search of pleasure, shopping extravagantly by
day; glittering at balls and operas and theatres by night."</p>

<p>At every turn the changes in the city amazed and delighted her.
It had grown in size and beauty since their visit nine years
before. Now that the rains were over, the sun brought all Paris out
of doors. How she had longed for him yesterday afternoon when she
had driven to the Bois de Boulogne! "All the chairs on the
sidewalks along the Champs Elys&eacute;e were filled; all the
carriages were open, and instead of the riders being wrapped in
shawls and cloaks, parasols were raised to protect them from the
sun." The emperor and empress and the young prince had been taking
advantage of the fine weather. She and her friends had a clear view
of the imperial carriage.</p>

<p>"The emperor looks older; he has grown stout and has a duller,
heavier look. Cares of state have visibly worn upon him; but he has
the same impassable, emotionless countenance. Time has not spared
even the empress&mdash;though still beautiful, she is no longer
young. At one moment our carriages almost touched, and we were
staring royalty in the face. I know some people think kings and
queens are like public monuments, set up only to be looked at, yet
I cannot but feel the rudeness of staring at anybody, king or
commoner. But for an instant curiosity prevailed and I could not
help gazing at one I had seen years before in the dazzling beauty
of her youth. No one could mistake that face; the high arched brows
giving it a peculiar expression."</p>

<p>The empress had bowed pleasantly to their little party. She
showed great tact and grace which she was obviously exerting to the
utmost, hoping to charm away the opposition to her husband's rule.
The pair were not so popular as they had been. There had been
little cheering from the crowd that waited to see their majesties
pass&mdash;evidently more of curiosity than of enthusiasm in the
response.</p>

<p>Driving back along the boulevards just at evening, she had been
overcome by the magic of Paris: the softly budding trees, the dim
outlines of familiar buildings and bridges, the lighted
caf&eacute;s and the throngs sitting before them. "Thousands of
people," she told Henry, "all <i>jabbering,</i> as you used to say,
and only as Frenchmen can!"</p>

<p>She dispatched sheets of finely written notepaper to him telling
of the extraordinary impression that the preaching of P&egrave;re
Hyacinthe had made upon her&mdash;P&egrave;re Hyacinthe, whose
challenge to Paris to shake off its apathy and turn once more to
the true religion of the spirit had reached across the Atlantic.
She knew how Henry longed to hear this man, and so she had waited
for hours in Notre Dame with a congregation that overflowed even
that vast cathedral. He had come at last in the long brown robes of
the Carmelite Order, with sandals on his bare feet and a white cowl
thrown back from his strong pale face. Mounting the steps of the
pulpit, he had knelt in prayer. Then he had risen, erect and
majestic. With the light falling full upon his shorn head, he had
for some moments regarded in silence those gathered to hear
him.</p>

<p>It was the Lenten Season. He had announced his text from
Ecclesiastes, first in Latin, then in French: "Agonise for your
faith; combat for your soul." He had begun to preach, and as she
had fallen under the spell of his words she had almost believed
that she was listening to Savonarola thundering against the vices
of the age. "Merely to repeat his arguments and illustrations," she
wrote Henry, "could give you no impression of his power, for it lay
in the man, in his eye, his gestures, and his voice. In true
eloquence there is something which escapes analysis, a power beyond
words, a magnetism which penetrates like lightning, which cannot be
described."</p>

<p>It was no retiring, fleshless ascetic who spoke to Notre Dame
that Sunday. Henriette felt certain of that. In the brilliant,
powerful man whose words had flowed out in tender or fiery
torrents, she detected a struggle. The senses and the spirit
wrestled for mastery. He belonged to the world, though he had
deliberately put its pleasures aside. He belonged, she had decided,
to that heroic company of the old confessors and defenders of the
faith. Yet, no less than Henry Ward Beecher crowding Plymouth
Church to the rafters, P&egrave;re Hyacinthe possessed that
inexplicable gift of holding his audience in the hollow of his
hands.</p>

<p>Of the great Exposition Universelle she hardly dared to write.
Her pen failed her in recounting its marvels, and many of the
buildings and exhibits had not yet been completed. What would the
city be like, she wondered, with the added magnificence of its full
illumination glowing through the dark like those fabulous jewels of
Aladdin's Cave? Already on the boulevards one saw representatives
of all nations who had come to bring their treasures and pay their
respects to the Second Empire. It was amusing to pass prosperous
Turks in incongruous fezzes; to see grave, small Orientals peering
in shop windows; to watch swift-stepping Arabs in their flowing
white robes, and turbaned princes from India. Blue-eyed Norsemen
and bearded Russians mingled with uniformed officers of Prussia and
Italy, of Austria, Greece and the British Isles. It pleased her to
hear so many different tongues, and yet&mdash;what were these men
saying of one another as they passed? Peace should be the keynote
to the Exposition of 1867, yet she could not feel that peace was in
the air.</p>

<p>"One feels little permanence," she mourned in her last note from
Paris, "in all this lavish display of art and science and the
cunning of men's minds. To me it suggests rather some exquisite
replica of a castle fashioned by children from shells and sand. In
the night it will all be levelled and lost. Perhaps it is because I
have lived through the passing of another reign, top-heavy with
magnificence and sham, that I can detect the almost invisible signs
of change about me. I feel a queer presentiment that the end of an
era is in sight. For one thing, the army is much more in evidence
than on our earlier visit. Martial music and military atmosphere
chill me when I think of our own years of war so recently ended.
They say that all this is to impress the Prussians and their
Chancellor Bismarck, who will attend the Exposition in person, it
is rumoured. But the blue blouses of busy workmen and the contented
faces of shopkeepers and their families would be far more
impressive to me if I were gauging the strength of a country.</p>

<p>"Cher Henri, this will be my last letter from Paris. In the
morning we leave for Calais, then Dover and our stay in London. I
can scarcely believe that so soon I shall see my little English
pupil Nina and her tall sons, and perhaps even be privileged to
meet the author of <i>Adam Bede</i>."</p>

<p>And then she was writing him of that very happening. She had
been invited to the house near Regent's Park.</p>

<p>"Come sit by me on this sofa," George Eliot had beckoned warmly
to the visitor from America who had dared to disregard public
prejudice and exchange letters through years of social
ostracism.</p>

<p>Henriette had marvelled that the massive head with its rich
auburn hair should belong to one of such ordinary proportions. It
was impossible to feel a stranger as they talked intimately
together. All distance seemed instantly removed between them. "To
me her welcome was the more grateful as that of one woman to
another. There is," she had added, "a sort of free-masonry among
women by which they understand at once those with whom they have
any intellectual sympathy. A few words, and all reserve was gone.
Can you imagine what it was to sit at her side for an hour&mdash;to
talk and to listen to that voice, so low and soft that one must
almost bend to hear?"</p>

<p>And London, and the English countryside in April! She had
forgotten that wonder, it was so many years since she had seen it
unfold sheath upon sheath of vivid green. She could not resist the
flower-sellers who held out golden daffodils and nosegays of
forget-me-nots, violets and pale primroses wherever she went.</p>

<p>"I stood at my hotel window overlooking Green Park where nurses
and children were out in the sun, when your cablegram was put into
my hands. Oh, Henri, how strange that this first message you have
sent me by the wires which Cyrus gave ten years of his life to lay,
should have been the word of your father's death! Do you remember
long ago how you and Matthew reproved me for thinking first of the
bad news that might travel across the Atlantic as well as of the
good? Almost I think I must have known how it would be.</p>

<p>"And so your father will not be there when I return to
Stockbridge. I shall miss him, for he had grown dear to me. I am
filled with thankfulness that he lived to see his children prosper;
that it was given him to know and share in Cyrus's achievement. He
rejoiced in his sons' accomplishments, but he took no glory to
himself. 'My sons are all good men,' he told me once. That was as
near as I ever heard him come to uttering pride.</p>

<p>"It is difficult for me to be so far away from you at this time.
But I have taken passage on the next ship for America. Like the
birds, I shall hasten back, and I shall reach you before the
American spring is passed and the Stockbridge dandelions have gone
to seed. Do you think our lilac bushes will bloom for us this year?
Already you see that my heart has crossed the Atlantic."</p>

<h3>Chapter Forty-Five</h3>

<p>"Good-bye," Henry and Clara called as the carriage rolled out of
the Stockbridge driveway. Henriette waved back, but she did not
rise from the sofa by the open french windows. Her eyes followed
the two figures on the seat with affection&mdash;the young woman's
in light muslin, the man's that had settled into lines of middle
age.</p>

<p>"My little Henri," she thought. "The years do not change him
greatly. They may take his hair a little and put a few lines in his
face, but he will never look old. He will never be old, whatever
his age."</p>

<p>Yet he had passed his fifty-second birthday that spring of 1874.
It was August now. The hills across the valley were hazy with heat;
the Housatonic was hidden by dense green except where it flowed
through the meadows beyond the church in lazy, glittering loops.
The air felt soft and deliciously warm. She drew in summer with
every breath. The fragrance of her own particular flower-bed of
mignonette, heliotrope and lemon verbena came from below the
windows.</p>

<p>"Lemon verbena." She smiled to herself as she repeated that name
which had seemed so much less lovely than vervain when she had
first tried to say it. Now it came naturally, though there were
times when she and Clara gathered and dried those aromatic leaves
to lay among the linen, or when she picked a sprig and crushed it
between her fingers&mdash;moments when the past was stronger than
the present. Vervain meant Vaux Praslin to her. She found herself
recalling the old days more frequently of late. Perhaps it was
because of the sorry state of her native country crushed under the
disaster of the Franco-Prussian War and the fall of the Second
Empire. Perhaps it was only that she had more leisure now to
remember.</p>

<p>She had not been well that winter and spring. It had seemed an
effort to dress to go out to theatres and lectures and receptions,
even to friends' homes. Once she was there, however, the exchange
of talk, the magic of human communication revived her, as it was
sure to do on Sunday nights or whenever friends gathered about her
own table. But there were sudden seizures of pain and weakness,
headaches that came without warning.</p>

<p>"No, <i>ch&eacute;rie,</i> it is nothing," she would reassure
her niece. "It will pass, but perhaps we had best take a carriage
home. The omnibuses look crowded, and it seems to me that they jolt
more than they used to do."</p>

<p>She could afford to drive now, though she resented the
necessity. Henry had hired the horse and carriage for her special
benefit that summer, and Clara liked nothing better than to drive
her over the familiar Berkshire roads. But she preferred the cool
parlour or a wicker chair on the veranda. To-day they had been
disappointed that she had not gone with them to take tea in the
village and then to meet the train which was bringing guests from
New York. But there had been a reason why she wished them to go
without her. She glanced at the clock and saw that the hands
pointed to four. The doctor would be arriving any moment now. She
had asked him not to come before that time.</p>

<p>"Asleep, Mrs. Field?"</p>

<p>She roused herself at his friendly voice.</p>

<p>"No, I was resting only," she told him. "It has been so warm
to-day. If you sit there between the windows you will catch
whatever breeze there is. You did not meet Henri and Clara on your
way here? Good. I do not wish them to know that I sent for
you."</p>

<p>She saw that he was studying her with professional intentness as
he listened.</p>

<p>"Our doctor in New York did not wish to alarm me," she was going
on. "But he told me to be wary of certain signs. He hoped that
these would not recur; but I must tell you that they have. Lately I
have felt more discomfort, and the pain&mdash;here&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laid her hand lightly on the folds of her dimity
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>His hands were gentle, his questions more keen and direct in
their probing. He was a good friend and neighbour as well as a
skilful physician. She trusted him, and he knew it. That made the
half-hour more difficult for them both.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said when she had answered all his questions, "I can
see that you agree with the doctor in New York."</p>

<p>"You make it hard for me." He bent and fumbled in his bag. "Of
course we cannot say with certainty, and yet from what you tell
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand. There can be little doubt," she prompted him
"That is why I asked you to come when my husband and my niece would
not be here. They must not know&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"I think it would be wise for me to talk to Henry. In fact, if
any woman except yourself had asked me for an opinion I should have
tried to put her off."</p>

<p>"You could never have deceived me. I know these signals of pain.
I am not fool enough to believe that my body is invulnerable. How
long do you think I have to live?"</p>

<p>She waited quietly as she had waited years ago for another
verdict. His eyes answered her first with a plea that she would not
press him; but when he saw that she meant to repeat the question he
spoke hesitantly.</p>

<p>"It's impossible to say. Every case is different, and you are an
unusually vigorous, strong-willed woman. With care and drugs to
ease you it might be a year or even longer."</p>

<p>"I see." There was another pause before she went on. "Now, let
us be practical. We know the truth, you and I. That is enough for
the present. I should like Henri and Clara to have their summer
without sadness. These drugs you mention will help?"</p>

<p>Again his face showed the doubts he felt. Once more he protested
the ethics of his profession.</p>

<p>"But you have yourself said that every case is different," she
reminded him. "Make this exception for me. Henri and I have been
married for twenty-three years. You must believe that I know what
is best for us. Let me be the one to tell him."</p>

<p>After he was gone she lay without moving, and her body felt so
light and at ease that it seemed she and the doctor must have been
discussing someone else. There was no reality to pain when it left
one, though while it held one fast all other realities faded.</p>

<p>The clock struck five, and she rose at the sound. She moved
about the room, straightening the sofa cushions, putting books on
the shelves and turning the bowl of roses so that the sun from the
western windows would light their petals. In the mirror above the
mantel the green lawn outside and her favourite clump of white
birch trees were reflected as she delighted to see them. When every
chair was in its accustomed place and each ornament where it should
be, she stood back and surveyed the room. From being merely
familiar objects, they had suddenly become animate, bound up as
they were with all the essential intimacies of life. She and Henry
loved these possessions that had accumulated with their years
together. What was it he had said to her only day before yesterday
about the house and this very room?</p>

<p>"All this, and heaven too!" The words had arrested her at the
time, and they came back to her now with new poignancy "All this,"
she repeated as her eyes went round the room and its furnishings
once more, and on through the open windows to vistas of sun and
green shade. No, she could not go on with the phrase. It had
suddenly come to have too literal a meaning.</p>

<p>She went upstairs and exchanged her dressing-gown for the
embroidered mull with lilac bands at the neck and sleeves and
waist. Her reflection in the mirror reassured her. There was
scarcely a trace of grey in her hair; her throat was still full,
her forehead showed surprisingly few lines. She did not look her
sixty-two years.</p>

<p>Once more she went downstairs. Through the hall to the veranda
and on down the drive she moved. Then she crossed the road. No one
was in sight. She had the hillside and all the outspread valley for
her own. Clover and daisies were past, but Queen Anne's lace rose
tall about her skirts as she took the rough path down the sloping
field. She stooped and picked one of the frothy flowers,
scrutinising it as if she were about to put its shape on paper. She
could scarcely bear the complexity of that frail pattern, each
minute tip of bloom adding its whiteness to the perfect whole her
hands held. And that single jewel of garnet in the centre! It
seemed to her that she had never really looked at Queen Anne's lace
until that moment.</p>

<p>"Ah," she thought, "if I had died without truly seeing it!"</p>

<p>Henry's rock was warm in the sun. She sank down in one of its
worn hollows, grateful for the enduring stone. The maple tree in
the cleft had been struck by lightning one year, but new shoots
were flourishing about the shattered trunk. Their leaves gave her
shade from the glare.</p>

<p>"Nearly a quarter of a century," she reminded herself', "since
we sat here together that day."</p>

<p>How long a quarter of a century seemed when one thought of it;
how brief it actually was when one lived it! She had been half
afraid to trust herself to love that other summer afternoon. Yet it
had not betrayed her. Many things had been difficult in the years
she and Henry had shared, but love had been easy always. Still, she
had never taken it for granted. She was as incredulous of the
miracle now as she had been then.</p>

<p>Down in the valley a far whistle sounded. That would be the
train bringing mail from the city, and their guests. She could
linger only a few more minutes on the warm stone. It was the time
of day she loved best, when the hills retreated in the late light.
Who could have guessed that this scene of all those she had known
and loved would have come to be the most dear, the most
familiar?</p>

<p>Yes, she had survived her transplanting even as
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod had predicted. If only she might have
been fruitful also. But perhaps it was enough that the plant had
taken root in alien soil without bearing seed. She took comfort in
that as she climbed the rise of land that had never seemed steep to
her before that summer.</p>

<p>Her breath was short as she reached the house. She was thankful
to have gained the veranda before Henry's return. He must not see
how quickly she tired.</p>

<p>Now the carriage was turning into the drive. She could see Henry
pointing out the view and the trees and the house to their guests.
She caught the tones of his voice and smiled fondly at the pride
and happiness he could never manage to keep out of it on such
occasions. For a moment she lingered where she had paused to regain
her breath. Then as the hoofs and wheels crunched nearer on the
gravel she felt herself responding to the summons of hospitality.
Words rushed warm to her lips as she went forward with her
welcome.</p>
