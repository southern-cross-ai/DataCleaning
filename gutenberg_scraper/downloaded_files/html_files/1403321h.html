<hr><h2><a name="ch0"></a>THE TRAVELLER'S CONFESSION</h2>

<p>It has been the boast of some travel books to contain nothing
that can either instruct or improve their readers. The boast is one
I should like to make; for a book that entertains by its art alone
will always be more welcome than one that forces attention upon its
learning or righteousness. Of these qualities, it is true, the
following pages are innocent enough. But the motives that prompted
the journeys they describe were not so innocent. I have travelled,
I must confess, in search of both instruction and improvement. As
member of a community, and heir to a culture, whose joint worth is
now in dispute, I would discover what ideas, if those of the West
be inadequate, can with greater advantage be found to guide the
world. And to this end I would also know, in the language of my own
senses, in whom and what the world consists. These vast
considerations, let me hasten to add, find small place in the
present volume. But they are responsible for its general attitude,
since it is only from the sum of isolated journeys that even the
shadow of an answer to them can ever be expected.</p>

<p>A conception of the whole world in terms of personal knowledge
is held by contemporary opinion to be not only impossible as an
attainment, but contemptible as a goal. Real knowledge, according
to this view, is the prerogative of the specialist, and is
contained, as it were, in cells to which he alone has access. A
specialist has been defined as 'one who grows to know more and more
about less and less'; as the cells multiply, the scope of each
diminishes and the truth contained in it shrinks correspondingly.
To suggest that real knowledge must come from a study not of this
or that particular cell, but of the relationship between them all,
is to invite ridicule and hostility. For the bureaucracy of the
mind, like that of the State, is jealous of those who would
scrutinize the harmony of its departments. Yet for some persons
there exists an organic harmony between all matter and all
activity, whose discovery is the purpose of their lives and whose
evidence, being inexhaustible, can only be selected by the good
judgement and perpetual curiosity of the individual. From this
process derives that most invaluable of human resources, an
absolute standard of worth capable of unlimited extension.</p>

<p>These persons are the travelling species. The <i>pleasures</i>
of travel need no reiteration. But when the impulse is so imperious
that it amounts to a spiritual necessity, then travel must rank
with the more serious forms of endeavour. Admittedly there are
other ways of making the world's acquaintance. But the traveller is
a slave to his senses; his grasp of a fact can only be complete
when reinforced by sensory evidence; he can know the world, in
fact, only when he sees, hears, and smells it. Hence that craving
for personal reconnaissance which can only be lulled by
acquaintance with the broad compartments of race, politics, and
geography that comprise our earth. From the specialist's point of
view such acquaintance must always be superficial. The traveller
can only reply that at least he desires to know more and more about
more and more.</p>

<p>This book presents two excursions whose very diversity is
symbolic of those formidable contradictions which make it a
privilege and a puzzle to be alive in the twentieth century. The
first part is concerned with Russia, where the moral influence of
the Industrial Revolution has found its grim apotheosis; the second
with Tibet, the only country on earth where that influence is yet
unknown, where even the cart is forbidden to traverse plains
flatter than Daytona Beach, and the Dalai Lama himself rides in a
man-borne palanquin. Prior to the Industrial Revolution each
country had evolved a unique tradition of civilization. In Russia
the tradition has succumbed completely to the virus of the machine.
In Tibet it has remained as completely immune from it. Among
nations which enjoy such traditions, the two countries represent
the extremes of political, social, and mental difference from the
accepted mean. These extremes are confirmed even by their
appearance. Russia is lower and more colourless, Tibet higher and
more coloured, than any country on earth. Such confirmation is more
than a coincidence. It is an explanation.</p>

<p>Extremes of this kind must provoke different reactions in the
same traveller. The ideas of Russia are preached, and act, as a
challenge to those of the West. The ideas of Tibet offer no
challenge; they maintain, simply, a passive resistance towards
those of the West. Thus in Russia one must think, argue, and
defend. In Tibet one need only observe and sympathize. Russia,
moreover, presents a sort of caricature of the West; art, politics,
and thought alike have derived from Europe and can only be
understood in terms of their European ancestry. Tibet has no
relation to the West whatsoever; the historical faculty becomes
superfluous; observation consists in the assimilation of pure
novelty. These differences are reflected in the form of my book.
The contrast between its two parts is more than one of subjects; it
lies between different states of the traveller's mind. If the book
has a unity, it must be looked for in this contrast. And also,
perhaps, in one other thing. I have written throughout, I hope,
with respect for the aspirations and convictions of my fellow-men,
even when I cannot share them.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch1"></a>PART I. RUSSIA</h2>

<hr>

<p>'Tell me, sir, how shall the mind be elevated if the body be
exhausted with material preoccupation? Consider the complex
conditions under which a Northern family is obliged to live. Think
of the labour expended upon that unceasing duel with the
elements&mdash;the extra clothing and footwear and mufflers and
mantles, the carpets, the rugs, the abundant and costly food
required to keep the body in sound working condition, the plumbing,
the gas, the woodwork, the paintings and repaintings, the tons of
fuel, the lighting in winter, the contrivances against frost and
rain, the never-ending repairs to houses, the daily polishings and
dustings and scrubbings and those thousand other impediments to the
life of the spirit!...At close of day, your Northerner is pleased
with himself. He has survived; he has even prospered...He fancies
he has obtained the aim and object of existence. He is too dazed
with the struggle to perceive how incongruous his efforts have
been. What has he done? He has sacrificed himself on the altar of a
false ideal. He has not touched the fringe of a reasonable life. He
has performed certain social and political duties&mdash;he knows
nothing of duties towards himself. I am speaking of men from whom
better things might have been expected. As for the majority, the
crowd, the herd&mdash;they do not exist, neither here nor anywhere
else. They leave a purely physiological mark upon posterity; they
propagate the species and protect their offspring. So do foxes. It
is not enough for us.'</p>

<p>&mdash;NORMAN DOUGLAS</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-1"></a>I. THE NEW JERUSALEM</h3>

<p>The European visitor to Russia who values the inheritance of
European humanism finds himself regarded as a baneful reactionary
full of pontifical formulas which aim not only at the pursuit of
'objective truth', but at the immediate destruction of the Russian
State. In compensation he will derive&mdash;unless already infected
with prejudices of hate or enthusiasm&mdash;an exhilarating
stimulus to rational thought from this attitude towards himself, a
realization that his world's horizon has been suddenly extended
beyond all preconceivable expectations. He will discover, possibly
against his will, a preponderance of what he has been taught to
call obscurantism and tyranny which must necessarily outweigh the
best of social purposes. Nevertheless he will be obliged to admit
that so great an intellectual stimulus must itself contain the seed
of intrinsic good. The question is how to explain this
contradiction.</p>

<p>Let no one concern himself with this essay whose hope is for
information about Russia of a detached, scientific kind&mdash;a
mere observation of phenomena such as naturalists conduct in
tide-forsaken pools. The Bolsheviks are men, not animals. I meet
them as a man, not as a social zoologist. Since their every word is
spoken in defence of a dogma, so then let mine be. This must be a
personal account, a mobilization of personal feelings in defence of
the European tradition; an attempt to keep in view a more
scientific truth than that embraced by the records of the
field-naturalist, and to see Russia, not as reactionaries and
enthusiasts both see her, in ethical relation to the present, but
in cultural relation to the future. The forces at work are older
than the Revolution, and will long survive it. They are inherent in
the country and people, though hitherto partially concealed beneath
a Western veneer. Hence the shock of their emergence and the
universal curiosity as to their future part in history.</p>

<p>I cannot sufficiently emphasize the fact that the opinions here
expressed are entirely confined to those which formed of their own
volition in my own mind and which, in fact, did not take conscious
shape till I had returned to England and settled down to consider
the evidence I had collected. During a large part of my time in
Russia I enjoyed the hospitality of Sir Esmond Ovey, H.M.
Ambassador to the Soviet Government, and of Lady Ovey; I spent much
of my time with other members of the Embassy; and I naturally
sought the company of various Englishmen resident in Moscow. Of the
kindness they all showed me, and of the pains they were at to
promote my journeys and inquiries, I can only make this bare
acknowledgement. But I must affirm categorically that the colour of
the interpretation which I put on such facts as I gathered is
entirely my own. So indefinite had this interpretation remained
till the very end of my stay in Russia, that if one had asked me,
as the ship sailed out of Odessa, what colour it was, I could not
have answered him. This question was in fact put both in
Constantinople and London. I had no answer to make, and was
considered in consequence either a dullard or an equivocator.</p>

<p>The assurance of my address is the assurance of the ignorant. If
I claim a good enough eye and a sufficient experience of other
countries to have enabled me to appreciate the visual arts of
Russia, and to judge them by general standards, it is only to admit
my disadvantage in seeking to paint their present environment. For
my concern with laboratories, feats of engineering, and isolated
social experiments, is so faint as to be negative; and it is
chiefly these particular branches of Bolshevist activity which
arouse the enthusiasm of foreign visitors. In six weeks one must
choose one's field; I chose to avoid conditioned reflexes, Ford
lorries, and abortion clinics. Yet it needed no knowledge of
engineering to feel the romance of 'construction' at
Dnieperstroi&mdash;as I felt it before at Sukkur&mdash;nor the
uplift of an Astor to pay credit to some hyperborean Demeter for
the apple cheeks and fur-lined helmets of the children in the
streets. If, sometimes, a note of rancour sounds, blame it on that
immemorial Russian bureaucracy, which chose to regard me, rather in
spite of itself, as an undesirable character. This arose from my
irresponsibility in visiting Russia neither with an avowed purpose
nor as a conducted tourist. Nearly all foreigners buy their tours
beforehand, and are therefore obliged to keep to set routes. This
is not to say, as so many people infer, that the visitor is only
shown what the authorities want him to see. On the contrary, free
movement within Russia to-day&mdash;except in the Turcoman
republics, which are reserved for American
millionaires&mdash;entails fewer formalities than before the
Revolution. The advantage of the conducted tours is simply their
remarkable cheapness; and since they are, very conveniently,
'conducted', the tourist is naturally treated to the show-pieces of
the existing regime. But as these seemed to me, even by
anticipation, both extremely uninteresting and fundamentally
insignificant, I trusted to my own arrangements, and may here take
the opportunity of thanking those who helped me make them.
Travelling was consequently more difficult, but equally more
entertaining. Should any echo of the laughter provoked by my
journeys reach the ears of my Russian friends, they will be able to
ignore, or at the best pity, such irreverence. Levity is the music
that accompanies the European's whoring after false gods, gods
which, in fact&mdash;and all fact is Marxist&mdash;do not exist.
The orthodox Marxist, like the orthodox Christian, need only give
thanks that he is not as others, and leave them to stew in their
own delusions. Doubt is unbecoming to him, and susceptibility to
foreign opinion is tantamount to doubt.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The supreme moments of travel are born of beauty and strangeness
in equal parts: the first panders to the senses, the second to the
mind; and it is the rarity of this coincidence which makes the
rarity of these moments. Such a moment was mine, when, at the age
of three, I ventured on to a beach in Anglesey, and found a purple
scabious; such again, when I stood on the Jelep La and surveyed the
peaks of Tibet; and such once more, as I walked up the side of the
River Moskva late in the afternoon of my second day in Russia. The
Red Capital in winter is a silent place. Like black ghouls on the
soundless snow the Muscovites went their way, hatted in fur, lamb,
leather, and velvet, each with a great collar turned up against the
wind that sweeps down the river from the east. With bent heads they
hurried past, impervious to collision with one another, or myself,
as though desensitized by a decade of mass-living. Farther on, at
the corner by the bridge, stood a line of hackney sledges, whose
owners, the rearguard of capitalism, sat huddled in their
portentous blue coats. Other sledges of robuster build trailed by,
bearing piles of hay and boxes. When they came to the slope by the
bridge, they all began to go sideways, while their horses scrabbled
at the ice.</p>

<p>This, at last, was Red Russia; this horde of sable ghosts the
Bolshevists, the cynosure of an agitated world. It was more than
Russia, it was the capital of the Union, the very pulse of
proletarian dictatorship, the mission-house of Dialectical
Materialism. I looked across the river. Before me stood the inmost
sanctuary of all: the Kremlin.</p>

<p>A curious irony has dowered the creed of utilitarianism with
this edifice as the symbol of outward power. While collective man
sits within, the walls deny him and the domes laugh aloud.
Fantastic one has always known it to be from photographs. But the
reality embodies fantasy on an unearthly scale&mdash;a mile and a
half of weathered, rose-coloured brick in the form of a triangle
that rises uphill from its base along the river. These airy walls,
which in places attain a height of forty feet, are hedged with deep
crenellations, cloven and coped in white stone after the Venetian
fashion. Their impalpable tint and texture might suggest rather the
protection of some fabled kitchen-garden than the exigencies of
medieval assault. But from their mellow escarpments bursts a
succession of nineteen towers, arbitrarily placed, and exhibiting
such an accumulation of architectural improbability as might have
resulted had the Brobdingnagians, during a game of chess, suddenly
built a castle for Gulliver with the pieces. As my eye moved
westward, seven of these unbelievable structures marked the
half-mile prospective, itself slightly askew, of the base-wall. At
either end the angle-towers were taller than the rest, each a
cylinder finished with a machicolated balcony and surmounted by an
octagonal cone, a kind of dormered cracker-hat tapering skywards to
a bronze pennant. Between these two marched five squatter
towers&mdash;steep, rectangular cones of dark green tiles, broken
by a middle storey of the same rosy brick, but varying in height
and breadth. These five towers, though they vary in particular
dimensions, reflect a pattern introduced by the Tartars. Thus the
historian may distinguish a Sino-Byzantine fusion accomplished
under the aegis of Italian architects. Be that as it may&mdash;my
attention was elsewhere. For now, within the walls, rose a white
hill, as it were a long table covered with a cloth of snow, lifting
up to the winter sky the residences of those vanished potentates,
Tsar and God: to the west the two palaces, nineteenth-century
Russo-Venetian, cream-coloured against the presage of snow in the
sky; the little Italian palace of the fifteenth century, whose grey
stone fa&ccedil;ade of diamond rustications conceals the tiny
apartments of the early Tsars; and then the Cathedrals: that of the
Annunciation with nine onion-domes; that of the Dormition, where
the coronations took place, with five helm-shaped domes; and that
of the Archangel Michael, whose central bulb stands high above its
four smaller companions; nineteen domes in all, each finished with
a cross, most of them thinly gilt; and then, higher than all, the
massive belfry, crowned with a flat onion; yet still overtopped by
the ultimate cupola of the tower of Ivan Veliki, colossal in
solitude, the climax of this Caesaropapist fantasia. I looked down
to the river below me; I looked up to the sky; I looked to the
right and I looked to the left: horizontally and vertically, towers
and domes, spires, cones, onions, crenellations, filled the whole
view. It might have been the invention of Dante, arrived in a
Russian heaven.</p>

<p>And then as the lights came out and the snowflakes, long
imminent, began to wander down in front of them, the scene became
alive. As I reached the turn to the bridge, a company of soldiers
came marching up the opposite street; the Red Army! visible agent
of proletarian power and hardly less fantastic to my eyes than its
fortress over the river. In their grey serge dressing-gowns
swinging right down to the feet, and their grey serge helmets with
pointed Tartar crowns, they looked like so many goblins on an
infernal errand. Tramp! tramp! swung the grey serge skirts; but not
a footfall sounded. From the shoulders of each goblin slanted a
pair of skis, taller than the man himself, and ready to whisk him
down upon some country churchyard to prod the dead. As they wheeled
round to cross the bridge, they broke into a ringing chorus, taking
those earnest, melancholy parts which are associated with all
Russian singing. The theme of the words was doubtless
Revolutionary, and, if so, not ill-suited to the effect
achieved&mdash;as though the troops of ancient Russia were sallying
out to a Holy War. It was quite dark now; the snow falling fast.
Behind the chanting goblins the Kremlin rose aglow with
electricity, like some ghostly backcloth to the hurrying city,
tower upon tower, dome upon dome, piling up from the rose-red
ramparts and the snowy eminence within them, to the last gigantic
onion of Ivan Veliki, 450 feet above the black river.</p>

<p>I followed the soldiers, and, climbing a steep road parallel
with the east wall of the Kremlin, reached the Red Square. Half-way
across the expanse of floodlit snow a queue had formed, ant-like in
the distance, to see Lenin. The tomb was open.</p>

<p>I took my place next to a young Turcoman. His pale, aquiline
features, properly moulded and furnished with bones, were those of
an individual, and seemed companionable, despite the outlandish
fleece that crowned them, among these casual-bred Slavs. But for a
group of peasants clad in leather and shod with birch-bark, they
presented the usual characterless appearance of all urban
populations&mdash;the mass-man about to pay his Russian homage to
his new and Russian Christ.</p>

<p>A halt preceded our entry while they swept out the snow left by
the previous pilgrims. Then, two by two, the Turcoman with me, we
entered the bronze wicket in the low balustrade. Two sentries, with
fixed bayonets and sheepskin ruffs, stood on either side of the
door. The vestibule was blank, but for the Soviet
emblem&mdash;hammer and sickle on a globe supported by sheaves of
wheat&mdash;in silver relief on the grey stone. Turning to the
left, a flight of stairs and a subterranean corridor led us down to
the vault.</p>

<p>In the midst of this tall, dim interior, sheeted with sombre,
close-grained stones, the mummy lay on a tall pedestal sheltered by
an inverted cradle of plate-glass, and brightly lit. Below, in
pairs at either end, stood four sentries. We lengthened into single
file. Mounting a flight of steps, I took my view and, in virtue of
the atmosphere, paid my homage. Round the walls, I noticed, ran a
frieze of vitreous scarlet lightning.</p>

<p>Lenin must have been a very small man. He rests on a bed of
dun-coloured draperies, which engulf his legs with the tasteful
negligence of a modiste's window. His upper part wears a khaki
jacket buttoned at the neck. The finely modelled hands and features
are of waxen texture, like the petals of a magnolia flower. The
beard and moustache turn from straw-colour to brown, a fact which
caused Bernard Shaw more surprise (so he told me) than anything
else in his self-patented Russian Elysium. One might have said: A
nice little man, fond of his grandchildren, and given to pruning
his trees. I wondered whether a countenance so placid and benign
was not really made of wax. For rumour insists that the sewers of
the Kremlin recently overflowed into the shrine, to the detriment
of its keepsake. But when I got outside, I had not walked a hundred
yards before I met an old man with features, beard, and expression
exactly similar to those I had just examined. So that there need be
nothing inherently false about the present appearance of the
relic.</p>

<p>The Red Square was so called long before the Revolution, since
the Russian words for 'red' and 'beautiful' are the same. Still the
snow falls, each flake softly sparkling in the electric haze. At
the north end of the great white oblong rises the blood-coloured
bulk of the Historical Museum, a building in Ye Olde Russian style,
but now transformed into something fairy-like by the snow filigree
on its twin steeples and twisting rooflets. Along the Kremlin side
runs the same crenellated rose-red wall, interrupted by three
towers. That near the Museum, which carries a slender, cold green
spire, was blown up by Napoleon, but rebuilt according to the old
design after his departure. At the other end of the square, to the
south, stands the famous Spassky tower, a castle of brick
surmounted by Gothic pinnacles and finials of white stone, which
remind one of Wren's Tom Tower, and were actually built by an
Englishman, Christopher Holloway, in 1625. This bears a rich
octagonal steeple, decorated with gilt Mock-face. From the topmost
apex shines the emblem of the Tsars, a golden eagle, whose glinting
double heads act as a signpost to the stranger lost in the 'China
Town' opposite.</p>

<p>These two towers, with one other on the west side, are the chief
entrances to the Kremlin. Between them the wall is broken by a
blind tower of the rectangular double-cone type, above which
appears a flat dome of green copper, in the austere Greek style of
the later Catherine period. From this dome floats a plain red flag,
emblem no longer of the rowdy May Day farce in other capitals, but
invested with the dignity of its architectural surroundings.
Beneath the wall runs a series of low tribunes in grey-white
granite. These are interrupted, immediately below the tower, by
Lenin's tomb, which is backed by a screen of small black
fir-trees.</p>

<p>The tomb is squat and powerful, instepped like a Ziggurat, and
polished like a public-house. It is built of red Ukrainian granite
and black and grey Ukrainian labrador, which contains flecks of
iridescent blue like those on a butterfly's wing. The lantern is
surmounted by a monolith of red Karelian porphyry, 26&frac14; feet
in length and weighing 59 tons. The colour of the granite is not
our anaemic pink, but a deep rhubarb-red, slightly tinged with
ochre. This colour strikes a mean between the scarlet flag and the
pink walls, and fits the monument harmoniously upon its ancient
stage.</p>

<p>The architect of the mausoleum is Stchousev. His original
design, which stood for five years, was of wood. The present,
though similar in character, is stronger and more ruthless. It is
constructed&mdash;or gives the illusion of being
constructed&mdash;of superb blocks of stone, whose gigantic size is
reminiscent of the Inca walls. The form is gained partly by the use
of the three colours, black, grey, and red, as an instrument of
proportion, and partly by the irregular succession of steps on
which these colours are employed. But these steps, though
irregular, are far from haphazard. Their ratios, both of height and
width, are calculated with the utmost nicety, so as to increase the
effect of power and strength. The base of the monument is slightly
above the level of the Square, and is enclosed within a low
parapet, whose front corners are rounded, and whose rear corners
are finished with two small pavilions. This parapet, these
pavilions, as well as the long rows of tribunes which run parallel
with the Kremlin wall, are built of a greyish white granite, only
semi-polished, and having a very close and hard texture. Within the
parapet on either side of the entrance have been planted small
fir-trees, which, it must be hoped, will not be allowed to grow too
high.</p>

<p>Last of all, at the far end where the ground begins to slope
down to the river, rises the famous church of Basil
Blajenny&mdash;Basil the Blessed. Lying slightly below the general
level of the square, yet with no other buildings behind it, it
closes the panorama like some phantom ship ice-bound against the
skyline. Or in circus mood one might compare it with a giant's
coconut-shy, whose drab nuts have been replaced by sea-urchins,
leeks, pineapples, and peeled pomegranates at different
levels&mdash;multicoloured fruits, spiral, spiked and fluted, that
tempt Lenin's ghost to warm itself on cold nights by potting
snowballs at them. There are always a few nocturnal drunks about
the Red Square. Perhaps some staggering mystic, or a frozen cabman,
or a posse of GPU raiders, passing by in the small hours, have
already seen that all-familiar figure clambering wraithlike up its
mausoleum for one more shot at the embodied past. I can hardly be
sure that I myself, after a certain party at the Metropole, did not
discern one or two extra-human missiles hurtling through the air
towards that green pine-apple with the red scales...But the less of
this the better. When I emerged from inspecting Lenin's more solid
remains on this particular afternoon it was barely tea-time.
Suddenly the Spassky clock rang out the hour on the last of the
Moscow bells, whose deep melodious chimes never failed, so long as
I stayed in the town, to give me a little start of melancholy and
pleasure. And as the first clang echoed over the snow and along the
red walls, a black smoke of crows shot up into the sky, cawing and
croaking their contempt for that motionless anachronism, the Tsar's
eagle.</p>

<p>The vision was over. I had exchanged the experience of a moment
for a memory that will support me till I die. I shall never see
Moscow again as I saw it on that afternoon.<br>
<br></p>

<p>But beside the Moscow of dreams waited a Moscow not less
unique&mdash;that of men. I left the square by the side of the
Historical Museum, where the Iberian gateway used to stand, and,
crossing the Opera Square, came to the Hotel Metropole. Here I was
to deliver three precious lemons for the use of Albert Coates, who
was suffering from a carbuncle. I was also to meet a young English
communist named Morgan.</p>

<p>I expected a hatchet-faced consumptive. I perceived a Nordic
giant. Morgan was once a chauffeur, but having seen light in a
Russian film, had made his way to the land of promise and creative
outlet. As that land had seemed to him from a distance, so it had
continued to seem, despite loneliness, language difficulty, and
food shortage during the early months. I admired his courage in
having overcome such obstacles. He now worked with a band of
students drawn from thirty-seven nationalities, dividing his time
between Materialistic philosophy and the Moscow film studios, and
receiving a salary on which he lives.</p>

<p>I had brought him some parcels, which, being ignorant of their
contents, I had persuaded the customs officials at Negoreloje not
to open. He seemed to assume, therefore, that I, too, had found
light. Our conversation was, consequently, at cross-purposes. It
started with my asking the waiter for some vodka.</p>

<p>M.: We don't want any of that dope here.</p>

<p>R.B.: Sorry, but I can't live without alcohol.</p>

<p>M.: Oh, well, I suppose you'll grow up some time.</p>

<p>R.B.: I suppose so. But I'm beginning to doubt if I shall ever
grow up into a communist. (Morgan looked surprised.) Anyhow, I'm
not interested in politics. What I want to know is, not whether the
Five-Year Plan is going to succeed, or how many million peasants
will know the alphabet in ten years' time, but whether anything
<i>really</i> important, any advance in human thought or happiness,
is going to come of so much misery as the Russians have gone
through. I feel it will; but I can't see how it can, when you
substitute a banal ideology for the free exercise of the mind.
Soviet culture, for example&mdash;what and where is it?</p>

<p>M.: You're full up with the old ideas; you don't understand. Our
art must be a collective art, and we've got to produce an
intelligentsia that will think and create collectively. It was
different during the revolutionary period, when everyone was
<i>inspired.</i> The construction period, which we're settling down
to, is harder to express in art.</p>

<p>R.B.: You mean there isn't the same epic feeling of
excitement?</p>

<p>M.: That's right. The struggle goes on though, just the
same.</p>

<p>R.B. <i>(petulantly)</i>: I wish to God you'd tell me what you'
mean by this struggle you all talk about. Struggle with what? I
shouldn't have thought there was anyone left in Russia to struggle
with by now.</p>

<p>M.: Don't you understand that <i>everything's</i> a struggle. If
I put this glass of water on this table, the glass and the table
are at war&mdash;their actual contact is a struggle. It's the same
in social evolution. The workers can only build socialism by
struggling, by continuing the class war right through.</p>

<p>R.B.: So that when you've done away with classes, all you do is
to create new ones and make an aristocracy out of a few million
factory workers, who rule the country by oppressing, i.e.
struggling with the remaining majority. How anything creative, or
even interesting, can come from this obsession with class, I fail
to see. It's worse than England.</p>

<p>M.: There's not much you do see. Now look at Beethoven. Of
course we admit he was a genius. But you can see how the
class-struggle of the time comes out in his symphonies. Or Wagner.
When he had been exiled for revolutionary opinions, he wrote the
<i>Ring.</i> Then he became a good bourgeois again, and the result
was <i>Parsifal.</i></p>

<p>R.B. <i>(soothingly): Parsifal</i> is dreadful, I admit. I
suppose if I translate what you're trying to tell me into ordinary
language, all it means is that genius is the product of
environment. There's nothing very new in that. And may I ask
whether you think Newton could ever have thought out the law of
gravity in the environment of modern Russia?</p>

<p>M.: Of course he could have. Our laboratories here are better
equipped than any in Europe.</p>

<p>R.B.: I'm talking about thought, not experiment&mdash;something
that goes on in one person at a time. If you take all the great
periods of human invention, scientific or otherwise, you'll find
that people were free to think as they wished. There was an
atmosphere of disinterested inquiry. The nineteenth century in
England, for example&mdash;it produced Marx's <i>Capital</i> among
other things, and he says as much in the preface.[*] Or the
Renascence...</p>

<blockquote>[* 'The social statistics of Germany and the rest of
Continental Western Europe are, in comparison with those of
England, wretchedly compiled...We should be appalled at the state
of things at home, if, as in England, our governments and
parliaments appointed periodically commissions of inquiry into
economic conditions; if these commissions were armed with the same
plenary powers to get at the truth; if it was possible to find for
this purpose men as competent, as free from partisanship and
respect of persons, as are the English factory-inspectors, her
medical reporters on public health, her commissioners of inquiry
into the exploitation of women and children, into housing and
food...In England the progress of social disintegration is
palpable. When it has reached a certain point, it must react on the
Continent...For this reason, as well as others, I have given so
large a space in this volume to the history, the details, and the
results of English factory legislation. One nation can and should
learn from others.'&mdash;<i>Capital</i>, Preface to the first
edition, 1867.]</blockquote>

<p>M. <i>(incredulously):</i> The Renascence!! Coo! there you are.
The Renascence was simply a phase in the class-struggle, the
beginning of the capitalist age, when the merchants and the
bourgeoisie began to rise to power.</p>

<p>R.B. <i>(firmly):</i> My dear Morgan, you remind me of an
evangelical preacher, who's right before God, when everyone else is
wrong. I don't mind being wrong. But I haven't come all the way to
Russia to argue with people like St Athanasius. It's too boring. I
admire your enthusiasm, and I wish to understand what gives rise to
it. It doesn't help me in the least to be told that everything that
ever happened was a manifestation of the class-struggle. Do you
think there were revolutions among the lung-fish? I dare say the
Revolution was an excellent thing for Russia. I wouldn't put the
clock back for a moment. But what I want to know is whether it
holds the seed of hope for the rest of the world beneath this
desiccated husk of class ideology.</p>

<p>M.: We're absolutely different. You can't be expected to have
the right outlook. You're...</p>

<p>R.B.: I'm of a different class, you mean?</p>

<p>M.: That's it. Your voice&mdash;it sounds affected to me.</p>

<p>R.B.: Perhaps it is. But I don't see that that's any reason why
we should start a class war over this table, or why the GPU should
send old professors to the Urals for writing about Byzantine
icons.</p>

<p>M.: They belong to the wrong class&mdash;they're our enemies.
The intellectuals have let us down too often. We can't take any
more risks, when the war may come at any moment.</p>

<p>R.B.: There you go again. <i>What</i> war?</p>

<p>M.: It's happened once. What about the Intervention?</p>

<p>R.B.: D'you think the whole of England is peopled with
Churchills?</p>

<p>M.: I don't know about that, but war's coming all right. Why,
it's beginning already in Manchuria. What's more, I tell you
seriously that in two or three years' time I hope to be inviting my
comrades from here to stay with me in Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>R.B.: That's a very bourgeois ambition. <i>(Inconsequently)</i>
Do you get on with Jews?</p>

<p>M.: I'm pretty used to them after living in the East End. I like
them. Still, they're not quite the same as yourself. Let's go up
and see Sylvia Chen.</p>

<p>R.B.: Why, is she a Jewess?</p>

<p>M.: No, she's a daughter of Eugene Chen and a French negress Her
brother's a commander in the Red Army, and she's a dancer.<br>
<br></p>

<p>We went upstairs to Miss Chen's apartment. Though her shelves
groaned with the early fathers of Materialism, she was temporarily
engrossed with the difficulty of obtaining new dance records, since
Jazz is proscribed by the Russian customs as 'ideologically
incorrect'. Even Morgan, now released from argument, admitted the
hardship of this deprivation. They put on an old record, and Miss
Chen hopped about, a pretty creature against the antiquated plush
of her surroundings.</p>

<p>'What are you going to do in Russia?' she asked me.</p>

<p>I said I hoped of course to go to Leningrad, and also to
Novgorod to see the old churches.</p>

<p>'Churches?' she answered. 'Whatever interests you about that
kind of dead stuff?'</p>

<p>I felt I could hardly explain.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-2"></a>II. CREED AND OBSERVANCE</h3>

<p><b>(1)</b>
</p>

<p>I have given the above conversation as one specimen out of many.
I had come to a new world: Morgan was to me as the kangaroo to
Captain Cook or as the Erewhonians to the Edwardians. Yet since he
was neither beast nor fiction, I could not, and cannot, treat him
and his like with the polite detachment of a zoologist.[*] This is
the normal attitude of the visiting foreigner, than which, if the
Russians only realized it, nothing is more insulting to them.
Nevertheless, beneath the insane babble of Marxian clich&eacute;s,
I was conscious of forces whose reality was not to be denied, and
whose significance aroused my avid curiosity. This curiosity, I
knew, would go unrequited unless I could see beyond the fanatics
and jargon that obscure every view in modern Russia.</p>

<blockquote>[* The original publication of this phrase in the
<i>Architectural Review</i> has enriched the Russian vocabulary. On
8 April 1933, <i>Pravda</i> appeared with the headline: 'Diehards'
Zoological Hatred of the Soviet Government'.]</blockquote>

<p>The first condition of understanding for the stranger is to
realize that the Revolution and all that followed it were the
outcome of processes which began with Russian history and will end
with it. The Byzantine Orthodox Church has always been
distinguished from the Catholic in that its ideal is rather the
attainment of heaven on earth by means of contemplation than the
pursuit of a satisfactory afterlife. From the domination of ideas
which this Church exercised from the tenth century on, no
Renascence ever delivered Russia. Nor were the serfs, as in other
countries, liberated from their material slavery by an economic
demand for fluid labour. Thus the Russian has always conceived of
progress as a mass-advance towards an immediate millennium rather
than as a succession of steps taken by gifted individuals towards
objective truth. While no country has produced more theorists on
the theme of human betterment, their concern has always been with
the prompt delivery rather than with the quality of the perfection
supplied. Only by this means could the mass of humanity, whose
mystic elevation has always been the keynote of Russian
speculation, be adequately embraced. The individual, wedded to
objective thought for its own selfish sake, was ignored as a
permanent factor in the social scheme, for the obvious reason that
the Russians have no conception of the individual in this
sense&mdash;a fact which emerges plainly enough from those
travesties of humanity which form the individual heroes of Russian
novels.</p>

<p>In the last century, the rise of an intellectual class gave
mouth and power to this Russo-Messianic concept of collective
uplift. At the same time there arrived from the West the new
industrial idea of a purely physical universe ruled by a God who
was nothing more than a chemist-engineer. Such an idea, reacting on
the pervasive mysticism of Orthodoxy and the fantastic sects that
had sprouted from so fertile a soil, produced a philosophic vacuum,
a kind of mystic nothingness, which was elaborated into a system by
Bakunin (1814-76) under the name of Nihilism. Then began the
classic era of sacrificial plotters, whose dramatic assassinations
attracted the attention of the outside world. It was complacently
imagined by their liberal sympathizers in other countries that the
murderers, if slightly misguided in their methods, were inspired by
the desire to free their country from a brutal autocracy. Even
to-day this idea is ingeniously fostered in the minds of foreign
tourists by the transformation of the fortress of Peter and Paul,
where the chief rebels were confined, into a museum for the display
of Tsarist atrocity. The hatred of the anarchists for the Monarchy
was doubtless genuine and disinterested. But if anyone wishes to
disabuse himself of the illusion that they wished to substitute for
it a regime of Anglo-Saxon liberty, let him read the appendix to
Ren&eacute; F&uuml;l&ouml;p-Miller's <i>Mind and Face of
Bolshevism,</i> which contains quotations from <i>The Possessed</i>
and <i>The Brothers Karamazov,</i> written by Dostoievsky in 1871
and 1879. Even these prophetic utterances are superfluous. For did
not Lenin say that freedom was a bourgeois prejudice?</p>

<p>The European may stigmatize as merely destructive the Russian
theorist's obsession with a joyless, unwilled mass-nirvana, and as
impracticable his conception of the human mass as the one and only
agent of human advance, obedient to the impulses of its
Narcissistic mysticism. He may even be permitted a just indignation
when these ideas threaten the structure of his own laboriously
evolved tradition. But it serves no end to curse the Russians for
thinking as they do, or to depreciate their ideal of enabling the
mass to exchange its bestial sloth for an inspired self-immolation
on the altar of industrial productivity. It is not our ideal. We
aim at an increasing distribution of material benefits within a
framework that preserves the prerogatives of the individual. But
let us understand that Bolshevism, whether it prove economically
feasible or not, derives directly and genuinely, from the Russian
view of the universe, which regards the passion of the mass-man for
the sake of the mass-man as the highest form of human
expression.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nihilism and its like offered incentive to individual
self-sacrifice, but no programme for co-ordinated action. This
deficiency was to be filled in part by Karl Marx, who propounded a
new philosophy of historical evolution, and in part by Lenin, who,
with the usual Russian impatience to be in at the Second Coming,
extracted from that philosophy a social doctrine capable of
immediate application, and, since evolution was concerned,
conceived himself to be the proper agent for speeding up that
cumbrous process.</p>

<p>Karl Marx arrived in London in 1849, and there devoted himself
to research among the voluminous materials that had already been
collected anent the conditions of the English working classes. In
his lighter moments he entertained a wholesome respect for class
distinctions and established authority: 'he attended at the Society
of Arts a soir&eacute;e graced by the presence of royalty...he
liked his wife to sign herself "Jenny, n&eacute;e Baronne de
Westphalen"...finally, he accepted the office of constable of the
vestry of St Pancras, taking the customary oath, and donning the
regulation uniform on gala occasions.'[*] He retained his
enthusiasm for Germany, 'sang the praises of German music and
literature', and regarded Germany's part in the war of 1870 as
purely defensive.</p>

<blockquote>[* A. Loria, <i>Karl Marx</i> (London, 1920), p.
48.]</blockquote>

<p>His contribution to thought was his conception of society as
something fluid, in a state of perpetual change and becoming, and
his adumbration of a law governing this process. It is claimed
that, as Darwin to biology, so he stands in relation to sociology.
The claim is somewhat exaggerated, for whereas Darwin could base
his deductions on the whole of the world's history, Marx was
necessarily confined to that comparatively narrow field contained
in the written records of a few thousand years. Starting with the
premise that all 'value' is the outcome of labour, his law of
evolution naturally developed a purely economic complexion: all
societies are based on the exploitation of labour in some form or
another, and since the exploiters cannot be expected to relinquish
their privileged position of their own accord, it is only by
explosions of violence that the changes rendered necessary by
changing methods of economic production are brought about; these
explosions are the outcome of a permanent, though generally latent,
struggle&mdash;the class war; as for politics, morals, religion,
art, and the rest, these are but the ideological expression of that
struggle. In Marx's opinion, the moment was at last approaching
when labour should free itself from the last of a succession of
exploiting classes and assume the whole fruits of its own toil for
itself. Thus his theory of social evolution dissolves, or is
dissolved by those who would put it to practical use, in the mist
of an imminent millennium. One is left in doubt as to whether, once
the workers cease to be exploited, the Marxian law will continue to
operate or not.</p>

<p>In putting forward his theory of the evolution of society
according to economic laws, Marx added something to the general
technique of historical inquiry. But in seeking to found, upon the
basis of those laws, an all-embracing philosophy, he displayed a
lack of scientific method which must be ascribed to the Jew's
inability to apprehend the reality of emotions and ideals of which
he himself has no personal experience.</p>

<p>It were redundant to indicate which particular points in the
Marxian philosophy brought grist to the revolutionary mill. But it
cannot be sufficiently stressed how easily these theories might
have disappeared into the limbo enjoyed by most of their kind, but
for their transformation into a militant creed of action at the
hands of Lenin. For good or evil, Lenin was one of the most
remarkable characters in history, not only by virtue of his
influence on the fate of millions, but for his individual
pertinacity and consistency in working towards an apparently
impossible goal. In the Marxian theory he saw a practical
instrument and he shaped it to that end. To read his works after
those of Marx is like turning to the Athanasian Creed from the
Sermon on the Mount. He found in Marx the raw material for both a
politico-economic programme and a philosophy to uphold it. When the
time came, the weapons were ready forged, and he brought them into
play.</p>

<p><b>(2)</b>
</p>

<p>Into the exact nature of the political organism that to-day
exists as the result of Lenin's activities, I do not propose to
inquire; abler heads than mine have run themselves against this
brick wall, and will continue to do so. But I wish to record a very
definite impression on my part of the nervous insecurity and strain
that prevails among all educated and semi-educated people in
Russia, members of the Communist Party included. The incidents that
contributed to form this impression were cumulative in their
effect, and in any case too numerous to recount. Indeed, its origin
was atmospheric as much as circumstantial. But if it was a correct
impression, its importance is vital to the sifting of the ashes
whence the phoenix of collective culture must eventually arise. The
stranger must inquire what produces it.</p>

<p>In describing the system under which they live, the Russians
themselves invariably make use of two terms, one political, the
other economic. These are 'the dictatorship of the proletariat' and
'State capitalism'.</p>

<p>The 'proletariat' is a name for that hypothetical mass with
whose aims Lenin, as a good Russian, necessarily identified his
own. But the word, when used in the Marxian sense, denotes a fluid
supply of labour, without anchorage or possessions, at the beck and
call of economic, i.e. capitalistic, demand. Unfortunately, this
particular kind of mass scarcely existed in Russia at the time of
the Revolution. Thus the Bolsheviks, having established a
government which has alienated the sympathies of the intellectual
class by its tyranny and an economic system which, if judged by
their own material standards, was, and is, a total failure from the
point of view of the peasant, lack the chief support postulated by
their creed, the very lynch-pin of the whole theoretical structure.
Until this support is created&mdash;that is to say, until at least
a bare majority of the Russian population has been recruited into
the ranks of the true proletarian nucleus already centred in the
large towns&mdash;the present rulers of Russia must continue in
their present state of nervous insecurity, particularly when they
consider the volume of existing discontent, passive though it be.
Hence the frantic efforts that have been, and are being, made to
create a fluid rural proletariat by impressing peasants into the
collective farms&mdash;by, in fact, the artificial stimulation of
that very process which the whole of <i>Capital</i> was meant to
damn for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Says Marx, after lauding the independence of the English peasant
before our great enclosures took place: 'What the capitalist system
demanded was, on the other hand, a degraded and almost servile
condition of the mass of the people, the transformation of them
into mercenaries, and of their means of labour into capital.' Says
Lenin, in his article on Marx written for a Russian encyclopaedia:
'If, finally, we wish to understand the attitude of Marxian
socialism towards the smaller peasantry...we must turn to a
declaration by Engels expressing Marx's views: <i>"When we are in
possession of the powers of the State, we shall not even dream of
forcibly expropriating the poorer peasants...Our task as regards
the small-holders will first of all consist in transforming their
individual production and individual ownership into co-operative
production and co-operative ownership, not forcibly, but by way of
example, and by offering social aid for this purpose."'</i>[*] Well
might Marx cause an earthquake in the Highgate cemetery and Lenin
burst his mausoleum to fragments, could they have witnessed the
treatment of the Russian peasant carried out in their names during
the last five years.</p>

<blockquote>[* Lenin, <i>Collected Works,</i> Authorized English
Edition, vol. xviii, p. 42.]</blockquote>

<p>So bitter and so widespread has been the resentment aroused by
this treatment that Stalin, temporarily at least, has had a stop
put to it. It is the result, not of socialism, but of State
capitalism, as the Russians admit. Marx was at pains to point out
that capitalists always tend to absorb one another. 'Along with the
constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital...grows
the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation,
exploitation.' Is this true of Russia, where the number of
capitalists has been diminished to one? If so, what will be the
result?</p>

<p>Either the peasants, incensed beyond all reason, will resist all
attempts to proletarianize them; in which case they will be
permanently at odds with the communist aristocracy of the towns,
and the class war will go on, thus vindicating Marx's theory of
evolution. Or they will surrender themselves to a joyless
impersonal exploitation by the State, redeemed by elementary
education and broadcast culture; and Marx's theory will either die
of classless inanition or receive its most terrific vindication in
a subsequent revolt on the part of the expropriated against the one
grand expropriator&mdash;the State. Both alternatives hold
possibilities well calculated to disturb the present rulers. They
have staked everything on the Five-Year Plan. This, if it succeeds,
should create a purely industrial proletariat of sufficient size to
support them and recruited without the ill-feeling produced by
compulsory measures. Meanwhile the tension, as of a man fighting
for his life, pervades the whole country. It may not conduce to the
pursuit of objective truth or the creation of great art, but it
results in a great activity and exercise of the mind.</p>

<p><b>(3)</b>
</p>

<p>It was recognized from the beginning by Lenin and his coadjutors
that allegiance to their politico-economic system must depend, in
the long run, on a general acceptance of its concomitant philosophy
by those capable of even the most rudimentary mental activity. In
attempting to secure this allegiance they were at once face to face
with the weakest link in their carefully forged chain for the
bondage of the individual&mdash;with, in fact, a link so weak as to
constitute a gap. To remedy this deficiency they have exercised an
ingenuity which deserves the success it is receiving. But the very
contrivances to which they are obliged to resort, reveal more
clearly than anything else the totally unscientific character of
the philosophy to which they are committed.</p>

<p>The exponents of Dialectical Materialism, as the creed
enunciated by Lenin is called, regard the universe as composed
solely of phenomena whose reality can be subjected to the empirical
test of their own senses. Religion is their bane. It diverts man's
attention and effort from the society in which he lives; its
priesthood is invariably the agent of political and social
stagnation. This view is rational enough, and, though one may take
occasional exception to it, not difficult to acquiesce in or at
last to understand. But the Materialists are also the victims of a
frenzied and irrational hate for those ancient beliefs and
institutions which symbolize, possibly in its crudest form, the
search of mankind for a central Reality and, consequently, the
prime obstacle to the spread of the New Gospel. This hate,
amounting almost to dementia, has prevented them from conducting
any detached inquiry into the reason why religion exists and always
has existed. Ostrich-like they have failed to recognize that
religion fulfils some fundamental human need.</p>

<p>After the Revolution, religion in Russia fell, or was thrust,
into very general desuetude. No sooner did this happen than the
needs which, however superficially or improperly, it had hitherto
satisfied, made themselves apparent in an atmosphere of licence,
restlessness, and disillusionment. Village life had lost its
keystone; the peasant his theatre; among the educated or
semi-educated classes was felt an equal lack of that faith or code
without which life cannot be regulated. In addition, the new rulers
were not slow to discover that they, too, had lost something, and
that this was hardly the moment to dispense with the traditional
ally of all government. 'Religion,' they had thundered, 'is the
opium of the people.' The practical value of this maxim now became
fully apparent to them. Since all pre-existing religions were
proscribed by the new philosophy, there was only one course open to
them in their need for a popular soporific. This was to erect the
philosophy itself into a religion. And this they have done. They
have preserved the jealousy of the God of Israel while dispensing
with the God himself, and the external ceremony of the Orthodox
Church while dispensing with the Church. In place of the single God
enthroned in heaven, they have substituted the Mass enthroned on
earth; in place of the Church, a hierarchy no less
intolerant&mdash;YOUTH. It is a different kind of opium; its dreams
are less reposeful. But it works.</p>

<p>The Italian Professor Achille Loria closes his monograph on Karl
Marx with words which might almost be supposed, by one ignorant of
their context, to emanate from a newly discovered papyrus of St
John the Divine:</p>

<blockquote>For the day is coming. And in that day, when
remorseless time shall have destroyed the statues of the saints and
of the warriors, renascent humanity will raise in honour of the
author of this work of destruction, upon the shores of his native
stream, a huge mausoleum representing the proletarian breaking his
chains and entering upon an era of conscious and glorious freedom.
Thither will come the regenerated peoples bearing garlands of
remembrance and of gratitude to lay upon the shrine of the great
thinker, who, amid sufferings, humiliations, and numberless
privations, fought unceasingly for the ransom of mankind. And the
mothers, as they show to their children the suffering and
suggestive figure, will say, their voices trembling with emotion
and joy: See from what darkness our light has come forth; see how
many tears have watered the seeds of our joy; look, and pay
reverence to him who struggled, who suffered, who died for the
Supreme Redemption.</blockquote>

<p>True, the Rhine still waits its promised monument. But I could
not help thinking, as I walked about Moscow on 22 January, what a
graceful and at the same time inexpensive gesture the British
Government might make by unearthing the bones of Marx and his Jenny
in Highgate[*] and presenting them to Russia. Lenin, after all, is
only second best. Still, he makes a very decent pilgrimage, and the
patriot type of saint is certainly the more fashionable at the
moment.</p>

<blockquote>[* They share God's acre with those of Thomas Hood the
poet, and Lillywhite the cricketer. Coleridge is round the corner

Betjeman, the father of necropolitan research.]</blockquote>

<p>Lenin died on 21 January. For some inscrutable Russian reason
his death is mourned, or was this year, on 22 January. The Red Good
Friday proved the occasion for elaborate manifestations of dolour,
such as mark the same season in Rome. To all shops and offices of
any pretension, red banners, bearing the hammer and sickle in gold,
and bound in black, had been distributed, and now hung motionless
in the cold fog with which nature was participating in the national
grief. The grandiose front of the Bolshoy Theatre, the Opera, was
draped on either side with an immense arras of the same character;
while across the portico the name LENIN was blazoned in scarlet
light, like a gigantic IHS. In addition to this Latin ostentation,
something of the English Sabbath had crept in. The sale of alcohol
was forbidden, lest the dignity of the occasion should be marred by
the usual inebriate holiday-makers. Even food was difficult to
obtain. At the same time hotels and restaurants were crowded with
congresses and delegations assembled to observe the sacred day. In
the Red Square, a queue had formed such as one sees in London when
a dead king lies in state, twisting and turning over the great
expanse of snow, like one of those wire puzzles that have neither
end nor beginning. From morning till night it shuffled convulsively
along, a foot at a time. There might have been ten or a hundred
thousand people; I could find no means of computing. But it struck
me that none of them would have been there, to stand for an hour in
a temperature of several degrees below zero, unless actuated by
genuine emotion and a personal conviction of the solemnity of the
occasion.</p>

<p>The instances of resemblance between the outward manifestations
of the Materialist faith and those of the older religions could be
multiplied indefinitely; they astonish the visitor at every turn.
In factories and clubs, the icon corner has been replaced by the
Lenin or the Marx corner: hideous busts of pseudo-bronze stand on
pyramidical pedestals draped in red, bowered in red, and backed
with red. In the separate rooms, less expensive coloured prints
replace the erstwhile less expensive icons, forerunners of a new
and monotonous hagiography depicting Stalin, Kalinin, Krupskaya,
and Budenny. In the large towns, every third shop window teems with
these frightful representations, of all sizes to suit all purses,
and exhibiting a lack of artistry sickening to behold. On being
told the sum formerly derived by the Pechersky Lavra in Kiev from
the sale of holy pictures, I was anxious to learn what profit
accrued to the present government from the same source. The answer
to my inquiry was, that far from there being any profit, the State
actually incurred a considerable loss in promoting the distribution
of its blessed effigies.</p>

<p>In addition to dead saints, there are the living Early Fathers,
the Jeromes, Clements, Origens, and Athanasiuses, who thunder out
their daily commentaries on the central creed and its application
to the daily emergency with the prolific inconsequence induced by
modern printing facilities. In Kremlin, commissariat, club,
factory, institute, and school, these Early Fathers reside and
multiply, seeking heresies and definitions with the appetite of
Byzantine Christologists. Fortunately for their happiness, there is
no end to either, since their dogma is based on the most uncertain
of all sciences and the details of its proper practice are as
elusive as quicksilver.</p>

<p>These Christian similes may sound far-fetched; but though
individual definitions of what does and does not constitute a
religion may differ, they do in fact convey better than any other
the mental atmosphere of Bolshevist Russia. It is as easy for
us&mdash;for me&mdash;to laugh at the ideological hair-splitting
and Salvation Army jargon that have grown up round the Materialist
creed as it was for Gibbon to ridicule the Monophysites and the
Monothelites. Yet the purpose of these ideological and
Christological controversies is the same, and an eminently
comprehensible one: namely, to expand the provisions of a central
creed so as to cover every possible contingency by a formula that
shall be intelligible to the illiterate or the semi-literate mass.
Where the parallel may possibly lose its force is in the nature of
the spiritual force or faith behind the two religions.</p>

<p>The faith that inspired the earlier Russian revolutionaries was,
as I have tried to explain, a conviction that the redemption of
humanity must and could be attained through the mental and material
advance of humanity in the mass. This was Lenin's faith. It may
incorporate a kind of devil-worship. But judged by the measure of
his devotion to his faith, Lenin was a great and noble man. I could
not help asking myself, when in Russia, whether, now, this same
faith was not giving place to external boastfulness and
megalomania, a kind of hollow, inverted Fascism. One hears too much
about the enthusiasm of YOUTH, in Russia as everywhere else. The
very phrase is suspicious; it cloaks an emptiness; great movements
cannot draw their force from supporters in a state of petrified
immaturity. Russian YOUTH may feel itself predestined to dominate
the globe. Drunk with titanic visions, it may hurl itself down
mines and into factories. For the moment, the Five-Year Plan
provides a psychological safety-valve to this bursting
intoxication, this class-chauvinism. But where is the original
faith? What will sustain the young shock-brigaders and komsomols of
to-day twenty years hence, if the reward should not prove equal to
their hope?</p>

<p>To these questions, to the question whether Materialism is
destined to endure for centuries as a vital force, or to crumble
away like a nerveless tooth, I can put no answer. Meanwhile, it
seeks to reinforce its dominion with every device of jealous
obscurantism and personal oppression known to the medieval Church
or the Spanish Inquisition. The faith may survive the longer for
such conditions, the social structure gain in strength. But art and
culture must either die, as they died with Julian the Apostate, or
assume a form as yet unknown, as they assumed in the Gothic
cathedrals. So far, only darkness is descending, while the new
light has not begun to shine. But the Dark Ages lasted four
centuries. Must Russia wait as long, plunged in her scientific
night?</p>

<blockquote>At a certain stage of their development (wrote Marx[*])
the material productive forces of society come into conflict with
the existing production relationships, or, what is but a legal
expression for the same thing, with the property relationships
within which they have hitherto moved...A period of social
revolution then begins. With the change in the economic foundation,
the whole gigantic superstructure is more or less rapidly
transformed. In considering such transformations, we must always
distinguish between the material changes in the economic conditions
of production...and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic, or
philosophic, in short, ideological forms, <i>in which human beings
become conscious of this conflict and fight it out to an
issue.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>[* <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political
Economy</i> (Chicago, 1904).]</blockquote>

<p>The italics are mine. They enshrine the kernel of Bolshevist
truth: thought, creative power, can have but one beginning and one
end, one incentive and one purpose&mdash;the furtherance of the
class-struggle.</p>

<p>Education thus becomes a question of instilling into children
(from the ages of six to sixty) the belief that the continuance of
this struggle is the proper aim of all human beings and the
particular aim of all good Russians. As far as general principles
are concerned, a specious amorality is inculcated by the most
elementary copybooks. Spy on your neighbour and cherish the
machine! is the motto of Russian childhood. In the towns, the
principal churches are occupied by a litter of posters and
photographs which remind one of a dismantled coffee-stall. Closer
examination reveals a pictorial exposure of the iniquities and
class bias of all religions&mdash;Orthodox, Catholic, and
Protestant Christianity, the Sects, Judaism, Mohammedanism, and
Buddhism. The Calvinistic fury of Materialism can tolerate no
rivals. Crowds of children trail round behind their teachers, as we
see them at the Burlington House exhibitions, imbibing knowledge of
the hard and fast line between the new Right and the new Wrong as
laid down in these Anti-God Museums. The same line is apparent in
the Press and in public entertainments. At the Press it becomes no
Englishman to throw stones; I can only blush in guilty silence. But
on the Moscow wireless, during the English programme, I heard one
thing that might have shocked even Mr Maxton. The speaker was
describing the industrial activity of Sverdlovsk, a town in the
Urals once known as Ekaterinbourg. In their spare time, he said,
smiling children and workers might be seen going in and out of the
house of Ipatiev&mdash;now a museum&mdash;'where the family of
Romanov met the fate it justly deserved'. The man's voice, I
thought, faltered as he spoke his silly text. And well it might. If
this is how the Bolsheviks conduct their propaganda abroad, the
world is safe from revolution for a long time. I should like to go
to Sverdlovsk and see the children smiling in the death-cellar of
those other children. The sight would bear noble witness to the
power of the new faith, and also to that cowardly, hypocritical
pretence of infallibility, mark of all religions, which must needs
brazen out the most repulsive accidents.</p>

<p>The atmospheric oppression of a land where the only truths are
the class war and the machine, and where all culture must be
subservient to those ends, is alleviated by the novelty&mdash;one
might even say eccentricity&mdash;that results. The air is mixed
with laughing-gas. But it is a stifling air&mdash;how stifling I
only realized on reaching Kiev, which preserves in some indefinable
way its old university tradition of the humanities and allows one
to breathe normally again. Not that I was unhappy in Russia. I can
truthfully say that in no foreign country have I ever enjoyed
myself so positively, been so sheltered from boredom, or felt such
regret at departure. But this was partly due, I must confess, to
the pleasant feeling of pugnacity that woke in my bosom. The system
is intended for the world&mdash;that is clear from the start. Try
your damned religion on me, I felt, and you'll get as good as you
give! And so they did, now and then. Yet I could not but respect
persons so deeply engaged in a definite purpose and so
homogeneously subscribing, with heart or lip, to a definite belief.
Such fixity was hardly to be despised by a member of that nation
whose chosen patriots are Noel Coward and Winston Churchill. It was
rather to be envied.</p>

<p>My first real consciousness of the Great Untruth was brought to
the surface by a Beethoven concert conducted by Oscar Fried in the
Moscow Conservatorium. They were playing the Pastoral Symphony. It
was not a bad performance, though the instruments lacked tone. When
it was at an end, I looked up and remembered where I was. And then,
suddenly, it came to me that here&mdash;not in capitalism, nor in
Christianity, but here on the concert platform in these tattered
scores&mdash;was the enemy that Materialism can never conquer and
that must ultimately and inevitably conquer Materialism. It seemed
to me that to allow such a performance to take place in public was
simply an act of quixotic folly on the part of the authorities. In
theory, no doubt, the Pastoral Symphony provides exemplary
illustration of the class war in rural Austria. In practice...I
turned my attention to the audience and read, or thought I read, my
own thoughts in their faces. Only a group of shock-brigaders, young
hierarchs in tall boots, looked sullen, as indeed it was their duty
to do. They would have explained to me, had I reproached them for
their attendance, that music, above all arts, conduces to the
socialization of emotion. This means, in ordinary language, that it
moves a lot of people at once. But if I had asked them how it is
that certain compositions wield this invaluable power in a greater
degree than others, or whether the emotion produced by them is not
the outcome of a highly incorrect revelation of abstract beauty, I
do not know what they would have replied. The functions of art are
one thing. Its creation and effect are another. Either art must be
proscribed in its entirety, as St Clement of Alexandria
recommended; or, if its effect is considered beneficial to the
general mass, then the individual must be allowed free play with
abstractions in order to create it. The learned doctors of
Materialism argue that a class war for the redemption of humanity
should be abstraction enough for any artist. This may be so. A
spontaneous culture may spring from the soil of mass-betterment.
But I could see no signs of it. When I asked for any, they could
only answer with Christ: 'A wicked and adulterous generation
seeketh a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it.' This was
disappointing. Still, I persisted in my search.</p>

<p>At Morgan's instance, I went to see the two most recent
sound-films made in the Russian studios. Russian films of the
revolutionary or epic period have aroused great hopes. These,
depicting the present period of construction, proved by contrast
somewhat disappointing.</p>

<p>The first was called <i>Sniper.</i> It opened with a regiment of
British troops in kilts made of duster-cloth being cheered off to
the front to the strains of 'Tipperrarr-ee', which tune, I
afterwards learnt, they had been taught to sing by Morgan. A
confusing succession of incidents on various fronts followed,
during which No-man's-land was suddenly transformed into a
maize-field, in order that harvesting women, whom the German Army
was gallantly assisting in their labours, might be shot down by the
Allied guns. Finally, the scene changed to the new Russia, in which
all the workers but one of a certain factory devoted their leisure
hours to rifle-practice. This one, a feckless youth, maundered
about with a tennis racquet; until one day the capitalist invasion
began, and the tennis racquet proved of little service in defending
either its owner's person or his fatherland. I was reminded of
those ridiculous British productions sponsored by the Empire
Marketing Board to promote imperial fellowship. And I must say, in
all justice, that even the Moscow Press was loud in its
denunciations of such crudity.</p>

<p>The other film, on the other hand, had been acclaimed as a
national triumph, and has presumably obtained popularity abroad,
since I afterwards found it showing in Constantinople and it has
since been seen in London. The photography was generally good and
in parts excellent. Its title may be rendered as <i>The Way into
Life.</i></p>

<p>The theme was the redemption of those homeless children that
have grown up like animals and have infested Russia since the great
famine. They are shown at first as thieves and thugs. Then, while
sleeping in a cellar, they are rounded up and transported to a
deserted church in the country which they turn into a workshop.
Their gradual transformation into useful members of society is
effected by a kind of scoutmaster who seeks to inculcate into them
the public school sense of honour, and is materially assisted in
this admirable work by the hero of the film, a worthy Tartar boy
named Mustafa. But evil influences persist. While the scoutmaster
is away, a disaffected section of the boys, despite the opposition
of those led by Mustafa, breaks all the machines. The scoutmaster,
on return, cannot conceal his pain, but instead of reproaches he
produces a toy train from a brown-paper parcel. This he sets going
on toy rails; and, inspired by its example, they start to build a
real railway. Meanwhile the disaffected section has discovered a
log-hut in the woods where prostitutes congregate and vodka
circulates freely. To this horrible resort they lure Mustafa and
his disciples, now clad in smart lounge suits. But when the orgy is
at its height, the latter, at a sign from their leader, draw
revolvers, shoot up a number of strange but repulsive men, and bind
the evil women, who are now in a state of blubbering dishevelment.
By now the line is finished. The night before the opening Mustafa
goes down it on a trolley, singing a Tartar song as the dawn
breaks, the birds begin to chirp, and the bull-frogs to croak. But
an enemy lies in wait; the trolley is upset and Mustafa stabbed to
death. After some delay the ceremonial first train, manned by the
now fully reclaimed boys, starts its opening journey without him.
Then they find his body, and placing it reverently on the front of
the engine, steam into the terminus of a small town, where
rejoicing at once gives way to grief. In real life, I am glad to
say, Mustafa is still with us. Moscow now realizes that he is human
after all, and that he is more broadminded in his pleasures than
the film would have us believe.</p>

<p>There were moments in this film of real emotional solemnity,
such as that of the Tartar song at dawn. But for me these were
entirely overshadowed by the didactic unreality of the whole story,
and by the catechism in Right and Wrong which the audience was
obliged to answer in order to keep abreast of the plot. It was the
atmosphere of <i>Eric, or Little by Little</i> and <i>The Fairchild
Family</i> over again, with the same fascination of the
contemporary social document. I would have given half my time in
Russia to have read into the hearts of my fellow-spectators, and to
have discovered whether this crude antithesis of Materialist values
had inspired them with real emotional piety, or had rendered their
entertainment, as it had mine, just a little tedious.</p>

<p>It would be possible to continue indefinitely the list of
experiences which went to prove how utterly impossible, and, from
the Materialist point of view, undesirable, it is that any form of
disinterested, nonpolitical, or non-economic culture should ever
flourish on the soil of modern Russia. But there came to my notice
one final instance which revealed, more plainly and more
grotesquely than anything else, the mendacious and futile
obscurantism to which the new religion finds it necessary to resort
in its own self-defence. There hangs in Moscow one of the finest
and most representative collections of modern French pictures that
has ever been assembled. Over the entrances of each room are
printed notices, which are designed to assist the appreciation of
less sophisticated visitors. In appending a selection from these
notices, I withhold comment that would be impertinent to the
intelligence of the English reader and offensive to my Russian
friends:<br>
<br></p>

<p>MONET: Age of transition from capitalism to imperialism. Taste
of the industrial bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>C&Eacute;ZANNE: Age of the preliminary period of imperialism.
Taste of the industrial bourgeoisie.</p>

</p>

<p>While the doctrine of Materialism ascribes all artistic creation
to the genius of the mass and epoch rather than to that of the
individual, it must perforce admit that the concrete fruits of such
creation do owe their shape to some effort on the part of the
individual, even though his proper function is only to interpret
and organize the taste and emotions of the mass and epoch; and that
the successful fulfilment of this function, impersonal though it
be, requires of the individual a degree of concentration and
thought which distinguishes him from the common herd and thus
postulates the existence of an intelligentsia. 'We workers,' say
the good partymen, 'will create our own intelligentsia.' So they
may do&mdash;though how, neither they nor I can explain. But
whatever its origins, this intelligentsia will constitute a
different class from that of the 'workers and peasants', and as
such a suspect class. All disinterested thought, such as we regard
as the first condition of cultural development, is rendered
impossible in Russia by the jealousy of the prevailing religion.
But even those of the intelligentsia who sincerely subscribe to
that religion&mdash;'one must believe in it, or one cannot live
here', said the son of a former landowner, now an engineer, to
me&mdash;even they are subject to a system of bewildering
impediments which makes the foreign observer wonder how their task
can be adequately performed and whether anything truly inventive
can ever result from their efforts. I would emphasize the fact that
I am writing here, not of the disgruntled dispossessed, but of
those who are honestly desirous of working for and with the new
system, but whose vocations necessarily place them in the
intellectual class.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago one of Dostoievsky's characters spoke as follows
concerning the social system adumbrated by another:</p>

<blockquote>One thing in his book is good, the idea of espionage.
In his idea every member of the society spies on the others, and is
bound to inform against them when necessary. All are slaves and
equal in their slavery...First of all, the level of education,
science, and innate natural talent falls. A high intellectual level
is possible only to superior talents; but we have no need of
superior talents. Superior talents have always seized power for
themselves and led to despotism. Men of talent cannot help becoming
despots, they have always done more harm than good; therefore they
are driven out or put to death.[*]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[* From <i>The Possessed,</i> quoted by Ren&eacute;
F&uuml;l&ouml;p-Miller in <i>The Mind and Face of
Bolshevism.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>This prophecy is somewhat exaggerated, since Materialism has
great need of superior talents and its exponents admit the fact.
But it contains much that the visitor to Russia can recognize.</p>

<p>Those less fortunate observers, who are obliged to commit
themselves entirely to the excellent facilities offered by the
Russian tourist agency, remain completely oblivious to that unique
state of affairs which most clearly distinguishes the lives of
Russian humanity from those led by humanity in any other part of
the globe. This state of affairs consists in the universal,
all-pervasive practice of espionage and suspicion conducted among
all grades of the Materialist society. I heard it said that one in
every fourteen persons in the whole of Russia is in some way or
other an agent of the secret police. Whether this is true, I do not
know. But my own short experience revealed to me that even the
boldest flights of fiction conceived by the late Mr Edgar Wallace
had visualized nothing to compare with the reality of those
excitements which the Russian people are daily privileged to enjoy.
Now that I am back in England, no report circulated by the die-hard
Press seems too preposterous to believe, even though, in nine cases
out of ten, I do not believe it. At times, during my visit, I began
to doubt my own sanity; but never for long; some conversation with
those who had actually experienced the ordeals of Russian
citizenship or residence always intervened to restore it. Plotters,
saboteurs, informers, kulaks, assassins, counter-revolutionaries,
and the ever-renascent bourgeoisie, native or foreign, lurk behind
every window, playing their assigned r&ocirc;les with the
ineradicable malignancy of the Vauriens in Elmer Rice's
<i>Purilia.</i> Against these vile creatures, the Communist
Paragonians, members of that unspotted &eacute;lite, the party
proper,[*] are engaged in ceaseless warfare. It is a kind of
film-land, where all the types are prearranged and Goodness shines
with perpetual brightness in its everlasting victory over Sin. Even
prostitutes, being forbidden a trade-union, cannot flourish.</p>

<blockquote>[* This body numbers only about two
millions.]</blockquote>

<p>The secret police are known as the GPU. This is pronounced
Gaypayooh&mdash;but only by foreigners. By Russians the term is
never uttered. They may sometimes talk in whispers of the
'three-letter men'. But generally they prefer not to mention them
at all. It became one of my favourite amusements to enunciate the
fatal syllables in public places, in order to watch the tremor of
surprise and apprehension elicited from everyone within hearing. On
one occasion, it happened that my companion and I had inadvertently
settled ourselves in a railway compartment reserved for the State
couriers. The first of them to arrive naturally expostulated, and
on seeing that we did not understand, pointed to the red tabs on
his collar. 'Oh!' I said, comprehending, 'you're a GPU man, are
you?' At which even he, who was, started as though I had stuck a
pin into his behind. He proved afterwards a Crichton of courtesy
and assistance, even getting out of his bed at three in the morning
to see us comfortably off the train.</p>

<p>But there is another and repulsive side to the picture. It must
be remembered that the majority of those who enjoy the real power
in Russia to-day are men who spent their early lives hunted from
pillar to post by the Tsarist Okhrana; they were imprisoned; they
were sent to Siberia; and the old spirit of suspicion and
<i>revanche</i> still lives in them. Lenin and Trotsky were
different. They too may have harboured these feelings. But their
constructive energy outweighed them. To-day Russia is ruled by men
of meaner mould, men whose twisted outlook infects the whole Soviet
Union with a spirit of malice and suspicion. The whole air is
poisoned by this evil. Every man lives in fear of his neighbour.
Even the school-children are admonished, in the books from which
they learn to read, to train themselves as spies in their own
villages. I do not exaggerate. I talked with persons who had been
recently summoned to cross-examination by the GPU and with persons
who had recently been the victims of their midnight raids. I
learned from first-hand of their cold chamber. I found that
distinguished scholars whom I had wished to meet had 'disappeared'.
I experienced personally their postal inquisition. Yet such
information was acquired purely by chance in the most casual
fashion. I was far too interested in the permanent Russia as it was
and ever shall be, and was enjoying myself far too much there, to
go nosing about in search of evil. Finally, after the Foreign
Office had begged me to extend my stay, some unknown authority
thought it better not to extend my visa. But then, I thought, in a
country that celebrates its October Revolution in November, one
should not be surprised that the Foreign Office cannot grant its
own visas.</p>

<p>It is none of my purpose or business to censure the government
of Russia and the priesthood of Materialism for maintaining a body
of agents and police such as have always been found necessary to
uphold the government and religion of that country. It may
reasonably be assumed, from the historical evidence, that the
Russian people and those who comprise the rest of the Union can
only be governed by a despotism based on espionage, and that some
such body must always be inherent in the Russian State. I am simply
concerned to note the mental effect of such a system, whose rigour
has been steadily increasing during the last five years, and whose
brunt is borne mainly by the intellectual class, not necessarily on
account of subversive activity, but simply because it is the
intellectual class. It is they who are pilloried as the public
enemies in theatrical trials; it is they whose every word and
action is circumscribed by terror of the 'ideologically incorrect',
whose avocations are supervised by semi-literate youths chosen from
the party ranks, whose numbers are continually depleted to swell
the Ural camps, and whose families suffer from cruel uncertainty.
Such measures <i>may</i> be necessary; there may be enemies lurking
in their midst; considering the difficulties under which they work,
I should be surprised if there were not; these things again are not
for me to affirm. But what I will affirm, and what I would beg the
reader to share with me, is my contempt for those foreign
intellectuals, and particularly those English ones, who, while
finding in Russia the exemplar of social and economic planning, the
climax of constructive politics, the paradise of YOUTH&mdash;in
short, the model towards which all truly progressive persons must
look for world redemption&mdash;are so intoxicated with admiration
that they can spare no word of sympathy for their
fellow-intellectuals, the men in Russia likest to themselves, for
whom there is no place or hope under the system they so ardently
covet. That this system would immediately, on attaining power,
annihilate these miserable hypocrites, these hypnotees of every
windblown theory, these bastards by uplift out of comfortable
income, is the one satisfaction I could derive from its
introduction into England. These Fabian ghosts, these liberal
politicians, socialist editors and female peace-promoters, are the
very people who anathematize without cease the tyranny of Hitler
and his treatment of the German intellectual. But in Russia, where
they are building not only socialism but Fordson tractors, the
treatment of the intellectual does not matter: what counts freedom
of thought or scholarship or individual creation beside the
regeneration of the Great Unwashed? Very little, I dare say. And as
little as these things count in that new world, just so little in
this old one count those men whose inheritance they are and who
renounce them for a mess of Bolshevist pottage. Let us rather have
amongst us the red revolutionary who tries to seduce the troops and
goes to prison for it, than these Russophil enthusiasts who acclaim
the downfall of their own kind as the ultimate triumph of
civilization.</p>

<p>Despite its cruelty, it is possible to argue that the old
intellectual has deserved his fate, on account of his
procrastination of soul and his slowness to ally himself with the
new movement when it rose to power. But it is not only the old
intellectual that falls under the ban of prevalent suspicion. The
new&mdash;the inventors, planners, engineers, specialists, editors,
architects, film-producers, and their like, all the prophets of the
modern age&mdash;suffer from the same intolerable lack of freedom.
In 1930 the campaign waged against them by the GPU reached such a
pitch of fury that the authorities began to count the cost. Rykov
produced figures to show how the Five-Year Plan was being hampered
by this insensate policy. Until at last Stalin, who is a realist
when the truth penetrates to him, called off the terror. The GPU,
it was felt, was getting too big for its boots, with the result
that administrative measures were taken to diminish its power. At
the same time the salaries of the specialists were increased. These
measures, it is evident, have since been reversed, and the terror
re-started, in order to throw the blame for the failure of
industrial projects on to specialists and foreigners. In any case
the evil has been done, and it will take more than temporary
half-measures and periods of leniency to undo it. Maurice Hindus
asks: 'Can Russia make man as inventive, as creative, as
constructive as a capitalist regime which lays at the feet of a
Ford, a Rosenwald, a Woolworth, a Rockefeller, all the rewards that
this earth can afford? This is the crux of the Communist challenge
to Capitalism.'[*] In my opinion, this is not the crux; the
national enthusiasm for the work in hand seemed, among nearly all
those I met&mdash;even among such minor actors in the drama as
archaeologists and museum curators&mdash;to provide its own reward.
Where the crux lies now (Hindus wrote at the beginning of 1929) and
where the whole system is threatened with breakdown, is in the
terror of responsibility which has resulted from the preposterous
campaign against the intellectual of the last five years. One of
the foreign specialists in the country assured me that no sooner
did he leave his office on one of those frequent trips to which his
business called him, than his whole department absolutely ceased to
function owing to the positive physical fear that now accompanies
the taking of any decision whatsoever. Certainly, he said, there
were other difficulties in the way of the Five-Year Plan; these
difficulties, however, could be overcome. But in this doctrinal and
actual proscription of the intellectual class he saw an insuperable
obstacle to the Plan's success. And he prophesied that unless the
psychological effects of the last three years were
removed&mdash;unless, in fact, the class war should cease&mdash;the
immense factories now in construction would either have to be
placed under the management of foreigners or bankrupt the State by
their total failure.</p>

<blockquote>[* <i>Humanity Uprooted,</i> p. 82.]</blockquote>

<p>In concluding this very incomplete account of the psychological
atmosphere in which the Russian intellectual moves and attempts to
have his being, I would mention two last factors whose significance
is by no means negligible and which serve, in some degree, to
counterbalance the disabilities enumerated above. These are Russian
nationalism and the paradox involved in the Russian worship of the
machine.</p>

<p>The Allied intervention in Russia after the war was over was the
most futile, most stupidly conducted, and most subsequently harmful
adventure that modern history can show. The Materialist philosophy
had postulated at least a brand of internationalism, even if that
brand meant only loyalty to international socialism. Owing to the
intervention and the attitude that the greater part of the foreign
Press has inherited from it, there has resulted in Russia a mental
isolation from the rest of the world which was at first merely
negative, but which is now crystallizing into a positive national
egotism of the most pronounced kind. Owing to the general
impossibility of travel, of corresponding with foreigners, or of
obtaining foreign books, both the educated and the semi-educated
Russian honestly believe that in themselves alone is concentrated
all the really progressive thought of the whole world; in which
belief they are confirmed by the agreement of the foreign
enthusiasts. This state of affairs, though it hardly conduces to a
profitable use of the world's intellectual resources, sustains the
Russian intellectual in his present difficulties by placing him, at
least in his own estimate, in the van of human affairs. His vanity,
moreover, is flattered by the enormous curiosity which his country
continues to arouse. It is not unpleasant to be regarded either as
a bogy or as a saviour, but never as a nonentity, by virtue of
one's very nationality. In addition, this mental chauvinism is
reinforced by continual war scares. The reader may find it hard to
believe, but I can assure him that I emerged into the streets of
Moscow one morning to discover the hitherto sober trams adorned
with posters calling on the wise citizen to buy his gas-mask before
it was too late. Malicious rumour said that the army stocks having
been found to be defective, it was now sought to unload these
essential household requisites on the civil population at seven
roubles apiece. Be this as it may, no Russian seemed to think the
admonition absurd. 'What about the Intervention?' came the
inevitable retort. But the real explanation is, that deep down in
the hearts of the population endures an older patriotism than that
inculcated by Materialism&mdash;a patriotism which must always be
associated with 'Holy Russia'. I was told of a certain evening at
the opera about a year before, when it happened that the principal
singer had ended his part, the climax of the piece, with the words:
'GOD SHALL SAVE RUSSIA'. Whereupon the audience rose to its feet in
the stress of its collective emotion and cheered away its feelings
till the roof shook. It was not the voice of the old Christians
that cheered, but the voice of Russia, of the Russia that has stood
and shall stand till the world's end.</p>

<p>The paradox involved in the prevailing adoration of the machine
lies in the fact that this cult should find its most devoted
adherents in the most unmechanical country in the world. In the
early days of this century, when Russian literature and Russian
ballet swept over Western Europe, an idea grew up that the average
Russian lived in a romantic Slav twilight, a cherry orchard of his
own incapacity, where everything was excused by wringing of hands
and a reference to temperament. Whether this ever was so, I doubt;
it certainly is no longer. Russian incompetence of to-day is
something cosmic, almost brutal, scorning excuse and seeking none.
Should circumstances happen to obtrude it on the foreigner, and he
happens to remark on it, this is considered an exhibition of bad
form on both sides. During one week in the Ukraine, my companion
and I experienced no less than five railway mishaps, in one of
which&mdash;though fortunately it happened to the train in
front&mdash;nineteen people were killed and over forty injured. Our
eyebrows rose; finally, when the memory of this tragic accident had
evaporated, we broke into uncontrollable laughter, and teased our
guide till the poor man almost lost his faith in Progress. Was this
the country of the Five-Year Plan, we asked, rejoicing in our
ribald scepticism. But our inquiry lacked generosity. For those
five mishaps explained precisely why Russia <i>is</i> the country
of the Five-Year Plan.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when there was no boat waiting at the end
of the journey, I discussed the question more calmly with an
intelligent young Jew, who fully understood my detestation for the
machine cult. He replied that to appreciate its meaning, I must
realize what the Russians had gone through during the period of
Civil War, the Intervention, and the great famine. When the first
party of foreign tourists reached Leningrad in 1926, forty cars
were needed to transport them to Tsarskoe-Selo. Forty pre-war cars
were collected, and twenty-five more to act as a reserve. Even so,
that party failed to arrive at Tsarskoe-Selo, which is about twenty
miles away. He said that when, some time later, the first new cars
that had been seen since the Revolution arrived from America,
crowds followed them in the streets in order to touch them, as
though a Cardinal were in progress with his ring outstretched. He
himself had been among them. And though he smiled at the memory, he
still treasured the rapture he had experienced on seeing the first
Russian-made lorry actually in movement. Then he went on to speak
of his father, a poor nep-man, who had been taken away and never
seen again after the reversal of the New Economic Policy. What a
restricted life he had led, immersed in his family and his little
business. Now here was his son, my friend, partaking in great
events, mover in a great world force&mdash;though only a tourist
guide. He was happy; I have never known anyone more content. Yet
this youth, who had placed a sacramental finger on the first Ford
car, was as impatient and active as myself in climbing about
rickety scaffoldings in the biting cold to study the
fourteenth-century frescoes of the Novgorod churches.</p>

<p>Those who see fit, like I did and still do, to loose their gibes
at the Russian cult of the machine, should recall England of the
'forties and 'fifties. Let them read Macaulay's panegyric on his
country's factories and railroads, couched in the language of an
artist before the Parthenon; and having read, let them envy rather
than despise a country that can still enjoy, in the twentieth
century, that blend of assurance, novelty, and excitement which
produced our own greatness in the nineteenth. We have had time to
profit by the mistakes of our native materialists, our Victorian
rationalists and economists. So perhaps will the Russians also
profit when the time comes. Meanwhile the air is fresh and
stimulating. The intelligentsia of Russia, both the survivors of
the old and the children of the new ages, are victims of every
disadvantage that dogmatism and jealousy can invent. But they
escape, notwithstanding, the one supreme disadvantage that can
afflict an intelligentsia&mdash;that of lethargy and
complacence.</p>

<p>Last, and most precious of possessions, they have still their
own country. They have escaped the desperate fate of the
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s.</i> I met one lady in Moscow, the avowed
survivor of an old Russian family, who had recently married a
foreigner, and, having obtained his nationality, was able to leave
Russia and visit her friends of the old days in Paris and Riga.
This lady has suffered much from the Bolsheviks&mdash;particularly
during the last two or three years. But she assured me that after
experience of the mental Bourbonism by which her old friends
sustain their lingering hopes of a restoration, she was glad to
think she still lived amid the fears and discomforts of Red Moscow.
Because she was still a patriot, they ended by regarding her as a
traitor. It is this patriotism which, above all else, makes the
lives of educated men and women in Russia to-day still worth
living.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-3"></a>III. THE RUSSIAN AESTHETIC</h3>

<p>It has already been explained that the antagonism between Russia
and the West is more than a conflict between principles of
ownership and industrial morality. The word 'Bolshevism', divested
of those flesh-creeping associations so gallantly propagated by the
Tory imagination, represents not merely an economic system, but a
fundamental way of thought inherent in the Russian species. To this
way of thought has been added an abstract and all-embracing
philosophy, which was consciously and sensibly elaborated by Lenin
as an instrument of revolution and which bears the name of
Dialectical Materialism.</p>

<p>The basic proposition of this creed is that everything
perceptible to the senses is real and that everything real holds in
itself the germ of organic change. Such a doctrine is in essence
mystical, in that it opposes the physical or chemical explanations
of change, and therefore of life, put forward by mechanistic
thinkers. It thus contains a great and practical truth and is well
adapted to its present function&mdash;that of a religion whose
outward manifestations have already been shortly described. But
behind it, and more important to the understanding of Bolshevism's
uneasy relations with the outer world, is that immemorial Russian
sentiment of a cosmic national egoism which demands the
regeneration of the mass rather than of the individual and produces
introspection on a sacrificial scale. At the end of the last
century, when Russian literature began to receive the fulsome
appreciation of Western Europe, the implications of this sentiment
were hardly realized. As a theme for Dostoievsky it was superb. As
a theme for translation into practical politics it was not taken
seriously, save in the sphere of Central Asia, where the fears of
Anglo-Indian strategists were many set at rest by the Anglo-Russian
Convention of 1907. Our affinity with Russia was with Russian
artists, not with the visionaries whom those artists portrayed. Now
the visionaries have become men of affairs. Their kingdom is of
this passing, empirical moment, and they would like to include us
in it. To this desire we do not agree.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the aesthetic genius of the race, which once inspired
us with admiration, still persists, and will flower
again&mdash;though whether in the immediate or the distant future
is hard to prophesy. The reader in search of observations on this
genius may feel by now that to have been lured, as he has been,
into a maze of political and economic considerations, is nothing
less than an abuse of this confidence. If he feels thus, I must ask
him to remember that modern Russian culture is still in its
embryonic stage&mdash;if indeed it has yet been conceived at all;
that the main interest it presents is rather as a field for
prophecy than as one of completed achievement; that even the embryo
is still obscured by the shell of a still mortifying past on which
has fastened the inevitable mushroom-crop of contemporary
plagiarisms; and that if the foreign observer is to discern any
sign of original life, he must seek it primarily in a study of the
individual educated Russian and of the evolution he is now
undergoing. Of that evolution, of its attendant pains and mental
voltage, I have attempted some slight account.</p>

<p>To the traveller whose first stay in a new country is limited to
a month and a half, and whose view of it can therefore be only
cursory, the most easily apprehensible clue to the cultural genius
of its people is their native architecture. In the golden helmets
and onions of the churches, in the towered Kremlins, baroque
palaces, Empire streets, Revivalist museums, and ferrocrete
tenements, the history and character of the Russian people stand
revealed. I ask myself what future can come of so incongruous a
past and present as this diverse architecture symbolizes. And I
find answer in a permanent and impersonal factor, separable from
time and politics, which, for architecture in particular, must play
a decisive part in the eventual development of Bolshevist taste,
and on which all prophecy in that respect must be based. This is
the consistently unique tradition of colour and form displayed by
all the visual arts in Russia from the eleventh century onward.
Architecture, being the most functional of the arts, is essentially
the art of the mass. And it is in architecture that this tradition
must find life again or prove itself sterile and the culture of the
Revolution sterile with it.</p>

<p>The Russian aesthetic is often called, by the glib classifiers
of Western Europe, an Oriental one. Certainly it may have borrowed
a motive here and there from the Moslems and Chinese. But its
essential spirit is a purely Russian one. And such superficial
resemblances as its architecture or painting may display to those
of the East, derive from the fact that each has had the same
aesthetic problems to overcome. These lie, as always, in the
landscape. The Russian scene provides neither form, nor colour, nor
shadows of rich texture. Apprehensible form, gay colour, and rich
magnificence, must therefore be supplied by art. But the Russian
landscape is not merely negative. Its illimitable spaces and skies,
its limpid summer clouds, and its precise outline of detail against
the winter snow, all determine the manner in which its deficiencies
shall be filled by artifice. It holds a latent power which likes to
speak in terms of the grandiose and monumental. No difficulty is
too great, no scheme too vast, for this power to overcome. It plans
cities on a scale commensurate with the huge rolling rivers by
whose banks they stand. At the same time it employs the poetry of
field and village and the peasant love of fantasy. Somehow, by some
genius of the people, aesthetic order results: buildings are
grouped as though on a perpetual back cloth; paintings are
composed; the domestic arts are sane. The lyrical note is absent;
there is none of that intimate perfection which reaches to the
hidden places of the mind. All is open, fully apparent on a glance,
blatant even; there is no hidden measure, no economy of means; yet
all is within bounds and betrays a love of well-being which is not
dissimilar from that of our own prosaic isle.</p>

<p>For his means of architectural expression the Russian has always
borrowed the grammar of some foreign tongue and made it the basis
of a language entirely his own. The earliest was Byzantine, which
he enlarged, as he has enlarged everything, heightening the
churches out of all recognition and replacing the neat lead vaults
and saucer-domes of the Greeks with helmets and onions. These in
time he gilded, coloured, and patterned; he grouped them at
different levels; he multiplied them into forests or inflated them
singly to overwhelming dimensions. At length came the Tartar
invasion. Round these churches grew walls and towers of Tartar
pattern, to form the local Kremlins and fortified monasteries.</p>

<p>Then the Italians arrived, only to become more Russian than the
Russians themselves. Venetian Gothic, classical pillarettes and
arcades, machicolated balconies, elaborate rustications, and a
wealth of faience, all came to swell the Russian harmony, brought
by foreigners whose privileged position and adoption of Russian
aims made them the counterpart of the specialists employed under
the Five-Year Plan to-day. Released from the severe canons of their
own countries, they threw themselves headlong into the Russian love
of fantasy; they planned and they built with an emphatic
eccentricity which is rendered none the less coherent by virtue of
its very size. Far from being stifled by this foreign invasion the
native motives, the gay colours and ubiquitous bulbosities,
flowered anew like plants in a freshly manured garden. The
eleventh-century cathedral of St Sophia at Veliki Novgorod, built
under the direct influence of the Greeks, has less of a
specifically Russian character than the riotous and variegated
churches of the sixteenth century, built after two centuries of
Italian predominance, such as those of Yaroslavl or the Moscow
suburbs.</p>

<p>With the reign of Peter the Great, whom Lenin acclaimed as a
spiritual ancestor, a new and more systematic process of
Westernization began. Churches and the dwellings of the nobility
became baroque. Rastrelli, the architect of the Winter Palace and
Tsarskoe-Selo, covered Russia with stupendous belfries, towering
accretions of arches and pillars, but as intrinsically Russian as
the monasteries in which they stand. At length followed the Empire
style which the Russians, though still depending on Italians for
their original designs, made particularly their own. The ruthless
interminability of their official buildings grew till the eye
cannot grasp them. A Government colour-wash was invented, a flat
tawny yellow, against which pillars and ornament stand out in
white. Towers persisted, great spikes such as that of the Leningrad
Admiralty. At the same time a charming domestic architecture grew
up, massive and low-storeyed, as though the domestic architects
were still building with beams and tree-trunks for their pediments
and pillars. The ornament is bold but never florid in the German
way; the space is always so filled as to create either a pattern or
an almost exaggeratedly individual piece of design; there is always
meaning.</p>

<p>As the last century progressed the Russians, like ourselves,
fell victims to the prevalent revivalism. The most grotesque and
extraordinary structures resulted from the inspiration of so varied
a past; the palaces of the Wittelsbachs or the inventions of Sir
Gilbert Scott seem Palladian in their simplicity when compared with
these neo-Slav town-halls and Kremlinesque museums. Yet the innate
feeling of the Russian race for the monumental, its long practice
in the ordering of fantasy, its general lack of aesthetic
inhibitions and love of aesthetic plain-speaking, have invested
even these buildings with a virtue unknown to their contemporaries
in other countries, and one which, under the magic of snow, attains
almost to charm. This, of course, was the 'preliminary period of
imperialism'. Finally, as the Boer War broke, a blast of <i>art
nouveau</i> swept in from the West, to destroy the last vestiges of
sanity and taste; though in Russia even this style assumed a form
so freakish and preposterous as to rescue it from the smug
suburbanism of its manifestations elsewhere. Follows an interval of
ten years. When the curtain lifts there appear Lenin's tomb and the
graceless, but still monumental, concrete structures of the new
industrial era.</p>

<p>In the provision of colour, the Russians have always relied for
their effects on flat, cleanly outlined fields. The tints are
emphatic, almost elementary; but the natural taste of the people,
their skill in harmonizing and interweaving the various
colour-fields into a balanced rhythm, together with the gigantic
areas over which&mdash;in architecture at least&mdash;colour is
employed, prevent the dominance of that shallow folkiness which so
often strikes a false note in pictorial and photographic
reproductions. In this province more than any, the Russians have
retained their Byzantine inheritance, as the icons show; but here
again they have added their own principle of frank appeal to the
eye rather than the mind. How that principle, applied to
architectural colour, survived into the nineteenth century, may be
seen to-day in the streets of Leningrad, where the present
authorities have not only preserved and renovated the old
Government yellow (said to have been introduced by an Italian to
remind him of the sun), but are also engaged in restoring the
palaces of the nobility to their original gay state.</p>

<p>But colour in architecture must display something more than
gaiety alone. Without richness of texture and material it becomes
as tedious as an eternal pantomime. No people has understood this
precept better than the Russians, and no country has ever been more
naturally favoured with the means of acting on it. Gold leaf for
their domes they have always been able to afford. In the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries they lavished bronze and brass upon their
interiors and exteriors with the profusion that, in other
countries, attaches to stucco. But the glory of Russia, from the
builder's point of view, is her native quarries. The variety of her
marbles and glistering labradors, her close-grained porphyries and
granites, her stones of even finer texture&mdash;so fine that their
appearance when polished is almost metallic&mdash;and her
semi-precious varieties such as lapis and malachite, is
inexhaustible, and even yet has scarcely been exploited. No shade,
no texture that an architect can want, is lacking.</p>

<p>From conversations with various eminent architects in Moscow, I
gathered that an official architectural policy was now in process
of inception which will eventually withhold its approval from the
drab functionalism of the present era, and allow free play once
more to the native genius of the country. The outstanding example
of this genius, as it can and will be translated into the language
of Materialism, is the Lenin mausoleum by the architect Stchousev.
It achieves its success, as I have already mentioned, not by any
compromise with the past&mdash;for a more ruthless, more
uncompromising monument has scarcely been erected since the
Pyramids&mdash;but by the harmony of its colour with the old
surroundings. Before visiting the chief architects of Moscow, I had
inspected the plans submitted from all over the world for the new
People's Palace, which is to occupy the site of the Cathedral 'of
the late Redeemer' recently demolished by explosion. This site is
in the very heart of Moscow, and closely adjoins the Kremlin. Apart
from the utter poverty of inventive ability displayed throughout
the competition, I was concerned to notice that the designs were
one and all of that gasometer or packing-case type which may be
suitable to factories and even to tenements, but must inevitably
have disfigured the centre of Moscow beyond redemption if erected
on this site&mdash;as, indeed, the Tsik skyscraper on the other
side of the river has succeeded in doing already. On my stating my
apprehensions to the architects Stchousev and Grinberg, they both
replied that, though the prizes would be allotted as promised, it
had been decided to use none of the designs on account of those
very reasons I had put forward; that the authorities were now
casting about for ideas of a different character, being convinced
that the ferrocrete style of the present was entirely unsuited to
the dignity of a great capital or to the Russian scene; and that
one of the chief considerations in the choice of a new design would
be the use of colour and of the fine Ural stones, by which means
alone could a specifically modern building&mdash;which the People's
Palace must and ought to be&mdash;avoid discord with its
incomparable setting. There are those Russians, and plenty of them,
who are sufficiently antiquated in their modes of thought to regard
such discord as the very purpose of their artistic efforts. These
victims of Materialist novelty fail to distinguish between
'discord' and 'difference'. The first is mean. The second may be
mean. But it can also imply a contrast between equals in artistic
merit which provides the highest form of intellectual stimulus and
contains in itself a ground of harmony between the opposing
monuments. Let the new architecture be different by all means. But
first let it solve the problem of differing like a man instead of
like a naughty child. When, some years hence, the People's Palace
is at last erected, it will be possible to see how far Bolshevist
taste has progressed towards this solution, and how far the
aesthetic genius of the country has begun to recover from the
shocks of the last fifteen years.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-4"></a>IV. MOSCOW</h3>

<p>Upon the intellectual and aesthetic background which presented
itself to me, and which I have here tried to describe, I can now
impose the incidents of a personal journey and the treasures it
discovered.</p>

<p>The tourist goes to Spain to see Spain, or to Italy to see
Italy; but to Russia he goes to see Bolshevism. I went to Russia to
see Russia. When I say this, people find it obscure and want to
know whether the Five-Year Plan will succeed, as though I were an
engineer or an economist to tell them. The true intellectual, I
know, is equal to such questions. Having never so much as glanced
at a factory in his life, he commits himself to the Intourist
Travel Agency, spends three weeks gaping at belt-conveyors invented
in Detroit, and returns to proclaim the dawn of human happiness.
Meanwhile his opposite, the die-hard, sits at home brooding madly
over bugs in the butter. Behind this fog of enthusiasm and
prejudice, the Russia that was, is, and shall be has disappeared
from the world's view. Landscape, people, habits of mind and
behaviour, buildings, works of art, the new with the old, but seen
always in relation to one another&mdash;it is these, rather than
the arid spectacle of Socialist construction, that should provide
the traveller's entertainment.</p>

<p>But the average traveller does not want entertainment. He is out
for heaven or hell, Right or Wrong, and determined to find one or
the other. Personally, I found Bolshevism even less attractive than
the political systems of other countries, chiefly because it is
more obtrusive and more chauvinistic, and because it regards the
foreign visitor either as a subject for propaganda of the most
tedious kind, or, if that does not evoke serious response, as a
heretic to be regarded with profound suspicion. Nevertheless, taken
all in all, Russia can give much to the traveller who wishes to
enlarge his experience and knows how to do so by seeing things not
as he wishes them to be, but as they are. Past, present, and future
exhibit a continuous interaction, rapid and conscious as a film,
whose novelty and scale are equalled in no other part of the
contemporary world. I found little time for dislikes. I could only
observe and be thankful that such a spectacle had not been denied
me.</p>

<p>The proverbial traveller's tale has owed its greatest marvels to
the pomps of outlandish potentates, to rituals of ceremony and
manners employed to express the power of the one over the many.
To-day, the most fabulous of all tales relates the power of the
many over the one, and the absence, equally visible, not merely of
pomps and ceremonies, but of the amenities hitherto enjoyed
throughout the world by those born to wealth or rewarded with it.
Elsewhere, the social structure rises in pyramid form. In Russia
the pyramid has been inverted: the apex, now reduced to the
intelligentsia, has its nose in the ground; while on it balances
precariously a crushing horde of manual workers, invested with the
austere but not always undecorative symbols of their new
sovereignty. This gigantic base, now turned uppermost in mid-air
while the technicians below are seeking to build it a stable
foundation, itself rises in two steps. The topmost is that of the
politically conscious, the urban proletariat; the lower, that of
the politically angry, the peasants. But the topmost, though a
minority, has control. It provided the initial force that made the
great experiment possible; from its ranks is recruited the
Communist Party proper, which numbers about two millions and forms
an aristocracy of faith. This faith, in the ultimate success of the
experiment, inspires and then accomplishes the decisions of the
executives, central, federated, and provincial. The organism that
was born in the faith of one man&mdash;the faith of
Lenin&mdash;lives by faith; for material success is not yet
established. At present the faith is strong, and its fount is the
city of Moscow.</p>

<p>Thither, as to a new Jerusalem, come pilgrims from all quarters
of the earth&mdash;pilgrims to worship and pilgrims to inquire. It
needs only a first walk in solitude through the streets to realize
that here is a society whose like the world has never seen. Enter
the Kitai Gorod, the business and administrative quarter of the
town, at five o'clock on a winter afternoon, when the offices are
emptying. Streets are crowded; trams packed, and hung outside with
festoons of humanity. Everyone wears snow-boots; the feet move with
quick, short steps over the slippery hummocks of frozen snow. Only
when two groups start to cross the road from opposite sides and
collide in the middle beneath the nose of an oncoming tram does
general confusion result.</p>

<p>This busy throng is too busy. Impervious to human contact, it
jostles along in silence and with eyes fixed on the pavement, as
though each molecule were seeking to be at some destination before
its fellow. The sauntering foreigner is aware of a strange
isolation, a kind of negative hostility, emanating not from the
individual, who is generally pleasant when addressed, but from the
impersonal mass claiming power over him, the individual. Thus must
the Christian have felt in Constantinople during the sixteenth
century, when Islam was in the flush of arrogance. And this is the
first thing in Russia that the foreigner must realize, if he is to
see Russia truly: that unless he can subscribe not merely to a
reasoned belief in its aims, but to an inspired faith in the
doctrine and practice of Marxism as the one and only means of human
redemption: unless he can find within himself not only an
admiration for the courage of the Russian experiment and the
hardships endured in the testing of it, but a conviction that he
himself would willingly assist in the adoption of it by the rest of
the world: then, be he never so filled with a love of humanity in
general and of Russians in particular, he is nevertheless an enemy
of Russia and, while in Russia, is among enemies of himself.
Intellectuals of other countries have deceived themselves into
believing that there can be a meeting-ground half-way. This there
can never be. Sport, intellectual interests, humour, or the
remarkable amiability induced by vodka may provide a sort of
No-man's-land on to which both sides sally out to bury their tenets
and discover themselves to be members of the same species. But the
armistice must always be temporary. The countless books on Russia
issued during the last two or three years give a contrary
impression. But it is precisely because the tours on which their
authors embarked are simply a prolongation of this kind of
armistice over a given number of weeks that the impressions
conveyed by this literature are so radically misleading.</p>

<p>Before visiting Russia I had no preconception of this state of
affairs; in fact, the crazy propaganda circulated by Conservative
politicians had disposed me to think that personal contact would
soon overcome barriers which, I imagined, existed only in the
Conservative imagination. To find that those barriers existed also
in the form of a religious fanaticism which demands unquestioning
allegiance, and that the jargon of the Revolution, so grotesque
from a distance, was actually the rubric of a vital creed, came as
something of a shock, and compelled a certain admiration&mdash;for
who in these days can afford to despise those who know their own
purpose and follow it? Furthermore, it exercised, mentally, a tonic
effect. To me, an Englishman born to every advantage of inheritance
and opportunity that the modern world can offer, it seemed highly
refreshing to be regarded, suddenly, as the offspring of a
poisonous fungus. This is the joy of Bolshevism, from the
traveller's point of view: it washes away the layers of complacence
that accumulate through residence in the civilized&mdash;perhaps
too civilized&mdash;capitals of the West. At the same time it stirs
a new and combative faith in, the ultimate future of Western
civilization and a resolution never to sacrifice individual
integrity of thought in face of a hierarchy of Slav ideologues who,
having found a Saviour in the West as we found one in the East,
would plunge the world into a second Dark Ages that his gospel may
be put to the test.</p>

<p>Though stimulating to the mind, it might, you would think, prove
drab and depressing to the eye, this working-class state where all
property, amenity, quality, and reward have been reduced to the
level of the lowest common need. So it might, but for the
permanent, historic Russia which bears the new organism like a
puling infant at her breast. Mother and child are each other's
foil. Beyond all this crying and spilling of industrial milk lies a
grand country, loving things on a grand scale and adorned, first
and foremost, with a grand capital. Not Rome nor Paris can rival
the Red Square of Moscow in the beauty of its shape, colour, and
proportions. While as for the Kremlin itself, whose triangle of
crenellated rose-red walls forms a circuit of a mile and a half,
whose nineteen various but all unprecedented towers guard the
palaces, churches, and barracks that shelter both the treasures of
the past and the Government of the present&mdash;the Kremlin, as a
visible symbol of Russian history, lies altogether outside previous
visual experience, so magnificent is the scale on which colour and
fantasy are presented.</p>

<p>Away from the famous monuments, the shopping streets are at
first sight somewhat depressing. But what they lack in ostentation
they make up for by lacking also that semi-erotic, semi-snobbish
vulgarity which is essential to the advertisement and sale of goods
in the West. Those who knew the town twenty years ago recall with
regret the dashing troikas, the trays of flashing jewels, and the
shopkeepers bowing their clients to the threshold. To-day only the
most important thoroughfares are even properly paved and asphalted.
These have been scheduled as 'shock-streets', whose avowed purpose
is to impress foreigners with an illusion of prosperity; for the
Russians, despite their chauvinism, suffer from the vanity of a
d&eacute;butante on the international stage. The window displays,
miraculously achieved out of the most utilitarian objects, are
fairly cheerful; and the crowds of purchasers in the big stores
certainly give no impression of positive indigence, though their
faces wear a harassed look. The Torgsin shops are the great lure.
These were formerly reserved for foreigners, but have now been
opened to such Russians as can pay in foreign currency; while those
who cannot, gape enviously outside the window. Since Russians have
been permitted to receive money from friends or relations abroad,
millions have poured into this organization to help the Government
pay its foreign bills. These are the sole luxury shops, though the
luxuries are only such as an English working-man would consider his
due at the week-end holiday.</p>

<p>Except when I wanted a new pair of snow-boots or a tin of
biscuits for a journey, my interest in the Torgsin establishments
was confined to their antique departments. Fine icons, of course,
were to be expected. But the domestic taste of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries proved a complete surprise. Instead of the
florid plagiarisms of French elegance produced by Germany and
Central Europe in those periods, Russian furniture and objects of
virtue display a personality and a sense of quality as distinct as
those of contemporary England. There is a great love of splendour,
of colour and gilt, and a great use of ormolu and bronze in
conjunction with rare and unfamiliar woods, such as Karelian birch,
and with those superb close-textured Ural stones of which malachite
is at once the best known and least decorative. But a natural
instinct for good design prevents this richness from degenerating
into mere pretentiousness. Unfortunately, the management of Torgsin
have the strangest idea of current market values, and are so
determined that no one shall purchase a bargain that it is
impossible to purchase anything at all. On the other hand, the
second-hand bookshops, which abound, provide an inexhaustible
hunting ground, where the lavish pre-war publications of the St
Petersburg presses on Russian, Byzantine, and Central Asian
art&mdash;unobtainable elsewhere&mdash;may be had for about a
quarter of their market value. Rare English editions are sometimes
found, and in one shop I came on a series of magnificent aquatints
of St Petersburg by Patterson which were worth &pound;20 to
&pound;30 each before the war and were now for sale at
&pound;1:10s.</p>

<p>Though it is impossible to meet Russians except on specific
business, the Moscow day is pleasantly varied. The first difficulty
is to determine what day it is, since the names of our seven-day
week have fallen into abeyance. You use the date, and when it
happens to be divisible by six, you realize that the day is a
holiday and all business is suspended. If, however, you succeed in
remembering when the Christian Sunday falls, you can visit the
private markets. The larger of these is the Sukharevsky, generally
known as the flea market&mdash;for obvious reasons. I went with the
daughter of the Norwegian Minister, who displayed the prowess of a
prize-fighter as we clawed our way through the mob. It was
literally a question of clawing; for as the ground was of frozen
snow, very uneven and covered with an inch of water, the upright
position was made possible only by the absence of space in which to
fall down. If, after one had hit two or three obstructionists
sharply in the ribs, the crowd happened to part, one either lurched
forward on to one's enemy's neck or fell grovelling at his feet.
Half the crowd were vendors; the other half, purchasers. The
vendors just stand, gazing into eternity, and holding their wares
at shoulder level. And what wares! Torn camisoles, threadbare
goloshes, soiled shirt collars were the subject of protracted
negotiation. One man, as we passed, thrust a single spat at us. My
companion told me she had heard&mdash;though she could not
absolutely vouch for it&mdash;that on one occasion a vendor had
been seen whose only commodity was the ace of spades. Eventually we
reached a row of photographers' booths. Though we shrank, in the
interests of hygiene, from the scarlet-and-gold Cossack uniforms
which sitters were in the habit of donning, the backcloth of an
Italian garden, with a Zeppelin hovering above the cypresses, was
not to be resisted. We posed ourselves before an apparatus like a
Heath Robinson incubator, and the result was one which those who
have been privileged to see it will not forget.</p>

<p>From the Sukharevsky we proceeded to the Arbat market, a smaller
enclosure, where the dispossessed classes sell such treasures,
icons, lace, and jewellery, as they have still retained. Here we
met the director of the Antique department of Torgsin, who was
also, like us, in search of bargains. Thence we took a tram. This
statement may seem uninteresting. But the action itself resembled
the Eton wall-game. After several sorties had been repulsed with
severe casualties, we boarded the driver's platform, where only
pregnant women are allowed. A little old man then slammed the door
on my companion's arm, who was thus pinned like Jane Douglas
defending her king. 'Damn you,' I said in English, very angry,
'what do you want to do that to a woman for?' 'Now, now,' replied
the offender, also in English, 'you mustn't talk like that, because
I understand everything you say. Please forgive me. I am blind.' At
this I was filled with remorse, and to make amends we saw the poor
old man off the tram at his destination, and put him on his right
road.</p>

<p>That evening I went to the Metropole, in bachelor company, to
'see life'. Unlike India, where one cannot appear outside one's
bedroom after dark except in evening dress, this entailed changing
back out of a bourgeois dinner-jacket into a proletarian
lounge-suit. On arrival at the hotel, we proceeded into an
apartment like the Crystal Palace. At intervals over this gigantic
hall stood enormous lamp-posts bearing each a basket of two or
three hundred naked electric-light bulbs. On a dais thirty Gipsies
were exhibiting voice and leg with that artificial verve peculiar
to the modern cabaret. In the middle of the floor a fountain was
plashing monotonously into a piscine tenanted by gyrating carp,
whose movements were obscured by a sudden movement of coloured
lights. This coincided with the arrival of the dance band. In
company with a few others I took the floor with a girl from the
Leningrad ballet. Later we moved to the bar, a stupendous
perspective of bottles (and cyclamens in bows) which even Shanghai
might envy. Behind this the barmaids of Renoir and Toulouse-Lautrec
had come to life, so perfect of their type, so bewitchingly plump
and peach-like, so masterfully coy, that they might have been
trained for the part by Mr Cochran, made up by Mr Clarkson, and
posed by Professor Reinhardt.</p>

<p>It was half-past three before we emerged into the silence of the
snow-covered streets and the biting cold air. Across the Opera
square we descried an <i>izvostchik</i> asleep on his sledge. He
sat huddled in his great blue coat, with icicles twinkling on his
beard. We woke him, settled ourselves under the rug, turned the
corner by the Historical Museum, and galloped on to the Red Square.
Above Lenin's tomb the red flag floated from a green dome over the
rose-red Kremlin walls, symbol of the sleeping Muscovites'
dominion. But they were not all asleep. As we reached the river a
party of five came swaying up a side-street, playing a balalaika
and singing softly to the night as though it were June and they
nightingales.<br>
<br></p>

<p>My weeks in Moscow passed like a single day, so great was their
variety. The resident foreigners proved a source of unfailing
hospitality and entertainment&mdash;journalists rushing out to get
their despatches censored by the Foreign Office, diplomats engaged
in a civilized existence of their own, disciples of Marx ploughing
their way through Lenin's commentaries on the Master, together with
such isolated phenomena as Mr Chattopadaya, brother to Mrs Sarojini
Naidu, complaining of the leniency displayed by the secret police
towards its, and his, political enemies, or Albert Coates in his
suite at the Metropole, lying in bed beneath a rubber-tree and
offering all corners a glass of Caucasian wine. Plays, operas,
concerts, and ballets filled the evenings; I came to know the
subterranean labyrinths of the Bolshoy Theatre, with their
refreshment counters for tea and cakes, as well as those of the
Queen's Hall. In the audiences, the women wore homemade frocks of a
pattern two years old, over which, if pretending to elegance, they
draped silk shawls. Among the men, the high boots and blouses that
were the rule three years ago had been displaced by nondescript
lounge-suits of dungaree cut and hue and by collar and tie. The
proletariat is becoming bourgeois&mdash;but how bourgeois I
realized only on learning that the sole industrial undertaking of
the Five-Year Plan whose output is so far up to schedule is the
Leningrad spat factory.</p>

<p>One Saturday night we drove to the Dragomilovsky Church in the
suburbs, where a crowd of two thousand had assembled to hear the
singing. As an antidote, next day I sought the Anti-God Museum,
where photographs of Sir Henri Deterding, the Pope, and an Oxford
friend cranking up a lorry during the General Strike, typified the
forces of reaction. I visited the Kremlin, saw the superb
collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean silver, and an English coach
of 1625 covered with velvet, the vestments brought from
Constantinople by the Metropolitan Photios in 1414, the ivory
throne that came from Italy with Sophia Palaeologina when she
espoused the Tsar Ivan III in 1467, the countless copes of Persian
and Broussa velvets, and such masterpieces of Royal taste in the
twentieth century as a platinum train in an Easter egg to
commemorate the opening of the Trans-Siberian Railway, or a female
leg in a high-heeled shoe carved out of agate and encircled with a
diamond garter. I made my way through the churches and palaces, was
shown the tiny apartments, already familiar from their enlarged
version on the stage, where Boris Godunov played with his children,
and at length, as I passed between the sentries on my way out, all
but collided with Kalinin, the President of the whole Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>

<p>Finally, on my last morning in Moscow, a party assembled at the
State Bank to see the Crown Jewels. Elaborate precautions were
taken as we marched through the vaults. Our coats were left behind.
An armed guard tramped before and behind. Eventually we reached a
small room where the whole of the imperial regalia lay flashing in
glass wall-cases or set out, for personal touch, on a table covered
with a green cloth. Fine jewels have always excited me. But to see
the crown of Catherine, a trellised bulb set with five thousand
matched diamonds, supported by buttresses of matched pearls as big
in diameter as a cigarette, and surmounted by a ruby the size of a
pigeon's egg&mdash;to see this object, which cost
&pound;10,400,000, within an inch of my nose, almost deprived me of
speech. On recovering, I turned to the table and began fingering
the insignia of the Order of St Andrew, of which the collar,
composed of platinum and small diamonds and made in Genoa in 1776,
was of exquisite design and workmanship. The guide was droning
monotonously in a corner; the guard outside continued to stroke its
revolvers; when suddenly the lights fused and I found myself
standing in total darkness with the Andreyev collar in my hand. I
dropped it like a hot cinder. Angry voices sounded outside, the
officials from the Foreign Office set up a clucking of disturbed
hens, and a roar of laughter went up from the visitors. After a
quarter of an hour, during which I was much tempted to slip an
ear-ring or two into somebody else's pocket, the lights went on
again. So demoralized by this time were the nerves of our guards
and guides that, when I left before the others, to keep another
appointment, I was allowed to wander alone and at will through
vaults filled with sacks of money, till at last, unchallenged and
unnoticed, I found my way out into the street.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-5"></a>V. LENINGRAD</h3>

<p>The difference between Moscow and Leningrad is the difference in
visible terms between the historic alternatives that have always
confronted the Russian State: sufficiency from within or attraction
from without. At present the balance is in favour of the former,
and Moscow is again the capital. Leningrad stands as a memorial to
the dominion of Western ideas in Russia during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries and to a last efflorescence of Anglophil
liberalism, whose hope centred in the Duma and which failed, when
the autocracy evaporated in 1917, to establish democracy in its
stead. This failure resulted in the establishment of a new
autocracy, sustained by a new orthodoxy and a new phase of mental
isolation. While the Kremlin at Moscow exhales a paradoxical
sympathy with this renewal of old tradition, Leningrad seems out of
joint with Bolshevism and wears a sad air, as though mourning for
an interlude which is past. Yet the town remains the most perfectly
planned and most impressively classical city in Europe, and its
beauty is a supreme monument to the individual genius of the
Russian aesthetic.</p>

<p>It is customary to imagine the 'Palmyra of the North' as a
purely Western city, planned in straight lines and executed in a
variety of classical styles. Certainly the streets are mostly
straight and the architectural styles borrowed from those of
contemporary Europe. But the Kremlin of Moscow was built largely by
Italians, and is yet the very essence of Russian imagination. Nor
is Leningrad any less so. Since Russians demand of architecture
colour, ornament, and, above all, a prodigious scale, Western forms
are made to serve these ends, heightened by a kind of emphatic
eccentricity which is often fantastic in the manner of John Martin
or Rex Whistler, but never quaint in the manner of Nuremberg. Thus
Leningrad is a city not of architectural units but of architectural
landscapes, and landscapes which, if so hackneyed a distinction may
be applied to so unusual a subject, are romantic rather than
formal, despite their groves of pillars and boscage of applied
trophies. The merit of this immense ostentation is its patent
honesty. The national megalomania, combined with a sure instinct
for bold, frank design, leaves no room for pretty vulgarity. Its
expression may be conscious, and have become, in latter years,
allusive. But it is never inhibited, like the Milan railway
station. To walk about the streets of Leningrad is to enjoy more
good building, more general and more immediately apprehensible,
than is provided by any of the world's large capitals.</p>

<p>I cannot claim that my walks were more than casual, or that I
devoted any particular attention to any particular building. Tired
of sight-seeing in Moscow, I looked forward to a few days' coma.
Actually, the interlude proved too interesting to be comatose. It
began with the most unpredictable event: the train arrived, not of
course on time, but before it. Consequently, the car from the
Consulate had not yet reached the station. We had recourse to an
antique vehicle which, though petrol-driven; stank like a growler
and moved more slowly than any horse. Neither of us knew the
address of the Consulate; but the driver thought he did, and dumped
us on the threshold of a decayed hostelry called the Hotel
d'Angleterre. A passer-by then said our destination was opposite
the Kazan Cathedral in the Nevsky Prospect. So thither we returned,
and had the pleasure of paying &pound;4 for this circuitous
adventure. The block where His Majesty's representative lives is
owned by the Finnish Government&mdash;a tolerable landlord, he
said. The windows look on to the cathedral, built in 1801, whose
curving colonnades produce a miniature imitation of St Peter's
piazza.</p>

<p>A little way below the Consulate, where the River Moika crosses
the Nevsky Prospect&mdash;or Prospect of the 25th of October, as it
is now called, in celebration of the 'November'
Revolution&mdash;stands the Stroganov Palace, designed by Rastrelli
in 1752, whose baroque fa&ccedil;ade displays white pillars on a
lilac background. At the opposite corner, across the river, I
noticed another building of a rich delphinium blue, also picked out
in white. These colours have lately been restored by the present
municipal authorities. The commonest of them, and not the least
attractive, is the rich matt tawny yellow formerly employed on all
the Government buildings and lately renovated to its original
freshness. The Kremlin, I had thought, must always be the climax of
Russian invention. But in Sakharov's Admiralty the voice of the
Kremlin spoke again, in 1823. This interminable building is more
than a quarter of a mile in length, and diversified with six
porticoes, two of twelve pillars each upholding highly decorated
pediments, and four of six. In the middle is a massive archway,
almost horseshoe in appearance, flanked by two groups on pedestals
of women upholding globes, and surmounted by a tower 229 feet high.
This fantastic projection takes the form of a slender gilt spike,
supported on a dome and upholding a ship of appreciable size in
full sail. The dome rises from a square Empire colonnade, on top of
which stand a row of statues. All the pillars, the panels of
ornament and friezes, the rustication of the base, the keystones of
the windows, and the triglyphs of the cornices stand forth in white
against this gorgeous autumn yellow. No less enormous, and in the
same colour, are the buildings of the General Staff, placed in a
shallow curve opposite the Winter Palace; these have no tower, but
are broken by a triumphal arch on which the ornament is in bronze.
Across the huge Uritzky Square, where the massacre of 1905 took
place, the Winter Palace itself appears as though on a distant
horizon. This, again, was built by Rastrelli, but is now a drab
brown. I suspect he intended it to be pink.</p>

<p>With the exception of the cathedral of Esztergom in Hungary,
that of St Isaac in Leningrad affords the sole example of the
Empire style used for ecclesiastical purposes on the grandest
scale. Designed by Montferrand in 1817, its form is that of a cube
whose four sides have each a portico. The pillars of these
porticoes are monoliths of pink Olonetz granite, rising from bronze
bases and terminating in bronze Corinthian capitals. The stone is
grey, but a plain course of granite runs round the base on a level
with the bottom of the pillars. At each corner of the parapet
massive groups of bronze angels uphold stupendous torches, while
gilt cupolas, supported on clusters of pink pillars, rise in pairs
behind the east and west pediments. Above all towers the central
dome, 330 feet high, resting on a tall drum encircled by a
colonnade and topped by a ring of statues. Though the detail is of
the most rigid classical kind, severe to the point of soullessness,
the whole effect is one of extreme magnificence, which only Russia
could have produced.</p>

<p>Sated with these overpowering monuments, we sought refuge in the
Hermitage, which must contain more square miles, worse hung, of
Domenichino and his like, than any gallery in the world. The Van
Eyck 'Annunciation', the Botticelli 'Adoration', the Rembrandt of a
'Polish Nobleman', the Velazquez of 'Innocent III', and the
'Wharton' Van Dyck are all gone, and have not yet, so far as I
know, reappeared on Mr Mellon's walls. But there are still forty
Rembrandts left, which is enough for anyone, and was more than
enough for me by the time I had tottered through a league or two of
Dutch interiors and turned with loathing from two false Grecos.
Tucked away in a corner I found a curious little English gallery,
where mediocre pictures by Morland, Wright of Derby, Lawrence,
Raeburn, and Romney are interspersed with decaying sideboards and
broken chairs. These give a poor idea of our culture in the early
imperialist period. But I must say, in all justice, that here were
none of those absurd notices which disfigure the French collection
in Moscow.</p>

<p>Later in the day, accompanied by Professor Waldhauer and an
armed guard, we saw the famous collection of early gold ornaments,
which has no rival in any museum. Part are Scythian, huge
lobsterish beasts a foot long, whose design resembles nothing
produced by any other race and whose material is almost butter-like
in its glowing softness. Part have an Iranian look, typified in
bicephalous bracelets and familiar from our own Oxus treasure. And
part are Greek, from the Chersonese, of most exquisite workmanship
and design. From these we proceeded to the collection of antique
statuary, which has been much enriched from former private
collections. Professor Waldhauer begged us to notice a life-like
portrait bust of a Roman Jewess.</p>

<p>The following day we forsook art for history, starting with the
Square of the Victims of the Revolution, a former parade ground
known as the Champ de Mars, in whose midst a granite quadrilateral
surrounds the common grave of 180 Red heroes. On the granite is
carved an inscription written by Lunacharsky in ballad Russian and
said to be very moving. Hence we drove to the old British Embassy,
now 'the Institute of Political and Communistic Education in the
name of Krupskaya'. Here, among the tattered brocades, I caused
consternation by mistaking a picture of Kalinin, the President of
the Union, for one of Trotsky, and asking, in a voice of assumed
indignation, how they dared expose such an object to their pupils.
Crossing the Neva, we reached a small wooden church, built by Peter
the Great, where a service was in progress attended by some fifty
persons. Adjoining, our attention was pointed to the most hideous
yellow brick structure, in a garden, the palace of the ballerina
Kzeczinska, mistress to the Tsar. This house aroused popular fury
at the time of the Revolution, and it was here that Lenin was
conducted from the station after his famous journey in the sealed
train, and took up his headquarters. After passing a mosque with a
fluted dome of blue tiles in the style of Samarcand, and looking in
at the mansion of a former rubber merchant, now a rest-house, where
a multitude of deserving workers were playing chess beneath a
somewhat fortuitous bust of the Saviour, we came to the fortress of
Peter and Paul.</p>

<p>This renowned symbol of Tsarist tyranny, so glibly coupled with
the adjective grim, has externally the mellow appearance of an old
colonial fort, while, inside, it resembles the courtyard of a
country brewery. An old fashioned, rather dilapidated building,
which it is forbidden to approach with a camera, is the Mint of the
Soviet Union. Inside the cathedral, whose gilt spire, 390 feet
high, is one of the most remarkable objects in Russia, are the
imperial tombs; outside, a blue pavilion houses a carved boat known
as the grandfather of the Russian fleet&mdash;a thing of sorry
posterity in this generation. Behind the Mint, a sort of rambling
farmhouse contains the famous prisons, now inhabited by realistic
wax models in attitudes of profound despair. I could not help
inquiring when it would be possible to visit the 'cold chambers' of
the present GP under similar conditions. Not that I supposed that
Russia could, can, or ever will be governed without institutions of
this kind. But the hypocrisy of thus rigging out the evils of the
past because they were committed in the name of a crown instead of
a hammer was too irritating to be borne in silence. Thereafter our
guide, a man of intelligence, ceased his futile rote of moral
tales.</p>

<p>My companion had had a cousin attached to the old Embassy, who
died in 1916 and lies buried in the Lutheran cemetery on the
Vassily Island. Since he was anxious to identify the grave and see
what condition it was in, we drove to this desolate necropolis
lying in a semi-built district of tenement houses. While the others
sought information, I wandered alone through a forest of graves
covered with snow and overhung with dank trees. Now and then some
old lady in black would trudge slowly past, carrying a wreath of
mauve flowers. Amid the lavish mausoleums of the past, with all
their urns and pillars and funerary vulgarity, the new graves told
of a simpler, harder age. A heap of fresh cut fir branches, or a
wooden stele painted scarlet and marked with the Soviet
star&mdash;these were the memorials of the present, and told also
of the virtues of their age. They reminded me of soldiers' graves
and of the fact, too easily forgotten, that every Russian to-day is
engaged in a battle for soul and body whose like we in Western
Europe can hardly conceive.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The streets and squares of Leningrad have not only good
architecture, but poignant associations. In them were achieved the
twin Revolutions of March and October. The ideas which produced
that upheaval germinated in the previous century. But the history
of its actual events dates from the night of 16 December by the Old
Style, 1916, when the deputy Purishkevitch, drunk with his own
heroism, proclaimed to a bewildered policeman that Rasputin was
dead and Russia saved.</p>

<p>Fifteen years and a fortnight later I was walking by the side of
the narrow, frozen River Moika, through the Mayfair of old St
Petersburg. 'Our house on the Moika,' writes Prince Yusupov in his
account of the affair, 'was chosen as the place where our project
was to be carried out.' And unchanged the house on the Moika still
stands, a long perspective of yellow stucco with the ornament
picked out in white. Above the entrance a coat-of-arms on the attic
storey recalls the magnificence of the family of
Yusupov-Sumarokov-Elston. But below this, two placards, bearing
white letters on a red ground, inform the passer-by that here may
now be found the Club for Scientific Workers and the Club for the
Trade Union of Educationalists. The afternoon was sad and dark.
Nevertheless, I experienced, as always in Russia, that
incommunicable exhilaration associated with a first sight of scenes
often and untruthfully imagined.</p>

<p>It happened that my guide was a member of one of the clubs now
contained in the palace, and he thought that, though foreigners
were not usually admitted, an exception would be made in my case. A
fat comrade, golden-haired and rubicund, greeted us with effusion,
then galloped up the main staircase to switch on the several
hundred lights of the central chandelier. Dazzled by the blaze, we
proceeded to the state rooms on the first floor, through double
doors of mahogany set with ormolu rosettes, through room after
room, each richer than the last, furnished in the manner of palaces
with silk hangings and gilt cupids, with tables of agate and
porphyry, aubusson settees and chairs of Spanish leather, and
mantelpieces of porcelain and malachite. Through the small and the
big ballrooms we went, through the picture gallery, and down into
the miniature theatre, a rococo auditorium about fifty feet long,
lined with three tiers of boxes. Prince Yusupov himself could not
have exhibited more pride in his surroundings than did our guide,
who begged us to note how the precious chairs were kept in
dust-sheets. On reaching the theatre he jumped on the stage and let
down a drop-curtain depicting the Yusupov country house as though
it were his own.</p>

<p>Only two or three of the state rooms were occupied. In one of
them we found an artist who had just returned from a scientific
expedition to Kamchatka and was hanging a series of landscapes
illustrating the behaviour of volcanoes in those parts. Since he
looked under-fed, I asked if he hoped to sell many. 'Certainly
not,' he replied. 'The workers must not be deprived of culture.'
Half of the pictures would go to the institute that had financed
the expedition; the other half would remain his. Then his dream was
to hold an exhibition abroad.</p>

<p>On returning to the ground floor, a series of passages led us to
the winter garden, where the Scientific Workers and the Trade Union
of Educationalists were eating soup. Beyond this was a
billiard-room copied from the Alhambra, and beyond that the
apartments of old Prince Yusupov, where they had recently
discovered a safe under the floor. I asked about the great hoard of
treasure that had been found walled up in the palace three or four
years ago, and our guide replied that the whole place was
honeycombed with secret passages. In fact, only the other day a
workman had lurched into the building drunk and said he could show
them some new ones, which he himself had built. But next day, when
he returned sober, he had been unable to find them after all.</p>

<p>The way now led through a series of locked doors and empty
rooms, till suddenly we found ourselves in a small octagon about
ten feet across and eight feet high. Each of the eight sides
consisted of a wooden door painted white and inset with a broad
panel of plate glass, behind which was a curtain of frilled blue
silk. One door led into a still smaller bathroom, beyond which was
a no less diminutive bedroom. The walls of both these sinister
little apartments were thickly padded. A second door revealed a
plain square room with two windows looking out on the Moika. This
was now used as a military class-room; there were posters on the
walls of tactical exercises, first-aid, and how to affix your
gas-mask; a rifle on a stand was pointing into the street. A third
door opened on to a cavern of darkness. But the other doors gave
access to blank walls only, so that, once in the octagon, it was a
matter of some minutes to find which door provided a way out of it.
In addition, I had noticed that one of the previous doors leading
to the octagon had had to be carefully propped open, as it was
self-locking.</p>

<p>These were Prince Yusupov's private apartments, and here came,
on the night of 16 December,1916, the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovitch,
Purishkevitch, and Dr Lazovert. The headquarters of the conspiracy,
so to speak, were in the room looking out on to the Moika. Here Dr
Lazovert placed crystals of cyanide of potassium in the chocolate
cakes and the wine-glasses. But the scene of action was across the
octagon in that black void. Peering in, I saw a tiny spiral
staircase, barely two feet wide. The guide asked me not to descend,
as it was slippery and dangerous. But I persisted, and found a
cellar divided by an arch and covered in six inches of water; for a
thaw had set in. From high up in the wall came a glimmer of
daylight. According to Prince Yusupov, this dank apartment 'had
originally formed part of the wine cellar. In day time it was a
rather dark and gloomy chamber, with a granite floor, walls faced
with grey stone, and a low vaulted ceiling...I ordered some antique
furniture to be brought down from the storeroom.' A large fire was
lit. From the roof hung lanterns with coloured glass panes.
Purishkevitch has also left an account of the proceedings. 'La
chambre &eacute;tait m&eacute;connaissable. Je l'ai vue pendant les
travaux et je fus frapp&eacute; par cette transformation
compl&egrave;te d'une cave qui en un si bref d&eacute;lai
&eacute;tait devenue une &eacute;l&eacute;gante
bonbonni&egrave;re.'</p>

<p>Prince Yusupov, borrowing the Grand Duke's car, went to fetch
Rasputin and arrived back with his guest about one o'clock. 'The
prospect of inviting a man to my house with the intention of
killing him horrified me,' observes the Prince in his book. 'I
could not contemplate without a shudder the part which I should be
called upon to play&mdash;that of a host encompassing the death of
his guest.' A nasty complacency lurks beneath these protestations.
But the conspirators had worked on one another's emotions till they
had reached the state of Messianic exaltation which accounts for
most things in Russian history. All Russians are saviours by
vocation. These three, thinking to deliver the imperial throne of
an unholy counsellor, merely precipitated the extinction of all
they hoped to rescue.</p>

<p>On entering the house, host and guest crossed the octagon and
descended by the spiral staircase to the cellar. There Rasputin ate
the cakes and drank out of the poisoned glasses, while his host
played the guitar and sang. Upstairs, in 'the study', Grand Duke
and deputy waited. At length the Prince rushed in with the news
that the poison would not work. After some discussion, he took a
revolver and returned to the cellar. The others followed and stood
listening at the top of the stair. A report was heard and a thud.
The Prince emerged; the deed was done.</p>

<p>After an interval he returned to look at the body. As he did so
the face began to twitch and the eyes opened. Suddenly Rasputin
jumped to his feet and seized the youth by the throat. Yusupov
struggled, got away, and fled up the stairs, while the monk could
be heard crawling up them too on all-fours. But instead of making
for the octagon, Rasputin escaped by a door off the staircase into
the courtyard of the palace. Purishkevitch ran out after him, to
see the enormous figure lurching across the snow. 'Felix, Felix,'
Rasputin was shouting, 'I shall tell the Tsarina.'[*] Purishkevitch
shot twice and the figure collapsed. Meanwhile the Prince was being
sick in the bathroom. On learning that Purishkevitch had succeeded
after all, he seized a loaded stick and fell to battering the
corpse in a savage frenzy. Purishkevitch was much moved by this
spectacle. Then the police arrived, and they shot one of the best
dogs to give colour to the bloodstains and the other shots. The
dog's grave, said the guide, was still in the garden. We looked
out. But the garden had been flooded, to make a skating-rink for
the leisure of Scientific Workers and the Trade Union of
Educationalists.</p>

<blockquote>[* The authenticity of this exclamation, as recorded by
Purishkevitch, is doubted by those familiar with Russian parlance.
Rasputin, or anyone else for that matter, would normally have
referred to the Empress as 'Elizaveta Feodorovna'.]</blockquote>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-6"></a>VI. VELIKI NOVGOROD</h3>

<p>Beneath the organized frenzy of Bolshevist Russia to be up and
doing, the hospitable, easy-going country described by pre-war
travellers is no longer recognizable. Yet here and there, in places
which have escaped the industrial and political tornado of the last
fifteen years, the romance of 'Holy Russia' lingers on. Such a
place, it seemed to me, was Novgorod. And its romance, even to one
engrossed with the tradition of Constantinople, was not wholly
archaic or irrelevant to the present. For Russian civilization was
originally Byzantine; and from that source, given the conditions of
the modern world, Bolshevism is the legitimate descendant.</p>

<p>It was still dark at seven o'clock in the morning, and the air
biting cold, as the train steamed out on its way to Pskov, leaving
me behind on Novgorod platform. When the sledge was found, we drove
at a gallop through the sleeping streets, bounding over holes and
ditches, till a black line of crenellations cut across the dimly
paling sky and marked the Kremlin wall. An arch gave us entrance.
Still at a gallop, we swerved to the right, clattered through a
narrow tunnel, and drew up at the old Archbishop's Palace, now a
rest-home for scientists. Opposite, I recognized the silhouette of
St Sophia. Inside, a lamp-lit room awaited us, furnished
magnificently with a late Empire suite of Karelian birch mounted in
ormolu and upholstered in silk brocade of white floral pattern on a
crimson ground. The lavatory was clean; there was hot water to
shave with; I found a female comrade cleaning her teeth over the
wash-basin. For breakfast came coffee boiled with milk and sugar,
brown bread of the Hovis type, fresh butter, and cold cabbage-pie.
As the dawn crept in at the windows we could see the leaden onions
and golden helmet of St Sophia, static and impervious behind a
curtain of gently falling snowflakes. Against the creamy walls of
the cathedral, a line of low bare trees stood out from the dead
white snow with feathery precision, like the skeletons of pressed
ferns. As in the twentieth century, so it must have looked in the
eleventh. I was reminded of the white paint and formal
architectural backgrounds that appear in icons of the Novgorod
school; and was saying so to my guide when the proprietress came in
with registration forms. My passport? I had left it behind. She
pretended consternation, and, foreseeing an argument, I gave her my
English driver's licence and went out for a walk, leaving the
matter to resolve itself, which it did.</p>

<p>Veliki Novgorod is so called to distinguish it from the
<i>parvenu</i> Nijni Novgorod. In, the old days, so revered was
this capital of one of the first Russian city-states that
schoolboys were taught to say 'Gaspadeen Veliki Novgorod&mdash;Sir
Great Novgorod'. Towns in Russia that date from before the Tartar
invasion of the thirteenth century and retain anything of their
original character are comparatively few. Novgorod is the chief of
them and resembles in size and charm an English cathedral city such
as Salisbury, the centre of a large agricultural district and built
round a Kremlin instead of a close. As a respite from the nervous
tension of Moscow and Leningrad, from that scarifying political
excursion on which the whole nation is embarked and whose whither
no passenger can foresee, the memory of those two days spent in
climbing about the oldest churches in Russia stand out like a
month's holiday in a year of worry. When I asked our boy
sledge-driver which of the two Communist youth organizations he
belonged to, the Komsomols (scouts) or the Pioneers, and he replied
with a contemptuous 'Neither!' my content overflowed. I had found a
being indifferent to his own regeneration, and the world seemed
real again. The officials responsible for the preservation of the
monuments and paintings were evidently delighted that a foreigner
should witness the scholarly care bestowed on them. So few bothered
to come&mdash;only about two or three a year. Let me only say what
I wanted to see and facilities would be granted. It was a pleasant
change from the endless restrictions and formalities that harass
the traveller elsewhere.</p>

<p>My first visit was to St Sophia, built between 1045 and 1052 in
a style derived from Constantinople, but greatly heightened, and
strengthened with massive piers in place of the slender pillars
habitually used by the Greeks. The frescoes of the interior were
the work of a century later, but have been twice restored, in 1838
and 1893, so that nothing remains in its original state but a dull
fragment of Constantine and Helena. The most famous ornaments of
the church are its bronze doors, presumably dating from the twelfth
century. One pair, damascened and much polished, resemble the
Byzantine doors of this date; though the double crosses rising from
floriated bases seem to show Armenian influence. The other pair,
said to have been brought from Kherson, display a series of reliefs
whose iconography and style are of German inspiration. These have
Latin inscriptions. My attention was also pointed to the walls of
the bema, which are decorated with patterns of coloured stone and
glass faience arranged in the fashion of <i>opus alexandrinum.</i>
Built into the walls have been discovered a number of large clay
jars, which were placed there to give resonance to the
chanting.</p>

<p>A dark winding staircase and a succession of seven locked doors,
each of which necessitated a great deal of fumbling, argument, and
lighting of tapers, led to the Treasury, whose chief objects were
brought out of their glass cases for me to examine. The first was a
domed tabernacle of silver-gilt, eighteen inches high without its
cross, which was added in the seventeenth century. The dome is
supported on six nielloed pillars. Each of the six arches thus
formed is closed by double doors, which bear reliefs of the twelve
apostles. The fine workmanship of these reliefs displays a close
Byzantine influence; likewise that of the six medallions on the
dome. But the inscriptions, though Greek, are illiterate; and the
filigree panels above the doors have an Oriental character,
seemingly Armenian or Caucasian. Next followed a couple of massive
silver-gilt vases, about ten inches high, and decorated with
figures and vine arabesques in coarser relief. These, according to
the curator, are the earliest examples of purely Russian metalwork
in existence, and were made at Novgorod in the twelfth century
under Greek influence. Round the rim of each runs a Biblical
quotation; round the base, a legend ascribing the ownership of one
vase to 'Petrov and his wife Barbara', and of the other to 'Petrov
and his wife Mary'. The lettering is Slavonic. A fine Byzantine
cross, about two feet high and plated with silver-gilt worked in
chevron pattern, was also produced. The medallions on the three
arms and at their junction were added in the seventeenth century
and probably replaced others of enamel. Finally came an ivory
casket of the same date and style, and exhibiting the same borders
of rosettes and panels of dancing cupids as the Veroli casket in
the South Kensington Museum. I had begun to speculate as to whether
this might not have influenced the design of the vases just
described, when my notice was drawn to a huge gold lock, bearing
the cipher of a certain Grand Duke of Holstein. This Grand Duke
owed his throne to the Empress Elizabeth; and it is supposed that
at a meeting that took place between them in Finland he presented
it to her, and that she left it at Novgorod on her way back to the
capital. Thus it did not find its place among the other Byzantine
treasures of the cathedral till the middle of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>Scattered about the villages outside Novgorod are a series of
small churches of the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries. These
are humbler in style and decoration than their contemporaries in
the Kiev and Vladimir districts&mdash;for Novgorod was only a
merchant republic. But their box-like severity, the preponderance
of height over their other dimensions, and their massive wall
surfaces pierced by the fewest and smallest of windows, express
their function as outposts of culture and civilization in the
hostile north and give them an individual charm and interest. The
best known of them is that of the Saviour at Nereditsa, built in
1198 and preserving unrestored its frescoes of the same date.</p>

<p>To Nereditsa, therefore, which is five versts from Novgorod, I
said I must go. The sledge was waiting; but where Nereditsa was our
youthful driver could not say. A map was found, and with its aid we
made our way through the town, skidded down a steep bank, and found
ourselves on the ice of the great River Volhov, among a colony of
stranded paddle steamers. A wind cold as cutting steel stung the
grey horse to a fresh gallop. We skimmed along the ice as though it
had been the track at Brooklands, crouching sideways under the rug
with our backs to the driving snow. In the opposite direction came
other sledges, of heavier build, trailing in from the surrounding
villages a-heap with cabbages and straw. At one point a line of
stone piers forty feet high crossed the river, gaunt and
threatening in the snowscape. This was the new railway
bridge&mdash;though as yet there was neither railway nor bridge. On
the farther bank, a cluster of monastery domes broke the verge of a
distant forest which had once, said the driver, been the estate of
the Duchess Orlova. At length the church itself came in view,
perched on a knoll and overtopped by an immense bulbosity. By its
side stood a little bell-tower with conical roof. We struck uphill
from the river, over the fields, and came to a village whose wooden
houses were hung with fishing-nets and lobster-pots. Here we found
the keeper of the church, an old fellow in a grey beard, who said
that he and the other inhabitants of Nereditsa lived on an island
like the English. Inside the church, scaffolding led right up into
the cupola. If this failed to improve the architectural effect, it
did at least enable the visitor to examine this most famous of the
old Russian fresco-cycles at close quarters and in such comfort as
the cold permitted. This was a pleasant change from the
neck-breaking, hour-long scrutinies to which I have grown
accustomed in the monasteries of Mount Athos. The character of the
paintings resembled that of the 'popular' school which obtained in
the Levant and South Italy up till the thirteenth century. It was
curious to think that these frescoes, and I who was regarding them,
so to speak, through Levantine eyes, were now little more than a
hundred miles from the Gulf of Finland.</p>

<p>That evening my guide and I went to an entertainment. There was
a dance between a peasant girl and her beau from the town, a
flautist, and an ideological dialogue during which a professor of
comic aspect raised a general laugh by saying that science had
nothing to do with politics. For the next day we had planned a
longer expedition; and when morning came, instead of the old grey,
a dark brown mare stood harnessed to the sledge. This was a new
purchase of the proprietress, who was in a great fuss, crooning
'Princessa! Princessa!' as she stroked the creature's nose, and
admonishing the driver, this time a fully grown man, to take care
of her. But indeed she was worthy of the fuss; we trotted down the
street as fast as the grey had galloped, threading our way in and
out of the other sledges, while the passers-by stopped to look. Our
first stop was the Antoniev monastery, where a service was in
progress, conducted by a very old priest in a gold cope. The
candles were lit; the congregation numbered about a dozen. The old
priest tottered behind the iconostasis to find the keys of an older
church, in which a few fragments of uninteresting painting were
still visible. Thence we cantered along an embanked road, swept by
polar blasts, till we came to the village of Volotovo.</p>

<p>I was still in search of frescoes, and our first business was to
find the keeper of the church. The end house, we had been told. But
we drove to the wrong end, and then back again, along the broad
space between the double rows of wooden houses, each of which was
banked with hay on one side to keep out the prevailing wind. In
every garden stood tall poles, to whose tops nesting-boxes were
fixed. On reaching the right house, we found only two women at
home, who, though busy with household duties and gaping at the
foreigner's apparition, begged us to enter. This we did, through
the wood-shed, and sat in the kitchen-parlour. In one corner, by
the window, a lamp was burning before a group of icons. A row of
heavy coats hung on pegs near the stove, at which one of the women
continued her making of meat pies. I examined an apparatus, painted
with roses and steadied by the foot, for spinning yarn, while the
other woman searched for the keys. When ready, she seated herself
on my knee in the sledge, and we drove up to the church, whose
little pathway, graveyard, and surrounding trees reminded me of
England. Inside was another scaffolding, which I rather regretted,
since, unlike Nereditsa, services are still held here. On making
use of it, I regretted it still more; for as I stood perched in the
drum of the cupola, seventy feet from the stone floor and
chattering with cold, the whole structure began to rock. I made
hurriedly for earth, but was not half way down when a weird,
unaccountable rumble began to sound, distant at first, then growing
nearer and louder, till, as I reached the ground, a deafening roar
was heard right overhead. I rushed from the door and looked up. Out
of the leaden sky swooped four aeroplanes, painted dark military
grey with the red star beneath each wing, and so low that I could
see their pilots. In a flash they were away, sailing over the
shallow valley beyond the village and up into the sky again. I
turned to the country church, built 580 years ago, to the dark firs
shivering in the wind, and to the rows of crosses that might have
moved some Russian Gray to write another elegy. I watched the armed
power of the Soviet Union resolve into four specks and disappear.
The old and the new Russia, changing yet unchanged...Snow was
falling again, through the silent trees, piling the graves a little
higher.</p>

<p>In the town of Novgorod itself are several small churches dating
from the fourteenth century, of which those named after St Theodore
Stratilates and the Transfiguration particularly attracted my
curiosity. The architecture of these two represents a strange
fusion of Greek and German influences. While both are square in
plan and develop a Byzantine apse to the east, each wall of each
square finishes in a triangle supporting the eaves of a
double-sloped roof in the Western manner. From the midst of the
roof, on the other hand, at the intersection of its four ridges,
rises a Byzantine cupola. Inside, the vaults and arches of the
Greek tradition persist unaltered.</p>

<p>To the church of St Theodore Stratilates I gained access with no
difficulty and was able to study its paintings at my leisure. That
of the Transfiguration offered an unexpected rebuff. The door
proving unlocked, I pushed it open, and was about to enter the
nave, when like a tigress from her lair sprang a female comrade in
a scarlet beret and banged it in my face. After a minute or two, I
tried again. Again the maenad sprang; but this time I had implanted
knee and boot on the threshold, and she could only remain there,
chattering and snarling, while I examined her bulbous unlovable
visage and wondered, not that abortion had been legalized in
Russia, but that the occasion for it should ever arise. At length,
seeing that my strength was greater than hers and that I was
gradually edging my way in, she called for help and was joined by a
bearded Magog, whose added weight nearly broke my thigh and forced
me to retire. By now I too was in a rage; for it happened that I
wished to see the frescoes in this church above all others. Jumping
into the sledge, I galloped to the office of the Museum Committee
to protest. With genuine regret they told me that this church,
alone of all those in the district, was not under their control,
but was being restored by orders direct from Moscow. They were
therefore powerless to help me. Despite their courtesy, it was some
time before the nausea engendered by contact with so frightful a
variant of the human species had altogether evaporated.</p>

<p>I learned afterwards, by a devious means and under pledge not to
reveal the teller, that the work of 'restoration' then being
pursued by the maenad and her companion consisted in stripping the
gold off the iconostasis or altar-screen. Hence their reluctance to
allow a foreigner inside. How well this reluctance was justified
only appeared six months later. Nothing of course could have been
more sensible than to dismantle the iconostasis, if the church was
eventually to be restored and maintained primarily on account of
its frescoes&mdash;as was in fact the case; for the Orthodox
altar-screen, being very high, necessarily obscures many of the
most important compositions in Orthodox iconography. I happened,
however, to relate the story of my adventure and its cause to
various compatriots, more by way of making conversation about my
journey than with any other purpose. Consider my surprise
therefore, when in the following autumn I met a friend in the
hunting-field who had lately returned from diplomatic service in
Cairo, and who told me the last news he had had of me was my
'report that the desecration of churches was still continuing in
the Novgorod district'. I then understood what the maenad had been
instructed to understand, and why every foreigner of independent
movement in Russia is regarded as a potential agent of capitalist
propaganda.</p>

<p>The bill at the Archbishop's Palace was 225 roubles for two of
us for two days, of which food accounted for eighty, horses for
seventy, and 'organization' for twenty-five. We had just repudiated
the last item, and the proprietress had just opened some tinned
sturgeon as a peace-offering, when a man rushed in to say that the
train was leaving in twenty minutes, an hour earlier than he had
expected. Two sledges were waiting. Behind Princessa we galloped
once more through the dark streets, while the luggage followed with
the grey and the populace scattered as though the Apocalypse were
upon them. As the train puffed out of the station, it came to me,
as it comes to me now, that of all the places in Russia I shall
most wish to revisit, the chief is Veliki Novgorod.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-7"></a>VII. EARLY RUSSIAN PAINTING</h3>

<p>One result of my visit to Novgorod was that, on returning to
Moscow, I read a paper to an assembly of professors at the offices
of VOKS, the organization which corresponds in Russia to the
Society for Cultural Relations in London. My temerity in so doing
was only excused by the fact that in no other way could I meet
those of my audience, such as Professor Grabar, whom I particularly
wanted to meet. Each sentence of my paper had to be translated into
Russian by a lady interpreter with a headache, whose knowledge of
English was largely confined to engineering technicalities. When I
had finished, the chairman of the meeting expressed a polite
interest in all I had said, but regretted I had told the company
nothing of the social effects of El Greco's art. To this I replied,
with some asperity, that I was perfectly certain the company were
very glad, for once in their lives, to have had a respite from
social effects. The lady with the headache thought it inadvisable
to translate this remark. But those who understood English betrayed
a cynical pleasure in their laughter.</p>

<p>My paper dealt not only with El Greco but also with Russian art
as a parallel offshoot of the Byzantine tradition. The adverse
circumstances attending its delivery deprived my arguments of what
little force they might have had in English. But enough of their
meaning was apparent for several authorities on Russian art to
express their dissent during the discussion that followed. It is
therefore with some diffidence that I present the following remarks
on such examples of early Russian painting as time enabled me to
see, both in Novgorod and Moscow. In doing so, I may be forgiven
for two reasons; first, because a previous acquaintance with
contemporary styles in Greece revealed that the development of
those styles was paralleled in Russia with a closeness hitherto
unsuspected by historians of Russian art; and secondly, because the
whole subject of Russian painting has now been rendered so remote
by political barriers that any light on it, however myopic, must be
welcome to some people.</p>

<p>The difference between Byzantine and Russian painting is
noticeable enough from reproductions and from such icons as are or
have been available for study in Western Europe. I had always
imagined it to be a difference between a parent art of intellectual
and emotional significance and a bastard craft of shallow peasant
decoration. But the error of this view was soon apparent. And so
also were the causes that had given rise to it. For Russian art is
in truth less profound, and concerned with a less abstruse
intellectual goal, than that of Constantinople. Its compositions
therefore wear a shallow air in reproduction and in its lesser
paintings, which is not only foreign but inferior to the Greek
manner; they appear, under these circumstances, to be preoccupied
with mere patterns of colour or light and shade, patterns conceived
in two dimensions only, whose artistic meaning is scarcely deeper
than a patchwork quilt. To credit this second-hand effect is to
misjudge a great tradition. Early Russian painting is extrinsic in
character because its appeal is to the eye and fancy before the
mind. But the appeal is made by means whose independent virtues
deserve comparison on equal terms with those of the parent art.
These means are the infusion of Byzantine formalism with a native
poetry which is alien to the logical Mediterranean; a capacity for
placing exquisite and elaborate detail against positive, unfussed
backgrounds; superb courage in the use of brilliant colours, of
which a glowing white is not the least remarkable; unerring taste
in the juxtaposition of colours, whether in separate fields or
closely interwoven; and finally, an impalpable translucency, born
of snowscape and birch-tree and the broad sky of the plains. These
qualities are subtle and elusive, and are easily mistaken, in the
hands of second-rate masters or in photographs, for a folk-ridden
travesty of the original Greek models.</p>

<p>Russian art began with the formation of the city-states and the
adoption of Christianity by Vladimir, Prince of Kiev in 988. The
chief monument of this early period is the cycle of mosaics in the
cathedral at Kiev, which dates from the middle of the eleventh
century. This is purely Greek. But the mosaics in the monastery of
St Michael, also at Kiev, and dating from the twelfth century, are
thought to be the work of Russian artists. These are remarkable
mainly for their ineptitude, and beyond a white background display
no specifically Russian characteristics. The frescoes which adorn
the staircase of the cathedral at Kiev and date from the eleventh
century have been so restored that their interest is entirely
historical. Those which have survived in the church of St Cyril at
Kiev are scarcely more than line drawings in red and white, and
incompetent at that. In the Cathedral at Novgorod, decorated in the
eleventh century, only a single fragment depicting Constantine and
Helena has escaped restoration. This exhibits a crude incapacity
which repudiates any tradition whatsoever and lacks even the
primitive force of the untutored savage.</p>

<p>It is with the frescoes of Starya Ladoga and of St Demetrius at
Vladimir (<i>c.</i> 1200) that the study of Russian painting should
begin. These, unfortunately, I could not see. My survey must start
in the Novgorod district in 1198. In that year was initiated the
cycle of frescoes that still adorns the church of the
Transfiguration in the village of Nereditsa, near Novgorod.</p>

<p>Six years later Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade. But
the Latin Empire proved only an interlude, and the vitality of
Byzantine culture persisted, and even gained new strength, as the
Greek Empire shrank to its final end through the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. To this vitality the mosaics of the Kahrieh
and the frescoes of Mistra and Mount Athos are a sufficient
witness. From it sprang the prime inspiration of the Novgorod
artists in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The child had thus reached manhood ere the parent fell into
dotage, and from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries Russian and
Byzantine painting followed two separate roads of artistic
discovery, gradually diverging, yet subject to the same changes of
style, and permitting, therefore, classification into the same
schools. At length, about 1410, Russia produced a great individual
painter in the person of Roublev, who, though deriving immediately
from the contemporary Greek source, crystallized the hitherto fluid
idiosyncrasies peculiar to Russian painting into an authoritative
national school. The divergence from Constantinople was completed,
and by 1453, when that city was taken by the Turks, the tutelary
function of Greek art in Russia had become superfluous. The
full-fledged Cretan school, which followed, has no important
counterpart in the main stream of Russian art. It produced El
Greco. And he went West instead.</p>

<p>It was not until after the Iconoclast controversy of the ninth
century that Byzantine art developed its official character of
stereotyped iconography and gorgeous colour. The calculated
splendour thus produced was symbolic of the abundant wealth and
high civilization pertaining to a great capital. At the same time,
during the Macedonian and Comnenan dynasties, other influences were
at work in the provinces, which were destined to infuse the
impersonal magnificence of the official art with qualities more
human and sympathetic. These influences, particularly in Asia
Minor, found expression in a school of illustrators descended from
the Syrian miniaturists of pre-Iconoclastic times, whose chief
concern was a lively realism adapted to the instruction of the
illiterate through the medium of sacred pictures. Thus the figures
are short and stumpy, but active, the heads are large, the mouths
frown, and the faces in general retain that Hellenistic look of
perpetual surprise which results from the raised eyebrows, staring
pupils and white eyeballs of the Fayum portraits. The style
produced by this tradition in the tenth and eleventh centuries has
been called the Cappadocian, from the fact that its frescoes have
chiefly survived in rock-cut churches to the south-west of the
Euphrates.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century the influence of this style, while
unwelcome in Constantinople, spread to Italy; and it also spread to
Russia, as the frescoes of Nereditsa clearly show. Both in
iconography and in the vigorous action of the persons depicted,
these paintings closely resemble the mosaics in the monastery
church of St Luke of Stiris, near Delphi, which were done in the
eleventh and twelfth century and which in themselves betray a
marked affinity with the work of the popular illustrators. In some
scenes, particularly that of the Crucifixion, the Nereditsa
frescoes seem even more directly connected with those discovered by
P&egrave;re de Jerphanion in Cappadocia itself. Their colour is
sombre, emphatic, and opaque; there is no prophecy of the
luminosity to come. Cold blues, ochre, red, and pink are the
outstanding tints. The portrait of the founder, who holds the
church in his hand, shows a bearded countenance of scowling
melancholy in ochre and brown, surmounted by a fur-edged cap and
finished with a long red robe of Byzantine patterned silk, which
contrasts with a dark blue background. The general effect of the
whole decoration is one of gloomy tensity and earnestness belonging
to the North. Beyond this, there is little sign yet of native
invention. Nevertheless, the inscriptions, though mainly in Greek,
are interspersed with Slavonic letters, from which it is possible
to infer that the artist was a Russian.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the thirteenth century Russia was
overwhelmed by the Mongols; and it is not until the last half of
the fourteenth that further cycles of frescoes are available to
gauge the growth of a cultural tradition. In Greece, meanwhile, the
influence of the popular illustrators had invaded the capital and
had there joined forces with the wave of mysticism and insistence
on the beauty of suffering that submerged the thought of the Empire
in its last days and was the precursor, in Italy, of St Francis,
Giotto, and the Renascence. The result was not, as at St Luke's of
Stiris, the introduction of a crude dramatic convention; it now
took the form of refining, elaborating and humanizing the various
iconographic formulas in the light of new emotions. With emphasis
on pain came also a new joy: the details of nature were better
observed and utilized; colour grows brighter and more luminous. Two
schools developed. The earlier, known as the Macedonian, worked on
Mount Athos at the beginning of the fourteenth century, where its
cycles may still be seen, not seriously restored, in the monastery
of Vatopedi and the church of the Protaton at Caryes. The later and
more joyous, dating from the last half of the fourteenth century
and first decades of the fifteenth, flourished at Mistra in the
Peloponnese, where its works survive chiefly in the churches of the
Peribleptos and the Pantanassa.</p>

<p>The Macedonian school is represented in Russia by the paintings
in the church of the Dormition at Volotovo, near Novgorod, which
date from the year 1363. These paintings make it equally clear that
a native tradition of inquiring mind and free invention was by now
already established.</p>

<p>The most immediately noticeable resemblance between the Volotovo
cycle and those of the Macedonian school on Mount Athos lies in the
marked facial types which are common to both and which most
particularly distinguish the Macedonian school from those that came
after and before it. Prophets and Patriarchs, such as the David and
Job at Volotovo, have tight woolly curls and beards, both white;
they frown furiously; their heads project beyond their bodies,
while their foreheads overhang and their jaws are tightly
compressed, so that the lower part of the face is small in
comparison with the upper. Christ too remains unaltered: in the
<i>Double Communion</i> at Volotovo, his equally frowning face,
fringed by a longer but still compact black beard, is almost
identical with that of his appearances in the Protaton at Caryes
(<i>c.</i> 1310). The beardless faces are also similar,
particularly those of the women, with their well-rounded, highly
modelled chins and air of melancholy resignation&mdash;features
which indicate, in the Byzantine sphere, a reversion to the forms
of Antiquity. These faces are boldly constructed with broad
impressionistic sweeps. But in the Russian church, impressionism
has extended its field; even the faces of the hieratic Early
Fathers such as St Clement, though singularly reminiscent of their
fellows in the Protaton, have exchanged the ancient convention for
one less rigid and angular. In general, however, the sympathy these
frescoes exhale is due to Greek inspiration and grows most
poignant, as at Vatopedi on Mount Athos, in the <i>Crucifixion,</i>
a scene of vivid humanity and sorrow. The choice of scenes and
their arrangement also tallies with those of contemporary Greece.
If the actual method of coloration is Russian, in its broad zones,
light touch, and lack of all save essential interruptions, the
colours themselves are seen to be mainly Greek. From the Macedonian
school have come the prevailing flat mauve, dirty russet pink, and
cold blue. Yet here and there are signs of a new spring, as in the
beryl-green draperies of the women in the <i>Raising of
Lazarus.</i> This derives, not from native sources, but from
Mistra.</p>

<p>The native genius has none the less found its own means of
expression. Though the scheme of the whole Volotovo cycle is
traditional, the iconography of many individual scenes shows a new
departure and a first realization, in art, of Russian poetry and
fancy. The figures are ethereal and elongated beyond even the
Athonite canon. In movement, an airy grace has succeeded to
hieratic pose and crude gesture. Indeed, something of the ballet
has come to reawaken these ancient, sacred persons. In the scene of
the <i>Annunciation,</i> a bending willowy angel, whose voluminous
drapery and still poised wings bespeak the imminence of flight,
beckons with tiny hand to a Virgin who shrinks within herself as a
Danilova before the advances of a Lifar. The Virgin, moreover, has
been recostumed; her mantle forms a kind of shepherd's hat with
corners on each temple. In the theme of the <i>Maries of the
Tomb,</i> the iconography has been radically altered; for though
the usual angel is seated on the open lid, Christ is seen escaping,
and the Maries, instead of standing upright, are prostrated before
him, while agitated soldiers appear in the background. The
<i>Ascension,</i> to a Byzantinist of conservative taste, is
frankly extraordinary. There is no attempt at symmetry. Apostles
and Virgin dart hither and thither in choreographic riot, while
tongues of lightning escape from whirling clouds in a corner of the
sky.</p>

<p>In addition to the subjects prescribed by Orthodox usage, the
church at Volotovo contains four sketches of partly historical and
partly artistic, but intrinsically Russian, interest. The first
depicts the church itself, in process of dedication, and shows that
from the time it was built until now not a stone of it has changed.
The second portrays a banquet offered to a company of fantastically
dressed notables in a contemporary monastery, one of whose
white-robed monks serves the dishes from a side-table. The other
two are portraits of Moses and Alexis, archbishops of Novgorod in
the fourteenth century. These are rendered almost wholly in line
and bear no relation to existing formulas, Greek or otherwise.
Moses, it appears, died in 1359. But Alexis was archbishop when the
church was built. His portrait is freer than the other; we see a
true Slav face with sparse beard, high cheek-bones, and the contour
of a peasant doll. This is an example of genuine characterization,
evidently done from life with the purpose of creating a likeness
rather than the symbol of a likeness. It is the first example of
its kind in Russian art, and one which Greek painting, even in its
post-Conquest phase, never attained to.</p>

<p>In 1910 and 1912 two events of great archaeological importance
occurred in Novgorod. Frescoes were found under whitewash, first in
the church of St Theodore Stratilates, then in that of the
Transfiguration. The former were wholly uncovered. Of the latter,
only the paintings in the cupola are as yet visible. But it is
hoped that eventually the whole series will be revealed intact.</p>

<p>The significance of these discoveries lies in the recorded fact
that the frescoes in the church of the Transfiguration were painted
in 1379 by a Greek name Theophanes, who is known in Russia as 'the
Greek', just as Domenicos Theotocopoulos is known in Spain. The
lives of these two artists, Greeks in exile both, offer curious
parallels. Both were known as philosophers. Both enjoyed the fame
which attaches to persons of strong character and artistic
audacity. Theophanes, it is recorded, disdained the hieratic
manuals and their iconographic formulas. He painted from personal
inspiration or from nature, and did a view of Moscow on a wall just
as Theotocopoulos did views of Toledo. One of the chronicles of the
time preserves a miniature of him at work, surrounded by a gaping
crowd. In 1405 he left Novgorod for Moscow, where he decorated
various churches. Among these was that of the Annunciation in the
Kremlin. He worked here in conjunction with Roublev, who must thus,
at an early stage of his career, have come under the direct
personal influence of a Byzantine master.</p>

<p>The little of Theophanes' work yet visible I was unable to see,
owing to the fury of the maenad in charge of the church which
contained it. But Professor Anisimov, before he suffered the fate
reserved for more rebellious intellectuals under the Tsar's rule
and was despatched to an unknown destination in Siberia, delivered
his opinion that the frescoes in the church of St Theodore
Stratilates, which date from about 1370, may also be regarded with
reasonable probability as the work of this Russian Greco. This
supposition is reinforced by the fact that the inscriptions are all
in Greek, while those at Nereditsa and Volotovo are interspersed
with Cyrillic characters. It can only be finally confirmed,
however, when the restoration of the church of the Transfiguration
has been completed.</p>

<p>Directly I entered the church of St Theodore Stratilates, I
exclaimed to myself, without being aware of the above facts, 'Here
is Byzantium'; and certainly these paintings, with their
accomplished technique and genuine air of the Greek Renascence, may
rank with those of Mistra itself. Yet despite the immanence of
Byzantine inspiration, the Russian genius of the dance is present
in them also. Here, in fact, for the first and last time before the
final divergence, the fusion of this genius with the Mediterranean
capacity for intellectual, three-dimensional design has been fully
achieved.</p>

<p>The colours, which are impregnated with that impalpable
suggestion of interior light proper to the Byzantine masterpiece,
derive from the same palette as those in the Peribleptos at Mistra
(late fourteenth century). Their range is the spectrum of a
pearl&mdash;pink, bistre, wine-red, love-in-the-mist blue, a bright
grey, and white. The last two, in conjunction, foreshadow the
development of the later Cretan school and its ultimate flower, El
Greco. The finest composition of the cycle is the <i>Descent into
Hell,</i> in the western apse. Here the mobile Christ, with hands
outstretched in expansive gesture, is framed, but for one retarded
foot, in a circular aura of two greys enclosing a white
ground&mdash;the triple aura of Hezychast speculation. On either
side of him those of the Old Dispensation rise from their tombs in
supplication; while above the aura clustered angels uplift the
cross. If such a scheme lacks precedent in purely Greek
iconography, the interwoven symmetry and rhythms of the design are
nevertheless products of a Greek mind. The delicate heightening of
flesh-contours with imperceptible touches of white is also very
Greek, particularly when applied to the bulges of the foreheads,
down the noses, and beneath the eyes, in the manner of the
mosaicist. This prevails throughout the church. In the upper zone
of the cupola, the orb-holding angels, clad in royal vestments and
alternating with six-winged cherubims, recall the art of the Greek
court in the golden age. At the same time, the free and graceful
movements of the white-robed soldiers on the <i>Road to
Calvary,</i> combined with an architectural background in Western
perspective, indicate the growth of a new humanism, coincident with
that of Italy, which reached its climax in the Pantanassa at Mistra
in 1428. The frescoes of St Theodore Stratilates, in fact,
represent an interlude between the Peribleptos and the Pantanassa,
and in some respects between the Mistra and Cretan schools, an
interlude whose monuments, in Greece itself, are lacking.
Meanwhile, the development of the Russian tradition continues. The
compositions are freer, the figures less static, than those of
Greece; and in the colours there lurks, beside their intrinsic
light, a hint of that opalescent shimmer whose full glory was
reserved for Roublev in four decades' time.</p>

<p>In addition to the frescoes described above, historical evidence
suggests a possibility that the scene of the <i>Dormition</i>
painted on the back of the Donskaya Virgin may also be the work of
Theophanes Greco. This icon is now in the Tretyakov Gallery in
Moscow. Having examined the back of it at some length, I found it
difficult to convert the possibility into probability. But there
exist also two other and larger icons, about five feet square as
far as I remember, which the most recent Russian authorities are
disposed to ascribe to Theophanes. One, representing the
<i>Crucifixion</i>, is in the museum at Novgorod. Unfortunately it
was late in the afternoon when I got there, and there was little
time for detailed attention; I noticed only a chocolate robe whose
folds were illumined with high-lights of pale azure. The other,
representing the <i>Transfiguration,</i> is now in the Tretyakov
Gallery in Moscow, whose curator, Professor Nikrasiev, expressed a
strong belief in its ascription to the Greek. Its colours exhibited
those shattering, angular contrasts and fierce lightning effects
which are usually associated, in Greece, with the Cretan
school&mdash;the same azure lights applied to robes of rusty red
and honey yellow; red lights to olive-green; slate to wine-pink;
while the Christ himself, etched in gold, is framed by an aura of
light grey-blue, gold, and white. Professor Nikrasiev, before
giving his opinion, asked mine; I dated the icon from the fifteenth
or early sixteenth centuries. But now it is evident, after seeing
the paintings of St Theodore Stratilates, that the Cretan style,
which reached its height at the beginning of the sixteenth century,
had already begun to develop at the end of the fourteenth. The icon
of the <i>Transfiguration</i> may therefore be the work of
Theophanes, and the colours common to both it and the paintings of
Novgorod may have been subjected, on a panel designed for close
inspection, to purposeful exaggeration. For the colours used, apart
from their method of application, are essentially the same in both.
It was these colours which Roublev undoubtedly inherited, through
his Greek master, from the short-lived spring of the Byzantine
Renascence, and which he now, in the first decade of the fifteenth
century, put to a further use.</p>

<p>Andrew Roublev was a monk in the Andronievsky monastery in
Moscow. The first mention of him is in connection with Theophanes
and the decoration of the church of the Annunciation. In 1408 he
was at work in the church of the Assumption at Vladimir. About
1410, it is thought, he painted the great icon of the
<i>Trinity</i> for the monastery of that name at Sergievo, where it
remained, until after the Revolution, in the iconostasis of the
monastery cathedral. Little more is known of the life of Roublev,
and nothing more of his work. Yet his influence changed the whole
character of Russian painting, and he attained a prodigious, almost
legendary, fame in his own country. In 1551 a church council,
condemning innovations in icon-painting, proclaimed the style of
Roublev as the true standard of artistic Orthodoxy, to be followed
in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Until 1920, justification of Roublev's fame in terms of
aesthetic talent was somewhat lacking, even to the eyes of
Russians. Kondakov, for example, in his book on the Russian icon
published by the Oxford University Press, doubts whether the panel
of the <i>Trinity</i> was from Roublev's own hand, and has no
inkling of its real artistic value. For Kondakov had left Russia
before the icon had been cleared of its nineteenth-century
overcoating. Even now, the numerous foreign visitors to Russia
seldom see it. Until 1929 it was at Sergievo. Then it was removed
to the Tretyakov Gallery, where the central heating immediately
wrought more damage than five centuries of cold and damp. The
pieces of the panel warped and the paint cracked down the middle.
When I saw it, it lay on the restorer's table, so that I was
obliged to stand on a chair and look down on it from above. The
view was a revelation. Before me was the greatest masterpiece ever
produced by a Slav painter, a work of unprecedented invention, to
which nothing in art that I could think of offered any sort of
parallel. It was not that I saw a greater painting than any I had
seen before; but simply that here was one which differed, in its
greatness, more than I had thought possible from the accepted
canons of greatness.</p>

<p>The panel is roughly four and a half feet square. It depicts the
Trinity in the form of three angels seated at a table&mdash;a theme
often found in Orthodox iconography and based on Abraham's
entertainment of strange guests. The background is light in tone
and was probably once white, but has now an indeterminate texture
of dirty cream. On one side rises a tower, on the other a hill,
both light in tone and distant; while in the middle, though to the
right of the central angel's head, stands a nearer tree, green,
flat, and formal. The central angel is visible to the knees only;
the others have their legs in front of the table. All three of them
present a scheme of colour whose simplicity of equilibrium seems
paradoxical beside the rare and lyrical splendour of the resulting
whole.</p>

<p>The central angel and that on the beholder's right wear
full-sleeved robes, round which cloaks are draped to cover one arm
and shoulder. On the central angel, these garments are respectively
of rich flat chocolate, tinged with red, and of a brilliant
lapidary blue, a colour so emphatic, yet so reserved, that in all
nature I can think of no analogy for it. The angel on the right
wears a robe whose tint is of this same blue, but whose intensity
is less. Across this is draped a cloak of dry sapless green, colour
of leaves at the end of summer, whose high-lights are rendered in
light grey-green shading off into pure white. The angel on the left
wears a robe of reddish mauve lit with pale translucent slate
colour, over a white vest. All the faces and hands are nut-brown,
modelled only by variations in tone of the same colour, and
outlined in black. The outspread wings, whose feathers are denoted
by thin gold lines, are a flatter and paler brown, something
between tea and toffee, which strikes a mean plane between the
figures and the tree. Each head is encircled by a plain white halo
which was formerly, though not perhaps originally, encased in
metal.</p>

<p>The first simplicity of this scheme resolves eventually into
something not so simple. The composition has an inner construction
which is welded from the contrast not between colour-fields alone,
but between tones and textures. While the middle angel asserts its
focal claim with such positive affirmatory force that the eye
almost recoils, it is precisely because the side angels are able to
absorb this force and dispute it that the eye, instead of
recoiling, is entranced by a vivid interaction. This process
results, chiefly, from the cloaks of the side angels. The colours
of these garments have been described in general terms. But in
reality there is no describing them; one might try, with equal
success, to analyse the palette of Rembrandt's flesh. The reddish
mauve and the pale slate, the leaf-green lit by grey-green and
white, are seen to comprise on examination of the miracle, not
merely these, but all the colours of the pearl spectrum. They
shimmer, like hills over a desert in the evening. Such ethereal
transparency, enclosed by broad, flat colour-fields, has its own
mobility and force, which curb the affirmation of the central
figure and balance the design equally.</p>

<p>Long and close as I looked, I could not be certain how Roublev
achieved this effect. I could only suppose it was by use of small
brushes and many pigments. But I was certain enough that the
method, whatever it was, has produced a painting which has no like
in European art. Even in the faces the touch of genius is apparent.
He has followed the formula, has eschewed the use of colour on
flesh to a point even in excess of it. Yet the faces live and their
earnest, downward glances bespeak a vital, if supernatural,
intelligence on the part of the strange neuter creatures that bear
them. Though Roublev was master of all he inherited from the
Greeks, of formulas and colour alike, his real inspiration was
Russian. The poetry of the country lives in his paint, the strength
of it in his design. Yet in his monkish gravity lurks something
greater than melody and dance, something extra-national, which
belongs to the world. Until Roublev, Greek art can claim the
authority of a parent over Russian&mdash;the latter produced
nothing that approaches the mosaics of the Kahrieh. But in Roublev
the slowly matured independence of the child was finally
proclaimed. This proclamation was final in another sense also. For
it was not until the literature of the nineteenth century that the
Slav genius again scaled the heights discovered by an obscure monk,
whose one memorial is a panel of three angels.</p>

<p>Roublev left a school, whose icons betray his aims, but not his
genius; almost at once, imitation of the master degenerates into
formula. Of his ultimate effect 'on wall-painting, the frescoes of
the monastery of Theraponte, done between 1500 and 1502 by the
master Dionysios, must be the criterion. Photographs of these
paintings reveal an art of sweeping design and grand invention. But
photographs are not enough, and the monastery lies so encompassed
by marshes in one of the northern provinces that no one I asked in
Moscow could even tell me the name of Kirillov, its nearest
station. The best I could manage, in quest of Roublev's successors,
was a visit to Yaroslavl, whose churches were decorated in the
middle of the seventeenth century. The churches themselves have
many beauties, as I shall tell. But their frescoes speak death to
the Byzantine Orthodox tradition. Here are all the faults of
Russian art redeemed by none of its virtues. Formalism unchallenged
and uncomprehended has become the ally of insane elaboration and
peasant garishness. It remained for the eighteenth century to
create a secular tradition of painting, and for the nineteenth to
produce such accomplished, if synthetic, realists as a Verestchagin
and a Repin, together with that last nauseating throwback, whose
very name is an impiety, the neo-Byzantinist Vroubel.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>It is possible to object that the above survey, in omitting all
reference to the icon schools, takes a very limited view of Russian
painting. The objection is just; for icons comprise the great bulk
of Russian painting before the sixteenth century, while frescoes
are comparatively rare. But the two arts are essentially different.
Many of the fresco-painters, it is true, achieved nothing but a
moribund formality; many of the icon-painters, on the other hand,
created works of the greatest beauty and feeling. But the fresco
belongs to the grand tradition of art, while the very nature of the
icon condemns it to perpetual approximation with the crafts. The
fresco-painter, unless he is out to produce a mere wallpaper, as at
Yaroslavl, must necessarily exercise some talent for spacing and
movement and balance, some attempt at three-dimensional composition
over an area and plane which vary with each individual church;
however ungifted, he must invent, to achieve his object at all. The
icon-painter, however gifted, need never invent; if the impulse to
do so is in him, he is restricted as a rule to the refinement of
detail within a narrow convention. Such refinement, especially in
the Novgorod school of icons, has often amounted to genius. But
that genius has inevitably been limited by, or at least adapted to,
the lesser medium in which it worked. Roublev, who was also a
fresco-painter, refused to be thus hampered, though his panel of
the <i>Trinity</i> is technically an icon. He was born of the grand
tradition and continued it.</p>

<p>During my stay in Russia, with so much to see of politics and
people, I dared not adventure into the labyrinth of the icon
schools, for fear that, while my visa lasted, I might never emerge
from it. I did see, notwithstanding, some noted individual icons,
whose present state and whereabouts deserve a cursory mention.</p>

<p>The paintings in the museum at Novgorod have been selected and
arranged with as much discrimination and taste as a private
collection. The better known and much reproduced examples of the
Novgorod school are elsewhere; many of those now in the museum were
undiscovered before the Revolution and have only been gathered in
from the surrounding churches during the last ten years. That this
should have been possible is a testimony of at least one service
rendered by the Revolution to art. I had not time for detailed
study. I can only say that the chief impression made by the
collection was one of uniform <i>quality</i> which in colour and
emotion surpassed even the finest icons of Athens and Mount Athos.
The most famous icon in the collection is the fourteenth-century
painting of St Theodore Stratilates in white top-boots. One early
panel stood out from the rest on account of its unique secular
theme&mdash;that of the Novgorodians sallying out to fight their
enemies the Suzdalians before the walls of the town, with the
course of the battle depicted in three zones and the skies filled
with flying arrows. Every icon seemed to have been picked for its
perfect condition, and indeed the majority of them have been
conserved rather than injured by the layers of grease and smoke
that had accumulated on them. I visited the restoration room near
by. A large panel of St Nicolas Lipna, dated 1294, lay on the table
under the care of a single man. Its restoration was nearly finished
and would have taken, when complete, a year and a half of this
man's life. I met no man in the Soviet Union more content with his
lot.</p>

<p>In the museum of the Pechersky Lavra in Kiev, towards the end of
my journey in Russia, I saw the oldest icons in the world. These
were brought from Mount Sinai in the eighteenth century by the
Russian Metropolitan Porphyry. They date from the sixth, and are
executed on small panels in the wax painting that obtained at that
period. One represents SS. Sergius and Bacchus, between whose two
heads is that of Christ in a medallion; another, St John the
Baptist; and a third, the Virgin and Child. All three bear a close
relation to the Fayum and Coptic tradition of portraiture. The
brushwork is bold and impressionistic, greens and pinks being used
on the flesh; the eyebrows are raised and the eyes themselves stare
unnaturally. An explanatory notice informs the visitor that in the
year 392 the Emperor Theodosius forbade the placing of portraits on
mummies. Consequently, icons of sacred personages were done in the
same style and used instead.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution, the most famous of all holy pictures in
Russia&mdash;and the most efficacious in its transmission of human
prayers to the authority competent to grant them&mdash;was the
Iberian Virgin of Moscow. This stood in the Iberian Gateway, a
double, twin-spired arch that adjoined the Historical Museum and
gave access to the Red Square. Owing to the increase of motor
traffic, this ancient structure had lately been pulled down and an
inscription erected, above the site of the Virgin, which reminds
the passer-by of Lenin's familiar tag: RELIGION IS THE OPIUM OF THE
PEOPLE. When I was in Moscow, the icon was still preserved in an
obscure chapel. Thither one evening I was conducted. A service was
in progress beneath the low barrel-vault, attended by some fifteen
people. The Iberian Virgin hung on the wall at the farther end, and
I was eventually able to creep up and examine it with the aid of a
taper. Artistically it proved disappointingly wooden and seemed to
date from the sixteenth century. But I was pleased to have seen so
remarkable and revered a relic of old Russia.</p>

<p>Not long after my return to England, I received a letter from
Moscow to say that the Iberian Virgin had suddenly disappeared.
Rumour insists that it has been sold to Greece. I have written to
Athens inquiring, but can get no confirmation of any such
transaction.</p>

<p>The chief collection of icons in Moscow is in the Tretyakov
Gallery. During my visit this was in process of rearrangement, but
Professor Nikrasiev kindly allowed me access to it, and I wandered
about a small room turning over the heavy panels like the pages of
some gigantic wooden book. Two formalized Virgins attracted my
attention. The first was the Donskaya, dating from the fourteenth
century. Virgin and Child incline towards each other with
expressions of love and sympathy. But the expressions are fixed and
the faces too rounded, like an apple in an advertisement. This is
no likeness of a woman, but a likeness of a likeness. Over the head
is draped a mantle of deep chocolate, beneath which, framing cheeks
and neck, bursts forth a veil of ultramarine so bright that the
eye, in this case, does recoil. This blue is richer and more
allusive than that employed by Roublev on his middle angel. The
second Virgin, known as the Smolenskaya, is a huge, extra-life-size
composition, terrifying in its crude, rigid majesty, like the
carving on a Red Indian totem-pole. Again the Virgin wears a
chocolate mantle, beneath which hangs a slate under-veil lined with
vermilion. The face is apple-red and brown; the nose resembles a
large church key and the eyes are like black peas. This icon is
primitive in the true sense of the word, and seemed to show what
Russian art might always have been had the tradition of
Constantinople never come to it.</p>

<p>For the tradition of Constantinople, as I looked about, stood
incarnate on an easel before my eyes. Another panel of the Virgin I
saw, which is believed to have been sent from Constantinople by the
Emperor Constantine Monomach in the middle of the eleventh century,
which was certainly in existence by the middle of the twelfth, and
which is undoubtedly the work of a Greek painter emanating from the
sphere of the capital during the golden age of Byzantine art.
During its first two centuries in Russia this icon remained in the
cathedral of Vladimir and is known as the Vladimirskaya or, in
Western parlance, as Our Lady of Vladimir, under which title a
monograph on it by Professor Anisimov was published by the
Seminarium Kondakovianum of Prague in 1928. Eventually it became
the Palladium of the Russian state and monarchy, and in 1395 was
transferred to the Kremlin, where the two sheaths of gold that used
to encase it are now among the state treasure. After the Revolution
it was disencumbered of these ornaments and subjected to expert
restoration. This discovered that the original paint had survived
only on those parts which had been always exposed, namely, the two
faces.</p>

<p>Already, from Professor Anisimov's colour reproduction, I had
gained some idea of the beauty of these faces; but the reality, the
sudden view of the picture on the easel, opened a new experience in
art, just as Roublev's <i>Trinity</i> had done. To describe the
colours that make the Virgin's face, the apple-red and translucent
sepia-green of cheeks and neck, the touch of pure cold white on the
nose, the glowing vermilion of the lips and the corners of the
eyes, the unfathomable purplish darkness of the pupils and of the
compact lines that mark the upper eye-lashes&mdash;to write these
details is merely to transcribe the score of an unheard symphony.
Even technically, there is no other picture like it, for it is the
only painting of the high imperial art of Constantinople which has
survived. Furthermore, and apart from academic considerations, it
is one of the very few paintings in which an ecclesiastical formula
has ever been made the vehicle, without modification or extension,
of as profound and touching a humanity as art has ever been able to
express. This humanity exists not within the limits of the
convention, or in spite of it, but through it, in the language of
it. In one sense, then, it is no longer a convention. Yet it is the
fact of the convention which augments, by its impregnable reserve,
the vitality of the emotion beneath it. The emotion is simple
enough: a mother caresses the child whose cheek is pressed to hers
and whose pale gentle fingers fondle her neck. But simple emotions
endure through the ages. In those grave, whiteless eyes and sad
small mouth live the eternal sorrows and joys and the whole destiny
of man. Such a picture can bring tears to the eye and peace to the
soul. I have known no other picture so able. When I took leave of
Our Lady of Vladimir, I gave her my constant devotion. For me, she
has set a new standard to the old religious painters, and how vivid
this remains I know by the fact that certain pictures I used to
hate have now, in my mind, forfeited even the dignity of a separate
existence.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-8"></a>VIII. YAROSLAVL AND SERGIEVO</h3>

<p>While Veliki Novgorod retains something of the character of
early Russia before the Tartar invasion, the monuments of Yaroslavl
commemorate the expansion of commerce that marked the seventeenth
century. The town had been altogether ruined by the Tartars in
1237, but was colonized anew by Ivan the Terrible with merchants
imported from Novgorod. It lies on the Volga, 150 miles north-east
of Moscow. With Europe by Archangel, and with Persia by the
Caspian, these merchants traded. The English built a naval shipyard
there; Dutch, Germans, French, and Spaniards followed them. Great
prosperity came to the town, and found expression in a series of
churches whose spacious proportions and richness of architectural
decoration had no rival in the Russia of their time. Unlike those
of fifteenth-century Moscow, these exhibit little foreign
influence. The native aesthetic, so long nourished by the Italians,
was now putting forth its own flowers, before the Italians should
arrive again with the canons of later classicism.</p>

<p>Since the inception of the Five-Year Plan Yaroslavl has again
come to the fore, thanks to its position on the Volga and on the
main lines from Moscow to Vladivostok and Archangel. The ASEA, a
Swedish engineering company, had until 1932 a factory there for the
manufacture of electrical machinery&mdash;the only foreign
concession left in Russia at the time. My guide and I had made no
preparations for our visit beyond deciding which train we should
catch. This took us to Spolye, where, at six in the morning, we
were met by a Swedish engineer. He drove us to Yaroslavl in his car
and installed us in the flat of his manager, who happened to be ill
in Moscow. My gratitude for this kindness was increased when my
guide discovered that the local hotels were not only uncomfortable
to a degree that alarmed even him, but were absolutely full.</p>

<p>After breakfast, we took a tram to the middle of the town, and
asked our way to the once famous churches. Even the aged, to whom
our inquiries were chiefly directed, appeared to have forgotten
their Maker, and gaped unhelpfully as I mouthed the names of Ivan
Predetchi and Ivan Zlatoousta&mdash;Johns the Baptist and
Chrysostom; for my guide was such a militant atheist that these
superstitious sounds were beyond him. In despair, we mounted a
sledge, whose giant driver, wearing a full-skirted black coat tied
with a red sash and trimmed with white astrakhan, drove us to a
ruined church which he said was the cathedral of the Prophet Elias.
So it might have remained, in my imagination, had not two officials
also driven up at that very moment, who informed us that it was
not. We must go, they said, to the Museum Chancellery in the
Spassky monastery, where they would give us all information. To the
Spassky monastery we went, a white-walled enclosure guarded by
massive square towers with wooden conical roofs. The courtyard was
also in ruins; for there was a lot of fighting at Yaroslavl in the
Civil War. Its single inhabitant asserted with glee that the Museum
Chancellery was elsewhere. At the same time a sentry tried to
confiscate my camera. So I gave the driver a prod and we drove off
at a gallop. Suddenly I recognized the real cathedral of St Elias,
having already seen a photograph of it. The Museum Chancellery was
opposite. On entering, we were told that a committee meeting was in
progress and could not be disturbed. I ventured to suggest that it
could be disturbed, and, dragging my guide with me, burst into its
room, followed by a protesting janitor. Thereupon the necessary
officials placed themselves at my disposal, showed me a number of
Slavonic manuscripts and told me how to reach the monuments I was
in search of.</p>

<p>The nearest was the cathedral of St Elias, whose five domes,
outer galleries and detached bell-tower with conical roof exhibit
the chief characteristics of the Yaroslavl style. This was built in
1647; the domes are green; the outside is covered with plain
whitewash. But within, the frescoed walls reveal a jungle of sacred
themes in the brightest colours, which are still enclosed in the
schematic compartments ordained by the Byzantine Church, and thus
represent the last and most fantastic offspring of the Orthodox
tradition of Christian art. This was the only interior we had
access to. I was glad to have seen it, but had no desire for more,
since the interest of the paintings was hagiographical rather than
artistic.</p>

<p>Our next objective was the church of St John Chrysostom in the
suburb of Korovniki. This place is separated from the town by a
tributary of the Volga, across which a herring-gutted iron bridge,
known as the 'Amerikansky Most', carries the trams, while sledges
take a short cut over the ice. The churches of Korovniki&mdash;for
there are two&mdash;are overtopped by a huge leaning bell-tower,
octagonal in shape and topped by a dormered cone. That of St John
Chrysostom, which was founded in 1649 at the expense of two
merchant brothers called Nejdanovsky, is decorated with brick
patterns which take the form, on the base, of a blind arcade
conceived in that squat, bulbous manner associated in England with
Tudor bedsteads. Mingled with these patterns are panels of the
local faience, and at the east end the three windows are surrounded
by wide curving frames of the same material. As an architectural
medium this faience can only be compared with the Mexican
<i>azulejos.</i> Later in the day we found an even more lavish
example of its use, on the church of St Nicolas Mokri (1672), where
the smaller onion-shaped cupolas are entirely formed of
chevron-like tiles in peacock blue and green varied with a deep
wine-red. Here the same window frames again appeared. Both these
and the panels, and occasionally even the cornice of a porch, are
done in high relief, to the extent of two inches. The colours,
which are very pure, are for the most part blue, green, and yellow,
on a white ground.</p>

<p>Thence we drove to Toltchkovo, another suburb, where we caught
sight of another campanile, still more oblique, and rising in
octagonal tiers like a chocolate wedding-cake. From each tier
glittered a row of gilt balls, upheld by a series of pinnacles.
This, we knew, must be the church of St John the Baptist (1671).
But how to reach it no one could tell us. At length we stopped at
the lodge of a paint factory, where two sentries and a posse of
comrades disputed our passage, convinced apparently that I was a
professional <i>saboteur</i> sent by the British Government to
upset the paint-front for 1932. My guide, by this time, was
convinced of my disinterestedness&mdash;having seen me literally
reduced to tears by the cold in my fingers while photographing on
my belly in the snow at Korovniki&mdash;and calmed their fears by
telling them, with a pitying glance in my direction, that he had
been unable to drag me to a single factory and that all I cared
about in this world was churches, churches, churches. Finally I
offered them each a Gold Flake, and entrance was granted. I also
lit one myself, and in five minutes might have been seen, after all
these precautions, perched on a large tank of inflammable oil and
smoking hard, while I adjusted my camera. This questionable
behaviour, let me say at once, was due to absent-mindedness rather
than a desire to give my life for the destruction of the Five-Year
Plan. The church itself proved worth the effort. Above a structure
of rich chocolate-coloured brick decorated with ribs and roundels
of cold green faience, the five scaly onion-domes on their tall
stalks shone out over the snowy landscape in a sudden ray of sun,
as though the melted gold, deep and vivid as the middle of a
buttercup, were actually running down them.</p>

<p>Owing to the shortness of the winter day, combined with the
reluctance of the inhabitants to leave their beds, there is only
time in Russia for one meal in every twenty-four hours. This takes
place when we have tea. That evening I was to dine with the Swedish
engineer who had met me at the station. At half-past four he
fetched me from the manager's flat and we walked about a mile to
his house. Here four other Swedes, also tenants, awaited us. Each
had his own room, frescoed&mdash;in the style of the
<i>Bystander</i>&mdash;by his own hand. 'Mr Byron,' said the
engineer in an earnest, indeed apprehensive, tone, 'we hope you are
not a teetotaller.'</p>

<p>After a tiring day out of doors in extreme cold, when the face
has flushed and the body suddenly relaxed in the warmth of a
comfortable room, life can offer no more supreme content than the
first sip of some God-given stimulant. The divine beverage on this
occasion consisted of port, brandy, and vodka mixed. There followed
<i>zakouska,</i> eaten with vodka alone. With the vodka came beer,
and with the beer the meal itself and port. This was the dinner.
After an interval, those invited in afterwards began to arrive.
They were all Russians and the only ones I ever met under normal
conditions. First came a lady and gentleman, the former of refined
aspect and restrained dress, whose uncle had formerly owned the
house in which we sat. For them green chartreuse was brought out.
Then followed a youthful doctor with a twinkling eye, accompanied
by two ladies of a different type. One of them was his wife; 'but',
I was told, 'it makes no difference'. The doctor played the piano.
The ladies and gentlemen took the floor. The piano was succeeded by
the gramophone; the drinks succeeded one another. The doctor gave
us a dance, squatting on his haunches and kicking his legs in front
of him. The furniture began to disintegrate under the berserk
assaults of its owners. The doctor and I, though lacking a common
tongue, engaged in earnest conversation: he pointed to his wife and
pointed to the stairs. The refined lady and gentleman went home. At
half-past two, when the party had lasted ten hours, I did likewise,
guided through a mile of suburbs by one of my hosts, whose mirth,
despite the uncertainty of our progress over the frozen hummocks,
had suddenly evaporated into a tearful melancholy.</p>

<p>The next morning I had an appointment to see over the ASEA
factory at a quarter to ten. I arrived on time and so did my friend
the engineer. The others were still in bed, and their various
chiefs were wondering if an epidemic had struck the house. This
foreign factory, I say with pride, was the only factory in Russia
that I visited. The afternoon I spent by the shores of the Volga.
That night I left for Sergievo, bearing a feeling of eternal
gratitude towards this oasis of merriment in the desert of grim
purposes.</p>

<p>We were due to arrive at seven o'clock. I awoke at eight,
somewhat alarmed lest we had passed our destination, only to learn
that we still had ninety kilometres to go. Soon after, the delay
was explained by an overturned goods train whose engine lay on its
side, faintly breathing, like an expiring elephant. This was very
convenient, since it had begun to snow, and the warmth of my
flea-bag was preferable to a long wait in a wayside station. We
reached Sergievo&mdash;now called Zagorsk&mdash;at ten o'clock, and
walked straight to the monastery. Seen across the valley, behind a
curtain of gently falling snowflakes, the clusters of domes,
encircled by a white wall with fat red-washed angle-towers and
overtopped by Rastrelli's belfry, 320 ft of pink-and-white baroque
arches, seemed more like a painted back-cloth than a thing of three
dimensions, substantial and inhabited.</p>

<p>Nor was this illusion altogether unjust. These monasteries and
Kremlins that flash their colours over the gloomy landscape are, in
truth, a back-cloth to the modern stage, and redeem the play, if
the audience be a foreign traveller, from the monotony of a
fore-doomed industrialization. The Troitskaya Lavra at Sergievo is
one of the most famous of them. Founded in 1340, and always the
object of imperial favour, its corporation of 100 monks became the
owners of half a million serfs, so said the lady who showed us
round between pants of indignation. After the Revolution the
monastery became a museum and a haven for savants, but was now
deserted. The savants had been accused of a plot and were
dispersed, some to 'manure Socialist fields', others to populate
the Ural towns and the lumber-camps.</p>

<p>The peace of the snow-covered courtyard, large and irregular as
two Oxford colleges, with its churches, refectory, and lines of
cells, was broken only by the cawing of crows in the bare trees.
Beside the entrance to the blue-domed cathedral, a squat tomb, half
hidden by the trunks of a small coppice, still shelters the remains
of the Tsar Boris Godunov. We were shown the Metropolitan's
apartments, where the furniture used by Peter the Great remains
untouched. And then I asked to see what was formerly the greatest
treasure of the monastery, the embroidered sheet or banner
presented to it in 1499 by Sophia, wife of Ivan III, Princess of
Constantinople&mdash;so the broidered inscription calls
her&mdash;and last historic figure of the dethroned family of
Palaeologus. My request evoked first pretended ignorance of any
such object, then petulant annoyance, and finally acquiescence, on
condition that I made no attempt to accompany the curator to the
store-room where the sheet was now hidden, as it was in such a
muddle!</p>

<p>After a wait of two hours, I was able to examine the precious
relic, a large panel of faded silk embroidery in which patches of a
deep rose-crimson stand out against the remains of a blue
background. A series of familiar themes such as the
<i>Annunciation, Ascension,</i> and <i>Pentecost,</i> surrounds a
central rectangle which depicts a <i>Hetimasia</i> or
<i>Preparation of the Throne.</i> Two narrow columns, stretching
from the lower corners of this rectangle to the bottom of the
banner, contain the inscription worked in metal thread. This was
kindly transcribed for me by an old man, the last of the savants,
and runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>In the year 7007, in the time of the pious Grand Prince
Ivan Vasilevich and that of his son the Grand Prince Vasili
Ivanovich and the Archbishop Simon Metropolitan, this cloth was
made by the intention and command of the Princess of Tsargrad
[Constantinople], Grand Princess of Moscow, Sophia (wife) of the
Grand Prince of Moscow, who prayed to the life-giving Trinity and
the miracle-working Sergius and affixed this cloth.</blockquote>

<p>Zo&euml;&mdash;or, as she was afterwards known,
Sophia&mdash;Palaeologina introduced the ceremony and aloofness of
the Byzantine court into Muscovy, and it is significant of the
importance attached to this link with the Roman succession that,
thirty years after her marriage, her maiden title should still have
taken precedence of her husband's.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the old man and I had an argument about
religion. The old man, whose great years seemed to render him
impervious to the terrors of proletarian censorship, said that
religion, whatever its form, must always be necessary to mankind. I
suggested that the necessity was now filled, in modern Russia, by
the new Christ in the Red Square. 'Perhaps,' he replied,
'perhaps.'</p>

<p>At the station, later, I caused a commotion by taking a nip of
vodka from a bottle I had bought in the village shop. Such licence
is not allowed in public. On getting into the train we heard people
saying that they thought they would risk the front coach, despite
the accident of the morning and the appalling disaster that had
taken place near Moscow two or three days before at a cost of
nearly two hundred lives. The train was a local one. There were no
lights, the seats were of wood, and the wheels, I felt convinced,
were square, not round. The atmosphere was like some unsavoury
anaesthetic. A Red soldier fell asleep on my bosom. Myself reclined
on the ampler person of an old peasant woman. So we returned to the
capital.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch1-9"></a>IX. THE UKRAINE</h3>

<p>The first really surprising impression that Russia had made on
me was when, after leaving the Polish frontier, I sought the
dining-car and found myself embowered in a coppice of cyclamens,
each of which was obscured by an enormous white bow. These bows
were not so incongruous as they sound. For the coach itself was a
survival from the same epoch of taste and resembled, both in
ornament and dimensions, the dining-room of the Ritz Hotel in
London. Indeed, these enormous broad-gauge caravans that lumber
across two continents are the traveller's first indication of the
Russian's inherent hankering after a kind of megalo-comfort. It is
a pleasant vice, and a sympathetic one to the Englishman. I enjoyed
those interminable journeys, with their ceaseless accidents. The
wagons-lits seem to have come through the Revolution without a
scratch, brass intact, velvet undimmed. The conductors have come
with them, pleasant old fellows always ready with a glass of tea
from the samovar in the corridor, and proud of their clean white
linen. Even the ordinary 'soft' carriages, which hold four, are by
no means unpleasant; choose an upper berth and you have control of
the ventilator in the roof. My best journey was from Leningrad to
Moscow in the <i>Red Arrow,</i> which passed three other trains
bound for the same destination and exceeded an average of thirty
miles an hour. In the middle of the night I was awakened by two
comrades having a dormitory feast beneath the light of a standard
lamp in a pink silk shade. Their mumbling gossip was not at all to
my pleasure, and I was obliged to shout to the conductor before the
interloper would remove himself and leave my berth-mate to go to
bed.</p>

<p>A week's journey in the Ukraine, with which my stay in Russia
ended, gave my companion and myself a taste of railway travel as a
pastime which may or may not have been typical of the country, but
was certainly varied in its excitements. The actual process of
departure from Moscow involved us in several days' unremitting
effort. My visa had expired; worse still, I had omitted, on
arrival, to register with the police. The Foreign Office was easily
placated, but not the police, who insisted that I should be out of
the country by 18 February. There ensued a detailed examination of
my notes, diary, and the books I had bought, on the part of the
customs, who finally stamped, packed, and sealed them in a manner
designed to reassure their fellows at Odessa. Lastly, a Turkish
visa was necessary. But the getting of this produced a pleasant
surprise. For the Turkish officials, generally so palsied and
tiresome, had been inspired to a brusque efficiency by the fabulous
incompetence around them.</p>

<p>After so much turmoil, the actual start of our journey, by the
7.35 p.m. to Harkov, seemed like Nirvana itself. Owing to the
vagaries of a rival train, which had accidentally escaped from the
station on to our line, our actual departure was delayed an hour.
We arrived at Harkov correspondingly late next morning and at once
conceived a dislike for the town, which is without feature except
for a good modernist post office and the Palace of Industry. The
latter lies on the outskirts of the place, and when complete will
form a circle of skyscrapers, joined by bridges, in the middle of
an empty plain. Even now, with only one-fifth of its circumference
built, its appearance is that of an industrial 'folly', whose
architect has tried to go one better than Stonehenge. We also
discovered that the only hotel was full. All they could allow us
was the temporary use of a suite containing the luggage, though not
the person, of a French duchess. We borrowed her bathroom to shave
in; but delicacy forbade us to appropriate her bed, and as there
was nowhere else to stay, we decided to go on to Dnieperstroy that
night, to see the dam. This was a departure from our programme,
which had been so arranged as to avoid the Five-Year Plan. But
foreseeing the questions that would be asked at home, we now
concluded we ought to have something to say on that subject.</p>

<p>Before leaving, we lunched at the 'Dynamo Country Club' outside
the town, a spacious institution approached by two modernist lodges
and having its own stadium where a few of the members were engaged
in a desultory game of ice-hockey. The walls of the dining-room
were severely panelled in the modern French style with woods of
various colours; the lighting was in glass strips, flush with the
wood and running up the walls and along the ceiling. But the
designer responsible for this elegant severity could scarcely have
foreseen the addition of a whole forest of barrel-trunked palms
fifteen feet high and tied, once more, with giant bows. When, too,
each table sported a dead chrysanthemum also tied with two and
sometimes three white bows, the room itself resembled more a
deserted florist's than an essay in collectivist psycho-furnishing.
The food, apart from these impediments, was
delicious&mdash;Ukrainian borstch with cream, kidneys and potatoes,
and tangerine salad. Then we drove to the station, where we found
ourselves ushered into the Tsar's waiting-room. For our guide,
foreseeing difficulty in securing sleepers at such short notice,
had given the authorities to understand that we were persons of
high importance, on whose comfort would depend the future course of
relations between Russia and England. Our conversation with the
station-master, who came hurrying along to pay his respects, was
truly royal in character:</p>

<p>'Sixty trains per day before the war and 115 now? You don't say
so!'</p>

<p>'Certainly; and in summer there are 129.'</p>

<p>'What strides!'</p>

<p>'The place has grown since the capital was moved from Odessa. In
1913 there were only 286,000 inhabitants. Now there are
600,000.'</p>

<p>We acted as though we could hardly believe our ears, with the
result that, when the train came in, a whole compartment was
emptied of protesting passengers to make room for us. In the
corridor hung a notice offering prizes to travellers and transport
workers for sensible suggestions anent the management of the
railway. Before the end of the week we had several suggestions to
make.</p>

<p>Sleep that night came fitfully. At 3 a.m. the train almost broke
in half and I received a sharp blow on the temple from an iron
door. We were now at Alexandrovsk, and on descending found
ourselves engaged in a life and death struggle with a mob of
maddened peasants, who had been waiting several days to find a
place on a train. It was a horrible scene; old women, bent and
weeping, were knocked to the ground; we had much ado to extricate
our luggage, and then guard it. At last a car was found, just
vacated by the duchess, who was returning from the dam to her
violated suite. This took us several miles across country to the
new town.</p>

<p>Morning revealed brilliant sunshine, a hotel which, though but
lately finished, was already falling to bits, and an apparition of
poached eggs. After eating these we walked through the building
town, a scene of indescribable confusion, but tranquil compared
with the dam itself. Here, on the great elevated highway that
spanned the frozen river, two streams of black and muffled humanity
were striving to maintain their opposite courses, shrieking engines
drawing heavy goods trains threatened toe and heel alike, sentries
wrapped in greasy fleeces menaced each errant passenger with their
bayonets, and a wind like a jagged razor whipped across ears and
lips. For about three-quarters of a mile&mdash;the breadth of the
river&mdash;we continued thus, deafened and terrified, balancing
precariously on ice-covered rails and catching horrid glimpses of
the sluices below, where the water came roaring down from under the
ice, as the frozen boards of the footway creaked and gaped. At
length, in the head office on the farther bank, a conclave of
officials and engineers awaited us. Their brains, they said, were
ours to command. What, precisely, had we come to study, and what
statistics did we need? Such questions left us speechless; it would
scarcely have been polite to have admitted that the only reason for
our presence at Dnieperstroy was that of the duchess's luggage at
Harkov; but remembering a similar occasion on the Sukkur barrage in
Sind, I essayed some feeble questions: sluice-gates, forty-nine;
three locks on the left bank; nine turbines of 90,000 horse-power.
The officials were not deceived. With admirable tact they changed
the subject by asking us what we should like for lunch.</p>

<p>Armed with a special pass, I departed to take photographs. Owing
to the position of the sun, this meant returning to the bank whence
we had come, and reluctant to face the terrors of the bridge, I
decided to entrust myself to the ice, promising to keep carefully
to existing tracks, since the rate of unexplained disappearances
had lately become alarmingly high. Suddenly, as I reached the very
middle of the river, a cannon started to fire; blinded by the
glare, I could scarcely see where I was going, and now I began to
imagine that the whole surface of the river was about to shiver and
crack beneath this fusillade of noise. Then my eyelids froze
together; this, at least, I reflected, had been spared St Peter.
Tottering forward, I reached the bank at last, to be greeted by a
man of wild aspect, who jumped out from behind a slag-heap, and
after demanding a cigarette, which I gave him, ran away as though I
were a leper. I now walked for a mile down-stream in search of a
vantage-point. In the distance, the dam stretched across the river
like some huge grey fortification, partly hidden by clouds of
steaming spray. Trains, diminutive as those in film collisions,
crept along its top. From the forty-nine sluice-gates came the
water from under the ice, swirling down the rapids formed by two
rocky islets, and bearing on its surface a spate of tiny ice-floes,
round and white as polar lotuses.</p>

<p>We lunched in a sort of seaside villa, one of a row built for
the now departed American experts. The food, elaborately dished and
served, was admirable. Flagons of vodka were followed by Crimean
champagne. The more we swallowed, the more argumentative everyone
became. We Europeans, we said, were possessors of a cultural and
political inheritance which had accrued during two thousand years,
and which we now saw no reason to throw away. The Russians replied
that it was merely a class inheritance. In that case, we
maintained, we required no further justification of a ruling class.
Finally, our host, who was an educated man of delightful manners,
said that whatever one might think of socialism in the abstract, in
practice one could not live in Russia to-day unless sustained by a
belief in it. We then turned to country sports. Game, our host
informed us, was by no means free. He belonged to a club in order
to shoot, which cost him sixty roubles a year; as his salary was
6,000, this, he thought, was not excessive. He regretted that he
had not got us a hare for lunch. In the old days they used to hunt
hares and foxes with borzois; but not now; it damaged the peasants'
corn.</p>

<p>In the evening we attended a concert given by a Ukrainian choir.
The programme was in two parts: the first, traditional; the second,
and longer, ideological. The latter was rendered the more tedious
by the presence of a composer, who set about teaching both
performers and audience some feeble revolutionary ditties of his
own composing. At the end of the concert, the distinguished
foreigners were handed a visitors' book, for signatures and
comment. This is the usual procedure among these vain redeemers. At
the dam we had confined our praise to the cuisine, feeling that the
duchess had done enough for the engineering with the words 'Oeuvre
des Titans!' Now we wrote that, admirable as the singing had been,
we could not help regretting that it should have been wasted on
such deplorable material. It was a little uncivil, perhaps, and
caused some dismay, but we felt the necessity now and then of
sounding some note other than the Shavian parrot-song which all
English visitors to Russia are expected to utter.</p>

<p>Midnight found us once more at Alexandrovsk, seated on a hard
bench in the station-master's office. The train was two hours late;
its electricity had failed, and there was only one candle, which we
stole. But as was usual in my experience, the bed-linen was clean
and the conductor did his best to make us comfortable. Not even the
inevitable accident disturbed our sleep.</p>

<p>Back in Harkov again, we received a call from the director of
the Opera. He wore a coat of Siberian stag, whose hairs rattled
like straw and rained to the ground as he moved. This he had
acquired while making a film in the Arctic. Had the film been a
success? we asked. 'Oh dear, no&mdash;not nearly enough ideology in
it.' He preferred his present job. Classics were classics and could
not be interfered with.</p>

<p>After dinner, eaten to a band, we started for Kiev, on a journey
which proved the eeriest of them all, and confirmed in me a
suspicion that the chief value to Russia, and to the world, of the
Five-Year Plan will be its unassailable witness to the futility of
materialist economics. This time it was the heating that had
failed. I sat huddled in my flea-bag. We had two strangers with us:
one a member of the secret police in horn spectacles, who looked
like Harold Lloyd in the r&ocirc;le of Torquemada; the other a
nondescript, who suddenly announced that he was getting out at
Poltava. What a name for one's destination, I mused, and pictured
Charles XII fleeing in his litter. It was our fourth successive
night in the train. When we woke, the sun was shining and the train
had stopped. An accident, of course, we knew. But this time it was
something to wake up for. The hind coach of a local train in front
of us had become derailed owing to overloading. As we and the other
passengers stood bareheaded in the snow, a single engine steamed
majestically past us down the line carrying away nineteen bodies in
a luggage van. Forty more were injured and our remaining whisky
allayed the misery of a bearded, bleeding old peasant.</p>

<p>There seemed little chance of continuing that morning. At the
back of our train was a special coach with wireless aerial and
Packard car attached, containing the President of the Ukraine. From
here we were able to borrow hot water and make ourselves soup. At
last, as dusk fell, we steamed into Kiev along the banks of the
Dnieper. From a wooded hill, the golden domes of the Pechersky
monastery flashed their famous welcome over snow and forest and the
huge frozen river&mdash;no welcome of hope to faithful pilgrims,
but a message of impotence and desuetude in a world of trained
cynics.</p>

<p>The chef at the hotel was an artist, and also a friend of our
guide. He gave us a dinner of fabulous excellence&mdash;for which,
and for its fellow the next night, the manager tried to charge us
&pound;50. Afterwards we went to the theatre where Stolypin was
shot in 1911, and saw <i>Prince Igor.</i> This one performance was
worth a whole week of the pretentious Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow.
The audience, too, was different; its faces were more cheerful, its
clothes less devoid of amenity. Next morning we met the duchess,
face to face, in the hall of the hotel. 'I'm leaving for Poland
this moment', she said. 'Come and see me in Paris.' Her scent,
which lingered, was a cheerful reminder of class privilege.</p>

<p>The treasures and monuments of Kiev are many, as befits the
earliest and most civilized of Russian capitals. Our first visit
was to the cathedral, which was built in 1036 on a Greek model, but
was so restored in 1705 by the Hetman Mazeppa that its architecture
is now interesting mainly as an example of Ukrainian baroque.
Inside, however, the main apse has retained its original mosaics,
which are dominated by a great Virgin. This figure, which seems but
mediocre in photographs, revealed to us a masterpiece of Byzantine
art in its highest epoch.</p>

<p>According to Professor Vassilievich, the surface of the vault
which bears the Virgin comprises not one curve but three; so that
if a section of the structure were cut through from the roof and
observed from the side, it would resemble the sketch opposite. The
top curve contains the head and shoulders, the middle curve the
belly and thighs, and the lower curve the knees and all below them.
This device saves the figure from an appearance of toppling
forward, and prevents the head from assuming a size
disproportionate to the rest of the body. An Italian would have
suited his drawing to the vault. The Greeks chose to adapt the
vault lest it should distort their drawing.</p>

<p>The colours of the Kiev Virgin are unique in Byzantine mosaic,
and unique, therefore, in their effect, among all works of art. The
figure stands alone, without scenery or fellow&mdash;an apparition
of majesty in the gold emptiness of its quadrant. The arms are
uplifted from the elbows, in austere mediation between man and God;
the knees bend and the feet are planted apart. A voluminous robe
permits the contours of the legs. From the shoulders depends a
mantle, which is swathed diagonally across the bosom and drops
fanwise to the level of the knees behind, in a cascade of angular
creases. This mantle secretes its colour in a tone of unfathomable
darkness, on which the high-lights of each crease repeat, though
with more glitter, the gold of the background. But the robe beneath
the mantle, together with the sleeves that protrude from it, are
invested with a tint whose radiant singularity no one that has seen
it can ever forget. This tint is a porcelain blue, the blue of
harebells or of a Siamese cat's eyes, an adamant, extrusive colour
that stands clear from the aureate haze of the vault to proclaim
its wearer's invincible personality. Below the robe, shoes of royal
scarlet complete this proclamation. Round the waist is tied a cord
of lilac pink, whose brightness exactly equals the brightness of
the blue and which strikes a mean between that colour and the
scarlet of the shoes, thus forming, despite its tiny area, the
pivot of the entire composition. On the cord hangs negligently a
little gold towel with a fringe. The sleeves have tight, patterned
cuffs, also in gold.</p>

<p>On the curving wall, immediately under the vault, appears the
<i>Double Communion.</i> The Apostles, six on either side, approach
with loping tread a canopied altar, at whose either corner a
separate Christ dispenses the two elements. The draperies of the
Apostles are grey, buff yellow, and white, sewn with double seams
of an emphatic red. Christ wears a dark blue mantle above a gold
robe. Faces, hands, and feet are rendered in shell-pink, and the
whole mosaic has a fresh and airy quality which contrasts with the
overwhelming, solitary grandeur of the figure above. In a second
zone, below the Apostles, stands a row of Early Fathers, hieratic
figures which have been restored from the hips downwards.</p>

<p>The cathedral contains, besides other more fragmentary mosaics,
a superb Byzantine relic in the shape of Prince Yaroslav's tomb.
This potentate, whose daughter married King Harold of England, died
in 1054 after bringing the Kievan civilization to the height of its
early splendour. His tomb is a monumental sarcophagus, about nine
feet long, which lies in a dark chapel half-hidden by the
encircling walls and by a floor-level which has encroached
considerably on its original height. In general form, with its
acroteria and sloping roof, it resembles those ark-like porphyry
coffins that once held the Byzantine Emperors and now stand in a
row outside the Museum at Constantinople. But in this case the
material is white marble from the Proconnesus, and the whole
visible surface is richly carved in the style of the sarcophagi at
Ravenna, though with the addition of later motives. Russian
authorities concur in dating the tomb of Yaroslav from the sixth
century, and presume it to have been brought from Kherson on the
death of the prince.</p>

<p>At the west end of the cathedral, on either side of the main
entrance, are two broad spiral staircases, whose walls were painted
in the eleventh century with scenes of secular life in
Constantinople. The rarity of such scenes, even in manuscript
illuminations, is notorious. And when we found the iron gates
leading to each staircase locked, we promptly sent our cards to
Professor Vassilievich, who lived in a house near by and was, we
were told, engaged in the reparation of the paintings. Though it
was a 'sixth day', and therefore a holiday, the Professor most
kindly emerged from his leisure and eventually devoted a large part
of the day to showing us round the town.</p>

<p>The paintings on the staircase were discovered about the middle
of the last century, when they were ruthlessly restored. After
three years' work, one series has now been almost wholly
disencumbered of its accretions. It begins with hunting incidents,
such as a man shooting with a bow and arrow at an animal in a tree,
or a rider on a white horse being attacked by a lion. Farther up
appear individual portraits, equestrian and otherwise, framed each
by two columns and surmounted by the badges of the Hippodrome
factions, of which the most frequent is a black crescent on a blue
circle. These, it is thought, must represent the faction champions.
Then comes the royal box, an extension of the Great Palace,
tenanted by the Emperor and Empress, and also the box of the
diplomatic corps, whose occupants appear to be Persians. Other
spectators of high rank are grouped in a series of loggias. The
entertainment offered by the Hippodrome games comprises a man in
Turkish fancy dress, three horsemen chasing a wild horse, mummers
in odd costumes, men playing pipes and harp, and a boy climbing a
pole balanced on a man's shoulder after the fashion described by
Liutprand during the Christmas dinner of the Emperor Constantine
Porphyrogenitus. Various graffiti have lately come to light, which
are in Greek, and from which it may therefore be supposed that the
artist was a Greek, painting from memory the scenes he had actually
witnessed.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Professor Vassilievich, we now drove to the
monastery of St Michael, whose church contains an uninspired
twelfth-century mosaic of the <i>Double Communion,</i> a copy,
probably by Russian artists, of the same theme in the cathedral.
More interesting proved two red-granite plaques of mounted saints
in low relief, which date from the twelfth century and have a
Middle Eastern look. Each plaque depicts two riders affronted: one,
SS. Theodore Stratilates and Mercury, the other SS. George and
Demetrius. The first pair tramples a dragon; the second, a man in
armour, who may represent Julian the Apostate. Thence we continued
to the monastery of St Cyril on the outskirts of the town, whose
few remaining frescoes have already been mentioned.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Professor Vassilievich took us to the
Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, where we bought the first and only
volume of its newly started Annual, showed us the old bookshops,
and introduced us to such friends as he met in a manner which
seemed quite abnormal after the ferocious isolation of Moscow. It
was like an afternoon at Oxford. Even at the present time, he said,
there were 50,000 students in the town. He talked of his boyhood
and the Civil War, when Kiev was captured and recaptured fifteen
times, and once three times in a single day; sometimes, for nearly
a week at a time, it was impossible to go out for the
street-fighting. After dinner, following his advice, we went to the
cathedral to hear the Saturday evening service. Scene and singing
had a tragic grandeur. From her glowing golden vault the giant
Virgin gazed upon the packed congregation with eyes nine centuries
old, while the basses boomed like water-beasts in the jungle and
the trebles wildly rose. At the climax of the service the
sacristan, with whom we had made friends in the morning, beckoned
us behind the iconostasis, where the priests, in gorgeous copes,
were performing their private evolutions about the altar. It was
with some embarrassment that we profaned these mysteries. But their
sacred character was lessened by the sight of each priest, whenever
his turn came to be exposed to the public gaze, running across the
berna and combing his hair before a draped mirror evidently kept
there for the purpose.</p>

<p>One more journey lay in front of us. There had, of course, been
an accident on the line, and the train, which was due in at 6.30
p.m. and had made us hurry over our dinner, arrived eventually at
1.45 a.m. There was no further accident that night. But early next
morning the wheels of the coach in front of ours were observed to
be on fire. We waited an hour, while they removed it, in a wayside
station. Snow was falling in a thick curtain; through it, a
loud-speaker fastened to the station roof was relaying an old
gramophone record of Peer Gynt. It was our last day in Russia, and
the sound of those tinned melodies whinnying their glorious message
of scientific culture through the snowflakes, over the broken
train, to the white unpeopled landscape, served as a melancholy but
precise epilogue.</p>

<p>There was still time for one more mishap: another train got
ahead of us by mistake. Already the ship was due to have left. At
Odessa we drove at racing speed along the quays, while the sun set
like an expiring furnace across the frozen sea. The ship had
gone&mdash;but it was believed that she might be found elsewhere
taking in oil. Bundling some customs officials into one of our two
cars, we pursued the ship up the coast like a gang of bandits.</p>

<p>At one o'clock in the morning I looked from my porthole. We were
moving, crunching through the ice-floes in the wake of an
ice-breaker. The lights of Russia receded. Then we reached the open
water, and already the wind seemed a little warmer.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch2"></a>PART II. TIBET</h2>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-1"></a>I. THE AIR MAIL</h3>

<p>The journey here described may with some justice be called
unusual, since, apart from the survivors of the Younghusband
expedition and certain officers of the Indian Army and Government,
they are comparatively few who have accomplished it. Travel within
the Tibetan frontiers involves obvious difficulties, of which one
is an unpredictable degree of physical discomfort. But such a
journey as ours, when regarded as a journey among journeys, can
make no claim to be considered unique or even remarkable: the
difficulties were overcome with moderate effort; the knowledge
gained was such as to satisfy only the personal curiosity of those
who sought it. In thus unloosing a second torrent of personal
anecdote I have but one purpose and excuse; which is, if I can, to
please the reader with some pale reflection of the quality of pure
enjoyment which became known to me during my first visit to Asia
Magna. To travel in Europe is to assume a foreseen inheritance; in
Islam, to inspect that of a close and familiar cousin. But to
travel in farther Asia is to discover a novelty previously
unsuspected and unimaginable. It is not a question of probing this
novelty, of analysing its sociological, artistic, or religious
origins, but of learning, simply, that it exists. Suddenly, as it
were in the opening of an eye, the potential world&mdash;the field
of man and his environment&mdash;is doubly extended. The stimulus
is inconceivable to those who have not experienced it.</p>

<p>If, as I think must be so, the European can attain this
experience most vividly in Asia, it is to Asia north of the
Himalayas that he should go. There the very face of the earth, the
atmospherics, clouds, and colours, are absolved from all known
criteria. And there, in Tibet, alone of the world's political
compartments, have the effects of the scientific revolution not yet
intruded on the outward picture of everyday life.</p>

<p>From an early age the fact of Tibet's existence had coloured my
thoughts, fastened there by 'Y for Yak' on a zoological alphabet.
Later, in course of some military operations with my school OTC
near Goring, a friend and I fell to concerting fabulous schemes for
our future betterment: a visit to Tibet was one; but, we agreed,
the most fabulous. With the coming of responsibility the purpose
waned, as other purposes such as engine-driving had waned before
it. Until one day came a letter from India, tempting me with 'a
trip to Sikkim'. Sikkim?&mdash;the atlas showed a small state in
the Himalayas bordering on Tibet. Obviously, I might even see a yak
in Sikkim. But why Sikkim? Why not Tibet?</p>

<p>Modern literary travellers are divided into those to whom
expense is no obstacle, and those who profit from an absolute lack
of any money whatsoever to achieve picturesque suffering and
strange companions. I myself escape these categories. Unaccustomed
to starvation, and preferring, at all times, luxury to squalor, I
had neither desire nor intention of beachcombing my way to Central
Asia. Simultaneously, to effect even the preliminary voyage to
India under conditions of normal comfort seemed a matter of
prohibitive cost. Yet the phantom, once invoked, would not be laid.
Go I must, and set myself to will the means. How they occurred, by
what slender fortuity, was an event that still leaves me breathless
when I think of it.</p>

<p>I had been asked to join a party for supper after the theatre.
It promised little entertainment: at first I refused; then went
unwillingly, and still more unwillingly to a subterranean
night-club. There I sat, scarcely able to keep awake and preparing
an abrupt good-bye, when there entered an acquaintance, who
informed me that Lord Beaverbrook was in search of new writers.
This particular acquaintance I had not seen for two years, and but
for my weak-mindedness in sitting up when I should have been
asleep, might not have seen for another two.</p>

<p>It was already plain to me that since the initial difficulty of
reaching India at all was to all intents and purposes
insurmountable, I had best aim at travelling by the most expensive
route possible. This was the Air Mail, which had then been only a
week or two in regular service. If Lord Beaverbrook wanted new
writers, he might want new subjects also. Let me offer both.</p>

<p>Next day, thanks to the good offices of our mutual friend, I
visited Lord Beaverbrook. Undeterred by the exuberant presence of
Lord Castlerosse, I treated my host to several profound thoughts
(hastily formulated in the taxi) on the more effective welding of
our imperial ties; observing, though without undue emphasis, what a
vista of possibilities had been opened by this new route to the
East. My seed, though I did not know it, fell on a rich plough. For
a fortnight later Lord Beaverbrook's Empire Free Trade Campaign
burst on the public.</p>

<p>I pursued this advantage. Numerous conversations followed. I
even attempted, without success, to write on my chosen theme for
the <i>Evening Standard.</i> But my plans got no further, and the
theme was outside my knowledge. Meanwhile, if I was going to India,
the time was rapidly arriving when I must come to a decision as to
dates and make arrangements. At length, one sunny June morning, I
sat with Lord Beaverbrook in his garden overlooking the Park, and I
asked him in plain terms whether he was prepared to pay my passage
to India in return for some articles. He knew, as I knew, that no
articles on such a subject could possibly be worth &pound;126 in
the open market of journalism. But with a generosity which the
march of politics can never efface, he assented, walked indoors,
and reaching for an ivory telephone, gave the necessary
instructions to his office.</p>

<p>I informed my family of the good news, and feared some possible
objections on their part to the hazards of the new route. My
mother, however, could think of nothing but the drawing-rooms of
Anglo-Indian relatives. All she asked was that I should not bring
home a Buddha. My elder sister supposed that now I should have to
become a sahib. <i>'Are</i> you a sahib?' she inquired dubiously.
My younger sister, recalling the field of my previous activities,
muttered under her breath: 'Now it'll be tribes instead of monks.'
My father remained acquiescent, merely toying with the
probabilities and pains of sunstroke.</p>

<p>During the ensuing weeks my parents' ears were filled with the
precautions taken by past and present administrators of the Indian
Empire, men and women of all ages and complexions, to preserve
their health. One had worn a tummy-belt for forty years; another
had taken a nightly dose of quinine over the same length of time.
One thing was certain: my instant demise could be averted only by a
miracle; and the chances of that miracle would be dangerously
handicapped by a first arrival in the hot weather. Reluctantly I
submitted to various inoculations. The aeroplane was to leave on
Saturday. On Friday morning I enjoyed the important sensation of a
farewell lunch at the Ritz, attended by Miss Tilly Losch. That
evening numerous friends sent me telegrams, couched as though I
were going to execution. My ticket lay fatting in a breast pocket,
a book of coupons for lunch in this country, dinner in that, and
transit in between. I spent till midnight fitting clothes,
medicaments, and stationery into a kit-bag and a blue Revelation
suitcase.</p>

<p>The morning of Saturday, 27 July brought a feeling of relief, as
though it were the first day of the holidays. Whatever the horrors
in store, at least they could be met passively, and without the
exercise of that wearing initiative demanded by the packing of an
unprotected bottle. At nine o'clock I reached Airways House in
Charles Street. Body and baggage, I weighed two and a half pounds
under the permitted complement. At the aerodrome we hurried through
passages and barriers, and emerged from a door to find the <i>City
of Wellington</i> buzzing and roaring on the threshold; its three
enormous propellers threatened our hats with their wind. I crept up
the diminutive gangway to my seat. A door shut. And the machine
cantered across the aerodrome, turned, galloped back, and rose
above a sea of small red houses.</p>

<p>My first sensation was one of suffocating depression. But for a
quarter of an hour in a tin and canvas Flea, which looped the loop
for an extra 7s. 6d. and fell in half the week after, I had never
flown before. And I now beheld myself in a dark cabin scarcely five
feet across, twisting about in a constricted wicker space, and
convinced that my whole being would soon disintegrate altogether
under pressure of sheer noise. A long dormant home-sickness rose
within me, an ache for train or boat, the old and comfortable
friends of travel. A trip to Paris might be borne. But to
contemplate the continuance of this inferno of drill, buzz, and
roar, and these attitudes of a strait-jacket, for eight days on end
was to relinquish faith in the beneficence of earthly fate. My
mother's good-bye assumed an aspect of tragedy. I dreamt of the
lazy days on deck that might have been, or the blue velvet of a
wagon-lit, to take the place of these preposterous cretonne
curtains, over-waisted and functionless as those of a doll's house.
When Air-Marshal Sir Geoffrey Salmond, seeking to levitate himself
from the chair behind, accidentally rapped me on the head, I all
but turned and knocked him through the aeroplane. Only the
merry-go-round motion of the bumps provided some relief, which was
increased to pleasure by the sight of several passengers at their
cuspidors.</p>

<p>As we rose to between three and four thousand feet, the
patchwork of English fields, heavily embroidered in elms,
disappeared in a haze. A line proclaimed the Channel, and, after
half an hour's gloom, another the coast of France. Here the
patchwork was cleaner, strips and squares of ripened corn
interspersed with larger and more irregular shapes of green velvet
woodland; occasionally a white road showed like a lining beneath,
with sometimes a stumpwork of trees along it. One o'clock found us
at Le Bourget, lunching beneath a wallpaper of inebriate birds.
Those around us ate delicious omelettes. We, coming from England,
were treated to a parody of our national beef.</p>

<p>At two o'clock we embarked again for Basle. At lunch I had made
the acquaintance of a professional journalist, named Butcher, who
said he loathed flying, but flew everywhere for copy. He was now
sick. Eventually hills appeared, and clouds, the latter suffusing
the cabin with an odd winter light. Then the town lay beneath us,
and we glided down to the Birsfelden aerodrome, where the customs
house was adorned with a series of excellent modern frescoes,
depicting 'Porterage'. Hence a bus took us to the Hotel Euler. The
drive revealed the 'Crewe of Switzerland' as a charming, shady
town, with many old houses, fountains, and flower beds. The local
zoo was advertised with posters of seals.</p>

<p>From the hotel I went to the Kunsthalle, which, though
officially shut, was in fact open. The backings of a dog brought
its master, who, on my explaining that I had come by aeroplane
especially to see El Greco's <i>Laocoon</i>, admitted me to the
galleries. Unfortunately this picture was no longer there. It has
since appeared in London. The main interest of the collection was
the Holbeins, which included the famous miniature of Erasmus in old
age, and a water-colour of Edward VI of England holding a small,
flap-eared dog. The keeper drew my attention to the phantasies of
his fellow-citizen B&ouml;cklin, who enjoyed a great vogue about
1880.</p>

<p>After dining on the terrace of the hotel, and surrendering the
requisite coupons from our tickets, the party, now depleted to
five, proceeded to the station, accompanied by various officials of
Imperial Airways carrying the sticks, coats, and parcels that had
been left behind. 'We have to treat our passengers like children,'
they observed resignedly. The train was in; wagons-lits were
reserved; we disposed our baggage; but there was no engine. This
arrived three-quarters of an hour late, and then rushed through the
Alps at an immense pace, interrupted by halts of such violence that
on one occasion I fell out of bed.</p>

<p>Morning dawned in northern Italy. More of the company's
officials, smartly uniformed in blue serge and gold braid, met us
at Genoa. 'They don't half run the houses up here,' remarked one
passenger, who had not been in Italy before. After traversing the
untidiest port in the world, we came to a small barge, the property
of the SANA (Societ&agrave; Anonima Navigazione Aerea), where
poached eggs and strawberry jam lay inviting on a table.</p>

<p>Already the heat was sweltering. Out in the harbour glittered
the white Calcutta flying-boat, the <i>City of Rome,</i> with a
small Union Jack fluttering from its cockpit. After a slight delay,
caused by the checking of the mails, we went off in a launch. The
Union Jack was furled; the hatch closed; we were away. The rise of
a flying-boat, particularly when there is a swell, resembles all
that Luna Park just fails to achieve. The engines roar; the floats
on the wings dip, first on one side, then on the other; at each
wave a great bump lifts the machine. The speed increases, clouds of
spray lash the portholes; till suddenly we have exchanged elements
and the sea is beneath. After circling a good-bye to the seaplane
base, we set off to the south, leaving the coast of Italy on our
left. One of the party, Captain Bennett-Baggs, whose stature was
such that he exceeded in personal weight the full quota allowed
each passenger with his luggage, took the second controls.</p>

<p>A pleasanter and more intimate atmosphere now prevailed. The
portholes once opened, it was cooler; the noise was less, the
engines being set behind, on the wings; and the seats of inflated
leather allowed freer movement. Outside, the wings gleamed white
against the lapis of the Mediterranean 500 feet below, and the
floats beneath them looked tike huge silver fishes accidentally
caught out of the deep. From time to time the wireless operator
sent us messages: Elba on the right, Leghorn on the left. In due
course, we passed over Ostia, circling a salute to the seaplane
base, where we could see the Dornier-Wal machines lying each in its
little dock. According to schedule, we should have lunched there;
but the water was too shallow for a safe descent. Instead, the
engineer now produced a typical Italian lunch of ham, salami,
chicken, new rolls, cheese, Russian mushrooms, nectarines, and
wine. These we ate from tin trays, which slid up from the backs of
the chairs like prayer-book racks. There were two forks, three
glasses, and one cup, to assist us.</p>

<p>Another note arrived, asking if we wished to fly over Vesuvius
and look down the crater. We did. But when the Bay of Naples came
round the corner, a cloud was covering the top of the mountain. The
town and its dependencies, stretching in a circuit of thirty miles
round the shore, presented a gorgeous panorama in the golden
glitter of a southern afternoon, as we passed between Ischia and
the mainland, flew over Posilipo, and came spirally down upon the
harbour. New officials met us. The customs obliterated themselves.
On the bus, we talked of Mussolini as Mr Smith, and of the
pleasures of Capri in yet more cryptic terms.</p>

<p>After a bath at the Hotel Excelsior, I drove out beyond
Posilipo, and off the main road down a one-way track enclosed
between the high mud walls of vineyards. This led to a gate, within
which rows of painfully watered carnations bespoke the Englishman's
determination to carry his home with him. P. was in the drive, clad
only in vest and trousers, and abounding in classical lore. Here
was the rock, like so many rocks in this neighbourhood, where
Vergil wrote the <i>Aeneid;</i> there the palace of Lucullus, its
painted rooms still intact; beyond, the tunnel which Sejanus,
minister to Tiberius, cut through the rock to the same main road,
rather than use the drive which my taxi had reluctantly negotiated.
The R.s must endure it, as the tunnel is a national monument, and
must therefore be permitted to fall into decay.</p>

<p>Having undressed, we descended the cliff on which the villa
stands by a series of other tunnels and quarried steps, to bathe.
It was like a home-coming to float once more on the buoyant waters
of the Mediterranean, and swim with an ease that two years' absence
from the sea had made me forget. We plucked a fat sea-urchin from a
rock, which the gardener later identified as a female. At dinner,
the food was from the sea, the wine from the garden. Mussolini was
here referred to as Mr Jones. P.'s brother, then in the Air Force,
said that before coming out to Italy he had received rigid
instructions not to speak to, or be spoken to by, any member of the
corresponding Italian service, for fear of being thought a spy.
Afterwards, we sat looking over the bay, a semicircle of quivering
yellow stars in the blackness. Up in the sky hovered a stationary
comet. This was Vesuvius: the railway its tail, and the observatory
its body.</p>

<p>Recalling my obligations to the <i>Daily Express,</i> I made ado
to return, eventually leaving in a pony-cart drawn by a diminutive
brown Pegasus, which had no thought for the ravines that yawned
beneath each corner. A tram was waiting on the main road, which
took me back to the hotel. I sat up till one o'clock composing an
article, and rose again at five to type it.</p>

<p>Unbuttoned, unshaven, and unfed, I clattered into the hall at a
quarter past seven, to find the other passengers already waiting.
At a quarter to eight we were off again, crossed the instep of
Italy with an occasional bump, touched the southernmost point of
the Gallipoli peninsula, and, an hour later, landed in the harbour
of Corfu for lunch. I had last spent seven hours of an April day
here, painting an island, which had then been green and yellow. To
see it now dull brown gave me a shock. Above us, the lion of St
Mark spoke of Venice. An argument with officials ensued, who
forbade us to disembark our cameras, though we could see a party of
German tourists busily taking photographs on the cliff above our
heads. It was as though the fact of travelling by air had invested
us with supernatural powers of espionage. To settle the matter, I
produced a <i>laissez passer</i> from the Greek Minister in London;
whereupon, to the astonishment of the rest of the party, I was
hailed as a 'friend of Greece' and permitted anything. During
lunch, Sir Geoffrey Salmond said that he might be old-fashioned,
but that <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> was not a book to
leave in the drawing-room. Butcher replied with a perk of surprise
that all that sort of thing was ended now, and wasn't he a bit
behind the times? To which the Air-Marshal sighed: 'Well, I suppose
there are drawing-rooms and drawing-rooms.' He then recalled that
Corfu had once been British, and what bloody fools we were the way
we always gave a good thing away. It was on the tip of my tongue to
hope for a similar restoration of Cyprus from the Labour
Government, but I was too content to be in Greece again to bother
with an argument.</p>

<p>After examining an Italian Dornier-Wal monoplane, and a French
machine which was painted an aesthetic orange and bringing mails
from Beyrut, we flew round to the back of the island to see the
Achilleion, the palace built by the Empress Elizabeth of Austria,
and later vulgarized by the Kaiser. Then we continued southward
along the coast, till an easterly turn took us inland over flat
marshy country. Being anxious to take a photograph of Byron's
death-place, Captain Stocks, the pilot, invited me into the
cockpit, where I perched my feet on two aluminium platforms behind
him. As I stood, my head and chest were above the wind-screen, and,
since the propellers were behind, could remain there without
discomfort. Below us, a marshy plain stretched into the distance;
to the left, mountains; to the right, mountains; in between,
patches of water reflecting the blue sky; and all the land emitting
that subtle rosy glitter which is Greece. And here was I, on my
fourth visit in five years, arriving in the sky&mdash;arriving not
with rush and hurricane, as may be imagined; but moving with
measure and circumstance through, the blue vault; the great wings
spreading like a house behind me; and the pilot at my feet finding
it superfluous to exercise more than the slightest control over so
rational and self-sufficient an instrument of locomotion. The
sensation was superb and like no other. A ship is always on the
water, a dependent, humbler than the humblest wave. This proud
vehicle, on this unflecked, sunny afternoon, asked no visible
substance for support. Standing with head bare, drunk with the wind
that tossed my hair and ran over my skin beneath a fluttering
shirt, I travelled as sovereign of the universe, a solar
emperor.</p>

<p>As Missolonghi approached, I descended from my perch to the
space intervening between the cabin and the cockpit, where the
wireless operator sits. Here was a porthole from which, at a
whistle from Stocks, I achieved a successful picture, taking care
to keep the bellows of the camera out of the line of the wind. The
wireless operator, who assisted, was Mr Stone, familiarly known as
'Sparks', whose personality kept me happy during the whole voyage.
His round eyes and small piscine mouth suggested some ever-present
outrage, until, at short intervals, the whole face would expand
into a coil of smiles as ripples spread over disturbed water. The
face is a sad memory, for Stone, with Pembroke the engineer, was
drowned when the <i>City of Rome</i> sank with four passengers just
outside Genoa in the following October.</p>

<p>At length we reached the Gulf of Corinth, flying close round the
great obelisk of a mountain which stands at its entrance, and
which, for those on shipboard, is the first real view of Greece.
There lay Patras, spattered white over the opposing shore; there
Lepanto, a brown village beneath us; there, across the peacock
water, the SPAP railway running along the coast. In an hour we were
over Corinth. The same trains were in the station; the same
restaurant where I have eaten so many odd things on so many odd
journeys; the same slag-heaps whence I had paddled on my second day
in Greece. The Gulf curved round to meet itself, to end, but for
that diminutive incision which leads to the Aegean. Along the Canal
and over its bridge we flew, while a toy train puffed laboriously
across it, and a still more farcical boat crawled stealthily along
the bottom of the reft. At length, as we rounded Salamis, the
chimneys of Piraeus hove in sight, followed by the Acropolis and
the twisted cone of Lykabettus.</p>

<p>In Athens, to my disappointment, Imperial Airways had arranged
for us to stay at the Acropole Palace, a new hotel having a
bathroom to each bedroom, but situate in a low, slummy quarter of
the town, and lacking that maturity of personnel which is essential
to comfort. A flood of reunions awaited me. I learnt that the
bookshop had sold fifteen copies of my last book. Dr Zervos
presented me with a basket of Mocca coffee which had actually grown
in Mocca. Later we assembled at the Hotel Grande Bretagne, where
Stocks, Bennett-Baggs, and the Air-Marshal were already installed
in the bar. Dinner we ate at Mr Rompapa's open-air restaurant in
the Zappeion gardens, newly surrounded by an artistic trellis-work.
At midnight I dropped asleep as I sat. The other party sat drinking
till four o'clock.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning we left the hotel at the comparatively
reasonable hour of half-past nine. Just outside Piraeus we circled
low over a capsized fishing-boat, a grisly wreck in the crystal
blue water, and wirelessed a description of it to the mainland.
Butcher, the Air-Marshal, and myself were now alone. A following
wind brought us to Suda Bay in Crete by half-past twelve, where a
welcome effusively and lavishly English greeted us. For the company
had stationed here a yacht, the <i>Imperia,</i> formerly the
property of numerous millionaires, and able to ride any sea in case
of a forced descent in bad weather. A bathe from the side, which,
like all Greek bathes, will live in the memory for ever, was
followed by a six-course lunch set at a table whose posy of flowers
might have come from an English garden. Our appetites were
sharpened by the witticisms of Captain MacLeod and Chief Officer
Horn, who had lately been described in the English Press as 'Adams
in an Eveless Eden'.</p>

<p>That afternoon Captain Stocks again permitted me the joy of
sitting in the cockpit. The White Mountains, legendary home of the
human vampire, were cloudless, and he decided to fly across the
island and through them by a broad pass, which I had already
traversed on foot two years before. Stocks had told us how, one
evening in the dark, he was attempting this course, when the
altimeter stuck; the pass was approaching; he was unable to make
the requisite height; until, frightened and desperate, he knocked
the dial, and the hand jumped up three thousand feet. Such were my
own sensations now. With the nose of our great winged ship tilted
upward, swaying slightly, dropping suddenly, leaping up again, we
made as though to crash into the huge barren hill-side, as the
vineyards and cypresses gave place to a speckling of rock and
scrub. Stocks tapped the altimeter, which this time did not shoot
upwards. On which&mdash;though it afterwards transpired that my
apprehensions were simply the result of optical delusion, and that
we actually had plenty of room&mdash;we turned, avoiding, as it
seemed, the encircling mountains by a hair's-breadth, and executed
a broad spiral to increase our height. Then we went straight for
the pass. Still my optical delusions persisted. At every bump, as
the mountain currents tossed us from side to side and the wings
dipped up and down, the escarpments and rocky slopes leapt into
threatening proximity. I looked down. There was the road up which I
had motored on a cold October morning; there the house where I had
found my mules; there the village where an escort of police had
joined me; and there, cleaving the pass itself to a depth of a
thousand feet, the airless gorge down which I had picked my way, a
black thread twisting and bulging as it led down towards the sea.
We were over. Suddenly the island dropped away from us, and the
smoother southern slopes, arid brown in the summer heat, fell down
to the village of Sphakia, where I had slept the night in a
policeman's blanket already inhabited. From the top of Mount Ida on
our left to the bottom of the sea fifteen miles out the earth's
surface drops some 23,000 feet. As the island receded behind us, it
seemed as though any moment might see us engulfed in this appalling
abyss. Slowly and safely we descended, till the flat blue sea
gradually developed a warp and woof, and at last each wave could be
personally distinguished. We were heading southward for the coast
of Africa.</p>

<p>There was something impressive about this transition, in the
space of two hours, from one continent to another. From Spain, the
change is not so great; the coasts resemble one another. But here,
as the line of dead orange limiting the inky sapphire sea stretched
interminably on into the distance, it was plain that this was a
land like no other, endowed with different shapes, colours, and
lights, a vast land of black races and of strange self-centred
cultures that have remained isolated from the great movements of
taste between Europe and Asia. As the aeroplane circled over the
harbour of Tobruk, a burnt plain of measureless extent was
disclosed, rippled but never hilly, and merging, fifty, a hundred,
a thousand miles away, into a horizon of opal mist. I looked
involuntarily for Capetown. I seemed to recognize the place. Then I
thought of Egyptian art, and the recognition was explained.</p>

<p>Tobruk, the only landmark for hundreds of miles along this
desert union of land and water, is the capital of the Italian
province of Cyrenaica, and the centre of a sponge-fishery conducted
by the Greek divers of the Dodecanese. The town consists of an area
of mud shanties, interspersed with one or two official buildings
and guarded by a wall fortified with barbed wire, outside which no
Italian dares venture. Only recently, said Stocks, he had arrived
to find the quay covered with dead and wounded. Into a crowd of
Arabs and negroes, gathered on the one pier, and tattered and
draped in the proverbial colours of the East, we stepped ashore.
Tea was waiting in a small caf&eacute;, behind which adjoining a
courtyard filled with embarrassing domesticities, was the Imperial
Airways' agent's bed- and sitting-room. The latter he placed at my
disposal, whence, after composing another article for the <i>Daily
Express,</i> I emerged in a stream of perspiration to bathe. The
Governor, a depressed man wearing pince-nez, kindly lent us his
Ford, and also, since we were proposing to leave the town, supplied
us with an escort, lest a hostile force (silhouetted, on camels, as
in Purilia) should appear from over the horizon and steal our
clothes. As we drove along, bent and ragged old Arabs, seeing the
official flag floating from the mudguard, favoured us with the
Fascist salute, which looked more than usually ridiculous under
such circumstances. The agent told us afterwards that they have a
deadly hatred of the Italians, and that the latter are literally
not permitted to leave the town at all except in the bathing
season, and then only for a distance of 500 yards. The water was
delicious; but not Greek.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey Salmond was staying at the Residency, and Stocks,
Butcher, and myself dined alone on a verandah overlooking the
harbour. The agent, who was only nineteen, had written out an
elaborate menu. Stocks talked of his early trips during the
inauguration of the service, of the difficulties of obtaining
petrol, the lack of mechanics, and his own consequent
sleeplessness. The crisis had come when a hungry d&eacute;butante,
returning from India with her father, had reached up into the rack
and gobbled down the crew's lunch. Butcher said that the
Air-Marshal seemed a wiry man for his age. Stocks said <i>tough</i>
was the word. We gave him much credit for his charm of manner
towards the personnel of the route.</p>

<p>As we left Genoa, there had appeared in the sea below us a yacht
similar to that stationed in Suda Bay, which was then on its way to
Tobruk for the accommodation of passengers. Unaware of this,
however, an enterprising inhabitant had taken and furnished a house
in the back of the town, in which we were now put to sleep. Through
the windows came the sound of dervishes' drums. The rooms were tall
and clean, and boasted mosquito-nets and plush-covered chairs. On
being called at half-past four, I discovered a cement pool filled
with cold water, and was able to enjoy a bathe.</p>

<p>After breakfasting in the same caf&eacute;, we took off at five
minutes to six. The colour of the water was astounding&mdash;a
sharp, deep scarab-blue, beside which even the Greek sea seemed
pale. Inland, the desert stretched for ever, with no sign of a
human being. We crossed the Italian frontier, a range of low hills,
and dropped a bundle of newspapers at Mersa Matruh, where we
observed, painted in large letters on a roof, HILLIER'S GUEST
HOUSE. It was here subsequently, after two successive accidents,
that the Maharani of Cooch Behar dried her clothes and slept, while
William Gerhardi bound up the heel which the propeller had all but
removed. The weather had been rough; the <i>City of Rome</i> had
sunk that very week. Stocks, who had fortunately escaped that
disaster owing to illness, was their pilot. In trying to take off
he struck a buoy. After two or three hours a rescue machine
arrived, and they set off again, only to hit a reef. Water rushed
into the cabin; and they all emerged on to the roof, whence a boat
took such of them as the propellers had left intact to shore again.
I was in Calcutta at the time, and my letters arrived stampless and
stained with sea-water.</p>

<p>At a quarter past eleven came the beginnings of Alexandria. As
we passed Lake Mariut, an extraordinary illusion presented itself.
The water, owing to its excessive saltness and the angle of the
sun, shone absolutely white; while a long shadow, probably caused
by mist, exactly coincided with its farther shore. The effect was
that of a snow-clad hill rising against a November sky. Beyond, the
town stretched enormous. We circled over the harbour and came down
in front of King Fuad's palace.</p>

<p>On the quay we parted from the Air-Marshal, who was continuing
his journey by Air Force machines. Sadly I said good-bye to Stocks,
who had been a host as well as a pilot, and whose visitors' book,
now at the bottom of the Gulf of Genoa, we had all signed. I shook
hands with Pembroke and Stone. And turned to find Mr Casulli, an
acquaintance of three years ago, waiting to greet me with a
gleaming La Salle car. Having lately been reading those scarce and
entertaining publications, E. M. Forster's <i>Guide to
Alexandria</i> and his <i>Pharos and Pharillon,</i> I anxiously
inquired the site of the old lighthouse, whose ground reflector,
illumined by a giant bonfire, was one of the wonders of Antiquity.
As we drove along the sea-front, the tall houses, with their
weathered, plum-coloured bricks and ancient timbering, were
strangely reminiscent of our own Tudor architecture. At Mr
Casulli's office the cashier bore the appropriate name of
Athanasius. Mr Casulli talked of the horrors of the cotton-market.
Then we drove out to his house to lunch&mdash;a palatial residence
decorated in the Victorian Arab style and set in a garden of
flowering shrubs and trees. Madame Casulli said that her children's
English governesses always insulted her because they were not
supplied with English food.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-2"></a>II. THE DESERT LANDS</h3>

<p>The new aeroplane was timed, according to our information, to
leave at two o'clock. Aboukir aerodrome is some twenty miles from
Alexandria. Mr Casulli drove his La Salle at between sixty and
seventy miles an hour through the burning heat, past his own farm,
where he grows bananas, dates and cotton, and breeds Arab horses,
till as far as King Fuad's palace, where the road, no longer
subject to royal criticism, changed character and obliged him to
slow down. We reached Aboukir with five minutes to spare, to
discover that the mails from the <i>City of Rome</i> had not yet
arrived. Consequently there was a delay of an hour. The other
passengers, who were also waiting about, included two directors of
the French air mail from Marseilles to Beyrut, and a Persian boy
returning to Teheran after four years' school in York.</p>

<p>Eventually we took off at three o'clock in the <i>City of
Cairo,</i> a powerful machine, able to climb on two of its three
engines. The route lay over the northern border of 'the
Wilderness', that land where the children of Israel wandered and
suffered and children of Christian education continue to do
likewise. Very strange it looked in the afternoon light, a sea of
dunes, each rotund hummock casting an elliptical blue shadow on the
golden sand, till all were absorbed into a horizon of jagged,
opalescent mountains. The villages were few&mdash;small clusters of
square mud buildings accompanied by occasional palms and sparse
scratches of cultivation. Sometimes camels were returning to them
along tracks dotted serpentwise among the dunes. Even from a
thousand and two thousand feet, every footprint was visible.</p>

<p>We reached Gaza for tea. The Imperial Airways' hangar and hostel
lie some way out of the town, on the site of the various battles
which took place here during the war, and of which the Turks
generally had the advantage. A former gunner was among the
passengers, and as he had been badly wounded on this spot, and had
not seen it since, we allowed him to indulge his reminiscences. The
British trenches, which we later visited, were still littered with
bones and shredded clothing. Live bombs are also found, which the
local gipsies use for killing fish, to the outrage of resident
sportsmen. That we were now under the beneficent shadow of a
British mandate, was recalled to me by the following
conversation:</p>

<p>R.B. (<i>to the</i> HOSTEL SUPERINTENDENT): That's a nice
spaniel you've got there.</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT: Yes. Damn good with birds.</p>

<p>R.B.: Have you been shooting much round here?</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT: Don't you <i>know</i> that the grouse season
doesn't open till August the twelfth?</p>

<p>The hostel was comfortably planned, a double line of one-storey
buildings containing bedrooms, shower-baths, a dining-room, and
offices for the staff and mails. In front, a garden was in the
making, a geometrical arrangement of whitewashed stones, in which
bananas, cypresses, and one eucalyptus had been planted among
tree-geraniums. Here tea was waiting, surrounded by arm-chairs.</p>

<p>On my suggestion that we might bathe, the superintendent
produced a car, and Butcher, the gunner, and myself motored down
the seven miles to the sea. The Frenchmen declined to come; they
had had 'assez de transport'. On the way we passed through the
town, which, as my readers will remember, was formerly a stronghold
of the Philistines. Amos, Zephaniah, and Zechariah heaped their
curses on the place; 'baldness is come upon Gaza,' asseverated
Jeremiah. While Samson, very rightly threatened by the inhabitants
for practices inimical to public morality during his first night's
sojourn, snatched away the town gates. The scene of this exploit is
now identified as lying on the left of the general store.
Historians may cavil. But they cannot, we were glad to learn,
question the survival of Delilahs.</p>

<p>By the time we reached the shore, twilight was deepening. A
furious orange sunset marked the limit of the sea, against which a
three-masted brigantine lay anchored in silhouette. We hurriedly
undressed beneath a thatched shelter, and avoiding the melon-rind
with which the shore was strewn, stepped into water which was
almost too hot to be refreshing. Slow oily waves lifted us on to
the jagged edges of concealed rocks. A fisherman's line became
entangled in my legs. It grew wholly dark. On the way back the
driver informed us that he had just spent &pound;5,000 on planting
and maturing a grove of Jaffa oranges.</p>

<p>Dinner was nasty and inadequate. Since, however, the hostel
superintendent had only just recovered from one nervous breakdown,
and avowed himself threatened with another at the prospect of
exposure in the <i>Daily Express,</i> I told him that the catering
was beyond all expectation. The Frenchmen were patently
dissatisfied. But as there was no single person present with whom
they could communicate unless I chose to assist them, they suffered
in silence. After dinner we agreed that the French understand the
English better than the English can ever understand the French.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning we were called with tea at five o'clock, and
then told to go to sleep again as the mail train from Port Said had
broken down, according to its usual custom. At seven we breakfasted
off kippers, which Captain Alcock, our pilot and brother of Sir
John, had brought from Alexandria. Then the arriving mails were
found to be heavier than expected, and the aeroplane had to be
relieved of a corresponding amount of petrol. By this time the
superintendent was positively haggard. We took off at eight
o'clock, flew over Bethlehem, caught a glimpse of Jerusalem such as
Richard Coeur de Lion must have had, and came to the sinister
depression of the Dead Sea where the Jordan, a sluggish stream,
leaves it, carrying a bed of green up the landscape in much the
same way as it does on physical maps. In front, the Moabite
mountains expanded before us. The formation of the whole country
was most extraordinary, resembling a giant architecture. Domes and
towers, temples of ribbed ornament, bulging chimneys, obelisks and
cenotaphs, fa&ccedil;ades and dorsal roofings, were endlessly
repeated, to form a natural municipality of impalpable burning
rock, from whose bottomless streets wraiths of opal colour came
floating up the vast cracked perpendiculars. What wonder that the
Chosen, crawling ant-like about their pastoral pursuits, evolved
the forbidding deity for which this landscape must answer
posterity, as the coasts of Greece answer for the evolution of form
and sense?</p>

<p>By degrees the cliffs and canyons grew less, till they merged
into a sandy plateau strewn with black stones. Here, for no
apparent reason, we suddenly began to descend. The explosion of
rockets, which the pilot sent out to find the direction of the
wind, sounded like an engine failure. Alarm was dispelled by the
sight of a small metal circle, such as usually communicates from
the pavement to the coal-cellar, set by itself in the middle of the
desert, up to which we manoeuvred in a storm of sand, and which in
fact gave access to a tank of petrol. A quarter of a mile away
stood the fort of Kasr Kharana, a ruin, in whose upper chambers
skeletons lay still in their clothes. 'Hah! des cadavres!' muttered
the Frenchmen. Outside were Turkish graves, from which jackals had
abstracted the contents.</p>

<p>It was now midday, and the heat of the air, as we took off
again, seemed scarcely possible, like the conditions of a dream.
Even at five thousand feet it felt as though a stream of flames
were playing through the window upon the neck and face. Enormous
bumps hurled us up and down, to the visible distress of the other
passengers, as the wings dipped from side to side, and the
aeroplane fell through space like a stone, or leapt towards the
heavens with the quiver and thrill of a hunter at a fence. The
Persian boy and Butcher frankly collapsed; the gunner was
disturbed; and even the Frenchmen, experienced fliers, admitted
afterwards that it had been 'une voyage p&eacute;nible'. We lunched
at Rutbah, where the Nairn Transport Company rents a large square
fort from the Government of Iraq. Members of the local camel corps,
ferocious men with daggers stuck all over them and rifles in their
hands, guarded the entrance. Within the courtyard, which was filled
with tattered and irrelevant humanity, stood a comfortable and very
cool lounge, supplied with weekly papers. The wife of the
superintendent brought two tame mongooses to play with the guests.
She said that her chief amusements were learning to gallop on a
camel and shooting gazelle from a car. I shared a table with the
gunner, who, on discovering my first and more exclusive Alma Mater,
remarked that he wouldn't have thought it, and proceeded to
expatiate on the airs of her offspring out East. I was
flattered.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the heat became even greater. It was so
unusual, so improbably violent, that I wondered how it was that I
or anyone else continued to survive under such conditions. A lake
appeared; and then a muddy ribbon, fringed with palm woods: the
Tigris. A haze of dust proclaimed the city of the Arabian Nights.
We landed for tea. I asked why, of all invented hats, the Iraqis
should have chosen the black Victorian forage-cap for their
national head-dress. No one knew.</p>

<p>The Maude Hotel, a ramshackle wooden quadrangle, was prepared
for our reception. I retired to my room in the interests of the
<i>Express</i> and wrote: 'The heat is like a joke; the paper
shrivels as I type; the glass from which I drink, though filled
with iced ginger-beer, emits a sharp warmth.' Attached to my room
was a wooden bathroom, which I thought held the seed of hope. But
the water, having trickled through half a mile of pipe-line under
the desert, was steaming hot, and even after it was poured out took
seven hours to become only gently warm.</p>

<p>Dinner we ate in the garden, a spacious enclosure of date-palms,
whose bunches of fruit hung ripening below their leaves. Farther
down electric lights protruded from their trunks. The food was
excellent, consisting of fish from the Tigris, roast duck, and an
exquisite almond-ice tasting of cyanide of potassium. 'This hotel
has always good food,' said the waiter, with that aristocratic
intonation peculiar to Arabs. 'You shall tell other gentlemen.'</p>

<p>As Butcher and I ate, a sound of singing spoke a romantic
Oriental message out of the night. Our attention, however, was
diverted from its tragic cadences to the idiosyncrasies of our
companion, an American, whose name, if the reader will be so kind
as to believe it, was Boggins. He was suffering from an accretion
of phlegm, and was engaged in fertilizing a cactus hedge near by.
'I've spent the greater pat of the last few yearrs in South
Amurrica,' he informed us. 'But my company wannted me to come out
here'&mdash;spit...splash&mdash;'so I guess I came'&mdash;snort;
spit...splash, spit...splash. 'I believe Crosse and Blackman's are
yewerr leading manufacturers of canned goods, are they naht?'</p>

<p>'Crosse and Black<i>well</i> is the name.'</p>

<p>'Well, whether it's Black<i>well</i> or Black<i>man</i>, I guess
they're the ones I've heard of,'&mdash;spit-spit-spit,
SPIT!!...splash.</p>

<p>The birds in the trees above twittered on, protesting.</p>

<p>At this juncture, like the first whiffs of a gas attack, the
fact that Iraq was officially within the sphere of Anglo-India was
announced by two compatriots, who came to join us. 'Give the sahib
a whisky,' said one to the waiter. So I <i>was</i> a sahib, curious
though it seemed. 'What did you think of Alex.?'[*] said the other.
'My memsahib's there at the moment.' This remark was calculated to
inform me that, being married, he was not perhaps the guide to
pleasure that I expected. Undeterred, I replied that I wished to
see the town. Even though it was dark, my desire was surely
natural. Bagdad, like Athens and Rome, is one of childhood's
cities. 'What on earth for?' came the reply. 'There's nothing in it
but a lot of bloody wogs.' None the less I persisted, and stood
myself on the Maude bridge-of-boats. Across the huge river came the
strains of an Orientalized tango and the reflection of caf&eacute;
lights. Every variety of Arab filed before me&mdash;fat and thin,
draped and trousered, running madly, pensively singing, Bedouins in
1880 moustaches, the more sophisticated in those of Charlie
Chaplin, some women veiled, others (particularly those of
substantial bust) in the scantiest of cotton frocks, and children
tottering beneath fezes larger than themselves. The streets were
filled with dashing horse-cabs.</p>

<blockquote>[* Alexandria.]</blockquote>

<p>The party meanwhile had gone to the 'Arabian Nights', a gloomy
outdoor night-club, furnished with a proscenium at one end. At the
other tables sat Arab gigolos in Palm Beach suitings, Bedouins in
those gorgeous trappings which the features of Colonel T. E.
Lawrence have rendered depressingly familiar, and a few Englishmen
aglow with righteous indiscretion. Tarts in tulle and spangles sat
avidly in the background, while our group discussed their pasts and
those of every other white woman between the Mediterranean and the
Arabian Sea for the last ten years. 'That one, as a matter of fact,
really used to haeve a <i>very</i> naice little body...You see the
woman with the drum; a bit fat, what? When she came out with the
Army of Occupation she was a damn useful bit o' work. Then they
tried to send her away, and she married a wog and took his
nationality, and here she is for good and all, serve her
right...Soecially, Bagdad's all raight, I can tell you. The clubs
are absolutely delaightful...of course no one but Britishers.
There's hunting and poeloe, horses to be had cheap, and all sorts
of racing...What are the new shoews in town now?'</p>

<p>By this time it was nearly midnight, and as the 'shoew' here had
not yet begun, I walked back to bed, observing on the way that the
distant melancholies which Mr Boggins had so forcibly eliminated
during dinner, had in reality proceeded from the mouths, not of
wistful houris, but of large pink gramophone horns. I bathed in the
now cooling water. But sleep was banished by the piercing wails of
what I could only suppose to be a hyaena in travail on the floor
beneath. Stumbling into the courtyard, and out into the street, my
pyjamaed figure conjured the porter from the gutter, and he
silenced the animal, bringing me a large bottle of beer besides. It
was now one o'clock and I slept. At ten minutes past two, I was
awakened. After a meal of fried eggs, we drove out to the
aerodrome, and took off, in complete darkness, at ten minutes to
four. It must be explained that, according to schedule, we ought to
have reached Basra the evening before. But owing to the delay at
Gaza, and the possibility of water in one of the tanks, Alcock had
thought it advisable to stop in Bagdad, and make this early start
instead.</p>

<p>On land, it was comparatively cool. But 'hot air rises'. And as
we rose also, the darkness became a suffocating inferno.
Fortunately the pilot received a wireless message to the effect
that a following wind was to be found at an even greater altitude,
and was thus able both to increase his speed from 90 to 120 miles
an hour, and to relieve our discomfort. The arch of Chosroes at
Ctesiphon was concealed from us. And though, by the time we reached
Ur, the sun had risen, it failed to reveal the home of Abraham. At
Basra, the home of Sinbad, we landed to exchange pilots and toy
with a second breakfast at the British Air Force base. Already the
sun was sending out a pale, searing heat. Passing over a group of
oil refineries and tanks that resembled a village of small
gasometers, we came to the head of the Persian Gulf, and reached
Bushire, on the north side, about half-past ten, to find a third
breakfast awaiting us, this time of fish. We were now in Persia. A
soldier uniformed like the Shah stood by the machine. Customs
officials, to show their importance, rummaged through every cranny
of our luggage. A horde of semi-naked men, brown and black,
proceeded with the process of refuelling, mounting by ladders to
the upper wing, and there connecting the tanks with the
Anglo-Persian Oil Company's wheeled container by means of long
hoses. The aerodrome was blistering. As we prepared to leave, the
resident engineer begged the pilot to obtain from Karachi a
watering-can with a rose, as he had some seedlings for whose health
a fine spray was essential. Astonished at the incongruity of man
and his environment, we were off again, flying at 5,000 feet along
the side of a yet higher range of mountains. The shores of the Gulf
presented a desolate and purgatorial appearance on this blazing
August morning, lacking entirely the sharp blues and golden cliffs
of the Mediterranean. Land and water had been sucked of their
colour by the sun, and displayed only a malignant pallor.</p>

<p>During the journey, we ate sardine sandwiches, crumbling with
heat, and drank lime-juice and water from an earthen pot, which had
kept it surprisingly cold. The next stop was Lingeh, where
refuelling was again necessary. Here the heat became a white
delirium, dancing over the arid, pebbly dust, hurting the eyes and
weakening the breath. A few palms and a group of women stood in
silhouette, as upon a snow-field. A cluster of bee-hive domes in
the background sheltered a group of wells.</p>

<p>Crossing over to the southern shore of the Gulf of Oman, we were
now above the forbidding peaks of Musandam, a huge menacing complex
of whittled humps, grey-black against the baleful yellow sunset,
and cleft by two titanic fiords, in whose bottoms the water gleamed
a pale silver. This extraordinary formation is one of the oldest
pieces of the world; it stood before the Himalayas. Alexander's
admiral, Nearchus, saw it, but declined to visit it. Pliny knew of
it. Even now it is inhabited by a race known as the Shihuh, whose
language is unintelligible to other Arabs.</p>

<p>We were above the sea again, when the sun, whose intensity had
been steadily increasing since we left Genoa six days ago, was
suddenly concealed. The atmosphere became sticky. It was the Indian
monsoon, stretching out to meet us. Crossing a lagoon, we circled
over Jask, and landed for the night, having flown 1,070 miles that
day. At the aerodrome, a strange figure, with the bearded face of a
sheikh, but wearing linen plus-fours, greeted us. This was Dr
Williamson, a professing Moslem, and known as Hadji Williamson,
since he has made the pilgrimage to Mecca. A Ford lorry was waiting
for us, a recent innovation, which the inhabitants, accustomed
enough to aeroplanes, regarded as the devil. This took us to the
house of the Indo-European Telegraph Superintendent, a resident of
thirty years in one of the hottest places in the world, whose
employers had never troubled to provide him with a means of making
ice, though there was a large electric power-house almost in his
garden. He was not the first Englishman in Jask. Sir Thomas
Herbert, visiting the place in the early seventeenth century, wrote
the following epitaph: [Communicated by Sir Arnold Wilson.]</p>

<blockquote>Here lies buried one Captain Shilling unfortunately
slaine by the insulting Portugall: but that his bones want sence
and expression, they would tell you the earth is not worthy his
reception, and that the people are blockish, rude, treacherous and
indomitable.</blockquote>

<p>Atwood, the pilot, and I had thought to bathe. But as it was now
dark, and sharks had lately become as plentiful as shrimps in two
feet of water, even leaping out to nip people's legs as they walked
along the beach, we thought better of it. The heat was most
oppressive, enveloping the body in a clammy film. After a dinner of
stuffed crabs, we went to bed beneath a rush awning on the roof,
where a cool wind got up and gave us a full night's sleep.</p>

<p>The following morning we took off at six o'clock, and continued
along the inhospitable coast till the Persian boundary was passed
and we were over Baluchistan. Range after range of mountains,
ramparts of drought and desolation, stretched into the hazy
distance, pallid and oppressive. As we passed over a ravine, a
sudden bump sent Butcher and myself leaping from our seats almost
to the roof of the cabin. At midday we came to Gwadar, where a
single tent, a stack of petrol tins, and a pot of tea, were pitched
in absurd isolation on a plain of white dust. Not a house nor a
habitation was in sight, and the Imperial Airways' agent, a voluble
Indian, had taken the whole morning mounted on a camel to reach the
landing-place and prepare for our reception. It was exactly a week
since we had left London, and we thought of our first lunch at Le
Bourget, as we drank the tea. Then we re-embarked for India, flying
through a bank of cool cloud. A new coast appeared, arid, but less
forbidding. Ten minutes more, said the mechanic. The vision of an
American city in the Middle West expanded beneath us. We landed
some eight miles the other side of it, ten minutes ahead of the
scheduled time.</p>

<p>A number of dark-faced gentlemen in white leg-draperies, black
smoking-caps and umbrellas, surrounded the aeroplane. An English
customs officer begged me to inform him if I had brought any
gramophones, bicycles, or pianos, and if not, whether I was engaged
in gun-running. Some friends of a friend met me with their motor,
and pointed my attention to the new airship hangar, the largest
single-story building in the world, and constructed entirely of
corrugated iron. 'The number of men,' they remarked with relish,
'killed in the process was enormous.' This observation I
subsequently published in the Calcutta <i>Statesman,</i> to the
great indignation of the Karachi Press, who harped on 'Author's
Callous Remark' for several weeks. The casualties, it was pointed
out, had actually been extremely few. Having inspected the internal
height from which the bodies had fallen, we set off for the
town.</p>

<p>This, I said to myself, suddenly remembering, is India; and
looked out from beneath the hood. Beneath a depressing, overcast
sky stretched an asphalt road, black and efficient, whose
objectives were conveniently labelled on a white English signpost
in black letters. Occasionally a bungalow stood up, carefully
shrouded in a front garden. Otherwise the earth lay bare, a dead
mauvish brown, sprouting tenuous bushes of cactus growth or small
fig-like shrubs with mauve flowers that fluttered in the wind. In
the background ran a low railway embankment, interrupted by a
horizontal bridge. Above this appeared the distant towers of the
English church of the Holy Trinity, the Scottish Denominational
church of St Andrew, and the Gothic lecture-hall, all executed in
yellow stone. This placid scene was enlivened by a lady in a yellow
sari and a gentleman in white draperies on a bicycle, going one
way, and a string of camels, evidently afraid of the asphalt,
coming the other.</p>

<p>It transpired that my welcomers, without whose kindness I should
now have been in tears, had made me an honorary member of the Sind
Club, a palace of comfort, good food, and eternal drinks, set in a
compound of flowering trees, where I found myself in possession of
a suite of three rooms and the usual offices. An inscrutable brown
wizard with a white moustache was also at my disposal. 'To-night,
of course,' they said, 'you'll only want a dinner-jacket.' Ruefully
I apologized for the loathsome contingencies of air travel,
explaining that limitations of weight had prevented the inclusion
of evening clothes in my luggage. By day I might have arrived
wearing a grass loin-cloth, for all anyone would have cared. But
the Indian night holds no place for the undressed. The dilemma was
solved by my agreeing to dine alone in my room. This I did,
assailed by the sensations of a first day at school, and
experiencing that singular feature of Indian life, the difficulty
of ever lighting a cigarette owing to the unceasing fans. Outside,
a military band was playing composite tunes for the entertainment
of a 'frontline' dinner. To-morrow was August the Fourth; but that
being a Sunday, the dinner was to-night.</p>

<p>I awoke next morning to a whistle of wind that would have
alarmed Macbeth's witches, on which were borne the noises of the
parrot-house at the zoo: the monsoon and the local birds. Timidly I
ventured to breakfast. Nothing could have exceeded the friendliness
of the members; my diffidence began to disappear. But the pall of
my absent clothes hung over me, and I was motored into the town to
a Mussulman tailor, who that evening delivered in my room a white
suit with pearl buttons. The appropriate shoes were supplied, with
no less expedition, by a military boot maker named Mohonjee
Nagjee.</p>

<p>The week's flight, though I was unconscious of it at the time,
had left me exhausted. And in the interval between my arrival on
Saturday afternoon, and the departure of the boat for Bombay on the
following Thursday, I was content to do little. Various incidents
enlivened the days. There was the shock of discovering that
<i>chota hasri,</i> which I had always believed to be a form of
suicide, in fact denoted early morning tea. The men with whom I
consorted embarrassed me by asking what I thought of them and their
fellows. To which I replied, evasively, that I noticed a sort of
sadness creeping over those lately arrived. One afternoon we went
down to the harbour to bathe. It was a gloomy scene; heaps of
rotting fish lay about our feet, providing food for emaciated dogs;
across the water was a pier laden with goods trucks and cranes. The
sky was heavily overcast. As I clung to a rusty buoy, the
wretchedness of the world was completed by the unavailing efforts
of two Indians to land a cow from a boat with a high curving
triangle of sail like an old slave dhow.</p>

<p>But during this time my thoughts were really on the journey I
had just completed. I see it now as one of the great experiences of
a life, a period of vivid, unclouded enjoyment in its revelation of
a huge expanse of the world's surface, of unsuspected and
unimagined beauties, of heat and desolation beyond credence, of a
new pleasure in physical movement. Of the revelation that was to
follow, of India itself, I have written elsewhere. The present
excursion describes yet a further revelation. India exists, as an
entity conscious and distinct, on account of the Himalayan
frontier. I was now about to cross this frontier, and to record,
with my own senses, the degree of India's separation from the
plateau of Central Asia.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-3"></a>III. ANGLO-HIMALAYA</h3>

<p>Three persons were involved in the proposed expedition: G., who
had already been some months in India and from whom had come the
original suggestion of a trip to Sikkim; M., who was sailing at the
beginning of September; and myself. Once Lord Beaverbrook had
decided how and when I should reach India, M. and I, who were in
London, resolved to make Tibet the ultimate and definite goal of
our respective journeys to the East.</p>

<p>The first thing to be discovered was whether, under any
circumstances, permission could be obtained to cross the frontier
between Sikkim and Tibet; and if so, from whom. Inquiries were
transmitted to Mr Wedgwood Benn, then Secretary of State for India.
He replied that, provided we kept to the trade route, the
Government of India would place no official obstacle in the way of
our going as far as Gyantse.</p>

<p>It only needed the pronouncement of a Labour Minister on any
subject in the Indian sphere to provoke the ridicule of better
informed opinion. Insuperable difficulties were forecast by those
who knew, they said, what they were talking about from first-hand
experience. Apprehensive of failure, and bewildered by the
contradiction between authority and experience, I sought the help
of Sir Charles Bell, whose works on Tibet proclaimed him endowed
with both these virtues. Sir Charles said that since the
indiscretions of the last Everest expedition, permits to cross the
frontier had been harder to obtain; but that he thought, on
judicious application to the right quarters, we should find the way
open to us as far as Gyantse, where, ever since the Younghusband
expedition of 1904, the British Trade Agent at Yatung had been
accustomed to spend part of the year, and where a small detachment
of Indian troops was stationed to ensure his safety. A general
permission for travellers approved by the Government of India to
proceed thus far had been one of the fruits of his mission to
Lhassa in 1921. Gyantse, he said, was the third largest town in
Tibet. Naturally, I replied we were anxious to go farther, to
Shigatse or Lhassa, the other two. But on our discussing the
details of the expedition, its probable cost and our earliest
possible date of starting, it appeared that, unless we were to be
crippled financially by the expense of transport and physically by
winter on the Himalayan passes, Gyantse must remain our ultimate
objective; and this apart from the evident impossibility of
proceeding farther, unless in disguise and at the expense of
honour.</p>

<p>Here at last was some concrete and hopeful information. But our
satisfaction was quickly undermined by Lord Zetland, who expressed
lugubrious doubts. As a former Governor of Bengal, and one who had
not only travelled over the first part of our route, but described
it with charm and understanding in <i>Lands of the Thunderbolt,</i>
he spoke with a weight that could scarcely be denied. The Viceroy,
he told M., was our only hope.</p>

<p>By good luck Lord Irwin had just arrived in England on leave.
Fanned by the conflict of opinion into enthusiasm for a project
which he had previously regarded as fantastic, M. now got into
communication with Colonel Harvey, the Viceroy's Military
Secretary. He was optimistic. He would write, he said, in the
Viceroy's name, to Sir Denys Bray, the Indian Foreign Secretary, to
Colonel Weir, Political Officer in Sikkim, and to the Governor of
Bengal. This was two days before I left England. That same
afternoon we telegraphed to G. that if our Himalayan journey was to
become a trans-Himalayan one, he would be well advised to postpone
the bungalow reservations as originally contemplated. Sikkim, he
had given us to understand, was a favourite resort of Calcutta
holiday-makers. And since only a limited number of Europeans are
allowed in the state at any one time, he had been anxious to ensure
that we should be among them in the following October.</p>

<p>No sooner had I reached India and joined G., than fresh
prognostications of official opposition assailed us. I therefore
wrote personally to Sir Denys Bray, to whom Sir Charles Bell had
given me an introduction. He replied that the Government of India
would place no difficulties in the way of our proposed journey; but
that we must first receive formal permission from Colonel Weir as
Resident in Sikkim, a post which, though outwardly insignificant,
carries with it the highly important duty of liaison between Lhassa
and Delhi. This at last was a definite concession which could not
be contradicted and which was soon after confirmed by a letter from
Colonel Weir himself, warning us that officers from Gyantse were
being replaced about the time of our proposed start and that we
ought to reserve in advance accommodation in the rest-houses along
the route.</p>

<p>It was impossible to wait for M., and we were obliged to make
arrangements without consulting him. In course of a voluminous
correspondence with the Trade Agent at Yatung, we settled our dates
and stages so as not to interfere with those of the returning
officers. We received a frontier pass, accompanied by a list of
conditions which we must promise, in writing, to obey. The chief of
these were that we should neither fish nor shoot, since Buddhism,
despite the carnivorous dispensation accorded Tibetans on account
of their climate, objects on principle to the taking of life; that
we should not deviate from the established trade route; and that we
should subsequently write or publish nothing likely to offend
Tibetan susceptibilities without first submitting it to the
Government of India. It seemed that not only has the Dalai Lama a
touching weakness for the illustrated Press, but that he also
shares the susceptibilities of Western nationalism; and that on
finding in the pages of a London weekly a pock-marked harridan of
great age and squalor facetiously described as a 'Tibetan Beauty',
he was provoked to official recrimination. This, and similar unwise
pictures on the screen, were the work of what was then the last
Everest expedition; and it was generally, though wrongly, supposed
that there would be no other such expedition for many years to
come.</p>

<p>G. and I, who had been travelling among the temples of Dravidia,
now returned to Calcutta, where we fell to earnest preparations for
the journey. That we could go, and would go, was settled. But
formidable prophecies continued to distress us. These, uttered in
all sincerity, only echoed those of Sir Charles Bell and were
concerned with the question of physical endurance. Though we had
calculated (wrongly as it turned out) to anticipate the Tibetan
winter by returning before the middle of November, it was evident
that we must expect severe cold. It required some effort to
persuade ourselves of this fact: the climate of a Bengal September
is such that even to move across the room beneath the blast of an
electric fan induces a protracted sweat. Nevertheless, we ranged
through the bazaars purchasing mattresses, bales of vermilion
blankets, and sweaters. We employed a regimental tailor to make us
coats and jodhpurs of a carpet-like material, blackish green in
colour, and so impenetrable that each fitting necessitated a cold
bath and half an hour's rest afterwards. Wind-proof waistcoats, of
the type supplied to the Everest expeditions, water-proof gloves
without fingers, Balaclava helmets, water-bottles, satchels, and
all else that the polar-tropical nature of our route demanded, were
provided by the Calcutta branch of the Army and Navy Stores.</p>

<p>This establishment proved, in the matter of stores, an
omniscient and omniprovident godmother to our project. It happened
that Captain Noel, the photographer whose jocular sub-titles had so
disturbed the Dalai Lama, had lately arrived in Calcutta for the
purpose of revisiting the scene of his former exploits. Having
arranged a large commissariat, he learned, on reaching Darjeeling,
that he would not be allowed to cross the frontier. Consequently,
he had returned his stores, and the boxes which had been specially
constructed to fit both them and the convenience of mules were
therefore available for us. Hour upon hour we pored over lists of
commodities potted and commodities tinned, labouring to tabulate a
menu for each meal of each day. Eventually it was decided that
every week's provisions should be fitted into two boxes, which
could be carried by one mule. Each box should be supplied with a
duplicate list of contents, one inside it and one with us. Each
also should have its own key, and be supplied with the necessary
openers. The theory was ideal. But the practice resulted in the
contents of every single box being strewn over the floor on our
first night out.</p>

<p>At length M. arrived, lucky to have escaped the acrimonious
discussions which these attempts at organization involved. His
fellow-passengers, he said, had consisted wholly of generals. The
wife of one of them, finding on board a young officer who could
play the piano to her banjo as it had never been played before, had
had him transferred then and there from the Khyber Pass to her own
garrison town. Such is the convenience of wireless in imperial
affairs.</p>

<p>During the previous fortnight, immersed as we had been in things
of the flesh, culture had not been altogether neglected. G., to
whom linguistic obstacles are unknown, insisted on our taking
Tibetan lessons from a Sikkimese who was otherwise employed as a
translator by the Asiatic Society. His long pigtail and twinkling
elfin face, the spit of an autumn leaf, endeared him to us; while
his sense of humour bore with equanimity G.'s suggestion that the
whole language was an invention of his own, composed solely to
annoy us. The inflections defeated us entirely. It seemed humanly
impossible, when listening to him, to distinguish <i>'nga'</i>
(meaning 'I') from <i>'nga'</i> (meaning 'drum'), or to distinguish
either of these from <i>'nga'</i> (meaning 'five'). 'Not
<i>"nga"</i>,' he would instruct, 'but <i>"nga"</i>'; while we
strained our ears in vain to catch the remotest difference between
the two utterances. All we could do was to repeat the accursed
syllable in bass, baritone, and alto, evoking in reward a pitying
grin. Another difficulty was that the Tibetan language is not one
language but three: ordinary, honorific, and high-honorific. The
first is used towards the common people; the second towards
gentlemen; and the third towards the Dalai Lama. It might be
thought that these distinctions were merely a question of prefixes.
But no: even the roots of the corresponding words in each have no
relation to one another whatsoever. Our teacher had no experience
of teaching. And as we had no time to master the grammar, our
method was to conceive ourselves in situations common to travel in
all countries, and then to try and learn by heart the remarks or
questions appropriate to each. But as it was impossible to arrive
at a single phrase without first determining the social status of
the person addressed, and as at that time our acquaintance with
class distinctions in Tibet was not extensive, the greater part of
our lessons was taken up with rules of etiquette and deportment,
knowledge of which later proved of some value. Nevertheless, we
gradually progressed to such formidable structures as: 'May I wear
your yellow hat?' 'Can I become a monk in your beautiful
monastery?' 'But I must first visit my dying mother.' Our success
was illusory. During the whole trip we scarcely uttered a dozen
words between us. These, at least such as emanated from myself,
will be recorded later, with due prominence.</p>

<p>Among the rules of politeness which our teacher impressed on us,
none was more essential than that which entails the presentation of
a white scarf by a caller to his host on arrival, and by a host to
his caller on the latter's departure. These scarves, like the
language, are of three grades. But as there was no prospect of our
calling on the Dalai Lama we only needed to supply ourselves with
two. These we had arranged to purchase in the Chinese quarter of
Calcutta, whither our teacher, on the morning of M.'s arrival,
conducted us. A deep passage led to several flights of stairs, up
which we climbed. The floors were covered with red spittle, product
of the betel-nut's encircling leaf; whiffs of absent sanitation
floated through half-opened doors. Unwitting, we were ushered into
a room filled with sleeping forms, who arose only to display their
sores and bandages. Food and tea lay mouldering in yesterday's
utensils. Suddenly our teacher remarked: 'In Tibet-side, sir, you
won't find the shops and houses clean like this.' Hurriedly
purchasing a scarf, which was reputed to have come from Pekin, and
was indeed wrapped in a Chinese newspaper, we left the building
with foreboding.</p>

<p>M., thanks to the good offices of the Viceroy's secretary, had
received an invitation for himself and his party to stay at
Government House, Darjeeling, during the final preparations for
departure. We had hoped to attend the Darjeeling Knights Errant
Ball, the climax of the Anglo-Himalayan season, to be held on 30
September. It would, we felt, have been the Duchess of Richmond's
party to our Waterloo. But owing to the bungalows of Sikkim being,
many of them, already reserved, we were obliged to start a day
earlier than expected, and had to forgo this pleasure. We were
invited for Saturday the 28th. I decided to leave Calcutta on
Wednesday night, to make the last arrangements and acclimatize
myself to the height.</p>

<p>That afternoon, on receiving from the Army and Navy Stores the
railway receipt for the transport of the boxes, I noticed that
thirteen had been sent instead of the prescribed twelve. It then
transpired that G. and M. had gone clandestinely to order a whole
case of whisky, with a view to an orgy in Gyantse, where, we were
assured, we should not be welcome save as harbingers of debauch.
This extravagance recoiled on their own heads, because before half
the journey was over they came to dislike the taste of whisky more
even than that of water boiled over yak-dung.</p>

<p>The Darjeeling mail, like all trains that leave precisely at the
dinner-hour, was without a dining-car. Still holding a bunch of
cheese straws, I rattled off towards the north, tortured by the
coughs and sneezes of an incipient cold. The heat was extreme, and
the fans only served to increase it. Morning brought Siliguri,
whence it was necessary to proceed by motor. Actually a mountain
railway, two feet wide, reaches Darjeeling. On front of each engine
sits a man dropping sand, in case the wheels slip. But this takes
six hours, and I had much to do.</p>

<p>India was gone. My car, a crimson American vehicle, lavishly
appointed with silver plate and sporting an enormous metal serpent
that belched warnings to the corners, was owned by two
russet-skinned hillmen, whose round black caps, with their red
buttons and twinkling slit-eyes, bespoke the fringe of the
Celestial Empire. Their natural humour was apparent in their
driving. Birds on the wing we destroyed in flocks. But a cow,
similarly threatened, retaliated with a smart clip on the serpent's
eye.</p>

<p>The road led out of the station yard, turned a corner, and made
straight for a towering rampart of dark, greenish blue hills,
stretching this way and that as far as the eye could see. I felt a
qualm of disappointment. I had hoped of the Himalayas something
more than the Alps. And here, immediately, appeared that hard,
uncompromising prussian-blue, the enemy of colour and form in
landscape, which our grandmothers delighted to stipple from their
Swiss hotels, which explains why the German race have never
produced a single painter, and never will, and why there are so
many tedious interludes in Wagner's music. In a flash, we were at
the foot of the hills. We rose a little. And there, behind us,
stretching southward to an infinite unbroken horizon, lay the
turgid greens of the Bengal plain. The sun was already in the
heavens, a sinister prophet of the midday heat.</p>

<p>On the flat, the railway and the road had progressed side by
side. But once in the hills it seemed as though their courses were
the outcome of a game of catch-as-catch-can played by the engineers
as they went along. The road to Darjeeling ascends seven thousand
feet in forty miles, during which the two tracks, intricate as
sweet-pea tendrils, intersect three or four times in every hundred
yards, and once, or sometimes twice, on every corner, so that the
descending train may impale the ascending motor to the best
advantage. At every station the chauffeur is forced to stop and
inquire what traffic, engine, hand-trolley, train, cart, bus, or
motor, he is liable to encounter during the ensuing stage. While
the news of his own advent is immediately telephoned to the station
above.</p>

<p>The road, for the most part, wound upward through magnificent
forest, beneath whose huge arching trees it seemed no more than a
footpath. A profusion of vertical creepers, tassels of vegetation
thirty or forty feet in length, fell from their branches. Strange
plants and shrubs carried flowers that had previously existed only
on porcelain or in old ladies' bonnets. Gradually we rose, passing
from shade to sun and shade again, while rare glimpses revealed the
plains unfolding farther distances beneath. Troops of pigtailed
elves, of that rarefied Mongol type assumed by the peoples of the
southern Himalaya, wandered by. Such dwellings as appeared from
time to time were constructed, as are all the buildings in this
romantic region, of corrugated iron and flattened petrol tins,
painted red.</p>

<p>Suddenly, round a corner, the snowy back of Kanchenjunga leapt
into the sky, a stupendous horizon of glittering vertebrae, packed
with cotton-wool clouds, and encroaching on three-quarters of the
heavens. Below, a profundity of spurs and valleys, darkly feathered
in pines, was lost in shadow like the bottom of a well. The heart
beat; the breath came quickly. Until, round another corner,
appeared Darjeeling, and all relapsed into hate and misery.</p>

<p>Imagine Margate, Filey, and Bognor Regis wholly roofed in red
corrugated iron; distorted into a phantasmagoria of chalets and
ch&acirc;teaux, such as even they have yet to achieve; vomited into
the tittups of an Italian hill-town; and then lifted bodily on to a
long spur, a promontory rising from a sea of depths that seemed to
pierce the very core of the world; overseen by the white throne of
God, a continent on end, trees, cliffs, and shores of snow five
miles high, as the eye travels up them to the blue vault above; and
still preserving all the inevitable accessories of our national
life: the exclusive clubs, the Anglican, Scottish, and Roman
Catholic churches, the Tudor hotel, the seaside milliners, and the
polo-ground in the bottom of a tea-cup; streets without motors, but
municipally railed; rickshaws pulled and pushed by crowds of ragged
Mongols; tiny ponies with saddles like high-chairs for children who
can scarcely walk; all the races of the Himalayas: Nepali women
with their huge necklaces of gold beads and red flannel, like Lord
Mayors' chains; the elfin Lepchas and Sikkimese; emigrant Tibetans,
mottled lumps of turquoise in the men's ears, the women's chests
hung with enormous rhomboid charm-boxes, silver and jewelled; the
clouds, as the morning advances, closing in, arriving mysteriously
from both above and below, till the last glimpse of Kanchenjunga is
obscured behind a wall of mist, the valleys themselves are lost,
and at last, thank God, even Darjeeling is invisible but for the
two nearest villas and their front-gardens; such is the conflict of
joy and horror at the first sight of Anglo-Himalaya.</p>

<p>Having reached the Tudor hotel, somewhat out of breath owing to
the height, I changed hurriedly into a tweed suit, and having made
the necessary arrangements concerning the Sikkim bungalows,
discarded the tweed suit and retired to bed and a fire for two
days, in order to cure a dribbling cold. During this process,
Naspati, the local contractor for transport, brought Ah-Chung and
An-Den, whom he proposed that I should engage as cook and sirdar,
the latter to act as personal servant and overseer to the whole
caravan. P&ouml; kyeh schingi y&uuml;dgam?' I said, meaning 'Do you
speak Tibetan?' Their astonishment was profound; but was lessened
when they discovered that it was almost all I could say. A sweeper
was also produced, to perform the menial offices connected with
sanitation. I engaged them and, rising, proceeded to the bazaar,
there to fit them with new boots and sweaters.</p>

<p>That night the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> requested me to
share my dinner-table with others. 'We shall soon have everyone
sitting at separate tables,' he complained. Observing that the
dining-room held about a quarter of its full complement, and that
half the waiters were standing idle, I rounded on him with such
ferocity as to shatter his belief in good fellowship among guests
for good and all.</p>

<p>The following day was Saturday. Early in the morning I proceeded
to Government House, at the end of the promontory, with my luggage
on the backs of ragged coolies. The procession resembled that of an
impecunious pedlar. None the less a squad of small soldiers in
shorts presented arms at the gates, and I proceeded down a neat
Victorian drive, winding through pinched Victorian lawns, whose
appropriate conifers seemed about to topple over a bottomless
precipice on the farther side. At the end of this vista stood a
Victorian seaside boarding-house, beneath which, on a lower level,
nestled a less forbidding child. This was the guest-house,
approached by a terraced garden of Iceland poppies, which would
have been charming had it not been disfigured by the inevitable
commemorative slab, informing the future archaeologist that it had
been designed by the Earl and Countess of Lytton. Inside, however,
lurked comfort and good taste: flowers in vases, chintzed
sitting-rooms, blazing fires, and spacious writing-tables,
appointed with sealing-wax and gilt-embossed invitations to guests
to order horses or rickshaws at their own convenience. Those of the
latter attached to Government House were like small barouches,
picked out in red and resplendent with coronets. ADCs heaped us
with drinks. We could be in or out to meals as we pleased, provided
that notice was given beforehand. It was country-house entertaining
in perfection.</p>

<p>The others had arrived, and at lunch-time we were lined up in
the drawing-room by one ADC, while another fetched the Governor and
Lady Jackson. We were then introduced, ate, slept, had tea, and
afterwards received a call from Mr Laden-La, a twinkling Sikkimese
with a minute pointed moustache, chief of the local police and a
prominent freemason. He talked of Tibet, described his experiences
in the Younghusband expedition of 1904, when they lost a man a
night from pneumonia, and said that he had been employed on Sir
Charles Bell's mission to Lhassa in 1921. He had then stayed behind
to organize a Lhassa police forte, and had received the rank of
general in the Tibetan army. This army had now been disbanded, all
but a few regiments on the Chinese frontier, owing to the monks'
fear lest its leaders should be planning a <i>coup
d'&eacute;tat.</i> He was in Lhassa at the time of the Everest
expeditions, and when the reports came through of the films shown
in Darjeeling by Captain Noel making fun of Tibetan customs, and
the Dalai Lama had received his English illustrated papers doing
the same, he was sent for by the latter and called upon to explain.
At the same time, it appeared, a trio of monks had been persuaded
from Gyantse to London without the necessary permission, and had
there dressed themselves up for exhibition in the robes of their
superiors, a proceeding which had increased the displeasure of the
Tibetan authorities. In the period immediately following the 1921
mission he had actually transported two motors over the Himalayan
passes, assembled them at Phari, and driven as far as Gyantse in a
day. But these had soon been stopped. Conversation then turned on
the impossibility of proceeding farther than Gyantse, and those who
had tried to do so since the war. General Pereira had arrived at
Lhassa from Pekin, and had vowed that not the offer of a million
pounds would tempt him to return that way. Dr McGovern had reached
Lhassa from Darjeeling in the guise of a coolie, and had
subsequently libelled Laden-La, who had obtained indemnity from his
publishers.[*] There was Sir Charles Bell's mission in 1921, during
which the permission was obtained for the Everest expeditions, and
Mr Kingdon Ward and Lord Cawdor were allowed access to the river
Tsango-po or Brahmaputra. A French female Buddhist also reached
Lhassa disguised as a beggar, and turned publicist after the event.
Colonel Bailey subsequently visited the capital during his tenure
of the Residency in Sikkim. This year Colonel Weir, his successor,
was also to have gone. But at the last moment a message was sent
asking him not to proceed.</p>

<blockquote>[* We frequently heard it stated by ostensibly
well-informed persons that McGovern never reached Lhassa at all.
His account of his experiences there may be partially fictitious.
But that he succeeded in his objective, all who were in Tibet at
the time or immediately after agree. Furthermore, he was an
extremely brave man, as anyone who has travelled in Tibet in winter
will testify.]</blockquote>

<p>The most curious attempt was that of Mr Carpenter, a wealthy
American, who had succumbed, in later life, to the doctrines of
theosophy. It appeared from his account that there dwelt in
Shigatse 'three masters', from whom he used to receive messages,
transmitted no one, nor he, knew how. Anxious to visit them, he
arrived at Darjeeling and, with the help of Laden-La, composed an
ornamental address to the Dalai Lama, which was written on
parchment in both English and Tibetan. This was enclosed in a
binding of ornamental leather, in which were set, as medallions,
two gold ten-dollar pieces. The whole was wrapped in the requisite
complimentary scarf, of the third and highest order, being printed
all over with prayers; and was then despatched to the British Trade
Agent at Gyantse, to be forwarded to His Holiness. Mr Carpenter
waited; no answer came. At length, with our former Tibetan teacher
as sirdar, he started out with a large train and came to Gyantse.
There he waited again. Till at length he telegraphed. An answer
came back saying that there might be hope for him in four years'
time. Being a man of honour, he refrained from proceeding
surreptitiously to Shigatse in search of 'the masters', and
returned.</p>

<p>It appears that the only means of making certain of reaching
Lhassa at the present moment is to embrace the profession of
telegraphist. The telegraph and telephone to India are much valued
by the Tibetans, and have to be kept in order. A European was in
Lhassa at the time of our trip, superintending them.</p>

<p>Laden-La finally warned us that the villages were full of
ferocious mastiffs, who were liable to tear us from our ponies; and
that the monks, if we stepped over their lines of prayer-cushions
instead of going round them, might be expected to stab us in the
back. The dogs were certainly savage, when tied up; when loose they
were usually too busy with their amours to notice the casual
itinerant. From the monks we received nothing but hospitality and
smiles.<br>
<br></p>

<p>We dressed, gulped down cocktails as big as lemonades, and
assembled in the drawing-room for dinner. An ADC fetched the
Governor and Lady Jackson as before. Two ADCs preceded them in to
dinner, while they talked over their shoulders. This was in
contrast to the procedure of Lord Irwin, who, when I lunched at
Delhi, went in behind his guests. A regiment of <i>chuprassies,</i>
uniformed in gold and scarlet, wearing blue and gold puggarees, and
clinking with medals, formed a double line at the entrance to the
dining-room and made salaam as we entered. Simultaneously an
invisible band, concealed behind the kind of net used for
theatrical waves, struck up a nursery rhyme. We sat down. During
dinner the Governor recounted with indignation how the crowds at
Dacca, whither he had lately gone on tour, had shouted 'Jackson, go
back!' The nursery rhyme gave place to Elgar. The meal drew to a
finish. The Governor rose and said 'The King-Emperor', while the
band played it and everyone stood clasping glasses of port to their
stomachs, each hand trembling at a different pace. When the tune
had ended, all grunted 'The King-Emperor' and sipped nervously.
Before the utterance had died away, two ADCs had flung down their
glasses and marched from the room. The Governor and Lady Jackson
followed, still talking over their shoulders. Groups were then
formed for conversation, until at length Lady Jackson retired.</p>

<p>A few minutes later an ADC strode into the room, stood to
attention before the Governor, and, having waited for the latter to
finish what he was saying, observed: 'The house is on fire, Your
Excellency.' He then strode out again to telephone for help,
leaving us all rather bewildered. Ladies first, thought G., and ran
upstairs with a fire-extinguisher. 'Don't come in,' shouted Lady
Jackson through the door. G., who had never used a
fire-extinguisher in his life, was determined to do so now, and
emptied it up a neighbouring chimney. By this time a quarter of an
hour had elapsed. The flames&mdash;we wondered where they were.
Then the telephone rang. 'Is that Government House?' said a voice.
'I'm ringing up to know if there really is a fire.' Meanwhile the
Governor was lost. M. and I, shaking with laughter, emerged from
the front door in search of the flames, to find him standing
forlornly in a puff of cloud that had settled on the drive,
upholding an umbrella and blowing wild blasts on a pocket siren. 'I
keep on whistling,' he moaned, 'but what's the use? The guard
doesn't come.' Indoors the telephone rang again. 'Is that
Government House? This is the fire-brigade speaking. Do you want
any help with your fire?' The heroic ADC was now half-way to the
roof, hanging like a sloth from a drain-pipe and straining every
nerve to locate the flames. Suddenly the guard, the fire-brigade,
and 120 servants arrived in the hall simultaneously and stood to
attention. In face of such forces, further assistance on our part
seemed superfluous. But we should like to have seen the flames.</p>

<p>Sunday bore the proper English stamp. At first I cast it off by
going for a ride on a polo pony that threatened to precipitate me
to the foot of Kanchenjunga at every twist of the neatly gravelled
footpath. Then the clouds rolled up and in at the windows. It
became dark and cold. G. and M. disorganized the Government of
Bengal by staying in bed to breakfast. His Excellency and Lady
Jackson set bravely out for church in rickshaws drawn by men
uniformed in the colours of the Eton Field. Naspati arrived leading
three ponies for our inspection. At his command they cantered gaily
up the road; and thenceforth could not be urged beyond a slow walk
till induced a month later with whips purchased in Gyantse that
would have flayed a rhinoceros.</p>

<p>Midday, there was a lunch-party, which included the parson.</p>

<p>'Do you get much snow here in the winter?' G. opened
politely.</p>

<p>'Oh! quantities,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'How marvellous everything must look!'</p>

<p>'Yes; and, you know, it's such wonderful snow.'</p>

<p>'Oh, is it? How?'</p>

<p>The parson leaned forward confidentially: '...<i>wonderful</i>
for snowballs,' he whispered.</p>

<p>I sat next a bishop, robed in purple, who kindly quieted my
doubts as to whether the Abyssinian Church really had canonized
Pontius Pilate. 'Another curious feature of their observance,' he
continued, 'is their consecration of bishops by breathing instead
of the laying-on of hands. As the Abyssinian bishops-elect often
find it difficult to come to Alexandria, where the Coptic Patriarch
resides, a paper bag is employed as intermediary. The Patriarch
breathes into it. It is sealed, transported to Abyssinia, and there
exploded over the bishop-elect's head with a loud POP!!'&mdash;and
he burst into a thunderous guffaw which astonished the whole
table.</p>

<p>We had arranged to leave at ten o'clock on Monday morning,
though G. and M., a prey to mounting depression, considered this
unreasonably early. The mist was impenetrable; a heavy rain was
falling; we became helpless with packing; M. cut his
finger&mdash;'for the first time in ten years,' he said, and
doubted if he could start. Having said good-bye to our hosts, and
numbed our senses in Madeira, we at length set off in a motor to
some incorporeal landmark known as the eighth milestone. Nine mules
had preceded us; two remained for our personal luggage. As it was
downhill, M. elected to walk.</p>

<p>G. and I mounted our ponies. He, I remarked, had the air of a
Jesuit missionary about to win a continent. I, he remarked, was the
retreat from Moscow. From in front came a mutter of Virgilian
cadences, M.'s observations on the local flora. After an hour and a
half, tea-gardens and then a factory emerged from the fog and
proclaimed Peshoke, where their owners, Mr and Mrs Lister, gave us
a delightful lunch. Their visitors' book was a wall, strewn with
the names of the famous, each attached to a line denoting its
owner's height. From their garden, a precarious terrace in a world
of verticality, we could look down two or three thousand feet into
the Teesta Valley below, an inky well imprisoning a fleet of
porcelain clouds. We had started among rhododendrons and conifers.
Henceforth the vegetation was tropical, and M.'s remarks became a
saga. Cathedrals of trees, branchless for fifty feet, flanked the
winding cobbled descent. Parrots called; cicadas, unceasing treble
sirens, riddled the consciousness; sheets of cobweb, containing
black and yellow monsters, and crusted with lichen, tilted the hat
on the back of the head; butterflies like iridescent bats flitted
through the sun-spots; bells and trumpets, red and white, hung from
bushes or raised their heads from tangles of fleshy leaves. There
was no colour, no atmosphere; only a world of rich, downright
greens. At length the Teesta river came in sight, a broad muddy
torrent, caught between stupendous walls of forest, and spanned by
a suspension bridge. On the other side of this a motor was waiting,
which took us up to Kalimpong by an astounding road, the victim of
numerous landslides, which in one place looped round and crossed
itself on a bridge. My head, which had remained normal at
Darjeeling, had begun to hum to itself on descending 4,000 feet to
Peshoke; at the Teesta, only 500 feet up, it recovered; now,
ascending 5,000 feet to Kalimpong, it began again. Behind us, as
the sun set, all the hills turned to black, and only the motionless
porcelain clouds caught the rosy glitter.</p>

<p>At Kalimpong, we stayed at the Himalayan Hotel, kept by Mr
Macdonald, for many years British Trade Agent at Yatung in the
Chumbi Valley, to whom Sir Charles Bell had given me a letter of
introduction. He was assisted by Mr Perry, his son-in-law. Our
arrival coincided with that of the late Trade Agent at Gyantse, and
his wife, who said that the winter had begun a month early this
year, as indeed we were to discover. They had with them a Lhassa
terrier puppy, which resembled a fluffy brown and white Pekinese.
After dinner, Mr Macdonald gave me elaborate instructions as to
Tibetan etiquette, the officials to be approached, the scarves and
presents to be distributed; and next morning, with the aid of a
lama, wrote us a number of letters of introduction, invoking my
friendship with Sir Charles Bell. He it was who, at the time of the
Dalai Lama's flight to India, dressed the commander-in-chief of the
Tibetan army up as a British mail-runner, and thus enabled him to
escape over the frontier unmolested by the Chinese troops that were
in pursuit.</p>

<p>G. and M., having gone to bed unnaturally early, woke and were
wandering about at eight o'clock; but being determined to make a
late start, refrained from dressing till half-past ten. They then
sat till midday keening over their last bath, last hot meal, last
knife and fork, last day on earth. Meanwhile I walked into the town
with Mr Macdonald, and purchased from a fat Tibetan woman with a
goitre a Tibetan hat of black felt, heavily embroidered with gold,
and possessing four fur flaps, those to protect the ears being
longer than the others. Of those of the superior type, which boast
a crown of hard silk adorned with a finial of red coral beads, I
could find none to fit. Mr Macdonald said that Kalimpong, as the
centre of the large Tibetan wool-trade, was a growing place;
whereas Darjeeling, being off the main route, owed its <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i> simply to Government House with its legislative
and social train. Formerly, Europeans were not allowed to live in
Kalimpong. Now, a special development area had been set apart for
them. The place is chiefly famous for its propagation of Himalayan
arts and crafts, which deluge Calcutta, during the winter season,
with nauseating 'fancy goods', and for its orphanages. A child from
one of these, born and educated in the Himalayas, eventually
obtained a job in Calcutta. When he reached Siliguri, seeing the
whole plain of India stretching away before him, he observed:
<i>'What</i> a football field!' Such is the beauty of British
education.</p>

<p>On our return to the hotel, Mr Perry handed me a tin box,
containing a wedding present for the eldest son of Rajah Tehring
and his newly married wife, a daughter of the former Tibetan
commander-in-chief whom Mr Macdonald had assisted over the
frontier. Rajah Tehring and his family lived, we were told, on an
estate about six miles away from Gyantse. Meanwhile the mules had
been loaded, and the ponies sent on ahead to a spot two or three
miles along the road, where we joined them in a motor. We mounted;
and I was ambling peacefully along in front, when M., looking like
a Victorian engraving of Lord Cardigan at the head of the Light
Brigade, flew past and disappeared round a corner. The path was
only a few feet wide; bottomless valleys yawned beneath it; and he
admitted that he had avoided riding for eleven years; but his pony
was costing five rupees a day, while ours were only four; so that
we concluded he was after his money's worth. After some time, he
had slowed down, when a small girl, bobbing up from under a
precipice, sent him off again. Then he dismounted, and G. took his
place, though not for long. He was lengthening the stirrup
leathers, when the animal suddenly leapt into the air, and he fell
off into the dust. The saddle-bags, which were really the cause of
the trouble, fell with him, disintegrating our lunch. Mercifully, a
pot of pickled beetroots escaped destruction. Another mile revealed
the pony taking its ease beneath a clump of bamboo. I mounted with
trepidation, but proceeded more quietly, as the saddle-bags had now
been transferred to a senile travesty of a quadruped whom nothing
could disturb.</p>

<p>The path took us from 5,000 feet to 7,000. The hill-sides were
largely cultivated. Scanty attempts at afforestation were apparent.
We lunched in a cloud, on a flat stone. The baked potatoes had
continued cooking against the pony's belly. After another two hours
downhill, a green slope appeared. My pony broke into a gallop and
brought me to a pink and white building, the rest-house of Pedong.
A babel of confusion followed, ponies unsaddling, mules unloading,
everyone calling for his possessions, the cook awaiting tea. The
store-boxes were opened, but nothing could be found. Eventually
whisky, tea, sugar, flour, milk, biscuits, tongue, French beans,
and cherries were set aside for the evening. Ah-Chung, the cook, a
diminutive pigtailed witch who had ministered to the first Everest
expedition, begged us to eat a chicken for dinner. He was carrying
several in a wicker basket. Knowing the consistency of the Indian
fowl, we thought it wiser to await a higher altitude, where the
corpse could keep and soften. It grew dark about five o'clock;
lamps were lit; and we slept or read till dinner. The sirdar
waited, assisted by a coolie who smelt. M. was now outwardly
cheerful.</p>

<p>Owing to misunderstandings, breakfast was not ready till a
quarter past nine. The whisky had no cork, and must be decanted
into a water-bottle; the pickled beetroots refused to resume their
lid; the camera had been packed in the bedding. From outside came
the clatter and shouts of loading. These trivial irritations seemed
strange at first. As the days passed, and our organization
improved, they grew less, becoming merely an unpleasant routine.
Below the rest-house lay a village, where a guard, uniformed in
dark green with a messenger-boy's cap, demanded our passes. Sikkim,
the only Buddhist state in India proper under British suzerainty,
does not allow Europeans within her confines without special
permission. Having seen we possessed it, the guard returned to dig
his garden, and we crossed the frontier.</p>

<p>Our day's objective was Ari, a point exactly opposite Pedong,
about four miles away on the wing, nine by earth. The broad cobbled
path led steeply downward. A train of 100 mules on their way from
Tibet to Kalimpong, each carrying packs of raw wool, interrupted
our progress. Trees with the stature of factory chimneys, rank,
weeping palms glistering like seaweed, broad-leaved shrubs, plump
lilies, stood about us. Overhead, the spiders wove, the parrots
called, and orchid tubers dropped serrated sheaves of browning
leaves. Land-crabs, encased in black tortoiseshell, edged their way
along the gutters. Streams fell down the hill, to rest for a moment
in stone drinking-troughs and then go on. From the shadows flitted
butterflies of every size and pattern: slowly flapping
swallow-tails of nocturnal emerald, lit with squares of iridescent
azure, elliptical wings of soft mouse-brown, spangled with a
crescent border of sky-blue; purple emperors, exotic and enormous,
flashing streaks of iris from their bouncing silhouettes; a shower
of hot golden yellow petals rising from a clot of dung; a huge
orange-tip sailing white and ruddy gold through the green depths; a
flag of red, white, and yellow netted in black veins; all floating
through the patches of sunlight, and then disappearing among the
sinister, indistinct shapes of the vegetation.</p>

<p>On reaching the bottom of the valley, being now very hot, we
bathed in the river, lying horizontally on the surface of the water
and clinging to successive boulders, till the current tore them up,
and we were swept down to others. Such was the speed of the water
that the impact of head and body created a waterfall in itself. A
thousand feet above, we came to the village of Rhenoke, where a
state visitors' book was presented for our signatures. The
resthouse at Ari was set in a garden of pebbled paths, surrounded
by rose-bushes and chrysanthemums in flower. Beneath, the valley
fell down, and rose again to disclose our resting-place of
yesterday. During dinner, <i>marwa,</i> the local drink, was
brought. It consisted of hot water, poured on a crush of millet,
which was contained in a segment of bamboo a foot high and three
inches wide, and sucked through a reed. The taste was indefinite,
and the alcoholic virtue remote.</p>

<p>Next morning, we descended into a valley as dank and rich as
yesterday's, and then followed a river upward. Stupendous,
overhanging faces of mountain stood about us; at every turn it
seemed as though there were no way but to attack them; yet still
the river wound on through some unforeseen cleft. The vegetation
increased. On the opposing hill the tops of the trees glittered in
the midday sun, while all the rest was black: bananas like torn
green flags; the tangled ribbons of the seaweed palm; huge ivy
shapes; starry bunches of magnolia leaves; and round us, as we
rode, the festoons of orchids and ferns, and a kind of creeper,
having itself a trunk, whence depended great herring-bones of green
oil-cloth leaves. The river was now below us, a foaming thread
cleaving this inverted arboretum. Above, the sky was reduced to a
mere triangle, whence fringes of cloud came encroaching on the rim
of our prison. Then suddenly the bottom of the hills widened into a
valley, where there was a village and a number of monks were
chanting in the upper room of a house. The river was with us again,
and had lately engulfed the road. Slithering down the aftermath of
an avalanche, we crossed it on two tree-trunks, while the animals
with some difficulty stood up against the current. Then began the
ascent we had been expecting, a series of hairpin twists on a
perpendicular face. After two hours of sliding and panting, we came
to Sedonchen, as the clouds settled down for the night. Below the
rest-house, through increasing mist, appeared the broad-eaved roofs
of low houses, the villagers trailing about their affairs, sheep
huddled in a tiny square, whence white prayer-flags fluttered sadly
from their masts, and a wool-train arriving to be unloaded for the
night. Beyond there was nothing. The whole scene was perched in
space. Gradually the edges of the farther houses were swallowed up.
The night increased. A perceptible cold made us shiver. We had tea,
and then dinner. The latter consisted of Ah-Chung's chicken,
potatoes, onions and carrots, 'cling' peaches, and a sardine
savoury.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-4"></a>IV. INTO TIBET</h3>

<p>The morning of Friday, 5 October, disclosed a view such as only
the Himalayas can offer, range after range, peak after peak,
filling the distance, with Kanchenjunga, on the right, making
tentative bows from its place in the sky through the floating
clouds. Below, the hill up which we had climbed was too steep to be
visible. But the village was there, which seemed slightly
surprising, after its disappearance the night before. The
wool-trains were setting out, the fluffy, hide-bound packs being
loaded, and the animals defiling one after another down the path
and out of sight. During the morning, we met others, varying from
thirty to a hundred mules, usually on some precipitous turn of the
narrowing path, which obliged us to stand patiently and wait till
they were past. The leaders wore collars of heavy bells, and were
decorated with scarlet yaks' tails. Many had little head-pieces,
shaped like those that elephants wear, and embroidered with
cabalistic designs in bright colours. The men in attendance wore
either the usual Tibetan robe of dark maroon serge, loosely caught
at the hip, or else a species of plus-four made of the same local
stuff. On their feet were high felt boots with canoe-shaped toes,
appliqued in red and green over the instep, and tied round the
back, where they were slit, with brigand's garters. The effect was
frequently completed by a Homburg hat several sizes too small which
was affixed to the top of the head by means of the pigtail.</p>

<p>The ledge to which Sedonchen clings lies 6,500 feet above
sea-level. Above, the path zig-zagged inexorably up a continuous
perpendicular face, the cobbles becoming rougher, and the
precipices, falling sheer from the narrowing footway, more
unnerving, though their full menace was lost in a sea of grey
cloud, whence came the noise of cadent, invisible waters. The
luxuriant vegetation, which the last two or three days had made
familiar, disappeared. Silver firs stood up, strangely ornamental.
Other conifers, jagged and torn with age and wind, rose gaunt from
the mist. Below them, walling the path to a height of twelve feet,
grew woods of rhododendrons, their leaves, in star-shaped bunches,
varying in length from two inches to ten, and coloured with a
bluish grey unknown to the English varieties. The textural effect
of the fine leaves against the broad, the innumerable permutations
of a daisy pattern, broken by thin-elbowed branches, angular as
strung bones, was one of great beauty, recalling the minutiae of
Chinese ivories, save for the impalpable colouring and the wraiths
of mist. Suddenly, out of a cloud, a solitary Tibetan emerged,
dressed in a padded, full-sleeved robe of weathered red, which
reached to the knees and gave an illusion of pregnancy, since the
stomach, where it was caught across from shoulder to opposite hip,
was used as a pocket. On his head he wore a tall conically crowned
hat, with its brim, broad and scalloped, turned up in front. His
face was parchment coloured, the eyes narrow, and the lips and
cheeks very red, a typical Tibetan characteristic, giving the
appearance of a sinister waxen doll. On his back he carried a
frying-pan. From his waist hung a silver-sheathed knife in the
place of a bayonet.</p>

<p>The ponies, panting and steaming, seemed on the verge of
collapse, when the trees and rhododendrons gave place to a gloomy
silhouette of huts through the darkening fog. Being in advance, I
practised a Tibetan sentence upon two women and a baby, who said it
was four miles on to Gnatong. The road now ceased to climb and
branched off to the left; we had risen 5,000 feet in four miles,
the latter being marked by mile-posts. Our other companion was the
single telegraph wire to Lhassa, attached to trees or posts as
convenience demanded, and during the stage we had just completed,
carried vertically up the mountain-side with tantalizing
directness, while we wound from side to side of it. Soon after the
village we passed the tree-limit, and at half-past twelve came to
Gnatong, 12,000 feet up. Having been unable to sleep the previous
night, I had lit a candle and read a book by Edgar Wallace. This
work, though forming part of a sixpenny edition, was encased in a
lavish gilded binding, and was prefaced by an announcement that the
editors of the series were anxious to place within reach of the
proletariat not only the classics, but an ornament to the home. In
commercial compensation, the paper used resembled an antique
blotter, and the type was barely distinguishable. As a result, I
had developed a headache, which was now considerably increased by
the height.</p>

<p>Gnatong lies in a cup of peaks, a place of about twenty houses,
which include a telegraph and post-office. At the rest-house,
recently constructed, we ate our lunch and warmed ourselves by a
fire, paying a fee of eight annas each for the privilege.
Afterwards we sent a telegram to Yatung, announcing our arrival on
the morrow: a premature precaution. I posted some letters in time
to catch the downward mail, which had crossed the Jelep La that
morning, and which we later met, four runners of nondescript
appearance.</p>

<p>It was now five miles to Kapup. The scene was almost Scottish in
its colouring; yet the colours were richer and more precise. Across
the hillsides, whose tops reached into the clouds and were lost,
lay great expanses of dank yellow grass and the dank yellow leaves
of dead flags, scattered with black boulders, and interspersed with
tiny rustling streams. From this yellow sprouted clumps of a short
star-leaved plant, of a lucid pinkish red. In addition, the slopes
were covered with patches of dwarf rhododendron, small-leaved, and
growing to the height of gorse. So that, as a whole, the receding
hills alternated between dank yellow starred with autumn red and a
rich, inimitable blue-grey green, a frightening, melancholy colour,
merging into the acrid purplish blue of farther valleys darkened by
hibernating clouds; while here and there escarpments of
square-jutting rock, black and grey, increased the gloom and
inhospitality of the scene. A vulture flapped from a knoll to join
its fellows, crouching lumps of feathers, with their naked heads
and necks moving in and out like those of comic dolls. As we
ascended farther, my headache reduced me to the borders of
insanity, and my pony had to be led. The turn of a corner disclosed
a lake, a smoky, forbidding sheet of water, long in shape, and
lying a thousand feet below us. Far away, a pink speck proclaimed
the roof of the Kapup rest-house. Above it, towering into the sky,
a yellow tendril threaded its way up the purple silhouette of
mountain&mdash;the road over the Jelep La into Tibet.</p>

<p>The rest-house, down to which I staggered in a condition of
gibbering sightlessness, had two rooms only, in which fires were
already blazing. Ah-Chung, who had gone ahead, had fever; but
managed, none the less, to cook our dinner of steak and kidney and
plum puddings. I went to bed, to listen to the hammers on my skull;
but ate, and felt better for it. In the next room G. and M., elated
with rum, turned their thoughts and conversation to London, but not
their charity. So presumably people think and talk when marooned on
that disappearing phenomenon, the desert island.</p>

<p>As we ate dinner it began to rain. Every drop, echoed and
magnified by the corrugated-iron roof, filled us with a mounting
apprehension. At half-past eight I went to sleep, and consequently
woke at three. Despite an aluminium hot-water bottle dressed in a
small pink vest, five blankets, and a great-coat of that
nineteenth-century consistency which can, and had, come through
forty years unblemished, I was cold. It was 13,000 feet, I said, as
I twisted from side to side and ground myself into the coverings.
But the cold came up through the mattress, which was thin. The
noise of the rain was like rifle-fire. The wind howled. When day
broke, the surrounding peaks and the pass over which we had to
travel were obscured by falling snow. We lay in bed irresolute,
till the sirdar came in to say that both cook and sweeper had
fever, and that in any case it was impossible to start. That this
was not so we knew. But we agreed with him.</p>

<p>After a breakfast of sausages, potatoes, tomatoes, poached eggs,
scones, and coffee, we settled down in front of the fires. The
single book-shelf was furnished with several copies of the <i>Revue
des Deux Mondes.</i> M. read <i>Wolf Solent,</i> a soil-reeking
novel by J. C. Powys, which he said harmonized exactly with our
present surroundings. G. lay on the floor, his now perceptible
beard protruding from the rim of a yet more ponderous tome, <i>The
Mind and Face of Bolshevism.</i></p>

<p>Lunch was welcome, as it is on rainy days. In the afternoon,
impelled by the gloom and a temporary cessation of the rain, G. and
I walked up the village street, which consisted of two shacks and a
seat. The rain then began again. Having collected some rhododendron
seeds, and had a glimpse of the lake, we returned.</p>

<p>That night the stars showed, and the morning brought a cloudless
sky. The snow-spattered hills glittered in the sun. Leaving before
the others, I urged my pony towards the pass. The slope was
gradual, and the ground dotted with large trumpet-like gentians of
indescribable blue. A bird, inky blue, with a rusty tail and a
white spot on its head, hopped from a boulder. Wagtails, half
white, fluttered about. Then I was in the snow, two or three inches
of it. Till suddenly two cairns appeared, one on either side of the
path. Dismounting, I looked down, and across, to Tibet.</p>

<p>The scene, as became the moment, was spectacular, revealing
terrestrial conformation on a scale that the eye had never
witnessed and the imagination never dreamed of. Vanished for ever
was the prussian-blue of Anglo-Himalaya and the Alps, that
immanent, formless tint which oppresses half the mountains of the
world. A new light was in the air, a liquid radiance, presage of
scenes with which the whole earth offers no comparison. Here was no
gradual transition, no uneventful frontier, but translation, in a
single glance, from the world we know to a world that I did not
know. It was only a glimpse. Not for three days, till we were out
of the Chumbi valley, was the reality upon us. But I knew, as I
looked, that here was a land where natural coloration, as we
understand it, does not apply, a land whose effulgence affirms
intent more positive and less explicable than the fortuitous
convenience of warmth and light..</p>

<p>From my feet the mountain fell away, sheer down, till the path
hid itself underneath, and only reappeared a thousand feet below by
the side of a lake, a cold tarn, dark green like a slab of inlaid
ice. This was contained on a precarious landing, whence the
mountains rose in a circle, falling back to the dorsal ridge on
whose lowest point I now stood. The lower slopes supported
scattered regiments of dark green firs. Beyond the lake a valley
formed, falling down, down, down into a haze of wooded declivities,
until, forty miles away, a new range stood up, a heathery buff
colour of chocolate bloom, with every valley black, and every spur
agleam, in the radiant morning sun. The eye moved upward, to come
to rest, far above its own level of 14,300 feet, on a wavy line of
snow, a glittering girdle to the blue sky, whence two sparkling
white peaks, the grandiose Chomolhari and another, thrust their
heads above a puff of cloud into the firmament. On either side the
clouds were gathering; I was barely in time; within ten minutes the
peaks were gone. Then, as I still looked, a line of men came
crawling up the mountain-side beneath my feet, so diminutive, so
absolutely small against the surrounding heights and distances,
that my pony and I, silhouetted on the summit with India at our
backs, seemed of colossal stature. Their approach disclosed a party
of Bhutanese coolies, bearing heavy loads, and hung with curious
household utensils. The majority wore dark glasses, and one a
finely woven straw hat shaped like the lid of a dirty
clothes-basket. The party immediately climbed on to the larger of
the two cairns, where they remained busy for some minutes
rearranging the large branch that stood from its midst. This was
hung with prayer-flags, tattered pennants of various colours, to
which the coolies were adding their own, taking care to ensure
their being well placed. Then they went off, and I was left alone
to gaze.</p>

<p>After an hour the others arrived, and behind them some of the
servants, also furnished with appropriate prayer-flags. During the
first part of the descent it was impossible to ride. We could only
slither down the snow, and then the mud, till we came to the lake
and the trees began. Yet we were afterwards informed that the two
elephants in the Dalai Lama's zoo at Lhassa had crossed this way.
The milestones were no more; and the path, even now that the valley
proper offered a more rational foothold, was more obstacle than
assistance, as though some giant in his course had been playing
football with the boulders. We passed occasional villages, small
hutments in the forest, their broad-eaved wooden roofs held down by
stones, and adjoined by large open stables. A river accompanied us;
yaks, black and silky as though caparisoned in Victorian
hearth-rugs, grazed by its side. On the slopes around us the autumn
colouring attained an incomparable richness and variety. Flowing
golden larches; duller yellow maples; shumack of flaming red;
innumerable blue-grey rhododendron bushes, the smaller bearing
occasional orange flowers; huge silver firs, their tops broken with
age and storm, which gave place, as we continued, to pines with
brushes of bright green needles; flowering shrubs of many kinds,
tenuous and spiky; and clumps of Michaelmas daisies to remind us of
the same season in England; all stood about us, as we walked, rode,
or slithered, crossing and recrossing the river by delicately
engineered wooden bridges.</p>

<p>There accompanied our party a youth on a grey pony, whose frisky
paces, unhindered by stones or mud, were our envy. Summoning my few
words, I engaged him in conversation. Was he Tibetan? No,
Bhutanese. Where was he going? To Rinchengong, round the
corner&mdash;the corner indicated being a mountain-slope the size
of Skiddaw. Wasn't there a monastery there? Yes, and he was going
to be a monk. What was his name? Damb&uuml;. Thereafter, words
failed me.</p>

<p>I was ahead, and having rounded the intervening mountain, had
caught sight of the roofs of Rinchengong, when a noise of drums
proclaimed some event. Turning a corner, I was confronted by a
religious procession.</p>

<p>It produced a curious feeling, almost fear, this first contact
with persons, clothes, and observances of utter strangeness. For
many years I had thought about Tibet, read about it, and gazed
longingly at photographs of its huge landscape and fantastic
uniforms. None the less, the reality came as a shock.</p>

<p>The valley had widened a little. In front, and all round, the
hills rose up, covered with dank yellow grass and the bright green
pines. In the middle distance appeared the roofs of Rinchengong,
approached by a few patches of cultivation. Between these, hemmed
by two tumbledown stone walls, came a troupe of about forty women
and children. The latter waved and laughed; the former carried on
their backs long boxes containing the sacred books. They were
dressed, as the majority of Tibetans are, in a coarse serge of
mauvish purple. Their black hair was done in the manner of Nurse
Cavell's. The faces were well filled, the mouths often sensual. The
skin was ivory; but the cheeks and lips, like those of the man we
met among the rhododendrons, were brilliant apple-red. This painted
effect is the distinguishing characteristic of the Tibetan
appearance, and at first seemed strangely unnatural.</p>

<p>In the midst of the women and children walked numerous monks,
shaven-headed, and swathed in the manner peculiar to Buddhist
monks, in thick red serge; some striking thin, slightly
barrel-shaped drums; one beating a large cymbal. Occasionally they
wore hats, astounding shapes, high-pointed cones of red, or
Phrygian caps of the same colour. This was evidently the red-hat
sect. At the head of the procession moved a benign grey-headed
figure, who smiled as I dismounted, but in reality told our
servants to take us round another way. In the rear, borne in a
palanquin, came a golden image preceded by a scowling fat monk. One
might have been the Virgin, and the other a priest, in an Italian
village.</p>

<p>Rinchengong lay on both sides of a new and larger river, which
was crossed by a wooden bridge supported on two horizontal piles of
huge beams, each layer protruding farther from the bank than that
below it, so that the topmost ones almost met beneath the middle of
the footway. The houses were of two and three storeys, tall and
solid, with heavy square windows paned in glass (twenty years ago
there was only paper) and set in richly carved and coloured wooden
frames. The ground floors, entered by massive double doors, were
used as stables; the upper, beneath the roof, were open and stored
forage. In the centre of the town rose a magnificent
<i>chorten,</i> an onion-like erection rising from a square base
and supporting a spike of brass that glittered in the sun like
gold. This was surrounded, as is usual, by a plantation of peeled
masts, twenty feet high, down each of which a single narrow flag,
printed with the prayer <i>Om Mani Padme Hum,</i> was tacked to
within six feet of the ground. Nearby stood a rectangular edifice,
like a large stone chest, about twenty feet long, eight high, and
five broad, through an arcade in which could be seen a row of
prayer-wheels, revolving reels a foot high. Along the outside,
innumerable little painted plaques bore the faded image of Buddha.
These <i>chortens</i> and <i>mendongs</i> are to be found in all
the Tibetan villages, and sometimes standing by themselves on
frequented paths. As we passed out of Rinchengong we observed an
old man, with two wisps of white moustache depending from the outer
corners of his mouth, seated on his doorstep slowly turning a brass
prayer-wheel, which revolved, as he waved its handle, by means of a
small weight on the end of a chain.</p>

<p>The way continued along the banks of the new river, the Chumbi,
a broad, tearing volume of water flecked by little waves.
Cultivated fields stretched from hill to hill. There were even
patches of flat grass, on which my pony alone could be induced to
gallop. In the villages, each with <i>chorten,</i> prayer-masts,
and <i>mendong,</i> the inhabitants gazed fixedly at us, their
ruddy faces sometimes breaking into smiles, sometimes not. The
telegraph wire was still with us. We lunched by the river-side. The
scene, for the moment, might have been in Canada. At three o'clock,
after travelling eighteen miles and descending to 10,000 feet above
sea-level, we came to Yatung, a large place with a main street
flanked by prayer-masts, and overlooked by the bungalow and Union
Jack of the British Trade Agent, and the tin barracks, complete
with <i>pissoir</i> and football field, of his twenty-five Indian
soldiers. The rest-house lay opposite, across the river, set in a
paled garden of hollyhocks and Japanese anemones. Its interior
disclosed unexpected luxury: brocade curtains, padded arm-chairs,
reproductions of Gainsborough, Romney, and Franz Hals, an original
and somewhat unfortunate still life, numerous books and more copies
of the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes,</i> evidently the former property
of a political officer. Over the mantelpiece hung a coloured
portrait of the Prince of Wales, clad in the golfing fashions of
1924, and holding a cairn terrier.</p>

<p>The following morning brought a steady downpour of rain. Being
rather tired, we did not start till late. Two or three miles out we
encountered an official of the local post-office, who said that
beyond Gautsa, our day's objective, snow was falling.</p>

<p>'Gyantse you're going to, are you?' he continued. 'My God, your
faces will be in a state.'</p>

<p>'We've got cold cream and vaseline.'</p>

<p>'They're no good. If you do use them, rub 'em off before you go
into the sun...Well&mdash;good luck! I don't envy you. Cheero!' And
we parted.</p>

<p>The rain was falling steadily. There was a darkness in the air.
Above the path, on the right, stood a line of ruins, the old
Chinese barracks which fell into desuetude after the recall of the
imperial troops in 1911. We passed along a soggy plain, the bottom
of an elliptical cup of hills, in which the river broadened into a
placid stream and yaks were nibbling at the sedges. A bridge
crossed the river and a path led up to a monastery on a ledge in
the opposite hills, a new building restored out of all
picturesqueness. It was here that Lord Zetland and Mr Laden-La
consulted the oracle as to the fate of the war; to which, after
exhibiting a series of spasms, he gave a Delphic answer of no great
perspicacity. We had hoped for his advice ourselves with regard to
certain domestic problems; but had learnt, before starting, that he
had lately been seduced by a woman in a wood and consequently
relieved of his duties.</p>

<p>Beyond the plain the valley narrowed into a forbidding gorge.
Now we were level with the river; now 300 feet above it; now it was
bounding and foaming above us. Gigantic peaks, inclining from our
very footfalls, towered into the remaining sky. The path was steep,
a series of rocky steps, interspersed with pools of mud. The
raindrops trickled slowly down the long red hips and haws of
Chinese roses. We fell into a trance of gloom, as the wet
percolated down our necks and up our sleeves. Time had ceased. The
ponies picked their way of their own accord. At length, almost
unknowing, we arrived at Gautsa, a scattering of wooden huts, which
seemed as though half sunk into the ground for fear of the sombre
ramparts about them.</p>

<p>That afternoon, before the light went, it began to snow here
also. It continued during the night and the following dawn. When we
awoke there were six inches on the ground, and half as much on
every branch and boulder. It was impossible, the sirdar said, to
start. That might be; but this time we were not to be daunted. G.
and I were muffled in our carpet suits, helmets, mackintoshes, and
fingerless gloves; M. had brought his winter-sports clothes and
looked like an illustration in the <i>Tatler,</i> save that the
smile was lacking. The path was invisible; we were advised to leave
its discovery to a mule; and Ah-Chung, enveloped in a mackintosh
with a frilled hood, set off ahead like some cardinal on his way to
a session of the Inquisition. In view of its superior strength, my
pony had been loaded anew with the saddle-bags. Alarmed at the
rattle of tins and bottles, he set off at an angry pace, heedless
of the snow's foundations, and lurching and slipping, passed the
mule-train. As we rose to 13,000 feet, the snow deepened to a foot,
and the trees gave place to bushes. The path, high above the river,
became a ledge. A frightful desolation hung in the air, as the
snowflakes floated persistently from the bilious leaden sky, down
from above, past, and down again, to the river miles below, which
had become a trickling black ribbon in a world of white, enclosed
by stupendous white escarpments that allowed it no banks and rose
sheer from either edge of the water. Only the water's distant rush
and trickle broke the tingling silence. Should we get through?
should we get through? The question became an obsession. We were
mounting. Would not the snow be deeper at the top, once out on the
Phari plain? To be baulked, to turn back in face of all our
preparations, to have stood on the threshold and been barred, to
admit that an inch or two of snow had got the better of
us&mdash;these threats drummed my mind. Not a footfall had we seen;
we were entering the unknown; the plains might be full of huge
drifts in which we could move neither back nor fore and should only
freeze to death; and the servants were plainly apprehensive.
Suffering was tolerable. But not failure, even though it entailed a
hero's death.</p>

<p>The path was now scarcely more than a yard wide. Beneath it, the
precipice to the river was increasing in depth, and the pony was
picking its way more gingerly, when suddenly the whole ledge was
blocked by an avalanche of snow that had left a dirty track on the
white slope above. Thankful for my high Cretan boots, which I had
brought from their native island as a mere curiosity, I set about
to trample down the snow, which was soft and, as it stood, came to
the height of my chest. The pony, following at reins' length,
decided to make a rush for it, and in doing so let its hindquarters
fall over the edge. I pulled it back till it was firmly embedded in
the drift, and continued my trampling. This was not easy, owing to
lack of breath and superfluity of clothes. Eventually I made my way
over, piling up a rampart on the outer side, to prevent further
alarms. Immediately in front lay another similar obstacle, rather
larger, into which I delved spasmodically, while the pony stood
alone, looking slightly supercilious. After half an hour the train
came in sight, like a string of black insects crawling slowly up
the white slope. At the first drift Ah-Chung dismounted and led his
mule. The next fell heavily and had to be relieved of its boxes.
However, the grooms and muleteers, having come thus far, displayed
an admirable determination; and after much digging and stamping,
both obstacles were negotiated.</p>

<p>A little farther on, where the bottom of the valley had rejoined
the path, we reached a solitary hut, outside which a mail-runner
was waiting. The downward post from Phari had not arrived. Our
hearts sank. We decided to wait a little, while the men drank tea
out of tin mugs, and we did likewise. Ten minutes later the four
postmen appeared, and after them a large wool-train. Both said
that, once out on the plain, the snow grew less. We set off again,
this time with a definite track to follow.</p>

<p>At length the valley widened, the snow ceased falling, and the
mountain-sides fell back at a more gentle incline, till we were
riding over an upward-sloping plateau. Over its brow came two men
mounted on yaks, and leading another packed with their belongings,
uncouth silhouettes as they plunged through the snow, the riders
flinging the single rope attached to the nostril from one horn to
the other. We met at a bog, whose presence was discovered by the
sudden disappearance of the mule bearing G. and M.'s luggage. Its
head remained visible, and it was rescued. But the suitcases were
immersed. The sun began to shine in a vague way, but not vague
enough to prevent, after an hour or two, a strange burning feeling
in the nose and the sirdar's going snow blind. But for Ah-Chung,
our servants seemed to have come ill-provided for the trials they
must have foreseen. Half of them had no glasses. That morning one
of the grooms had been left behind owing to his having neither
boots nor shoes. He did not catch us up till the evening before we
reached Gyantse. And on the journey down, when conditions were
worse, I was forced to distribute my own shoes and stockings to
others.</p>

<p>We reached the plateau proper, and knew that we had reached
Tibet. The snow, save on the surrounding hills, gave place to bare
earth and stones. A great herd of yaks was grazing&mdash;calves,
cows, and bulls, their deep shaggy black unrelieved save by an
occasional streak of white up their bushy tails. Beyond them rose
the huge twisted cone of Chomolhari, 24,000 feet high, whence
jagged cubes and triangles of overhanging rock where the snow could
obtain no hold, protruded nakedly. The earth around us was pitted
with small holes, dwellings of the marmot, a peculiar animal
between a rabbit and a rat, which sat on its hind-legs, whiskers
a-quiver, till our actual approach, then disappeared over its
threshold.</p>

<p>At last, beyond a stretch of cultivation, Phari Jong, or Castle,
stood up, an impressive mass misty grey in the afternoon light, its
perpendicular lines slightly convergent and gathering to a squat
central tower-storey. A few wisps of smoke proclaimed the town. The
castle seemed nearer than it was, as things do in Tibet; my pony
had gone lame; and it was another hour before we reached the
rest-house compound. This contained also a post-office. The postal
service from Gyantse to Phari is bi-weekly, and accomplished by
mule; between Phari and India it is daily and on foot. The service
is maintained by the Indian Government at a cost of between
&pound;5,000 and &pound;6,000 a year. The receipts we did not
discover. It is much appreciated by the Tibetans, whose own
arrangements between Lhassa, though daily, are not so certain. Rich
inhabitants of the capital and of Shigatse frequently send their
letters and parcels to the Gyantse post-office by private
messenger. Their volume is increasing, since communication with
China, whence Tibetans draw most of their amenities, is become more
and more precarious overland, and the route by Calcutta and the sea
is preferred.</p>

<p>Despite our exhaustion, both physical and mental, we hastened to
despatch the letters of recommendation with which Messrs Macdonald
and Laden-La had provided us, to the Jong, accompanied by the
requisite scarf. Each Jong is the seat of two Jongpens,
administrative officials with magisterial powers over certain
districts, who are supposed to act as a check on one another. The
occupants of the Phari office, probably young officials beginning
their careers in Lhassa, were absentees, as often happens, and
their powers were delegated to two representatives. In about half
an hour these arrived in person, one cadaverous and tall, the other
plump and short, both lacking numerous teeth, and wearing the
single ear-ring, four inches long, of turquoise drops jointed in
gold, which is the mark of all persons of substance. Their robes
were of the usual purplish cloth. On their heads they wore ordinary
black-and-gold caps, with the fur flaps turned up windmill-fashion,
and underneath long pigtails. We were told later that they were
very poor. We presumed them to be the victims of grievance or
neglect, since they opened the conversation by suggesting that we
should take a letter for them to the Dalai Lama, the reason being
that all correspondence arriving by the ordinary channels is
carefully scrutinized by secretaries before being presented to His
Holiness. We could only regret that we should have no opportunity
of delivering it.</p>

<p>The following morning I awoke in a condition of physical misery
such as I have never experienced before or since. Phari, 14,300
feet above sea-level, is possibly the highest town in the world. My
head, yesterday quiescent, had begun to drum and throb as though an
hydraulic machine were pumping all the blood in my body into it.
The cold was bitter. In addition, my whole face was a suppurating
jelly of yellow liquid, which nothing could stanch, and which
dripped through my beard over the sheets and on to my clothes, as I
fitted my body into them with palsied movements. Though it was only
six o'clock, and barely light, the sirdar suddenly announced that
the castellans had arrived again. Mopping my face with a
handkerchief, I emerged into the sitting-room, to find the naked
corpse of a sheep lying on the table, accompanied by a number of
eggs. We pressed them to tea, and then raw whisky, which they
sipped with as much distaste as we ourselves. They accepted, as
return presents, tins of ginger-nuts, smoked salmon, sardines, and
chocolate. As my pony had not recovered, they promised to find
another.</p>

<p>We were anxious to visit the Jong itself, and encountering the
taller castellan on a dung-heap an hour later, I framed the request
in Tibetan. An emissary was appointed to lead us. The town was
unprepossessing, as all travellers have found it. The houses,
constructed, save for a few solid buildings on the outskirts, of
turfs, were scarcely above the level of the ground; so that columns
of smoke came wreathing out of holes in what seemed to be mere
platforms of earth, about the height of the shoulder. Stacks of
yak-dung, in round kneaded pats, lay everywhere; for we were out of
the wood area, and had had to pay heavily for our fires at the
rest-house. The streets, seven feet wide, were runnels of filth,
and strewn with bones and pieces of bloody hide. Enormous ravens,
croaking and disgusting, crouched on the house-tops or flapped a
few feet above our heads, as though in appetite for ourselves.
Stocky black mastiffs, fortunately tethered, barked at our
approach. Yaks, ponies, and mules were tied by the hind-leg in open
stables.</p>

<p>The Jong, which was shelled by the British in 1904 and has since
been repaired, proved considerably smaller and less substantial
than its excellent lines had seemed to warrant. Ascending by a
flight of steps, we were ushered through a doorway four feet high
into a low room, whose ceiling was supported by a wooden
crutch-pillar in the middle. Though it was not distinguishably
clean, there was no smell and the windows were open. One of the
castellan's wives, assisted by numerous servants, gave us tea from
a blue enamel kettle in glasses marked MADE IN JAPAN. This, though
boiled with milk and sugar, was 'English' and cheered our spirits.
Should we be passing this way again? We must come and see them. She
was a pretty woman in a somewhat solid way, and her complexion
clean and fair, with the usual blush on the cheeks. After twenty
minutes we took farewell, mounted our ponies, and set off over the
plains.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-5"></a>V. THE PLAINS</h3>

<p>This account must now enter upon that stage familiar to all
readers of Tibetan travel-books, in which the desolation of the
country overwhelms all other impressions. While the eye is dazzled
with colour and form of such intensity and glitter, and on such a
scale, that it seems as though our drab and commonplace planet had
been exchanged for the moon or some other heavenly body, an
unwilling, clandestine fear lurks in the shadows of the stranger's
being, as though he were threatened with gradual but total
extinction, with that cessation of being or becoming which Buddhism
teaches to be the goal of man and his perfecting. Readers of
Tibetan travel-books may find little excitement in our short
journey, carried out under conditions of comparative comfort over
one of the most frequented highways and one of the most
comparatively hospitable parts of the whole Tibetan plateau, a
journey accomplished by British officers several times a year as
part of their normal routine. What is this beside the laborious and
dangerous incursions from the north and east, where the altitude
and savagery of the country surpass anything on earth, of Huc,
Prjevalsky, and Pereira? None the less the slow ride of 150 miles
over the frontier reveals enough of Tibet and of the character of
the landscape to invest with reality the monotonous, agonized
records of those more adventurous explorers, whose words fail them
to paint the horror and beauty of their journeys. Tibet, for us
now, is no longer the 'land of mystery', a piece of dark brown on
physical maps, gripped by an unholy hierarchy, and possessing no
amenities of life beyond devil-dances and butter statues; but a
physical, aesthetic, and human definition as implied by the words
France or Germany. Henceforth it exists on the map of our
intelligence as well as of our atlas. If, say the newspapers, this
or that is happening in Tibet, this or that means something. In
Terra del Fuego it does not. This or that, moreover, is invested
with a particular romance. We see again the parched distances, the
damson hills and gilded rocks, the encroaching snows, the yaks
ploughing the pale dusty earth of the valleys, the threshers
singing on the outskirts of the four-square farm-houses, the laughs
of the passers-by, the burning turquoise sky, and the pop-eyed
clouds. We have a part in the country. We wish it well.</p>

<p>From Phari the way led over three or four miles of plain,
through the street of a village, and then sloped gradually up to
the Tang-La, an imperceptible pass 15,300 feet in height, and the
summit of our journey. As we rose, patches of snow reappeared;
while the enclosing hills were covered with white down to their
junction with the flat. On the right, Chomolhari, grown enormous,
towered over us, rising, as it seemed in the clear air, from only a
few hundred yards away, a massive cone whose jutting, naked peak,
wrenched round the wrong way, threatened to crash from the clouds
9,000 feet above upon our heads. Beyond it, as we descended from
the pass and inclined towards the north-east, a subsidiary range,
jagged outline of unbroken white, stretched away to the north, its
depressions filled with swollen, shining clouds. There are no
clouds like these clouds. Shaped like those of Chinese landscapes,
the dancing light, the very essence of tight, neither silver nor
gold, but <i>light,</i> fills their underneaths and middles with
sharp, three-dimensional shadows, so that their protuberant white
bodies assume a reality that could be tossed and caught, if only
reached. A pink pervades them: complement of the sky, the
oppressing ultramarine sky, dark as the interstices of waves, near
as the speckled visions beneath the eyelids&mdash;a pink which is
on the snow as well, and on all the land, an emphatic tint of
unearthly propinquity. In the foreground, reflecting these marvels,
ran a small river, broken by diminutive islets and crossed by a
humped bridge. Beyond, the ground rose in a kind of terrace at
whose top stood a Tibetan rest-house. Through the double doors of
the outer wall appeared a square compound of stables and a house,
where our men stopped to drink tea. The lame pony stopped also, and
I had to go back for it.</p>

<p>An interminable flat, ten miles long, now confronted us, across
which the metal telegraph-posts expanded into a single dotted line.
These were not so incongruous as they sound; for Huc recorded lines
of black poles traversing similar plains for the guidance of
travellers. Over to the right, towards the roots of Chomolhari, a
donkey lay recumbent while a woman beat it, and its foal ran this
way and that in perplexity. On the opposite horizon, where low
hills began again, a strange glacial formation, the top of some
stupendous range, flashed like a sheaf of crystals in the blue. As
our eyes strained ahead in pursuit of the posts, till the hills
circled in, we could distinguish Tuna, a scatter of black
rectangles, whose details became clearer as the hours went by. The
tedium of our progress seemed insupportable. I yearned for my
life's terror, a horse that would run away. Mounted on a species of
small dog, having the appearance of an autumn chrysanthemum and the
shoulders of an eel, over which my saddle and myself were
continually falling on to its neck, I jolted along, sometimes
inducing a series of rapid stumbles by dint of simultaneously
lashing one rein about the head and the other about the tail. G.
and M., though higher off the ground, were in no better plight. By
a disastrous oversight we had brought neither whip nor switch. For
four days on end not a bush nor a twig did we see; and after Samoda
there was only a prickly scrub, which tore the hands and broke at
the first blow. The duration of our stages was made half as long
again, and the tedium correspondingly increased, by this
circumstance.</p>

<p>Tuna, where the Younghusband expedition lay encamped for a whole
winter, is 14,700 feet above sea-level, and commands a square view
of the entire Chomolhari range. As the sun set, shadows of a
frigid, incalculable blue gave new form to the great extended mass
and its dominating peak. Seated on a chair in three greatcoats, I
sought to sketch it; but a steely, icy wind drove me in. By the
light of a lamp I continued, till my head began to ache. During the
night my whole skull seemed to be splitting into sections like the
pigs of an orange, among which I took a new shape as the Governor
of Bengal attending a garden-party under compulsion, and dressed in
a mackintosh designed by Bert Thomas, whose drawings in
<i>Punch</i> I had been looking at.</p>

<p>The morning, which came at last, was the crisis of the
expedition. My own face, for which I had constructed a mask out of
two handkerchiefs, had ceased to drip, and was now covered with
yellow scabs, which adhered unpleasantly to the surface of the
beard. But those of M. and G. had liquefied in the night, and they
arrived in my room to breakfast, speechless with despondency. The
cold was intense; the room was filled with the odour of yak-dung
and lamp-smoke; my head was pounding; and I had whispered to
myself, during the despair of dressing, that if&mdash;if either of
the others were to suggest an about-turn, I should not oppose him.
To endure this pain for three more weeks would be merely the
weak-mindedness of the strong.</p>

<p>M., his face dripping, unshaven, and crinkling with nausea as it
opened to receive a piece of tinned sausage, spoke the first
reproach that I had ever known of him: <i>'Why</i> have you brought
us to this horrible place?'&mdash;as though it were any more my
doing than his. Whereat G., employing the dogmatic tone of an Early
Father, announced: 'I am going straight back to Phari.' It was that
tone that saved us. 'You can,' I said resentfully, though ten
seconds before I would have followed him. 'I'm going on. Anyhow I
rather want to see Lake Dochen.' I had no such desire; but as we
should reach it that morning, it seemed the nearest incentive.
'Well?' we both inquired at once of M. 'I'm so wretched,' he
replied, mopping his face and pushing away the sausage, 'that I'm
indifferent. But I don't like not keeping to my plans.' 'Grotesque
weak-mindedness!' snarled G.; and to me: 'If you want to see Lake
Dochen, GO and see Lake Dochen.' Thereafter no more was spoken.
Outside the window the noise of the loading mules went on; then
stopped. They had gone. The sirdar cleared away the breakfast;
Ah-Chung was on his mule. We put on our scarves, gloves, and
helmets and, mounting, continued northward.</p>

<p>We now left the Tuna plain, and, turning a corner of mountain,
came to another, containing Lake Dochen, whose waters, after a long
expanse of marsh, revealed themselves in a series of peacock blue
and green diagonals, stretching out towards the same Chomolhari
range, which seemed to follow us as we moved, though the peak was
now at our backs. We were anxious to make good time, as we had set
ourselves a double stage of some twenty-five miles. At an angle of
the lake stood the bungalow of Dochen, a mile over half-way, which
M. and G. decided to avoid, in order to take a short cut across the
lower ground by the lake. Feeling exhausted from want of sleep, I
wished to eat in comfort at a table, and, taking the saddle-bags
containing our joint lunch, proceeded to the bungalow, outside
which a huge train of ponies and their grooms was waiting. Entering
the door, I encountered Captain Smith, the British Trade Agent at
Gyantse, who was on his way down to Yatung and had halted for the
same purpose as myself. His companion, the doctor, galloped off to
stop the others. Meanwhile I drank greedily at some Ovaltine, and
felt nourished for the first time in weeks. Captain Smith, politely
averting his eyes from my swollen face and purple lips, said that
these altitudes did not suit him either, and that he hoped never to
see Gyantse again. The doctor, returning, said that if they didn't,
they didn't, and there was nothing to be done about it, which
depressed me. During lunch, another officer, McLeod, came in: he
had shot a gazelle, which was outside, in process of dissection,
that he might give us a haunch&mdash;a tiny animal, about three
feet high, with horns like a duiker's. Smith said afterwards that
we all looked pretty bad, and that he wondered at the time if we
should get through.</p>

<p>'Oh, you've got a Tibetan hat, have you?' remarked the doctor as
we made to depart.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered. 'It's almost saved my life. D'you like
it?'</p>

<p>'Well, I shouldn't wear one myself, you know&mdash;not warm
enough.' Saying which, he assumed a scanty tweed thimble. As the
Tibetan hat is presumably the warmest hat in the world outside the
Arctic Circle, he evidently considered me a traitor to the
Anglo-Saxon decencies.</p>

<p>'Personally, I like Tibet,' he continued. 'The Indian troops at
Gyantse are frightfully keen on hockey. I really get all the games
I want. It's a bit lonely sometimes. But as I say, I get all the
games I want.' And he shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of
perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>We went our way, they theirs, to our envy, at a canter. That
morning I had acquired a second pony no bigger than a dog, also
orange and decrepit. A third was now produced, similar in
appearance, but of a different spirit. To my surprise it trotted
smartly away from the bungalow, and, turning the corner of the
lake, proceeded up its western shore. After about seven miles we
came to a river, flowing out of the lake in a westerly direction,
evidently to a lower level. This had created a gorge, into which I
turned, finally losing sight of Chomolhari. Above the path a squat
square tower, slightly tapering and built of coarse brown stones,
bespoke the strategic significance of this point in the route.
Coming to a village, where the gorge widened, I mistook it for
Kala, and, on reascending from questioning two farm-women, fell in
with a party of riders who were evidently in a hurry to be at their
destination before night fell. Some were carrying guns; saddle-bags
of reddish brown hide bounced from their high, carpeted saddles.
They rode mules, which trot very quickly, without the jolting of a
horse; for no Tibetan ever rises in his stirrups. I had offered a
cigarette to the one beside me&mdash;a present which, being
forbidden by law, is always welcome&mdash;and was continuing at my
normal pace while he stopped to light it, when suddenly he passed
me at the gallop, and my pony, like a Gadarene swine, set off after
him. The reins were rotten, and would have broken had I exerted any
strength. Up and down the narrow path we clattered and thundered,
till at last I and mine slipped off it into two feet of water. This
made no difference to our speed. Then the sacking under the saddle
fell off, one girth broke, and I came to rest sitting on the
animal's ears in the midst of the whole party, who looked extremely
surprised. My competitor had retrieved the sacking, and now
reaffixed the saddle. Kala was upon us, and he pointed my way to
the bungalow.</p>

<p>Immediately I sat down the blood in my head began to pound with
a violence unknown to the previous days, and I relieved the
monotony by picking my face. The others arrived, and as soon as
mirrors were forthcoming, did the same. We were now without speech
of any sort, or the desire for it, and moved about our occupations
with a desperate fortitude. It was remarkable what a vivid interest
the face could provide. Every evening henceforth it was our first
concern and recreation on arrival. At first in small pieces, caked
with ineffectual grease; then, where there was no beard, in great
streamers, skin after skin peeled off, leaving us with raw, wet
complexions like a rabbit on the brink of the pot. Only the lips
remained impervious to our pains, ringed with sores that made every
bite a martyrdom. The most remarkable feature of our joint
appearance was G.'s nose, a prominent organ, which assumed a colour
to warm one's hands by.</p>

<p>That evening at Kala we ate the gazelle's haunch, which was
excellent, with French beans and mushrooms. How many more days? we
asked; and went to bed.</p>

<p>Kala gives its name to another lake, where the British Trade
Agent's party had shot a brace of geese, one of which they had very
kindly left behind for us. We only caught a glimpse of the lake, as
the road led off in the opposite direction, across a plain six
miles long, whose surface was covered with star-shaped cracks like
the bottom of a dry pond in summer. Since leaving Lake Dochen, the
landscape had changed; we were now below 14,000 feet; and the
glacial effects of the Chomolhari range and the lake had given
place to deeper and more tangible colouring. Damson, brown, and
gold, the hills rose above us as we reached the end of the plain,
their tops sugared with a blueish snow, and their colour, unlike
the misty depths of a Scottish glen, intensified by a microscopic
clarity of detail which revealed every pebble two and three
thousand feet above our heads. Behind, the blue of the sky pressed
forward. The hills were very close. A huge conformation of sharply
outlined boulders, slides, and cheeky strata rose above our heads,
colour of gilded caramel satin, tinged with pink: a dark tone in
itself, despite the blaze of sun that covered it; behind which, as
my eye reached its rim, the sky appeared as dark again,
comparatively, as a pool of ink soaking on to a clean sheet of
blotting-paper, and yet losing none of its colour of powdered
lapis. Words are inadequate to describe the effect. The light was
such that the colours had assumed a relationship and tonality
outside the normal ken. And as the sun, vilely near, beat upon us,
and the mind strove to believe the scenes that confronted it, the
desolation increased. After leaving Phari, we had found ourselves
on the moon; there was something credible in that; we have all
imagined the moon. But neither we nor anyone else had ever imagined
this. Save for our ponies' hoofs, and the bone-like rattle of dead
irises, a ponderous silence hung from the mountain-tops as we rode
through the middle-day, and the sharp outlines of the stones grew
blacker and longer. 'Oh for a tree!' groaned M. from the depths of
a temperament that finds beauty only in luxuriance. 'What a country
for motor-racing!' murmured G. 'I shall tell Segrave.' 'Well, it
won't see me again,' replied M. sharply, 'till there's a
wagon-lit.'</p>

<p>After Samoda, where we stayed the night and ate the goose with a
tin of sweet corn, there were no more plains. The road,
imperceptibly but surely descending, led through a series of
valleys, more hospitable in appearance, where the sun blazed hotly
and there was little air: on either side the same golden brown
hills, with their tops now almost clear of snow; overhead, from one
summit to another, the sagging blue firmament; fields of
cultivation; yaks, two at a time, straining forward to drag their
wooden ploughs through the dry baked earth, each team directed by a
fur-hatted, high-booted peasant; in the distance, square white
farm-houses, their perpendiculars still convergent, and furnished
at the four corners with small turrets, whence groups of sweet-pea
sticks gave the prayers of the inhabitants, untidy shreds of rag,
into the universe. Around stood the farm-buildings, and beyond
them, walled enclosures stacked with corn, in which
threshing-floors had been cleared, and men and women, up to their
waists in golden chaff and straw, were jumping and beating to
release the grain. As they worked they sang long-drawn rhythmic
utterances on one or two notes, filled with a cumulative solitude,
as though the hills themselves were speaking. These chants of the
ploughmen at work, borne miles along through the clear air and the
dancing light, from where, between river-bank and stony hill-side,
two long black specks and one upright one could been seen moving
slowly to and fro over a given limit, ring through my head still,
recalling for ever the land and its people.</p>

<p>A short distance down the valley, at Samoda, we passed an old
monastery, backed by a tall square tower, whose temple and outer
courtyard were in process of reconstruction. A nondescript crowd
gathered on the roof and laughed at us as we rode by. As the valley
expanded and twisted into another, a series of ruins, all of brown
stone, black-shadowed and conical, were visible from a farther
slope. Adjoining a farm-house in the distance was a walled grove of
yellowing willows, the first trees since we left the Chumbi Valley
above Gautsa. A butterfly flitted frivolously across the track.
That evening we stayed at Khangma, where the telegraph-wire was
tapped, and we telephoned to Captain Blood at Gyantse. Next morning
the valleys continued and the sun grew hotter. A red-leaved
berberis dotted the hillsides. In the river swam fish three inches
long. On its banks hopped huge iridescent magpies and speckled,
crested hoopoes. Mules, outspanned, were grazing on a stretch of
grass, while their drivers lay, as they had spent the night, in the
shelter of their loads.</p>

<p>Suddenly river and path converged to enter the 'red-idol gorge',
passing beneath the string of prayer-flags that marked the gate to
this place of sanctity. The walls of the gorge, of a brilliant
golden stone, displayed an astounding geological formation, like a
mighty pile of sandwiches and buns. At the bottom every rock was
heaped with miniature cairns, built of marble fragments. Down the
vertical face of one enormous boulder had been carved the life-size
figure of a Buddha, painted in red, white, and cold blues and
greens, and sheltered by an arbour of loose stones. Then the gorge
widened into another valley, and we reached the bungalow at
Saugong, to find that Captain Blood had already sent ponies to
bring us into Gyantse on the morrow. There, for the first time
since Phari, my head ceased to ache. We were now below 13,000
feet.</p>

<p>The rest-houses between Phari and Gyantse, whose hours of tedium
and misery are stamped indelibly on our memories, are of a Tibetan
rather than an Indian type, and externally at least resemble the
other Tibetan rest-houses which we saw, and which complete the
routes to Lhassa and Shigatse. The ever-guiding wire comes to rest
at a low square enclosure, not unlike a Tibetan farm-house, though
more kempt in appearance. A double door gives entrance to a
courtyard, cloistered with kitchens, sleeping-places for the
servants, and shelters for stores awaiting further transport.
Outside, a few men are standing about, perhaps loading or unloading
their animals. The women attached to the establishment, dressed in
the same coarse stuff as the men, and possibly wearing the
astonishing semicircular hoop of the Gyantse head-dress, or a
jacket embroidered with swastika and crescent, stand or sit in the
remains of the afternoon sun, dropping and catching their spools of
yarn. Tiny children, in miniature serge robes, play at their feet,
or practise their woollen slings in the direction of straying yaks.
The traveller arrives, dismounts painfully, and with his knees
unable to straighten, shouts 'Chowkidar!' for the caretaker. His
pony is led away to a stable at the side. He traverses the
courtyard, where, if the altitude and season permit, dwarf
hollyhocks, marigolds, and cornflowers are growing in pots, and
enters the bungalow at the back, which strikes cold after the sun
outside.</p>

<p>Two doors on the courtyard give access to two main rooms, behind
which are two smaller ones, and off them two bathrooms containing
washstands with tin basins, tin wash-tubs, and rickety commodes,
small and rusty. The other rooms have a bed and a fireplace each,
the latter a hole in the wall of such depth that all the heat is
effectually conserved in the chimney. In the smaller rooms are a
table, wooden chairs, and a bookshelf containing Edwardian novels
without covers, whose beginning- and end-pages are gradually
disappearing, copies of the <i>Journal</i> of the Royal
Geographical Society and the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes,</i> and a
bound volume of <i>Punch</i>. The walls, to the height of four
feet, are washed in shiny pillar-box red, a colour that came to
sicken us, above which they display a cold green. Between these two
runs a band of red, blue, and green stripes, each three inches in
width and picked out with gold. Over the doors and windows hang
curtains of a charming Tibetan stuff, coarse and hairy, and printed
all over with little crosses like a medieval tabard. This is made
in many colours, the prettiest patterns being red crosses on yellow
and red on white. These curtains can serve as supplementary
blankets, and even, if the clothes are wet, as Roman draperies. On
the floor lie Tibetan carpets, possibly ten feet square, of bold
colouring and Chinese design, which bear a singular resemblance to
those found in the more cultured residences of suburbia.</p>

<p>The caretaker hurries in, places a wisp of some dried
scrubby-looking plant in the fireplace, shreds a yak-pat on to it,
piles others above, and thus makes a fire, which, if it is to exude
a yard's radius of heat, must be re-fuelled every ten minutes. The
pronunciation of the word 'yak-pat' troubled us at first; till we
evolved the refined form of 'yappet'. In the same way our Swedish
biscuits, entitled by their makers 'crisp-breads', became more
euphemistically 'crippets'.</p>

<p>As it grows dark a turmoil without announces the arrival of
servants and mule-train. The luggage is hastily disposed in the
wrong rooms, then changed about. The sweeper, muffled to the nose,
crouches in the courtyard, filling the lamps from Ah-Chung's can of
oil. These, when brought, are of two varieties: one with a glass
chimney, the worst make to be had, which either flickers dimly, or
else, when turned up, emits a volume of smoke like an oil-well on
fire, so that the whole room is clouded with fluffy black smuts
that form a paste in the nostrils during the night&mdash;the glass
having cracked meanwhile, putting it out altogether and leaving us
to indemnify the caretaker; the other of an ingenious German type,
without a glass, but burning a certain proportion of air, which is
impelled into it by a ticking clockwork that runs down now and
then, and again leaves us in sudden darkness. In the wake of these
uncertain luminaries come tea and scones, with butter, jam, and
milk out of tins. This meal reveals what the Press calls a human
touch. Thanks, it appears, to the forethought of the late political
officer in Sikkim, Major Bailey, and his wife, each bungalow is
furnished with several specimens of Goss ware, whose municipal
heraldries bring poignant reminders of happy romps at Dolgelly and
improving afternoons at Stratford. It was intended, however, by the
donors, that the reminiscence should eventually be reciprocal. For
the initial letter of each mother-town represented corresponds with
that of the Tibetan village in which its offspring is now situated.
Thus, should I ever, during this present incarnation, succeed in
penetrating the fastness of KINGUSSIE, my imagination will at once
jump back the intervening years to the cosy hospitality of KHANGMA.
Similarly, SEAFORTH shall transport my spirit once again to sweet
SAUGONG, and SEA<i>FORD</i> to SAMODA. The most whimsical choice
has been that of BARNARD CASTLE for PHARI JONG. Major and Mrs
Bailey, to whom, in all seriousness, gratitude is due for the real
comforts of the bungalows, have introduced a new spice into the art
of travel.</p>

<p>After tea, and the facial operations described above, the time
comes for rum. Rum is G. and M.'s preference, since their whisky,
which has necessitated another mule, they find too disgusting to
touch. Hot water, richly flavoured with morsels of yak-dung, is
added, and also sugar. We crouch by the fire, sipping and
shivering, heaping the yappets into their insatiable hole. Follows
dinner, arranged by G.; the bedding is unpacked and made; hot-water
bottles are placed within. We say good-night, unwillingly shed our
numerous clothes, which are becoming increasingly smelly and dirty,
block the chinks of doors and windows, and leap chattering between
the sheets. Next morning, apart from my particular headache, which
fortunately did not recur on the return journey, we awake to a
sensation of profound nausea. A vapour of breath, yak-dung, and
lamp-smoke obscures the room; a blast of freezing air rushes in
with the sirdar as he brings the pot of tea, without which life
must be immediately extinguished. When dressed, we seek the
bathroom, where the sponge crackles with ice, and we gingerly wash
our hands and the tops of our eyelids, submitting to other
unmentionable operations entailing laceration and frostbite. And
then people say but the Tibetans are so dirty, aren't they? They
must be. But at least they preserve their faces. There can have
been no one in the whole country so filthy, so utterly repulsive to
look at, as ourselves by the time we arrived at Gyantse.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-6"></a>VI. THE PLEASURES OF GYANTSE</h3>

<p>The joy of life had returned. My headaches were gone. It was the
last morning of the journey. We were mounted on stocky Chinese
ponies, resembling those of Mabel Lucy Attwell, which set out to
cover the remaining fifteen miles at a canter.</p>

<p>Some four miles from the bungalow stood a monastery by the
roadside, a small country-house in appearance, flanked by a walled
grove of willows and poplars, outside which boy-novices in tattered
red robes were threshing. The road led on into a broad cultivated
valley, over to one side of which lay the larger Naini monastery, a
scattered complex of buildings, enclosed by a wall and extending up
into the crevices of the hinder hill, a conical mass of golden
putty crowned by a ruined fort. From a distance the foremost
buildings, a temple of the usual raspberry red, and others of
gleaming white, seemed insignificant; but this was mainly owing to
the absence of windows as a standard of magnitude. On approach they
towered above myself and the attendant groom, disclosing a massive
wooden door about fifteen feet high, evidently intended to
withstand attack. Inside this we were confronted by a cave
containing three diabolical pot-bellied images, life-sized and
ferociously coloured. These were protected by a wire netting,
presumably against the pigeons, whose ordered postures formed an
extra cornice to the adjacent temple. Beyond this stood three huge
<i>chortens</i> surmounted by elaborate finials of terra-cotta
tiles. The rest of the monastery consisted, as far as I could see,
of a wilderness of small houses, adorned with window-boxes of
marigolds and other flowers. Not a soul was about save for one
decrepit figure carrying a pitcher, who informed us that nothing
could be seen. We therefore returned to the road, where we met a
monk wearing above his red robes a tall peaked cap of lemon
yellow.</p>

<p>After passing through a defile in the hills we came out on a
broad plain, no barren waste, but broken into small fields by an
elaborate system of irrigation, and scattered with farms and
country-houses. On all sides the rampart of mountains continued.
But on the right, and far away on the left, at the ends of the
plain, they seemed to fit into one another like the wheels of a
cog, thus permitting the routes of Lhassa and Shigatse. In front of
us, as the road descended in a westerly diagonal, a great fort
could be seen, springing from a peaked eminence, and behind it a
wall of deep pink strung in a wavy line from summit to summit to
summit of the foot-hills. These were the Gyantse Jong and
monastery. Behind again towered a range of heather-coloured
mountains, beyond which the top of an occasional snowy peak
glittered in the blue.</p>

<p>The road was now alive with traffic, and I felt like a medieval
notable as I cantered round the bends and over the little bridges,
with my groom behind me. Drivers of pack-animals hastened to remove
them from the course; male riders dismounted in respect; female
reined in to one side. The farms and small country-houses, of white
composition ornamented with dark cornice-bands, bore an unexpected
resemblance, save for their corner turrets and prayer-flags, to
their European counterparts, being set in plantations of osiers and
poplars, and approached by drives, and sometimes by pretentious
gateways. At length we came to a river-bed fifty yards in width, in
which a fair volume of clear blueish water was swirling along, and
which was crossed by a broad, unrailed bridge, supported at close
intervals on massive, diamond-shaped piers of loose stones about
twelve feet high. Beyond this lay the town, a scene of striking
beauty: in the foreground, clumps and rows of poplars and willows,
each one a shower of bright golden leaves, an exquisite colour,
like that employed in mosaics; the Jong, built out of its hill, a
twisted, squat cone of putty-coloured rock whose lines of black
shadow were gathered to a climax by great faces and tiers of
masonry, converging one above another to a single flat cupola;
behind, the red monastery wall, looped from hill to hill like a
scenic railway, and fastened at each apex by a squat white tower;
beneath it the huge complex of monastic buildings, walled again in
front and centring on a crimson temple and a vast white
<i>chorten,</i> the latter being surmounted by a pointed golden
tower that flashed in the sunlight and carried on the colour of the
trees; behind again, the hills, a back-cloth of flat purple; the
flat blue sky; and last of all, immediately above the Jong, a
single cloud, a puffy Chinese thing with a black shadow to its
belly.</p>

<p>The rest-house, I judged, lay to the left towards the Jong, and
evidently some way out of the town, which was half hidden by the
latter's hill. The groom, however, guided me to the right down half
a mile of road neatly gravelled in grey, and enclosed by an avenue
of incipient poplars. At the end of this lay a mud fort and mud
barracks in the <i>Beau Geste</i> style of architecture, the
headquarters of the British Trade Agent, when in residence, and his
escort. I galloped up with a flourish, entered a courtyard, and,
ascending to an outside balcony, found G. and M., who had refused
to visit the Naini monastery, seated with Captain Blood in a room
with an incredibly ugly wallpaper, but comfortably furnished. The
first book that caught my eye was one of regulations for court
dress. This interesting work, if not wholly essential to life in
Gyantse, was probably connected with one of those periodic
examinations which now afflict the life of soldiers and drive them
to an early dotage. Blood gave us tea; then conducted us back past
the bridge to the rest-house, an enlarged version of all the
others, where there was a separate bedroom for each of us. Its
dining-room led out on to a verandah and a garden of grass,
enclosed by poplars and a wall.</p>

<p>Our first concern was to shave&mdash;a sickening process, with
only four skins instead of seven, and ten days' growth to remove.
We also bathed, seated in front of our respective fires. When we
met for tea, we struck one another as quite good-looking, and sleek
as suburban knuts.</p>

<p>That evening we went to the fort, drank up Blood's remaining
bottle of gin, and dined with him off soup, salmon, mutton,
apricots, and a kidney savoury. Afterwards, Little, a functionary
known as the 'conductor', and responsible for the troops' stores,
and Martin, who came up with the 1904 expedition as telegraphist
and has stayed here ever since, came in, the only other Europeans
in the place. Martin, a twinkling cockney, fell to reminiscences of
his youth. His innate tendency to sin had allowed him success
neither as an errand-boy, a race-card seller, nor a bookstall
keeper; so that he had been obliged to enlist. 'Oh the
music-'alls,' he said sentimentally, 'they used to 'ave some lovely
tunes. Did you ever 'ear this one?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>'Lottie Collins 'as lorst 'er drores,<br>
Will you kindly lend 'er yours?'</blockquote>
'Why,' I asked Blood, 'is there a trade agent here at all? It seems
a great expense for no apparent reason.'

<p>'I can't imagine,' was the reply. 'He doesn't seem to do
anything&mdash;nor do we, except meet him at the fourth milestone
when he arrives.'</p>

<p>'Obviously the usual process of "peaceful penetration",' snapped
G., who had lately assumed a veneer of liberalism. 'We shall soon
be ruling the entire country, when the proper "incidents" have been
manufactured.'</p>

<p>'We're far from it now,' said Blood. 'We're not at all top dogs
here by any means. The Kenchung&mdash;that's the Tibetan Trade
Agent and the man with the real power here&mdash;keeps a very firm
hand on things.'</p>

<p>It is in fact somewhat surprising to learn that there are Indian
troops in Tibet at all. But it is plain, on second thoughts, that a
political representative could not be left absolutely alone in the
heart of a potentially hostile country&mdash;as Tibet was in 1904
when the agencies were established&mdash;and a country lacking the
normal means of communication.</p>

<p>Next morning M. and I went again to the fort to send letters and
telegrams from the post-office there. Blood, who had been drilling
his seventy-five men, was in uniform. He said that they amused
themselves with hockey and polo; that the town was forbidden them
for fear of venereal disease; and that their winter supply of
buried turnips had just gone bad, which was a great blow. During
the rest of the morning I sketched the Jong from just over the wall
of the rest-house garden, basking in the sun. We were now at 12,000
feet. After lunch, joined by Blood and a stout and intelligent
youth in a Tibetan robe and buff Homburg hat, named Pemba, who was
educated in Darjeeling and now does most of Martin's work in the
Trade Agency, we proceeded across the intervening fields, stubble
and plough, to the Jong. The ascent was by means of a precipitous
path of loose stones. Above us, the huge convergent perpendiculars
produced that unique architectural effect which photographs of
Tibetan buildings had always conveyed, and which I had always
wanted to see. Creeping along a ledge towards a kind of landing
where we halted, shuffled a convict, heavily ironed about the legs,
who put out his tongue at us, the extreme gesture of supplication.
It appeared that he had been suborned by a woman to destroy her
husband; and that having been discovered, both he and she had
received a hundred lashes, face downwards, from the heels to the
neck, and would receive a hundred more, after which they would
probably be condemned to spend their lives in perpetual slavery.
The severity of this lashing depends on how far the relations of
the prisoner can, or care to, bribe its executioners. At present
the convict was being looked after by two little girls.</p>

<p>We were now about 500 feet above the plain. Immediately below
appeared a line of more or less substantial houses, piles of
yak-dung on their flat roofs, fodder drying in their courtyards,
and all round them the busy threshing-floors, from which an
unceasing chorus of shouts and songs rang through the air, as the
men and women drove their teams of four bullocks, cross between yak
and cow, in circular courses through the flying corn. Beyond, the
country was dotted with larger farms and country-houses, each with
its surround of golden trees. Then the fields stretched away in a
series of small, irregular squares, bounded each one by high
embanked ditches which are opened in winter to flood them and
freeze. Passing to the other side of the battlements, we looked
down on to the main street of the town, long and straight, which
led to the monastery entrance. Within the walls, houses, temples,
and <i>chortens,</i> red and white, with brass finials flashing,
stretched up the hill to the red wall at the back. The mountains
behind, only a mile or two away, reared slopes of gilded purple
into the deepening sky. From the walls of the Jong on this side,
the cliff fell sheer, casting a deep black shadow of stupendous
acreage over the hog's-back and the houses below it.</p>

<p>As we stood looking, the Jongpen came on the scene, a very
different type from the deputy castellans at Phari, a man of
breeding and comfort, who had preserved his teeth. His hair,
instead of hanging in a pigtail, was scraped up into a small
sausage on top, knotted in red and adorned at the centre with a
gold-and-turquoise brooch of excellent design, a circle of flat
segments supported on two bars. This he wore not as Jongpen but as
the son of his father, who was an official of the fourth rank. His
brother, Pemba informed us, was now Prime Minister. He was dressed
in a grey robe of once magnificent brocade, now discoloured and
dirty, beneath which he wore canoe-shaped shoes of black velvet
embroidered with yellow. A curly moustache descended from his
nostrils to frame a perpetual smile. His head was usually thrown
back to display a rippling throat. As Jongpen he was said to be
much respected, unlike the officials at Phari. His magisterial
jurisdiction, unhampered by the cunning of lawyers or the
imbecilities of juries, extends from Gyantse to the Tang-La, the
pass we had crossed on the first morning out from Phari. He had
been here eight years, he said, and had at first found it very
windy after the comparative shelter of Lhassa. It was over that
cliff there that prisoners such as the convict we had just seen
were formerly thrown to their deaths. But capital punishment was
now abolished.</p>

<p>He invited us to take some <i>chang</i> with him in his house,
to which he led the way down a precipitous path with surprising
agility for one of his age and deportment. In the rear came his
body-servant, a youth with an ill-grown pig-tail, who bandied words
with his master and showed little respect for him. Having walked
over the roof of his house and peered down his chimneys, we
descended by a hole and ladder into a courtyard and thence into a
darkish room, where we sat on draped seats about a foot high. The
large windows along one side were glazed. The furniture consisted
of various chests, the larger being panelled and painted with
floral designs of red, orange, and green. From the usual
crutch-pillar of carved and painted wood hung two official hats.
Against the wall was a pile of hide trunks, and one hat-box, shaped
as though to fit a top-hat, of white skin. Over these were fixed a
number of swords in worked silver scabbards, and also several
umbrellas and a rifle, the latter to give dignity to the Jongpen's
progresses. A joss-stick emitted a delicious smell.</p>

<p>Above this latter hung several banners representing Buddha and
the Wheel of Life. These paintings, widely used in both
ecclesiastical and domestic decoration, like the Orthodox icon, are
executed on an oblong of coarse, parchment-like paper, whose length
varies from four feet to nine inches, and which is itself mounted
on a rectangle of dark and boldly patterned Chinese silk,
broadening towards the bottom. This is furnished with a
brass-headed roller. The painting, half Indian, half Chinese in
character, is extremely delicate and can best be compared with the
art of the illuminator. There is a definite iconography for the
depiction of the Buddhist pantheon, which produces designs of great
beauty. In colour the artists display a sense of conventional
harmonies. Gold, as in Greek and Russian icons, is much used for
outlining and the indication of auras. Those banners which have
been toned with age are usually the more decorative; though the
Jongpen possessed one, specially executed for him in Shigatse,
which excited our envy. We eventually bought several from other
sources, despite our fears that their genuine artistic merits would
be obscured by prejudice against the returned Anglo-Indian's
trophies.</p>

<p><i>Chang,</i> a pale-green drink distilled from barley the day
before, was dispensed from a blue enamel kettle into little
porcelain bowls supported on silver saucers, themselves on stems.
After every sip these were immediately refilled. Manners demanded
at least three sips. But the taste, sour and refreshing, was not
unpleasant, and we felt no difficulties. Over a chest behind the
Jongpen peered various servants, and his small son, dressed in the
red serge of a monk, who was reluctant to come forward.</p>

<p>On emerging, we observed a number of figures standing on the
roof of a house 300 feet below. Blood said that there was a
wedding-feast in progress, of which this was the fourth day, and
which would continue for another six. Our desire was to attend it.
Pemba said we should assuredly be welcome. Remounting our ponies,
we descended, a groom going on ahead. I had reached the gateway of
the house when a sudden clatter in the rear made me turn: to behold
a cavalcade at a smart trot, mules and ponies gaily caparisoned, in
whose midst rode a stout figure in purple-and-buff silk, wearing
high boots of soft natural-coloured leather, dark glasses, and a
small Homburg hat. This was the Kenchung, the Tibetan Trade Agent,
monk official of the fourth rank and the preponderant figure in
Gyantse, to whom we had brought letters from Laden-La and
Macdonald. According to Pemba, while the internal administrative
duties fall to the Jongpen, the Kenchung's work is mainly
diplomatic, though he has a finger in most pies. Dismounting, he
shook hands with us all and invited us to lunch the day after
to-morrow.</p>

<p>The wedding-feast was being held by Tuksa, one of the Kenchung's
clerks: a rich man; for, in Pemba's opinion, he was more feared by
the common people, owing to his contact with them as a subordinate,
than the Kenchung himself. Crossing a courtyard, whose stables
harboured a row of saddled mules and ponies, we mounted a short
double ladder, to be received by our host, an old man with the
prominent nose, white moustache, receding chin, and benevolent
twinkle of a Victorian general. His grey hair, too short for the
process, was scraped back to form an untidy queue, like that of a
Hogarth perruque in the tying. He wore a long robe of patterned
sapphire silk. Surrounded by a multitude of the curious, he
conducted us to the apartment of honour, lately constructed as a
testimony to his wealth.</p>

<p>This apartment was without exception the oddest I have ever
entered socially. About thirty feet by twenty, its inner portion,
denoted by a railed dais and a drop in the ceiling, was approached
through a sort of vestibule. This was lighted, at the back, by a
long 'studio' window, against which two ghoulish ragged figures,
perched on an invisible roof, were pressing their noses. Above the
door, which was at the side, and opposite, hung two enormous
banners, splashes of scarlet on a light-blue ground. At the
approach to the dais the lower ceiling was supported by two
crutch-pillars, having brilliantly painted capitals, and stems
draped in multi-coloured flounces of different silks.</p>

<p>Beyond the dais the entire end wall was fashioned into a plaster
idolry. In tiers of niches, framed in blue, sea-green, and white
clouds, on which reposed groups of gazelle and other imperceptible
fauna, sat the monsters and philosophers of the Tibetan pantheon.
In the centre was a larger niche, containing a huge Buddha, which
was draped in a voluminous white scarf and flanked by a pair of
tall Chinese vases, red and green on white. At the foot of this
deity, opposite the opening in the railing of the dais, the wedding
presents were ranged in a pile, bricks of coarse-leaved tea, jars
of butter, dried mutton, fine cloths, of the type that tailors call
'Angola', and bales of silk, white and gold, red and purple. To
augment these, on returning to the rest-house, we despatched a tin
each of ginger-nuts, sardines, and smoked salmon. Meanwhile,
seating ourselves on low seats in a corner of the dais, we awaited
the advent of <i>chang.</i> Our host sat with us, and also an
officer of the disbanded Tibetan army, robed in light-blue silk and
wearing a khaki hat turned up on one side like a New
Zealander's.</p>

<p>A host of spectators crowded behind the railings, from which
emerged servants bearing enormous beakers of silver ornamented with
brass. These, two feet high and round in body, deserved their name,
for from the neck of each protruded a great shovel-like lip. Bowls
of gallon capacity, also of silver and brass, were filled from
them. From these again, women-servants, armed with silver ladles
studded with small turquoises, filled and kept filling our cups of
jade or blue-and-white porcelain.</p>

<p>The costumes of the servants were more extraordinary than any
pictures of the Celestial Empire have ever told. Each of the women
wore the Gyantse head-dress&mdash;a stiffened arc of red serge,
eighteen inches across and fourteen high, heavily studded with
corals and speckled turquoises, and bound, from a centre strut,
with ribbons of seed-pearls three inches wide. The blouses and
skirts, of an indefinite reddish purple, gave an upholstered, Mrs
Noah effect, the former being full-sleeved and the latter partially
covered by an apron horizontally striped in green and mauve and
finished at the upper corners with triangles of floral embroidery
set in gold. Round the waist hung a row of large knobs, possibly of
wood, strung on thick cord. At the neck appeared the inevitable
charm-box, a silver square studded with turquoises and hung
cornerwise. Across the breast stretched, as it were, an order of
seed-pearls, to the centre of which was attached a circular plaque
beautifully jewelled with differently coloured stones. One wrist
was encircled by a most curious ornament, a huge sea-shell,
partially cut away and somewhat resembling a nurse's starched cuff.
This whole costume, though varying in details, is more or less that
of all Tibetan women of all classes on state occasions, with the
exception of the head-dress, which is peculiar to Gyantse. That of
Lhassa consists of two coral and turquoise horns, from which the
hair descends in a black shower on either side. It is curious that
these particular ornaments should have become conventional, since
the seed-pearls, turquoises, and shell-cuffs all come from India,
while some of the coral is even imported from Italy.</p>

<p>The hats of the men-servants were scarcely less astonishing.
There were two kinds: one a circular plate, a foot and a half
across, balanced on top of a close-fitting cap, which was hidden by
a thick red fringe descending from the rim of the plate; the other
a buttercup-yellow hot-cross-bun, nine inches in diameter, whose
connection with the head was maintained by no visible means; and
which, when the head was shaven, as in one case, produced an
appearance of fantastic oddity in conjunction with a single
blue-and-pearl earring four inches long.</p>

<p>A dessert dish of silver and copper was brought, containing
preserved oranges, candy sugar, dried apples, and biscuits from
Reading. We nibbled, while the women with their ladles loomed over
us like angry nurses persuading babies to their milk. M., learning
from some mysterious source that eight was a lucky number, resolved
to drink eight cups. I was more diffident. And my apple-cheeked
servitor, passably snub and good-looking, complained bitterly to
the host of my obduracy. It was an astounding scene: the rows of
ladling dolls, beneath their swaying jewelled arcs; the scarlet
parasols and yellow buns nodding, as the men poured the beakers
into the bowls; the straining crowd below the dais; the reredos of
clouds and images; the painted pillars and banners; and the great
window framing its ghoulish silhouettes.</p>

<p>Taut, we rose. The host led us through other rooms, smaller but
richly furnished: in one, a segregation of women; in another, men
at games of dominoes, among whom was the bridegroom, a handsome
youth in a high-collared robe of rich brown brocade tied at the
waist with a green sash. Already an official at Lhassa, he was now
on leave for his marriage. This room contained a cabinet, somewhat
in the manner of a Chippendale combination of bureau and bookcase,
save that there was no actual bureau. This was wholly covered in
wrought brass. In the cornice moved a dragon.</p>

<p>That evening Blood, Martin, and Little dined with us at the
rest-house. Unfortunately the <i>chang</i> had rendered us inert,
and our spirits lagged. The consumption of whisky more than
justified G. and M.'s hopes. Martin sang:</p>

<blockquote>'She's only a bird in a gilded caige,<br>
Such a bewtiful sight to see!<br>
You may think that she's 'appy and free from care;<br>
She's not&mdash;though she seems to be.<br>
<br>
It's sad when you think of 'er waisted life,<br>
For youth cannot maite with aige.<br>
'Er bewtee was sold for an old man's gold.<br>
She's&mdash;a&mdash;bird&mdash;in&mdash;a&mdash;gilded&mdash;caige!'</blockquote>

<p>His thoughts then turned to rosy dreams of old age and
retirement in a cottage by the sea, as they might, after spending a
quarter of a century in Tibet, burying two Tibetan wives, visiting
Darjeeling once, and finally winning a substantial sweepstake,
whose proceeds were nestling in the bank.</p>

<p>The south coast I favour,' he mused. 'What's this 'ere
Peace'aiven they talk so much about?'</p>

<p>'I think you'd find the south coast rather different from what
it was when you left England,' said M., throwing off the lethargy
of his eight cups.</p>

<p>'Per-raps I should,' replied Martin slowly, and paused to think.
'But I saiy, Lord Oojah, what about a nice little lodge, where a
man could end 'is daiys in peace? I'm serious, mind you&mdash;a
reformed character and all that.'</p>

<p>Gyantse not so long ago was the scene of doings which reflected
sadly on the impeccable reputation of our countrymen. Captain A.,
now dead, was then in command; and the military treasury, since
transferred to the custody of Indian bankers, was his to dispose
of. The post-office at the fort was the nucleus of a gambling
society, which included the then Jongpen, and whose orgies used to
continue for days on end, regardless of meals. Mistresses were
freely kept. Upon this happy scene came B., a superior, who
proceeded to reforms. A., however, discovered that B. also had his
failings, though of a different type, and proceeded to suggest a
compromise of <i>laissez-faire</i> on both sides, which might have
been arrived at had not C., a detached observer, also acquired
knowledge of B.'s misdemeanours and officially reported them. B.
fled, followed by A., who believed that he was about to murder the
then Trade Agent at Yatung, on account of his misfortunes. Finally
B. left the service, and A. continued his gambling in peace till,
in the natural course of things, he was relieved. The treasury was
then found to be 150,000 rupees short. A. was arrested, escaped,
and fled down to India in his turn, where he was recaptured and
cashiered. His successor was an Indian officer, who being no
arithmetician, handed over the treasury and accounts to some of
A.'s old <i>confr&egrave;res.</i> Two years passed. The time for
the Indian's relief had arrived, when, early one morning, he was
discovered in a dying condition. Martin and Little assumed the
r&ocirc;le of detectives. But their surmises are better not
repeated.<br>
<br></p>

<p>At a quarter to ten on the following morning Pemba arrived to
herald a visit from the Kenchung, to whom we had despatched our
letters of recommendation the day before. First, however, there was
time to visit the bazaar. We walked across the fields, rounded the
base of the Jong, and came to a long narrow street, as much a
gutter as a road, from whose walls of sombre grey stucco an
occasional head protruded through a tiny window. Behind us now, the
Jong assumed a new shape, a fantastic stepped apex like a Rhineland
castle, only plainer and untroubled by pepper-box roofs. The booths
of the bazaar, which shuts at midday, were contained in a narrow
lane, exhibiting beads and mirror-topped boxes from India, the
rejected Homburg hats of the whole world, piles of loose
turquoises, rows of Gyantse head-dresses, unstiffened and neatly
folded, and a peculiar species of scissors whose blades resembled
battered table-knives. Tempted by nothing, we returned to the
rest-house in a state of exhaustion after walking three miles at
this height.</p>

<p>The Kenchung's advent was announced by the naked carcase of a
sheep and a dish of eggs. We hurried out to meet him. On entering,
he inclined and, stretching out both his arms, presented us with a
broad white scarf of closely woven silk. His general dress was the
same as yesterday's: short jacket of buff velvet, woven with a bold
pattern of bamboos, that vile pattern of lodging-house
fire-screens, now redeemed and made beautiful by its context; a
skirt of flowered purple; and the boots of natural leather. But his
hat, instead of Homburg, was now official: a shallow dome of
brilliant yellow silk, rising from a stiff round brim, richly
embroidered in bright colours, and surmounted by a large knob of
coral. It was an exquisite adornment, tilted sideways from the very
top of his head over his bland brown face, with its huge smile and
glittering denture. He lay back in a chair, drinking tea.</p>

<p>Did he, we inquired through Pemba, ever telephone to the Dalai
Lama? He did, frequently. There was a telephone in his room.</p>

<p>Had he ever visited Pekin? He had: first as a boy of eighteen,
when he went to learn Chinese, which he can now speak but not
write; again as interpreter to the Dalai Lama, when the latter fled
from the British in 1904.</p>

<p>After half an hour he asked permission to take leave, as the
custom is, hoping to see us to-morrow.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we received another call, from the two sons of
Rajah Tehring. Of the history of this dignitary I shall tell later.
Jigmed, the elder, a handsome boy of about nineteen years, spoke
English and had his hair short. His brother did not, and sported a
pig-tail. Both were dressed in the usual purple robes, fastened by
small gold buttons. We delivered Perry's wedding present to Jigmed,
and showed him Sir Charles Bell's <i>People of Tibet.</i> The
frontispiece of this book depicts a family group in which are
seated two living Buddhas, small children, and their mothers. 'Why,
that's my sister!' he exclaimed, pointing to one of them.</p>

<p>When they had gone I went for a solitary ride, rounding the Jong
and striking out into the country through a subsidiary village. My
aim was Tsechen, a conical hill spattered with buildings, about
five miles away. But I overshot the necessary bridge, and, seeing
another village high up in a mountain cleft above my head, turned
towards it. The ground was thickly covered with stones the size and
shape of biscuit tins, and intersected by deep gullies. The farther
I rode, the farther the village receded. The sun was setting, and
eventually I was obliged to turn back. The scene confronting me was
one of superlative grandeur. In the foreground rose the gentle
range on whose other side lay the monastery, and along whose top
the red hinder wall was suspended from summit to summit, a chain
half a mile long, pinned to the rock by embattled towers. In the
farther distance the Jong reared aloft on its pinnacle, a twisted
silhouette, save where the falling sun swathed the sides of the
receding topmost blocks in sheets of gold. Below stretched the
plain, whence the shouts and chants of the threshers still echoed
from each trampled floor. And all round stood the purple mountains,
with their clefts and valleys bathed in a sharp glinting sapphire.
The land swept away, curveted into the foot-hills, fell hesitantly,
leapt and fell again to the plain, bounded up like a tidal wave
into the nearer mountains, spouted out the Jong, and ran twinkling
into the distance, slowed, compressed itself, assumed the darkness,
disappeared, and came to light in a farther range, in time to hide
the fallen nebula of fire whose last tongues still persisted above
the horizon in their appeal to the awakening stars. The red wall
darkened to crimson, suspended from peak to peak, a work of
giants.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-7"></a>VII. LUNCHING OUT</h3>

<p>We awoke to the morning of Thursday, 12 October, with a sense of
impending adventure: lunch with the Kenchung. At half-past eleven
Pemba arrived, and we all rode out to the foot of the Jong, round
it, and up the main street of the town to the monastery entrance.
The threshold, flanked by massive portals, revealed another town,
more various and polychrome than its civil counterpart, whose
temples and dwellings, amounting to some hundreds, lay scattered
over a rocky slope. This formation, which rose eventually to
something like a precipice, was topped by the chain of pink wall
whose rear I had admired on the previous evening. I asked Pemba how
a community of five or six hundred monks could find use for such a
vast agglomeration of buildings. There were temples, he replied,
common to the whole community, which were used at festivals; and
there were also, as I understood him, parish temples, each parish
consisting of about fifty monks drawn from the same district. Then,
in addition, the monks must have somewhere to live. The lower ranks
shared their dwellings. Hierarchs and officials, such as the
Kenchung, had separate houses, and these again were furnished with
stables and servants' quarters.</p>

<p>The scene, though almost deserted of human beings, offered a
peculiar animation such as inspires the abstract compositions of
modernist painters&mdash;save that here it took shape in three
dimensions and occupied about twenty acres instead of as many
square inches. Nowhere but in lands that have inherited the culture
of the Celestial Empire is architecture infused with quite this
same radiant activity. The secret of it lies partly in its use of
colour on an unparalleled scale, but more fundamentally in its
universal convention of the batter, which makes every wall of every
building, no matter how small its height, slope inwards in a
straight line from the ground-level. Whatever the origin of this
convention&mdash;whether it be utilitarian, emotional, or merely
the legacy of extinct tradition&mdash;its ability to produce
harmony among buildings and to reinforce the genius of the
architectural group is unsurpassed. Architecturally speaking,
nothing could have been more haphazard than the medley that
confronted us, perched at all levels, jostling together at one
place, leaving large unoccupied areas at another. Furthermore, it
became evident, on closer inspection, that the buildings were in
fact of no great size, while the construction of most, if not
actually shoddy, had an air of impermanence which derived, like
that of colonial exhibitions, from their coatings of stucco and
colour-wash. Yet viewed as a whole, the enormous complex gave an
impression not only of movement, but of unity and organic strength.
Each crimson temple and pastel dwelling, clear-washed and richly
shadowed by the morning sun to distinguish it from the
putty-coloured rock of the hill face, thrust its perpendiculars
aloft to converge on the long swinging wall that topped the
enclosing ridge. Between the pallid rock and the blazing azure sky,
with its flotilla of bursting, light-filled clouds, this wall of
crushed strawberry, adorned with towers and crenellation of creamy
white, formed a line of demarcation in terms of pure colour whose
intensity was something strange to architecture as I had hitherto
conceived it. Only in two places was the line interrupted: on the
right, by a huge stone pylon, grey and serious amidst the
surrounding festivity, on which, at sacred occasions, is hung a
stupendous painted banner of Buddha, some sixty feet in height; and
in the centre, by a smaller building, of flaming golden orange,
which leapt into the sky above the wall like the cry of an
advancing multitude.</p>

<p>There was still some time before lunch and, accompanied by a
band of monks in robes of worn red serge, we set out to explore the
individual monuments. Most prominent of these, being situated
almost immediately in front of the main entrance, was the chief
temple, a severe building of iced-cake pink encircled at the top by
a narrow white band, above which ran a deeper band, as it were, of
crimson plush, to emphasize its meeting with the sky. Such cornices
are a convention of Tibetan sacred architecture, and their richness
of texture, as much as their colour, was a puzzle to me until,
during our journey back, I came on a temple in the building. Groups
of women were at work binding together bunches of some stout,
heather-like plant, then cutting off the roots so as to form a neat
circular end, and dipping these ends in a clotted crimson dye. When
dry, the bunches were placed one on top of the other, with the dyed
ends outwards, to make the decoration of the cornice. The effect
produced, when seen from below, is that of a rich velvet ribbon,
which runs right round each temple, binding the convergent activity
of its walls and wings into a coherent design.</p>

<p>Upon the cornice of the chief temple in the Gyantse monastery,
above the entrance, were applied two neat golden ciphers, while, as
is also usual, a row of tall brass pinnacles of twisted bulbous
form flashed from the roof-line above. The entrance was contained
in a square arch, which contrasted actively with the pyramidical
outlines beside it. This was divided across the middle by a
balcony, supported on four crutch-pillars, and itself supporting
another four, less in height, which upheld a kind of projecting
carved screen immediately below the velvet cornice. Between the
lower pillars we now proceeded, to view the interior. This again
was supported on crutch-pillars painted red, which cut sharply
across the intermittent beams of light that came from small
windows. The floor was occupied with rows of padded cushions, which
we were careful not to step on, or even to step over, in accordance
with the instructions given us by Laden-La. At the back were
various shrines and altars, each presided over by a large gold
image, whose general arrangement resembled that of any Roman
Catholic church. The images were draped in scarves; before them
stood vases of artificial flowers and innumerable butter lamps, big
and small. Behind the main altars was a sort of ambulatory, lined
with further images, whose over-natural dimensions and close
juxtaposition filled the stranger with uncomfortable awe. The whole
interior was pervaded with the smell of rancid butter&mdash;a
hideous, overpowering odour, reminiscent of a dairy where one's
fears as to the cleanliness of all dairies have at last come
true.</p>

<p>Adjoining the temple was a library, where all the books, printed
off wooden blocks on long strips of paper and tied between heavy
wooden boards, in lieu of binding and cover, were kept in rows of
wooden pigeon-holes. In addition there was a museum, and this
indeed was one of the strangest apartments I have ever set foot in.
Jumbled together in what was ordinarily complete darkness, and
covered with a thick substantial dust that one could gather in
handfuls and pinch between the fingers, we distinguished such
objects as a captured Chinese banner, suits of medieval chain
armour, bows and arrows, metal helmets, and stuffed scaly animals
resembling armadillos. From this cavern of past and perhaps
glorious history we progressed by devious passages and many ladders
to other temples, where the statues of celebrated lamas, coloured
realistically and robed in their proper vestments, gazed upon us
from their ceremonial chairs. Finally we emerged blinking into the
sunlight to visit the great <i>chorten</i> of the monastery, a
babel of polygonal galleries, whose innumerable projecting
embrasures, each reproducing in miniature those of the gallery
below, and each furnished with its own window, produced an
intricate yet apprehensible pattern of shadow and ornament. Atop
the five tiers of this huge white ant-heap&mdash;for that is what,
in general shape, it most resembled&mdash;rose a shallow white
drum, pierced by four doorways elaborately carved and coloured.
This supported a square structure, decorated on the cornice with
pairs of eyes, above which glittered the final cone, a fabulous
erection of ribbed brass, upholding a fretted double cog-wheel,
from twenty to thirty feet in diameter, below its last finial.</p>

<p>It was now one o'clock and time for the anticipated meal. The
Kenchung's house was visible up a narrow passageway, whose cobbled
slope and high dilapidated walls reminded us of Nuremberg. This
gave access to a well-like courtyard, overlooked by three storeys.
On the ground floor, sheltered by a cloister on wooden supports,
stood the Kenchung's mules and ambling ponies at their feed. The
upper storeys were approached by a succession of steep,
metal-treaded ladders. Our host received us on the top floor and
led us into a long low room divided in the middle by a partition.
The windows, looking on to the courtyard, were open, propped inward
and upward like those of a skylight. Though glazed on the outside,
they still retained the original paper within. Beneath them a
square of divans was arranged round a low table covered with
American cloth. We sat facing the light, with the Kenchung opposite
us. He had divested himself of his buff jacket and now appeared all
in purple silk. On his broad brown face and shaven head reposed a
pair of gold spectacles. As usual, the unlighted wall of the room
was stacked with trunks, which were covered in white skin or black
fur, the coverings being separate. In India, he assured us, these
trunks would rot and stink.</p>

<p>A cheap kitchen clock hung in one corner. On a chest stood
another of a late Empire design, mahogany and ormolu. From his
pocket the Kenchung produced a fat silver watch, to whose chain was
attached a gold toothpick, later to be freely used. In addition to
these, a servant came in bearing an alarm-clock still wrapped in
cotton-wool and cardboard. By dint of consulting all four
timepieces, our host informed us that we were late. We admitted to
five minutes, but he said half an hour. We saw in this stricture no
discourtesy, but rather a desire to convince us of a life regulated
on business lines.</p>

<p>At first English tea was brought, with sugar, milk, and
teaspoons. The Kenchung then asked us if we would care for Tibetan
tea instead. We would. This was served to us in bowls of
blue-and-white porcelain on silver stands, while he drank his out
of a bowl of that very rare jade which is flecked with pale gold.
This had a silver lid, finished with a blob of coral. Noticing our
admiration of it, he showed us another bowl of whiter jade. But
this had been spoilt by a poor carving of trees. The tea itself,
made with flour, butter, soda, and salt, might have tasted not
unpleasant but for its association with the smell of the temple. I
could not touch mine. The others drank two cups each.</p>

<p>At length the first course was brought&mdash;a series of small
cold dishes containing slices of hard-boiled egg, seaweed, pease
gelatine and mutton, cabbage and chile, yak beef, turnip, and other
unknown vegetables. Each guest was given a pair of polished bone
chopsticks, delicately squared, which had to be manipulated like
tongs, the second finger being used as a pivot on which to hinge
them. I found myself fairly proficient. But G. and M. were so messy
that they were provided with short-handled porcelain spoons in
which to catch the drips. After a few minutes my manners were
discredited also by my inadvertently swallowing a large piece of
chile and being obliged to call hurriedly for a glass of
<i>chang.</i> Ordinarily, it is not the custom to drink with
meals.</p>

<p>These preliminary delicacies were followed by others more
pretentious, which were served in larger bowls: sea-slugs mixed
with mutton, liver, force-balls, and a kind of flat spaghetti mixed
with vegetables. The latter was accompanied by the most delicious
Chinese vinegar, made out of barley and poured from an English
lodging-house cruet. A silence fell upon us all, as we jabbed and
grabbed and munched and sucked. From outside came the tinkle of
mule-bells and the incessant thud-rumble of a strangely melodious
drum, denoting a prayer session in the vicinity. The portentous
dignity of our host, together with his servants and surroundings,
reminded me of similar occasions on Mount Athos&mdash;though
Tibetan food is preferable to any that is found in Greece&mdash;and
the reminiscence was strengthened by two white doves in
skin-bottomed wicker cages which hung outside the window. There had
once, said the Kenchung, been a monkey, but it had bitten visitors.
Now only a Saluki puppy prowled about the room, conveniently
gobbling up those adamant morsels which from time to time we found
it necessary to remove from our mouths when no one was looking, and
secrete under the table.</p>

<p>We asked our host if he had a library. He replied that he read a
great deal. A book was brought, printed at Shigatse, and consisting
of pages eighteen inches by four, with text on both sides and
numbered in the margin. The boards containing it, when opened, were
held by a ribbon at right angles, so that they formed a sort of
reading-desk. The theme was the sanctity of a certain lama who had
lived about eight hundred years earlier and whose life had been
compiled by his disciples. Once more we were back in the Middle
Ages, when the only literature was sacred. I wondered if there were
lighter figures among the immortals of the Tibetan Church, such as
Susannah or Joseph and Balaam.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, we asked permission to examine the
inner room behind the partition. Here was the telephone, of an
antique wooden-box type, on which, our host again assured us, he
often spoke to the Dalai Lama. A photograph of a temple at
Katmandu, the capital of Nepal, hung diagonally from the beam. In a
corner, a prayer-wheel in the shape of a hollow paper cylinder was
revolving of its own accord, thanks to the mysterious action of a
lamp beneath it, which heated the air in such a way as to produce
this uncanny rotation. There were various banners and images. But
the pride of the room was a pair of magnificent cloisonn&eacute;
vases, about twenty inches high and a foot in diameter, which had
been sent as a present from Lhassa.</p>

<p>By the time we rose it was three o'clock. As we crossed the
landing to descend, we noticed that the noise of the drum had come
from an adjoining room, where a monk could be observed through an
open door reciting his prayers beneath a composite portrait of the
Chinese royal family. When we were outside, I asked Pemba if I
could go up the hill to the foot of the pink wall, in order to
sketch and photograph. It was impossible, he said; there was no
path. I therefore waited till he and the others had left, when I
made my way up the hill of my own initiative, leaving my groom, who
seemed rather worried, to hold my pony near the entrance. I had not
gone far when I was joined by a young monk, who stank of butter,
but insisted forcibly on carrying my things and helping me over the
loose stones. Remembering Laden-La's advice never to remain alone
in a monastery, I was glad of his company. While I sketched, he
followed every movement of the pencil. Whenever I blew, to remove
the shreds of india-rubber, he blew too, asphyxiating me with his
rancid breath. But this friendly, almost proprietary, interest in
my doings filled the afternoon with soothing and content, as the
shadows drew out and I sat on the heights absorbing the remote and
gorgeous beauty unfolded at my feet.<br>
<br></p>

<p>On the estate of Tehring, about six miles from Gyantse, there
resides a magnate known as Rajah Tehring, whose title is an Indian
honour and who was once heir to the throne of Sikkim. At the end of
the last century his father, the then Maharajah of that State, had
fled to Tibet from the English, and though he himself, as the
Maharajah's eldest son, had been invited by the Government of India
to return, the Tibetans had prevailed on him to refuse, endowing
him with compensatory estates in the neighbourhood both of Gyantse
and of Kampa Jong, near Everest. Eventually he had married a
Tibetan wife. Among the children she had borne him were the two
sons who had already called on us at the rest-house some days
earlier. The eldest of these, Kumar Jigmed Namgyal, had been
educated in Darjeeling, since the present Maharajah of Sikkim, on
his first accession, was childless, and it appeared that Jigmed
must succeed him. Since then, however, the Maharajah has had
children. Both Jigmed and his brother had recently married
daughters of the great house of Tsarong, whose male line was
extinguished in a bloody passage by their adopted father, the most
remarkable figure, after the Dalai Lama, in modern Tibetan history.
This gentleman, a person of no family&mdash;and family counts for
much in Tibet&mdash;had then assumed the name of Tsarong and had
risen to be commander-in-chief of the Tibetan forces. It was he who
fought the rearguard action at the Tsang Po which saved the Dalai
Lama from the pursuing Chinese in 1910. According to Tibetan
custom, his duty towards his 'daughters' had been expressed, on
their reaching maturity, in a fashion more intimate than paternal.
But as leader of the Westernizing party in the country, he had been
at pains to have one of them educated in Darjeeling also, and it
was this girl who had married Jigmed. The English had called her
Mary, because her real name, which was Tromsa, or something like
it, denoted a corresponding divinity in the Tibetan pantheon. It
was as Mary that we came to know her. Her sister we never saw, for
she was seriously ill. The poor girl died when Jigmed and Mary were
away in India, about six weeks after we had left Tibet.</p>

<p>In the bosom of this family, on the day following our lunch with
the Kenchung, we had been invited to take lunch once more and spend
the afternoon. Blood, thank God, mounted us on his stocky Lhassa
ponies, and about eleven o'clock we rode out of the fort in a
cavalcade on our way to Tehring. At first we went straight across
country&mdash;a country of intense cultivation, where a field was
never more than fifty yards square and was invariably surrounded on
all four sides with irrigation ditches. Since these latter varied
considerably in width, and we were going at a fast canter, the ride
had an element of the unexpected. Sometimes the pony would jump,
sometimes stop dead to step across sedately, and sometimes, at the
apparition of a main canal, wade in up to its belly. But there was
never a sign of reluctance, and neither stones, banks, nor the
hard-baked furrows in the autumn stubble, caused the pace to
slacken. By degrees, as we took it in turns to lead the procession,
our progress became a race, a literal point-to-point, since its
direction was decided by Blood's waving at the horizon from time to
time and saying, 'We pass that house next, and afterwards the trees
on the left.' At length a row of wooden telegraph-poles no higher
than clothes-props came in sight and we joined the Lhassa road.
This highway consisted of a number of separate mule-tracks, about a
foot wide each, which twisted their various courses over the
pebbles and between the boulders.</p>

<p>An imperceptible pass, marked by the usual pair of cairns,
brought us to another plain. Being in front at the time, I ventured
an inquiry of two pedestrians as to the whereabouts of Tehring. In
reply they pointed to a group of trees three miles off. To the
north the weather had broken, the hills loomed blue, and
threatening clouds had settled on their tops. When we drew level
with the trees, a short drive indicated the mansion of the estate,
which reminded me of those unpretentious houses occupied by the
Hungarian squirearchy. A long, whitewashed fa&ccedil;ade confronted
us, adorned with the usual cornice-band at the top and constructed
with the usual batter. Three lines of windows denoted three
storeys. Servants were waiting at the top of the drive, who led us
round to the other side of the house, where the main entrance was
enclosed by a broad courtyard used partly for stabling and partly
for the storing of wood and yak-dung. Here Jigmed met us, and we
passed through a doorway with richly carved and coloured
lintel-brackets on to an earthen floor and up a double ladder. On
the landing above, others of the family were assembled: Rajah
Tehring, his wife, and his daughter-in-law Mary. The rajah was a
small man, with a brown complexion and wispish turned-down
moustache, beneath which a twinkling smile lightened his grave
countenance. He was dressed in a robe of purple-flowered silk with
a high collar, and wore the inevitable single ear-ring. Jigmed wore
a robe of maroon silk, beneath which showed an undergarment of
amber brocade. This magnificence was marred by a tweed hat, which
he now removed. The ranee sported a superlative Gyantse head-dress,
whose diameter exceeded anything we had seen. Her charm-box was in
proportion. She lowered her eyes to the ground with old-fashioned
modesty as she shook hands with us. Mary wore a blouse of thick
purple silk and the usual apron of horizontal stripes, which was
finished at the hips with triangular panels of gold and silk
embroidery. Her hair hung down in thick plaits. She was entitled to
wear the Lhassa head-dress, but found it too heavy for all but the
most ceremonious occasions.</p>

<p>They ushered us into a low oblong room, whose windows were open.
I remarked to Blood that Tibetan rooms never seemed stuffy, as one
would have expected in so inhospitable a climate. He replied that
they never were, but were consequently very cold in winter. We sat
on divans, richly draped, and partook of cakes and dried fruits.
English tea was brought, and a new kind of <i>chang</i> with a fizz
in it. The rajah had his own jade cup of Tibetan tea. Jigmed and
Mary fetched two musical instruments&mdash;a Tibetan banjo and a
Chinese fiddle. They played Tibetan and Nepali tunes, which were
quite intelligible to our ears and reminded us of Scottish
folk-songs. Then a servant came in and did a shuffling dance.</p>

<p>After lunch, whose thirty or so dishes confirmed our faith in
the excellence of Tibetan cooking, the rajah produced three
European bottles, whose contents&mdash;port, martini, and
anisette&mdash;warmed our inquisitiveness. Since it was a holy day,
he had not eaten meat during the meal. Would he now be obliged, we
asked, to attend a religious service? No, this was not necessary;
for lamas had been called in to do his duties for him. We could see
them, if we wanted. So we trooped across the landing outside to the
chapel, where four monks were squatting in yellow cloaks, intoning
their prayers&mdash;and presumably the rajah's&mdash;to the note of
a hanging drum, which one of them struck with a long curved stick.
From time to time another made passes in the air with bell and
thunderbolt, and curious motions with his fingers. But of the
significance of these rites Jigmed could not inform us. He excused
himself by saying that none of the family ever took any part in
religious observances, since they were all conducted by proxy. This
was an excellent principle, we thought. Nevertheless, I was later
to see Jigmed, at Buddh Gaya, conducting his devotions in
person.</p>

<p>Another room on the same landing was occupied by the manufacture
of carpets, on big looms, from which depended balls of different
coloured wool. A daughter of the house was hanging about to catch a
glimpse of us, a pretty girl with a delicate rosy complexion, whose
head had been shaved prior to her becoming a nun. Then we went out
to see the garden&mdash;a patch of coarse grass within a stone wall
and sheltered by a plantation of poplars, whose golden leaves
showed bright against the threatening sky and fell to the ground in
showers before the gusts of an evil wind. Here joined us the
Benjamin of the family, an impish creature of four years old, with
ears like flails, and a perpetual laugh. His best cap, embroidered
with flowers, was fetched that I might photograph him in it. His
game was to frighten the servants by peering at them through a
forbidding papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; mask.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the garden was a smaller house, in whose
upper storey, approached by an outside stair, lived Jigmed and
Mary. Their rooms were in a confusion of packing, as they were
starting to-morrow to visit their estate at Kampa Jong, with the
intention of proceeding to India and making a pilgrimage to Buddh
Gaya. We planned to meet in Calcutta. The house boasted some pieces
of European furniture, a portrait of the King-Emperor, and a
photograph of Jigmed in a school group. He had been forced, when in
Darjeeling, to learn Latin, and now declined the singular of
<i>mensa</i> to our astonished ears. At length, when all the
household had assembled in farewell, some in the courtyard and some
on the roof, we cantered off to Gyantse again, in an effort to
reach home before the approaching storm could overtake us.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Next morning, by permission of the Kenchung, we had arranged to
visit Dongtse, twelve and a half miles away. Blood again mounted
us, and we set off at half-past nine, rounded the town, and made
for Tsechen, the village on the conical hill that had been the
objective of my solitary ride some afternoons ago. Opposite this
place the river was crossed by a substantial bridge carried on
stone piles. At this point it started to rain, and G. and M. began
to question the wisdom of continuing our expedition. On hearing
this I dug my heels into my pony and set off at full gallop in the
direction of Dongtse, before they could reach an adverse decision.
My groom followed, and eventually Blood caught me up with another
groom. We then discovered that while we had the plates, knives, and
forks, the others were carrying the food. Blood's groom was
therefore sent back to effect an exchange, in case they had really
decided not to come on.</p>

<p>The road passed at first over unfenced grazing-ground, somewhat
resembling an English common, then contracted to a mere footpath
hemmed in by cultivated fields. All round the hills looked black,
and snow was falling on their tops. Blood pointed out the pass to
Shigatse, and I felt that only his presence prevented me from
setting my pony in that direction. At one point we passed a huge
prayer-wheel worked by a stream and striking a bell every ten
seconds. Farther on appeared four monks huddled in a garden beneath
hats like red hearth-rugs and chanting their office to the cold
wind. A Jong stood up from the horizon, perched on a rock, the
centre of a small administrative district. A prayer was written in
white stones on a bare hill-side, like the name of an English
railway-station in its garden. Eventually the path disappeared
altogether. We cantered over a grass slope, through the main street
of Dongtse, and up a precipice to the monastery. As we did so, G.
and M. appeared in the plain beneath. The rain, for the moment, had
stopped.</p>

<p>Before the usual complex of buildings, with their cornices of
crimson velvet and flashing brass pinnacles, monks stood waiting to
welcome us, robed in serge the colour of dried blood. From below
came the inevitable shouts and songs of threshers as they drove the
bullocks through the flying corn. In the distance over the plain we
could see the Gyantse Jong. The monks conducted us into the temple,
where others were seated in rows on the long cushions, each
enveloped in a yellow cope. Two tables were set with lidded cups
and seats of honour made ready. But the smell of butter was
overpowering, and, after showing our appreciation of the honour
done us, we begged that the tables might be removed to an adjoining
balcony where we could eat our picnic at greater leisure. The cold
was fearful, despite the shelter of a yak-hair curtain; but it was
preferable to the odour of butter. After lunch we were taken
upstairs to see a small room painted with the incarnations of the
various abbots of the monastery. The last of those thus
commemorated had been executed by order from Lhassa, for having
sheltered one of the Indian surveyors who traversed Tibet in
disguise at the end of the last century.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Bell, in one of his books on Tibet, has illustrated
the country-house of the Palha family, which stands at Dongtse. The
picture having aroused my interest, I wished to see this house. As
always happens on such occasions, my innocent desire roused a
chorus of opposition. Pemba asserted that the house did not exist.
G. said that, judging by its picture, he would much rather not see
it. I then insisted that Pemba should ask the monks where it was.
Just below the monastery, was the answer. So eventually we did find
it, and very interesting, to me at least, it proved. The courtyard
was surrounded on three sides by a double cloister supported on old
gnarled timbers, whose upper gallery was entirely filled with row
upon row of prayer-wheels resembling enormous empty cotton-reels.
The fourth side, which lay close beneath the hill, was occupied by
the house, an upstanding construction of five storeys, whose
windows and galleries reminded me of a London inn in the time of
Dickens. These features made little appeal to G., who asks Blenheim
or nothing of every house. I therefore climbed on to the roof of
the cloister, out of earshot of his grumblings, and took
photographs.</p>

<p>It rained all the way back. The ponies were out of patience, and
there was no holding them. We felt tired and stiff when we
dismounted at the rest-house just before dark. Poor Pemba could
hardly walk. Blood came to dinner, bringing a bottle of
<i>cr&egrave;me de menthe</i> to celebrate our last evening. We
talked of the British in India, and he displayed that tolerance and
understanding which is always found among the officers of Indian
regiments and never among the merchant communities of Calcutta and
Bombay. I wished I could have stayed on to keep him company. We had
been very happy in Gyantse. But the weather of the last two days
had shown that the winter was upon us, and we had no desire for a
more uncomfortable passage of the Himalayas than was necessary.</p>

<p>We awoke to our last morning with feelings of acute depression.
It was Sunday, we remembered, and felt like it, even here. But
there was no time to grieve. For further social duties awaited us.
M. and I had not yet finished breakfast when Pemba, who had been
keeping a lookout, rushed in to say that Rajah Tehring was at the
gates. The beds were not made; we had run out of tea. But by a hint
of Providence&mdash;or possibly of Pemba&mdash;he sensed our
predicament and went off to visit his second son near-by, with whom
he reappeared an hour later. He wore a purple silk robe, a
sleeveless purple velvet jacket over it, and a hat of the familiar
mandarin pattern having an upturned brim of mole-coloured velvet,
through which, at the back, fell a scarlet tassel. This was his
official hat, denoting the rank accorded him in Lhassa.</p>

<p>He drank tea, ate with some difficulty a biscuit covered with
butter and marmalade, and presented us with a very large and
honourable white scarf and a pretty carpet from his own looms We
talked of Lhassa. He said that owing to his British
connection&mdash;for his title of Rajah had been granted him
officially by the Indian Government&mdash;he was never entrusted
with administrative work. But he had to go every year to Lhassa to
pay his respects to the Dalai Lama, and he enjoyed himself during
these visits. He always stayed with his married daughter. The food
was of the best, there were lots of festivals and theatricals, and
frequently private parties took place which lasted all night. It
was evident from this account, and from much else we heard, that
the amenities of Tibetan life can only be fully savoured in the
capital.</p>

<p>When the Rajah had taken his leave we busied ourselves with
packing, before going out to a last lunch-party, for which we were
engaged with Tuksa, the host of the wedding feast that had
enlivened our first day in the town. The old man and his son met
us, not at the door as formerly, but outside the courtyard, thereby
doing us great honour. The party was assembled in the room
containing the brass cabinet previously described. It consisted of
about twenty people, all men, the cream of local society. Beneath
the window, occupying the place of honour, was the Kenchung dressed
in orange brocade. On his right sat the Jongpen, wearing a jacket
of sapphire blue over a robe of greenish yellow. Facing the
Kenchung was the postmaster, a pot-bellied, pig-tailed personage in
dingy maroon. On the Kenchung's left sat a rich trader, whose
top-knot, tied with red, meant that he was ripe for promotion to
officialdom. These persons, who formed the main group, were playing
a variant of mah-jong which seemed to resemble bridge, though there
were sixteen pieces to a suit. Loud shouts greeted the trumping of
an opponent, and heaps of Tibetan money, in the form of coarse
copper coins and bank-notes imprinted with a woodcut lion, passed
between the players. The Jongpen, I noticed, had wrapped his legs
in a purple rug. The Kenchung, on the other hand, had discarded a
coat of maroon silk woven with gold roundels and lined with red
hearth-mat.</p>

<p>The splendour of such garments, which was reflected in greater
or less degree by all those present except ourselves, gave the
party an air of ceremonious gaiety. Our host was dressed in woollen
cloth of the very finest texture, deep green in colour, and tied
with a scarlet sash. His son, whose hair was also twisted with red
ribbon, wore a robe of buff brocade tied with a yellow sash.
Beneath this showed high soft boots of untanned leather, heavily
tooled in a darker pattern. The two of them led us up to the
principal guests, with whom we shook hands, then placed us at a
separate table at the end of the room. The remaining members of the
party were ranged at other tables along the wall opposite the
window, and were also gambling.</p>

<p><i>Chang</i> was served immediately on our arrival by the same
serving-women, from whom detached herself the same frowning hussy
that had stood over me before and was now more determined than ever
that I should drink my fill. We slipped away, and nibbled at dried
fruits, until a stir in the doorway announced the beginning of the
largest meal I have ever been privileged to eat.</p>

<p>The art of eating, as perfected by the Chinese and adopted by
the Tibetans, differs radically from the same art as practised in
Europe. With us the dimensions and contents of the meal are
carefully worked out beforehand; the guest is treated to a finished
masterpiece, in whose composition he himself plays little or no
part. According to Celestial custom it is the guest who makes the
design, out of the materials laid before him. There are no pauses;
when one series of bowls is removed, not ten seconds elapse before
the next is on the table. There are no drinks either. Consequently
eating is incessant and is impelled, apart from pure greed, by the
curiosity attaching to so many varieties of food. The chopsticks
fly from one to another in endless change, and suddenly, at the end
of the meal, some of the earlier courses are repeated, so that one
may taste again what was most excellent at the beginning. In the
present instance we sat for more than two hours, during which the
process of mastication did not cease for one minute. The menu, as
far as our joint memory could afterwards recall it, was as follows:
monkey-nuts and other nuts, sardines which we ourselves had brought
as a present, a chopped vegetable, like celery, with bits of meat,
Chinese shrimps, meat balls, meat mixed with walnut that tasted
like <i>marrons glac&eacute;s,</i> mutton, curried meat, sweet rice
and sultanas, sultanas and candy sugar, doughnuts containing a
sweet brown syrup, dough-balls, seaweed too delicious to describe,
various other vegetables of hard consistency, bamboo roots, meat
with <i>sauerkraut,</i> cabbage, mushrooms, small sea-slugs with
mushrooms, large sea-slugs without, four kinds of fish tripe, of
which one was unpleasantly spongy, shark's stomach, pease gelatine,
and liver or kidney. Then followed, to wash it all down, the usual
two kinds of tea and glasses of <i>cr&egrave;me de menthe.</i>.</p>

<p>Throughout this gargantuan repast we were accompanied at our
table by the son of the house and also by a person of enormous
proportions with a Hindenburg moustache, named Nishup, who was
reputed to be the richest man in Gyantse. This reputation he
enhanced by wearing on one hand a ruby, and on the other a
sapphire, each more than half an inch across. Though light in
colour and full of flaws, they gave him a magnificent air. Just as
we were about to ask the same question of him, he asked us how much
we thought they were worth.</p>

<p>Nishup did not eat much, and G. would fain know why. He said he
could not bear to feel his stomach growing. G., whose knowledge of
Buddhist lore is no less than his knowledge of everything else,
replied that he had always understood the stomach to be the seat of
all wisdom. This remark, when translated, sent the whole room into
a roar of laughter. Nishup, incorrigibly material, repeated that a
big stomach was uncomfortable, and that was enough for him. Pemba,
through whom this conversation was conducted, then informed us
that, when alone, all Tibetans eat six times as much as they do at
parties. We could only be surprised that any of them should be able
to move at all.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the women reappeared with <i>chang,</i> and we
remembered that we had to reach Saugong, fifteen miles away, before
dusk. The luggage had gone on. Blood's ponies were to carry us once
more on this our first stage of the journey down to India. After
sad good-byes to him and Pemba, whose joint sponsorship had enabled
us to see far more of Tibetan life than would otherwise have been
possible, we set off at a sharp canter. Twilight fell quickly. For
the last four miles we went at full gallop. By half-past five, when
we reached the rest-house, it was actually dark, and the servants
were waiting with lanterns to guide us indoors.</p>

<p>Looking back on Gyantse now, I realize what a precious glimpse
that week gave us of a way of life which the world has nowhere else
preserved. In European parlance it is a medieval way of life, a
stage through which we ourselves have passed long ago, but from
which, nevertheless, the roots of our tradition still draw much of
their strength. How soon Western materialism will penetrate the
barriers so far successfully maintained, no one can tell. From
Nepal on the south and China on the west the menace of forcible
invasion is ever alive, and has twice since our visit reached such
a point of danger that British mediation has been called for.
Except by an army trained and munitioned on Western lines, to which
the ruling hierarchy is bitterly opposed, it is difficult to see
how this menace can be permanently warded off. To a country,
moreover, where justice is cruel and secret, disease rife, and
independent thought impossible, Western ideas might bring some
benefits. But could the benefits outweigh the disadvantages? In the
present state of Western civilization, whose spiritual emptiness in
relation to Asia is masked by a brutal assumption of moral
superiority, it seems to me that they could not. I prefer to hope
that the life we saw at Gyantse will endure, and wish Tibet luck in
her isolation, until such time as the West itself is reformed and
can commend its ideas with greater reason to those who have
hitherto escaped them.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-8"></a>VIII. WINTER COMES EARLY</h3>

<p>Everyone had prophesied snow for us, and we had left Gyantse
expecting to ride into it, since the clouds were lying thick over
the Saugong Valley and the hill-tops were already white. As for the
passes into India, the Jelep and the Nathu, Pemba had heard rumours
of a fall of six feet on them. For the moment, however, we awoke to
a cloudless sky and bright sunshine. But the wind was bitter cold,
and as a precaution against it we each assumed a green silk mask
with worked eye-holes that had been purchased in the bazaar at
Gyantse. The precaution was probably unnecessary at this stage of
the journey, since it was the coincidence of snow on the ground
with wind and sun that was really to be feared. But after the
miseries of the journey up we were taking no risks; and we
certainly met Tibetans similarly masked. Besides these ghoulish
protections, we had also furnished ourselves with whips, which now
enabled us to cover the stage between Saugong and Khangma, a
distance of fifteen miles, in two and a half hours. Even so, an
unreasoning depression, which seems inseparable from travel in
Tibet, began to settle on us. After a walk up the Khangma valley,
where I watched a toddling infant sending stones from a knitted
sling as far as a drive at golf, my head began to feel peculiar
again. I therefore retired to bed at a quarter-past two.</p>

<p>A couple of empirin tablets had put me right by the next
morning, and I enjoyed a leisurely ride to Samoda. On the way I
stopped at the Dekz&uuml; monastery, which was in course of
reconstruction. It was here that I observed the process of
cornice-making by means of dyed twigs. A courteous gentleman with a
fine ear-ring appeared on the scene and, though somewhat astonished
at my mask and goggles, showed me over the temple. There were no
monks about. He alone seemed to be superintending the work in hand.
I rode by myself that day, and on reaching the rest-house at Samoda
I plucked up my Tibetan to ask for a <i>sh&ouml;n ya</i>&mdash; in
other words, a riding yak. A brute was fetched from a near-by
field, on which I perched myself in miraculous discomfort, flinging
the yak-hair rein attached to its nostrils from horn to horn in an
unsuccessful effort to steer it where I wished to go. Its home, I
learned afterwards, was in the opposite direction, on the farther
side of a mountain range; and when eventually I let it go in that
direction, it set off at a lumbering trot. After a time I tried to
turn it, on which it showed resentment by twisting its head and
butting my boots. I managed to regain the rest-house in the end,
just as the others arrived, who displayed some surprise at seeing
me thus gratuitously sampling yet another exigency of Tibetan
travel.</p>

<p>From Samoda we had planned a double stage to Dochen, twenty-six
miles. Again I rode alone, rising gently through seven miles of
rocky valleys, till I emerged on to the Kala plain which stretched
another seven miles before me. Across this immense solitude, silent
and awesome within its rampart of snow-girdled peaks, was
proceeding a herd of seven wild ass, tawny-coloured, with white
legs that moved in step like the tights of a chorus in musical
comedy. My pony, after its rest in Gyantse, was in fine form and
chased the absurd troupe. Then, seeing that the whole plain
contained but one single stone, it galloped three miles like an
arrow from the bow in order to annoy me by tripping over it. At
midday we lunched in the Kala rest-house, and immediately
afterwards entered the Kala gorge. As this continued, to bring us
out on the shores of Lake Dochen, the whole range of Chomolhari
came gradually into view, peak after peak, glassy bright under new
snow, in contrast with the leaden waters of the lake, whose sullen,
wind-ruffled surface was threatening to freeze as we looked. Flocks
of duck were still swimming, in the vain hope of averting this
contingency, and two pairs of black-backed crane were pacing
anxiously to and fro in the shallows at the margin. I followed one
of them. At first the birds marched one after the other in rigid
step, separated by a distance of twenty yards. Then, as my pace
quickened, theirs quickened also, till suddenly one wheeled about
and they continued to march in different directions, still in step,
like sentries changing guard.</p>

<p>Being now well over 14,000 feet, we had reached the snow at
last, which lay from eight inches to a foot deep, and, being
freshly fallen, necessitated our finding the path for ourselves. G.
acted as pioneer and led us unerringly to the Dochen rest-house.
The sun was setting as we rode. Over the lake the sky became
suffused with a luminous greenish blue, a marvel of colour, distant
and unearthly, such as one could imagine of inter-planetary space.
In front of this the frigid peaks stood out in greater relief than
before, with cold, pure blue shadows on their eastern faces and
their western bathed in a light of soft yellow. Between each hung
clouds in delicate suspense, impalpable as tulle gauze and radiant
with the same yellow glow. Below spread the lake, dark, deep, and
sinister, though its leaden frown was bluer now. From its edge to
the rest-house the virgin snow was interrupted only by a squat
cabin and some nearer mounds of yak-dung. Over to the left appeared
a lower range, where the snow had not lain, and which now stood out
the colour of a faded rose-petal against the green behind. The wind
had dropped and silence reigned over the scene, so tense, so
inviolable, that it struck the ear like a message from the
stars.</p>

<p>With a jangle of bells the mules arrived as dusk merged into
darkness. The servants had got it into their heads that we were
making for Phari, thirty-six miles away, next day, and were
determined to prevent any such thing. The wire was tapped here, and
Ah-Chung rushed to the telephone, on which he learned that, though
the mail from the north had got through to Phari that day, from
Phari to Gautsa in the Chumbi Valley the road was completely
blocked. M. was depressed by this news; he suggested summoning 150
yaks to clear the road before our arrival. But a glass or two of
hot rum made the prospect of being marooned in Tibet for the winter
seem more romantic than tragic. There was still some of Blood's
<i>cr&egrave;me de menthe</i> left for dinner, and the rest-house
contained three volumes of <i>Punch.</i> In fact the evening
finished in a happier mood than most.</p>

<p>There were no blue skies when we looked out next morning, no
mountains even&mdash;they had vanished behind an iron curtain of
cloud whose downward streaks proclaimed a snowstorm on the other
side of the lake. A fearful cold hung in the air. I put on seven
thicknesses of clothes. We tried to telephone to Phari again, but
by now the line was out of order. Then, as by a miracle, the sun
fought its way through and the clouds began to disperse. One by one
the satellites of Chomolhari reappeared, gleaming blue and brown
and white, till the fantastic cone of their chief was visible and
the whole range was reflected in the glacial tranquillity of the
lake beneath. To the right, against the sun, flashed a crumpled
sheaf of blue crystals, which we took to be Kanchenjunga. In front
of us the untraversed plain shone white as a new-laid tablecloth
and dazzling even through a pair of smelter's glasses. To the naked
eye it was impossible, painful, even for a minute. There had been a
wind in the night, so that the snow varied in depth from two feet
to two inches. Any mound of eminence was almost bare; some of the
lower hills were striped with drifts like huge giraffes. We had not
far to go to Tuna, but progress under such conditions was slow. As
the sun rose to its full height we could feel the snow-glare
burning through our masks. Another herd of wild ass appeared on the
horizon; this time there was no chasing them. By the time we
reached the rest-house the afternoon was well advanced. Chomolhari
was nearer now, and the sunset more spectacular even than that of
the previous day.</p>

<p>We left Tuna at eight o'clock in the morning. The snow was
thicker, and we had to go on top of it, following a path nine
inches wide which had been made by yaks in single file. This had
frozen in the night and was hard enough to prevent us sinking
through. But the gait of the yak differs widely from that of the
pony, so that the feet of the latter cannot, and did not, coincide
with the footmarks left by the former. Since the path consisted
entirely of these footmarks in all their separate inconvenience,
our mounts had to feel their every step, and even then threatened
to collapse with legs crossed at one in every four. We thus made an
average pace of one and a half miles an hour. On our left
Chomolhari grew eternally more imminent, till its furious
escarpments seemed to threaten our destruction. At the rest-house
below the Tang La I waited for the mules to come up, and fished
another sweater from my luggage. The sun had gone in again, and a
wind had got up which cut through my seven coverings like a
razor.</p>

<p>The ascent to the Tang La is gentler than can be expected of a
pass over 15,000 feet above sea-level. But it seemed like an arctic
hell as I plodded in the wake of G. and M., two tiny black specks
above me in a world of white. The snow grew deeper and deeper.
Traffic was coming through from Phari now, and if one left the path
the pony would flounder up to its belly and soon become immovable.
There was nothing for it but to take a whip to the oncoming beasts
and drive them, and their owners with them, out of the road. On in
front, M. was unhorsed by two yaks simultaneously. Behind me our
caravan was in difficulties, and the mules began to lie down. But I
rode oblivious of these incidents, concentrating only on my own
progress. A flock of sheep, going the same way as myself, proved
almost impassable. When I reached the top, my mask, wet with
breathing, froze into a sheet of green silk ice. Dead animals were
frequent. A trail of blood led to a mangled donkey, at which a
black mastiff was already busy. At last the Phari Jong could be
seen on the horizon, a small blue silhouette against the white
outline of the Himalayas. I passed through a village, whose natural
filth was made more evident by its white mantle stained with blood
and urine. The streets of Phari, when I reached them, were equally
disgusting. At the rest-house I found that M. had developed a pain
in his inside. He dared not take a pill, he said, owing to the long
journey on the morrow. To-day we had come twenty-one miles and were
as tired as we could be.</p>

<p>Two moths, a clump of Michaelmas daisies, and a pat of yak-dung
fell out of the jug with my washing-water. We had planned to be
called at six, but did not get off till eight, and even then the
mules had not started. As the plain sloped downward to the head of
the Chumbi Valley the snow grew steadily deeper. It was only
yesterday that the first animals had come through, after a week's
blockade. Out of the mist loomed black herds of yak, some of them
laden, while from the backs of one or two fluttered pennants
mounted on poles&mdash;presumably prayer-flags. The marmots had
come up through the snow and squatted in hundreds at their circular
entrances.</p>

<p>At last the sides of hills were visible and the slope between
them became a descent. The Chumbi Valley was beginning. The
mountains closed in and the path became once more a twisting narrow
ledge, which recalled vivid memories of the journey up and the
anxious uncertainty that had attended this stage of it. Giant
slopes obliterated the sky, beneath which the human being suffered
incredible diminution. It is not my habit to moralize on the
smallness of man. But the Himalayas do induce a sense of it. They
are out of scale to a degree which evokes something like
fear&mdash;the sort of feeling, I imagine, that might beset one in
the depths of the ocean, however safe the submarine. Then a tree
came to comfort us, the first for a week, a friendly little
rhododendron bush, three feet high. Conifers followed, gaunt and
rugged like a veteran army, whose black, snow-spattered silhouettes
maintained their precarious footing up the white towers of rock.
Below rushed the river in tremendous volume, making the best of its
last freedom before the spring. Already the intervening boulders
were fringed all round with icicles, and being covered on top with
snow as well, resembled settees upholstered in a ruched white
chintz. Vast avalanches had left their dirty smears on the opposing
slopes, damming the waters in the bottom and filling our path, if
they had crossed it, with mounds of loose cannon balls over which
the ponies picked their way with sage deliberation. It was no
wonder that the soldier who was carried back to hospital the week
before had been unable to get through to Phari.</p>

<p>Rounding a corner, I met a party of monks whose red robes, tall
yellow hats, and goggled yellow masks seemed the natural uniform
for this outlandish world. The leader of them swung a prayer-wheel
as he walked. Farther on I espied two men busy on their knees at
the riverbank. A couple of mules stood tethered beside them, and a
number of ravens were hopping about. I was wondering what they were
up to, when suddenly one of them brandished a bloody limb at me.
They were cutting up a body, which I took to be a human one, since
it seemed an inconvenient spot for the butchery of an animal, and
the dead are always thus disposed of in Tibet. Then Gautsa came in
sight, where we met our acquaintances of the journey up, the doctor
and McLeod. They told us that the recent snowfall had been one of
the heaviest on record.</p>

<p>Here we lunched hurriedly, for it was growing late. Thereafter
the trees stood about the path in thick woods, which seemed
hospitable after the arid wastes of the plateau. Tibet was already
remote; the excursion of the last three weeks had become detached
as an experience outside the normal course. The larches were still
gold. But for them the autumn colours had been sogged away.
Cataclysms of earth and stones had altered the very landscape. In
one place a whole clump of trees had come rushing down the
mountainside to land upright on the path, so at first, not
realizing what had happened and remembering the spot as it had
been, I was at a loss to understand why my path should suddenly
vanish in a small wood. My pony was less tired than the others, and
I rode ahead, for the sun was setting and we still had ten miles to
go. As twilight deepened I quickened my pace, cantering
helter-skelter down the uneven path, over the boulders and down the
beds of streams, past the ruined Chinese barracks, till at
half-past five, when it was actually quite dark, I reached the
outskirts of Yatung and begged the first man I met to direct me to
the rest-house. At first he did not understand. I bellowed the word
<i>dunkang</i> in every key my voice could devise. Eventually
comprehension dawned, and he sent me over the bridge and up the
opposite hill, where I found the caretaker waiting on the
threshold. To him, by signs, I explained that the others were
coming, and persuaded him to send out a lantern to meet them. He
rose to the occasion, and when the others did arrive, half an hour
later, cooked us an excellent dinner out of his own resources,
which consisted of an omelette and some roast yak. Another lantern
was despatched to meet the mules, which did not get in till
half-past eight, after a march of twelve hours without a stop.</p>

<p>It had been a tiring day, altogether a tiring week. We were glad
to spend the next morning in idleness, browsing over the various
batches of letters that had been waiting for us here. I was glad to
see that, if size of type were any criterion, the <i>Daily
Express</i> had considered my articles on the flight to India of
some value. Later we visited Smith, the Trade Agent, at his
official residence on the other side of the valley, the usual
Anglo-Himalayan chalet, roofed in red corrugated iron and sporting
a tenuous Union Jack. The place was not without amenities. A few
roses were still flowering in the garden, and there had been
sweet-peas till the snow came. The servants wore purple skirts, in
the Chinese fashion, and short scarlet jackets in the English.
Smith was just setting off for Gangtok, like ourselves. We promised
to catch him up that evening.</p>

<p>A band, whose members wore spangled masks adorned with
aigrettes, greeted us on our return to the rest-house. Just as we
were leaving, having enjoyed a protracted and soporific lunch,
another musician arrived by himself, bearing a magnificent green
and gold banjo, which I purchased on the spot for ten rupees. This
object my unfortunate groom was obliged to carry for the rest of
the journey. But I felt less compunction at thus burdening him than
might have been expected, since several of the other servants had
bought themselves Lhassa terriers in Gyantse, which they intended
to sell in India, and to carry which across the snow-covered plains
they had even been able to afford servants of their own.</p>

<p>To reach Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, and also for the
pleasure of taking a different route, we had decided to cross the
Himalayas by the Nathu instead of the Jelep La. After a few miles
along the Chumbi Valley, we turned up the hills to the right,
leaving the telegraph-posts for the first time since our journey
had begun. The path climbed steeply and was disconcertingly narrow,
winding its way along a terrific semicircular precipice over which
a mule had fallen only a few moments before our advent. We could
see the poor brute in the bottom, as the vultures came wheeling
down like baroque aeroplanes; its ribs were already bare. Then we
rode into a cloud, and the forked valley, with its silver thread of
river twisting away on its passage to Bhutan, was blotted out.
Suddenly a small monastery loomed out of the mist, perched on an
isolated ledge. Its roof, but for a gold cupola, was made of
flattened kerosene tins painted red. Yet so neatly was this done
that the effect was not incongruous. As we passed the entrance, a
monk ran out, beckoning to us to stop. But we had no time. The
phantom building receded below us. Then, suddenly, a trumpet rang
out, one of those twenty-foot instruments of lamaic ritual. Vainly
it called, echoing over hidden valleys and rebounding from peak to
peak, as though to inform us, in our cloud-swathed blindness, of
heights unscaled and recesses unimagined. Another blast, fainter
now, caught up the long-drawn phrase; and then a third, hard on the
second, so that the echoes crossed and recrossed and the very mist
was alive with distant sound. The trumpet rang no more. With
infinite reluctance, seeking a last survival in farther and farther
ranges, the sound died away. We climbed onward through the trees,
knowing, each in his own mind, that Tibet had spoken her
farewell.</p>

<p>We were now in the snow again. The going was the worst we had
encountered, and the fact that we could not see them in no way
mitigated the depths of the precipice below us. Landslides and
fallen trees blocked the path at every turn. At the best it was
scarcely a yard wide. Occasionally there were bridges, grotesque
structures like heaps of tumbled spelicans, through which the
ponies' legs might slip and dangle above unfathomable glissades.
Cascades of snow fell from the trees, finding their way down our
necks and into our boots. A lugubrious moisture, half sleet, half
rain, oozed from the impenetrable cloud. The cold was intense. The
approach of night added to the gloom of the black and dripping
trees. It was with some relief that we reached the tiny rest-house
of Champithang, to find Smith installed, with the lamps lit and a
wood fire roaring in the grate.</p>

<p>Next morning we made an early start. Smith, a man of generous
physique, was mounted on a sleek black mule. My pony, I felt, was
gradually turning into a mule with all this mountaineering. Its
ears began to lengthen at every obstacle. There had been a fresh
fall of snow in the night. But for the moment the sun was shining
and the battered, flat-topped silver firs, festooned with long
trailers of lichen like tinsel on a Christmas-tree, glittered
brightly against the black depths of wooded valleys. At length we
passed the tree-line and were faced by a white wall of
mountain&mdash;the approach to the pass. Simultaneously the clouds
descended. A blizzard enveloped us. It became impossible to see
more than a few yards. There was nothing to indicate the path. We
could only continue upwards and trust that the invisible abysses
now lurking in our imagination did not exist.</p>

<p>In the midst of this blind progress my pony lurched forward,
tipping me headlong into a drift as high as my chest. M.'s pony,
just behind, lurched backward into another, and he slid off over
the tail. We dragged the ponies out, remounted, and waited for it
to happen again, which it did immediately. There was nothing for it
but to walk. Normal kindness would have prompted such a course, it
may be thought; but it is none too easy to struggle up a steep
slope in the rarefied air of 14,000 feet at the best of times; and
when, in addition, one had to contend with snow up to the thighs
and sometimes the waist, a vast weight of clothing, a frozen mask
which impeded respiration already difficult enough, and complete
loss of all direction, there were moments when it seemed as though
we might have to postpone our return to India to another day. After
every three or four steps it was necessary to stop and rest; on
which the ponies would sink in up to the saddle again, and a
further effort would be needed to pull them out before bracing
oneself for another spurt. At one moment a gleam of hope
materialized in the form of some footsteps ahead of us. I followed
them as quickly as I could, and the going had just begun to seem a
little easier, as though their maker knew where the path was, when
I came on him seated behind a rock&mdash;a solitary mumbling idiot,
whom no gestures of mine could induce to move another step. By this
time the slope had become almost perpendicular, and we judged it
best to wait for Smith, in case he, by instinct or experience,
should know the way. But he did not; neither did his chief Tibetan
clerk, whose usual calm was sadly deranged by our predicament. This
personage, whose single ear-ring and jacket of piebald fur still
lent him an air of authority, hazarded the suggestion that we were
within four hundred yards of the top. Whether without further
assistance we should ever have completed that four hundred yards is
a doubtful point. But, as though by a miracle, assistance came.
Smith was for going back, M. was undecided, and I was for making a
last try, when out of the blizzard far above us came a shout. Our
men answered. The shouts were repeated from above. And by dint of
this unison a junction was effected between our servants and the
drivers of an equally bewildered caravan from the south. Even the
idiot was stirred to activity and took my pony, as we hoisted
ourselves up the last rock-face, so steep that little snow could
lie on it, and at length stood upright again on the narrow edge of
the pass. I was glad of his help, for my groom, laden with the
banjo, had got left behind.</p>

<p>Thus we crossed the frontier of Tibet and, stepping into the
tracks of the mule-train, descended into India.</p>

<p>The path was now a proper path, decently cobbled and graded.
After walking about a mile the snow decreased and we were able to
remount. The ride was enlivened by various game&mdash;a covey of
ptarmigan, another of snow-partridges, said to be rare, and a
single deer. A couple of martens were playing on a rock. Also we
saw a monal pheasant, most magnificent of the Himalayan birds,
which got up at our feet and sailed away into the mist across a
bottomless valley, a vision of purple and copper. We reached the
rest-house of Changu early in the afternoon, and there parted from
Smith, who was due to make another stage before dusk. Our own mules
were still tired after the long journey from Phari to Yatung, and
we thought it best to spare them as much as possible.</p>

<p>Changu lies by a lake which hangs precariously among the
mountain-tops, with a slender dam at one end, whence pours a
waterfall. The Maharajah of Sikkim has a boat-house here. I rode
out before breakfast, after being nearly overwhelmed by an
avalanche of snow from the roof of the rest-house, and discovered
the pods of a poppy which I hoped might be a blue one; but it was
not. The day, we had decided, should be devoted to botanizing, in
the interests of M. Our next stage would take us down from 12,000
to 9,000 feet. It began with conifers, interspersed with
innumerable kinds of rhododendron and azalea whose leaves varied in
length from a foot to half an inch. Then bamboos intervened, huge
feathery clumps of light green, and maples, brilliant yellow and
brilliant red. Already, despite the yawning cloud-filled valleys
that unfolded at every turn, there was a feeling of luxuriance,
such as the Chumbi Valley does not possess, an oppressive feeling,
as though the moisture were too abundant and the soil too rich for
a rational plant life.</p>

<p>I was riding in meditative mood, when up the path came Ward, a
soldier friend from Calcutta, with a friend of his behind him.
Their comparatively clean appearance made me conscious of our own
unkemptness. They were going up to Changu in the hopes of getting a
shot at a monal pheasant, and were interested to hear we had seen
one. On reaching Karponang, where the new-built rest-house seemed
like a palace, we all shaved, and, like Samson at the loss of his
locks, I was filled of a sudden with tragic lassitude. Our journey
was nearly over. Next morning M. and I went on ahead. Some of the
orchids were in flower, single mauve ones in the clefts of trees,
and clusters of small coffee-coloured blooms pendant from the
higher branches. From four miles away a square temple roof on a
wooded spur proclaimed the imminence of Gangtok. We cantered down
the well-made path, and at the entrance to the town found a
<i>chuprassi</i> awaiting us to lead us to the Residency. He wore a
Lepcha uniform, a scarlet coat, a skirt, and a straw top-hat of
<i>Directoire</i> shape with a peacock's feather in it. In the
garden, as we ambled up the drive, Mrs Weir was picking flowers.
Colonel Weir was on the doorstep, with Smith behind him. Glasses of
beer were handed on a tray, and we found ourselves, after what
seemed like an eternity of the unfamiliar, in a normal house.</p>

<p>I cannot speak fondly enough of Colonel and Mrs Weir's
hospitality to us. By them, accustomed to travel in Tibet, our
little excursion was hardly to be taken as a serious journey. Yet
Mrs Weir had anticipated the pleasure we should feel at our return
to civilization, and no amenity she could provide was lacking for
our comfort and entertainment. That year they had been invited to
visit Lhassa and had arrived within about eighty miles of the place
when, to their great disappointment, the invitation was cancelled.
They were now wondering whether the opportunity would come again. I
am glad to say that it did come, not once but twice. Diplomacy
moves slowly in the Tibetan capital. Altogether they must have
spent more than a year there. Mrs Weir is not only an observer but
an artist of considerable attainment. If and when the time comes
for them to make public the fruits of their two missions, our
knowledge of the least-known city in the world will be considerably
increased.</p>

<p>That evening Sir Abdul Karim Ghuznavi, a member of the
Governor's Council of Bengal, came to stay, having done eighteen
miles by car at an average pace of three miles an hour. On the
following morning we all trooped down to the Palace to pay our
respects to the Maharajah. The Palace, which had just been newly
pointed, resembled a dolls'-house of the seaside villa pattern. The
private secretary, dressed in green silk, met us in the drive. The
Maharajah, dressed in sky-blue brocade, was waiting on the
threshold, a charming little man in smoked spectacles, with a
gentle musical voice. His drawing-room, thanks to the taste of Mrs
Weir and of Mrs Bailey her predecessor, contained none of those
monstrous objects with which Oriental potentates in general seek to
create a European <i>ensemble</i> for the delectation of their
guests. Apart from some carved and gilt tables of local make, the
furniture and atmosphere might have belonged to some pleasant
English country-house. The Maharajah complained of his wireless
set, which could only get Calcutta. He had ordered a bigger. He
also complained of the difficulty he experienced in leaving his
front gate, owing to an adverse spirit which lived in a tree beside
it. We gave him a message of regard from Rajah Tehring, at
which&mdash;or was it our imagination?&mdash;he seemed rather
displeased. At length he took us out to see the temple on the point
of the spur. In front of it lay an open space which had been
levelled for the erection of a new palace. I had a
side-conversation with the private secretary, who promised to
procure me a couple of dancer's masks. Sir Abdul Karim played the
heavy politician, exhorting the Maharajah to develop his mineral
resources.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the royal party came to tea, headed by the
Rimpoch&eacute;, a twinkling monk wearing a yellow hat like a
pagoda, whose holiness was such that the servants fell on their
knees at his white clogs. The Maharanee came also. They arrived on
richly caparisoned ponies. Despite their affability, it was a
difficult meal. Dinner I found still more difficult. For my
stomach, which had been uttering certain warnings for the past day
or two, now refused to assimilate any more food whatsoever, and I
was obliged to rush from the room. The following morning, after I
had been dosed with castor oil, we took leave of the Weirs, whom we
were later to see again both in Calcutta and London, and rode down
to Pakyang. And on the day after, which was 2 November, reached
Rungpo, where a car was waiting for us. Here we lunched among
sweet-smelling shrubs, bathed in the river, and said good-bye to
the servants, than whom none could have been more dutiful and
efficient. A year or two later I saw Ah-Chung's photograph in
<i>The Times.</i> He had been acting as cook to the Kamet
Expedition.</p>

<p>A good road took us to Siliguri. Once more the Bengal plain
spread out before us. There were three hours to wait for the train.
We ordered a bottle of burgundy in the station restaurant. This, on
being opened, emitted a light orange liquid. We sent for the
manager. It was burgundy for all he knew; but there was no need for
us to pay for it if <i>we</i> thought differently. We then ordered
claret, port, and kummel instead. After a comfortable night in the
train we reached Calcutta for breakfast. It was a luxurious meal.
Central Asia had become a dream.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="ch2-9"></a>IX. A TIBETAN PILGRIMAGE</h3>

<p>Jigmed and Mary, who had left Tehring the day we went to
Dongtse, had a difficult journey to India. They had intended to
cross into Sikkim direct from Kampa Jong. But the pass of their
choice, which is over 17,000 feet high, was completely blocked by
the same snowfall as had so hindered ourselves. And after a very
unpleasant night in the crudest of shelters they were forced to
turn back, eventually rejoining the trade route at Tuna. At
Kalimpong they spent a few days with their old friend Mr Macdonald,
and thence came down to Calcutta, where with some difficulty I
found them, occupying a balcony at the top of that Chinese
caravanserai which had previously supplied us with ceremonial
scarves. The ostensible reason for their trip was a pilgrimage to
Buddh Gaya. But for the moment they were employed in tasting the
pleasure of a Western city. In this I could be of some help; after
which, perhaps, I might ask them to allow me to come on the
pilgrimage too.</p>

<p>The following night, therefore, we dined at Firpo's, where the
entry of a Tibetan couple in full regalia caused a stir of surprise
and&mdash;as far as I was concerned&mdash;of disapproval. To
consort with Indians was bad enough; for these outlandish folk,
celestially brocaded, there could be no excuse. I gave them
champagne, whose flavour, to my mortification, reminded them of
<i>chang.</i> Thus primed, we went to the theatre. It was a gala
performance, the first night of <i>Journey's End.</i> The Governor
was in his box and everyone else in the stalls. I was interested to
see this play; but its significance, in my mind, was
disproportionately exaggerated by the company of two people who
knew no more of the war than we do of famines in China. The
dialogue proved unintelligible to them, and they were further
mystified by the bursting shells. Yet by some abstruse instinct
they appreciated the humour of the cockney cook. On the whole the
evening was a success.</p>

<p>The next thing was to get them to lunch at Government House.
This I accomplished, after taking them to write their names in the
book, through the offices of a friendly ADC. 'I think,' said the
ADC to the Military Secretary, 'it is politically important to have
them.' 'I think,' said the Military Secretary to the Governor, 'it
is politically important to have them.' So had they were, and
enjoyed it. They also lunched with me at the flat I had been lent,
and complimented me on the banjo I had bought at Yatung. It was of
an old Lhassa type, they said, very uncommon, and the price I had
paid was small, even by Tibetan standards.</p>

<p>Besides pleasure, they had certain business to transact. Two
servants from Lhassa had been sent down with them, one of whom
could not stop laughing, owing to the fact, apparently, that he had
once been a rich man and had gambled away his inheritance. These
were to be sent by ship to China in order to buy silks and brocades
requisite for the strictly prescribed Tibetan uniforms and dresses
of ladies of rank. Owing to the anarchy of the interior the
overland trade routes were closed and this was the only means of
obtaining such stuffs. Then, when the passages of the servants had
been arranged, there were purchases to be made. Already Jigmed had
bought a typewriter. Now he was contemplating a gramophone. One
evening, however, we all met at the station, Jigmed and his
servant, Mary and her maid, myself and my servant, and took the
train to Gaya.</p>

<p>Mary had visited Gaya before, in company with her 'father', the
commander-in-chief. On our emerging from the train at a quarter to
seven in the morning an old station official shuffled up, of whom,
to his great astonishment, she asked, 'Haven't you got a goat with
long ears?' He then recalled the visit of the commander-in-chief in
1925, and the little girl who had accompanied him and had played
with the goat. Meanwhile, another Tibetan had appeared&mdash;a
lama, also on pilgrimage&mdash;and attached himself to us. We
heaped ourselves into two cars. During the drive Jigmed and Mary,
who had thought that India was always hot and had brought no
overcoats, shivered in the foggy dawn. The Tibetan servants, unused
to this form of locomotion, were sick over their chauffeur. On
reaching Buddh Gaya we found a new but very small dak bungalow
awaiting us, to which we were the first visitors. Outside it the
<i>chowkidar</i> had made a little formal garden, whose rows of
neatly bedded flowers he showed us with pride.</p>

<p>Two or three hundred yards away, from a depression which
represents the level of the spot two thousand years ago, rose the
tower of the great Mahabodhi temple, a square cone, slightly
truncated and surmounted by a pinnacle which brings its total
height to 170 feet. To the base of this immense structure, whose
shape resembles that of only one other temple in India, we
proceeded after a short breakfast, threading our way among
flowering trees and groves of ancient stone monuments&mdash;stupas,
pillars, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas&mdash;till we came to the main
entrance. I accompanied the pilgrims inside&mdash;and then, as they
pressed their foreheads to the knees of a Buddha, stopped short. My
intrusion, of a sudden, seemed vulgar and inquisitive, the more so
since Jigmed, having been at school in Darjeeling, had evidently
acquired that self-conscious embarrassment in religious matters
which is inseparable from English education. So I left them and,
wandering off among the precincts of the temple, consoled myself
that, even if Buddhism were not of my inheritance, I could still do
homage to its founder as the philosopher he was, instead of as the
god he has been made.</p>

<p>A wisdom whose conception of space and time was forecast of our
own, and whose canon of individual self-reliance is as high a
compliment as any ever paid by man to man, must always command
respect, even among the ignorant. But it was a warmer, an
historical emotion that held me now, which celebrated not the
wisdom itself, but the event of its coming, on this hallowed site.
For it was here that Buddha, arrived at last on the centre of the
Universe, seated himself beneath the pipal-tree and received the
Illumination that illumined the earth. In the hard still light of
the Indian morning, when the sun enforces peace and nothing moves
or sounds but the wafted scent of a flower or the call of some
quick melodious bell, I sought the <i>genius loci.</i> During
sixteen centuries, between the reign of King Asoka in the third
century BC and the Mohammedan conquest of the thirteenth century
AD, the Mahabodhi temple was the focus of unremitting devotions,
whence the genius of the place has descended, through a period of
ruin and desuetude, to benefit from English guardianship and
welcome pilgrims in motor-cars. Jigmed and Mary had their ritual.
To me, the interloper, remained the figment of human aspirations
which had centred on this spot, and to which Jigmed and Mary now
were adding.</p>

<p>An earlier temple than that which now exists was built by Asoka,
or soon after his time; stone railings belonging to it have
survived, adorned with bosses at the intersection of laterals with
uprights, in the style of other early Buddhist monuments. These
were eventually rearranged to enclose the present and larger
structure, whose date cannot be later than the sixth century AD and
may well be earlier. Fa-Hian, the Chinese pilgrim who visited the
place in the first decade of the fifth century, saw a temple of
sorts, but gives no description of it. Huien-Thsang, who arrived in
the thirties of the seventh, is more explicit; his dimensions
correspond exactly with those of the building as it still stands.
The tower, he said, was made of bluish bricks faced with plaster.
Each niche in each tier of the design contained a gilded image of
Buddha.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century the Burmese did repairs. Thereafter the
temple fell into a state of increasing ruin, until in 1880 a
thorough restoration was undertaken at the instance of the
Government of Bengal. Almost the whole of the outer surface of the
tower was renewed, though with strict regard for the existing
pattern of niches and mouldings; the pinnacle was repaired; and the
four corner pavilions, of which no trace remained, were
reconstructed from the somewhat uncertain authority of a model
found near by. Altogether two lakhs of rupees (&pound;15,000) were
expended. The English have left their mark, as they do, in a
peculiar fond manner, when engaged in archaeological reparation; I
doubt if the temple, in all its long life, has ever worn such a
tidy, solid air as it does to-day. Yet the genius of the place,
instead of being expelled, has been rejuvenated. The Mahabodhi
temple is once more a living shrine, and the prayers of its
pilgrims, from all parts of Buddhist Asia, bring poetry more vivid
than the picturesque futility of negligence and decay.</p>

<p>The pipal-tree, whose shade induced so momentous a consequence,
still exists by courtesy, though its position has altered and it is
probably fifteenth or twentieth in descent from its original
ancestor. An actual child of the latter has survived elsewhere, at
Anaradjpura in Ceylon, where I saw it, now but a fragment of
arboreal senility. This was planted about 240 BC, and its
guardianship at the hands of Buddhist monks has suffered no
recorded interruption. The trees of Buddh Gaya, on the other hand,
have endured much violence. The original was cut down by Asoka of
all people, when he was still an unbeliever. Next day, having
sprung miraculously to life, his queen cut it down again, and the
roots had to be revived with perfumed milk. So tells Huien-Thsang.
When he saw the tree its height was no more than forty or fifty
feet. For in the year 600 the Rajah Sasangka had cut it down again,
and had further dug up the roots and burnt them. Twenty years later
came the Rajah Purnavarma, who revived the roots once more with the
milk of a thousand cows. The next mention of the tree is by Doctor
Buchanan in 1811, who described it as in full vigour and not
exceeding one hundred years in age. When, in 1876, this tree had
decayed and was blown down, there were seedlings ready to replace
it. A few years later, remains of a pipal-tree were found which
could not have been less than twelve hundred years old, owing to a
buttress which had stood that time on top of them. These were in
the proper place, the vicinity of the Vajrasan throne, the diamond
meridian, centre of the Universe, a sandstone seat which still
survives and which marks the actual point of the great
Illumination.</p>

<p>As I looked now, the shiny dark green leaves of the tree were
hung with the prayer-flags of many different races; while from the
dark shade below glowed the tiny flames of countless little lamps.
I sat myself beneath a fig-tree and gazed up at the tower through
the glinting, steely fronds of a palm. Through the courtyard moved
the custodians of the temple, Hindu monks&mdash;for there are no
Buddhists in India now&mdash;dressed in long robes of pale
strawberry faintly tinged with orange. Occasionally a brighter
stuff flashed past, rich golden yellow, the vesture of a monk from
Burma or Ceylon, occupant of the elaborate hostel of red brick and
white marble which subscribers in those two countries have caused
to be erected in the neighbourhood. At length Jigmed and Mary
emerged from their initial rites, and we walked back together to
the rest-house for lunch.</p>

<p>Mary, having made the pilgrimage before, was the leader in their
various observances; and she now announced that this afternoon we
must visit a certain cave where Buddha had lodged prior to his
Illumination. As part of the pilgrimage it was a very essential
visit, and they would be interrogated in Lhassa as to whether it
had been performed. To reach the cave we should borrow an elephant:
so she remarked in a casual voice, as though about to ask the loan
of a neighbour's bicycle. An elephant? I said. She replied, yes, an
elephant. They had been on one before, and that was how you did
visit the cave. Meanwhile two babus, as though in answer to the
need for an elephant, had conjured themselves on to the verandah.
An elephant? they said; of course we must have an elephant. Ponies
could be provided; but an elephant was indispensable. It should be
arranged. After lunch, therefore, we all trooped down the village
street, to the portals of the Hindu monastery, where the elephant
was to await us.</p>

<p>After crossing a large court filled with evidences of monastic
husbandry and surrounded by whitewashed buildings of irregular
height and shape, we were conducted on to the topmost roof, where
sat the <i>mahut</i> or abbot of the sect, cross-legged beneath a
rush canopy. He wore a pale strawberry shirt and gold spectacles.
His head was bald. His features, in shape and immobility, resembled
those of an American Indian. He puffed without cease at the tube of
a hubble-bubble. Three chairs were brought for us, and we seated
ourselves opposite him. He continued to puff. Being unable to
address him myself, I begged Jigmed and Mary to break the silence
with their few words of Hindustani. They refused. Still he puffed,
vouchsafing neither glance nor word. After ten minutes my
self-control began to ebb. I rose. The others rose. We all three
bowed, hoping thus to convey our gratitude for the loan of the
elephant. He inclined his head a quarter of an inch. So we took our
leave.</p>

<p>Downstairs in the court the brute was in readiness, kneeling
down with a ladder against its ribs. In place of the expected
howdah was a red mat, corded under the belly. The elephant is not
an animal which persons of normal stature can bestride. We seated
ourselves sideways, Mary clinging to the <i>mahout</i> between the
ears, Jigmed clinging to Mary, myself clinging to Jigmed, and
Mary's maid clinging to me. Then the elephant rose, straightening
first its forelegs, when we all but slid off over its tail, and
then its hind-legs, when only the <i>mahout</i> saved us from being
precipitated over its forehead. A pause having enabled us to
resettle, the word was given to proceed. On which the animal
hurried up a flight of steps, through a gateway, and down another
flight into the open country. At each motion the grip of Mary's
maid on my waist had grown tighter and tighter. The steps were too
much for her. The voluminous creature flung her arms round my neck
with an expression of alarm that boded the continuance of such
intimacy for the rest of the journey. The weight I could have
borne; but not the smell&mdash;the effluvium of rancid butter that
issued from her parted lips. Firmly I disengaged myself. She
lurched backwards, saved herself by a miracle from the precipice of
the animal's hindquarters, and broke into a volume of protest. On
this Jigmed and Mary decided not to go at all. To leave her behind
did not occur to them. Then, after further discussion, they decided
to try again. Meanwhile the elephant had stopped and knelt down.
Seeing that ponies had been provided as well, I took the
opportunity of exchanging mounts. The elephant rose, Jigmed
comforted his henchwoman, and we set off once more for the
cave.</p>

<p>After crossing several fields we came to a broad river, whose
surface refreshed my feet as we forded our way among the
evil-horned water buffalo that inhabited it. There was no colour,
no distance to the landscape. Only a line of hills gave feature to
the horizon, marking our objective. A sandy waste, covered with
tall pampas grasses such as shelter tigers in pictures, brought us
to another river. The banks were steep, but the elephant negotiated
them without ado, floundering in the soft sand to the distress of
its passengers. My pony was of a frisky disposition. When it
cantered, the elephant did likewise. All through the hot afternoon
we rode, through the insipid blue-green plain with its eternal
park-like trees, till at length the ridge was above us, and we
dismounted at a spot where some ancient arrangement of stones gave
evidence of human activity. Hence led a steep path, overhung with
bushes and admitting only one person at a time, which brought us
eventually to a tall mimosa-tree. Beneath this appeared the
entrance to the cave, a small hole guarded by a grill. Jigmed and
Mary took off their shoes before entering. I peeped in, and seeing
the place to be empty, remained outside under the tree.</p>

<p>Of the cave's tradition, of the antiquity of this lesser
pilgrimage, I was completely ignorant; and so remained until
several years afterward, when the account of Huien-Thsang, thirteen
centuries old, following on that of Fa-Hian, two centuries older,
recalled me from the prosaic surroundings of an English garden to
my seat under the mimosa-tree, while my two Tibetan friends were
engulfed in the bowels of that lonely hill and the elephant waited
below.</p>

<blockquote>As he [Buddha] went to the north-east he saw this
mountain that it was secluded and dark, whereupon he desired to
seek enlightenment thereon. Ascending the north-east slope and
coming to the top, the earth shook and the mountain quaked, whilst
the mountain Deva in terror spake thus to Bodhisattva: 'This
mountain is not the fortunate spot for attaining supreme wisdom. If
here you stop and engage in <i>"Samadhi</i> of the diamond", the
earth will quake and gape and the mountain be overthrown upon
you.'<br>
<br>
Then Bodhisattva descended, and half-way down the south-west slope
he halted. There, backed by the crag and facing a torrent, is a
great stone chamber. Here he sat down cross-legged. Again the earth
quaked and the mountain quaked. Then a Deva of the pure abode cried
out in space, 'This is not the place for a Tathagata to perfect
supreme wisdom. From this south-west fourteen or fifteen li, not
far from the place of penance, there is a Pi-po-lo tree under which
is a "diamond throne". All the past Buddhas seated on this throne
have obtained true enlightenment, and so will those yet to come.
Pray, then, proceed to that spot.'<br>
<br>
Then Bodhisattva rising up, the dragon dwelling in the cave said,
'This cave is pure and excellent. Here you may accomplish the holy
aim. Would that of your exceeding love you would not leave me.'<br>
<br>
Then Bodhisattva, having discovered that this was not the place for
accomplishing his aim, to appease the dragon, he left him his
shadow and departed. The Devas going before, led the way, and
accompanied him to the Bodhi-tree.</blockquote>

<p>Fa-Hian, two centuries earlier, had actually seen the shadow. In
length it was 'somewhat about three feet'. Perhaps Jigmed and Mary
saw it too. I would have asked them had I known of it. Such shadows
do remain. There is one like it in Ceylon, though I could not see
it, even when pointed out to me. I climbed up Adam's Peak and saw
the footmark instead. But these relics are not historical. Whereas
the topography of the Gaya district is as authentic as that of
Jerusalem. Many of its more revered associations, particularly in
the neighbourhood of the temple, eluded me. I have given some
attention to the cave, as few Europeans have been there and fewer
still in such company as was mine.</p>

<p>On descending the hill again the Tibetans admitted that even
they found physical effort at sea-level considerably easier than at
12,000 feet. As we reached the elephant, Mary pointed to the
antique stones, which she said were the remnant of a burning ghat
where Tibetan visitors, on completing their pilgrimage, were wont
to sacrifice a part of their hair. Neither she nor Jigmed, however,
showed any sign of complying with this custom. Already the sun was
low on the horizon. During the long ride back it sank behind the
inevitable line of trees, leaving the spike of the temple tower
silhouetted against a line of red fire. On reaching the river I
dismounted to paddle, while waiting for the elephant to come up
with me. The water buffalo had gone. There was a shiver in the air
and the mists were rising. By the time we returned to the village,
darkness was complete.</p>

<p>The village street was lit, and the elephant, discerning as it
thought the end of its journey, turned in towards the gateway of
the monastery. Its <i>mahout</i> intended otherwise, for the
rest-house was still some distance and the passengers had no wish
to walk. Raising the gaff-like weapon which <i>mahouts</i> carry,
he struck the animal's forehead to divert it. The result proved
unexpected. For the elephant, frankly, was incensed at such
treatment. Pirouetting like a ballet-dancer on two of its immense
feet, it swung back into the street and broke into an infuriated
gallop. Round the corner came a cart. The two collided with a
crash. But what was the fate of the cart I never saw, for by this
time I too was galloping, determined not to miss the fun. On up the
hill sped the enormous brute, with its passengers bumping about on
their mat like tennis-balls in a basket. At the rest-house compound
it swerved like a dirt-track rider, dashed up to the verandah, and
came to a sudden halt. The <i>chowkidar,</i> hearing the noise,
emerged from the door with a lantern. Simultaneously the elephant,
in a last spasm of revenge, proceeded to commit an act of nature.
An appalling cataclysm hit the ground. Seconds grew into a minute;
there was no abatement. Suddenly, above the noise, rose a cry of
rage and despair. It was the <i>chowkidar.</i> His garden&mdash;I
looked: it had <i>gone.</i> Uprooted by the inexorable spate, each
precious flower was floating away into the night. When the flood
subsided, in place of those loving beds there remained but a
confused depression. Then the elephant, satisfied at last, gathered
itself together, discharged its human burden, and walked sedately
off. The <i>chowkidar</i> was left speechless at the catastrophe,
invoking curses of heaven with uplifted arms.</p>

<p>The next day we spent quietly. Seated beneath a fig-tree, I drew
the temple. When the drawing was finished, Jigmed said he thought
it almost as good as a photograph. Most of the day they were busy
in the temple. But the labours of pilgrimage had been lightened for
them by the opportune presence of the lama we had picked up at the
station, who prepared and lit no less than a thousand lamps for
them.</p>

<p>I grew to admire Mary. She assumed responsibility for our
comfort. In all her movements, no matter how commonplace their
purpose, there were grace, breeding, and authority. Her whole
person was the outcome of a confident tradition. At meals she
talked of life in Lhassa in tones of effortless esteem, such as a
duke's daughter might use in talking of London.</p>

<p>Her adopted father, she said, was now a <i>shapeh,</i> one of
the four great ministers who are next in importance to the Dalai
Lama himself in the administration of the country. As such he
wears, on state occasions, a robe which is woven so stiff with gold
that it stands up by itself, and which needs two servants to bend
it round him. This alone costs &pound;750, while the winter hat of
the uniform, made of black fox fur, costs as much again. Lately,
however, he had obtained a similar fur from America at a more
reasonable price. He had, in fact, instituted a system of barter
with certain Americans. In return for curios they were to send him
chiefly flower seeds. He maintains large flower and vegetable
gardens in Lhassa, the former containing snapdragons and sweet
williams.</p>

<p>In the old days he had been commander-in-chief, had accompanied
the Dalai Lama to China in 1904 and had saved his life, as already
recorded, in 1910. As a good soldier he had become imbued with
Western ideas, and had eventually raised the Tibetan army to a
decent level of efficiency. But during his tour of India in 1925
the Dalai Lama had listened to other councils, and when the
commander-in-chief reached Gyantse on his way back to Lhassa, he
learned that his officers had been degraded and his work undone.
The office of commander-in-chief was abolished, and he became a
<i>shapeh</i> instead. Not that he minded; it meant less work, and
he liked being at home and enjoying himself. Perhaps he is
unpopular with the monks. But the common people adore him for his
benevolence.</p>

<p>Her eldest brother, Mary added, was not so promising. In the
last two years he had gambled away &pound;1,000, had pawned his
wife's jewels in the process, and had even misappropriated State
funds, for which he had been dismissed the Government service. The
hope of the family was her younger brother, who was very serious
and was now in a Government school being trained for the
administration. The Dalai Lama approved of him and sometimes even
sent for him.</p>

<p>When Jigmed and she returned to Tibet, they would stay in
Gyantse for a month and then go up to Lhassa with the whole family
for the New Year games. Each of the <i>shapehs</i> on this occasion
has to provide an entertainment, and her father's is always the
best. The Dalai Lama gives away the prizes. There would be many
evening parties, to attend which electric torches were necessary,
since the streets are unlighted. Jigmed said they entertained a
great deal at Tehring also. In the summer, for large parties, they
erect a marquee in the garden. He and Mary were planning to build
themselves a house in the English style. I thought of the English
style as they knew it, and my face betrayed regret. It was useless
to try and explain. They could not understand.</p>

<p>And then said Mary: 'I love Tibet. If only it had trains or
motors, I think it would be the nicest country in the world.'</p>

<p>'But,' I answered, 'the monks don't like that sort of
thing.'</p>

<p>'No,' she sighed. 'Some people don't seem to want to be
civilized.'</p>

<p>I tried to sympathize with that sigh. The hardships of travel in
Tibet can hardly be expected to appeal to those whose lifelong fate
they are. But I could not. For once trains or motors have been
introduced, the Tibet that Mary loves will be Tibet no longer.</p>

<p>That evening, after Jigmed and Mary have paid their last visit
to the temple and have come back from it with scented garlands
round their necks, we all three walk down the road together. The
mist is rising. We stop by a well, to watch the oxen treading out
their immemorial circuit and the water coming up in a chain of
buckets. I ask them if they will ever come to England. They ask me
if I shall ever return to Tibet. We ask each other if we shall ever
meet again. Perhaps we shall, even if we shall have grown old
before the time comes. For I always, as though by some hidden law,
go back to places. Then Jigmed gives me two rings, for my two
sisters, one mounting a ruby, the other a turquoise, in rich Lhassa
gold-work. And so we retrace the road to the rest-house, where the
cars wait to take us to the station. I think once more of the blue
sky and clear air of the plateau, of the wind and sun, of the
sweeping ranges, and the-chant of ploughman and thresher. Once more
I see Tibet immune from Western ideas, and once more I wonder how
long that immunity will last. I look at Jigmed and Mary. They have
met Western ideas. Yet their poise, especially in Mary's case, has
not suffered. Beyond them, the future is concealed. Beyond
me&mdash;what is the future of my own country? The dusk thickens.
The luggage is packed, the servants are on the threshold. At Gaya
station we buy a box of fancy chocolates before the train comes
in.</p>
