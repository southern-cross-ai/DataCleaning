<hr><h2><a name="pt0"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p>The proportion of emphasis in every book must vary with the
measure of misapprehension in the popular imagination concerning
the subject with which it deals. The history of the Levant,
hitherto distorted by journalist and scholar alike to the
furtherance of their private hypotheses, demands, in its present
phase, an element of correction, which should result in the
imposition of a foreground of recent fact upon a distant plane of
historical analysis. The intention of this book was originally to
present a history of the eastern Mediterranean between the years
1919 and 1923. But it became immediately apparent, upon a second
and protracted exploration of the Greek seaboard in 1926, that to
portray the events of those years without previous investigation of
their historical foundations were equivalent to offering the public
the last act of a problem play without the first. The fault now
committed, the offer of the first without the last is, I hope, the
lesser. The extension in scope needed another two years' work. And
an author's time, above all men's, is money. A manuscript once
completed, he will as soon lock it in a box as a financier hoards
gold pieces in a vault.</p>

<p><i>The present volume is in no sense one of research among
original sources.</i> Its intention has been simply to gather the
currents of the past into a single stream; and while indicating,
with deference, a number of unexplored eddies in the spate of
Western evolution, to enable a successor, if ever it is written, to
show which forces have retained their vitality in the present time.
Above all its intent is not didactic. It is hoped, simply, that the
reader will in future experience some quickening of historical
emotion, when next there obtrudes on his notice the seaboard of the
Greeks and its capital city of Constantinople.</p>

<p>&mdash;R. B.</p>

<hr>

<p><i>"Of that Byzantine Empire the universal verdict of history is
that it constitutes, without a single exception, the most
thoroughly base and despicable form that civilization has yet
assumed...There has been no other enduring civilization so
absolutely destitute of all the forms and elements of greatness,
and none to which the epithet mean may be so emphatically
applied...Its vices were the vices of men who had ceased to be
brave without learning to be virtuous. Without patriotism, without
the fruition or desire of liberty...slaves, and willing slaves, in
both their actions and in their thoughts, immersed in sensuality
and in the most frivolous pleasures, the people only emerged from
their listlessness when some theological subtlety, or some chivalry
in the chariot races, stimulated them to frantic riots...They had
continually before them the literature of ancient Greece, instinct
with the loftiest heroism: but that literature, which afterwards
did so much to revivify Europe, could fire the degenerate Greeks
with no spark or semblance of nobility. The history of the empire
is a monotonous story of the intrigues of priests, eunuchs, and
women; of poisonings, of conspiracies, of uniform ingratitude, of
perpetual fratricides."</i><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>&mdash;An example of classic-rationalist criticism, from WILLIAM
LECKY'S <i>History of European Morals,</i> 1869.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="pt1"></a>Part I. The Historical Image</h2>

<hr><h3><a name="pt1-1"></a>Chapter 1. The Historian</h3>

<p>Pride of the masses in birth and circumstance, termed when
racially manifest, patriotism, is habitually evoked in the defense
either of institutions or ideas. Since his divergence from the
lesser forms of creation, man has striven to maintain not only his
social organizations, tribal, municipal or imperial, but also, on
occasion, the less concrete principles of religion, honor, and
mental freedom. Today, as a force in the second quarter of the
twentieth century, patriotism is variously regarded. While it
remains the opinion of many that immolation in the furthest desert
to which their country's sovereignty extends constitutes the
highest form of human expression, there are others who, with
parallel intemperance, dismiss every token of national existence as
a kind of original sin dating from Louis XIV and George III. Mental
patriotism, such as that which fought the Reformation and led
England to declare war on Germany in 1914, is viewed by
nationalists with less enthusiasm, by "little Englanders" with
greater tolerance. But removed from these definitions is another
form of pride in which the individual can permit the rest to share;
a form seldom felt, more seldom given words, which transcends the
consciousness of this or that tradition, the sunsets of an empire
or the concept of a god; which surmounts the barriers not only of
political, but of ethical, intellectual, and spiritual
disagreement. World consciousness is a commonplace; European
already a reality. But the supreme pride is measured not in terms
of the existing earth, of temperament and social device, but in
divisions of time, in terms of human development&mdash;that
development, which, whether it prove ultimately progressive or
retrograde, is continuous. The instinct is a pride, a patriotism in
our age. Sons of fathers, fathers of children, we stand companion
to a moment. Let the flag fly, not of lands and waters, morals and
gods, but of an era, a generation.</p>

<p>In communion with this apotheosis of the age, this pride in the
present's relation to the past and future, there emerges from the
furthest antiquity of every country and every race, the science of
historical analogy. This process, commonly a mere embellishment of
popular writers, makes it possible, by sorting the centennially and
millennially repeated incidents and trends of history, to surmise
the actual moment of our progress. Civilizations are uncommon
phenomena. They are to be distinguished from transitory cultural
epochs such as those enjoyed by Periclean Greece and the Italy of
the Renaissance. Ours is barely come. But not only are we poised on
the footboard of the encyclopedic civilization now being launched;
in addition, we are gathered to the brow of infinity by the initial
achievement of the scientific revolution. Thus, like Moses on Nebo,
we occupy a vantage point: we look both ways: back to Darwinism,
daguerreotypes and railway trains; ahead to mathematical pantheism,
television and the colonization of the stars. And it is this
increasing systematization of intuitive analysis, standardization
of old form to produce new, and interconnection of place, which
distinguishes the oncoming civilization from its precursors. Its
vitality will endure, as theirs did not, from the scope and unity
of its embrace.</p>

<p>Thus the historian, substituting for the methods of the
pedagogue those of the scientist and the philosopher, is the high
priest of the instant. To assimilate peacefully the, forces of the
advancing epoch, as yet but faintly discernible on its distant
horizon, the world must revise its conception of the past,
distilling from a recoordination of essential fact, the elements
that have contributed to the immensity upon which it is about to
lay hold. It is the day of historical stocktaking, when all peoples
must bring their achievement into line with the one universal
development of the future. (Until, when that is interrupted, some
classic Melanesian golden age shall raise a tiny cultured head and
start again.) In place of the presentation of an unpalatable
sequence of incident, sugared with romance and molded to the bias
of particularist writers&mdash;in the English language usually
Protestant or Liberal&mdash;the function of history in this moment
of rapid evolution resolves into a dual purpose: the general, to
sift from the past a philosophic and scientific understanding of
the present in preparation for the future; and in particular, to
enumerate and render intelligible any series of events, the
consequences of which are liable to affect ensuing generations in
an immediate and perceptible manner. In the whole of European
history, no moment offers more relevant comparison to our own than
that in which Christianity became the state religion of the Roman
Empire. A new civilization was thus born, the nature and
achievement of which have remained unintelligible in the centuries
of Triumphant Reason that have followed its extinction. Hence, in a
single, if yet uncompleted, enquiry, the alliance of Constantine's
foundation with such incidents in its legacy as the sack of Smyrna
in 1922.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt1-2"></a>Chapter 2. The Greeks</h3>

<p>As the sapphire and the aquamarine from the turquoise, so differ
the waters of the Aegean from the flat blue of the Mediterranean
whole. Sail from Italy or Egypt. And as the rose-tinted shores of
islands and promontories rise incarnate from the sea, a door shuts
the world behind. Earth's emotion diffuses a new essence. Who are
we to cut the water and cleave the air with prow and funnel?</p>

<p>Those who sit at home with their anthologies, their Homers and
Byrons, have long grown impatient of the hackneyed eulogy.
Travelers, on the other hand, know that the poet has not lived who
can hackney the Greek sea itself. How lies it apart? What magnet of
our stifled love hold this blue, these tawny cliffs and always the
mountains framing the distance? Why does the breeze blow with a
scent of hiking herbs which the misty shores echo in their colors?
What is this element, hybrid of air and water, physical as a kiss,
with which the night enfolds us? The islands float past, forming
and reforming in goodbye, gleaming golden white against the sharp
blues, or veiled in the odorous haze of evening. A silver sheen
overspreads the sea as the ship moves north; the sky grows mild,
hung with stationary clouds. Through the straits, all day across
the Marmora brings the shadowy cones of the Princes' Islands, and
the mirage of Constantinople. Then down again beside the rich soil
and undulating ranges of Anatolia, to the bay of Smyrna, Rhodes,
and below, in the corner, Cyprus. At the foot lies Crete; on the
west, Corfu. This is the radius of the elusive essence; Byzantium,
the keystone of its arc. From the southern boundary of Albania to
the Asia Minor littoral, the entity is definite as Great Britain or
the islands of Japan. Within it, the divinity of earth moves to the
brink of tangibility. And if, in the first migrations, its custody
was vouchsafed a people in whom the quest of the divine, which
distinguishes man from beast, was already conscious, small wonder
that this people has played a significant part in the general
evolution of civilization. Who was this people, favored above
others? What has become of it?</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>It were futile to deny that, in Anglo-Saxon parlance, the term
"Modern Greek" is flavored with a suspicion of contempt as
inevitable as that aroma of human perfection which attaches to
Ancient. When it was discovered, in the opening years of the
nineteenth century, that the wild tribes of the Peloponnese, among
whom four centuries' alien misrule had rendered outlawry the only
honorable profession, were not imbued with the heroic virtues so
conspicuously absent in the contemporary states of Western Europe,
the world of the Greek revival received the intelligence with
pain.</p>

<p>Balm, however, was forthcoming in the writings of Fallmerayer,
whose history of the Morea, published in the thirties, convinced a
Europe anxious to believe it that the "Modern Greek" was of
Slavonic origin. With sensation of relief, it was decided that the
descendants of Pericles and Pheidias were extinct. The word
degenerate, brandished with such potent futility by Gibbon, was
borrowed from the ashes of the empire to decry the foundations of
the kingdom. From then onwards the world at large, eyes riveted on
the dead pillars of the Parthenon, has discounted the inhabitants
beneath them as the unmoral refuse of medieval Slav migrations,
sullying the land of their birth with the fury of their politics
and the malformation of their small brown bodies.</p>

<p>But, within the last few decades there has arisen, in face of
the prejudice of scholarship, the science of anthropology. It has
therefore become possible to determine, without further question,
the racial origins of Ancient, Byzantine, and Modern Greeks.</p>

<p>In the early Neolithic age the whole area of land between Great
Britain and Somaliland was inhabited by a genus of delicately built
brunettes, which have been termed by modern scientists the Brown or
Mediterranean race. Gradually the sphere of its predominance was
encroached upon by Teutons in the north, Nubians in the south; till
at length it survived only in a majority on the Mediterranean
littoral. Subject to that limitation, it may be classified,
speaking of physical characteristics, in four main families, of
which the Pelasgians&mdash;to borrow a name from Herodotusinhabited
Greece, the Archipelago, and the west coast of Asia Minor. That
this people, or more accurately this branch, was possessed, before
the advent of the Indo-European Hellenes, of a civilization capable
of high development and assimilation, is demonstrated in the
artistic and domestic achievement of the Minoan era in Crete, for
which it must have been mainly responsible. Additional, though less
sophisticated, remains of its culture are to be found in the
monuments of the Etruscans, a branch of the Pelasgians migrated to
Italy.</p>

<p>At length, from that uncharted fount, the home of the Aryans,
the magic Hellenes brought their powers of reasoning, their
perception of form and their language. These they imposed on the
Pelasgians. In the representational arts, the period of fusion,
prior to the wholesale preponderance of the Hellenic culture,
produced those colored portrait busts, superior to anything that
formerly came out of Egypt, or later of Greece, which are now in
the Acropolis Museum at Athens. Even Herodotus admits that the
Hellenes always remained a minority in the country of their
invasion; racially they were almost immediately assimilated.
Nonetheless, this combination, of which, in our everyday speech,
the adjective is "Greek," was a successful one. It laid one of the
three foundations of that European civilization which has now
engulfed the globe. Its cultural influence was felt from Gibraltar
to Peking, from the wall of Hadrian to the roots of the Nile, even
in the centuries of its inauguration. Where its people were
predominant, there also was prosperity. With the submersion of the
Greeks, poverty and misgovernment fastened on their home, the
shores of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the intervening years, the whole Brown Race,
particularly in Italy and Spain, had become diluted with foreign
stock. This process was the work of the barbarian invasions that
followed the fall of the West Roman Empire, from which the
Byzantine sphere, but for occasional and impermanent incursions,
was immune. Thus, of the four families into which the Brown Race
was originally divided, that in which the physical characteristics
correspond most markedly with those exhibited by the anatomical
remains of the original stock, is the Greek. The theory of Slavic
origin, derived from a superficial observation of village names in
the neighborhood of Athens, is as plausible as a deduction from the
place terminations of -wick and -by, that all Englishmen are
descended from Danes. The popularity of Fallmerayer's opinions has
been heightened by the illusion of blond giants which the familiar
white marble statues of Greece present. It is simultaneously
forgotten that chiseled noses, proud lips, and rounded chins are
still Greek features, though seldom found in coincidence, and not
always easy to distinguish beneath straw hats and toothbrush
moustaches.</p>

<p>Thus, in so far as anthropology is better qualified to offer
decision than any branch of scholarship, the definition of the
Greek remains in the twentieth century what it always was: a unit
of the old Mediterranean stock possessing an Aryan culture, akin to
that of the Scythians and Sarmatians, engrafted on its own. But
beyond the identity of bones and skulls, there exists, for the man
in the street, more convincing proof. Since the moment of history's
earliest acquaintance with the Greeks, the essential qualities of
their character have descended through the greatness of the
Byzantine, and the degradation of the Ottoman Empires, unchanged.
The travelling pedagogue, who admits the existence of the native
population only to lament the absence of that vacuous perfection
which he conceives to have been the Hellenic physiognomy, will
maintain an opposite opinion. But it is doubtful whether, amid his
texts and annotations, he has ever acquired sufficient acquaintance
with human character to divest his heroes of their heroics and
discover the men beneath. Those, however, who have drunk the
humanities as a medicine rather than an intoxicant, will recognize
in the modern Greek mentality and temperament, the counterpart of
the ancient. The history of a people is not possible until the
degree of constancy in its character is determined.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the salient and most permanent impulse of the
race is an avid curiosity. The zeal for knowledge, which inspired
the first philosophers and the first scientists, differed in no way
from that to which St. Paul, in an age of new necessity, cast the
bait of the Unknown God. Today the "men of Athens" still greet one
another with the words "[<i>Greek characters</i>]&mdash;what news?"
and await an answer. In the country a regular formula of personal
interrogation is the preliminary to all hospitality. There results
from this insatiable attitude of enquiry, a universal, and to the
Briton, extraordinary, respect for learning, for books as books,
and for any aspect of cultural ability. From the highest to the
lowest, even to the illiterate, this national trait has endured
through the ages. And, as might be expected from an acquaintance
with either the Ancients or the Byzantines, history is regarded as
a recreation rather than a study, the leading newspapers exhibiting
daily columns from the pens of its foremost professors.</p>

<p>The perpetual dissatisfaction with the outward semblance of
things also engenders, as it always did, a depreciatory clarity of
vision. The Greeks, in contrast with the English, are lacking in
that quality of self-deception which so assists a moral people in
its dubious enterprises. Though capable of untruth in pursuance of
an aim, with themselves they are honest. They employ fact in both
speech and literature, to the detriment of those decencies which
Anglo-Saxons prize above truth. And it is to this exercise of
semicynical, semisatirical insight into the weakness of human
motive, that they owe the genuine, passionate spirit of democracy
which they translated into political science, which was the
foundation of the Byzantine monarchy, and with which they are still
imbued. Through 3,000 years Greek history exhibits no vestige of a
caste system. The pedestals of popular esteem are, and always have
been, reserved for men of learning, servants and private
benefactors of the state, and occasional families who have enjoyed
a record of public service through two or three generations.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be supposed that the Greek is inquisitive
only in the manner of the savage. He is gifted, in addition, with a
uniform standard of intelligent ability, such as characterizes, for
instance, the Jew. In this "quick-wittedness" the contrast is
especially marked between himself and the other Balkan races,
Rumanian, Bulgar, Serb, and Albanian. In addition he is spurred, as
a rule, by ambition. As trader and financier, it is said that
"though second to the Armenian, he can surpass the Jew." In this
respect one fact is certain: throughout history, the prosperity of
the Levant, an area where important trade routes and natural riches
coincide in astonishing profusion, has varied and will continue to
vary with his political fortune.</p>

<p>Save when an opportunity for actual participation in the affairs
of the state presents itself, their discussion constitutes, without
rival, his national recreation. Those who have moved among the
English working classes testify unanimously that their interest in
politics is aroused only during the transitory excitement of
elections. In Greece, so alive among the obscurest grades of
society is the tradition of every man's partnership in the conduct
of the country, that parliamentary government is rendered almost
impossible, unless supported by the steadying loyalty that attaches
to a throne. This latter the Byzantines possessed; while the
popular vice, argument, was diverted to the less destructive
province of theology. Today the political recrudescence of this
vice is focused in countless newspapers, whose acrid party columns
vividly recall the petty slates and infantile wars of the classical
era. But, beneath the surface currents of recrimination, there
flows a deep religious patriotism, a mystical faith in the Hellenic
destiny, which is fundamentally different from the chauvinist
imperialism of the West. Corollary of this is an insane party
loyalty, which can agitate the domestic life of the country to an
inconceivable degree. In both national and party causes, the Greeks
are indefatigable propagandists. Hence, in these spheres, truth is
often elusive. Similar tactics in business dealings lead them to
excesses, which those whom they outwit term dishonesty and double
dealing. In this connection, however, it is impossible to discount
the effect of four centuries' misrule and insecurity, from which a
large proportion of the population has been not twenty years
delivered. And it may be noticed, in passing, that the corruption
of public servants and members of the Government is not practiced
with the open complacency that prevails among the other Balkan
countries and in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The people are devoutly religious and devoutly superstitious;
though their aspirations of soul have never been systematically
diverted to the purposes of an institution by the exploitation of
superstition, as in Latin countries. Towards nature, flowers, trees
and birds, they feel a romantic, almost spiritual love. This, owing
to its having attained widest expression in the writings of
antiquity, is often termed pagan, as though it were in
contradiction to Christianity.</p>

<p>Finally, and most essential clue to their character through the
ages, the Greeks are imbued with the same conceit as they ever
were&mdash;a conceit so cosmic, deified, part of the order of
existence, that outward expression of it is superfluous and its
ultimate discovery leaves the stranger with a sense of shock.
European neither in fact nor feeling, they talk of "Europe" as
somewhere else, and regard foreigners, though with tolerance and
sometimes affection, as lacking in those essential qualities which
have always constituted the Hellenic superiority over "the
barbarians." This conceit renders them impulsive and, therefore,
physically brave; it also deprives them of sound judgment in
moments of crisis. Since the War of Independence they appear to
have been inspired with a singular devotion towards Great Britain,
which originated in gratitude, and has been maintained by the Greek
appreciation of the element of justice in British character. If
proof of their constancy in friendship be desired, it is
forthcoming in the fact that, despite the events between 1914 and
1923, this feeling has remained.</p>

<p>Such in retrospect and present fact, is the Greek character. A
clever, conceited and enquiring race, intensely political and
intensely democratic, reserved in its friendships, conservative in
its beliefs, commercially gifted, responsive to the emotions of
nature and religion, the Greek people had endured, poised between
East and West, child of neither, yet receptive to both. Originally
an alloy, it stood like a new metal bridge from Africa and later
Asia, to carry northwest the foundations of a world civilization.
This work accomplished, it has preserved the identity of which that
world then strove to rob it. But how is it that the world, the
barbarians, contemptuous as they are contemptible, are still
concerned with the existence of the Greeks at all? Whence has the
flood of their misrepresentation been unloosed? The source is found
in that curious mixture of sincere and artificial enthusiasm,
Philhellenism.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The most frequent manifestations of this peculiar mental state,
both in print and life, are the outcome of that jejune philosophy
of living, which is the last heritage of the classical scholar.
Student, ultimately interpreter, of Greek texts; endowed with a
kindred love of exact reasoning and exact representation, together
with a kindred absence of historical perspective and emotional
outlet; he has fabricated from literature and stones an ideal of
humanity, which he and his following have pronounced applicable to
eternity. It is the singular odium of this eternal comparison, for
centuries the bane of European culture, which necessitates, once
and for all, the relegation of classicism to its just place in the
tale of human development.</p>

<p>In history alone, the paper Philhellenes may be held responsible
for as great a volume of calculated misrepresentation as the
priestly editors of the Old Testament. Fanatically jealous for
their idols' prestige, they visit the virtues of the fathers upon
the twentieth-century children with a malignity so familiar that
further mention of it is unnecessary. Flouting the rudiments of
anthropology, dating a quarter of a century back, they continue to
propagate the thesis that the ancient Greek was a Nordic giant, and
that the modern is a Slav dwarf. In face of common-sense euphony,
they persist in maintaining a pronunciation invented by the
ignorant English scholars of the sixteenth century, which utters
"bazilews" for [<i>Greek characters</i>] instead of "vassilefs,"
"kilioy" for [<i>Greek characters</i>] instead of
"hilii"&mdash;thus rendering moribund a language which, after two
millenniums, differs from Euripides considerably less than modern
English from Chaucer. Though aware, if pretending to culture (which
they possibly do not) that a cursive Greek hand has existed for
more than a thousand years, they still compel submissive pupils to
perform their conjugations in a disjointed and hideous script, thus
dissipating the short hours of youth, and the straitened incomes of
its progenitors, in useless effort. Finally, they range themselves
in support of a cynical world's opinion that the twentieth-century
Hellene is no more than a negligible assemblage of human vices.
Only the Byzantine era, being past, and in any case beyond their
understanding, is spared the aggregate of their vituperation. But
even those familiar with the eternal dotage of our Universities,
will scarcely believe that at Oxford, until as late as 1924,
Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i> was still presented as a set book
to candidates about to embark on two years' study, not of
literature, but history.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from the perversion of truth, an art which is
necessarily unbecoming in the paid instructors of youth, there is
about the textual Philhellene a negative vacuity which betrays him.
Artistically, his appreciations are those of an unsuccessful
photographer. That "art translates inward into visible form" is a
principle as alien to his under standing as the paintings of El
Greco which illustrate it. Amid the mysterious glory of St. Sophia,
or the pungent energy of modern industrial creation, he aches for
the neat refinements of the Parthenon. In short, he is complacent.
He seeks, as life progresses, not the exquisite acutening of his
aspirations and their infinite expansion, but plain, unrippled
attainment. Whether a participant in the age-old conspiracy of
pedagogues to sacrifice the intellect of the universe to the
retention of their incomes, or simply dilettante offspring of their
misguidance, he is liable to succeed in his ambition. Let us leave
him content, a dog with his bone. Let us regulate, also, the
proportion of his importance.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Less subterraneously destructive than cultural Philhellenism, is
its political counterpart, which has served, nevertheless, to
sustain a mirror of equal distortion. First exposed to ridicule by
the unruly dissensions between the brigand and the educated
contrivers of Greek Independence at the time of Byron's death, it
has since degenerated into that negative and unprofitable emotion,
the abstract hatred of the Turk. Always a minor tenet of English
Liberalism, this sentiment was first given prominence by its
inclusion in Gladstone's mission to mankind during the Midlothian
election of 1876. Echoed by the same sonorous lips twenty years
later, and with such violence that Lord Rosebery, then leader of
the Liberal party, was obliged to resign; and espoused since by
succeeding disciples, it has not only wearied the general public
with repetition, but has provoked an inevitable reaction in favor
of a race possessing aristocratic manners and a fondness for the
horse. During the late wars and conferences, the intemperance of
propagandist pamphlets, filled with such arguments as that, in the
absence of brothels in Athens, Greeks deserved an empire in Asia,
added to the skepticism with which political Philhellenism was
viewed. In 1919, while Venizelos was being hailed in the West as
the one living "undegenerate descendant of Pericles," the fate of
Constantinople was under discussion among the colossi. The theory
that the city was Roman in origin and had remained Roman until 1453
was accepted both by those who had been taught its history, and
those who had not. Was not Justinian, who built St. Sophia, the
great codifier of Roman law? And why, asked the Vatican, publicly
at odds with the "rival pope on the Bosporus;" upset the balance of
the world "for the sake of a Church?" The months dragged on; the
world wanted peace and the Greeks were causing war. At length came
the disaster, acclaimed by the English press to overthrow the
statesman whose policy had engendered it. Political Philhellenism
was finally discredited.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>What then is real Philhellenism? What has inspired and still
inspires strangers from northern lands and other continents, to
fight, or die, or give the remainder of their lives to Greece? Is
it hexameters and lifeless stone? Is it the abstract of freedom, or
the hatred of infidel misgovernment? Is there, in fact,
explanation?</p>

<p>When a man is drawn to a woman, he may want her body; there is
explanation in that. But when he falls in love, motive defies
analysis. The Greek seaboard is also of two elements. In the brown
mountains, the rosy air, and the sapphire sea; in the golden
temples and classic sites; in the broken churches and luminous
mosaics, sad residue of the Empire; in the temperament of the
people itself; in these lies the body. And the other? It is the
essence which defines the <i>Romiosyni,</i> the Greek world, and
eludes the comprehension of man. Byron knew it. When he set sail
the second time for Greece, invested with all the paraphernalia of
mock romance, he alone, of all his contemporaries, harbored no
illusions of "a race of heroes." He said once, to a friend, who had
suggested visiting Homeric sites in Thrace, "Do I look like one of
those emasculated fogies? Let's have a swim. I detest antiquarian
twaddle." For Greeks, the epitaph of the greatest Philhellene is
written in those words, "Let's have a swim."</p>

<p>Exactly a century ago, the road of practical Philhellenism was
plain. The Greeks were fighting, before Italy or Germany or any of
the Balkans had fought, to regain national existence. Philhellenes
fought with them. Today that existence is assured. Practical
Philhellenism must be the Philhellenism of reconstruction.</p>

<p>The last fifty years have witnessed the expansion of European
civilization over the whole of the globe. In the process, European
ideals, if they have gained new impetus, have suffered dilution.
There is not, as it were, sufficient of the original force to
maintain the quality of the whole output. As the central dynamo,
Europe must continue, a century and more yet, to play her part. All
available resources must be brought into action. And in the
rehabilitation of our continent, of primary importance is the
Levant. Endowed with a profusion of agricultural, mineral and
oleous wealth; the crossroads of trade between Russia and Egypt,
between Europe and the East; heritage of a race industrious,
commercial and uncloyed by empty dreams of political grandiosity;
the littoral of the eastern Mediterranean, whither formerly flowed
riches unknown even to the Incas, lies unhappy and penurious,
lacking a circulating force to stir the potentialities of soil, sea
and people: potentialities, in which may lie the future of Europe
and then the future of the earth. That circulating force has
arisen, and will only arise, in the political well-being of the
Greeks. The twentieth century is likely to witness a bitter
intensification of that covetous regard for the Near East, which
was formerly the monopoly of Russia. The Levant is the concern of
all. And it is to illustrate how the potentialities of the Levant
once flowered, and can flower again, that this volume is
written.</p>

<p>Let those in whose common sense this appeal finds response, go
and see for themselves. They will find, after all, a higher form
than the Philhellenism of reconstruction; a Philhellenism not of
the mind, but of the soul. Let us, also, they will say, have a
swim.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt1-3"></a>Chapter 3. The Byzantines</h3>

<p>From sifting the numerous implications of meaning attaching to
the word "civilization," there emerges a definition, which presumes
it to consist in the vitality of three elements in man's corporate
mode of living. These are: the Stable; the Transcendental; and the
Cultural. Vitality in each simultaneously is seldom found, save in
large cities whence they radiate their combined influence
throughout their city's dominion. And the rarity of even this
coincidence constitutes the rarity of civilizations. Failure in the
vitality of any one of them denotes a lapse from true civilization
to conditions of life comparable with those of fifteenth century
Italy or the present Middle West of the United States.</p>

<p>First essential to the definition of civilization is the stable
element, the universal confidence in the social organism to
maintain itself and its government, and to modify itself to
external and internal necessity. This confidence, when it exists,
pervades people unconsciously. Security of property, the standards
of living, the countless services of local government&mdash;all go
for granted without thought or investigation, like the sun and the
stars, symbolized in those outward features, dinner jackets,
bathrooms and asphalt roads, which evoke the awe and envy of less
advanced peoples.</p>

<p>Second is that composite element in human activity, the quest of
transcendental values, and their collateral ethics. To every race,
in infancy and succeeding childhoods, is vouchsafed the concept of
a God. This, ultimately, may lose identity in that of a gentleman.
But underneath social demeanor, there remains to man his soul
proper, his own greatness, his unquiet spirit seeking cosmic
direction, ever striving to soar above the mental gravities of
earth. It is contended that civilizations such as that upon which
we are entering, retard the divine quest in humanity by the very
security with which they encushion it against the fundamental
workings between man and earth, man and man, man and God. But it
remains to be seen whether those relationships do not, as the
scientific revolution approaches its climax, attain a depth and
precision of definition hitherto undreamed. And the soul,
mathematically propelled, may redouble the exploration of its
affinity in space, dictating, with historical experience as its
partner, successive codes and morals for the earth.</p>

<p>Third and final element in civilization is the cultural, product
of the scientific and artistic impulse generated by a corporate
intellectual activity. It is in this province that the inspired
individual souls of an age become accessible to the majority, whose
diversity of intelligence and occupation will not permit their
investigation of the mysteries with which they arc communicant, but
not, beyond the one-sided peephole of religion, conversant.</p>

<p>The stable, the transcendental, the cultural: genii of
civilization. Each has existed without the others. Hellas had
Culture, Judah a Soul, Renaissance Europe both. The United States
of America now enjoy the blessings of Stability. But it is the
fusion of the three that constitutes a civilization, the vitality
of which will vary inversely with the deficiency in any one of
them. We in Europe, sponsors of a civilization which posterity will
term the most momentous phenomenon in history, are conscious of the
necessity to hold the balance between them, if less certain of the
ability. And it is at this point that the relevance of
civilization's analysis in connection with the eastern
Mediterranean becomes clear. Only once, during the whole history of
our continent and all the peoples that have contributed to our
present, has this balance been discovered; and once discovered
maintained for nine centuries, to contend against the agony of
dissolution for another two. This was behind the walls, and within
the sphere, of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Thus, in considering the role of the Levant during the
convulsions of the early twentieth century, it is to be remembered
that not only may the population of the Aegean coasts contribute a
larger share to the maintenance of our present vital civilization
than is popularly supposed; but that it, Greek, alone of European
races, has experienced such a phenomenon in the past. Culture it
had. Out of the East rose a soul. From the 'West marched stability.
The soul transformed the culture, the culture the soul. And the
Byzantine civilization, the joyous life that once crowded on the
Golden Horn and flourished in woods and gardens by the sweet waters
of Asia, has left a heritage to the world and its imprint uneffaced
upon the Levant. Its interest in the present derives partly from
the state of its people today; and partly from its share in the
formation of, and in its affinity with, its universal successor of
the West.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>In considering the stability of the social edifice, the affinity
between Western and Byzantine civilization is both external and
internal.</p>

<p>In the external relations of its political units, the chief hope
of the modern world lies in the elimination of the armed and
insular state, and the aggressive racial consciousness of its
inhabitants. It was this spirit, though confined within the smaller
units of municipalities, which reduced ancient Greece to the point
of extinction. Hellenic culture, art, science, literature and
philosophy, were saved only through the medium of the Roman Empire;
and at long last through the creation, culminating in the
transference of the capital to Constantinople, of an international
spirit that was, in fact, an all-pervasive Hellenism. More
influential, still, in this process of transcending racial
barriers, was Christianity, newly adopted as the state religion.
For it was in this process that lay the strength and cohesion of
the Byzantine Empire. The world of the present day offers a
comparison almost exactly similar. The European countries
correspond to the city-states of Greece; the range of Anglo-Saxon
institutions to that of Roman; Europeanism to Hellenism; and the
intellectual effect of the scientific revolution to Christianity.
It may be argued that, far from creating an international spirit,
the British Empire has done no more than propagate an evil
nationalism. During the last half-century, the charge may hold
good. But by its work of Europeanization, of which, indeed, it is
only the foremost exponent, it has laid a common ground on which
the peoples of the world may find the basis of international
concord. This also, on a lesser territorial scale, did
Constantinople accomplish. Within her walls mingled all the races
of Eurasia, and all their products, commercial, cultural,
philosophical. And even now, after all her centuries of misfortune,
the same races jostle in Constantinople and the ghost of the old
cosmopolitan ideal pervades the city. For the Greeks she has no
name: she is "[<i>Greek characters</i>]&mdash;the capital." And her
present Greek inhabitants, should the traveler ask their
nationality, are still "[<i>Greek characters</i>]&mdash;Romans" To
them, a precarious 400,000, has the Byzantine identity
descended.</p>

<p>It is widely believed that the Anglo-Saxon political ideal,
lately swallowed undigested by the world, affords the greatest
promise to any people of internal strength. In so far as
generalization is possible, this ideal may be termed a perpetual
seeking to readjust the equilibrium which enables the state to care
for the interests of the individual without prejudice to its own.
Failure to maintain this equilibrium must result either in
disruption, as in the case of the Roman Empire, or in the forging
of hard, aggressive political units, such as Europe has endured
ever since. In the light of this ideal, the internal structure of
the Byzantine state bears, if not a physiognomic likeness, a
singular affinity to that of ourselves: the same equilibrium, if by
different means, is held; the difference in means arising from the
fact that instead of, as with us, developing compactly as a
manifestation of national life, this equilibrium was the result of
two diverse and opposite forces. For the internal strength of the
Byzantine Empire was attained by the imposition of a supremely
practical machinery of government upon the most individualistic
people on earth.</p>

<p>The previous chapter has attempted to analyze that satirical
element in Greek character which must always ensure democracy
wherever there are communities of Greeks, and has always prevented
the arising of those aristocratic and priestly caste systems, which
have only, during the last twenty years, ceased to be the
inevitable outcome of the search for Stability in the older
continents. The Byzantine state does not, it must be admitted,
present at first sight a democratic complexion. But it may be borne
in mind that the Greeks, while able to discern in all men the
failings that make all men equal, are capable of an almost
superstitious veneration for traditions and institutions. It was
this faculty, already permeated, in the fourth and fifth centuries
CE, with the deeper and more austere mysticism of the Aramean
peoples, which enabled them to accept and consolidate the Eastern
conception of sovereignty that beat like a strong man's heart for
eleven centuries within the walls of Constantinople. The Emperor,
ruling or fighting, was the viceregent of God; to God he was
responsible. But he was also a man, and as such, bound by the laws
of his other self's making. The support of the people was given not
to his person, but his office, to his crown, his scepter, and the
mystical procession of his days. In their eyes, the partition or
even usurpation of his functions was justified by the subsequent
success of the usurper. Further, the Emperor was in theory, and
frequently in fact, chosen by election, by the Senate, the Army,
and the People in the Hippodrome. Equally might this triple
ratification be revoked. The balance between individualism and
political efficiency in the Byzantine state was maintained by an
Oriental autocracy, fettered by a Roman bureaucracy, and supported
by a Greek democracy. And it may be doubted whether the
Mediterranean peoples will ever evolve a better system of
government. Contemporary events seem to show that it is only the
non-political temperament of the Northern races, which can
withstand the dissensions of parties and parliaments.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Thus, in its relations both with subjects and tributaries, was
the stability of the Empire based on principles such as our own. In
the transcendental sphere the affinity is harder of definition. It
may perhaps be expressed in the quality of discontent with the
material aspect of things, which is common to both. In the mind of
medieval West, man existed only in terms of theology, in his
relation to God. Though the Byzantines were the parents of that
mind, they themselves, in constant communion with the classics,
never wholly lost sight of man's rational dignity. In the West,
after the Renaissance and the Reformation, such was the reaction,
that only the rational remained&mdash;to bring, ultimately, the
scientific revolution. But it is science, in its revelation of the
irrational, that has again revived for us the compromise enjoyed by
the Byzantines. Certainly our determination of man has not reverted
to the theological. But it recognizes and fosters man's aspirations
to discover the Spirit and Reality of his world. What the Byzantine
sought through Christ, we may through a mathematical
rationalization of the intuitions. The goal is the same. Had
Christianity remained as the Byzantines perfected it, and not been
distorted by the common sense of the Latin peoples and the
romantics of the Northern, it might have merged harmoniously with
the present mode of thought. That now is not possible. But if the
errant soul of the twentieth century is to gauge the extent of its
predecessors' achievement, the ungrudging recognition of
Christianity's service in rescuing man from the earthen fetters of
classicism is essential. The Byzantines and all their works were
consecrated to the dominion of soul over mind. We and ours too. But
the mind was to them, and should be for us, the instrument of its
own subordination. This precept Western Europe has never, hitherto,
accepted.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>More plainly, however, than in the stable and transcendental
elements of a civilization, it is in its culture that is reflected
with greatest prospect of endurance for posterity, its character,
and the personality of its people. And nowhere is the affinity
between Constantinople and the early industrial era of the
twentieth century more easily visible than in the provinces of art
and architecture. Against the ponderous complacence of classicism,
the stationed symmetry, the reasoned representation; against the
whole implied negation of the beyond and the before; there rises in
the two parallel ages a quest of movement and emotional expression,
which bursts the confinement of capital and cornice, and spurns the
suave contours of rotund boys and bolstered urns. This vigor
derives in one case from Christianity, in the other from science,
each the new force of its time, carrying Reason to the service of
the irrational. Form and technique, moreover, both the Byzantine
and the modern have sought, not locally, but universally, not from
set canons of proportion and preconceived ideas of grace, but from
the whole multitude of methods of artistic expression with which
the scope of their influence has brought them in contact.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from the squat bulk of St. Sophia to the windows
of a modern block of offices. Yet the breath of both carries the
eye away to a suggestion of something beyond the material
substances of brick and stone and the fashioning of human hands. In
a classical building the vision of the beholder, moving up the
pillars, is brought gradually to rest by the projecting
encrustations of the capital, to be finally deflected to earth by
the sharp edge of the cornice. In a Byzantine, though superficially
many of the forms are inherited, the capital is expressly carved to
carry the eye on upward, and there is no cornice. Inside and out,
in all the buildings of the Empire, from the great domed mass of
St. Sophia to the fortified monasteries of Athos, the hint of
perpendicular activity persists. Only in Tibet, which shares with
the latter the distinction of political theocracy in the twentieth
century, is analogy forthcoming. The cardinal importance of the
subordination of all external ornament to the passage of the eye is
exemplified, for contemporaries, in the town hall at Stockholm or,
on a lesser scale, in the Cenotaph in Whitehall.</p>

<p>From the East also arrived, in the train of Christianity, the
art of interpreting form; which not only rendered Byzantines the
most perfect artificers of pattern that have ever been; but enabled
them, in relief, mosaic and painting, to substitute an expressed
insight into the symbolism of the object portrayed for the
prevalent surface representation of the Hellenistic era. The
apotheosis of this method was reached in the paintings of Domenicos
Theotocopoulos, commonly known as El Greco. And by him, alone
favored to carry the thousand-year-old artistic tradition of
Constantinople to fruition, has been expressed more absolutely than
by any other artist, that elusive constancy of things which the
twentieth century has set itself to recapture. All art and all
science seeks ultimately what cannot be attained. If Greco, the
Byzantine, has reached further than his fellows, let the present
age congratulate itself that, in contrast to its predecessors, it
does at least hold the goal in sight.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Thus, in terms of the three elements of civilization, is the
Byzantine affinity with ourselves revealed. The sympathies of a new
era, in which nationalism, dogmatism, and classicism have ceased to
hold all the field, reveal a forgotten light in the past. But it is
not merely that the light has lain hid in gentle obscurity, that
the memory of the old Greek Empire had lapsed, after 1453, into
beneficent oblivion. In the whole annals of the world's history
there has survived the record of no civilization which has been
subject to such conscious misinterpretation as the Byzantine. The
gall of that jealous and illiberal culture, which fastened on
Europe as the backwash of the Renaissance, has been loosed upon
that which it cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>This attitude of prejudice in the Western mind dates originally
from medieval times, product of that fortress of rational outlook,
the Roman Church. In 1054, the papal legates laid their anathema on
the altar of St. Sophia. Thenceforth, in the eyes of the West, the
followers of the Orthodox Church were heretics who had disrupted
the spiritual lordship of the Pope in Rome. Forty years later, in
the guise of the first crusade, the Eastern Empire was invaded by
the vast host of beggars, dotards, prostitutes, and children that
had flocked to the call of Peter the Hermit. At their head rode the
freebooting chivalry of Europe, to implant a retrograde feudalism
and hostile Church in the ancient territories of the Byzantine
dominion. Throughout the twelfth century the armies of Western
Europe appeared and reappeared, ravaging where they trod. The
cultured and civilized Greeks, contemptuous and resentful, remained
aloof. And such cross-bedizened champions as survived the disasters
of Asia Minor, jealous of the prosperous life of the Empire,
returned to fill Western Europe with tales of the perfidy and
treachery of the schismatics of Constantinople. "Those who were not
for us were against us," was the cry. Thenceforth, an odium has
attached to the Byzantines which has augmented rather than
diminished with time.</p>

<p>With the close of the Middle Ages, intellectual progress was
diverted to the channels prescribed by the classical model. While
the lamps of Hellas glowed once more, and provincial Athens,
conveniently inaccessible, assumed an unfamiliar eminence as the
former nursery of human perfection, Greek civilization and its
capital had disappeared from the horizon. But not for always. In
1734 the sluice gates were opened by Montesquieu's <i>Causes de la
Grandeur des Romains et leur D&eacute;cadence.</i> And in 1776
there appeared the first volume of Gibbon's <i>History of the
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.</i></p>

<p>As a master of historical technique, Gibbon is without equal. By
means of his torrential style, his restrained impropriety, and the
incomparable sarcasm of his attacks upon the bore of his own and
others' adolescence, Christianity, he has made history an
entertainment to more people than any single man. Simultaneously,
he has achieved another superlative distinction. Accurate in every
statement of his work, there has lived no individual writer
responsible for a greater volume of inferential falsehood than he.
Since his advent, successive generations have sincerely subscribed
to his view that the most important civilization previously evolved
in Europe was no more than a Decline and a Fall. Of all histories,
that of Constantinople is least capable of biographical treatment.
Following his method, there might be compiled with equal regard for
fact and disdain of truth, a chronicle of the American continent
from the sexual shortcomings of transatlantic presidents, fortified
by an implicit belief in the veracity of the Hearst press.</p>

<p>The achievement, apart from the affinity with the present, of
Byzantine civilization, may be summarized in two relations: to its
people, and to us.</p>

<p>To its people, politically, the Empire stood, a valid organism
for all but nine centuries; and a courageous organism still for two
more. Not once during that time did the form of government change.
Of the 88 occupants of the imperial throne, 66 ascended by regular
procedure. And of the 22 usurpers, the majority followed one
another over small periods of years, which comprised only temporary
interludes in the peaceful working of the whole.</p>

<p>Spiritually, it is doubtful whether there has ever existed, over
so long a period of time, so large a proportion of men and women,
under one government, deeply and sincerely anxious to maintain
communion with their God at all moments of their lives. Ethically,
public opinion did not necessarily, as in Northern countries,
ostracize those who did not conform to its standards.</p>

<p>Culturally Byzantine intellect evolved, in painting and mosaic,
a technique of color and delineation, which envisaged the
experiences of the soul as none has done before or since. An
essential austerity developed, which a lavish profusion of splendid
materials could never deflect; and which, combined with largeness
of general conception, produced, in St. Sophia, one of the supreme
pinnacles of architecture.</p>

<p>For ourselves, ushers of a universal civilization, the Empire
also stood for 1123 years, a solitary bulwark against the peoples
of Asia which threatened, if they broke through, to extinguish that
civilization. How nearly, indeed, they might have succeeded was
illustrated afterwards by the two sieges of Vienna and by the two
centuries of warfare which stunted the development of central
Europe and were the direct result of the disaster of 1453. While
Western Europe was assimilating the negative, nomadic forces that
broke upon the West Roman Empire, Constantinople was combating the
positively destructive impetus unloosed by Mohammed in the seventh
century. Throughout, she retained intact the great codifications of
Roman law, to the revived study of which at Bologna in the eleventh
century, the majority of European legal systems owe their
existence.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="pt2"></a>Part 2. The Anatomy</h2>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-4"></a>Chapter 4. The Triple Fusion</h3>

<p>There is in man an innate tendency to accentuate his
consciousness of the particular units of society to which he may
belong. In schools and universities, where the darkest elements of
human nature are at large, rigid groups of students look askance at
those who go their way untrammeled with the conventions of others.
From the earliest times, promoters of vice for profit have been
relegated to the further side of an imaginary, if salutary pale.
Until recently, Christians of one belief could scarcely endure
contact with those of another. Associations of employers and
employees continue to erect canons of behavior as exclusive as
those of the medieval guilds.</p>

<p>The ultimate and commonest expression of this instinct has been
racial; and its fate, in this respect, political exploitation. In
the mind of the West European and his transoceanic
offspring&mdash;even, lately, of his transoceanic
subject&mdash;separate nationality demands separate political
existence. It was this creed to which the arbiters of post-war
reformation at the beginning of the twentieth century were pledged.
The occasion to coordinate racial with political individuality over
vast territories, where such a theory had been formerly unknown,
was hailed with rejoicing. Britain in particular, throned on her
strawberry empire, could survey with a tingle of virtuous triumph
the kaleidoscope of less favored <i>terra firma.</i> So it has
happened that, towards the proper understanding of those areas
where unfortunate peoples have been obliged, in self-defense, to
adopt the hypotheses of Western nationalism and endure the
sufferings that inevitably attend its expansion, the way, which was
dark to nineteenth-century statesmen, and black to twentieth,
threatens to lapse from human comprehension altogether.</p>

<p>The process in question first took effect as an off-shoot of the
French Revolution, as a bastard sister of Liberty. Its immediate
field was the Levant; its action, that of a spark to the gunpowder
of economic fodder which the Turks called subject races. As the
nineteenth century progressed, Serbs, Bulgars, and Rumanians,
encouraged by the achievements of Bismarck and Garibaldi, emerged
in emulation of the Greeks. Eventually came the Great War and the
disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. For the Greek world there
remained one final separation of races. This was in Thrace and
Anatolia. Accomplished, with unrecorded suffering, it was. Yet
however complete the execution of that hellish experiment borrowed
at Lausanne from the political stock-in-trade of Tamerlane, the
exchange of populations, the old forces, if momentarily in
abeyance, can never have been extinguished. Trade routes flow. The
city stands. There is wealth in the earth. One people dies while
another lives. But the cipher of past and future lies far back, in
one of those rare occasions when the currents of history have been
quickened by the sagacity of a moment. In that moment, the Levant
assumed more concrete shape than its own romance; Byzantine
civilization arose; and there came into being a latent force which,
four centuries after that civilization's extinction, could still
enable the most inept of human races to uphold the skeleton of its
political idea. The Ottoman Empire was the Byzantine Empire;
Constantinople the heart of each. On that site today, in the midst
of high pressure, the balance of jealousy creates a void.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>

<p>During the three centuries that followed its inauguration by
Augustus, the Roman Empire had displayed but small vitality in two
out of the three cardinal elements of civilization. Heaped within
the vast embrace of a single law, the countries of the
Mediterranean, and those adjacent, and yet again adjacent to them,
lay passive beneath the heterogeneous vapor of ideas, arts and
cults which swirled from Chester to Baghdad, dropping here,
gathering there, but ponderous, derivative, and fruitless as a herd
of mules. Culture had turned already to the past, gloating on the
Attic model, and for art boasting the advance of copyists.
Stability there was; indeed, it has been said that until the advent
of trains, European travel was easier in that age than ever before
or since. Then that, too, waned. Now the walls of the container
threatened to burst: first from within, then without. Legions
mutinied, Goths and Parthians rumbled. But towards the end of the
third century, movements in the new chaos bespoke the birth of new
order. East and West had fought. They had mingled. Now they were to
fuse. The hard steel of vital civilization was imminent. But the
base of the alloy was neither East nor West. It was upon a
foundation of Hellenic culture and Hellenic sense, that the
well-being of soul and body, genius of Semite and Roman, found
union. Thus the three spheres, Western, Oriental, and Hellenic,
were respectively identified with the stable, the transcendental,
and the cultural elements of the new civilization. And it was in
the realization, anticipated by Julius Caesar, that the
Greek-speaking coasts of the Aegean were the true kernel of the
Hellenistic Roman Empire and the chief source of vitality, that the
greatness of Constantine's change of capital lay.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>To the measure of political stability enjoyed by the Roman
Empire in the opening years of the fourth century, the Hellenic
contribution, viewed in light of Constantine's impending
orientation, had been considerable. The political experience of the
Greeks was profound. From monarchy, through oligarchy and tyranny,
to democracy, they had evolved the inherent national opinion that
politics were every man's business. Further, to the years of this
evolution, four or five centuries before Christ, the world owes its
whole terminology of political thought and science. But it was
precisely in these, when translated from word to fact, that the
Greeks had failed. The eternal search for a rule of thumb, so
successfully pursued in ethics, geometry, and art, fell short in
the practical struggle with everyday affairs. It needed Alexander
and the formation of an empire overseas to test the real vitality
of the city-state as a political organism. The center lapsed. But
the great cities of Egypt and Asia Minor maintained an independent
existence, flourishing municipalities resembling in character the
industrial towns of today; till we read, as of New York or New
Delhi, that they were better planned, with broad, straight streets,
than the old towns of the parent country. It was upon this
foundation of Greek municipal life, that the conquests of Pompey
and Lucullus were built into the Roman Empire. While the
inhabitants of Hellas proper, repelled by the uniform vulgarity of
the Roman world, had long relapsed into lethargic though
gentlemanly contemplation of the past; while Athens was already
provincial and tourist-ridden; Greek life, as the West Roman Empire
drew to its close, still retained its vigor in the further
cities&mdash;a vigor generated by the ceaseless flow of fresh
conceptions from the East. With the tread of Goth and Visigoth
already in the ear, did not Byzantium promise to become the
nucleus, not only of art, intellect, and spirit, but of trade and
security as well?</p>

<p>This was the Greek foundation of the stable element. The
superstructure was Roman, and the cupola Asiatic.</p>

<p>Upon the victory of Augustus at Actium in 31 BCE, the first
phase of Roman imperialism, that of expansion, was over. With
Caesar now at the center, removed above parties and factions, a new
system of centralization came into being. Governors and officials
in the provinces were made more fully responsible to Rome. Taxation
was revised on the basis of a land- and population-census. Even the
senate of the capital was reduced to no more than a constitutional
ornament. In every department, the reins were annexed to the
Emperor and his household. From this date, and mainly as an outcome
of the latter institution, evolved the marvel of Roman bureaucracy,
the engine which never faltered till its destruction by the
crusaders in 1204. And immediately the career open to talent, which
it offered, became largely the prize of a Greek personnel.</p>

<p>But from the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161-180), the Empire
found itself on the defensive. Centralization, now excessive, had
rendered the machinery more unwieldy than two and sometimes three
Caesars could administer. The extinction of local patriotism left
the burdens of local government to fall wholly on the center. The
pseudo-robotlike civilization had flowered and was blown. Education
was expensive, yet unproductive of intellectual development; there
were philosophies and cults, but no exercise for the soul. Already
in the second century CE, a culture as arid and derivative as that
of the eighteenth, was universal. Contemporary with this
desiccation, civil wars within and frontier wars without were
placing insupportable strain upon an administration designed for
consolidation rather than defense. Collapse was averted by
Diocletian, who ascended the throne in 248.</p>

<p>The half century that followed was momentous. It witnessed the
close of the classical era, and prefaced, by its reorganization,
the opening of another. As an age of transition it was an age of
suffering. The spiritual ferment of the East, the infusion of life
into the withering veins of the Empire, were as blood circulating
in a frostbitten limb. Fortunately for the course of man's
progression, the physicians proved equal to their patient.</p>

<p>Diocletian's work took the form of decentralization and
stabilization. Rome, which had already lost its capital and
economic importance, was abandoned as the home of the
administration; and the Empire was divided into four great
compartments, the officials of which were now interposed between
the provincial governors and the Emperor. Taxation was
redistributed with a view to complete uniformity, assessments being
computed not on the acreage, but the productive value, of land. As
a kind of permanent guarantee of the state revenues, all ranks of
society were made compulsorily hereditary. Children of free
laborers were wedded to the soil, thus rendering possible the
semi-feudal Byzantine land-tenure of the future. Similarly,
membership of the trade and craft-guilds passed henceforth from
father to son. Even the burden of unpaid local government was
forced on the shoulders of unwilling descendants. But these reforms
took effect mainly in the East Mediterranean lands, at the center
of gravity. And thus it was that, during the whole labor of mental
and political rebirth which shook the ensuing century, those lands,
in contrast with the West, stood firm. Finally, and, in the light
of succeeding events, most far-reaching of all, was achieved the
hitherto inconceivable separation of the civil and military
authorities. Stationary frontier troops were retained. But the main
army was now transformed into a mobile force, no longer local in
its sympathies, which could be hurried from one end of the Empire
to the other as necessity demanded. In this central fighting
weapon, even after the first Mohammedan incursions had compelled
the Isaurian Emperors to the reorganization of the themes under
military governors, was to lie the infinite superiority of
Byzantine arms over all others. Here also was an example that every
state in the world was sooner or later to copy.</p>

<p>Above, however, the mere sequence of edicts that led the stark
structure of Roman government to its last reformation, there stands
that salient gift to posterity, the Roman law. Growth already of
many centuries, though not finally perfected till between the years
450 and 564, this supreme outcome of the practical Roman mind was
destined to prove the one continuous link between the ancient world
and the modern. Its genius had arisen, in the beginning, from the
ability to distinguish between Roman national custom and the
general principles of justice applicable to all mankind. Put under
way by the <i>Jus Gentium,</i> its scope had expanded with the
Empire; and its cosmopolitanism with the increasing clarification
of the general principles on which it was based. Here, of all
others, was a quantity calculated to evoke the admiration of
strangers and the respect of subjects, especially when the latter
were invited to reap its benefits. In conjunction with the
bureaucracy, it constituted the whole keystone of Byzantine
political stability.</p>

<p>Thus, upon the municipal remnant of Alexander's Hellenistic
Empire, Roman organization and Roman law created stability, first
essential of civilization. As the new forces, Christianity from the
East, the tightened hierarchies of society from the West, marched
to their long embrace, one space at the peak remained for the
political contribution of the East. This was the definition of
imperial sovereignty. A God above, though nebulous quantity enough
to Diocletian, was in the air. The Emperor must strengthen his
position here below. Accordingly, the title of "Lord;" the diadem,
and the salutation by prostration were borrowed from Persia, as
Alexander had borrowed them before. And court ritual, the whole of
that divinity, today rendered doubly subtle by democracy, that
hedges a king, was perpetuated for the future entertainment of
Europe. Constantine, proclaiming himself viceregent and vicegerent
of an individual God, carried the idea to its logical conclusion.
And it was not long before the Patriarch of Constantinople, in
imitation of the Magian high priest, customarily performed the
coronation ceremony.</p>

<p>In estimating human achievement, alike in thought and science,
politics and the arts, there applies one infallible test of
greatness, which invites comparison between the most distant
extremes of creation and research. This test, relevant year by
year, century by century, so long as the race endures, demands
simply, now of yesterday, now across vast interims of time: in what
proportion has this or that advanced man towards a further
comprehension of Reality, of that "likeness amid diversity" which
transcends the world of touch and see, and the conscious quest of
which constitutes man's distinction from the ape and gives
plausible argument to the theory of progress. In no matter which
province of human activity, from each step in the comprehension of
the soul's affinities, must result a further expression of them;
from each step in expression, a further accessibility to lesser
intellects, an advance in the general comprehension of them. Thus
the ultimate, like gravity a glacier, draws us slowly down the
ages.</p>

<p>But for those lesser intellects, for the great majority of
humanity, whose preoccupation with mundane affairs demands the
presentation of a ready-made and intelligible abstract, the
approach to the eternal problem lies not through the panpsychology
of all things and all times, but through the isolated medium of
religion. Religion, if restricted in horizon, is not blind; it
pursues simply the perpetual search through the single most
straightforward channel. Whether it advance in the van or the rear
of contemporary thought, science, politics or art, they are infused
with the extent of its progress as it with theirs. And it has, in
fact, happened that the most formidable power ever generated to
assist man in his quest, the power vital over the longest
succession of years and in the greatest number of hearts, has been
a religion. Though it may seem in the present that its course is
run, subtract Christianity from the past, and what remains? The dry
sediment of classicism, insensible to the before and the beyond,
conscious only of its protracted minute on the clock of perpetuity.
Towards perpetuity's end, towards that station where the rails meet
and the attainment of the unattainable sifts the abiding from the
transient, the acceptance of Christianity by the classical world
was the furthest step humanity ever took. The coincidence of the
Edict of Milan with the foundation of Constantinople, due to the
sagacity, rather than inspiration, of one man, produced both modern
and Byzantine civilizations. It is therefore of interest to
discover what flux of intellectual phenomena could have confirmed
the validity of so momentous a decision; and whence were spun the
multitude of threads that Christianity wove to itself, and whereby
it found passage to the hearts of its new and unresisting
adherents.</p>

<p>The frame, upon which the profuse metaphysical speculations of
the Roman Mediterranean spluttered to extinction, was the Hellenic
subscription to the wholesale efficacy of Reason. With the products
of that Reason a primary education in the humanities has rendered
us familiar. But of its limitations, of the vacua into which the
theology of Eastern mystics rushed like cold air when the hot has
lifted, it has hitherto been customary to profess ignorance.</p>

<p>The essence, the fundamental mood of all Greek thought, lay in
the problem of the immediate present, in the quest of an <i>ars
vivendi.</i> Upon this confined, unteleological aspect of
existence, the idea of man's spiritual purpose seldom intruded. God
was merely a convenient focus for the inexplicable, to be plotted
and defined as this or that brand of philosophy demanded. Further,
the whole pursuit of "well-being" was based on a shortsighted
rationalism which assumed that once man was aware of his true
interests, he must be incapable of action contradictory to them.
Hence the grotesque slogan "Virtue is knowledge"; the implicit
belief in the panacea of truth; and the consequent distrust of all
instinct and all compromise, the major conditionals of any <i>ars
vivendi.</i> This elevation of the mind to supreme control will
inevitably find supporters in that class of persons who are more
concerned with intellectual processes than the goals to which they
lead. But in the majority of human beings, the speculative faculty
is either absent or subordinate. Among the masses of the Roman
Empire, Greek thought, the kingdom of the mind, had never wholly
conquered.</p>

<p>There flourished, however, during the three centuries that
separated Christ's birth from his acceptance by Constantine, two
schools of philosophers whose doctrines, each of Greek origin, held
paramount importance in the ancient world. These were the Stoics
and the Neoplatonists. Each contributed, both in concrete idea and
in psychological preparation of the ground, to the eventual triumph
of Christianity.</p>

<p>The Stoics, though still obsessed with the theory that man could
not act contrary to his reason, did at length succeed, as Socrates
had foreshadowed, in investing ethics with a definition independent
of mere service to the state. For them, moreover, "God" assumed
concrete meaning in abstract terminology, as a species of universal
force, of which the soul was but a spark at exercise within the
human clay, and the vehicle of homage to the whole. This insistence
on the ubiquity of God was reflected in their conception of the
human race as one cosmopolitan brotherhood. Through this, combined
with the enunciation of a practical morality and an almost Rotarian
doctrine of service to others, they forcibly appealed to the mental
state disseminated by Roman rule, in which efficiency stood
foremost among the virtues. It is clear, from the most cursory
examination of their tenets, that the practical principles which
Christianity was to popularize among the masses, were largely of
their determining.</p>

<p>It was to the other and mystical side of the new religion that
Neoplatonism, last, and as an evolutionary link, most significant,
in the cycles of Greek thought, contributed. This philosophy,
originating in Roman Alexandria was born of a definite contact with
the East, in the form of advanced Judaism and early Christianity,
which enabled it to develop the germ of Plato's un-Greek and
perhaps involuntary mystical experience. Its portentous feat, and
one which stands alone in the classical world, was the renunciation
of the supremacy of the rational for that of the suprarational. The
very existence, implicit in the process of reasoning, of divergent
opinion, seemed to demand an Absolute removed from the infinity of
human disagreement. To this Absolute, invested by Plotinus with a
more compact, individual quality than Plato's common factor to all
material phenomena, approach was possible by experience rather than
thought, by a process of contemplation that should ultimately lead
the soul to escape from the shame of its imprisonment and to
self-identification with Reality. This was the first clear denial
of the fallacy, which formerly excused suicide, that balm to an
aching heart must be sought from the intellect. But in common with
all Greek thought, Neoplatonism lacked means to attract the masses,
the personality of a founder or the offer of celestial reward. And
eventually lapsing, despite their affinity, into conflict with
Christianity, it fell back upon the tradition that it had itself
discredited and developed a kind of bastard rationalism, which
flourished amid the provincial conservatism of Athens till the
closing of the pagan academy in the sixth century. But the affinity
in the beginning was real enough. In the Neoplatonic appreciation
of the suprarational one of the landmarks in the general advance in
human vision wrought by Christianity was already erect. But for
Neoplatonism, and in a lesser degree Stoicism, it is doubtful
whether the new religion would ever have gained force to transform
the ancient world into the modern.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the material platform on which Hellenic mind and
Eastern soul were to find espousal, the stability of Roman
institutions and the consequent cosmopolitanism of mental
intercourse, was playing a part, if a somewhat negative one, in the
universal crystallization of new idea. Originally, in the
unimaginative mind of the early Roman, religion and law sprang from
the same source, the former being no more than a series of
contracts between man and his not very august divinities. But the
outstanding quality of the religious element in Roman mentality was
its receptivity. Just as, in the legal sphere, there was never a
custom containing a germ of right principle that the Romans did not
assimilate, so in the religious, there was no worship which they
were not willing to incorporate in their own system of civic
observance, provided it did not run counter to the interests of the
state, as Christianity at first seemed liable to do. Hence, not
only were the later philosophies so widely popularized that wealthy
families were in the habit of maintaining Greek dialecticians in
their households as private "chaplains," but the cults of North
Africa and the East, with their strange gods and strange rites,
were publicly acknowledged. Foremost and typical among them was the
worship of Mithras, of which memorials have been found even in
Scotland. When it is remembered that this ubiquitous cult, besides
preaching morality and fraternity, incorporated in its legend the
flood, the ark, the adoration and the shepherds; in its teaching,
Heaven and Hell, the atoning sacrifice, the last judgment, and the
resurrection; and in its observance, the use of holy water, the
ceremony of administering communion, and the sanctification of
Sunday and December 25th; it is reasonable to suppose that, just as
the last manifestations of classical philosophy had prepared the
way for Christianity among the educated, so had the religions of
Persia and Egypt among the masses. This was the result not only of
indirect infiltration, but of official Roman acquiescence in the
transportation of cults from one part of the Empire to another. And
it was largely by this means that there evolved a further important
condition of Christianity's acceptance: the universal desire in
high and low, educated and illiterate alike, for the promise, in
definite terms, of resurrection and afterlife.</p>

<p>Having considered, therefore, the trend of both thought and
desire during the Hellenistic age, it remains to discover which
exactly were those rare and distinctive aspects of approach to the
eternal problem, that enabled a small and oppressed Semitic people
to change the face of the earth. Christ can have known little of
Neoplatonism or Mithras; he was a Jew, product of Jews, and last of
their prophets. But in the tradition of his people and his own
words, there was disclosed a bridge to the Absolute, plain of
entrance and plain of traverse, which could guide the least of
intellects, and inspire the highest, to its path. Thus, where
ancient Europe had failed, where the masses had been left to
superstition, and the educated to speculation, the East stepped in
to demand allegiance to a faith that was neither cult nor sense,
and to preach, in return, the first principles of loving
democracy.</p>

<p>Yet in essence the new revelation was already old&mdash;old as
Abraham and Ur of the Chaldees, older by a thousand years than the
first Greek reflection on earth's components. While Plato and
Aristotle were groping the ladder of logic towards an impersonal
God conceived on the lines of a clandestine broadcasting station,
the Jews, voiced by their prophet-chroniclers, were building from
their religious experience a permanent distinction between the
motives and conceptions of man, and those of the parental, if
terrible, Force of his restraint. Their God, single and undistorted
by artistic reproduction, was the chiefest inheritance of the race.
Let the race walk, then, by this, its own light. "But take heed,"
replied the Hellene and the Latin, to whom St. Paul's explanations
were consecrated, "that the light within thee is not darkness." In
each individual temperament, it is the same battle fought from the
beginning: soul against mind. In so far as the two joined forces,
there lay the scope without limit of Christianity's appeal. But
once the mind became again predominant, as happened after the
schism of the Churches, the revival of Aristotle, and the shifting
of religious gravity to Italy, the decline of Christianity, which
the Reformation could only retard, had begun.</p>

<p>The main theme of Judaism, which Christ in the end perfected and
advertised, was the emanation from God of a divine code of ethics
to which man, in token of his faith in God, must subscribe. It was
this demand for the allegiance of the soul, rather than the
intelligence, which characterized all Eastern thought and was,
centuries later, to give Mohammedanism its force. This faith of the
East was translated to the West by Christ. But the transformation
wrought by him alone, apart from his tradition, lay in his
investiture of the Absolute with the qualities of love and bounty.
The conception of the great Affinity as emanating conscious, indeed
personal, beneficence towards the mortal prisons of the lesser,
beckoned to its focus all the kindred ideas and symbols scattered
through the philosophies and cults of the Empire.
"High-mindedness;' so persistently advocated by ancient
philosophers, found itself in contact with humility, the sense of
human guilt, hitherto a fourth dimension to the Greek world. The
humanitarianism which was to form so contrasting a feature of
Byzantine life beside the barbarism of the medieval West was
already in the air. And it was here that danger seemed to threaten.
What effect might love exercise on the stability of the state?</p>

<p>From time to time throughout the classical era, thinkers such as
the Stoics had attempted to place ethics on the level of an
independent science. But this idea of guiding the course of life by
an abstract study of conduct took little hold on the catholic
mentality of the average man. For the inhabitant of the classical
world, the ideal of conduct remained, first and foremost, the ideal
of service to society. And of all the immediate revolutions brought
about by the general acceptance of Christianity, the most
absolutely radical was the substitution of service, not to society,
but to God. Hitherto, the vision of a personal Absolute had implied
theocracy or nothing. The words <i>"Render therefore unto Caesar
the things which are Caesar's: and unto God the things which are
God's,"</i> lit the supreme compromise out of all the many
compromises that were now fusing East and West for the conquest of
the world. And it was Constantine, seeing everywhere the love of
God replacing that of Caesar, who took the motto and acted upon it.
Under this auspice, Constantinople was created. While politics
endure and the goal of man eludes, such is sacramental import of
that city, of all it did, and of all it has left. Under this
diarchy of Caesar and God, the Greeks and those within their
sphere, obtained a content never vouchsafed to the West. Other than
the Byzantines, there was never a people who, during a thousand
years of unaltered political existence, consecrated their lives
with a like conscience to the joint rendering to Caesar and God of
each his things.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>At the first halt beneath the prodigious, misty hemisphere of
St. Sophia; at the first glitter of sapphire in Galla Placidia's
mausoleum; at the sparse sophistication of an imperial sarcophagus;
at the golden haze of St. Mark's; at any first encounter with
Byzantine art, there forms in the beholder a conviction of profound
novelty, a novelty born not of its foreign qualities, but of the
vast complexity, wrought into order and restraint, of its emotional
and intellectual mold. While in literature, save for such scattered
exceptions as the hunting epic of <i>Digenis Akritas,</i> the
creative powers of the Byzantine were negatived by an excessive
appreciation of the past; while in thought, the access to both
Hellenic philosophy and Aramean theology, a combination unknown to
contemporary Europe, seemed for the most part so amply sufficient
as to render superfluous any additions to the beliefs of successive
last generations; and while in science the wisdom of the ancient
world was conserved and utilized for everyday purposes, rather than
increased; in art and architecture, the Byzantines, for those who
measure the value of human activity in terms of a divine quest,
took strides of incalculable importance, not only in the light of
their actual productions, but in their relationship to the whole
cultural advance of Europe. Having now, in an age of vigorous
movement, discarded the spectacles of classicism for the telescope
of historical perspective, it is possible to determine, first the
sources whence the essential novelty of Byzantine art arose; and
once again, in what proportion did Hellas, Rome, and that nebulous
quantity, "the East;" contribute to this last and most pleasurable
element in Byzantine civilization.</p>

<p>The basic structure, such as grammar is to language, of the art
of New Rome, was Hellenic. The Hellenic genius lay in two
qualities; a capacity for material representation and a sense of
composition. Of these provinces in art, the monuments of Ancient
Greece have remained the unchallenged masterpieces. But essential
place as representation and composition occupy in the whole of art,
and their Greek manifestations in Western art, there is
nevertheless a major quality. This lies in the expression, not of
the recorded image, but of the emotion provoked by it, in the
communication to the beholder of some spark of the inspiration
which is every man's creed and birthright, but which the artist
alone by his trade can bring to light. This aim, in the archaic
period, the Greeks may have held in mind. Subsequently, confused by
the wealth of their own technical ability, they failed either to
pursue or to retain it.</p>

<p>Intent as always on the world around them, the Greeks had
evolved a skill in the reproduction of the human form which even
this age of scientific triumph has not equaled. The influence of
their achievement, hitherto only faintly foreshadowed in Egypt,
became manifest in the art of every race between the Atlantic and
the Pacific. Its significance can compare only with such inventions
as bronze alloy or Edward H's Parliament, destined to inaugurate
fresh epochs in the world's history. But the Greeks were obsessed,
atrophied, by their own overwhelming sense of balance and
proportion. It was this, with the development of naturalistic
ability, that degenerated into an irresistible desire to please, to
idealize the material with a shallow beauty more fleshy, more
earthen than earth itself. All were sacrificed&mdash;strength,
character, emotion, soul&mdash;to the blasting formulae of grace,
twist of neck and crick of knee, vacuous lip and bridgeless nose.
In architecture, despite the patent crudity of pillar, cornice,
pillar, cornice, the fault was less, the lines might be stronger,
the refinements of some subtlety, as the sun-gilt trunks of the
Parthenon bear witness, and the tenuous white guts of Sunium
equally deny. Nonetheless, for the benefit of future generations,
the essentials remained: the ability of representation, awaiting
its infusion with the suprarational; and the sense of composition,
awaiting rescue from the morass of superficial convention into
which the Periclean sculptors had plunged it eight centuries
before. Furthermore, the intuitive simplicity hitherto so
ruthlessly exploited, was now to prove half the genius of the
Byzantine craftsman. It enabled him, reducing to its lowest terms
the wealth of Oriental and Iranian design at his disposal, to
produce the most meaning, the most restrained, and at the same time
the richest decorative ornament that the world has enjoyed.</p>

<p>If, in the Roman, the instinct towards artistic creation was
restricted by the material aspects of existence, his character has
left nonetheless a definite impress on Byzantine architecture. St.
Sophia, perennial inspiration to the builders of the Near East,
exhibits a magnitude of conception, a determination to enlarge the
tricks of Eastern building to a grandeur in keeping with the
dignity of the Empire, and a practical firmness of design, all of
which were the direct outcome of the Roman tradition. In smaller
spheres, this practicality is still apparent; there is nothing
irrelevant in Byzantine art. Each detail claims relation to the
whole. The huddled, narrative profusion of the East, the suave and
irrelevant artifice of Greece, were fostered into union at the
muscular breast of efficiency. In the process, all but fundamentals
were cast aside.</p>

<p>While classical art was pursuing its impeccable and
unimaginative path, forces in the darkness beyond the Eastern
boundaries were taking shape for their part in the development of
the modern world. Just as the Hellenic pictorial ability, carried
centuries before into the heart of Asia by Alexander, had breached
the prejudice of Buddhism and Mazdaism against representational art
by reason of its proselytizing efficacy, so now it was to fulfill
the same function for Christianity, moving Westward. But
Christianity, however wide its use of this assistance, represented
a cultural force which was not only psychological, but backed by
the concrete technical traditions of the Near East. In that fecund
welter of peoples enclosed between India, Russia, and the
Mediterranean, it is possible to distinguish in this context two
main elements, the Iranian and the Semitic.</p>

<p>Furthest removed from the ultimate scene of fusion was the
Iranian sphere, seated between the Caspian and the Altai Mountains,
and expressing a concurrence, presumed to have happened about zoo
CE, of two nomadic races, the Scythians and the Mongolian Turks.
Hence, it is thought, sprang the rudiments of all Eurasian
geometric design, which were from there distributed in two
divergent streams; one through South Russia to Northern and Western
Europe; the other to the Semitic peoples of Asia Minor, Syria and
Arabia. It was this latter, hitched to the train of Christianity,
that ultimately reached Constantinople and the Mediterranean. And
thus it is that, to the untrained eye, Celtic manuscript
illuminations are scarcely distinguishable from their Byzantine and
Armenian contemporaries. The most significant, however, of the
Iranian bequests was architectural. It was from this source that
the Armenians, who had already adopted Christianity as a state
religion some three decades in advance of the Empire, derived their
method of constructing a round dome over a square bay, which,
during the course of its Westward migration, created St. Sophia,
and ultimately displaced the box-of-bricks construction ofclassical
temples surviving in the basilica. At length, in the ninth century,
the Armenian architect of the Emperor Basil II Bulgaroctonos,
combined the two in a domed and cruciform church, which became the
prototype of all future Orthodox ecclesiastical building, and
eventually of such pretentious temples of later Christianity as St.
Peter's in Rome and St. Paul's in London.</p>

<p>Although the Jews, in all their wanderings and captivities, had,
after the manner of nomads, confined their art to the geometric,
this was not the case with the Semitic races of the interior. For
them an art almost wholly free of Hellenic mannerisms already
portrayed the human form of gods, priests, and kings. And it seems
plain that the representational element in Byzantine art was not
derived from the Greeks alone. In the first century frescoes at
Dura on the middle Euphrates,[*] the flatness of treatment and
emotional use of color, wholly divorced from the portrait paintings
of the Hellenistic Empire, bespeak a fair claim to share in the
ancestry of Byzantine painting. From Mesopotamia, also, came the
new medium, glass mosaic. And it must be remembered that, with one
or two very rare exceptions, the representations of Christ, from
the earliest monuments of his era on, were invariably of the Syrian
type, with black beard and parted hair. Finally, the frown of
thunderous agony and majesty with which the Pantocrator, in the
tall domes of Greek monastery churches, still to this day sets fire
to the innermost crevices of the being, has only perpetuated that
approximation of earthly and divine royalty which was the strongest
motive in Semitic imagination.</p>

<p>Thus, just as mentally the East supplied new means to seek
Reality, in art she did the same. In the symbolism of the geometric
and in the formalization of the represented, even when both were
diverted to the didactic purpose of a centralizing church, there
lurked the germ of a great advance, which has in time affected the
whole earth. That "art translates inward meaning into visible form"
was unknown to the classical world, as it is unknown to the
classicists of today. From the East came the discovery of it.</p>

<blockquote>[* The world's present knowledge of these is confined
to the investigations of a single day during military operations.
An expedition was dispatched thither in 1928 which, it is hoped,
will disclose further information.]</blockquote>

<p>When Constantine, on the defeat and death of Licinius in 323 CE,
found himself at last the triumphant survivor of the numerous
Caesars called into being by the decentralizing experiment of
Diocletian, he must have been, at the age of 49, as widely
travelled as any man in the Empire. Born in Moesia, province of the
modern Serbs and Bulgars, and reared at the court of Nicomedia on
the eastern side of the Marmora, for which city Diocletian had
already forsaken the over-conservative and economically deserted
capital of Italy, it was Constantine's peculiar fortune, after
seeing active service in Persia and Egypt, to be acclaimed Caesar
at York, where his father, Constantine Chlorus, had died while on a
punitive expedition against the Scots. The next six years
Constantine spent in Gaul and Italy; in 312 he captured Rome from
his colleague Maxentius; and in 313, as sole Emperor of the West,
he issued jointly with Licinius of the East, the Edict of Milan,
granting toleration to Christians. The following year saw the
cession to him, by Licinius, of Greece, Illyria, and Pannonia. But
this remaining rival was not finally eliminated till 323, when each
side threw its whole weight into the struggle. The campaign in
question included a naval battle for the passage of the Hellespont
and a siege of Byzantium.</p>

<p>In 326, therefore, if a new capital was to be built, no man was
better qualified than Constantine to choose the site. Rome was
thick with conspiracies; North and West were barbarous or
provincial; primarily it must be in the East: a headquarters
against the Parthians and the ceaseless Westward migrations from
the Steppes; and a focus of trade, of the embryo Christianity
generating in the East, of culture, magnificence, and the amenities
of life. For these, with natural security thrown in, what spot on
Constantine's earth could compare with Byzantium?</p>

<p>As the ship drives over the grey billows of the Black Sea
straight for the long horizon, Asia to the left, Europe to the
right, an opening, distinguishing the two, beckons the way to the
South, to the older, joyous existence, where the hot sun has
hatched man free from the mere struggle to subsist. Seventeen miles
long, in places no wider than 600 yards, this magic creek winds
through a double range of hills, which make the leviathans of ocean
seem as toy boats in a dike and reveal their every detail to the
watchers on their decks. Sometimes downland, sometimes rocky humps,
break the undulating line of trees. At the water's edge, grassy
valleys arrive with streams, which trickle to the sea through
groves of rustling bamboo. The hills are thick with dwarf oaks,
junipers, and bay trees, crowned occasionally with gaunt pines, and
mingled with bracken, giant heath, and yellow flowering broom.</p>

<p>The air grows soft with a distant smell of pinks. There are
signs of habitation, boats and gardens, then the villas and palaces
themselves. Upon a promontory appears the nucleus of a town; in its
foreground an island lighthouse; and beyond, a blue line of open
sea, the Marmora, still enclosed between Europe and Asia, with the
Dardanelles half a day's journey on, leading to the Aegean. The
ship swings to the right, rounds a corner, and comes to anchor in
the Golden Horn, another creek as wide as the Bosporus, but
narrowing quickly and curving back North again as its name implies.
On a triangular peninsula, rising no more than 250 feet from the
Marmora and Golden Horn, with its blunted apex craning northward as
though for a view up the Bosporus, lies Byzantium; at the water's
edge her wharves; at them, the ships fetching and delivering as
bees at their flowers. Natural distributing house of merchandise
from India and China, from Egypt and from Russia; cool, healthy,
and so beautiful as to render life a perpetual holiday; guarded by
narrow approaches, the difficulty of forcing which was fresh in his
memory; such was the position that Constantine had chosen, as he
marched out from the old Greek city already in existence, to mark,
with his own hands, the confines of the new.</p>

<p>Materials for building were forthcoming in the marble of the
Proconnesus, a group of islands in the Marmora, and the wood of
forests bordering the Black Sea. A fever of construction, as though
he were some eighteenth century grandee, devoured the Emperor.
Throughout his dominions, magistrates were bidden found schools and
professorships of architecture. No one residing in Asia Minor might
enter the imperial service unless he possessed a house in the
imperial capital. For the ambitious, the seekers of wealth,
nobility, or martial glory, this henceforth was the world's
metropolis. On May 11th, 330, a solemn ceremony of dedication was
held. From that day to this, the plan of the city and its essential
points of importance have remained unaltered.</p>

<p>Upon the spacious platform of the headland, with its protracted
slopes stretching on one side to the silver blue of the Marmora,
and, on the other, to the deeper, hill-reflected water of the
Golden Horn, the principal buildings stood in proximity. To the
east was the Senate House; to the south, the Great Palace, a huge
cluster of erections reaching amid gardens to the seashore, where
the porphyry pavilion, built for the Empresses to seclude and
empurple the birth of their children, survived for many centuries
as contemporary with the great founder. On the west lay the
elliptical Forum of Constantine. Between it and the sea was the
Hippodrome.</p>

<p>This gigantic theatre, capable of seating 80,000 people and
overlooking both Europe and Asia, was 128 yards wide, 1,000 in
circumference, and over a quarter of a mile in length; its arched
walls, of marble filled with brick, rose tier upon tier 40 feet
from the ground, supporting a colonnade of gigantic marble pillars,
from whose bases the seats sloped down to the arena. The curve of
the western end, overreaching the slope of the land, was supported
on massive vaults, which still survive, and have since been
converted into cisterns. At the other extremity, stood the stables,
and above them the imperial box connected by a private staircase
with the Great Palace. This was adorned with the four horses of
Lysippus, those familiar prancing beasts which miraculously escaped
conversion by the crusaders into specie and were ultimately removed
to the facade of St. Mark's in Venice; where, with the exception of
a Napoleonic interlude on the Arc de Triomphe, they have since
remained. The backbone of the course,[*] round which the chariots
raced, was marked with other works of art, for which Constantine
had stripped the whole world naked: poisoned bull and brazen ass;
angry elephant with trunk that moved; Hercules of Lysippus, six
feet from knee to foot; Caledonian boar; bronze eagle, through
holes in whose outstretched wings the sun shone to mark the hours
on a dial beneath; a giant woman bearing in her hand a life-size
horse and rider. It was Theodosius (375-395) who mounted the
incised obelisk of Thothmes III upon its sculptured base and four
copper cubes, which rise today from amid the insufferable harmonies
of Turkish municipal gardeners. Originally a bronze pineapple
graced the top, to look across to the Forum Tauri where the same
Emperor's silver lady turned in the wind upon a pillar plated with
pastoral reliefs. Another obelisk that once was similarly plated
still stands nearby, having been restored in that form by the
Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. And between the two,
removed by Constantine from the oracle at Delphi and ultimately to
be cleared of the accruing levels by British soldiers on their way
to the Crimea, is a triple, twisted pillar of bronze, 22 feet high,
and formerly surmounted by three spouting, long-necked heads, on
which may still be read the names of the thirty-one Greek states
responsible for the victory of Plataea over the army of Xerxes, 479
years before the birth of Christ. The two obelisks and the serpent
column are in alignment. Upon the same axis, history is completed
with the canopied fountain of a later Caesar, presented in the
opening years of the twentieth century. The donor was William II of
Germany, he who brought to ruin the Emperors Nicholas and Charles,
last inheritors of the East and West Roman thrones.</p>

<blockquote>[* The existence of an actual spina, though disputed by
the evidence of the recent excavations, is not in doubt. Robert de
Clary (1104) describes it in terms of personal observation, and
gives its height and breadth as fifteen feet and ten respectively.
It certainly bore the monuments enumerated above; but whether the
two obelisks and the serpent column, is unknown.]</blockquote>

<p>To the northeast of the Hippodrome, on the point most prominent
to sailors approaching from the south, Constantine built the church
of St. Irene, and laid the foundations of the great church of St.
Sophia, afterwards completed and consecrated by his son,
Constantius. In these two temples, erected to the glory of a
personal Absolute and dedicated to the rational abstractions of
Wisdom and Peace, the Emperor gave symbolic expression to the
alliance of Greek and Semite in pursuit of a common goal which he
had brought about, and which was to render Christianity both
intelligible and acceptable to the most divergent temperaments. He
further built for himself a smaller church, that of the Holy
Apostles, which, though reconstructed by Justinian, long survived
the destruction of the other two and, till its pillage by the
crusaders, served as the royal mausoleum. Also he set up a column,
eight drums of porphyry, bound in metal and rising from a white
marble plinth. On top of this, a bronze Apollo from ancient Greece,
newly furnished with the Emperor's head encircled with the rays of
the sun, proclaimed the earthly majesty of Caesar and the city's
founder. Within the plinth, as though to justify the prostrations
of passersby, were sealed the twelve baskets that once held the
crumbs of the five thousand; the alabaster box of ointment of
spikenard; the adze with which Noah fashioned the ark; the
Palladium of old Rome; and the crosses of the two thieves, lately
retrieved from Jerusalem by the octogenarian St. Helena of York,
the Emperor's mother. "O CHRIST, RULER AND MASTER OF THE WORLD, TO
THEE HAVE I NOW CONSECRATED THIS OBEDIENT CITY...AND THE POWER OF
ROME." Thus ran the inscription. Today, as the trams rattle past,
pious souls may study the announcements of important football
matches on the plinth instead. The statue fell in 1106. But the
relics themselves await the spade. Meanwhile, Constantine, while
prone to deliver tedious sermons on monotheism to the court,
retained the title of Pontifex Maximus, minted the Sol Invictus,
his family deity, on his coins, and permitted the erection of pagan
temples within the city. He was baptized only on his deathbed at
Nicomedia in 337.</p>

<p>Constantine was the first grand tolerant. If, with the majority
of his subjects still pagans, his attitude was born of expediency,
it was not of opportunism. He condemned paganism only for the
debauches which its rites sometimes occasioned. But he saw that for
a world in search of a God, Christianity offered the best, and one,
moreover, that he was not ashamed to represent on earth. His
achievement in history was the discernment and utilization of the
vital elements in a world of extreme physical and mental chaos. In
Constantinople he coalesced, with conscious purpose, the political
machinery of Rome and the spiritual galvanism of the East, with the
great cohesive substructure of Hellenic culture.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b></p>

<p>Byzantine civilization was inaugurated. Roman in title, as it
always remained, its custodians in fact were Greek. In the still
visible list of those who contributed to the expenses of the great
cistern which Philoxenus built for Constantine, there is no Italian
name. Even the churches were dedicated in Greek. But the Byzantines
were descendants of more than Hellas. The triple fusion of the
stable, the transcendental and the cultural, was one of character
as well. To the classical humanism, the scientific reason, and the
tolerance and understanding of human nature that were essentially
Greek, there was added the practical broad vision of the Roman,
able always to see the wood for the trees; and the mystical
distrust of the material world as the instrument of present or
ultimate happiness, that is common to all Asiatic peoples.
"Byzantine," whether applied to man, spirit, institution or work of
art, denotes nor East nor West. It is an adjective apart, exclusive
yet cosmopolitan, austere yet delectable. But in its whole
composite significance, two elements predominate: the Christian and
the Greek. Without this alliance, the universal civilization of the
West could never have evolved. And it is this alliance whose
personality, tested to the depths of human suffering, has survived
in the twentieth century.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-5"></a>Chapter 5. The Imperial Chronology</h3>

<p>From Eusebius, contemporary of the first Emperor of
Constantinople, to Phrantzes, friend and chronicler of the last,
the long sequence of Greek historians, the torch of Thucydides, has
not failed. For 1123 years the Empire in the East is portrayed
unchanging, as a national and political organism. Its 88 effective
rulers, who, with the exception of the four following the Latin
Conquest, were resident in Constantinople, succeeded one another
without intermission: 39 dynamically; 20 by the regular process of
delegation; 7 by civil or military election; and 22 by usurpation.
Of the latter a few were justified by success; while the remainder
ousted one another in spasmodic groups. Thus, from the foundation
of the city to its first capture by the crusaders nearly 900 years
later, those periods of disturbed succession which are popularly
supposed to have rendered Byzantine government no more than a
farce, numbered exactly five, lasting respectively 8, 22, 23, 10,
and 19 years (CE 602-610, 695-717, 797-820, 1071-1081,
1185-1204).[*] Isolated revolts were more frequent; but successful
or not, with the exception of the Nika they exercised little effect
on the administrative machinery of the Empire, disturbing still
less the avocations of the ordinary citizen.</p>

<blockquote>[* It is frequently asserted that "of 107 Byzantine
Emperors, 65 abdicated or met with violent deaths." This
calculation conveys a false impression, the phrase "Byzantine
Emperors" being stretched to include the latter rulers of
Trebizond, Epirus and Cyprus, besides numerous young
Porphyrogeniti, who though crowned as their fathers' successors,
never took actual part in government.]</blockquote>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The first of the eight periods into which the life of the Empire
is usually divided, lasted from 330 to 518, from the foundation of
the city by Constantine the Great to the death of the Emperor
Anastasius. The new city, the imperial whim, was proved. Sheltered
by the Black Sea, as though beneath an umbrella, from the full
torrent of the Asiatic migrations to the southwest, she escaped the
disasters that overtook the West, as the great leaders, Alaric,
Attila and Theodoric allowed themselves to be diverted by the
seductions of Italy and Spain. One complete rout the Goths imposed
on the armies of the Eastern Empire, at Adrianople in 378; and the
danger that threatened was not finally eliminated till a decade
later than the fall of Rome in 476. Nevertheless, a single century
had seen the population of Constantinople overflow the boundary of
her founder by a mile. In 439, Cyrus, prefect of Theodosius II, had
constructed the gigantic triple line of walls, which still survive,
across the five-mile base of the elsewhere seagirt promontory, in
order to defend the new suburbs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the nature of Christ was reflecting the political
vicissitudes of the nation most determined on its final definition.
Against the ghostly preferences of the East, and the Greek
concentration upon God as a celestial focus for philosophic values,
the West was resolved to maintain the co-preponderance of Christ's
entry into Mary's womb. The situation was complicated by the
identification of spiritual with national aspirations. At the
Council of Ephesus in 431, the condemnation of Nestorius's
matter-of-fact analysis of Christ's elements, at the instance of
the Alexandrine mystics, produced the separate Nestorian church and
a distinctive Syrian nationality. And twenty years later, the
condemnation at Chalcedon, in their turn, of the Alexandrine
mystics, produced the separate Monophysite churches, Coptic and
Abyssinian, and the final stultification of the African
patriarchate's temporal ambitions. The Church of Constantinople,
thanks to the assistance of Rome, was now supreme in the East.
Nonetheless, from 482 to 518, relations with Rome, where Leo the
Great had already inaugurated papal pretension to universal
dominion, were suspended, owing to Constantinople's acceptance of
Christ's preponderating divinity to the discount of his humanity.
The strength of the Empire lay in the Levant; and the interests of
the state demanded this recognition for the conciliation of its
fanatic populations.</p>

<p>Thus amid convulsions, abstract and material, the Byzantine
Empire was formed and tempered. From the barbarian migrations it
emerged intact when Europe lay inundated. Under its auspices the
kernel of Christian orthodoxy was promulgated, a permanent monument
to the sincerity of Greek thinking.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>During the second period, from 518 to 610, Justin I to Phocas,
the phase of premature expansion instituted by Justinian was not
maintained. The latter Emperor was imbued with a practical and
ambitious conception of imperial government which linked his
sympathies with the West and with all of the past that Rome still
represented. The religious policy was reversed; the papacy was
reconciled; and a persecution brought to bear on the Monophysites
of Africa and Asia. The championship of Orthodox dogma was assumed,
and engrained henceforth for thirteen centuries, as the foundation
of Greek national consciousness. But Justinian, thus in harmony
with the West, betrayed the resources and position of his capital
in a grand attempt to recapture the dominion of the whole
Mediterranean. During twenty years (533-554), northern Africa,
Italy, Southern Spain, and the islands of Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia
and the Balearics, fell successively to the Byzantine rule.
Theodora, the Cypriot Empress, would have retained, in preference,
the support of Syria and Egypt by religious tolerance. With the
incessant Persian invasions of Asia Minor, the Slays and Huns
penetrating even the Morea, and the Italian Lombards still
unsubdued, the Empire, impoverished by excessive enterprise, was
temporarily crippled at Justinian's death in 565. Leaving the
outlying Exarchates of Africa (including Spain) and Ravenna, in the
form of armed dependencies, to shift for themselves, his successors
applied themselves to the deliverance of the Balkan and Armenian
borders from the respective incursions of savage hordes and Persian
armies. This work was interrupted by a palace revolution in 602;
and the Empire was only preserved from total anarchy by the advent
of Heraclius three years later.</p>

<p>Ephemeral, however, as was Justinian's attempt to reconstitute
the Roman Empire, the importance of his reign in the evolution of
Byzantine and European civilization is not to be exaggerated.
Despite the wealth that poured by land and sea into Constantinople,
it was plain to the Emperor that every branch of the administration
was in need of reform. The general discontent against a corrupt and
exacting officialdom came to a head in the riot of the circus
factions in 532, which was only suppressed after half the original
city of Constantine had been burnt to the ground, and 40,000 of the
insurgents were lying dead among the seats of the Hippodrome.
Justinian, whom only the courage of Theodora had prevented from
flight, set himself forthwith to the centralization of the
bureaucracy, the abolition of the sale of offices, and the union of
the civil and military authority in each province. But his greatest
work, already begun in the earliest year of his reign, was the
recodification of Roman law and the summarization, in accessible
form, of Roman legal precedent. In the volumes that he planned and
caused to be compiled, the primary rules of social existence,
redistributed in accordance with the Christian ethic, were
registered in perpetuity for the benefit of a Byzantine, a European
and a worldwide posterity. For the moment, abridged editions
diffused from Beirut to Rome, opened the knowledge of justice to
all the officials and subjects of the Empire.</p>

<p>There remained, after the Nika riot, to rebuild the main
quarters of the city. And in Justinian's ultimate version of the
church of St. Sophia together with all the contemporary churches
and mosaics at Rome, Salonica and Ravenna; in these, more plainly
than any document can show, is visible the first flowering of the
Byzantine genius. The grammatical elements of art, symmetry,
technique and racial consciousness, are absorbed, if not yet
wholly, in an expression of cosmopolitan, mystical emotion so
overwhelmingly coherent as to stir almost to the surface the tears
of the beholder.</p>

<p>Such were the first products of the fused civilization.
Culturally and socially the achievement was permanent. But the
imagination of Justinian proved politically too great a burden. His
life had been devoted to a castle in the West. And the East was
awaiting revenge.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The third period begins with the reign of Heraclius in 610 and
ends with that of Theodosius III in 717. From 602, following the
usurpation of Phocas, confusion had surrounded the Byzantine
throne. The assassination of Maurice, his predecessor, who had
formerly aided the Persian king, Chosro&euml;s II, to regain his
own throne, was made the excuse for a Persian onslaught of such
magnitude that the existence of the whole Empire was imperiled. As
Antioch, Damascus, Jerusalem, Chalcedon, and even Egypt succumbed,
Heraclius, who had sailed from his father's Exarchate of Carthage
to assume the leadership of the Empire, despaired even of
preserving the capital. Despite the attacks of the Avars on the
west, the incursions of the Lombards into Italy, and the final loss
of Spain, the Emperor concentrated on the repulse of the Persians.
In 628 he entered Ctesiphon in triumph, retrieving thence the Holy
Cross which had been carried off from Jerusalem thirteen years
before. But this very success raised two dangerous issues. The cost
of the war, to which even the church had contributed, could only be
defrayed by taxation so heavy as to render Byzantine government
odious to its non-Greek subjects. And it was essential that Egypt
and Syria, alienated by the Monophysite persecutions, should be
consolidated. Political consolidation implied, as in the England of
Elizabeth, religious uniformity. Orthodoxy was firmly established
at Constantinople; but a compromise with the adherence to Christ's
unadulterated divinity, prevalent in Egypt and Syria, was sought by
the population of a single, and that divine, will, at work within
the conventional dual nature, carnate and incarnate. Monotheletism,
as this gallant expedient was termed, found favor with neither of
the two parties whom it was designed to unite in a common political
framework. In the West, it resulted, eight years after Heraclius's
death, in the kidnapping of a pope. And in Egypt, it was enforced
only at the point of a patriarchal sword. Meanwhile, as the
Emperor, overcome by the theological and financial complications of
his situation, only deepened the discussions which he sought to
heal, a new race had achieved national consciousness by means of a
religion which demanded no such acute refinements in its definition
of the Almighty. In 634, within three years of Mohammed's death,
the Arab Moslems of Medina won their first skirmish against the
Byzantine garrisons of Palestine.</p>

<p>To the Semite, the Syrian, and the Egyptian, the early hosts of
Islam, tolerant in religion, and rendered odious by no greedy
bureaucracy, appeared in the light of deliverers from the material
and spiritual oppression of the Byzantines. Unsupported by the
native populations, the Greek forces were forced into retreat. By
640 Palestine was lost and Egypt invaded. The death of Heraclius in
the following year resulted in the evacuation of Alexandria. Persia
and Armenia were overrun. Eventually the struggle shifted to the
sea. Cyprus fell; and in 655 the Greek fleet, under the Emperor
Constans II, was defeated off the coast of Lycia. But with the
accession of Constantine IV and the discovery of Greek fire, the
situation changed. For five years in succession the recurring naval
assaults on Constantinople were repulsed; and in 678 the Arabs,
brought to their first standstill on land and sea alike, were glad
to conclude a peace. Three years later, the Monothelite doctrine,
having now, with the rape of Egypt and Syria, lost its <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i>, was formally condemned at the sixth Ecumenical
Council, held at Constantinople in 681.</p>

<p>Thus there was peace; and the Empire received a breathing space
before being called upon to repulse the last and greatest of the
Saracen attempts to burst the confines of Asia at the Hellespont.
Unfortunately, from 695 to 717, a period of internal anarchy
lessened the advantage gained and hastened the inevitable loss of
North Africa. Simultaneously, on the northwest frontier, the
encroachments of the newly formed state of the Bulgars gave cause
for alarm.</p>

<p>From the seventh century forward, the main currents of Byzantine
history may be traced. The Balkan and Mohammedan questions were now
incarnate in the Bulgars and Arabs. Administratively, the
exigencies of the period had crystallized the civil and military
organization of the provinces into the system of themes and
marches. In religion, the territorial conquest by the Moslems of
the patriarchates of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, had
enhanced proportionately the prestige of Constantinople as a
central authority. The Empire was now centered more wholly on the
Greek seaboard. And the last vestiges of Latin, even as an
antiquarian adjunct of court ritual, lapsed from use.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The fourth period, from 717 to 867, opens in the former year
with the march on the capital, and acclamation by Patriarch and
people, of Leo the Isaurian, governor of the Anatolic theme. Within
a few months of his assumption of imperial dignity, the tide of
Arab expansion reached its high-water mark; and for a whole year
the Mohammedan fleet and army invested the capital. But while the
Greeks were living in comparative comfort behind their walls, the
besiegers were reduced by famine and frost to a condition which
resulted, even at their own computation, in the loss of 150,000
men. This defeat marked a decisive check to the blast of Islam,
compared to which the marauding expedition that won Charles Martel
immortality fifteen years later was but the fortuitous puff of a
movement already spent. The prestige of Byzantine arms was carried
by Leo's son, Constantine V Copronymus, to Armenia and the
Euphrates. With the capital of the Abbassid Caliphs transferred to
the distant city of Baghdad, and the Bulgars on the West reduced by
a series of campaigns between the years 755 and 780, the Isaurian
Emperors inaugurated a new era of security which not even the
extinction of their line by an unnatural mother or the devotion of
Michael III the Drunkard to horses could disturb. Internally, they
displayed perception of essentials and directness of action. The
administration of the themes was systematized, and the army
redisciplined. A series of enactments sought to check the unceasing
absorption of agricultural freeholders, the yeoman defenders of
Eastern Christendom, by the increasingly independent landed
aristocracy. And in a simplification of Justinian's code, known as
the <i>Ecloga</i>, a more definitely Christian conception of family
life was introduced; the death penalty was largely replaced by
mutilation; and class distinctions in sight of the law were
abolished. It is, however, in the emergence of what has since
become known as Protestantism, in the first great attempt to defend
the new appreciation of transcendental values, that had come from
the East, against the golden calves of the South, that the true
importance of the period lies. Accompanying the new dynasty from
the hinterland of Asia Minor, where precisely the same battle was
being fought among the followers of the Prophet, the iconoclast
aversion to sacred representational art was launched on the Empire
in 726 by Leo's edict against ecclesiastical pictures.
Extraordinary repercussions ensued: riots in the capital were
echoed by a rebellion in the Peloponnese; while in Italy Byzantine
authority was so weakened that, within thirty years, the Exarchate
of Ravenna was under the control of the Lombards, and the Pope,
detaching himself from the Empire, had sought the patronage of
Pepin, king of the Franks. Such provinces as remained to the Greeks
in the south were placed, in retaliation, under the spiritual
jurisdiction of the Patriarch. Meanwhile, upon the succession of
Constantine y, the whole fabric of popular religion was threatened
by a legislative attack on relics, the cult of the Virgin, and the
intercession of the saints. The depth of the Emperor's convictions
produced a series of persecutions which were chiefly directed
against the icon-loving monks. But in 787, the Empress Irene, in
order to bolster her venture on the throne, restored the
pictures.</p>

<p>The defeat, however, of the Eastern zealots was only temporary.
In 815, on the advent of a new Armenian Emperor, the pictures were
again proscribed, and the intransigence of the monks, combined with
their continued absorption of national wealth and energy, led once
more to their persecution and dispersal. But a transformation was
being wrought in the religious life of the Empire: the monastic
reforms of Theodore of Studium, which, as foreshadowing those of
Cluny, were destined to exercise a profound effect on the whole of
Europe, had produced not only a more ordered and active asceticism
than formerly, but had infused the church with the ideal of
complete emancipation from the authority of the state. Thus
inspired, the monastic party sought aid from Rome, whose
theoretical primacy in matters spiritual had not yet been disputed.
As a result, the violence of the iconoclast reaction against them
was only enhanced. At length, however, in 843, "veneration" of the
icons was permitted. Finally, the breach with Rome which the
controversy had provoked, and which had been accentuated in 800 by
the Pope's coronation of Charlemagne as rival Emperor of the West,
was consummated in 867 by a formal though temporary schism.</p>

<p>Thus, in letter, the first of the struggles to defend the
spiritual inheritance of Christianity from the insidious
materialism of the Mediterranean failed. But in compensation,
Byzantine art and the germ of European painting were saved.
Furthermore, the iconoclast movement had purged and reawakened the
Greek intelligence. Without it the world might never have witnessed
the supreme junction of pictorial representation with emotional
formalism that Byzantine art achieved. Contemporarily, the
conversion and cultural habilitation of the Slays by Salonican
missionaries, and the refoundation of the university of
Constantinople by the Caesar Bardas, already foreshadowed that
Renaissance of taste and learning which was to illumine the
crowning centuries of the Empire's good fortune.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The fifth period, from 867 to 1057, is marked by the limits of a
single dynasty, that founded by Basil I the Macedonian, favorite of
Michael III the Drunkard, and his murderer. European history, save
perhaps in the house of Vasa, offers no parallel to the uniform
success with which this line of hereditary rulers and their
military coadjutors pursued the welfare of a single dominion over
so long a course of time as two centuries. Territorially the Empire
was expanded to its fullest extent; and for more than a hundred
years the invincible armies of Constantinople, consciously inspired
champions of Christianity and civilization, thrust the forces of
Islam back into the deserts of Arabia and the fastnesses of
Kurdistan. Four new Asiatic themes were reclaimed; and, to the
north, Armenia and Georgia were forced to exchange Moslem for
Byzantine suzerainty, the former state eventually submitting to
complete annexation at the beginning of the eleventh
century&mdash;though the unwisdom of thus robbing the frontier of
its buffers was immediately to be proved. In the seventies of the
ninth century, Silicia and Cappadocia were regained by Basil I. As
the tenth progressed, the frontier was advanced to the Tigris in
the north and the Euphrates in the south. Thenceforth, the fighting
centered for the most part round the right angle in the coast above
Cyprus. Under the generalship of Nicephorus II Phocas, and John I
Tzimisces, Aleppo, Antioch, Edessa, Damascus, and Beirut were
taken. In 961 the capture of Crete had restored to the Greeks the
control of the Aegean. Byzantine arms seemed destined almost to the
deliverance of Jerusalem. In the west the successes were the same.
From 889 to 924, the Tsar Symeon of the Bulgars had carried war to
the very walls of Constantinople in his attempt to assert a
supremacy of the Balkans. After his death in 927, Slav ambition
remained passive until aroused by Svatioslav, an emigrant Prince of
Kiev. This new combination was defeated in 970 by the Emperor John
I Tzimisces, and the whole country annexed up to the Danube; only,
however, to be reconquered in the next decade by the Tsar Samuel.
In 986, therefore, the Emperor Basil II Bulgaroctonos embarked on
the first of those famous campaigns which closed with the defeat
and practical annihilation of the entire Bulgarian male population
in 1014. The whole Balkan peninsular now admitted the imperial
rule; and the Emperor proceeded on a tour of inspection which
ultimately led him, admiring, to the great golden-pillared church
of Athens, the Christianized, though yet unmutilated, Parthenon. In
Italy, also, the incursions of the Arabs furnished excuse for
Byzantine intervention; and from 915 to 1o25, the south of the
peninsula, up to the borders of the Papal States, acknowledged the
imperial sovereignty.</p>

<p>Relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches were at
first disturbed. The frailties of the Caesar Bardas, regent of
Michael III, having drawn upon him the reproaches of the Patriarch
Hgnatius, the latter was deposed, and Photius, a savant, whose
profound knowledge of classical philosophy and the existing
literature on all subjects from medicine to agriculture,[*] ensured
his influence with the upper classes of the capital, and seemed to
excuse his hurried investiture with the orders of priesthood, was
elevated in his stead. The Pope's refusal to recognize him,
combined with a series of subterranean intrigues on the part of
Rome with the object of winning the Bulgars from allegiance to the
Church which had converted them, resulted in a schism. The
theological basis of the quarrel, which was formulated by Photius,
denounced the Roman insertion of the <i>Filioque</i> in the creed
as heretical, since it implied the emanation of the Holy Spirit not
only from God but from his human son and thereby offended Greek
susceptibilities concerning the purity of the individual's abstract
communing. On the accession of Basil I, Photius was deposed, but
recalled five years later. Not until 898 was peace restored, which
was ratified in Sao and maintained until the last years of the
dynasty.</p>

<p>At home, in the vast embattled medley of shops, slums, baths,
palaces, gardens, churches, and monasteries that comprised the
[<i>Greek characters</i>], city of Constantine, guarded of God,
days of extraordinary prosperity were coinciding with the military
glory won by the soldier-emperors abroad. All the wealth of three
continents seemed to pour down the trade routes of the Levant and
the Black Sea, down the great Russian rivers, overland from India
and Cathay by Trebizond, to that which was in truth the safest spot
on earth; and from the riches of the city materialized an
architectural and artistic splendor which was rendered doubly
magnificent by the mystical disquiet, the celestial fixation, of
the Byzantine temperament. Without, the Russians were converted to
Christianity; and at Kiev, on the commercial highway of the
Dnieper, the deliberate adoption of Byzantine civilization brought
a new nation into existence and a new genius to its own
awakening.</p>

<p>But while the radiance of the queen of cities was born in
traveler's tale, and refracted in legend, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, contact with the immediate and barbarous West had been
almost wholly ruptured by the difficulty of language and the
increasing divergence of sympathies. Within the Empire, moreover,
new forces were afoot, the independence of patriarchs and
feudatories already an embarrassment. Without, the Seljuk Turks
were converging from the northeast. And in central Italy, the
Normans, shadow of insatiable rapacity, were about to emulate the
success of their cousins at Hastings.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>With the death, in 1053, of the Empress Theodora, sole remaining
descendant of Basil I, there opens the sixth and most complex
period in the imperial history, which culminates in the capture of
Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204, and the removal of the
Greek monarchy to Nicaea. Already the essential strength of the
Byzantine state had been shaken. The attempts of the Macedonian
emperors to continue the work of the Isaurian in limiting the power
of the Asiatic magnates had produced insurrections on a vast scale,
which had only been finally suppressed by Basil II Bulgaroctonos.
Upon the extinction of the Macedonian house, a struggle for the
throne ensued among the great feudal families. It was not until
thirty years later that the accession of Alexius I Comnenus, in
1081, and after him, of his son and grandson, brought new strength
to a state still the strongest in Europe and possessing almost a
monopoly of civilized life, but nevertheless on the ebb of its
glory. Meanwhile, the bureaucracy was faltering between the devil
of feudal civil war and the deep, though seemingly more distant,
sea of external invasion. A revival in classical culture was
reflected in an unpractical trend of politics. An anti-militarist
movement, directed against the semi-independent leaders of the
Asiatic regiments, resulted in the neglect of the border fortresses
and the reduction of native troops in favor of mercenaries, who
themselves revolted. On the sea, the disastrous policy of
purchasing defense was to bring ruin to the Empire's trade and the
transport against it of the crusaders in those very ships from
which the Byzantines were wont to draw their navy. Already, at the
beginning of the period, feudal dissensions, combined with the
maladministration of an intellectual clique headed by Psellos the
Platonist, were the cause of the disaster of Manzikert in 1071, the
loss of almost all Asia Minor, and the advent on the Aegean coasts
of the first Turk.</p>

<p>It had seemed, as the eleventh century progressed, that the
corporate force of Islam, sapped by the Shi'ite heresy and the
ineffectuality of the Caliphs of Baghdad, was on the point of
dissolution. But the last heirs of the Prophet were yet to come. In
1055, Toghril Beg, leader of a new race from the lands beyond the
Oxus, was proclaimed Sultan by the Caliph. From 1063 to 1091, the
Seljuk Turks continued to expand. Ani, the capital of Armenia, fell
to them, together with Konia in the south. The Byzantine armies,
marching to oppose them, were utterly routed at Manzikert between
Erzerum and Lake Van, and the Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes made
prisoner. Ten years later, Greek possessions in Asia Minor were
temporarily confined to thin littorals on the Black Sea and the
Aegean. The wealthiest provinces of the Empire were desolate, towns
ruined, fields forsaken. Worst of all, the chief recruiting grounds
of the army were lost forever.</p>

<p>In the same year as Manzikert, the Turks had occupied Jerusalem,
and Christian pilgrims, hitherto peaceably received by the Arabs,
were now molested. The mystic chivalry and urgent land hunger of
the West were thus beckoned to a new outlet. And the Emperor
Alexius I Comnenus was able, with the help of the crusaders, to
regain possession of Nicaea, Smyrna, and all the west and south
coast of Anatolia as far as Antioch. Against the Seljuk Empire, now
divided by internal factions, John II Comnenus, Alexius's son,
continued the reorientation of the Byzantine frontiers. But Manuel
I, his successor, despite the earlier victories of his reign, was
decisively beaten at Myriocephalon in 1176. With the establishment
of Saladin in Syria and the fall of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem
eleven years later, the momentary ebb in the Moslem tide was
turned.</p>

<p>Such was the initial advance of a force destined to extinguish
the half of European civilization and to reach its limit only
before the walls of Vienna. Simultaneously, a more immediate fate
was moving on Constantinople from the West.</p>

<p>Throughout the Macedonian era, the arrogant success of Byzantine
material enterprise had been reflected in the ghostly province of
the Church. Proportionately as the Patriarch's power increased,
that of the Pope diminished; till, but for the resurrection,
through the reforms of Cluny, of Papal self-assertiveness, the
autocephaly of the Orthodox Church, in fact a reality, might have
been granted in theory as well, for the mere asking. But in 1049,
the election of the reformer Leo IX to the Holy See having
coincided with the Patriarchate of Michael Cerularius, there
resulted a dispute over the south Italian bishoprics, which was
deliberately provoked by the latter in contradiction to the wishes
of the Emperor Constantine IX Monomach. Legates were dispatched to
the Eastern capital. The manuscript of a profound curse was laid on
the altar of St. Sophia. And the Patriarch, inspired by a frenzy of
popular acclamation, ratified the breach that he had engineered, in
full council&mdash;and, as it proved, in perpetuity. The moment was
one of incalculable significance. Henceforth, in the teaching of
popular Catholicism, the Greek was neither Christian nor brother.
And in that age, popular Catholicism and the eastward expansion of
feudalism were on the point of identification.</p>

<p>The Council of Clermont launched the first crusade in 1095; and
in the summer of the following year Peter the Hermit arrived in
Constantinople. Already, in the middle of the century, the
Byzantines had come in contact with the Normans in south Italy,
whence the latter had finally ousted them by the taking of Bari in
1071. A decade later Robert Guiscard had crossed the Adriatic to
Epirus, and penetrated inland as far as Macedonia and Thessaly.
Thus it was not unnatural that, in the eyes of Alexius I Comnenus
and his subjects, the religious and mystical ideals of a host
composed of those same Normans, ill-mannered, illiterate, and
boasting of upstart pedigrees; and of a rank and file whose
devotion to the sepulcher could scarcely compensate the pillaged
householders on whom, as they marched, they lived; the ideals of
the first and subsequent crusades should have been obscured beneath
the political import of a movement which threatened to, and
ultimately did, implant an alien feudalism in the Aegean lands. The
forces of the Empire were diverted from the East where its strength
might still have lain. And with this first attracting of the West,
this first protruding of those million tentacles with which the
other half of Europe was destined to envelop the globe, the
"Eastern Question" was begun.</p>

<p>Unable to avert the invaders, the Emperor Alexius I decided to
use them. In return for money and provisions, the leaders of the
host agreed that any towns formerly contained in the Empire and
captured from the Moslems, should be returned to it. But the
surrender of Nicaea to the Greeks was followed by the retention of
Antioch, Jerusalem and many lesser towns in the hands of the Norman
princes. In retaliation for the Emperor's opposition to this
violation of agreement, Bohemond of Antioch organized a "crusade"
against the Greek capital itself. He was outwitted by Alexius and
retired to Italy, humiliated.</p>

<p>The second crusade, of 1147, was fed by the Emperor Conrad III
Hohenstaufen and King Louis VII of France. Their respective
followings raped and plundered their passage through the Greek
dominions, to be ultimately defeated by the Turks and left to
perish by their leaders on the south coast of Asia Minor. In both
camps an attack on Constantinople had been mooted during the
transit, but abandoned.</p>

<p>Some years later, the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, encouraged by a
temporary reclamation of part of southern Italy, planned, as he
thought, to restore the Empire of Justinian. The Latin
principalities of the East were forced to acknowledge his
suzerainty. And the diplomatic bribes, which he alone was rich
enough to dispense, focused in Constantinople the wires of half the
states of Europe. Though it may have seemed, during this analysis
of the long-gathering cyclone of adversity that was to burst on the
capital in 1204, that the twelfth century was for the Greeks one of
depression; in fact never was life in Constantinople more radiant,
never the amenities of existence more luxuriant. In art,
architecture and even in literature, in the multitude of charitable
foundations, in the vast wealth, and in the new ideas generated by
revived contact with the West, the vitality of the medieval Greek
Empire was still undisputed. It was the death of Manuel I, in 1180,
and the turmoil which followed the overthrow of the Comnenus
dynasty, that eventually set in motion the last diabolic machinery
of events.</p>

<p>Throughout the century, the hatred of Greek for Latin had
accumulated. In 1182, the unpopularity of the Norman
Empress-Regent, Mary of Antioch, led to a massacre of the foreign
residents in Constantinople. And seven years later, the third
crusading army, under the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, was openly
attacked by Byzantine troops. Meanwhile a Norman-Sicilian fleet had
sacked Salonica with extreme brutality. And, in 1198, the Emperor
Henry VI was on the point of starting in person against the capital
itself, when he died. The whole might of the West was inflamed
against the people who resisted its encroachment and denied its
Pope. And the advent of a fugitive pretender from Constantinople,
begging help for a dethroned and imprisoned father, was sufficient
to divert the now preparing fourth crusade from Egypt, whither it
was destined, to Constantinople.</p>

<p>The movers of this orientation, neither of whom returned from it
alive, were Boniface of Montferrat and Henry Dandolo, the blind
Doge of Venice. Transport was supplied by the latter town. In July
1203, the expedition was peaceably received in the Greek capital,
though the previous restoration of the monarch whom it had come to
succor, robbed its presence of the last vestiges of plausibility.
But the champions of the Cross, once arrived, remained, demanding
payment for services never rendered. In 1204, the people of the
city, exasperated by the subservience of the reigning dynasty to
the Latins, overthrew them and raised Alexius v Mourtzouphlos in
their stead. The Latins determined on a second assault. On April
9th the virgin city fell; and the treasures of nearly nine
centuries, together with the works of art collected by Constantine
the Great from every quarter of the classical world, were delivered
to destruction. Of this disaster, the Turkish capture in 1453 was
but a corollary. For humanity in general, history reveals no
greater misfortune. A European civilization was to all intents and
purposes extinguished. Its successor of the twentieth century was
left to emerge stifled by aristocratic, national, and
pseudo-classical prejudices. And the races and lands within its
care entered now upon seven centuries of poverty, illiteracy, and
slavery.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The seventh period of Byzantine history, marked by the
transference of the capital to Nicaea while the Latin Emperors
ruled within the walls of Constantinople, lasted from 12.04 to
12.61. In the first confusion, feudalism, commercialism, and
Hellenism vied with each other in the process of disruption. In
vassalage to Baldwin of Flanders, Emperor-elect of the barons, a
multitude of dependencies arose, of which the most important were
the kingdom of Salonica under Boniface of Montferrat, the barony of
Athens, not for six centuries to return to Greek rule, and the
principality of Achaia. The acquisitions of Venice were intended to
consolidate her trade. As long ago as the reign of the Emperor
Alexius I Comnenus (1081-1118) she had maneuvered, in return for
naval assistance and political services in Italy, a grant of
immunity from the heavy duties imposed on all the merchandise of
the Empire; a privilege which had seriously hampered the native
Greek merchants, not themselves exempt, and had seriously
diminished the imperial revenues. Her rule was now installed at
Durazzo on the Dalmatian coast; at Modon and Coron in the
Peloponnese; in Crete, Euboea, and Gallipoli; at Heraclea on the
Black Sea; throughout most of the Aegean Archipelago; and in a
large quarter of Constantinople herself. The rallying points of
Greek independence were three: at Nicaea, where Theodore I
Lascaris, son-in-law of Alexius III Angelus, had gathered round him
the remnant of the Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy and
established the Patriarchate; at Trebizond, also now an Empire,
supporting the rule of a grandson of Andronicus I Comnenus, from
Heraclea to the Caucasus; and finally in Epirus, a Despotat
governed by an illegitimate Angelus, stretching from Lepanto on the
Gulf of Corinth to Durazzo.</p>

<p>The attempt of Western chivalry to evolve a working political
organism from the ashes of its conquest, that "miracle wrought by
God" as Pope Innocent III termed it, was not successful. The new
feudatories were insubordinate; the Venetians and their monopoly of
trade absorbed the revenues; the latent nationalism of the Balkan
Slays, varying, as always, inversely with the power of
Constantinople, was reawakened; and the Greeks, despite efforts
made to win their friendship, remained implacable in their enmity.
Before 1204 was out, Boniface and Baldwin were already at war with
one another; and within three years both had perished fighting the
Bulgars. Henry of Flanders, Baldwin's brother, was an able ruler,
but survived him only till 1216. He was followed by the children of
his sister, Yolande, the younger of whom, Baldwin II, was crowned
in 1228 at the age of eleven, and reigned as long as the city
remained in Latin hands. Meanwhile the Despots of Epirus had
retaken Durazzo, Corfu, and even, in 1222, Salonica. Gradually all
hold on Asia was also lost. And the Emperor Baldwin, having pawned
the Crown of Thorns to a merchant of Venice, and delivered the lead
off his own roof to the mint, departed, on a circular tour of the
courts of Europe to beg assistance.</p>

<p>At Nicaea, Theodore I Lascaris had been succeeded in 1222 by his
son-in-law, John III Vatatzes. During the latter's reign of
thirty-two years, all Asia Minor in possession of the Greeks
immediately before the conquest was recovered; the eastern frontier
successfully maintained against Turks and Mongols; and Salonica
recovered from the Despot of Epirus. In the delectable shady city
on the shores of the Lake of Askania, Byzantine life flourished
still: schools and hospitals were built; histories written; the
bureaucracy, unbroken heritage of Rome, restored. Finally, the
Emperor, united with his Holy Roman counterpart in a common
loathing of the Papacy, set the seal to his prestige by his
marriage with the latter's daughter, Constance of Hohenstaufen. He
was succeeded in 1254 by his son, Theodore II Lascaris, who died
four years later, leaving a son of eight years old, John IV. The
power thus rendered vacant by a minority was assumed by Michael
VIII Palaelogus, an able man of noted family and imperial descent.
Crossing to Europe, he annexed the greater part of the Despotat of
Epirus; in 1261 he concluded a treaty with the Genoese, granting
them, in return for naval reinforcements, the former privileges of
the Venetians; and on July 25th of the same year, Constantinople
was recaptured by a Greek reconnoitering expedition which found
entrance through a disused aqueduct. Baldwin II, the Latin
Patriarch, and the Venetian colonists fled. And the Byzantine
Empire, diminished, but fortified with a new patriotism, entered on
its last fight with adversity under the leadership of the founder
of its last dynasty.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>It is customary to regard this eighth and final period of
Byzantine history as a kind of irrelevant epilogue, attached only
by the courtesy of the historian to the company of its resplendent
predecessors. Let it, however, be remembered that for half a
century yet the Ottoman Turks, who, four hundred years later, were
still on their way to Vienna, were debarred from Europe; and that
for another century and a half after that, the impregnable walls in
their rear delayed their movements and wasted their strength; that
it was not until the fourteenth century that the Balkan races, on
the eve of submersion, had fully assimilated those elements of
Byzantine civilization which were to stand them instead of
nationality until the day of the crescent was over; that it was
only now that the seed of painting sown by the Greeks in Italy gave
forth its inaugural bud in Giotto; that the parallel Renaissance of
Byzantine painting was yet to come; that the whole body of Hellenic
culture, the secret of that attitude which the world has since
called humanism, was still sealed in Constantinople; and finally
that the Greek faith in the Greek destiny had still to be tempered
in the last misfortunes of the Empire against the greater
misfortunes of the future. Let these facts be remembered, and it is
plain that Byzantine civilization died, not at the fourth crusade,
but with the city that gave it birth.</p>

<p>The dominions of Michael VIII Palaeologus consisted of Nicaea
and the northwest corner of Asia Minor, Constantinople, and Thrace,
Salonica and part of Macedonia, together with a few islands. The
capital itself was ruined and depopulated; the administration had
lost its working traditions; trade was in the hands of the
Italians; and Bulgars, Serbs, and Turks continued to menace every
frontier. Meanwhile, Charles of Anjou, inheritor of the claims of
Baldwin II, was planning a crusade against the still heretic
Greeks, from which the support of the Papacy was averted by a
forced union of the Churches in 1274. But patriotism and
anti-Latinism in Constantinople were henceforth to be one. Neither
the nobility, the priests, nor the people would acknowledge the
Pope. In 1281, the Emperor and all the Orthodox Church were again
made excommunicate. Byzantine diplomacy resorted to its old weapon.
The dispatch of 30,000 ounces of gold to Peter of Aragon engineered
the Sicilian Vespers, in which 7,000 Normans perished. Thus the
long-threatened and now imminent scheme to support the Angevin
pretensions to the Empire was frustrated.</p>

<p>Michael VIII died in 1282. In his successors conspicuous ability
was absent. And the long civil wars in the reigns of Andronicus II
Palaeologus and John y Palaeologus, a feature hitherto almost
unknown in Byzantine history, during which each side called to its
aid the enemies of the Empire, weakened the Greeks in face of the
converging forces. In the Balkans, beside the Bulgarian state, the
Serbian kingdom of Stephen Dushan, in the middle of the fourteenth
century, stretched from the Gulf of Corinth to the Danube and from
the Adriatic to the walls of Salonica. It remained only to take the
imperial capital. Thrace was conquered. But Dushan died within
sight of the walls, and his empire dissolved after him in face of
the Turks.</p>

<p>This latter people, perpetually impelled from behind by the
Mongol migrations that had begun with Genghis Khan in 1242, lay
scattered in nomadic confusion over the length and breadth of Asia
Minor. Under the leadership of Othman, a national nucleus, later to
assume his name, was formed. During the rule of Murad, Othman's
grandson, the Turks became infected with that religious fanaticism
which was to lend the fire of more than earthly ambition to their
subsequent enterprises. In 1306, they had crossed to Europe. The
whole Balkan peninsula was gradually overrun; Sofia capitulated in
1385; and two years later the Serbs were utterly defeated at the
battle of Kossovo-Pol. The West was now alarmed. A new crusade
preached by Pope Boniface IX only resulted in the crushing of a
pan-European army at Nicopolis on the Danube in 1396. In 1399, the
Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus toured the West, even to London, in
search of reinforcements. In his absence Constantinople was
invested; and the end seemed imminent, when the sudden defeat of
the Turks by the Tartar army of Tamerlane at Angora, in 1402,
caused a diversion.</p>

<p>The respite lasted twenty years. Under Murad II the Turks
continued their advance into Bosnia, Albania, and the Peloponnese.
And in 1430, Salonica was captured. The Emperor John VIII
Palaeologus determined on one final effort to gain the sympathy of
the West. After long discussions conducted by Emperor, Pope, and
the leading theologians of the Orthodox and Latin Churches, the
union of those institutions was solemnly celebrated at Florence in
1439. The effort was of little avail; in Constantinople once again
the people refused to acquiesce; the resultant crusade came to
disaster at Varna on the Black Sea in 1444; and in 1448, another
Western army was almost annihilated at the second battle of
Kossovo-Pol. Yet still, where the might of Europe failed, the
Greeks behind their walls held out. In 1451, Mohammed II succeeded
to the leadership of the Ottoman Turks. Immediately preparations
were set on foot for a grand assault on the city that inflamed the
Sultan's dreams. Gigantic cannon were constructed. Men were
assembled from the furthest corners of the Ottoman dominions.
Within the walls, the Emperor Constantine XI Dragases could call on
only 8,000 men to defend by sea and land fourteen miles of
battlements. The siege lasted fifty-three days. Early in the
morning of April 29th, 1453, the Turks entered the city. And the
last of the East Roman Emperors died in battle for his own and his
people's good name.</p>

<p>Still, however, in the separate Empire of Trebizond on the Black
Sea and the Despotat of Mistra in the Peloponnese, Greek
independence held out. The former was reduced in 1461. In the
frescoed churches of the latter, the Renaissance of painting that
might have been, that was in fact to find its flowering in El
Greco, was already visible. But this outpost of Hellenism had
capitulated in 1460. The Middle Ages were over. And the Byzantine
era, the bridge between the modern world and antiquity, was at an
end.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-6"></a>Chapter 6. The Substance of the State</h3>

<p>The political needs of every people have certain elements in
common; and the analysis of any long-lived political organism, if
only for the rarity of such a phenomenon, must always evoke
interest in a world where the search for the perfect state is
without end. As Europeans, we have been taught to look with
peculiar respect upon the political aspirations of a single and
immutable temperament: the Greek. That those aspirations,
disappointed in the classical era, eventually found satisfaction;
and, having found, retained it through the numerous centuries of
the Dark and Middle Ages by means of one single political form in
which no change was ever contemplated is often forgotten. Not only
was the achievement unique both in date and duration. But the
example remains today: primarily for the Greeks; especially for the
Mediterranean peoples; and ultimately for the world. It remains not
to be copied; but to illustrate, by its endurance, which of the
eternal demands of peoples it succeeded in satisfying.</p>

<p>Contrasted with the contemporary states of Western Europe, born,
mutilated, stifled at the caprice of each medieval Napoleon, the
Greek Empire preserved always as its prime interest the welfare of
the community as a whole. Its policy might be influenced, but the
entire resources of the state were never as in the West absorbed,
by the private ambitions of princes and prelates and a lesser
nobility always aspiring to be greater. Whatever the changes in
authority, the usurpations, or partitions of the imperial office,
or the personal predilection of its occupants, the administration
continued unaffected; the provinces were governed; the revenues
arrived. The rule of favorites and foreigners, dictated by the
whims and amours of the sovereign, was unknown. The structure of
the Byzantine state was one that neither monarch, nobility, nor
people could sunder. Simultaneously, its cohesion was not
dependent, as today we are accustomed to think essential, on an
aggressive racial consciousness. Its patriotism was of a religious,
mystical nature, linked with the infallibility of the Hellenic
destiny and the championship of Christianity. In this latter
province, moreover, in the daily, hourly exercise of the mystic
faculty, the Greek passion for speculative argument, natural as the
leaves to the tree, was diverted from the tortuous, political
channels where it will always find wreck, to the infinite and
immaterial oceans of personal imagination.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The absolute sovereignty of the Byzantine Emperor "[<i>Greek
characters</i>]&mdash;the faithful in Christ Emperor of the
Romans;" was derived ultimately, often immediately, from the
Senate, the Army, and the People of Constantinople. The monarchy
was elective; and though it frequently happened that the real
initiative lay with the tumultuous popular opinion of the capital,
only the proclamation of an aspirant's claim by the senate or some
section of the army could validate the assumption of imperial
power. Of these bodies, each had to ratify the nomination of the
other; the people followed suit; the election was registered by the
Senate; and the process was completed by coronation. In the event
of disagreement on the side of one of these parties, the issue was
apt to be decided by force, and these occasions have been termed,
with often-questionable justification, usurpations. But once in his
hands, the power was the Emperor's to share with an imperial
partner in his lifetime, or bequeath after his death to his sons,
daughters, relatives, or anyone he might think suitable. Among the
occupants of the throne, a phenomenal level of ability was thus
maintained. Empresses in their own right, or Emperors more
concerned with their subjects' mental than bodily welfare, were
provided with military colleagues. While, simultaneously, dynastic
attachment, most comprehensive of political bonds, was engrained in
the people at no risk of political inefficiency. Throughout the
history of the Empire, this right of election was preserved as a
remedy against such emergencies as a sudden minority or the
extinction of a dynasty.</p>

<p>But despite this nice equilibrium of practical considerations,
nothing could impair the conception of absolute majesty, of divine
power on earth, which clothed the Emperor and caught the emotions
of his subjects and neighbors, till even the adjacent rulers were
fain to reflect what glory they might of it by studied imitation or
actual investiture in their seats at the hands of the Byzantine
monarch. The world was Christ's and the Emperor his living
representative, [<i>Greek Characters</i>], equal of the apostles,
who might even enter the sanctuary with the priests. Like the
Liturgy, the ritual of his days paraphrased the life of his Patron.
Twelve guests ate at his table. Each apartment of the palace was
furnished with a vestry for the changing of his vestments. At
Easter he donned a garb of resurrection. The splendor of his
surroundings dumbfounded the senses. The plenitude of his power
seemed to know no bounds. Such was the visual prospect, designed
mainly for the impression of foreigners. For, in fact, even when
the diadem was safely conferred, he was hemmed with limitations.
While only he could issue and dispense the laws, he was bound also
to uphold them: as the fount of justice accessible at all times to
petition, the people regarded him as their protector against the
aristocracy and bureaucracy. Furthermore, the bureaucracy of
functionaries trained in the Roman tradition, inflexible against
innovation, precluded altogether the pursual of a purely arbitrary
rule. And the bureaucracy, from the Emperor's point of view, was
indispensable, if only as a safeguard against potential discontent
on the part of the Micrasiatic magnates. In short, the letter of
power&mdash;or, indeed, in the case of those who deserved it, the
actuality&mdash;was delegated by the sources of that power to a
depotism of pontifical and symbolic magnificence, sufficient to
focus the scattered allegiance of races and individuals within the
Empire. At the same time, the democratic instincts of the Greeks
were quieted: for their ruler was no longer ordinary man. Thus, for
the first and last time, their susceptible imaginations were
harnessed to their political well-being.</p>

<p>The second, and, in the light of subsequent history, most
significant factor in the stability of the Byzantine Empire, was
the continued vitality, fortified by successive adaptations to the
trend of public need, of the Roman law. While, in the West, from
the sixth to the twelfth centuries, the intentions of equity were
obscured by an inextricable turmoil of Germanic custom and feudal
privilege, within the sphere of Greek rule access to a uniform
machinery of justice was the privilege of all. That it should have
remained so was due to Justinian. Upon his accession in 527, the
collected principles, precedents, and modifications of a thousand
years' legislative activity were beginning, in the provinces at
least, to rob the scales of their balance. Manuals of law were
scarce and expensive. And it was no part of a Greek official's
education to acquire the Latin in which they were written. Actuated
by his vision of a new and homogeneous Mediterranean dominion, the
Emperor, in the first year of his reign, entrusted to his minister,
Tribonian, and nine assistants, the work of revising the existing
codes, with a view to the inclusion of recent legislation and the
elimination of anachronisms. This labor was completed in fourteen
months; and copies of the final code were dispatched to all the
magistrates of the Empire. The next three years were devoted to the
Pandects, wherein 3,000,000 lines of precedents and dicta were
reduced to 150,000. Meanwhile the Institutes, an authorized legal
primer, had been published for the benefit of students and the
regulation of legal training. Haphazard law schools were closed.
And their functions were concentrated in the three centers of Rome,
Constantinople, and Beirut. For future generations henceforth,
despite the occasional subsidence of legal education, the
fundamentals of Roman equity, and the happiness thereby implied,
were the property of the Byzantines. As a monument to that
combination of broad conception with the will to execution which,
in Justinian's case, amounted to genius, his subjects erected an
equestrian statue of him on a pillar at the southwest corner of St.
Sophia, his church and other achievement. Thus, in copper semblance
four times mortal size, with "a great plume on his head the shape
of the tail of a peacock," and a gold orb in his right hand, he
survived for the Turkish armies to wonder at.[*] His body fell to
the crusaders in 1204, who tore the vestments from it. But the work
lived till today. Without the discovery of the Corpus Juris in the
eleventh century, and the assistance of Azo, the Bolognese, to
Bracton, the father of English law, in the thirteenth, the whole
process of European justice must have emerged unaided from a sea of
tenaciously held local habits.</p>

<blockquote>[* The description is taken from Clavijo. A
fourteenth-century drawing of the statue used to exist, and
presumably still does, in the Library of the Serai at
Constantinople.]</blockquote>

<p>During the succeeding centuries, two main epochs were
distinguished for their constructive legislation. In Justinian's
code, certain novelties had been due to the increasing influence of
Christianity in every-day life. The position of wives and children
had been strengthened against the lingering tyranny of the early
Roman householder. The lot of slaves was ameliorated, and pagans
were excluded from civil rights. Under the iconoclast Emperors, who
were the first to attempt substantial modification of Justinian's
original code, this Christian tendency was pushed to Puritan limits
which harmonized with their severe spiritual ideals. The status of
a man's mistress was no longer afforded legal recognition; and
divorce was made more difficult. Simultaneously, the tendency
towards equality in family life was advanced: the position of women
as property owners and guardians brought level with that of men;
and each child secured a share in the inheritance. Exemptions from
justice in favor of rank were suspended: henceforward men were
equal in the sight not only of God, but of the law. This marked the
definite acceptance of one of the fundamental axioms of the modern
state. In the sphere of private morals, however, the reforms were
not permanent. Under the Macedonian Emperors, with whom the second
period of recodification opened, concubinage became once more a
legal state, and the grounds of divorce were made large as
formerly. The Basilica, as the new code was called, was essentially
a reversion to Justinian's original, though further simplified. For
five centuries, until the Turkish conquest, it remained the current
law of the Greek lands, from Mistra to Trebizond. The Pravda, of
early Russia, was simply a transcript of it. And four centuries
later, upon the reconstitution of a Greek state, it was resumed as
the groundwork of modern Greek law.</p>

<p>It is impossible, without crediting the reader with an extensive
knowledge of legal technicality and terminology, to present a
fuller analysis of Byzantine legislation. Let it simply be borne in
mind that those principles of justice which form the basis of
society in twentieth-century France or Scotland, were formerly as
deeply engrained in the subjects of the Greek Empire as in the
inhabitants of those countries today; that a sprinkling of Syrian
custom was incorporated, which was mainly apparent in a
safeguarding of contracts against the native ingenuity of the
Levant, together with an opposition to the law's interference in
family relationships; that there was also a separate canon law
competent to deal with marriages, legacies and suits, where one of
the parties was an ecclesiastic&mdash;though, save in the matter of
royal morals, no Byzantine Thomas &agrave; Becket ever came in
conflict with a state that was itself scarcely secular; and some
idea may be gained of the social security which the Empire enjoyed.
In the provinces the law was administered by particular judges;
while, in the capital, there were special municipal courts under
the supervision of the Eparch of the city. Political suits were
judged by the senate, a body like the English House of Lords, half
noble, half efficient, which, in its character of advisory council,
could initiate, though not put in force, legislation. The final
court of appeal was the Emperor, either in person, or, more
usually, through a court of judges and great ministers known as the
[<i>Greek characters</i>]. Sentence in criminal cases consisted
usually of mutilation or confiscation of property. The supposed
cruelty of the former punishment has been the subject of much
comment. Comparison with the American practice of sterilization
might seem invidious. But it may be remembered in extenuation, that
as a substitute for the death penalty, it gave the sinner time to
preserve at least his soul intact; and that to many a Byzantine,
his mangled body or the world which his blinded eyes could no
longer see, were in any case but transient unrealities compared
with the imminent and vivid glories awaiting him on his deliverance
from mortal trammels. Imprisonment, for a nation of philosophers,
was considered no hardship. But whatever the faults of the system,
whatever the characters of individual Emperors, it was always
considered the first duty of the ruler to uphold the administration
of justice and to enable his subjects to reap its full benefit. To
this doctrine, the Emperors, down to the lowest and the last,
subscribed.</p>

<p>By degrees, however, the careful regulations for legal education
established by Justinian, lapsed; and the science of jurisprudence
fell to the care of the municipal guilds. But in law, as in all
learning, the eleventh century witnessed a revival. In 1045, the
Emperor Constantine IX Monomach refounded the old law school of
Constantinople. How long this institution, in its second version,
survived, is not known. But the Emperor's enterprise illustrates
the reawakened conception of law as a science rather than a mere
set of regulations. Momentous repercussions resulted in the West.
In the schools of Rome and Ravenna the Institutes and Pandects were
already to some extent familiar. But it was Bologna, acting on the
new impulse in the East, that sprang suddenly into international
prominence from the revived study of Justinian's law in its purest
form. The whole of Europe was permeated. And the last survival of
the Roman Hmperial cult, the doctrine of divine right, of royal
absolutism symbolized in court ceremonial and legally defined and
legally advocated, came now to reinforce the shifting bonds of
fealty and vassalage. Hence arose that grotesque conception of
monarchy, unfettered by the checks imposed on its Eastern
counterpart and lacking the smallest guarantee of continued
efficiency, which Louis XIV carried to its pinnacle. The immediate
effect was to discount the theory of papal absolutism; and for the
next two centuries all active legislation in Western Europe owed
its inspiration, directly or indirectly, to Bologna. Bracton, whose
introduction of Roman law and method into his <i>De Legibus et
Consuetudinibus Angliae</i>, created the English legal system,
modeled his work on a treatise of Azo of Bologna. And it was to his
early studies in the same town that Francesco Accursi, coadjutor of
Edward I, owed the legal facility which has brought that king his
greatest fame.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Upholding the Byzantine conceptions of sovereignty and law thus
outlined, there stood that massive and proficient Atlas, the
Byzantine bureaucracy. In the states of Western Europe, the methods
of administration remained in a condition of perpetual flux till
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In Constantinople, by
contrast, though the seventh century saw a change of titles and a
certain redistribution of duties, the essential formation was never
altered. Inherited directly from Rome, the system preserved, until
the time of Justinian, a Latin nomenclature of office and the use
of Latin as an official language. On these grounds, numerous
historians have maintained that, until the seventh century, the
Byzantine Empire was a purely Roman institution; though by an
analogous process of reasoning they might with equal accuracy call
England French from the Conquest to the reign of Henry III. The
main reformation, if it can be thus definitely termed, was part of
the centralizing policy of the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian, who
ascended the throne in 716. For the few great official posts,
relics of the Augustan household, were substituted a body of more
numerous and consequently less independent Logothetes; while the
actuality of power which they thus forfeited was transferred to the
crown; Leo's hypothesis being, as was natural considering his own
temperament and circumstances, that its wearer must always be
inspired by a Napoleonic passion for combined civil and military
activity. From this moment arose that divergence between the
militarists from Asia Minor and the more purely Hellenic civil
service which, in the eleventh century, was to become disastrously
acute. Succeeding years proved, however, that this arrogation of
power to the throne varied in validity with the efficiency of its
occupant; and that, in fact, the strength of the bureaucratic
tradition was little impaired. Nor was there any parliament, any
fluctuating expression of popular fancies and ill judgment, to come
between the sovereignty and its officials and clog the everyday
machinery of the state. (On special occasions popular opinion never
lacked expression: witness the perpetual stultification of the
attempted union of the Churches.) The privy council of the Emperor,
assembling in the sacred precincts of the Great Palace, was at the
same time his executive. Here gathered the Logothetes: the
ministers of the army and navy; of communications, posts, police
and foreign affairs; of finance, the public revenues and the
imperial estates; each with his secretaries; and each reinforced by
the multitudinous and carefully-trained personnel which comprised
his [<i>Greek characters</i>]&mdash;Ministry. These great
functionaries were generally, though not necessarily, recruited,
after passing a difficult examination, from distinguished families
in which public service was a tradition. Each bore two titles: one
denoting his place in the ancient, though not in theory hereditary,
grades of nobility conferred by the Emperor; the other, the actual
business of his office. In this way the hierarchies of rank, each
with its valued privileges, were shared between the claims of birth
and talent. Each official, in his labors, was spurred by the
prospect of higher reward, of wealth derived from both salary and
recognized perquisites, and of honor and insignias which his
contemporaries might respect and envy. All ambition towards
personal advancement was thus directed to the service of the
machine.</p>

<p>In the sphere of provincial administration, the unceasing
pressure on the Empire's frontiers resulted in a gradual negation
of the conditions which Diocletian's reorganization at the end of
the third century had presupposed. A junction of civil and military
authority became inevitable, first materializing, as a sequel to
the outlying conquests of Justinian, in the Exarchates of North
Africa and Spain, and Ravenna. These were ruled by governors who
could make their tenure hereditary and were personally responsible
to the Emperor alone. During the dangerous period of the seventh
century, when the Greeks bore the brunt of the first Moslem
expansion, the system thus inaugurated, though no longer open to
hereditary exploitation, came into force throughout the Empire; and
with its perfection by the Isaurian Emperors that followed, there
came into existence the "themes," as the newly organized provinces
were henceforth known. Each was under the command of a General; and
these soldier-administrators ranked with the powerful officials of
the state, those of the Asiatic provinces taking precedence over
the others. The larger of these territorial units maintained
separate forces of about 10,000 men each, which were charged to the
expense of the local populations. At the same time, a central army
was stationed in or near Constantinople, thus preserving that
mobility of action which had been Diocletian's primary object in
freeing the army from the burden of provincial administration. But
though, under the Isaurian reorganization, the whole military,
financial, and judicial power was concentrated in the hands of the
[<i>Greek characters</i>] or Governor, there was also resident a
civil representative, who was independent of the Governor's
authority and in direct communication with the Palace at
Constantinople. A limit was thus set to those provincial despotisms
which were always potential, and sometimes actual, sources of
insurrection and usurpation. With the coming of the crusaders in
the eleventh century, and the consequent infiltration of feudal
ideas, the imperial practice of granting extensive land tenures,
carrying with them a large measure of <i>de facto</i> personal
jurisdiction, in return for military aid and levies, threatened to
disrupt the administration and interfere with the arrival of the
revenues. On this point, the division between the bureaucrats and
the great military landowners was widest.</p>

<p>The spectacle of a body of trained officials in active
opposition to a virile military party is not one which history
often presents. But for those familiar only with the automata of
Whitehall or the peculators of Washington, the personnel of the
Byzantine bureaucracy is not easily visualized. The vicissitudes
and methods of its schooling may be traced in the history of the
royal universities of Constantinople, which were founded mainly to
that end. First province of learning in which all were to be
instructed, was the humanities; even the texts considered essential
to the molding of these girders of society have been preserved in
the gigantic manual of convention left by the scholar-Emperor,
Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. And it may be to the recognition
of the fact that a clerk will do his work better if he is a human
being as well, that the world owes the infinite copyings of which
one here and one there escaped to tell the modern world of the
wisdom of the ancient. In philosophy, literature, rhetoric, and all
branches of mathematics including astronomy and geometry,
professors were attached to the successive foundations. In 727, the
already existing university of the Octagon was closed by Leo III,
the Isaurian, partly, it may be supposed, on account of its monkish
teachers, partly as the nursery of a class whose influence he was
determined to weaken. A century later, however, the iconoclast
Emperor, Theophilus, was promoting the instruction of mathematics.
And twenty-five years after, the Caesar Bardas, the Regent, opened
what is commonly called the Byzantine Renaissance with his
reconstitution of the university of the Magnavra, in the precincts
of the Great Palace. His work was continued, in the first half of
the tenth century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, under whom
not only were the professors paid, but also the students&mdash;a
clear indication of the purpose for which they were there. All were
personally known to the Emperor; and from their ranks, in due time,
were chosen the judges, the civil servants, and the prelates of the
Church. At length came the glorious reign of Basil II
Bulgaroctonos, who held all forms of learning in open contempt. But
the more prosperity, success, and leisure were theirs, the more the
minds of his subjects turned to their books. It needed only the
accession of a pedant Emperor in the person of Constantine IX
Monomach, husband of Zo&euml;, last but her sister of the
Macedonian dynasty, to bring the bureaucracy, reinforced in popular
opinion by its recent discovery of Plato, into its own again. The
military magnates were ousted from power, and their places taken by
vain academicians, in whose selection birth and tradition were
considered superfluous. In Asia Minor, a system of scutage was
introduced, whereby the obligation on the part of the landowners to
maintain levies for the service of the state was converted into
money, thus weakening both their power and the Empire's borders.
Finally, 1071 saw the disaster which this cleavage had rendered
inevitable. The Byzantine army was almost annihilated on the
Armenian border; the Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes taken prisoner;
and the richest provinces of Asia Minor were lost forever. Before
its reorganization by Alexius I Comnenus on his accession in 1081,
the Byzantine army had almost ceased to exist. But if the fault is
to be laid at the door of the anti-military party, it must be
remembered, in mitigation, that even so strong a monarch as Basil
II had been seriously threatened by insurrections of the
magnates.</p>

<p>The conditions that led to the defeat of Manzikert have been
recounted at some length, because they illustrate the curiously
balanced elements of the Byzantine administration: a liberally
educated civil service working in conjunction with a military
aristocracy. With the loss of the inland themes, the power of the
latter was gone. And though the throne became now the perquisite of
the great families, the backbone of the state was still, as
formerly, the bureaucracy. Not until the middle of the fourteenth
century was the system officially interrupted. It then became
necessary, owing to the perpetual incursions of Turks, Normans,
Italians, and Spaniards, and the consequent isolation of the
capital from the provinces, to create minor autonomies known as
Despotats, under royal governors. Thus the disintegrating Empire
assumed an almost federal character. And Constantinople was shorn
of the few revenues that still remained to her.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>An important, though wholly distinct, function of the central
authority in the capital was the treatment of peoples newly
conquered or subdued. In this the Byzantines sought not only
conciliation, but also to evoke for their civilization and
institutions such a degree of admiration on the part of savage
races that the latter were fain to reflect all they could of the
glory of the queen of cities. In the writings of Constantine VII
Porphyrogenitus, it was laid down as an established principle that
each subject nationality should retain, as far as possible, the
laws and customs peculiar to it. It was also the policy of the
Greeks to make use of the native nobility in the work of local
government. Thus the early Ventian Doges received their pictorially
familiar robes at the hands of the Emperors of Constantinople. And
even after the savage campaigns of Basil II Bulgaroctonos, the
Bulgar nobles were received at Constantinople and invested with the
insignias of Byzantine rank. Some of them, like the Venetians
before them, obtained wives of noble Greek family. The latter was a
common means of securing the goodwill of adjacent potentates, there
existing in the capital no prejudice against the marriage of even
royal princesses to Tartar chieftains and Moslem Emirs. The
far-flung monasteries of the Orthodox Church, together with
travelling missionaries and merchants, helped also to implant the
seeds of a uniform faith and culture. It was, in fact, the aim of
the Byzantine Empire to win the adherence of its subjects and the
submission of its neighbors, not by the imposition of a spurious
nationalism, but by the attraction which the brilliance of a great
civilization must always exercise upon the moth-like tribes within
its sphere of light.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>For the Byzantines, therefore, in three elements lay the
political stability which was the first condition of their
civilization: in sovereignty; in law; and in a trained executive.
The absence of any vestige of parliamentary institution may not
accord with the political ideals of the twentieth century. But
nowhere since its introduction to the Mediterranean countries has
the unhappy fetish of constitutionalism produced efficient
government. And the Greek, above all, with his whole temperament
saturated in political emotion, may well ask himself the question:
How did a seeming autocracy maintain the efficacy of the Byzantine
state without offense to his democratic susceptibilities? The
secret lies in that uncommon adjustment of forces which the
Mediterranean peoples have yet to rediscover.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-7"></a>Chapter 7. Trade and the Bezant</h3>

<p>It is the habit of contemporaries, when their attention is
diverted to the glories of the past, to recall with critical
distaste the uncouth conditions of living that accompanied them.
The radiance of the <i>Roi Soleil</i> is dimmed at recollection of
the uses to which the stairs of Versailles were habitually put. The
English Renaissance is more sullied by the prospect of Henry VIII's
single cambric shirt than by all the executions of Bloody Mary. And
to what purpose Parthenon and Coliseum, when prosperous citizens
beneath them lived in mud huts and stone cubicles? Through all the
history of Europe, it is only in the case of Constantinople that
these nervous queries do not arise. The amenities of life were
proportionate to the Empire's wealth. And there is no more
remarkable proof of the unique position occupied in history by
medieval Greek civilization than the size of the Byzantine budgets,
which have remained, computed on the bullion value of their gold
alone, without precedent until the present age. This wealth was the
great auxiliary condition of the Empire's stability. It remains to
discover whence it was derived; what its amount; and of what nature
its international consequence.</p>

<p>It has been said that the transference of the Roman capital to
Constantinople opened up the East as the discovery of Columbus did
America. Whatever the exaggeration of this statement, it was here,
henceforth, at this thwarted kiss of two continents, that the trade
between the richest extremities of Europe, Asia and Africa, was
sucked and spewed at the lips of the Golden Horn. Through Antioch
and Alexandria, till their conquest by the Moslems, through
Salonica, Trebizond and Cherson, the streams of commerce flowed.
From Hungary, Germany, and Central Europe; from the Adriatic by the
road from Durazzo; from Kiev and the early Russian states, down the
Dnieper and the Don, to the Black Sea; and from Samarcand, Bokhara,
and the Caspian; from Persia, India, and China; from Ceylon, from
Abyssinia and the heart of Africa up the Red Sea; from every degree
of the compass came the caravans and fleets, to pour their dues
into the imperial customs, and dump their goods in the
clearinghouse of Constantinople, the "middleman" of three
continents. Furthermore, in the eyes of three continents, or rather
their adjacent territories comprised in the Levant, the city stood
as a symbol of security in a discordant and unstable world. Not
once in nine centuries was the Byzantine government bankrupt; and
for nine centuries the walls remained impregnable by land and sea
against the ebb and flow of Islam and the barbarous contacts with
the North. The European, the Levantine, horizon, offered no
comparable safety. Countless sums were invested from without in
this universal trust. And for the Moslem, here was a depository
where he could obtain the interest on his money that his faith
forbade. Under every impulse, from every quarter, wealth converged.
Good position and good reputation are familiar slogans. For
Constantinople, as with other institutions, they formed the basis
of commercial prosperity. The Greeks themselves were wont to say
that two-thirds of all the world's riches were concentrated within
the city's walls.</p>

<p>Of the merchandise that arrived in the capital, the greater part
was raw material; and even of this much was redistributed in the
West. All the hackneyed refinements of our medieval life, those
treasured spices and medicaments, were introduced, prior to the
thirteenth century, from the Byzantine mart. From India came pepper
and musk, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and camphor; from Persia,
sugar; from China, ginger and rhubarb. Aloes and balsam, preserved
fruits, curative nuts, and Arabian incense accompanied them. For
the manufacture of those <i>objets d'art</i>, of which book covers
and reliquaries filtered through to the West, and some still
survive in such sanctuaries as Athos, the traders brought ivory and
amber, pearls and precious stones; for the coloring of enamels,
mosaic cubes, and manuscript illuminations, saffron, indigo, alum
and gum. In the heyday of commerce, before the eruption of the
Mongol races beyond the Oxus, porcelain from China and glass from
Mesopotamia were imported ready-made. Byzantine looms received
their flax from Egypt, their cotton from Syria and Armenia; while
the names Muslin, Taffeta, and Damask bespeak the large trade in
the finished textiles of the East. Coasting round the shores of the
Black Sea in their river-built boats, the Russians contributed gold
and silver, honey, wax, furs, corn, fruit, and slaves. Every
foreign merchant arriving in Constantinople was obliged to report
to the state authorities. He was permitted to remain three months;
and if by that time his wares were not sold, the state undertook to
dispose of them on his behalf.</p>

<p>Within the city, the various craftsmen were organized in guilds,
which were under the supervision of the Eparch. Consumer and
producer alike were protected from the middleman; wages and hours
were fixed; and any form of trade competition or possibility of the
concentration of trade control in the hands of an oligarchy of
capitalists was out of the question. Each guild purchased the raw
material for its members at prices fixed by the state. Its wares
were exposed for sale only in specified places, the more precious
trades, such as the goldsmiths and silversmiths, enamellers and
glassmakers, being grouped together near the entrance to the Great
Palace under semi-royal patronage. Artists also were protected,
particularly by such Emperors as Theodosius II or Constantine VII
Porphyrogenitus, who were themselves painters. But the most
jealously guarded of all the industries was the manufacture of the
magnificent silken stuffs, which the Byzantines prized above
jewels, and of which the export was absolutely prohibited. The
story is famous of how the Holy Roman Ambassador of the tenth
century, Liutprand, on his second mission to Constantinople, was
deprived by zealous officials of the very stuffs with which he had
been officially presented in the capital.</p>

<p>Until the time of Justinian, all raw silk necessary for the
production of these stuffs was sent from China to Ceylon, whence it
was eventually fetched by sea to the Persian Gulf and transported
thence overland. The Persians had thus a monopoly of the carrying
trade, from which they did not hesitate to profit at the expense of
the Byzantines. About 550, however, so the story runs, some
Nestorian missionaries succeeded in smuggling eggs of the silkworm
over the Chinese border. And it is certain that within a decade the
silk industry was fully established round Constantinople.
Thenceforth, it was the most fostered business of the Empire; the
prosperity of old Greece and the Morea was reconstituted by it; and
the European monopoly thus inaugurated was maintained intact till
the eleventh century, when Roger Guiscard transported the secret
and the insects from Thebes and Corinth to Palermo. After the
fourth crusade, the Nicaean Emperors continued to protect it, John
III Vatatzes even forcing his subjects to wear materials of Greek
manufacture rather than those imported from the West. And its
vitality may be estimated by the magnificence of the stuffs which
Greek workmen, adhering to the traditional patterns, continued to
produce after the Turkish conquest. But the almost sacred character
that attached to the most precious fabrics was due to more than
their artistic value or intrinsic worth, large as both were. From
the royal purple, or scarlet as it was in fact, with its woven
golden pattern of encircled eagles, through the numerous shades,
lemon, rose, and apple-green, and the numerous devices, ivy leaves,
roses, arabesques, each variety constituted an insignia of rank or
office. When the Emperor travelled, chests of them accompanied him
for distribution to local governors and envoys; and visiting
monarchs, such as Amaury I of Jerusalem in 1171, were loaded with
similar presents. Half the majesty of the imperial court was
enshrined in these uniforms. And was the fount of honor to be
smirched by the casual barter of its vestments for any barbarous
chieftain or Norman upstart to assume? Only the nondescript might
be exported. And the demand from within the Empire was large
enough. Visitors to Constantinople testify to the splendor of the
inhabitants; each man says Benjamin of Tudela, in the second half
of the twelfth century, was clothed like a prince.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Thus, as is the fortune also of a world linked by rapid
transport, commerce brought to the mediaeval Greeks all those
amenities of life which were the particular discoveries of other
races. Hence derived the profusion and universality of that
financial phenomenon, the Byzantine gold coinage. Even today, in
England, the "bezant" is still familiar as a heraldic synonym for a
gold piece. Prior to the fourth crusade it constituted the greater
part of the portable wealth of Europe. And in the nineteenth
century, treasuries of conquered Indian princes were found by
British soldiers filled with coins bearing the pontifical impress
of the Greek Emperors of the East.</p>

<p>The Byzantine budgets, after the manner of modern, were
calculated every year. Of subsidiary income, the chief sources were
patents and monopolies, mines and arsenals, and the extensive
crown-lands. Such expedients as the debasement of the coinage or
the sale of titles were adopted only in the last desperate years,
the Emperor Alexius I Comnenus's trial of the former at the close
of the eleventh century having been only temporary. The main
revenue, however, was derived from the customs dues and the land
tax. The former were collected in enormous profusion in the
capital, and also at all frontiers. The latter, which, since land
was the staple investment, corresponded to the present-day income
tax, was assessed on a detailed scale of values. House property
remained in one category. Agriculturally, the theoretical unit of
taxation consisted in the natural resources capable of maintaining
a single man: five acres in the case of vineyard, twenty in that of
plough, and in an olive grove, 225 trees. The system had faults:
monastic and military landlords were often exempt; the nobles might
manage to avoid the tax; and in such cases an added onus was
consequently borne by the small cultivator. To remedy this
condition, and to ensure the identity of estimate and revenue
received, districts were made collectively responsible for the
production of the sums for which they were assessed. Nevertheless,
though the rich could not then so easily escape, the smaller
independent proprietors, obliged in bad years to sell their
freeholds in return for assistance in paying their share, tended to
become absorbed by the larger. This process was to some extent
checked by the legislation of the Isaurian and Macedonian Emperors.
The everlasting and most urgent problem before the central
administration was to ensure the honesty of the tax collectors.
Measures to this end were generally among the first reforms of an
able ruler.</p>

<p>While it is impossible, owing to lack of evidence, to arrive at
any exact analysis of Byzantine finance, certain isolated
statistics[*] are available to corroborate the travelers' fables
and the encrusted splendor of such few <i>objets d'art</i> as have
survived into the present. Where large sums were concerned, the
general monetary unit seems to have been the pound of gold: worth,
as pure bullion, slightly less than &pound;43. It has been computed
that the purchasing power of precious metal in the Middle Age was
five times greater than it is in our own. And though this
comparison is open to dispute, the fact that the Byzantine Emperor
Theophilus was paying &pound;85 in bullion (two pounds of gold) for
a horse, while his contemporary, Egbert, could get one for
two-thirds of a pound of silver, illustrates the enormous
purchasing power of Byzantine gold at least outside the capital.
&pound;85 for a horse may seem on the other hand to denote
exceedingly high prices inside it; but the Byzantine nobles were
enthusiastic breeders of horses, especially for polo; and
&pound;425 (&pound;85 x 5) would not today be considered an
unreasonable price for a first-class pony. There seems, in fact,
justification for ascribing to the intrinsic metal of the bezant a
quintuple value in modern terms. The history of Western Europe
before the discovery of America teems with problems arising from
the shortage of currency. And if it is open to doubt whether a
pound of gold was always worth &pound;215 (&pound;43 x 5) in
Constantinople, it seems probable that, outside, its power of
purchase was even greater.</p>

<p>[* The following figures are only calculated approximately. For
more detailed analysis, see Andr&eacute;ad&egrave;s's <i>Le montant
du budget de l'Empire byzantin</i>.]</p>

<p>It is recorded by both Benjamin of Tudela and the Venetians that
the Comneni Emperors drew yearly between four and five million
pounds sterling in specie from Constantinople alone: an income
which, in modern parlance as defined above, benefited the
government to the extent of &pound;20,000,000 annually. The island
of Corfu, at the same period, contributed a yearly 1500 pounds of
gold, &pound;64,000 in metal and &pound;320,000 in purchasing
power. Following the sack of the capital in 1204, the crusading
barons, after consulting the existing accounts, guaranteed the
Emperor Baldwin I an annual income of approximately
&pound;6,300,000 in specie. This was from but a quarter of the
Empire; and it has, therefore, been deduced that under the Comneni,
the whole annual revenue, already, be it remembered, considerably
shrunk since the days of the Macedonians, amounted in terms of
purchasing capacity to &pound;126,000,000. However hypothetical
this figure, it is interesting to compare it with those received by
the British Exchequer in 1883-1884 and 1913-1914, which totaled
&pound;86,999,564 and &pound;195,640,000 respectively.
Proportionately, reserves in bullion of &pound;5,500,000 and
&pound;10,000,000 (&pound;27,500,000 and &pound;50,000,000 in
purchasing value) were left by the Emperors Theophilus and Basil II
Bulgaroctonos in the imperial treasury. The two millions
laboriously hoarded by King Henry VII of England five hundred years
later, to the grateful astonishment of his subjects, fade into
insignificance. And an idea of the diffusion of wealth in humbler
places may be gathered from the fact that in 935 two thousand male
inhabitants of the Peloponnese paid &pound;4280 in specie as
commutation for military service: an average, in terms of
purchasing value, of &pound;10, 14s. apiece.</p>

<p>The part played by this wealth in maintaining the stability of
the Byzantine Empire is apparent by contrast with the states of
Western Europe, where permanent services, such as a standing army,
fleet, or bureaucracy, were almost entirely precluded, owing to the
difficulty of raising sufficient coin for their wages. As a rule,
the only rewards that a king could offer his adherents were land
and hereditary privilege. Hence the perpetual expansion of
feudalism and the perpetual scourge of civil war that accompanied
it. In the East, on the other hand, the political organism rested
on its money, and in the end failed with it. At the center, the
expenses of concentrating the whole of Byzantine majesty in the
imperial office were enormous. Vast public works at royal charge,
fortresses, walls and aqueducts; intimate and bewilderingly
splendid private edifices; a daily ceremonial involving the
employment of thousands; an interminable ritual of present giving
and largess throwing; bounties, hospitals, and religious
foundations; altogether a prodigality as lavish and beneficial as
it has generally been called purposeless and vulgar, was prescribed
by custom and expediency. Focused round the palace, the Logothetes
and their ministries of trained officials demanded enormous upkeep,
particularly that of Foreign Affairs, or of the Barbarians, as it
was Hellenically designated. In the archives of this, were records
of the characteristics of every people with which the Empire was in
contact, their strengths, and weaknesses, their leading families,
and the particular presents that they most appreciated. The bulk of
the latter was doubtless bullion, and whole nations were kept in
fief by subsidies which historians persist in terming tributes. The
cost of rebuilding Milan during the struggle with Barbarossa was
defrayed by the gold of the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus; the massacre
of Normans in 1282, known as the Sicilian Vespers, by that of
Michael VIII Palaeologus. And four and a half centuries earlier,
when John the Grammarian was dispatched on embassy to Baghdad by
the Emperor Theophilus, he took with him a sum of nearly
&pound;90,000 in purchasing value, which he distributed "like the
sand of the sea."</p>

<p>The chief responsibilities of the treasury, after the support of
the court and central ministries, were the army and navy and the
provincial administrations. Salaries, even of private soldiers,
would seem to have been high. In 809, King Kroum of Bulgaria
captured 11,000 pounds of gold, equal to &pound;470,000 in specie,
and in reality worth some &pound;2,350,000, which was being
transported with the army for its payment. And in 949 the Emperor
Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus notes that an expedition to Crete
of 14,459 men cost 3706 pounds of gold, in other words
&pound;159,000 in specie and &pound;795,000 in actual value. A
comparative table of salaries recorded by that Emperor in the
middle of the tenth century, and translated into purchasing value,
together with those current in the British Empire immediately
before the outbreak of the Great War, reveals a curious
approximation:</p>

<blockquote>[Table not reproduced here.]</blockquote>

<p>In the cases of New Zealand, the civil and military commands are
combined, as they were in the person of the Byzantine [<i>Greek
characters</i>], or Governor. It may also be noticed in passing
that the chair of philosophy in the University founded by the
Emperor Constantine IX Monomach in the middle of the eleventh
century, was worth &pound;856 a year, exclusive of keep and titles.
This compares favorably with the &pound;800 a year, supplemented by
rooms in college, which was received by the occupants of the three
philosophic chairs in Oxford before the Great War.</p>

<p>Thus by means of a constant system of reward, prejudicial to no
interest of the state, was the best service of officials
assured.</p>

<p>It is remarkable to think that while the world today conducts
its affairs almost wholly by written draft, transactions in the
Byzantine sphere involved transportation of the actual gold; that
in fact the medieval Greeks conducted a finance of almost modern
dimensions without the assistance of the modern credit system.
Produced by the Empire's trade, the bezant was absorbed in the
Empire's welfare, social and political. Yet there was more involved
in the Byzantine Dives than domestic accounts. The repercussion was
international. Fluttering at the golden beacon, the lazzaroni of
Europe and Asia alike beseeched commercial favors of the imperial
government. And just as at Constantinople there arose the first
systematization of European diplomatic procedure, it was there also
that the first principles of the extraterritoriality of ambassadors
and the treatment of resident foreigners were formulated. Racial
and religious distinctions, save where Christological heresies were
concerned, were viewed with toleration. The Jews, hounded over the
face of the earth, found refuge behind the walls of Galata. And the
crusaders, to their inexpressible indignation, discovered in the
city a Saracen mosque of official construction, where services for
the Moslem residents were conducted in the full light of day. This
magnetic cosmopolitanism which stamped medieval Greek civilization,
was definitely organized, and from the tenth century on, exercised
an increasing influence on the policies of the West.</p>

<p>The earliest and most pertinacious of the regular traders seem
to have been the Russians. The peculiar structure of the first
Russian city-states, based on a commercial rather than a
territorial authority over the neighboring magnates, rendered
Byzantine trade indispensable to their existence. For what reasons
their intercourse with Constantinople was threatened, history does
not record. But whatever the circumstances, they were prepared, if
necessary, to preserve it by force; and many a fleet from the great
rivers above the Black Sea was repulsed from the city walls by
Greek arms and Greek fire. In 911, however, an agreement was
reached which constituted the first of the famous "Capitulations;"
and the first enunciation of the principle of extraterritoriality.
The rules were strict. The Russian merchants were allotted their
own quarter; but they were forbidden to enter the town save by one
gate; they were to be disarmed; their numbers might not exceed
fifty; and they could remain no longer than a winter. It was with
them, moreover, that there came those Scandinavian adventurers who
formed the original nucleus of the Varangian Guard, which
surrounded the Emperor's person, and was to prove the refuge of
numerous adherents of King Harold of England, exiled after the
Norman Conquest of 1066, whose descendants are mentioned by the
chroniclers of the fourth crusade. Left in freedom by the
government, for many years these Saxons retained their language,
dress, and weapons. And the tiny basilica church, dedicated to SS.
Nicolas and Augustine of Canterbury, which tradition assigns to
them, may still be seen among the lettuce beds and melons of a
Stambul back garden.[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* The church is now known as Bogdan Serai. Up till
1865, tombstones of the Varangians still existed on a tower in the
vicinity. In that year, the request of the British Ambassador that
they might be removed to the British cemetery at Scutari prompted
the Turks to use them for building purposes. The copies of the
inscriptions, which were taken, were accidentally burnt in 1870.
And any record of the transactions that may have survived has been
consigned by the fantastic humor of the Foreign Office to a gaol in
Cambridge. Such is the valley of historical research.]</blockquote>

<p>It was, however, with the advent of the Italians that the form
in which the Capitulations have descended to the present century
crystallized. Actual dates are obscure; but it appears that the
Amalfitans, in the middle of the eleventh century, were the first
to obtain a wharf on the Golden Horn. In 1082, they were followed
by the Venetians, to whom, in return for the assistance of their
fleet against the Normans at Durazzo, the Emperor Alexius I
Comnenus granted complete immunity in all the ports of the Empire
from the dues which were the chief source of the state revenues,
and which even the Greek merchants themselves were obliged to pay.
Before the century was out, the Genoese were also established. And
in 1110, as counterbalance to the fleets of the first crusaders,
the Pisans were provided with a quay, and allotted seats both in
the Hippodrome and St. Sophia, an illuminating sidelight on the
thoroughness of Byzantine hospitality. Each colony had its own
bazaars, its own courts&mdash;abolished by the Turks in
1923&mdash;and its own baily, who combined the functions of
magistrate and captain.</p>

<p>Enormous success attended their ventures. So important did
Venetian interests in the Levant become, that, during the Latin
Empire, the transference to Constantinople of the Doge himself was
mooted. And at the end of the twelfth century, there were said to
be more than 60,000 Italians in the settlements on the Galata side
of the Golden Horn. Benjamin of Tudela, writing on the careless,
prosperous eve of the catastrophic fourth crusade, enumerates the
diverse merchant throng: Syrians from Babylon and Palestine,
Persians and Egyptians, Russians and Hungarians, Patzinaks and
Bulgars, Lombards and Spaniards, Georgians, Armenians and Turks,
Christian and Mohammedan, Latin and Greek, elbowing down the narrow
streets, where today the same and yet others with them mount the
trams or glide past in limousines. For the Capitulations, like most
Byzantine institutions, were borrowed by the Turks to fill the
deficiency in their own nomad evolution. Those of the Genoese and
Venetians were ratified in 1453, and the conquered Greeks and
resident Armenians simultaneously were invested with a similar
status under the control of their respective Churches. Then in
1536, the French, allied with the Sultan against Charles v,
obtained the same concessions. And after them the English. The West
was again arrived.</p>

<p>While the Italians were thus discovering the Eastern trade
routes, preparatory to diverting them from Constantinople
altogether, the Greek loss was proportionate to their gain.
Byzantine enterprise, already inert with excessive prosperity, was
crippled by the insensate preference granted to the Venetians under
the Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. The carrying trade of the Levant
fell into other hands. Unlike the Italians, rich Greeks were too
cautious to invest their money in the uncertain fortunes of trading
ships. By 1150, after sixty-eight years of the Venetian
Capitulations, commerce and the revenue resulting there from were
said to have decreased by a half. Advancing in wealth as everyone
else declined; saddled with the marauding reputation of their
fellow Westerners, the earlier crusaders; and communicants of a
detested and heretical church; the Latins of Constantinople became
the object of increasing popular hatred. Political relations with
the Doge were strained by the Byzantine successes on the Dalmatian
coast. In 1171, the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus arrested all the
Venetians in the city, confiscated their property, and deprived
them of their privileges. In 1175, normal relations were restored.
But seven years later, in the tumult that followed the accession of
Andronicus I Comnenus, the Latins, who had espoused the cause of
his opponents, the Protosebastos Alexius Comnenus and the
Empress-Regent, Mary of Antioch, fell victims to the uncontrolled
mob. Priests, women, children, and even the sick, were massacred.
With the exception of such as found refuge on board the ships in
the harbor, scarcely an Italian survived. The council rooms of the
West, already thick with projects for an attack on what was still
the city of fabulous wealth, quickened their preparations. In 1185,
the Normans sacked Salonica; in 1189, Barbarossa meted similar fate
to Adrianople. The confusion consequent on the extinction of the
Comnenus dynasty at length offered opportunity of which the
champions of the Cross were not slow to take advantage. They were
led by the Venetians. And the Venetians were drawn East by the lure
not of land, but of trade and wealth. The astonishment of the
Western host on arrival at Constantinople can scarcely find words.
Not all the riches of the fifty richest cities in the world, says
Robert de Clary, could surpass those of this. According to
Villehardouin:</p>

<blockquote><i>Vous pouvez savoir qu'ils regard&egrave;rent
beaucoup Constantinople ceux qui jamais ne l'avaient vue; car ils
ne pouvaient penser qu'il p&ucirc;t &ecirc;tre en tout le monde une
si riche ville, quand ils virent ces hauts murs et ces riches tours
dont elle &eacute;tait close tout entour &acirc; la ronde, et ces
riches palais et ces hautes &eacute;glises dont il y avait tant que
nul ne le p&ucirc;t croire s'il ne l'e&ucirc;t vu de ses
yeux...</i>
</blockquote>

<p>You can tell that those who had never seen Constantinople were
filled with awe. For they could not have imagined that there could
be such a rich city anywhere in the world when they saw those high
walls and those rich towers completely surrounding it, and those
rich palaces and those tall churches too numerous to believe if
they had not seen them with their own eyes.</p>

<p>And he writes of the Great Palace after the sack:</p>

<blockquote><i>Du tr&eacute;sor qui &eacute;tait en ce palais il
n'en faut pas parler; car il y en avait tant que c'&eacute;tait
sans fin ni mesure.[*]</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>[* Modern French rendering.]</blockquote>

<p>The treasure that was in this palace was beyond telling: there
was so much that it seemed unending and beyond measure.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enumerate in a breath "the consequences of
the fourth crusade." The social disorganization of the Empire, the
ruin of its capital, the disastrous resurgence of Slays and Turks
on either side, were all among them. But one above all was
outstanding, and was destined to render the decline in Greek
fortunes irrevocable. This was the absolute loss of Levantine
commerce. At the parcellation of the Byzantine territories in 1104,
the Venetians had appropriated all the chief islands and ports as
outposts for their wharves and warehouses; and the majority of
these they retained after the reoccupation of Constantinople by the
Greeks. Furthermore, the immunities that they had formerly
possessed were now the property of the Genoese, to whom they had
been pledged in 1261 by the Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus, in
return for the assistance of their fleet. As a result, the
financial predicament of the Empire during the last two centuries
of its existence was piteous. There were no ships; and the annual
income derived from the customs by the Genoese on the north side of
the Golden Horn was seven times as great as that of the Greeks from
the same source on the south. The Emperors were at their wits' end.
Writing in the middle of the fourteenth century, the Emperor John
VI Cantacuzene laments: "Nowhere is there any money. The reserves
are spent; the royal jewels sold; and the taxes do not materialize,
the country being entirely ruined." At the marriage feast of John y
Palaeologus, there was not a piece of plate, either gold or silver,
on the table. And some twenty years later, the same Emperor was
actually detained in Venice for debt. In 142.3, Salonica, the
second town of the Empire, whither formerly a fair like that of
Novgorod had drawn the merchants of three continents, was sold to
the Venetians for 50,000 ducats. Yet buildings, mosaics, paintings,
stuffs, and silver and gold, jeweled and enameled, have descended
from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Their extreme splendor
indicates not necessarily exaggeration on the part of plaintive
contemporaries, but rather a criterion of those vast riches which,
productive of an even greater splendor, had been once the
complement in stability of the Byzantine political genius.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-8"></a>Chapter 8. The Quest of Reality</h3>

<p>The difference between art and religion is that, while the
former seeks to express the <i>processes</i> of man's communion
with Reality&mdash;in other words, the emotions&mdash;the latter
seeks Reality itself, seeks to track it down, to unravel it from
the illusions of the flesh with which the emotions are inter-wed,
and to pin it to the mind for the furtherance and ultimate
fulfillment of man's spiritual progression. But if religion is the
hunting of Reality, what is Reality? On that rock, the voyage of
all the world's thinking has been split. But one at least of its
attributes, the present recognizes which the immediate past has
not. Reality&mdash;or rather, that vague, instinctive conception of
it with which everyone is born, and which a classically conceived
education immediately relegates to subconscious
depths&mdash;Reality provides the criterion which must determine
and coordinate the basic significance of every object, action, and
theory. We may commemorate, on Whit Sunday, the good service of
Christianity. We may retain our concept of a divine fatherhood
watching from above. But in the twentieth century, the unending
creep of spiritual ascension has led our quest beyond the
invocation of God's emissaries (their authenticity is not under
discussion) and the search for grace in physical sacraments
physically hallowed. In the first burst of the Renaissance; in the
French Revolution; in the feverish dawn of mechanical discovery,
others also preened themselves on arrival at this detachment.
Detachment? Theirs was no detachment. They were sucking still the
breasts of Reason, that portentous, Roman-nosed goddess, gay with
the pallor of perpetual disinterment. Cross and classicism met;
fought; fused; now perish of interaction. We in our present age,
turning a point in the world's history, induct, if we can, an
enlarged quest of Reality; we poise tentatively for another pace in
the progression of <i>homo sapiens</i>. Every object, action,
theory, shall contribute to our religion, if such we call it. With
science, we have left our suckling. But what do we await?</p>

<p>In such case, also, during the third and fourth centuries, were
the Greeks and the habitants of the Hellenized Roman Empire. Done
with rationalism,[*] they, too, were awaiting. Christianity came,
and was hailed to Europe by the mystic cravings of their later
philosophies. And the intellects of the Greek East, Paul,
Athanasius and the early Councils, forged the steel of a dogma that
should withstand the insidious logical cult of the South. The new
religion was adopted by the state; and the state's first action was
the transfer of its center to the Greek lands. Constantinople, the
[<i>Greek characters</i>], was the first Christian capital of the
first Christian empire. It was then, in 330, not in the year 1 CE,
that the Christian era was begun. And the Greeks were its
custodians. This it was that constituted the heritage of the
Byzantines, that gave them their traditions and their national
pride. Every aspect of their lives was implicit with the Cross.
They were as saturated in the Christian religion, as the modern
English in the gentleman's code.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Chapter 3, pages 31-34 Chapter 4, pages
56-64.]</blockquote>

<p>In the opinion of the Victorian rationalist, medievalism, by
which is meant the permeation of everyday life with the
supranatural, or, conversely, the pursuit of God's personal Reality
in every incident of everyday life, was a quaint joke, a phase of
Gothic interiors and chivalresque romance, but fettered with
illusion, superstition, and intellectual impotence. Miracles, it
was said, have not, and do not, happen. In Constantinople, among
the Byzantines, where the crystal threads of medievalism were spun
to heaven unclouded by the materialism of Western Catholicism, let
it be understood: miracles did happen. Theirs was the commonest of
agencies. For, in the eyes of the Byzantine, mortal life was a
maze-like venture amid non-terrestrial forces, demoniac and divine,
circling around him, imminent and overwhelming. With the demons
pressing on him, tempting him and bringing him misfortune, how else
combat them than by miracles, how otherwise be sure of God's
counsel and support? Unless it be definitely recognized that among
the medieval Greeks miraculous intervention was frequent in every
grade of event, it is impossible to comprehend the Byzantine
mentality. To call Byzantine society theocratic would be
exaggeration. But to call it secular would be untruth.</p>

<p>In this environment of ghostly prodigy, religion assumed for the
Byzantine a daily, hourly import. But the two are not to be
identified. Miracles were miracles, natural phenomena of the
Byzantine world, such as trees or thunderstorms. Theology, the
Christian duty, and the sublimation of the body, lay apart on a
higher plane, admittant of individual interpretation. For the
peasant, the miracle constituted perhaps the most potent factor in
spiritual belief. But for the majority, the exercise of the
religious faculty was something actually creative, barren for
posterity, ridiculous to historians, but to men steeped in
communion with invisible Forces, sufficient to summon all their
artistry to its pursual and allegiance. Orthodoxy, the analysis and
definition of the Christian's triple Godhead, was essentially the
prerogative of a people trained in the refinements of logic by the
very <i>nuances</i> of their language. It was the prerogative of
the Fathers; and in the opinion of the lesser men, from the Emperor
in his court to the craftsman at his booth, it was their
prerogative as well. To embrace the monastic profession in middle
age was but the culmination of life's predominant hobby, the
probing of God's mystery and man's destiny. 'This acute popular
interest in religion finds some analogy in the Puritan enthusiasms
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. And it is possible
that, had Byzantine culture and Greek intelligence survived in the
fullness of the Empire's political glory to form the basis of a
general East European civilization, there must early have come
about an Eastern Reformation which would have joined forces with
the North and held a successful balance against the withering
mental influence of the counter-reformed Roman Church.</p>

<p>This social and temperamental fixation on the transcendental
revolved round two institutions, officially united, but distinct in
their influence. One was monasticism, the other the Church.
Surviving unchanged till the present time, both have exercised
profound effect on the history of the Levant. But for them, it is
doubtful whether the Hellenic rationality would now exist.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>To comprehend the significance of Greek monasticism&mdash;the
lesser of the two, but the more immediate in its personal contact
with the people&mdash;it is necessary to trace the Christian
ascetic ideal to its root. During the first two centuries after
Christ, the Christian life implied, for all its professors, an
ascetic warfare, a continued and combatant service against the
world and the flesh. But with the gradual transformation of the new
brotherhood from an exclusive minority into a commonplace majority,
the more fervent felt the call to demarcate still further the
barrier between themselves and average humanity. This impulse
assumed, in Egypt and Syria, an eremitic form. Wild solitaries,
mouths a-work with divine revelation, sprinkled the caves of the
desert. Amongst them, divested of all his possessions, launched St.
Anthony in the last years of the third century, to battle through
two decades of solitude with demons whose actuality was such that
the clamor of the fight could be heard by the awe-struck listeners
outside his retreat. Eventually he emerged, to form the nucleus of
an anchorite community. His life, written by St. Athanasius, was
translated into Latin and spread to the West. The consequence was
enormous. Throughout Europe, monks and miracles now entered the
accepted order of things. And the Dark and Middle Ages thenceforth
assumed that peculiar complexion of unreality which makes them so
defiant of our understanding.</p>

<p>This first stage in monasticism, the ideal of solitude as
historically typified by St. Anthony's earlier life, never ceased
to exercise its attraction on the Greeks. In the popular estimate,
the pure achievement of corporeal subjection rendered the Stylite
on his pillar, or the hermit vermin-eaten in his fastness, objects
of heroic veneration. And the saints were in fact the fathers of
the people. Let disease or misfortune come: the holy man was at
hand. Let landowner oppress or bureaucrat extort: the champion of
the poor was waiting. For what could an anchorite suffer at the
hands of authority? The world could lose him nothing. He stood,
rather, to gain a martyr's crown.</p>

<p>The second stage in the development of the monastic idea was
begun by St. Anthony and perfected by his contemporary, St.
Pachomius. This was the association of hermits in loose
organizations for purposes of worship and economic maintenance. But
the ideal of solitary self-communion remained. And to exchange the
intermittent glimpse of a fellow recluse for unbroken isolation was
considered advance to a higher life. It was St. Basil, in the
middle of the fourth century, who first repudiated this Oriental
conception of the perfect existence, and formulated, in opposition
to it, the precepts of a restricted communism. To him, St. Benedict
owed the inspiration, which, a century later, he implanted in the
Latin West.</p>

<p>The achievement of St. Basil in this third phase was twofold.
First and foremost he brought the monastic ideal within reach of
the ordinary man. In his view, the competitive and artificial
mortifications of the hermit were at variance with the true pattern
of Christian life. That, in reality, he held, was to be found in a
cenobitic fraternity, demanding not feats of endurance, but an
absolute equality of property, comfort, and worship, vested in each
member of the monastery. Here could those weaker men find refuge,
who lacked the fiery mysticism of the anchorite. And, secondly,
monasticism was now brought into definite relation with Church and
state. In the economy of the latter the monks must take their part.
Charitable and educational activities for the benefit of the laity
were henceforth to be part of their functions. By the time of
Justinian their position was recognized and regulated in both civil
and ecclesiastical law. And from a condition which threatened to
reduce them to packs of fanatical dervishes, they gradually assumed
a primary importance in the official hierarchy. Convents for women,
of almost equal frequency, were organized on the same basis.</p>

<p>The precepts of St. Basil could in no sense be called a rule of
life. By the eighth century, the prevailing laxity and illiteracy
of the monks had drawn on them the Puritan wrath of the first
iconoclast Emperors, those stern realists who could not easily
tolerate the useless absorption of wealth and energy which seemed
to be the chief function of monastic institutions. But the
situation was altered by the advent of Theodore of Studium, whose
detailed regulations for the guidance of the monks of the monastery
of St. John of Studium, whose abbot he was, opened a new era of
religious fervor, and sought, moreover, to promote such activities
as the copying of books, which might benefit society as a whole. To
this source, the Carlovingian revival in the Western Church, which
was to culminate in the reforms of Cluny a century later,
undoubtedly owed part of its inspiration. And here, also, was a
precedent for the new community of St. Athanasius of Athos, which
was ultimately to furnish a monastic prototype for the whole
Slavonic world.</p>

<p>This was the fourth stage. Henceforth, the growth of the
monasteries knew no curb. Even the mystic Emperor Nicephorus II
Phocas, himself the patron who suggested and made possible the
venture of St. Athanasius, sought to check their acquisition of
property by a law analogous to the English statute of Mortmain,
<i>de Religiosis</i>. But Basil II Bulgaroctonos was obliged by
public opinion to abandon the restriction a few years later. One
monument of the system has survived, unique and unscathed, to
illustrate by its treasures, paintings and buildings, the idyll of
a Byzantine retreat. This is Mount Athos, embowered amid flowers
and trees, in the silvery blue of the northern Aegean. Here, from
the eremite fortified among the naked crags, with only the eagles
and the sea his allies, through the clusters of hermit dwellings on
their ledges, to the great embattled monasteries at the shore, all
the stages of monastic development persist. Over the wooded ravines
and stony ridges a strange essence floats. Is this the world we
know? Or is it still the Byzantine world, midway between heaven and
earth, thick with the print of unfamiliar souls?</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The second institution upon which the religious life of the
Empire hinged, and of which monasticism was but the popular
adjunct, was naturally the Orthodox Church. Its structure derived
from the earliest missionary years of Christianity. And the
interest of its history has been more than academic. During four
centuries of Turkish rule, the political and national identity of
the Greeks was merged in their ecclesiastical organization. The
tale of each reached, not conclusion, but the end of a decisive
chapter, in the year 1923.</p>

<p>During the first three hundred years of its existence,
Christianity was essentially an urban religion. Only in the
Hellenized towns of the Roman Empire was there found the
imaginative intelligence capable of its reception. Its original
organization corresponded, therefore, with the political and
commercial centers of gravity of the time. Thus, at the Council of
Nicaea, in the year 32.5, the Patriarchates were three: Rome,
Alexandria, and Antioch. The city of Constantine was not yet in
being; and the old Byzantium was situate in the diocese of
Heraclea. But at the second Ecumenical Council in 381, it was
proclaimed that "the bishop of Constantinople is to have the
prerogative of honor after that of Rome, because she is new Rome."
Despite the unwisdom of entering upon the most disputed issue in
Christian history, it may be noted that, at the Council of
Chalcedon, seventy years later, the term "equal
prerogatives&mdash;[<i>Greek characters</i>]" was expressly used to
define the ecclesiastical relationship between new and old Rome.
The Church of St. Peter was to remain the first among equals; any
conception of authority, if, indeed, such was threatened, was
repudiated. And when, in 588, John the Faster, Patriarch of
Constantinople, assumed the title of Ecumenical or Universal
Archbishop, he evoked a protest from Pope Gregory the Great against
the primacy of any one bishop, which contains the strongest
condemnation ever penned of the later policy of Gregory's
Church.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a parallel rivalry was arising in the East with
Alexandria. In the case of Egypt, where monasticism was born,
Christianity had transformed a province of the Empire into a
fanatic theocracy, headed by its Patriarch. After half a century's
friction following the promotion of "New Rome" to equal dignity,
matters came to a head in the deposition of Nestorius, Patriarch on
the Bosporus, on an imputation of heresy engineered at the third
Ecumenical Council in 431 by Cyril of Alexandria. But
Constantinople returned to the charge. If Nestorius might not
separate the natures of Christ, neither should Egyptian mysticism
unite them. The monk Eutyches, champion of the latter doctrine, was
attacked; and though, in 449, Flavian, Patriarch of Constantinople,
was deposed and so injured in the packed Synod of Ephesus that he
died, the Alexandrines were finally beaten with the support of Rome
at the Council of Chalcedon, two years later. The divergence was
permanent; the native followers of the Egyptian Church, having lost
their bid for the supremacy of Christendom, now decided to be
independent of it; and the religious policy of Constantinople was
left suspended between political interests in Italy and the
southern Levant.[*] Toleration for the Monophysites, advocates of
the single nature, meant schism with Rome. The embarrassment of the
situation was only resolved in the seventh century, when Antioch,
Alexandria and Jerusalem&mdash;the latter city having been created
a Patriarchate in deference to its associations&mdash;were engulfed
by Islam. Henceforth, the see of Constantinople occupied undisputed
preponderance in the East, as Rome in the West. Nevertheless, in
memory of his city's diocesan parentage, the Ecumenical Patriarch
continues, down to the present day, to be handed the Patriarchal
staff at his enthronement by the Metropolitan of Heraclea or his
representative.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Chapter 5, pages 89-90.]</blockquote>

<p>Whatever the pretensions launched from time to time by
individual Patriarchs and Emperors, the Greek Orthodox Church has
remained, throughout its history, faithful to this principle of
<i>primus inter pares</i>, which was the key note of ecclesiastical
organization under the Councils. It was fundamentally the negation
of this principle on the part of the Italians, and their assumption
of "authority;" which provoked the ultimate schism with Rome in
1054, and rendered futile all subsequent attempts to heal it. From
that date, the position of the Patriarch of Constantinople in
relation to the autocephalous churches of Antioch, Alexandria,
Jerusalem, Cyprus, Mount Sinai, Athens, and those which the varying
fortunes and divisions of Slav nationality have called into being,
may be compared with that of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the
British Empire. The co-equal Churches are permitted independent
growth, but are bound in unity by communion with the Ecumenical
Patriarch. The executive of the whole is the Ecumenical Council,
which has not assembled, and even then did so with incomplete
representation, since the desperate attempt to save the Empire by a
union of the Churches at Florence in 1439.</p>

<p>The same principles of local independence and adaptation to
political necessity have governed the internal organization of the
Greek Church. Then as now, next under the Patriarch were the
Metropolitans. These, of whom a certain proportion bore the title
of Archbishop, were resident in the chief towns of the themes, and
were superior to the Bishops of the lesser towns. Each Metropolitan
or Archbishop could convoke synods of the Bishops under him. Under
the latter, again, were the parish priests. The tradition of
literary and theological scholarship among the higher clergy was
never interrupted. And from the sixth century, these had been
usually, though not always, recruited from the monasteries. No
priest might marry after ordination. Those who had already done so
could not aspire to the rank of bishop or above.</p>

<p>Thus constituted in the spirit of a religious commonwealth,
rather than a religious absolutism, the Orthodox Church, more
especially in its Byzantine phase, has suffered the accusation of
Erastianism, of subservience to the political rather than the
spiritual interests of its people. It is true that the initiative
of summoning an Ecumenical Council lay with the Emperor; and that
the election of the Patriarch was often a matter of his personal
choice. But that the Church, and the chosen Patriarch, were mere
creatures of his bidding, in no way followed. Byzantine history
teems with illustrations of the readiness with which monks and
prelates were prepared to stake life and position in support of
their principles: how Theodore of Studium upheld the primacy of
Rome against the iconoclast Emperor Constantine v; how the
Patriarch Nicolas Mysticus forbade the Emperor Leo VI the Sage
enter St. Sophia on Christmas day, 906, following his fourth
marriage; how the Patriarch Polyeuctes excommunicated the Emperor
Nicephorus II Phocas on similar grounds; how the Emperor Alexius I
Comnenus, with his mother Anna Dalassena[*] and his whole family,
fasted and slept on the ground for forty days in expiation of their
soldiers' pillage of church plate; how the Emperor Michael VIII
Palaeologus, after years of excommunication, publicly abased
himself at the feet of a new Patriarch, in penance for the blinding
and imprisonment of his youthful ward, John IV Lascaris;
innumerable instances confirm the independence of principle to
which the Church, assured of popular support, held fast. If there
were no great contests such as set the Popes and Hohenstaufens by
the ears or rent the England of the Stuarts, let it be remembered
that the Byzantine state was in itself almost as much a religious
as a political institution. When the Emperor John II Comnenus
returned from a victorious campaign, it was the Virgin's icon that
rode chariot borne through the streets of Constantinople; the
monarch, triumphant, walked behind, carrying a cross. Thus also, in
pontifical procession on a broiling August day, entered the same
Michael VIII Palaeologus after the delivery of the city from
fifty-seven years of Latin domination. The case was, indeed, as
Rambaud has written: <i>"Entre l'&Eacute;glise et l'&Eacute;tat, il
n'y a pas lutte, mais harmonie, presque confusion. Il n'y a pas de
honte pour le patriarche &acirc; &ecirc;tre nomm&eacute; par
l'Empereur, ni pour l'&Eacute;glise &acirc; &ecirc;tre
subordinn&eacute;e &acirc; l'&Eacute;tat, car l'&Eacute;tat est
&acirc; peine la&iuml;que."</i> Half the enigma of Byzantine
history is solved in the words: <i>&acirc; peine
la&iuml;que</i>.</p>

<blockquote>[* A masterful woman, who introduced a fixed breakfast
into the Palace ritual.]</blockquote>

<p>The social significance of religion to the Byzantines has been
described. The channels through which they pursued their quest, the
contemplative life and the Church, survive. But the gratitude of
posterity is not confined to the Levant and the Slays. It was Greek
intellect that shaped first the appeal, and then the formula, of
Christianity for the world at large. Finally, at the back of the
iconoclast movement, which assaulted the Orthodox Church in the
eighth century, lay a degree of spiritual aspiration, which
provides a key to the understanding not only of all future
Protestantism, but of the Byzantine cultural ideal and of that of
the twentieth century with it.</p>

<p>During Christ's life and the apostolic era, Greek was already
the <i>lingua franca</i> of the Mediterranean, the tongue of
commerce and the vehicle of ideas. And it was the later
Greek-writing authors of the New Testament who first set themselves
to the task of harmonizing rational philosophy with the Christian
ethic and the Jewish God. Not until the third century did a
religious work appear in any language but Greek; and that only for
the benefit of the patently uneducated. During its first six
centuries of dogmatic systematization, Christianity enjoyed the
service of the subtlest and most precise language that humanity has
evolved. And it was especially the solution of the Christological
controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries, which Byzantine
pride revered, and which gave the Orthodox Church its peculiar
stamp, not as a creator of doctrine but rather as a champion of
definition.</p>

<p>The necessity before the early Church, campaigning against every
variety of prejudice and inherited superstition, was to evolve a
compromise in definition so comprehensive as to embrace the
salutary elements in all previous ethical and theological
speculation, yet so rigid so to allow no loophole through which the
essential balance of the Trinity might become upset. Scarcely had
Constantine, with the eye of Roman practicality, adopted
Christianity for the unification of his world, when a vast cleft
was threatened by Arius's abstraction of Christ from his rightful
place in the Godhead, to that of a created being, a demigod pendant
between heaven and earth. The Emperor, alarmed at the repercussions
of what were to him, and, indeed, without prolonged psychological
concentration on the temperament of the period, are to us also,
"these small and insignificant matters," convened the first
Ecumenical Council at Nicaea in 325. He presided at it, paid its
expenses, and fathered the promulgation of the Nicene Creed. Thus
the prime article of Orthodox Christian belief, like the Empire it
was to sustain, emerged the product of Roman sense and Greek
intelligence. With the statement, negative in its width, that
Christ possessed perfect divinity and perfect humanity, the central
factor in the Christian Trinity was fixed.</p>

<p>But the problem remained as to the relation of these two
natures. And though the preponderance of one or the other must
ultimately rest with individual preference, the ecclesiastical
rivalries of the fifth century sharpened the scent of heresy. In
Asia Minor and Syria, the tendency of religious speculation, voiced
by Theodore of Mopsuestia, was to emphasize the historic value of
Christ's life on earth as divorced from his divinity; and while
admitting the full perfection of that divinity, to deny that it was
ever transmitted through the womb, that, in other words, God was
born of woman. In Alexandrine Africa, on the other hand, the divine
attributes were threatened with overemphasis at the expense of the
human. Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, having been trained
at Antioch, was a partisan of the former view; and on championing
the thesis that Christ's two natures were contained, despite the
seeming unity of one body, in two personalities, was deposed and
exiled in 42,8. The Alexandrines, however, who had secured this
triumph, had united in their zeal, not only the personalities, but
the natures. The direction of the carpenter's plane by Christ the
man was held to be identical in emanation with that of universal
destiny by Christ the God. This doctrine in its turn was condemned
at the Council of Chalcedon in 451.</p>

<p>These two decisions separated large bodies of Christians from
communion with the central Church. That of Chalcedon led to the
formation of the Monophysite branch, of which the Churches of the
Egyptian Copts, the Syrian Jacobites of Antioch, and the
Abyssinians still survive. While all Eurasia tells no more romantic
tale than that of the Nestorian Church, which retained its
allegiance to the deposed Patriarch of 42.8 and the doctrines of
Theodore of Mopsuestia that he had defended. How this community
threatened the supremacy of the Magi in Persia, entered into
personal relations with Mohammed, and transmitted to the Arabs
those threads of Hellenic learning which eventually, preceding the
Renaissance, found their way to Spain and Western Europe; how its
missionary and civilizing effort embraced Arabia, India, Ceylon,
Tartary, Afghanistan, Siberia, and Eastern China, and may have
contributed the original inspiration of Tibetan Lamaism; how a
Chinee, born in Peking, came to administer Holy Communion to King
Edward I of England in Gascony; how the Roman Synod of Diamper
tortured and burnt the Indian remnant of this once vast brotherhood
in 1560; and how the Inquisition of Goa was abolished by order of
the Prince Regent of Portugal from Rio de Janeiro in 1812; these
histories are told elsewhere.[*] At the latter vicissitudes of the
Nestorians, at their fight in the Great War, and at their reward,
those who recall the inconvenience of small allies during Peace can
feel no surprise.</p>

<blockquote>[* See H. C. Luke, <i>Mosul</i>, and Sir E. A. Wallis
Budge, <i>The Monks of Kublai Khan</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>In great schisms, but yet greater measure of consolidation,
ended these earlier controversies. Viewed in the light of their
enormous contemporary significance, they are isolated from the
modern understanding. But with iconoclasm it is different. The root
of that movement is intimately related to the mental and artistic
ferment of the present day.</p>

<p>The problem that lay at the bottom of iconoclasm, this campaign
for the destruction of representational art, of all portrayal in
terms of physical actuality, was precisely that which is troubling
the modernists of our time, and leading them to those extravagances
which the intelligentsia has been educated to indulge and the
colonel to regard as pathological. That the function of art is to
translate the philosophic emotions evoked in the artist by the
inner significance of material objects into visible and ultimately
intelligible form, is an axiom that has not always been recognized.
It was unknown to Antiquity; and it was wholly forgotten in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But in the early Christian and
early Mohammedan eras, as in the twentieth century, its acceptance
was undisputed. A distinction between the two epochs, the medieval
and the present, may be drawn, which in itself explains this
affinity. All "inner significance"&mdash;that which it is the
function of art to interpret&mdash;must exist for the individual in
terms of his own individual reactions, which the language commonly
calls emotions. And the distinction lies in the fact that from the
fourth century to the Renaissance, the whole body of human emotions
was invested, unlike those of today, with the garment of religion.
The problem, which is now exercising modern artists from the
standpoint of psychological Realities, of harnessing art more
entirely to the expression of emotional reactions, was then
attached to the single quest of a personal Reality formulated by
Christianity. But in both cases the essentials of the problem were
the same: How far is representational art capable of fulfilling
art's function: that is, the expression of an abstract worth? From
the purely aesthetic point of view (that of today), the answer is
that the human eye and the human sensibilities are so accustomed to
traffic in familiar objects that they will not react to expressed
emotion, unless that emotion is expressed in terms of those
objects. But from the religious point of view, when the emotions
are focused in a Godhead of omnipotent sanctity, of what account
are the human sensibilities and their reactions, compared with the
insult offered the holy elements by portrayal? For to clothe
Reality in terms of the transient, in terms of terrestrial object,
is to degrade it. Modern artists, while unable to discard the
language of familiar object, seek to subordinate its importance
wholly to that which it is used to express; the purely
representational tends to grow less and less. They, in fact, seek
the mean which the Byzantines, culminating in El Greco, came nearer
to finding than any people before or since. That the Byzantines so
far succeeded, was due to the influence of iconoclasm. Thus the
impulse behind all campaigns against idolatry, from the second
commandment to the vandalism of Cromwell's Puritans, is one and the
same as that which prompts John, Epstein and the fry that come
after, to subordinate the physical exactitudes of their sitters to
the reactions which the Tatter's whole beings, bodily and other,
convey, through the senses, to the artist's intelligence. A painter
and a sculptor of relative importance are only one example. But the
example serves.</p>

<p>Now this instinct against purely representational art came from
the East. <i>"Thou shall not make to thy self any graven image, nor
the likeness of anything that is in heaven above or in the earth
beneath, or in the water under the earth."</i> Thus the Jews
protected their Reality, while the Greeks reproduced the transient.
Eventually there evolved the new religion; and in the case of
Christianity, it was mainly through the medium of representational
art, through pictured incidents in its founder's life, together
with lurid illustrations of celestial reward and punishment, that
the Levantine and European masses received their early lessons in
religion. In the beginning it was the same with Mohammedanism:
illuminated manuscripts and mosaics in the mosques depicted scenes
from the Prophet's life. But the seventh century witnessed a
tightening of the iconoclast prohibition. In Persia, where a
representational art had been, from time immemorial, a national
heritage, it was destined to failure. Elsewhere, however, where
Islam flourished, there, henceforth, representational art was
taboo. The soul of the artist must find play within the limits of
geometric convolution. And though today, though not perhaps
forever, it is our opinion that the emotions are best expressed in
unfamiliar transformations of familiar objects, there is something
that commands admiration in this ideal of abstract expression
through pure design.</p>

<p>Meanwhile spasmodic movements in Christianity had foreshadowed
the coming struggle. As early as the fourth century, prominent
clerics were inveighing against representations of Christ; and in
599, a definite outbreak of iconoclasm at Marseilles was stifled by
Pope Gregory the Great. Furthermore, in southern Armenia, an
advanced form of Protestantism was already exemplified in the
practice of the Paulicians, a Christian sect which rejected the
cult of Virgin and saints, candles, crosses, incense, purgatory,
infant baptism, and more than one grade of ministry. The Emperor
Leo III the Isaurian, who ascended the throne of Constantinople in
716, was of Armenian origin. In 726, the first edict against the
holy pictures revered in every Orthodox church was promulgated. The
whole of European art, both the sculpture of the past and the
painting of the future, was threatened. For, in those days, in fact
if not in theory, the separation of the secular from the religious
was impossible.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from the mystical and probably subconscious
ideal which impelled the assault on representation, there existed
definite abuses in the religious life of the Byzantine community,
which the iconoclasts wished to reform. In process of time, the
icons, or sacred pictures had become objects of actual veneration;
although, as St. John Damascene pointed out, this was not
surprising in view of the miracles they performed. Further, the
monks, their champions, while increasing in numbers and wealth,
were ceasing to be distinguished for either learning or piety. The
story of the movement divides into two periods, 726 to 787, and 815
to 842, in the interval between which the pictures were restored by
the Empress Irene. Astonishing results attended the first edict:
there were serious riots in Constantinople, an abortive rebellion
in Greece, and a successful one in southern Italy. With the
accession of Constantine V Copronymus in 740, a Cromwell in
character and ability, relics, the cult of the Virgin, and the
intercession of the saints were all attacked; monks were
persecuted; works of art destroyed. But in 780, Irene, the Athenian
widow of the Emperor Leo IV, assumed power; and in order to attract
popular favor prior to the dethronement of her son, for whom she
stood regent, had the pictures restored by the Ecumenical Council
of Nicaea in 787. Simultaneously, the monks, inspired by Theodore
of Studium, were in process of self-reform. It was part of the
Studite program to render the Orthodox Church independent of the
Byzantine state by a fuller recognition of the authority of the
Pope. But while the iconoclast sovereigns, strong in the support of
an Asiatically recruited army, had added much to the glory of the
Empire, their opponents, the iconodules, were weak and unsuccessful
in war. In 813, the threat of Bulgarian invasion gave rise to a
military revolution, which placed on the throne Leo y, another
Armenian. The decision of the Council of Nicaea was revoked, and
the persecution of the monks resumed. Leo's successor but one, the
Emperor Theophilus, himself an artist, tried to divert their
talents into secular channels. But the Studite party was too
strong, and the love of the icons too deeply engrained in the
average Hellene, for the spiritual purism of the East to be
maintained in perpetuity. Upon the accession to power in 842 of
another Empress-Regent, the pictures were finally reinstated.</p>

<p>What, in sum, were the positive results of the controversy?
European painting, already cradling in Constantinople, was saved.
And from now onwards, Byzantine art assumed that peculiar austerity
and economy which has rendered it one of the supreme achievements
in emotional expression. The Orthodox Church was affected in a
similar manner: its kinship with Protestantism past and future was
one not of doctrine, but of spiritual feeling. What part this
feeling, communicated through actual relationship with the East,
may have contributed to the emancipation from Rome of the Lollards
and Hussites, and ultimately to the whole Reformation, it is as
difficult to surmise as that of the Cathars and Bogomiles. But it
may be recalled that among Wyclif's twenty-four Conclusions
condemned by the Synod of Blackfriars in 1382, the ninth advocated
the reconstitution of the Church "after the manner of the Greeks";
and that the first action of the Hussites (with whose doctrines
Luther afterwards identified himself), following their
excommunication at the Council of Florence in 1450, was to send a
deputation to Constantinople, seeking admission for them to the
Orthodox Church. It is here, in the light of historic consequence,
that the salient outcome of iconoclasm is to be found. The monks
had won the icons; but they had lost their bid for papal authority.
Henceforth, there was a definite divergence between Constantinople
and Rome. With this emergence and fruition of a spiritual austerity
beyond the comprehension of Latin materialism, the history of
Christianity develops from the formative to the contrasting.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>It may be supposed that when the historians of a thousand years
hence come to analyze the European modes of thought and living
which now dominate the world, a factor in their calculations will
be the admittedly beneficial influence of Christianity in the
building of European civilization. They will disentangle the
various communions of that religion; they will mark the Reformation
as its turning point; and they will then, judgment matured by
thirty generations' detachment, note the upshot of new and
extraordinary phenomena in that branch of it which retained its
allegiance to the ancient Pope in Rome. The success with which,
from the seventeenth century on, the counter-reformed Latin Church
pursued its formula for the cure of souls; the devotion of its
servants; and even the measure of their spiritual attainments;
these they will applaud. But the manner in which the great
multitude of its adherents was henceforth effectually debarred from
communion with the Holy Spirit, the paramount, and for the future,
only permanent element in the Christian Trinity; together with the
hourly denial practiced, from the Vatican to the remotest
missionary, of the Christian ethic, can but evoke surprise. We as
contemporaries can give the Roman Church its due: to the troubled
and the wavering it brings a peace that is nowhere else to be
found. But history loses sight of detail in perception of an
institution's relative contribution to the furtherance of the human
quest. Subsequent speculation may debate as to whether it was the
Italian core or the Spanish infiltration that inaugurated these
traditions. But the verdict of a posterity unbiased, as we are, by
the survival of partisan Christian sects, can be foretold. In that
view, post-Reformation Catholicism must appear a bastard aberration
from the main body of Christendom; a product of obsolete
Mediterranean materialism which henceforth played no part with
Christianity in man's discovery of Reality; which desecrated his
divine soul with self-constructed specifics of salvation; which
extinguished all intellectual and material progress wherever its
influence was strongest; and finally, which outraged, separately
and in the aggregate, every canon of behavior which enables a human
being to dwell in amity with his neighbor.</p>

<p>To this postulated criticism, the Greek Orthodox Church offers
commentary. The latter history of its Byzantine phase reveals, in
its relationship with Rome, the beginnings of those tendencies on
the part of the latter which, even in the twentieth century,
continue to render odious the Papal Curia and all its political
works. It provides also a contrast valuable for the understanding
of both institutions, and one obscured by no serious doctrinal
dispute. This contrast is temperamental. And in temperament lies
the key to the history. For in that must be sought the fundamental
explanation of the great schism, for which, in the first instance,
the Greeks were more responsible than the Romans.</p>

<p>The psychological difference between the two Churches lies at
bottom in their temporal outlook. To the Greek, who by nature lives
entirely in the present, the conception of future resurrection and
future afterlife is obscure. To the Roman it is clear as his own
hand. The result is that while, for the latter, the whole impulse
of religion is in essence eschatological, woven with the idea of
post-human progression, for the Greek it is derived from the desire
to seek transfiguration, not in the future, but the present. The
Roman, in this life, is concentrated on the problems of sin and
grace: his eyes are fixed on the below; the other world, though
parent of his activity, is yet far off. For the Greek it is here.
He lives in two worlds at once, and his eyes are on the upper of
them; the Eucharist is not so much a means of grace as a "medicine
of immortality&mdash;[<i>Greek characters</i>]." While, in Roman
opinion, God became man that man's sins might be forgiven with a
view to <i>future</i> immortality, in Greek it was that his human
nature might be deified, not in some future state, but <i>now</i>.
Thus, for the Roman, the prime function of religion is an ethical
one, the regulation of conduct. For the Greek it is the piercing of
the sensory veil, the junction of the divine spark in man with its
ex-terrestrial affinity, God.</p>

<p>These contrasting interpretations of religion, material, and
pneumatic, are exhibited in different methods of Church
organization. To the Roman, temperamentally bereft of spiritual
guidance, the juridical authority of the Church forms the basis of
his religious practice. Such an idea, to the Greek, is actively
repellent. Hence the Orthodox Church is sympathetic, within the
limits of Orthodoxy, to a measure of individual interpretation
which Catholicism cannot tolerate. The number of national
autocephalous Churches, secure with vernacular Liturgy and Bible,
which it contains, enable it to avoid the ceaseless political
friction that Rome's jurisdiction of souls has always provoked. And
even in the case of other Churches such as our own, it has always
recognized definite aspects of Christian truth, to which, as such,
consideration is due.</p>

<p>It was these opposed points of view, which iconoclasm
accentuated, that validated the schism between the Orthodox and
Catholic Churches. But the blame for the embitterment which
followed must rest with the evolution at the Roman center of a
completely centralized authority, and the consequently amoral
attitude towards all non-coreligionists in which this resulted.</p>

<p>The first serious divergences appeared during the iconoclast
period. The Papacy, embarrassed almost to the point of extinction
by the incursions of the Lombards and the absence of help from
Constantinople, was obliged to seek the protection of Pepin, King
of the Franks. The name of the Eastern Emperor was henceforth
omitted in official documents. And another of the West was
deliberately conjured into tutelary being by the coronation,
somewhat to his embarrassment, of Charlemagne, in Boo. Definite
estrangement resulted; and in 843, when the icons were finally
restored by the Empress Theodora, the estates and jurisdiction of
the Pope in Southern Italy were not. Attempts meanwhile were being
made to win the newly converted Kingdom of Bulgaria to the Latin
usage. Fruitless as they proved&mdash;for the Pope could not grant
the ecclesiastical independence tolerated by the
Patriarch&mdash;they fanned the flame of Byzantine resentment.
Finally, the forcible substitution of Photius for the Patriarch
Ignatius on account of the latter's censure of the Caesar Bardas's
morals; the interference of the Pope on behalf of Hgnatius; and the
formation by Photius of a doctrinal basis of dispute; accomplished
the first schism of 858. Normal relations were renewed forty years
later under the Macedonian Emperors. And as the Patriarchate now
reflected the political refulgence of the Empire, so the light of
the Papacy waned in proportion. But the era of the Cluny reforms
was at hand; a present-laden embassy to Rome demanding complete
ecclesiastical autonomy was foiled, contrary to probability, by a
sudden pan Western agitation; and in 1049, Leo IX, child of the new
ideals, was elected Pope. Opposite him, in Constantinople, the
Patriarch Michael Cerularius was a man of equal vigor, shorn of
affectation by suffering in prison, and educated in the liberal
tradition of the bureaucracy, to which he had been originally
destined.</p>

<p>The schism which followed was deliberately manipulated by the
Patriarch as the logical means of ending a perpetual friction,[*]
and in championship of that national exclusiveness with which the
Church had become identified under Photius. The bone of papal
jurisdiction in South Italy was repicked; the doctrinal weapon that
the Latins, by adding <i>filioque</i> to the creed, represented the
Holy Ghost as proceeding not only from God, but also from Christ as
well, instead of through him, was refurbished from the armory of
Photius; and the papal Legates, testifying to the rectitude of
Emperor and people as opposed to Patriarch, deposited the curse
against schismatics with which they had come provided, on the high
altar of St. Sophia. <i>"Let them be Anathema, Maranatha, with
Simoniacs, Valerians, Arians, Donatists, Nicholaitans, Severians,
Pneumatomachi, Manichees and Nazarenes and all heretics; yea with
the devil and his angels. Amen. Amen. Amen."</i> The breach was
ratified by the enormous popularity of the Patriarch with the
people. It was opposed to the good judgment of the Emperor
Constantine IX Monomach. But though the majority of his successors,
and many enlightened people on either side, continued through
centuries to desire a reunion, the thrust had struck too deep. The
religious honor of the Byzantines was insulted in perpetuity. While
the Latins, after the manner of their Church, were now trained in a
rancorous detestation of the Eastern excommunicants.</p>

<blockquote>[* Between the accession of Constantine in 3 3 o and
the Photian schism of 858, the severance of official relations had
already extended over 203 years.]</blockquote>

<p>For four centuries longer, the history of the dispute oscillates
between political and spiritual considerations. There followed,
immediately, the crusades. Pope Paschal II promised support to
Bohemond of Antioch in a project to destroy the schismatic Empire;
Roger II of Sicily received similar encouragement. In retaliation,
it was an avowed ambition of the Comneni to be crowned in St.
Peter's. At length began the preparations for the fourth crusade.
Pope Innocent III,&mdash;famous in English history for his summary
excommunication of King John,&mdash;in whose opinion the papal
right of pan-European domination admitted of no distinction between
the spiritual and the temporal, forbade in plain terms the proposed
attack on Constantinople. Nor did he scruple to vent his feelings
after the <i>event</i>. "Ye have drawn not your sword against
Saracens, but Christians..." he wrote to the marauding host, "Ye
have preferred earthly to heavenly riches...ye have spared naught
that is sacred, neither age nor sex; ye have given yourselves to
prostitution, adultery and debauchery in face of all the world...ye
have glutted your guilty passions not only on married women and
widows but on women and virgins dedicated to the Savior; ye have
pillaged the churches...ye have stolen the crosses, images and
relics in such fashion that the Greek Church, though borne down by
persecution, refuses obedience to the apostolical see, because it
sees in the Latins only treason and the works of darkness, and
loathes them like dogs." Yet the man who penned these words of
righteous indignation, who disavowed the Venetian Patriarch,
Morosini, himself as pretentious as a Photius, and who allowed the
Greeks their own rites, was able, in the same breath, to refer to
the Latin Conquest, as that "miracle wrought by God to the glory of
his name, the honor and benefit of the Roman see, and the advantage
of Christendom." A forced union of the Churches was proclaimed at
the Lateran Council of 1215. But the intemperance of the papal
Legate in the Levant obliged even the Latin Emperor to intervene.
And by 1245, of the thirty bishoprics of the Latin Patriarchate,
only three suffragans remained. The Vatican found it more
profitable to negotiate with the displaced Greek court of Nicaea
than to support the phantom wreck of the miracle wrought by God.
And in 1274, thirteen years after the recapture of Constantinople
by the Greeks, common fear of the Italian Angevins led Pope and
Emperor to proclaim yet another "union." Like its fellows, it was
abortive. The hatred of the Greeks, sincere before, was now
indelible.</p>

<p>But the Empire was entering on its last struggle. And help from
the West was conditional on religious agreement. In vain the
Emperor John y Palaeologus abjured his faith from the steps of St.
Peter's. In vain his successor Manuel toured the West, dazzled
Paris with his garb, and spent Christmas at Eltham in search of
aid. But at length, during the respite from Turkish attacks
following Bajazet's defeat by Tamerlane in 1402, harmony seemed in
sight. A General Council of the Roman Church was assembled at
Basle, whose first act was to quarrel with Pope Eugenius. Envoys
from both Pope and Council arrived simultaneously in
Constantinople, provoking a third from Sultan Murad, suggesting
that, under the circumstances, his friendship might perhaps be of
greater worth than that of Western Christendom. Eventually, in
1437, the Emperor and his delegation, their expenses paid by
Eugenius, embarked; admired the treasures of Venice pillaged from
their own capital; and arrived at Ferrara, where an outbreak of
plague necessitated the Council's transference to Florence. A
common basis of agreement was reached; and the union was ratified
in the Duomo, the Te Deum being sung in Greek. The celebration was
repeated, amid general execration, in Constantinople and Moscow,
from which latter city the Russian Cardinal Isidore barely escaped
with his life; while the Patriarchs of Syria and Egypt were one in
their denunciation of the unholy concord. Meanwhile, the Pope
dispatched such assistance as he might. But his sincerity, and that
of the Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, were unavailing. The oft
quoted and reviled remark attributed to the High Admiral Notaras,
that he would rather see "the turban of the Turk in the capital
than the tiara of the Latin;" represented a genuine and justifiable
point of view on the part of the Greek public. For three centuries
the Latins, in the guise of soldiers of the Western Cross, had
harried their Empire, had robbed it of prosperity, had overthrown
its machinery, and desecrated its most cherished shrines and
institutions. The first act of the Patriarchate, reconstituted by
Mohammed II after his capture of the city in 1453, was to repeal
the act of union. Since then, essays in religious fraternity have
moved in other directions.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-9"></a>Chapter 9. Culture</h3>

<p>A peculiar indecision attaches to the words "art" and
"artistic." Whereas the latter is relevant to numerous spheres of
cultural activity, the former is employed mainly to differentiate
one of them from the rest. "Art" in common parlance, implies the
creation of form, in two dimensions or three, as opposed to other
manifestations of "artistic" expression, such as music or writing.
And it was in art thus defined, in representation and design, in
leviathans of architecture and microcosms of craftsmanship, that
the Byzantine genius found its medium, and thereby bequeathed
posterity a legacy both in concrete monument and formative affect.
In relation to posterity, Byzantine art has suffered twofold
misfortune: only in the present century has a revived affinity,
born of escape from the trammels of classicism, trained the
critical eye once more to its appreciation; and even in this age of
prodigious communication, its memorials remain for the most part
singularly inaccessible, either fortified against wheeled traffic
by the mountainous coasts of the East Mediterranean, or, in such
localities as Constantinople and Kiev, necessitating, in their
inspection, an expenditure of time and money that the ordinary
traveler cannot afford. Italy, profuse in tourist facilities,
provides an exception, but one which, by itself, can convey only a
one-sided impression of the art in question. And a journey to Spain
will reveal that which nothing else can, the painting of the last
Byzantine, El Greco. Otherwise, the West of Europe is sparsely
furnished with material examples of medieval Greek culture.
Nonetheless, their significance, once understood, goes deep. Dutch
tavern and Umbrian hummock fade like the memory of a loved but
departed nurse. The veils of prettiness, the opacity of coherence,
are pierced.</p>

<p>Yet still the novice, in orbit of the light, gropes. Over a
period of twelve centuries, there must be landmarks of achievement
and transformations of manner to be grasped. Manuals of Byzantine
art are scarce, expensive, and usually incomplete. An historical
summarization of that art's three phases in development,
illustrated by patently outstanding monuments and facts, may
therefore be excused.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The first period, dating from the foundation of Constantinople
in 330, reached its golden age in the reign of Justinian. The
imported Oriental art of mosaic&mdash;by which is meant the inlay
of colored glass cubes&mdash;was now brought to a technical
perfection which the compositions on which it was employed did not
justify. At Ravenna, however, in the mausoleum of the Empress Galla
Placidia, dating from the middle of the fifth century, the
background of vaulted sapphire to the unconvincing
Romano-Hellenistic figures renders this earliest of Byzantine
monuments unique in its beauty. The mosaics of this first phase,
though often, as in the case of the portraits of Justinian and
Theodora in St. Vitale at Ravenna, historically interesting, lack
the emotional significance of later Byzantine art; this, in its
ultimate form, was the outcome of forces not yet discernible on the
intellectual horizon. At present the compositions tended to derive
either from a directly Roman source, as exemplified in the
fantasies of curtained architecture which decorate the dome of St.
George at Salonica; or were else, as in the case of the patterned
birds to be seen in the subsidiary vaults of the same church, of
purely Eastern inspiration. The apse of St. Apollinare-in-Classe at
Ravenna reveals an attempted impregnation of Hellenistic form with
the anti-naturalistic grouping of the East. But the result suffers
from a lack of coordination in its methods, and a too obvious
symbolism. Similarly, the colors of the time do not exhibit those
principles of interrelationship which were to govern the painting
and mosaic of the future and were to give, in the end, Byzantine
genius its most enduring means of expression. On the other hand,
contemporary ivories and sarcophagi already display that complete
mastery and economy of design which remained essentially constant
through twelve centuries.</p>

<p>The main problem which the period resolved was that of
ecclesiastical architectural form. The pure basilica, legacy of
classical temples, with its square atrium or narthex, rounded apse,
and long naves flanked by twin or quadruple rows of pillars, made a
stand for continuity. It survives, outside Italy, in the ruined
churches of St. Demetrius and St. Paraskevi at Salonica, and in the
Syrian deserts. Simultaneously, in both Syria and Anatolia, the
octagon and rotunda types of old funerary monument were undergoing
surprising development, outcome of the search for a more religious
and more intellectual plan than that offered by the ponderously
apprehensible classical model. By the accession of Justinian, round
churches such as St. Constanza at Rome and St. George at Salonica,
were familiar; octagons, of which St. Vitale at Ravenna and SS.
Sergius and Bacchus at Constantinople still remain, in process of
expansion; while that of the Holy Apostles at Salonica already
exhibited the familiar cruciform surmounted by five cupolas. But
with the arrival of the Anatolian brick pendentive, by means
ofwhich a dome could now be imposed on foursquare walls, themselves
poised on the four central piers, there came about a fusion of
basilica with octagon or rotunda, which eventually developed into
the familiar and infinitely far-reaching type of the Greek cross.
The destruction of the old churches of Constantinople in the Nika
Riot of 531 gave Justinian his chance. In the new St. Sophia that
he erected, a domed basilica, all the gathering individuality of
Byzantine building was crystallized. It simultaneously attained an
emotional pinnacle which the materials of architecture have yet to
surpass.</p>

<p>There followed, in the seventh century, an age of extreme
unrest; and in the eighth, and the ninth after it, the iconoclast
Emperors, under whom the true course of artistic development,
despite a fashion of magnificent secular decoration borrowed from
the court of the Caliphs at Baghdad, was brought to a
standstill.</p>

<p>The second period, therefore, opens with the anti-Puritan
reaction that set in during the regency of the Caesar Bardas in the
middle of the ninth century; the revived study of science and the
humanities that it engendered; and the accession in 867 of the
Emperor Basil I the Macedonian, who launched the Empire on a path
of material glory, from which it was only precipitated by the
eruption of the crusaders at the beginning of the thirteenth
century.</p>

<p>Byzantine art now emerged both spiritualized and humanized. Vast
wealth was pouring on the capital; and an extreme magnificence
characterized the buildings of the time. If, amid this splendor of
gold mosaic and precious marble, architecture tended to lose its
purity of conception&mdash;as in the no longer existing New Church
of Basil I, from which St. Mark's in Venice, begun in 1063, was
copied&mdash;in pictorial art, the fusion of emotional symbolism
with the representational was now successfully accomplished. At
least thus it was in the churches, where a definite iconography was
henceforth prescribed for the decoration of every vacant inch of
their interiors; of the secular art of the time, which flourished
within the precincts of the Great Palace, and is described in
contemporary chronicles, nothing has survived. This, moreover, was
the age of Byzantine culture's widest expansion. From the still
extant mosaics of St. Sophia at Kiev, executed by Greeks in the
eleventh century, to the gigantic, Gothically enthroned Christ of
Monreale, dating from the twelfth, the whole of southeastern Europe
is scattered with memorials to the Greek Empire's prosperity. The
masterpieces among them are in Greece: the monastery churches of
Daphni, near Athens, and of St. Luke, near Livadia, in Phocis. In
the latter, the ensemble of marble and mosaic survives complete,
unhidden and unrestored, to celebrate the gorgeous middle period of
the Empire and to show how the radiance of Constantinople was
carried into the lives even of poor harvesters and mountain
shepherds.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>At length came the crusades, and with the fourth of them, an end
to Byzantine magnificence. The churches of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries are small, sparsely marbled, and for the most
part painted where formerly would have been mosaic. But
simultaneously with the return of the court to Constantinople in
1261, a Renaissance in pictorial art took place, which flourished
right through the last century of struggle and was never, even two
centuries after the Turkish Conquest, degraded wholly to the merely
decorative peasant level of later Russia and the remaining
Balkans.</p>

<p>With the continued subtilization of represented form which had
been in process since the iconoclasts had implanted their ideals in
the Byzantine mind, the technique of representation was in danger
of becoming lost. Its rescue was due, as subsequently in Italy, to
a recrudescence of classical humanism. As early as the eleventh
century the reconstitution of the University of Constantinople by
the Emperor Constantine IX Monomach had seen a revival of the study
of Plato and the tentative elevation of Reason to a place in
Christian esteem. Thanks to the strength of ecclesiastical
tradition, the result was not, as in Italy, a reversion to Hellenic
naturalism and superficiality; but rather a testimony to the manner
in which representational facility, while still subordinate, may
assist the artist in his emotional aims. One of the earliest and,
with the exception of the paintings in the Pantanassa at Mistra,
certainly the most beautiful monument of this third and last period
in Byzantine art, is the present Kahri&eacute; mosque in
Constantinople. The mosaics of the interior, erected between 1310
and 1320, exhibit a gentle dignity and grace of composition
strongly reminiscent of the contemporary work of Giotto; in color
they wholly surpass him. But, as in Italy, it was painting, owing
to lack of money, that now took the field, developing, as the
disintegration of the Empire progressed, in two main centers: the
city of Mistra, capital of the isolated Greek despotat of the
Morea; and the monastic republic of Mount Athos. So far, at least,
surviving frescoes enable us to conjecture. Simultaneously, the
Greek technique was communicated to Serbia, and gradually, in
debased form, to the whole Balkan peninsula. Two schools,
traditionally known as the Cretan and Macedonian, may be
distinguished, employing as a rule separate iconographies, and
dating their earliest extant productions from the thirteenth
century. The latter, in coloration and light, approximated more
nearly, though independently, to the Giottesque school of fresco
painters; emotionally its aim was higher; technically its ability
less than theirs. The Cretan artists, on the other hand, maintained
the divergence between East and West Europe to the end; the
luminous interplay of their colors and their sense of form existing
by virtue of its own intrinsic light, admit of no analogies in more
familiar spheres of art. How, but for the Turkish Conquest,
European painting might have been rescued from the slough of
Italian naturalism during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
is apparent in the works of El Greco, foremost exponent of this
school and last and greatest flower of Byzantine genius. It is
instructive and painful to reflect that, in the popular trend of
art, "immortal Guido" was almost exactly his contemporary.</p>

<p>Thus from the middle of the fourth century to that of the
sixteenth, the aesthetic tradition germinated in Constantinople and
oscillating between extremes of mystic incapacity and inherited
Hellenic facility, was a creative force, of which the products
stand today as landmarks in the cultural history of the world. In
pure design and scenic composition; in the abstraction of sheer
aesthetic splendor from intrinsically splendid materials; and in
compromise between depicted object and depicted emotion, the rival
of the Byzantine artist is yet to be found.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>This compromise, the harnessing of familiar form to the
expression of its contained significance in the mind of the artist,
must continue so long as man thinks in the language of his eyes, to
be the goal of art. How iconoclasm in some measure perfected this
equilibrium in Byzantine painting and mosaic has been explained in
Chapter 8, pages 182-185. But Byzantine art, in all but the
representational, had emerged from the formative period of the
triple fusion before the advent of the Armenian purists. Its
existence, in embryo, was coincident with that of Christianity
itself. And the characteristics of the religion illustrate those of
the art. Christianity was born of cosmopolitanism, demanded
universal acceptance and admitted of complex intellectual
speculation. Similarly, Byzantine art was no product of a single
national or mental temperament, but was rather the outcome of a
great psychological wave, worldwide, transcending racial barriers,
and gathering intellectual differences to a unity. In its
intellectual aspect lay its distinction from Western medieval art,
which borrowed the forms of Eastern without the mental alertness,
due to perpetual contact with the ineradicable vestiges of
classical humanism, which inspired them. Again, the Christian
purpose is concrete, its path decided, and its pursuit of that
path, unswerving. The methods of Byzantine art are alike. The
expression of that Reality, which the religion seeks actually to
grasp, allows of no pleasing affectations of sentiment or grace.
All is economy, unerring recruitment to one aim, and vast assurance
in that aim; intelligible form is reduced to its lowest possible
terms (hence the danger of lapse to mere formula on the part of the
inept); there is no deviation to bribe the slovenliness of optical
perception. The purpose of both is to entrain man's spiritual
affinities toward their greater Counterpart, the religion through
the mind, the art through the eye. To the creating Byzantine, art
was the expression of his quest; to the beholding, the furtherance.
Christianity, product of the East, brought with it the Eastern
method of emotional symbolization. Nonetheless, beneath all the
abstractions of Byzantine art and the religious hypnotism that
beset it, the Hellenic sanity, instinct for balance, arrangement,
and purity of form, remained perennially alive.</p>

<p>Of the plethoric satisfaction, fulfillment of the eye's most
secret crevices of desire, which the essence and rendering of
Byzantine pattern afford; of the subtlety of contour, expressed in
undercutting and relief, which brought the two dimensions of stone
and ivory to its service; of its impeccable proportion and openness
of form, diminishing nothing of its symbolic mystery, yet combining
by the utmost elaboration of detail the extremes of textural
effect; verbal description can convey only the principles. But as
these principles percolated from pure design to the simplification
of represented form, man, beast, and landscape, the uneasy
symbolism of the earlier Christian art, vagrant palms, and
discomposed sheep, was eliminated. There developed, instead, a
definite cubism in drapery and in natural phenomena, such as trees
and rocks; a contrasting shiny darkness for the accentuation of
face and limb; and a treatment of celestial portent not in the
familiar physical terms of medieval domesticity, Renaissance
beatitude or baroque tornado, but geometrically, in compartments
whose very simplicity of outline is alone compatible with the pent
reservations of the artist's feeling. To this skeleton of
representational formalism, color gave the flesh, color employed
not merely as an adjunct to the modeling, but fired with an
independent life, so that its so-called light and shade derived not
from some fancied external source, but from an intrinsic virtue
born of its own interplay. And there emanated, from this
combination, an expression of mystical emotion to which the modern
mind is even yet scarcely capable of responding. For the Byzantines
the significance of this tradition became accentuated with
generations. We, on the other hand, must discard the very rudiments
of our upbringing for its comprehension. As Strzygowski has said,
with the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, "art ceased to touch
the life of the people. Even today we can hardly know what it can
really mean to a man."</p>

<p>If then there be added to this interplay of mystic formalism
with living color, stones, metals, stuffs, and mosaic, sufficient
in their raw hues and glitter to captivate the heart of a bartering
savage; it is not hard to conceive the superlative splendor,
speaking not of drained expenditure but effortless reserve, which
these materials, ranged in sophisticated harmony, wrought for
Byzantine art. In Constantinople, for the first and last time in
history, an austere and intellectual taste encountered unbridled
profusion of wealth, and did not succumb to its temptations. From
the flaunting encrustation of the further East, Byzantine splendor
differs as an aristocrat from a parvenu, as an inwardly poised
whole from an outwardly intent diversity of body and ornament.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Thus, according to design, magnificence, architectural
conception, or technique of craftsmanship, the surviving monuments
of Byzantine culture fall into many categories. The pictorial,
cradle of European painting, stands apart on its own plane of
historical evolution. But the others&mdash;and that also, were it
but visible through the yellow Turkish wash&mdash;are embodied in a
single building. This is St. Sophia. Though today the mosaics, many
of them post-iconoclastic and, therefore, representative of a later
period than that first flowering which bore the church, are hid;
though ambo and iconostasis are down, carpets skewed Meccawards and
Turkish texts aloft; the imagination can reconstruct the old
interior, the very pivot of the Byzantine world. St. Sophia is the
particular visible expression of the first coalescence; it exhales
the grandeur of Rome, the sanity of Hellas, the mystery of the
East, and the universality of Christianity. Here, atop the entrant,
is no building begun from earth, raised stone by stone upon the
plans of an engineer; but a form, a dream abiding, planted entire
from heaven. The form, the strength elude. Yet all is clarity,
exactitude. The gift of tongues has fallen upon brick and stone.
Moslems chant; Christians shuffle boat-footed on the matting. But
what the import of obsolete creeds, when here, if ever, Reality is
God?</p>

<p>The old church of Constantine was burnt on the 15th of January,
532. By February the 23rd, the new was begun. Five years and ten
months later, on the day after Christmas, 537, the Emperor
Justinian proceeded to its dedication. At a cost computed by a
later authority to have been &pound;12,840,000 in bullion,
equivalent in present purchasing value to over sixty-four million
pounds sterling, the architects Isidore the Milesian and Anthemius
of Tralles had erected a church in length and breadth 241 feet by
224, surmounted by a shallow spreading dome 104 feet in diameter
and rising, in its eventual form after the earthquake of twenty-one
years later,179 feet from floor to vertex. The whole stood, and
stands yet,[*] on a cistern equal, in Byzantine estimation, to the
floating of a hundred galleys. "Solomon;" apostrophized the
Emperor, "I have surpassed thee." With posterity he was not
concerned. And what relevant comparison can posterity show? St.
Peter's, consummate negation of religious inspiration and
affirmation of the papal ego, breathes empty flesh in every joint
of its irremediable classicism. Yet the comparison is relevant
after all. It is final. It sums completely the difference between
Orthodox and Catholic Europe. The existence of St. Sophia is
atmospheric; that of St. Peter's, overpoweringly, imminently
substantial. One is a church to God; the other, a salon for his
agents. One is consecrated to Reality, the other to illusion. St.
Sophia, in fact, is large, and St. Peter's is vilely, tragically
small.</p>

<blockquote>[* The building has withstood not only numerous
earthquakes, but a city fire in 1755, when the lead from the dome
ran molten down the gutters.]</blockquote>

<p>Six thousand sheep, a thousand each of oxen, pigs and poultry,
and half a thousand deer were roasted at the first dedication. The
marvel of the Eastern lands, enshrining forever the heart of Greek
patriotism, was in being. Let us conceive the interior that caught
the allegiance of those early Byzantines, the interior that
continues to hold that of their descendants, before it suffered the
mutilation of the crusaders and transformation to the uses of the
Prophet.</p>

<p>The rectangular doorways, curtained with woven animals, give
entrance to a great field of smoky marble, bound in strips of dull
carnation green. Surrounding, a system of marble paneling applies
to the walls, as we know wood. Sheets of stone, cut and cut again
so that the veining of each piece may form symmetrical pattern with
its neighbor, alternate with bands of other marbles set in
delicately notched beveling. Today, the mist of age and seeming
disuse films the different colors to a single tone. To Paul the
Silentiary, poet of the second dedication, all the glories of
nature glimmer about him: "Spring green from Carystus, and Phrygian
polychrome, where flowers of red and silver shine; porphyry
powdered with stars; crocus glittering like gold; milk poured on a
flesh of black; blue cornflowers growing among drifts of fallen
snow";[*] categorically he enumerates the marble vesture.
Supporting the galleries and the walls above them, tiers of
pillars, porphyry, verde-antique, and every kind of marble,
continue the structure of the church. Those beneath, ranged in
curves, bear gilded capitals, carved not to deflect the eye, but
worked inwardly to carry it up. The curving walls above are
similarly wrought in a texture of punctured elaboration, inset with
plaques of porphyry. Then gradually, the four triangular
pendentives, each bearing the mosaic of a six-winged cherubim,
creep out to support the cornice of the dome, whence Christ
Pantocrator looks down in majesty to judge the world. Beneath him
stands the ambo, used for ceremonies such as coronations: a huge
jasper pulpit borne by eight pillars and inlaid with ivory and
silver. Before and behind, two stairways lead to encircling outer
walls upon the floor, which support two semicircles of rose-colored
columns bound in bronze. On these rest beams, blue and gold, which
bear aloft silver crosses in the likeness of the Chi-Rho, and
cone-shaped candelabra.</p>

<blockquote>[* Lethaby and Swainson's translation,
adapted.]</blockquote>

<p>From this boundary, a passage, banistered in verde-antique,
leads to the iconostasis, the great silver screen across the
eastern apse. Framed at intervals by silver-sheeted columns bearing
pairs of winged angels, broad silver panels exhibit chased circular
patterns, monograms of the Apostles and of Justinian and Theodore.
Within, a temple of silver gilt, hung with scarlet curtains
depicting the same sovereigns prostrate before Christ, and
surmounted by a silver tower in the form of an octagonal cone,
contains the golden and enameled altar, "wonder of all nations,"
which the crusaders will smash and bear away. Around hang the
votive crowns of the Emperors, fired with the dull light of
cabochon jewels and enamel plaques. And over all, high up on the
curving mosaic vault, broods the Mother of God and her Child, blue
and white and gold, from a throne of red, and a green
footstool.</p>

<p>But it is the light, the formless, unbegotten radiance of no
visible source, which brings harmony to these
elements&mdash;almost, it might be said, transfigures them. In a
Gothic cathedral, there are only cavernous shadows and dramatic
rays; in a classical, the windows are of blatant, hygienic
convenience. But in St. Sophia, an exquisite luminous mist seems to
envelop the whole church, diffused from innumerable small windows
set along the cornice of the dome, and in the walls elsewhere.
Shadows are not; only depths. Hence the elusive form, the glory of
the building, speaking to all men with the gift of tongues. And at
night, in Byzantine days, it is the same. Falling in a gigantic
circle from the cornice of the dome, chain upon chain of varying
lengths carry stupendous silver discs arid crosses pierced to hold
the myriad oil glasses and their floating wicks. Sconces in form of
bowls and ships [*] reveal the colors of the marble sheeting. The
iconostasis flickers athwart the apse. A pendant cross glows above
it. Christ in the dome, ruler of the world, glitters the reflection
of invisible lamps atop the cornice. Outside, alike through winter
storms and the velvet calm of summer nights, the light shines over
the sea, beacon of which every Byzantine sailor carries a spark in
his heart, "beckoning not only the merchantman, but the way to the
living God."</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>To comprehend the later development of Byzantine art, the
emergence of its pictorial genius and the last efflorescence of
Greek painting, it is necessary to take some stock of the diffuse
culture which accompanied it, and without which its peculiar
characteristics must inevitably have degenerated, as they did
elsewhere, into folk-tainted decoration.</p>

<p>Literacy was no privilege of clerics or the aristocracy. In the
themes, popular education was organized under the auspices of the
Metropolitans, as it continued to be among the Anatolian Greeks
until 192.3, the priestly or other teachers being paid for their
services by the children's parents. In the capital, schools were
officially subsidized; while, for those of noble or, more
accurately speaking, bureaucratic descent, there was a bi-sexual
seminary within the precincts of the Great Palace itself. A
University, founded in the fifth century by Theodosius II, and
known as the Octagon, also flourished. Here grammar, rhetoric,
dialectic, and the classics were studied after the manner of
Antiquity. But it stank in the nostrils of the iconoclasts and was
closed by the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian, in 727.</p>

<p>Greeks without education are as bees in midwinter. Moreover, as
Rambaud has written, "in the Greek Empire, the humanities seemed
indispensable, and at the same time, sufficient, for the formation
of civil servants." During more than a century, the study of the
humanities was in abeyance. Nor only individuals, but the state
services themselves, suffered proportionately. For in
Constantinople, as in England today, the broadest mental training
was considered essential to eventual administrative success. It was
to repair the efficiency of the bureaucracy, as previously shown on
Chapter 6, pages 135 and 136, to set seal on the iconoclast defeat,
and to gratify both his own and the popular craving, that the
Caesar Bardas, brother of the Empress-Regent Theodora, and virtual
ruler of the Empire from 856 to 866, refounded the University of
Constantinople. Cultured and loose living, an efficient
administrator and dispenser of justice, the typically "Renaissance"
personality of the Caesar became the center of an intellectual
clique who impressed their names on history: Photius, afterwards
Patriarch of the first schism, and sometimes called the wisest man
of the Middle Ages; Constantine, apostle to the Slays, whose
cultural birth through him accomplished was jointly inspired by
Photius and the Caesar; Methodius, parent of the modern Czech; and
Leo the Mathematician, Bishop of Salonica, to whose care the new
University was entrusted.</p>

<p>First in the revived curriculum came the classics. It is not to
be supposed that the part of the Byzantines, <i>les
biblioth&eacute;caires du genre humain</i>, in preserving the
writings of Antiquity, was a wholly passive one. More of those
fabled books were their possession than are ours. And these lay,
not moldering in cupboards as historians have sedulously preached,
but beneath the scrutiny of perpetual copyists, whose volumes were
disseminated to student and dilettante alike. It was computed, at
one time, that the royal library alone contained 30,000 books. In
the higher ranks of society, women were often as well educated as
men.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the ninth century witnessed an advance in the
practical application of science. Greek fire was already
discovered. Under the Emperor Theophilus, last of the iconoclasts,
Leo of Salonica invented the dial in the Emperor's cabinet,
recording the messages of the Asiatic fire telegraph, and was also
responsible for the jeweled birds and golden lions that sang and
roared about his throne. Such, in fact, was the fame of
Constantinople in this respect, that the Caliph of Baghdad in
concluding a treaty with the Greeks, stipulated for the visit of
three professors of mathematics to his court; of these Leo was one.
At the beginning of the twelfth century, it is recorded that the
blinded conspirator, Nicephorus Diogenes, studied geometry by means
of figures in solid relief. After the Latin Conquest, the mantle of
scientific and mathematical learning fell to Trebizond, whither
voyaged students in search of it from every part of the Levant. But
the eleventh century was the golden age of Byzantine education. And
the width of its field may be judged by the subjects of which, at
the age of twenty-five, Psellos informs posterity that he had
mastered the ultimate intricacies: Rhetoric, Philosophy, Music,
Law, Geometry, Astronomy, Medicine, Magic, and, through
Neoplatonism, Platonism.</p>

<p>Music, as a province of the higher culture is seldom mentioned
in the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, Byzantine attainment in this
sphere is difficult to reconstruct. Music played a large part in
military and court ceremonial. Whenever the Emperor moved from the
Great Palace, he was accompanied by bands of drums and trumpets; on
campaigns, soldiers marched to the sound of flutes; orders were
given by the trumpet; and the first recorded army bands of Western
Europe are said to have been borrowed from the Turks, inheritors of
the Byzantine. Mechanical organs gladdened the Empress to her bath;
a golden organ filled the throne room of the birds and lions with
mysterious sound at the reception of foreign ambassadors; the
factions of the circus had each its silver organ, to be played on a
wooded terrace in the palace gardens. The ecclesiastical music of
the time has survived in numerous manuscripts; but their
interpretation is uncertain. The chants appear to have been akin to
Gregorian, of which they were probably the original inspiration;
their rendering by the embassy of Michael I Rhangab&eacute; charmed
the Emperor Charlemagne; and they are represented, to some extent,
in the traditional tunes of the modern Greek folk songs. Also they
formed the basis of Russian church music, thus lending all Russian
tunes and composers their distinction both from those of Western
Europe and the formless monotony of the lesser Slav peasantries. To
the Chrysanthine system of the modern Greek Church, they are in no
way related; this being a purely Oriental importation.</p>

<p>In language and literature, the eleventh century witnessed the
further growth of an evolution which was destined to prove, right
down to the present time, and probably for many years beyond it,
the <i>damnosa hereditas</i> of the Greek race. This was the
divergence between the written and the spoken tongue. The Attic
pedantry of schoolmasters lived then as now and with disastrous
results for the unfortunate language of which the Attic dialect was
formerly a part. To write even letters in the vernacular was to
defy the accepted canons of taste. And while in the West French,
Spanish, and Italian were growing out of Latin, the youth of
Constantinople was still obliged to load its pen with the jejune
purity of classic models. With the revived study of the humanities,
and particularly of Plato, in the eleventh century, the divergence
was rendered permanent. The language of conversation, unrecognized
as a medium of artistic expression, was consigned to the limbo of
vulgarity. In the phrase of Krumbacher, it was as though the
Italian Renaissance had substituted Ciceronian Latin for the
language of Dante. Words evolved, but were never committed to
paper. Style became but a heaping of clauses. That, in a thousand
years, the highly developed Byzantine culture produced no literary
work of the least importance, is a convincing testimony to the
danger of the oft-mourned past's survival. Posterity maybe thankful
that no such adherence to the models of Praxiteles and Pheidias
developed, as it was later to do in Western Europe, a similar
stranglehold on art.</p>

<p>There exists, of course, a large bulk of Byzantine literature.
Its foremost works, the theological, are of too topical an interest
to attract the attention of subsequent generations. In history, the
Greeks have at all times excelled. Royalty, ecclesiastic,
bourgeois, each in turn assumed the function of chronicler. And
despite the tedium of form, their outlook is balanced and
understanding of human character. The output of poetic hymns, from
the eighth century on, was profuse; unfortunately their beauty has
not withstood translation into Ancient and Modern. Apart from such
songs as the dirge to the fallen city, quoted on the last of these
pages, the most unique product of medieval Greek literature is the
epic of <i>Digenis Akritas</i>. This poem, dating from the tenth or
eleventh centuries, is a romance of the Anatolian border in the
days before Manzikert, when the Byzantine dominion stretched almost
to the Euphrates. There pervades it not only the eternal spark of
Greek patriotism, championing the sacred monarchy in Constantinople
and its heavenly prototype, but something of the joyous lassitude
of Persia, together with the chivalresque caprice of the great
captain of the marches. The exploits of the hero, in which history
and legend mingle, have penetrated even Russian folklore. Had the
Empire endured, and Atticism lapsed, as it must eventually have
done, before the need for popular expression, this poem would have
occupied, for modern Greeks, the position of the Chanson de Roland
or the Canterbury Tales for French or English.</p>

<p>With such measure of culture, save in art, appreciative rather
than creative, the Byzantine civilization reached a climax that
lasted from Charlemagne to the crusades. The West lay dark and
savage; behind the walls of Constantinople, the classic spirit of
humanism waxed and waned, but was never quite extinguished. There
alone the amenities of living flourished. Occasionally in
architectural form, the Eastern influence went West, as shown at
Aix or P&eacute;rigueux; but more often it was in the products of
craftsmanship, in reliquaries of jewelers' and goldsmiths' work, in
glass, enamels and fabrics such as were afterwards discovered in
Charlemagne's tomb. And it is the splendor, of which these objects
were but echoes, which strikes the true note of the age. Something
of it remains in the gorgeous coloring of the mosaics of Daphni,
accentuated by their intimidating austerity of form. But its
outstanding monument is the great church of the monastery of St.
Luke of Stiris. Here the mosaics, if lacking the conspicuous genius
of the former, breathe a cold, vernal brilliance from each shadowed
vault above the beveled panels of dull polychrome marble. In this
church alone, situate on a trackless, oleandered spur of Parnassus,
is a true interior of the Empire's middle period to be seen. The
effect is one, which words, in the absence of analogy, cannot
convey.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>This splendor, and the material wealth implied, were the
sponsors of the Byzantine Renaissance, which took place in the
eleventh century. To the man in the street, the term "Renaissance"
conjures various and diverse portents: pagan Italy and Martin
Luther; manuscript-mongering scholars and the vanquishing of
Gothic; the seed of painting planted out of nothing in Giotto;
Columbus in his cockle shell, Caxton at his press. But in reality
the Renaissance was a unity of which each force represented by
these names was born, and to which each contributed. It was an
intellectual impulse, born of reaction against the stale
encyclopedics of Aristotle and a mysticism no longer synonymous
with, but opposed to, the trend of human progress. The quest of
Reality unaided was obsolete; there was need for subsidiary
channels. The system of the Ancients, of sensible enquiry into
man's proper significance, must be invoked.</p>

<p>Before the West was even thus consciously agrope, in
Constantinople, Greeks being Greeks, the logic of humanism, the
relating of life's fundamental purpose to the delicious
manifestations of the organic world, had never been wholly
discredited. And it was thence, from the Byzantines themselves as
well as from the ancestral classics in their keeping, that the
impulse of the Western Renaissance emanated. But the rediscovery of
Plato in the East was attended by no such revolution as it
afterward produced in the West: the physical odds against which the
Empire had now to contend were too great, and the patent abuses of
Plato's opponent, the Orthodox Church, too few, to secure his
profoundest effect. It was Italy, therefore, that reaped where the
Greeks had sown. Save only in painting. In that, the harvest was
shared between them.</p>

<p>Although the creative faculties of the Byzantine were mainly
guided by the mystic and inspirational, it was, nonetheless, only
its hold on the rational Hellenic perception of sensory values that
gave Byzantine culture its uniqueness. Though, from the first, the
free exercise of Reason to discover for each individual an
interpretation of destiny and duty had been suspect in the eyes of
the Church; though the flesh of Hypatia, Neoplatonist of the fifth
century, had been scraped from her bones in the streets of
Alexandria; though the philosophical schools of Athens had been
closed by Justinian in 531, and the University of Constantinople by
the iconoclasts two hundred years later; yet always there had
existed those who, though not so drastic as the fourth-century
Emperor Julian the Apostate in his contempt for the Christian
intellect, despite the civil virtues thereby engendered, retained
the belief that not only religion, but material phenomena in
addition, provided channels of communication with the Affinity of
man's perpetual seeking. Of these was the Caesar Bardas, leader of
the anti-Puritan reaction of the ninth century, and precursor, with
his learned and influential contemporary, the Patriarch Photius, of
a movement which reached its climax at the end of the eleventh. For
it was then that the true Byzantine Renaissance took place.
Psellos, the wisest man of his age and minister of the Empire,
advertised Plato.</p>

<p>There now arrives that monstrous, stupid paradox, the rejection
of Platonism, fundamentally religious in outlook and classical only
in method, by a body of Christian opinion that had long accepted
the undiluted materialism of Aristotle. To sum, in a sentence, the
difference between the two is a presumption which only the present
context can excuse. But holding this in view, it may be said that,
in the first place, to Aristotle the conception of an Absolute
Reality, external to man, but possessing in him a personal
affinity, was unknown; such Reality as he sought was of diverse and
impossible elements, such as Justice and Beauty, each possessed of
that insulated significance which has proved the greatest curse of
the classical incubus. And that, in the second, this limited and
scattered Truth was contained for him wholly in objects admitting
of sensory perception; his quest, in fact, was a matter of
analysis. Plato, on the other hand, discovered God. The "Absolute
Reality, external to man, but possessing in him a personal
affinity," was the beginning of thought for him; in it "Justice and
Beauty" were coordinate; the significance of material phenomena was
apparent only in terms of it. To Aristotle, material phenomena were
as viscera to the analyst; to Plato they were subsidiary to his
instinctive location of the element sought. The quest of Reality, a
Reality in which the why and wherefore of things had no part, gave
him his ideal, and was for him the ideal of man. But the hounds of
the pursuit were Reason. And such, for the sake of that very
function, was his exaltation of Reason, that the means became
confused with the end: Reason became his golden calf, synonymous
with God. Hence, while Aristotle, the encyclopedist-chemist delving
in the earth for abstractions, was a docile creature in the hands
of Christian <i>doctrinaires</i>, Plato, glorifying Reason no
matter where it led, opened vistas of unlimited heterodoxy.
Thus&mdash;to trace the sequence of history&mdash;the fundamental
impulse of the Reformation was the ideal of Plato communicated as
an intellectual state. Men must think independently: the quest of
Reality is in fact synonymous with logical, independent thought.
But Reality is absolute, immutable by speculation. By accepting
this doctrine, preserved from idolatry by the latter reservation,
the reformed churches regained in some measure the path which the
old had lost. But in the Orthodox Church, as distinct from the
Roman, whose Absolute, far from being immutable by thought, was the
product of an inventive and politically engrossed hierarchy, the
path had never been actually out of sight.[*] Had Byzantine
civilization survived, the Platonic element in the future
Protestantism might have filtered Northwest by means of
imperceptible mental contact, in place of violent social upheaval.
East and Northwest would have been one; and the Roman Church been
left to itself, an outcast of the South.</p>

<blockquote>[* It may be said that while the Orthodox Church
alternately blessed and damned the letter of Plato's teaching, the
intellectual attitude thereby produced and communicated to the
uninitiate, was permitted to flourish.]</blockquote>

<p>Psellos was the precursor of these incalculable movements.
Appointed by the Emperor Constantine IX Monomach (1042-1054) to the
chair of a lately founded school of philosophy, he circumvented
possible suspicion on the part of the Church by proclaiming Plato a
kind of early Father. At first the Ecumenical Patriarch gave the
new teaching his blessing. As its fame spread, the whole Levant,
like Italy four centuries later, was overcome with excitement;
Arabs and Persians hurried to Constantinople. But Psellos,
indiscreet with success and incapable of moderation in the cause of
his heart, now turned on the Church, accused the Patriarch of
practicing astrology and magic, and eventually created such
disturbance that the Emperor was obliged to close the school. A
reaction set in, which resulted, during the last quarter of the
eleventh century, in the utterance of official anathemas against
the classical philosophers. But the work was done; and the
influence of Psellos and his friends remained. The general respect
for their learning enabled them to fill the chief posts of the
administration. And their attempt to weaken the landed magnates of
Asia Minor by reduction of the fighting forces was responsible for
the defeat of Manzikert in 1071 and the loss of half the Empire.[*]
Psellos was a complex character, a Hellene and a Byzantine. "I
ought," he wrote, "to think only of God; but my nature and my
soul's irresistible desire for all knowledge have led me in the
direction of science." A tragic apology, semi-grotesque, but at all
events consequent. Plato was now read; his works were multiplied,
as though with a prophetic view to Italian circulation; and his
humanism was reflected in an artistic naturalism which served to
enhance rather than obscure the austere ideals of Byzantine
representation.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Chapter 5, page 101 and Chapter 6, pages
136-137.]</blockquote>

<p>Psellos himself wrote letters to officials in Greece, begging
them send him statues. He was the first of the pedagogue
Philhellenes. Already he pens the familiar phrase: "Must we not
love the children for their parents' sake, though, indeed, they
reproduce not all their features?" He upbraids the prefect of
Athens for finding her provincialism boring. But underneath these
admonitions, become odious with time, burns the sacred patriotism,
the lamp of the race. "The Byzantine Empire;" he writes, "is the
Greek Empire."</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Thus was inaugurated the last tradition of Byzantine art, which
was to survive the Latin Conquest. Prior to that event, however,
its implantation in Italy was already accomplished. Its centers in
that country were two: the provinces south of Rome, where until the
twentieth century Greek was still the language of remote villages,
and which were not finally lost to Greek rule till the twelfth
century; and Venice, the town which was originally modeled on
Constantinople, and which presented, in St. Mark's, a continually
inspiring, if slightly Italianate, model of Byzantine art. From
these sources, gradually diffusing over the whole peninsula a
technique become limited and rudimentary from lack of intercourse
with Constantinople, Italian painting was born. Vasari, its
earliest historian, ascribes its parentage to thirteenth-century
Greeks. On the part of such pictures as the Sienese primitives or
those ascribed to Cimabue, the direct imitation of the Byzantine
icon is not disputed. But in the case of Giotto and his immediate
successors, the analogy has not been pursued. Yet it is only
necessary to visit the Kahri&eacute; mosque in Constantinople, or
the churches of Mistra and Mount Athos, to discover unquestionable
identity of form, arrangement, and architectural clich&eacute;.
Henceforth, with the isolation and gradual subsidence of the
Empire, Greek and Italian painting went different ways. In Venice
alone the legacy remained. There, the colors of the Byzantines,
cold blues and vinous reds, survived, though without the principle
of their application. And much of Tintoretto, his impressionism and
tendency to elongation in the interest of his composition, can only
have derived from the impress which the extinct civilization of
Eastern Europe had left upon his home.</p>

<p>Conversely it has been asserted that the Byzantine Renaissance
of painting owed its origin to contact with Italy. In the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, when there was no longer a cultural
center in the East, and the Venetians were in Crete, something of
the Italian freedom of form was assimilated by Greek artists;
though the result, save in the case of isolated icon painters,
seems to have been uniformly unfortunate. But in its initial
stages, the advance of naturalism which characterized the last
phase of Byzantine art was synonymous with the rediscovery of
humanism, which took place in Constantinople some centuries before
in Italy. In Constantinople, moreover, the Greeks were deeply
attached to the old vehicles of religious expression; naturalism
was assimilated to them; it did not displace them as in the West.
After the Latin Conquest, Greeks travelled little. And apart from
the barrier erected by the mutual hatred of the Orthodox and
Catholic Churches, there was little inducement for Italian artists
to seek their fortune in the impoverished Empire. Visitors from the
West were engaged either in commerce or conquest. Such cultural
intercourse as there was flowed from the East, not to it.</p>

<p>The surviving examples of later Byzantine painting have been
divided into two categories, the Macedonian and the Cretan schools.
The distinction is at first obscure. The mosaics of the
Kahri&eacute; stand outside both: not only as mosaics, rare in an
era of material decline; but in the felicity, almost facility, of
their compositions, and the pervading peace and simplicity of their
figures. These, almost contemporary, approach very closely the
works of Giotto. Next in order of time, as far as dates can be
surmised, come the paintings of the Brontocheion and the
Peribleptos at Mistra; in these churches the true Byzantine method
of coloration by contrast, with which the Cretan school was later
to be particularly identified, appears to combine with the
quiescent dignity of Macedonian forms. Only in the frescoes of the
Pantanassa, painted immediately before the fall of Constantinople
in the first half of the fifteenth century, does the Cretan
character predominate, in the unique beauty of the coloring. But on
Mount Athos, the difference between the two schools is easily
perceptible; there, the Macedonian, arriving at the beginning of
the fourteenth century, preceded the Cretan by two centuries,
employing a separate iconography and a more Westerly technique of
color. Its frescoes exhale an atmosphere of piety and quietude, and
a sobriety of light, which, if tending sometimes to weakness,
bespeak the dignity of spiritual repose, of unshaken faith in the
hidden world amid the mounting catastrophes of this. From these
ideals, the Cretan method of expression was far removed. There are
strange qualities about this Antarctic of the Greek world.
Statesmen of the early twentieth century had cause to recall the
seven hundred years of perpetual revolt that comprised the island's
latter history. And such, indeed, is the text of its art. A warring
of forces, of souls in cataclysm, is born into the conflict of its
lines and colors. All that distinguishes Byzantine art from that of
the West is riven from its hieratic quiet to form a staccato world
of acrid shadow and livid prominence, agog with angry, inner light
or swathed in silken tulle of ethereal brilliance. Something
possessed these artists, some spirit wrestling with their figures,
that we have not. And of their line was born, eighty-eight years
after the fall of Constantinople, Domenicos Theotocopoulos. Cretan
in birth and personality, he has furnished the epilogue and climax
to Byzantine culture.</p>

<p>When, in the last half of the sixteenth century, El Greco came
to Italy, the Renaissance, that exquisite short song of Gothic
spirit in the voice of humanism, had died away. Only the band
played on, a ponderous empty symphony in which the heralds of
baroque were piping unsubstantial notes. Of its form the Greek
borrowed such measure of naturalism as was necessary to conquer
naturalism. With this attained, he loosed from its iconographic
prison the achievement of a millennium. Settling, at Toledo, amid
barren rippling hills like Crete's, and a semi-Oriental culture
reminiscent of his own, he gave to the art of his ancestors not a
naturalism conventional as their own formality, but freedom,
absolute, and vindicated by a consummate ability. Alone he did it,
and alone he lived, vouchsafing no explanations, but speaking
sometimes, to such as understood his native tongue, of the
infallibility of his race. He was the greatest Greek; perhaps, for
those who have seen the St. Maurice, the greatest artist in all the
world. Yet Greeks today, puffed of their earthy speculators,
scarcely know him. Meanwhile European art pursued another road; and
when he died, only his color remained for Velasquez to dilute. A
dubious posterity has thought to discern an astigmatism in his eye.
Let it grieve, also, for that same astigmatism, which, for thirty
generations, afflicted the artists of Byzantium: the astigmatism of
fixation on Reality. Are not we, too, after four centuries, again
infected?</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-10"></a>Chapter 10. The Joyous Life</h3>

<p>The structure of the Empire, its commerce and wealth; its
religious idea; its learning and creative artistry: the stable, the
transcendental, and the cultural elements; prefaced by a suggestion
of history; into these has the anatomy of Byzantine civilization
resolved. But like a house, civilization is more than its
structural components, than bricks and plan and paint; it is a
unity, an atmospheric environment, implied not in the category of
its blessings, but in their common reaction; to be judged by the
tenor of Monday rather than Saturday. The outline is limned, even
the shape; there remains to impress the reader with the very color
of Byzantine life. Those, who seek, may find it still, lurking in
the coves of the Aegean, softening the brown castellated ranges of
Anatolia; wrapped in the treeless decay of Venice; glancing about
the flowered monasteries of Athos; glowing, as through a smoked
glass, over all Constantinople. And whence its light? The light is
in the air; and the air holds the print of lesser things, of common
round and average character, of the immediate concerns of
individuals. The evidence is scattered; materials await the
researches of a profounder scholarship than this. But irrelevant as
the following details seem, to some extent they fill the void. The
names take life and the bodies move. Without them, the medieval
Greeks must stand divorced in mystery forever, insoluble as the
Chinese. Whereas it is of their wedding with the past and future of
Eastern Europe that this book purports to tell.</p>

<p>Of royalty, nobility, and bourgeois, isolated pictures
emerge.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The hub of the world was Constantinople. Within it was another
hub, an immense walled precinct on the point of land at the foot of
the Bosporus between the Golden Horn and the Marmora, and
stretching in terraced decline from the plateau of the Hippodrome
and St. Sophia to the three waters. Here, overlooking the sea to
the Asiatic mountains, dwelt the Greek Emperors. Here, set among
groves of trees and planted gardens, a vast concourse of buildings,
churches, stables, banqueting halls, fountains, accouchement
chambers, schools, and barracks, enshrined that unending ritual,
the life of "the Autocrat of the Romans faithful in Christ." Of
that ceaseless liturgy, from birth in the porphyry pavilion at the
water's edge; of the landmarks, coronations, marriages, and
triumphs; of the everyday procedure corresponding with the
religious calendar, the processions, services, and investitures; of
the banquets, festivities, and races in the Hippodrome; to the last
ceremony of interment at the church of the Holy Apostles, record
survives.[*] But occasional scenes stand out, to speak not of
ostentation, frivolity, and immobility, but a profound and subtle
beauty. The being of Byzantine royalty was set in as lovely a frame
as man and nature could devise. Political theorists, blind to the
temperaments of peoples and the sanctification of the state in
symbols, may cavil. But whatever the faults which posterity
discerns in the Byzantine sovereignty, the lethargy commonly
associated with excessive formality is not one of them.</p>

<p>[* In the <i>De Ceremoniis</i> of the Emperor Constantine VII
Porphyrogenitus.]</p>

<p>The hall of great banquets was the Triclinos of the Nineteen
Settees. And it was here that took place the Christmas dinner in
the reign of the Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, of which
the ambassador Liutprand, afterwards Bishop of Cremona, has left an
account. The Emperor, if the ordinary custom was observed, was
surrounded, in imitation of his heavenly prototype, by twelve
chosen companions; while the rest of the company, to the number of
216, was disposed in parties of twelve at the remaining eighteen
tables. The plate was of gold; and the weight of the three gold
vases of dessert necessitated their arrival on three
scarlet-upholstered chariots, whence they were hoisted to table by
ropes descending from a ceiling of golden foliage, and wound on to
a revolving machine. The ambassador, though disconcerted, as the
modern visitor to Greece, at the oil cooking and resinous wine of
the people, bears testimony to the excellence of occasional dishes.
The meal was followed by a display of acrobatics, in which two boys
ascended a pole twenty-four feet high, balanced on a man's head. A
second banqueting hall was the Chryso-Triclinos, a domed octagon
supported on eight arches leading to eight apses. The walls were
covered with a mosaic of flowers, framed in a tracery of carved
ciphers bound in silver. The doors were of silver; the feet of the
guests trod on a crush of roses, rosemary, and myrtle; the plate
was of gold, the tables of gold and silver; and both were enameled
and jeweled.</p>

<p>Later than these was the Magnavra, situate on a terrace of tall
trees by the sea, and containing the famous throne room of the
iconoclast Emperor Theophilus, decreed for the reception of foreign
ambassadors. At the end of a long hall, hung with silver
chandeliers and echoing with the music of a golden organ, sat the
Emperor at the head of six steps, guarded by golden lions and
griffins, and shaded by trees of gilded bronze, in whose branches
glittered jeweled and enameled birds. As the ambassadors
approached, the lions moved towards him; their mouths roared; their
tails twanged the ground; while, above, the birds gave forth the
twitters of their kind. As the eyes of the visitor were bent in
prostration, Emperor and throne were wafted bodily into the
ceiling; to descend, ere the stranger's head was raised, with the
former newly arrayed in the hieratic vestments of his office. These
bewildering devices, to the weight of 200 pounds of gold, in value
&pound;43,000, were melted down by Theophilus's extravagant son,
Michael III, and afterwards minted into a special coinage by his
successor Basil H. But a curious light is thrown on the movements
of dispersed Byzantine treasure in the narrative of Clavijo's
embassy to Samarcand in 1404-1406. On the occasion of a visit to
Tamerlane's chief wife, Clavijo remarked a pair of doors "covered
with plates of silver gilt, ornamented with patterns in blue
enamel...All this was so finely wrought that evidently never in
Tartary nor, indeed, in our Western land of Spain, could it have
been come to. In the one door was figured the image of St. Peter,
while in the other was St. Paul..." These, reported by the Tartars
to have been found among the treasure of the defeated Turkish
Sultan Bajazet at Brussa, were plainly Byzantine. But more
astonishing still in this capital of central Asia, there appeared,
within the tent, "a golden tree that simulated an oak, and its
trunk was thick as might be a man's leg...This tree reached to the
height of a man, and below it was made as though its roots grew
from a great dish that lay there. The fruit of this tree consisted
of vast numbers ofbalas rubies, emeralds, turquoises, sapphires and
common rubies with many great round pearls of wonderful orient and
beauty...while numerous little birds, made of gold enamel in many
colors were to be seen perching on the branches."[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* A similar tree to that of Theophilus graced the
court of the Abbassid Caliphs in the tenth century. Its branches
numbered eighteen, and it was attended by phalanxes of mounted
knights draped in silken uniforms and also moveable. On the subject
of any mechanism, Clavijo (see bibliography) is silent. But this,
after five or six hundred years, was probably in need of
repair.]</blockquote>

<p>It was in the Emperor's cabinet in the Magnavra, adjoining the
throne room of the birds and lions, that the messages of the
Asiatic fire telegraph were recorded. To the unsleeping sentries on
the Pharos, the island lighthouse at the entrance of the Bosporus,
the signals were transmitted from the Eastern coast of the Marmora,
having come hilltop to hilltop from the interior. And their import,
by the invention of Leo of Salonica, was determined by the hour
marked on a clock in the Emperor's cabinet, constructed to keep
exact time with a fellow on the Cilician frontier. Each hour, it
was arranged, should represent a different message. Hence perhaps
arose the Western legend that Virgil, in the role of necromancer
with which the Dark Ages invested him, had fashioned for Augustus a
set of twelve images called "Salvatio Romae." Each of these,
representing an imperial province, bore a bell in its hand. When
that province was in revolt, the bell struck. Here, possibly, in
the guise of a traveler's tale turned history, is a clue to the
nature of Leo's "dial."</p>

<p>In the latter part of the ninth century arose the new palace of
the Emperor Basil I the Macedonian, surpassing in splendor all that
had ever been seen. The chief hall took the form of a basilica
supported on eight columns of verde-antique alternating with
another eight of red onyx decorated with reliefs of vines and
animals. The Emperor's bedroom adjacent was wholly covered with
mosaic: on the ceiling, starred with gold, a cross of brilliant
green dominated the room; on the walls, above a floral wainscoting,
the imperial family were ranged on a background of gold; on the
floor from a medallion of a peacock, there radiated four diagonal
strips of green marble to four smaller medallions containing
eagles. There was also a summer bedroom, having one side open to
the garden and the others adorned with mosaic hunting scenes.
Byzantine art was continuing the secular tradition inaugurated by
the iconoclast magnificence of the Emperor Theophilus.</p>

<p>Thus, like the Greek Augusti themselves, the reader may wander
forever between the walls of marble and gold, crushing the scent of
flowers and herbs, opening the doors of silver and ivory, brushing
the scarlet curtains woven with animals, dazzled with the
traditional palace vista of gold and silver chandeliers. Through
the churches of the Palace precinct: the Oratory of the Savior,
with its floor one sheet of silver inlaid with niello and its walls
of silver gilt set with pearls and cabochons; the New Church of
Basil I, with its six bronze domes glowing in the sun; and the
Church of our Lady of Pharos, pendant with doves of white gold
studded with emeralds, and carrying cruciform sprigs of pearls in
their beaks; past the innumerable fountains: the "Mystic Phiale" of
the Sigma, its golden pineapple spouting wine into a silver-bound
basin full of almonds and pistachios, where the Emperor enthroned
received the delegates of the circus factions and reviewed the
horses before the races, as kings shake hands with Cup-tie
finalists in modern England; the similar pineapples on long shafts
in the courtyard of the New Church, one of red porphyry surrounded
by dragons, the other of iridescent marble in the company of rams
goats and cocks in expectorant bronze. Among the schools, cadet
corps, and sentries in gilded armor and red aigrettes. Along the
polo ground. And down at last to the artificial port of the
Boucoleon, with the royal yachts and barges lying at anchor. Here
the days of the monarchy's affluence were passed. Here the
delegates of Christ planned and prayed and loved. Here evolved that
ritual of courts and royal divinity, which governed Europe till the
twentieth century; and which even our sons will scarcely
understand.</p>

<p>The place of women in the social structure of the Byzantines was
of an independence which a world of competitive modernity may
flatter itself on having lately reintroduced. And this is
particularly apparent in the lives of the Greek Empresses. Once
chosen, the affianced of the Emperor was crowned, not after, but
before, her marriage: the sacred essence of her royalty emanated
from God and not her husband. Henceforth, a separate household was
at her command; her fortune was subject to none but her own
control; and she was empowered to summon the great ministers of
state to conference, and to confer her own insignias on whom she
pleased. Following her marriage, the populace hailed her as "the
Augusta chosen of God"; and from now on, her every action was
attended by a ritualistic publicity which can only be compared to
that perfected by Louis XIV at Versailles. She was followed by the
whole court to the bridal bed; the consummation of her marriage was
celebrated by a banquet; and on the day following, court and city
formed a double line to see her to her bath, whither she was borne
to the music of organs. Grand dignitaries, servants bearing scents
and bathrobes, and three ladies-in-waiting carrying red enamel
apples encrusted with pearls, brought up the rear. A similar pomp
assisted the arrival of imperial heirs in the porphyry chamber by
the sea constructed for their purple bearing.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Of the Byzantine aristocracy and its division into bureaucrats
and territorial magnates, something has been said. But titles were
not hereditary; so that, in fact, it was only the latter who
developed the hereditary pride of a separate class. Name was the
true criterion of birth. And such a superscription as "[<i>Greek
characters</i>]"[*] illustrates the importance which even the
Emperors might attach to their connection with the most prominent
families of the Empire. The significance of the connection, often
commemorated by the retention of the maternal name, was with power,
not pedigree. For caste nobility there was no feeling. Until 1922,
many of the famous Byzantine names were still to be found among the
Greeks of Anatolia, often in districts of which they were once the
glory.</p>

<p>In the provinces, by the eighth century, a feudal system had
arisen which tended, as later happened in the West, to absorb the
land of the smaller proprietors. While the Isaurian and Macedonian
dynasties reigned, legislation was enforced to prevent this; the
Emperor Basil II Bulgaroctonos even undertook personal tours to
relieve the magnates who disturbed his peace of their possessions.
But with regional recruiting converted, for fear of rebellion on
the part of local leaders, into monetary payment, the smaller
owners fell still further into the hands of the greater, owing to
the financial assistance which, in bad years, only the latter could
afford them for their share of the scutage. Thus the process
continued; what the nobles lost in levies, they gained in land;
till the Frankish crusaders could remark the resemblance between
the conditions of Byzantine land tenure and their own. Finally,
after the extinction of the Macedonian dynasty in 1057, the throne
itself became the property of the landed aristocracy.</p>

<p>The potential wealth of Anatolia, should that region ever again
see peace and be inhabited by a settled and industrious people, may
be judged by the fortunes of the Smyrna merchants before the Great
War, which were derived almost entirely from an unsystematic
peasant agriculture covering a mere fraction of the available land.
In Byzantine days, the stock of a smaller proprietor consisted of
600 oxen, 100 plough teams, 800 horses out to grass, 80 saddle
horses and mules, and 12,000 sheep. In the middle of the estate
stood the manor house, dispensing universal hospitality, and having
wooden furniture inlaid with metal and ivory. The country palaces
of the great contained many courtyards; their rooms glittered with
mosaic or were hung with tapestries; they had baths, pools and
walled gardens, such as attach to the Moorish castles of Spain. But
from the eleventh century on, this prosperity was gradually
destroyed by the Eastern invasions. The coming of the Seljuk Turks
is a landmark in the economic history of the world; by their
agency, one of the richest territories known to man was
transformed, for all practical purposes of European well-being,
into a desert. A certain revival in agriculture was effected by the
Nicaean Emperor, John III Vatatzes, after the fourth crusade. By
his own example he sought to induce the aristocracy to live on
their estates as practical farmers. He improved the breed of cattle
and horses; grew food for the court and charities of his temporary
capital; and from the sale of his private eggs derived sufficient
profit to buy his wife a tiara of pearls.</p>

<p>The classic tale of Byzantine feudalism is the epic of
<i>Digenis Akritas</i>, one of the great historical romances of the
Middle Ages. The story, a mixture of legend and truth, is set among
the dark, sweeping ranges and bird-haunted marshlands of
Cappadocia, a frontier of fortified passes at the desert's edge,
where there is no cognizance of the opposing East and West. Here,
like the Western Palatines, the great vassals raided and fought,
unthinking of monarch and ministers in the capital. "Akritas" means
a Warden of the Marches; and "Digenis," twin-blooded; for while the
hero's mother had been a Dukaina of the famous family of Dukas, his
father was a Moslem prince from Edessa, or as some think, one of
the Puritan sect of the Paulicians. For love of his wife, he was
converted to Orthodoxy; and their son, child of Eurasia, grew into
the perfect type of Byzantine chivalry: soldier, hunter, lover;
and, over all, the patriot-knight&mdash;[<i>Greek
characters</i>]&mdash;of Christendom, defender of the Empire and
proud servant of its rulers.</p>

<p>In appearance this youth was fair; his hair was blond and curly;
his eyebrows contrastingly black; his complexion ruddy; and his
cheat broad and white as crystal. He was clothed in a red tunic,
embroidered with pearls, and fastened with gold buttons. Round his
neck hung a collar of amber and pearls. His boots were embroidered
with gold, his spurs inset with stones. Holding a green Arab lance
written over with golden characters, he sat a white horse, bridled
in enameled gold, upon a saddlecloth of green and rose. The mane of
the horse was powdered with turquoises and golden bells.[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* A very accurate portrait of a young Porphyrogenitus
of about the same period is preserved on an ivory casket now in
Troyes Cathedral and is reproduced in Hayford Pierce and Royall
Tyler's <i>Byzantine Art</i> (London, 1926). The rider has the seat
of an English cavalry officer; the bridle is without a bit. On the
other panels are hunting scenes: a boar attacked by hounds wearing
heavy collars; and a lion, with two arrows protruding from its
neck, springing upon the rider, who defends himself with a short
sword.]</blockquote>

<p>Such a figure was it that fired the leisure of Byzantine
humdrum. And the life was in accordance. Famed in childhood for his
slaying of wild beasts, Digenis Akritas, after enrolling in a
brigand band, abducted a Dukaina cousin from her father's palace.
(There is the stamp of truth in this cousinship; the family was too
distinguished for the incident to be apocryphal). Refusing a dowry,
he retired alone with her into the desert to hunt monsters; and the
fame of his prowess provoked a visit from the Emperor himself,
Romanus I Lecapenus. Next, he conducted a love affair with a
Saracen princess, left shiftless by a Greek, whom she had released
from prison. But conscience stricken at the remembrance of his
marriage vows, he restored her to him; to little purpose; for he
immediately fell victim to the seductions of an Amazon queen, whom,
like Siegfried, he had conquered in battle. Eventually, in a garden
of flowers, trees and singing birds by the banks of the Euphrates,
he built a palace. In the center, scene of splendid feasting, stood
a great hall in the form of a cross, decorated with mosaic figures
of the romance pantheon of Christian Hellenism, of Samson and
Achilles, David and Alexander, Ulysses and Joshua.</p>

<p>These were but wild oats. Ultimately he became a famous general;
won battles for the Empire; received presents from the soldier
Emperor, Nicephorus II Phocas. But his delight was always in
solitude, wandering by the flowing river with only his beloved.
Then, at the age of thirty-three, he died. Within a century
Manzikert was lost, the themes of the East fell to the Turks, and
beyond the frontier was barbarism. The palaces were overwhelmed;
the romantic, chivalresque life hardened and disappeared. What
monuments of it may survive, archeology has yet to discover.[*] But
Turks till recently have been known, who assume the designation
"Roumbeyoglu," implying descent from a "prince of Romania"; and who
claim, not that their ancestor was governor of a European province
in the early Ottoman Empire, but that he was a Byzantine noble, who
turned Moslem with the advancing tide, and who occupied precisely
that same castle which remains in his family today.</p>

<blockquote>[* The one exception, though Syrian, is the
eighth-century palace of Kusejr Amra, adorned with frescoes of the
Byzantine Emperor Chosro&euml;s King of Persia, Roderic King of the
Spanish Visigoths, and Negus of Abyssinia. See bibliography, A.
Musil.]</blockquote>

<p>Aristocracy, as a class, derives its prestige from the country.
The Byzantine bureaucracy was essentially town bred, for the most
part Constantinopolitan, and was recruited, since there was no
caste line, from the bourgeoisie and lesser nobility alike, they
themselves being entirely intermarried. Hence arose that cultured
liberalism which is only the product of large towns, but which,
being product of Constantinople, was inevitably linked with
religion. And there survive, to illustrate its germination in the
family circle, two character sketches of mothers left by
distinguished sons. In each case the mother appears as the
preponderant factor in the solution of the problems that beset the
family. For it was not the Empress alone who enjoyed an
independence which the women of such countries as Spain may still
envy. Under the Greek Empire, the property of a wife was in no way
confused with that of her husband. She was legally admissible to
the status of guardianship. And the conditions of divorce, though
subject to occasional alteration, always remained substantially the
same for both sexes.</p>

<p>The first of these Byzantine women, whom parentage has brought
fame, was the pious Theoctista, Constantinopolitan of the late
eighth century, and mother of Theodore of Studium. A rigid,
unswerving application to the work of salvation, both for herself
and those around her, was the dominant interest of her life. She
abstained from the ostentatious toilets of her station; not a feast
day passed, but that some outcast sat at her table. And on these
occasions, her servants, who habitually fed on bread, bacon, and
wine, were given fish, fresh meat, chickens, and better wine. At
other times she would beat them; then, overcome by remorse, fall on
her knees before them. Her nights were spent in acquisition of
knowledge which she might impart to her children. Conjugal intimacy
she discouraged, so as better to prepare for the eternal parting of
death. Finally, she persuaded herself, her husband, her three
brothers-in-law, and her children, to give themselves absolutely to
God. A few friends were invited to a farewell party; the house was
sold for the poor; the servants were dismissed; and the whole
family retired to their country estate in Bithynia, where they
lived on a wooded, well-watered plateau overlooking the sea. Upon
their denouncing as sinful the second marriage of the Emperor
Constantine VI&mdash;though his bride was actually a relative of
Theoctista's&mdash;they were forcibly dispersed; but were later
reinstated by the iconodule Empress Irene.</p>

<p>The picture has a dour, repelling stamp. The temperament of
Theoctista lacked the typically Byzantine mystic element which
alone can render religious fanaticism either palatable or
intelligible to those who do not possess it. And it was the age of
the iconoclasts. All the latent bitterness of piety was
uppermost.</p>

<p>About two and a half centuries later, at the beginning of the
eleventh century, lived Theodota, mother of Psellos the Hellenist.
From his account of her emerges a character sympathetic as
Theoctista's was not. Her outlook was serene and mystic; charity
was instinct in her, rather than consciously derived from the
letter of Christian commandment; moreover, she was type of an
eternal verity, the mother anxious for her children's worldly
advance. Possessing little education herself, beyond the ability to
read and embroider, it was through her machinations and endeavors,
fortified by dreams and messages from the Above, and nights spent
weeping before the Virgin's icon in St. Sophia, that Psellos
obtained the intellectual training which was to leave his name as
the originator of the European Renaissance. She was happy in
marriage; her husband was endowed with good looks, clear eyes, and
a patrician ancestry, and was without affectation. Like Theoctista,
she received the poor at her table, served them herself and washed
their feet. She had one daughter. This girl, casting about for a
neighbor to love as herself, lighted on a prostitute who lived
nearby. In answer to the latter's query: if she gave up her trade,
how should she live? Psellos's sister took her into her house and
shared with her all she possessed. She taught her to blush; to
forsake jeweler and colored shoes. But despite these renunciations,
there came a lapse, and to her reformer's horror and indignation,
the reclaimed girl was brought to bed of a child. Psellos,
meanwhile, had left the capital in pursuit of new learning. His
sister died soon after. And he describes how he returned, without
having heard the news, to encounter the funeral by chance. Theodota
was overwhelmed, and, despite the entreaties of her husband,
decided to take the veil. So fixed was her whole being upon contact
with the other world, that she neglected the barest necessities of
this. After her novitiate, she gradually sank. And ultimately
followed her daughter to eternity, regretted by the whole populace
of the city. The story of the prostitute indicates the whole tenor
of Byzantine society. That society was one in which practice of the
true Christian ideal was possible; not of a tithe to the poor or
the turning of the other cheek; but of the sympathy for others, of
the understanding into fellow beings born of the Greek instinct to
scatter the pretensions of one man above another. The nauseating
moral hypocrisy which distinguishes a woman who gives her body for
pleasure from one who does so for bread did not govern
Constantinople. While the prostitute had a soul, she remained
within the pale of human fellowship; the world did not avert its
cognizance of her. And this raises the whole much-discussed
question of Byzantine character and morals. It may be that the
rigid standard of purity enforced both by law and public opinion
under the iconoclasts was exceptional; that in another age
Constantine VI's divorce would not have forfeited him his throne.
But there can be no doubt that behind the rebukes administered to
profligate Emperors by subsequent Patriarchs, the real force lay in
popular disapproval. The question is not one of comparison with the
contemporary West, with the harems of Frankish kings or the
state-run brothels of London; but of judgment by modern standards.
The Byzantines could be cruel and unscruplous; but scarcely more so
than Irish cattle maimers or those who burn negroes alive in the
southern United States. If the worst aspects of their character
were sometimes intensified, it must be remembered that during the
eleven hundred years of its existence, the Eastern Empire was
scarcely ever free from the danger of invasions which, should they
have succeeded, must have destroyed it utterly; that over long
periods the capital itself was beset by terrific forces; that its
first capture was the outcome of Western devilment such as had no
parallel in the whole of Greek history; and that during its last
two and a half centuries, throughout the lives of eight generations
from father to son, the Greek Empire was fighting not for its
boundaries, but for the being of its civilization against the
threat of barbarism.</p>

<p>For eight generations, from the cradle up, every Greek child
knew that the extinction of all that made life livable, of freedom,
faith, art, and learning, was drawing nearer. "[<i>Greek
characters</i>]&mdash;it had to be." But he learnt also to combat
it by every means that ingenuity could devise. And if, in this
necessity and under this unceasing strain of nerves from birth to
death, his principles were not those of an Anglo-Saxon gentleman,
who shall blame him? As for his morals, it is hard to think that
they could have been worse than those of our whitest men. For he
had a Christian ideal; and we are only snobs.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>As the days move along, in palace, town, and country, sped by
the amenities that only civilization can offer, their survey is
incomplete without thought as to the actual appearance of these
people. The hero Digenis Akritas was fair, with skin of snow; it
was these attributes, in a world of dark people, that added to his
romance. For miniatures and frescoes depict the Byzantine Emperors
as swarthy men, adorned, after youth, with tapering beards and long
black hair. Some exhale the effrontery of the camp, some the
mysticism of ascetics; others, in their whiteness, a venerable
sanctity. Of the great Emperor, Basil II Bulgaroctonos, there
survives a warrior portrait, showing legs planted apart, beneath a
kilt, in tall pearl-embroidered boots; a corselet, sword, and
javelin; together with a squat, square diadem, having pendent
airings of jewels at either side. But for the most part, the
Emperors and Empresses stand, crowned and rigid, beneath straight
metal-woven robes reaching to the floor. "The imperial diadem, or
tiara:" wrote Anna Comnena, "was like a semi-spherical
close-fitting cap, and profusely adorned with pearls and jewels,
some inserted and some pendent; on either side at the temples two
lappets of pearls and jewels hung down on the cheeks. This diadem
is the essentially distinctive feature of the imperial dress. But
the coronets of the Sebastocrators and Caesars are but sparingly
decorated with pearls and jewels, and have no globe." Over all the
Byzantine portraits that survive, there fleets a strange unlikeness
to familiar human form, dissimilarity which is the result of more
than mere formalization, such as that to which the kings of the
medieval West were also subject. The Byzantines, educated in the
hollowness of naturalism, saw their fellows not in the classical
light, as versions of the ideal body, but as harborers of a
divinity ever straining loose from the restrictions of flesh and
blood. Can it be that by the same assimilative psychological
process which molds the body to the shape of fashion, the Byzantine
frame assumed an elongated non-earthly appearance? The monks of
Byzantine monasteries today preserve the same tradition.</p>

<p>One of the first impressions recorded by Benjamin of Tudela was
that, by the standards of the West, all the inhabitants of
Constantinople were arrayed as princes. Nowhere in the world, save
perhaps in China, has the magnificence of clothes surpassed that
which prevailed in Constantinople before the thirteenth century. Of
the robes embroidered and woven with metal thread, and the
patterned silks valued beyond price, sometimes even signed and
dated; of the scarlet of the Emperor and the lilac of his brothers
and the Patriarch; of the blue of the other princes; each assumed
by the Emperor as fancy or ritual prescribed; of the woven
insignias of rank and office: the sovereign eagles and crosses; the
roses of the patriciate; the ivy leaves of magistrates; of the
embroidery with jewels, which caused the Emperor Isaac Angelus to
be described as "decked like a shrine;" and in which the Latin
Emperor Baldwin sought to validate his claim to the East Roman
throne; ivories, enamels, and miniatures convey but a faint version
of the gorgeous reality. Each pattern was a symbol, corresponding
to the epaulette or chevron of today. And the problem of their
meaning raises also that of Byzantine heraldry of the symbols of
the state itself. The <i>labarum</i> of Constantine, the Chi-Rho
surmounting portraits of the reigning sovereigns, continued to lead
the Byzantine armies through their most glorious campaigns. And the
eagle inherited from Rome descended not only to the last Christian
Emperors of Constantinople and Trebizond, but, as a mark of his
temporal power, to the Ecumenical Patriarch, by whom it was not
relinquished until 1923. Under the Palaelogi, however, though the
Emperor Andronicus II of that family appears to have adopted as his
badge the "lion rampant, crowned and holding an upright sword,"
till recently to be seen on a wall of the harbor of Koum Kapoussi,
the device of the throne was the cross and four B's, of which the
legend is supposedly: [<i>Greek characters</i>].</p>

<p>Examples of this may be seen on the imperial galley in
Filarete's bas reliefs to the doors of St. Peter's, where it is
accompanied by other armorials; on an inverted shield in the
courtyard of the church of the Panaghia of Souda in Constantinople;
and as a pennant on a piece of pottery unearthed by the expedition
of the British Academy in 1927. And it is presumed to have been in
imitation of this, that the Serbs and Montenegrins adopted their
cross and four C's to stand for: <i>Samo Sloga Srbina Spasova</i>.
Pero Tafur asserts that the royal arms before the fall of
Constantinople to the crusaders were "cheeky;" since he himself,
being descended from a Greek royal prince who had taken refuge in
Toledo, still bore them; and that these could "still be seen on the
towers and buildings of the city, and when people put up their own
buildings they still place the old arms upon them." To his
enquiries on the subject, the Emperor John VIII replied that the
sovereign (Michael Palaeologus) who had delivered Constantinople
from the Latins "could never be prevailed upon to relinquish the
arms which he formerly bore, which were and are two links joined;
but that the matter was still being debated between himself and the
people." Can "two links joined" signify a Byzantine B?</p>

<p>With Western chivalry came new fashions, causing the Nicaean
Emperor John III Vatatzes to express his disapproval of Latin
garments on patriotic grounds. But even in poverty, Byzantine dress
retained its distinctive splendor to the end, arousing the
admiration of the Parisians upon the visit of the Emperor Manuel II
Palaeologus, and rendering the Palaeologus hat, with its high
ribbed crown and peaks before and behind, an artistic convention
throughout Europe for the depiction of unfamiliar potentates. A
curious mystery surrounded the last Emperors of the East in the
eyes of the awakening West. The sovereignty of Trebizond became a
clich&eacute; among dramatists to denote dominion over the other
ends of the earth. And a detail of its owners' dress has also
descended, to invest them with a reality which their contemporaries
almost denied. Clavijo, sailing the Black Sea on his way to
Samarcand, describes the Emperor and his son as wearing "hats of a
very high shape, which had cordings of gold running up the sides
with a great plume on the top made of crane feathers; further these
hats were trimmed with marten fur." But the climax of astonishment
was reached on the occasion of the Council of Florence, when, for
two years, the north of Italy was traversed by the retinues of
Eastern Christendom. Of the impressions of contemporary artists,
the most famous is that of Benozzo Gozzoli in the Riccardi Palace
at Florence. But this was not painted till twenty years later, and
the headdress of the Emperor John VIII bears no likeness to
anything that was ever seen in Constantinople. It is in the
frescoes of Piero della Francesca at Arezzo, and on the bronze
doors of St. Peter's at Rome by Filarete, that the astounding
costumes of the later Byzantine court are truly represented, in
works almost contemporary with their advent. At Arezzo, the army of
Heraclius, fighting to regain the Cross from Ctesiphon, is clothed
in the uniforms of eight centuries later, which are strangely
reminiscent of those which the Turks eventually adopted from the
Greeks and which are now preserved in St. Irene at Constantinople.
On the doors of St. Peter's a series of scenes depicts
successively, the departure of the Emperor John VIII Palaeologus
from Constantinople in a galley armed with many rowers and flying
the imperial eagle; his reception by the Pope, before whom he
kneels, while an attendant carries the familiar hat; a sitting of
the actual Council, where he is absorbed in thought; and his
departure and re-embarkation for the East again. During these
proceedings, Pisanello, it is thought, must have achieved actual
communication with the Emperor. A more convincing proof of this
than the medal reproduced on the next page is a drawing by that
artist in the Louvre which depicts, with an exquisite suggestion of
modeling, the same man in the same hat as shown on the medal.
Posterity could have desired no more vivid memorial to the type of
Byzantine aristocracy. Beneath the long, delicately built nose,
appear the full lips of an ancient Greek statue, yet expressing, in
place of the implied vacuity, great sensitiveness combined with an
almost mystical impassivity. It is a type that strikes the extreme
of contrast: with the facial coarseness of the contemporary Italian
nobility who were Pisanello's chief patrons.</p>

<p>In the case of women, the arts of the Byzantine toilet were not
far removed from those of the twentieth century. The Empress
Theodora, whose past is still the subject of eternal witticism,
slept late and bathed for her complexion's sake. While the blonde
Empress Zo&euml;, who could attract a third husband to share her
throne at the age of sixty-two, discarded the imperial robes for
lighter draperies and passed innumerable hours in a bedroom fitted
like a laboratory with cosmetics and scents. Such practices were
viewed in the West with horror. The Byzantine ritual which
Theophano, daughter of the Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas and wife of
Otto II, introduced into the Holy Roman court, alienated both
Germans and Romans from her son, Otto III. And Venice, mirror, if
any, of Byzantine custom, was scandalized by the diabolical
innovations of the Greek Dogaressa Selvo. She wore gloves. She ate
meat, carved by eunuchs, with a golden fork. Her complexion was
artificial; her body wasted with perfumes and toilet waters. At
length, as a just retribution, she died abandoned by all.</p>

<p>The traveler Bertrandon de la Broqui&egrave;re, courtier of the
Burgundian Duke Philip the Good, has left a portrait of the last of
the Greek Empresses to reign in Constantinople, Maria Comnena,
sister of the Emperor Alexius IV of Trebizond and wife of the
Emperor John VIII Palaeologus. He had seen her during a service in
St. Sophia; and determining to repeat the experience, waited all
day without food or drink for her reappearance. A fine hack, richly
saddled, was led to a bench, whence the Empress mounted behind the
screen of an outstretched cloak, and seated herself astride.
Attending her were a body of eunuchs, a few elderly courtiers, and
two ladies-in-waiting, likewise riding. She wore a long cloak, and
a pointed Greek hat, presumably of the familiar Palaeologus type,
down the peak of which were fastened three golden plumes. Her face
was painted, "of which she had no need, for she was young and
fair." From her ears hung gold clasps, large and flat, set with
jewels.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>The life of individuals was both reflected in, and the
reflection of, the capital in which they moved, or to which, as
citizens of the Empire, they looked. By position the most
delectable of cities; planted with trees and gardens;
Constantinople, in the days of her prosperity, when the population
ranged from 700,000 to 1,000,000 as it does now, was at pains to
deserve the title of "queen of cities:" which her inhabitants
habitually bestowed on her. Unlike anywhere else in the world, an
organized hospitality was accorded to visitors: free access was
allowed to foreign ships on principles which formed the basis of
the now universal navigation laws; in Justinian's time, enormous
hostelries were built for the shelter of travelers to the capital
engaged in commerce or litigation; definite colonies of foreign
traders were accorded capitulation status; and it may be mentioned
in passing that the mosque which the Latin soldiers so indignantly
burnt, had been built at state expense for the benefit of
Mohammedan residents. Throughout the Middle Ages, Constantinople
was almost the only town in Europe that was lit at night. A regular
system of sanitation augmented the extraordinary natural
healthiness of the place. And to preserve the purity of the air,
rules concerning the height and proximity of buildings were
enforced under the iconoclasts, with a strictness which extended
even to the Emperor's brother-in-law.</p>

<p>The outstanding triumph, however, of Byzantine municipal
organization, was the abundance of its water supply. Water was
brought to Constantinople by aqueducts and stored in immense
underground reservoirs situated mainly in the center of the city
round about or actually beneath, St. Sophia. Fifty-eight of them
are still known to exist, of which only four or five are at present
accessible; and even those have never been archeologically
explored. That which Philoxenus built for the Emperor Constantine
the Great is supported on 224 columns, each twin-jointed and
fifty-four feet in height. The present Yeri-Batan Serai, begun for
Constantine and finished under Justinian, has an area of nearly one
and a half acres. While those under St. Sophia, constructed, after
the unwanted columns of old Byzantium had all been exhausted in the
building of the others, on square pillars of brick, were reported
by Dr. Covel towards the end of the seventeenth century, to contain
water to the depth of seventeen feet, leaving six and a half feet
to spare between the roof and the surface. Similar arrangements for
storing water are found as far as the East Roman boundaries
stretched, and may still be seen, though on a smaller scale, in
such fortified towns as Mistra and Monemvasia. In the case of the
former, which is planned in terraces, almost every house rests on a
vaulted cistern.</p>

<p>The Turkish bath is in reality a direct offspring of the Roman
through the Byzantine; and regular bathing, considered in the West,
until fifty years ago, effeminate and ridiculous, was recognized in
Constantinople as one of the essentials of comfortable living.
Within a hundred years of the city's foundation, eight public and
153 private baths had been installed. In the original treaty with
the early Russian traders, it was stipulated that they should have
free baths while in residence. And there is still extant the
charter signed by the Empress Irene Dukaina to found the convent of
Our Lady of Mercy, in which it was laid down that each inmate
should take one bath a month, and more if the doctor should so
order. In the Emperor John II Comnenus's hospital of the
Pantocrator, every patient was to have a bath twice a week and at
Easter be given an extra allowance to buy soap. And Robert de Clary
speaks of the "<i>paieles d'argent que les dames de le chite
portoient as bains</i>." Similar provision was made for the army.
The baggage of the Emperor in the field contained a kind of leather
suit for vapor baths. And an Arab chronicler of the ninth century
records that at the warm springs of Dorylaion in Asia Minor, the
authorities had constructed indoor baths for the simultaneous
laving of 7,000 men.</p>

<p>The pivot of popular recreation in Constantinople was the
Hippodrome. Sharing the central tableland of the city with St.
Sophia, and topping the declivity of the Great Palace, it completed
the triple symbolism of Emperor, Patriarch, and People at the core
of the Empire. Here was celebrated every manner of public function,
from the triumph of a victorious general to the torture and
execution of a criminal. Here mobs gathered; revolts were hatched
and loosed. Here all the passion of popular leisure was focused on
the chariot races and public games. For us today, witness of the
round world girdled in the white rails of racecourses, and such
words as "Derby" and "football" proclaiming the first stage of
Esperanto, it is not hard to visualize the frenzy that possessed
the Byzantine crowd as it swayed in its seats with the teams. The
town was divided into two factions, of which membership was of
three classes: those who paid annual subscription to the actual
club; the drivers and racing personnel; and the unregistered
masses. Each faction had its president, treasury, stables, stud
farm, chariots, and attendant army of employees and mummers. And
representatives of each occupied a definite place in court
ritual.</p>

<p>The performances were occasions of tense enthusiasm; every
chance was studied, every point of driver and team. The day was
opened with the arrival of the Emperor, to the music of organs and
the hymn singing of choirs. Betting began in the imperial box. For
the ordinary spectator it was perhaps sufficient thrill to belong
to one faction and to watch, on the opposite seats, those of the
other with whom, at the close of the program, he would be engaged
in perhaps a literal battle to the death. As Rambaud says, there
was little reason to regret the savage shows of Antiquity, which
Christianity had abolished. "What gladiatorial combat in the very
heyday of Rome could have equaled that magnificent sedition of
Justinian's reign, when 40,000 bodies strewed the tiers and the
arena of the circus?" This was the Nika, when half the city was
burnt as well. Such a crisis, it is true, has not been engendered
in an Anglo-Saxon stadium. But in a time of civil discontent, what
more probable than that the long-heralded revolution shall march on
monarchy and constitution from between the goal posts of a football
field?</p>

<p>With course of time, the scenes of violence lessened. But
devotion to the horse as an instrument of sport continued to infect
all classes. The aristocracy borrowed from Persia a form of polo,
which they played within the precincts of the palace on a ground
known as the Tzycanistirion. In the ninth and tenth centuries, the
cult of the stable reached its apogee. The Emperor Michael III the
Drunkard, took the reins in the Hippodrome himself; and on one
occasion, to the scandal of sober people, refused to interrupt a
race to receive news of a defeat on the Euphrates. His successor
and murderer, Basil I the Macedonian, hailed from his stable, and
owed his first chance in life to his skill as a horse breaker. He
met his death on horseback from the attack of a hunted stag. The
classic figure of equinity for all time was the Patriarch
Theophylact, who, in place of the humble ass, maintained a stable
of 2,000 horses, fed on fruit, washed in wine and perfumed. The
younger son of the Emperor Romanus I Lecapenus, he became head of
the Church at the age of sixteen, and remained in that position for
twenty-three years: the nearest approach to a Borgia that Orthodoxy
ever achieved. Under his ghostly sovereignty, the anti-Puritan
reaction of the tenth century reached its zenith; he introduced
symbolic dances into the services of St. Sophia, so that, according
to the censorious Liutprand, they came to resemble an operatic
spectacle; and the story is recorded of how the Patriarch, informed
at the altar of the accouchement of a favorite mare, hurried to her
side and was yet able to return to the church in time to take part
in the final procession. He, too, loved hunting. But his joyous
career was cut short by an unmanageable horse against a wall in
956. The Hippodrome remained in full use until the fourth crusade.
In 1111 Sigismund, King of Norway, witnessed the games, which were
accompanied by fireworks, organ playing, and flying men. Fifty
years later, Benjamin of Tudela saw a display of juggling and wild
animals. After the first incursions of the crusaders, jousting and
tournaments were introduced. And according to Clavijo, the place
was by no means derelict at the beginning of the fifteenth century.
The Sultans themselves used it for occasions of public ceremony:
there exist in the library of the Serai miniatures of the Turkish
court assembled in proximity to the three-headed serpent of Delphi.
Ultimately, such portions of it as were still standing were
employed in the construction of the gigantic Sultan Ahmet mosque in
1610, where the original pillars of the sphendone, that appear in
all the sixteenth century maps and drawings, may still be seen in
the courtyard.</p>

<p>In a society such as the Byzantine, much thought was taken for
the sick and destitute. The foundation of hospices and shelters by
the pious rich was as common as of institutions wholly religious.
By such means also the Emperors might win, not only eternal life,
but the more immediately important affection of the people in
addition. And no comparison reveals the West of Europe, right up to
the nineteenth century, in so unprogressive a light, as that of its
charitable organizations with those of the Greek East [*] before
the Turkish Conquest.</p>

<blockquote>[* Their tenor and methods, though but indirectly
connected with charity, survive on Mount Athos.]</blockquote>

<p>The whole conception of charity unsupported by the state was a
Christian one. After the Edict of Milan, the original clandestine
hospital of the early faith spread rapidly over the Levant. The
greatest of them, and prototype of many to come, was founded at
Caesarea in 372. by Bishop Basil, and was as big as a town. There
was a resident staff of doctors and priests; orphans were trained
and apprenticed; and even lepers were admitted. Another form of
public benefit undertaken by private individuals was the
institution of rest houses for travelers, where they might be
ensured food and warmth. In Constantinople, works for the
unfortunate could depend for support on the generosity both of the
state and of individuals. This reached its height in the twelfth
century under the Comneni.</p>

<p>The Emperor Alexius I, second of that family to occupy the
throne, built a hospital on the Golden Horn dedicated to St. Paul,
which is described by his daughter Anna, as a vast medley of
institutions containing every kind of inmate, orphans, blind, and
wounded in war, to the number of several thousand. This example was
followed by his son, John II, whose monastic hospital of the
Pantocrator was as complex an organization as the advance of
science could demand. The smallest regulations for its management
were laid down. Separate wards, each furnished with two lavatories,
were set apart for the different sexes and diseases, the latter
dictating the nature of the heating, which was lit every evening.
Lady doctors attended the female wards. And special inspectors of
the food, which was mainly vegetarian, went the rounds every
morning to receive the complaints of the patients. To each bed were
attached floor mat, pillow, mattress, and quilt, the latter being
doubled in winter; also a comb and a vase de nuit; while for the
preservation of general cleanliness, brooms, and sawdust were
prescribed. Arrangements for washing were elaborate. Each patient
had the use of sponge, basin, and slop pail; and in each ward was a
copper basin at which the doctor might cleanse his hands before
proceeding to the next. For the biweekly baths with their paschal
soap,[*] two each of face towels, hand towels and bath towels were
provided. Attached to the hospital were dispensary, kitchens,
bakery, and wash-house. A special herbalist was installed, together
with a professor of medicine for the instruction of new doctors.
There was also a machine for the cleaning and sharpening of
surgical instruments.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Chapter 10, pages 263-264.]</blockquote>

<p>Certain additional details of administration emerge from the
rules of the hospital adjoining the convent of the Redemption of
the World, founded by the Sebastocrator Isaac, a younger son of the
Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. Each pillow was stuffed with wool; and
each patient had his own plate, porringer, and cup. No bed was
allowed to lie empty. Funerals were decently conducted. There were
baths outside for all, which on Wednesdays and Fridays were
reserved for women. These proved of much benefit to the neighboring
residents; though in their case an entrance fee was charged.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>As the thirteenth century opened on Constantinople, the
political barometer, if temporarily depressed, gave no more
alarming hint of impending cyclone than had often been seen before.
Though the Angeli Emperors held power which it passed their wit to
use; though trade was slipping to the Italians and the revenue
proportionately diminishing; though crusaders were established in
the ancient territories of the Empire, and the poise of Europe was
deranged by the mutual detestation of Latin and Greek;
nevertheless, for Greek men and women, the halcyon life continued,
guarding still unsevered the traditions of classical humanism and
the Oriental quest of God. Gold might be less; but the endowment of
the city with public works, churches, and treasures, had reached
the zenith of magnificence. Born to splendor, environed in beauty,
the inhabitants pursued their lives, confident in state and God.
Upon this society, upon the cumulative security of 874 years, there
fell, in the April of 12.04, destruction. The army of the fourth
crusade, diverted from its proper objective by the cupidity of the
Venetians, assaulted Constantinople and took her. The unthinkable
had happened. And the Byzantine state, already in decline, was
precipitated into chaos. When its equilibrium was recovered, the
ballast of political stability was lost.</p>

<p>Much has been written of the fourth crusade. And even those
authors whose understanding of the Byzantines is least, and
contempt for them consequently greatest, have found small means of
extenuating the conduct of the Franks. Robert de Clary, their own
chronicler, cannot but regard the later disasters as just
retribution for the "bad faith they had used towards the poor
people of the East, and the horrible crimes they had committed in
the city after they had taken her." The first negotiations, the
sack of Zara, and the disregard of the papal interdict; the arrival
at Constantinople, the incendiarism which gutted half the city, and
the final capture; the barbarisms of the sack: the destitution of
noble and wealthy Greeks fleeing over the countryside, accompanied
by the Patriarch "without scrip or staff"; the rape of women, of
matrons, virgins, nuns, whom even the Saracens were wont to spare;
the organized plunder, of which the French share, smaller than that
of the Venetians, amounted, according to Gibbon, to "seven times
the annual revenue of the kingdom of England"; the calculated
sacrilege: the loading of church plate on mules brought to the very
altars; the violation of the imperial tombs; the caparisoning of
horses in sacred vestments; the enthronement of a prostitute in the
patriarchal chair of St. Sophia; from first to last, the
transactions were such as to leave the Byzantines incredulous at
the wickedness of them, and inexorable in their unforgiveness; and
to reveal to a judicial posterity, how frail the hold of
Christianity on the grim medieval populations of the West. Plunder
and women, in the fever of assault, we could all enjoy. In a
freebooting age, which of us, had the richest city in the world
suddenly appeared as though by magic on the horizon, might not have
been tempted to the attack? But the long-engineered plot, the
constructed immorality of rulers assembled in a cause from the
sacredness of which they had not the intellectual attainment to
absolve themselves; the bestial sacrilege of the rank and file; and
the systematic pillage, often for its objects' very holiness,
conduced not in the heat of battle, but when order had been
restored; these place the fourth crusade alone in the annals of
historical crime. Writes Nicetas: "They have spared neither living
nor dead; they have insulted God; they have outraged his servants;
they have exhausted every variety of sin." The repetition of 1453
refuses parallel altogether. And for the Turk, an alien religion
and the Mongol tradition plead comprehensible excuses.</p>

<p>While soldiers were apportioning the piled loot of gold,
warehoused in three churches, others were casting the most renowned
statues of the Ancient World into portable specie. Few tears have
flowed for the icons and enamels, the jeweled gold and silver of
thirty generations of craftsmen, of which a tittle still adorns the
treasury of St. Mark's in Venice. But all the world has lamented
the Helen of Lysippus and the Hercules whose thumb was big as a
man's waist; the wolf of Romulus and Remus; the sphinxes,
crocodile, and elephant with trunk that moved, from Egypt; the
group of Paris and Venus; the Juno of Samos, whose head taxed the
strength of four horses to draw it to the pot; the gigantic Scylla,
with her thighs vomiting "the monsters that threw themselves on
Ulysses's boat to make meal of his unfortunate companions"; the
eagle of Apollonius, through whose outstretched feathers the sun
told the hour on a dial; and even the Byzantine Anemodulion, the
brass obelisk adorned with pastoral reliefs and bearing a
weathercock in the form of a silver woman.</p>

<p>But even more than precious metals, it was the relics of the
holy that attracted the crusaders' cupidity. By the gift of one of
these to his church at home in the West, might each individual
expiate the breaking of his solemn oath not to bear arms against
fellow Christians. For the possession of a sainted bone brought
church or monastery, not only sanctity, but prosperity as well.
Pilgrims would flock to the fame of it, donations swell, and a fee
could be charged for the privilege of its worship. Constantinople,
considered impregnable in a world of growing insecurity, had become
a repository of relics for the whole Levant. A special legislation,
whence arose the Western law of sacrilege, was devoted to their
care. But the savage commercialism which spurred the Latins to
their acquisition so far surpassed the much-ridiculed devotion of
the Greeks as to provoke comment even from a Latin chronicler.</p>

<p>The largest single share of these talismans was apportioned to
Venice. But the whole of Europe was scattered with them, and the
preponderance of towns revised with their advent. The Cross was
rationed by the Latin bishops; the blood and tears which it had
occasioned suffered wide distribution. Amalfi received the body of
St. Andrew; Cluny, Halberstadt, and Amiens, the heads of St.
Clement, St. James the brother of Christ, and St. John the Baptist
respectively. Soissons secured those of St. Stephen and St.
Thaddeus, together with the Virgin's girdle, the robe worn by Jesus
at the Last Supper, and the finger which St. Thomas intruded into
his wound. Single thorns of his crown, already recognized as a
coveted factor in Byzantine diplomacy, were now so widely diffused
that their enumeration and subsequent vicissitudes have occupied a
book. Meanwhile, Latin priests, fired by the exports of the
crusaders to their native countries, were hurrying out to join the
search. The supply of relics only failed to meet the demand, when
the traffic was prohibited by order of the Lateran Council of 1215.
Enough, however, remained of the Crown of Thorns for it to be sent
in pawn to Venice during the reign of the Latin Emperor Baldwin II.
Thence it was rescued by St. Louis of France in 1239, who not only
redeemed its pledge, but paid Baldwin, at that time in Paris, a sum
equivalent to &pound;20,000 for its possession. For five centuries
it remained in the Sainte Chapelle; but was eventually removed to
St. Denys, where it met the Revolution. Even this upheaval sufficed
only to break it in three. The pieces were ultimately discovered in
an empty box in the Cabinet de M&eacute;dailles, and are now in
Notre Dame.</p>

<p>During the fifty-seven years' existence of the Latin Empire, the
queen of cities was as dead. Two generations of Greeks saw their
capital sinking deeper, instead of recovering from, the poverty and
squalor which the conquest had inaugurated. Of the life which the
Franks introduced in the provinces, glimpses abound in the
incongruously familiar fortresses which crown the hills of Greece
and the Asia Minor littoral. But the Greeks refused to assimilate
them; the lords and ladies of the Levant, and their children and
grandchildren after them, remained always foreigners, holding the
tradition of an alien chivalry among the eternal ranges overlooking
the sapphire sea. The romance of two Europes, of failing East, and
West still unformed, surrounds them. They soften to the new land,
to the color of the country and the joy of Greek life.
Simultaneously, they form a school of knighthood, so that hundreds
flock to climb the cobbled streets of Mistra in the train of a
Villehardouin. As good French was spoken at the court of the Dukes
of Athens as in Paris. To Pope Honorius III, Greece was "the new
France." Yet who, in the light of history, were these Frankish
nobles? They took no root; they brought no peace; they built no
bulwark against the advancing East. At a time when Europe was
beginning most to rely upon it, they had undone the political
structure of the Byzantines forever. They rendered possible, two
centuries later and for four centuries to come, the extinction of a
complementary civilization to that of Western Europe, of the
influence towards perennial happiness of the Greek lands. In
compensation they bequeathed posterity nothing. Let posterity judge
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Nicaea, within her red walls, the threads of the
old days were gathered to a smaller capital. In place of the
Bosporus was a lake, where fish were caught and holidays observed
in the shade of rustling trees. Emperors of royal connection,
competent as their predecessors had been puny, conducted the
administration and the wars of reclamation. And as the Latin state,
born in decline, sank below the horizon, proportionately the star
of Nicaea rose. An ally was found in the West in the person of
Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. This German Emperor, precursor of the
Western Renaissance, had aroused the violent hostility of the Roman
Church by the enlightened culture of his court in southern Italy.
Like the Greeks, he drew upon himself the envy and hatred which
crude medievalism, in the name of religion, ever displayed at the
prospect of a superior civilization. Nowhere could more sympathetic
enmity towards the Papacy be found than in Nicaea. Negotiations
were set on foot, conducted in Greek by Frederick himself. In 1244,
his daughter, Constance, was married at Brussa to the Emperor John
III Vatatzes. Though, in the end, it was one of her
ladies-in-waiting that so captured the latter's fancy that she was
allowed to disport herself in scarlet buskins, the German Empress
attained such influence that, on his accession, Michael VIII
Palaeologus wished to divorce his wife and make her his consort.
Then, in 1261, Constantinople was retaken. And the Empress Anna, as
she was known, finding no place in the new court, forsook the Greek
lands, to die, after many wanderings, in 1313 at Valencia in Spain,
where her epitaph may still be read: "<i>Aqui Ya&ccedil;e Da
Cost&atilde;&ccedil;a Augusta Emperatriz de Grecia</i>."</p>

<p>The vitality of Hellenism had triumphed. And for all but two
centuries longer the Byzantine mode resumed dominion on the Golden
Horn. But with a difference. Though the machinery of the slate was
mended, the former security was gone; with the encroachments of
Turks on the East, Slays on the West and Italian traders at the
center, each day added color to the threat of extinction.
Conditions in the capital were changed. The population that had
fled never came back. Such as remained grew less. The monastic
absorption continued undiminished. And by the beginning of the
fifteenth century, as large an area within the walls was occupied
by fields and orchards as by houses. The churches were refurnished;
the reparations of St. Sophia undertaken on a large scale.[*] But
dilapidation prevailed and, with time, increased. The Great Palace,
though still used after the re-entry, was gradually forsaken for
that of Blachern, situate on the walls at the back of the city,
where King Amaury I of Jerusalem and his suite had marveled at the
baths and stoves and other luxuries in 1171. The old entertainments
were discontinued. For the reception of foreign princesses, laments
a contemporary, "When there is no money, it is impossible to
celebrate the fetes or give the banquets which etiquette
prescribes." At court, many of the jewels are glass, much of the
gold, silver gilt; till even they are gone. Peasant rebellions
against the landowners disrupt the remaining provinces. The
Byzantines are living the epilogue of the Empire in a stricter
fashion, consciously, on a note of sadness. Hellenic patriotism
reverts to old forms. The Emperor, hitherto Autocrat of the
Romans&mdash;[<i>Greek characters</i>], becomes King of the
Greeks&mdash;[<i>Greek characters</i>]. The names of classic heroes
make more frequent appearance. With the exception of a long civil
war, resulting from the loss of power on the part of the central
authority, the capital shows little sign of the generally accepted
demoralization. According to Sir Edwin Pears, "neither in la
Broqui&egrave;re's account nor in that of any contemporary...is
there anything to show that the diminished population was other
than an industrious and sober people."</p>

<blockquote>[* Pero Tafur (see bibliography) says: "Inside, the
circuit is for the most part badly kept, but the church itself is
in such fine state that it seems today to have only just been
finished." This was in 1438.]</blockquote>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Impelled by the Empire's desperate helplessness, there set sail,
at the opening of the fifteenth century, an embassy which took the
last representatives of East European civilization to see the
emerging nationalities of West. The West knew nothing of what lay
dying in the East; the Easterners could scarcely guess that the
West already bore the seed of world dominion. But for us, who
observe the moment inserted between the previous and the
subsequent, there is something elegiac in this final contact.</p>

<p>Throughout the fourteenth century attempts had been made to
obtain help from the West against the advancing Turk. In 1396,
these had culminated in the crusade of Sigismund King of Hungary
and the Comte de Nevers, which was annihilated at the battle of
Nicopolis. Three years later, the Marshal Jean de Boucicault had
arrived in Constantinople with reinforcements. And he was about to
return during a lull in the hostilities, when the Emperor Manuel II
Palaeologus, attended by a numerous suite, decided to accompany
him, in order to seek in person the assistance from outside which
alone could save the Empire.</p>

<p>Scholar, philosopher, letter writer, and soldier, the Emperor
Manuel, adorned with a long and pointed white beard, presented a
fine example of a Byzantine. Leaving wife and children at Mistra in
the care of his brother, the Despot Theodore, he landed in Italy,
whence, after a series of receptions which bear witness to the
prestige which the Eastern Emperor still enjoyed, he arrived at the
outskirts of Paris. Escorted from the bridge of Charenton by z,000
mounted citizens, he was met in state by King Charles VI and the
whole nobility; he was presented with a white horse; and at the age
of fifty-two, attired in a long robe of white silk, woven, it may
be imagined, with the same golden pattern depicted by Benozzo
Gozzoli on the dress of his successor, he vaulted into the saddle
without the aid of stirrups. His stay in the French capital was
diverted by such incidents as the wedding of the Comte de Clermont
and the astonishment caused by the celebration of the Orthodox
service. In a letter to a friend, he describes the difficulties of
linguistic communication and the beauty of the Flemish tapestries
with which his room was hung. After a few months he crossed the
channel, in its proverbial state of disturbance, to England, where
he was received by Henry IV with the utmost magnificence at
Blackheath.[*] The two sovereigns spent Christmas together in the
royal palace of Eltham. And Manuel, in a letter, describes the
island as "a country which one might call another world." After a
month he returned to Paris, where he remained more than a year,
until the arrival of the news of the Turkish Sultan Bajazet's
defeat by Tamerlane. At that he set out posthaste for
Constantinople, fortified by 200 men and the promise of a pension
from the King of France.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Thomas Walsingham's <i>Historia
Brevis</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>The impressions of the Emperor and his suite were later recorded
by the historian Chalcocondylas, whose notices of the nations among
whom they moved seem curiously modern in their application. The
Germans, he says, are the most numerous of peoples, patient and
brave, whose strength, if united, would be irresistible. Their
industry excels in the mechanical arts. The French he describes as
ancient and opulent, esteeming themselves the first of Western
nations. But this foolish arrogance has lately been humbled by the
English. Britain may be considered as one or three islands. In
populousness, power, and luxury, London stands pre-eminent over all
the cities of the West. The long bow and the fixity of land tenure
also attract his notice. But, he adds, with no conceivable
partiality to belie the truth of his countrymen's experiences, "The
most singular circumstance of their manners is their disregard of
conjugal honor and female chastity. In their mutual visits, as the
first act of hospitality, the guest is welcomed in the embraces of
their wives and daughters; among friends they are lent and borrowed
without shame; nor are the islanders offended at this strange
commerce and its inevitable consequences." "Informed," continues
Gibbon, "as we are of the customs of old England and the virtue of
our mothers, we may smile at the credulity or resent the injustice
of the Greek...but his credulity and injustice may teach us an
important lesson: to distrust the accounts of foreign and remote
nations and to suspend our belief of every tale that deviates from
the laws of nature and the character of man." Thus the
pseudo-historian pens, in measured category, as downright a
condemnation of his own work as can ever be devised. And the Greek,
as though under premonition of the future defamation of his people
and the nationality of its foremost detractor, unconsciously takes
his revenge.</p>

<hr><h3><a name="pt2-11"></a>Chapter 11. Battle for Europe</h3>

<p>From the inauguration of Constantinople as the capital of the
Christian world till her fall to the Sultan of the Ottoman Turks
eleven centuries, twenty-three years and eighteen days later, the
Byzantine Empire was unceasingly at odds with nomadic peoples
impelled West by convulsions in their Eastern rear. In the
beginning, while the Hellenistic East held its own, the West of
Europe was overwhelmed. But the mental characteristics of its
conquerors were of an indefiniteness which permitted their
Europeanization. Slowly they settled down to assimilate the remnant
of Roman civilization and to evolve that of the present world.
Meanwhile, within two centuries of their advent, the more immediate
East was launching into a new stride. The East&mdash;denoting, in
common parlance, a temperament and intellect alien to our
own&mdash;had already won a spiritual battle with Christianity over
classicism. It was now to engage on physical ground. From 634 to
1453, Constantinople remained successively the barrier, the salient
and the isolated outpost of the European front. By the time the
last Greek arms were fallen, the last manuscript sold, Europe was
saved. But by what small margin, only those who saw the Turks
before Vienna in 1683 could realize.</p>

<p>Mohammed was born at Mecca in Arabia in 570 CE. The Arabs of the
time were without political or spiritual organization. Christian,
Judaic, and Zoroastrian converts were to be found among them; but
the majority lacked any form of religious expression, either in
ritual or speculation. Mohammed, a mystic, subject to seizures and
spasmodic asceticism, recognized one God in all religions, and
grafted to his teaching such of their principles as filtered over
the desert to his unlettered ear. Immorality and idolatry were
condemned; forgiveness of injuries preached; and a theory of
resurrection, divided between a medieval Hell and a heaven of
complacent women, formulated. Disliked by the Meccans, the Prophet,
at the age of fifty-two, took refuge with a neighboring community
of Judaised Arabs at Medina, of whom he assumed political
leadership. From their influence arose the mosaic spirit of exact
observance, and the identification of civil with religious life,
which were destined to pervade Islam. In 625 began a war with
Mecca. But in Medina, at last, was the germ of an organization. Its
strength grew. By 629, the Prophet could boast as large an army as
3,000 men, which came into first contact with the Byzantine troops
of Syria in the northwest. In 630, he captured Mecca. Two years
later he died.</p>

<p>The Arabs were now aware ofa political focus, whose emergence
coincided with their country's economic decline and their own
consequent impulse towards expansion. The original impetus of Islam
was religious only in so far as its political machinery bore a
religious complexion. Byzantine rule in Palestine and Syria was
detested for its weight of taxation and religious persecution. The
Moslems offered freedom from both. The Arab tribes on the northern
border, deprived by Heraclius, owing to the financial burden of the
Persian war, of their annual subsidies for good behavior, enlisted
themselves in the new community; and in unison the Arabs marched
north, defeated the imperial troops, and, aided by the welcome of
the native populations, became masters of Damascus, Baalbek,
Emessa, Aleppo, Antioch, and ultimately of the Hellenized
stronghold of Jerusalem. Ten years later Ctesiphon was taken and
Persia lay at their feet. Only the Caucasus brought them to a
standstill. Simultaneously, they spread south. Forcing the Greeks
to evacuate Alexandria, they seized Cyprus and built a navy,
defeated the Emperor Constans II on the sea, and besieged
Constantinople every year from 673 to 678. The attacks culminated
in that supreme effort by land and sea of 717, which was repulsed
by the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian. For the time, Islam had found
its limit.</p>

<p>Though troubled by civil war, the Moslem Empire now began to
achieve definite political form. The Caliphate, descended office of
the Prophet as secular and religious chief, became hereditary. And
a system of taxation was applied to Moslem and Christian alike.
Expansion continued along the coast of North Africa, which ended in
the occupation of most of Spain and that immortal skirmish with
Charles Martel in 732, known as the battle of Tours. It was more
than a century later that the Saracens gained their footing in
Sicily and south Italy, whence they were ultimately ousted by the
Macedonian Emperors of Constantinople and the Normans.</p>

<p>Change meanwhile had arisen at the center. In 750, the Persian
Abbasids, champions of a purer and wholly theocratic Islam, wrested
the Caliphate from its Umayyad holders and moved the capital of an
Empire which now extended from the Indus to the Atlantic, from
Damascus to Baghdad. The next eighty-three years were an era of
far-famed prosperity. The Persian conception of absolute
sovereignty reacted on the Caliphate as it had formerly on the
Roman Empire. And it was now that the splendors of the East,
emanating in a stream of cultural and commercial intercourse from
the Baghdad of Harun al Raschid, left their deepest imprint on
Constantinople. But all was not peace. And the tide was not turned
in favor of the Greeks until the campaigns of the Emperor
Nicephorus II Phocas at the end of the tenth century. Even then, a
new force was still to come out of the East.</p>

<p>Islam seemed on the point of disintegration. Its Caliphs had
became pawns in the play of Persian Emirs; it was rent by heresy;
everywhere, independent states were growing. But in the third
decade of the eleventh century, ravaging Armenia and Georgia with
such ferocity that the kings of those countries were obliged for
safety's sake to submit to Byzantine vassalage, came a new race of
terrifying first impression. "They worship the wind and live in the
wilderness...They have no noses. And in lieu thereof they have two
small holes, through which they breathe." Set a Jew [*] to describe
a Mongol. For these were the Seljuk Turks from beyond the Oxus, who
in 1055 delivered the Caliph at Baghdad from his puppet ship and
made him proclaim their leader Sultan. Sixteen years later they
inflicted on the Byzantines the disastrous defeat of Manzikert, and
overran Asia Minor to the very shores of the Marmora, leaving
desolation in their wake and a scattered population of permanent
settlers. But their first great Empire, in which the ferrymen of
the Oxus were paid in "drafts on Antioch," lasted scarcely a
hundred years. By the middle of the twelfth century, the western
themes were reconquered by the Comneni Emperors, and the Turks
themselves had split into innumerable dynamically ruled
communities, who looked to Baghdad as their theoretical center, the
home of science, art, and literature. Even this slight equilibrium
was shattered. In 1258, the Mongol Hulagu, bred in the tradition of
Jenghis Khan, whose armies are believed to have caused the death of
eighteen millions of people in China alone, overthrew Baghdad,
murdering the Caliph and 800,000 inhabitants. The pivot of the
Moslem world shifted to Cairo. Here the Caliphate survived till
1517, when it was transferred from the Abbasids to the dynasty of
Othman reigning in Constantinople.</p>

<blockquote>[* Benjamin of Tudela.]</blockquote>

<p>This first Mongol terror, though it submerged Russia and
penetrated even Hungary and Poland, was ephemeral as that of
Tamerlane. Two years after the capture of Baghdad, the hitherto
invincible hordes were defeated in open battle by the Mameluke
Sultan of Egypt. Their history henceforth lies in the north of the
Eurasian continent. In the Levant, for the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, the balance between East and West hung as before:
between Greek and Turk. It was the advent of the Turk that had
saved the immediate East not only from Byzantine encroachment, but
from that of the Frankish crusaders in addition. But the Franks had
stabbed their fellow Europeans in the back. And had the Mongol
advance reached Nicaea, the rallying point of the Greeks, while the
Latins were in occupation of Constantinople, the East must have
conquered then and there. As it happened, the Mongol incursion so
weakened the divided Moslem Sultanates as to avert the decision of
the struggle for two centuries more.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b></p>

<p>When, in addition to this eternal pressure from the East, it be
recalled that the Slav peoples of Russia and the Balkans to the
northwest constituted a menace scarcely less persistent, it is not
surprising to discover that, in the perpetually defensive Byzantine
state, war was regarded not as the fortuitous means of advancing
the personal prestige of princes and feudatories, but as a
conscious art, regulated by textbooks and calculated to achieve
communal security rather than individual glory. Certainly the
spirit of chivalresque adventure was not always absent; such it was
that fired the exploits of the border wardens and the dashing
campaigns of the Emperors Romanus IV Diogenes and Manuel I
Comnenus. But back of the iconoclasts, of the great generals of the
Macedonian era, of the undefeatable Nicaeans and of the last of the
Palaelogi, was the modern concept of the use of the state machine
for state purposes. The workings of that primary factor in
Byzantine stability, the imperial defense, deserve some
analysis.</p>

<p>Until the reign of Justinian, the army was organized on the
familiar Roman model; though after the defeat of the Emperor Valens
at Adrianople with the loss of 40,000 men, the supremacy of
cavalry, which was to remain unchallenged till the invention of
gunpowder, was recognized by the incorporation of the mounted
archers of Asia Minor in the imperial forces. But at the end of the
sixth century came a change. The Byzantine entity was
crystallizing, its frontiers becoming consolidated. The mercenaries
were discarded. Henceforth, the armies of the Empire were recruited
from within its confines. They fought not for gain, but for Christ,
Emperor, and civilization. For five centuries, until Manzikert,
they remained to all intents and purposes invincible. And although,
after the ravaging of the Asiatic themes, the hire of foreign
troops was again necessary, the principles of the system endured to
the end.</p>

<p>The numbers of the standing army, from its reorganization at the
beginning of the eighth century till the invasion of the Seljuk
Turks at the end of the eleventh, varied from 120,000 to 150,000.
Of these, 24,000 were permanently stationed in the capital and
70,000 in Asia. These figures may be compared with those of Britain
in 1914, when the strength of the regular army was 162,251, and of
the British troops in India, 77,500. Foreign expeditionary forces
numbered from 5,000 to 20,000. As with ourselves, in the heyday of
the Empire, military service was voluntary. To the Greek, civilized
individualist, universal conscription was detestable. In this lay
the crux of the whole problem. Byzantine history might be written
in terms of the struggle between its avoidance and necessity.</p>

<p>At no time, however, was the burden of defense wholly
centralized. The troops of the different themes, varying in number
from 8,000 to 12,000 infantry and 4,000 to 6,000 cavalry with the
size of each, were charged upon their respective inhabitants. They
were divided into brigades, regiments, companies, and platoons,
commanded by officers corresponding to those of a modern European
army. Proficiency with bow and javelin was encouraged in all ranks
of society. And there existed some sort of organization
corresponding to a provincial militia. But as a general rule the
obligation to bear arms was commuted by payments in kind and money
on a scale that may be judged by the record of the Peloponnese in
935. That district, in addition to the &pound;4280 in bullion
mentioned in Chapter 7, page 150, contributed in lieu of individual
service, a thousand horses saddled and bridled, of which, apart
from private persons, the Archbishops of Corinth and Patras gave
four apiece, the other bishops two, and the monasteries two or one
according to their means. The monetary tax, for the poor, was
reduced by half.</p>

<p>The army was recruited mainly from the small yeoman farmers,
whose absorption by the larger proprietors was forbidden under the
iconoclast and Macedonian Emperors by special legislation.
Superficially, its outstanding feature was the fact of its being
uniformed, in accordance with the Roman system, which was not
reintroduced into Western Europe till the sixteenth century. The
armor of a trooper consisted of a mail shirt stretching to the
thighs, steel shoes and gauntlets, and a steel cap supporting a
tuft which matched, in the color of the regiment, a pennant, and a
linen surcoat. Each was armed with bow and quiver, axe, broadsword,
and dagger. Such as could were recommended to bring servants and
camp followers with them, to relieve them of chores and ensure the
smartness of their turnout. Importance was attached to morale.
"If," says a military treatise of the tenth century, "they are to
sally forth, joyous of soul, brave and content of heart, to risk
their lives for our holy Emperors and the whole community of
Christendom," soldiers must be accorded special privileges above
the ordinary citizen, and immunity from taxation. In later years
the encroachments of the aristocracy were resisted by the grant of
land tenures for life to distinguished soldiers. These, as in the
West, frequently became hereditary.</p>

<p>A large tactical literature existed for the regulation of the
army's movements. Its aim was defense; its basic principle, to save
men and money by the cunning employ of ambushes and night attacks,
and the knowledge of different enemies' peculiar weaknesses. It was
a maxim, for example, that the Frankish knight was invincible when
mounted, but helpless on the ground, owing to the weight of his
armor; aim, therefore, should be directed against his horse.
Similarly, Orientals, being susceptible to the cold, should be
attacked in bad weather. The Franks complained of the Greeks'
duplicity. Yet in the military handbooks of the latter, the
violation of treaties, the rape of female prisoners and the
slaughter of noncombatants was forbidden; and to these rules the
Byzantine armies, with few exceptions, adhered. Those of the Franks
did not.</p>

<p>The frontiers of the Empire were guarded by a series of forts,
which were strung by Justinian "from Tunis to the Euphrates, and
Armenia to the Danube." These, in case of attack, were connected,
through concentration camps, with the headquarters of the theme and
ultimately the capital, by a regular system of communication, of
which the fire telegraph was an example. The auxiliary forces of
the army in the field were organized with an elaboration unknown
till comparatively modern times. The mounted members of the
ambulance corps could earn a fixed reward for each seriously
wounded man brought off the scene of battle to the military doctors
at the base. The commissariat marched with the infantry, bringing
biscuit, cooking pots, spades, and pickaxes in carts. Camps were
always pitched behind trenches, the carts being disposed so as to
form a kind of "laager" in the middle. There was also a special
section of engineers. "For the passage of broad rivers, where a
Western army would have been forced to march until a ford was
reached, the Byzantines constructed sectional boats, of which the
numbered parts could be borne on the backs of transport animals,
and then put rapidly together and caulked when the stream was
reached."[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* Baynes, <i>Byzantine Empire</i>, page
151.]</blockquote>

<p>This efficiency reached its climax on occasions when the Emperor
himself took the field. His dining tent and his sleeping tent, two
of each, to precede him on alternate days, and furnished like the
palace to which he was accustomed; his stoves, water heaters,
chandeliers, and candles; his medicines, massage unguents,
perfumes, and sweet-burning pastilles; his table linen, uniforms,
underwear, arms, and insignia; his silver clock and writing
parchment; his chapel and icons; his travelling library on war,
weather, portents, and religion; his oils, wines, vegetables,
cheese, salt, fish, and caviar, with their animate complement of
sheep, cows, goats, geese, and chickens, assisted from the rivers
by a band of skilled fishermen; all the necessities of imperial
travel, down to the very water beakers for the chickens when on
horseback, are enumerated in the <i>De Ceremoniis</i> of
Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. For the transport of the whole,
685 horses and mules were requisitioned, partly from the imperial
farms, partly from the clergy, the monasteries, and the
functionaries of the court. An extraordinary care was lavished on
these favored beasts, who could only enter the imperial service
between the ages of five and seven. Each one, branded with the
royal mark, was caparisoned in scarlet and furnished with a
separate groom, who must produce a marked check to procure its
evening ration. Medicines of wines and vinegar, resin for saddle
sores, feeding bags, buckets, and shovels were among the regulation
equipment. And a special inspector was appointed to see that each
was properly rugged at night and was not overloaded in the morning.
Animals too old or ill for further service were put out to grass in
the royal paddocks till their death, "according to very ancient
usage."</p>

<p>It is not to be thought that these imperial peregrinations were
conducted with those galaxies of mistresses and unblushing
preference of diversion to business, which characterized the
campaigns of Louis XIV. Once in enemy country, the routine changed;
the officials of the palace gave the custody of the Emperor's
person into the hands of picked guards; and the greater part of the
baggage was discarded. Nothing can better illustrate the
astonishing mobility of the Byzantine forces and the efficacy of
their care of animals, than the famous march of the Emperor Basil
II Bulgaroctonos from Bulgaria to Aleppo in the midwinter of
994-995. With 40,000 men, of whom 17,000 were actually with him on
arrival, he traversed the diagonal length of Asia Minor in a
fortnight. The whole force was mounted on mules picked for their
swiftness, each man having a second beast in reserve.</p>

<p>The prowess of Byzantine arms was not confined to the land. And
the initial barrier with which they confronted Islam after the
beginning of the eighth century was largely a naval one. In this
sphere, the evidence of contemporary and subsequent chroniclers
shows that the recent invention of "Greek fire" had revolutionized
warfare scarcely less than did gunpowder 700 years later. This
weapon, whose secret even the Church conspired to defend by the
formulation of anathemas against its potential betrayer, consisted
of an inflammable liquid projected through a series of directable
tubes, and lit either by the agency of some slowly burning
substance at their mouth, or by direct contact with the air. In the
fleet which the Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas led against the
Saracen pirates of Crete in 960, 2,000 battleships were armed fore
and aft with these siphons, as the tubes were called, protruding
from the mouths of metal beasts. In vain might the enemy ships
erect screens of metal and keep their decks piled with sand in
readiness to quench the flames. Not less devastating than the
actual damage, was the moral effect, to which Mussulman and Latin
alike have testified. The reputation of Greek fire was prodigious;
it was said to burn in the water and to consume whole battalions of
men; the Russian besiegers of Constantinople in 941 jumped into the
sea to sink in full armor rather than face it; by its agency were
counteracted the mines of Bohemond of Antioch at the siege of
Durazzo in the reign of Alexius I Comnenus; on occasions its
employment was accompanied by detonations; and the fumes could be
such that day became night. Another method was to launch it upon
the enemy decks, or the defenders of a beleaguered town, in huge
metal cauldrons, which exploded, as they travelled, into clouds of
liquid flame. It was also used, on a smaller scale, in "hand
siphons" and glass or metal grenades.[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* An Arab MSS. in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale
shows a battleship armed with pots of Greek fire. And a book in the
Biblioth&egrave;que d'Arsenal, written for King Louis XI, contains
an illustration of a siege of Constantinople, in which one of the
defenders is holding a funnel-mouthed pipe about five feet long,
whence flames are protruding.]</blockquote>

<p>The ultimate decline of Byzantine defense was due to no marked
decadence in the national character, but to the loss of both the
military and maritime themes of Asia Minor, whence the personnel of
the army and navy had been mainly recruited. Mercenaries and hired
ships reappeared. And as the resources of the treasury dwindled
throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries so as to preclude
the invocation even of these, the alternative conscription produced
an inevitable lack of discipline. Nonetheless, the nucleus of the
army, shrunk to piteous dimensions, remained to fight to extinction
within the walls of Constantinople. There we may smile to the last
upon Gibbon's grotesque dictum, that "the vices of the Byzantine
armies were inherent, their victories accidental." And thither the
scene shifts.</p>

<p>During the early stages of a struggle in which 1453 was one
climax and 1922, another, religious fanaticism, on the Asiatic side
at least, was unknown. After the eleventh century, when the Seljuk
settlements in Asia Minor were an accomplished fact despite their
temporary reincorporation in the Greek Empire by the Comneni
Emperors, friendly intercourse with Mohammedan neighbors became a
voluntary principle of Byzantine policy. The Greek populace even
attempted to defend the mosque of the Saracen merchants in
Constantinople from the ferocious bigotry of the Latin knights.
Furthermore, the dominance of Islam in western Asia was yet by no
means wholly assured. The Tartars, who were at the root of all the
Westward migrations, had no religion; but Jenghis Khan was married
to a practicing Christian; and many were the tales of Prester John,
the great Christian ruler of the Mongolian plateau, whose legend,
though never historically identified, illustrates the scope and
influence of Nestorian Christianity. Even among the original
Turkish invaders, the channel of faith was still in balance between
the Son of God and his Prophet. A few years after the recapture of
Constantinople by the Greeks, a neighboring Sultan, in response to
a popular outcry against the Patriarch for having permitted Holy
Communion to his children, and to himself the use of a Christian
bath, officially offered to eat the flesh of the pig in order to
demonstrate his non-adherence to Islam. The religious
<i>&eacute;lan</i> of Mohammedanism developed only after the
political decline of the Christian state with which it was
primarily in conflict. Uncommercial; agricultural only from
hand-to-mouth necessity; instinct with no desire for settled
institutions or the acquisition of property; heedlessly
destructive, yet fundamentally hospitable and honest; the Turkomans
who first came knocking on the diminishing boundaries of the
Empire, differed in no essentials from the dying race we see today,
laced bodily and mentally into the frock coat and bowler hat of the
inevitable West. Only intermediately were they missionaries. And
with this vocation they were not imbued till the accession of the
Sultan Murad I in 1359.</p>

<p>Among the chieftains who took part with Jenghis Khan and his
successors in the Mongol incursions to the West, were some who made
their permanent home with the colonies of Seljuk Turks already in
existence. Of these was Ertogrul, father of Othman, who succeeded
him in 1277, and from whom sprung the Ottoman dynasty and the
Ottoman Empire, the longest-lived Mohammedan power that the world
has known. The reason for its endurance is plain. The Ottoman
Empire was the Byzantine Empire, identical in geography; but with
this difference: that with the expansion of the Byzantine marched
civilization, and with the expansion of the Ottoman, its negation;
that with the diminution of the Byzantine, civilization
disappeared, and with the diminution of the Ottoman, another, its
affinity, advances. The living heart of the Byzantine state was the
city of Constantine; and from this source also circulated the
cohesive strength of the Ottoman. Without Constantinople, the vast
dominions of Murad II and Bajazet were fluid and ephemeral as the
Tartar lordships. With her, with the ineffaceable tradition of
Roman stability conferred, the hapless organism assumed the dignity
of Empire. Supported by a bureaucratic and military organization
directly borrowed from the Greeks, with whom the Turks had been in
immediate contact for two centuries before the fall of the capital;
with the elite of its army recruited from the sons of Christians;
with its rulers bred and suckled by their daughters; the Ottoman
Empire stood. But from 1453 on, the Turk, nomad and countryman,
lover of horses and gardens, was fettered to a town. The revealed
precepts of his religion, its boundless arrogance and condonation
of wholesale sexual license, to the detriment of male character and
the extinction of female; these, titillated by the most delectable
environment that earth could furnish, called to the surface that
latent inertia which a life of mobility had formerly counteracted,
and which should henceforth prevent him, for all his political
effect, from contributing one grain to the general convenience of
mankind. Like a new tree in a forest, which shades and stifles all
the others with the quickness of its growth, then decays itself
from the richness of the soil, he was made and unmade by
Constantinople. But the world still waits his 1453.</p>

<p>With the advent of Othman, the surviving outposts of Greek life
on the Asia Minor littoral began to disappear. Migration from the
central East was increasing. Forcing himself as suzerain upon the
scattered Turkish principalities already existing, Othman assumed
the title of Sultan. His advance westwards was contested; but in
every engagement the Byzantines, who had vainly looked forward to a
new era of prosperity following the regaining of their capital,
were helplessly outnumbered. In 1306, at the invitation of the
Catalan mercenaries who had turned against the Emperor Andronicus
II Palaeologus and were ravaging Thrace and Greece proper, the
subjects of Othman made their first crossing into Europe. Two years
later they captured Ephesus, behind Smyrna, whose ruins still bear
the impress of arrogant municipality beneath the brambles and
bulrushes that obscure them. In 1326, Brussa suffered the same
fate, while the young Emperor Andronicus III Palaeologus was away
in the north Balkan fighting the Tartars. A year later, Othman
died. And there at Brussa, on a spur of Bithynian Olympus
overlooking the rich plains of figs and mulberries to the sea, he
and many of his line after him lie buried. He was succeeded by his
son Orchan.</p>

<p>In the same year, after a heroic defense, Nicaea, city of the
creed and former Greek capital, fell also. Yet still there was no
persecution of the Christians. Their religion was respected.
Taxation for them was less under Turkish than Byzantine rule. A
regiment of them fought for the Sultan. And Orchan himself espoused
the daughter of the Emperor John VI Cantacuzene, who was allowed
the free exercise of her religion. But the pressure from behind was
not relaxed, and still the Turks continued to advance. With the
capture of Nicomedia and Angora, land communication between the
capital and the further East was severed. At Orchan's death in
1359, the Turkish rule over Asia Minor was complete. Further, the
Ottoman Turks were definitely a nation.</p>

<p>A crucial point in their development had now arrived. The
successor of Orchan was his son Murad. And it was he who first
imbued his people with that fanatic detestation of Christians,
which was to render odious the future centuries of Turkish rule in
Europe, to contrast them horribly with the enlightened Moslem
civilization that once prevailed in Spain, to vitiate the character
of his nation in the process, and to incise with sharp hatred the
hitherto romantic border between East and West. The taxation of
Christians under Ottoman rule, as opposed to Moslems, was
increased; and the corps of Janizaries instituted by the forcible
recruitment in early childhood of one in every five Christian male
children. The footing of the Turks in Europe was once and for all
established, Adrianople and Sofia were captured, Macedonia, Epirus,
Thessaly, and parts even of the Peloponnese reduced, and the
parodies of Empire set up by the Serbs and Bulgars destroyed. The
Greeks themselves were weakened by a long civil war, whose
disunited factions in face of increasing odds from outside
illustrate the breakdown of the central authority since the Latin
Conquest, and recall the conditions of the War of Independence four
and a half centuries later. The Emperor John y Palaeologus,
rendered helpless by his son's insubordination, was obliged to
proclaim himself the Sultan's vassal. And a final coalition of
Serbs, Hungarians, Wallachs, Dalmatians, and Albanians, was utterly
routed at the first battle of Kossovo-Pol in 1389. But, in the very
moment of victory, Murad was assassinated by a Serb.</p>

<p>Seven years later, Bajazet, Murad's son, met the only real
crusade that the West ever undertook to stem the Turks, at
Nicopolis on the Danube. The Christian army, of 52,000 men, led by
King Sigismund of Hungary, and recruited from every state in Europe
in response to papal proclamation, was almost entirely annihilated.
Budapest was threatened; and Bajazet expressed the hope that his
horses should feed from the altar of St. Peter's. Yet still the
Greeks, despite the inherent vices of their armies, held out, when
all the might of the West was failing. They were assisted by the
fleet of the Admiral Jean de Boucicault, dispatched by the
Venetians and Genoese to aid their merchant communities in Galata
across the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>The fall of Constantinople seemed imminent. And in 1399, the
Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus left for the West on a last errand,
as he thought, to fetch help. The progress of his embassy has been
described.[*] But in 1402 came a respite. Tamerlane's Tartars
attacked the Turkish rear; Bajazet was utterly defeated at Angora;
and his empire was thrown into temporary confusion. Order, however,
was gradually restored by his son, Mohammed I. This Sultan seems to
have felt an almost superstitious respect for the unflinching
resistance of the isolated city. A close friendship developed
between him and the Emperor Manuel; visits were exchanged; and the
latter was left guardian of his younger sons. The eldest, Murad II,
was willing, on his accession, to continue these amicable
relations. But the Byzantines, in opposition to Manuel's advice,
refused. Was it that, with the true resilience of Greeks, they felt
a return of strength? Or that, lightheaded with the strain of their
position, they wished to force an issue? War followed, and a siege,
from which the Greeks emerged victorious. In 1425, Manuel, a great
Emperor in adversity, died.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Chapter 8, pages 179-181.]</blockquote>

<p>The reign of John VIII, his successor, and last Emperor but one,
was devoted wholly to obtaining help from the West by the
unification of the Orthodox and Latin Churches. A glimpse of him
appears out hunting, just prior to his departure for Florence, when
he and the Empress and Pero Tafur with them on horseback "killed
many hares and partridges and francolins and pheasants, which are
very plentiful here." During his absence, the Turks were so far
apprehensive of the outcome of the negotiations, (see Chapter 8,
page 185), that they refrained from attacking Constantinople. In
1430, they had captured Salonica; and the monastic republic of
Mount Athos, to preserve its independence as the ultimate fortress
of a vanishing civilization, had voluntarily admitted their
suzerainty. But in 1442 and 1443, the armies of Murad II were
defeated by an alliance of Serbs, Hungarians, and Poles. A ten
years' truce was proclaimed, which was immediately broken by the
Christians at the instigation of the Roman Church, in the person of
the Cardinal-Legate Julian. At Varna and the second battle of
Kossovo-Pol, all the advantage gained was lost. And the Emperor
John died of the news. A delegation was dispatched to Mistra, where
his brother, the Despot Constantine Dragases, was holding the
Peloponnese. There, in the Metropolitan Church of St. Demetrius,
overlooking the Eurotas valley and the site of ancient Sparta, the
last successor of Constantine the Great received his coronation. In
1448 he reached the capital. And in 1451 Sultan Murad II, to whose
strict observance of treaties even the Greek historians pay
tribute, was succeeded by his son, Mohammed II at the age of
twenty-one.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century had passed its middle year, Donatello was
an old man, Caxton middle aged, Columbus and Botticelli were boys.
Thirty years more and the earth should bear the small feet of
Erasmus, Michelangelo, and Martin Luther. Joan of Arc was dead, and
the Middle Ages with her. Should their complement in the East
survive? Should those attenuated, steeple-hatted Byzantines, born
half spirits, traitors of the classic speech, enter the new heaven
of reason, representation, and revival? In truth the Turks were but
the instrument of righteous evolution. Constantinople, Paris of the
East, was become old-fashioned.</p>

<p>Yet still the walls, fourteen miles in circumference, were
standing as they had stood a thousand years, lapped for ten miles
by the three seas, and overland, across the four-mile base of the
triangle, rising and falling with hill and valley in a triple line:
the hinder 40 feet in height, 14 feet thick, and swelling into
towers 60 feet high at intervals of 60 yards; the next, separated
by a terrace 20 yards across, 25 feet high, with towers at similar
intervals; and then, after another similar terrace, the moat, 20
yards broad, that once had been filled with water regulated by
sluices. Still they stood, and still today they stand, exhibiting
the breaches of the last siege, with Mohammed's stone cannon balls
interrupting the careful lettuce planting of peasants in the
disused moat. 24,000 troops was the number calculated necessary to
man the fourteen miles in case of attack. In 1453, it was computed,
by request of the Emperor, that the Greek combatants within the
city did not exceed 5,000. And the total of the defenders,
including the Italians, was at no time more than 8,000. Without,
lay encamped an army of 150,000 men, supported by 50,000 camp
followers&mdash;almost the entire able-bodied male population of
the Turkish nation. In the Bosporus and the Marmora, rode a fleet
of between three and five hundred, as opposed to "nine galleys and
thirty other ships;" stationed to defend the chain [*] which barred
the entrance to the Golden Horn. Yet on the eve of the final
assault, despite these overweening advantages, despite the fact
that his army was in the prime of its early efficacy, Mohammed was
on the brink of retreat, and was only dissuaded from that course by
the report that his soldiers were one and all in favor of attack.
The fighting quality of the last Byzantines asks no further
testimony.</p>

<blockquote>[* Still preserved in St. Irene.]</blockquote>

<p>In time and the course of things, the city must have
capitulated. But the explanation of the immediate disaster of 1453
lies in two factors: Mohammed's artillery; and the diminution of
the Greek population.</p>

<p>The fall of Constantinople, as became the doyen of Christian
medieval civilization, was the first event of cardinal historical
importance to be wrought by the primary weapon of modern warfare,
gunpowder. Cannon, it is true, had been used in European battles
since Cr&eacute;cy; but rather in the manner of an Eastern
potentate's elephants, to alarm by unfamiliarity, than for the
worth of their damage. The young Sultan now determined to put this
worth to the test. Upon the arrival in his camp of Urban the
Hungarian, who had left Constantinople discontented with the terms
offered by the impecunious Byzantine Emperor, preparations were set
on foot for the construction of such an engine of bombardment as
the world had never seen. Inner and outer mold were beaten of the
finest clay. And there was cast in bronze a cannon 26 feet long, 9
feet in circumference, and 4 feet in total diameter, which was
capable of launching a stone ball 88 inches round and weighing 1200
pounds. Drawn by 60 oxen, supported by 200 men, and preceded by a
band of 200 road menders, its transport from Adrianople to its
emplacement in the Lycus valley, before the walls of
Constantinople, occupied two months. Accompanying it were some zoo
smaller guns ranged in batteries of ten or twenty, among which the
two chief seem to have been scarcely inferior to that described
above. Just as the walls of the Greek capital were without equal,
so were the instruments of Mohammed's attack on them. Bravely the
defenders sought to lessen the impact of projectiles, which no
masonry could withstand, by means of skins, earth, and sacks of
wool. The whole population of the city was called to repair the
breaches with temporary barricades, which the exiguous force within
was still further strained to man. Taking in consideration the
narrow margin of Turkish success, as revealed by the Sultan's final
doubts, it can be said that, but for the artillery, the siege of
1453 must have failed.</p>

<p>A more fundamental weakness of the Greek cause, and one that
must ultimately have proved fatal to it, was the decline of
population. By the fifteenth century, more than half the area
enclosed by the walls of Constantinople was bare of houses. And
contemporary travelers bear witness to the utter desolation,
accentuated by vast ruins, which had overtaken the Balkan peninsula
and Asia Minor. Yet Greek historians record no such wholesale
massacres on the part of the Turks as attended the campaigns of the
Mongols. The only explanation, though a hypothetical one, for this
complete and sudden devastation, is to be found in the plague.</p>

<p>It is only lately that the English chroniclers of the Black
Death have been proved correct, by the examination of manorial
rolls and parish records, in their much ridiculed assertions that
half the population of England was carried off in the years 1348
and 1349. On this occasion alone, Oxford lost two-thirds of her
inhabitants. In the Levant, from 1347, when the pestilence made its
first appearance in the Greek capital, till 1431, the date of its
last, there were nine outbreaks. Apart from a volume of
contemporary evidence concerning the disastrous nature of these
visitations, Muratori, the Italian scholar (1672-1750), computed
that, all told, Constantinople lost eight-ninths of her population.
His authority for this statement is unknown. But in reconciling
Villehardouin's assertions, that in 1204 the city contained ten
times as many people as there were in Paris&mdash;in other words,
considerably over a million&mdash;and that, in the third of the
fires which devastated the city after the Franks' arrival, more
houses alone were burnt than there were in the three greatest
cities in France; in reconciling these with the statements of
Critobulus and Leonard, Archbishop of Mytilene, that the Greek
captives after the fall in 1453 numbered less than 60,000 men,
women and children, Muratori's figure is undeniably corroborated.
For slaves were included in the Turkish soldiers' legitimate booty,
and the 60,000 must be taken as a more or less accurate total of
the able-bodied persons remaining in the city. The Latin Conquest
and subsequent depression of trade must be reckoned with as factors
in the process of depopulation. But even so, it can, and in fact,
must be supposed that the plague, falling nine times on a crowded
town considerably nearer the seat of the disease than England, was
the chief agent. If its effect, despite their nomadic outdoor life,
was the same on the Turks, their ranks would inevitably have been
filled by pressure from the East.</p>

<p>Thus, when, within a year of his accession, the Greeks learnt
from Mohammed's building of the fort of Rumeli Hissar on the
European shore of the Bosporus, that they were destined to a siege
distinct in the calculating patience of its mover from the many
which had preceded it, the position was as follows:&mdash;A
population of not more than 80,000 souls, of whom not 6,000 were
competent to fight, together with a fleet of forty sail, were
called upon to repair and defend fourteen miles of walls against a
fleet of 400 and an army of 150,000; to fight side by side with
2,000 Italians, whom they detested more than the Turks; to witness
the gradual disappearance of their soldiers, the consumption of
their food, and the desiccation of their fortifications at a pace
which they could not retard; and, in the event of inability,
despite these odds, to hold the city, to contemplate the total
extinction of Greek nationality and civilization, of which they
alone remained trustees. Yet that siege lasted fifty-three days,
more than seven weeks. And at the last, not only did the Sultan's
courage, but even the assault itself, waver in the balance.</p>

<p>The tale of that April and May has summoned the attention of
many writers; to the least understanding of them, it has
communicated an emotion which the heroism and suffering of
individuals have never kindled. The gauds of drama, dear to the
historian, shine with an inner light. The struggle of a handful of
people in an isolated town; the suppression of a nationality; the
elegy of a paralyzed empire; such accidents are found in many
chronicles. Here, with conscious deliberation, was conducted the
funeral office of a millennium, of thirty generations of men bent
in one coordinate Endeavour to harmonies the material ideals of
civilization with the search for Reality...We may watch, as the
Greeks watched from their vantage points within the city, the
course of an obsequy, than which no race, institution or faith ever
achieved more fitting:&mdash;the coming of the Turkish army on the
5th of April, and the pitching of the Sultan's red and gold
pavilion; the entrainment of the cannon and the beginning of the
bombardment; the safe harboring of three Genoese ships bringing
reinforcements, which had fought their way into the Golden Horn
through the whole Turkish fleet, with the Sultan cursing aloud from
a horse knee deep in the sea and the beleaguered citizens straining
every prayer and hope on the walls above; the transportation of
sixty-seven Turkish ships, sails unfurled, bands playing and
oarsmen rowing, down a wooden tramway over the hill behind Galata
into the Golden Horn; the failure of the Greek attempt to destroy
them with fire ships, and consequent necessity of extending still
further the thin line of the defense; the growing assaults on the
land walls; the frustration of Turkish mines by the German John
Grant; the calling of monks, old men, women and children to pile
every available substance into the breaches; the non-arrival of
expected help from the West; the chivalrous return of the ships
sent out to seek it; and at last the supreme preparations. On May
the 26th, the whole length of the Turkish camp below the walls was
illuminated. There were feasting and singing; and for two days
more, fasting and preparation for death, broken only by the
herald's proclaiming the three days' plunder that must ensue if the
city falls. Meanwhile, Mohammed in his tent debates whether to
raise the siege.</p>

<p>Within the city, while the adolescent Sultan, sensualist,
student of Aristotle, and ruler of men, takes his final decisions,
it is realized that the day so long and miraculously averted is
approaching; and another sovereign, Constantine XI Dragases
Palaeologus, last of the eighty-eight Christian Emperors who have
ruled the Greek empire of the East, walks the stage as a character
steadfast and unaffected, but colored with a fatality born of
greater events than lie in man's control. It is he who has
persuaded, by personal request, the Italian soldiers to join in the
defense of the city. And his role has been one of mediator between
the Greeks and those Latins who now make tardy reparation for the
fourth crusade. Repeatedly, during the siege, he has been urged to
leave the city by every shade of opinion, to rally aid from the
Albanians and the West. The Italian commander has placed ships at
his disposal. But his answer has been: "What would the world say of
me? Ask me to remain with you. I am ready to die with you." And
invoking the example of the Good Shepherd, he stays.</p>

<p>Monday, the 28th of May, dawns, and the city wakes conscious of
crisis. All day long the bells of the churches clang in dolorous
and irregular cadence, calling to the ramparts; soldiers tramp to
and from their posts; the rest of the world is building up the
breaches. Without the walls is silence. As the afternoon arrives, a
huge procession forms, the epitome of all those innumerable
processions of triumph and despair that have trod the hallowed
streets. Orthodox, Uniate, and Catholic, till this moment rending
one another for the misfortune visited upon the community by an
improperly supplicated God, now unite in the chant of Kyrie
eleison, Lord, have mercy; the relics and icons are brought out;
and with the invocation of celestial aid, hope revives. "Thus,"
says the Archbishop Leonard, "comforted regarding the issue of the
day of battle, we awaited it with good courage."</p>

<p>At the finish of the procession, the Emperor addresses [*] the
assembled officials, nobles and generals, Greek and Latin together.
He speaks, as men have often spoken, of the duty to die, for
Christ, for Greece, and for those most beloved. He speaks of their
city, "the pride and joy of every Greek and of all who live in the
Eastern lands, the queen of cities, the city which in happier times
has conquered nearly all the countries under the sun, and which the
enemy now covets as his chief prize." He speaks of their ancestors,
the Greeks and Romans, "whom we honor, as posterity, if we conduct
ourselves aright, must honor us." He speaks of their faith: "The
Turks have their artillery, their cavalry, their hordes of
soldiers. We have our God and Savior." Himself, he will die for and
with his people. Finally, he addresses separately the Venetians and
Genoese.</p>

<blockquote>[* The two accounts of this address, written
independently by men who heard it.]</blockquote>

<p>Then the Emperor, the court, the generals, and the populace,
enter St. Sophia.</p>

<p>Look while you may. The great church, forsaken in bitterness
since the union of the Churches was there celebrated on December
the 12th last, is open. Once more, and only once more, the marbled
walls, the mosaic vaults, the ambo and iconostasis, the hangings,
the plate, the lamps and the vestments, assist the familiar ritual.
Patriarch and Cardinal, with a crowd of ecclesiastics representing
both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches; Emperor and nobles,
remnant of the once gorgeous and brave Greek aristocracy; priests
and soldiers intermingling; and the crowd of citizens,
Constantinopolitans, Venetians, Genoese; all are here together. For
the last time the Byzantines assemble. They receive the divine
mysteries. Emperor and Patriarch bid public farewell: the temporal
state doomed to extinction and the Church that must live. Then all
go to their posts. And stationing themselves between the first and
second walls, lock the doors behind them, so that retreat is
impossible.</p>

<p>Constantine, accompanied by his friend Phrantzes, at whose
marriage he had in past years stood best man, rides the length of
the city to his palace of Blachern up on the walls to the
northwest, where they begin descent to the Golden Horn. In the
manner of kings, he asks pardon of his dependants. "Had a man been
made of wood or alone," wrote Phrantzes later, "he must have wept."
The night is dark and clouded. A noise sounds from the Turkish
camp; enormous drops of rain herald a storm; then both subside.
After midnight the Emperor rides the rounds. Everything is in
order. From a tower he discerns the sound of muffled preparations.
At length he and Phrantzes separate.</p>

<p>The assault begins before the dawn, between one and two in the
morning. As the dull light filters in the sky, a vast din shakes
the earth: the yells of the attackers to the accompaniment of
cymbals and flutes; the metallic ring of weapons, the boom of
cannon, the tremor of resounding shot; and over all, the church
bells, faster now, calling and calling to the walls. The end comes
with the mortal wounding of Justiniani, the Genoese commander, who
is carried on board ship to die at Chios. A local panic ensues, and
the Turks effect an entry. The cry goes up that they are in. The
Emperor, accompanied by Theophilus Palaeologus, Don Francisco of
Toledo, and John of Dalmatia, gallops to stem the inrush; but
seeing it hopeless, dismounts, throws off the imperial insignia,
and plunges into the combatants, leaving as his last recorded
words, "The city is taken, and I am still alive." The body is later
identified by scarlet boots embroidered with the Roman eagles.</p>

<p>Thus Constantinople falls. The sack, as promised, continues
three days. The plunder of the churches is divided; the libraries
are trampled or sold. A few of the Greeks escape by sea; the rest,
stripped even of their clothes, are roped together like cattle, the
property of the soldiers, to be auctioned in the provinces.
Mohammed enters in triumph and with his own sword strikes the fool
who would injure St. Sophia. A number of illustrious prisoners are
executed. While those of either sex, whose beauty warrants it, are
placed in the Sultan's harems. Silence overspreads the town, a
great emptiness, only to be repaired by forcible repopulation. But
the setting of empire remains. St. Sophia, unchanged even in name,
shelters new worshippers. The walls of Theodosius enclose them.
Still, on those walls, the invocation may be read: "CHRIST O GOD
GUARD THY CITY FROM TROUBLE AND WAR. CONQUER THE WRATH OF THE
ENEMY." But now at last the heavens are deaf. The age of Reason is
at hand.</p>

</p>

<p>Ishe latter Byzantines were no race of heroes, as we understand
heroes. Have they so appeared it is owing to the seeming
superfluity of recapitulating those unending foibles of which
historians have already been lavish in their revelation. Under the
strain of the last years, the faults of the unchanging Greek had
pushed to the surface. Greedy of money, mentally exercised over the
very chaff of theology, seeking compensation for misfortune in
overweening conceit, these men were scarcely average. Even in their
appearance there was something unearthly: the Florentines, at the
Council of 1438, regarded with astonishment their demeanor of
pedantic vanity, their long beards and painted eyebrows, their
flowing mantles, and outlandish hats. Yet their art was fresh;
their religion held no germ of that sinister bigotry which should
characterize the Puritan and Counter Reformations, simultaneous
reactions against a paganism engendered in Italy by writings of
which they, the Byzantines, had always been possessors; and they
had courage. They fought, fought to the last, when, had they
acceded to Mohammed's demands, life and property might have been
theirs.</p>

<p>In two spheres, however, the conquest was not yet complete. In
the Peloponnese, the Despots Thomas and Demetrius Palaeologus,
brothers of the Emperor Constantine, still retained their
independence. The growth of Hellenic sentiment at the beginning of
the fifteenth century had made possible, with the exception of a
few fortresses, the reclamation of the whole center of the
peninsula from the engrafted feudalism of the Latin invaders. And
the organization of the country had been the object of personal
supervision from the Emperor Manuel II. But prosperity was slow in
reappearing; and the prevalent misery and confusion bear witness to
the impotence of the last period of Byzantine administration. In
the writings of Gemistos Plethon, the foremost Platonist of his day
and occupant of a judgeship at Mistra, strange socialist remedies
are proposed for the amelioration of social evils, the oppressive
taxes, debasement of coinage, and maladministration of justice.
Mohammed, busy with the affairs of his new capital, was prepared,
in return for the payment of a tribute and the recognition of his
sovereignty, to confirm the <i>status quo</i>, provided that peace
was forthcoming as a result. Unfortunately, it was not. In each
valley, on each range, the land of eternal feud gave evidence of a
new quarrel. The brothers made war on one another; their subjects
revolted against them. In 1460, after the dispatch of several
subsidiary expeditions, Mohammed marched south in person, received
the submission of Mistra, and reduced the country to some state of
order. We may imagine, some thirty miles north of the Gulf of
Corinth, the Turkish soldiers in the small town of Calavryta.
There, 361 years later, the banner of a small monastery was hoisted
by an Archbishop to proclaim the Greek War of Independence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at Trebizond, on the south coast of the Black Sea, a
last offshoot of the vanished monarchy was represented by the Grand
Comnenus, King and Emperor of all the East, whose eagles were now
the rallying point of Greek disaffection. The nineteen Emperors and
three Empresses of the dynasty founded after the fourth crusade by
Alexius Comnenus, grandson of that Andronicus whom the
Constantinople mob tore asunder in the Hippodrome in 1185, had
reigned two centuries and a half. The extent of their dominion,
which had reached even Georgia and the Crimea, was ordinarily some
7,000 square miles contained in a narrow strip along the shore. And
their capital, since the destruction of Baghdad by Hulagu, had been
famed for its mart of wares from the further East. Venetians and
Genoese, as at Constantinople, had their outposts there; and many
travelers have left passing impressions of the place. An English
embassy of 1293 wore its shoes to ruin on the cobbled streets.
Another Englishman, in the time of Richard II, describes the royal
palace: its marble audience chamber in the form of a pyramid; its
frescoed banqueting hall; and its library of scientific and
historical works. To the city's continued prosperity in the
fifteenth century, the writings of Bessarion, the Trapezuntine
Cardinal, are witness.</p>

<p>In 1456, the Emperor John VI had recognized the overlordship of
the Sultan in Constantinople. The stock of which he came was famed
for its good looks; the admiration of a Frenchman for one of its
princesses has already been noticed;[*] and the Emperor himselfwas
known on this account as Kalo-Joannes. The beauty of his daughter,
the Despoina Catherine, was celebrated from Italy to Persia; and
when Usan Hassan, chief of the neighboring Turkomans of the White
Horde, sent offering "not only his army, but his treasure and his
own person," in case of a struggle with Mohammed, she was
dispatched to become his wife. Their grandson was the Shah Ismail,
creator and first ruler of a united Persia. Meanwhile Kalo-Joannes
had died, and his small son's throne been usurped by his brother
David. The alliance with Hassan was continued; and aid was sought
from Venice, Genoa, and the Vatican. At length, in 1461, Mohammed
lost patience with these intrigues and himself marched on the city,
which incontinently surrendered, while Hassan remained discreetly
in the interior. A third of the population was sent to repeople
Constantinople; a third sold into slavery; and the rest suffered to
remain. The Emperor David, his wife and their seven sons were
exiled to Adrianople, where, two years later, all save the Empress
were strangled. The Despoina Catherine, ruling magnificently in
Asia Minor, did not cease, as long as she lived, to incite her
husband to avenge her family.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Chapter 10, page 261.]</blockquote>

<p>All vestiges of Greek independence had disappeared. Byzantine
civilization was extinct; and, other than that of El Greco, its
future influence, outside the sterile confines of the Ottoman
Empire, was destined to be little. Yet, with the fall of
Constantinople, two countries were most immediately affected. These
were Italy and Russia.</p>

<blockquote>* * * * *</blockquote>

<p>The ancient theory that, with the entry of the Turks into
Constantinople, a multitude of scholars debouched by an opposite
gate to flood Europe with their manuscripts and cause the
Renaissance, is no more. The germs of that movement had already
appeared among the Albigenses and the Hussites, and at the south
Italian court of the Hohenstaufens. But these early symptoms had
been eradicated by the Papacy. And nothing illustrates more clearly
the difference between East and West Europe, than the attitude of
their respective Churches towards the writings of Antiquity. By the
Orthodox, despite spasmodic opposition to Plato, they were
treasured for the most part as a genuine source of spiritual
inspiration; by the Catholic, knowledge of them was held to
discount all hope of salvation. In the latter sphere, the
standpoint of the fanatic of Cordova, who cried: "Let the foaming
and bespittled grammarians belch, while we remain evangelical
servants of Christ," was general; Faust, it will be remembered,
sold his soul to the devil for the learning of the ancients; and if
all Europe had gone the way of the Italians, who in the first
ecstasies of humanistic individualism, reverted not only to
paganism, but to a level of political and sexual immorality that
defies belief, the standpoint of the fanatic might have been
justified. As Symonds says, "The tendencies of the Renaissance were
worldly; its ideal left no room for a pure and ardent intuition
into spiritual truth." The Italians rediscovered the language,
collected the manuscripts. But when, with Reuchlin and Erasmus, the
newfound critical spirit advanced north of the Alps, it passed from
the control of dilettanti into the hands of men whose search for
that truth nothing could divert. The result was the
Reformation.</p>

<p>In the agency of this upheaval, which was to bury the Middle
Ages, to recover in one glorious burst the freedom of man's mind,
and to settle into a degraded sediment of classical imitation, the
part of the Byzantines was no small one. With their language,
something also of the spirit of their society was communicated to
the Italians. National consciousness, in which that people now
excels, was dissolved in the "cosmopolitan ideal of the human
family, one in culture." Distinctions of birth gave place to those
of talent, so that cities and princes contended for the bodies of
scholars, living or dead. All the world was united in a frenzied
search for lost authors, of which the discovery "was regarded
almost as the conquest of a kingdom." Italian officials in the
Levant reaped fortunes by the sale of manuscripts.</p>

<p>The craze began with Petrarch, who died nearly eighty years
before the fall of Constantinople, and whose intuition was the
first to predict that the immediate future of humanity lay with the
knowledge of Greek. This, by his advice, Boccacio acquired.
Meanwhile, Byzantine importunity for Italian aid was increasing. In
1389, Manuel Chrysoloras, friend and correspondent of the Emperor
Manuel II Palaeologus, disembarked at Venice on his way to Rome;
and in 1396, he was induced to accept a Greek chair at the
University of Florence. A passion-filled people: professions and
property were forsaken for the satisfaction of mental cravings by
possession of a language which alone could interpret the dreams
that were in everyone's head. The Council of Florence added to the
stimulus. Gemistos Plethon, the Platonist, who had studied
philosophy not only at Constantinople, but at the Moslem schools at
Brussa and Adrianople, was among the Greek delegates. He it was,
spiritual descendant of Psellos, who revived Plato's vision of God
to attack the ecclesiastically manipulated materialism of
Aristotle. And to him was actually due the revival of Platonic
studies in the West. In 1450, he died at Mistra. And five years
later, just before the reduction of that stronghold by the Turks,
the bones of one so great were exhumed by Sigismondo Pandolfo
Malatesta, and reinterred at Rimini.</p>

<p>A long list of names reveals the Byzantine tutors of the
Renaissance: John Argyropoulos; George of Trebizond; John Lascaris,
who took service with France, became ambassador for Louis XII, and
collected Francis I's library at Fontainebleau; Filelfo, husband of
a Byzantine, who assures us that the noble matrons of
Constantinople spoke the purest Attic; and, in Rome, Bessarion, the
outstanding Greek of the period, who had attended the Council of
Florence as Archbishop of Nicaea, and was created Cardinal by Pope
Eugenius IV. His palace in Rome, after the fall of the Greek
capital, became the center of all fresh agitations for a crusade.
And here assembled many of the unfortunate refugees, among them the
historian, Phrantzes.</p>

<p>Of the two Palaeologus Despots, Demetrius and Thomas,[*] the
former was granted a substantial pension by the Sultan, and ended
his days as a monk at Adrianople; while his daughter, Helen,
entered the harem of the Sultan. The latter, with his wife and
children, had escaped to Italy. As a passport to hospitality, he
brought with him the head of St. Andrew from Patras. A great
reception was accorded this relic by the Romans, which, though
spoilt by the rain on the first day, resulted, on the second, in a
march of two miles on foot for Pope Pius II, and the burning of
30,000 candles. Thanks to the influence of Bessarion, the Despot
received an allowance of 500 <i>&eacute;cus d'or</i> a month, which
was continued, after his death in 1495, to his children. Bessarion
supervised their education, the regulation of their household,
doctors, chaplains, and tutors, and the maintenance of their
servants and horses. His efforts were to little purpose. Andrew, of
whom a portrait by Pinturicchio survives in the Vatican, side by
side with the mounted figure of Prince Djem, a refugee son of
Mohammed II, who had arrived at the Borgia court in 1488 and set a
fashion for Turkish fancy dress, espoused a prostitute and died
childless in 1502, bequeathing his imperial claims to Ferdinand and
Isabella of Spain. His younger brother Manuel returned to
Constantinople, where, thanks to the generosity of Mohammed, he was
able to maintain "a decent harem." There remained, however, a
sister, named Zo&euml;, renowned throughout Europe for her wit. In
1467, Ivan III of Muscovy sent requesting her hand. And the face of
the Russian monarchy was changed.</p>

<blockquote>[* A monument in Llandulph church, near Plymouth,
displays the following inscription: "Here lyeth the body of
Theodoro Paleologus of Pesaro in Italye descended from ye Imperyall
lyne of ye last Christian Emperors of Greece being the sonne of

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Of the influence of medieval Greek civilization on the Balkans,
it is sufficient to say that it was only by the imitation of
Byzantine institutions, the assumption of Byzantine titles and the
borrowing of Byzantine culture, that the conscious nationalities of
Bulgars, Serbs and Rumanians, were evolved and were able to
withstand the extinction threatened by Turkish enslavement. In
Russia, however, the Greek foundations were deeper; the existing
political structure more peculiar; and the complexion of the
resulting edifice so wholly removed from any sphere of comparison,
that even now its effects on the history of the world are
incalculable.</p>

<p>In the ninth century, the missionaries, Constantine and
Methodius, by the invention of the Slav alphabet, had reinforced in
perpetuity the cultural barrier between East and West Europe. This
work was still further assisted by the Orthodox Church in
permitting celebration of the liturgy in the vernacular to the
successively Christianized Slav races. The particular conversion of
Russia was the work of Olga, daughter-in-law of Rurik, the founder
of the Russian state, and of her grandson Vladimir. Olga, who
visited Constantinople in order to "learn about God," was baptized
with the Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus as her godfather.
Vladimir, Prince of Kiev, brought aid to the Byzantine monarchy
during the minority of the Emperor Basil II Bulgaroctonos against
the rebellion of Bardas Phocas; and was rewarded, despite his 300
concubines, with the hand of Basil's sister. At Cherson, whither he
came to meet her, he was baptized on the spot occupied by the
allied trenches before Sebastopol in the Crimean War; and
thenceforth, from 988 onwards, Christianity became the state
religion. Relations with Constantinople were continued; marriages
between the two royal families were frequent; and it was not until
the fifteenth century that Greek bishops ceased to preside over the
Russian dioceses. Only in 1587, was the shifting of political
gravity thought to justify the creation of the Patriarchate of
Moscow, which was extinguished in 17/3 by Peter the Great, and only
reconstituted by the Provisional Government in 1917.</p>

<p>The political unit of early Russia was the city-state. Kiev and
Novgorod, the main centers, were diminutive Constantinoples; their
buildings were designed after Greek models and were often decorated
by Greek artists; their law, the Pravda, was simply a Slav edition
of the digests of the Isaurian and Macedonian Emperors; and their
whole existence was dependent on the maintenance of trade with the
markets of the Greek capital. For the strength of their rule over
the countryside was economic, instead of based, as in the West, on
a feudal land tenure. But, with the Tartar invasions of the
thirteenth century, the growing civilization fostered in the
cities, was driven into the interior to develop of itself; and the
economic basis of the Russian state, divorced from commerce, became
agricultural. During this period, it was only the Byzantine
cultural foundation that saved the Russian identity from total
immersion by the Oriental migrations.</p>

<p>At length, by the end of the fifteenth century, the princes of
Muscovy were loosening their dependence of the Golden Horde. And in
the person of Zo&euml; Palaeologina, henceforth known as Sophia,
there came to them a princess in whom all the character, ability,
and pride derived from centuries of worshipped royalty, had
accumulated. Was not she, whose father and brothers suffered
themselves to remain pensioners of a Pope detested in Russia more
even than in Greece, the inheritor of the Roman Empire? Her
signature, embroidered by her own hands on a sheet in 1498, may
still be read, with the appellation "Tzarevna
Tzaregerodskaia&mdash;Princess of Constantinople" attached. The end
of that imperial line was yet to come, in the house of Ipatiev at
Ekaterinbourg. Disliking the familiarity of the Boyars, she
introduced the ceremonial of her ancestry, the coronation and
reception rites; the bureaucracy, the titles, and the custom of
employing and ennobling foreigners, followed. In 1480, the rule of
the Tartars was finally discarded. The Kremlin, in imitation of the
Great Palace of Constantinople, was built at Moscow. And the Prince
assumed the double-headed eagle and the title of Samoderzetz,
Autocrat, borne for 1,100 years by the successors of Constantine
the Great. All connections with the former Greek capital were
revived, all channels of descent. And when, in the middle of the
sixteenth century, Ivan the Terrible finally adopted the ancient
style of the Emperors of the East, he had his pretention ratified
by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and hierarchy in full
council. Thus was the Prince of Rus, who was formerly honored with
the title of "Table dresser to the Emperor," advanced. Well might
the monk of Pskov write that henceforth Moscow was the third and
final Rome. The Russian claim to the Byzantine inheritance, which
the Europe of the nineteenth century was constrained to dispute,
boasted ancient pedigree.</p>

<p><b>* * * * *</b>
</p>

<p>Yet the true heirs of Constantinople owed their claim not to the
journeys of scholarship and the inflation of barbarous kings. They
remained, in the Levant, among the people who created Byzantine
civilization and its capital. To the understanding of the Greek
entity, this analysis of the Byzantine civilization has been
attempted; and to that end, the history of its inheritors deserves
to be continued. Already, lament for the past was echoing, handed
by mouth from father to son, in the counting houses of foreign
merchants, on the beaches of forgotten islands, amid the craggy
fastnesses of honorable brigands:</p>

<blockquote>The Lord has signified, the heaven and earth have
signified,<br>
And Saint Sophia, that has four hundred sounding gongs and
sixty<br>
And two loud bells with each its priest and every priest his
deacon,<br>
The mighty church has signified, to interrupt the service<br>
When sounds the Song of Cherubims, that Christ the King retire.<br>
A dove is come from out the midst of heaven, bidding muffle<br>
The Song of Cherubims and lower down the holy objects.<br>
"Ye priests bear them away with ye, and candles be ye dimmed,<br>
Since God decrees dominion of the Turk upon the city.<br>
Despatch ye only message to the West, that ships come hither,<br>
A trio, one to bear away the cross, the next the gospel,<br>
And last, the finest of the three, to take our holy altar<br>
Before the dogs can steal it from us and pollute it for us."<br>
And troubled was the Lady Virgin; weeping were the icons.<br>
"Now Lady Virgin, hold thy peace, and icons weep no longer.<br>
Again, with journeying of years, again shall they be
yours."</blockquote>
