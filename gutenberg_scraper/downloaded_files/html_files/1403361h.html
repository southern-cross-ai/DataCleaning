  <p class="quote">B.M. Bower is justly famous for capturing the very spirit of
  the American cowpuncher&mdash;and for telling a swiftly-moving intensely
  realistic tale about him. Here is one of the best of the Bower books.</p>

  <p class="quote">All of the boys at the Flying U did a lot of
  grumbling&mdash;among themselves&mdash;when they heard that the Old Man's
  sister was coming out to spend the summer. They didn't want a woman at the
  ranch, and certainly not one who had just received a medical degree! But if
  they&mdash;particularly Chip&mdash;could have had an inkling of what was
  really going to happen, they would have done more than grumble.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE OLD MAN'S SISTER.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE weekly mail had just arrived at the Flying U ranch.
  Shorty, who had made the trip to Dry Lake on horseback that afternoon, tossed
  the bundle to the "Old Man" and was halfway to the stable when he was called
  back peremptorily.</p>

  <p>"Shorty! O-h-h, Shorty! Hi!"</p>

  <p>Shorty kicked his steaming horse in the ribs and swung round in the path,
  bringing up before the porch with a jerk.</p>

  <p>"Where's this letter been?" demanded the Old Man, with some excitement.
  James G. Whitmore, cattleman, would have been greatly surprised had he known
  that his cowboys were in the habit of calling him the Old Man behind his
  back. James G. Whitmore did not consider himself old, though he was
  constrained to admit, after several hours in the saddle, that rheumatism had
  searched him out&mdash;because of his fourteen years of roughing it, he said.
  Also, there was a place on the crown of his head where the hair was thin, and
  growing thinner every day of his life, though he did not realize it. The thin
  spot showed now as he stood in the path, waving a square envelope aloft
  before Shorty, who regarded it with supreme indifference.</p>

  <p>Not so Shorty's horse. He rolled his eyes till the whites showed, snorted
  and backed away from the fluttering, white object.</p>

  <p>"Doggone it, where's this been?" reiterated James G., accusingly.</p>

  <p>"How the devil do I know?" retorted Shorty, forcing his horse nearer. "In
  the office, most likely. I got it with the rest to- day."</p>

  <p>"It's two weeks old," stormed the Old Man. "I never knew it to
  fail&mdash;if a letter says anybody's coming, or you're to hurry up and go
  somewhere to meet somebody, that letter's the one that monkeys around and
  comes when the last dog's hung. A letter asking yuh if yuh don't want to get
  rich in ten days sellin' books, or something, 'll hike along out here in no
  time. Doggone it!"</p>

  <p>"You got a hurry-up order to go somewhere?" queried Shorty, mildly
  sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"Worse than that," groaned James G. "My sister's coming out to spend the
  summer&mdash;t'-morrow. And no cook but Patsy&mdash;and she can't eat in the
  mess house&mdash;and the house like a junk shop!"</p>

  <p>"It looks like you was up against it, all right," grinned Shorty. Shorty
  was a sort of foreman, and was allowed much freedom of speech.</p>

  <p>"Somebody's got to meet her&mdash;you have Chip catch up the creams so he
  can go. And send some of the boys up here to help me hoe out a little. Dell
  ain't used to roughing it; she's just out of a medical school&mdash;got her
  diploma, she was telling me in the last letter before this. She'll be finding
  microbes by the million in this old shack. You tell Patsy I'll be late to
  supper&mdash;and tell him to brace up and cook something ladies
  like&mdash;cake and stuff. Patsy'll know. I'd give a dollar to get that
  little runt in the office&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Shorty, having heard all that it was important to know, was clattering
  down the long slope again to the stable. It was supper time, and Shorty was
  hungry. Also, there was news to tell, and he was curious to see how the boys
  would take it. He was just turning loose the horse when supper was called. He
  hurried back up the hill to the mess house, performed hasty ablutions in the
  tin wash basin on the bench beside the door, scrubbed his face dry on the
  roller towel, and took his place at the long table within.</p>

  <p>"Any mail for me?" Jack Bates looked up from emptying the third spoon of
  sugar into his coffee.</p>

  <p>"Naw&mdash;she didn't write this time, Jack." Shorty reached a long arm
  for the "Mulligan stew."</p>

  <p>"How's the dance coming on?" asked Cal Emmett.</p>

  <p>"I guess it's a go, all right. They've got them coons engaged to play. The
  hotel's fixing for a big crowd, if the weather holds like this. Chip, Old Man
  wants you to catch up the creams, after supper; you've got to meet the train
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Which train?" demanded Chip, looking up. "Is old Dunk coming?"</p>

  <p>"The noon train. No, he didn't say nothing about Dunk. He wants a bunch of
  you fellows to go up and hoe out the White House and slick it up for
  comp'ny&mdash;got to be done t'-night. And Patsy, Old Man says for you t' git
  a move on and cook something fit to eat; something that ain't plum full uh
  microbes."</p>

  <p>Shorty became suddenly engaged in cooling his coffee, enjoying the varied
  emotions depicted on the faces of the boys.</p>

  <p>"Who's coming?"</p>

  <p>"What's up?"</p>

  <p>Shorty took two leisurely gulps before he answered:</p>

  <p>"Old Man's sister's coming out to stay all summer&mdash;and then some,
  maybe. Be here to-morrow, he said."</p>

  <p>"Gee whiz! Is she pretty?" This from Cal Emmett.</p>

  <p>"Hope she ain't over fifty." This from Jack Bates.</p>

  <p>"Hope she ain't one of them four-eyed school-ma'ams," added Happy
  Jack&mdash;so called to distinguish him from Jack Bates, and also because of
  his dolorous visage.</p>

  <p>"Why can't some one else haul her out?" began Chip. "Cal would like that
  job&mdash;and he's sure welcome to it."</p>

  <p>"Cal's too dangerous. He'd have the old girl dead in love before he got
  her over the first ridge, with them blue eyes and that pretty smile of his'n.
  It's up to you, Splinter&mdash;Old Man said so."</p>

  <p>"She'll be dead safe with Chip. <i>He</i> won't make love to her,"
  retorted Cal.</p>

  <p>"Wonder how old she is," repeated Jack Bates, half emptying the syrup
  pitcher into his plate. Patsy had hot biscuits for supper, and Jack's
  especial weakness was hot biscuits and maple syrup.</p>

  <p>"As to her age," remarked Shorty, "it's a cinch she ain't no spring
  chicken, seeing she's the Old Man's sister."</p>

  <p>"Is she a schoolma'am?" Happy Jack's distaste for schoolma'ams dated from
  his tempestuous introduction to the A B C's, with their daily accompaniment
  of a long, thin ruler.</p>

  <p>"No, she ain't a schoolma'am. She's a darn sight worse. She's a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Aw, come off!" Cal Emmett was plainly incredulous.</p>

  <p>"That's right. Old Man said she's just finished taking a course uh
  medicine&mdash;what'd yuh call that?"</p>

  <p>"Consumption, maybe&mdash;or snakes." Weary smiled blandly across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"She got a diploma, though. Now where do you get off at?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;that sure means she's a doctor," groaned Cal.</p>

  <p>"By golly, she needn't try t' pour any dope down <i>me</i>," cried a
  short, fat man who took life seriously&mdash;a man they called Slim, in fine
  irony.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, I'd like to give her a real warm reception," said Jack Bates, who
  had a reputation for mischief. "I know them Eastern folks, down t' the
  ground. They think cow-punchers wear horns. Yes, they do. They think we're
  holy terrors that eat with our six-guns beside our plates&mdash;and the like
  of that. They make me plum tired. I'd like to&mdash;wish we knew her
  brand."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you that," said Chip, cynically. "There's just two bunches to
  choose from. There's the Sweet Young Things, that faint away at sight of a
  six-shooter, and squawk and catch at your arm if they see a garter snake, and
  blush if you happen to catch their eye suddenly, and cry if you don't take
  off your hat every time you see them a mile off." Chip held out his cup for
  Patsy to refill.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I've run up against that brand&mdash;and they're sure all
  right. They suit <i>me</i>," remarked Cal.</p>

  <p>"That don't seem to line up with the doctor's diploma," commented
  Weary.</p>

  <p>"Well, she's the other kind then&mdash;and if she is, the Lord have mercy
  on the Flying U! She'll buy her some spurs and try to rope and cut out and
  help brand. Maybe she'll wear double-barreled skirts and ride a man's saddle
  and smoke cigarettes. She'll try to go the men one better in everything, and
  wind up by making a darn fool of herself. Either kind's bad enough."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet she don't run in either bunch," began Weary. "I'll bet she's a
  skinny old maid with a peaked nose and glasses, that'll round us up every
  Sunday and read tracts at our heads, and come down on us with both feet about
  tobacco hearts and whisky livers, and the evils and devils wrapped up in a
  cigarette paper. I seen a woman doctor, once&mdash;she was stopping at the T
  Down when I was line-riding for them&mdash;and say, she was a holy fright!
  She had us fellows going South before a week. I stampeded clean off the
  range, soon as my month was up."</p>

  <p>"Say," interrupted Cal, "don't yuh remember that picture the Old Man got
  last fall, of his sister? She was the image of the Old Man&mdash;and mighty
  near as old."</p>

  <p>Chip, thinking of the morrow's drive, groaned in real anguish of
  spirit.</p>

  <p>"You won't dast t' roll a cigarette comin' home, Chip," predicted Happy
  Jack, mournfully. "Yuh want t' smoke double goin' in."</p>

  <p>"I don't <i>think</i> I'll smoke double going in," returned Chip, dryly.
  "If the old girl don't like my style, why the walking isn't all taken
  up."</p>

  <p>"Say, Chip," suggested Jack Bates, "you size her up at the depot, and, if
  she don't look promising, just slack the lines on Antelope Hill. The creams
  'll do the rest. If they don't, we'll finish the job here."</p>

  <p>Shorty tactfully pushed back his chair and rose. "You fellows don't want
  to git too gay," he warned. "The Old Man's just beginning to forget about the
  calf-shed deal." Then he went out and shut the door after him. The boys liked
  Shorty; he believed in the old adage about wisdom being bliss at certain
  times, and the boys were all the better for his living up to his belief. He
  knew the Happy Family would stop inside the limit&mdash;at least, they always
  had, so far.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" demanded Cal, when the door closed behind their
  indulgent foreman.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's this. (Pass the syrup, Happy.) T'morrow's Sunday, so we'll have
  time t' burn. We'll dig up all the guns we can find, and catch up the
  orneriest cayuses in our strings, and have a real, old lynching
  bee&mdash;sabe?"</p>

  <p>"Who yuh goin' t' hang?" asked Slim, apprehensively. "Yuh needn't think
  <i>I'll</i> stand for it."</p>

  <p>"Aw, don't get nervous. There ain't power enough on the ranch t' pull yuh
  clear of the ground. We ain't going to build no derrick," said Jack,
  witheringly. "We'll have a dummy rigged up in the bunk house. When Chip and
  the doctor heave in sight on top of the grade, we'll break loose down here
  with our bronks and our guns, and smoke up the ranch in style. We'll drag out
  Mr. Strawman, and lynch him to the big gate before they get along. We'll be
  'riddling him with bullets' when they arrive&mdash;and by that time she'll be
  so rattled she won't know whether it's a man or a mule we've got strung
  up."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to cut down your victim before I get there," grinned Chip. "I
  never could get the creams through the gate, with a man hung to the frame;
  they'd spill us into the washout by the old shed, sure as fate."</p>

  <p>"That'd be all right. The old maid would sure know she was out
  West&mdash;we need something to add to the excitement, anyway."</p>

  <p>"If the Old Man's new buggy is piled in a heap, you'll wish you had cut
  out some of the excitement," retorted Chip.</p>

  <p>"All right, Splinter. We won't hang him there at all. That old cottonwood
  down by the creek would do fine. It'll curdle her blood like Dutch cheese to
  see us marching him down there&mdash;and she can't see the hay sticking out
  of his sleeves, that far off."</p>

  <p>"What if she wants to hold an autopsy?" bantered Chip.</p>

  <p>"By golly, we'll stake her to a hay knife and tell her to go after him!"
  cried Slim, suddenly waking up to the situation.</p>

  <p>The noon train slid away from the little, red depot at Dry Lake and curled
  out of sight around a hill. The only arrival looked expectantly into the
  cheerless waiting room, gazed after the train, which seemed the last link
  between her and civilization, and walked to the edge of the platform with a
  distinct frown upon the bit of forehead visible under her felt hat.</p>

  <p>A fat young man threw the mail sack into a weather-beaten buggy and drove
  leisurely down the track to the post office. The girl watched him out of
  sight and sighed disconsolately. All about her stretched the rolling grass
  land, faintly green in the hollows, brownly barren on the hilltops. Save the
  water tank and depot, not a house was to be seen, and the silence and
  loneliness oppressed her.</p>

  <p>The agent was dragging some boxes off the platform. She turned and walked
  determinedly up to him, and the agent became embarrassed under her level
  look.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there anyone here to meet me?" she demanded, quite needlessly. "I
  am Miss Whitmore, and my brother owns a ranch, somewhere near here. I wrote
  him, two weeks ago, that I was coming, and I certainly expected him to meet
  me." She tucked a wind-blown lock of brown hair under her hat crown and
  looked at the agent reproachfully, as if he were to blame, and the agent,
  feeling suddenly that somehow the fault was his, blushed guiltily and kicked
  at a box of oranges.</p>

  <p>"Whitmore's rig is in town," he said, hastily. "I saw his man at dinner.
  The train was reported late, but she made up time." Grasping desperately at
  his dignity, he swallowed an abject apology and retreated into the
  office.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore followed him a few steps, thought better of it, and paced
  the platform self-pityingly for ten minutes, at the end of which the Flying U
  rig whirled up in a cloud of dust, and the agent hurried out to help with the
  two trunks, and the mandolin and guitar in their canvas cases.</p>

  <p>The creams circled fearsomely up to the platform and stood quivering with
  eagerness to be off, their great eyes rolling nervously. Miss Whitmore took
  her place beside Chip with some inward trepidation mingled with her relief.
  When they were quite ready and the reins loosened suggestively, Pet stood
  upon her hind feet with delight and Polly lunged forward precipitately.</p>

  <p>The girl caught her breath, and Chip eyed her sharply from the corner of
  his eye. He hoped she was not going to scream&mdash;he detested screaming
  women. She looked young to be a doctor, he decided, after that lightning
  survey. He hoped to goodness she wasn't of the Sweet Young Thing order; he
  had no patience with that sort of woman. Truth to tell, he had no patience
  with <i>any</i> sort of woman.</p>

  <p>He spoke to the horses authoritatively, and they obeyed and settled to a
  long, swinging trot that knew no weariness, and the girl's heart returned to
  its normal action.</p>

  <p>Two miles were covered in swift silence, then Miss Whitmore brought
  herself to think of the present and realized that the young man beside her
  had not opened his lips except to speak once to his team. She turned her head
  and regarded him curiously, and Chip, feeling the scrutiny, grew inwardly
  defiant.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore decided, after a close inspection, that she rather liked his
  looks, though he did not strike her as a very amiable young man. Perhaps she
  was a bit tired of amiable young men. His face was thin, and refined, and
  strong&mdash;the strength of level brows, straight nose and square chin, with
  a pair of paradoxical lips, which were curved and womanish in their
  sensitiveness; the refinement was an intangible expression which belonged to
  no particular feature but pervaded the whole face. As to his eyes, she was
  left to speculate upon their color, since she had not seen them, but she
  reflected that many a girl would give a good deal to own his lashes.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden he turned his eyes from the trail and met her look squarely.
  If he meant to confuse her, he failed&mdash;for she only smiled and said to
  herself: "They're hazel."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think we ought to introduce ourselves?" she asked, composedly,
  when she was quite sure the eyes were not brown.</p>

  <p>"Maybe." Chip's tone was neutrally polite.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore had suspected that he was painfully bashful, after the
  manner of country young men. She now decided that he was not; he was
  passively antagonistic.</p>

  <p>"Of course you know that I'm Della Whitmore," she said.</p>

  <p>Chip carefully brushed a fly off Polly's flank with the whip.</p>

  <p>"I took it for granted. I was sent to meet a Miss Whitmore at the train,
  and I took the only lady in sight."</p>

  <p>"You took the right one&mdash;but I'm not&mdash;I haven't the faintest
  idea who you are."</p>

  <p>"My name is Claude Bennett, and I'm happy to make your acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it&mdash;you don't look happy," said Miss Whitmore,
  inwardly amused.</p>

  <p>"That's the proper thing to say when you've been introduced to a lady,"
  remarked Chip, noncommittally, though his lips twitched at the corners.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore, finding no ready reply to this truthful statement,
  remarked, after a pause, that it was windy. Chip agreed that it was, and
  conversation languished.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore sighed and took to studying the landscape, which had become
  a succession of sharp ridges and narrow coulees, water-worn and bleak, with a
  purplish line of mountains off to the left. After several miles she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"What is that animal over there? Do dogs wander over this wilderness
  alone?"</p>

  <p>Chip's eyes followed her pointing finger.</p>

  <p>"That's a coyote. I wish I could get a shot at him&mdash;they're an awful
  pest, out here, you know." He looked longingly at the rifle under his feet.
  "If I thought you could hold the horses a minute- -"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can't! I&mdash;I'm not accustomed to horses&mdash;but I can shoot a
  little."</p>

  <p>Chip gave her a quick, measuring glance. The coyote had halted and was
  squatting upon his haunches, his sharp nose pointed inquisitively toward
  them. Chip slowed the creams to a walk, raised the gun and laid it across his
  knees, threw a shell into position and adjusted the sight.</p>

  <p>"Here, you can try, if you like," he said. "Whenever you're ready I'll
  stop. You had better stand up&mdash;I'll watch that you don't fall. Ready?
  Whoa, Pet!"</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore did not much like the skepticism in his tone, but she stood
  up, took quick, careful aim and fired.</p>

  <p>Pet jumped her full length and reared, but Chip was watching for some such
  performance and had them well under control, even though he was compelled to
  catch Miss Whitmore from lurching backward upon her baggage behind the
  seat&mdash;which would have been bad for the guitar and mandolin, if not for
  the young woman.</p>

  <p>The coyote had sprung high in air, whirled dizzily and darted over the
  hill.</p>

  <p>"You hit him," cried Chip, forgetting his prejudice for a moment. He
  turned the creams from the road, filled with the spirit of the chase. Miss
  Whitmore will long remember that mad dash over the hilltops and into the
  hollows, in which she could only cling to the rifle and to the seat as best
  she might, and hope that the driver knew what he was about&mdash;which he
  certainly did.</p>

  <p>"There he goes, sneaking down that coulee! He'll get into one of those
  washouts and hide, if we don't head him off. I'll drive around so you can get
  another shot at him," cried Chip. He headed up the hill again until the
  coyote, crouching low, was fully revealed.</p>

  <p>"That's a fine shot. Throw another shell in, quick! You better kneel on
  the seat, this time&mdash;the horses know what's coming. Steady, Polly, my
  girl!"</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore glanced down the hill, and then, apprehensively, at the
  creams, who were clanking their bits, wild-eyed and quivering. Only their
  master's familiar voice and firm grip on the reins held them there at all.
  Chip saw and interpreted the glance, somewhat contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course if you're <i>afraid</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore set her teeth savagely, knelt and fired, cutting the
  sentence short in his teeth and forcing his undivided attention to the
  horses, which showed a strong inclination to bolt.</p>

  <p>"I think I got him that time," said she, nonchalantly, setting her hat
  straight&mdash;though Chip, with one of his quick glances, observed that she
  was rather white around the mouth.</p>

  <p>He brought the horses dexterously into the road and quieted them.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to get my coyote?" she ventured to ask.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. The road swings back, down that same coulee, and we'll pass
  right by it. Then I'll get out and pick him up, while you hold the
  horses."</p>

  <p>"You'll hold those horses yourself," returned Miss Whitmore, with
  considerable spirit. "I'd much rather pick up the coyote, thank you."</p>

  <p>Chip said nothing to this, whatever he may have thought. He drove up to
  the coyote with much coaxing of Pet and Polly, who eyed the gray object
  askance. Miss Whitmore sprang out and seized the animal by its coarse, bushy
  tail.</p>

  <p>"Gracious, he's heavy!" she exclaimed, after one tug.</p>

  <p>"He's been fattening up on Flying U calves," remarked Chip, his foot upon
  the brake.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore knelt and examined the cattle thief curiously.</p>

  <p>"Look," she said, "here's where I hit him the first time; the bullet took
  a diagonal course from the shoulder back to the other side. It must have gone
  within an inch of his heart, and would have finished him in a short time,
  without that other shot&mdash;that penetrated his brain, you see; death was
  instantaneous."</p>

  <p>Chip had taken advantage of the halt to roll a cigarette, holding the
  reins tightly between his knees while he did so. He passed the loose edge of
  the paper across the tip of his tongue, eying the young woman curiously the
  while.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be pretty well onto your job," he remarked, dryly.</p>

  <p>"I ought to be," she said, laughing a little. "I've been learning the
  trade ever since I was sixteen."</p>

  <p>"Yes? You began early."</p>

  <p>"My Uncle John is a doctor. I helped him in the office till he got me into
  the medical school. I was brought up in an atmosphere of antiseptics and
  learned all the bones in Uncle John's 'Boneparte'&mdash;the skeleton, you
  know&mdash;before I knew all my letters." She dragged the coyote close to the
  wheel.</p>

  <p>"Let me get hold of the tail." Chip carefully pinched out the blaze of his
  match and threw it away before he leaned over to help. With a quick lift he
  landed the animal, limp and bloody, squarely upon the top of Miss Whitmore's
  largest trunk. The pointed nose hung down the side, the white fangs exposed
  in a sinister grin. The girl gazed upon him proudly at first, then in
  dismay.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's dripping blood all over my mandolin case&mdash;and I just know
  it won't come out!" She tugged frantically at the instrument.</p>

  <p>"'Out, damned spot!'" quoted Chip in a sepulchral tone before he turned to
  assist her.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore let go the mandolin and stared blankly up at him, and Chip,
  offended at her frank surprise that he should quote Shakespeare, shut his
  lips tightly and relapsed into silence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; OVER THE "HOG'S BACK."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THAT'S Flying U ranch," volunteered Chip, as they turned
  sharply to the right and began to descend a long grade built into the side of
  a steep, rocky bluff. Below them lay the ranch in a long, narrow coulee.
  Nearest them sprawled the house, low, white and roomy, with broad porches and
  wide windows; further down the coulee, at the base of a gentle slope, were
  the sheds, the high, round corrals and the haystacks. Great, board gates were
  distributed in seemingly useless profusion, while barbed wire fences
  stretched away in all directions. A small creek, bordered with cottonwoods
  and scraggly willows, wound aimlessly away down the coulee.</p>

  <p>"J. G. doesn't seem to have much method," remarked Miss Whitmore, after a
  critical survey. "What are all those log cabins scattered down the hill for?
  They look as though J. G. had a handful that he didn't want, and just threw
  them down toward the stable and left them lying where they happened to
  fall."</p>

  <p>"It does, all right," conceded Chip. "They're the bunk house&mdash; where
  us fellows sleep&mdash;and the mess house, where we eat, and then come the
  blacksmith shop and a shack we keep all kinds of truck in, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;in&mdash;the world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A chorus of shouts and shots arose from below. A scurrying group of
  horsemen burst over the hill behind the house, dashed half down the slope,
  and surrounded the bunk house with blood-curdling yells. Chip held the creams
  to a walk and furtively watched his companion. Miss Whitmore's eyes were very
  wide open; plainly, she was astonished beyond measure at the uproar. Whether
  she was also frightened, Chip could not determine.</p>

  <p>The menacing yells increased in volume till the very hills seemed to cower
  in fear. Miss Whitmore gasped when a limp form was dragged from the cabin and
  lifted to the back of a snorting pony.</p>

  <p>"They've got a rope around that man's neck," she breathed, in a horrified
  half whisper. "Are&mdash;they&mdash;going to <i>hang</i> him?"</p>

  <p>"It kinda looks that way, from here," said Chip, inwardly ashamed. All at
  once it struck him as mean and cowardly to frighten a lady who had traveled
  far among strangers and who had that tired droop to her mouth. It wasn't a
  fair game; it was cheating. Only for his promise to the boys, he would have
  told her the truth then and there.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore was not a stupid young woman; his very indifference told her
  all that she needed to know. She tore her eyes from the confused jumble of
  gesticulating men and restive steeds to look sharply at Chip. He met her eyes
  squarely for an instant, and the horror oozed from her and left only amused
  chagrin that they should try to trick her so.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up," she commanded, "so I can be in at the death. Remember, I'm a
  doctor. They're tying him to his horse&mdash;he looks half dead with
  fright."</p>

  <p>Inwardly she added: "He overacts the part dreadfully."</p>

  <p>The little cavalcade in the coulee fired a spectacular volley into the air
  and swept down the slope like a dry-weather whirlwind across a patch of
  alkali ground. Through the big gate and up the road past the stables they
  thundered, the prisoner bound and helpless in their midst.</p>

  <p>Then something happened. A wide-open River Press, flapping impotently in
  the embrace of a willow, caught the eye of Banjo, a little blaze&mdash;faced
  bay who bore the captive. He squatted, ducked backward so suddenly that his
  reins slipped from Slim's fingers and lowered his head between his white
  front feet. His rider seemed stupid beyond any that Banjo had ever
  known&mdash;and he had known many. Snorting and pitching, he was away before
  the valiant band realized what was happening in their midst. The prisoner
  swayed drunkenly in the saddle. At the third jump his hat flew off,
  disclosing the jagged end of a two-by-four.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family groaned as one man and gave chase.</p>

  <p>Banjo, with almost human maliciousness, was heading up the road straight
  toward Chip and the woman doctor&mdash;and she must be a poor doctor indeed,
  and a badly frightened one, withal, if she failed to observe a peculiarity in
  the horse thief's cranium.</p>

  <p>Cal Emmett dug his spurs into his horse and shot by Slim like a
  locomotive, shouting profanity as he went.</p>

  <p>"Head him into the creek," yelled Happy Jack, and leaned low over the neck
  of his sorrel.</p>

  <p>Weary Willie stood up in his stirrups and fanned Glory with his hat. "Yip,
  yee&mdash;e-e! Go to it, Banjo, old boy! Watch his nibs ride, would yuh? He's
  a broncho buster from away back." Weary Willie was the only man of them all
  who appeared to find any enjoyment in the situation.</p>

  <p>"If Chip only had the sense to slow up and give us a chance&mdash;or spill
  that old maid over the bank!" groaned Jack Bates, and plied whip and spur to
  overtake the runaway.</p>

  <p>Now the captive was riding dizzily, head downward, frightening Banjo half
  out of his senses. What he had started as a grim jest, he now continued in
  deadly earnest; what was this uncanny semblance of a cow-puncher which he
  could not unseat, yet which clung so precariously to the saddle? He had no
  thought now of bucking in pure devilment&mdash;he was galloping madly, his
  eyes wild and staring.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden, Chip saw danger lurking beneath the fun of it. He leaned
  forward a little, got a fresh grip on the reins and took the whip.</p>

  <p>"Hang tight, now&mdash;I'm going to beat that horse to the Hog's
  Back."</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore, laughing till the tears stood in her eyes, braced herself
  mechanically. Chip had been laughing also&mdash;but that was before Banjo
  struck into the hill road in his wild flight from the terror that rode in the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>A smart flick of the whip upon their glossy backs, and the creams sprang
  forward at a run. The buggy was new and strong, and if they kept the road all
  would be well&mdash;unless they met Banjo upon the narrow ridge between two
  broad-topped knolls, known as the Hog's Back. Another tap, and the creams ran
  like deer. One wheel struck a cobble stone, and the buggy lurched
  horribly.</p>

  <p>"Stop! There goes my coyote!" cried Miss Whitmore, as a gray object slid
  down under the hind wheel.</p>

  <p>"Hang on or you'll go next," was all the comfort she got, as Chip braced
  himself for the struggle before him. The Hog's Back was reached, but Banjo
  was pounding up the hill beyond, his nostrils red and flaring, his sides
  reeking with perspiration. Behind him tore the Flying U boys in a vain effort
  to head him back into the coulee before mischief was done.</p>

  <p>Chip drew his breath sharply when the creams swerved out upon the broad
  hilltop, just as Banjo thundered past with nothing left of his rider but the
  legs, and with them shorn of their plumpness as the hay dribbled out upon the
  road.</p>

  <p>A fresh danger straightway forced itself upon Chip's consciousness. The
  creams, maddened by the excitement, were running away. He held them sternly
  to the road and left the stopping of them to Providence, inwardly thanking
  the Lord that Miss Whitmore did not seem to be the screaming kind of
  woman.</p>

  <p>The "vigilantes" drew hastily out of the road and scudded out of sight
  down a gully as the creams lunged down the steep grade and across the shallow
  creek bed. Fortunately the great gate by the stable swung wide open and they
  galloped through and up the long slope to the house, coming more under
  control at every leap, till, by a supreme effort, Chip brought them, panting,
  to a stand before the porch where the Old Man stood boiling over with anxiety
  and excitement. James G. Whitmore was not a man who took things calmly; had
  he been a woman he would have been called fussy.</p>

  <p>"What in&mdash;what was you making a race track out of the grade for," he
  demanded, after he had bestowed a hasty kiss beside the nose of his
  sister.</p>

  <p>Chip dropped a heavy trunk upon the porch and reached for the guitar
  before he answered.</p>

  <p>"I was just trying those new springs on the buggy."</p>

  <p>"It was very exciting," commented Miss Whitmore, airily. "I shot a coyote,
  J. G., but we lost it coming down the hill. Your men were playing a funny
  game&mdash;hare and hounds, it looked like. Or were they breaking a new
  horse?"</p>

  <p>The Old Man looked at Chip, intelligence dawning in his face. There was
  something back of it all, he knew. He had been asleep when the uproar began,
  and had reached the door only in time to see the creams come down the grade
  like a daylight shooting star.</p>

  <p>"I guess they was breaking a bronk," he said, carelessly; "you've got
  enough baggage for a trip round the world, Dell. I hope it ain't all dope for
  us poor devils. Tell Shorty I want t' see him, Chip."</p>

  <p>Chip took the reins from the Old Man's hands, sprang in and drove back
  down the hill to the stables.</p>

  <p>The "reception committee," as Chip sarcastically christened them, rounded
  up the runaway and sneaked back to the ranch by the coulee trail. With much
  unseemly language, they stripped the saddle and a flapping pair of overalls
  off poor, disgraced Banjo, and kicked him out of the corral.</p>

  <p>"That's the way Jack's schemes always pan out," grumbled Slim. "By golly,
  yuh don't get me into another jackpot like that!"</p>

  <p>"You might explain why you let that" (several kinds of) "cayuse get away
  from you!" retorted Jack, fretfully. "If you'd been onto your job, things
  would have been smooth as silk."</p>

  <p>"Wonder what the old maid thought," broke in Weary, bent on preserving
  peace in the Happy Family.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet she never saw us at all!" laughed Cal. "Old Splinter gave her
  all she wanted to do, hanging to the rig. The way he came down that grade
  wasn't slow. He just missed running into Banjo on the Hog's Back by the skin
  of the teeth. If he had, it'd be good-by, doctor&mdash;and Chip, too. Gee,
  that was a close shave!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Happy Jack, mournfully, "if we don't all get the bounce for
  this, I miss my guess. It's a little the worst we've done yet."</p>

  <p>"Except that time we tin-canned that stray steer, last winter," amended
  Weary, chuckling over the remembrance as he fastened the big gate behind
  them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was another of Jack's fool schemes," put in Slim. "Go and
  tin-can a four-year-old steer and let him take after the Old Man and put him
  on the calf shed, first pass he made. Old Man was sure hot about
  that&mdash;by golly, it didn't help his rheumatism none."</p>

  <p>"He'll sure go straight in the air over this," reiterated Happy Jack, with
  mournful conviction.</p>

  <p>"There's old Splinter at the bunk house&mdash;drawing our pictures, I'll
  bet a dollar. Hey, Chip! How you vas, already yet?" sung out Weary, whose
  sunny temper no calamity could sour.</p>

  <p>Chip glanced at them and went on cutting the leaves of a late magazine
  which he had purloined from the Dry Lake barber. Cal Emmett strode up and
  grabbed the limp, gray hat from his head and began using it for a
  football.</p>

  <p>"Here! Give that back!" commanded Chip, laughing. "<i>Don't</i> make a
  dish rag of my new John B. Stetson, Cal. It won't be fit for the dance."</p>

  <p>"Gee! It don't lack much of being a dish rag, now, if I'm any judge. Now!
  Great Scott!" He held it at arm's length and regarded it derisively.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was new two years ago," explained Chip, making an ineffectual
  grab at it.</p>

  <p>Cal threw it to him and came and sat down upon his heels to peer over
  Chip's arm at the magazine.</p>

  <p>"How's the old maid doctor?" asked Jack Bates, leaning against the door
  while he rolled a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Scared plum to death. I left the remains in the Old Man's arms."</p>

  <p>"Was she scared, honest?" Cal left off studying the "Types of Fair
  Women."</p>

  <p>"What did she say when we broke loose?" Jack drew a match sharply along a
  log.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Well, yes, she said 'Are they going to H-A-N-G that man?'"
  Chip's voice quavered the words in a shrill falsetto.</p>

  <p>"The deuce she did!" Jack indulged in a gratified laugh.</p>

  <p>"What did she say when you put the creams under the whip, up there? I
  don't suppose the old girl is wise to the fact that you saved her neck right
  then&mdash;but you sure did. You done yourself proud, Splinter." Cal patted
  Chip's knee approvingly.</p>

  <p>Chip blushed under the praise and hastily answered the question.</p>

  <p>"She hollered out: 'Stop! There goes my <i>coyote</i>!'"</p>

  <p>"Her <i>coyote</i>?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Her</i> coyote?"</p>

  <p>"What the devil was she doing with a <i>coyote</i>?"</p>

  <p>The Happy Family stood transfixed, and Chip's eyes were seen to laugh.</p>

  <p>"<i>Her coyote</i>. Did any of you fellows happen to see a dead coyote up
  on the grade? Because if you did, it's the doctor's."</p>

  <p>Weary Willie walked deliberately over and seized Chip by the shoulders,
  bringing him to his feet with one powerful yank.</p>

  <p>"Don't you try throwing any loads into <i>this</i> crowd, young man.
  Answer me truly-s'help yuh. How did that old maid come by a coyote&mdash;a
  dead one?"</p>

  <p>Chip squirmed loose and reached for his cigarette book. "She shot it," he
  said, calmly, but with twitching lips.</p>

  <p>"Shot it!" Five voices made up the incredulous echo.</p>

  <p>"What with?" demanded Weary when he got his breath.</p>

  <p>"With my rifle. I brought it out from town today. Bert Rogers had left it
  at the barber shop for me."</p>

  <p>"Gee whiz! And them creams hating a gun like poison! She didn't shoot from
  the rig, did she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chip, "she did. The first time she didn't know any
  better&mdash;and the second time she was hot at me for hinting she was
  scared. She's a spunky little devil, all right. She's busy hating me right
  now for running the grade&mdash;thinks I did it to scare her, I guess. That's
  all some fool women know."</p>

  <p>"She's a howling sport, then!" groaned Cal, who much preferred the Sweet
  Young Things.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I sized her up as a maverick."</p>

  <p>"What does she look like?"</p>

  <p>"How old is she?"</p>

  <p>"I never asked her age," replied Chip, his face lighting briefly in a
  smile. "As to her looks, she isn't cross-eyed, and she isn't four-eyed.
  That's as much as I noticed." After this bald lie he became busy with his
  cigarette. "Give me that magazine, Cal. I didn't finish cutting the
  leaves."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; SILVER.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS DELLA WHITMORE gazed meditatively down the hill at the
  bunk house. The boys were all at work, she knew. She had heard J. G. tell two
  of them to "ride the sheep coulee fence," and had been consumed with amazed
  curiosity at the order. Wherefore should two sturdy young men be commanded to
  ride a fence, when there were horses that assuredly needed
  exercise&mdash;judging by their antics&mdash; and needed it badly? She
  resolved to ask J. G. at the first opportunity.</p>

  <p>The others were down at the corrals, branding a few calves which belonged
  on the home ranch. She had announced her intention of going to look on, and
  her brother, knowing how the boys would regard her presence, had told her
  plainly that they did not want her. He said it was no place for girls,
  anyway. Then he had put on a very dirty pair of overalls and hurried down to
  help for he was not above lending a hand when there was extra work to be
  done.</p>

  <p>Miss Della Whitmore tidied the kitchen and dusted the sitting room, and
  then, having a pair of mischievously idle hands and a very feminine
  curiosity, conceived an irrepressible desire to inspect the bunk house.</p>

  <p>J. G. would tell her that, also, was no place for girls, she supposed, but
  J. G. was not present, so his opinion did not concern her. She had been at
  the Flying U ranch a whole week, and was beginning to feel that its resources
  for entertainment&mdash;aside from the masculine contingent, which held some
  promising material&mdash;were about exhausted. She had climbed the bluffs
  which hemmed the coulee on either side, had selected her own private saddle
  horse, a little sorrel named Concho, and had made friends with Patsy, the
  cook. She had dazzled Cal Emmett with her wiles and had found occasion to
  show Chip how little she thought of him; a highly unsatisfactory achievement,
  since Chip calmly over- looked her whenever common politeness permitted
  him.</p>

  <p>There yet remained the unexplored mystery of that little cabin down the
  slope, from which sounded so much boylike laughter of an evening. She watched
  and waited till she was positive the coast was clear, then clapped an old hat
  of J. G.'s upon her head and ran lightly down the hill.</p>

  <p>With her hand upon the knob, she ran her eye critically along the outer
  wall and decided that it had, at some remote date, been treated to a coat of
  whitewash; gave the knob a sudden twist, with a backward glance like a child
  stealing cookies, stepped in and came near falling headlong. She had not
  expected that remoteness of floor common to cabins built on a side hill.</p>

  <p>"Well!" She pulled herself together and looked curiously about her. What
  struck her at first was the total absence of bunks. There were a couple of
  plain, iron bedsteads and two wooden ones made of rough planks. There was a
  funny-looking table made of an inverted coffee box with legs of two-by-four,
  and littered with a characteristic collection of bachelor trinkets. There was
  a glass lamp with a badly smoked chimney, a pack of cards, a sack of smoking
  tobacco and a box of matches. There was a tin box with spools of very coarse
  thread, some equally coarse needles and a pair of scissors. There was
  also&mdash;and Miss Whitmore gasped when she saw it&mdash;a pile of much-read
  magazines with the latest number of her favorite upon the top. She went
  closer and examined them, and glanced around the room with doubting eyes.
  There were spurs, quirts, chaps and queer-looking bits upon the walls; there
  were cigarette stubs and burned matches innumerable upon the rough, board
  floor, and here in her hand&mdash;she turned the pages of her favorite
  abstractedly and a paper fluttered out and fell, face upward, on the floor.
  She stooped and recovered it, glanced and gasped.</p>

  <p>"Well!"</p>

  <p>It was only a pencil sketch done on cheap, unruled tablet paper, but her
  mind dissolved into a chaos of interrogation marks and exclamation
  points&mdash;with the latter predominating more and more the longer she
  looked.</p>

  <p>It showed blunt-topped hills and a shallow coulee which she remembered
  perfectly. In the foreground a young woman in a smart tailored costume, the
  accuracy of which was something amazing, stood proudly surveying a dead
  coyote at her feet. In a corner of the picture stood a weather-beaten stump
  with a long, thin splinter beside it on the ground. Underneath was written in
  characters beautifully symmetrical: "The old maid's credential card."</p>

  <p>There was no gainsaying the likeness; even the rakish tilt of the jaunty
  felt hat, caused by the wind and that wild dash across country, was
  painstakingly reproduced. And the fanciful tucks on the sleeve of the
  gown&mdash;"and I didn't suppose he had deigned so much as a glance!" was her
  first coherent thought.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore's soul burned with resentment. No woman, even at
  twenty-three, loves to be called "the old maid"&mdash;especially by a
  keen-witted young man with square chin and lips with a pronounced curve to
  them. And whoever supposed the fellow could draw like that&mdash;and notice
  every tiny little detail without really looking once? Of course, she knew her
  hat was crooked, with the wind blowing one's head off, almost, but he had no
  business: "The old maid's credential card!"&mdash;"Old maid," indeed!</p>

  <p>"The audacity of him!"</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon?"</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore wheeled quickly, her heart in the upper part of her throat,
  judging by the feel of it. Chip himself stood just inside the door, eying her
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"I was not speaking," said Miss Whitmore, haughtily, in futile denial.</p>

  <p>To this surprising statement Chip had nothing to say. He went to one of
  the iron beds, stooped and drew out a bundle which, had Miss Whitmore asked
  him what it was, he would probably have called his "war sack." She did not
  ask; she stood and watched him, though her conscience assured her it was a
  dreadfully rude thing to do, and that her place was up at the house. Miss
  Whitmore was frequently at odds with her conscience; at this time she stood
  her ground, backed by her pride, which was her chiefest ally in such
  emergencies.</p>

  <p>When he drew a huge, murderous-looking revolver from its scabbard and
  proceeded calmly to insert cartridge after cartridge, Miss Whitmore was
  constrained to speech.</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;going to&mdash;<i>shoot</i> something?"</p>

  <p>The question struck them both as particularly inane, in view of his
  actions.</p>

  <p>"I am," replied he, without looking up. He whirled the cylinder into
  place, pushed the bundle back under the bed and rose, polishing the barrel of
  the gun with a silk handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore hoped he wasn't going to murder anyone; he looked keyed up
  to almost any desperate deed.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;what are you going to shoot?" Really, the question asked
  itself.</p>

  <p>Chip raised his eyes for a fleeting glance which took in the pencil sketch
  in her hand. Miss Whitmore observed that his eyes were much darker than
  hazel; they were almost black. And there was, strangely enough, not a
  particle of curve to his lips; they were thin, and straight, and stern.</p>

  <p>"Silver. He broke his leg."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" There was real horror in her tone. Miss Whitmore knew all about
  Silver from garrulous Patsy. Chip had rescued a pretty, brown colt from
  starving on the range, had bought him from the owner, petted and cared for him
  until he was now one of the best saddle horses on the ranch. He was a dark
  chestnut, with beautiful white, crinkly mane and tail and white feet. Miss
  Whitmore had seen Chip riding him down the coulee trail only yesterday, and
  now&mdash;Her heart ached with the pity of it.</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He was in the little pasture. Got kicked, maybe." Chip
  jerked open the door with a force greatly in excess of the need of it.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore started impulsively toward him. Her eyes were not quite
  clear.</p>

  <p>"Don't&mdash;not yet! Let me go. If it's a straight break I can set the
  bone and save him."</p>

  <p>Chip, savage in his misery, regarded her over one square shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Are you a veterinary surgeon, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore felt her cheeks grow hot, but she stood her ground.</p>

  <p>"I am not. But a broken bone is a broken bone, whether it belongs to a
  man&mdash;or some <i>other</i> beast!"</p>

  <p>"Y&mdash;e-s?"</p>

  <p>Chip's way of saying yes was one of his chief weapons of annihilation. He
  had a peculiar, taunting inflection which he could give to it, upon occasion,
  which caused prickles of flesh upon the victim. To say that Miss Whitmore was
  not utterly quenched argues well for her courage. She only gasped, as though
  treated to an unexpected dash of cold water, and went on.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I might save him if you'd let me try. Or are you really eager to
  shoot him?"</p>

  <p>Chip's muscles shrank. Eager to shoot him&mdash;Silver, the only thing
  that loved and understood him?</p>

  <p>"You may come and look at him, if you like," he said, after a breath or
  two.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore overlooked the tolerance of the tone and stepped to his
  side, mechanically clutching the sketch in her fingers. It was Chip, looking
  down at her from his extra foot of height, who called her attention to
  it.</p>

  <p>"Are you thinking of using that for a plaster?"</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore started and blushed, then, with an uptilt of chin:</p>

  <p>"If I need a strong irritant, yes!" She calmly rolled the paper into a
  tiny tube and thrust it into the front of her pink shirt- waist for want of a
  pocket&mdash;and Chip, watching her surreptitiously, felt a queer grip in his
  chest, which he thought it best to set down as anger.</p>

  <p>Silently they hurried down where Silver lay, his beautiful, gleaming mane
  brushing the tender green of the young grass blades. He lifted his head when
  he heard Chip's step, and neighed wistfully. Chip bent over him, black agony
  in his eyes. Miss Whitmore, looking on, realized for the first time that the
  suffering of the horse was a mere trifle compared to that of his master. Her
  eyes wandered to the loaded revolver which bulged his pocket behind, and she
  shuddered&mdash;but not for Silver. She went closer and laid her hand upon
  the shimmery mane. The horse snorted nervously and struggled to rise.</p>

  <p>"He's not used to a woman," said Chip, with a certain accent of pride. "I
  guess this is the closest he's ever been to one. You see, he's never had any
  one handle him but me."</p>

  <p>"Then he certainly is no lady's horse," said Miss Whitmore, good-
  naturedly. Somehow, in the last moment, her attitude toward Chip had changed
  considerably. "Try and make him let me feel the break."</p>

  <p>With much coaxing and soothing words it was accomplished, and it did not
  take long, for it was a front leg, broken straight across, just above the
  fetlock. Miss Whitmore stood up and smiled into the young man's eyes,
  conscious of a desire to bring the curve back into his lips.</p>

  <p>"It's very simple," she declared, cheerfully. "I know I can cure him. We
  had a colt at home with his leg broken the same way, and he was entirely
  cured&mdash;and doesn't even limp. Of course," she added, honestly, "Uncle
  John doctored him&mdash;but I helped."</p>

  <p>Chip drew the back of his gloved hand quickly across his eyes and
  swallowed.</p>

  <p>"Miss Whitmore&mdash;if you could save old Silver&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore, the self-contained young medical graduate, blinked rapidly
  and found urgent need of tucking in wind-blown, brown locks, with her back to
  the tall cow-puncher who had unwittingly dropped his mask for an instant. She
  took off J. G.'s old hat, turned it clean around twice and put it back
  exactly as it was before; unless the tilt over her left ear was a trifle more
  pronounced. Show me the woman who can set a hat straight upon her head
  without aid of a mirror!</p>

  <p>"We must get him up from there and into a box stall. There is one, isn't
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Y&mdash;e-s&mdash;" Chip hesitated. "I wouldn't ask the Old&mdash;your
  brother, for the use of it, though; not even for Silver."</p>

  <p>"I will," returned she, promptly. "I never feel any compunction about
  asking for what I want&mdash;if I can't get it any other way. I can't
  understand why you wanted to shoot&mdash;you must have known this bone could
  be set."</p>

  <p>"I didn't <i>want</i> to&mdash;" Chip bent over and drove a fly from
  Silver's shoulder. "When a horse belonging to the outfit gets crippled like
  that, he makes coyote bait. A forty-dollar cow-puncher can't expect any
  better for his own horse."</p>

  <p>"He'll <i>get</i> better, whatever he may expect. I'm just spoiling for
  something to practice on, anyway&mdash;and he's such a beauty. If you can get
  him up, lead him to the stable while I go and tell J. G. and get some one to
  help." She started away.</p>

  <p>"Whom shall I get?" she called back.</p>

  <p>"Weary, if you can&mdash;and Slim's a good hand with horses, too."</p>

  <p>"Slim&mdash;is that the tall, lanky man?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he's the short, fat one. That bean-pole is Shorty."</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore fixed these facts firmly in her memory and ran swiftly to
  where rose all the dust and noise from the further corral. She climbed up
  until she could look conveniently over the top rail. The fence seemed to her
  dreadfully high&mdash;a clear waste of straight, sturdy poles.</p>

  <p>"J. G&mdash;e-e-e!"</p>

  <p>"Baw&mdash;h-h-h!" came answer from a wholly unexpected source as a big,
  red cow charged and struck the fence under her feet a blow which nearly
  dislodged her from her perch. The cow recoiled a few steps and lowered her
  head truculently.</p>

  <p>"Scat! Shoo, there! Go on away, you horrid old thing you! Oh, J.
  G&mdash;e-e-e!"</p>

  <p>Weary, who was roping, had just dragged a calf up to the fire and was
  making a loop to catch another when the cow made a second charge at the
  fence. He dashed in ahead of her, his horse narrowly escaping an ugly gash
  from her long, wicked horns. As he dodged he threw his rope with the
  peculiar, back-hand twist of the practiced roper, catching her by the head
  and one front foot. Straight across the corral he shot to the end of a
  forty-foot rope tied fast to the saddle horn. The red cow flopped with a
  thump which knocked all desire for trouble out of her for the time. Shorty
  slipped the rope off and climbed the fence, but the cow only shook her aching
  sides and limped sullenly away to the far side of the corral. J. G. and the
  boys had shinned up the fence like scared cats up a tree when the trouble
  began, and perched in a row upon the top. The Old Man looked across and
  espied his sister, wide-eyed and undignified, watching the outcome.</p>

  <p>"Dell! What in thunder are <i>you</i> doing on that fence?" he shouted
  across the corral.</p>

  <p>"What in thunder are you doing on the fence, J. G.?" she flung back at
  him.</p>

  <p>The Old Man climbed shamefacedly down, followed by the others. "Is that
  what you call 'getting put in the clear'?" asked she, genially. "I see
  now&mdash;it means clear on the top rail."</p>

  <p>"You go back to the house and stay there!" commanded J. G., wrathfully.
  The boys were showing unmistakable symptoms of mirth, and the laugh was
  plainly against the Old Man.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," came her voice, honey-sweet and calm. "Shoo that cow this way
  again, will you, Mr..Weary? I like to watch J. G. shin up the fence. It's
  good for him; it makes one supple, and J. G.'s actually getting fat."</p>

  <p>"Hurry along with that calf!" shouted the Old Man, recovering the branding
  iron and turning his back on his tormentor.</p>

  <p>The boys, beyond grinning furtively at one another, behaved with quite
  praiseworthy gravity. Miss Whitmore watched while Weary dragged a spotted
  calf up to the fire and the boys threw it to the ground and held it until the
  Old Man had stamped it artistically with a smoking U.</p>

  <p>"Oh, J. G.!"</p>

  <p>"Ain't you gone yet? What d'yuh want?"</p>

  <p>"Silver broke his leg."</p>

  <p>"Huh. I knew that long ago. Chip's gone to shoot him. You go on to the
  house, doggone it! You'll have every cow in the corral on the fight. That red
  waist of yours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It isn't red, it's pink&mdash;a beautiful rose pink. If your cows don't
  like it, they'll have to be educated up to it. Chip isn't either going to
  shoot that horse, J. G. I'm going to set his leg and cure him&mdash;and I'm
  going to keep him in one of your box stalls. There, now!"</p>

  <p>Cal Emmett took a sudden fit of coughing and leaned his forehead weakly
  against a rail, and Weary got into some unnecessary argument with his horse
  and bolted across to the gate, where his shoulders were seen to
  shake&mdash;possibly with a nervous chill; the bravest riders are sometimes
  so affected. Nobody laughed, however. Indeed, Slim seemed unusually serious,
  even for him, while Happy Jack looked positively in pain.</p>

  <p>"I want that short, fat man to help" (Slim squirmed at this blunt
  identification of himself) "and Mr. Weary, also." Miss Whitmore might have
  spoken with a greater effect of dignity had she not been clinging to the top
  of the fence with two dainty slipper toes thrust between the rails not so
  very far below. Under the circumstances, she looked like a pretty, spoiled
  little schoolgirl.</p>

  <p>"Oh. You've turned horse doctor, have yuh?" J. G. leaned suddenly upon his
  branding iron and laughed. "Doggone it, that ain't a bad idea. I've got two
  box stalls, and there's an old gray horse in the pasture&mdash;the same old
  gray horse that come out uh the wilderness&mdash;with a bad case uh
  string-halt. I'll have some uh the boys ketch him up and you can start a
  horsepital!"</p>

  <p>"Is that supposed to be a joke, J. G.? I never can tell <i>your</i> jokes
  by ear. If it is, I'll laugh. I'm going to use whatever I need and you can do
  without Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;those two men."</p>

  <p>"Oh, go ahead. The horse don't belong to <i>me</i>, so I'm willing you
  should practice on him a while. Say! Dell! Give him that truck you've been
  pouring down me for the last week. Maybe he'll relish the taste of the
  doggone stuff&mdash;I don't."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you've labeled <i>that</i> a 'Joke&mdash;please laugh here,'"
  sighed Miss Whitmore, plaintively, climbing gingerly down.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; AN IDEAL PICTURE.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I GUESS I'll go down to Denson's to-day," said J. G. at the
  breakfast table one morning. "Maybe we can get that grass widow to come and
  keep house for us."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any old grass widow to keep house," protested Della. "I'm
  getting along well enough, so long as Patsy bakes the bread, and meat, and
  cake, and stuff. It's just fun to keep house. The only trouble is, there
  isn't half enough to keep me busy. I'm going to get a license to practice
  medicine, so if there's any sickness around I can be of some use. You say
  it's fifty miles to the nearest doctor. But that needn't make a grass widow
  necessary. I can keep house&mdash;it looks better than when I came, and you
  know it." Which remark would have hurt the feelings of several well-meaning
  cow-punchers, had they overheard it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I ain't finding fault with your housekeeping&mdash;you do pretty well
  for a green hand. But Patsy'll have to go with the round-up when it starts,
  and what men I keep on the ranch will have to eat with us. That's the way
  I've been used to fixing things; I was never so good I couldn't eat at the
  same table with my men; if they wasn't fit for my company I fired 'em and got
  fellows that was. I've had this bunch a good long while, now. You can do all
  right with just me, but you couldn't cook for two or three men; you can't
  cook good enough, even if it wasn't too much work." J. G. had a blunt way of
  stating disagreeable facts, occasionally.</p>

  <p>"Very well, get your grass widow by all means," retorted she with much
  wasted dignity.</p>

  <p>"She's a swell cook, and a fine housekeeper, and she'll keep yuh from
  getting lonesome. She's good company, the Countess is." He grinned when he
  said it "I'll have Chip ketch up the creams, and you get ready and go along
  with us. It'll give you a chance to size up the kind uh neighbors yuh
  got."</p>

  <p>There was real pleasure in driving swiftly over the prairie land, through
  the sweet, spring sunshine, and Miss Whitmore tingled with enthusiasm till
  they drove headlong into a deep coulee which sheltered the Denson family.</p>

  <p>"This road is positively dangerous!" she exclaimed when they reached a
  particularly steep place and Chip threw all his weight upon the brake.</p>

  <p>"We'll get the Countess in beside yuh, coming back, and then yuh won't
  rattle around in the seat so much. She's good and solid&mdash; just hang onto
  her and you'll be all right," said J. G.</p>

  <p>"If I don't like her looks&mdash;and I know I won't&mdash;I'll get into
  the front seat and you can hang onto her yourself, Mr. J. G. Whitmore."</p>

  <p>Chip, who had been silent till now, glanced briefly over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It's a cinch you'll take the front seat," he remarked, laconically.</p>

  <p>"J. G., if you hire a woman like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Like what? Doggone it, it takes a woman to jump at conclusions! The
  Countess is all right. She talks some&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man she does!" broke in Chip, tersely.</p>

  <p>"Well, show me the woman that don't! Don't you be bluffed so easy, Dell. I
  never seen the woman yet that Chip had any time for. The Countess is all
  right, and she certainly can cook! I admit she talks consider'ble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chip laughed grimly, and the Old Man subsided.</p>

  <p>At the house a small, ginger-whiskered man came down to the gate to greet
  them.</p>

  <p>"Why, how&mdash;de-do! I couldn't make out who 't was comin', but Mary,
  she up an' rek'nized the horses. Git right out an' come on in! We've had our
  dinner, but I guess the wimmin folks can scare ye up a bite uh suthin'. This
  yer sister? We heard she was up t' your place. She the one that set one uh
  your horse's legs? Bill, he was tellin' about it. I dunno as wimmin horse
  doctors is very common, but I dunno why not. I get a horse with somethin' the
  matter of his foot, and I dunno what. I'd like t' have ye take a look at it,
  fore ye go. 'Course, I expect t' pay ye."</p>

  <p>The Old Man winked appreciatively at Chip before he came humanely to the
  rescue and explained that his sister was not a horse doctor, and Mr. Denson,
  looking very disappointed, reiterated his invitation to enter.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Denson, a large woman who narrowly escaped being ginger- whiskered
  like her husband, beamed upon them from the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Come right on in! Louise, here's comp'ny! The house is all tore
  up&mdash;we been tryin' t' clean house a little. Lay off yer things an' I'll
  git yuh some dinner right away. I'm awful glad yuh come over&mdash;I do hate
  t' see folks stand on cer'mony out here where neighbors is so skurce. I guess
  yuh think we ain't been very neighborly, but we been tryin' t' clean house,
  an' me an' Louise ain't had a minute we could dast call our own, er we'd a
  been over t' seen yuh before now. Yuh must git awful lonesome, comin' right
  out from the East where neighbors is thick. Do lay off yer things!"</p>

  <p>Della looked appealingly at J. G., who again came to the rescue. Somehow
  he made himself heard long enough to explain their errand, and to emphasize
  the fact that they were in a great hurry, and had eaten dinner before they
  started from home. In his sister's opinion he made one exceedingly rash
  statement. He said that he wished to hire Mrs. Denson's sister for the
  summer. Mrs. Denson immediately sent a shrill call for Louise.</p>

  <p>Then appeared the Countess, tall, gaunt and muscular, with sallow skin and
  a nervous manner.</p>

  <p>"The front seat or walk!" declared Miss Whitmore, mentally, after a brief
  scrutiny and began storing up a scathing rebuke for J. G.</p>

  <p>"Louise, this is Miss Whitmore," began Mrs. Denson, cheerfully, fortified
  by a fresh lungful of air. "They're after yuh t' go an' keep house for 'em,
  an' I guess yuh better go, seein' we got the house cleaned all but
  whitewashin' the cellar an' milk room an' kals'minin' the upstairs, an' I'll
  make Bill do that, an' 't won't hurt him a mite. They'll give yuh twenty-five
  dollars a month an' keep yuh all summer, an' as much longer as his sister
  stays. I guess yuh might as well go, fer they can't git anybody else that'll
  keep things up in shape an' be comp'ny fer his sister, an' I b'lieve in
  helpin' a neighbor out when yuh can. You go right an' pack up yer trunk, an'
  don't worry about me&mdash;I'll git along somehow, now the house-cleanin's
  most done."</p>

  <p>Louise had been talking also, but her sister seemed to have a stronger
  pair of lungs, for her voice drowned that of the Countess, who retreated to
  "pack up."</p>

  <p>The minutes dragged by, to the tune of several chapters of family history
  as voluminously interpreted by Mrs. Denson. Miss Whitmore had always boasted
  the best-behaved of nerves, but this day she developed a genuine case of
  "fidgets." Once she saw Chip's face turned inquiringly toward the window, and
  telegraphed her state of mind&mdash;while Mrs. Denson's back was
  turned&mdash;so eloquently that Chip was swept at once into sympathetic
  good-fellowship. He arranged the cushion on the front seat significantly, and
  was rewarded by an emphatic, though furtive, nod and smile. Whereupon he
  leaned comfortably back, rolled a cigarette and smoked contentedly, at peace
  with himself and the world&mdash;though he did not in the least know why.</p>

  <p>"An' as I told Louise, folks has got t' put up with things an' not be
  huntin' trouble with a club all the time, if they expect t' git any comfort
  out uh this life. We ain't had the best uh luck, seems t' me, but we always
  git along somehow, an' we ain't had no sickness except when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A confused uproar arose in the room above them, followed, immediately by a
  humpety bump and a crash as a small, pink object burst open a door and rolled
  precipitately into their midst. It proved to be one of the little Densons,
  who kicked feebly with both feet and then lay still.</p>

  <p>"Mercy upon us! Ellen, who pushed Sary down them stairs? She's kilt!"</p>

  <p>Della sprang up and lifted the child in her arms, passing her hand quickly
  over the head and plump body.</p>

  <p>"Bring a little cold water, Mrs. Denson. She's only stunned, I think."</p>

  <p>"Well, it does beat all how handy you go t' work. Anybody c'd see t' you
  know your business. I'm awful glad you was here&mdash;there, darlin', don't
  cry&mdash;Ellen, an' Josephine, an' Sybilly, an' Margreet, you come down here
  t' me!"</p>

  <p>The quartet, snuffling and reluctant, was dragged ignominiously to the
  middle of the floor and there confessed, 'mid tears and much recrimination,
  that they had been peeping down at the "comp'ny" through various knot-holes
  in the chamber floor; that, as Sary's knot-hole was next the wall, her range
  of vision was restricted to the thin spot upon the crown of J. G.'s head, and
  the back of his neck. Sary longed for sight of the woman horse doctor, and
  when she essayed to crowd in and usurp Ellen's point of vantage, there ensued
  a war of extermination which ended in the literal downfall of Sary.</p>

  <p>By the time this checked-apron court of inquiry adjourned, Louise appeared
  and said she believed she was ready, and Miss Whitmore escaped from the house
  far in advance of the others&mdash;and such were Chip's telepathic powers
  that he sprang down voluntarily and assisted her to the front seat without a
  word being said by either.</p>

  <p>Followed a week of dullness at the ranch, with the Countess scrubbing and
  dusting and cleaning from morning till night. The Little Doctor, as the bunk
  house had christened her, was away attending the State Medical Examination at
  Helena.</p>

  <p>"Gee-whiz!" sighed Cal on Sunday afternoon. "It seems mighty queer without
  the Little Doctor around here, sassing the Old Man and putting the hull bunch
  of us on the fence about once a day. If it wasn't for Len Adams&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't do you any good to throw a nasty loop at the Little Doctor,"
  broke in Weary, "'cause she's spoken for, by all signs and tokens. There's
  some fellow back East got a long rope on her."</p>

  <p>"You got the papers for that?" jeered Cal. "The Little Doctor don't act
  the way I'd want my girl t' act, supposin' I was some thousand or fifteen
  hundred miles off her range. She ain't doing no pining, I tell yuh
  those."</p>

  <p>"She's doing a lot of writing, though. I'll bet money, if we called the
  roll right here, you'd see there's been a letter a week hittin' the trail to
  one Dr. Cecil Granthum, Gilroy, Ohio."</p>

  <p>"That's what," agreed Jack Bates. "I packed one last week, myself."</p>

  <p>"I done worse than that," said Weary, blandly. "I up and fired a shot at
  her, after the second one she handed me. I says, as innocent: 'I s'pose, if I
  lost this, there'd be a fellow out on the next train with blood in his eye
  and a six-gun in both hands, demanding explanations'&mdash;and she flashed
  them dimples on me and twinkled them big, gray eyes of hers, and says: 'It's
  up to you to carry it safe, then,' or words to that effect. I took notice she
  didn't deny but what he would."</p>

  <p>"Two doctors in one family&mdash;gee whiz!" mused Cal. "If I hadn't got
  the only girl God ever made right, I'd give one Dr. Cecil Granthum, of
  Gilroy, Ohio, a run for his money, I tell yuh those. I'd impress it upon him
  that a man's taking long chances when he stands and lets his best girl
  stampede out here among us cow- punchers for a change uh grass. That fellow
  needs looking after; he ain't finished his education. Jacky, you ain't got a
  female girl yanking your heart around, sail in and show us what yuh can do in
  that line."</p>

  <p>"Nit," said Jack Bates, briefly. "My heart's doing business at the old
  stand and doing it satisfactory and proper. I don't want to set it to
  bucking&mdash;over a girl that wouldn't have me at any price. Let Slim. The
  Little Doctor's half stuck on him, anyhow."</p>

  <p>While the boys amused themselves in serious debate with Slim, Chip put
  away his magazine and went down to visit Silver in the box stall. He was glad
  they had not attempted to draw him into the banter&mdash;they had never once
  thought to do so, probably, though he had been thrown into the company of the
  Little Doctor more than any of the others, for several good reasons. He had
  broken the creams to harness, and always drove them, for the Old Man found
  them more than he cared to tackle. And there was Silver, with frequent
  discussions over his progress toward recovery and some argument over his
  treatment&mdash;for Chip had certain ideas of his own concerning horses, and
  was not backward about expressing them upon occasion.</p>

  <p>That the Little Doctor should write frequent letters to a man in the East
  did not concern him&mdash;why should it? Still, a fellow without a home and
  without some woman who cares for him, cannot escape having his loneliness
  thrust upon him at times. He wondered why he should care. Surely, ten years
  of living his life alone ought to kill that latent homesickness which used to
  hold him awake at nights. Sometimes even of late years, when he stood guard
  over the cattle at night, and got to thinking&mdash;oh, it was hell to be all
  alone in the world!</p>

  <p>There were Cal and Weary, they had girls who loved them&mdash;and they
  were sure welcome to them. And Jack Bates and Happy Jack had sisters and
  mothers&mdash;and even Slim had an old maid aunt who always knit him a red
  and green pair of wristlets for Christmas. Chip, smoothing mechanically the
  shimmery, white mane of his pet, thought he might be contented if he had even
  an old maid aunt&mdash; but he would see that she made his wristlets of some
  other color than those bestowed every year upon Slim.</p>

  <p>As for the Little Doctor, it would be something strange if she had gone
  through life without having some fellow in love with her. Probably, if the
  truth was known, there had been more than Dr. Cecil Granthum&mdash;bah, what
  a sickening name! Cecil! It might as well be Adolphus or Regie or&mdash;what
  does a man want to pack around a name like that for? Probably he was the kind
  of man that the name sounded like; a dude with pink cheeks.</p>

  <p>Chip knew just how he looked. Inspiration suddenly seizing upon him, he
  sat down upon the manger, drew his memorandum book out of his inner coat
  pocket, carefully sharpened a bit of lead pencil which he found in another
  pocket, tore a leaf from the book, and, with Silver looking over his
  shoulder, drew a graphic, ideal picture of Dr. Cecil Granthum.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; IN SILVER'S STALL.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"OH, are <i>you</i> here? It's a wonder you don't have your
  bed brought down here, so you can sleep near Silver. How has he been doing
  since I left?"</p>

  <p>Chip simply sat still upon the edge of the manger and stared. His gray hat
  was pushed far back upon his head and his dark hair waved and curled upon his
  forehead, very much as a girl's might have done. He did not know that he was
  a very good-looking young man, but perhaps the Little Doctor did. She smiled
  and came up and patted Silver, who had forgotten that he ever had objected to
  her nearness. He nickered a soft welcome and laid his nose on her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You've been drawing a picture. Who's the victim of your satirical pencil
  this time?" The Little Doctor, reaching out quickly, calmly appropriated the
  sketch before Chip had time to withdraw it, even if he had cared to do so. He
  was busy wondering how the Little Doctor came to be there at that particular
  time, and had forgotten the picture, which he had not quite finished
  labeling.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Cecil&mdash;" Miss Whitmore turned red at first, then broke into
  laughter. "Oh&mdash;h, ha! ha! ha! Silver, you don't know how funny this
  master of yours can be! Ha! ha!" She raised her head from Silver's neck,
  where it had rested, and wiped her eyes.</p>

  <p>"How did you know about Cecil?" she demanded of a very discomfited young
  man upon the manger.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know&mdash;and I didn't <i>want</i> to know. I heard the boys
  talking and joshing about him, and I just drew&mdash;their own conclusions."
  Chip grinned a little and whittled at his pencil, and wondered how much of
  the statement was a lie.</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore turned red again, and ended by laughing even more heartily
  than at first.</p>

  <p>"Their conclusions aren't very complimentary," she said. "I don't believe
  Dr. Cecil would feel flattered at this. Why those bowed legs, may I ask, and
  wherefore that long, lean, dyspeptic visage? Dr. Cecil, let me inform you,
  has a digestion that quails not at deviled crabs and chafing-dish horrors at
  midnight, as I have abundant reason to know. I have seen Dr. Cecil prepare a
  welsh rabbit and&mdash;eat it, also, with much relish, apparently. Oh, no,
  their conclusions weren't quite correct. There are other details I might
  mention&mdash;that cane, for instance&mdash;but let it pass. I shall keep
  this, I think, as a companion to 'The old maid's credential card.'"</p>

  <p>"Are you in the habit of keeping other folk's property?" inquired Chip,
  with some acerbity.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but personal caricatures&mdash;and hearts, perhaps," returned the
  Little Doctor, sweetly.</p>

  <p>"I hardly think your collection of the last named article is very large,"
  retorted Chip.</p>

  <p>"Still, I added to the collection to-day," pursued Miss Whitmore, calmly.
  "I shared my seat in the train with J. G.'s silent partner (I did not find
  him silent, however), Mr. Duncan Whitaker. He hired a team in Dry Lake and we
  came out together, and I believe&mdash;please don't mention Dr. Cecil
  Granthum to him, will you?"</p>

  <p>Chip wished, quite savagely, that she wouldn't let those dimples dodge
  into her cheeks, and the laugh dodge into her eyes, like that. It made a
  fellow uncomfortable. He was thoroughly disgusted with her&mdash;or he would
  be, if she would only stop looking like that. He was in that state of mind
  where his only salvation, seemingly, lay in quarreling with some one
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"So old Dunk's come back? If you've got his heart, you must have gone
  hunting it with a microscope, for it's a mighty small one&mdash; almost as
  small as his soul. No one else even knew he had one. You ought to have it set
  in a ring, so you won't lose it."</p>

  <p>"I don't wear phony jewelry, thank you," said Miss Whitmore, and Chip
  thought dimples weren't so bad after all.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor was weaving Silver's mane about her white fingers and
  meditating deeply. Chip wondered if she were thinking of Dr. Cecil.</p>

  <p>"Where did you learn to draw like that?" she asked, suddenly, turning
  toward him. "You do much better than I, and I've always been learning from
  good teachers. Did you ever try painting?"</p>

  <p>Chip blushed and looked away from her. This was treading close to his
  deep-hidden, inner self.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where I learned. I never took a lesson in my life, except
  from watching people and horses and the country, and remembering the lines
  they made, you know. I always made pictures, ever since I can
  remember&mdash;but I never tried colors very much. I never had a chance,
  working around cow-camps and on ranches."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have you look over some of my sketches and things&mdash; and
  I've paints and canvas, if you ever care to try that. Come up to the house
  some evening and I'll show you my daubs. They're none of them as good as 'The
  Old Maid.'"</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tear that thing up!" said Chip, vehemently.</p>

  <p>"Why? The likeness is perfect. One would think you were designer for a
  fashion paper, the way you got the tucks in my sleeve and the braid on my
  collar&mdash;and you might have had the kindness to <i>tell</i> me my hat was
  on crooked, I think!"</p>

  <p>There was a rustle in the loose straw, a distant slam of the stable door,
  and Chip sat alone with his horse, whittling abstractedly at his pencil till
  his knife blade grated upon the metal which held the eraser.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE HUM OF PREPARATION.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS WHITMORE ran down to the blacksmith shop, waving an
  official-looking paper in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I've got it, J. G.!"</p>

  <p>"Got what&mdash;smallpox?" J. G. did not even look up from the iron he was
  welding.</p>

  <p>"No, my license. I'm a really, truly doctor now, and you needn't laugh,
  either. You said you'd give a dance if I passed, and I did. Happy Jack
  brought it just now."</p>

  <p>"Brought the dance?" The Old Man gave the bellows a pull which sent a
  shower of sparks toward the really, truly doctor.</p>

  <p>"Brought the license," she explained, patiently. "You can see for
  yourself. They were awfully nice to me&mdash;they seemed to think a girl
  doctor is some kind of joke out here. They didn't make it any easier, though;
  they acted as if they didn't expect me to pass&mdash;but I did!"</p>

  <p>The Old Man rubbed one smutty hand down his trousers leg and extended it
  for the precious document. "Let me have a look at it," he said, trying to
  hide his pride in her.</p>

  <p>"Well, but I'll hold it. Your hands are dirty." Dr. Whitmore eyed the
  hands disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>The Old Man read it slowly through, growing prouder every line.</p>

  <p>"You're all right, Dell&mdash;I'll be doggoned if you ain't. Don't you
  worry about the dance&mdash;I'll see't yuh get it. You go tell the Countess
  to bake up a lot of cake and truck, and I'll send some uh the boys around t'
  tell the neighbors. Better have it Friday night, I guess&mdash;I'm goin t'
  start the round-up out early next week. Doggone it! I've gone and burned that
  weldin'. Go on and stop your botherin' me!"</p>

  <p>In two minutes the Little Doctor was back, breathless.</p>

  <p>"What about the music, J. G.? We want <i>good</i> music."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tend t' that part. Say! You can rig up that room off the
  dining room for your office&mdash;I s'pose you'll have to have one. You make
  out a list of what dope you want&mdash;and be sure yuh get a-plenty. I look
  for an unhealthy summer among the cow- punchers. If I ain't mistook in the
  symptoms, Dunk's got palpitation uh the heart right now&mdash;an' got it
  serious."</p>

  <p>The Old Man chuckled to himself and went back to his welding.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Louise!" The Little Doctor hurried to where the Countess was
  scrubbing the kitchen steps with soft soap and sand and considerable energy.
  "J. G. says I may have a dance next Friday night, so we must hurry and fix
  the house&mdash;only I don't see much fixing to be done; everything is
  <i>so</i> clean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there ain't a room in the house fit fer comp'ny t' walk into,"
  expostulated the Countess while she scrubbed. "I do like t' see a house clean
  when folks is expected that only come t' be critical an' make remarks behind
  yer back the minit they git away. If folks got anything t' say I'd a good
  deal ruther they said it t' my face an' be done with it. 'Yuh can know a
  man's face but yuh can't know his heart,' as the sayin' is, an' it's the same
  way with women&mdash;anyway, it's the same way with Mis' Beckman. You can
  know her face a mile off, but yuh never know who she's goin' t' rake over the
  coals next. As the sayin' is: 'The tongue of a woman, at last it biteth like
  a serpent an' it stingeth like an addle,' an' I guess it's so. Anyway, Mis'
  Beckman's does. I do b'lieve on my soul&mdash;what's the matter, Dell? What
  yuh laughin' at?"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor was past speech for the moment, and the Countess stood
  up and looked curiously around her. It never occurred to her that she might
  be the cause of that convulsive outburst.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;he&mdash;never mind&mdash;he's gone, now."</p>

  <p>"Who's gone?" persisted the Countess.</p>

  <p>"What kinds of cake do you think we ought to have?" asked the Little
  Doctor, diplomatically.</p>

  <p>The Countess sank to her knees and dipped a handful of amber, jelly-like
  soap from a tin butter can.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know. I s'pose folks will look for something fancy, seein'
  you're givin' the dance. Mis' Beckman sets herself up as a shinin' example on
  cake, and she'll come just t' be critical an' find fault, if she can. If I
  can't bake all around her the best day she ever seen, I'll give up cookin'
  anything but spuds. She had the soggiest kind uh jelly roll t' the su'prise
  on Mary last winter. I know it was hern, fer I seen her bring it in, an' I
  went straight an' ondone it. I guess it was kinda mean uh me, but I don't
  care&mdash;as the sayin' is: 'What's sass fer the goose is good enough sass
  fer anybody'&mdash;an' she done the same trick by me, at the su'prise at
  Adamses last fall. But she couldn't find no kick about <i>my</i> cake, an'
  hers&mdash;yuh c'd of knocked a cow down with it left-handed! If that's the
  best she c'n do on cake I'd advise 'er to keep the next batch t' home where
  they're used to it. They say't 'What's one man's meat 's pizen t' the other
  feller,' and I guess it's so enough. Maybe Mame an' the rest uh them Beckman
  kids can eat sech truck without comin' down in a bunch with gastakutus, but
  I'd hate t' tackle it myself."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor gurgled. This was a malady which had not been mentioned
  at the medical college.</p>

  <p>"Where shall we set the tables, if we dance in the dining room?" she
  asked, having heard enough of the Beckmans for the present.</p>

  <p>"Why, we won't set any tables. Folks always have a lap supper at ranch
  dances. At the su'prise on Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is a lap supper?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my stars alive! Where under the shinin' sun was you brought up if
  yuh never heard of a lap supper? A lap supper is where folks set around the
  walls&mdash;or any place they can find&mdash;and take the plates on their
  laps and yuh pass 'em stuff. The san'wiches&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You do make such beautiful bread!" interrupted the Little Doctor, very
  sincerely.</p>

  <p>"Well, I ain't had the best uh luck, lately, but I guess it does taste
  good after that bread yuh had when I come. Soggy was no name for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Patsy made that bread," interposed Miss Whitmore, hastily. "He had bad
  luck, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I guess he did!" sniffed the Countess, contemptuously. "As I told Mary
  when I come&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wonder how many cakes we'll need?" Miss Whitmore, you will observe, had
  learned to interrupt when she had anything to say. It was the only course to
  pursue with anyone from Denson coulee.</p>

  <p>The Countess, having finished her scrubbing, rose jerkily and upset the
  soap can, which rolled over and over down the steps, leaving a yellow trail
  as it went.</p>

  <p>"Well, there, if that wasn't a bright trick uh mine? They say the more yuh
  hurry the less yuh'll git along, an' that's a sample. We'd ought t' have five
  kinds, an' about four uh each kind. It wouldn't do t' run out, er Mis'
  Beckman never would let anybody hear the last of it. Down t'
  Mary's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Twenty cakes! Good gracious! I'll have to order my stock of medicine, for
  I'll surely have a houseful of patients if the guests eat twenty cakes."</p>

  <p>"Well, as the sayin' is: 'Patience an' perseverance can git away with most
  anything,'" observed the Countess, naively.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor retired behind her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"My stars alive, I do b'lieve my bread's beginnin' t' scorch!" cried the
  Countess, and ran to see. The Little Doctor followed her inside and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"We must make a list of the things we'll need, Louise. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dell! Oh-h. Dell!" The voice of the Old Man resounded from the
  parlor.</p>

  <p>"I'm in the kitchen!" called she, remaining where she was. He tramped
  heavily through the house to her.</p>

  <p>"I'll send the rig in, t'morrow, if there's anything yuh want," he
  remarked. "And if you'll make out a list uh dope, I'll send the order in t'
  the Falls. We've got plenty uh saws an' cold chisels down in the blacksmith
  shop&mdash;you can pick out what yuh want." He dodged and grinned. "Got any
  cake, Countess?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there ain't a thing cooked, hardly. I'm going t' bake up something
  right after dinner. Here's some sponge cake&mdash;but it ain't fit t' eat,
  hardly. I let Dell look in the oven, 'cause my han's was all over flour, an'
  she slammed the door an' it fell. But yuh can't expect one person t' know
  everything&mdash;an' too many han's can't make decent soup, as the sayin' is,
  an' it's the same way with cake."</p>

  <p>The Old Man winked at the Little Doctor over a great wedge of feathery
  delight. "I don't see nothing the matter with this&mdash;only it goes down
  too easy," he assured the Countess between mouthfuls. "Fix up your list,
  Dell, and don't be afraid t' order everything yuh need. I'll foot
  the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Old Man, thinking to go back to his work, stepped into the puddle of
  soft soap and sat emphatically down upon the top step, coasting rapidly to
  the bottom. A carpet slipper shot through the open door and landed in the
  dishpan; the other slipper disappeared mysteriously. The wedge of cake was
  immediately pounced upon by an investigative hen and carried in triumph to
  her brood.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" J. G. struggled painfully to his feet. "Dell, who in thunder
  put that stuff there? You're a little too doggoned anxious for somebody t'
  practice on, seems t' me." A tiny trickle of blood showed in the thin spot on
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt, J. G.? We&mdash;I spilled the soap." The Little Doctor
  gazed solicitous, from the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Huh! I see yuh spilled the soap, all right enough. I'm willin' to believe
  yuh did without no affidavit. Doggone it, a bachelor never has any such a
  man-trap around in a fellow's road. I've lived in Montana fourteen years, an'
  I never slipped up on my own doorstep till you got here. It takes a woman t'
  leave things around&mdash;where's my cake?"</p>

  <p>"Old Specie took it down by the bunk house. Shall I go after it?"</p>

  <p>"No, you needn't. Doggone it, this wading through ponds uh soft soap has
  got t' stop right here. I never had t' do it when I was baching, I notice."
  He essayed, with the aid of a large splinter, to scrape the offending soap
  from his trousers.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, you didn't. Bachelors never use soap," retorted Della.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they don't, hey? That's all you know about it. They don't use this
  doggoned, slimy truck, let me tell yuh. What d'yuh want, Chip? Oh, you've got
  t' grin, too! Dell, why don't yuh do something fer my head? What's your
  license good f er, I'd like t' know? You didn't see Dell's license, did yuh,
  Chip? Go and get it an' show it to him, Dell. It's good fer everything but
  gitting married&mdash;there ain't any cure for that complaint."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; LOVE AND A STOMACH PUMP.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AN electrical undercurrent of expectation pervaded the very
  atmosphere of Flying U ranch. The musicians, two supercilious but undeniably
  efficient young men from Great Falls, had arrived two hours before and were
  being graciously entertained by the Little Doctor up at the house. The
  sandwiches stood waiting, the coffee was ready for the boiling water, and the
  dining-room floor was smooth as wax could make it.</p>

  <p>For some reason unknown to himself, Chip was "in the deeps." He even
  threatened to stop in the bunk house and said he didn't feel like dancing,
  but was brought into line by weight of numbers. He hated Dick Brown, anyway,
  for his cute, little yellow mustache that curled up at the ends like the tail
  of a drake. He had snubbed him all the way out from town and handled Dick's
  guitar with a recklessness that invited disaster. And the way Dick smirked
  when the Old Man introduced him to the Little Doctor&mdash;a girl with a
  fellow in the East oughtn't to let her eyes smile that way at a pin-headed
  little dude like Dick Brown, anyway. And he&mdash;Chip&mdash;had given her a
  letter postmarked blatantly: "Gilroy, Ohio, 10:30 P. M."&mdash;and she had
  been so taken up with those cussed musicians that she couldn't even thank
  him, and only just glanced at the letter before she stuck it inside her belt.
  Probably she wouldn't even read it till after the dance. He wondered if Dr.
  Cecil Granthum cared&mdash;oh, hell! Of <i>course</i> he cared&mdash;that is,
  if he had any sense at all. But the Little Doctor&mdash;she wasn't above
  flirting, he noticed. If <i>he</i> ever fell in love with a girl&mdash;which
  the Lord forbid&mdash;he'd take mighty good care she didn't get time to make
  dimples and smiles for some other fellow to go to heaven looking at.</p>

  <p>There, that was her, laughing like she always laughed&mdash;it reminded
  him of pines nodding in a canyon and looking wise and whispering things
  they'd seen and heard before you were born, and of water falling over rocks,
  somehow. Queer, maybe&mdash;but it did. He wondered if Dick Brown had been
  trying to say something funny. He didn't see, for the life of him, how the
  Little Doctor could laugh at that little imitation man. Girls are&mdash;well,
  they're easy pleased, most of them.</p>

  <p>Down in the bunk house the boys were hurrying into their "war
  togs"&mdash;which is, being interpreted, their best clothes. There was a
  nervous scramble over the cracked piece of a bar mirror&mdash;which had a
  history&mdash;and cries of "Get out!" "Let me there a minute, can't yuh?" and
  "Get up off my coat!" were painfully frequent.</p>

  <p>Happy Jack struggled blindly with a refractory red tie, which his face
  rivaled in hue and sheen&mdash;for he had been generous of soap.</p>

  <p>Weary had possessed himself of the glass and was shaving as leisurely as
  though four restive cow-punchers were not waiting anxiously their turn.</p>

  <p>"For the Lord's sake, Weary!" spluttered Jack Bates. "Your whiskers grow
  faster'n you can shave 'em off, at that gait. Get a move on, can't yuh?"</p>

  <p>Weary turned his belathered face sweetly upon Jack. "Getting in a hurry,
  Jacky? <i>your</i> girl won't be there, and nobody else's girl is going to
  have time to see whether you shaved to-day or last Christmas. You don't want
  to worry so much about your looks, none of you. I hate to say it, but you act
  vain, all of you kids. Honest, I'm ashamed. Look at that gaudy countenance
  Happy's got on&mdash;and his necktie's most as bad." He stropped his razor
  with exasperating nicety, stopping now and then to test its edge upon a hair
  from his own brown head.</p>

  <p>Happy Jack, grown desperate over his tie and purple over Weary's remarks,
  craned his neck over the shoulder of that gentleman and leered into the
  mirror. When Happy liked, he could contort his naturally plain features into
  a diabolical grin which sent prickly waves creeping along the spine of the
  beholder.</p>

  <p>Weary looked, stared, half rose from his chair.</p>

  <p>"Holy smithereens! Quit it, Happy! You look like the devil by
  lightning."</p>

  <p>Happy, watching, seized the hand that held the razor; Cal, like a cat,
  pounced upon the mirror, and Jack Bates deftly wrenched the razor from
  Weary's fingers.</p>

  <p>"Whoopee, boys! Some of you tie Weary down and set on him while I shave,"
  cried Cal, jubilant over the mutiny. "We'll make short work of this toilet
  business."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Weary was borne to the floor, bound hand and foot with silk
  handkerchiefs, carried bodily and laid upon his bed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the things I won't do to you for this!" he asserted, darkly. "There
  won't nary a son-of-a-gun uh yuh get a dance from my little
  schoolma'am&mdash;you'll see!" He grinned prophetically, closed his eyes and
  murmured: "Call me early, mother dear," and straightway fell away into
  slumber and peaceful snoring, while the lather dried upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Better turn Weary loose and wake him up, Chip," suggested Jack Bates,
  half an hour later, shoving the stopper into his cologne bottle and making
  for the door. "At the rate the rigs are rolling in, it'll take us all to put
  up the teams." The door slammed behind him as it had done behind the others
  as they hurried away.</p>

  <p>"Here!" Chip untied Weary's hands and feet and took him by the shoulder.
  "Wake up, Willie, if you want to be Queen o' the May."</p>

  <p>Weary sat up and rubbed his eyes. "Confound them two Jacks! What time is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"A little after eight. <i>Your</i> crowd hasn't come yet, so you needn't
  worry. I'm not going up yet for a while, myself."</p>

  <p>"You're off your feed. Brace up and take all there is going, my son."
  Weary prepared to finish his interrupted beautification.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to&mdash;all the bottles, that is. If that Dry Lake gang comes
  loaded down with whisky, like they generally do, we ought to get hold of it
  and cache every drop, Weary."</p>

  <p>Weary turned clear around to stare his astonishment.</p>

  <p>"When did the W. C. T. U. get you by the collar?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Aw, don't be a fool, Weary," retorted Chip. "You can see it wouldn't look
  right for us to let any of the boys get full, or even half shot, seeing this
  is the Little Doctor's dance."</p>

  <p>Weary meditatively scraped his left jaw and wiped the lather from the
  razor upon a fragment of newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Splinter, we've throwed in together ever since we drifted onto the same
  range, and I'm with you, uh course. But&mdash;don't overlook Dr. Cecil
  Granthum. I'd hate like the devil to see you git throwed down, because it'd
  hurt you worse than anybody I know."</p>

  <p>Chip calmly sifted some tobacco into a cigarette paper. His mouth was very
  straight and his brows very close together.</p>

  <p>"It's a devilish good thing it was <i>you</i> said that, Weary. If it had
  been anyone else I'd punch his face for him."</p>

  <p>"Why, yes&mdash;an' I'd help you, too." Weary, his mouth very much on one
  side of his face that he might the easier shave the other, spoke in
  fragments. "You don't take it amiss from&mdash;me, though. I can
  see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door slammed with extreme violence, and Weary slashed his chin
  unbecomingly in consequence, but he felt no resentment toward Chip. He calmly
  stuck a bit of paper on the cut to stop the bleeding and continued to
  shave.</p>

  <p>A short time after, the Little Doctor came across Chip glaring at Dick
  Brown, who was strumming his guitar with ostentatious ease upon an inverted
  dry-goods box at one end of the long dining room.</p>

  <p>"I came to ask a favor of you," she said, "but my courage oozed at the
  first glance."</p>

  <p>"It's hard to believe your courage would ooze at anything. What's the
  favor?"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor bent her head and lowered her voice to a confidential
  undertone which caught at Chip's blood and set it leaping.</p>

  <p>"I want you to come and help me turn my drug store around with its face to
  the wall. All the later editions of Denson, Pilgreen and Beckman have taken
  possession of my office&mdash;and as the Countess says: 'Them Beckman kids is
  holy terrors&mdash;an' it's savin' the rod an' spoilin' the kid that makes
  'em so!'"</p>

  <p>Chip laughed outright. "The Denson kids are a heap worse, if she only knew
  it," he said, and followed her willingly.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor's "office" was a homey little room, with a couch, a
  well-worn Morris rocker, two willow chairs and a small table for the not
  imposing furnishing, dignified by a formidable stack of medical books in one
  corner, and the "drug store," which was simply a roomy bookcase filled with
  jars, bottles, boxes and packages, all labeled in a neat vertical hand.</p>

  <p>The room fairly swarmed with children, who seemed, for the most part, to
  be enjoying themselves very much. Charlotte May Pilgreen and Sary Denson were
  hunched amicably over one of the books, shuddering beatifically over a
  pictured skeleton. A swarm surrounded the drug store, the glass door of which
  stood open.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor flew across to the group, horror white.</p>

  <p>"Sybilly got the key an' unlocked it, an' she give us this candy, too!"
  tattled a Pilgreen with very red hair and a very snub nose.</p>

  <p>"I didn't, either! It was Jos'phine!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, you big story-teller! I never tetched it!"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor clutched the nearest arm till the owner of it
  squealed.</p>

  <p>"How many of you have eaten some of these? Tell the truth, now." They
  quailed before her sternness&mdash;quailed and confessed. All told, seven had
  swallowed the sweet pellets, in numbers ranging from two to a dozen more.</p>

  <p>"Is it poison?" Chip whispered the question in the ear of the perturbed
  Little Doctor.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but it will make them exceedingly uncomfortable for a
  time&mdash; I'm going to pump them out."</p>

  <p>"Good shot! Serves 'em right, the little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All of you who have eaten this&mdash;er&mdash;candy, must come with me.
  The rest of you may stay here and play, but you must <i>not</i> touch this
  case."</p>

  <p>"Yuh going t' give 'em a lickin'?" Sary Denson wetted a finger copiously
  before turning a leaf upon the beautiful skeleton.</p>

  <p>"Never mind what I'm going to do to them&mdash;you had better keep out of
  mischief yourself, however. Mr. Bennett, I wish you would get some fellow you
  can trust&mdash;some one who won't talk about this afterward&mdash;turn this
  case around so that it will be safe, and then come to the back
  bedroom&mdash;the one off the kitchen. And tell Louise I want her, will you,
  please?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get old Weary. Yes, I'll send the Countess&mdash;but don't you think
  she's a mighty poor hand to keep a secret?"</p>

  <p>"I can't help it&mdash;I need her. Hurry, please."</p>

  <p>Awed by the look in her big, gray eyes and the mysterious summoning of
  help, the luckless seven were marched silently through the outer door, around
  the house, through the coal shed and so into the back bedroom, without being
  observed by the merrymakers, who shook the house to its foundation to the
  cheerful command: "Gran' right 'n' left with a double <i>elbow-W</i>!"
  "Chasse by yer pardner&mdash;balance&mdash;<i>swing</i>!"</p>

  <p>"What under the shinin' sun's the matter, Dell?" The Countess, breathless
  from dancing, burst in upon the little group.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very serious, Louise, though it's rather uncomfortable to be
  called from dancing to administer heroic remedies by wholesale. Can you hold
  Josephine&mdash;whichever one that is? She ate the most, as nearly as I can
  find out."</p>

  <p>"She ain't gone an' took pizen, has she? What was it&mdash;strychnine?
  I'll bet them Beckman kids put 'er up to it. Yuh goin' t' give 'er an
  anticdote?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to use this." The Little Doctor held up a fearsome thing to
  view. "Open your mouth, Josephine."</p>

  <p>Josephine refused; her refusal was emphatic and unequivocal, punctuated by
  sundry kicks directed at whoever came within range of her stout little
  shoes.</p>

  <p>"It ain't no use t' call Mary in&mdash;Mary can't handle her no better'n I
  can&mdash;an' not so good. Jos'phine, yuh got&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here's where we shine," broke in a cheery voice which was sweet to the
  ears, just then. "Chip and I ain't wrassled with bronks all our lives for
  nothing. This is dead easy&mdash;all same branding calves. Ketch hold of her
  heels, Splinter&mdash;that's the talk. Countess, you better set your back
  against that door&mdash;some of these dogies is thinking of taking a sneak on
  us&mdash;and we'd have t' go some, to cut 'em out uh that bunch out there and
  corral 'em again. There yuh are, Doctor&mdash;sail in."</p>

  <p>Upheld mentally by the unfailing sunniness of Weary and the calm
  determination of Chip, to whom flying heels and squirming bodies were as
  nothing, or at most a mere trifle, the Little Doctor set to work with a
  thoroughness and dispatch which struck terror to the hearts of the guilty
  seven.</p>

  <p>It did not take long&mdash;as Weary had said, it was very much like
  branding calves. No sooner was one child made to disgorge and laid, limp and
  subdued, upon the bed, than Chip and Weary seized another dexterously by
  heels and head. The Countess did nothing beyond guarding the door and acting
  as chaperon to the undaunted Little Doctor; but she did her duty and held her
  tongue afterward&mdash;which was a great deal for her to do.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor sat down in a chair, when it was all over, looking
  rather white. Chip moved nearer, though there was really nothing that he
  could do beyond handing her a glass of water, which she accepted
  gratefully.</p>

  <p>Weary held a little paper trough of tobacco in his fingers and drew the
  tobacco sack shut with his teeth. His eyes were fixed reflectively upon the
  bed. He placed the sack absently in his pocket, still meditating other
  things.</p>

  <p>"She answered: 'We are seven,'" he quoted softly and solemnly, and the
  Little Doctor forgot her faintness in a hearty laugh.</p>

  <p>"You two go back to your dancing now," she commanded, letting the dimples
  stand in her cheeks in a way that Chip dreamed about afterward. "I don't know
  what I should have done without you&mdash;a cow-puncher seems born to meet
  emergencies in just the right way. <i>Please</i> don't tell anyone, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Never. Don't you worry about us, Doctor. Chip and I don't set up nights
  emptying our brains out our mouths. We don't tell our secrets to nobody but
  our horses&mdash;and they're dead safe."</p>

  <p>"You needn't think I'll tell, either," said the Countess, earnestly. "I
  ain't forgot how you took the blame uh that sof' soap, Dell. As the sayin'
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Weary closed the door then, so they did not hear the saying which seemed
  to apply to this particular case. His arm hooked into Chip's, he led the way
  through the kitchen and down the hill to the hay corral. Once safe from
  observation, he threw himself into the sweetly pungent "blue-joint" and
  laughed and laughed.</p>

  <p>Chip's nervous system did not demand the relief of cachinnation. He went
  away to Silver's stall and groped blindly to the place where two luminous,
  green moons shone upon him in the darkness. He rubbed the delicate nose
  gently and tangled his fingers in the dimly gleaming mane, as he had seen
  <i>her</i> do. Such pink little fingers they were! He laid his brown cheek
  against the place where he remembered them to have rested.</p>

  <p>"Silver horse," he whispered, "if I ever fall in love with a
  girl&mdash;which isn't likely!&mdash;I'll want her to have dimples and big,
  gray eyes and a laugh like&mdash;"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; PRESCRIPTIONS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was Sunday, the second day after the dance. The boys were
  scattered, for the day was delicious&mdash;one of those sweet, soft days
  which come to us early in May. Down in the blacksmith shop Chip was putting
  new rowels into his spurs and whistling softly to himself while he
  worked.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor had gone with him to visit Silver that morning, and had
  not hurried away, but had leaned against the manger and listened while he
  told her of the time Silver, swimming the river when it was "up," had
  followed him to the Shonkin camp when Chip had thought to leave him at home.
  And they had laughed together over the juvenile seven and the subsequent
  indignation of the mothers who, with the exception of "Mary," had bundled up
  their offspring and gone home mad. True, they had none of them thoroughly
  understood the situation, having only the version of the children, who
  accused the Little Doctor of trying to make them eat rubber&mdash;"just cause
  she was mad about some little old candy." The mystification of the others
  among the Happy Family, who scented a secret with a joke to it but despaired
  of wringing the truth from either Weary or Chip, was dwelt upon with much
  enjoyment by the Little Doctor.</p>

  <p>It was a good old world and a pleasant, and Chip had no present quarrel
  with fate&mdash;or with anybody else. That was why he whistled.</p>

  <p>Then voices reached him through the open door, and a
  laugh&mdash;<i>her</i> laugh. Chip smiled sympathetically, though he had not
  the faintest notion of the cause of her mirth. As the voices drew nearer, the
  soft, smooth, hated tones of Dunk Whitaker untangled from the Little Doctor's
  laugh, and Chip stopped whistling. Dunk was making a good, long stay of it
  this time; usually he came one day and went the next, and no one grieved at
  his departure.</p>

  <p>"You find them an entirely new species, of course. How do you get on with
  them?" said Dunk.</p>

  <p>And the Little Doctor answered him frankly and distinctly: "Oh, very well,
  considering all things. They furnish me with some amusement, and I give them
  something quite new to talk about, so we are quits. They are a good-hearted
  lot, you know&mdash;but <i>so</i> ignorant! I don't suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The words trailed into an indistinct murmur, punctuated by Dunk's jarring
  cackle.</p>

  <p>Chip did not resume his whistling, though he might have done so if he had
  heard a little more, or a little less. As a matter of fact, it was the
  Densons, and the Pilgreens, and the Beckmans that were under discussion, and
  not the Flying U cowboys, as Chip believed. He no longer smiled
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"We furnish her with some amusement, do we? That's good! We're a
  good-hearted lot, but <i>so</i> ignorant! The devil we are!" He struck the
  rivet such a blow that he snapped one shank of his spur short off. This meant
  ten or twelve dollars for a new pair&mdash;though the cost of it troubled him
  little, just then. It was something tangible upon which to pour profanity,
  however, and the atmosphere grew sulphurous in the vicinity of the blacksmith
  shop and remained so for several minutes, after which a tall, irate
  cow-puncher with his hat pulled low over angry eyes left the shop and strode
  up the path to the deserted bunk house.</p>

  <p>He did not emerge till the Old Man called to him to ride down to Benson's
  after one of the Flying U horses which had broken out of the pasture.</p>

  <p>Della was looking from the window when Chip rode up the hill upon the
  "coulee trail," which passed close by the house. She was tired of the
  platitudes of Dunk, who, trying to be both original and polished, fell far
  short of being either and only succeeded in being extremely tiresome.</p>

  <p>"Where's Chip going, J. G.?" she demanded, in a proprietary tone.</p>

  <p>"Down t' Benson's after a horse." J. G. spoke lazily, without taking his
  pipe from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wish I could go&mdash;I wonder if he'd care." The Little Doctor
  spoke impulsively as was her habit.</p>

  <p>"'Course he wouldn't. Hey, Chip! Hold on a minute!" The Old Man stood
  waving his pipe in the doorway.</p>

  <p>Chip jerked his horse to a stand-still and half turned in the saddle.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Dell wants t' go along. Will yuh saddle up Concho for 'er? There's no
  hurry, anyhow, you've got plenty uh time. Dell's afraid one uh the kids might
  fall downstairs ag'in, and she'd miss the case."</p>

  <p>"I'm not, either," said the Little Doctor, coming to stand by her brother;
  "it's too nice a day to stay inside, and my muscles ache for a gallop over
  the hills."</p>

  <p>Chip did not look up at her; he did not dare. He felt that, if he met her
  eyes&mdash;with the laugh in them&mdash;he should do one of two undesirable
  things: he should either smile back at her, weakly overlooking the hypocrisy
  of her friendliness, or sneer in answer to her smile, which would be very
  rude and ungentlemanly.</p>

  <p>"If you had mentioned wanting a ride I should have been glad to accompany
  you," remarked Dunk, reproachfully, when Chip had ridden, somewhat sullenly,
  back to the stable.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think of it before&mdash;thank you," said the Little Doctor,
  lightly, and hurried away to put on her blue riding habit with its cunning
  little jockey cap which she found the only headgear that would stay upon her
  head in the teeth of Montana wind, and which made her look-well, kissable.
  She was standing on the porch drawing on her gauntlets when Chip returned,
  leading Concho by the bridle.</p>

  <p>"Let me help you," begged Dunk, at her elbow, hoping till the last that
  she would invite him to go with them.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor, not averse to hiding the bitter of her medicine under a
  coating of sugar, smiled sweetly upon him, to the delectation of Dunk and the
  added bitterness of Chip, who was rapidly nearing that state of mind which is
  locally described as being "strictly on the fight."</p>

  <p>"I expect she thinks I'll amuse her some more!" he thought, savagely, as
  they galloped away through the quivering sunlight.</p>

  <p>For the first two miles the road was level, and Chip set the
  pace&mdash;which was, as he intended it should be, too swift for much speech.
  After that the trail climbed abruptly out of Flying U coulee, and the horses
  were compelled to walk. Then it was that Chip's native chivalry and
  self-mastery were put to test.</p>

  <p>He was hungry for a solitary ride such as had, before now, drawn much of
  the lonely ache out of his heart and keyed him up to the life which he must
  live and which chafed his spirit more than even he realized. Instead of such
  slender comfort, he was forced to ride beside the girl who had hurt
  him&mdash;so close that his knee sometimes brushed her horse&mdash;and to
  listen to her friendly chatter and make answer, at times, with at least some
  show of civility.</p>

  <p>She was talking reminiscently of the dance.</p>

  <p>"J. G. showed splendid judgment in his choice of musicians, didn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>Chip looked straight ahead. This was touching a sore place in his memory.
  A vision of Dick Brown's vapid smile and curled up mustache rose before
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man," he said, with faint irony.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor gave him a quick, surprised look and went on.</p>

  <p>"I liked their playing so much. Mr. Brown was especially good upon the
  guitar."</p>

  <p>"Y&mdash;e-s?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. You know yourself, he plays beautifully."</p>

  <p>"Cow-punchers aren't expected to know all these things." Chip hated
  himself for replying so, but the temptation mastered him.</p>

  <p>"Aren't they? I can't see why not."</p>

  <p>Chip closed his lips tightly to keep in something impolite.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor, puzzled as well as piqued, went straight to the
  point.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you like Mr. Brown's playing?"</p>

  <p>"Did I say I didn't like it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you&mdash;not exactly, but you implied that you did not."</p>

  <p>"Y&mdash;e-s?"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor gave the reins an impatient twitch.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;<i>yes</i>!"</p>

  <p>No answer from Chip. He could think of nothing to say that was not more or
  less profane.</p>

  <p>"I think he's a very nice, amiable young man"&mdash;strong emphasis upon
  the second adjective. "I like amiable young men."</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"He's going to come down here hunting next fall. J. G. invited him."</p>

  <p>"Yes? What does he expect to find?"</p>

  <p>"Why, whatever there is to hunt. Chickens
  and&mdash;er&mdash;deer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>By this they reached the level and the horses broke, of their own accord,
  into a gallop which somewhat relieved the strain upon the mental atmosphere.
  At the next hill the Little Doctor looked her companion over critically.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bennett, you look positively bilious. Shall I prescribe for you?"</p>

  <p>"I can't see how that would add to your amusement."</p>

  <p>"I'm not trying to add to my amusement."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"If I were, there's no material at hand. Bad-tempered young men are never
  amusing, to me. I like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Amiable young men. Such as Dick Brown."</p>

  <p>"I think you need a change of air, Mr. Bennett."</p>

  <p>"Yes? I've felt, lately, that Eastern airs don't agree with my
  constitution."</p>

  <p>Miss Whitmore grew red as to cheeks and bright as to eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think a few small doses of Eastern manners would improve you very
  much," she said, pointedly.</p>

  <p>"Y&mdash;e-s? They'd have to be small, because the supply is very
  limited."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor grew white around the mouth. She held Concho's rein so
  tight he almost stopped.</p>

  <p>"If you didn't want me to come, why in the world didn't you have the
  courage to say so at the start? I must say I don't admire people whose
  tempers&mdash;and manners&mdash;are so unstable. I'm sorry I forced my
  presence upon you, and I promise you it won't occur again." She hesitated,
  and then fired a parting shot which certainly was spiteful in the extreme.
  "There's one good thing about it," she smiled, tartly, "I shall have
  something interesting to write to Dr. Cecil."</p>

  <p>With that she turned astonished Concho short around in the trail- -and as
  Chip gave Blazes a vicious jab with his spurs at the same instant, the
  distance between them widened rapidly.</p>

  <p>As Chip raced away over the prairie, he discovered a new and puzzling kink
  in his temper. He had been angry with the Little Doctor for coming, but it
  was nothing to the rage he felt when she turned back! He did not own to
  himself that he wanted her beside him to taunt and to hurt with his rudeness,
  but it was a fact, for all that. And it was a very surly young man who rode
  into the Denson corral and threw a loop over the head of the runaway.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; BEFORE THE ROUND-UP.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THE Little Doctor wants us all to come up t' the White
  House this evening and have some music," announced Cal, bursting into the
  bunk house where the boys were sorting and packing their belongings ready to
  start with the round-up wagon in the morning.</p>

  <p>Jack Bates hurriedly stuffed a miscellaneous collection of socks and
  handkerchiefs into his war bag and made for the wash basin.</p>

  <p>"I'll just call her bluff," he said, determinedly.</p>

  <p>"It ain't any bluff; she wants us t' come, er you bet she wouldn't say so.
  I've learned that much about her. Say, you'd a died to seen old Dunk look
  down his nose! I'll bet money she done it just t' rasp his feelin's&mdash;and
  she sure succeeded. I'd go anyway, now, just t' watch him squirm."</p>

  <p>"I notice it grinds him consider'ble to see the Little Doctor treat us
  fellows like white folks. He's workin' for a stand-in there himself. I bet he
  gets throwed down good and hard," commented Weary, cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"It's a cinch he don't know about that pill-thrower back in Ohio," added
  Cal. "Any of you fellows going to take her bid? I'll go alone, in a
  minute."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you'll go alone," asserted Jack Bates, grabbing his
  hat.</p>

  <p>Slim made a few hasty passes at his hair and said he was ready. Shorty,
  who had just come in from riding, unbuckled his spurs and kicked them under
  his bed.</p>

  <p>"It'll be many a day b'fore we listen t' the Little Doctor's mandolin
  ag'in," croaked Happy Jack.</p>

  <p>"Aw, shut up!" admonished Cal.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Chip," sang out Weary. "You can spoil good paper when you can't
  do anything else. Come and size up the look on Dunk's face when we take
  possession of all the best chairs and get t' pouring our incense and
  admiration on the Little Doctor."</p>

  <p>Chip took the cigarette from his lips and emptied his lungs of smoke. "You
  fellows go on. I'm not going." He bent again to his eternal drawing.</p>

  <p>"The dickens you ain't!" Weary was too astounded to say more.</p>

  <p>Chip said nothing. His gray hat-brim shielded his face from view, save for
  the thin, curved lips and firm chin. Weary studied chin and lips curiously,
  and whatever he read there, he refrained from further argument. He knew Chip
  so much better than did anyone else.</p>

  <p>"Aw, what's the matter with yuh, Splinter! Come on; don't be a chump,"
  cried Cal, from the doorway.</p>

  <p>"I guess you'll let a fellow do as he likes about it, won't you?" queried
  Chip, without looking up. He was very busy, just then, shading the shoulders
  of a high-pitching horse so that one might see the tense muscles.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? You and the Little Doctor have a falling out?"</p>

  <p>"Not very bad," Chip's tone was open to several interpretations. Cal
  interpreted it as a denial.</p>

  <p>"Sick?" He asked next.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" said Chip, shortly and falsely.</p>

  <p>"We'll call the doctor in, then," volunteered Jack Bates.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you will. When I'm sick enough for that I'll let you know.
  I'm going to bed."</p>

  <p>"Aw, come on and let him alone. Chip's able t' take care of himself, I
  guess," said Weary, mercifully, holding open the door.</p>

  <p>They trooped out, and the last heard of them was Cal, remarking:</p>

  <p>"Gee whiz! I'd have t' be ready t' croak before I'd miss this chance uh
  dealing old Dunk misery."</p>

  <p>Chip sat where they had left him, staring unseeingly down at the
  uncompleted sketch. His cigarette went out, but he did not roll a fresh one
  and held the half-burned stub abstractedly between his lips, set in bitter
  lines.</p>

  <p>Why should he care what a slip of a girl thought of him? He didn't care;
  he only&mdash;that thought he did not follow to the end, but started
  immediately on a new one. He supposed he was ignorant, according to Eastern
  standards. Lined up alongside Dr. Cecil Granthum&mdash;damn him!&mdash;he
  would cut a sorry figure, no doubt. He had never seen the outside of a
  college, let alone imbibing learning within one. He had learned some of the
  wisdom which nature teaches those who can read her language, and he had read
  much, lying on his stomach under a summer sky, while the cattle grazed all
  around him and his horse cropped the sweet grasses within reach of his hand.
  He could repeat whole pages of Shakespeare, and of Scott, and Bobbie
  Burns&mdash;he'd like to try Dr. Cecil on some of them and see who came out
  ahead. Still, he was ignorant&mdash;and none realized it more keenly and
  bitterly than did Chip.</p>

  <p>He rested his chin in his hand and brooded over his comfortless past and
  cheerless future. He could just remember his mother&mdash;and he preferred
  not to remember his father, who was less kind to him than were strangers.
  That was his past. And the future&mdash;always to be a cow-puncher? There was
  his knack for drawing; if he could study and practice, perhaps even the
  Little Doctor would not dare call him ignorant then. Not that he cared for
  what she might say or might not say, but a fellow can't help hating to be
  reminded of something that he knows better than anyone else&mdash;and that is
  not pleasant, however you may try to cover up the unsightliness of it.</p>

  <p>If Dr. Cecil Granthum&mdash;damn him!&mdash;had been kicked into the world
  and made to fight fate with tender, childish little fists but lately outgrown
  their baby dimples, as had been <i>his</i> lot, would he have amounted to
  anything, either? Maybe Dr. Cecil would have grown up just common and
  ignorant and fit for nothing better than to furnish amusement to girl doctors
  with dimples and big, gray eyes and a way of laughing. He'd like to show that
  little woman that she didn't know all about him yet. It wasn't too
  late&mdash;he was only twenty-four&mdash;he would study, and work, and climb
  to where she must look up, not down, to him&mdash;if she cared enough to look
  at all. It wasn't too late. He would quit gambling and save his money, and by
  next winter he'd have enough to go somewhere and learn to make pictures that
  amounted to something. He'd show her!</p>

  <p>After reiterating this resolve in several emphatic forms, Chip's spirits
  grew perceptibly lighter&mdash;so much so that he rolled a fresh cigarette
  and finished the drawing in his hands, which demonstrated the manner in which
  a particularly snaky broncho had taken a fall out of Jack Bates in the corral
  that morning.</p>

  <p>Next day, early in the afternoon, the round-up climbed the grade and
  started on its long trip over the range, and, after they had gone, the ranch
  seemed very quiet and very lonely to the Little Doctor, who revenged herself
  by snubbing Dunk so unmercifully that he announced his intention of taking
  the next train for Butte, where he lived in the luxury of rich bachelorhood.
  As the Little Doctor showed no symptoms of repenting, he rode sullenly away
  to Dry Lake, and she employed the rest of the afternoon writing a full and
  decidedly prejudiced account to Dr. Cecil of her quarrel with Chip, whom, she
  said, she quite hated.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; WHAT WHIZZER DID.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I GUESS Happy lost some of his horses, las' night," said
  Slim at the breakfast table next morning. Slim had been kept at the ranch to
  look after the fences and the ditches, and was doing full justice to the
  expert cookery of the Countess.</p>

  <p>"What makes yuh think that?" The Old Man poised a bit of tender, broiled
  steak upon the end of his fork.</p>

  <p>"They's a bunch hangin' around the upper fence, an' Whizzer's among 'em.
  I'd know that long-legged snake ten miles away."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor looked up quickly. She had never before heard of a
  "long-legged snake"&mdash;but then, she had not yet made the acquaintance of
  Whizzer.</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe you better run 'em into the corral and hold 'em till Shorty
  sends some one after 'em," suggested the Old Man.</p>

  <p>"I never c'd run 'em in alone, not with Whizzer in the bunch," objected
  Slim. "He's the orneriest cayuse in Chouteau County."</p>

  <p>"Whizzer'll make a rattlin' good saddle horse some day, when he's broke
  gentle," argued the Old Man.</p>

  <p>"Huh! I don't envy Chip the job uh breakin' him, though," grunted Slim, as
  he went out of the door.</p>

  <p>After breakfast the Little Doctor visited Silver and fed him his customary
  ration of lump sugar, helped the Countess tidy the house, and then found
  herself at a loss for something to do. She stood looking out into the hazy
  sunlight which lay warm on hill and coulee.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go up above the grade and make a sketch of the ranch," she
  said to the Countess, and hastily collected her materials.</p>

  <p>Down by the creek a "cotton-tail" sprang out of her way and kicked itself
  out of sight beneath a bowlder. The Little Doctor stood and watched till he
  disappeared, before going on again. Further up the bluff a striped snake gave
  her a shivery surprise before he glided sinuously away under a sagebush. She
  crossed the grade and climbed the steep bluff beyond, searching for a
  comfortable place to work.</p>

  <p>A little higher, she took possession of a great, gray bowlder jutting like
  a giant table from the gravelly soil. She walked out upon it and looked
  down&mdash;a sheer drop of ten or twelve feet to the barren, yellow slope
  below.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is perfectly solid," she soliloquized and stamped one stout,
  little boot, to see if the rock would tremble. If human emotions are possible
  to a heart of stone, the rock must have been greatly amused at the test. It
  stood firm as the hills around it.</p>

  <p>Della sat down and looked below at the house&mdash;a doll's house; at the
  toy corrals and tiny sheds and stables. Slim, walking down the hill, was a
  mere pigmy&mdash;a short, waddling insect. At least, to a girl unused to
  gazing from a height, each object seemed absurdly small. Flying U coulee
  stretched away to the west, with a silver ribbon drawn carelessly through it
  with many a twist and loop, fringed with a tender green of young leaves. Away
  and beyond stood the Bear Paws, hazily blue, with splotches of purple
  shadows.</p>

  <p>"I don't blame J. G. for loving this place," thought the Little Doctor,
  drinking in the intoxication of the West with every breath she drew.</p>

  <p>She had just become absorbed in her work when a clatter arose from the
  grade below, and a dozen horses, headed by a tall, rangy sorrel she surmised
  was Whizzer, dashed down the hill. Weary and Chip galloped close behind. They
  did not look up, and so passed without seeing her. They were talking and
  laughing in very good spirits&mdash;which the Little Doctor resented, for
  some inexplicable reason. She heard them call to Slim to open the corral
  gate, and saw Slim run to do their bidding. She forgot her sketching and
  watched Whizzer dodge and bolt back, and Chip tear through the creek bed
  after him at peril of life and limb.</p>

  <p>Back and forth, round and round went Whizzer, running almost through the
  corral gate, then swerving suddenly and evading his pursuers with an ease
  which bordered closely on the marvelous. Slim saddled a horse and joined in
  the chase, and the Old Man climbed upon the fence and shouted advice which no
  one heard and would not have heeded if they had.</p>

  <p>As the chase grew in earnestness and excitement, the sympathies of the
  Little Doctor were given unreservedly to Whizzer. Whenever a particularly
  clever maneuver of his set the men to swearing, she clapped her hands in
  sincere, though unheard and unappreciated, applause.</p>

  <p>"Good boy!" she cried, approvingly, when he dodged Chip and whirled
  through the big gate which the Old Man had unwittingly left open. J. G.
  leaned perilously forward and shook his fist unavailingly. Whizzer tossed
  head and heels alternately and scurried up the path to the very door of the
  kitchen, where he swung round and looked back down the hill snorting
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"Shoo, there!" shrilled the Countess, shaking her dish towel at him.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;oo-oof-f," snorted he disdainfully and trotted leisurely round
  the corner.</p>

  <p>Chip galloped up the hill, his horse running heavily. After him came
  Weary, liberally applying quirt and mild invective. At the house they parted
  and headed the fugitive toward the stables. He shot through the big gate,
  lifting his heels viciously at the Old Man as he passed, whirled around the
  stable and trotted haughtily past Slim into the corral of his own accord,
  quite as if he had meant to do so all along.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever!" exclaimed the Little Doctor, disgustedly, from her perch.
  "Whizzer, I'm ashamed of you! I wouldn't have given in like that&mdash;but
  you gave them a chase, didn't you, my beauty?"</p>

  <p>The boys flung themselves off their tired horses and went up to the house
  to beg the Countess for a lunch, and Della turned resolutely to her sketching
  again.</p>

  <p>She was just beginning to forget that the world held aught but soft
  shadows, mellow glow and hazy perspective, when a subdued uproar reached her
  from below. She drew an uncertain line or two, frowned and laid her pencil
  resignedly in her lap.</p>

  <p>"It's of no use. I can't do a thing till those cow-punchers take
  themselves and their bronchos off the ranch&mdash;and may it be soon!" she
  told herself, disconsolately and not oversincerely. The best of us are not
  above trying to pull the wool over our own eyes, at times.</p>

  <p>In reality their brief presence made the near future seem very flat and
  insipid to the Little Doctor. It was washing all the color out of the
  picture, and leaving it a dirty gray. She gazed moodily down at the whirl of
  dust in the corral, where Whizzer was struggling to free himself from the
  loop Chip had thrown with his accustomed, calm precision. Whatever Chip did
  he did thoroughly, with no slurring of detail. Whizzer was fain to own
  himself fairly caught.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's got you fast, my beauty!" sighed the Little Doctor, woefully.
  "Why didn't you jump over the fence&mdash;I think you <i>could</i>- -and run,
  run, to freedom?" She grew quite melodramatic over the humiliation of the
  horse she had chosen to champion, and glared resentfully when Chip threw his
  saddle, with no gentle hand, upon the sleek back and tightened the cinches
  with a few strong, relentless yanks.</p>

  <p>"Chip, you're an ugly, mean-tempered&mdash;that's right, Whizzer! Kick him
  if you can&mdash;I'll stand by you!" This assertion, you understand, was
  purely figurative; the Little Doctor would have hesitated long before
  attempting to carry it out literally.</p>

  <p>"Now, Whizzer, when he tries to ride you, don't you let him! Throw him
  clear-over-the <i>stable</i>&mdash;so there!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps Whizzer understood the command in some mysterious, telepathic
  manner. At any rate, he set himself straightway to obey it, and there was not
  a shadow of doubt but that he did his best&mdash;but Chip did not choose to
  go over the stable. Instead of doing so, he remained in the saddle and
  changed ends with his quirt, to the intense rage of the Little Doctor, who
  nearly cried.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you brute! You fiend! I'll never speak to you again as long as I
  live! Oh, Whizzer, you poor fellow, why do you let him abuse you so? Why
  <i>don't</i> you throw him clean off the ranch?"</p>

  <p>This is exactly what Whizzer was trying his best to do, and Whizzer's best
  was exceedingly bad for his rider, as a general thing. But Chip calmly
  refused to be thrown, and Whizzer, who was no fool, suddenly changed his
  tactics and became so meek that his champion on the bluff felt tempted to
  despise him for such servile submission to a tyrant in brown chaps and gray
  hat&mdash;I am transcribing the facts according to the Little Doctor's
  interpretation.</p>

  <p>She watched gloomily while Whizzer, in whose brain lurked no thought of
  submission, galloped steadily along behind the bunch which Slim made haste to
  liberate, and bided his time. She had expected better&mdash;rather,
  worse&mdash;of him than that. She had not dreamed he would surrender so
  tamely. As they crossed the Hog's Back and climbed the steep grade just below
  her, she eyed him reproachfully and said again:</p>

  <p>"Whizzer, I'm ashamed of you!"</p>

  <p>It did certainly seem that Whizzer heard and felt the pricking of pride at
  the reproof. He made a feint at being frightened by a jack rabbit which
  sprang out from the shade of a rock and bounced down the hill like a rubber
  ball. As if Whizzer had never seen a jack rabbit before!&mdash;he who had
  been born and reared upon the range among them! It was a feeble excuse at the
  best, but he made the most of it and lost no time seeking a better.</p>

  <p>He stopped short, sidled against Weary's horse and snorted. Chip, in none
  the best humor with him, jerked the reins savagely and dug him with his
  spurs, and Whizzer, resenting the affront, whirled and bounded high in the
  air. Back down the grade he bucked with the high, rocking, crooked jumps
  which none but a Western cayuse can make, while Weary turned in his saddle
  and watched with sharp-drawn breaths. There was nothing else that he could
  do.</p>

  <p>Chip was by no means passive. For every jump that Whizzer made the rawhide
  quirt landed across his flaring nostrils, and the locked rowels of Chip's
  spurs raked the sorrel sides from cinch to flank, leaving crimson streams
  behind them.</p>

  <p>Wild with rage at this clinging cow-puncher whom he could not dislodge,
  who stung his sides and head like the hornets in the meadow, Whizzer gathered
  himself for a mighty leap as he reached the Hog's Back. Like a wire spring
  released, he shot into the air, shook himself in one last, desperate hope of
  victory, and, failing, came down with not a joint in his legs and turned a
  somersault.</p><a id="pic1"

    <p class="caption">He came down with not a joint in his legs and turned a
    somersault.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>A moment, and he struggled to his feet and limped painfully away, crushed
  and beaten in spirit.</p>

  <p>Chip did not struggle. He lay, a long length of brown chaps,
  pink-and-white shirt and gray hat, just where he had fallen.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor never could remember getting down that bluff, and her
  sketching materials went to amuse the jack rabbits and the birds. Fast as she
  flew, Weary was before her and had raised Chip's head upon one arm. She knelt
  beside him in the dust, hovering over the white face and still form like a
  pitying, little gray angel. Weary looked at her impersonally, but neither of
  them spoke in those first, breathless moments.</p>

  <p>The Old Man, who had witnessed the accident, came puffing laboriously up
  the hill, taking the short cut straight across from the stable.</p>

  <p>"Is he&mdash;<i>dead</i>?" he yelled while he scrambled.</p>

  <p>Weary turned his head long enough to look down at him, with the same
  impersonal gaze he had bestowed upon the Little Doctor, but he did not answer
  the question. He could not, for he did not know. The Little Doctor seemed not
  to have heard.</p>

  <p>The Old Man redoubled his exertions and reached them very much out of
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead, Dell?" he repeated in an awestruck tone. He feared she would
  say yes.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor had taken possession of the brown head. She looked up at
  her brother, a very unprofessional pallor upon her face, and down at the
  long, brown lashes and at the curved, sensitive lips which held no hint of
  red. She pressed the face closer to her breast and shook her head. She could
  not speak, just then, for the griping ache that was in her throat.</p>

  <p>"One of the best men on the ranch gone under, just when we need help the
  worst!" complained the Old Man. "Is he hurt bad?"</p>

  <p>"J. G.," began the Little Doctor in a voice all the fiercer for being
  suppressed, "I want you to kill that horse. Do you hear? If you don't do it,
  I will!"</p>

  <p>"You won't have to, if old Splinter goes down and out," said Weary, with
  quiet meaning, and the Little Doctor gave him a grateful flash of gray
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"How bad is he hurt?" repeated the Old Man, impatiently. "You're supposed
  t' be a doctor&mdash;don't you know?"</p>

  <p>"He has a scalp wound which does not seem serious," said she in an attempt
  to be matter-of-fact, "and his left collar bone is broken."</p>

  <p>"Doggone it! A broken collar bone ain't mended overnight."</p>

  <p>"No," acquiesced the Little Doctor, "it isn't."</p>

  <p>These last two remarks Chip heard. He opened his eyes and looked straight
  up into the gray ones above&mdash;a long, questioning, rebellious look. He
  tried then to rise, to free himself from the bitter ecstasy of those soft,
  enfolding arms. Only a broken collar bone! Good thing it was no worse! Ugh! A
  spasm of pain contracted his features and drew beads of moisture to his
  forehead. The spurned arms once more felt the dead weight of him.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" The Little Doctor's voice called to him from afar.</p>

  <p>Must he answer? He wanted to drift on and on&mdash;"Can you tell me where
  the pain is?"</p>

  <p>Pain? Oh, yes, there had been pain&mdash;but he wanted to drift. He opened
  his eyes again reluctantly; again the pain clutched him.</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;my&mdash;foot."</p>

  <p>For the first time the eyes of the Little Doctor left his face and
  traveled downward to the spurred boots. One was twisted in a horrible
  unnatural position that told the agonizing truth&mdash;a badly dislocated
  ankle. They returned quickly to the face, and swam full of blinding
  tears&mdash;such as a doctor should not succumb to. He was not drifting into
  oblivion now; his teeth were not digging into his lower lip for nothing, she
  knew.</p>

  <p>"Weary," she said, forgetting to call him properly by name, "ride to the
  house and get my medicine case&mdash;the little black one. The Countess
  knows&mdash;and have Slim bring something to carry him home on.
  And&mdash;<i>ride</i>!"</p>

  <p>Weary was gone before she had finished, and he certainly "rode."</p>

  <p>"You'll have another crippled cow-puncher on yer hands, first thing yuh
  know," grumbled the Old Man, anxiously, as he watched Weary race recklessly
  down the hill.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor did not answer. She scarcely heard him. She was stroking
  the hair back from Chip's forehead softly, unconsciously, wondering why she
  had never before noticed the wave in it&mdash;but then, she had scarcely seen
  him with his hat off. How silky and soft it felt! And she had called him all
  sorts of mean names, and had wanted Whizzer to&mdash;she shuddered and turned
  sick at the memory of the thud when they struck the hard road together.</p>

  <p>"Dell!" exclaimed the Old Man, "you're white's a rag. Doggone it, don't
  throw up yer hands at yer first case&mdash;brace up!"</p>

  <p>Chip looked up at her curiously, forgetting the pain long enough to wonder
  at her whiteness. Did she have a heart, then, or was it a feminine trait to
  turn pale in every emergency? She had not turned so very white when those
  kids&mdash;he felt inclined to laugh, only for that cussed foot. Instead he
  relaxed his vigilance and a groan slipped out before he knew.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute more and I'll ease the pain for you," murmured the girl,
  compassionately.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;so long as you&mdash;don't&mdash;use&mdash;the stomach
  pump," he retorted, with a miserable makeshift of a laugh.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked the Old Man, but no one explained.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor was struggling with the lump in her throat that he
  should try to joke about it.</p>

  <p>Then Weary was back and holding the little, black case out to her. She
  seized it eagerly, slipping Chip's head to her knees that she might use her
  hands freely. There was no halting over the tiny vials, for she had decided
  just what she must do.</p>

  <p>She laid something against Chip's closed lips.</p>

  <p>"Swallow these," she said, and he obeyed her. "Weary&mdash;oh, you knew
  what to do, I see. There, lay the coat down there for a pillow."</p>

  <p>Relieved of her burden, she rose and went to the poor, twisted foot.</p>

  <p>Weary and the Old Man watched her go to work systematically and disclose
  the swollen, purpling ankle. Very gently she did it, and when she had
  administered a merciful anaesthetic, the enthusiasm of the Old Man demanded
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be eternally doggoned! You're onto your job, Dell, doggoned if
  yuh ain't. I won't ever josh yuh again about yer doctorin'!"</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd been around the time I smashed <i>my</i> ankle," commented
  Weary, fishing for his cigarette book; he was beginning to feel the need of a
  quieting smoke. "They hauled me forty miles, to Benton."</p>

  <p>"That must have been torture!" shuddered the Little Doctor. "A dislocated
  ankle is a most agonizing thing."</p>

  <p>"Yes," assented Weary, striking a match, "it sure is, all right."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; GOOD INTENTIONS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"MR. DAVIDSON, have you nerve enough to help me replace this
  ankle? The Countess is too nervous, and J. G. is too awkward."</p>

  <p>Chip was lying oblivious to his surroundings or his hurt in the sunny,
  south room which Dunk Whitaker chose to call his.</p>

  <p>"I've never been accused of wanting nerve," grinned Weary. "I guess I can
  stand it if you can." And a very efficient assistant he proved himself to
  be.</p>

  <p>When the question of a nurse arose, when all had been done that could be
  done and Weary had gone, the Little Doctor found herself involved in an
  argument with the Countess. The Countess wanted them to send for Bill. Bill
  just thought the world and all of Chip, she declared, and would just love to
  come. She was positive that Bill was the very one they needed, and the Little
  Doctor, who had conceived a violent dislike for Bill, a smirky, self-
  satisfied youth addicted to chewing tobacco, red neckties and a perennial
  grin, was equally positive he was the very one they did not want. In despair
  she retrenched herself behind the assertion that Chip should choose for
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I just know he'll choose Bill," crowed the Countess after the flicker of
  the doctor's skirts.</p>

  <p>Chip turned his head rebelliously upon the pillow and looked up at her.
  Something in his eyes brought to mind certain stormy crises in the headstrong
  childhood of the Little Doctor-crises in which she was forced to submission
  very much against her will. It was the same mutinous surrender to
  overwhelming strength, the same futile defiance of fate.</p>

  <p>"I came to ask you who you would rather have to nurse you," she said,
  trying to keep the erratic color from crimsoning her cheeks. You see, she had
  never had a patient of her very own before, and there were certain
  embarrassing complications in having this particular young man in charge.</p>

  <p>Chip's eyes wandered wistfully to the window, where a warm, spring breeze
  flapped the curtains in and out.</p>

  <p>"How long have I got to lie here?" he asked, reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"A month, at the least&mdash;more likely six weeks," she said with kind
  bluntness. It was best he should know the worst at once.</p>

  <p>Chip turned his face bitterly to the wall for a minute and traced an
  impossible vine to its breaking point where the paper had not been properly
  matched. Twenty miles away the boys were hurrying through their early dinner
  that they might catch up their horses for the afternoon's work. And they had
  two good feet to walk on, two sound arms to subdue restless horseflesh and he
  was not there! He could fairly smell the sweet, trampled sod as the horses
  circled endlessly inside the rope corral, and hear them snort when a noose
  swished close. He wondered who would get his string to ride, and what they
  would do with his bed.</p>

  <p>He didn't need it, now; he would lie on wire springs, instead of on the
  crisp, prairie grass. He would be waited on like a yearling baby
  and&mdash;"The Countess just knows you will choose Bill," interrupted a
  whimsical girl voice.</p>

  <p>Chip said something which the Little Doctor did not try to hear
  distinctly. "Don't she think I've had enough misery dealt me for once?" he
  asked, without taking his eyes from the poor, broken vine. He rather pitied
  the vine&mdash;it seemed to have been badly used by fate, just as he had
  been. He was sure it had not wanted to stop right there on that line, as it
  had been forced to do. <i>he</i> had not wanted to stop, either.
  He&mdash;"She says Bill would just love to come," said the voice, with a bit
  of a laugh in it.</p>

  <p>Chip, turning his head back suddenly, looked into the gray eyes and felt
  inexplicably cheered. He almost believed she understood something of what it
  all meant to him. And she mercifully refrained from spoken pity, which he
  felt he could not have borne just then. His lips took back some of their
  curve.</p>

  <p>"You tell her I wouldn't just love to have him," he said, grimly.</p>

  <p>"I'd never dare. She dotes on Bill. Whom <i>do</i> you want?"</p>

  <p>"When it comes to that, I don't want anybody. But if you could get Johnny
  Beckman to come&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will&mdash;I'll go myself, to make sure of him. Which one is
  Johnny?"</p>

  <p>"Johnny's the red-headed one," said Chip.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;they're <i>all</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but his head is several shades redder than any of the others,"
  interrupted he, quite cheerfully.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor, observing the twinkle in his eyes, felt her spirits
  rise wonderfully. She could not bear that hurt, rebellious, lonely look which
  they had worn.</p>

  <p>"I'll bring him&mdash;but I may have to chloroform the Countess to get him
  into the house. You must try to sleep, while I'm gone&mdash;and don't
  fret&mdash;will you? You'll get well all the quicker for taking things
  easily."</p>

  <p>Chip smiled faintly at this wholesome advice, and the Little Doctor laid
  her hand shyly upon his forehead to test its temperature, drew down the shade
  over the south window, and left him in dim, shadowy coolness to sleep.</p>

  <p>She came again before she started for Johnny, and found him wide awake and
  staring hungrily at the patch of blue sky visible through the window which
  faced the East.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to learn to obey orders better than this," she said,
  severely, and took quiet possession of his wrist. "I told you not to fret
  about being hurt. I know you hate it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chip flushed a little under her touch and the tone in which she spoke the
  last words. It seemed to mean that she hated it even more than he did, having
  him helpless in the house with her. It hadn't been so long since she had told
  him plainly how little she liked him. He was not going to forget, in a
  hurry!</p>

  <p>"Why don't you send me to the hospital?" he demanded, brusquely. "I could
  stand the trip, all right."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor, the color coming and going in her cheeks, pressed her
  cool fingers against his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Because I want you here to practice on. Do you think I'd let such a
  chance escape?"</p>

  <p>After she was gone, Chip found some things to puzzle over. He felt that he
  was no match for the Little Doctor, and for the first time in his life he
  deeply regretted his ignorance of woman nature.</p>

  <p>When the dishes were done, the Countess put her resentment behind her and
  went in to sit with Chip, with the best of intentions. The most disagreeable
  trait of some disagreeable people is that their intentions are invariably
  good. She had her "crochy work," and Chip groaned inwardly when he saw her
  settle herself comfortably in a rocking-chair and unwind her thread. The
  Countess had worked hard all her life, and her hands were red and
  big-jointed. There was no pleasure in watching their clever manipulation of
  the little, steel hook. If it had been the Little Doctor's hands,
  now&mdash;Chip turned again to the decapitated, pale blue vine with its pink
  flowers and no leaves. The Countess counted off "chain 'leven" and began in a
  constrained tone, such as some well-meaning people employ against helpless
  sick folk.</p>

  <p>"How're yuh feelin' now? Yuh want a drink, or anything?"</p>

  <p>Chip did not want a drink, and he felt all right, he guessed.</p>

  <p>The Countess thought to cheer him a little.</p>

  <p>"Well, I do think it's too bad yuh got t' lay here all through this purty
  spring weather. If it had been in the winter, when it's cold and stormy
  outside, a person wouldn't mind it s' much. I know yuh must feel purty blew
  over it, fer yuh was always sech a hand t' be tearin' around the country on
  the dead run, seems like. I always told Mary 't you'n Weary always rode like
  the sheriff wa'nt more'n a mile b'hind yuh. An' I s'pose you feel it all the
  more, seein' the round-up's jest startin' out. Weary said yuh was playin' big
  luck, if yuh only knew enough t' cash in yer chips at the right time, but
  he's afraid yuh wouldn't be watching the game close enough an' ud lose yer
  pile. I don't know what he was drivin' at, an' I guess he didn't neither.
  It's too bad, anyway. I guess yuh didn't expect t' wind up in bed when yuh
  rode off up the hill. But as the sayin' is: 'Man plans an' God displans,' an'
  I guess it's so. Here yuh are, laid up fer the summer, Dell says&mdash;the
  las' thing on earth, I guess, that yuh was lookin' fer. An' yuh rode buckin'
  bronks right along, too. I never looked fer Whizzer t' buck yuh off, I must
  say&mdash;yuh got the name uh bein' sech a good rider, too. But they say 't
  the pitcher 't's always goin' t' the well is bound t' git busted sometime,
  an' I guess your turn come t' git busted. Anyway&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I didn't get bucked off," broke in Chip, angrily. A "bronch fighter" is
  not more jealous of his sweetheart than of his reputation as a rider. "A
  fellow can't very well make a pretty ride while his horse is turning a
  somersault."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I didn't happen t' se it&mdash;I thought Weary said 't yuh got
  throwed off on the Hog's Back. Anyway, I don't know's it makes much
  difference how yuh happened t' hit the ground&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I guess it does make a difference," cried Chip, hotly. His eyes took on
  the glitter of fever. "It makes a whole heap of difference, let me tell you!
  I'd like to hear Weary or anybody else stand up and tell me that I got bucked
  off. I may be pretty badly smashed up, but I'd come pretty near showing him
  where he stood."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, yuh needn't go t' work an' git mad about it," remonstrated the
  Countess, dropping her thread in her perturbation at his excitement. The
  spool rolled under the bed and she was obliged to get down upon her knees and
  claw it back, and she jarred the bed and set Chip's foot to hurting again
  something awful.</p>

  <p>When she finally secured the spool and resumed her chair, Chip's eyes were
  tightly closed, but the look of his mouth and the flush in his cheeks,
  together with his quick breathing, precluded the belief that he was asleep.
  The Countess was not a fool&mdash;she saw at once that fever, which the
  Little Doctor had feared, was fast taking hold of him. She rolled her half
  yard of "edging" around the spool of thread, jabbed the hook through the lump
  and went out and told the Old Man that Chip was getting worse every
  minute&mdash;which was the truth.</p>

  <p>The Old Map knocked the ashes out of his pipe and went in to look at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Did Weary say I got bucked off?" demanded the sick man before the Old Man
  was fairly in the room. "If he did, he lied, that's all. I didn't think
  Weary'd do me dirt like that&mdash;I thought he'd stand by me if anybody
  would. He knows I wasn't throwed. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here, young fellow," put in the Old Man, calmly, "don't yuh git t'
  rampagin' around over nothin'! You turn over there an' go t' sleep."</p>

  <p>"I'll be hanged if I will!" retorted Chip. "If Weary's taken to lying
  about me I'll have it out with him if I break all the rest of my bones doing
  it. Do you think I'm going to stand a thing like that? I'll see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Easy there, doggone it. I never heard Weary say't yuh got bucked off.
  Whizzer turned over on his head, 's near as I c'd make out fer dust. I took
  it he turned a summerset."</p>

  <p>Chip's befogged brain caught at the last word.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's just what he did. It beats me how Weary could say, or even
  think, that I&mdash;it was the jack rabbit first&mdash;and I told her the
  supply was limited&mdash;and if we do furnish lots of amusement&mdash;but I
  guess I made her understand I wasn't so easy as she took me to be.
  She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hey?" The Old Man could hardly be blamed for losing the drift of Chip's
  rapid utterances.</p>

  <p>"If we want to get them rounded up before the dance, I'll&mdash;it's a
  good thing it wasn't poison, for seven dead kids at once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Old Man knew something about sickness himself. He hurried out,
  returning in a moment with a bowl of cool water and a fringed napkin which he
  pilfered from the dining-room table, wisely intending to bathe Chip's
  head.</p>

  <p>But Chip would have none of him or his wise intentions. He jerked the wet
  napkin from the Old Man's fingers and threw it down behind the bed, knocked
  up the bowl of water into the Old Man's face and called him some very bad
  names. The Countess came and looked in, and Chip hurled a pillow at her and
  called her a bad name also, so that she retreated to the kitchen with her
  feelings very much hurt. After that Chip had the south room to himself until
  the Little Doctor returned with Johnny.</p>

  <p>The Old Man, looking rather scared, met her on the porch. The Little
  Doctor read his face before she was off her horse.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? Is he worse?" she demanded, abruptly.</p>

  <p>"That's fer you t' find out. I ain't no doctor. He got on the fight, a
  while back, an' took t' throwin' things an' usin' langwidge. He can't git out
  uh bed, thank the Lord, or we'd be takin' t' the hills by now."</p>

  <p>"Then somebody has it to answer for. He was all right when I left him, two
  hours ago, with not a sign of fever. Has the Countess been pestering
  him?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the Countess, popping her head out of the kitchen window and
  speaking in an aggrieved tone, "I hope I never pester anybody. I went an'
  done all I could t' cheer 'im up, an' that's all the thanks I git fer it. I
  must say some folks ain't overburdened with gratitude, anyhow."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor did not wait to hear her out. She went straight to the
  south room, pulling off her gloves on the way. The pillow on the floor told
  her an eloquent tale, and she sighed as she picked it up and patted some
  shape back into it. Chip stared at her with wide, bright eyes from the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose Dr. Cecil Granthum would throw pillows at anybody!" he
  remarked, sarcastically, as she placed it very gently under his head.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, if the provocation was great enough. What have they been doing
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"Did Weary say I got bucked off?" he demanded, excitedly.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor was counting his pulse, and waited till she had
  finished. It was a high number&mdash;much higher than she liked.</p>

  <p>"No, Weary didn't. How could he? You didn't, you know. I saw it all from
  the bluff, and I know the horse turned over upon you. It's a wonder you
  weren't killed outright. Now, don't worry about it any more&mdash;I expect it
  was the Countess told you that. Weary hated dreadfully to leave you. I wonder
  if you know how much he thinks of you? I didn't, till I saw how he looked
  when you&mdash;here, drink this, all of it. You've got to sleep, you
  see."</p>

  <p>There was a week when the house was kept very still, and the south room
  very cool and shadowy, and Chip did not much care who it was that ministered
  to him&mdash;only that the hands of the Little Doctor were always soft and
  soothing on his head and he wished she would keep them there always, when he
  was himself enough to wish anything coherently.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; "THE LAST STAND."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TO use a trite expression and say that Chip "fought his way
  back to health" would be simply stating a fact and stating it mildly. He went
  about it much as he would go about gentling a refractory broncho, and with
  nearly the same results.</p>

  <p>His ankle, however, simply could not be hurried or bluffed into premature
  soundness, and the Little Doctor was at her wits' end to keep Chip from
  fretting himself back into fever, once he was safely pulled out of it. She
  made haste to explain the bit of overheard conversation, which he harped on
  more than he dreamed, when his head went light in that first week, and so
  established a more friendly feeling between them.</p>

  <p>Still, there was a certain aloofness about him which she could not
  conquer, try as she might. Just so far they were comrades&mdash; beyond, Chip
  walked moodily alone. The Little Doctor did not like that overmuch. She
  preferred to know that she fairly understood her friends and was admitted,
  sometimes, to their full confidence. She did not relish bumping her head
  against a blank wall that was too high to look over or to climb, and in which
  there seemed to be no door.</p>

  <p>To be sure, he talked freely, and amusingly, of his adventures and of the
  places he had known, but it was always an impersonal recital, and told little
  of his real self or his real feelings. Still, when she asked him, he told her
  exactly what he thought about things, whether his opinion pleased her or
  not.</p>

  <p>There were times when he would sit in the old Morris chair and smoke and
  watch her make lacey stuff in a little, round frame. Battenberg, she said it
  was. He loved to see her fingers manipulate the needle and the thread, and
  take wonderful pains with her work&mdash;but once she showed him a butterfly
  whose wings did not quite match, and he pointed it out to her. She had been
  listening to him tell a story of Indians and cowboys and with some wild
  riding mixed into it, and&mdash;well, she used the wrong stitch, but no one
  would notice it in a thousand years. This, her argument.</p>

  <p>"You'll always know the mistake's there, and you won't get the
  satisfaction out of it you would if it was perfect, would you?" argued Chip,
  letting his eyes dwell on her face more than was good for him.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor pouted her lips in a way to tempt a man all he could
  stand, and snipped out the wing with her scissors and did it over.</p>

  <p>So with her painting. She started a scene in the edge of the Bad Lands
  down the river. Chip knew the place well. There was a heated discussion over
  the foreground, for the Little Doctor wanted him to sketch in some Indian
  tepees and some squaws for her, and Chip absolutely refused to do so. He said
  there were no Indians in that country, and it would spoil the whole picture,
  anyway. The Little Doctor threatened to sketch them herself, drawing on her
  imagination and what little she knew of Indians, but something in his eyes
  stayed her hand. She left the easel in disgust and refused to touch it again
  for a week.</p>

  <p>She was to spend a long day with Miss Satterly, the schoolma'am, and
  started off soon after breakfast one morning.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll find something to keep you out of mischief while I'm gone,"
  she remarked, with a pretty, authoritative air. "Make him take his medicine,
  Johnny, and don't let him have the crutches. Well, I think I shall hide them
  to make sure."</p>

  <p>"I wish to goodness you had that picture done," grumbled Chip. "It seems
  to me you're doing a heap of running around, lately. Why don't you finish it
  up? Those lonesome hills are getting on my nerves."</p>

  <p>"I'll cover it up," said she.</p>

  <p>"Let it be. I like to look at them." Chip leaned back in his chair and
  watched her, a hunger greater than he knew in his eyes. It was most awfully
  lonesome when she was gone all day, and last night she had been writing all
  the evening to Dr. Cecil Granthum- -damn him! Chip always hitched that
  invective to the unknown doctor's name, for some reason he saw fit not to
  explain to himself. He didn't see what she could find to write about so much,
  for his part. And he did hate a long day with no one but Johnny to talk
  to.</p>

  <p>He craned his neck to keep her in view as long as possible, drew a long,
  discontented breath and settled himself more comfortably in the chair where
  he spent the greater part of his waking hours.</p>

  <p>"Hand me the tobacco, will you, kid?"</p>

  <p>He fished his cigarette book from his pocket. "Thanks!" He tore a narrow
  strip from the paper and sifted in a little tobacco.</p>

  <p>"Now a match, kid, and then you're done."</p>

  <p>Johnny placed the matches within easy reach, shoved a few magazines close
  to Chip's elbow, and stretched himself upon the floor with a book.</p>

  <p>Chip lay back against the cushions and smoked lazily, his eyes half
  closed, dreaming rather than thinking. The unfinished painting stood facing
  him upon its easel, and his eyes idly fixed upon it. He knew the place so
  well. Jagged pinnacles, dotted here and there with scrubby pines, hemmed in a
  tiny basin below&mdash;where was blank canvas. He went mentally over the
  argument again, and from that drifted to a scene he had witnessed in that
  same basin, one day&mdash;but that was in the winter. Dirty gray snow drifts,
  where a chinook had cut them, and icy side hills made the place still
  drearier. And the foreground&mdash;if the Little Doctor could get that, now,
  she would be doing something!&mdash;ah! that foreground. A poor, half-starved
  range cow with her calf which the round-up had overlooked in the fall, stood
  at bay against a steep cut bank. Before them squatted five great, gaunt
  wolves intent upon fresh beef for their supper. But the cow's horns were
  long, and sharp, and threatening, and the calf snuggled close to her side,
  shivering with the cold and the fear of death. The wolves licked their cruel
  lips and their eyes gleamed hungrily&mdash; but the eyes of the cow answered
  them, gleam for gleam. If it could be put upon canvas just as he had seen it,
  with the bitter, biting cold of a frozen chinook showing gray and sinister in
  the slaty sky&mdash;"Kid!"</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Johnny struggled reluctantly back to Montana.</p>

  <p>"Get me the Little Doctor's paint and truck, over on that table, and slide
  that easel up here."</p>

  <p>Johnny stared, opened his mouth to speak, then wisely closed it and did as
  he was bidden. Philosophically he told himself it was Chip's funeral, if the
  Little Doctor made a kick.</p>

  <p>"All right, kid." Chip tossed the cigarette stub out of the window. "You
  can go ahead and read, now. Lock the door first, and don't you bother
  me&mdash;not on your life."</p>

  <p>Then Chip plunged headlong into the Bad Lands, so to speak.</p>

  <p>A few dabs of dirty white, here and there, a wholly original manipulation
  of the sky&mdash;what mattered the method, so he attained the result? Half an
  hour, and the hills were clutched in the chill embrace of a "frozen chinook"
  such as the Little Doctor had never seen in her life. But Johnny, peeping
  surreptitiously over Chip's shoulder, stared at the change; then, feeling the
  spirit of it, shivered in sympathy with the barren hills.</p>

  <p>"Hully gee," he muttered under his breath, "he's sure a corker t' paint
  cold that fair makes yer nose sting." And he curled up in a chair behind,
  where he could steal a look, now and then, without fear of detection.</p>

  <p>But Chip was dead to all save that tiny basin in the Bad Lands&mdash; to
  the wolves and their quarry. His eyes burned as they did when the fever held
  him; each cheek bone glowed flaming red.</p>

  <p>As wolf after wolf appeared with what, to Johnny, seemed uncanny
  swiftness, and squatted, grinning and sinister, in a relentless half circle,
  the book slipped unheeded to the floor with a clatter that failed to rouse
  the painter, whose ears were dulled to all else than the pitiful blat of a
  shivering, panic-stricken calf whose nose sought his mother's side for her
  comforting warmth and protection.</p>

  <p>The Countess rapped on the door for dinner, and Johnny rose softly and
  tiptoed out to quiet her. May he be forgiven the lies he told that day, of
  how Chip's head ached and he wanted to sleep and must not be disturbed, by
  strict orders of the Little Doctor. The Countess, to whom the very name of
  the Little Doctor was a fetich, closed all intervening doors and walked on
  her toes in the kitchen, and Johnny rejoiced at the funeral quiet which
  rested upon the house.</p>

  <p>Faster flew the brush. Now the eyes of the cow glared desperate defiance.
  One might almost see her bony side, ruffled by the cutting north wind, heave
  with her breathing. She was fighting death for herself and her baby&mdash;but
  for how long? Already the nose of one great, gray beast was straight
  uplifted, sniffing, impatient. Would they risk a charge upon those lowered
  horns? The dark pines shook their feathery heads hopelessly. A little while
  perhaps, and then&mdash;Chip laid down the brush and sank back in the chair.
  Was the sun so low? He could do no more&mdash;yes, he took up a brush and
  added the title: "The Last Stand."</p><a id="pic2"
        name="pic2"></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403361h-images/ChipOfTheFlyingU-2.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"The Last Stand."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>He was very white, and his hand shook. Johnny leaned over the back of the
  chair, his eyes glued to the picture.</p>

  <p>"Gee," he muttered, huskily, "I'd like t' git a whack at them wolves
  once."</p>

  <p>Chip turned his head until he could look at the lad's face. "What do you
  think of it, kid?" he asked, shakily.</p>

  <p>Johnny did not answer for a moment. It was hard to put what he felt into
  words. "I dunno just how t' say it," he said, gropingly, at last, "but it
  makes me want t' go gunnin' fer them wolves b'fore they hamstring her.
  It&mdash;well&mdash;it don't seem t' me like it was a pitcher, somehow. It
  seems like the reel thing, kinda."</p>

  <p>Chip moved his head languidly upon the cushion.</p>

  <p>"I'm dead tired, kid. No, I'm not hungry, nor I don't want any coffee, or
  anything. Just roll this chair over to the bed, will you?
  I'm&mdash;dead-tired."</p>

  <p>Johnny was worried. He did not know what the Little Doctor would say, for
  Chip had not eaten his dinner, or taken his medicine. Somehow there had been
  that in his face that had made Johnny afraid to speak to him. He went back to
  the easel and looked long at the picture, his heart bursting with rage that
  he could not take his rifle and shoot those merciless, grinning brutes. Even
  after he had drawn the curtain before it and stood the easel in its
  accustomed place, he kept lifting the curtain to take another look at that
  wordless tragedy of the West.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; ART CRITICS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was late the next forenoon when the Little Doctor,
  feeling the spirit of artistic achievement within her, gathered up brushes
  and paints for a couple hours' work. Chip, sitting by the window smoking a
  cigarette, watched her uneasily from the tail of his eye. Looking back to
  yesterday's "spasm," as he dubbed it mentally, he was filled with a great and
  unaccountable shyness. What had seemed so real to him then he feared to-day
  to face, as trivial and weak.</p>

  <p>He wanted to cry "Stop!" when she laid hand to the curtain, but he looked,
  instead, out across the coulee to the hills beyond, the blood surging
  unevenly through his veins. He felt when she drew the cloth aside; she
  stopped short off in the middle of telling him something Miss Satterly had
  said&mdash;some whimsical thing&mdash;and he could hear his heart pounding in
  the silence which followed. The little, nickel alarm clock tick-tick-ticked
  with such maddening precision and speed that Chip wanted to shy a book at it,
  but his eyes never left the rocky bluff opposite, and the clock ticked
  merrily on.</p>

  <p>One minute&mdash;two&mdash;the silence was getting unbearable. He could
  not endure another second. He looked toward her; she stood, one hand full of
  brushes, gazing, white-faced, at "The Last Stand." As he looked, a tear
  rolled down the cheek nearest him and compelled him to speech.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" His voice seemed to him rough and brutal, but he did
  not mean it so.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor drew a long, quivering breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the poor, brave thing!" she said, in a hushed tone. She turned
  sharply away and sat down.</p>

  <p>"I expect I spoiled your picture, all right&mdash;but I told you I'd get
  into mischief if you went gadding around and left me alone."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor stealthily wiped her eyes, hoping to goodness Chip had
  not seen that they had need of wiping.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me you could paint like that?" She turned upon him
  fiercely. "Here you've sat and looked on at me daubing things up&mdash;and if
  I'd known you could do better than&mdash;" Looking again at the canvas she
  forgot to finish. The fascination of it held her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not in the habit of going around the country shouting what I don't
  know," said Chip, defensively. "You've taken heaps of lessons, and I never
  did. I just noticed the color of everything, and&mdash;oh, I don't
  know&mdash;it's in me to do those things. I can't help trying to paint and
  draw."</p>

  <p>"I suppose old Von Heim would have something to say of your way of doing
  clouds&mdash;but you got the effect, though&mdash;better than he did,
  sometimes. And that cow&mdash;I can see her breathe, I tell you! And the
  wolves&mdash;oh, don't sit there and smoke your everlasting cigarettes and
  look so stoical over it! What are you made of, anyway? Can't you feel proud?
  Oh, don't you know what you've done? I&mdash;I'd like to shake you&mdash;so
  now!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't much blame you. I knew I'd no business to meddle. Maybe, if
  you'll touch it up a little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll not touch a brush to <i>that</i>. I&mdash;I'm afraid I might kill
  the cow." She gave a little, hysterical laugh.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you're rather excitable&mdash;for a doctor?" scoffed
  Chip, and her chin went up for a minute.</p>

  <p>"I'd like t' kill them wolves," said Johnny, coming in just then.</p>

  <p>"Turn the thing around, kid, so I can see it," commanded Chip, suddenly.
  "I worked at it yesterday till the colors all ran together and I couldn't
  tell much about it."</p>

  <p>Johnny turned the easel, and Chip, looking, fell silent. Had <i>his</i>
  hand guided the brush while that scene grew from blank canvas to palpitating
  reality? Verily, he had "builded better than he knew." Something in his
  throat gripped, achingly and dry.</p>

  <p>"Did anybody see it yesterday?" asked the Little Doctor.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not unless the kid&mdash;" "I never said a word about it,"
  denied Johnny, hastily and vehemently. "I lied like the dickens. I said you
  had headache an' was tryin' t' sleep it off. I kep' the Countess teeterin'
  around on her toes all afternoon." Johnny giggled at the memory of it.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to call them all in and see what they say," declared she,
  starting for the door.</p>

  <p>"I don't <i>think</i> you will," began Chip, rebelliously, blushing over
  his achievement like a girl over her graduation essay. "I don't want to
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, we needn't tell them you did it," suggested she.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you're willing to shoulder the blame," compromised Chip, much
  relieved. He hated to be fussed over.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor regarded him attentively a moment, smiled queerly to
  herself and stood back to get a better view of the painting.</p>

  <p>"I'll shoulder the blame&mdash;and maybe claim the glory. It was mine in
  the first place, you know." She watched him from under her lashes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's yours, all right," said Chip, readily, but something went out
  of his face and lodged rather painfully in the deepest corner of his heart.
  He ignored it proudly and smiled back at her.</p>

  <p>"Do such things really happen, out here?" she asked, hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man!" said Chip, his eyes returning to the picture. "I was
  riding through that country last winter, and I came upon that very cow, just
  as you see her there, in that same basin. That's how I came to paint it into
  your foreground; I got to thinking about it, and I couldn't help trying to
  put it on canvas. Only, I opened up on the wolves with my six-shooter, and I
  got two; that big fellow ready to howl, there, and that one next the
  cut-bank. The rest broke out down the coulee and made for the breaks, where I
  couldn't follow. They&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say? Old Dunk's comin'," announced Johnny, hurrying in. "Why don't yuh
  let 'im see the pitcher an' think all the time the Little Doctor done it?
  Gee, it'd be great t' hear 'im go on an' praise it up, like he always does,
  an' not know the diffrunce."</p>

  <p>"Johnny, you're a genius," cried she, effusively. "Don't tell a soul that
  Chip had a brush in his hand yesterday, will you? He&mdash; he'd rather not
  have anyone know he did anything to the painting, you see."</p>

  <p>"Aw, I won't tell," interrupted Johnny, gruffly, eying his divinity with
  distrust for the first time in his short acquaintance with her. Was she mean
  enough to claim it really? Just at first, as a joke, it would be fun, but
  afterward, oh, she wouldn't do a thing like that!</p>

  <p>"Don't you bring Dunk in here," warned Chip, "or things might happen. I
  don't want to run up against him again till I've got two good feet to stand
  on."</p>

  <p>Their relation was a thing to be watched over tenderly, since Chip's month
  of invalidism. Dunk had notions concerning master and servant, and concerning
  Chip as an individual. He did not fancy occupying the back bedroom while Chip
  reigned in his sunny south room, waited on, petted (Dunk applied the term
  petted) and amused indefatigably by the Little Doctor. And there had been a
  scene, short but exceeding "strenuous," over a pencil sketch which
  graphically portrayed an incident Dunk fain would forget&mdash; the incident
  of himself as a would-be broncho fighter, with Banjo, of vigilante fame, as
  the means of his downfall&mdash;physical, mental and spiritual. Dunk might,
  in time, have forgiven the crippled ankle, and the consequent appropriation
  of his room, but never would he forgive the merciless detail of that
  sketch.</p>

  <p>"I'll carry easel and all into the parlor, and leave the door open so you
  can hear what they all say," said the Little Doctor, cheerfully. "I wish
  Cecil could be here to-day. I always miss Cecil when there's anything
  especial going on in the way of fun."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" answered Chip, and made himself another cigarette. He would be glad
  when he could hobble out to some lonely spot and empty his soul of the
  profane language stored away opposite the name of Dr. Cecil Granthum. There
  is so little comfort in swearing all inside, when one feels deeply upon a
  subject.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder you wouldn't send for him if you miss him that bad," he
  remarked, after a minute, hoping the Little Doctor would not find anything
  amiss with his tone, which he meant should be cordial and
  interested&mdash;and which evinced plenty of interest, of a kind, but was
  curiously lacking in cordiality.</p>

  <p>"I did beg, and tease, and entreat&mdash;but Cecil's in a
  hospital&mdash;as a physician, you understand, not as a patient, and can't
  get off just yet. In a month or two, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinner, called shrilly by the Countess, interrupted her, and she flitted
  out of the room looking as little like a lovelorn maiden as she did like a
  doctor&mdash;which was little indeed.</p>

  <p>"She begged, and teased, and entreated," repeated Chip, savagely to
  himself when the door closed upon her, and fell into gloomy meditation, which
  left him feeling that there was no good thing in this wicked world&mdash;no,
  not one&mdash;that was not appropriated by some one with not sense enough to
  understand and appreciate his blessing.</p>

  <p>After dinner the Little Doctor spoke to the unsuspecting critics.</p>

  <p>"That picture which I started a couple of weeks ago is finished at last,
  and I want you good people to come and tell me what you think of it. I want
  you all&mdash;you, Slim, and Louise, you are to come and give your
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know the first thing about paintin'," remonstrated the
  Countess, coming in from the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The Old Man lighted his pipe and followed her into the parlor with the
  others, and Slim rolled a cigarette to hide his embarrassment, for the role
  of art critic was new to him.</p>

  <p>There was some nervousness in the Little Doctor's manner as she set the
  easel to her liking and drew aside the curtain. She did not mean to be
  theatrical about it, but Chip, watching through the open door, fancied so,
  and let his lip curl a trifle. He was not in a happy frame of mind just
  then.</p>

  <p>A silence fell upon the group. The Old Man took his pipe from his mouth
  and stared.</p>

  <p>The cheeks of the Little Doctor paled and grew pink again. She laughed a
  bit, as though she would much rather cry.</p>

  <p>"Say something, somebody, quick!" she cried, when her nerves would bear no
  more.</p>

  <p>"Well, I do think it's awfully good, Dell," began the Countess.</p>

  <p>"By golly, I don't see how you done that without seein' it happen,"
  exclaimed Slim, looking very dazed and mystified.</p>

  <p>"That's a Diamond Bar cow," remarked J. G., abstractedly. "That outfit
  never does git half their calves. I remember the last time I rode through
  there last winter, that cow&mdash;doggone it, Dell, how the dickens did you
  get that cow an' calf in? You must a had a photograph t' work from."</p>

  <p>"By golly, that's right," chimed in Slim. "That there's the cow I had sech
  a time chasin' out uh the bunch down on the bottom. I run her till I was plum
  sick, an' so was she, by golly. I'd know her among a thousand. Yuh got her
  complete&mdash;all but the beller, an', by golly, yuh come blame near gittin'
  that, too!" Slim, always slow and very much in earnest, gradually became
  infused with the spirit of the scene. "Jest look at that ole gray sinner with
  his nose r'ared straight up in the air over there! By golly, he's callin' all
  his wife's relations t' come an' help 'em out. He's thinkin' the ole Diamon'
  Bar's goin' t' be one too many fer 'em. She shore looks fighty, with 'er head
  down an' 'er eyes rollin' all ways t' oncet, ready fer the first darn cuss
  that makes a crooked move! An' they know it, too, by golly, er they wouldn't
  hang back like they're a-doin'. I'd shore like t' be cached behind that ole
  pine stub with a thirty&mdash;thirty an' a fist full uh shells&mdash;I'd
  shore make a scatteration among 'em! A feller could easy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, Slim, they're nothing but paint!" The Little Doctor's eyes were
  shining.</p>

  <p>Slim turned red and grinned sheepishly at the others.</p>

  <p>"I kinda fergot it wasn't nothin' but a pitcher," he stammered,
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"That is the gist of the whole matter," said Dunk. "You couldn't ask for a
  greater compliment, or higher praise, than that, Miss Della. One forgets that
  it is a picture. One only feels a deep longing for a good rifle. You must let
  me take it with me to Butte. That picture will make you famous among
  cattlemen, at least. That is to say, out West, here. And if you will sell it
  I am positive I can get you a high price for it."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Little Doctor involuntarily sought the Morris chair in the
  next room; but Chip was looking out across the coulee, as he had a habit of
  doing lately, and seemed not to hear what was going on in the parlor. He was
  indifference personified, if one might judge from his outward appearance. The
  Little Doctor turned her glance resentfully to her brother's partner.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean all that?" she demanded of him.</p>

  <p>"I certainly do. It is great, Miss Della. I admit that it is not quite
  like your other work; the treatment seems different, in places,
  and&mdash;er&mdash;stronger. It is the best picture of the kind that I have
  ever seen, I think. It holds one, in a way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By golly, I bet Chip took a pitcher uh that!" exclaimed Slim, who had
  been doing some hard thinking. "He was tellin' us last winter about ridin' up
  on that ole Diamon' Bar cow with a pack uh wolves around her, an' her
  a-standin' 'em off, an' he shot two uh the wolves. Yes, sir; Chip jest about
  got a snap shot of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Well, doggone it! what if he did?" The Old Man turned jealously upon him.
  "It ain't everyone that kin paint like that, with nothin' but a little kodak
  picture t' go by. Doggone it! I don't care if Dell had a hull apurn full uh
  kodak pictures that Chip took&mdash;it's a rattlin' good piece uh work, all
  the same."</p>

  <p>"I ain't sayin' anything agin' the pitcher," retorted Slim. "I was jest
  wonderin' how she happened t' git that cow down s' fine, brand 'n all,
  without some kind uh pattern t' go by. S' fur 's the pitcher goes, it's about
  as good 's kin be did with paint, I guess. I ain't ever seen anything in the
  pitcher line that looked any natcherler."</p>

  <p>"Well, I do think it's just splendid!" gurgled the Countess. "It's every
  bit as good 's the one Mary got with a year's subscription t' the Household
  Treasure fer fifty cents. That one's got some hounds chasin' a deer and a man
  hidin' in 'the bushes, sost yuh kin jest see his head. It's an awful purty
  pitcher, but this one's jest as good. I do b'lieve it's a little bit better,
  if anything. Mary's has got some awful nice, green grass, an' the sky's an
  awful purty blue&mdash;jest about the color uh my blue silk waist. But yuh
  can't expect t' have grass an' sky like that in the winter, an' this is more
  of a winter pitcher. It looks awful cold an' lonesome, somehow, an' it makes
  yuh want t' cry, if yuh look at it long enough."</p>

  <p>The critics stampeded, as they always did when the Countess began to
  talk.</p>

  <p>"You better let Dunk take it with him, Dell," was the parting advice of
  the Old Man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; CONVALESCENCE.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU don't mind, do you?" The Little Doctor was visibly
  uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Mind what?" Chip's tone was one of elaborate unconsciousness. "Mind
  Dunk's selling the picture for you? Why should I? It's yours, you know."</p>

  <p>"I think you have some interest in it yourself," she said, without looking
  at him. "You don't think I mean to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think anything, except that it's your picture, and I put in a
  little time meddling with your property for want of something else to do. All
  I painted doesn't cover one quarter of the canvas, and I guess you've done
  enough for me to more than make up. I guess you needn't worry over that cow
  and calf&mdash;you're welcome to them both; and if you can get a bounty on
  those five wolves, I'll be glad to have you. Just keep still about my part of
  it."</p>

  <p>Chip really felt that way about it, after the first dash of wounded pride.
  He could never begin to square accounts with the Little Doctor, anyhow, and
  he was proud that he could do something for her, even if it was nothing more
  than fixing up a picture so that it rose considerably above mediocrity. He
  had meant it that way all along, but the suspicion that she was quite ready
  to appropriate his work rather shocked him, just at first. No one likes
  having a gift we joy in bestowing calmly taken from our hands before it has
  been offered. He wanted her to have the picture for her very
  own&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;He had not thought of the possibility of her
  selling it, or of Dunk as her agent. It was all right, of course, if she
  wanted to do that with it, but&mdash; There was something about it that hurt,
  and the hurt of it was not less, simply because he could not locate the
  pain.</p>

  <p>His mind fidgeted with the subject. If he could have saddled Silver and
  gone for a long gallop over the prairie land, he could have grappled with his
  rebellious inner self and choked to death several unwelcome emotions, he
  thought. But there was Silver, crippled and swung uncomfortably in canvas
  wrappings in the box stall, and here was himself, crippled and held day after
  day in one room and one chair&mdash;albeit a very pleasant room and a very
  comfortable chair&mdash;and a gallop as impossible to one of them as to the
  other.</p>

  <p>"I do wish&mdash;" The Little Doctor checked herself abruptly, and hummed
  a bit of coon song.</p>

  <p>"What do you wish?" Chip pushed his thoughts behind him, and tried to
  speak in his usual manner.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. I was just wishing Cecil could see 'The Last Stand.'"</p>

  <p>Chip said absolutely nothing for five minutes, and for an excellent
  reason. There was not a single thought during that time which would sound
  pretty if put into words, and he had no wish to shock the Little Doctor.</p>

  <p>After that day a constraint fell upon them both, which each felt keenly
  and neither cared to explain away. "The Last Stand" was tacitly dismissed
  from their conversation, of which there grew less and less as the days
  passed.</p>

  <p>Then came a time when Chip strongly resented being looked upon as an
  invalid, and Johnny was sent home, greatly to his sorrow.</p>

  <p>Chip hobbled about the house on crutches, and chafed and fretted, and
  managed to be very miserable indeed because he could not get out and ride and
  clear his brain and heart of some of their hurt- -for it had come to just
  that; he had been compelled to own that there was a hurt which would not heal
  in a hurry.</p>

  <p>It was a very bitter young man who, lounging in the big chair by the
  window one day, suddenly snorted contempt at a Western story he had been
  reading and cast the magazine&mdash;one of the Six Leading&mdash;clean into
  the parlor where it sprawled its artistic leaves in the middle of the floor.
  The Little Doctor was somewhere&mdash;he never seemed to know just where,
  nowadays&mdash;and the house was lonesome as an isolated peak in the Bad
  Lands.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had the making of the laws. I'd put a bounty on all the darn
  fools that think they can write cowboy stories just because they rode past a
  roundup once, on a fast train," he growled, reaching for his tobacco sack.
  "Huh! I'd like to meet up with the yahoo that wrote that rank yarn! I'd ask
  him where he got his lack of information. Huh! A cow-puncher togged up like
  he was going after the snakiest bronk in the country, when he was only going
  to drive to town in a buckboard! 'His pistol belt and dirk and leathern
  chaps'&mdash;oh, Lord; oh, Lord! And spurs! I wonder if he thinks it takes
  spurs to ride a buckboard? Do they think, back East, that spurs grow on a
  man's heels out here and won't come off? Do they think we <i>sleep</i> in
  'em, I wonder?" He drew a match along the arm of the chair where the varnish
  was worn off. "They think all a cow-puncher has to do is eat and sleep and
  ride fat horses. I'd like to tell some of them a few things that they
  don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've brought you a caller, Chip. Aren't you glad to see him?" It was the
  Little Doctor at the window, and the laugh he loved was in her voice and in
  her eyes, that it hurt him to meet, lately.</p>

  <p>The color surged to his face, and he leaned from the window, his thin,
  white hand outstretched caressingly.</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man!" he said, and choked a little over it. "Silver, old
  boy!"</p>

  <p>Silver, nickering softly, limped forward and nestled his nose in the palm
  of his master.</p>

  <p>"He's been out in the corral for several days, but I didn't tell
  you&mdash;I wanted it for a surprise," said the Little Doctor. "This is his
  longest trip, but he'll soon be well now."</p>

  <p>"Yes; I'd give a good deal if I could walk as well as he can," said Chip,
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't hurt as badly as you were. You ought to be thankful you can
  walk at all, and that you won't limp all your life. I was afraid for a while,
  just at first&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You were? Why didn't you tell me?" Chip's eyes were fixed sternly upon
  her.</p>

  <p>"Because I didn't want to. It would only have made matters worse, anyway.
  And you won't limp, you know, if you're careful for a while longer. I'm going
  to get Silver his sugar. He has sugar every day."</p>

  <p>Silver lifted his head and looked after her inquiringly, whinnied
  complainingly, and prepared to follow as best he could.</p>

  <p>"Silver&mdash;oh, Silver!" Chip snapped his fingers to attract his
  attention. "Hang the luck, come back here! Would you throw down your best
  friend for that girl? Has she got to have you, too?" His voice grew wistfully
  rebellious. "You're mine. Come back here, you little fool&mdash;she doesn't
  care."</p>

  <p>Silver stopped at the corner, swung his head and looked back at Chip,
  beckoning, coaxing, swearing under his breath. His eyes sought for sign of
  his goddess, who had disappeared most mysteriously. Throwing up his head, he
  sent a protest shrilling through the air, and looked no more at Chip.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming, now be still. Oh, don't you dare paw with your lame leg! Why
  didn't you stay with your master?"</p>

  <p>"He's no use for his master, any more," said Chip, with a hurt laugh. "A
  woman always does play the&mdash;mischief, somehow. I wonder why? They look
  innocent enough."</p>

  <p>"Wait till your turn comes, and perhaps you'll learn why," retorted
  she.</p>

  <p>Chip, knowing that his turn had come, and come to tarry, found nothing to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Beside," continued the Little Doctor, "Silver didn't want me so
  much&mdash;it was the sugar. I hope you aren't jealous of me, because I know
  his heart is big enough to hold us both."</p>

  <p>She stayed a long half hour, and was so gay that it seemed like old times
  to listen to her laugh and watch her dimples while she talked. Chip forgot
  that he had a quarrel with fate, and he also forgot Dr. Cecil Granthum, of
  Gilroy, Ohio&mdash;until Slim rode up and handed the Little Doctor a letter
  addressed in that bold, up- and-down writing that Chip considered a little
  the ugliest specimen of chirography he had ever seen in his life.</p>

  <p>"It's from Cecil," said the Little Doctor, simply and unnecessarily, and
  led Silver back down the hill.</p>

  <p>Chip, gazing at that tiresome bluff across the coulee, renewed his quarrel
  with fate.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE SPOILS OF VICTORY.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I WISH, while I'm gone, you'd paint me another picture.
  Will you, <i>please</i>?"</p>

  <p>When a girl has big, gray eyes that half convince you they are not gray at
  all, but brown, or blue, at times, and a way of using them that makes a
  fellow heady, like champagne, and a couple of dimples that will dodge into
  her cheeks just when a fellow is least prepared to resist them&mdash;why,
  what can a fellow do but knuckle under and say yes, especially when she lets
  her head tip to one side a little and says "please" like that?</p>

  <p>Chip tried not to look at her, but he couldn't help himself very well
  while she stood directly in front of him. He compromised weakly instead of
  refusing point-blank, as he told himself he wanted to do.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;maybe I can't, again."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you can, though. Here's an eighteen by twenty-four canvas, and here
  are all the paints I have in the house, and the brushes. I'll expect to see
  something worth while, when I return."</p>

  <p>"Well, but if I can't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here. Straight in the eye, if you please! Now, will you
  <i>try</i>?"</p>

  <p>Chip, looking into her eyes that were laughing, but with a certain
  earnestness behind the laugh, threw up his hands&mdash; mentally, you
  know.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll try. How long are you going to be gone?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, perhaps a week," she said, lightly, and Chip's heart went heavy.</p>

  <p>"You may paint any kind of picture you like, but I'd rather you did
  something like 'The Last Stand'&mdash;only better. And put your brand, as you
  call it, in one corner."</p>

  <p>"You won't sell it, will you?" The words slipped out before he knew.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no, I won't sell it, for it won't be mine. It's for yourself
  this time."</p>

  <p>"Then there won't be any picture," said Chip, shortly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, there will," smiled the Little Doctor, sweetly, and went away
  before he could contradict her.</p>

  <p>Perhaps a week! Heavens, that was seven days, and every day had at least
  sixteen waking hours. How would it be when it was years, then? When Dr. Cecil
  Granthum&mdash;(er&mdash;no, I won't. The invective attached to that
  gentleman's name was something not to be repeated here.) At any rate, a week
  was a long, long time to put in without any gray eyes or any laugh, or any
  dimples, or, in short, without the Little Doctor. He could not see, for his
  part, why she wanted to go gadding off to the Falls with Len Adams and the
  schoolma'am, anyway. Couldn't they get along without her? They always had,
  before she came to the country; but, for that matter, so had he. The problem
  was, how was he going to get along without her for the rest of his life? What
  did they want to stay a week for? Couldn't they buy everything they wanted in
  a day or so? And the Giant Spring wasn't such great shakes, nor the Rainbow
  Falls, that they need to hang around town a week just to look at them. And
  the picture&mdash;what was he such a fool for? Couldn't he say no with a pair
  of gray eyes staring into his? It seemed not. He supposed he must think up
  something to daub on there&mdash;the poorer the better.</p>

  <p>That first day Chip smoked something like two dozen cigarettes, gazed out
  across the coulee till his eyes ached, glared morosely at the canvas on the
  easel, which stared back at him till the dull blankness of it stamped itself
  upon his brain and he could see nothing else, look where he might. Whereupon
  he gathered up hat and crutches, and hobbled slowly down the hill to tell
  Silver his troubles.</p>

  <p>The second day threatened to be like the first. Chip sat by the window and
  smoked; but, little by little, the smoke took form and substance until, when
  he turned his eyes to the easel, a picture looked back at him&mdash;even
  though to other eyes the canvas was yet blank and waiting.</p>

  <p>There was no Johnny this time to run at his beckoning. He limped about on
  his crutches, collected all things needful, and sat down to work.</p>

  <p>As he sketched and painted, with a characteristic rapidity that was
  impatient of the slightest interruption yet patient in its perfectness of
  detail, the picture born of the smoke grew steadily upon the canvas.</p>

  <p>It seemed, at first, that "The Last Stand" was to be repeated. There were
  the same jagged pinnacles and scrubby pines, held in the fierce grip of the
  frozen chinook. The same? But there was a difference, not to be explained,
  perhaps, but certainly to be felt. The Little Doctor's hills were jagged,
  barren hills; her pines were very nice pines indeed. Chip's hills were
  jagged, they were barren&mdash;they&mdash;were desolate; his pines were
  shuddering, lonely pines; for he had wandered alone among them and had caught
  the Message of the Wilderness. His sky was the cold, sinister sky of "The
  Last Stand"&mdash;but it was colder, more sinister, for it was night. A young
  moon hung low in the west, its face half hidden behind a rift of scurrying
  snow clouds. The tiny basin was shadowy and vague, the cut-bank a black wall
  touched here and there by a quivering shaft of light.</p>

  <p>There was no threatening cow with lowered horns and watchful eye; there
  was no panic-stricken calf to whip up her flagging courage with its trust in
  her.</p>

  <p>The wolves? Yes, there were the wolves&mdash;but there were more of them.
  They were not sitting in a waiting half circle&mdash;they were scattered,
  unwatchful. Two of them in the immediate foreground were wrangling over a
  half-gnawed bone. The rest of the pack were nosing a heap pitifully
  eloquent.</p>

  <p>As before, so now they tricked the eye into a fancy that they lived. One
  could all but hear the snarls of the two standing boldly in the moonlight,
  the hair all bristly along the necks, the white fangs gleaming between
  tense-drawn lips. One felt tempted to brace oneself for the rush that was to
  come.</p>

  <p>For two days Chip shut himself in his room and worked through the long
  hours of daylight, jealous of the minutes darkness stole from him.</p>

  <p>He clothed the feast in a merciful shade which hid the repugnance and left
  only the pathos&mdash;two long, sharp horns which gleamed in the moonlight
  but were no longer threatening.</p>

  <p>He centered his energy upon the two wolves in the foreground, grimly
  determined that Slim should pray for a Gatling gun when he saw them.</p>

  <p>The third day, when he was touching up the shoulders of one of the
  combatants, a puff of wind blew open the door which led to the parlor. He did
  not notice it and kept steadily at work, painting his "brand" into a corner.
  Beneath the stump and its splinter he lettered his name&mdash;a thing he had
  never done before.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll be&mdash;doggoned!"</p>

  <p>Chip jumped half out of his chair, giving his lame ankle a jolt which made
  him grind his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Darn it, Chip, did <i>you</i> do that?"</p>

  <p>"It kind of looks that way, don't it?" Chip was plainly disconcerted, and
  his ankle hurt.</p>

  <p>"H&mdash;m-m." The Old Man eyed it sharply a minute. "It's a wonder you
  wouldn't paint in a howl or two, while you're about it. I suppose that's a
  mate to&mdash;doggone you, Chip, why didn't yuh tell us you painted that
  other one?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said Chip, getting red and uncomfortable, "except the cow
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, except the part that makes the picture worth the paint it's done
  with!" snorted the Old Man. "I must say I never thought that uh Dell!"</p>

  <p>"Thought what?" flared Chip, hotly, forgetting everything but that the
  Little Doctor was being censured. "It was her picture, she started it and
  intended to finish it. I painted on it one day when she was gone, and she
  didn't know it. I told her not to tell anyone I had anything to do with it.
  It wasn't her fault."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted the Old Man, as if he had his own opinion on that matter.
  "Well, it's a rattling good picture&mdash;but this one's better. Poor ole
  Diamond Bar&mdash;she couldn't come through with it, after all. She put up a
  good fight, out there alone, but she had t' go under&mdash;her an' her calf."
  He stood quiet a minute, gazing and gazing. "Doggone them measly wolves! Why
  in thunder can't a feller pump lead into 'em like he wants t'?"</p>

  <p>Chip's heart glowed within him. His technique was faulty, his colors
  daring, perhaps&mdash;but his triumph was for that the greater. If men could
  <i>feel</i> his pictures&mdash;and they did! That was the joy of
  it&mdash;they did!</p>

  <p>"Darn them snarlin' brutes, anyway! I thought it was doggone queer if Dell
  could dab away all her life at nice, common things that you only think is
  purty, an' then blossom out, all of a sudden, with one like that other
  was&mdash;that yuh felt all up an' down yer back. The little cheat, she'd no
  business t' take the glory uh that'n like she done. I'll give her thunder
  when she gits back."</p>

  <p>"You won't do anything of the kind," said Chip, quietly&mdash;too quietly
  not to be menacing. "I tell you that was my fault&mdash;I gave her all I did
  to the picture, and I told her not to say anything. Do you think I don't know
  what I owe to her? Do you think I don't know she saved Silver's
  life&mdash;and maybe mine? Forty pictures wouldn't square me with the Little
  Doctor&mdash;not if they were a heap better than they are, and she claimed
  every darned one. I'm doing this, and I'll thank you not to buy in where
  you're not wanted. This picture is for her, too&mdash;but I don't want the
  thing shouted from the housetops. When you go out, I wish you'd shut the
  door."</p>

  <p>The Old Man, thoroughly subdued, took the hint. He went out, and he shut
  the door.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; WEARY ADVISES.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I HAVE a short article here which may interest you, Miss
  Della," said Dunk, coming out on the porch a few days later with a Butte
  paper in his hand. The Little Doctor was swinging leisurely in the
  hammock.</p>

  <p>"It's about the picture," he added, smiling.</p>

  <p>"The picture? Oh, let me see!" The Little Doctor stopped the hammock with
  her toe and sat up. The wind had tumbled her hair about her face and drawn
  extra color to her cheeks, and she looked very sweet, Dunk thought. He held
  out the paper, pointing a well-kept finger at the place he wished her to
  read. There was a rather large headline, for news was scarce just then and
  every little thing was made the most of. The eyes of the Little Doctor clung
  greedily to the lines.</p>

  <p>"It is reported that 'The Last Stand' has been sold. The painting, which
  has been on exhibition in the lobby of the Summit Hotel, has attracted much
  attention among art lovers, and many people have viewed it in the last week.
  Duncan Gray Whitaker, the well-known mine owner and cattleman, who brought
  the picture to Butte, is said to have received an offer which the artist will
  probably accept. Mr. Whitaker still declines to give the artist's name, but
  whoever he is, he certainly has a brilliant future before him, and Montana
  can justly feel proud of him. It has been rumored that the artist is a woman,
  but the best critics are slow to believe this, claiming that the work has
  been done with a power and boldness undoubtedly masculine. Those who have
  seen 'The Last Stand' will not easily forget it, and the price offered for it
  is said to be a large one. Mr. Whitaker will leave the city to-morrow to
  consult the unknown artist, and promises, upon his return, to reveal the name
  of the modest genius who can so infuse a bit of canvas with palpitating
  life."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that? Isn't the 'modest genius' rather proud of the
  hit she has made? I wish you could have seen the old stockmen stand around it
  and tell wolf stories to one another by the hour. The women came and cried
  over it&mdash;they were so sorry for the cow. Really, Miss Della, she's the
  most famous cow in Butte, just now. I had plenty of smaller offers, but I
  waited till Senator Blake came home; he's a crank on Western pictures, and he
  has a long pocketbook and won't haggle over prices. He took it, just as I
  expected, but he insists that the artist's name must be attached to it; and
  if you take his offer, he may bring the picture down himself&mdash;for he's
  quite anxious to meet you. I am to wire your decision at once."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor watched a pale green "measuring worm" loop its way
  hurriedly along the floor of the porch. She was breathing rather quickly and
  unevenly, and she seemed to be thinking very fast. When the worm, reaching
  the end, doubled out of sight, she started the hammock swinging and leaned
  back upon her cushions.</p>

  <p>"You may tell him to come&mdash;I should like very much to see him," she
  said. "And I am very much obliged to you for the service you have performed."
  She became very much interested in a magazine, and seemed to dismiss Dunk and
  the picture entirely from her mind. Dunk, after waiting till he was convinced
  she had no intention of saying more, went off to the stables to find a
  messenger for the telegram, telling himself on the way that Miss Della
  Whitmore was a very cool young person, and not as grateful as he would like
  her to be.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor went immediately to find Chip, but that young man, who
  had been just inside the window and had heard every word, was not so easily
  found. He was down in the bunk house, thinking things. And when she did find
  him, near supper time, he was so utterly unapproachable that her courage and
  her patience failed together, and she did not mention the picture at all.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Doctor!" It was a heartening voice, sounding very sweet to the
  ears of the Little Doctor just then. She turned eagerly, her arms still
  clasping Silver's neck. She had come down to the corral to feed him sugar and
  tell him what a very difficult young man his master was, and how he held her
  at arm's length with his manner, and yet was nice and friendly and sunny
  enough&mdash;like the sun shining on an iceberg. But human sympathy was
  within reach of her hand, and it was much more satisfying than the mute
  sympathy of a horse.</p>

  <p>"Weary Willy Davidson, you don't know how glad I am to see you! As the
  sayin' is: 'Yuh think of angels an' their opposets ain't fur off.' I
  <i>am</i> glad to see you."</p>

  <p>"Dirt and all?" grinned Weary, for he had ridden far in the heat, and was
  dust-grimed and travelworn. He pulled the saddle off Glory, also, travelworn
  and sweat-grimed, and gave him an affectionate slap of dismissal.</p>

  <p>"I'd chance money you wasn't thinking of me," he said, pointedly. "How is
  the old ranch, anyhow? Splinter up, yet?"</p>

  <p>"You must think I'm a feeble excuse for a doctor," retorted she. "Of
  course he's up. He walks all around the house and yard with a cane; I
  promoted him from crutches yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Good shot! That was sure a bad foot he had on him, and I didn't
  know&mdash;What's he been putting in the time at? Making pictures&mdash;or
  love?"</p>

  <p>"Pictures," said the Little Doctor, hastily, laying her cheek against
  Silver's mane. "I'd like to see him making love!"</p>

  <p>"Yuh would?" said Weary, innocently, disregarding the irony of her tone.
  "Well, if yuh ever do, I tell yuh right now you'll see the real thing. If he
  makes love like he does other things, there won't any female girl dodge his
  loop, that's straight. What about the pictures?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he drew a picture of J. G. sliding down the kitchen steps, before
  he was out of bed. And he made a picture of Dunk, that time Banjo bucked him
  off&mdash;you saw that happen, I suppose&mdash;and it was great! Dunk was
  standing on his head in front of his horse, but I can't show you it, because
  it blew out of the window and landed at Dunk's feet in the path, and he
  picked it up and tore it into little bits. And he doesn't play in Chip's yard
  any more."</p>

  <p>"He never did," grinned Weary. "Dunk's a great hand to go around shooting
  off his mouth about things he's no business to buy into, and old Splinter let
  him down on his face once or twice. Chip can sure give a man a hard fall when
  he wants to, and not use many words, either. What little he does say
  generally counts."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor's memory squirmed assentingly. "It's the tone he uses,"
  she said, reflectively. "The way he can say 'yes,' sometimes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've bumped into that, huh? Bert Rogers lit into him with a tent peg
  once, for saying yes at him. They sure was busy for a few minutes. I just sat
  in the shade of a wagon wheel and laughed till I near cracked a rib. When
  they got through they laughed, too, and they played ten games uh pool
  together that night, and got&mdash;" Weary caught himself up suddenly. "Pool
  ain't any gambling game," he hastened to explain. "It's just knocking balls
  into the pockets, innocent like, yuh see."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Davidson, there's something I'd like to tell you about. Will you wait
  a few minutes more for your supper?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Weary; wonderingly, and sat down upon the edge of the
  watering trough.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor, her arms still around Silver's neck, told him all about
  "The Last Stand," and "The Spoils of Victory," and Chip, and Dunk, and
  herself. And Weary listened silently, digging little trenches in the hard
  soil with the rowels of his spurs, and, knowing Chip as he did, understanding
  the matter much better than did the Little Doctor.</p>

  <p>"And he doesn't seem to know that I never meant to claim the picture as my
  work, and I can't explain while he acts so&mdash;oh, you know how he can act.
  And Dunk wouldn't have sold the picture if he had known Chip painted it, and
  it was wrong, of course, but I did so want Chip to have some real
  encouragement so he would make that his life work. <i>You</i> know he is
  fitted for something better than cow-punching. And now the picture has made a
  hit and brought a good price, and he must own it. Dunk will be furious, of
  course, but that doesn't matter to me&mdash;it's Chip that I can't seem to
  manage."</p>

  <p>Weary smiled queerly down at his spurs.</p>

  <p>"It's a cinch you could manage him, easy enough, if you took the right way
  to do it," he said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Probably the right way would be too much trouble," said the Little
  Doctor, with her chin well up. "Once I get this picture deal settled
  satisfactorily, I'm quite willing to resign and let him manage himself.
  Senator Blake is coming to-morrow, and I'm so glad you will be here to help
  me."</p>

  <p>"I'd sure like to see yuh through with the deal. Old Blake won't be hard
  to throw&mdash;I know him, and so does Chip. Didn't he tell yuh about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me!" flashed the Little Doctor. "I told him Senator Blake was
  coming, and that he wanted to buy the picture, and he just made him a
  cigarette and said, 'Ye&mdash;e-es?' And after that there wasn't any
  conversation of any description!"</p>

  <p>Weary threw back his head and laughed.</p>

  <p>"That sure sounds just like him," he said, and at that minute Chip himself
  hobbled into the corral, and the Little Doctor hastened to leave it and
  retreat to the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; WHEN A MAIDEN WILLS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was Dunk who drove to meet the train, next day, and it
  was an extremely nervous young woman who met Senator Blake upon the porch.
  Chip sprawled in the hammock on the east porch, out of sight.</p>

  <p>The senator was a little man whose coat did not fit, and whose hair was
  sandy and sparse, and who had keen, twinkling blue eyes which managed to see
  a great deal more than one would suspect from the rest of his face. He pumped
  the Little Doctor's hand up and down three times and called her "My dear
  young lady." After the first ten minutes, the Little Doctor's spirits rose
  considerably and her heart stopped thumping so she could hear it. She
  remembered what Weary had told her&mdash;that "Old Blake won't be hard to
  throw." She no longer feared the senator, but she refused to speculate upon
  what Chip might do. He seemed more approachable to-day, but that did not
  count&mdash;probably he was only reflecting Weary's sunshine, and would
  freeze solid the minute&mdash;"And so you are the mysterious genius who has
  set the Butte critics by the ears!" chuckled the senator. "They say your
  cloud treatment is all wrong, and that your coloring is too bold&mdash;but
  directly they forget all that and wonder which wolf will make the first dash,
  and how many the cow will put out of business before she goes under herself.
  Don't be offended if I say that you look more capable of portraying woolly
  white lambs at play than ravening wolves measuring the strength of their
  quarry. I must confess I was looking for the&mdash;er <i>man</i> behind that
  brush."</p>

  <p>"I told the senator coming out that it was a lady he would have to make
  terms with. He would hardly believe it," smiled Dunk.</p>

  <p>"He needn't believe it," said the Little Doctor, much more calmly than she
  felt. "I don't remember ever saying that I painted 'The Last Stand.'"</p>

  <p>Dunk threw up his head and looked at her sharply.</p>

  <p>"Genius is certainly modest," he said, with a laugh that was not nice to
  hear.</p>

  <p>"In this case, the genius is unusually modest," assented she, getting
  rather white. "Unfortunately for myself, senator, I did not paint the
  'ravening wolves' which caught your fancy. It would be utterly beyond my
  brush."</p>

  <p>A glimmering of the truth came to Dunk, and his eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Who did paint it for you? Your friend, Chip?"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor caught her breath at the venomous accent he employed,
  and the Old Man half rose from his chair. But Della could fight her own
  battles. She stood up and faced Dunk, tight- lipped and proud.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Whitaker, my friend, Mr. Bennett, of whose friendship I am
  rather proud, painted the best part of 'The Last Stand.'"</p>

  <p>"Senator Blake must forgive my being misled by your previous statement
  that the picture was yours," sneered Dunk.</p>

  <p>"I made no previous statement, Mr. Whitaker." The Little Doctor's tone was
  sweetly freezing. "I said that the picture which I had begun was finished,
  and I invited you all to look at it. It was your misfortune that you took too
  much for granted."</p>

  <p>"It's a mistake to take anything for granted where a woman is concerned.
  At the same time I shouldn't be blamed if I take it for granted
  Chip&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suppose you say the rest to me, Dunk," suggested Chip from the doorway,
  where he leaned heavily upon his cane. "It begins to look as though I held a
  hand in this game."</p>

  <p>Dunk wheeled furiously upon him.</p>

  <p>"You're playing a high hand for a forty-dollar man," he grated, "and
  you've about reached your limit. The stakes are beyond your reach, my
  friend."</p>

  <p>Chip went white with anger at the thrust, which struck deeper than Dunk
  knew. But he stood his ground.</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;es? Wait till the cards are all turned." It turned him sick,
  though, the emptiness of the boast. It was such a pitiful, ghastly
  bluff&mdash;for the cards were all against him, and he knew it. A man in
  Gilroy, Ohio, would take the trick which decided the game. Hearts were
  trumps, and Dr. Cecil Granthum had the ace.</p>

  <p>The little senator got out of his chair and faced Chip tactfully.</p>

  <p>"Kid Bennett, you rascal, aren't you going to shake hands?" His own was
  outstretched, waiting.</p>

  <p>Chip crowded several hot words off his tongue, and gave up his hand for a
  temporary pump handle.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Blake? I didn't think you'd remember me."</p>

  <p>"You didn't? How could I help it? I can feel the cold of the water yet,
  and your rope settling over my shoulders. You never gave me a chance to say
  'God bless you' for that; you just coiled up your rope&mdash;swearing all the
  time you did it, because it was wet&mdash;and rode off, dripping like a
  muskrat. What did you do it for?"</p>

  <p>"I was in a hurry to get back to camp," grinned Chip, sinking into a
  chair. "And you weren't a senator then."</p>

  <p>"It would have been all the same if I had been, I reckon," responded the
  senator, shaking Chip's hand again. "Well, well! So you are the
  genius&mdash;that sounds more likely. No offense, Miss Whitmore. Do you
  remember that picture you drew with charcoal on a piece of pine board? It
  stands on the mantel in my library, and I always point it out to my friends
  as the work of a young man with a future. And you painted 'The Last Stand!'
  Well, well! I think I'll have to send the price up another notch, just to get
  even with you for swearing at me when my lungs were so full of water I
  couldn't swear back!"</p>

  <p>While he talked he was busy unwrapping the picture which he had brought
  with him, and he reminded the Little Doctor of a loquacious peddler opening
  his pack. He was much more genial and unpretentious since Chip entered the
  room, and she wondered why. She wanted to ask about that reference to the
  water, but he stood the painting against the wall, just then, and she forgot
  everything but that.</p>

  <p>Chip's eyes clung to the scene greedily. After all, it was his&mdash; and
  he knew in his heart that it was good. After a minute he limped into his room
  and brought "The Spoils of Victory," and stood it beside "The Last
  Stand."</p>

  <p>"A&mdash;h-h!" The senator breathed the word deep in his throat and fell
  silent. Even the Old Man leaned forward in his chair that he might see the
  better. The Little Doctor could not see anything, just then, but no one
  noticed anything wrong with her eyes, for they were all down in the Bad
  Lands, watching an old range cow defend her calf.</p>

  <p>"Bennett, do the two go together?" asked the senator, at last.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I painted it for Miss Whitmore," said Chip, a dull
  glow in his cheeks.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor glanced at him quickly, rather startled, if the truth be
  known.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was just a joke, Mr. Bennett. I would much rather have you paint
  me another one&mdash;this one makes me want to cry&mdash;and a doctor must
  forego the luxury of tears. I have no claim upon either of them, Mr. Blake.
  It was like this. I started 'The Last Stand,' but I only had the background
  painted, and one day while I was gone Mr. Bennett finished it up&mdash;and it
  is his work that makes the picture worth anything. I let it pass as mine, for
  the time, but I never intended to wear the laurel crown, really. I only
  borrowed it for a little while. I hope you can make Mr. Bennett behave
  himself and put his brand on it, for if he doesn't it will go down to
  posterity unsigned. This other&mdash;'The Spoils of Victory'&mdash;he cannot
  attempt to disown, for I was away at Great Falls when he painted it, and he
  was here alone, so far as help of any kind is concerned. Now do make him be
  sensible!"</p>

  <p>The senator looked at Chip, then at the Little Doctor, chuckled and sat
  down on the couch.</p>

  <p>"Well, well! Kid Bennett hasn't changed, I see. He's just as ornery as he
  ever was. And you're the mysterious, modest genius! How did you come out
  after that dip into the old Missouri?" he asked, abruptly. "You didn't take
  cold, riding in those wet clothes, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"I? No, I was all right. I stopped at that sheep camp and borrowed some
  dry clothes." Chip was very uncomfortable. He wished Blake wouldn't keep
  bringing up that affair, which was four years old and quite trivial, in his
  opinion. It was a good thing Dunk pulled out when he saw he'd got the worst
  of it, or there'd have been trouble, most likely. And Blake&mdash;The senator
  went on, addressing the others.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what this young fellow did, four years ago this last spring?
  I tried to cross the river near my place in a little boat, while the water
  was high. Bennett, here, came along and swore that a man with no more sense
  than I had ought to drown&mdash; which was very true, I admit. I had just got
  out a nice little distance for drowning properly, when a tree came bobbing
  along and upset my boat, and Kid Bennett, as we called him then, rode in as
  far as he could&mdash;which was a great deal further than was safe for
  him&mdash;and roped me, just as he would have roped a yearling. Ha! ha! I can
  see him yet, scowling at me and whirling the loop over his head ready to
  throw. A picture of <i>that</i>, now! When he had dragged me to the bank he
  used some rather strong language&mdash;a cowboy does hate to wet his
  rope&mdash;and rode off before I had a chance to thank him. This is the first
  time I've seen him since then."</p>

  <p>Chip got very red.</p>

  <p>"I was young and foolish, those days, and you weren't a senator," he
  repeated, apologetically.</p>

  <p>"My being a senator wouldn't have mattered at all. They've been changing
  your name, over this side the river, I see. How did that happen?"</p>

  <p>Again Chip was uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"We've got a cook that is out of sight when it comes to Saratoga chips,
  and I'm a fiend for them, you see. The boys got to calling me Saratoga Chip,
  and then they cut it down to Chip and stuck to it."</p>

  <p>"I see. There was a fellow with you over there&mdash;Davidson. What has
  become of him?"</p>

  <p>"Weary? He works here, too. He's down in the bunk house now, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Well, well! Let's go and hunt him up&mdash;and we can settle about the
  pictures at the same time. You seem to be crippled. How did that happen? Some
  dare-devil performance, I expect."</p>

  <p>The senator smiled reassuringly at the Little Doctor and got Chip out of
  the house and down in the bunk house with Weary, and whatever means he used
  to make Chip "behave himself," they certainly were a success. For when he
  left, the next day, he left behind him a check of generous size, and Chip was
  not so aloof as he had been with the Little Doctor, and planned with her at
  least a dozen pictures which he meant to paint some time.</p>

  <p>There was one which he did paint at once, however&mdash;though no one saw
  it but Della. It was the picture of a slim young woman with gray eyes and an
  old felt hat on her head, standing with her fingers tangled in the mane of a
  chestnut horse.</p>

  <p>If there was a heartache in the work, if the brush touched the slim figure
  caressingly and lingered wistfully upon the face, no one knew but Chip, and
  Chip had learned long ago to keep his own counsel. There were some thoughts
  which he could not whisper into even Silver's ear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; DR. CECIL GRANTHUM.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Little Doctor leaned from the window and called down the
  hill to her recovered patient&mdash;more properly, her nearly recovered
  patient; for Chip still walked with the aid of a cane, though by making use
  of only one stirrup he could ride very well. He limped up the hill to her,
  and sat down on the top step of the porch.</p>

  <p>"What's the excitement now?" he asked, banteringly.</p>

  <p>"I've got the best, the most <i>splendid</i> news&mdash;you couldn't guess
  what in a thousand years!"</p>

  <p>"Then I won't try. It's too hot." Chip took off his hat and fanned himself
  with it.</p>

  <p>"Well, can't you <i>look</i> a little bit excited? Try and look the way I
  feel! Anybody as cool as you are shouldn't suffer with the heat."</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I get pretty hot, sometimes. Well, what is the most
  splendid news? Can't you tell a fellow, after calling him up here in the hot
  sun?"</p>

  <p>"Well, listen. The Gilroy hospital&mdash;you know, where Cecil is"&mdash;
  Chip knew&mdash;"has a case of blighted love and shattered hopes"&mdash;
  Chip's foolish, man-heart nearly turned a somersault. Was it
  possible?&mdash;"and it's the luckiest thing ever happened."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" Chip wished to goodness she would get to the point. She could be
  direct enough in her statements when what she said was going to hurt a
  fellow. His heart was thumping so it hurt him.</p>

  <p>"Yes. A doctor there was planning to get married and go away on his
  honeymoon, you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chip nodded, half suffocated with crowding, incredulous hopes.</p>

  <p>"Well, and now he isn't. His ladylove was faithless and loves another, and
  his honeymoon is indefinitely postponed. Do you see now where the good news
  comes in?"</p>

  <p>Chip shook his head once and looked away up the grade. Funny, but
  something had gone wrong with his throat. He was half choked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you <i>are</i> dull! Now that fellow isn't going to have any
  vacation, so Cecil can come out, right away! Next week! Think of it!"</p>

  <p>Chip tried to think of it, but he couldn't think of anything, just then.
  He was only conscious of wishing Whizzer had made a finish of the job, up
  there on the Hog's Back that day. His heart no longer thumped&mdash;it was
  throbbing in a tired, listless fashion.</p>

  <p>"Why can't you look a little bit pleased?" smiled the torturer from the
  window. "You sit there like a&mdash;an Indian before a cigar store. You've
  just about the same expression."</p>

  <p>"I can't help it. I never was fierce to meet strangers, somehow."</p>

  <p>"Judging from my own experience, I think you are uncommonly fierce at
  meeting strangers. I haven't forgotten how unmercifully you snubbed me when I
  came to the ranch, or how you risked my neck on the grade, up there, trying
  to make me scared enough to scream. I didn't, though! I wanted to, I'll
  admit, when you made the horses run down the steepest part&mdash;but I
  didn't, and so I could easily forgive you."</p>

  <p>"Could you?" said Chip, in a colorless tone.</p>

  <p>"If you had gained your object, I couldn't have," remarked she.</p>

  <p>"I did, though."</p>

  <p>"You did? Didn't you do it just to frighten me?"</p>

  <p>Chip gave her a glance of weary tolerance. "You must think I've about as
  much sense as a jack rabbit; I was taking long chances to run that hill."</p>

  <p>"Well, for pity's sake, what did you do it for?"</p>

  <p>"It was the only thing to do. How do you think we'd have come out of the
  mix-up if we had met Banjo on the Hog's Back, where there isn't room to pass?
  Don't you think we'd have been pretty well smashed up, both of us, by the
  time we got to the bottom of that gully, there? A runaway horse is a nasty
  thing to meet, let me tell you&mdash;especially when it's as scared as Banjo
  was. They won't turn out; they just go straight ahead, and let the other
  fellow get out of the way if he can."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I thought you did it just for a joke," said the Little Doctor,
  weakly. "I told Cecil you did it to frighten me, and Cecil said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need to tell me what Cecil said," Chip remarked, with
  the quiet tone that made one very uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't anything so dreadful, you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to know. When is he coming, did you say?"</p>

  <p>"Next Wednesday&mdash;and this is Friday. I know you'll like Cecil."</p>

  <p>Chip made him a cigarette, but he hadn't heart enough to light it. He held
  it absently in his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Everybody likes Cecil."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" Secretly, Chip had his doubts. He knew one that didn't&mdash; and
  wouldn't.</p>

  <p>"We'll have all kinds of fun, and go everywhere and do everything. As soon
  as the round-up is over, I think I'll make J. G. give another dance, but I'll
  take care that the drug store is safely locked away. And some day we'll take
  a lunch and go prowling around down in the Bad Lands&mdash;you'll have to go,
  so we won't get lost&mdash;and we'll have Len Adams and Rena and the
  schoolma'am over here often, and&mdash;oh, my brain just buzzes with plans.
  I'm so anxious for Cecil to see the Countess and&mdash;well, everybody around
  here. You, too."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure a curiosity," said Chip, getting on his feet again. "I've always
  had the name of being something of a freak&mdash;I don't wonder you want to
  exhibit me to your&mdash;friends." He went down the hill to the bunk house,
  holding the unlighted cigarette still in his fingers.</p>

  <p>When Slim opened the door to tell him supper was ready, he found Chip
  lying on his bed, his face buried in his arms.</p>

  <p>If Chip never had understood before how a man can stand up straight on the
  gallows, throw back his shoulders and smile at his executioner, he learned
  the secret during that twenty-two mile drive to Dry Lake with the Little
  Doctor. He would have shirked the ordeal gladly, and laid awake o' nights
  planning subterfuges that would relieve him, but the Little Doctor seemed
  almost malignantly innocent and managed to checkmate every turn. She could
  not trust anyone else to manage the creams; she was afraid Slim might get
  drunk while they waited for the train, or forget his duties in a game. She
  hated J. G.'s way of fussing over trifles, and wouldn't have him along. Chip
  was not able to help much with the ranch work, and she knew he could manage
  the horses so much better than anyone else&mdash;and Cecil had been in a
  runaway once, and so was dreadfully nervous behind a strange team&mdash;which
  last declaration set Chip's lips a-curl.</p>

  <p>The woman usually does have her own way in the end, and so Chip marched to
  the gallows with his chin well up, smiling at his executioner.</p>

  <p>The train was late. The Little Doctor waited in the hotel parlor, and Chip
  waited in the hotel saloon, longing to turn a deluge of whisky down his
  throat to deaden that unbearable, heavy ache in his heart&mdash;but instead
  he played pool with Bert Rogers, who happened to be in town that day, and
  took cigars after each game instead of whiskey, varying the monotony
  occasionally by lemon soda, till he was fairly sick.</p>

  <p>Then the station agent telephoned up that the train was coming, and Chip
  threw down his billiard cue, swallowed another glass of lemon soda and gagged
  over it, sent Bert Rogers to tell the Little Doctor the train was coming, and
  went after the team.</p>

  <p>He let the creams lope in the harness all the way to the depot, excusing
  himself on the plea that the time was short; the fact was, Chip wanted the
  agony over as soon as possible; nothing so wears a man's patience as to have
  a disagreeable duty drag. At the depot he drove around to the back where
  freight was unloaded, with the explanation that the creams were afraid of the
  train&mdash; and the fact of that matter was, that Chip was afraid Dr. Cecil
  might greet the Little Doctor with a kiss&mdash;he'd be a fool if he
  didn't&mdash;and Chip did not want to witness the salute.</p>

  <p>Sitting with his well foot in the brake, he pictured the scene on the
  other side of the building when the train pulled in and stopped. He could not
  hear much, on account of the noise the engine made pumping air, but he could
  guess about what was taking place. Now, the fellow was on the platform,
  probably, and he had a suit case in one hand and a light tan overcoat over
  the other arm, and now he was advancing toward the Little Doctor, who would
  have grown shy and remained by the waiting-room door. Now he had changed his
  suit case to the other hand, and was bending down over&mdash;oh, hell! He'd
  settle up with the Old Man and pull out, back across the river. Old Blake
  would give him work on his ranch over there, that was a cinch. And the Little
  Doctor could have her Cecil and be hanged to him. He would go
  to-morrow&mdash;er&mdash;no, he'd have to wait till Silver was able to make
  the trip, for he wouldn't leave him behind. No, he couldn't go just
  yet&mdash;he'd have to stay with the deal another month. He wouldn't stay a
  day longer than he had to, thought you could gamble on that.</p>

  <p>There&mdash;the train was sliding out&mdash;say, what if the fellow hadn't
  come, though? Such a possibility had not before occurred to Chip- -wouldn't
  the Little Doctor be fighty, though? Serve her right, the little
  flirt&mdash;er&mdash;no, he couldn't think anything against the Little
  Doctor, no matter what she did. No, he'd sure hate to see her
  disappointed&mdash;still, if the fellow <i>hadn't</i> come, Chip wouldn't be
  to blame for that, and Dr. Cecil&mdash;"Can't you drive around to the
  platform now, to load in the trunk?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Chip, with deceitful cheerfulness, and took his foot off the
  brake, while the Little Doctor went back to her Cecil.</p>

  <p>The agent had the trunk on the baggage truck and trundled it along the
  platform, and Chip's eyes searched for his enemy. They were in the waiting
  room; he could hear that laugh of the Little Doctor's&mdash;Lord, how he
  hated to hear it&mdash;directed at some other fellow, that is. Yes, there was
  the suit case&mdash;it looked just as he had expected it would&mdash;and
  there was a glimpse of tan cloth just inside the door. Chip turned to help
  the agent push the suit case under the seat, where it was an exceeding tight
  fit getting it there, with the trunk taking up so much room.</p>

  <p>When he straightened up the Little Doctor stood ready to get into the
  buggy, and behind her stood Dr. Cecil Granthum, smiling in a way that
  disclosed some very nice teeth.</p>

  <p>"Cecil, this is Mr. Bennett&mdash;the 'Chip' that I have mentioned as
  being at the ranch. Chip, allow me to present Dr. Cecil Granthum."</p>

  <p>Dr. Cecil advanced with hand out invitingly. "I've heard so much about
  Chip that I feel very well acquainted. I hope you won't expect me to call you
  Mr. Bennett, for I shan't, you know."</p>

  <p>Too utterly at sea to make reply, Chip took the offered hand in his. Hate
  Dr. Cecil? How could he hate this big, breezy, blue- eyed young woman? She
  shook his hand heartily and smiled deep into his troubled eyes, and drew the
  poison from his wounds in that one glance.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor plumped into the seat and made room for Cecil, like the
  spoiled little girl that she was, compared with the other.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to sit in the middle. Cecil, you're the biggest and you can
  easily hang on&mdash;and, beside, this young man is so fierce with strangers
  that he'd snub you something awful if we'd give him a chance. He's been
  scheming, ever since I told him you were coming, to get out of driving in to
  meet you. He tried to make me take Slim. Slim!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Cecil smiled at Chip behind the Little Doctor's back, and Chip could
  have hugged her then and there, for he knew, somehow, that she understood and
  was his friend.</p>

  <p>I should like very much to say that it seemed to Chip that the sun shone
  brighter, and that the grass was greener, and the sky several shades bluer,
  on that homeward drive&mdash;but I must record the facts, which are
  these:</p>

  <p>Chip did not know whether the sun shone or the moon, and he didn't
  care&mdash;just so there was light to see the hair blowing about the Little
  Doctor's face, and to watch the dimple come and go in the cheek next him. And
  whether the grass was green and the sky blue, or whether the reverse was the
  case, he didn't know; and if you had asked him, he might have said tersely
  that he didn't care a darn about the grass&mdash;that is, if he gave you
  sufficient attention to reply at all.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; LOVE FINDS ITS HOUR.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"BAY DENVER'S broke out uh the little pasture," announced
  the Old Man, putting his head in at the door of the blacksmith shop where
  Chip was hammering gayly upon a bent branding iron, for want of a better way
  to kill time and give vent to his surplus energy. "I wish you'd saddle up an'
  go after him, Chip, if yuh can. I just seen him takin' down the coulee trail
  like a scared coyote."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I'll go. Darn that old villain, he'd jump a fence forty feet high
  if he took a notion that way." Chip threw down the hammer and reached for his
  coat.</p>

  <p>"I guess the fence must be down som'ers. I'll go take a look. Say! Dell
  ain't come back from Denson's yit. Yuh want t' watch out Denver don't meet
  her&mdash;he'd scare the liver out uh her."</p>

  <p>Chip was well aware that the Little Doctor had not returned from Denson's,
  where she had been summoned to attend one of the children, who had run a
  rusty nail into her foot. She had gone alone, for Dr. Cecil was learning to
  make bread, and had refused to budge from the kitchen till her first batch
  was safely baked.</p>

  <p>Chip limped hurriedly to the corral, and two minutes later was clattering
  down the coulee upon Blazes, after the runaway.</p>

  <p>Denver was a beautiful bay stallion, the pride and terror of the ranch. He
  was noted for his speed and his vindictive hatred of the more plebeian
  horses, scarcely one of which but had, at some time, felt his teeth in their
  flesh&mdash;and he was hated and feared by them all.</p>

  <p>He stopped at the place where the trail forked, tossed his crinkly mane
  triumphantly and looked back. Freedom was sweet to him&mdash;sweet as it was
  rare. His world was a roomy box stall with a small, high corral adjoining it
  for exercise, with an occasional day in the little pasture as a great treat.
  Two miles was a long, long way from home, it seemed to him. He watched the
  hill behind a moment, threw up his head and trotted off up the trail to
  Denson's.</p>

  <p>Chip, galloping madly, caught a glimpse of the fugitive a mile away, set
  his teeth together, and swung Blazes sharply off the trail into a bypath
  which intersected the road further on. He hoped the Little Doctor was safe at
  Denson's, but at that very moment he saw her ride slowly over a distant
  ridge.</p>

  <p>Now there was a race; Denver, cantering gleefully down the trail, Chip
  spurring desperately across the prairie.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor had disappeared into a hollow with Concho pacing slowly,
  half asleep, the reins drooping low on his neck. The Little Doctor loved to
  dream along the road, and Concho had learned to do likewise&mdash;and to
  enjoy it very much.</p>

  <p>At the crest of the next hill she looked up, saw herself the apex of a
  rapidly shortening triangle, and grasped instantly the situation; she had
  peeped admiringly and fearsomely between the stout rails of the little, round
  corral too often not to know Denver when she saw him, and in a panic turned
  from the trail toward Chip. Concho was rudely awakened by a stinging blow
  from her whip&mdash;a blow which filled him with astonishment and reproach.
  He laid back his ears and galloped angrily&mdash;not in the path&mdash;the
  Little Doctor was too frightened for that&mdash;but straight as a hawk would
  fly. Denver, marking Concho for his prey and not to be easily cheated, turned
  and followed.</p>

  <p>Chip swore inwardly and kept straight ahead, leaving the path himself to
  do so. He knew a deep washout lay now between himself and the Little Doctor,
  and his only hope was to get within speaking distance before she was
  overtaken.</p>

  <p>Concho fled to the very brink of the washout and stopped so suddenly that
  his forefeet plowed a furrow in the grass, and the Little Doctor came near
  going clean over his head. She recovered her balance, and cast a frightened
  glance over her shoulder; Denver was rushing down upon them like an express
  train.</p>

  <p>"Get off&mdash;your&mdash;H-O-R-S-E!" shouted Chip, making a trumpet of
  his hands. "Fight Denver off&mdash;with&mdash;your whip!"</p>

  <p>The last command the Little Doctor did not hear distinctly. The first she
  made haste to obey. Throwing herself from the saddle, she slid precipitately
  into the washout just as Denver thundered up, snorting a challenge. Concho,
  scared out of his wits, turned and tore off down the washout, whipped around
  the end of it and made for home, his enemy at his heels and Chip after the
  two of them, leaning low over his horse as Blazes, catching the excitement
  and urged by the spurs, ran like an antelope.</p><a id="pic3"

  <p>The Little Doctor, climbing the steep bank to level ground, gazed after
  the fleeing group with consternation. Here was she a long four miles from
  home&mdash;five, if she followed the windings of the trail&mdash;and it
  looked very much as if her two feet must take her there. The prospect was not
  an enlivening one, but she started off across the prairie very
  philosophically at first, very dejectedly later on, and very angrily at last.
  The sun was scorching, and it was dinner time, and she was hungry, and hot,
  and tired, and&mdash;"mad." She did not bless her rescuer; she heaped
  maledictions upon his head&mdash;mild ones at first, but growing perceptibly
  more forcible and less genteel as the way grew rougher, and her feet grew
  wearier, and her stomach emptier. Then, as if her troubles were all to come
  in a lump&mdash;as they have a way of doing&mdash;she stepped squarely into a
  bunch of "pincushion" cactus.</p>

  <p>"I just <i>hate</i> Montana!" she burst out, vehemently, blinking back
  some tears. "I don't care if Cecil did just come day before yesterday&mdash;I
  shall pack up and go back home. She can stay if she wants to, but I won't
  live here another day. I hate Chip Bennett, too, and I'll tell him so if I
  ever get home. I don't see what J. G.'s thinking of, to live in such a
  God-forgotten hole, where there's nothing but miles upon miles of
  cactuses&mdash;" The downfall of Eastern up-bringing! To deliberately say
  "cactuses"&mdash;but the provocation was great, I admit. If any man doubts,
  let him tread thin-shod upon a healthy little "pincushion" and be convinced.
  I think he will confess that "cactuses" is an exceedingly conservative
  epithet, and all too mild for the occasion.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, Chip, leading Concho by the bridle rein, rode over the
  brow of a hill and came suddenly upon the Little Doctor, sitting
  disconsolately upon a rock. She had one shoe off, and was striving petulantly
  to extract a cactus thorn from the leather with a hat pin. Chip rode close
  and stopped, regarding her with satisfaction from the saddle. It was the
  first time he had succeeded in finding the Little Doctor alone since the
  arrival of Dr. Cecil Granthum&mdash;God bless her!</p>

  <p>"Hello! What you trying to do?"</p>

  <p>No answer. The Little Doctor refused even to lift her lashes, which were
  wet and clung together in little groups of two or three. Chip also observed
  that there were suggestive streaks upon her cheeks&mdash;and not a sign of a
  dimple anywhere. He lifted one leg over the horn of the saddle to ease his
  ankle, which still pained him a little after a ride, and watched her a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Doctor? Step on a cactus?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," snapped the Doctor in a tone to take one's head off, "I didn't
  step on a cactus&mdash;I just walked all over acres and acres of them!"</p>

  <p>There was a suspicious gurgle from somewhere. The Little Doctor looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"Don't hesitate to laugh, Mr. Bennett, if you happen to feel that
  way!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bennett evidently felt that way. He rocked in the saddle, and shouted
  with laughter. The Little Doctor stood this for as much as a minute.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no doubt it's very funny to set me afoot away off from
  everywhere&mdash;" Her voice quivered and broke from self-pity; her head bent
  lower over her shoe.</p>

  <p>Chip made haste to stifle his mirth, in fear that she was going to cry. He
  couldn't have endured that. He reached for his tobacco and began to make a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I didn't set you afoot," he said. "That was a bad break you made
  yourself. Why didn't you do as I told you&mdash;hang to the bridle and fight
  Denver off with your whip? You had one."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and let him gnaw me!"</p>

  <p>Chip gurgled again, and drew the tobacco sack shut with his teeth. "He
  wouldn't 'gnaw' you&mdash;he wouldn't have come near you. He's whip trained.
  And I'd have been there myself in another minute."</p>

  <p>"I didn't want you there! And I don't pretend to be a horse- trainer, Mr.
  Bennett. There's several things about your old ranch life that I don't
  know&mdash;and don't want to know! I'm going back to Ohio to-morrow, so
  there!"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" He drew a match sharply along his stamped saddle-skirt and applied
  it to the cigarette, pinched out the blaze with extreme care, and tossed the
  match-end facetiously against Concho's nose. He did not seem particularly
  alarmed at her threat&mdash;or, perhaps, he did not care. The Little Doctor
  prodded savagely at her shoe, too angry to see the thorn, and Chip drove
  another nail into his coffin with apparent relish, and watched her. After a
  little, he slid to the ground and limped over to her.</p>

  <p>"Here, give me that shoe; you'll have it all picked to pieces and not get
  the thorn, either. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"<i>It</i>?" sniffed the Little Doctor, surrendering the shoe with
  hypocritical reluctance. "It? There's a dozen, at the very least!"</p>

  <p>Chip emptied his lungs of smoke, and turned the shoe in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I guess not&mdash;there isn't room in this little bit of leather for
  a dozen. Two would be crowded."</p>

  <p>"I detest flattery above all things!" But, being a woman, the brow of the
  Little Doctor cleared perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"Yes? You're just like me in that respect. I love the truth."</p>

  <p>Thinking of Dr. Cecil, the Little Doctor grew guiltily red. But she had
  never said Cecil was a man, she reflected, with what comfort she could. The
  boys, like Dunk, had simply made the mistake of taking too much for
  granted.</p>

  <p>Chip opened the smallest blade of his knife deliberately, sat down upon a
  neighboring rock and finished his cigarette, still turning the shoe
  reflectively&mdash;and caressingly&mdash;in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'd smile to see the Countess try to put that shoe on," he remarked,
  holding the cigarette in some mysterious manner on his lip. "I'll bet she
  couldn't get one toe in it."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it matters, whether she could or not," snapped the
  Little Doctor. "For goodness sake, hurry!"</p>

  <p>"You're pretty mad, aren't you?" inquired he, shoving his hat back off his
  forehead, and looking at her as though he enjoyed doing so.</p>

  <p>"Do I look mad?" asked she, tartly.</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man you do!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;my appearance doesn't half express the state of my mind!"</p>

  <p>"Your mind must be in an awful state."</p>

  <p>"It is."</p>

  <p>Two minutes passed silently.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Cecil's bread is done&mdash;she gave me a slice as big as your hat,
  with butter and jelly on it. It was out of sight."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor groaned, and rallied.</p>

  <p>"Butter and jelly on my hat, did you say?"</p>

  <p>"Not on your hat&mdash;on the bread. I ate it coming back down the
  coulee&mdash;and I sure had my hands full, leading Concho, too."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor held back the question trembling on her hungry, parched
  lips as long as she could, but it would come.</p>

  <p>"Was it good?"</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man!" said Chip, briefly and eloquently.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor sighed.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Cecil Granthum's a mighty good fellow&mdash;I'm stuck on him,
  myself&mdash;and if I haven't got the symptoms sized up wrong, the Old Man's
  <i>going</i> to be."</p>

  <p>"That's all the good it will do him. Cecil and I are going somewhere and
  practice medicine together&mdash;and we aren't either of us going to get
  married, ever!"</p>

  <p>"Have you got the papers for that?" grinned Chip, utterly unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I have my license," said the Little Doctor, coldly.</p>

  <p>"You're ahead of me there, for I haven't&mdash;yet. I can soon get one,
  though."</p>

  <p>"I wish to goodness you'd hurry up with that shoe! I'm half starved."</p>

  <p>"Well, show me a dimple and you can have it. My, you are cranky!"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor showed him two, and Chip laid the shoe in her
  lap&mdash;after he had surprised himself, and the doctor, by planting a
  daring little kiss upon the toe.</p>

  <p>"The idea!" exclaimed she, with a feeble show of indignation, and slipped
  her foot hurriedly into its orthodox covering. Feeling his inscrutable, hazel
  eyes upon her, she blushed uncomfortably and fumbled the laces.</p>

  <p>"You better let me lace that shoe&mdash;you won't have it done in a
  thousand years, at that gait."</p>

  <p>"If you're in a hurry," said she, without looking at him, "you can ride on
  ahead. It would please me better if you did."</p>

  <p>"Yes? You've been pleased all summer&mdash;at my expense. I'm going to
  please myself, this time. It's my deal, Little Doctor. Do you want to know
  what's trumps?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't!" Still without looking at him, she tied her shoelaces with
  an impatient twitch that came near breaking them, and walked haughtily to
  where Concho stood dutifully waiting. With an impulsive movement, she threw
  her arms around his neck, and hid her hot face against his scanty mane.</p>

  <p>A pair of arms clad in pink-and-white striped sleeves went suddenly about
  her. Her clasp on Concho loosened and she threw back her head,
  startled&mdash;to be still more startled at the touch of lips that were
  curved and thin and masterful. The arms whirled her about and held her
  against a heart which her trained senses knew at once was beating very
  irregularly.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you ought to be ashamed!" she asserted feebly, at last.</p>

  <p>"I'm not, though." The arms tightened their clasp a little.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you don't <i>seem</i> to be," admitted the Little Doctor,
  meekly.</p>

  <p>For answer he kissed her hungrily&mdash;not once, but many times.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to let me go?" she demanded, afterward, but very
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"No," said he, boldly. "I'm going to keep you&mdash;always." There was
  conviction in the tone.</p>

  <p>She stood silent a minute, listening to his heart and her own, and
  digesting this bit of news.</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;quite sure about&mdash;that?" she asked at length.</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man! Unless"&mdash;he held her off and looked at
  her&mdash;"you don't like me. But you do, don't you?" His eyes were searching
  her face.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor struggled to release herself from the arms which held
  her unyieldingly and tenderly. Failing this, she raised her eyes to the white
  silk handkerchief knotted around his throat; to the chin; to the lips,
  wistful with their well defined curve; to the eyes, where they lingered shyly
  a moment, and then looked away to the horizon.</p>

  <p>"Don't you like me? Say!" He gave her a gentle shake.</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;er-it doesn't seem to matter, whether I do or not," she retorted
  with growing spirit&mdash;witness the dimple dodging into her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it does&mdash;it matters a whole heap. You've dealt me misery ever
  since I first set eyes on you&mdash;and I believe, on my soul, you liked to
  watch me squirm! But you do like me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'd tell a man!" said she, and immediately hid a very red face
  from sight of him.</p>

  <p>Concho turned his head and gazed wonderingly upon the two. What amazed him
  was to see Chip kissing his mistress again and again, and to hear the
  idolatrous tone in which he was saying "<i>My</i> Little Doctor!"</p>
