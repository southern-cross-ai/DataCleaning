<h2>BOOK NUMBER ONE&mdash;THE SAILORMAN</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch101" id="ch101"></a>CHAPTER I. INTRODUCES THE
INHERITOR</h3>

<p>Sam stared down at the blunt toes of his big, clumsy shoes and
shook his big, rather clumsy head that appeared set rather
awkwardly on his powerful shoulders as, crouched ungracefully in
the elbow-chair, he pondered this amazing thing that had befallen,
while the keen-faced lawyer, silver-rimmed spectacles on sharp
nose, viewed him with a certain supercilious perplexity.</p>

<p>"Money, eh?" enquired Sam, at last. "A lot of it, eh, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. Joliffe, having smoothed his trim wig, coughed and waxed
eloquent:</p>

<p>"Indeed, a vast heritage! An e-normous fortune! Quite
stu-pendous! Your father, the late Earl of Wrybourne, was an
immensely wealthy person&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a dev'lish scoundrel!" growled Sam, with gesture so fierce
and sudden that Mr. Joliffe started and clutched his toppling
spectacles; then, having readjusted them, gazed at the speaker with
even closer scrutiny. This tall, muscular fellow whose shabby
garments smacked of the sea, and whose sun-tanned face, grim by
nature, was rendered even more so by the line of a newly healed
scar that ran from left eyebrow to vanish in the thick-curling
chestnut hair.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Sam, fiercely. "Earl or no, I hate to think he
was my father. Are you sure o' this, sir?"</p>

<p>"Beyond all possible doubt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then curse him for that too!"</p>

<p>"May I venture to enquire why&mdash;what you know or may have
heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay," replied Sam, clenching his hands to quivering fists, "I
know he compelled my mother to slave or starve...She did both!"</p>

<p>Mr. Joliffe coughed gently behind two fingers and was about to
speak when Sam continued:</p>

<p>"All this dam' money! And now! when it's too late! Things always
did go dev'lish contrary with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Contrary?" echoed Mr. Joliffe, clutching at his spectacles
again.</p>

<p>"Contrary, ay!" nodded Sam. "This money and so on will come
pretty handy, I suppose, but&mdash;not as it might ha' done, for,
d'ye see&mdash;she's dead! This mother o' mine...and not so long
ago! This money might have helped her to ride out the storm and
weather Old Man Death,&mdash;but no, it comes too late! She'd
worked so precious hard all her life&mdash;she forgot to leave
off...Worked? Ay, she did so&mdash;and mostly for me, my
schooling&mdash;to feed, clothe and keep me decent&mdash;ah, she
was a noble mother!" The deep, gentle voice hushed on the word and
Mr. Joliffe peered through his glasses and over them at the
speaker's bronzed, scarred features, beneath tousled shock of hair,
thick brows knit above long-lashed, grey eyes, arrogant jut of nose
and chin with close-lipped, shapely mouth between; finally he
coughed again and enquired:</p>

<p>"You are, or were, a sailor, a privateer's man, I
understand?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, first mate of the <i>Fortune</i>, privateer. And
mighty fortunate she's been, thanks to her commander, Captain Ned
Harlow."</p>

<p>"You have apparently been in action recently?"</p>

<p>"Off and on," answered Sam, touching his scar with sinewy
finger. "I got this when we boarded and took the <i>Citoyenne</i>
frigate off Toulon. Ay, I've been at sea a pretty goodish time and
afore that, tried my hand at many things. For Lord love
me&mdash;even as a boy I couldn't bear to see that mother o' mine
slaving her life away&mdash;stitching, washing and scrubbing for
other folk, so I cut school and turned general handy-man and
finally shipped myself to sea in the <i>Albatross</i> whaler,
became a chief harpooner and made good money, took to privateering
and made a good deal more, prize-money, d'ye see&mdash;most of
which I saved and brought home to mother, too late, of
course...seeing she'd been dead and buried a month or more. No word
of complaint in any of her letters...such cheery letters&mdash;Oh,
but damme," he broke off, "you don't want to hear all this! So get
on, sir, and talk business."</p>

<p>"Con-found business!" exclaimed Mr. Joliffe, to his own
surprise, and moved despite himself by the deep, passionate
sincerity of these softly-uttered, slow-spoken words. "Pray
continue! Tell me more of yourself and your
heroic&mdash;mother."</p>

<p>"Thankee, Mr. Joliffe! 'Heroic' is the word, for she was indeed
such a grand soul&mdash;ay, brave to the end...smiling away tears!
A lady born and a lady always, d'ye see&mdash;up to her poor elbows
in soapsuds or on her weary knees scrubbing floors, there was
always about her a gentle dignity and graciousness...God's very
woman and angel of mercy to all in affliction. And she died...worn
out...for lack of what money can buy&mdash;so today she is in her
grave and I am rich! Ah, but any good that is in me, and there's
little enough, comes from her." Again the deep, solemn voice was
hushed and when Mr. Joliffe next spoke it was with look almost
apprehensive.</p>

<p>"And did she never mention...never refer to the Earl of
Wrybourne?"</p>

<p>"Not a word! She was too proud, God bless her. I knew she was
highly born and of course that she was a widow, but she never spoke
of her people and I never enquired...But now, sir, what more o'
this heritage? A while ago you said something about a
handle&mdash;a title, pray let's have it again, let's know exactly
who I am and what I possess&mdash;money and so on."</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Mr. Joliffe sat dumb, indeed he seemed
strangely ill at ease&mdash;he shifted in his chair, took off his
spectacles, wiped, put them on again and stared down at littered
desk, up at dingy ceiling, round upon book-lined
walls&mdash;anywhere but at his questioner; finally he coughed
again and, with gaze still averted, spoke:</p>

<p>"I fear what I have to say will prove somewhat of
a&mdash;hum&mdash;a shock to you."</p>

<p>"Oh well, sir," Sam replied, grim-smiling, "a man gets pretty
well used to shocks of all sorts at sea, 'specially aboard a
privateer, ay&mdash;and one commanded by such a daredevil as
Captain Edward Harlow&mdash;so out with it, sir."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Joliffe, taking up a quill pen and staring at
it, "I am...compelled to inform you that...this brave and gracious
lady who so wrought and slaved to your welfare, was...not your
mother."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;?" Sam leapt afoot, his tall form towering above the
lawyer almost threateningly, so that Mr. Joliffe leaned back in his
chair to gaze up into the contorted face above him with eyes of
understanding wherefore their gaze did not waver as he continued,
gently:</p>

<p>"Your mother, the Lady Monica Devine, an orphan and lady in her
own right, was a wealthy heiress who eloped from school and married
the Earl, your father, lived with him six months or thereabout, and
fled his brutality in fear of her life. She found harbourage with
her widowed cousin Ruth Felton in the village of Alciston, Sussex.
There you were born and there, shortly after, your mother, the
Countess of Wrybourne, died. Upon this sad event, Mrs. Felton, this
good and noble lady, adopted you, poor though she was, and brought
you up as her own child. Thus instead of Samuel Felton you are
Japhet Eustace Scrope, Earl of Wrybourne."</p>

<p>"And what," demanded Sam, deep-breathing, "what of my&mdash;real
mother's fortune?"</p>

<p>"Reverted naturally to her husband the noble Earl, your
father&mdash;every acre, every stick and stone, to the uttermost
farthing! Your mother would have been quite destitute but for her
cousin Mrs. Felton's generosity."</p>

<p>"Then," said Sam, in a harsh whisper, "may the Earl my father be
everlastingly damned! I grieve he is dead and beyond my reach."</p>

<p>"Indeed," sighed Mr. Joliffe, laying down the quill pen and
shaking his trim head at it, "some men are...much
better...dead!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but how," stammered Sam, hoarsely, "how am I...how
are you assured of...of all this?"</p>

<p>"Be pleased to sit down, my lord, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't call me&mdash;that!"</p>

<p>"But, my lord, I must, since indeed lord you are henceforth and
Earl of Wrybourne. Yes, my lord, as I said before, instead of
Samuel Felton, mariner, you are most truly, Japhet Scrope lord and
Earl of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Belay!" growled Sam. "Sounds a lot of tomfoolery to me."</p>

<p>"However, my lord, pray be seated, compose yourself and permit
me to explain fully as I may...Thus, then, when the late Earl, your
father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call him the Earl&mdash;and be cursed to his fatherhood!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord. When the Earl died, thirteen months
and&mdash;hum&mdash;five days since&mdash;by the way he was killed
by his horse, the animal threw him, breaking his neck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A cheer for the horse!" growled Sam.</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;ha!" murmured Mr. Joliffe, caressing smooth-shaven
chin. "The horse is, I believe, and has ever been regarded as a
highly intelligent animal! However, my lord the Earl being dead,
instant enquiry was made for his wife without result until I called
in the aid of a certain perspicacious Bow Street officer well
beknown to me, one Jasper Shrig, by whose efforts
your&mdash;hum&mdash;unfortunate mother was traced, evidence of
your birth established, and yourself&mdash;well&mdash;here you are,
my lord, thanks to the unfailing Shrig. You'll remember him, of
course."</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, "an odd, rum sort of customer&mdash;talked of
murderers and murder-ees."</p>

<p>"I'll warrant he did and of vindictiveness also...Now as to
proofs of identity, they are here for your
perusal&mdash;certificates of your parents' marriage and your
birth, by which it seems you are aged twenty-eight and seem, if I
may say so, much older than your years, by which I opine a seaman's
life is far other than a&mdash;hum&mdash;bed of roses?"</p>

<p>"More especially, sir, in time o' war," answered Sam, frowning
at the documents Mr. Joliffe had set before him. Having glanced
through these proofs of his identity and apparently limitless
wealth, Sam passed fingers through and through his thick, chestnut
hair until it stood on end, then sinking back in his chair, shook
his head in helpless manner, saying:</p>

<p>"Sir, I'm taken all aback...shivering in the wind's
eye...falling off and on like a rudderless ship, ay damme I
am!"</p>

<p>"It is, as I told you, a vast heritage, my lord!"</p>

<p>"Too vast!" groaned Sam. "And seems quite utterly preposterous!
I'm a sailorman and content so to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah but," quoth Mr. Joliffe, finger upraised portentously, "you
are also a great landowner with huge rent-roll from estates in
three several counties, hence your responsibilities are
correspondingly great, especially in regard to your tenantry."</p>

<p>"Lord love me!" groaned Sam.</p>

<p>"Amen!" murmured Mr. Joliffe, his eyes twinkling. "And thus,
m'lord, with your permission, I should like, indeed I will venture
to proffer a few&mdash;hum&mdash;suggestions, if I may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, pray do, heave ahead, sir, I shall be grateful."</p>

<p>"I thank you for the assurance, my lord."</p>

<p>"Well?" enquired Sam. But again Mr. Joliffe sat mute&mdash;for
the eyes of his questioner, wide-set, well-opened, black-lashed,
were unexpectedly shrewd, strangely compelling and lit up his
rugged features, softening their grimness so wonderfully that the
lawyer, this student of faces, could but gaze in surprised and
ever-growing interest, and once again, seemed vaguely
disquieted.</p>

<p>"You were going to make me some suggestions," Sam reminded
him.</p>

<p>"I was...I am...and yet&mdash;" Mr. Joliffe paused as if
deliberating pro and con...</p>

<p>"And yet?" Sam prompted. Mr. Joliffe resettled his spectacles,
and looking keenly into the bronzed, battle-scarred face before
him, read there so much of fearless truth and inherent honesty that
when next he spoke it was in warmer, more intimate tone and with a
certain grave anxiety:</p>

<p>"My lord, henceforth the world is yours, all the glory and all
the folly of it. You are become a master of life, a mighty power
for much good or great evil. This heritage of yours, this vast
wealth must and will make or mar you, prove you a man capable of
much or merest weakling able only to his own eventual destruction.
You are indeed a dangerously wealthy young man!"</p>

<p>"Dangerously?" murmured Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Mr. Joliffe, "and in more senses than one! Great
wealth is always a very mixed blessing, if blessing indeed it be,
and a lure to rogues and harpies of every sort."</p>

<p>"Ay, true enough!" nodded Sam. "I've run athwart 'em, men and
women in every port half round the world, so I've learned enough to
keep 'em in my lee, give 'em a wide berth, d'ye see&mdash;steer
clear of 'em, if you know what I mean, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah but," said Mr. Joliffe, leaning nearer, "there is an even
greater danger threatens you, closer...more insistent, a...cold and
deadly menace that, given opportunity, may strike unseen...swiftly
and without...mercy!" Now as he listened Sam was amazed to hear Mr.
Joliffe's voice sink to a hissing whisper, to see his brows knit
above fierce or anxious eyes while the hand that had grasped his
sleeve was shaking.</p>

<p>"Sir," questioned Sam, laying his own large, vital hand upon
these clutching fingers, "what is this menace?"</p>

<p>"Your paternal uncle, Lord Julian Scrope."</p>

<p>"Uncle, eh?" murmured Sam. "Never knew I had one, but since I
have&mdash;what about him?"</p>

<p>"He is your father's only brother and would have succeeded to
this great heritage but for you, my lord!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I see!" nodded Sam. "I suppose he wishes you'd never
discovered me&mdash;finds me damnably in his way?"</p>

<p>"Pre-cisely!" exclaimed Mr. Joliffe, with quick, sharp nod. "He
would yet succeed were you to die&mdash;suddenly!"</p>

<p>"Um!" mused Sam. "Then he might perhaps desire...my
removal&mdash;or...even consider the how of it, eh sir?" Mr.
Joliffe, resettling his glasses, did not speak, but his look was so
eloquent that Sam nodded in turn, saying:</p>

<p>"So! He's that sort of cove, is he?" Here ensued a brief silence
wherein Sam stared down at his shoe again while Mr. Joliffe,
fumbling in pocket of his embroidered satin waistcoat, drew thence
a gold snuff-box, tapped, opened and proffered it to Sam.</p>

<p>"Thankee, no, sir," he answered, "I take mine in a pipe."</p>

<p>"Then pray smoke if you will, my lord." But instead of so doing,
Sam leaned back and with those grey eyes of his now eloquent and
wistful, said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Joliffe, ever since I went seafaring to help that mother of
mine, for I shall always think of her as my real mother, I've spent
my life mostly aboard ship, whaling or fighting the mounseers, d'ye
see. So today I'm a stranger. In all this big London ay and England
too, I've no friend to trust or advise me except my old messmate
and Captain, Ned Harlow. Now if you, sir, could manage to feel
yourself friend enough to bear a hand with help and advice I should
be...well...mighty grateful. And if you can so contrive, then
please to let go all this 'my lordship' foolery, at least when
we're alone, and call me&mdash;just Sam. So now, sir, what's the
word?"</p>

<p>Mr. Joliffe snuffed with gusto, closed and fobbed his box,
dusted himself with snowy handkerchief and glancing
up&mdash;smiled.</p>

<p>"Sam," quoth he, in tone altered as his look, "I am a bachelor,
with few interests outside business and fewer cares, reasonably
selfish and fond of comfort as a cat! Today, in this last
half-hour, I am distinctly uncomfortable, have actually forgotten
myself and am in a state of extraordinary disquiet, not to say
perturbation, and all by reason of&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>"Why so, Mr. Joliffe?"</p>

<p>"Because though you are a belted Earl and peer of the realm, you
remain so essentially&mdash;just Sam!"</p>

<p>"Why d'ye see, I'm not a changeable kind of cove."</p>

<p>"Exactly! You remain the Sam who came into this stuffy office
like a fresh sea-breeze, and this heartened me. Then, instead of
gloating upon your sudden great good fortune, you gloomed, and this
surprised and won my interest. But your grief was because your
devoted mother could have no joy of it&mdash;and this touched me
sensibly! And now, Sam, knowing poor Humanity as I do, its shams
and hypocrisies, its crookedness and double-dealing, I prove you
so...so very much the reverse and opposite of all this...with the
best of your life before you, that I cannot bear to think you may
risk losing it unwarned by me. And I begin by advising you that
blind Fate, or devilish spiteful Fortune, has raised and armed two
enemies who must destroy you or&mdash;themselves go down to
irretrievable ruin!" Here Mr. Joliffe fumbled again for his
snuff-box.</p>

<p>"Lord!" murmured Sam. "Two of 'em? Sounds interesting."</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Mr. Joliffe, pinch of snuff suddenly arrested
within an inch of his nose, "did you say 'interesting'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I mean to say&mdash;two of 'em! I guess my uncle for
one but who's t'other?"</p>

<p>"His only son, your cousin Ralph."</p>

<p>"Oh?" enquired Sam. "Ah! What like is he?"</p>

<p>"About your own age and size, but a regular Buck, a dashing
Corinthian and perfect terror by all accounts."</p>

<p>"How a terror, sir?"</p>

<p>"He is esteemed a fistic expert."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Sam, his eye brightening. "You mean a fibber, a
bruiser, a fancy article, eh sir?"</p>

<p>"Just so. I am informed by Shrig how the Honourable Ralph is
famous, or infamous, as a two-fisted smasher through all the
countryside."</p>

<p>"Which countryside, sir?"</p>

<p>"Sussex. He is a quarrelsome hothead to be avoided, and
especially by you, Sam!"</p>

<p>"Ay but d'ye see, I've also done a trifle of fibbing afloat and
ashore and if so be we chance to meet and he feel
inclined&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Mr. Joliffe so vehemently that his pinch of
snuff was scattered broadcast. "You must not meet and
certainly&mdash;oh, certainly not be drawn into quarrel! No, this
would be their opening...give them their chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For what, sir?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Sam, and draw your own conclusions...I know your uncle,
my lord Julian, only too well, having been compelled to deal with
him in business. We Joliffes have been lawyers and agents to the
Scrope family for generations. Thus I have known Lord Julian all
his life and understand him as few possibly can&mdash;and the more
I have learned of his inner self the more appalled have I been!
For, Sam, I do assure you he is beyond Nature, an anomaly,
a&mdash;creature without a conscience&mdash;absolutely!"</p>

<p>"He sounds pretty inhuman!" murmured Sam.</p>

<p>"Listen and be warned! Lord Julian is a law unto himself,
beneath handsome person and courtly manners he masks a beast of
insatiate appetites and a boundless will&mdash;and with none of
those moral restraints imposed by civilization! Highly esteemed in
Society and privileged courtier, he is famous as a sportsman, known
for reckless gambler, heartless libertine, unerring pistol-shot and
notorious duellist with two deaths to his account already!"</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam again. "Lord love me!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Mr. Joliffe, with fervour. "So, this is the man who
confidently expected and would have inherited this great fortune
but for you, Sam, but for you! And I know how very desperately he
is circumstanced, how deep he is in the clutches of the
money-lenders&mdash;without this heritage he is ruined beyond
redemption, he and his son! So now you are warned, Sam, are you
warned?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am indeed! And pray know me vastly grateful, friend."</p>

<p>"Then you will take all due, all needful precautions?"</p>

<p>"That will I. Now, pray, sir, what does he know, what has he
heard of me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing beyond the fact of your being the legal heir and lately
from abroad."</p>

<p>"Does he know I'm a seaman?"</p>

<p>"He does not! And shall learn nothing more of you&mdash;at least
from me."</p>

<p>"Good! Then should I venture athwart his hawse it shall be under
false colours, braces manned to bear up and go about, ay and with
guns run out and double-shotted."</p>

<p>"All of which means precisely what, Sam?"</p>

<p>"That should we chance to meet, he shall not know who I am, yet
should he suspect my true identity I'll duck and dodge but be ready
to give more than I take. Besides I shan't be quite alone, for d'ye
see I'm due to meet my Captain and friend, Ned Harlow, three days
hence at the White Hart in Lewes. And, Mr. Joliffe, blow foul or
fair there's none like Ned!"</p>

<p>"You esteem him very highly?"</p>

<p>"Sir, he's my friend! Ay and saved my life besides, and what's
more a finer seaman never trod plank and a fighting captain few can
match! To see him take his ship into action is pure joy for d'ye
see he follows Nelson's own maxim 'engage the enemy more closely.'
It's keep the weather-gauge and board and Ned himself generally
first on the enemy's deck. Sixteen prizes we took on our last
cruise, for says he to me as we laid the <i>Intrepide</i> frigate
aboard, 'It shall be competence for life, shipmate, or Davy
Jones'."</p>

<p>"A regular fire-eater, eh, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir. Yet mild-spoken and meek-seeming as the most parson-y
parson! Seldom put out, never swears&mdash;much, never at a loss
and choke-ful o' book-learning. Shakespeare, poetry, the classics,
Homer, Virgil, Horace, and reads 'em in the original
too&mdash;learned himself Greek and Latin to do it."</p>

<p>"Your captain is truly an original, Sam."</p>

<p>"Ay b'George, sir, that's the word!"</p>

<p>"Consequently, Sam, I'm relieved and glad to know you will be
companied by such a man, especially as it seems you intend for
Sussex."</p>

<p>"Why oddly enough, sir, this was Ned's idea, he has friends
living there and, 'twixt you and me, I'm sadly afraid he means to
live there too, being so flush o' prize-money he talks of buying a
farm which, seeing he's such prime sailor-man is great pity."</p>

<p>"Howbeit, Sam, for reasons aforementioned Sussex holds danger
for you. Wherefore I shall take such measures for your protection
as I deem proper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord, sir! I do hope you won't."</p>

<p>"I know, Sam, I know. But then I am also aware and too
uncomfortably certain of the malign cunning and utter ruthlessness
of the evils opposing us. And I say 'us' because to more or less
degree I intend sharing these perils."</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;it's very handsome of you, but&mdash;why should
you?"</p>

<p>"Sam, look around you, these musty tomes, this stuffy office and
myself like a human spider spinning webs to catch malevolent
villainy...pitting my wits against their devilish cunning and
usually, I am glad to say, with the happiest results. Here I work
plotting their destruction, unknown, unheard, unseen...But
sometimes if the case is sufficiently remarkable, I take occasion
to witness the criminal's arrest and&mdash;hum&mdash;final
exodus."</p>

<p>"Exodus? You mean&mdash;by hanging?"</p>

<p>"I do. Precisely! I have witnessed the execution of several
cold-blooded scoundrels with my natural horror tempered by a very
lively satisfaction, knowing the world a cleaner, better place for
their removal. You have never seen a hanging?"</p>

<p>"No! I've seen too many hearty fellows die by steel or bullet
but never by rope and hope I never shall."</p>

<p>"Indeed 'tis a sordid, a dreadful yet, I fear, most necessary
business, not as a deterrent but to be rid of social evil."</p>

<p>"Yet evil persists, sir."</p>

<p>"Alas&mdash;and always must, Sam, until the curse of Cain is
lifted, ignorance banished and Humanity turns to and seeks for the
hidden good rather than the too blatant evil."</p>

<p>"Ay, but when shall this be, sir?"</p>

<p>"When Mankind has grown wiser by suffering. There are only two
ways in life's journey, Sam, up or down, the right or wrong, and we
are free to choose, more or less, and this alone lifts us above the
brutes whose only guide is instinct. Talking of evil naturally
brings me back to your uncle, Lord Julian. And I now take occasion
to assure you, strictly betwixt ourselves, that I am setting in
motion such latent forces as shall render him powerless to harm
you&mdash;or anyone else! But this will need time, six months or
more. So I must ask you to be patient and make no effort to assume
your title and lofty rank in Society until you may do so with
perfect safety. Meanwhile, of course, you are at liberty to draw
what monies you require, to buy any properties you fancy or sell
such of your own as you will. Only, and again, I beg you to have
patience."</p>

<p>"That will I, sir. For, d'ye see, I've no mind to this title,
and as for Society, why damme, sir, I should be like fish out o'
water, ay helpless as hulk in a driftway."</p>

<p>"Ah, but," chuckled Mr. Joliffe, "you will be one of the
wealthiest bachelors in England and able to choose the proudest
beauty in town or out! Mothers with marriageable daughters will
haunt you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord love me!" groaned Sam. "I'd liefer turn farmer along o'
Ned."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me&mdash;where in Sussex do you and your captain
propose to stay?"</p>

<p>"With friends of his, I understand, though where, I've no
idea."</p>

<p>"The chiefest of your many estates, Wrybourne Feveril, is in
Sussex, Sam, and 'tis but natural you should wish to see the glory
of it, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay ay, sir, I'll be wary, trust me."</p>

<p>"Are you lodged here in town?"</p>

<p>"At the Turk's Head on Snow Hill, sir."</p>

<p>"Sam if, as I hope, we are to be friends, pray know that my name
is Ebeneezer&mdash;'Ben' to my intimates&mdash;and that I have a
house amid trees in Streatham village where I shall be happy to
entertain you so long as you will. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Ben."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Mr. Joliffe, consulting his watch. "In five minutes
my carriage will be at the door, we'll drive to Snow Hill for your
baggage, then home, and on the way I will give you more particulars
of your blue-blooded, extremely arrogant, most discreditable
family."</p>

<p>It was as they descended the outer steps towards Mr. Joliffe's
waiting carriage that Sam was aware of one who chanced to pass by,
and this such a very commonplace, ordinary seeming person, indeed
so entirely unremarkable that Sam would never have noticed him had
not their eyes happened to meet&mdash;a swift, casual glance
instantly forgotten as Sam took his seat in the carriage. But no
sooner had the vehicle rolled away than this unremarkable person
did an odd, not to say remarkable thing&mdash;halting suddenly, he
took out a small pocket memorandum wherein he scribbled hastily,
whispering as he did so:</p>

<p>"Six foot tall, or thereabout. Aged about thirty. Tough and
determined-looking. Tanned complexion. Scar on left side of brow.
So&mdash;there y'are m'lud Earl, but&mdash;for how long? I wonder."
Then pocketing his notebook, this so ordinary person set off at no
ordinary speed.</p>

<h3><a name="ch102" id="ch102"></a>CHAPTER II. GIVETH BRIEF
DESCRIPTION OF A NEW EARL</h3>

<p>Japhet Eustace Scrope, fifth Earl of Wrybourne, set forth on his
travels not in pride of state with gleaming coach, footmen and
outriders like the aristocrat Fortune had determined he should be,
but as the man he was, that is to say, with no pageantry of hoofs,
wheels and servants attendant, but alone and upon his own sturdy
legs. Moreover, as if to defy Fortune's so compelling decree, he
had rigged his muscular person in most sailorly fashion. Thus upon
his thick newly-cropped hair a glazed hat was cocked at
devil-may-care angle, about brawny throat was a blue neckerchief
brightly patterned with large, yellow anchors, its loose ends
fluttering gaily; round his lithe middle a broad belt with vast,
gleaming buckle, supported nether garments of dashing, nautical
cut; in one powerful hand he grasped a knotted, bludgeon-like
stick, in the other a trim bundle tied neatly in large, spotted
handkerchief of the kind made notable by that great fistic champion
Jem Belcher. Thus equipped, vigorous of movement, cheery of visage,
alert for instant action and ready to engage all comers as the Navy
itself, this new Earl of Wrybourne strode on to front grim Destiny
and perilous Circumstance like the English sailorman he was.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch103" id="ch103"></a>CHAPTER III. CONCERNING CAPTAIN
EDWARD HARLOW, WEDLOCK AND A WIDOW</h3>

<p>In pleasant chamber of the White Hart Inn overlooking the busy
street sat Captain Edward Harlow. Richly though sombrely clad, he
seemed more like studious landsman than the hardy captain of a
battle-scarred privateering vessel whose many daring exploits had
won renown in the narrow seas and beyond&mdash;for Captain Ned's
comely head was bent over an open book, his clean-shaven, shapely
lips forming soundlessly the noble lines he was reading.</p>

<p>It was thus Sam found him as pausing upon the threshold, he
enquired:</p>

<p>"What is it this time, Ned, Virgil or Horace?"</p>

<p>"Neither, shipmate. Shut the door, sit down, listen and tell
me."</p>

<p>And forthwith he read aloud:</p>

<blockquote>"'This royal throne of kings, this sceptr'd isle,<br>
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,<br>
This other Eden, demi-paradise;<br>
This fortress built by Nature for herself&mdash;<br>
Against infection and the hand of war:<br>
This happy breed of men, this little world;<br>
This precious stone set in the silver sea<br>
Which serves it in the office of a wall,<br>
Or as a moat defensive to a house,<br>
Against the envy of less happier lands;<br>
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm&mdash;<br>
&mdash;This England.'"</blockquote>

<p>"Shakespeare, an't it, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;who else could frame our England in words so apt and
deathless true? Ha, Sam, the oftener and further I voyage, the
happier and prouder am I of this right blessed old island!"</p>

<p>"So am I, Ned, but it goes without saying&mdash;for I've no
words for it."</p>

<p>"However you've bled for it, Sam, and that's far better...But
what luck with your lawyers?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Ned, I don't know! For it seems I'm confoundedly
rich, ay, money enough to build and fit a ship o' my own&mdash;a
fleet! Ha, but, along with all this wealth I've relatives who are,
or will be, after my blood! For d'ye see, messmate, but for me they
would have come in for this heritage and without it they're in
shoal water with rocks alee and certain to founder."</p>

<p>Captain Ned closed his battered volume on a finger and leaning
back regarded Sam with a pair of the mildest-seeming blue eyes
which widened beneath lifting brows as they took in the various
items of his companion's attire.</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;Sam," he exclaimed, "why this too-nautical rig?
Scupper me, if you don't show like the Navies, Royal and Merchant,
all rolled into one!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I do, Ned, I do indeed! Nobody could possibly mistake me
for anything but a slap-up sailorman, a regular Jack-ashore."</p>

<p>"Only a jack afloat&mdash;he'd certainly damn you as too
sailorly to be true!"</p>

<p>"Ah but," quoth Sam, tossing the glazed hat upon the nearest
chair, "I'm rigged for the eye of shore-biding
folk&mdash;especially two! No landsman spying yon hat and this
neckerchief only could possibly mistake me for a blue-blooded
aristocrat, eh Ned?"</p>

<p>The Captain closed his book, laid it aside and looked Sam over
with closer regard.</p>

<p>"Shipmate," said he, "I've never known that tough figurehead of
yours affected by liquor or sun, and yet now
I'm...wondering&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Same here, Ned! It all sounds too curst ridiculous for
belief&mdash;so let's cut it adrift&mdash;tell me instead, when
does your widow clap you aboard and grapple you in wedlock for
better or worse, my poor, old lad&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>Captain Ned winced, his athletic form appeared to wilt and he
uttered sound like a stifled groan ere he answered:</p>

<p>"Sam, I...don't know. I...I haven't seen her&mdash;yet!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Sam. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I waited for you to...to stand by and bear a hand as messmate
should."</p>

<p>"Well, here I am, Ned, ready and willing to do all I may. Though
women are craft I steer clear of as you know&mdash;ever since that
French mamselle so very nearly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All I want is your advice, Sam. For here am I with hard Duty
hauling me one way and...tender inclination the other. For though
pledged to the widow I'm...well...yearning to be free."</p>

<p>"And rightly so, Ned, for this means you're clean out of love
with her. Agreed?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that is so!" groaned the Captain. "But then&mdash;she has
my word."</p>

<p>"However, since you're not in love this alters the case, for
without love d'ye see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, but I am in love, Sam, deeply! Heart and soul!"</p>

<p>"Why then this alters the case back again, though you're
steering a plaguey erratic course, Ned. Still, if you're in so
deep, why not marry your widow and be done with it?"</p>

<p>"Because...Sam...messmate, I...love another!"</p>

<p>"Not another widow, Ned?"</p>

<p>"No, damme!" groaned the Captain. "Never again! No more widows
for me!"</p>

<p>"Well then, don't marry this widow."</p>

<p>"Ah, but Sam, duty compels!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Sam. "Ah? Then the widow it must be after
all&mdash;I suppose. Though lookee, Ned, wedlock without love is
all lock! Ay and consequently means breakers in your lee and a foul
anchorage. Love, d'ye see, Ned, is wedlock's sheet anchor, that
gone, marriage is wrecked soon or late."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sam, that is what dreads me! And yet she has waited years
for me to make enough money, and now that I have...well...how can I
go about, sheer off and leave her desolate, how?"</p>

<p>"Sounds a foulish course, Ned. But what of the one not a widow?
Does she wait too&mdash;and know you love her?"</p>

<p>"I...yes...I fancy she guessed it, for I never dared tell her.
No, indeed, I've kept a fairish offing for fear I might
speak&mdash;and myself no free man! So there's the case,
Sam&mdash;what is your counsel?"</p>

<p>"'Tis plaguey awkward situation, Ned."</p>

<p>"It confounds me, Sam. This is why I ask your
advice&mdash;seeing you are my mate and friend of years besides. So
out with it."</p>

<p>"Well first, is your widow mercenary?"</p>

<p>"N-no, I should say 'prudent'."</p>

<p>"Does she love you deeply, heart and soul?"</p>

<p>"Y-es, I...suppose so."</p>

<p>"Can't you be sure and certain, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, Sam. She is not...not a very...demonstrative
person."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Sam, pondering deeply. "Ah!"</p>

<p>"Well, shipmate, what's the word?"</p>

<p>"Cut her adrift, Ned, your widow and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible! Not to be thought on! For as I told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, duty compels, I know! But Ned, such duty will surely
compel the three of you to misery all your days&mdash;it will so!
Your properest course is to be now as desperate bold ashore as you
are afloat. Up now and bear away for the widow, speak her fair,
gently though firm. If she rages, comfort her with cash. If she
weeps console her with more. Come now, tacks and sheets, let's
stand away at once."</p>

<p>So, together they rose, took hats and sticks and together
descended to the street where all was stir and bustle for it was
market-day; nor had they far to go, for presently the Captain
halted before a small, neat dwelling.</p>

<p>"Sam," said he, dabbing moist brow with dainty handkerchief,
"you'll remember that night we boarded and cut out the
<i>Serapis</i> under the batteries at Brest?"</p>

<p>"Shall I ever forget it, Ned! B'gad 'twas touch and go with
us!"</p>

<p>"It was, messmate&mdash;yet I never felt then as I do now. Look
at me&mdash;damme, I'm all of a quake!"</p>

<p>"Well, to it, Ned, to it! Cutlasses out and boarders away!"</p>

<p>"You'll keep an offing but stand by, Sam."</p>

<p>"Ay, I'll bear away for a sight o' the castle yonder, you'll
find me thereabout. Now 'bold' is the word and good luck, old
fellow!"</p>

<p>"Well, here's for it!" So saying, Captain Ned breathed deep,
squared his shoulders and striding forward knocked upon the door of
this small, neat house.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch104" id="ch104"></a>CHAPTER IV. OF NOTHING IN
PARTICULAR</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Sam stood gazing up at this Castle of Lewes, stately
in its ruin, massive gateway, scowling battlement and mighty keep,
this hoary monument of an age remote and well-nigh forgotten, its
lofty walls rising up and up in rugged grandeur against an azure
sky; this part of old England whose very stones might be so
eloquent for those blessed with ears to hear, crying out of battle,
siege and storm, of cheers for victory, of the cries and groans of
martyrs amid the vicious crackle of searing flame&mdash;and of a
virile nation's upward struggle through blood and suffering and
anguished tears, to that freedom which is England's glory and makes
its hallowed earth the secure haven for all those fleeing from
tyranny and oppression:</p>

<blockquote>"This fortress built by Nature for defence<br>
Against invasion and the ills of war:<br>
This mighty isle set in the silver sea<br>
To fling back foes and shelter all distressed."</blockquote>

<p>Sam was thus misquoting, and such were his thoughts when he
became aware of one beside him, a person, this, so ordinary and
altogether unremarkable that Sam merely glanced towards him, then
gave all his attention to the old castle again, until a perfectly
expressionless voice remarked:</p>

<p>"A noble spectacle, friend!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" answered Sam, carelessly, but meeting the glance of
the speaker's small, colourless eyes, he set the glazed hat to
lower more jaunty angle over his scarred brow, with light tap on
the crown.</p>

<p>"You are a mariner, I see."</p>

<p>"You were blind else, my hearty."</p>

<p>"Yet greatly interested in ancient ruins!"</p>

<p>"Why lookee, I'm wondering how yon old place 'ud look arter say
a couple o' broadsides from a seventy-four."</p>

<p>"Ah, you have served in a battleship, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Off an' on, sir. But gimme the little craft for action."</p>

<p>"I see. And you are but new-landed, I fancy?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, that's me! And loaded to the hatches wi' rhino, my
hearty!" Here Sam winked, slapped his pockets and made a sudden
gesture with his sailorly legs like the beginning of a
hornpipe.</p>

<p>"So now you are on your way home, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Mate, you suppose true! Foller in my wake, ay, keep astarn o'
me and you shall see sich welcome for jolly jack as'll warm the
very cockles o' y'r 'eart."</p>

<p>"Is your home far from here?"</p>

<p>"Depends on what you'd call far."</p>

<p>"Is it a mile?"</p>

<p>"Ay and more."</p>

<p>"Where then?"</p>

<p>"D'ye know Brighthelmstone?"</p>

<p>"I've heard of it."</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't theer."</p>

<p>"Eh, not?"</p>

<p>"No, my home lays 'twixt and 'tween here and theer&mdash;" At
this moment came a familiar hail:</p>

<p>"Ahoy, Sam!"</p>

<p>"Snoggers!" he exclaimed. "Sink and burn me if theer ain't my
Cap'n!" Saying which, Sam turned hastily and left the man in the
shadow of this great castle showing the more insignificant by
contrast...But the Captain's step was light, his blue eyes shone,
and he flourished his stick triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Sam, oh Sam," he exclaimed joyfully, "Lord be thanked&mdash;she
refused me, d'ye hear, refused me! And what d'you say to that?"</p>

<p>"Congratulations! And what now?"</p>

<p>"A bottle, Sam, a bottle! And of the best, for this is an
occasion! It seems she couldn't wait any longer and so, ha,
messmate&mdash;the day after tomorrow she's being married to a town
barber-surgeon and I&mdash;shake hands, Sam, I'm free! So a bottle
it is and then we'll bear away together for&mdash;never mind, but
we will! And this night, Sam, you shall eat of the best, and sleep
'twixt sheets white as lilies and sweet with lavender! Ah, you
shall taste such cookery and see such beauty as bless this old
world too seldom."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch105" id="ch105"></a>CHAPTER V. OF ARGUMENT BY THE
WAY, WHICH ENDS WITH A SCREAM</h3>

<p>The white road winding upwards between shady hedge-rows, led
round a sharp corner to show them suddenly a wide, fair prospect of
richly green, undulating country stretching away, lush meadow,
glittering stream, darkling coppice and bowery hamlet, away to a
line of noble hills rising afar in gentle majesty.</p>

<p>Here Captain Ned, who had walked some while in musing silence,
paused to feast his sight and say:</p>

<p>"Ha, Sam, here is Will Shakespeare's 'demi-paradise.' Ay, 'this
land of such dear souls, this dear, dear land, dear for her
reputation through the world!' And all unchanged since his day,
thank God! 'Let us be backed by God and with the seas...in them and
in ourselves our safety lies...England is safe if true within
herself.' Ah, Will knew and said it all, eh, Sam?" Finding him
silent, the Captain turned to see his companion's sombre gaze was
backward towards Lewes town already vague with distance.</p>

<p>"Messmate," he demanded, "why must you peer astern of us so
often?"</p>

<p>"Spies, Ned&mdash;one at least. Ay, they're after me already it
seems."</p>

<p>"Eh? What? Who are?"</p>

<p>"My relations, I fancy. This bloody-minded nunks o' mine...this
accursed heritage!"</p>

<p>"How, Sam, then was that dog-watch yarn you spun me of a fortune
left you&mdash;was it true fact?"</p>

<p>"Ay, true as death, Ned! So today I'm being dogged and spied on,
or so I think. For, d'ye see yonder by the old castle a strange
fellow brings to alongside and tries to pump me, but got only
foolery for his pains, because, Ned, I'd glimpsed this same fellow
in London by the lawyer's office...and now I'm wondering if he's
away to warn my relations how I'm on the road to 'em."</p>

<p>"What like is he?"</p>

<p>"B'gad, Ned, it's hard to say, for he's so exactly like
everybody else that he may be anybody, nobody, or somebody more
than he seems&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Easy, shipmate, easy!" quoth the Captain, in frowning
perplexity; Sam chuckled.</p>

<p>"I mean," he explained with white-toothed grin, "this
insignificant, ordinary-seeming fellow may be one to reckon with,
so I'm keeping my weather-eye lifting for squalls."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Captain Ned, also glancing back whence they had come.
"You think he is standing after us, a stern-chase, hey?"</p>

<p>"However, there's no sign of him, so let's carry on. Tell me
now," said Sam as they went on down the hill, "are you still
minded, quite determined to...quit the sea, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am indeed. I mean to try my hand at farming&mdash;in a
snug, comfortable way...a farmstead, not too small, bowered in
trees, in a garden not too large with a row of beehives, and a few
acres with cows, say eight, an orchard and a paddock with an
easy-going nag to jog around on...in a word, Sam, Home, ay, with a
capital aitch! A quiet anchorage at last, a peaceful haven...to
pass the rest of my days."</p>

<p>"How so, Ned? D'you mean in sowing and mowing&mdash;hayricks and
so on, eh?"</p>

<p>"Naturally! Then besides I shall always have my books."</p>

<p>"And beehives, Ned."</p>

<p>"Why yes, so I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And cows, Ned."</p>

<p>"Ay, I mentioned 'em, too."</p>

<p>"And a nag&mdash;but what beside, messmate? An't you leaving out
the one most important and necessary item?"</p>

<p>"Eh, what tack are you off on now, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Woman, Ned! A wife! I've heard no home is complete without one.
Though I've heard also that when woman comes in at door, peace
flies out up the chimney. And for my part I'm pretty sure 'tis only
too dam' true."</p>

<p>"You would, Sam, being such confirmed, ay, and confounded,
woman-hater."</p>

<p>"Not woman-hater, Ned, merely a female evader, plying well to
windward o' their feminine bewitchments."</p>

<p>"Yet what of that Spanish dame in Rio who knifed you?"</p>

<p>"All quite natural, Ned, for d'ye see a don was throttling her,
I floored him and she knifed me because he happened to be her
newest husband, which was only to be expected, she being a
woman&mdash;and dago besides."</p>

<p>"Some day, Sam, you'll meet a real woman&mdash;I hope!" After
this, they went in silence, Sam trudging heavily, head bowed in
frowning thought, Captain Ned striding blithely, shoulders squared,
blue eyes fixed yearningly on the distance before them until:</p>

<p>"Listen!" said he, suddenly. "Hear the song of that lark and be
glad you're alive&mdash;and in England!"</p>

<p>"Ay, but," growled Sam, hardly troubling to lift his frowning
gaze, "yon's only a bird! Yet away there is ocean calling...calling
day and night: 'Oh sons o' mine, come ye, dare me&mdash;trust me
and I'll give ye life and maybe death. Ah, but while ye breathe, no
living may compare with the joys and dangers of me, the glad
freedom of my rushing winds, the hiss and surge of my
ever-restless, hungry billows! So come ye mariners of England that
are my children all, dare me, trust me as ye have done through the
ages!' Can't you hear it, Ned, don't you hear?"</p>

<p>"Sam," exclaimed the Captain, halting suddenly to stare his
amazement, "now God bless my soul! What's this you're quoting?"</p>

<p>"My thoughts, Ned, put into words this time because I'm
troubled&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've been reading poetry, Sam."</p>

<p>"Not I. Can't abide the stuff."</p>

<p>"Yet you were talking it, or very nearly."</p>

<p>"No, what I said had never a jingle or rhyme."</p>

<p>"There is such thing as blank verse, Sam. So keep a bright
look-out or you'll be turning poet or some such."</p>

<p>"However," answered Sam, shaking his head, "what I said was for
my grief, ay, and Old England's too, that we must lose prime
sailor, such ship-master and leader o' men as yourself, Ned. I've
seen you in tempest and battle, how our lads would jump, instant t'
your command or follow the gleam o' your cutlass no matter the
odds, follow you to victory, ay, and death often enough, just
because you were&mdash;you! And now...that you should turn farmer!
You of all men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell and damnation!" exclaimed the Captain, his usual placidity
ruffled at last. "Why the devil shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Because you are yourself, Ned, while yonder at sea lie Old
England's foes waiting and watching their chance to foul this
island, dammem! Ha, and Nelson dead and Buonaparte across the
Channel, back in triumph and making ready to spring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let him, the sooner the better. For:</p>

<blockquote>"'Come the three corners of the world in arms<br>
And we shall shock them. Naught can make us rue<br>
If England to itself do rest but true.'</blockquote>

<p>"So says our Will. And true she will be, says I. And as for me,
like you I've shed my blood and will again if need be...But
today...I'm nigh forty years old and have sailed the seas since a
lad. I've roughed it afloat and ashore doing my duty how best I
may, and so will I ever."</p>

<p>"This I know, messmate, this I surely know."</p>

<p>"Why then I have as surely earned a right to peace at last, home
and maybe a...a happiness I scarce dare think on. However, if
England must be fought for, I'll do it on English soil.
Ha&mdash;and there it is!"</p>

<p>"What?" enquired Sam, in startled accents. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Yonder, Sam, behind those trees to starboard&mdash;the Old Dun
Cow which suggesting milk shall supply something stronger. How say
you, shipmate?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Captain, with all my heart!" But as they approached
this quiet, tree-shaded inn, from somewhere nearby rose a sudden,
gasping scream.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch106" id="ch106"></a>CHAPTER VI. OF
FISTS&mdash;AND&mdash;THE BLACK-HAIRED, GOLDEN-EYED ANDROMEDA</h3>

<p>"Eh&mdash;a woman?" quoth Sam, glancing about.</p>

<p>"Ay. The inn-yard, I fancy."</p>

<p>So thither went they and beheld&mdash;a rough-clad man on hands
and knees, dripping blood from battered nose, two young dandies who
laughed, and a woman struggling vainly in the arms of a third, a
tall, powerful young fellow whose dashing air and foppish attire
from buckled hat to be-tasselled hessian boots, proclaimed him, in
sporting parlance, for a "bang-up tippy," a "go" and regular
"buck"; the woman, whose shabby, rumpled garments betrayed too much
of her young shapeliness, was silent now, striving desperately
against the large, white hands that became ever more aggressive and
masterful until&mdash;the jaunty hat was whisked from his
astonished head and he became suddenly aware of painfully intrusive
fingers that twisting themselves in his ornate cravat, wrenched and
twisted, drawing him irresistibly towards a bronzed, lowering face
lit by grey eyes fiercely wide.</p>

<p>"S-so, my buck?" hissed Sam, and flung him away so violently
that he reeled backwards and would have fallen but for the wall
that checked and propped him. At this so sudden and unexpected
assault ensued a moment of amazed silence; then with encouraging
shout, forward strode the two dandies, one of whom flourished a
modish cane, which slim elegance was instantly beaten to earth by
Captain Ned's bludgeon-like stick.</p>

<p>"Sirs," quoth he pleasantly, glancing from one to other, "fair
play if you please, or I shall be happy to engage you singly or
together. And, messmate, if you must, do not hit too hard!"</p>

<p>Sam, about to reply, closed lips firmly instead, for the Buck,
square chin tucked well in, powerful fists up, was advancing
against him, poised gracefully on toes of his gleaming hessians,
and with all the easy assurance of a finished boxer.</p>

<p>So they fronted each other, eye to eye, gallant Buck all
arrogant confidence by reason of past victories in academy and
ring&mdash;and rugged sailorman, lithe, grim, and hardened by
exposure, who had fought many a time and not for glory but life
itself.</p>

<p>The Buck feinted gracefully, leapt nimbly and smote viciously;
the sailor ducked as nimbly, countered heavily, was away and in
again with hard-driving left. So the battle was joined. And now for
some while there followed such dexterous foot and fist-work seldom
witnessed; grace of powerful bodies in swift, lithe action that as
time passed became only the more furiously purposeful...The Buck, a
gay and joyous fighter, sailed in, both fists going with more or
less effect; the sailor using powerful left, stung and checked him,
yet watching for chance to use his ever-menacing right, meeting
determined attack with light though punishing defence.</p>

<p>Thus as time passed the Buck grew more cautious, the Sailor more
aggressive; both now were bleeding, both seemed tiring, especially
the Sailor whose feet seemed heavier and blows less accurate, so
that it became a matter of skill backed now by sheer strength, grim
fortitude and experience.</p>

<p>The two dandies, both lovers of the Game, had been first
thralled beyond speech, then plaintively anxious, were now jubilant
and vociferous:</p>

<p>"Go it, old fellow," cried Number One, "you've got him! Ha
demme, what su-perb fibbing, eh, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Mag-nificent!" gasped Number Two. "'Pon honour...never saw th'
equal...no, not even Jackson himself! Ha, Ralph...he's groggy!
Level him! Measure him for a finisher!" So they encouraged their
champion while Captain Ned, keenly watchful, poised himself for
swift action, waiting for the expected moment which came with
dramatic suddenness&mdash;stamp of foot, thudding impact of
unerring right fist...the Buck's head jerked violently up and
back...Then Captain Ned leapt, caught the falling body and lowered
it gently to earth; the gleaming hessians kicked feebly once or
twice and were still, and for a moment none seemed to move or
breathe; then:</p>

<p>"Sam," quoth the Captain, chidingly, "why must you hit so hard?
Had I not caught him he would certainly, ha' cracked his skull on
the cobbles. You always use needless force!"</p>

<p>"Ay...I do," panted Sam meekly, as he wiped blood from his torn
cheek. "Always...forget my...strength, damme! How is he, Ned?"</p>

<p>"He requires a good souse of water," replied the Captain. "Come,
sirs," said he, beckoning the two apparently stupefied fine
gentlemen, "stir yourselves and carry your friend
indoors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why so we will," cried Number One, "ha but, by God, sir, if he
is anyway seriously hurt you shall hear of it, I promise you! You
shall be hounded to prison, the pair of you, by George! For let me
tell you his father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, Bob, he's coming to! See, he's stirring! How are
y'now, Ralph, m'dear fellow? Can y' walk? Help me with him, Bob,
can't you?" So together they lifted their feebly-moving hero and
half led, half carried him into the house.</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam, looking after them, "I believe I've
floored one o' the family!"</p>

<p>"Eh, what family?"</p>

<p>"A...most discreditable one. However, he's a pretty tidy
article&mdash;nearly levelled me twice!"</p>

<p>"So I noticed. And he cut your face."</p>

<p>"Ay, he wears a ring on his left like a knuckle-duster,
consequently I'm sore, he got in one or two ribroasters. Wherefore,
Ned, my present need is ale and&mdash;" He paused and turned at
sound of hoofs and wheels and thus beheld a plump, sleek-coated
pony harnessed to a weather-beaten, four-wheeled cart wherein sat,
or was enthroned&mdash;The Woman.</p>

<p>Her gloveless hands grasped the reins, her small, close bonnet,
weather-beaten almost as the cart, shaded a face shadowed already
by a vague sadness, such face as drew and held Sam's gaze and the
Captain's, too,&mdash;oval, sunburned, framed in hair black as
midnight lit by strange, golden eyes beneath low-arching brows; and
when she spoke it was in voice matching the tender beauty of the
lips that uttered these words:</p>

<p>"Sir, I hope he did not hurt you very much...and I'm trying
to...find words to thank you properly...as I would. But oh, I'm
glad, very glad you hit him so nice and hard...that brutish
satyr."</p>

<p>"Lady," murmured Sam, looking up into these strange, golden
eyes, "I...it was a pleasure!" At this she smiled, though very
wistfully, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, please know that I am truly...deeply grateful!"</p>

<p>"Please...one moment," pleaded Sam, as she made to drive away,
"do you chance to know the name of yon...fine gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he is well known, quite notorious hereabouts, his name
is&mdash;Scrope, the Honourable Ralph Scrope...yes, that beast is
called 'honourable.' And he hurt poor John Dobbs, John is the
ostler here who sometimes looks after our pony Joshua, this is
Joshua. John did his best to defend me but that beast was too
strong for him. I've been bathing his poor, bruised face&mdash;I
mean John's, of course. And now I'll thank you again and
go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"First," said Sam, a little awkwardly, "may I know...will
you...favour me with your name?"</p>

<p>"Why y-es," she answered almost unwillingly, "though I expect
you, a sailor, will think it quite ridiculous, but I was christened
Andromeda...Good-bye!" Then poking Joshua with the whip she drove
out and away.</p>

<p>"An-dromeda!" murmured Sam, gazing after her.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Captain, gazing at Sam, "and your phiz might show
a trifle less grim if you washed away the gore, Sam&mdash;though I
ought to call you Perseus now."</p>

<p>"Oh?" enquired Sam, "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, according to the Classics, he also saved his Andromeda
from a monster."</p>

<p>"Ah?" murmured Sam, "let's hear."</p>

<p>"Not 'til you are washed and I have been close engaged with a
tankard, shipmate."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch107" id="ch107"></a>CHAPTER VII. INTRODUCES AN
ODDITY</h3>

<p>The afternoon was hot and airless, the road dusty, but Captain
Ned held on at the same brisk, seemingly tireless pace, his blue
gaze ever upon the distance ahead until at last, Sam, removing the
glazed hat to wipe perspiring brow, enquired:</p>

<p>"Are we in any particular hurry, Ned?"</p>

<p>"No, Sam, no, only when I walk, I&mdash;walk."</p>

<p>"Well now, let's bring to among the trees yonder and sit to
smoke a sociable pipe."</p>

<p>So presently seated within this leafy shade they puffed in
companionly silence and content until at last the Captain enquired,
drowsily:</p>

<p>"You've never fancied any particular woman, have you, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Twice!" he answered. "But&mdash;never again. Not I!"</p>

<p>"Sam," quoth the Captain, viewing his Chief Officer's stalwart
form and grimly confident visage with twinkling eyes, "you are a
fair navigator, a prime officer afloat, but first-rate jackass and
juggins ashore!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" enquired Sam, pondering this. "Ah! Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, my over-confident numbskull, this man and woman
business, this mutual attraction, call it love, disease or madness,
takes a fellow before he's aware, and if 'tis the real thing,
brings him up with a round turn, has him in irons, ay, helpless as
dismasted hulk rolling to every sea. Or, conversely, so inspires
him that daring all he stands away fair weather or foul, heedless
of tempest, fire, fury and hell itself&mdash;so he may come to his
heart's desire."</p>

<p>"Sounds a pretty desperate business, Ned."</p>

<p>"Why so it is, shipmate. And should you ever catch this disease,
you'll take it badly, Sam, badly! So&mdash;watch out!"</p>

<p>"I will, Ned, I will indeed, for d'ye see I&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment with rustle and flurry of leaves, out from
thicket nearby stepped a pony, sleekly plump and well groomed;
which animal having paused to survey these two humans with
leisured, dispassionate gaze, snorted gently and stooped graceful
head to crop the richly succulent grass with slow-crunching
gusto.</p>

<p>"A brown cob!" said Sam.</p>

<p>"A bay pony!" quoth the Captain.</p>

<p>"Looks familiar, eh, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Joshua!" called a voice at no great distance, whereat the pony
cocked his ears and both men sat up to gaze expectantly in the one
direction, for this voice though raised, was sweet-toned and clear.
Then the leaves parted again and Sam was looking into a pair of
golden eyes set between black lashes and was so instantly and
perfectly aware of her beauty that he wondered how it had failed to
impress him before; he noticed also that she was older than he had
then supposed. At sight of them she stood suddenly arrested, yet
with no least sign of awkwardness or confusion.</p>

<p>"Miss Andromeda," said Sam rising, hat in hand, as did the
Captain, "I am glad to see...to meet you again."</p>

<p>"Oh?" said she, in her very lovely voice (thought Sam), but with
glance direct and almost challenging, "Why?"</p>

<p>"First to tell you that instead of ridiculous I think your name
is a...well...a very...lovely name. I do indeed! And secondly to
make known to you my friend Captain Edward Harlow of the
<i>Fortune</i> privateer."</p>

<p>Andromeda curtsyed gracefully, Captain Ned bowed gallantly,
saying:</p>

<p>"And may I, Miss Andromeda, present to your notice my First
Officer, Sam Felton, who should be called 'Perseus', don't you
think?"</p>

<p>"Perseus?" she repeated, wrinkling her dark brows, "Ah yes, of
course! Perseus rescued his Andromeda from a vile monster, didn't
he? So, Mr. Felton, this Andromeda thanks her Perseus again...and
very truly. And now, I'm wondering if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meda! Meda child, where are you?" Uttering this petulant
summons, a little, plump, rosy-cheeked gentleman tripped into view,
such breath-taking vision of silk-stockinged, belaced and
embroidered elegance as should have been gracing a London
drawing-room rather than these rustic solitudes; now even as Sam,
so thinking, gazed&mdash;this plumply cherubic face underwent a
sudden and terrible alteration&mdash;the eyes glared, between
parted lips was gleam of clenched teeth, the white lock of hair
above scowling brows seemed to rise like a hackle.</p>

<p>"Ch-ild," he demanded, hissing the word ferociously, "are these
scoundrels molesting you?" And with motion incredibly fast, his
right hand had armed itself with a small though deadly-looking
pistol.</p>

<p>"No, Uncle dear," she answered in her smooth, soft voice and
seeming wholly unperturbed, "no, these are the good friends who
were my protection at the inn, as I told you. So put away your
pistol, like a pet&mdash;" The little gentleman dropped the weapon
as if it had stung him and leapt forward, both hands outstretched,
crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, friends, oh, gentlemen both, I beseech on you the
benediction of Almighty God! Defenders of helpless Purity, avengers
of offended Innocence, smiters of impious Iniquity, accept my
profound gratitude. For this my Andromeda, this beloved child is
the one sweet bond that chains me to this loathed living! Your
hands, sirs, your hands! Now would I bathe them with tears of my
gratitude ineffable, but my tears were all shed long and long ago!
I am no more than withered wisp, a human husk. This my niece is my
truest consolation, without her&mdash;I perish! Meda love, the fire
burns, kettle singeth, go brew tea! These our friends shall drink
with us and eat. Nay, I protest you must and shall. For, sirs,"
said the little gentleman, taking an arm of each and leading them
whither Andromeda led, "you will be conferring a notable favour. In
me you behold one Arthur Verinder, a son of sorrow, sore smit by
the hammer of a merciless fate, since when I have existed in a
world of woe. But I am also a child of the Muses&mdash;Clio,
Euterpe, Thalia and Melpomene. I paint, I play, I sing, I dance,
and in each find some faint respite and relief...Ah, we
arrive&mdash;be welcome, sirs, to our vagrant home and
hospitality!"</p>

<p>They had reached a grassy clearing shut in by dense thickets and
great trees where stood a large, varnished caravan with, close
beside it, a roomy though weather-worn tent. Here also blazed a
fire of crackling sticks above which a blackened kettle steamed and
sang merrily; Andromeda with crooked stick and handful of grass was
trying to lift this when Sam, stepping forward, did it for her.</p>

<p>"Oh wait!" she cried, "you'll burn yourself!"</p>

<p>"I have!" he admitted, setting down the kettle very hastily.</p>

<p>"Let me look!"</p>

<p>"It's nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Show me!" Out to him came her hand, which Sam noticed instantly
was roughened by hard work yet beautifully shaped and, like her
golden eyes, so compelling, that he obeyed.</p>

<p>"Blistered, of course!" said she, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;a dab o' grease," he suggested.</p>

<p>"No, water first. Come with me to the brook. Uncle Arthur," she
called, "you must brew the tea."</p>

<p>"I cannot!" he wailed, fretfully. "I cannot, Meda. You know very
well I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Allow me, sir!" said Captain Ned. So, while this was doing,
Andromeda led her submissive patient to a brook that rippled
pleasantly nearby and there, kneeling side by side, while Sam laved
his throbbing fingers in this sweet coolness, she drew a
handkerchief from her bosom, and having soaked and folded it:</p>

<p>"Now," said she, holding out this dripping bandage; and Sam,
mutely obedient, watched her tie up his hurt.</p>

<p>"There!" sighed she, sitting back on her heels, "that should
relieve the smart a little."</p>

<p>"It has," he answered. And now, struck again by wistful sadness
of her face as she gazed down at the sparkling water of the brook,
he questioned her in his forthright manner:</p>

<p>"Pray, Miss Andromeda, why are you troubled&mdash;is
it&mdash;your uncle?"</p>

<p>Without raising her eyes she answered, almost whispering:</p>

<p>"He was such a man...once...so greatly gifted! Today he is such
a child and...so wayward. Years ago he had a shock and ever since
he has been as you see, a&mdash;little queer. He has a horror of
roof and walls...had they shut him up he would have pined to
death...So we roam the countryside vagrant as the wind...This is
why he carries the pistol, though it is never loaded, I take great
care of that..."</p>

<p>"And you've devoted yourself to his welfare, tending, working
for him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, I love him...I am all he has in the world. And then
besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An-dromeda! Tea waits and the bread and butter to cut! Come, we
famish!" cried a querulous voice. "Attend this moment, we need you,
Meda!"</p>

<p>"Coming, dear!" she called in answer and, rising with effortless
grace, went back where her uncle, throned in padded, wicker
arm-chair, watched Captain Ned buttering and slicing a crusty loaf
with sailorly dexterity.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen and good friends," said Mr. Verinder, his
bright-hovering, bird-like glance on the growing stack of thin-cut
bread and butter, "here with God's own firmament for canopy and His
verdant sward for our table, His kindly sun to bless us, we make
you welcome to our simple fare&mdash;Meda, my love, have we no jams
or jellies to honour our guests? I seem to remember a conserve of
wild strawberries you concocted for me some while ago, and richly
delicate I deemed it! Have we no meats or savouries? Have we
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, we've a ham and tongue with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let them appear eftsoons, child!"</p>

<p>"Allow me to help you," said Sam. "Please!" he added as she
hesitated. So she brought him to the caravan and following her up
its three steps, Sam was amazed to see it so spacious, richly
furnished and carpeted, with a luxurious bed at the one end in a
sort of curtained alcove, with beside this a small, collapsible
table whereon lay gold-backed brushes and comb with other toilet
articles and bottles of cut glass.</p>

<p>"At least," said he, glancing round upon this unexpected
splendour, "you are housed like a princess here, Miss
Andromeda."</p>

<p>"Not here," she answered, opening a beautifully carved locker,
"this is Uncle Arthur's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Sam. "Meaning you live&mdash;sleep&mdash;in that
dingy tent thing?"</p>

<p>"Of course! Uncle would perish in the tent and I should stifle
here! And the tent is not dingy, it's my home and I love it,
especially in summer when the stars peep at me and with the moon to
light me."</p>

<p>"Ay, but how when it blows, storms and rains?"</p>

<p>"I always set up my tent in the most sheltered places
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"D'you mean you pitch it alone? Doesn't your uncle bear a
hand?"</p>

<p>"Dear me no. He would only get all tangled up in the
guy-ropes&mdash;he did once and nearly strangled himself, poor
dear! But you see I'm used to it now and it is quite simple and
soon done."</p>

<p>"How d'you manage in winter when it sleets and snows?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have plenty of blankets. And besides I don't
mind&mdash;Oh, there is Uncle calling me! Will you please carry
this large dish?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, and the little one, too. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"No, I can manage."</p>

<p>Thus laden, back they went and with this goodly fare set out on
snowy cloth spread upon the grass, a hearty and joyous repast they
made.</p>

<p>"I am a soul," quoth Mr. Verinder, selecting a well-buttered
slice of bread and forking thereon a pinkly-delicate slice of ham,
"I am a soul, good my friends, that fain would soar to the
infinities yet pent, alas, in prison fleshly! My pinions ethereal
clipped by accursed Circumstance! For sixty and two years my spirit
has striven to win free of this earthly envelope&mdash;body is the
clog that cumbers and circumscribes my natural genius. Ah, but for
body I should be a very demi-god to sing with the everlasting
spheres&mdash;to paint Perfection that is deathless&mdash;to strike
forth melodies that should echo eternally the joys and sorrows of
God's creation."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," nodded Sam, helping Andromeda to some of her own
wild-strawberry jam, "but can you do any o' the ordinary,
common-place things o' life, trivial and yet so necessary, like f'r
instance, washing up these tea-things, chopping wood for the fire,
or scrubbing your own shirts?"</p>

<p>Mr. Verinder recoiled so violently that his wicker chair
squeaked aloud, and when he spoke it was in tone of shocked
disdain:</p>

<p>"Young man, such things do nowise interest me and therefore have
for me no actuality!"</p>

<p>"Yet, sir, you use cups and saucers and wear shirts!"</p>

<p>"Alas I do!" he sighed, now plaintively reproachful. "Base
humanity so compelling I confess I do, but as the wind blows and
flowers spring, by no volition or care of mine. Thus, young sir,
even as the sun shines and stars wink, my shirts are washed I know
not how, yet am duly grateful therefor. As to cups and saucers,
their cleaning I have attempted and broken them ere now. Wood also
I have chopped, or made the endeavour, to mine own injury, since
when I have left the axe, that crude and cruel implement, to hands
more able&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your niece's, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why of course!" said Andromeda, in her gently serene voice. "I
am quite expert with the axe&mdash;or bill-hook, yes and hammers,
too. Uncle Arthur's hands were made and meant for nobler use."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, pondering this. "Ah! What, pray?"</p>

<p>"The painting of glorious pictures! The making of divine
music&mdash;could you but hear him play his great harp! But it is
away being mended because last week I...oh, I let it fall..."</p>

<p>"Careless of you, Andromeda, criminally careless! However, I say
no more...And we yet have our small harp, child, a sweet though
feeble thing in comparison, yet it shall serve!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle!" she exclaimed breathlessly. "Oh, will you play, my
pet, will you?"</p>

<p>"We will attempt it, child, though alas&mdash;without
inspiration! This moment, Meda, we feel like abysmal creature
writhing 'neath the heel of our own unworthiness. Yet in honour of
these our guests we shall attempt. You shall sing and perchance I
also! Go fetch the instrument, child." Away sped Andromeda and
presently returned bearing the harp, a smallish though beautifully
made instrument. With this upon his knee Mr. Verinder sat mute and
still, his bright eyes upturned to the blue, cloudless heaven; then
slowly he lifted hands and touched the strings, waking them to
soft, sweet whisper of sound, then struck a full chord that melted
to a rippling ecstasy such as only a master's fingers might evoke,
a melody that rose and fell with deep suggestion of laughter and
tears, a glory of sound rising to a fervour that held his audience
spellbound till&mdash;with sudden, harsh discord, he cried, as in
swift agony:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ineptitude! Oh, accursed, clogging flesh that bars me
from achievement of the dreamed Perfection...Take it, Meda! Take it
lest I rend the strings that but for these earthly fingers might
now wake to glory the very melody of God! Take it&mdash;away!" And
he spurned the instrument from him so furiously that it would have
fallen had she not been ready to catch it.</p>

<p>"You see, good friends?" he cried, looking round on them with
tear-filled eyes. "You see how it is with me? I dream perfection so
absolute that myself being mere base human may never attain...thus
is my soul stultified by base body! Play you, my Andromeda, you my
comfort and consolation, play now and soothe my so bitter
grief&mdash;play!"</p>

<p>So Andromeda played, and though her music was tenderly soothing
and the movements of her sun-tanned arm and hand so wonderfully
graceful that Sam could look no other where, her performance lacked
the power and glorious resonance of her Uncle's passionate mastery.
Now presently her slender fingers wove from the quivering strings a
sweetly plaintive air and she began to sing in full, rich
contralto; and after a little while, her Uncle joined in with rich
and flexible baritone, and these the words they sang together:</p>

<blockquote>"Grieve not, dear love, although we oft do part<br>
But know that Nature doth us gently sever,<br>
Thereby to train us up with tender art<br>
To brook that day when we must part forever.<br>
<br>
"For Nature doubting we should be surprised<br>
By that sad day whose dread doth chiefly fear us,<br>
Doth keep us daily schooled and exercised<br>
Lest that the grief thereof should overbear us.<br>
Then grieve not, dear love, although we oft do part."</blockquote>

<p>The duet ended in a sigh with soft throb of harp like a stifled
sob, and for a moment none spoke; then:</p>

<p>"That," murmured Sam, "was almost...too beautiful!" Scarcely had
he spoken than Mr. Verinder reached out a hand, plump, dimpled,
delicately white, and clasped Sam's sinewy fingers, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend, Nature, I perceive, has blessed you with ears
that do truly hear&mdash;for this song is as truly beautiful, the
words are anonymous, the music was composed by my young friend
Eustace Jennings, a youth dowered with genius&mdash;and it was
perfectly played&mdash;God bless you, Meda love! And as perfectly
sung, God bless us both! Dear my young sailor-friend, what didst
say thy name was?"</p>

<p>"Sam Felton, sir. Pray call me Sam!"</p>

<p>"No, no! Alas&mdash;ha, poor young man to be cursed with such
patronymic, so flat, so utterly toneless, sodden as a swamp! No,
no, I shall call you Felton, there sings in Felton a fugitive
chime. Well, Felton, my dear, since God has blessed you with
hearing, has He also dowered you with sight, an eye to see latent
beauty in the mere obvious&mdash;a tree, a stock, a stone?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," answered Sam, rubbing his square, shaven chin, "I
have seen a...a glory of ocean at sunset and daybreak, likewise
something grand in raging tempest and breaking seas. Then in the
sparkle o' the little brook yonder there is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;the brook!" cried Mr. Verinder, leaping in his chair,
"I painted it this very morning...apeep amid shadows, glad with sun
like the smile of God in woeful world. Child, ha, Meda, go bring
hither my canvas, and take heed for 'tis wet. Ah, but you," said
he, turning on the Captain as Andromeda hastened to do his bidding,
"you, sir Captain&mdash;Harlow is the name, I think? You are very
pensive, your thoughts are not with us, I fear?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir," said Captain Ned, "time is getting on, and
so should we," here he drew out and consulted his watch, at sight
of which, Mr. Verinder groaned:</p>

<p>"A timepiece&mdash;hateful thing! Put it away, sir, put it away!
'Time was made for slaves!' Time is a tyrant without mercy or
reason! That we should fail to hold your interest is a grief
and&mdash;ah, Meda," he cried passionately as she approached
carrying her awkward burden, "be careful! Merciful heavens, have a
care! No, no, Felton, do not touch my picture, wait&mdash;wait, she
will manage best alone&mdash;" But, unheeding this fretful clamour,
Sam hastened forward and had relieved Andromeda of the large
painted canvas almost before she knew, and now bearing it rather
carelessly enquired:</p>

<p>"Where will you have it, sir?"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;against that tree," answered Mr. Verinder with
sullen petulance. "Turn it to your left,
more&mdash;more&mdash;another inch! So! Now stand back&mdash;look
and tell me all you see, how much or&mdash;how little. Look and
speak!"</p>

<p>A delicate harmony of greens&mdash;stately trees with leaves
that seemed astir in gentle wind, blooming thickets and velvet
sward; fugitive shadows leading the eye to a verdant gloom pierced
by vivid sun-ray reflected back from glimpse of radiant water.</p>

<p>"Well...well? What of it, friends?" The words came in a gasping,
broken whisper.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" murmured Sam.</p>

<p>"Uncle, it is beautiful, as I told you!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain, "wonderful, beautiful and&mdash;much
beside!"</p>

<p>Gazing upon his handiwork, Mr. Verinder leaned down slowly from
his chair and as slowly gathered a handful of grass; then uttering
a wailing, heart-broken cry, he leapt and scrubbed that artfully
blended glory of colour into a hideous, formless smudge.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried, passionately, hurling the ruined picture one
way and handful of clotted grass, the other, "So perish all
unworthiness! This that I meant for vision of the hidden Godhead
smiling love upon His Creation, was no more than tawdry picture of
trees and bubbling water, a mess of paint! Oh God...God of Mercy,
when&mdash;when shall I attain&mdash;achieve the dreamed
perfection, when oh&mdash;when?" And with this desolate, wailing
cry, Mr. Verinder went bounding to hide himself within the
splendour of his caravan.</p>

<p>"Poor...fellow!" murmured Sam.</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded the Captain, "yonder is tragedy!"</p>

<p>"And yet," sighed Andromeda, kneeling to collect her crockery,
"very soon he will be playing his flute or violin."</p>

<p>"So?" enquired the Captain, kneeling also (as did Sam) to help
her, "is your wonderful uncle master of these also?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there is hardly an instrument that he cannot play,
though some better than others."</p>

<p>"A truly astonishing person!" said the Captain, as he and Sam,
laden with crockery, followed Andromeda to the brook, for the
washing-up. And with these two deft-handed sailormen to help, this
business was soon done; yet there a while they lingered to
talk.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Captain Ned, "your uncle, Miss Andromeda, as painter
or musician is equally great."</p>

<p>"He was a genius&mdash;once!" she murmured, her golden eyes
uplift and radiant. "First, spoiled by too much money,
then...shocked by bitter, terrible grief and loss!"</p>

<p>"A woman, of course," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, she...was found dead in the Black Pool at Wrexford old
mill...a dark and deathly place even now&mdash;especially of an
evening!"</p>

<p>"Pray how did it happen?" enquired Captain Ned.</p>

<p>"I don't know...I never heard."</p>

<p>"But...you suspect?"</p>

<p>Dumbly, slowly she bowed her head...And now, all at once, sweet
and rich as pipe of thrush or blackbird, merry as song of mounting
lark, came the clear notes of a flute trilling in a very ecstasy of
gladness.</p>

<p>"There!" sighed Andromeda, with her slow, wistful smile, "he has
forgotten...Nature is not always cruel..." Even as she spoke the
fluting ceased and instead of this lovely sound a querulous voice
cried:</p>

<p>"An-dromeda!" Slowly she arose and glancing from Sam to the
Captain and back again, gave them each a hand, saying as she did
so:</p>

<p>"Thank you for your help&mdash;and company! And now...Good-bye!"
With the word, she turned and left them, walking with unhurried
grace but not one backward glance.</p>

<p>Quoth Sam after some while of musing silence, as they came out
upon the dusty road:</p>

<p>"The old buffer's mad, of course!"</p>

<p>"More or less, Sam, but only in the one direction. Nor-nor-east,
say."</p>

<p>"Ay," growled Sam, "knows which side his bread is buttered...and
makes a slave of&mdash;her! Did you notice her hands?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I did, messmate! Hands roughened by devotion, glorified by
service. Yes, I noticed her hands, Sam, and her clothes."</p>

<p>"What of 'em, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Glorified by her and 'spite their shabbiness."</p>

<p>"Shabby, ay!" growled Sam again, "nigh threadbare, yet how can
they be any otherwise and she always at work for that dam' selfish,
pinkly plump&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cherub, Sam! He seems no more than child-man and yet, ah, by
old Davy Jones, he is so greatly more&mdash;a veritable
master!"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;but what of&mdash;her?"</p>

<p>"Well, my Perseus, your Andromeda might be a rare beauty if she
would, but she cares nothing for her appearance and never
will&mdash;no, not till LOVE, spelt in capitals, Sam, wakes her
selfless, sleeping womanhood!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" quoth Sam and strode on in such gloomy abstraction and for
so long that the Captain nudged him at last and enquired:</p>

<p>"What d'you think of her, Mister Mate?" And Sam replied in most
sombrely ponderous manner:</p>

<p>"That she is the...saddest woman creature I ever saw, ay, and
the bravest...except one. For d'ye see, Ned, her little hands are
as hard with patient service, and as rough, almost, as the hands
of...my devoted...mother."</p>

<h3><a name="ch108" id="ch108"></a>CHAPTER VIII. HOW THEY CAME TO
WILLOWMEAD</h3>

<p>It was an evening lit by glowing sunset when they came to the
parting of the ways, for here three roads converged; and here Sam
paused to mop brow, glance about and enquire:</p>

<p>"What course d'ye give me, Captain, how do we steer, sir?"</p>

<p>"Larboard, Master, full and by."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir, full and by it is. But, if I may make so bold,
where do we bring-to for the night?"</p>

<p>"In snug harbour, Sam, a right good anchorage, messmate!
Now&mdash;hard a-starboard!" So saying, Captain Ned turned sharp
right down a pleasant, tree-shaded lane, along which they had not
gone very far when Sam halted again and suddenly; for before them
was an age-mellowed, thatched farmhouse not too small, set within a
flowery garden not too large, beyond which was a paddock wherein a
plump steed nibbled; here also stood a row of beehives, and beyond
these an orchard with beyond this again, a lush meadow where
several corpulent cows chewed in somnolent beatitude. Beholding all
this, Sam drew a deep breath and spoke:</p>

<p>"Ned," he began&mdash;but at this moment the cottage door opened
and a woman appeared, a tall, handsome creature in shady sun-bonnet
and sprigged gown and who, espying the travellers stood suddenly
arrested, then, with both hands outstretched in welcome, she came
hurrying and her face the more lovely for the look it now wore.</p>

<p>"Edward!" she cried, breathlessly. "Oh, Ned!" And striding
forward, the Captain took those welcoming hands and said in voice
quite new to Sam:</p>

<p>"Katherine...Oh, my Kate...at last!" He drew her close, her
shapely body yielding to his arms, and seemed about to kiss her,
checked the impulse, saying instead:</p>

<p>"Katherine, I've brought my First Officer along, this is the Sam
I've told you about, Sam Felton, he improves on acquaintance!
Sam&mdash;Mistress Katherine Ford."</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton," said she with smile of hearty greeting, "indeed
you are very welcome."</p>

<p>"Miss Ford," he answered, taking off the glazed hat as their
hands met, "I'm very grateful and as greatly relieved."</p>

<p>"Relieved?" she enquired. "Good gracious&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"To find all things so vastly better than expected."</p>

<p>"What did you expect?"</p>

<p>"A cottage, a garden, beehives, a horse, cows and&mdash;a
woman."</p>

<p>"Well, I am a woman."</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, "such woman as might spoil the best sailor-man
that ever trod deck."</p>

<p>"Oh, but how spoil him, pray?"</p>

<p>"By turning him into a landsman, Miss Ford." She laughed,
flushing consciously as she met the Captain's adoring gaze.</p>

<p>"Well, now come indoors...we've a barrel of ale, home brewed,
and cider besides perry and small beer&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>"First," said Sam, "by your leave, Miss Ford, I'll bear away for
a look at those beehives and the cows." So saying, off he went,
leaving them together; scarcely was he out of sight than they were
in each other's arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ned," she whispered, clinging to him, the sun-bonnet
crushed against his breast, "are you...free? Have you come
home...home to me at last?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "yes, thank God, I'm home at last...here in
your arms, Kate, your heart on mine...nevermore to let you
go..."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sam, having looked at the beehives from a respectful
distance, and surveyed the cows who blinked at him with drowsy
graciousness, wandered on and thus presently found himself back in
the shady lane. Here he paused and stood, somewhat at a loss,
looking at nothing in particular, for remembering the sudden, deep
tenderness in his Captain's voice, the look of inexpressible joy in
Katherine's face, he felt himself stranger in a world unknown, with
sense of greater loneliness than he had ever found leisure to
experience in all his busy and hazardous life.</p>

<p>It was a narrow lane this, with steep, grassy banks where ferns
sprouted and wild flowers bloomed; here sinking down rather
wearily, Sam began to ponder his altered circumstances and then
muse upon his immediate future until these ruminations were
interrupted by a child's voice upraised in song, a sweet though
timeless chant that had to do with someone called "Bluebell" and a
personage named Jane.</p>

<p>Presently the singer herself appeared, carrying a very large
doll, and stood instantly mute, staring at Sam, who gazed as dumbly
on her; and when this silence had endured for perhaps half a
minute, he smiled and she, beholding his face thus transfigured,
smiled also and spoke:</p>

<p>"I'm granny's Jane, who's are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm nobody's Sam," he answered, "I'm all alone."</p>

<p>"Alone?" she repeated. "Haven't you got any granny to hear you
say your prayers an' tuck you up in bed with a kiss, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, gravely, "not any longer, because my dear
mother is dead."</p>

<p>"Ooh&mdash;so's mine!" exclaimed this small person, brightly.
"That's why I've got a granny instead, and a auntie too! Have
you?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Then you must be awful' lonely&mdash;so you shall be a uncle
for me. I've only got one and have my child a bit to comfort you
while I talk to you, and her name's Batilda."</p>

<p>"Eh, Matilda?"</p>

<p>"No, Ba-tilda, and when she's not naughty nobody could be gooder
and she's good now and'll comfort you&mdash;take her!" Obediently
Sam folded the doll in his great arms as the child seated herself
beside him.</p>

<p>"Now if I'm your uncle, you must be my niece&mdash;and your
name's Jane, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an' 'Charmian' too an' I b'long to my granny what has a
donkey named Robert. And your name's Sam and I like it b'cause it's
nice and quick."</p>

<p>"And I like 'Jane' because it means you."</p>

<p>"And I like everybody 'cept Mr. Tangy."</p>

<p>"Who's he, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Well, he is the man who always makes my granny pay too much
rent, she always says so because she's a lorn widow's body this
thirty weary years and money is hard come by. I've heard her say so
lots 'n' lots of times. And now I think I hear her calling me."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose you'd better go, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh no! If I only wait patiently she'll come to me, she always
does."</p>

<p>"Oho?" murmured Sam. "Aha!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" nodded Jane. "So 'course I always wait...why are you
smiling at me for?"</p>

<p>"Thoughts, my dear."</p>

<p>"Well, I like you even more when you smile 'cause it makes your
face nicer."</p>

<p>"It's not much of a face, eh, little Jane?"</p>

<p>"Well, no it's not," she answered, gazing up at him in wide-eyed
scrutiny. "And you've been hurting it, but I like it&mdash;in
places." Now at this, Sam chuckled and felt so strangely glad that
minded to kiss her, he laughed instead.</p>

<p>"Jane, come you...to me!" cried a voice resonant, commanding,
albeit somewhat short-winded; Sam held out the doll, saying:</p>

<p>"I think you'd better go, little Jane."</p>

<p>"Very well!" she sighed. "Only you must come too an' carry my
Batilda."</p>

<p>So up they rose, but had gone only a little way when round a
bend in this winding lane strode an aged though formidable dame;
she wore a black dress that rustled to her every vigorous stride,
she bore a ponderous stick, and she glared on the universe beneath
a large poke bonnet, tied on somewhat askew.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;oh!" she exclaimed, halting suddenly with a thump of
stick upon the earth before her and scowling portentously. "There
you are&mdash;hey, mistress, hey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here's me, Granny, an' this is a man called Sam what I've
found for my uncle an' he needs a granny too because he's a lonely
lorn body like you."</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;indeed!" exclaimed this intimidating old lady,
surveying Sam with such keen and terrible eye that he almost
cowered. "Have I not told you over and over again never to talk
with strangers&mdash;and especially men, Ma'm Disobedience?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Granny, only Sam looked so all alone an' I like him though
he hasn't got much of a face&mdash;he told me so, and my Batilda
likes him too."</p>

<p>"And, indeed," said Sam, taking off the glazed hat, "I'm a
little better than I look, marm, and well beknown to Captain Edward
Harlow."</p>

<p>"So don't you think, Granny, that we ought to take him home and
tuck him up in bed with a 'kiss me good-night' like a nice granny
should, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I do&mdash;not! And you," she demanded, frowning upon Sam
again, "how am I to know the Captain is your friend?"</p>

<p>"By stepping so far as Miss Ford's house."</p>

<p>"Ha! So you know Kate Ford?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, since about half-an-hour ago."</p>

<p>"So the Captain is there again, is he! A rolling stone like all
sailormen and no fit mate for any sensible
woman&mdash;rickety-racketsome rovers as they are&mdash;and you're
another by your looks?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, though I fancy our roving days are over&mdash;at
least Captain Ned's are, I'm afraid, which is marvellous great
pity!"</p>

<p>"What then, is he leaving his seafaring ways at last?"</p>

<p>"He shall tell you himself if you trouble to go far as the
farmhouse, marm."</p>

<p>"I will, seeing I'm on my way there now to borrow a
goffering-iron and a pinch o' tea. So lend me your arm, young man,
these hills, drattem&mdash;make me know my age."</p>

<p>"And you're so awful' old, aren't you, Granny?"</p>

<p>"No older than I feel, child."</p>

<p>"And you feel such lots, don't you, Granny? Lots an' lots 'cause
you're such a poor, old, lorn, widow's body this thirty year,
aren't you, Granny dear?"</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity, chatterbox! Cuddle your dolly and hush!" quoth the
old lady, clutching Sam's ready arm in surprisingly powerful grip,
saying as she did so: "Now not too fast, young man, remember I'm
not so young as I was."</p>

<p>"He's a nice big Uncle Sam, isn't he, Granny?"</p>

<p>"He is, child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bigger'n Uncle Captain Ned, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, kiss your dolly and be silent, Jane!"</p>

<p>"But how can I when Sam's nursing her? And she isn't a dolly now
'cause she's growed herself into my child an' I told you her name's
Batilda&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now did you ever hear such a pert little magpie?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Sam, "but now that I do it does me a power o'
good."</p>

<p>"Ha! You are fond of children?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes I...I suppose so, marm."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean by 'suppose so'?"</p>

<p>"Why d'ye see, I've never seen or heard any at close quarters
till now."</p>

<p>"No children of your own, then?"</p>

<p>"Lord&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Married?"</p>

<p>"No, marm, certainly not and no will that way."</p>

<p>"Which comes of your roisterous roving!"</p>

<p>"Not so, marm, for women and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, not before the child! And don't tell me of your wanton
wanderings from port to port and most of them foreign, of course,
sinfully shamefully foreign, eh, young man, eh?"</p>

<p>"More or less, marm, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, young man, your 'buts' will butter no parsnips with
me&mdash;No, no! For as a respectable Englishwoman and
great-grand-mother at that, I do&mdash;not&mdash;hold with
foreigners, especially females, with their jargon, their foreign
ways and lawless goings on&mdash;no! Just look what they did to
their poor, dear Queen Antoinette in that wicked Paris with their
nasty guillotine and tumbrils and things! Think what they would do
to us if they could! Thank God for our Lord Nelson to 'frustrate
their knavish tricks'! say I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was a 'roving sailor' also, marm."</p>

<p>"And also the preserver of England, and that means the whole
wide world too, God bless him! And now that he is dead, having
ascended through the smoke of battle and blood of Trafalgar, he is
risen with his one arm and poor blind eye to be a bright angel
of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ooh, but Granny, can a bright angel be a real angel with only
one arm and a blind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He can, Jane, he has! I think our merciful Creator has
cherished and healed his poor, maimed body&mdash;if not, then the
wounds he suffered for England and the right, will only make his
heavenly glory shine the brighter."</p>

<p>"But, Granny&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be hushed, child, and suffer your elders to speak! Young man,
there's a look about you strikes a familiar note, and I'm wondering
how and why! Be pleased to inform me&mdash;your name."</p>

<p>"Felton, madam, Sam Felton, and humbly at your service."</p>

<p>"Ha!" she exclaimed, glancing at him with her keen old eyes.
"You spoke that as if you really meant it."</p>

<p>"Because I do&mdash;indeed!" he answered.</p>

<p>"Well, I am Anne Leet, who used to have servants at her beck and
call, male and female, forty-six and a half of 'em&mdash;the half
was Joe Tangy the boot-boy. But this was when I ruled the Great
House, years ago."</p>

<p>"Where is that, marm?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, when the Great House is mentioned hereabouts it can
only mean one and that is Wrybourne Feveril, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Sam, thoughtfully. "Ah?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, young man, you would say 'Oh' and 'Ah' if you
could see it&mdash;all the glory of it! Throned on its three
terraces&mdash;gable and chimney and noble frontage! And then its
panelled chambers, painted ceilings, great carved mantels, and
splendid hall, the gardens English and Dutch, the deer park! Ah,
you ought to see it for yourself!"</p>

<p>"I should like to&mdash;with you to show it to me, Mrs.
Leet&mdash;could you?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, to be sure. Mr. Perkins, the butler, is still there
and Thomas, the first footman. I've shown hundreds of visitors
over, before now, the splendid furniture and famous pictures, Lely,
Holbein, Reynolds&mdash;and many other famous painters...And here
we are&mdash;already!" she exclaimed as Sam opened the garden gate.
"This Willowmead is a pretty farm-house, I always think, eh, Mr.
Felton."</p>

<p>"Ay, it is, marm, being neither too large nor yet too
small."</p>

<p>"And cosy as it looks. Come your ways in&mdash;no need to
knock!" So saying she led the way into a spacious chamber, half
parlour, half kitchen, its walls adorned by one or two dim pictures
and many brightly burnished pots and pans of glowing copper and
shining pewter, its wide generous hearth where spicy logs
smouldered, flanked by roomy, cushioned settles, its massive,
age-blackened rafters hung with bunches of sweet herbs and one or
two noble, smoked hams.</p>

<p>Beyond the open, many-paned lattice was a garden where flowers
bloomed, growing how they would, to blend their many-hued sweetness
in a very glory of colour and fragrance&mdash;a place this of leafy
nooks and shady corners where birds chirped or piped
melodiously&mdash;an unpretentious and therefore lovable garden,
and all the more so because of the two who walked there seeing only
each other and talking murmurously as they approached until
suddenly, as by mutual consent, they turned to clasp and kiss one
another...</p>

<p>"Gemini!" exclaimed the aged dame, her keen eyes widening on
these unseeing happy ones. "Goodness me!" Then rapping the window
frame with her ponderous staff, she called in ringing tones:
"Aho&mdash;Ned, Kate&mdash;what do I see?"</p>

<p>And turning to smile on her questioner, Katherine answered:</p>

<p>"Happiness, Anne! My love has come home to me&mdash;at
last."</p>

<p>"True enough, Grannyanne," said the Captain, advancing with hand
outstretched, "the banns go up at once...Kate will be my wife soon
as possible! Yes, I've quit the sea, Granny, from now on, I'm
Kate's farmer and man of all work."</p>

<p>"Ha, well, Ned," said Mrs. Leet, shaking hands with vigorous
heartiness, "you've served your country at sea against the moosoos
and done mighty well, I hear. But now you're safe home with your
Kate my prayer is may the Lord bless ye to each other and send you
sturdy children to be your joy and serve Old England after you! And
now, Kate, I've dragged my poor old bones here, with this young
man's help, to ask the loan of a goffering-iron and a pinch or so
of tea."</p>

<p>"Why yes, Granny, and you'll bide for supper, of course."</p>

<p>"No, Katie, no thankee&mdash;here's my little Jane should be in
bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' I found this Sam all alone, Auntie Kate, to be a nuncle for
me, isn't he nice an' big! An' he's carried my Batilda all the way
'cause she likes him an' so do I!"</p>

<p>"Bless the child!" laughed Kate as she entered the house,
seeming to bring something of the glad sunshine with her. "Come and
kiss me, Jane."</p>

<p>Up reached the childish arms and down to them stooped the
graceful woman.</p>

<p>"Now," said Jane when they had embraced, "now Auntie Kate, I
want you to be Sam's auntie, too, 'cause he's so all alone that he
hasn't got any aunties or even a single granny. An' you see he's
been hurting his poor face, an' he says it's not much of a face but
I like it in parts, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Katherine, her shapely lips made lovelier by the
smile that curved them, "yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Well then, won't you be his auntie too, an' tuck him up at
night an' kiss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goodness&mdash;gracious&mdash;me!" gasped Mrs. Leet.
"Hoity-toity! Come you home at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Granny, no&mdash;please!" Katherine pleaded in laugh-shaken
tones. "Pray let her sleep here tonight with me. And besides,
Granny, you must stay and sup with us, I insist&mdash;for by the
happiest chance I have something in the oven, my dear, that I hope
may be worthy of this&mdash;oh, this most wonderful
occasion&mdash;a favourite dish of yours, too! Now Jane, let's go
to the cook-house and see what Nancy and I can find for you."</p>

<p>Speaking, Katherine opened a certain door&mdash;and lo! Upon the
ambient air stole such mouth-watering, hunger-begetting,
palate-wooing savour of luscious, cunningly seasoned baking meats
that Mrs. Leet sighed, handed her staff to Sam and removing her
enormous bonnet, gave it to Captain Ned; then throned upon nearest
settle, she spread her voluminous skirts, folded her hands, and
drawing a long breath through her rather hawk-like nose, sighed
again, saying:</p>

<p>"Ah, Ned, Captain Ned, I hope you are duly aware what extreme
fortunate man you are to have won to wife such beauty, so much
gentle loveliness as Kate&mdash;a wife who can not only bewitch the
eye, but also gratify the stomach&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh? Stomach?" repeated Captain Ned.</p>

<p>"Of course!" nodded Mrs. Leet. "For a wife's beauties, alas,
fade with time&mdash;look at me&mdash;but a good cook improves with
age! And our Kate is most excellent housewife and cook. Now, for
instance, my nose is informing me, and it is never wrong, that we
are shortly destined to enjoy a hare, jugged, in thick gravy
enriched by port-wine and seasoned with force-meat balls...Ah,
Captain Ned, I say again you are an exceedingly fortunate man!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch109" id="ch109"></a>CHAPTER IX. HOW AND WHY SAM
BECAME A "GRANDSON"</h3>

<p>The jugged hare had become a joyous memory and one that was to
endure; little Jane, having been kissed "Good-night" had climbed
the "wooden hills" and kneeling by Auntie Kate had said her brief
though vociferous prayers and thereafter had been tucked up with
her Batilda in Auntie Kate's big bed with its dainty curtains; and
now her elders, sitting in comfort of soft candlelight and cosy
fireglow, for the night was chilly, began to converse, thus:</p>

<p>MRS. LEET (<i>Producing knitting from capacious reticule</i>):
Betsy Pardoe's sow farrowed yesterday, eleven and all doing
well!</p>

<p>CAPT. NED (<i>Taking out pipe and tobacco</i>): Ah, of course,
we must have pigs, Kate! May we smoke?</p>

<p>KATE: Let me fill your pipe...There are tapers on the
mantel-shelf.</p>

<p>SAM (<i>Beginning to fill his own pipe</i>): Miss Ford,
I&mdash;</p>

<p>KATE: No, please call me Kate or Katherine and I shall call you
"Sam," because though we only met tonight, you are no stranger. Ned
has often told me about you&mdash;oh yes, and how you saved the
second harpooner from drowning when that great whale upset the boat
in his dying flurry. And afterwards when you went to fight the
French and boarded the corvette off Toulon was it? how you drove
off the enemies who would have killed him&mdash;my Ned&mdash;</p>

<p>SAM (<i>Busy with pipe</i>): But I'll warrant he never told you
how he dragged me from death aboard the <i>Citoyenne</i> frigate
when they'd downed me with a musket-butt, kept the mounseers at bay
and with only his cutlass until our lads charged to our rescue.</p>

<p>KATE (<i>Looking up at her Captain with adoring eyes</i>): No,
Sam, he never mentioned that!</p>

<p>SAM: Nor yet when I rammed my head against a froggies'
boarding-pike and should have been trampled but for him, or the
time when our main-top-mast was shot away and I, going aloft to
clear it, got fouled by the wreckage and should have gone overboard
but that he&mdash;</p>

<p>CAPT. NED (<i>Stooping to light taper at the fire</i>): Belay
now, Sam, let's be done with the past and talk of the
future&mdash;</p>

<p>KATE: No, Sam, go on&mdash;tell me more about my
sailorman&mdash;</p>

<p>CAPT. NED: Who is turning farmer, Kate, your farmer! Ay, and I'm
hoping Sam will swallow the anchor likewise and turn landsman, too.
How about it, messmate?</p>

<p>SAM: (<i>Smiling into Kate's happy face as she holds the lighted
taper to his pipe</i>): Why as to that, Ned, I'm nowise
sure&mdash;yet.</p>

<p>NED: However, you'll stand by long enough to bear a hand
on&mdash;the day! My best man, eh, Sam?</p>

<p>SAM (<i>Puffing</i>): Ay, with all my heart!</p>

<p>MRS. LEET (<i>Clicking her knitting-pins indignantly</i>): That
Tangy wretch called on me today! Sat on his horse at my gate and
shouted me, he did! I was hoeing weeds and felt like hoeing
him&mdash;clouting his nasty arrogant head.</p>

<p>KATE: Yes, Mr. Tangy can make himself very unpleasant. Was it
your rent, Granny?</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: Of course! It always is! And because I ventured to
complain again of my roof leaking. A hard master makes a harder
man!</p>

<p>NED: This Tangy is Lord Wrybourne's bailiff, isn't he?</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: That he is&mdash;and many's the time I've boxed his
impudent young ears when he was a bit of a boy&mdash;and foot-boy
at that! Ah, but now, Kate, now my Earl is dead, and good
riddance&mdash;I'm wondering and so are others, what the new Earl
will be.</p>

<p>KATE: Yes, everyone is talking of that. Yesterday when I drove
to Lewes market, old Farmer Bagshaw told me our new Earl was
abroad, living in foreign parts, and&mdash;</p>

<p>MRS. LEET (<i>With ferocious contempt</i>): Foreign! Then, Kate,
so much the worse for us and the rest of his tenantry! For, now
mark my words, he will have turned foreign in his ways&mdash;and
I'd rather put up with a hard English landlord than a bad foreign
one!</p>

<p>KATE: But, Granny, being the old Earl's son he is English
really, and you remember his mother, don't you?</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: To be sure I did&mdash;and before!</p>

<p>SAM: (<i>Forgetting to smoke</i>): How so, marm? Pray what might
you mean by "before"?</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: I mean, young man, before she was a mother. Ah,
before the Earl married, and so suddenly, too&mdash;I was in charge
of the Great House which I always thought much too good, all too
noble and splendid for such a base wretch!</p>

<p>SAM: What wretch, marm?</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: The Earl, of course, with his drinking and nameless
abandonments! How such a sweet, gentle creature could ever have
married him I don't know and can't think! However, she
did&mdash;ah, but&mdash;poor child&mdash;from the very day, the
first hour he brought her home, she began to be afraid of him, to
pine and languish, and he to neglect and then abuse her,
frightening the poor, sweet soul till she'd fly to me for
protection!</p>

<p>SAM (<i>Polishing pipe-howl absently on broad palm</i>): And did
you...protect her?</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: I think so, I hope so! It comforts me now to know I
truly did my best...</p>

<p>SAM: And was...she...comforted?</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: Ah&mdash;no! That is the dreadful part of it! So
things went on for nigh six awful months, getting from bad to worse
until one evening she came running to me, breathless, white as a
sheet and all of a tremble. "Oh, Anne!" she gasps, clinging to me,
"he's going to whip me!" "Oh, no!" says I, clasping her, "he shan't
do that, my lady." "Ah, but he will," she sobbed, "he will, he's
got a whip and he's after me&mdash;now&mdash;ah, listen!" "My
lady," says I, reaching for the fire-irons, "get you behind my
easy-chair," but before she could we heard the jingle of his spurs
and in he came, dressed for hunting and, sure enough, a whip in his
hand! Yes&mdash;in he rushed but checked suddenly, for there was I,
fire-shovel in one hand, tongs in the other.</p>

<p>"My lord," says I, "this is my room, so out you go or take
these!"</p>

<p>But he only laughed at me and made a step forward&mdash;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Leet, having roused her audience to pitch of
breathless suspense, went on with her knitting until stayed by
Sam's large though very gentle hand and voice in subdued but eager
question:</p>

<p>"And what did you do?"</p>

<p>"Threw the shovel at him," she replied, with ferocious nod,
"then the tongs, and when he saw me snatch up the poker, he laughed
again but went. So I slammered the door and locked it."</p>

<p>"Yes," enquired Sam, "yes and what then?"</p>

<p>"That night was a grand party for other wretches abandoned as
himself, fine gentlemen and ladies too&mdash;leastways males and
females! And so it was we found chance to run away, my lady and I.
And when we'd left the Great House far behind and we both
breathless with running, 'Where now, my dear lady'? says I. 'To my
cousin Felton at Alciston, she will shelter me if only for tonight
and he can never find me there,' says my poor lady. So to her
cousin Felton we came and kindly welcome they made her, Mrs. Felton
and her good husband. And there her baby was born, this same new
Earl, though his sorrowful, too-sweet, much too-gentle mother
didn't live long enough to enjoy him properly, she faded like a
flower and died with a smile on her lovely face and her poor,
motherless head upon this bosom, these arms of mine close about
her..." The long, steel knitting-pins clashed and were stilled, the
bright, fierce old eyes were gentled and dimmed by sudden, kindly
tears.</p>

<p>"Ah, Granny dear," sighed Katherine, "'tis very piteous,
dreadful story! You never told me this before."</p>

<p>"No reason to," quoth Mrs. Leet, her knitting-pins clicking
busily again. "And I don't know why I spoke of it now...Though it's
odd your name should be Felton too, eh, young man?"</p>

<p>"Yes...I suppose so," answered Sam; and then after musing
hesitation: "Marm," said he, very diffidently and staring hard at
my Granny too, "if...if you will so honour me...and so, pray call
me 'Sam,' will you?"</p>

<p>"Sam!" snapped the old lady, instantly, clicking away at her
knitting but viewing him with her sharp, steady eyes, "and I'll
'Granny' you so long as you're in sight or sound of me&mdash;if
only because my little Jane put you in her prayers this night,
which means a great deal, for the eyes of children, especially
girl-children, are quick to see and&mdash;heed! And my small,
great-granddaughter is no fool! Besides you're a friend and
shipmate of our Captain Ned, and this means a great deal
also&mdash;eh, Kate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Granny. And, Sam, this is why we are hoping, Ned and I,
that we may persuade you to settle down with us. You shall have the
gable-room, it's all ready for you now! Because Ned and I&mdash;if
we can only buy this farm, are hoping we may learn you to love the
land, this rich, good, kindly earth better than you ever did the
treacherous sea. Ah, if only we could buy this dear place, this
home to be our very own for ever! But Lord Wrybourne is so
hatefully rich I'm afraid he will never sell."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, pondering this. "Ah! So this house and so
forth belongs to the Earl, does it?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Sam! All the land hereabout is his&mdash;far as you
can see, and beyond."</p>

<p>"Shame!" growled Sam. "What's he ever done to own so much,
worked for it? Not a hand's turn! Fought for it? Never a stroke,
I'll warrant, not he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but Sam, his ancestors did, in some wars and battles long
ago and some King gave it as reward. The Scropes have been here for
hundreds of years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it's about time they were cleared out&mdash;for a precious
fine lot they seem to have been!"</p>

<p>"Very true, Sam!" nodded Granny. "All too true! But lords of the
soil they were, are, and will be, good or bad&mdash;and that's
England, and the wonder of it. But now, seeing it is past ten
o'clock, your Granny is going to ask&mdash;no, demand the loan of
that big arm of yours so far as her cottage."</p>

<p>"And here it is, Granny, at your service whenso you need it,"
answered Sam, rising to help the old lady to her feet, while
Katherine brought her large bonnet and Captain Ned, her stick.</p>

<p>"And when," she demanded, as Katherine tied her bonnet-strings,
"when does your Aunt Deborah return?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, Granny, thank goodness! Sam, you'll love her, for
she's the dearest, smallest, gentlest Aunt that ever was, I do
believe."</p>

<p>"Ah!" nodded Granny. "'Tis pity she never was wed, some man lost
notable good wife in Deb. Well, good night, my dears both, the Lord
bless and keep ye!" Then grasping her ponderous stick in one fist
and Sam in the other, forth she led him into a night where stars
were paling to herald a rising moon.</p>

<p>"Talking of wives and marriage," said Granny, as they turned
into the lane, "yon shall be a good, true mating, I pray
God&mdash;present joy with the future gladness of children! When
shall you do likewise, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Me? Oh no, Granny, for d'ye see, I'm not the marrying
sort...no airs or graces to catch a woman's eye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tush and nonsense, Sam! You're a born lover, and consequently
will become a respectably married husband&mdash;let's hope."</p>

<p>"Lord, Granny, you seem uncomfortably sure and certain of
it!"</p>

<p>"I am! With those black-fringed, wide-spaced eyes, that
aggressive nose, that mouth and chin you will be tempestuous, all
fire and fury as a lover, take heed you're not too serenely placid
as a husband!"</p>

<p>"But, Granny, I've no inclination that way or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pish and fiddlestick! You have and you are&mdash;it's all in
the cut o' your jib, Sam."</p>

<p>"Cut o' my&mdash;marm, I mean Granny, you're a wonder! You talk
now like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, like my own father, Sam, for he was a seaman too and
sailed round the world with Lord Anson aboard the <i>Centurion</i>
and was wounded beside him afterwards in battle&mdash;there's
honour for you! Some day, if you don't run off and leave us too
soon, I'll show you his fighting-sword and one presented to him,
with other things I treasure. But now yonder is my cottage with its
dratted leaky roof! Yet before we part, I'll tell you something of
that too-beautiful sweetness named Katherine and the danger that
threatens her."</p>

<p>"Danger?" enquired Sam, halting suddenly, "what danger,
Granny?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Beauty's usual menace, a man of course&mdash;but this such
an arrogant, calmly assured, most determined villain, who beneath a
courteous respect and specious promises masks brutish lust&mdash;an
infamous fine gentleman notorious for his gallantries, Lord Julian
Scrope, no less!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured Sam. "It would be!"</p>

<p>"So you know of him?"</p>

<p>"Ay, enough&mdash;but&mdash;does Kate?"</p>

<p>"She does, Sam, and avoids him all she may. Ah, but my lord
troubles himself to ride this way all too frequently."</p>

<p>"Oh!" quoth Sam. "Ah? About how old is he?"</p>

<p>"Forty or thereabouts, the dangerous age and a very dangerous
man!"</p>

<p>"And what are his&mdash;um&mdash;days of call?"</p>

<p>"Whenever wickedness prompts him, and so my new anxiety is lest
Captain Ned antagonize him, because, as I tell you, my lord is such
a cold, deadly-dangerous wretch."</p>

<p>"Ay, but then," murmured Sain, "so is Ned! And, for that matter,
under certain circumstances, I'm no pet lamb."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she sighed, as Sam opened her cottage gate, "maybe
I'm over-anxious. Good night&mdash;bring me my little Jane in the
morning and I'll show you some of my treasures, my father's sword
of honour, with other curious oddments. Now, good night and God
keep you all, ay&mdash;the three of you!"</p>

<p>On his way back, Sam pondered whether or no to warn Captain Ned
of this lurking threat to his peace and future happiness; finally
and for obvious reasons, he decided to say nothing, but since this
foul menace was his own uncle, to make it a family affair should
violence become necessary. Thus, later on, as they lit their
candles for bed, Sam remarked, casually:</p>

<p>"On second thoughts, Kate and Ned, because I know you meant it,
I'll accept your hospitality right gladly and bide here at
Willowmead till some foul wind sends me adrift."</p>

<p>"Small fear of that, Sam, with such tried seaman as
yourself."</p>

<p>"Thankee, Ned, but the best of us are apt to be taken aback
sometime or other."</p>

<p>"However," said Katherine, "you're staying for the present! And
we'll teach you to reap and mow, to stack and thatch and lay a
hedge, eh, Ned? And, ah, Sam, the more you learn and longer you
remain the harder you'll find it ever to go away! And now," said
she, as they followed her up the wide, old stair, "tread softly
lest you wake our Jane."</p>

<h3><a name="ch110" id="ch110"></a>CHAPTER X. INTRODUCES MR.
JENNINGS</h3>

<p>The Honourable Ralph, dismounting in stable-yard, scowled at the
bow-legged old groom who hobbled forward to take his hard-ridden
steed.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you staring at?"</p>

<p>"Nought! Never nothing at all, Master Ralph."</p>

<p>"Then don't look as if you were."</p>

<p>"Been a bit fierce like wi' your 'Lassie,' ain't you, sir?" said
the old groom, running gentle, experienced hand along the mare's
drooping crest. "Eh, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I have, damme! I wasn't thinking&mdash;that is, I was
thinking too devilish hard of other things. Look to her, Tom, a
good rub down and&mdash;no, let Will. Ho, Will, come and take the
mare!" At which summons a young groom appeared who chewed a straw,
knuckled an eyebrow and led the distressed animal away. "Come now,
Tom," said the Hon. Ralph as soon as they were alone, "out with it!
Is my chivvy, my phiz&mdash;is my face much damaged...very
noticeably, eh, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied the old groom, surveying the speaker's usually
almost too-handsome visage, its beauty of outline now marred by
sundry lumps and abrasions, "a bit&mdash;odd-like it be, sir."</p>

<p>"Eh, curse it! How so, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Lop-sided, Master Ralph! A bit more of it one side than
t'other."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn!" muttered Ralph, feeling the left and more damaged
side of his face with tenderly exploring fingers. "Tell me, is it
so dev'lish noticeable, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Rather so, Master Ralph. But only o' the one side, t'other 'un
be all as it should ought for to be&mdash;almost."</p>

<p>"Hell!" snarled Ralph. "Is the Governor in?"</p>

<p>"Ay! And 'e wants ee&mdash;very pertickler, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does he, b'gad! What for? Damnation, what's up now?"</p>

<p>"Dunno, sir, only 'e's sent that Mr. Jennin's along yere twice,
to say as 'ow you was to go to m'lord in the libree the moment as
you rode in yere, Master Ralph."</p>

<p>"Not me, Tom, damme no! He mustn't see me like this! Here's
where I lie low, ay&mdash;I'll sleep in your cottage tonight and
your Martha shall doctor this damaged phiz o' mine and get me a
change of linen."</p>

<p>"Ay, your shirt be very tore and bloody, sir. Looks like lions
and tigers 'ad been maulin' of ee&mdash;wild beasts wi' claws and
sich."</p>

<p>"And egad, Tom, this was a beast and wild enough&mdash;on two
legs and a left, Tom, a left pepperer there was no getting past
and&mdash;no avoiding! Ha, but I'll seek him out and have another
go, by George, I will. And next time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better luck, let's 'ope, sir! Now off with ee, Martha'll put ee
to rights and&mdash;no, too late, Master Ralph!"</p>

<p>"Eh? What d'ye mean, what the devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Devil, ah&mdash;Mr. Jennin's, sir! He's seen ee and comin' for
ee, Master Ralph."</p>

<p>"Ha, that pallid wriggler! How I loathe the fellow."</p>

<p>"Same yere, sir!" muttered old Tom as they watched my lord's
gentleman pick his way daintily and with quite unnecessary care
across the clean-swept stable-yard. "Look at 'im!" growled the old
groom. "Picks up they pretty trotters of his like any delicate
miss! 'E ought for to be in petticuts!"</p>

<p>"You're right, Tom! But whichever and however he's a wriggling
worm, the Governor's pet, consequently a power and he knows it,
damn him!"</p>

<p>Mr. Jennings was indeed a delicate and dainty creature, his air,
attire and every graceful movement proclaimed the fact&mdash;he
also wriggled, that is to say, whenever he bowed to or addressed
anyone he did so with a graciously insinuating sideways twist, and
when he spoke it was in a flute-like tenor softly modulated, while
his sloping shoulders performed this slow, quite graceful writhing
movement; as they were doing now:</p>

<p>"Oh, my Ralph, dear fellow," he fluted, "my lord your Father
presents his compliments and begs the favour of your presence in
the library, immediately, dear boy, this mom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it, Jennings! What he really said was: 'bid that dam' son
o' mine to me at once'&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, your knowledge of him confounds my poor diplomacy,"
sighed Mr. Jennings with a writhe. "Yes, my lord's message was
phrased a little more bluntly. But, as you are aware, your noble
sire has been much perturbed of late! A bolt, Master Ralph, a bolt
from the blue, dear sir! So unexpected! So direly sudden! So
preposterously&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure!" nodded Ralph. "This new heir, damn him! Yet
here's no reason why the Governor should vent his spleen on
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spleen?" repeated Mr. Jennings, in gently-shocked accents and
writhing graceful reproof. "Ah no, indeed no! Never that. My lord
is never anything but his own superb and stately self&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except when foxed or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Foxed?" Mr. Jennings' delicate eyebrows registered innocent
enquiry. "Foxed, Master Ralph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'Master' Ralph, as if I were a dam'
boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;though I cannot forget you are three years my
junior. But pray what do you mean by&mdash;foxed?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;drunk, then!"</p>

<p>"D-drunk?" fluted Mr. Jennings, recoiling in graceful horror.
"Oh, dearest boy! I really must venture protest, for I cannot hear,
I must not hear such&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dammit, Eustace, you know better than I, how he's taken to
brandy o' late, guzzles it like water&mdash;and when he's been at
it long enough the devil himself couldn't match him for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" piped Mr. Jennings. "Your lordly father may be
all you say&mdash;and even more, but I must not hear you say so, my
dear Ralph, you really must not! For your own sake I
beseech&mdash;ah!" The flute-like voice rose to a sweet, soft
scream.</p>

<p>"What the devil now?" demanded Ralph, starting.</p>

<p>"Blood!" gasped Mr. Jennings, backing away on slim, elegant
feet. "There's blood on you! Oh, how dreadful! And your poor
beautiful face&mdash;now so horrible! So bruised, so battered, so
marred! All, my poor, dearest Ralph, what dire mischance has
befallen you, what oh&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Two dev'lish hard fists, if you must know," answered Ralph,
sullenly. "And this blood ain't all mine, we clinched once or twice
and I tapped his claret pretty well, I'm glad to say. And anyhow
there's no real harm done&mdash;except to my shirt. So I'll go in
and change before tackling the Governor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, you must not! You cannot! Oh Ralph, I dare not wait
upon my lord with such message&mdash;you must to him at once! If he
knows you are home and not instantly in his presence, I dread to
think what may eventuate! For he is in such mood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, a mood, eh? A brandy mood, I'll warrant! He'll be all
mocking devil or ferocious brute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear boy, do pray remember that devil or brute, his
lordship though a lord is also a man and therefore formed in God's
own image! So are you and so am I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed Ralph, contemptuously, "I can't understand how
the Governor puts up with you."</p>

<p>"My dear Ralph, I am happy to assure you that my lord is bound
to me, as I to him with bonds nothing can ever break. Now I suggest
you hurry to him."</p>

<p>"Oh well, if I must, I must!" Saying which, the Hon. Ralph
removed jaunty hat, ran fingers through his luxuriant, jet-black
curls, squared his stalwart shoulders and strode away to the
ancient Manor House which, like all things hereabout, showed signs
of neglect...Reaching a certain gloomy door he gave a perfunctory
tap thereon, opened it, closed it behind him, and thus stood to
front this superb creation and highly-polished gentleman of
quality, his father.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch111" id="ch111"></a>CHAPTER XI. GIVES SOME
DESCRIPTION OF A FATHER, A SON AND ONE OTHER</h3>

<p>Lord Julian Scrope was seated at a writing-table whereon among
other things stood a decanter and glass, together with an open
letter, and it was down at this that his heavy-lidded gaze was
directed; and thus he remained without speech or movement and for
so long that Ralph shuffled nervously, then contrived to jingle a
spur, then recoiled a step, for his father, without raising head,
was looking up at him&mdash;and in those wide, dark eyes a glow he
knew only too well, yet when my lord spoke it was in tone very
pleasantly casual:</p>

<p>"What is your age, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-six, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you are old enough to&mdash;Dear me!" he exclaimed,
gently. "You show bloody as a slaughter-house or the last scene of
Hamlet! You have not been killing anyone, I suppose&mdash;this new
earl, for instance? But no, this would be too much to expect of
you, or hope for! Your tattered and gory person, a repellent
spectacle, is merely evidence of your distressing addiction to
vulgar fisticuffs, of course. In my youth, instead of brutal fists,
a gentleman's weapons were delicate small-sword or
hair-triggers."</p>

<p>"They are yet, sir, if one's honour be involved."</p>

<p>"Are you well in practice with such tools, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Naturally, sir&mdash;though not so much with swords, the
'sharps' are becoming d&eacute;mod&eacute;, but with
'pops'-pistols, sir, these new saw-handles, I'm very
well&mdash;though not so deadly accurate as yourself, of course.
Still, I fancy I could get my man, should honour compel."</p>

<p>"Honour!" repeated Lord Julian. "The little flame that shows off
our gentility, so soon extinguished and therefore to be nurtured so
tenderly and shielded at hazard of our blue blood! Ah
but&mdash;there is that which I esteem even more precious...more
compelling...to be guarded and preserved at all and every cost,
Ralph!"</p>

<p>"And pray what is that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Existence, my son! Freedom to live and do how we will! To be
lords and masters of Circumstance! For this we must dare and
venture all. This is, my son, an axiomatic fact we must
accept."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, though I've no idea just what you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ralph, you are twenty-six, a man, my only son and, to the best
of my belief, the child of my own begetting. Hence, I deem it time
you were better informed and made a little more aware of how we
stand in regard to&mdash;let us still call it Circumstance. You may
sit down&mdash;that chair&mdash;here beside me&mdash;so! Now,"
continued Lord Julian, tapping the open letter upon the table
before him with one long, white finger, "pray, how should you
describe this?"</p>

<p>"A letter, sir, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Your supposition is correct, it is a letter, and yet&mdash;so
much, so very much more! For here, Ralph my son, is our ruin, shame
of beggary, death sudden and sharp or one more lingering&mdash;in a
debtors' prison."</p>

<p>"Oh, but...but, sir," stammered Ralph, "how...how is this? Are
you telling me we are so...so utterly destitute?"</p>

<p>"I am! This house, the furniture, the horses in their stables,
the very clothes on our backs, all can be seized by our
creditor."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;God! Sir, how...how comes this?"</p>

<p>"Ralph, your question is one you should be well able to
answer...Inform him, Eustace."</p>

<p>Thus summoned, Mr. Jennings, who had entered unheard and unseen
by Ralph, now writhed into his sight, piping in melodious
tenor:</p>

<p>"The new Earl, my dear Ralph! Who other could or should possibly
cause your noble Father such harrowing disquietude?"</p>

<p>"But," said Ralph, turning his back on the speaker, "but indeed,
Father, I...I know this house was ours, yes and all the country for
miles around...two or three villages...farms! Then how, how in
God's name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ralph, while your Uncle Japhet and my brother the late Earl
lived&mdash;unmarried, our future was perfectly assured and we
lived as became our station&mdash;though on borrowed money! When
brother Japhet married but&mdash;died so suddenly, I as the natural
and legal heir, anticipated the fact, took old Time by the forelock
and spent largely until, and like thunder-clap, came news
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;yes, sir, yes," cried Ralph, "of course, I remember
now&mdash;this accursed new heir turned up from nowhere and claimed
everything!"</p>

<p>"No, my son&mdash;this heir of whose birth and existence none
had ever heard or even suspected, was deliberately sought for,
diligently enquired after, and&mdash;on the mere, bare possibility
that there might be a child of my brother's hasty marriage! And all
those many months and weeks of ceaseless effort and unremitting
labour were inspired by one whose only aim was and is&mdash;my
injury, and, yes, Ralph, our ruin and utter destruction, yours and
mine!"</p>

<p>"Then curse the fellow! Who...who is he, sir?"</p>

<p>"That lawyer person&mdash;Joliffe. A rat or rather, a mole-like
creature who has burrowed and delved without let or respite
until&mdash;from Heaven knows where, he has unearthed this unknown,
unheard-of young man, proved his legitimacy, claimed and thus
despoiled us of this heritage that, I hold, should be most justly
ours by ties of blood and long tradition. Eh, Eustace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord, yes!" piped Mr. Jennings. "Yes, most
emphatically&mdash;yours by every right, justice and
equity&mdash;or even otherwise! Oh, beyond all possibility of
doubt! For this new-found heir, besides being an absolute stranger
hereabouts, was born all unknown to the Earl his father, which was
an impertinence, by a run-away mother, among strangers and in place
unknown&mdash;which, certainly was most inconsiderate to your noble
father!"</p>

<p>"Egad, sir," cried Ralph, "this all sounds so dev'lish
odd...something might and must be done...can't we fight the
fellow...in the courts...law and so on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," sighed my lord, "we can fight the fellow, we
certainly shall fight the fellow, because we must fight or perish!
But&mdash;not in any court of law. Joliffe has proved young
Japhet's legitimacy beyond all chance of doubt or cavil and is far
too able a lawyer to have left us any smallest loophole&mdash;and
you may be sure I have had the best legal opinion, consulted the
highest authorities. So, today, my son, thanks to Mr. Joliffe, we
are worse than paupers! We stand upon the very brink of
destruction...the abyss of absolute ruin."</p>

<p>"But...but, sir...Father, surely...oh, surely something can be
done, something&mdash;anything to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Four months hence&mdash;and a few odd days, my son, we, you and
I, must to the sordid oblivion of a debtors' prison, without hope
of delivery! Four months hence, we pass out of our world to a
lingering and most discomfortable death. But, Ralph, I do not
intend to die, no indeed! If anyone is to be destroyed, if anyone
must perish as victim of damned Circumstance, it shall not be us!
Eh, Eustace?"</p>

<p>"Ah no, my lord!" fluted Mr. Jennings with agonized writhe, "no,
no a thousand times! The mere thought is horror and smites me to
the heart! He must be found, he must! Oh indeed, indeed he
must&mdash;and induced to nobly sacrifice all for the honour of his
family&mdash;this side of it, of course!"</p>

<p>"He shall be found!" murmured Lord Julian.</p>

<p>"Who?" Ralph demanded.</p>

<p>"Eustace, tell my son. He knows, of course, yet pray inform
him."</p>

<p>"Why then, Master Ralph," whispered Mr. Jennings, writhing so
near that Ralph jerked back his chair, "if you will insist on plain
and brutal fact, whom should my lord mean but
this&mdash;ah&mdash;this detested interloper, your cousin Japhet,
the new Earl of Wrybourne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but where is he?" enquired Ralph, turning to his
father, "where on earth is he, sir?"</p>

<p>"Where?" echoed my lord, gently, yet as he uttered the word, his
long, white, cruel-looking fingers clenched slowly, crumpling the
letter they held. "Where else but in Joliffe's tender care. Thus
much we do know, and shall learn more&mdash;Eustace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, indubitably, my lord, and undoubtedly soon! The man Jupp is
a cunning fellow, a perfect bloodhound of a creature never at fault
for long. Our dear Mr. Joliffe may be astute, he may be
shrewd&mdash;nay even crafty, but&mdash;there are others! Oh yes,
there are others! If Joliffe is a mole, our Jupp is a perfect worm!
Your cousin, Ralph, your cousin Japhet&mdash;this utterly
preposterous heir that could not, should not, and&mdash;must not
be, will, I am happy to know, be run to earth before long!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and&mdash;what then?" enquired Ralph, and turning to ask
this of his father, saw Lord Julian's thin but shapely lips curl to
such smile that he quailed and, glancing from that smiling mouth to
the clutching hand that crumpled the letter so remorselessly, Ralph
turned away and made as if to rise, then checked and sat very still
as my lord said:</p>

<p>"Son Ralph, the Earl your uncle died of a fall from his
horse...some such way must be found for the Earl your cousin."</p>

<p>"Sir, what...what are you...suggesting?"</p>

<p>"I am not suggesting, Ralph, I inform. I would also remind you
of those time-honoured saws, namely: Desperate ills need desperate
remedies, and, Necessity knows&mdash;no law!"</p>

<p>"Good...God!" exclaimed Ralph, in broken whisper, and sank back
as if all strength failed him, while his stately father regarded
him with an aloof though curious interest, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"Eustace, my poor boy shows faint, pray administer water...a sip
of brandy...Ah no, he revives, he is better! Dear me, Ralph, you
appeared about to sink and swoon in manner quite feminine! Ha, yes,
now grit those white teeth of yours, set that dimpled yet masculine
chin&mdash;excellent! Yet it seems that although son of mine, you
are very much the child of your lamented mother."</p>

<p>"Thank God...she's dead!" muttered Ralph.</p>

<p>"Amen!" sighed his father. "For indeed these are days of
desperate ill to be fronted only by men of as desperate and
resolute mind&mdash;and purpose! Men who for that purpose, must,
and will, hazard all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is&mdash;that purpose?" demanded Ralph, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"To live, my son! Ah, yes, to live, honoured of course,
respected&mdash;perhaps, but&mdash;in that pride of estate and
leisured ease the which is ours by right of birth, education and
long ancestry."</p>

<p>"But what...what of the heir who being legally so as you say, is
therefore the rightful inheritor, what of him and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My...dear...boy," drawled his father, "think rather of yourself
and then...of me! Shall we allow Circumstance to shame and then
exterminate us&mdash;for me the twitch of a trigger and
oblivion&mdash;for you the slow rot and slower death of a hopeless
debtors' prison&mdash;shall we? Emphatically no! Instead, my son,
Circumstance itself shall be&mdash;eradicated, and we enjoy, to the
full at last, that lofty station in life to which we were
predestined! And to this vital and most necessary purpose, we
all&mdash;our Eustace included, have our several parts to
play."</p>

<p>"And what is...mine, sir?"</p>

<p>"Marriage, Ralph&mdash;the Hawkins widow, of course!"</p>

<p>"But I detest the woman!"</p>

<p>"Which proves your admirable taste, my son&mdash;for she is
truly a pathetically uncomely creature. But then as all the world
knows, her late spouse endowed her with more than a sufficiency of
worldly goods, the figure is somewhere near a million, eh,
Eustace?"</p>

<p>"More. Oh, far more, my lord, and all of it well
invested&mdash;a vast sum in the funds!"</p>

<p>"Then also, my son, this 'Golden Widow' dotes on you already! At
mere sight of your stalwart form and handsome features, she
flushes, palpitates, and so breathless, poor soul, she can scarce
articulate&mdash;this I have observed for myself and I am never
wrong as regards&mdash;The Sex. And you are quite ridiculously
handsome, my boy, and though so disgustingly bloody&mdash;could she
behold you now she would be ready to swoon with womanly pity or
kiss your bruises for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir, no!" cried Ralph, sitting up and squaring his
shoulders. "You know very well that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you have but to speak, my son, and she will be in your
arms, or you in hers."</p>

<p>"Never, sir! For as you are aware, I am in love with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thus, Ralph, so soon as it is known my son is to espouse the
'Golden Widow', we can defy damned Circumstance, form our plans at
leisure and bide our time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, you...you know I love Cecily Croft&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah yes, the farmer's buxom daughter! Yes, a fine, handsome
creature, Ralph. Well, you may continue to love her as
well&mdash;or better when married to your widow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, sir! You mistake, for, sir, I do most
truly love and respect Cecily, and I'll never wed any
other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fool!" said my lord, and though the word was softly uttered, he
now and for the first time, allowed a frown to crease and trouble
the arrogant placidity of his darkly handsome features.
"Dunderhead! Sentimental dolt! Beggars have no choice! Have you
ever heard of&mdash;Jasper Gaunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I fancy so, a money-lender, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"A...money-lender!" repeated my lord, in tone of weary scorn.
"Eustace, pray describe this lender of money fully yet briefly as
possible&mdash;inform my innocent offspring."</p>

<p>"Oh, my very dear Ralph&mdash;Oh, my dearest boy!" The words
were a piping wail. Mr. Jennings writhed as in acutest agony.
"Jasper Gaunt is the very mammon of all unrighteousness&mdash;a
heartless monster, a merciless bloodsucker whose victims high and
low are everywhere and many in their graves! Suicide is in his
shadow, for whoso falls into his clutches is forever doomed,
yes&mdash;ah, yes&mdash;to a perpetual damnation, never&mdash;Oh,
never more to win free&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Admirably expressed, Eustace! Now, son of mine, pray oblige
your father by hearing this! Have I your attention?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then listen to this that must be the inspiration to our instant
counter action."</p>

<p>So saying, Lord Julian, with leisured, graceful movement of his
well-cared-for hands, smoothed out the crumpled letter and read
aloud:</p>

<blockquote>Kirby Street,<br>
June 1, 1807.<br>
<br>
To LORD JULIAN SCROPE: MY LORD,<br>
<br>
Having lately become possessed of all and every of your many
liabilities, accounts long over due, I beg to give notice they must
be met and liquidated in toto. June the 30th proximo being the
extremest limit of time that can be allowed.<br>
<br>
I am, my lord, your lordship's most faithful<br>
<br>
JASPER GAUNT.</blockquote>

<p>"So, my son, here is our sentence of ruin and damnation! Eh,
Eustace?"</p>

<p>"Beyond all doubting, my lord, ruin in this life and damnation
hereafter&mdash;as you so truly say."</p>

<p>"Someday," sighed my lord, laying down the letter, "yes, someday
Mr. Jasper Gaunt will be...very properly...murdered, and would I
might be there to see. A foolish wish, of course, yet extremely
natural! However, there is the compelling fact, my son&mdash;unless
you wed your 'Golden Widow' and we...achieve our Heritage of
Wrybourne, you and I&mdash;and Eustace of course&mdash;our course
is run!"</p>

<p>Up starting from his chair, Ralph crossed unsteadily to the
door, but there his father's commanding voice and gesture stayed
him:</p>

<p>"Where away, my boy?"</p>

<p>And speaking the words between hard-shut teeth, Ralph
answered:</p>

<p>"To Cecily!"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" murmured his lordship, smiling at his son's drooping,
disconsolate figure, "wisely chosen! Thus shall we make
Circumstance a stepping-stone&mdash;up and back to our so rightful
place. Adieu and God bless you, my son."</p>

<h3><a name="ch112" id="ch112"></a>CHAPTER XII. TELLS, WITH
ADMIRABLE BREVITY, HOW UNCLE AND NEPHEW MET</h3>

<p>Willowmead, small for a farm yet very much too large for a
cottage, lay drowsing in the afternoon heat; birds chirped sleepily
beneath the deep-thatched eaves, the roomy old house was hushed
save for distant voices where Nancy and her four maids were busied
in kitchen and dairy, for Katherine and her Ned had driven away in
the gig on a shopping expedition, while Sam, seated by the open
window, was writing this letter:</p>

<blockquote>Willowmead,<br>
Sussex,<br>
June 8, 1807.<br>
<br>
To E. Joliffe, Esqr.<br>
<br>
SIR AND DEAR BEN,<br>
<br>
This being a strictly business letter written to a friend in spirit
of friendship, I am, Sir, trying, my dear Ben, to combine the two.
And first to business. You, Sir, being agent for the Wrybourne
Estates, I therefore and herewith give you notice that I desire to
sell the farm known as Willowmead, and all appertaining thereto
from trucks to keelson, lock, stock and barrel, and at as
reasonably low a price as possible, because the purchaser will be
my friend and shipmate, Captain Edward Harlow. So much for
business, Mr. Joliffe, sir. But now, Ben, you must know there is a
marriage in the offing between friend Ned and a very beautiful lady
Mistress Katherine Ford&mdash;wherefore I want your advice as to
some gift, a wedding present worthy such a pair. Here I revert
again to business&mdash;re the Scropes, father and son. The more I
hear of them, the more your estimate of them is proved correct.
Cousin Ralph I have met in a regular set to with naked mauleys and
though a pretty fancy performer he could not last and I finished
him with a right hand leveller that knocked him completely out of
time, to my satisfaction and yours too, I hope, Ben, when I tell
you he is totally unaware he was floored by his cousin. Lord Julian
I have not seen as yet though I have heard enough, as for instance
that he casts a goatish eye on a certain lady Miss Katherine
herself no less, and Ned when properly roused is such very terrible
fellow that my present care is to keep him in ignorance and thus
prevent him from taking action. So I mean to keep it in "the
family" should violence become unavoidable, and if so my lord
Julian shall know and experience me only as a rough tween-decks
tar, free of speech and fist as British mariner usually is. And
here I come to a question I have thought over a great deal lately,
this Ben&mdash;I feel myself to be little better than a dam'
intruder in this Wrybourne Heritage so would it not be more just
and better for all concerned if I should divide the estates with
these Scropes father and son to save them from the disaster you
mentioned? Lord knows here is more money etc. than I can ever use
or want. How say you, Ben? Or, as per business&mdash;Sir, I desire
your considered opinion, legal and human, on this matter. As for
me, friend Ben, here am I in snug berth and sweetly peaceful haven,
this dear old farmhouse set amid beautiful country the more so
because from the home meadow I can glimpse and smell the sea. Truly
a lovely land is Sussex and breeds lovely folk. I have already
acquired a sweet, small niece named Jane and a somewhat formidable
though gentle-hearted Granny, and as for Ned's Katherine, words
fail me. And here glancing over what I have written it seems there
are words too many, especially for such busy man of law and weaver
of webs as yourself. So here I end, dear Ben, Yours in friendship
most sincerely,<br>
<br>
SAM.</blockquote>

<p>Sam was reaching for the sand-box to dust and dry his flourished
signature when he became aware of approaching footsteps upon the
flagged path outside, and knowing that whoever came must pass this
window to reach the front door, he listened and waited
expectant...</p>

<p>Footsteps slow and deliberate; assured feet these (thought Sam)
that trod with such irritating deliberation, pausing now and then
as if their owner had stayed to look around him or listen for some
expected or familiar sound, then came on again more slowly,
planting themselves masterfully and with small, soft jingle of
spurred heels.</p>

<p>Sam put down the sand-shaker and leaned forward as into his line
of vision strolled a tall, stately personage whose every garment
was a work of art and worn with a languid grace; the
elegantly-booted feet halted, and Sam, knowing at once and
instinctively who this dominating person must be, spoke in gruffest
and most offensive challenge:</p>

<p>"Belay there! If your name's Lord Scrope bear up and tack
about&mdash;smartly now!"</p>

<p>My lord Julian, used to and expectant of that somewhat slavish
deference ever accorded to his dignity and rank, especially in his
own county, opened his eyes rather wider than usual while the hand
grasping his heavy riding-whip, gripped and half-raised it in
sudden, instinctive menace, yet his voice was pleasingly modulated
when he troubled to speak:</p>

<p>"Drunk, of course...and so early in the day! However, if your
legs will serve you so far, you may go and inform Mistress Kate
that Lord Julian Scrope desires her presence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Avast!" growled Sam, leaning out from the window with
threatening gesture, "drunk I mebbe, and then again mebbe I ain't.
'Owsever, I'm sober enough to know dirt when I sees it, ay and a
land-shark afore I'm bit. As for the lady you mentions so free, I'm
warning ye as she's agoin' to be spliced to my Cap'n. So, m'lud,
you clap your desires under hatches or heave 'em overboard and
sheer off."</p>

<p>"Ah?" murmured his lordship never stirring and surveying Sam's
scowling visage feature by feature. "You are not so drunk as I
deemed, no&mdash;you are endeavouring to be insolent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord," snarled Sam, leaning farther out of the window and
looking his grimmest, "I'm tellin' ye to sheer off and give
Willermead a wide berth from now on! I'm likewise warnin' ye as
there be summat yereabouts as ain't 'ealthy for your sort and
that's me! And what's more, I'm sayin' as 'ow if ye don't tack
about and show me your starn right smart, I know a cove as'll take
and heave ye out into the lane yonder, and that's me again."</p>

<p>With languid gesture Lord Julian lifted the quizzing-glass that
dangled on broad ribbon upon his breast and peering through it at
Sam, murmured as if to himself:</p>

<p>"A sailor by his looks...and if not drunk, he is perhaps a
little mad...a touch of the sun...or that ugly scar...a recent
wound, I fancy. However, an extremely obnoxious fellow I am quite
sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do ye go?" demanded Sam, making to climb out through the
window. "D'ye march on y'r own legs or do I heave ye out into
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>My lord's seeming languor changed to instant and ferocious
action, the heavy riding-crop whizzed&mdash;a blow so sudden, so
vicious and truly aimed that Sam, smitten upon his scarcely-healed
wound, dropped to his knees and for a moment remained thus, dazed
and half-blinded by gush of blood; then somehow, anyhow, he was up
and out of the window&mdash;to be met by another blow as calmly and
truly aimed, but as he fell this second time, his long arm shot out
instinctively, his fingers grasped slim riding-boot&mdash;jerked,
twisted, and my lord went down backwards, to lie half stunned. Then
Sam arose and grasping Lord Julian by the collar, dragged him along
the path, out through the gate and so into that shady lane where a
splendid horse stood tethered.</p>

<p>"So...there y'are, lord!" panted Sam, wiping blood from his
eyes. "I've spattered ye a bit wi' my good blood...Y'r coat's tore,
and you ain't s' dam' dignified as you was...So this'll do...till
next time. But if y'ever do venture back 'ere to Willermead wi' y'r
desires and that like, it'll be worse for ye, lord&mdash;ay, ay
it'll be one on us...or both...for good and all!"</p>

<h3><a name="ch113" id="ch113"></a>CHAPTER XIII. TELLS HOW AUNT
DEBORAH MINISTERED</h3>

<p>Housewards went Sam but being much shaken and in no little pain,
turned aside where stood a rustic seat, and sinking there made some
attempt to staunch his bleeding while he waited for the sick
faintness to pass. And it was now that a gentle, cooing voice came
to him:</p>

<p>"Oh, paladin! Are you Roland, Oliver or Saint George for Merrie
England? The Dragon has gone, thank heaven&mdash;and you, of
course! But, oh, did you&mdash;do you know who he really
is&mdash;do you?" Glancing up, Sam beheld a small, gracious lady
whose coquettish plumed bonnet framed a small, pretty face and
smooth and unwrinkled though remorseless Time or Circumstance had
turned her ringlets of glossy hair to shining silver.</p>

<p>"Oh, my gracious!" she exclaimed, clasping small, mittened
hands, "he's all blood...wounded and going to swoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not I, marm, no I'll just...close my eyes 'gainst the
sun-glare..." And, sinking back, Sam lay upon the border of
unconsciousness until roused by a blessed refreshment, he opened
swimming eyes to find the lady sponging his wound with hand very
deft and light, cooing murmurously as she did so:</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious me! A ghastly gash&mdash;most murderous. The
villain! Do I hurt you&mdash;do I?"</p>

<p>"No, marm, there's healing in your touch."</p>

<p>"My word! What a courtly mariner&mdash;such very gallant
jack-tar! Are you able to walk now, out of this hot sun, can
you?"</p>

<p>"Why of course," answered Sam and rising too hastily, staggered
and would have sunk down again but that she propped and stayed him,
saying in most determined manner:</p>

<p>"No, no! I must get you out of this heat...there now, lean on
me, lean I say, this moment! Though not over-large I'm prodigiously
powerful&mdash;for my size. Yes, that's it...your arm over my
shoulder&mdash;now walk, slowly&mdash;be careful!" With rueful and
shaky laugh Sam obeyed and thus she brought him into the fragrant
coolness of the spacious kitchen.</p>

<p>"On the settle!" she commanded. "Full length! This cushion under
your poor head&mdash;so! Now while I comfort and cherish your
ghastly wounds, my bold Dragon-dragger, if you can talk&mdash;talk
and tell me why you did it and if you know who our terrible Dragon
really is. Do you know and did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, he called himself Lord Julian Scrope."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;so he is! And you dared! You actually dragged
him&mdash;like a sack of something very nasty, which he truly is,
of course&mdash;and you hauled him away by his lordly collar, his
stately limbs sprawling! Oh sweet, sweet spectacle! Ah, what
grandly brave, heroically bold defenders our gallant stalwart
sailors are&mdash;for you are a sailor, of course?"</p>

<p>"At your service, marm."</p>

<p>"No, no, I am at yours, with this sponge and on my knees too!
And while I am, let me tell you of our Dragon&mdash;that stately
Wickedness! If you only knew how we have feared and dreaded
him&mdash;his politely persistent, pernicious
persecution&mdash;there's alliteration for you! His lofty arrogance
and the determined evil of him! Kate's horrified loathing of
him&mdash;Kate's my niece and a beauty&mdash;and my anxiety for
her! He so serenely, hatefully assured and masterful and we so
helpless! With no man to our protection! But now, ah now&mdash;to
have seen him felled in his sinful pride and dragged away and
kicking and helpless&mdash;Oh glory! So now Paladin, my heroic and
hardy sailor-man, this night you shall be in my prayers, so how
shall I name you?"</p>

<p>"Sam," he answered, glancing up at her rather shyly over the
sponge, "Sam Felton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, then you must be&mdash;you are&mdash;Captain Ned's friend,
he has often mentioned you&mdash;his first officer."</p>

<p>"And you, marm, at a guess, are Aunt Deborah."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I am. Now lift your head that I may set this
bandage."</p>

<p>"Is that needful, marm? I'm hoping the others won't notice
anything of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is, and they will!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't it be hidden under my hair, marm?"</p>

<p>"It could&mdash;not! Good gracious no! It is quite a bad
wound&mdash;the cruel monster must have struck you terribly
hard&mdash;Oh, quite murderously!"</p>

<p>"He happened to strike where I rammed my head against something
a lot harder a while since at sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, just what, pray?"</p>

<p>"A French musket-butt, or some such, marm."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;in a battle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm. But what's bothering me is this, d'ye see, I don't
want anyone, especially Ned, to know how I got this&mdash;no, nor
anything about Lord Julian Scrope."</p>

<p>"Because you think there would be more trouble betwixt him and
the Dragon?"</p>

<p>"Marm, if Ned ever knew this lord had ever tried to...molest his
Kate, t'would mean sure death for one or other of them. So, marm,
d'ye see, I want to keep, yes, b'George, I must keep this business
strictly between our two selves and if I must wear this bandage we
must think of some other way to account for it. But the question is
how and what, marm?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly simple!" said she, securing the bandage in question
and bestowing a soft pat on his curly head, "and in place of
'marm-ing' me so very persistently, don't you think I should sound
a great deal better as 'Aunt Deborah' or even 'Deb'?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," he answered, heartily, "yes, marm!"</p>

<p>"Well, nephew Sam, say it&mdash;this moment, sir."</p>

<p>"Then pray, Aunt Deborah, will you show me how to account for
this bandage."</p>

<p>"Can you walk without tottering or tumbling?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I can."</p>

<p>"Come then," said she, and leading him across this wide kitchen
to a tall dresser stored with crockery, pointed to a large dish on
lofty shelf, saying:</p>

<p>"Tall nephew, reach that down for me. Now bring it to the
fireplace. Now&mdash;drop it."</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Deb, 'twill surely break."</p>

<p>"Of course it will, so&mdash;drop it!" Sam obeyed and the dish
splintered upon the hearth-stone. "Well, nephew, there is your
explanation, you see&mdash;or don't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't," said Sam, rubbing his chin perplexedly,
"unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Return to the settle, nephew Sam, sit&mdash;no, lie down again
and while I sweep up these fragments I will explain&mdash;are you
listening?"</p>

<p>"I am indeed."</p>

<p>"Then," said she, busied with the broom, and quite gracefully,
"what happened was this: I asked you to reach me the dish, which
you did, so that's true. You dropped it&mdash;so that's true again!
The nasty thing struck you upon your poor, wounded brow&mdash;which
it did not, but there is the explanation of your hurt, two truths
and only one very small, perfectly white fib. Does that meet the
case?"</p>

<p>"It does and very cleverly."</p>

<p>"Then, nephew, express your thanks."</p>

<p>"Aunt Deborah, I am very truly grateful."</p>

<p>"And now being such a very sailorly mariner you'll be yearning
for rum or grog in a noggin? But no, spirits would only heat your
wound, you shall drink tea and so will I. And we will toast the
muffins I brought and soak them with butter. So if you will take
the bellows and blow up the fire, I'll put on the kettle and brew
tea; real Soochong that never paid a farthing duty, this is Sussex
remember&mdash;dear, naughty, lovely old Sussex by the sea."</p>

<h3><a name="ch114" id="ch114"></a>CHAPTER XIV. GIVES SOME
DESCRIPTION OF THE GREAT HOUSE OF WRYBOURNE FEVERIL</h3>

<p>It was in the radiant sunshine of an early afternoon that Sam
for the first time beheld the Great House, this "seat of his
nobility," Wrybourne Feveril.</p>

<p>"Pull up!" said Mrs. Leet, sitting beside him in Kate's gig
borrowed for the occasion, "I always think this the best of all the
distant views, so pull up, Sam, stop, or perhaps I should say 'back
your tops'ls and heave to.' There!" sighed she, with wide-armed
sweep of mittened hand, "there's stateliness for you! There's glory
of stone, tile and brick, ay and carved oak besides! There's true
beauty framed in a grandeur mellowed by Time...reaching back and
back through the ages, for they say the foundations are Roman. And
there are two Norman towers, the rest is early Tudor. Yes, there is
the Great House, Sam, a home for kings, and indeed kings and queens
have slept there&mdash;ah yes and villains too! For the Scropes are
a breed unworthy such great and noble heritage! Well, what d'you
think of it?"</p>

<p>"Vast!" he replied. "Too hugely big for comfort and impossible
as a home."</p>

<p>"Fiddle-de-dee and nonsense, Sam! Folk have lived there since
the dim ages. According to tradition it was first a Roman fortress,
then a Saxon stronghold, next a Norman castle, then a noble
mansion, and now&mdash;well&mdash;the stately glory you
behold."</p>

<p>"However," quoth Sam, shaking his bandaged head (though gently)
"it's not my idea of homely comfort, nothing cosy or home-y about
it, Grannyanne."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there is!" she retorted vehemently, "I mean&mdash;there
are all sorts and kinds of cosy nooks and corners, with lovely
home-y rooms too besides the big state apartments, the huge hall
and galleries. The Great House has everything to suit all tastes
and moods. Ah yes, Wrybourne Feveril is a place of wonders! Drive
on and I'll show you&mdash;some, at least. Heave ahead, Sam."</p>

<p>So he touched up Jabez, the sleekly powerful horse, and away
they sped across richly-wooded, undulating park where graceful deer
stood to watch them gentle-eyed; ah, but the great house itself was
watching them and very differently (or so thought Sam). This huge
thing of carved wood, grey stone and ruddy brick which persisting
through the ages must therefore know so much of living and dying,
so little of good, so much of evil, yet proud and arrogant
ever&mdash;which even now was glaring down on him with all its many
latticed windows so haughtily that Sam instantly scowled in return
as he watched this home of his hateful ancestry grow upon his
sight. Nearer and nearer it rose and spread before and above him,
lofty gable and twisted chimney, soaring tower, battlement and
turret, chilling him with its sheer immensity.</p>

<p>"Sam," demanded Mrs. Leet, "why d'you frown so?"</p>

<p>"Because, Grannyanne, your Great House is too much so."</p>

<p>"Too much what, pray?"</p>

<p>"Great and&mdash;splendid. Aha, and yonder in the splendid
doorway of all this magnificence is a person, no&mdash;a person-age
as stately as the place itself."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Mrs. Leet, waving a hand to this imposing
creature, "that is no more than Henry James Perkins the butler,
though he was merely the fifth footman in my time."</p>

<p>"However, he's all butler now!" quoth Sam, as the personage
wafted airily in response. "Such awesome dignity, Grannyanne!"</p>

<p>"He always was, even as a footman and it's grown on him, it
seems. Well, Perkins," she called as the gig came to a standstill,
"you look as well as I feel. The years have been kind to us,
James."</p>

<p>Mr. Perkins descended the broad, marble steps with dignity as a
butler should, then bowed as few butlers could, for he did it with
a certain restrained majesty of look and gesture, and when he spoke
it was in throaty voice schooled to chaste and genteel murmur:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Leet, pray be welcome! And as to looks, indeed you bloom,
marm, you bloom. Allow me to assist you to terrier firmer,
marm."</p>

<p>"Thankee, James," said she, performing this somewhat intricate
manoeuvre with surprising agility, which done, she enquired, "Now,
James, what of the horse and gig?"</p>

<p>From the snowy frills at his bosom Mr. Perkins extracted a large
silver whistle attached to him by broad, black ribbon and blew a
mellow though resounding note, in answer to which call presently
appeared a footman ornate as to livery and large as to ears,
shoulders and calves, to whom, with dignified gesture towards the
vehicle, Mr. Perkins issued the command:</p>

<p>"To the stables, William, grooms. Begone!"</p>

<p>"Sam," said Mrs. Leet, as William led horse and trap away, "Mr.
Perkins! James, here is my grandson&mdash;by adoption, Mr.
Felton."</p>

<p>"Honoured, sir!" quoth the butler, performing his bow again.
"Any friend or relation of Mrs. Leet is persony greater with
myself! For Mrs. L. marm, to us of the&mdash;ahem&mdash;old reggime
you were, are and ever will be part and, as it were, parcel, marm,
of this 'the Great House,' the time-honoured faybrick called
Wrybourne Feveril, this most truly historic and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thankee, James! So now since there's so much I want my grandson
to see here, let's begin."</p>

<p>"So be it, marm. Though first may I venture to enquire if you
can tell or inform me aught of our new lord whose present
whereabouts, like himself, is a profound mystery and hence a source
of carking anxiety to boot. So if you have the least scrap or
tittle of news&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, James. All I know is that he has been resident abroad,
hobnobbing with foreigners&mdash;Lord frustrate their knavish
tricks&mdash;and therefore will be full of foreign fads and
faddles, all shrugs and scrapes and will probably speak broken
English!"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is sad news, marm, heavy tidings and highly woeful to
contemplate. Yet, even so, our new Lord can hardly be
more&mdash;ahem&mdash;more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Villainous, James?"</p>

<p>"Marm, I was about to say 'trying'."</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure, James, he was ever trying and succeeding in
some devilry or other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A-ham!" quoth Mr. Perkins, and led the way (almost hastily)
into the great echoing hall dim lit by small narrow windows set
high in ancient walls hung with pennons and banderols dingy and
faded by Time, yet bright with glittering array of antique weapons,
while ranked below stood effigies in burnished armour of different
periods.</p>

<p>"Ha-hum!" quoth Mr. Perkins again. "I observe you are interested
in our armour, Mr. Felton."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Sam, "you keep 'em very bright."</p>

<p>"We do, sir, we do. I have them all dooly and reverentially
cared for, since each helped, as it were, to erect and maintain the
glory of this do-main of Wrybourne Feveril. Fif-teen suits, sir,
cap'a pee! Here you behold the pan-o-plee wore by Sir Amyot at
Agincourt&mdash;the next Sir John Scrope used at Cressy, he was
boon companion to Sir Walter Manny and Sir John Chandos and was
honoured by King Edward himself...helm and breastplate bear marks
of combative violence you'll pray notice...And so on through the
ages, sir, to that mag-nificent soot that adorned the person of Sir
James Scrope at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, sir, then yonder we
have the splendid harness worn by Sir Japhet Scrope at Naseby,
Newberry, Marston Moor and other fee-rocious encounters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well now," said Mrs. Leet, "now, James, we'll to the galleries,
and there, Sam, you shall see pictures of the wearers. Give me your
arm."</p>

<p>Through echoing chambers cold and stately she led him, through
rooms snug and cosily furnished, along deeply-carpeted,
richly-panelled corridors, and so to a vast gallery, its splendour
of carved woodwork and painted ceiling lighted by many long windows
that showed row upon row of portraits, noble lords and gracious
dames who scowled, smiled, simpered or merely stared from
backgrounds dim or glowing; bearded and shaven ferocities in heavy
armour, gloomy gentlemen in ruffs, gallants who smirked or gazed,
pensively passionate, between curled lovelocks and&mdash;a
grim-faced nobleman in black half-armour who leaned negligently
upon a large cannon with a distant though furious sea-battle in
progress just above his right shoulder. Now before this portrait
Mrs. Leet halted suddenly, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Ha! Yes, of course, now I remember! Sam, look at this one!
Well, what do you say?"</p>

<p>"That he's no beauty, Grannyanne, and by the ships a seaman, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"He was indeed!" quoth Mr. Perkins. "Sir, you behold the
likeness of my Lord Japhet Scrope, Vice Admiral of the Blue,
wounded in the three days' battle with the Dutch off Beachy Head.
He was also, you will notice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, James," said Mrs. Leet, "but what else do you
notice?"</p>

<p>"I notice, Mrs. Anne, marm, no more than I have beheld hundreds
of times when showing visitors around and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you, Sam, what do you notice?"</p>

<p>"That he looks a pretty grim sort of customer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So do you, Sam, when you scowl as he has been doing all these
years! James, don't you see the strange likeness? Look, man, here
and there!"</p>

<p>"Ah-ham!" exclaimed Mr. Perkins, glancing from Sam to the
portrait and back again. "Ye-e-s," he admitted, "I do remark a
vague, a faintish seemularity, Mrs. Anne."</p>

<p>"Vague, d'you say, James? Put Sam in that same black armour,
it's out there in the hall, and they would be as like as two
peas!"</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam. "If I'm really like that old cut-throat I
hope I'm better than I show."</p>

<p>"Sam, the Admiral was a very brave gentleman and one of the few
good ones&mdash;for a Scrope!"</p>

<p>"In-deed yes!" quoth Mr. Perkins. "The Admiral restored the old
Norman chapel and built the public almshouses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what of this lady?" enquired Sam, turning towards a
portrait that seemed mostly eyes, ringlets and bosom.</p>

<p>"The Lady Araminta&mdash;a baggage, Sam! A bold, heartless
vixen! The less said of her the better."</p>

<p>"Ah, but," added Mr. Perkins, "a famous beauty and toast, Mrs.
Anne! Gentlemen fought doo-els very frequently on her
account&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More fools they, James!"</p>

<p>"But, oh ponder, marm, consider the wicked age she lived in,
Mrs. Anne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She did her best to make it worse, James! And now the
tapestries; they are truly famous, Sam, though their subjects, one
or two, are inclined to be a little so-so. And thereafter, James,
tea if you please in Queen Elizabeth's small parlour."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Anne, I was myself about to suggest same. I go, proceeding
this moment to order it."</p>

<p>And away past these rows of long-dead Scropes paced Mr. Perkins,
himself more imposing than any of them.</p>

<p>"Strange!" exclaimed Mrs. Leet, glancing back towards the
pictured Admiral. "Among all the many hundreds of visitors I have
shown through these galleries in my time, I have never known it
happen before. Never did anyone of them resemble in the slightest
degree any of these pictured Scropes. And now...today...at
last...you, Sam, and the Admiral! And he was a sailorman, too!
Don't you think it strange and surprising?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, Granny, for if you go on comparing faces long enough,
you'll be sure to find someone like somebody else some time or
other, it stands to reason."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;yes, perhaps...and yet, Sam, he was a sailor,
too."</p>

<p>"Yet looks more like a pirate, Granny! But tell me, did Queen
Elizabeth really stay here?"</p>

<p>"To be sure she did, and frequently. You shall see the bed she
slept in, the goblet she drank from&mdash;ale, Sam, and quite a
large goblet! I'll show you the fine embroidered shoes she wore and
silk stockings out of Spain, great rarities in those days. Then
there's a bow she used for shooting deer, poor things&mdash;the
glove she gave Sir Julian who wore it on his helmet at a
tournament. Oh, there are lots more glories and wonders for you to
behold, Sam!"</p>

<p>"And yet, if you please, Grannyanne, I would much rather see the
room that was your own, I mean that one where you once hove
fire-irons at a lordly brutish villain."</p>

<p>"Then of course you shall, Sam, 'tis much the same now as it was
then, not very splendid&mdash;but you can see the very marks upon
the door and panelling...Ah, but thank goodness&mdash;yonder comes
our pompous James to say tea awaits us!" <b>*</b></p>

<p>"Well," sighed Mrs. Leet, as they turned into the leafy, home
lane, "thank you for the drive, Sam, it has done me a power o'
good."</p>

<p>"And thank you, Granny, for showing me the wonders of Wrybourne
Feveril."</p>

<p>"Ay, the Great House!" she sighed. "A rare treasure-house, a
jewel of antiquity that has grown with and is part of this Old
England of ours...How should you like to live there, Sam?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't!" he answered, frowning.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she exclaimed, glancing up at him with her shrewd, old
eyes. "Yes, it is odd how strangely you resemble my lord the
Admiral when you scowl, Sam. And he was one of the good ones!"</p>

<p>"And that is truly much more odd, Granny, for the Scropes, past
and present, run to pretty foul villainy of all sorts and
kinds."</p>

<p>"Still, there have been good ones, a few, here and there, Sam,
they happened every fifty years or so. Maybe this new Earl will
turn out a good one, by some happy chance. I'm hoping so with all
my heart, for a very particular reason."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam. "Pray why?"</p>

<p>"Because a good Earl might be induced to grant our Kate and Ned
their own hearts' desire and allow them to buy the freehold of
Willowmead! And besides," she continued, seeing Sam lost in silent
contemplation of the long, winding lane before them, "he might even
be persuaded to allow my cottage roof to be mended&mdash;it leaks
shamefully. I've a great idea of writing Mr. Joliffe direct about
it."</p>

<p>"Oh?" enquired Sam. "Ah, so you know of Mr. Joliffe?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course! I've writ him many a letter on business of the
Great House, and many's the cup o' tea he's drank with me in my
sitting-room there. Mr. Joliffe has been lawyer to the family all
his life, like his father before him, he and I are old
friends...Oh, but you're driving past my cottage!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Granny, I am. According to orders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whose, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"Kate's. For d'ye see, I was commanded to bring you back to
supper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Sam, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuffed breast o' veal, Granny! Not to mention such oddments
as&mdash;a vast, cold ham, beef roast&mdash;cold, and beef
boiled&mdash;spiced! Also Ned will brew grog, though he calls it
'punch,' for you specially, Grannyanne, to hearten you after this
long drive. And orders being orders, d'ye see&mdash;here we are!"
So saying he pulled up in the farm-yard fragrant and spicy with
scent of ricks and stables, where presently came Ned and Kate to
welcome them.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch115" id="ch115"></a>CHAPTER XV. DESCRIBES CERTAIN
WILLOWMEAD FOLK</h3>

<p>It was a glad, golden morning and Sam, wandering into the cool,
trim dairy, paused to marvel at the swift dexterity of Nancy, this
buxom, though ineffably demure creature, skimming rich, yellow
cream from wide pans of milk; then turned to watch Kate, in apron
and print gown, her lovely round arms bare, performing that
everyday miracle&mdash;the making of yellow, luscious butter. In
the midst of this homely occupation she glanced up at his gravely
intent face and enquired:</p>

<p>"Have you never seen butter made before, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Never. And now that I do, I'm wondering how it happens and
why."</p>

<p>"I'm wondering too," she sighed. "I could scarcely sleep last
night for wondering!"</p>

<p>"Not about butter, of course, Kate?"</p>

<p>"No, about Ned...travelling all that great way to London...and
the roads so unsafe! The Mail was stopped only last week by
highwaymen and the guard wounded, poor man!"</p>

<p>"Ay, but Ned is Ned and safe in London by now, I'll
warrant."</p>

<p>"Dear Sam!" she murmured. "What a comfort you are! But if he is
there safe, I'm wondering if he has seen Mr. Joliffe, the lawyer,
yet. And if he has I'm wondering still...Oh, Sam, how I'm wondering
what the outcome will be."</p>

<p>"The best, Kate, depend on 't. Ned deserves the very best of
life if ever a man did, for he's earned it, also he has been mighty
fortunate, seeing he has you."</p>

<p>"'Deed yes, Sam, to be sure he has me for ever, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And b'Jingo, Kate, you're a prize rich enough to content any
man breathing."</p>

<p>"But I'm not rich, Sam, I can hardly make the farm pay and
should have failed long ago but for my good Ben Toop and his dear
old father. I'm quite poor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, but rich in all that makes a woman lovely and that's the
only riches worth having."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;Sam! You'll make me blush! Such compliments
and&mdash;from you!"</p>

<p>"Not compliments, Kate, I can't manage 'em, being no lady's man,
d'ye see, I speak straight forrard and mean what I say, every word.
And what I'm meaning now is&mdash;that when Ned takes such prize as
you and tows her safely into the Harbour of Matrimony he is far
richer than those Maya folk in South America, Aztec and Inca, who
mined and used gold by the ton as we do iron. So, although
personally I keep well to windward of wedlock, I'm saying that,
blow foul or fair, Ned is mighty fortunate to have you
alongside..." At this moment the grandfather clock that had ticked
on the wide old stair time out of mind, uttered its mellow
chime.</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock!" sighed Kate. "At this very moment Ned should
be with lawyer Joliffe! He will have asked if we can buy
Willowmead...not that I dare suppose it possible...but...if he only
could...Oh, Sam, the thought almost...chokes me with joy...but it
seems too wonderful ever to come true."</p>

<p>"I don't see why, Kate."</p>

<p>"Then...Oh, Sam, do you think there is the least possible
chance, do you?"</p>

<p>"I can't see why not."</p>

<p>"But the Earls of Wrybourne are all so terribly rich. The old
lord would never part with an acre to anyone and this new lord may
be the same."</p>

<p>"Too true!" nodded Sam. "And yet again he may not. No, he may be
an altogether different sort of fellow, in fact I believe he
is."</p>

<p>"Do you, Sam, do you? Oh, if he only is! But what makes you
believe so?"</p>

<p>"Why, Kate, d'ye see, it so happens," answered Sam, cautiously,
"I've heard that he's been, well, knocking about the world, hither
and yon, the seven seas, port to port, and consequently seen so
much of the world in general that this particular bit of it may not
seem so almighty precious to him as it was to his hoggish
ancestors. It stands to reason."</p>

<p>"Does it?" she questioned wistfully, lovely head drooping. "I
wish I could be as certain of this as you seem to be&mdash;why are
you so sure, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Lord knows!" he answered, avoiding her glance. "Of course,
there's few things sure or certain in this world, Kate, yet I
believe in looking on the bright side...hoping for the best
and&mdash;well&mdash;while there's life there's hope, d'ye
see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam, I'm hoping now and praying, in thought, that you may
be right."</p>

<p>"Good!" he nodded. "Then you may depend upon it that I am right.
So smile, Kate, God bless you, smile! Ah, good again! Now I'll bear
away for the orchard to smoke a pipe or so and listen to the birds,
I never heard them sing as they do here at Willowmead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, Sam! Before you go do please tell me all you know or have
ever heard about our new lord. Have you in all your wanderings ever
met him or seen him perhaps&mdash;Oh, have you?"</p>

<p>Sam turned to gaze out through open doorway across the sunny
garden, saying after momentary hesitation:</p>

<p>"Now God love you, Kate, how should I? Earls and lords don't
usually ship aboard whalers or privateers or join company with
seafaring men the like o' me, it goes without saying...stands to
reason, Kate, d'ye see?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, of course!" she sighed, "I was only...hoping and
wondering again."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, that's the word&mdash;hope! Hope hard, Kate, so will I
and who knows but our wish may come safe to harbour all a-tauto
alow and aloft." So saying, he smiled and stepped out into the
sunshine. Now on his way to the orchard he met a man, a stalwart,
blue-eyed, comely fellow (though just at present grimly woeful of
aspect) and busily sharpening a scythe with a certain neat deftness
of movement that Sam was quick to heed.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said he, pausing. "You are Tom, I think?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir. Tom Toop, at your service."</p>

<p>"And you've been a sailor, Tom."</p>

<p>"Lor-dee, sir, 'ow should ye know that?"</p>

<p>"By your smart and general handiness, Tom. Royal Navy, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yessir, afore I larned enough to quit."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me the sea didn't agree with you."</p>

<p>"'Twern't the sea, sir, 'twere my brother Willum as got took off
by a cross-bar-shot alongside o' me just arter Lord Nelson were
struck down."</p>

<p>"Ah, so you saw, you were there, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, sarving a quarter-deck starboard carronade. Poor Will
were beyond speech, him being nigh cut in two&mdash;but says Lord
Nelson as Cap'n Hardy stooped to lift him, 'They've done for me
this time, at last,' says he. Well, sir, there was brother Willum
and Lord Nelson done for, so when us <i>Victory</i> men got paid
off, I bore away for home soundings and yere I've been ever since.
Ye see, sir, there was a right tidy lass yereabouts and waiting for
one or t'other on us, though which she favoured Willum and me never
could nowise decide. So arter he was took off, I bore down, laid
her alongside&mdash;but&mdash;" here Tom sighed deeply, his cheery
visage glooming, "only to larn as t'were poor Willum as she
favoured arter all!"</p>

<p>"Dam' hard luck, Tom. And you say she lives hereabouts?"</p>

<p>"She do, sir. And she be in dairy at this yere instant."</p>

<p>"Eh? You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nancy, sir."</p>

<p>"And a tight, handsome craft she is, Tom."</p>

<p>"Ay, no question, sir, though she ain't&mdash;complete."</p>

<p>"Eh? Not&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, can't nowise be, seeing as how."</p>

<p>"As how what, Tom?"</p>

<p>"As how part of her be missing, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Sam, pondering this. "Ah? What, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Her heart, sir, 'tis laying fathoms deep along o' poor
Will."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you so?"</p>

<p>"Constant, sir."</p>

<p>"Ha!" murmured Sam. "Well, what d'you think?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I dunno what, so 'Id be obleeged for your opinion."</p>

<p>"Then I'm pretty sure her heart is in the right and proper place
and waiting for the right man to take it! And who better than a
Nelson and Trafalgar man?"</p>

<p>"Meaning...me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You'll mind Lord Nelson's fighting signal: 'Engage
the enemy more closely,' eh Tom?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir&mdash;but a mounseer's broadside is easier for to
face."</p>

<p>"Then get the weather-gauge and board, man, board!"</p>

<p>Tom rubbed his well-shaven chin with the whetstone and glancing
askance on Sam, smiled though very ruefully, saying:</p>

<p>"Sir, I tried it once but was repelled wi' loss, ay, the
casuallities was pretty heavy."</p>

<p>"Took it amiss, did she?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if a rap across my figurehead be amiss, she did.
And, what's more, she ain't took heed o' me by look nor word
since."</p>

<p>"So?" exclaimed Sam, also rubbing shaven chin but with thumb and
forefinger. "Why then, since the Navy never accepts defeat, the
only means left is surprise, a dashing boat action, a cutting-out
attack and damn the shore batteries!"</p>

<p>"E'cod sir, I never thought o' that...muffled
oars...surprise...neck or nothing...close quarters!"</p>

<p>"Think it over, old '<i>Victory</i> and Nelson' man."</p>

<p>"I will, sir, ay, I will, and thankee. But, sir, if I may make
s'bold, will ee&mdash;would you, sir, be s'good to speak her a word
on my behalf&mdash;should opportoonity offer?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Tom, I will so." Then Sam rambled on his way while Tom
started mowing, but now his lips, no longer grim-set, were puckered
to a soft, melodious whistling.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch116" id="ch116"></a>CHAPTER XVI. IN WHICH SAM HAS
OMINOUS WORD WITH JASPER SHRIG, OF BOW STREET</h3>

<p>Reaching the orchard at last, this green remoteness pleasantly
shaded by aged trees, apple and pear, Sam lay down beneath one of
the largest, broad back to rugged bole and began to fill his
pipe.</p>

<p>But so quiet was it and the warm air so conducive to sleep that
presently Sam closed his eyes slumberously and, after some while,
opened them drowsily&mdash;then sat up suddenly broad awake; for
here in this peaceful seclusion where it seemed, a moment before,
no man save himself had been, a man was now standing and within a
yard of him. A shortish, broad-shouldered youngish man trimly clad
in blue spencer, cords and top boots; a round-faced, keen-eyed,
powerful-looking fellow, who grasped a shaggy-napped hat in one
fist and a remarkably knotted stick in the other.</p>

<p>Now meeting Sam's astonished gaze, this sudden visitor beamed,
lifted the knobbly stick to his right eyebrow, saying in voice
hoarse though soft:</p>

<p>"Ax parding, sir, for this here in-troosion, but I'm begging the
favour of a vord or say&mdash;a couple, say&mdash;three or
four."</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam, blinking. "Where in the world did you
spring from?"</p>

<p>"The immejit vi-cinity, sir."</p>

<p>"Ha!" quoth Sam, picking up his fallen pipe. "And you're Mr.
Shrig, the Bow Street officer."</p>

<p>"That werry i-dentical, sir. And, sir, my wisitation is on a
werry personal and private matter."</p>

<p>"Oh," enquired Sam. "Ah! What, pray?"</p>

<p>"Vich, sir, seeing as how you're a-sitting there so nice and
see-clooded as no creeping crawlers can unseen hear nor yet hark,
I'll tell you frank and free as 'tis a matter o' life and
death."</p>

<p>"Ah?" murmured Sam again. "Whose?"</p>

<p>"Your werry own, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Sam, "that is rather personal. Bring-to, Mr.
Shrig, beside me, if you don't mind the grass, and let's hear."
Down sat Mr. Shrig with surprising nimbleness and nodding at Sam's
pipe took out his own, a short, blackened, villainous-looking clay,
enquiring as he did so:</p>

<p>"No objections, sir, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered Sam, proffering his tobacco-box,
whereat Mr. Shrig beamed but shook his head, saying:</p>

<p>"Much obleeged, sir, but I prefers my own." And when both pipes
were aglow and drawing well, Sam leaned back against his tree; thus
having puffed once or twice in silent content, Mr. Shrig removed
his pipe an inch or so from his lips and spoke:</p>

<p>"Talking o' bandages, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh? Bandages?" Sam repeated. "But we're not."</p>

<p>"Hows'ever, Mr. F. sir, I'm glad to see as your damaged tibby is
now getting along vithout same."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;though it wasn't much, just a bit of an accident,
d'ye see&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ar&mdash;in shape of a vip, sir, a pretty heavy 'un as vips
go."</p>

<p>"Ay, but how should you know?"</p>

<p>"Observation, Mr. F., and evidence received, sir. I likewise
know as your ass-aylant vich, naming no names I'll call Number Vun,
downed you wi' two ex-tremely wicious strokes! Yet, arter said
strokes you downed Number Vun and throwed him out into the
lane."</p>

<p>"So then you saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir, no, I were denied that pleasure, but I had eyes as see
for me."</p>

<p>"Ha, a spy?"</p>

<p>"A ass-istant, sir&mdash;viskers and a red vaistcoat, answering
to the name o' Dan'l."</p>

<p>"Dammit! Mr. Shrig, I strongly object to being spied upon!"</p>

<p>"And werry natral too, sir!" answered Mr. Shrig, puffing
serenely. "But then I object jest as strongly to seeing you a
bleedin' corpse afore your time! 'Twouldn't do, sir, and myself in
charge o' the case! So you mustn't go getting yourself shot, nor
yet stabbed, p'izened nor drownded, 'twould be bad for the both on
us."</p>

<p>"It would!" Sam agreed fervently, yet with flashing grin.
"Especially me, so I'll do my best to keep alive&mdash;if only for
your sake."</p>

<p>"Sir," retorted Mr. Shrig with reproachful shake of head, "you
take this here ugly business altogether too cool and calm. Murder
ain't never to be sneezed at&mdash;no, sir. Being The Capital Act
it should ought to be treated accordingly."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, watching the blue smoke wreathes of his pipe
ascend into the still air. "Ah? How, Shrig?"</p>

<p>"Respectful, sir! Ar, vith a respect bordering on h-awe." Here
Mr. Shrig, having puffed vehemently to keep his pipe going,
continued: "Sir, or, seeing as there's nobody to peek nor hark,
should I ought to say 'my lord'&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No!" answered Sam. "Certainly not!"</p>

<p>"Werry good, sir, then allow me to inform you as how, ever since
the moment I run you to earth and diskivered your true i-dentity,
you have been and are, a werry large fly in my ointment, risking
your precious life to no purpose and my constant ang-ziety."</p>

<p>"You think my life in such peril, eh, Shrig?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir! Ar and so does Mr. Joliffe! So why don't you think
the same and act according?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered Sam, musingly, "I'm pretty sure, of course,
that if my noble nunks could blast me by mere word or wish, I
should be dead this moment! Yes, considering I must be his ruin I
can well understand his burning desire to be rid o' me at any or
every cost&mdash;ay, even at risk of his lordly, confounded neck! A
most determined, desperately cool gentleman, Shrig."</p>

<p>"As any cowcumber, sir! And besides," here Mr. Shrig leaned
nearer to whisper harshly: "if ever I see a true, hell-fire Capital
Cove, 'tis him, Number Vun! I'm glad you've took notice and hope as
you'll go werry cautious henceforrard."</p>

<p>"Ay, I will so! But then, d'ye see, for chance to come at me he
must first of all find me...and he has no least idea where I am or
what I look like&mdash;ay, before he can act he must find me out
and make sure of my identity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ar! And so soon as he does, how then, sir?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Soon? Are you so sure he will?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I am so werry sure and cartain of it that I'm a-sitting
here at this pre-cise moment to tell you sich is so."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Sam, forgetting to smoke. "B'gad, are you? Pray
explain."</p>

<p>"Sir, how much d'you know con-carning a Mr. Tobias Jupp?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, I never hear the name. But tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vich don't sap-rise me none, sir, though he knows a on-common
lot about you!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" exclaimed Sam, again. "How?"</p>

<p>"By creeping, sir, crawling, and likewise peeping and prying. He
spoke to you in Lewes, by the old castle."</p>

<p>"Ay to be sure! You mean that remarkably unremarkable
fellow."</p>

<p>"That werry same. A most ex-tryordinary ordinary cove is Tobias,
that's his partickler line o' business, a werry downy bird is
Tobias! Having been a lawyer he's full of it and up to all the
moves, but then, sir, 'twixt you and me, so am I. Therefore, so
soon as Tobias J. left London and took arter you, me the Gimblet
and Dan'l took arter Tobias, in my gig, to keep our peepers or, as
you might say, ogles on both o' you."</p>

<p>"So that's how you saw me in Lewes, eh, Shrig?"</p>

<p>"Ar, and that's how I'm seeing you here, sir. But while we sits
here puffing our steamers so werry sociable&mdash;in a old,
ruinated mill werry picture-esquee and not so far hence,
blindfolded, gagged, tied up precious secure and com-pletely
flummoxed, Tobias Jupp aforesaid is lying at this pre-cise moment,
pondering how it all happened and oo dropped on him so sudden and
onexpected!" Here Mr. Shrig, glancing askance on his hearer,
emitted a soft, throaty chuckle.</p>

<p>"Aha!" murmured Sam, leaning nearer in his turn and lowering his
voice. "Grassed him, levelled the fellow, did you, b'George?"</p>

<p>"Mr. F. sir, I did&mdash;full length, face down'ards, and afore
he knowed oo or what, I'd got same tied up helpless as a ninfant
and blind as a kitten noo born, sir."</p>

<p>"Shrig," quoth Sam, with that sudden, white-toothed smile which
so lighted and transfigured his grim features, "give me your
hand."</p>

<p>"Honoured, sir."</p>

<p>"Lord love me!" chuckled Sam as their hands met. "Assault and
battery&mdash;and you a limb of the law!"</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Mr. Shrig, gravely, "there's times like this
here, when I'm all Law&mdash;arms, legs, body and soul! Ar, and I
perform according with fist, brain, boot or bludgeon if tackling
(as in dooty bound) Wiciousness afore it can act, Murder as creeps
unseen and crawls unheard upon its onsuspecting wictim. So there
lays Tobias in the old mill and here, Mr. F. sir, is the reason
thereof." And from the breast of his trim, blue, bright-buttoned
coat, Mr. Shrig drew a pocket-book which he opened, saying as he
did so:</p>

<p>"This here little reader belongs to Tobias, you shall see it in
a minute, sir, but listen first to what he's wrote down here." And
now leaning still nearer, Mr. Shrig read aloud, though very
softly:</p>

<p>"'Six foot tall about and powerful build. Darkish hair,
chestnut. Bold features of sat-ter-nine cast. Strides long and vith
rolling gait. Looks formidable. N.B. Now dressed as a sailor and
bears newly-healed scar above left eyebrow. Impossible to mistake
and therefore easy to i-dentify!' A remarkable true and acc'rate
description, eh, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" nodded Sam, grimly. "Yes, damme, I'm easy to recognize!
Whoever reads that will know me at a glance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ar&mdash;like a flash o' lightning, sir! Now, hark again." And
in the same hushed accents Mr. Shrig read this:</p>

<p>"'To whom it may con-cern. Gentlemen, at no little bodily risk,
trouble, labour and ex-pense, the information required is now in
the writer's possession. But owing to unforeseen risk and labour
aforesaid, cannot be handed over except the sum, already
stipulated, be doubled. The writer may be heard of at the Stag's
Head, Wrexford, but for three days only, by reason of risk
aforementioned.' And now, sir," said Mr. Shrig, passing letter and
pocket-book, "take a look at 'em yourself."</p>

<p>"Evidently a cunning rascal!" said Sam as he returned these,
after reading.</p>

<p>"'Cunning' is the vord, sir. Our Mr. T. J. is a slimy article as
has dodged The Law frequent&mdash;so far."</p>

<p>"But you have him safe and sound for the present, have you?"</p>

<p>"As the Bank of England, sir! Tobias can't see nor speak nor yet
stir a finger."</p>

<p>"And what now, friend Shrig?"</p>

<p>"All depends on you, Mr. F. sir."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Sir, just so soon as Tobias J. passes on this here information
to&mdash;us knows oo, vich same he'll do soon or late,
Windictiveness (ar and with a werry large Wee) will be
afoot&mdash;up and arter you, sir. Wiciousness'll be in the werry
air you breathe! Murder'll creep and crawl, seeking chance to
commit The Fact&mdash;to strike you dead, sir, sudden, sharp and
final!" Here Sam, finding his pipe had gone out, shook his head at
it and began to polish it thoughtfully upon his broad palm, while
Mr. Shrig continued:</p>

<p>"But sir, you have now two courses o' pro-ceedure as I can
offer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two, eh?" questioned Sam, still polishing his pipe-bowl. "Only
two, Shrig?"</p>

<p>"Two, sir, and no more!"</p>

<p>"Not a large selection, but let's hear."</p>

<p>"First, sir, you can skip and run&mdash;vay-cate or, as you
might say, hop this here rustical perch, me keeping Tobias werry
close and see-cure for a day or so till you can get safe onto some
ship and sail off&mdash;ar, and keep sailing till Mr. Joliffe sends
you the office as how he's laid&mdash;you know oo by his willainous
heels and you may come home in perfect safety. That's your first
course, sir, the most commonsense, safest and therefore
ad-wiseable."</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured Sam. "Yes, to be sure. And what's your course
Number Two?"</p>

<p>"To stay as y'are, sir, taking a chance but trusting to me.
Risking your precious life as a dee-coy drawing on Wiciousness to
attempt The Act, thereby giving me the opportoonity to trap
Wiciousness, tackle Murder and end same prompt&mdash;for good and
all. So there 'tis, sir, the ch'ice is yourn!...How d'ye say, Mr.
Felton, sir?"</p>

<p>"That the sooner we make a start the better."</p>

<p>"Eh, 'start,' sir? Meaning as you'll&mdash;go?"</p>

<p>"No, damme! I'm flying the signal for 'close action, enemy
sighted.' So we'll bear down on 'em together, Shrig."</p>

<p>"To-gether?" he repeated, his bright eyes seeming rounder than
usual. "Meaning as you'll&mdash;take a chance?"</p>

<p>"Just so!" nodded Sam. "For, d'ye see, I like Sussex and the
folk hereabout. And, for another thing, when trouble shows in the
offing, instead o' bearing up and standing away from it, I believe
in Lord Nelson's maxim 'engage the enemy more closely.' So, friend
Shrig, we'll engage 'em together, bring 'em to action yardarm to
yardarm, ay, we'll fight it out broadside for broadside, dare all
and hope for the best."</p>

<p>"Sir," quoth Mr. Shrig, beaming, "you are a gen'leman, ay, and a
man, my lord, as 'tis a rare pleasure to vork for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not 'for' but 'with,' Shrig, 'with'!...And since we are going
to fight this action like shipmates, we'll ha' done with any
'lording' or 'mistering'. For in spite o' what Fortune means me to
be, Nature made me an ordinary sort of fellow, a seafaring cove and
my name is Sam."</p>

<p>For a space Mr. Shrig looked at Sam and slowly his lips curved
to a smile, yet when he spoke, his tone was grave:</p>

<p>"Sir, if so be a gen'leman so honours me wi' his baptismal
monnicker, like as now, then I regards that same as my
'pal'&mdash;vich is a gipsy vord meaning 'brother'&mdash;ar and
more than brother! So now, sir, I begs to regard you as 'my pal
Sam,' sir, and herevith proffers you my daddle." Saying which, Mr.
Shrig reached forth his hand, which Sam grasped and shook
heartily.</p>

<p>"And now, sir and pal, if you have the time and incli-nation, my
gig's handy, I could take you a little drive and tell you,
ar&mdash;and show you summat as I fancy'll prove inter-esting and
werry suggestive. And, Sam pal, my name to you henceforth is
Jarsper. So how about it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Jasper, I'm with you, so heave ahead, shipmate."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch117" id="ch117"></a>CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH MR. SHRIG
DISCOURSES UPON THE CAPITAL ACT</h3>

<p>In the lane stood a vehicle mounted upon a pair of the tallest
wheels Sam had ever seen, drawn by a slim-legged, speedy-looking
horse, and driven by a meek-seeming individual remarkable for a red
waistcoat and woebegone visage, which was rendered even more so by
a pair of drooping, hay-like whiskers of the kind sometimes known
as "weepers." This person Mr. Shrig forthwith addressed,
saying:</p>

<p>"Dan'l, you know this gen'leman." Dan'l nodded and touched
whipstock to straw-coloured eyebrow in silent greeting. "But,"
continued Mr. Shrig, "but what you don't know is&mdash;Mr. F. is
also my pal!" Dan'l instantly bared his tow-coloured head, gave his
hat a peculiar spin and replaced it, all in as many moments, saying
in feeble, die-away voice:</p>

<p>"Greetin's, sir! D'you drive, Gov, or me?"</p>

<p>"You, Dan'l. And go easy for I'm a-going to use my
chaffer&mdash;a council of vor, pal Sam, sir, a talk on vays and
means, sir. So it'll be the back seat for you and me&mdash;arter
you, pal."</p>

<p>Up they mounted, and seated side by side, away they drove at
leisured, ambling pace.</p>

<p>But now as they rolled smoothly through the warm kindly air of
this bowery, peaceful countryside, they talked of the sure and
certain approach of murderous evil, thus:</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Pal Sam, sir, it now be-hooves us to&mdash;are you
harking, Dan'l?</p>

<p>DAN'L: Yus, Gov.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Werry good! It be-hooves us to consider the methods
warious by vich willainy may attempt The Act upon you.</p>

<p>SAM: Meaning my murder, Jasper? I suppose there are many ways it
could be done.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Oceans! So let's take 'em in doo order. And first, by
shooting, eh, Dan'l? Shooting's pretty common.</p>

<p>DAN'L: Yus, Gov, it are. Though knives is commoner and razors is
frequent.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Ar, in back streets, cellars, dives and rookeries,
Dan'l. But this is the country all coverts and rabbit varrens, so I
put shooting first. F'instance, pal and sir&mdash;you take a
evening stroll to see the sun set or moon rise&mdash;a shot from
the leafage and there y'are, dead as mutton and nobody to heed, for
if said shot is heard 'twill be put down to poachers.
Second&mdash;stabbing, pal. Say you pause by a stile or gate to
hear the birds a-varbling as the shadders fall&mdash;ah, but there
comes a shadder as creeps soundless, a knife upraised behind
you&mdash;and down you go, said knife in your back and only the
birds to see the how and who of it and they can't talk nor tell.
Thirdly&mdash;throttling, Sam pal, strangu-lation, sir. But you're
sich a tough, powerful fighting-cove you'd take a deal o'
throttling, so we'll pass that and come to:
Fourthly&mdash;drownding. 'Spose you're standing to admire a
rippling brook or silent, lonesome pool&mdash;the crack of a
bludgeon on your on-suspecting tibby&mdash;and in you go to a
reg'lar vatery grave. There's a pool as us'll pass werry
soon&mdash;</p>

<p>DAN'L: Wrexford Old Mill dam.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Ar, and a bee-u-tiful place for it, as by Natur'
formed for The Act. Fifthly, pal Sam, there's&mdash;p'izen&mdash;in
your food or drink vith death in every swaller and gulp!</p>

<p>SAM: That would be worst of all, Jasper.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: It is, pal, or it ain't, according to the p'izen used
or a-dopted. Sixthly, there's&mdash;accidents, Sam and sir, a
tripline to throw you headlong, say downstairs, say down a old
mine-shaft, cliff or quarry or other deadfall. Seventhly&mdash;</p>

<p>SAM: Belay, Jasper, avast! B'George, you've said enough!</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Eh? Enough to make you think better of it, hop the
perch and toddle...take ship and go a-sailing, 'stead o' chancing
death by such bloody wiolence, eh, sir?</p>

<p>SAM: I've chanced it pretty often afore now. And violent death
isn't always so horrid or bloody as you describe, Jasper. I've seen
too much of it aboard ship and I know.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Then you ain't a-going to fly the coop or, as you
might say, e-lope?</p>

<p>SAM: No. I'm scheming how we can force the enemy to action. For,
d'ye see, I've no mind to hang i' the wind or ply off and on. The
sooner we can get to close quarters the better.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG (<i>Heaving sigh</i>): Ah, pal Sam, dog bite me if I
didn't think&mdash;no matter! But as to a-bringing of 'em to
action&mdash;</p>

<p>SAM: That's it, Jasper! I want 'em face to face, none o' this
hole and corner business or&mdash;</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG (<i>With sudden anxiety</i>): Hold hard, sir! Lord
love you, hold precious hard! The vord for us, and 'specially you,
is&mdash;caution! Ar, and wrote in capitals! To act too soon or
anyways previous vould be our con-flammeration, and p'raps your
death. So, pal, and I say this werry earnest indeed&mdash;you must
leave the how and when and where of it to me! You must continny to
lay low, do nothing and make no move till my plans is laid and trap
dooly baited! You&mdash;</p>

<p>SAM: When will that be, Jasper?</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Pal, ekker alone replies. But, sir, you must gimme
your solemn oath, ar a word of honour into the bargain not to stir
foot nor finger till I give you the office, or my case is ruinated
and yourself stiff and cold in death&mdash;</p>

<p>SAM: But, dammit, man, where do I come in?</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Sir, you'll come in, like I say, as a poor, bleeding
corpse if you move afore I'm ready.</p>

<p>SAM: Well, I'd risk even that for chance of right prompt
action.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: 'Twould be more than risk, sir. 'Twould be sure and
sartin fact. So gimme your oath not to&mdash;</p>

<p>SAM (<i>Impatiently</i>): Oh, very well!</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Good! You have took a load off my throbber.</p>

<p>DAN'L (<i>With sideways jerk of mournful head</i>): The old
mill, Jarsper.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Then pull up, Dan'l. Now gimme the reins and cut
along to see if Toby J. is safe and snug.</p>

<p>DAN'L (<i>Reining up beside a stile and descending from lofty
driving-seat</i>): Must I feed him, Gov?</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: You give him brea'fast, didn't you?</p>

<p>DAN'L: Ar, a lump o' cheese, two slices o' bread and a mug o'
water.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Then he'll do till supper-time. Cut along
now&mdash;and take care he don't spy your chiv, Dan'l, nor hear you
speak, the less he knows, the better for all con-sarned.</p>

<p>DAN'L: Righto, Jarsper.</p>

<p>MR. SHRIG: Then cut along.</p>

<p>"Ay, Gov," said Dan'l, in his softly doleful voice and turning,
leapt the stile with surprising agility and was gone. Left thus
alone, the two sat mute a while, Mr. Shrig's quick, bright glance
roving to and fro and round about, Sam gazing down across hedgerow
and spinney where in the valley below lay a pool very still and
dark for it was bowered in tangled thickets and shaded by tall
trees, amid which dense leafage showed a crumbling ruin.</p>

<p>"Ar!" exclaimed Mr. Shrig, with a sigh that had a certain
gloating ecstasy in it. "The old ruinated mill&mdash;there's a
sight, pal and sir! 'Tis on Wrybourne land, three mile over yonder
lays the Dower House, they call it the Manor, and in the Manor
lives&mdash;us knows oo, Number Vun, and that there old mill
belongs to him. Look at it, pal&mdash;there's a picter for a
painting cove to set about, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sam, adding on impulse, "and a very hateful
one!"</p>

<p>"Eh, hateful?"</p>

<p>"Very! It's so...dam' desolate...and worse!"</p>

<p>"How so, pal Sam?"</p>

<p>"There's something evil about it."</p>

<p>"Now burn my neck if there ain't! 'Evil,' says you, 'werry much
so,' says I, for, I've got Tobias J. tied up there and Toby's a
pretty evil article. But the old mill, you'll allow, is picturesky.
I never see any place properer and more bee-u-tifully fit for The
Act! No murderer could resist it&mdash;so nice and lonesome, so fur
from any hope or chance of ass-istance, ar and a pool so handy, all
ready and vating to receive or drownd all as remains of Murder's
poor, bleeding wictim! Nobody'll wenture nigh the place at night,
and few b'day&mdash;vich ain't to be expected, con-sidering!"</p>

<p>"What, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"As how a murder and two sooicides has befell there already. And
'tis there, as I should like to end this here case and bring
Willainy to its just and proper doom, by means o' you, pal Sam,
sir."</p>

<p>"Eh? Me?" enquired Sam, starting. "Oh? Very good! How?"</p>

<p>"Pal," sighed Mr. Shrig, shaking his head rather mournfully, "up
to the present ekker alone responds 'how indeed'? But, sir, you are
my cheese for the trap, lime for my twig and vorm for my hook as I
shall use wi' all doo care, hoping for the best. For, if agreeable
to you, I shall, this werry night and soon as 'tis black dark, turn
loose Tobias Jupp, expecting and also hoping as he'll do and
per-form his heenious part and set Murder a-crawling on your
dewoted heels."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, pondering this, chin in hand. "Ah! And what
am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Bide snug at Villersmead, lay low, ar precious low and leave it
all to me&mdash;and Dan'l. For&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not I!" quoth Sam, clenching his fists. "No, damme! I mean to
take my part and fight this action along o' you. D'ye think I'll
cower and skulk and be inactive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, I do, sir, and laying inactive for ever still&mdash;in a
vooden overcoat, elm, sir, and silver fittings&mdash;if you don't!
Sir, if you go out looking for Murder&mdash;Murder'll find you,
ar&mdash;sure as death!"</p>

<p>"I'll take my chance o' that as I have before."</p>

<p>"Ar, but that was at sea, in a clean fight, man to man&mdash;but
this'll be Murder as crawls and you the dee-fenceless wictim."</p>

<p>"You seem dev'lish sure of it."</p>

<p>"Nat'rally, sir. For in this here Wale o' Sorrow and Iniquity,
there's murder-ers and murder-ees, born for each other and so to
be. Therefore wictim never can and never did escape, dodge, nor yet
e-lood his murderer or there'd be neither vun nor t'other. And
there y'are!"</p>

<p>"However," Sam retorted, squaring shoulders and jaw, "if my life
is attempted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As 'twill surely be, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I shall stand to my guns and go down fighting, if I
must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vich, sir, down indeed you'll surely go."</p>

<p>"Jasper, you're a confounded misery!"</p>

<p>"Werry true, sir, and you so eager to play ducks and drakes wi'
your precious life and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And also seeing as how Mr. Joliffe made me ree-sponsible for
your safety&mdash;Though,' says he to me, 'you'll find him a
handful, Shrig!' says he. And dog bite my neck if you ain't! So
here's myself, and for the last time, axing you&mdash;no, pleading
of you to lay low, leave all to me and not try nor yet at-tempt the
impossible."</p>

<p>"Ay, but&mdash;what is 'the impossible,' Jasper man? If Old
England hadn't attempted&mdash;ay and done it pretty often through
battle and storm ever since King Alfred invented The Navy, then
History would have a very different tale to tell. And what d'you
say to that, Shrig?"</p>

<p>"Sir, all I can ree-spond is&mdash;your own tale'll be told
pretty soon&mdash;but by others, seeing as your tongue, or as you
might say 'chaffer' 'll be for ever dumb as any eyster! And talking
of Holy Writ, the Bible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh? But we've never mentioned it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hows'ever, you read it now and then, I hope, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, but what the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you may remember as a gent, a law officer name o' P.
Pilate vashed his hands on a certain o-ccasion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, though I ain't got no vater, I'm a-doing the werry same at
this i-dentical moment! I'm soaking my daddles as a sign that I'm
done wi' this here case and am off to London, prompt, to report
same to Mr. Joliffe."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Sam, rather bitterly. "Leaving me to tackle this
foul business alone, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, leaving your sorrowful friends to la-ment over your
unfort'nate remains."</p>

<p>"Is that so!" Sam demanded, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Ar!" nodded Mr. Shrig, dejectedly. "So it is! But you'll make a
werry handsome corpse&mdash;arter they've cleaned you up and laid
you out."</p>

<p>"Well, that's something!" said Sam.</p>

<p>"It is, sir. But arter I've took your murderer and seen him
dooly scragged, topped, hung and jibbeted&mdash;though that can't
do you no manner o' good, I shall grieve for a pal as got himself
cut off so reckless, so young, and all to no purpose&mdash;a wictim
as need never have been."</p>

<p>Here ensued a silence wherein Mr. Shrig sighed mournfully, shook
his head dismally and turned to watch for the return of Dan'l;
then, hearing a chuckle, he glanced round and meeting Sam's
flashing smile, instantly beamed in response, saying:</p>

<p>"So, pal Sam, you was only flamming me, a flam, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, Jasper, I meant every word, for d'ye see, I can't imagine
myself any sort of victim. But since you got me into this ugly
business by discovering my true identity, dammit&mdash;I'm going to
leave you to get me out of it the best you can and in your own
way."</p>

<p>"And," quoth Mr. Shrig, drawing a bulbous pocket-book from the
breast of his trim, blue coat, "you couldn't do better nor say
fairer. So now, being pals and ass-ociated in this here case, I'll
ax you," here he opened the book and consulted a certain page,
"talking o' the old mill yonder, did you ever hear tell of a Lady
Barbara Stowe?"</p>

<p>"Never!" answered Sam, glancing again at that dark and stilly
pool. "Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Vich aren't to be expected o' you, pal Sam, seeing as she
ain't, con-sidering as twenty-two year ago she was found a-floating
there."</p>

<p>"Eh? That dev'lish pool...drowned, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Werry com-pletely, pal, and nobody knows the oo, the how or
why&mdash;yet! Then four year and six months ago Susan Marsh also
gets drowned there, but she'd been crossed in love, poor lass, so
us can pass her case as feller-de-see. Two year ago Thomas Jeffs a
Preeventive officer is found dangling from a beam."</p>

<p>"Another suicide, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Hardly so, pal, seeing as according to evidence, said Thomas
had received nineteen stabs."</p>

<p>"Were his murderers ever caught?"</p>

<p>"Never a soul, pal, no! And talking o' souls, can you tell me
anything con-cerning a Mr. Eus-tiss Jennings?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't."</p>

<p>"Yet I hoped as you might, pr'aps."</p>

<p>"How on earth could I? I'm as strange hereabouts as you
are."</p>

<p>"Hows'ever, I know as he's a neighbour o' yourn, lives yonder at
the Manor, along o'&mdash;Number Vun."</p>

<p>"Well, I never heard of the fellow. What's he like?"</p>

<p>"A werry dainty, soft-spoke gen'leman as I took to on sight and
so amazing, that I've got him down here in my little reader
as&mdash;Number Two."</p>

<p>"Oh?" questioned Sam, "why?"</p>

<p>Before Mr. Shrig could reply, the man Dan'l reappeared, vaulted
nimbly over the stile, nodded feebly and said, in his die-away
voice:</p>

<p>"All's bowmon, Jarsper."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Shrig, thrusting away his "little reader."
"Tobias is nice and snug then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Gov, 'e grunted and jigged a bit when he felt me move the
'ay."</p>

<p>"Hay?" enquired Sam.</p>

<p>"Ar," beamed Mr. Shrig, "I've got Toby J. covered up agin chance
obserwation though same aren't likely in sich bee-ooti-fully
lonesome spot. How 'much further, Dan'l?" he enquired as that
unexpectedly agile person swung up to the lofty driving-seat.</p>

<p>"Next gate, top o' the 'ill, Gov."</p>

<p>"Sam pal, you have never yet seen nor heered tell of Bracton
spinney and the chalk pit, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't."</p>

<p>"Then if youm so minded, you shall see same, ar, and hear the
dee-ductions as I have drawed therefrom, making things, as seem
pretty ugly now, ass-oom a aspect even and ever more hijjeous. How
about it, Sam pal, are y' game?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Jasper, I'm with you."</p>

<p>"Then drive on, Dan'l."</p>

<h3><a name="ch118" id="ch118"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. CONCERNING A
MURDER, THE HOW OF IT</h3>

<p>An age-worn gate with beyond a narrow glade or ride that curved
away through dense woodland where rabbits scurried and birds piped
amid a hush of leaves, for the day was hot and very still. Reaching
this gate Mr. Shrig paused to lean there, yet with a tense
alertness in every line of his powerful body; motionless he stood,
head bowed as though listening intently while under close-knit
brows his bright eyes shot quick, roving glances above and all
around, until Sam demanded, impatiently:</p>

<p>"Why are we hove-to, Jasper, what are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>"To look, pal, to heark and ax questions&mdash;the grass, the
leaves, ar, every indiwidual bush and tree&mdash;as I have done
afore now, and someday they're agoing to answer."</p>

<p>"Answer what?"</p>

<p>"The truth, the whole truth and nothing but. For Natur' can't
lie, leastways not to me it don't!"</p>

<p>"Jasper, you've set me all aback, shivering in the wind's eye!
Speak plain, Shrig man, plain."</p>

<p>"Werry good!" he answered, and opening the gate paced on beside
Sam at leisured amble and explained thus:</p>

<p>"The reasons as I questions Natur' hereabouts is for the
follering&mdash;are you listening?"</p>

<p>"Ay, be sure I am."</p>

<p>"Then, pal Sam, sir, along this here track so leafily re-mote,
upon a fair summer's eve, your dad the late Earl o' Wrybourne rode
to his sudden death. So the first question I asks is: Verefore
should his lordship come a-wisiting in such desolate soli-tood?
And, Nature vispers: 'Jarsper S., my lord being a Scrope, the
answer is in the Femi-nine Gender'! So here he comes galloping so
gay and free&mdash;and yonder, for good and all, he
ends&mdash;look!" They had turned a sudden, sharp bend in the
track; and here Mr. Shrig halted to point with knobbly stick,
saying:</p>

<p>"What d'ye see, pal?"</p>

<p>"A stretch of grass," Sam replied, "and a broken fence."</p>

<p>"Ah! And now, pal, treading werry cautious, come and look beyond
said fence...now, what d'ye see?"</p>

<p>"An abyss," answered Sam, peering down and beyond these broken
palings. "And mighty steep, too."</p>

<p>"Ab-biss?" repeated Mr. Shrig. "This is a new un to me as I'll
make a note on later&mdash;ab-biss. But this here same abbiss is a
werry ancient chalk-pit and a sheer drop, two hundred feet and
more. And through yon fence, down into this here ab-biss aforesaid
tumbled the late Earl, hoss and all, to lie stone dead, corpses
both, at the bottom. And Sam, sir, nobody grieved except for the
hoss as was a mare and a good un, nobody mourned the Earl, quite
the contrairy! For when a werry rich man hops the mortal perch,
there's always some folks as re-j'ices in or out'ardly, vich, arter
all, is only nat'ral. So now my next and second question is: Oo
benefits? And Natur' answers werry plain: Us knows oo! And my next
question is: How should my lord's mare come to shy at the vun and
only place where certain death must en-soo? Also, from information
received, said mare being a creeter never known to shy&mdash;so how
came she so to do? A sudden fright...a stumble...a headlong plunge
to final o-blivion. So I ax how could such fright, stumble and fall
be con-trived? And, Sam pal, Natur' vispers and werry soft indeed:
'A trip-line! a rope tied low 'twixt two trees&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Sam, speaking himself in harsh whisper,
"Jasper, are you suggesting...murder?"</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Mr. Shrig beckoned and Sam
followed&mdash;away from that fatal spot to a small clearing beside
the track and here Mr. Shrig seated himself upon a fallen tree,
saying in the same hushed tones:</p>

<p>"My lord and pal, you being a sailorman too, know the blessed
conso-lation of tobacker smoke drawed gentle through a pipe be it
vood or clay, so sit down and smoke along o' Jarsper and let's talk
open and free. Also," he continued, easing a large silver watch out
of his fob, "in about ten minutes&mdash;say fifteen, I'm expecting
a country cove, a poacher as chanced hereabouts on that fatal eve
and is therefore a vitness-by-ear! Name o' Barnes baptismal Ezra, a
simple sort o' cove but nat'ral born slinker."</p>

<p>"You mean he heard something, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Ar! And if he hadn't been such a werry furtive slinker he might
ha' seen. But that 'ud be too much to hope or ex-pect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, but what did he hear, man, what?"</p>

<p>"The mare's hoofs coming at a gallop&mdash;then said hoofs
checked to stumbling stagger, then the crash o' the breaking fence,
and then&mdash;ha, then&mdash;the scream o' the Earl as he pitched
down...and down...to his finish...screaming in mid air...screaming
vords, pal, till they ended for evermore in the final bump."</p>

<p>"Rather...horrible, Jasper."</p>

<p>"Ar!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what were the words?"</p>

<p>"Pal, all as ekker alone can respond is&mdash;vot indeed? For
Ezra Barnes didn't hear, or don't remember, but arter he'd took
courage to go down and take a peep at the re-mains, the Earl and
his poor mare lay mangled corpses, werry mangled indeed, vich
you'll agree was a fairish ugly end."</p>

<p>"Yes," growled Sam, "a bad end for a worse man! For d'ye
see&mdash;" he paused as his keen, sailorly eyes glimpsed something
that moved amid the nearby thickets, an indeterminate object that
presently resolved itself into a weather-beaten moleskin cap
crowning a bewhiskered visage that peered furtively through the
dense leafage; Mr. Shrig's roving glance had seen also, for he
hailed cheerily:</p>

<p>"Greetin's, friend Barnes! Step forrard and earn five shillings,
seven and six&mdash;say ten." Thus admonished, Mr. Barnes sidled
through the leafage, shambled into the open and thumbed his cap,
saying:</p>

<p>"Ten shillin', maister, roight! Wot'll oi say?"</p>

<p>"The truth, Ezra lad, the gospel truth, friend! As
f'rinstance&mdash;about a year ago on a sunny evening you are doing
a bit o' poaching, setting snares in' the spinny hereabout and you
hears summat, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ay, hoss-huffs, maister."</p>

<p>"So what did you do, Ezra?"</p>

<p>"Lays me flat in' the bracken, maister."</p>

<p>"And werry nat'ral too! Then&mdash;what did ye see?"</p>

<p>"Th' Earl, maister, ay, Oi sees mlord ride by."</p>

<p>"Was he going fast or slow?"</p>

<p>"Fast&mdash;full gallop loike 'e allus did."</p>

<p>"Could ye see his face?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I did, maister."</p>

<p>"How did it look, angry or pleased, smiling or scowling,
hey?"</p>

<p>"More smiling loike, Oi'd say."</p>

<p>"So! And then, Ezra lad, and then?"</p>

<p>"Then, maister, I heered the mare's huffs check, then a shout,
then the crack o' the fence a-goin', and then&mdash;th' Earl
shrieked&mdash;turned me ice-cold, it did!"</p>

<p>"And you're sartin-sure 'twasn't a wooman's scream; eh, Ezra,
ye're sure?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Oi be mortal sure. No woman ever could cry so wild and
'oarse like. 'Orrorsome, it were and freezed me good blood
like!"</p>

<p>"Then what did you, Ezra?"</p>

<p>"Dropped me snares and run! Ah, but that gashly cry followered
me till it ended sudden like in a gert thump&mdash;down there in
old chalk-pit."</p>

<p>"Ar! And how then, lad?"</p>

<p>"Then, maister, Oi lays me down, sick and faint like, for Oi
knowed as that gert thump meant death."</p>

<p>"Hows'ever, you took a peep to make sure, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sure-ly, maister. After a bit down Oi crep' and&mdash;there
they was, in their blood, arl broke up like...Ah, blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plenty of it, eh, Ezra?"</p>

<p>"Plenty, maister? Lordy, Oi never seen s'much in arl me days, no
not even when I 'elped Sim Brooke to slaughter 'is prize 'og!"</p>

<p>"Ha! So that's all you can remember of it, eh, lad?"</p>

<p>"No, maister. 'Cause arter you axed me of it t'other day, I
moinded, arter you'd gone, 'ow I'd forgot to tell ee o' the
face."</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Mr. Shrig, nearly dropping his precious clay
pipe, "face? Oo's face?"</p>

<p>"Dunno, maister, only 'twere a face as peeped down from upalong.
For whiles I'm lookin' at the Earl, and him so on-common dead, I
'ears a sound above, and sees a face a-peepin' down at me through
the broke fence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wot sort o' face? Male or fee-male?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say, maister, only 'twere smallish face...longish 'air
and nary a whisker."</p>

<p>"Should ye know it again, Ezra, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nay, maister, Oi got but a glimp' loike, 'twere gone in a
flash."</p>

<p>"Ho!" sighed Mr. Shrig, mournfully. "Only a glimp'! And this
here face seemed like it were taking a peep down at you and his
lordship's re-mains, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ay, maister."</p>

<p>"Took a peep it did and wanished at sight o' you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ay, maister, so then Oi didn't boide f'no more but crep'
off&mdash;along 'ome, Oi did."</p>

<p>"But didn't meet anybody or glimp' anything on your road,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Nary soul nor thing, sir. So that be arl as Oi can tell ee...so
now...you says summat about ten shillin'."</p>

<p>"Ar, I did so!" nodded Mr. Shrig, thrusting hand into pocket of
his neat cord breeches. "But afore I pay you same, tell me this,
Ezra: As you crep' off homevards did you happen to&mdash;hear
anything&mdash;say a rustling in the bushes, a shout, a cry or even
a visper? Think now and think precious hard&mdash;did you ketch any
sich sound?"</p>

<p>"No, maister, none o' they loike, arl as I 'eered was only the
sound of a axe."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Mr. Shrig again, his whole form stiffening
suddenly. "Only...the sound of...a naxe, hey! Come, that's better,
Ezra, that's oceans better! Now did this axe sound near and plain
or faint and far off?"</p>

<p>"A bit faint and fur loike, maister."</p>

<p>"Still, you could hear it pretty distinct, eh, Ezra?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Oi could and did&mdash;chop, it went, chop, chip, and chop
again."</p>

<p>"Good!" nodded Mr. Shrig, beaming. "Sounded like somebody
chopping in a precious great hurry, did it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, so it did, maister, the strokes sounded very quick loike,
they did."</p>

<p>"And did this same chopping come from afore you or from
be-hind?"</p>

<p>"Back along, maister."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Mr. Shrig again, his eyes brighter than the
plate buttons of his smart coat.</p>

<p>"And that be arl as I can moind or tell ee&mdash;'</p>

<p>"And here's your ten shillings, Ezra! Take 'em and good luck
t'ye."</p>

<p>"Thankee, maister, Oi'm sure! Good day, gen'lemen!" So saying,
Mr. Barnes touched moleskin cap with scrawny finger and edging
himself back amid the denser undergrowth, vanished like the furtive
creature he was. And when all sound of him had died away, Mr. Shrig
sighed happily, tapped out his cherished though fragmentary pipe
very tenderly, and beaming on Sam, murmured in hushed accents:</p>

<p>"A naxe!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Sir and Sam, said impli-ment answers a most wexatious,
con-flummerating question&mdash;I hope!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" questioned Sam, as they rose, "ah! Pray what, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"A tree, pal! A tree as should ought to be, yet ain't! A tree as
must be if the dee-ducktions as I've drawed is co-rrect and
according to The Fact."</p>

<p>"Afraid I don't get your meaning, Jasper."</p>

<p>"Pal, I didn't ex-pect as you could. Hows'ever come along o'
Jarsper and let's take a obserwation."</p>

<p>So back they went to halt again where the track made the sudden
bend to skirt the ancient chalk-pit; and now, turning his back to
broken fence and the green abyss beyond, Mr. Shrig pointed with his
stick, saying: "Here 'pon our left is trees and 'specially this un
beside the track&mdash;this un as has growed itself year by year,
day arter day for&mdash;The Purpose!"</p>

<p>"Eh? Purpose? You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The Deed, pal Sam! Murder, sir! The Capital Act!"</p>

<p>"But, Jasper, I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more did I and no more I don't now spy that tree as should
be standing opposite this un but ain't. Therefore, pal, seeing as
there's none other near enough for suspected fee-lonious purpose,
all I can do is hope and&mdash;seek." As he spoke, Mr. Shrig turned
aside and began searching where tall bracken grew thick and grass
lush, questing to and fro much like hound on the scent, though
never far from the track itself, while Sam, puffing his pipe,
watched with puzzled frown.</p>

<p>"Jasper," said he, at last, "say what you're after and I'll be
glad to bear a hand."</p>

<p>"No need," replied Mr. Shrig, straightening broad back, "I've
found it! Ar, by goles, and in the right and proper place, too!
Come and take a peep." Stepping forward, Sam looked down where Mr.
Shrig's stick had put aside bracken and undergrowth to show the
hacked stump of a small tree.</p>

<p>"Look!" murmured Mr. Shrig, gazing down upon this jagged object
as if he loved it, "how much does this here tell you, Sam pal?"</p>

<p>"That whoever felled this was either in desperate haste or quite
unused to such work."</p>

<p>"Both, ar&mdash;he was both! The party as chopped down this
little tree, chopped wild&mdash;look at the cuts&mdash;chipped and
chopped to destroy evidence. The hands as used axe so werry orkard
was the same as tied the trip-line so neat&mdash;'twixt this same
little tree and the big un yonder, fixed it fast and true enough to
tumble the Earl to his doom."</p>

<p>"The hands," murmured Sam, frowning thoughtfully down at this
jagged stump, "of someone&mdash;unused to the axe! A terribly
suggestive thought!"</p>

<p>"Werry much so!"</p>

<p>"And you are convinced here was&mdash;murder?"</p>

<p>"I am, pal Sam, for that's what this place, or the woice o'
Natur' is telling me...If only it had befell a veek ago, or even a
month, I'd ha' been werry sure. But time vorks changes, trees grow,
ditter grass and bushes, so the woice o' Natur' is hushed thereby.
Hence, from con-cloosions drawed I can only suspect and&mdash;hope
werry hard."</p>

<p>"For what, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Proof, pal, proof! For by The Law of England the goriest
willain is innocent as frisking lamb or babe noo-born till proof,
with a Capital Pee, shows him guilty! So I can suspect and, in my
mind, be sure o' guilt till I'm black in the phiz for no
proof&mdash;no guilt and all is labour in wain. Ar, Guilt can cock
a snook at me and toddle off to more willainy, leaving your pal
J.S. helpless as a poor bird vith broken ving. Lord love you, but
for proof there'd be many a murderer jigging in a rope collar at
this i-dentical minute! Proof is a stumbling block and the
ruination o' my business&mdash;sometimes. So I can only vork, as in
dooty bound and hope, as is my natur."</p>

<p>Then, together and as by common consent, they turned and left
that place of death and sinister brooding solitude where now (or so
it seemed to Sam) no leaf stirred, no rabbit frisked, and no bird
sang; the blessed sun shone bright and warm as ever, yet Sam felt
suddenly chilled by sense of lurking, implacable evil, a hateful
menace that filled the woodland all about him and was to haunt him
day and night, following his every step with a dreadful patience
until&mdash;at last...</p>

<p>"Jasper," he demanded, "why so dam' silent and speechless? What
are you thinking?" And instantly Mr. Shrig replied, and very
wistfully:</p>

<p>"Foam, Sam pal! Froth atop of a pewter pint pot, wi' summat cool
and moist and nutty below, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" quoth Sam, lengthening his stride, "the sooner the
better, messmate!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch119" id="ch119"></a>CHAPTER XIX. CONCERNING THE
SUBTLETIES OF A SCYTHE</h3>

<p>The jaunty glazed hat, the too-ornate neckerchief and sailorly
jacket were adorning a gate-post of the five acre meadow, for Sam,
bare-armed, intent of eye and square of jaw, was performing on that
so ancient and subtle implement, the scythe, and doing it very
badly.</p>

<p>Thus after some while of violent hacking and slashing and all to
distressingly small effect, he had paused to mop perspiring brow
and survey the meagre result of his powerful efforts in rueful
surprise when, hearing a hoarse chuckle behind him, he glanced
round and beheld a small, old man perched precariously upon the
gate, a wizened, frail-seeming old fellow in wide-eaved hat and
neat smock frock, who chuckled, laughed, choked and finally
enquired:</p>

<p>"Young man, wot be ee a-doin' of, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Sam, shaking his head, "I thought I was mowing,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you ain't!" quoth the old man, with beaming nod. "No, that
you ain't, no'ow. You'm jest mickin' and muckin' about, ah no
question! That theer thing as you'm misusin' of so shameful, bean't
a axe, nor yet a swop-'ook, bill or saw, 'tis a scythe, that's wot
it be."</p>

<p>"So I believe," answered Sam, meekly. "But the dam' thing must
be blunt."</p>

<p>"Young man, dam' thing be sharp as razor! I see and 'eered my
Tom a-whettin' of it jest afore 'e were called away by Mistus
Kate."</p>

<p>"However, it won't cut&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, but 'twill&mdash;if ee uses un proper and like as a scythe
should ought for to be used."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, wistfully. "Ah! Then it seems I haven't the
right trick of it, eh?"</p>

<p>"That you ain't, no, nor like to 'ave neether, the crool way as
you 'andles un."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sam, taking a fresh grip, "I'll have another go and
hope for the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" screeched the old man, "I can't abear for to watch ee
slish and slash so 'orrid wild and fierce! Bide a bit and I'll show
ee 'ow, for I be Toop&mdash;Silas Toop&mdash;that's oo I be, and no
man could larn ee better! I'll show ee."</p>

<p>"I'd be grateful," said Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh?" demanded Mr. Toop. "'Ow grateful?"</p>

<p>"Very grateful."</p>

<p>"Would your gratitood run to a pint&mdash;or say, a couple?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very good! Ketch 'old o' me stick and I'll come down."</p>

<p>"Shall I help you, Mr. Toop?"</p>

<p>"No, you shan't, young man. I clumb gates and stiles 'igher than
thus un, long afore you was born, and I bean't so doddlish as I
can't yet." So saying, the aged man very deliberately and with the
utmost care, descended safely to earth, smoothed his smock,
resettled his hat upon silvery hair, moistened his palms and
said:</p>

<p>"Gimme that scythe!" Sam obeyed&mdash;and lo! As these old hands
took and gripped, the small form seemed to dilate, the bowed back
to straighten, eyes brightened, age and feebleness seemed forgotten
as, leaning forward, Mr. Toop began to mow, cutting a wide, clean
swath with such effortless skill and unconscious grace of movement
that Sam exclaimed, impulsively:</p>

<p>"Marvellous!"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't!" snapped the Aged One, when at last he paused.
"'Tis jest bein' used and knowin' 'ow."</p>

<p>"But," said Sam, admiringly, "you don't even puff and blow!"</p>

<p>"Not likely!" retorted Mr. Toop, with lofty scorn, "I were
champeen mower in my young days, ah and old days tu! Mow arl day, I
could, faster, cleaner, straighter than any on 'em, I could!
Lookee, here's the way on it&mdash;keep p'int up a bit, heel down a
bit, swing un smooth and steady, don't ee hurry un, give un time
for to cut! Don't ee drag nor slash nor yet chop, no jiggin' nor
jaggin'!"</p>

<p>"I see!" said Sam, deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Ay, but 'tis one thing tu see and another thing tu do!"</p>

<p>"Well, let me have another go."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, there y'are! Mind now&mdash;p'int up a bit...foller y'r
p'int, swingin' steady and slow, easy now! Ay, that be a mite
better! Don't ee force un&mdash;no driggin' nor draggin', nor
slishin' nor slashin'! Ef ee du mind wot I says and keep at it
every day for a week or so you'll mebbe use a scythe pretty good
someday&mdash;mebbe. And now in the matter o' your
gratitood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, Mr. Toop, behold it!"</p>

<p>"Gorramitey!" exclaimed the old fellow, goggling at the coins
upon his horny palm. "Yere be a sight more'n I expected! I rackon
yu must be the gen'tleman sailor friend as come home a long o'
Cap'n Ned 'Arlow."</p>

<p>"'Home'!" repeated Sam, glancing away to a certain thatched roof
peeping above distant tree-tops. "By George&mdash;yes, home it
is...and growing more so every day!"</p>

<p>"Well then, sir, seein' as youm so powerful grateful, I'll come
'long frequent and larn ee arl as I can. And now, afore I goo, I'll
show ee 'ow tu keep a edge on scythe so sharp as razor. Gimme the
stone as lays yonder. So! Now lookee, lay stone pretty flat for to
gi'e un a good, longish edge, then stroke un easy like back and
forth, first o' one side, then t'other, kind and gentle, so and so!
Now I'll leave ee to it, young sir, wi' my thanks and best respex
till I see ee again, for I've worked yere at Willowmead for sixty
odd year and my Tom do work yere now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've met your Tom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay mebbe, but you 'aren't never met my Willum and never will
no'ow and nowhen for Willum were snatched up to Glory Everlastin'
by a cannon ball along o' Lord Nelson, God bless 'em&mdash;on the
<i>Vict'ry</i>. Well, good arternoon, sir!" So saying, Mr. Toop
touched his hat, nodded and hobbled away.</p>

<p>And now, heedful of the old man's words and example, and being
so patiently determined in all things, Sam truly began to
mow&mdash;watching the gleam and listening to the whisper of the
long keen scythe-blade as he swung it rhythmically back and forth,
cutting smoothly, cleaning with every leisured stroke.</p>

<p>Thus, heartened by achievement and taking joy in his labour as a
man should, Sam worked on through the long afternoon heedless of
time, heat, fatigue, and all else except the work in hand, until
evening began to fall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile...</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch120" id="ch120"></a>CHAPTER XX. HOW SAM LOST HIS
PIPE</h3>

<p>Seldom or never in all its many years had the cosy old farmhouse
of Willowmead held more joy or echoed to happier voices than upon
this same midsummer evening, for Captain Ned was safe home again
and had returned in triumph with a certain document that he now
spread out upon the table before his glad-eyed, momentarily
speechless Kate. A large, formidable-looking document this,
beautifully inscribed on fair parchment, couched in terms quite
incomprehensibly legal yet with many repetitions of such phrases
as: "Parties of the First Part" and "Parties of the Second
Part"..."As aforesaid," "In perpetuity," "As above mentioned,"
"Tenements and messuages," etc. etc.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" sighed Kate, flushed of cheek and radiant of
eye, glancing from this to Ned's happy face, and round about the
spacious parlour where Aunt Deb sat crocheting on one side of the
wide hearth while Mrs. Leet knitted on the other.</p>

<p>"Does this mean...oh, is Willowmead ours, Ned, really and
truly&mdash;for ever and ever?"</p>

<p>"Ay," he answered, stooping to touch her bright hair with his
lips, "every stick and stone of it, Kate, ours to have and to
hold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till death do you part!" added Mrs. Leet. "And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord, Anne!" exclaimed Aunt Deborah, "what horrid suggestion!
So odious!"</p>

<p>"And then," continued Mrs. Leet, imperturbably, "'twill be for
the heirs o' your bodies which will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me, Anne!" cried Aunt Deb, "what a suggestion! So
extremely&mdash;previous!"</p>

<p>"Which will be," continued Mrs. Leet, "perfectly right, proper,
hoped for and expected."</p>

<p>"Oh, Anne! And they aren't even wedded yet!"</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," pursued Mrs. Leet, serenely, "I suggest pigs, pigs
pay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Being so&mdash;well&mdash;prolific!" added Aunt Deb.</p>

<p>"And cows!" quoth Mrs. Leet, "a herd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With plenty of sheep!" nodded Aunt Deb. "We ought to have
flocks of nice, woolly sheep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;not!" quoth Mrs. Leet, clicking her
knitting-pins. "This should be a dairy farm pure and simple,
Deborah!"</p>

<p>"With sheep, Anne, sheep and lambs to flock and frisk! How say
you, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Yes to both!" he laughed. "But where's Sam? Sam must see this
portentous document and hear the news&mdash;where on earth is
he?"</p>

<p>"In the five acre meadow," replied Aunt Deb, "performing
powerfully and perspiring profusely upon a scythe, poor
dear&mdash;Gracious me&mdash;there's alliteration!"</p>

<p>"Sam? A scythe?" exclaimed Ned and Kate together.</p>

<p>"Now you're both doing it and so will I&mdash;so I tell you
again Sam's swinging a scythe as sailor should, so strongly that
his bronzed brow is beaded with the energetic efforts of his
excessive exertions."</p>

<p>"Why then," laughed Ned, "let's give him a hail before he sinks,
swoons and languishes o' labour. Come, Kate!"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Aunt Deb, "go fetch him, my dears, he has probably
mowed the whole meadow by now."</p>

<p>Thus it was that Sam, now master of this very difficult and
therefore fascinating implement, had paused to re-sharpen his blade
and glance back with no little satisfaction at the result of his
persistent and determined labour, when his ears were gladdened by a
clear, resonant, long-familiar hail:</p>

<p>"Ahoy&mdash;Sam! Sam, old hearty, stand by!"</p>

<p>And turning, he beheld Ned and Kate hastening towards him
through the radiant sunset glow.</p>

<p>"Old fellow&mdash;" began the Captain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ned dear," cried Kate, and both speaking together again;
and then:</p>

<p>"Sam, the expedition succeeded!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, Willowmead is ours, for ever and ever!"</p>

<p>"And the heirs of our&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Ned! Oh, Sam dear, when you tried to comfort my doubts
and bade me hope, I couldn't though I tried, because it seemed so
impossible. But now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, old shipmate, you are standing on our own particular bit
of Old England!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kate, taking him by one arm, "and mowing our very
own meadow, Sam&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In proof whereof," said the Captain, taking him by the other
arm, "yonder in our own farmstead, signed, sealed and attested is
a&mdash;no&mdash;the document, Sam, large as a
mizzen-tops'l&mdash;almost! Come and see."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" quoth Sam, heartily.</p>

<p>"Oh, but," said Kate, as they turned housewards, "your hat and
coat&mdash;where are they?"</p>

<p>"Athwart the field on the gate-post yonder."</p>

<p>"My gracious!" exclaimed Kate, as they crossed the meadow, "Sam,
what a lot you have mowed! I'd no idea you could use a scythe."</p>

<p>"Nor had I," he answered, "until old Mr.&mdash;" He paused and
stood gazing in mute surprise...for the glazed hat, the gaudy
neckerchief and smart, too-nautical jacket had given place to a
grimy, shapeless old cap and bedraggled something that had once
been a coat.</p>

<p>"Soho!" he murmured, glancing about instinctively. "Piracy,
b'Jingo!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Kate, "do you mean...someone has stolen your
clothes?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" he nodded, surveying these unlovely things askance,
"Though I suppose exchange is no robbery. However, my things are
gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So much the better!" chuckled Ned, "I can't imagine where or
why you got 'em, Sam! That jacket all jauntiness and buttons! That
ghastly scarf and the hat&mdash;like the dashing, jolly jack-tar in
that silly opera Black-eyed Susan!"</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, "that's where I got the idea."</p>

<p>"Well, they're a good riddance!" quoth the Captain.</p>

<p>"So they are, Ned. Yes, I'm well rid of 'em&mdash;ah but&mdash;"
Sam shook his head woefully.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Kate, "was there money in the pockets?"</p>

<p>"Only a guinea or so, but I shall grieve for my good old
pipe."</p>

<p>"Then I'll buy you another," said the Captain. "But now,
confound it all, sheet home, man, and bear away for our farmhouse,
Kate's and mine, and we'll drink to it, ay&mdash;to the future and
to each other, love and long life, Kate! Friendship and prosperity,
old fellow&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>And so, with happy Kate on one arm, his friend and captain on
the other, Sam went to this cosy, old farmhouse where lights began
to beam as the evening shadows fell.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch121" id="ch121"></a>CHAPTER XXI. DESCRIBES A "FAIRY
AUNT"</h3>

<p>The Five Acre was mowed smooth as a lawn and Sam perched upon a
gate was viewing this green expanse with prideful content; birds in
the leafy hedgerows round about him twittered drowsily, from the
shady orchard nearby thrush and blackbird piped melodiously yet no
sweeter than the clear, childish voice carolling this old song:</p>

<blockquote>"In Scarlitt Town where I was borned<br>
There was a fair maid dwellin'<br>
Made all the lads sigh well-a-day<br>
Her name was Bar-bree Alling."</blockquote>

<p>With this song on her lips, the sun bright in her hair and
Batilda tucked lovingly beneath her arm, Jane came seeking her
uncle, saying as she stood on tip-toes to be kissed:</p>

<p>"Auntie Kate said I'd find you here, so now I've come to take
you a walk."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Sweetheart," said he, slipping long arm about her,
"whereaway this time?"</p>

<p>"To the&mdash;Deep Dark!" she whispered, small finger to rosy
lip.</p>

<p>"'Oho?" he laughed. "That sounds nice and mysterious."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;yes awful' 'steerious, 'cause it's by the chanted
forest where my Fairy Auntie lives with her Esau."</p>

<p>"Good!" he nodded, "I'd like to meet a fairy."</p>

<p>So, hand-in-hand, away they went, by shady lane, over stiles,
across lush, sunny meadow where lazy cows blinked at them, puffing
fragrance as they chewed sleepily and flicked their tails
drowsily.</p>

<p>"You're not afraid of cows, eh, Sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"No. I like them lots 'cause they smell so nice and cow-y, and
they're always eating 'cept when they're being milked and sometimes
even then. Our Tom let me try to milk Daisybell once, she's the
oldest and has had lots of children, Tom says. Yesterday at supper
I tried to chew like a cow, sideways you know, only my Granny said
I might be struck like it an' grow horns, an' I shouldn't like
that. And why are you so changed, Uncle Sam?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Changed? D'you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I liked you more in your nice sailor's clothes, your shiny hat
and bright buttons!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" he questioned, glancing down at the neat stockings and
knee-breeches that now moulded his brawny limbs. "Did you, my Jane?
Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause now your legs look so 'normous and bumpy."</p>

<p>"Aha!" said he, chuckling. "But then just look at my lovely
shoes, Sweetheart, so trim and shiny&mdash;with real silver
buckles, too! So watch my buckles flash and forget my legs."</p>

<p>"But how can I when they're so long an' big?"</p>

<p>"However," said he, smiling down at her, "I hope my face is
still nice&mdash;in places, here and there, eh, my sweetness?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded, "'specially when you smile. And over there's
the Deep Dark, look!"</p>

<p>Now glancing whither she directed Sam glimpsed beyond tangled
thickets and lofty trees, a ruin of broken roof and crumbling
walls.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he murmured, halting suddenly. "You mean the old mill
pool, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you mustn't go a-nigh it 'cause my Granny says 'tis a
bad place waiting to drownd folks like it nearly drownded me once
long ago when I was only a child."</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam, clasping his arm about her,
instinctively. "How was that, my Jane?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I went with some other children to peep at it and they
pushed me in. So the Deep Dark took me and tried to drownd me dead
only my Fairy Aunt came down to me and took me out and dried me and
telled me tales and kissed me and took me safe home, that's how I
found her. And today I'll let you kiss her, if you like. Should
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he laughed, "I should like to kiss a fairy
aunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look!" said she again, pointing to a little shady coppice they
were approaching. "There's our 'Chanted Forest and in it there's a
great, big tree with 'normous waggly branches what was struck by
lightning so it's a magic tree. And my Fairy Auntie says if you
stand there in its shade and wish&mdash;it'll all come true, if
you're very good an' say your prayers an' wish hard enough, so I
did, and that's how I got my Batilda."</p>

<p>"By just wishing under the old tree, Sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I wished out loud and said my prayers every night and was
a good, p'lite, obedient child every day&mdash;'cept now and then.
So on my birthday my Batilda came to me by James Purvis, the
Carrier, in a great, big box tied with blue ribbon. So this time,
Uncle Sam, I'm going to wish for a nice big cradle for Batilda with
curtains, what rocks, 'cause in two days I've got another birthday
an' so has my Fairy Auntie, our birthdays are always together, and
I'll have growed myself to seven!"</p>

<p>They were close upon the coppice when from its green shadow
leapt a great, shaggy dog, such powerful, fierce-looking animal
that Sam instinctively took firmer clutch on the heavy stick he
carried and was about to snatch Jane up to his shoulder; but with a
cry of "Esau! Esau!" she sped forward and dog met child in a glad
and riotous greeting. And despite ferocious look, a dog of dignity
this who now quelling his joyful exuberance, sat down to proffer
one great paw, though with much flicking of tongue and thumping of
stumpy tail; having thus welcomed the child he advanced
stiff-legged and cautious, to take stock of the man, and they
surveyed each other like the strangers they were until a voice,
sweet though imperious cried:</p>

<p>"Friends, Esau&mdash;shake hands!" Instantly the dog obeyed, and
Sam, grasping his shaggy paw, glanced up to see Jane being clasped
and kissed by Andromeda&mdash;but this Andromeda glorified by a new
tenderness very lovely to behold, or so thought Sam as he stepped
forward, hat in hand, the great dog at his heels.</p>

<p>"Oh, Auntie Mee," cried Jane, "in two days I'll have growed
myself to seven and then it'll be your birthday too, so I've
brought you two lovely presents&mdash;and one's only just
me&mdash;here I am&mdash;and the other's my great, big, nice Uncle
Sam, and there he is, so if you want to kiss him like I do, I
shan't mind a bit&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sweet as trill of bird or ripple of brook Andromeda laughed, for
the first time in Sam's hearing, and showed the more beautiful for
the rich colour that swept from rounded chin to night-black hair,
or so thought Sam as her golden eyes met his in swift up-glance ere
their long lashes veiled their light.</p>

<p>"Oh, but...Jane dear," she laughed, "such great, big uncles are
only meant for little girls like you to kiss."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Jane, smoothing Batilda's somewhat rumpled
petticoats, "only he said how he'd like to kiss a fairy aunt an'
she's you, so&mdash;why don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not today, Jane dear."</p>

<p>"Very well, Auntie Mee, only if he ever kisses you you won't
please smack his face like our Nancy did to our Tom in the dairy,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I&mdash;might!" laughed Andromeda, with another swift
up-glance at silent Sam who now, laughing also, said:</p>

<p>"So you are Jane's mysterious lady, her wonderful 'Fairy Aunt'!
I might have guessed it."</p>

<p>"So now," said Jane, setting Batilda beneath Sam's ready arm,
"please let's all take hands and go into the 'Chanted Forest' and
I'll wish to our dear, old, magicy tree."</p>

<p>So, thus linked together, they entered the coppice, the great
dog pacing solemnly behind, until they came where stood a gnarled,
old oak tree, its massive trunk storm-riven and warped by Father
Time yet still hale and hearty, judging by the myriad leaves that
decked its knotted wide-flung boughs.</p>

<p>Here Jane stayed them and stole forward on tiptoe; and now,
standing beneath this aged tree, Jane did a quaint and Jane-like
thing, for clasping her small arms about its huge bole, she kissed
its rugged bark and laying her soft cheek against it, spoke to it
in her clear, young voice:</p>

<p>"Please, dear old Tree, I have come to wish you many happy
returns of my berfday in two days and please I do so want a nice
big cradle for my Batilda, with curtains, that rocks. So 'cause I
know you won't let me be dis'pointed, I'll thank you in my prayers
every night till I've growed myself to eight. So now thank you and
good-bye you dear, old Tree."</p>

<p>"A child's faith is very beautiful and touching," murmured
Andromeda.</p>

<p>"Very!" answered Sam. "She'll get her cradle, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by Purvis, the Carrier, on her birthday."</p>

<p>"I'm wondering what I can give her, Miss Andromeda?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know she hasn't a doll's house."</p>

<p>"Ay, b'Jingo, the very thing! Where could I get one?"</p>

<p>"Hush, here she comes! But I happen to be driving to Lewes
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed Sam. "Then will you, that is, could
you&mdash;would you allow me to go with you?"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind our shabby, old cart, Mr. Felton."</p>

<p>"Where, and when?" he enquired, almost eagerly.</p>

<p>"At the end of Willowmead Lane, about half-past ten."</p>

<p>"There!" cried Jane, returning to clasp their hands again. "Did
you hear our dear old Tree whisper me with all its leafs, like it
was saying: Yes, Jane dear, Yes-s-s? So now, Auntie, let's go an'
make a fire an' boil your big, black kettle an' brew
tea&mdash;though my Granny says I ought only drink milk&mdash;so
let's."</p>

<p>"But, Sweetheart, it isn't time for tea yet, or is it, Miss
Andromeda?"</p>

<p>"It will be, when the kettle boils. Though," said she, as they
began collecting dry sticks, "I suppose, being a sailor you prefer
ale and rum and such like, Mr. Felton?"</p>

<p>"Ay, but," he answered, "since coming to Willowmead, I'm
learning to appreciate tea though it seems uncommonly expensive at
twelve shillings the pound. Yet to be sure this is Sussex...a
free-trade country and everyone's a smuggler more or less, I
suppose. By the way, do you know the Willowmead folk, Kate, Aunt
Deborah, Grannyanne?"</p>

<p>"I've met them, but I know Mrs. Leet best&mdash;through little
Jane."</p>

<p>"When you saved her from drowning?" he enquired. "And in
that...that hateful pool."</p>

<p>"Yes. And it is a horrible place. I always avoid it. But that
day I was looking for Joshua who had wandered away, and got there
quite by accident and&mdash;just in time, thank God!"</p>

<p>"Ay, thank God!" repeated Sam, fervently. "She is such a sweet
little soul, ay, and I'm proud to tell you she adopted me the
instant we met, or very nearly."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Andromeda, gravely, "that was a great compliment
because Jane does not take to many people, for instance&mdash;poor
Uncle Arthur, she can't bear him."</p>

<p>"How is Mr. Verinder?"</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you. He is away at present. Staying in London
with friends."</p>

<p>"London?" repeated Sam. "Oh? Ah! And for how long?"</p>

<p>"He said a week, but it may be longer."</p>

<p>"And you," growled Sam, "in this desolation&mdash;alone!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I have my Esau dog. And I&mdash;like solitude."</p>

<p>"But have you no friends in London to stay with?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, stooping to pick up more firewood, "no, not
now. Besides, I prefer the country."</p>

<p>"So do I!" nodded Sam.</p>

<p>"And I'm such a very unsociable person."</p>

<p>"Same here!" nodded Sam.</p>

<p>"And I cannot make friends easily."</p>

<p>"Neither can I!" quoth Sam. "And that's what surprises
me&mdash;for here we are, d'ye see...making friends in spite of
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh?" she questioned, sitting back on her heels the better to
survey him. "Are we?"</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure," he answered, with his transfiguring grin, "or
we shouldn't be here gathering sticks together&mdash;it stands to
reason."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said she again, pondering this; then her ruddy lips
curving to the smile that was all too rare, she enquired, "Can
gathering firewood inspire friendship?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, but it can help, like a favouring breeze. Ay, and
friendship, d'ye see, is one of the truest blessings of this life!
So, Miss Andromeda, if you can so honour me you will bless me
also."</p>

<p>"But," she demurred, her golden eyes holding his steady grey,
"can a man and woman be and remain&mdash;only friends?"</p>

<p>"Ay, most certainly&mdash;speaking for myself, they can. For
d'ye see, Miss Andromeda, I'm a cove&mdash;a fellow who's run foul
of and&mdash;well&mdash;seen so much of&mdash;t'other thing and the
troublesome foolery of it, that nowadays I take mighty good care to
give that sort o' thing a wide berth, keep it well to loo'ard and
steer clear&mdash;if you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I do," she murmured, "if by that sort of thing,
you mean 'love'."</p>

<p>"Ay," he answered, rather grimly, "or that which goes by the
name in home ports and foreign all round this world. So, d'ye see,
Miss Andromeda, I'm a man you can trust as a friend and no more,
ever and always. So pray, what's your answer?" But at this moment
(of course) came Jane, her arms full of kindling wood, with Esau
pacing beside her, bearing in his powerful jaws a diminutive
twig.</p>

<p>And now Andromeda led them to a merry chattering brook that
guided them by devious leafy ways to a grassy clearing where stood
the luxurious caravan, the dingy tent and Joshua chewing busily as
usual.</p>

<p>"So then," quoth Sam, glancing around, "you have changed
camp!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we often do. Uncle Arthur can never bide in one place very
long, though we seldom go far from our dear Sussex and usually keep
on Wrybourne land."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam. "Ah? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because there's so much of it, I suppose, and besides, Uncle
knows the agent, a Mr. Joliffe."</p>

<p>"Ah!" nodded Sam. "And does he likewise know Lord Julian
Scrope?" Instead of replying Andromeda knelt and began arranging
sticks for the fire until Sam interposed, saying:</p>

<p>"No, please let me."</p>

<p>"Thank you! Then I'll go fill the kettle and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'll do that too."</p>

<p>"Very well. Jane and I will get the tea things and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Sam, kneeling to build the fire. "Do pray sit
down and be idle for once!"</p>

<p>Mutely she obeyed, crouching nearby with her work-roughened
hands folded in her lap, watching Sam very pensively.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, at last, "you know how to lay a fire."</p>

<p>"I ought to!" he nodded. "For when not aboardship I've lived in
some pretty wildish places, d'ye see."</p>

<p>"Tell me of them."</p>

<p>"Ay, so I will. But first let me say how glad I am you're
camping so much nearer Willowmead, and gladder still you have that
great, hairy ferocity&mdash;a regular fighting-dog by his
looks."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," she sighed. "Esau has saved me from...hatefulness
more than once. Last time a two-legged beast stabbed
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;a man?" demanded Sam, scowling.</p>

<p>"Of course. A horrible man who caught me alone...he had a dog
too...and he...but I called Esau...and when he had killed the dog,
he would have killed the man if I had not called and dragged him
off."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Esau!" quoth Sam.</p>

<p>"It was not until I had allowed the man to run away that I found
he'd stabbed my poor Esau so badly that I had to take him to Mr.
Bobbins in Lewes to be doctored."</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded Sam, "that's why I didn't see your Esau until
today. Well, I'm heartily glad he's such a savage creature."</p>

<p>"Yet he can be gentle too! Look at him now!"</p>

<p>Glancing whither she directed Sam beheld the dog crouched and
with Batilda between his big paws while Jane was twisting wild
flowers in his shaggy coat.</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, "a grand fellow despite his looks, Miss
Andromeda."</p>

<p>"A ragamuffin," she nodded, "with the manners of a courtly
gentleman. I bought him years ago from the gipsies for two
shillings. He was all eyes and hair and paws then, so very hairy
that of course I named him Esau. Then he grew and grew until,
well&mdash;there he is! Just what, or how many breeds is he, d'you
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Evidently all that's biggest and best," answered Sam, taking
out his tinder-box, "mastiff, retriever, sheepdog and bull most
likely&mdash;though I don't know much about dogs." Here Sam set
fire to the kindling that blazed with merry crackle. "So now," said
he, returning to his previous question, "does your Uncle know Lord
Julian Scrope, are they friends?"</p>

<p>"No!" she answered, vehemently. "Oh&mdash;no! Quite the reverse!
And I must ask you never&mdash;ah, never to mention that name in
Uncle Arthur's hearing, it affects him so...terribly."</p>

<p>"Ah?" murmured Sam, "then of course I won't. But&mdash;why
should it?"</p>

<p>"Because years ago, before I was born, I believe they had a
dreadful quarrel...I remember vaguely to have heard they fought a
duel."</p>

<p>"A woman, I suppose?" Sam enquired, gently.</p>

<p>"I...don't know."</p>

<p>"Could she have been the Lady Barbara Stowe?"</p>

<p>Andromeda started to her knees with hands outflung against him
in strange, wild gesture.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered. "Oh, hush! This is another name must
never be spoken! This is the dread, the terror that haunts me day
and night! Ah, what must I...what can I do?"</p>

<p>Now taking these outstretched, trembling hands in his strong,
warm clasp, Sam drew her nearer and strove to comfort her, saying
with look and tone very humbly gentle:</p>

<p>"Andromeda, tell me your fear, let me share your trouble as a
friend should. You poor, lonely child, honour me with your
confidence and trust...Is it...your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered and, with the word, all strength seemed to
fail her and she leaned to him, pillowing her troubled head upon
his breast and, with her face thus hidden, continued in whispered,
feverish haste:</p>

<p>"Sometimes he frightens me because I don't understand him...Not
long ago I found him rolling on the ground in a sort of fit, crying
on God for vengeance and, oh&mdash;clasped to him he had...the
pistol and he...was kissing it! When at last I coaxed it from him
and asked what he meant, he told me it was a means to God's
purpose&mdash;to rid the world of evil and that he only waited for
proof and then God would show him how and where and when. So that
night after he was asleep I crept away and threw the pistol into
that...dreadful mill pool. But since then he has bought others and
hides them from me now...And this terrifies me."</p>

<p>"Ay," murmured Sam, "you think, because of their old quarrel he
means to kill Lord Julian?"</p>

<p>"I...don't know! Don't ask me! But I'm so dreadfully afraid that
sometimes at night when the wind rustles the leaves I have to steal
out of bed to go and make sure he is sleeping&mdash;as he always
has been&mdash;so far, thank God! Yet some night when I'm asleep,
he may go...creeping...away in the darkness to some...awful
purpose. Yes, some night he may elude my care...and no one to help
me!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Sam, "I shall."</p>

<p>She had whispered all this in the strong comfort of his arms,
her cheek pillowed upon his breast, but now she lifted her head to
look up at him wide-eyed:</p>

<p>"You?" she whispered, "but how?"</p>

<p>Looking down at this lovely face, in especial these sensitive,
quivering lips, Sam was about to reply when they started and turned
to find Jane beside them who, nodding small bright head, enquired
casually:</p>

<p>"Are you kissing him, Auntie Mee, like I said you could?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh no!" answered Andromeda, rather breathlessly. "No,
dear, of course not."</p>

<p>"Well, you looked just as if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tea!" cried Andromeda, leaping afoot. "Tea, Jane! Come and help
me while your&mdash;your Uncle Sam fills the kettle and sets it to
boil, come!" So off they sped together, leaving Sam very grave and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>However, with a good deal of merry bustle and chatter,
especially on Jane's part, a dainty cloth was spread upon the
grass, then while Jane set out the crockery, Andromeda began
cutting thin bread and butter:</p>

<p>"Though," said she, ruefully, "I have no cake to offer you."</p>

<p>"Aha, but," quoth Sam, stoking the fire, "you have, or had, some
most delicious wild-strawberry jam, Miss Andromeda."</p>

<p>So tea was brewed and they began a meal the more joyous because
of Jane's merry, inconsequent chatter, until Esau, who of course
made one of the happy party, growled suddenly with show of sharp
white fangs while the hair on neck and crest seemed to rise and
bristle; and now it was that Sam pulled his hat lower above his
betraying scar.</p>

<p>"Someone is coming!" said Andromeda, glancing swiftly up and
round about, with expression so very like terror that Sam glanced
about also and with look threatening as the dog's growl.</p>

<p>"It must be a stranger," said Andromeda, huskily, "or...someone
he doesn't like. Esau, come here!" Instantly the great dog obeyed
and she grasped his brass-studded collar as somewhere amid the
surrounding thickets was a leafy rustle...growing louder, nearer
until&mdash;out from the undergrowth stepped a slim, elegant person
who, beholding Sam, halted suddenly, then glancing from him to
round-eyed little Jane, smiled and baring sleek, black head, bowed
with an odd though graceful writhing movement.</p>

<p>"Miss Andromeda," said he in tenor voice altogether too sweet
(or so thought Sam), "I fear you may deem this...my advent...an
intrusion." Nevertheless and even as he uttered the words, he
strode forward with a serene assurance at odds with his soft-spoken
words. "I was not aware...I could not know you would
be&mdash;entertaining company, or&mdash;" Here Esau growled again
and was silenced by his mistress who, glancing from her elegant
visitor to Sam in his yeoman-like homespun, made them known to each
other, saying:</p>

<p>"Mr. Jennings, this is...my friend, Mr. Felton."</p>

<p>"Friend?" questioned Mr. Jennings, softly but with shapely lips
grim as Sam's own. "Friend? Indeed! Mr. Felton should feel
extremely honoured."</p>

<p>"I do!" retorted Sam, "and I am!" Then he reached for another
piece of bread and butter while Mr. Jennings fidgeted nervously
with a portfolio he carried beneath his arm, yet when he spoke, his
voice though soft as ever, sounded vaguely aggressive, or so
thought Sam.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Andromeda, am I graciously permitted to join you? May
I sit down?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she answered, though almost before she spoke, down
sat he between Andromeda and Jane, who immediately shrank nearer to
Sam.</p>

<p>"Will you have tea?" enquired Andromeda, making to rise.</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" he answered, staying her with gracious gesture. "Thank
you, no, pray do not trouble yourself. I am here only to show your
Uncle Verinder another...and latest...composition of mine and to
crave his valued opinion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Jennings, I thought you knew he was away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed no, dear Miss Andromeda, I was not aware..." he
answered, gazing upon her almost possessively while his white hands
trembled, fumbling nervously as he opened the portfolio. "But since
Mr. Verinder is absent, perhaps you will be so good, so very kind
as to afford me your judgment upon my...my poor efforts...though
you will find them nothing very great, I fear." Saying this, he
gave Andromeda certain sheets of manuscript music beautifully
written and, while she studied them, sat watching her bold-eyed,
yet all the while his long pale hands were clasping and wringing
each other as in a very agony of nervousness.</p>

<p>And indeed a gentleman of violent contrasts was Mr. Jennings and
apparently at odds with himself; for beneath a dreamer's brow his
eyes, large and softly luminous, showed deeply sad and wistful,
while beneath jut of delicately aquiline nose, a mouth, shapely
though thin-lipped above long, pointed chin, had in its close,
down-trending curve something harsh, sneering and utterly
relentless.</p>

<p>An old-young man was Mr. Jennings, for though his face had the
ivory pallor of age, it was unmarked by any line or wrinkle, yet
his sleek, thick hair was touched with silver.</p>

<p>All this Sam noted as he sat munching bread and butter while
Andromeda studying this music, uttered such expressions as:</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Jennings, this passage in the minor is simply
heavenly! ...Oh, and this sudden change of key and tempo...so
unexpected! Almost terrifying!...Ah, but these arpeggios leading up
and up to the finale...These grand chords!...Mr. Jennings, this is
the best you have ever done or that I have seen, and truly
beautiful! I'm sure Uncle Arthur will tell you the same."</p>

<p>"Oh...Miss Andromeda!" he exclaimed breathlessly, leaning
swiftly towards her, his pallid face radiant, his lithe, shapely
body performing that graceful writhing movement which Sam thought
so peculiarly revolting. "Dear Miss Andromeda, do you...ah, do you
really...really think so?" he stammered, his great, sad eyes even
more beautiful now because of the sudden tears that gemmed and
softened them until&mdash;turning to meet Sam's lowering gaze,
these same tearful eyes took on a fierce glitter while the sweet,
soft voice no longer stammering, deepened instead to harsh menace,
or so it appeared to watchful Sam as Mr. Jennings addressed
him:</p>

<p>"Ah, do not mock me, sir! Do not contemn me for these tears
which spring from purest joy and gratitude that any work of mine
can evoke such kindly praise and&mdash;understanding. For this
little moment I am happy&mdash;almost. So, Mr. Felton...do
not...mock me!"</p>

<p>"Not I, sir!" answered Sam, gruffly. Here Esau thought fit to
utter another growl that ended in sharp-fanged snarl as Mr.
Jennings leaned slowly towards him, saying mournfully:</p>

<p>"Alas&mdash;even your nice, ugly dog hates me, dear Miss
Andromeda! I wonder why, for I never gave him cause. Indeed I
should greatly like to win his friendship, for even the love of a
dog would be a joy in such loveless life as mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;no!" she cried. "Don't touch him!" But she warned
vainly, for Mr. Jennings reached suddenly across her, laid his hand
upon Esau's shaggy head, a slender hand that stroked, patted, then
clutched bristling hair as the great creature, cowering beneath
this unwelcome caress, snarled fiercely and attempted to snap.</p>

<p>"Down, Esau, down!" cried Andromeda, striving to hold the
powerful animal.</p>

<p>"Let me!" said Sam, rising to his knees.</p>

<p>"Ah no!" sighed Mr. Jennings, tightening the grip of his long,
white fingers. "Pray do not trouble or be alarmed, he will not bite
me&mdash;he shall not! Dear me, no&mdash;I will not allow him. So
please let him rave and struggle till he weary, I have him quite
securely."</p>

<p>"Ay," growled Sam, "but he'll have you unless you cast loose and
sheer off&mdash;easy now!" So saying he took such grasp of Esau's
collar that the dog, aware of the power and mastery of this big
hand, ceased his fierce struggles, and bowing shaggy head,
whimpered and lay still.</p>

<p>"Ah sir," said Mr. Jennings in gentle reproach, "pray be more
gentle, do not hurt the poor creature on my account, I beg you, I
implore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need!" quoth Sam.</p>

<p>"Instead, sir," sighed Mr. Jennings, rising, "I will take my
departure."</p>

<p>"Ay, I think you'd better!" said Sam, ungraciously.</p>

<p>Mr. Jennings instantly sat down again and meeting little Jane's
wondering, round-eyed gaze, smiled.</p>

<p>"Little girl," said he, in tender, pleading tone. "Oh, Sweet
Innocence, could you...will you...bless me with a kiss?"</p>

<p>"No! Oh no...thank you!" she whispered, shrinking from his
outstretched hand with such very evident aversion that he cowered
also, hiding his bowed face in clutching fingers&mdash;then,
glancing up and around, with sudden, wild gesture:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;am I accursed?" he whispered through clenched teeth.
"First the dog, now the child! Am I so loathsome? So utterly
repulsive? Is there some hideous mark, some foul stain upon me that
all creatures shun me?...Lonely as a child, solitary as a youth,
desolate as a man...am I foredoomed, predestined to be for ever
loveless, friendless&mdash;an outcast?...Well, I have in music an
outlet for my grief, a comfort for my sorrows...And you, Miss
Andromeda, you at least can find a gentle word to greet
me&mdash;and for this your sweet mercy I am and shall ever be most
truly and very humbly grateful!" Cramming his manuscript back into
the portfolio, he leapt afoot, then stood hesitant, looking here
and there like one dazed and lost.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Andromeda," said he, at last, "kind and gentle
mistress, I&mdash;bid you good-bye&mdash;for the present! Mr.
Felton, sir&mdash;your servant." Having said which, he writhed at
them, turned and hastened away at such rapid pace that soon all
sound of him had died away. Then, loosing Esau's collar, Andromeda
enquired:</p>

<p>"Jane dear, why wouldn't you kiss that gentleman?"</p>

<p>"'Cause he made me all shivery cold."</p>

<p>"Same here, Sweetheart!" quoth Sam. "He's a very shivery sort of
customer."</p>

<p>"And I think," said Andromeda, "that he is a very sad gentleman
and greatly to be pitied."</p>

<p>"But I," Sam retorted, "I'm pretty sure he is a hysterical
fellow and could be deadly dangerous. So, consequently, I hope he
doesn't often trouble and spoil your solitude&mdash;with his 'dear
Miss Andromeda's,' confound him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but he does, Mr. Felton&mdash;I mean he visits us quite
frequently."</p>

<p>"Does he, b'Jingo? And why, pray?"</p>

<p>"For one reason because he is such a very clever musician. Uncle
Arthur esteems his compositions most highly."</p>

<p>"Ha!" growled Sam. "That's only one reason! What are the
others?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps because he is indeed a lonely man."</p>

<p>"However, he is no fit company for you, that's mighty
certain."</p>

<p>"Oh? Indeed, Mr. Felton!" she exclaimed, knitting her dark brows
at him. "And who are you to pass judgment?"</p>

<p>"Marm, I'm a fellow, d'ye see, who's roughed it ashore and
afloat, ay, and run athwart enough evil to know it on sight. Ay,
b'George&mdash;and I'm warning you as yon fine gentleman who can
weep for and pity himself so readily, would have small mercy on
anyone else. So, I'm warning&mdash;no, I'm begging you to give Mr.
Jennings a wide berth&mdash;I mean steer clear of him&mdash;that
is&mdash;discourage the fellow&mdash;no friendship&mdash;if you get
my meaning?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I can guess what you mean, Mr. Felton, and now I mean
you to understand that you must leave me to choose my own friends.
And I take it very ill in you to so vilify this poor gentleman
and&mdash;in his absence!"</p>

<p>"Marm, but for your presence he should have heard it to his
too-smooth face. Next time I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, there shall be no 'next time'!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" growled Sam, pondering this. "Ah! Just how must I take
that, pray? I mean to say what d'you mean&mdash;exactly?"</p>

<p>"That if you intend to insult this unhappy gentleman and in my
presence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not likely, marm."</p>

<p>"But I think it so very likely that I must ask you to...please
keep away from here."</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;good, Miss Andromeda! Ay, ay, marm, so be it. Though
I should like to know why you must call the fellow 'poor
gentleman,' so very tenderly?"</p>

<p>"Because I believe he is very sad, very lonely, and I pity him
deeply."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Sam. "And pity is akin to love, they say!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, you are presuming!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am. However, no one can ever call me 'poor gentleman,'
thank God!"</p>

<p>"No," she retorted, with flash of eye, "that would be quite
impossible!"</p>

<p>"Too true, marm," said he, rather grimly, "I'm only a seafaring
fellow and no fine gentleman, but I'm pretty sound and wide-awake,
and I tell you again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I beg you won't."</p>

<p>"Right-ho!" he growled and at his grimmest. "Thanks for the tea.
I'll slip my moorings and bear away."</p>

<p>"Thanks for nothing! And you'd better!" said Andromeda, at her
stateliest. So, for a moment they eyed each other; then as Sam made
to rise, Jane spoke:</p>

<p>"Ooh, Auntie Mee, you're frownding at my nice Uncle Sam an' he's
frownding at you an' you're bofe cross 'n' angry at each other, so
won't you kiss 'n' be friends again&mdash;just to please me?"</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," answered Sam, his grim features instantly
transfigured by that winning smile of his, "dear little Jane, I
should&mdash;love to and&mdash;not only to please you, my Heart's
delight."</p>

<p>"Well then, Uncle Sam, whyever don't you?"</p>

<p>"Because, my Jane, I've never kissed a fairy aunt and feel too
shy&mdash;so I'm waiting, ay, and hoping she will do her best to
please you by showing me how."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then, Auntie Mee, I suspose you'd better kiss him
first&mdash;he isn't hard to kiss 'cause his face is nice an' bare.
I don't like kissing hairy faces, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, I&mdash;Oh, I don't know&mdash;I've never
tried&mdash;" Andromeda's ruddy lips quivered, she smiled, she
laughed; then rising to her knees and reaching out her arms, said:
"Anyhow I had much rather kiss you&mdash;so come!" So, having
propped Batilda against a tussock of grass, Jane came to kiss and
be kissed&mdash;but in this same moment she reached out to Sam who
now rose also to his knees; and thus standing between them with her
small arms about both, she compelled them to each other, drawing
them slowly ever nearer, until&mdash;Andromeda closed her
eyes...</p>

<p>"There!" demanded this small so fateful person. "Wasn't that
nice an' easy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Sam, a little unsteadily, marvellously shaken by
a now unforgettable memory of the shy, soft caress of lips that had
met and quivered beneath his own. "Yes, Jane...my darling!"</p>

<p>"So now you're bofe friends again, aren't you, Auntie Mee?" But,
with sound that was neither sob nor laugh yet something of each,
perhaps, Andromeda kissed her again, saying:</p>

<p>"Now come and help me to wash up the tea-things&mdash;both of
you."</p>

<p>When this was done, and all too soon, thought Sam, a distant
church-clock, chiming the hour of six, warned him of the amazing
flight of time, he rose to be gone, saying awkwardly:</p>

<p>"Miss Andromeda, if we...or I...should chance to bear up for the
'Chanted Forest' now and then...and spy you in the offing...may I
hope to...find a welcome?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" she answered, lightly. "And especially from Esau,
he has accepted you...quite surprisingly."</p>

<p>"Dogs," quoth Sam, "are highly intelligent creatures and your
Esau being as wise as he's big knows honesty when he sees it and
whom he may trust&mdash;ay, and his mistress too! At sea," he
continued, his voice hushed now and solemn as his look, "we have a
saying&mdash;'there's a sweet, little cherub who sits up aloft to
look after the life of poor Jack' and...Miss Andromeda, I'm...I'm
wishing this same cherub, ay, and all the holy angels may look
after you and...have you in their keeping...ever and always."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she murmured, her eyes widening in surprise, as she looked
up into his grave face, "that sounded...almost...like a
prayer."</p>

<p>"It was!" he nodded. "And is!"</p>

<p>"Then," said she, giving her hand to his ready clasp, "I
think...I know now that Esau was right. So I shall trust you as he
does and accept you as my friend&mdash;most gladly, yes more gladly
than I can ever tell."</p>

<p>"And like Esau, I shall never fail you," he answered, looking
down at her slim, toil-roughened hand as if he meditated kissing
it.</p>

<p>"I know it," she answered, softly. "Yes, I'm sure of it.
But"&mdash;and here her lovely sensitive mouth quivered with her
rare smile, "shall you be obedient as he?"</p>

<p>"Almost!" answered Sam, smiling also. "But now, before I
go&mdash;mine isn't much of a name, I know, d'ye see, but will
you&mdash;I mean I should like to hear you say it."</p>

<p>"Sam!" she murmured, obediently.</p>

<p>"Ay," he nodded, "it can sound better than I thought. Good-bye,
until tomorrow morning&mdash;at the end of the lane."</p>

<p>"At half-past ten!" she added.</p>

<p>"Pray, how long should it take us to fetch up with Lewes?"</p>

<p>"Over an hour, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Good!" he nodded. Then, still looking down at her hand as if he
would have kissed it, he loosed it instead that she might bid Jane
farewell. Then, with this small personage perched jubilant upon his
shoulder, homewards they went, through the "Chanted Forest" where
birds near and far were already beginning their evensong, past the
Deep Dark gloomy and sullen, waiting with a dreadful patience for
that which was yet to be, and so at last to Willowmead as evening
shadows lengthened.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch122" id="ch122"></a>CHAPTER XXII. CONCERNING THE
"WHO" OF MY LORD, THE EARL</h3>

<p>"Miracles," quoth Mrs. Leet, throned this same evening in the
ingle, knitting in hand, "miracles still happen and wonders will
never cease!"</p>

<p>"Very true, Anne!" nodded Aunt Deborah, glancing up from her
tatting. "For indeed it is a monstrous and mighty miracle that any
clutching, clawing grimly-grasping, scoundrelly Scrope should ever
part with an inch of his ill-begotten heritage."</p>

<p>"Ah, but," said Mrs. Leet, "every now and then a good Scrope
happens somehow or other, and The Admiral was one, and a very good
one, too!"</p>

<p>"What Admiral, Anne? Who, what and when?"</p>

<p>"Lord Japhet Scrope, Admiral of the Blue, wounded in the three
days' battle with the Dutch off Beachy Head."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious, Anne! That happened so many years ago that
your Admiral must be very completely dead and dusty by now."</p>

<p>"Yes, Deborah, of course he is, good, brave gentleman. But The
Family lives on and maybe the good Admiral or his spirit has come
back to live again in our new, young Earl."</p>

<p>"Holy heavens, Anne, what an idea&mdash;so grim and ghostly, so
spookey and spectral!"</p>

<p>"But," said Captain Ned, glancing up from The Document whose
abstruse legalities still engaged him, "a very interesting idea,
Aunt Deb. The transmigration of souls has been argued long before
we hammered the Dutch off Beachy Head. However, this new earl must
be a pretty good sort of fellow, according to Mr.
Joliffe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Aunt Deb, Kate and Mrs. Leet demanded in chorus:</p>

<p>"What did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"Well first," answered the Captain, smiling at their so evident
curiosity, "that his lordship is a young man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is he tall and handsome?" demanded Aunt Deb.</p>

<p>CAPT. NED: Ay, he's pretty tall&mdash;a burly fellow, though his
looks are nothing in particular.</p>

<p>KATE: Is he dark or fair?</p>

<p>CAPT. NED: Neither, Kate. Mr. Joliffe's word was "darkish."</p>

<p>MRS. LEET (<i>Knitting-pins, suddenly idle</i>): Was he ever a
seaman, Ned? Did Mr. Joliffe tell you that?</p>

<p>CAPT. NED: No, Grannyanne, he merely said the Earl had been a
great traveller, has lived mostly abroad, is at present greatly
busied with family affairs, and that his first name, oddly enough,
is Japhet.</p>

<p>MRS. LEET: Ha! That was the Admiral's name! Yes, this was the
good Admiral's name! Did Joliffe tell you anything more of our new
Lord Japhet, his air, speech, manner?</p>

<p>CAPT. NED: Not a word, Granny.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Mrs. Leet, glancing where Sam, in corner of
the long, cushioned settle, was puffing thoughtfully at his
second-best pipe. "Well, what say you to all that, Grandson Sam?
Has Admiral Japhet, the good Earl, come back again as this new Lord
Japhet, think ye?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," answered Sam, meeting her keen scrutiny with his
flashing smile, "but if he shows anything like your old Admiral,
the poor fellow must look a regular-beetle-browed ruffian."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Captain Ned, folding up The Document very
carefully, "he has let us have dear, old Willowmead and for such
surprisingly moderate price that he must be better than his looks,
handsome or no."</p>

<p>"And a dear!" sighed Kate, glancing up and around with eyes
gladly bright. "Yes, he is&mdash;he must be a good Scrope, as
Granny says, a generous, kindly gentleman! I only wish I could
thank him. I shall if ever we meet and&mdash;if I dare."</p>

<p>"You will, m'dear!" quoth Mrs. Leet and with the utmost
finality. "Tell me, Ned, did Lawyer Joliffe say when the Earl would
be coming to The Great House, Wrybourne Feveril?"</p>

<p>"No, Granny."</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;where he is at present? You enquired, of course?"</p>

<p>"I did, but he evaded the question."</p>

<p>"Which does not surprise me. And may I know what you paid for
Willowmead?"</p>

<p>"Exactly one thousand pounds, Anne."</p>

<p>"Ha! Reasonable indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was prepared to offer double, ay and more!"</p>

<p>"However," quoth Mrs. Leet, "this doesn't surprise me
either."</p>

<p>"Why not, Granny, for it astonished me."</p>

<p>"Because, Ned, my Admiral was reputed to be generous as he was
brave, and Admiral Lord Japhet was an extremely valiant gentleman.
Ah well, well, 'tis time I was homing to my cottage with its
dratted leaky roof."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said the Captain, "for before you go we are all of us
going to drink a toast to Lord Japhet, Earl of Wrybourne&mdash;and
in something worthy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ned dear," said Kate, rising, "the special port wine you
sent me out of Spain, so long ago and we then so unhappy..."</p>

<p>Thus presently standing all and with glasses abrim, these dear
folk, so rare yet truly English (thought Sam) drank "health,
happiness and long life to their new, young Earl of Wrybourne."</p>

<p>Thereafter, Mrs. Leet having been tied into her vast bonnet by
Kate's gentle hands and received her club-like staff from Ned, took
Sam's ready arm and with him sallied forth into a fragrant night
radiant with stars.</p>

<p>"Hum!" quoth she, after they had gone a little way. "Ha! That
was very excellent port wine, Sam!"</p>

<p>"It was!" he chuckled. "I mind the time we took it out of a
French prize, for d'ye see, Granny, 'twas meant for Old Boney
himself."</p>

<p>"I can well believe it! Though such noble wine should not be
guzzled by such Beast of blood and suffering as Buonaparte!"</p>

<p>"Too true, Grannyanne!"</p>

<p>"Sam, we have left wonderful happiness there in Willowmead."</p>

<p>"And well they deserve it!" said he, fervently. "Ay, they do so
and indeed, Granny!"</p>

<p>"And how," she demanded, peering up at him in the dim starshine,
"how are you feeling tonight, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Hale and hearty, thankee Granny&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you should!" she nodded. "Ay, so you should, Sam, for never
in this world was toast drunk with deeper, truer
sincerity&mdash;Health, Happiness and long life to&mdash;my lord
Japhet, the Earl."</p>

<p>"Oh-ho!" murmured Sam, peering down at her.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" quoth Mrs. Leet; after which they walked some while in
silence.</p>

<p>"How glorious," said she, at last, "how bright and beautiful the
stars are tonight!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Grannyanne. I've seen them so many a night at sea. I think
they show better from the deck of a lonely ship."</p>

<p>"Maybe, Sam, maybe. But I'm hoping they are going to shine
brighter upon Wrybourne Feveril and bring more true comfort and
happiness to its many folk than ever they did through all the long,
past years. How think you, grandson Sam?"</p>

<p>"That you are right," he answered.</p>

<p>"Ay, I know it!" said she, nodding up at him, "and having the
power, what gladsome privilege to make this poor, old world a
little better...a happier place. That brute-man Buonaparte has
power, Sam, and just see how he is misusing it&mdash;the countless
dead and maimed, the breaking hearts and bitter tears, a devil's
work, Sam. Ah, but how godlike to use such power for the joy, the
comfort and preservation of the sorrowful, the weak and
helpless&mdash;instead of ruinous desolation, a flowery garden, in
place of tearful anguish, song and laughter...Well, here's my
cottage, so good-night, tall grandson&mdash;though I'm not sure I
should continue to name you so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grannyanne," said he, taking her hands, club-like staff as
well, "when you honoured and adopted me it was for good and all,
d'ye see&mdash;besides I shall need your wise counsel later
on&mdash;so as the years draw on they must only...draw us with 'em,
closer; ay, closer, d'ye see, Granny."</p>

<p>"Ha!" she exclaimed, almost fiercely. "Now for that I shall even
dare to kiss you&mdash;stoop, tall grandson, stoop! There
and&mdash;there again! Oh, what a world it is! I feel as happy
tonight&mdash;yes, even as your Captain and his Kate. Now
good-night, grandson mine, home with you and as you go&mdash;look
up at the stars and think of all there is to do."</p>

<p>Thus presently home went Sam, a very thoughtful Sam indeed.</p>

<p>Now as he walked the moon arose, making a pale glory all about
him.</p>

<h3><a name="ch123" id="ch123"></a>CHAPTER XXIII. TELLS HOW MURDER
STRUCK AMISS</h3>

<p>Sam was reaching to open the gate at Willowmead when he stood
instantly arrested, heavy stick clenched in ready hand, for, in
shadow of the tall hedge a denser shadow moved&mdash;then from this
imminent leafage a voice whispered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Hold 'ard, Mr. F., the word is&mdash;'Jarsper'!"</p>

<p>"Dammit!" exclaimed Sam pettishly, though greatly relieved. "Is
that you, Daniel?"</p>

<p>"Ar's me, sir! And I were to say as Jarsper needs ye very
special and immediate."</p>

<p>"What's he want? And at this time o' night?"</p>

<p>"You, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;but why?"</p>

<p>"Jarsper'll tell and likewise show ye."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Not s'very fur, sir&mdash;and I've got the gig handy."</p>

<p>"I'm asking you whereaway is Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Up along by Dickerdyke Spinney, sir."</p>

<p>"Never heard o' the place! Is it a mile away?"</p>

<p>"Ay and more, sir."</p>

<p>"Two miles?"</p>

<p>"Nearer six, sir, but I've got the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on!" And away strode Sam at great pace though Dan'l
kept beside him with no apparent effort.</p>

<p>"Here's a dev'lish time to be abroad!" growled Sam.</p>

<p>"Ay, sir. And yonder's the gig."</p>

<p>Into this vehicle they mounted forthwith and away they drove by
leafy by-ways fretted by pale moonbeams, through a bowery
countryside ghostly and all unreal in this pallid radiance.</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me what Jasper wants with me at such an
hour?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, I could but, orders being so, 'twouldn't do
nohow."</p>

<p>"Shrig is always so confoundedly mysterious and
over-cautious!"</p>

<p>"Mebbe so, sir. But then&mdash;mebbe not. And sir, I notice as
you ain't rigged in your sailorly duds&mdash;coat, sir, 'at, sir,
nor yet your fine neckerchief."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ar! You give 'em away, sir, p'raps?"</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Then mebbe they was took, p'raps, nabbed, filched or
stole?"</p>

<p>"Ay. And my favourite pipe along with 'em."</p>

<p>"Bad luck, sir! Hows'ever, seamanly duds ain't particklar
healthy in these yere parts! So mebbe 'twas all for the best,
sir."</p>

<p>"Eh? Daniel, just what d'you mean?"</p>

<p>"Jarsper'll explain, sir."</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;damme!" exclaimed Sam as a distant church clock struck
eleven. "How much further?"</p>

<p>"Top o' the 'ill yonder, sir, then down along by the
spinney."</p>

<p>"And a cursed odd hour to be meeting in dam' spinneys, or
anywhere else!"</p>

<p>"Ay, so 'tis, sir. But the carcumstances is precious odd,
sir&mdash;and growing odder!"</p>

<p>They topped the long hill at last and turning down a narrow
by-way, rounded a sharp bend and thus beheld Mr. Shrig seated on
grassy bank and puffing his short, clay pipe.</p>

<p>"Eighteen minutes and a bit!" said he, rising as the gig drew
up. "You've been pretty slippy, Dan'l! Greetings, sir and pal! I've
had Dan'l fetch you along so as I could show and prove t'ye as your
pal J.S. don't paint no roses, gild lilies nor yet cry 'fire'
without doo cause."</p>

<p>Sam frowned and shook his head, saying:</p>

<p>"Jasper, you're too dam' mysterious as usual! Be plain, for I
haven't the vaguest notion what you're&mdash;" Sam's voice died
away and he stood mute and strangely disquieted; for Mr. Shrig's
head was bare and, perhaps because of the ghostly light for the
moon now stood right above them, Mr. Shrig's face placid no longer,
showed strangely pale and haggard as slowly he turned and moved
aside.</p>

<p>"Pal," said he, pointing with his stick, "take a peep at
this!"</p>

<p>Sam looked&mdash;gasped, recoiled suddenly and caught his
breath, yet staring down in horrified amazement at a frightful
object that sprawled half in shadow, a ghastly, blood-soaked
something had once been a powerful, burly man but whose face was
now only a flattened, dreadful smear; but beside this shattered
head lay the glazed hat; about the gory throat was the neckerchief,
its gaudy design of anchors blotted out here and there; buttoned
across the broad and motionless chest was the jaunty
coat&mdash;that too smart, fatally betraying jacket with its rows
of gleaming buttons...</p>

<p>"God&mdash;Almighty!" whispered Sam, at last. "It might
be&mdash;me!"</p>

<p>"Ar!" nodded Mr. Shrig. "There you lay, pal, or so I thought,
and small vonder, seeing as this yere misfort'nate cove is rigged
as I see you last and his face shot off into the bargain!
Ay&mdash;there y'are!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sam, hoarsely, "even now...he looks the very image
of me."</p>

<p>"Ar!" sighed Mr. Shrig. "So werry much so that b'goles&mdash;it
give me quite a turn! Even arter I rolled him over, him laying face
down'ards&mdash;even then, pal, seeing his chivvy is all blowed
off, I could ha' took my oath as he was you&mdash;till I noticed as
his right daddle lacked a finger, as you can see. Yet still I
couldn't be quite sartin sure, because fingers can be shot off
easier than faces."</p>

<p>"Jasper, I've seen many, too many dead men in my time,
but...nothing worse than this! A fowling-piece and fired at close
quarters, eh, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pal, his murderer stood just behind yon bush, his tracks
is werry plain."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" murmured Sam. "Poor, unlucky cove&mdash;for if
our suspicions are right, he died of&mdash;my hat and coat."</p>

<p>"Nary a doubt o' that, pal. Said hat and coat marked you for
death so soon as Tobias J. tipped the office to&mdash;US knows
OO."</p>

<p>"Well?" enquired Sam, turning from this horror, "what now?"</p>

<p>"Now, sir and pal, this yere poor relic must&mdash;wanish! The
Law shall take charge of it and&mdash;all unbeknown to a living
soul except The Law and us. Ar, and unbeknown it shall remain till
I lays my awenging daddle on its murderer!"</p>

<p>"Ay, and what must I do?"</p>

<p>"Nary thing, sir and Sam, except con-tinny to lay low."</p>

<p>"But, Jasper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, take another peep at our misfort'nate relic and be dooly
varned! Creeping Murder has crawled and struck wrong but thinks it
has struck right! Werry good! So let it think, ar&mdash;and so must
it think till 'tis fast in my trap, stuck tight to my twig or
wriggling wainly on my hook! So now, sir, while I sit yere along o'
this werry de-funct party oo might ha' been you but for
ass-tounding luck, Dan'l shall drive ye back to Villersmead and
pleasant dreams&mdash;I hope! Good night, pal, and thank your stars
for a poor thief as saved your precious life."</p>

<p>"Ay, Jasper, so I do indeed! Good night&mdash;no,
first&mdash;how did you chance to find the poor fellow?"</p>

<p>"Not b'chance, pal, 'twere obserwation, sir! I've other eyes
besides mine and Dan'l's vatching over ye now. So ever since yon
poor cove nabbed your clobber he's been trailed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How? You saw him steal my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not me, Sam pal, 'twere other ogles as see the fact, other feet
as follered in hopes as in your garments he'd lead us to US knows
OO&mdash;vich he might ha' done if he hadn't dodged too clever and
so got hisself shot thereby&mdash;and unseen, more's the pity! Good
night, sir and Sam pal, and remember, more than ever now, the vord
is Caution, vith a werry large C."</p>

<h3><a name="ch124" id="ch124"></a>CHAPTER XXIV. OF TWO IN A
FOUR-WHEELED CART</h3>

<p>In this busy old world, besides the woeful discordancy of man's
evil to man, there are, thank God, many lovely sounds to charm the
ear, warm the heart and gladden the soul; and yet (thought Sam)
never a one of them all, and especially upon this particular summer
morning, so gladly welcome as the steady, very deliberate clip-clop
of hoofs with the creak and rattle of a certain weather-beaten,
four-wheeled cart. Though Sam, the dunderhead, had no idea why this
should be so&mdash;as yet! Not even when Joshua was reined to a
stop and Andromeda was smiling down on him; nor when he was seated
beside her and so near that their knees and shoulders touched
whenever this small, rickety vehicle jolted over some rut or stone,
no&mdash;not even then!</p>

<p>"Of course," said Andromeda, poking this sleek, very deliberate
Joshua with the whip to no apparent effect, "the question is, Mr.
Felton, just how much money you wish to spend."</p>

<p>"Money?" he repeated, glancing at her profile&mdash;delicate
line of nose, full, ruddy lips and rounded chin.</p>

<p>"Yes, for little Jane's birthday present."</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure. Well, anything you think right."</p>

<p>"You can buy quite a good doll's house for about&mdash;ten
shillings."</p>

<p>"Ay, but I want the best, d'ye see, something worthy of our
Jane."</p>

<p>"Then naturally that will cost more."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sam, eyeing a wind-blown curl apeep below the brim
of her small, close bonnet, "I thought&mdash;about five or six
pounds."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she exclaimed, turning to look at him and thus
becoming aware of his intent gaze, looked away again. And now
except for the creak and rattle of the cart, they travelled in
silence awhile, yet a very pleasant companionable silence until, as
by mutual consent, glancing at each other again, she smiled, as did
Sam; then with her lovely mouth thus up-curving:</p>

<p>"Five pounds would be ridiculous!" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh? Why, pray?"</p>

<p>"Because it is a great deal too much!"</p>

<p>"It can't be," he answered, "for, d'ye see, I owe our small,
sweet Jane so very much more. Now will you please ask me how and
why?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Andromeda, and though she smiled again, the rich
colour deepened in her cheek. Here ensued another brief silence;
then, quoth Sam, wistfully:</p>

<p>"You haven't said it once, yet!"</p>

<p>"I know I haven't."</p>

<p>"I mean my name."</p>

<p>"Of course!" she nodded. "Nor have you uttered mine&mdash;though
'Andromeda' is such a very awkward name."</p>

<p>"Yet it suits you&mdash;that is&mdash;what I mean is&mdash;it's
beautiful, though it would be easier said&mdash;without the
'miss'," he suggested, almost shyly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed, "at least it would be that much shorter."</p>

<p>"Then will you&mdash;would you mind&mdash;may I&mdash;" Sam
floundered and she let him, until, words failing, he was
dumb&mdash;while the cart rattled and creaked as if in derision;
then above its clatter&mdash;sudden, unexpected yet ineffably sweet
rose her laughter, ending all too soon, as she answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam, you may. And I'll call you 'Sam'&mdash;though to be
sure it seems quite too shockingly familiar, considering we
scarcely know each other."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we do!" quoth he.</p>

<p>"Having met each other exactly three times!" she retorted.</p>

<p>"Ay, too true!" he admitted. "But then, d'ye see, ours is to be
a friendship that shall never hope or ask for anything more,
Andromeda."</p>

<p>"Never?" she demanded, turning to regard him with her level,
calmly-appraising glance.</p>

<p>"No, never!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"But you are a sailor, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am&mdash;or was. And how then?"</p>

<p>"Don't sailors&mdash;have wives in every port?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and that's my trouble! I never have and never could take
women lightly enough, d'ye see. That's why I very nearly ran foul
of wedlock twice and weathered it each time by a miracle."</p>

<p>"Oh?" enquired Andromeda, quite unaware that Joshua's leisured
trot had become a lazy amble. "Tell me of it, if
you&mdash;can."</p>

<p>"Ay, willingly," he answered. "Yes, you'd best know the sort of
fool I am. The first time was in Old Mexico, a Spanish
donna&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was she young and beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Both!" he nodded. "Ay, she was indeed! A devout Catholic and
seemed too good, ay&mdash;too pure and holy for such rough fellow
as myself&mdash;I was only a fore-mast jack, then. But...I
discovered she was...well...so unspeakably the reverse that I came
pretty nigh death. For, like the young fool I was I'd taken it
all&mdash;too seriously! So I shipped aboard a regular floating
hell, hoping to die. But 'twas others did the dying and I ended
that voyage as master's mate. The second time, ay, and the last,
happened when I was prisoner o' war in France...she was a lady too
and kindly gentle as she was beautiful and I, like the too-serious,
dam' fool I am, broke my fool heart again&mdash;or nearly so."</p>

<p>"Why...Sam?" Two words only, but in their soft utterance was
that which lifted Sam's bowed head, banished his painful frown,
softening his grim features so wonderfully that in this moment, as
he turned to look at her, he seemed younger than years of hardship
had made him, and&mdash;yes, almost handsome, or so it seemed to
this woman whose calm, deep eyes were so quick to see and
determine. Also when now he spoke her name it was in voice gentled
and deepened with gratitude.</p>

<p>"Andromeda...then you know? You understand how such fool as
I...can suffer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, softly, "yes...and I know that a fool never
did or ever could feel such grief."</p>

<p>"Andromeda," said he again, and both of them totally unaware
that Joshua, this artful creature, had stopped to graze, "you are
and have been a constant surprise to me ever since we met."</p>

<p>"Such a little while ago!" she reminded him, with her grave
smile. "But tell me of the French lady, was she&mdash;like the
Spanish?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, for d'ye see, contrariwise, she was a wife already
and the Spanish lass should have been."</p>

<p>"I see. And so you were a prisoner in France?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But enough of me, pray what of you?"</p>

<p>Here Andromeda becoming aware that the cart was motionless,
poked Joshua to his leisured trot and enquired:</p>

<p>"What would you know of me?"</p>

<p>"Everything!" answered Sam, promptly. "Or&mdash;as much as
you'll honour me by telling. I'd greatly like to know why you
always look so sad, yes&mdash;even when you smile?"</p>

<p>"Do I?" she questioned. "I didn't know it...the looking-glass in
my tent is very small and I don't use it often. I'm growing too
careless of myself, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said forthright Sam. "You are."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;indeed?" she exclaimed, flashing her golden eyes at
him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, "and more's the pity because you are shaped
so...so very beautifully."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she demanded, glancing from him down at the
garments whose shabbiness was the more manifest because of the
splendours they half revealed; so much so that she spread their
close, betraying folds with whip-hand and gracefully dexterous kick
of slim foot, then flushing consciously, looked at him defiantly,
saying casually, "This happens to be my marketing dress and quite
good enough for me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" said he, almost harshly. "It's nothing like good enough
for you, Andromeda, any more than that tent! B'George, I hate to
think of you in that flimsy thing&mdash;at night."</p>

<p>"But I like it!" she retorted. "Day or night...perhaps because I
was born in a tent."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said she, turning to face him. "My mother Rosalind
Verinder committed the social crime of marrying an inferior, or so
her family deemed it&mdash;she ran away with an actor, though they
called him a strolling player and vagrant! And so he was, I
suppose, though he had his own travelling company and was a great
actor&mdash;the Robert Sheldon Players were famous
everywhere&mdash;except London. However, my poor mother was outcast
by her family, the Verinders were too proud of their ancient
lineage ever to acknowledge her again."</p>

<p>"Was your brave mother happy?"</p>

<p>"Supremely and my poor father was devoted to her."</p>

<p>"Then, outcast or no, she did right well."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was very happy, though not for long, she died giving
me life&mdash;I killed her, and my father too, almost. For when she
died all the best of him died too. He lost all ambition...became a
hopeless drunkard&mdash;though always kind and gentle to everyone,
especially to me&mdash;Oh, the poor, poor dear! So from famous
actor and master of all, he sank to last and the willing drudge of
all&mdash;oh, the pity of it."</p>

<p>"Ah, and what&mdash;what of you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I lived somehow until I was old enough to&mdash;take care
of him...he became my great, big helpless child...until he died.
And then I should have been lost! But then...ah, then, by God's
mercy, my Uncle Arthur found me, my wonderful, rich uncle&mdash;ah,
he was very different then, so vital, so grandly masterful&mdash;he
swept me up and away from all that sordid misery&mdash;to the
wonder and luxury of his great house. He loved me, had me educated,
yet taught me far more by his own inspiring genius. He took me to
all the great centres of art in Europe, opened to me the glorious
world of music. He was, oh, so much more to me than a father that
when ruin came, loss of money and the woman he adored&mdash;when he
was stricken, as you see him now, and all friends except very few,
deserted him&mdash;can you, do you wonder that I devoted myself to
him, to shield and care for him in his helplessness, as I always
must and shall&mdash;do you wonder that I love and shall serve him
so long as he needs me?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Sam, though rather gloomily.</p>

<p>"Well then, why are you frowning?"</p>

<p>"Because," he answered, heavily, "you are indeed Andromeda! For
according to what Ned tells me, he's a classical scholar, d'ye see,
the first Andromeda was exposed as a&mdash;a willing sacrifice for
others."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Andromeda, "if I am or&mdash;must be a sacrifice,
I also shall be willing...even though it break my heart at
last."</p>

<p>Here for some while the cart rattled its four wheels and creaked
its worn timbering while Joshua from lazy amble betook him to
lazier walk and all unheeded for Sam was thinking unhappily of
Andromeda and she stealing sideways glances at his grimly woeful
visage and guessing the reason therefor, roused him at last with
the question:</p>

<p>"Were you at Trafalgar and have you been in many battles?"</p>

<p>Hereupon Sam (as only English sailormen usually do, unless
inspired by Bacchus) told the dashing exploits and valiant deeds of
shipmates with scant mention of himself until she "brought him up
with a round turn," demanding:</p>

<p>"Yes, but how did you get that ugly wound&mdash;there above your
left eyebrow, Sam?"</p>

<p>Over this betraying scar he instantly jerked his hat-brim,
saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"It was either a Froggie's pike, cutlass or musket-butt, I could
never be sure which, the time we boarded the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Horse-hoofs on the narrow road behind them and approaching at
such furious gallop that Sam turned, in angry alarm, while
Andromeda reined aside and only just in time as a horseman dashed
by in cloud of dust, a wild figure who glanced back at them from a
face contorted and streaked very oddly.</p>

<p>And when this choking cloud had subsided, Sam enquired:</p>

<p>"Did you notice who that was?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;the hateful Honourable Scrope."</p>

<p>"Ay, and looked as if he had been weeping&mdash;shedding tears
and plenty of 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam. But can such man ever shed tears? If so, I hope they
sting."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch125" id="ch125"></a>CHAPTER XXV. OF ANDROMEDA, SAM,
AND FRIENDSHIP</h3>

<p>The doll's-house had been purchased, though indeed this was a
veritable palace in miniature and as sumptuously furnished even to
pictures on the walls; a toy of such dainty splendour that
Andromeda (despite its costliness) clasped her hands and exclaimed
for sheer feminine joy of it.</p>

<p>This magnificence having been duly packed and stowed in the
cart, Sam decided they must both wine and dine&mdash;unheeding
Andromeda's protestations that she was not hungry, was too
untidy...dusty...in her very oldest bonnet...However, Sam's
sailorly eye having singled out the White Hart Inn&mdash;thither he
led her; and once within these hospitable portals, no high-bred
lady in all Christendom more sweetly dignified, more stately and
gracious than Andromeda despite her aged bonnet.</p>

<p>Thus with obsequious waiters to attend, they enjoyed such meal
that Sam, because of its growing intimacy, was to remember with a
wistful yearning&mdash;such meal that Andromeda even forgot her
aged bonnet, or very nearly.</p>

<p>This magical repast ending, too soon of course as all such
happiness must, forth they went into the busy street that Andromeda
might do her marketing. Now while she was thus busied, Sam chancing
upon a jeweller's shop entered forthwith and accosted the presiding
genius, who beamed on him through a ferocity of curling
whisker:</p>

<p>"I want something in diamonds&mdash;not too overpowering."</p>

<p>"Sir," quoth the jeweller, exhibiting a circlet of flashing
gems, "behold the very article!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Sam. "Nothing like it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the jeweller, grasping the whiskers with
restraining hand. "You desire something less expensive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" answered Sam. "Something less showy."</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed the jeweller, releasing the whiskers. "Then
here, sir, behold this brooch or pendant, a perfect work of art, or
should we say 'heart'&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;being indeed a heart
involved or enwrought with a cross for Truth and an anchor for
Hope."</p>

<p>"Yes, this'll do!" nodded Sam, thrusting hand into pocket. So,
the brooch being paid for, was neatly boxed and away rolled Sam
with his seaman's lurch, and was pondering just how and when he
should bestow this gift when Andromeda rejoined him. He was still
meditating this vexed question when the cart was rattling and
creaking under them, and so profoundly that she questioned him at
last:</p>

<p>"Why are you so thoughtful&mdash;or is it only drowsiness? I'm
sleepy too...For I seldom or never take wine..." Here she yawned
behind slim fingers and quite bewitchingly, or so thought
Sam&mdash;as he answered:</p>

<p>"Well then, why not have a nap?"</p>

<p>"I should love to...but how can I?"</p>

<p>"By closing your eyes, in the wood yonder, or any other shady
place. I'd take care nothing and no one disturbed you, though you
know that, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, meeting his look with her serenely direct
gaze, "and I haven't been sleeping very well, lately." Now here,
there rushed upon him the dreadful memory of that ghastly,
blood-stained thing he had looked down upon last night...</p>

<p>"Andromeda," said he, impulsively, "I hate to think of you so
utterly alone in your camp...that wilderness!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but," sighed she, looking up at him slumberously, "I'm a
very light sleeper&mdash;when I have not had wine, of course!
Besides I have my Esau dog. I left him on guard in my tent...and
there he will be...waiting to greet me, bless him!"</p>

<p>"Ay," growled Sam, "thank God for those sharp fangs of his!"</p>

<p>"Yes, though I'm never afraid&mdash;except for Uncle Arthur. And
today...just for the present, even that dread is...soothed away...I
never felt so...deliciously sleepy! So, won't you please take the
reins?"</p>

<p>"I'd much rather take you into the shade where you can lie and
sleep properly...know complete rest if only for a little
while."</p>

<p>"I should love to!" she murmured. "Oh, I ought not to have
drunk...so much wine."</p>

<p>"You should have drunk more, Andromeda. You are mentally
exhausted. I'll warrant you slept little, last night."</p>

<p>"Not very well," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Then you shall sleep here and now."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I couldn't...it would be too ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"But very sensible, Andromeda. You're dead beat with anxiety and
constant worry. So now&mdash;lean against the seat-back and my
shoulder! And if I set my arm about you it will be only because I'm
compelled to save you from lurching overboard&mdash;into the road,
d'ye see! There&mdash;are you quite comfortable? You don't look it,
but&mdash;are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, drowsily.</p>

<p>"Then," said he, setting long arm about her, "close your eyes
and sleep." The which she did, and so profoundly that once or twice
she snored, though very gently to be sure...</p>

<p>Now looking down at this sleeping face too strong and resolute
for prettiness, too haggardly pale for beauty, Sam felt the heart
within him surge and swell, his eyes grow dim, his arm tighten
about her&mdash;yet still the dunderhead fellow didn't guess.</p>

<p>Thus at a plodding walk they traversed these leafy by-ways and
the vociferous cart now so hushed and silent that Sam could hear
Andromeda's soft, slow breathing that told of deep, untroubled,
soul-refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>How often he looked down at this head now pillowed on his
breast, at this face with its black, low-arching brows, these
wide-set, long-lashed eyes, this gently-aquiline nose and
well-rounded chin that, together, held more than suggestion of
indomitable will and courage, though softened by the sensitive,
full-lipped, ruddy mouth all sweet curves and so lusciously
provoking that he averted his eyes and stared at Joshua's ears
instead, though it is doubtful if he noticed them. Yet so long and
fixedly he gazed that he was unaware the sleeper had waked until
she spoke, and almost gaily:</p>

<p>"Goodness, how he scowls! Am I such a burden?" Sam started and
Andromeda sat up to smooth her petticoats, glance around and
enquire:</p>

<p>"How ever long have I slept?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely half-an-hour."</p>

<p>"My gracious, and we are not half-way back! Joshua must have
crawled."</p>

<p>"He did, lest he should wake his mistress."</p>

<p>"And don't tell me she&mdash;snored."</p>

<p>"Only now and then, and very sweetly!"</p>

<p>"Can any snore be sweet?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon the snorer."</p>

<p>"However, I feel wonderfully better for my sleep. But now, since
there is no possibility of my falling, or&mdash;'lurching
overboard'&mdash;was it? I think you can venture to release
me."</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure!" said he, withdrawing his arm.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she murmured, straightening her bonnet,
"considering how long you have been embracing my slumbering form, I
ought now to be all blushing, maidenly coyness, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" he answered. "Why should you?"</p>

<p>"The question is," she demanded, looking up at him with her
gravely wistful gaze, "why shouldn't I and why don't I?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered Sam, believing he spoke merest truth, "the
arm around you was simply the arm of a friend."</p>

<p>"Ah yes!" she murmured. "To be sure, yes. I'm glad you&mdash;did
not forget."</p>

<p>"Of course not!" quoth Sam, with a vehemence that surprised
himself. "Certainly not! As though I ever should&mdash;or
could!"</p>

<p>"Is it so unthinkably impossible&mdash;Sam?"</p>

<p>"Quite!" he answered, with the same excess of fervour.
"Oh&mdash;quite! This is why I ventured to buy you a small gift, a
keepsake, a memento of the occasion, d'ye see&mdash;" So saying he
produced, opened and presented the jewel-box, in as many
moments.</p>

<p>Motionless and silent Andromeda gazed down upon it, then closed
her eyes as if the flash and sparkle of the gems had dazzled her,
while up from round, white throat to raven hair rose a painful
flush; then with sudden, almost fierce gesture she thrust this gift
back into his unwilling hold, saying as she did so:</p>

<p>"This would be too absurdly out of place on me...my general
shabbiness would be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Sam harshly.</p>

<p>"Yes!" she retorted, positively. "Your jewels would be
ill-suited to me as Shakespeare's 'pearl in an Ethiope's ear'."</p>

<p>"Don't you like the thing?" growled Sam.</p>

<p>"Of course I do! Yes! Any woman would love it...Only this woman
cannot accept it."</p>

<p>"Then, damme, I'll throw it away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't do that. And, Sam, do&mdash;not&mdash;swear! Instead,
let me look at it again." So, once more she sat gazing down at
these sparkling gems that were no brighter than her eyes, nor so
lovely as the smile that slowly curved her sensitive lips&mdash;or
so thought Sam, who now ventured to explain his gift:</p>

<p>"The anchor, d'ye see, stands for steadfast hope and the cross
for faith&mdash;truth everlasting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, "but what does this heart mean?"</p>

<p>"Friendship!" he replied, instantly. "Unfailing loyalty,
reverence and friendship. And it is in their name that I beg
you'll&mdash;honour me by accepting their token."</p>

<p>"Then," said Andromeda, closing the box and folding it between
her two hands, "in their name I will and do accept it...gladly and
more...gratefully than I can tell&mdash;" Here she turned to smile
up at him though her eyes brimmed with tears bright as any
jewels.</p>

<p>"But, Andromeda, why are you crying?"</p>

<p>"Because at last I do, I must believe such reverent friendship
is real and true. And so," said she, giving him her two clasped
hands, "now with your token I take you for my friend...I that was
so terribly, bitterly alone yet never allowed myself to realize
it...because I have always known I must be lonely. So I shall wear
your precious gift...round my neck...hidden...upon my heart."</p>

<p>Now looking down upon these hands that nestled so confidingly in
his, Sam stooped and kissed them&mdash;hard, and yet so reverently
that, though her lips quivered to a smile, her voice matched her
tearful eyes as she enquired:</p>

<p>"Was that for merest friendship&mdash;Sam?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "Yes&mdash;indeed!"</p>

<p>"But mine are not kissable hands&mdash;so rough and two broken
nails!"</p>

<p>"Ay," said he, very gently, "these are hands glorified and made
holy by unselfish devotion and service. My beloved mother had such
hands-though I never thought to kiss them."</p>

<p>"Tell me of her, Sam."</p>

<p>And so, while Joshua ambled at his laziest pace, even pausing
when so minded to crop succulent mouthfuls of grass, Sam with all
his heart, told of his most sacred memory while with all her heart
Andromeda listened and questioned.</p>

<p>And never had any cart, on four wheels or two, borne a man more
glad to be alive, through countryside so altogether lovely; though
Sam, the addle-pate, still had no idea of how or why this should be
so.</p>

<h3><a name="ch126" id="ch126"></a>CHAPTER XXVI. TELLS HOW SAM MADE
A PROPHECY</h3>

<blockquote>14, Clifford's Inn,<br>
June 21, 1807.<br>
<br>
MY DEAR SAM:<br>
<br>
I begin this hurried letter with the word BEWARE writ large, since
Shrig's latest despatch informs me that you and your whereabouts
are now known to that Walking Evil who must contrive your
destruction or perish himself. For I have spun such web and to such
effect that soon he will be in close durance whence shall be no
deliverance or escape. But, alas&mdash;he is also aware of this and
in fury of desperation and to avoid his own utter and final ruin
will (as I fear and Shrig confidently hopes and expects) make some
determined effort against your life by any and every means.
Wherefore, my dear Sam, in God's name and for your own sake, do not
be fool-hardy, run no avoidable risk, be constantly alert day and
night, and above all be guided in everything by Jasper Shrig, who
has lately called certain others to his aid. And this alone doubles
my anxiety for you. Five weeks and two days hence this Deadly
Menace, this Two-legged Evil will be removed, shut away for good
and all and you in safety may enjoy your Inheritance. But in this
space of time what will and how much may happen? I can but trust in
the continued mercy of a Divine and all just Providence, in your
own prudence and the often proved sagacity of Shrig who, in my
experience, has so frequently outmatched devilish cunning by a
guileful astuteness and methods as unexpected and original as
himself. And here I end this most unbusiness-like but entirely
friendly epistle as I began, viz.: with that same ominous
word&mdash;Beware!<br>
<br>
This from your sincere friend and well-wisher,<br>
<br>
ED. JOLIFFE.</blockquote>

<p>Outstretched at ease in the shady orchard, Sam read this letter
very carefully, then having pondered it awhile, went indoors to his
cosy bedchamber, the gable room where stood his brass-bound,
seaman's chest and battered ditty-box whence he rummaged in turn a
formidable sheath-knife and belt, together with a brace of small,
beautifully-made pocket-pistols which he duly loaded and
primed.</p>

<p>Thus armed, downstairs he went and taking hat and stick, stepped
out into the sunny yard just as Nancy fitted a yoke upon her buxom
shoulders whereby to carry two large pails of creamy milk.</p>

<p>"Nancy, belay!" said he. "What I mean is&mdash;pray allow
me."</p>

<p>"La, sir," she exclaimed, returning his smiling look, "I be so
used for to carry a yoke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"However," said Sam, yoking himself instead to these luscious
burdens, "your pretty shoulders and white neck will show prettier
without it."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," said she, dimpling. "Oh, Mr. Felton, ee du say such
things&mdash;I be all of a blush."</p>

<p>"Good!" he nodded. "It well becomes you, for you're even
handsomer when you blush. Ay, a right seamanly eye has
Tom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lud, sir, what's Tom got to do wi' my blushes?"</p>

<p>"Everything, Nancy, or so I thought, but now&mdash;well, I'm
nowise sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;sure? Oh, Mr. Felton, whatever do ee mean?"</p>

<p>"Nay, faith, Nancy&mdash;Tom must do his own explaining, if he
will or if you can wheedle the truth out of him, coax him to tell
you who she is and&mdash;when it's to be. However, if she does or
has said 'yes' I shall be first to wish him joy and so will you,
I'm sure. Though she's a lucky, ay, a right fortunate girl to have
won such a smart, handsome fellow as Tom&mdash;and he one of Lord
Nelson's 'hearts o' the oak'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What 'she,' sir? Oh please, please tell me who...who and what
like she be."</p>

<p>"Not I, Nancy, 'twouldn't do! Only Tom can tell you&mdash;if he
will. Not that he's likely to say a word till it's all over and
done."</p>

<p>Nancy stopped to clasp her large though shapely hands upon her
splendid bosom as if to still its tempestuous surge.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir...Mr. Felton," she said, breathlessly, "du ee
mean...oh, can it be...is it that...Betty Noakes, or Mistus Cec'ly
Croft over tu Deepways Farm? Yet no, 'twouldn't be she, her be
breaking her poor heart for that Mr. Ralph&mdash;and him a Scrope!
No, 'twill be that Betty...and if 'tis...Oh, Mr. Felton sir, be she
the one?"</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Sam hastened his steps and setting down
pails and yoke in the dairy, glanced at Nancy's flushed and
troubled face saying, gently:</p>

<p>"Nancy, I must not tell you of the fortunate lass Tom means to
make his wife, it wouldn't be fair. But you're clever as well as
lovely, use your wits and find out from Tom himself: for no
sailorman could resist such handsome lass&mdash;and especially such
eyes as yours when they are gentled and lovelier for their tears as
they are at this moment." Which said, away strode Sam hastily to
avoid further questioning and to find Tom and presently espied him
busied with a pitchfork among the fragrant ricks.</p>

<p>"Tom," said he, "Tom, you chuckleheaded lubber, you've been so
far out in your reckoning that I've just left your lovely Nancy
ready to weep all over you because she thinks you mean to wed
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh? Another, sir? What&mdash;me?" gasped Tom. "What could ha'
put such dam' fullishness into her pretty head?"</p>

<p>"I did, Tom! And to right good effect. So now, here's your
course, d'ye see&mdash;keep away and well to wind'ard, plying off
and on, till of her own accord she bears up and ranges alongside or
runs you aboard."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, ay, ay!" said Tom, eagerly, his blue eyes very bright.
"Ah&mdash;but," he sighed, glooming again in sudden doubt, "suppose
she don't."</p>

<p>"Still keep the weather of her, and she will, Tom, she
will."</p>

<p>"Ay, and if so&mdash;how then, sir?"</p>

<p>"Leave her to loose the first broadside. Be dumb as a dead eye
till she question you. I'll lay my oath she will, like the
honest-hearted, high-spirited, sweet lass she is."</p>

<p>"Ay, she's all that, sir! And how then?"</p>

<p>"Tell her the truth, of course, and then, old
<i>Victory</i>-man, use those arms o' yours as a sailorman should,
and 'twill be victory again, I'll warrant&mdash;or damme!"</p>

<p>"Sir," quoth Tom, in awed tone, "Mr. Felton, sir&mdash;if I
bring it off, if only I can, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'If' is no word for a Navy man, Tom, as well you know and have
proved afore now! The word is 'when'!...And when you have, good
luck and happiness t' both o' ye, say I, and a right prosperous
wind."</p>

<p>Then away went Sam with his long, rolling stride, off and away
in the one and only direction and wondering, like the addle-pate he
was, just why the green world around him seemed more lovely than
usual, the sky bluer, and why the birds were singing and piping in
blither chorus...Ah but&mdash;as he passed that place of gloomy
trees and tangled thickets which little Jane called "The Deep
Dark," he was checked suddenly, smitten by such ghastly dread as
for the moment left him sick and faint&mdash;the sound of a woman's
desperate weeping...a breathless, wailing cry:</p>

<p>"Oh God...make me...brave enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then Sam leapt to action swift though silent until coming in
sight of that sullen, dismal pool, he stopped again, breathing his
relief in a deep, shuddering sigh.</p>

<p>She lay face down upon the very margin of the pool, so near
indeed that her long, yellow hair was already afloat&mdash;heedful
of which, he spoke her very gently:</p>

<p>"It would be very cold, dear lass. And besides I hate swimming
in my clothes."</p>

<p>She started violently and turned showing thus a face of
surprising beauty though now all marred, blotched and swollen with
her grief.</p>

<p>"Who...who be...you?" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"A friend&mdash;I hope. And my name is Sam, d'ye see and
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;go away...leave me alone...I...want to be...dead!" she
gasped.</p>

<p>"Why so you will, someday, but not here or in that dam' pool. No
man is worth such death&mdash;no&mdash;not one! And more
especially," said Sam, hazarding a guess, "such fool and villain as
Ralph Scrope."</p>

<p>"He's neither!" she cried, sitting up to say it the fiercer.</p>

<p>"He's both!" said Sam, sitting down to say it the more
provokingly. "Ay, he's both, and a liar besides! A worthless
scoundrel&mdash;it stands to reason."</p>

<p>"No, he's not...he's not!" she panted, glaring on Sam through
the tears that filled her very beautiful though grief-reddened
eyes.</p>

<p>"Then why is he breaking your heart? Why are you here in this
vile, desolate place? The fellow's a heartless rogue&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" she wailed. "His poor heart be breaking likewise, for he
do love me true."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, pondering this. "Ah? Then why d'you wish for
death?"</p>

<p>"Because he be such great and noble gentleman and I
be&mdash;only me."</p>

<p>"Ay!" nodded Sam. "And so beautiful&mdash;when your lovely eyes
and pretty nose aren't so red&mdash;that I'm right certain you are
much too good and lovely for such as he. Why d'ye love the
fellow?"</p>

<p>"Because I do! I always have and always shall."</p>

<p>"Even though he deserts you and breaks your heart along with all
his promises?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;'tis only because he must leave me...to save his
family from ruination!"</p>

<p>"Ah?" murmured Sam. "Tell me&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"By marrying a very rich lady...and I'm only a farmer's daughter
to...milk and churn, and bake and brew...though I've tried to speak
and act like a lady should...for to be his...lady wife. But
I...haven't any money...So that's why cruel Fate compels my poor
Ralph to break my loving heart..."</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam, shaking his head in helpless manner.
"Whoever heard the like o' this?"</p>

<p>"We've loved each other," she continued as if now her sorrow
found some relief in speech, "ever since we were boy and girl...and
with every year my love grew...and so 'tis I know I'll have to go
on loving him till I die."</p>

<p>"Such love," murmured Sam, "is perfectly unreasonable, very
pitiful, but b'George&mdash;altogether wonderful."</p>

<p>"And so," she continued, heeding only her own grief, "this is
why I came here to end it all...because it is all so hopeless! But
when I saw the pool...so still and dreadful dark...I was afraid
and...couldn't."</p>

<p>"Good!" nodded Sam.</p>

<p>"Though maybe," she whispered, gazing down into these same dark
waters and shivering, "maybe...someday I shall be...braver."</p>

<p>"No!" said Sam. "Oh, no! If you can love such fellow so
wonderfully, you must have the fellow. We'll see what can be done
about it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;what, what do you mean by 'have him'?"</p>

<p>"Marrying him, of course."</p>

<p>"Ah, but how...how can I?" she wailed, beginning to sob
again.</p>

<p>"In the usual way," answered Sam, "parson, ring and so on. Now
swab your tears&mdash;dry those pretty eyes&mdash;or shall I?"</p>

<p>"Nay but...who be&mdash;who are you?"</p>

<p>"Your friend, Sam. So take my handkerchief, clean this morning,
and dry your eyes, Cecily. You are Cecily Croft, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, taking the handkerchief, but gazing at Sam
in growing wonder, "yet how du ee&mdash;do you know my name?"</p>

<p>"Put it down to friendship, Cecily. For Friendship, d'ye see,
especially mine, can and shall work wonders, if you'll do your
part."</p>

<p>"Oh, but what&mdash;what must I do?"</p>

<p>"Be patient, have faith in yourself and the future, never say
die and soon or late you shall be your beloved Ralph's lady wife."
Sam uttered these words in tone of such convincing sincerity and
with look of such serene assurance, such absolute certainty that
Cecily started to her knees, looking at him above hands clasped as
if in prayer.</p>

<p>"Oh," she whispered, "if only this could come true!"</p>

<p>"It shall!" he nodded. But now, once again, tears blinded
her.</p>

<p>"Ah, no&mdash;no!" she wailed, bowing golden head and cowering
in hopeless misery. "Tis past my hope...and you...you be
only...making mock o' me."</p>

<p>"Not I, lass! No, damme! Do I seem the sort of animal to mock
any woman's grief? Sit up&mdash;take a good look at this
figure-head&mdash;this face o' mine! Do I look such vile
brute?"</p>

<p>Obediently she raised her lovely head, shook it miserably and
sobbed:</p>

<p>"No...no, you don't. But how...oh, how ever can I...how dare I
hope for...or believe such joy when I do know 'tis so impossible?
Oh, how can I?"</p>

<p>"Because," he answered, with his flashing smile, "in this old
world there's nothing impossible to our Navy, and I'm a sailorman,
d'ye see! So all shall come right for you soon or late&mdash;it
stands to reason."</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;how?" she questioned, with a new eagerness and
(hopeful sign) beginning to pay attention to her beautiful,
corn-coloured hair, "I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," he answered, with another cheery grin,
"you don't have to. Your part will be to&mdash;work instead of
weep, hope instead of despair, never say die or even think of it,
say your prayers and trust to the Lord and the Navy and Friendship.
So, what d'ye say?"</p>

<p>"'Deed I don't know what to say or think," she sighed&mdash;but
beginning to braid her lustrous hair, "you talk so strange
and&mdash;wild! I seem like I were in some dream."</p>

<p>"Ay, and in dreams all things are possible! So dream on, lass,
till Friendship makes your dream a reality and you wake to find
'tis true."</p>

<p>"Oh, but," sighed she, "my Ralph be gentleman o' The Quality,
like I tell you, and must wed money, and I be only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your own beautiful self," nodded Sam, "a loveliness far too
good for your Ralph&mdash;ay, a woman any man would be right proud
to wed, money or no! There'll be plenty will envy your Ralph when
he marries you."</p>

<p>"Marries...me?" she repeated breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure!" quoth Sam and with the utmost conviction. "And
when you are his wife I'm pretty certain you'll be his salvation
also, if anyone can save the fellow&mdash;I believe you'll raise
him, lift him up to be worthy, almost, of your sweet lovely self."
Her busy hands fell idle, her long-lashed eyes gazed upwards as if,
for the moment, they looked upon a rapture ineffable.</p>

<p>"If I only could!" she whispered. "Oh, God, most merciful, if
only I could..." Then she drew a long, shuddering breath, crowned
herself with the shining coronet of her hair and rose.</p>

<p>"I think," said she, looking on Sam now as if noticing him for
the first time, "you must be Captain Harlow's friend back along
with him from the wars and staying at Willowmead. And so now, sir,
I be&mdash;I am&mdash;trying to thank you for doing your best to
comfort me in&mdash;in my black hour. For though you talked a lot
of fullishness, I know 'twas well meant."</p>

<p>"It was, Cecily, it is! And my name's Sam. And now you are going
straight home, I hope."</p>

<p>"No. My home went when father died. So I'm going back to Uncle
Roger's farm to help to milk his cows, and churn and brew and bake,
same like as usual."</p>

<p>"However," answered Sam, as they went on side by side, "even
such hard work is better than lying dead&mdash;back there in that
hellish pool?"</p>

<p>"I wonder?" she murmured.</p>

<p>Thus, presently they came up from that place of gloom, out into
the pure, blessed sunlight. And here Sam halted to enquire:</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't believe in fairies any more, Cecily?"</p>

<p>"No," she sighed, "not since I were a child&mdash;and
happy."</p>

<p>"But do you believe in prayer?"</p>

<p>"Yes...I suppose so...of course," she faltered, "though I've
prayed and I've prayed but all to no purpose."</p>

<p>"Only because you haven't prayed quite long enough. So keep at
it and someday sure as a gun, I shall salute you like this, hat in
hand, saying: 'Your humble servant, madam. Good day and God bless
you, my Lady Scrope!"</p>

<p>And so, having bowed with a flourish, Sam turned and strode
away, leaving Cecily gazing after him wide-eyed but with the dawn
of a smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>Sam also was smiling as he strode these sunny meads (always in
the one and only direction) his grey eyes alight with such purpose
that presently he began whistling softly an old sea-chanty as he
meditated how best and soonest to effect this same purpose. On he
went and in such profound abstraction that he had passed little
Jane's 'Chanted Forest quite unnoticed when he halted again,
arrested by a sound of all sounds most unexpected in such
place&mdash;the high, sweet notes of a fiddle with the sweeping
chords of a harp; but this, as he quickly realized, a fiddle played
as he had never heard before&mdash;an instrument that sang in
joyous triumph, that laughed awhile then was hushed to wailing
supplication, a murmurous, sobbing melody of heartbreak and
despair, rising anew but swelling now to fiercer, wilder strain
until the very air seemed to throb with diabolic scream of hate, of
vengeance&mdash;changing, all at once, to a trill of ecstasy that
sank and was lost in the deep, sweet chords of the harp.</p>

<p>"Glorious...Oh...wonderful!" sighed Andromeda.</p>

<p>"Mag-nificent!" cried Mr. Verinder.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" said Sam.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch127" id="ch127"></a>CHAPTER XXVII. TELLS, AMONG
OTHER MATTERS, OF A STEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING</h3>

<p>Into Sam's ready hand the dog Esau thrust his shaggy head,
though his mistress, standing tall and stately, uttered no word of
greeting; wherefore Sam looked grim as he demanded:</p>

<p>"Why did they, your Uncle and that Jennings fellow, sheer off at
sight o' me, Andromeda?"</p>

<p>"Well," she answered, resentfully, "perhaps because you made it
so very evident that you cannot and do not appreciate great
music."</p>

<p>"But I do&mdash;especially when played so very well."</p>

<p>"Then you showed your appreciation very strangely!"</p>

<p>"However," growled Sam, "I can enjoy the fiddle without adoring
the fiddler or looking at him with eyes of such confounded
worship."</p>

<p>"Pray&mdash;what are you&mdash;suggesting?"</p>

<p>"I mean that a fellow is no better because he scrapes a fiddle
pretty well."</p>

<p>"'Pretty well'!" she repeated, scornfully and turned away with a
hopeless gesture. "If you had the faintest conception of music you
would know that Mr. Jennings is not only a wonderful composer but a
most brilliant...an exceptionally great violinist&mdash;a
master&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I prefer your dog!" quoth Sam, fondling Esau's shaggy
head. "He at least is glad to see me and was so kind to give me
welcome."</p>

<p>"Being&mdash;only a dog!" she retorted.</p>

<p>"Was that worthy of you, Andromeda, or just to your dog?"</p>

<p>"No!" she admitted. "For I do believe my Esau has more taste for
glorious music than Mr. Felton&mdash;at least he did not howl!"</p>

<p>"Nor I, as a remember."</p>

<p>"No, you merely gloomed and scowled&mdash;black as a
thunder-cloud! You also growled."</p>

<p>"Maybe I did&mdash;while you gazed on that Jennings fellow as if
you longed to devour him&mdash;fiddle and all!"</p>

<p>"A hatefully repulsive suggestion!"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;like the cove himself!"</p>

<p>"That is a hideously vulgar word."</p>

<p>"And suits him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, I will bid you 'Good morning'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And time too!" said Sam, removing his hat with a flourish.
"Good morning t'you, marm, your humble servant! And now, Andromeda,
come down from aloft&mdash;be your own sweet self, let's enjoy each
other's friendship and talk as friends should."</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;not feel at all friendly this morning."</p>

<p>"Nor look it!" he agreed. "However, I'll put up with all that
just because you're Andromeda and may presently bless me with a
smile or kinder looks, as a friend&mdash;Lord!" he exclaimed, for
they had come within sight of her tent and he halted to view it
with the utmost disapproval:</p>

<p>"Lord love me!" Sam repeated.</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped so!" she retorted. "And He may, of course,
being all merciful! But why call on the Deity&mdash;and so
suddenly?"</p>

<p>"That tent-thing of yours! It's a menace! A sudden squall, or
mere cap-full o' wind and it would carry away."</p>

<p>"Carry what away?"</p>

<p>"Itself&mdash;and you along with it."</p>

<p>"It never has yet, so why should it?"</p>

<p>"First of all&mdash;the stays are rotten."</p>

<p>"If you mean the guy-ropes, they are much stronger than they
appear."</p>

<p>"And those bits o' stick instead o' proper pegs! They'd never
hold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they do hold, and very well&mdash;as you see!"</p>

<p>"Only because there's no wind to strain 'em. Should it blow hard
and the confounded thing came down on you with a run 'twould half
stifle you before you could crawl free. So why not have proper
pegs?"</p>

<p>"Because they were all lost ages ago."</p>

<p>"Why then," said Sam, drawing his broad-bladed seaman's knife
and testing its keen edge, "though I can't scrape catgut I can
shape you some proper pegs."</p>

<p>"Pray do not trouble yourself, Mr. Felton."</p>

<p>"Andromeda, don't be silly&mdash;so dam' statuesque and
aloof."</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, I refuse to be sworn at!"</p>

<p>"Then don't waste your dignity on me, dear lass."</p>

<p>"I also object strongly to your&mdash;your maritime
familiarity."</p>

<p>Sam chuckled; gave a sailorly hitch to his belt fore and aft,
executed the first steps of a hornpipe, struck an attitude and
exclaimed in tone extremely hoarse and nautical:</p>

<p>"Marm, you may keel-haul me if you ain't taken me all aback! I'm
shivering in the wind's eye, falling off and on and drifting to
loo'ard! Raked fore and aft I am by that theer 'maritime
familiarity' broadside o' yourn!"</p>

<p>"Don't be so ridiculous," said she, frowning still but with the
ghost of a dimple beside her ruddy lip.</p>

<p>"Andromeda," he rejoined, suddenly grave, "I'd do or give a
great deal to bring laughter to that lovely mouth of yours and see
happiness in your eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh? Why?" she demanded. "Why ever trouble about me? Why are you
here now?"</p>

<p>"All in the way of friendship!" he replied.</p>

<p>"I see! Of course!" she nodded. "Though you think I have&mdash;a
'lovely mouth'!"</p>

<p>"I do! I do indeed. I were blind else. And you know it, too, of
course."</p>

<p>"I know it serves me to eat with. And this reminds me!"</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Steak and kidney pudding! I promised Uncle Arthur and it is a
favourite dish of his."</p>

<p>"And no wonder!" quoth Sam. "Where is he, by the way, and
that&mdash;that Jennings blo&mdash;fellow?"</p>

<p>"Talking music together somewhere, you may be sure. And now I
think you had better go, I'm going to be busy."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Sam, cheerily. "So am I, d'ye see. While
you're making your duff and so on, I'll get busy with your tent
pegs."</p>

<p>"That great knife of yours looks horridly sharp."</p>

<p>"Ay, it is. But a saw would be useful, if you have one, though I
suppose that's too much to expect."</p>

<p>"Of course I have a saw," said she, indignantly, "quite a large
one! You will find it with my other tools in the box over
there."</p>

<p>And true enough, amid a jumble of rusty pliers, pincers,
shaftless hammers and jagged chisels, Sam extracted that which had
once been a saw; he shook his head at it, sighed over it and
enquired, gently:</p>

<p>"Do you use this for cutting through bolts and nails,
Andromeda?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" she replied, tying herself into a large apron,
"I never do except when they get in the way. I sometimes have to
saw up boxes for kindling, in wet weather, and they are such naily
things."</p>

<p>"You dear soul!" he murmured and so tenderly that she turned to
frown at him, saying&mdash;though not very angrily:</p>

<p>"I believe you are&mdash;daring to&mdash;pity me."</p>

<p>"No, I'm picturing you on a damp, chilly morning, turning out to
hack away with this poor, blunt old saw, to light a fire with your
only dry kindling&mdash;for my lord's breakfast."</p>

<p>"And my own! So, I'll not be pitied&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Cap'n!" said he, saluting her with the rusty saw as if
it had been a cutlass; then away he went in quest of wood suitable
for his pegs and presently returned with a stout sapling and in
time to prevent her dragging a table from the tent.</p>

<p>"Where will you have it?" he enquired, picking it up.</p>

<p>"There, in shade of the big tree. Though I can manage quite well
alone."</p>

<p>"I know you can&mdash;and do!" said he, rather grimly. "But just
at present you are not alone, and while I'm about you shall neither
haul, heave nor hoist, d'ye see. Is that understood?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Captain!" she mocked, saluting him with the
rolling-pin.</p>

<p>"Very good!" said Sam, and began cutting his sapling into
precise lengths with the almost toothless saw while Andromeda,
rolling up her sleeves, commenced to make and knead her dough.</p>

<p>The saw whose teeth were so very blunt and gappy, required and
received dexterous manipulation, yet long before it had been coaxed
to successful performance, Sam was perfectly certain he had never
seen arms so deliciously round and smooth, their dazzling whiteness
the more apparent because of sun-browned wrists and hands&mdash;nor
elbows so bewitchingly dimpled...</p>

<p>All this, Sam contrived to notice while Andromeda, working her
dough with both slim fists, was as truly aware of him, his lithe
strength, the balanced ease of his every movement, his grim
features which yet could soften to such unexpected gentleness that,
with his wide-set, grey eyes and shapely mouth, made him quite
handsome&mdash;or almost.</p>

<p>Thus though both were apparently intent upon their work, each
was supremely aware of the other.</p>

<p>The saw having been persuaded to do its duty, Sam now took his
knife and seated with his back against the tree and legs crossed
sailor-fashion, began to shape and trim the first peg with quick,
sure hand. And now as they wrought, they talked&mdash;thus:</p>

<p>SHE: That knife looks horribly sharp!</p>

<p>HE: Yes, a knife should be.</p>

<p>SHE: I've heard sailors are handy men.</p>

<p>HE: They have to be.</p>

<p>SHE: However, you'll cut yourself if you don't watch your work
instead of staring at me&mdash;with such odious slyness.</p>

<p>HE (<i>With flashing grin</i>): Not slyness, Andromeda.</p>

<p>SHE: Yes, a detestable furtiveness.</p>

<p>HE: No, "askance" is the word. I merely venture to glance up at
you now and then sideways or a-jee.</p>

<p>SHE: Just because my arms are bare!</p>

<p>HE: No. Just because they are yours.</p>

<p>SHE: Whatever is the difference?</p>

<p>HE: That they belong to you and no other woman, of course. So I
thank the Lord for their beauty.</p>

<p>SHE: You are extremely personal.</p>

<p>HE: Certainly I am, and also perfectly sincere, and you too, I
hope. So let's go on being personal&mdash;tell me now of
myself&mdash;or the sort of fellow you think I am.</p>

<p>SHE: I won't be so cruel.</p>

<p>HE: Ah well, I asked for that&mdash;and got it because I admired
your arms and was honest enough to say so, eh, Andromeda? What more
d'ye think?</p>

<p>SHE: That you are supremely&mdash;impertinent.</p>

<p>HE: Yet very meek and humble&mdash;and yourself so proud and
fierce&mdash;and in such naughty temper! Your cheeks flushed and
eyes so bright! B'George, anger suits you, for your mouth could
never be anything but its lovely self&mdash;</p>

<p>SHE: Are you trying to offend me?</p>

<p>HE: You know I'm not.</p>

<p>SHE: Then cease your odious personalities! (<i>Here she turns
her back on him with movement that is almost a flounce.</i>)</p>

<p>HE: Very well, Miss Andromeda. And may I humbly suggest a
sprinkle of salt?</p>

<p>SHE (<i>Glancing down at him over her shoulder</i>): Salt?
Whatever do you mean now?</p>

<p>HE (<i>Becoming gruff jack tar</i>): In your duff, lady. 'Twill
sweeten it ye'll find.</p>

<p>SHE: What do you know of such things?</p>

<p>HE: Plenty, missis. I were ship's cook years ago.</p>

<p>SHE: Ah&mdash;indeed!</p>

<p>HE: Ay. And don't look s' scornful, lady, for I were a mighty
good 'un, d'ye see. Bake or boil, stoo or fry, there was few to
ekal Sammy! And as for puddens, you should ha' tasted my spotted
dog.</p>

<p>SHE (<i>Shuddering with extreme violence</i>): Repulsive! I feel
unwell at the mere suggestion.</p>

<p>HE: Then besides, marm, I could do more wi' a good, fat lump o'
pickled pork than most&mdash;</p>

<p>SHE: Horrible! If I must endure your company do&mdash;not talk
of such utterly revolting things&mdash;or like a vulgar sailor.</p>

<p>HE: But these revolting things are what poor sailormen must eat
or starve&mdash;and I am a vulgar sailor.</p>

<p>SHE: Well, if you must talk&mdash;speak as you usually do.</p>

<p>HE; Why, so I will&mdash;if instead of showing me your back,
which I'll own is very shapely and perfect as feminine back should
be, yet I&mdash;</p>

<p>SHE (<i>Turning in sudden appeal</i>): Oh, Sam, why are you
trying to anger and annoy me?</p>

<p>HE (<i>Speaking in tone suddenly gentle as his look</i>): My
dear, for this little while you haven't thought of your
anxieties&mdash;I've made you even forget that Uncle of yours,
haven't I?</p>

<p>SHE (<i>Softly</i>): Yes, you have.</p>

<p>HE: Because, Andromeda, I'd do much, very much&mdash;anything to
make you a little happier. You believe this, don't you?</p>

<p>SHE (<i>More softly</i>): Yes.</p>

<p>HE: I hope we are going to be&mdash;closer, better friends than
ever, because very soon I shall be...pretty lonely, ay, I shall so!
For in a week's time my friend Ned, Captain Harlow will marry his
Kate.</p>

<p>SHE (<i>Sighing</i>): I hope they will be very happy.</p>

<p>HE (<i>Rather bitterly</i>): Oh, they will! So happy they won't
want me cruising in their waters. That's the worst o' marriage, it
so often casts off Friendship and sends it adrift. So don't you go
marrying anyone, Andromeda.</p>

<p>SHE (<i>Beginning to line a basin with dough</i>): I never
shall&mdash;never.</p>

<p>HE (<i>Fervently</i>): Good! Neither shall I.</p>

<p>SHE: Why not?</p>

<p>HE: Because having made two fool attempts I shall never make
another&mdash;not I. Besides, should this threat of invasion
continue I shall ship myself off to fight the mounseers.</p>

<p>SHE: So should I&mdash;were I a man.</p>

<p>Here she began cutting up the steak, but made such a business of
it that Sam rose and taking the knife from her (<i>very gently to
be sure</i>) shook his head at it, saying:</p>

<p>"As I thought&mdash;blunt as my finger! Use my knife while I
find a stone and put an edge on this."</p>

<p>So Andromeda took the keen, glittering blade and found such ease
in its usage that Sam promptly gave it to her, showing how she must
wear it in its sheath belted around her slender waist.</p>

<p>The pudding was duly tied up and set to do its best in the black
pot above the fire; then while Sam went on with his peg-making,
Andromeda, throned upon a stool nearby, prepared the
vegetables...And now they worked and talked in an ever-growing
intimacy and understanding.</p>

<p>"Have you met Kate Ford?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"No, but I have seen her frequently at Lewes Market. She is a
splendidly handsome creature."</p>

<p>"Ay, she's all that. Ned's a mighty lucky fellow&mdash;and
deserves to be."</p>

<p>"Have you many friends, Sam?"</p>

<p>"I had, but most of 'em got killed, one way or another ashore or
afloat. So today my only real friend is Ned, Lord love him."</p>

<p>"No lady friends, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Only one&mdash;with golden eyes that ought to laugh yet never
do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they can't," she sighed, "or don't know how."</p>

<p>"Then I'll try to learn 'em. For, d'ye see, no laugh is real
unless it somehow gets into the eyes."</p>

<p>"I fear I am a very depressing person, Sam."</p>

<p>"No, for there's a dimple in your cheek sometimes, and that
mouth of yours was made for laughter and&mdash;" Sam closed his
lips on the word, whereupon she, of course, instantly demanded:</p>

<p>"What, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Smiles," he answered. Here she glanced up from the potato she
was peeling, and with smile so unexpected, so altogether lovely and
dazzling that Sam very nearly cut himself.</p>

<p>"You were going to say 'kisses', weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted.</p>

<p>"And very silly, very foolish of you, Sam&mdash;if you want my
friendship."</p>

<p>"Oh?" he murmured. "Ah? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because my kisses would destroy friendship&mdash;utterly and
forever."</p>

<p>"How?" he enquired. "Why? Just what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Think and find out!" said she, and went on peeling the potato.
And when Sam had chipped and pondered awhile, he changed the
subject by enquiring:</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know Cecily Croft?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, why?"</p>

<p>"What sort of person is she?"</p>

<p>"A fool, of course, but a very beautiful one. She is sweet and
good and gentle, but a fool because she is wasting herself on that
abomination called Ralph Scrope."</p>

<p>"Ay, she told me some such&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Indeed!" exclaimed Andromeda, and dropped a potato. "Do you
know her so well?"</p>

<p>"I met her for the first time this morning on my way here."</p>

<p>"I see!" murmured Andromeda, reaching down for the errant
vegetable. "Well, don't you think she is a&mdash;supremely
beautiful girl?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I do indeed."</p>

<p>"With&mdash;the most glorious hair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, like ripe corn."</p>

<p>"And you admire that colour, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though I prefer black."</p>

<p>"You feel compelled to say that, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I do, for d'ye see truth compels."</p>

<p>"Are you so extremely truthful&mdash;always?"</p>

<p>"I hope so&mdash;except when truth is like to hurt."</p>

<p>"Yes, and how then?"</p>

<p>"Why then I pipe down, stow my jaw-tackle and hold my
tongue."</p>

<p>"Are you going to hold it now?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;why should I?"</p>

<p>"Then tell me how Cecily came to be so confiding to you&mdash;a
stranger?"</p>

<p>"First, do you like her, Andromeda, are you her friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she saved my life."</p>

<p>"Did she, by George?"</p>

<p>"No, by her strong arms&mdash;and they are as 'round and white'
as mine, please understand."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"It was that day I brought our little Jane up from death in that
awful pool. I am a strong swimmer but the horrid weeds caught and
held me down...there in the frightful dark...grasped and clutched
me like slimy hands and arms...It was Cecily who lifted me half
dead from that ghastly water at last."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Cecily! And it was by that same accursed pool I met
her this morning, crying her eyes out and so near death that her
long hair was awash."</p>

<p>"That horrible place!" gasped Andromeda. "Oh, my poor, poor
Cecily! There is something very&mdash;terrible about that
pool!"</p>

<p>"So I think," Sam agreed. "'Tis an evil place should be blotted
out, and shall be&mdash;someday, and pretty soon, maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam. Too many have died there in the past...And
now&mdash;poor, distraught Cecily! Do you think she
too&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Only the Lord knows that."</p>

<p>"Ah," whispered Andromeda, shivering, "love can be very
frightful...such an agony...to drive one so sweetly simple, so
purely good as Cecily to even think of death so dreadful and for
such brute beast as Ralph Scrope! Love can be the bitterest
curse!"</p>

<p>"Too true!" nodded Sam. "And yet the holiest blessing and
comfort also, my dear&mdash;for such happy ones as Ned and Kate. As
for Cecily&mdash;her love is so deep, so true and marvellous that I
can only wonder and feel&mdash;well&mdash;humble and almost envious
of such a love."</p>

<p>"Oh! Why?"</p>

<p>"By the glorious unreason and beautiful folly of it. For in
spite of everything she adores the dam' fellow still! Told me he
was only breaking her heart because 'twas his duty to save his
family from ruin and that she'd love him till she died,
ay&mdash;and that he was breaking his own heart, too."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Andromeda, scornfully. "Such abhorrent
wretch has no heart to break!"</p>

<p>"I wonder?" queried Sam.</p>

<p>"Good gracious&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"That time we saw the fellow gallop past us in the lane his
dusty face was all streaked with tears&mdash;and I'm hoping they
were for Cecily."</p>

<p>"Why ever should you?"</p>

<p>"Because d'ye see, I promised she shall wed the fellow&mdash;ay,
and within the year!" Here, Andromeda gazed at Sam in such
speechless amazement that he enquired:</p>

<p>"What's so wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Not wonderful!" she retorted, indignantly. "Only wickedly
foolish and cruel. You told her that&mdash;that absurd nonsense
merely to soothe and comfort her, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Of course! And it acted like a charm."</p>

<p>"An evil charm that can only work greater misery and evil later
on, as you must know."</p>

<p>"But I don't. Why should it?"</p>

<p>"Because your easy promise is quite beyond your power to fulfil!
You know it is all quite, quite impossible. So why deceive the poor
soul with false hopes?"</p>

<p>"Not false but sincerely true, my dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not your dear. And it was a cruelly impossible promise! So
why make it?"</p>

<p>"Well, let's say because I am a seaman."</p>

<p>"What on earth has that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Everything! For d'ye see my&mdash;Andromeda, seamen are always
doing the impossible and always will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, what preposterous nonsense! Seamen are only human, the
poor men often drown and their great ships are wrecked because it
is impossible to save them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! Because they are summoned aloft by the Lord High Admiral of
us all."</p>

<p>"Sam, you are evading the question."</p>

<p>"However," said he, shaping the last peg, "I believe nothing is
impossible until we make it so. And I'm so sure Cecily shall wed
her confounded Ralph that I'm ready to lay you a wager on it. Let's
say&mdash;a new collar for Esau here, bless his shaggy
hide&mdash;to one of your oldest shoes." At this she glanced up in
a surprise made utterly delightful by the swift, conscious flush
that could soften the too-austere beauty of her too such shy and
gentle loveliness&mdash;or so thought Sam, as she exclaimed, though
very tenderly:</p>

<p>"How absurd! What ever could you do with such a
thing&mdash;supposing you won?"</p>

<p>"Treasure it!" he answered, adding promptly: "As a token of
friendship&mdash;and patient service. So, what do you say?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not! First, because my shoes are never too old
until they fall to pieces and then I burn them or throw them away.
And secondly, because when not going to town, I usually wear things
like these, as I'm sure you have noticed, but&mdash;look again!"
And she thrust out a slender foot and ankle tied into such
thick-soled, clumsy boot that Sam frowned, demanding:</p>

<p>"Why wear such things?"</p>

<p>"To keep out the early morning dew. I usually change them later,
but today I forgot because of Mr. Jennings' magnificent playing.
Why do you so dislike the poor man?"</p>

<p>"Well," enquired Sam, "why does Esau? He and I are of the same
mind. Eh, old lad?" said he, patting the great animal who lay
couched beside him. "Well, your pegs are finished, Andromeda."</p>

<p>"And I'm very grateful, Sam."</p>

<p>"Then come and help me to fix 'em."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the hammer is broken."</p>

<p>"Only needs a new shaft. I'll make one."</p>

<p>"The axe is over there."</p>

<p>"Ay, and blunter than your knife. I'll sharpen it
presently."</p>

<p>"You have made these pegs quite&mdash;beautifully."</p>

<p>"Because they are for you. Tomorrow I'll rig new
stays&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment a distant church clock struck the hour.</p>

<p>"Twelve!" gasped Andromeda. "Twelve o'clock&mdash;already!"</p>

<p>"Am-azing!" exclaimed Sam, driving the last peg.</p>

<p>"And those vegetables ought to be on!"</p>

<p>"Well, let's put them on!" quoth Sam; which done, he set to work
sharpening the axe with a stone from the brook that made a soft
rippling nearby like elfin laughter, while Andromeda, seated upon
the stool again, now busied herself with needle and thimble. And
after she had stitched and he had ground awhile in silent though
eloquent communion, Sam enquired:</p>

<p>"Are you never idle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, often. Why?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am. Sometimes I sit doing nothing for hours."</p>

<p>"Then do it now&mdash;for half-an-hour. Give those hard-worked
hands a rest."</p>

<p>"When I have mended these stockings."</p>

<p>"Such silken splendours!" said Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are lovely."</p>

<p>"Your uncle's, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, he can't bear anything coarse or common."</p>

<p>"Though others must."</p>

<p>"If by 'others' you mean me, pray understand that I also wear
silk&mdash;sometimes, though I prefer worsted or wool to work
in."</p>

<p>"Does he ever work&mdash;ever try to help you?"</p>

<p>"He does his best."</p>

<p>"Does he ever turn those soft, white hands of his to anything
besides his confounded harp and paint-brush?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;sometimes. But why should he when I am only too
glad to do anything&mdash;all I can for him?"</p>

<p>"Precisely! You are his too-willing slave and he accepts all
your ceaseless labour as his due because he is a wilful do-nothing,
a selfish, domineering autocrat&mdash;a tyrant who is killing you
in his service, stealing your youth, spoiling your life and will
leave you desolate at last..."</p>

<p>"Have you done?" she enquired gently when Sam paused for
breath.</p>

<p>"No, I could go on and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then please don't, it would be of no avail, I must and shall
live for and serve him so long as he needs me no matter what the
end may be."</p>

<p>"Ha!" growled Sam, looking up at her beneath close-knit brows.
"So you will sacrifice yourself because he saved you-his own
sister's child&mdash;from poverty, which was no more than act of
common decency to his own flesh and blood! So why make a kind of
saint of him, why glorify him for being human and doing no more
than his duty? Ay, and to one of his own family! Any man worth the
name would have done as much."</p>

<p>Andromeda's busy needle was suddenly stilled, and for a moment
she sat as if lost in unhappy reflection: when at last she spoke:
it was unwillingly and with an effort:</p>

<p>"Then I must tell you...how Uncle Arthur not only saved my young
mind from...ruinous evil but my childish body also...I can never
describe all the sordid shame and misery I endured after my poor
father's death...But I was nearly fourteen and had become the
wretched drudge of a cruel mistress and...a man so unspeakably vile
that...at last...one day...he&mdash;" The words died on her
quivering lip, her eyes widening to such remembered horror that Sam
instinctively cowered, waiting in sickening apprehension of what he
must hear:</p>

<p>"Andromeda&mdash;?" he said, at last; and in this one word,
harshly whispered, such agony of dread that instinctively she
reached out her hand to comfort him, saying and more tenderly than
he had ever heard:</p>

<p>"Dear Sam! No! God sent my salvation&mdash;it was then Uncle
Arthur found me at last! And when he had nearly killed the man, he
bore me away to his loving care&mdash;a great, glad life at last.
He saved me from living death and gave me instead all the best and
noblest of life...So today, in his weakness, I remember him for the
wonderful man he was and shall love him, watch over and serve
him&mdash;to the end. So now, Sam, you understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, mournfully. "Yes, I understand."</p>

<p>"Well now&mdash;don't look such a woeful Sam&mdash;come and help
me to dish up our dinner."</p>

<p>"Ours?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"If you will honour our simple board, Mr. Felton, sir."</p>

<p>"Ay, but&mdash;what of Mr. Verinder? I'm pretty sure he don't
like me, d'ye see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He will welcome you, of course, like the gracious gentleman he
is." At this moment Esau cocked his ears and wagged stumpy tail,
for, as if conjured up by mention of his name, Mr. Verinder
appeared, advancing with his short, tripping stride.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Felton," said he, bowing hat in hand, "do I see you
yet?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," answered Sam, returning this salute rather awkwardly,
"though I was about to bear up and stand away&mdash;go, d'ye see,
sir."</p>

<p>"That is well, Mr. Felton, that is very well, for I am not well,
indeed no! Meda, my love, I think I will lie down a while."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle, the steak-pudding! See, it is all ready&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are kidneys also, I trust?"</p>

<p>"Of course, with onions and seasoned as you like it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you may bear us a small portion to the caravan,
child&mdash;though we doubt if we can touch a morsel&mdash;but we
will attempt it&mdash;for your sake, Meda love. Pray do not
tarry...Good morning, Mr. Felton, or&mdash;should I
say&mdash;Good-bye?" Uttering which, Mr. Verinder turned and
tripped away to his caravan.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder," sighed Andromeda, "what can have upset
him&mdash;he looked dreadfully pale."</p>

<p>"However," said Sam, rather grimly, "it is just as well you
didn't forget the kidneys! Well&mdash;now, Andromeda, '<i>a
dieu</i>' as the mounseers say, but&mdash;I shall see you
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," she repeated, glancing towards the caravan with look
almost apprehensive, and Sam frowned to see the trouble was back in
her eyes again. "No&mdash;not tomorrow," she sighed.</p>

<p>"Ah?" exclaimed Sam, also glancing towards the caravan. "Well,
if not tomorrow&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"I...I'm not sure," she answered in voice troubled as her look,
"I'll send you word by Cecily Croft."</p>

<p>"Then please," said Sam, baring head in farewell, "please let it
be soon and I hope...no, tell me you'll be glad to see me&mdash;a
little."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, giving him her hand, "yes, I shall
be&mdash;very glad."</p>

<h3><a name="ch128" id="ch128"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII. IN WHICH IS
MENTION OF A MOTHER AND SON</h3>

<p>Very thoughtful was Sam as he trudged homewards, indeed so
profoundly abstracted that he went astray and became lost in a maze
of field-paths, cart-tracks and narrow lanes; but guiding himself
with sailorly instinct, came out at last upon an unfamiliar road
shut in by trees and tall hedges. Therefore he paused to take his
bearings and thus espied the thatched roof of a cottage, a small,
wicket gate and a motionless woman who leaned across it, peering
intently away from him along this shady road. So thither went Sam,
his feet soundless upon the grass bordering this road, while the
woman continued to gaze away with the same fixed and motionless
intensity. Now as he approached thus silently, he became aware of
two things&mdash;that this slender, graceful woman was no rustic
cottage-body, and that there was something almost dreadful in her
strained attitude and utter stillness...a fearful, an agonized
expectancy.</p>

<p>He was close enough for speech, when, as if warned by some sense
other than hearing, she started violently, turned and shrank away,
showing a face, haggard though still beautiful, framed in grey hair
and lit by dark eyes wide in such swift terror that Sam halted
amazed beyond words, and before he could find utterance, she spoke
in dreadful, gasping voice:</p>

<p>"He is...not...here! I tell you...he is not...here! Why is he
being...spied upon? Why do you...follow him?"</p>

<p>"Madam," Sam replied, gently as he might, "I've no idea what you
mean. But don't, pray don't be so alarmed."</p>

<p>"But, he told me," she whispered, "of...eyes that
watched...through the leaves, footsteps that...creep&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My poor soul," quoth Sam, strangely moved by the agony in her
voice and look, "Lord love you now, here is nothing to dread ye.
I'm but a stranger who has lost his way, d'ye see, off my course
and beg to ask if you can direct me to Willowmead Farm."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh, then, I&mdash;I crave your pardon," she said, in
the same nervous, breathless manner. "I...I am not well...my
nerves...pray forgive me. Yes, this road will take you there...to
Willowmead, though a quicker way is by the field path...the lane
opposite...across the stile to your left."</p>

<p>"Thank you, lady," quoth Sam, hat in hand, "I'm mighty sorry I
so frightened you...and if you are in any trouble, say the word and
I'll be glad to do my best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" she answered hurriedly. "Thank you&mdash;no! And
your way is&mdash;down the lane you see opposite and over the stile
to your left."</p>

<p>So thither went Sam, and more thoughtful than ever. He had
crossed the stile and gone but a short distance when again he stood
arrested, this time by the sound of hasty, strangely uneven
footsteps upon the road, feet that strode apace and broke
frequently into a stumbling run. Now peering through the tall
screening hedge beside him, he saw this hurrying pedestrian was Mr.
Jennings; the lady had seen also, for throwing open the wicket
gate, she sped to clasp and welcome him, but&mdash;sinking to his
knees he buried his face in her gown, half stifling his wailing,
desolate cry:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother...beloved...I'm lost again in the dreadful dark! Oh,
Mother now...you are threatened...homeless...destitute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eustace," she answered, stooping to lift and comfort him, "my
darling, never mind! He can never hurt me any more, never again!
Come you indoors, my dear one, music shall make us forget
awhile...I have schemed an accompaniment to your Rondo, come let us
try it over, my own darling&mdash;come!" So saying, tender mother
led grievous son away into the little cottage.</p>

<p>Thus, gazing wistfully after them, Sam must needs remember that
sweetly gentle woman who, despite poverty and hardship having
mothered him so wonderfully, had died worn out and, of course, too
soon! And thinking of all he might now have done for her, the
cottage chimney, thatched roof and little wicket gate grew suddenly
all blurred upon his sight...</p>

<p>Thus, when a hand touched him and, starting, he beheld Mr.
Shrig, Sam forthwith cursed and damned his eyes the more fervently
because of the tears that were half-blinding his own.</p>

<p>"And nobody," said Mr. Shrig, placidly, "has ever cursed me more
fluent and hearty! But talking o' mothers, pal Sam, these yere eyes
o' mine as you've damned so eloquent, never see my own ma to
remember, yet if I could pick me a mother&mdash;yonder she goes
along o' Number Two."</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, as they went on together, "a lovely person,
Jasper, though very sad and&mdash;strangely fearful."</p>

<p>"'Sorrer' is often another name for 'mother', pal...and there's
more o' same a-coming yonder! And talking o' sorrer and grief
nat'rally brings us to steak and kidney pudden."</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Sam, halting in surprise. "Why what the
devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, pudden, pal, coupled vith the name o' Mr. A. Werinder as
has lately took sich a werry strong awersion agin you b'reason o'
Number Two and all because of a certain young female party vith a
crack-jaw name as I'll call Miss A, same as kips or dosses in a
tent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Avast, Jasper! Haul your wind and speak plain! Just what are
you trying to tell me?"</p>

<p>"That you are raising more windictiveness agin yourself,
ar&mdash;you're driving Number Two frantic and ditter Mr. Werinder
and my anxiety is rose according."</p>

<p>"How so, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Along o' you making love to Miss A, aforesaid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Making love? Who? Me?" gasped Sam, in fury of indignation that
swept him above all mere rules of grammar.</p>

<p>"Ar&mdash;you, pal."</p>

<p>"What dam' nonsense! Who says so?"</p>

<p>"Seeing's believing."</p>

<p>"Believing what?"</p>

<p>"Sir and Sam, if a young cove&mdash;'specially a sailorman,
looks at a young fe-male party as if he could eat or as you might
say, de-wour her, it argufies love on his part. And if
aforementioned young fe-male looks at him as if she yearned to run
into his arms and be de-woured or give him the chance thereof, it
argufies love on her part. Vich I therefore repeats seeing's
believing."</p>

<p>"Now damme!" exclaimed Sam. "This means you've been prying on
us&mdash;a spy, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, 'tis others is the spies. I'm your own partickler
hark-angel in top-boots to see, according to Holy Writ, as you
don't dash your stamper agin a rock neether run yourself into any
kind o' danger. And there y'are!"</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed Sam, striding on again. "Are you always on my
heels?"</p>

<p>"Not always&mdash;no, that ain't hardly to be expected, but I do
my best, as in dooty bound."</p>

<p>"This is perfectly damnable!"</p>

<p>"It is!" said Mr. Shrig with fervour. "Damnable's the vord, pal,
for dog bite me if you ain't more leery-skittish than any
vill-o'-the-visp, risking your precious carkiss here and theer, if
not afoot, then in a cart along o' that young fe-male party
aforesaid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord love me!" groaned Sam, with hopeless gesture. "This is
sheer, dev'lish persecution! Ay, b'gad, the whole countryside must
be full o' your spies, for Mr. Joliffe writes you have called
others to help you."</p>

<p>"Ar!" sighed Mr. Shrig. "But I called in wain! For because o'
this hot weather, Crime in London and Wiciousness in general has
growed that rampagious that The Law has all its limbs occupied
com-plete. So today here's only self, Dan'l and my Gimblet to
prewent you being measured untimely for a vooden overcoat. Now if
you ax me about said Gimblet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't!" quoth Sam, lengthening his stride.</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Shrig, following suit, "I'd better tell ye all
about the same, for your own sake hereafter. Are y' listening?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, since I must."</p>

<p>"Then, pal, my Gimblet is a London street arab, a little orphan
vaif as I've took under my ving to eddicate up to The Law and sich
sharp young shaver that I've named him Gimblet and for oo's be-hoof
I now take partickler care vith my h-aitches! A werry bright lad
rising fifteen or thereabouts for nobody can't be sure to a year or
so, and you'd better look him over so as you'll know him again."
Here, Mr. Shrig whistled a trill of soft, melodious notes and out
from the leafage close by a small shape emerged with hardly a
rustle; a trimly clad boy with the quick, bright eyes and sharp,
impish features of the true cockney urchin. Halting before them he
touched cap with up-flung finger, saying:</p>

<p>"'Ere I ham, Gaffer."</p>

<p>"Ar," nodded Mr. Shrig, "but you've got your aitch in the wrong
place, Gimblet. And don't call me 'Gaffer'."</p>

<p>"Very good, Gov."</p>

<p>"Tell us, lad, oo is this here gen'leman?"</p>

<p>"Felton, Gov'nor, likewise Sam-u-el, First Orficer o' the
<i>Fortun'</i> privateer."</p>

<p>"Right, lad. But oo else is he, and speak soft." And the boy
answered, whispering:</p>

<p>"Jaff-et, Lord Scrope, h-earl o' Wrybourne."</p>

<p>"Right again, Gimblet, only you've got a aitch now as shouldn't
be."</p>

<p>"Ax pardin, Gov, but them aitches is allus a-ketchin' of me
onexpected like."</p>

<p>"Ar!" nodded Mr. Shrig. "They do! For, Gimblet, this here letter
Aitch is a reg'lar double-faced leery-lurcher. He's a dodger and a
ducker, he's as slippery as a werry moist eel! He's a changeable
customer, sometimes hissing like snakes and sarpents and sometimes
silent as ghosts and phaintums, so take doo heed, my lad! Now,
anything to report?"</p>

<p>"No, Gov&mdash;'cept when I tracks 'em to the cottage I hears
Number Two cryin' and sobbin' like billy-o and so was she, but I
left 'em fiddlin' and playin' the h-arp."</p>

<p>"Werry good! Now cut along to your dinner and tell Dan'l to have
summat kept hot for me."</p>

<p>"Right-o, Gov'ner. An' if Mr. Felton wasn't a h-earl, and in our
charge, I'd cock a fair snook at 'im I would, for frownin' at me
like as he is now." Sam chuckled suddenly, laughed and took out a
half-crown, saying:</p>

<p>"Let's see."</p>

<p>Instantly Gimblet set thumb to snub-nose, spread his fingers,
wagged them and shot out his tongue with hideous grimace&mdash;all
in as many moments.</p>

<p>"Pretty good!" Sam nodded and tossed the coin which Gimblet
caught dexterously, spat upon for luck, spun aloft and finally
pocketed; which done, the boy took off his cap to say, with odd
little bow:</p>

<p>"Thankee, sir, best respex, sir!" And away he sped.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sam, looking after him with a smile, "a smart little
fellow, Jasper."</p>

<p>"Ar&mdash;and though full of impidence, fuller still o'
gratitood. And you'll know him again, I hope, because like as not
you're a-going to see him pretty often&mdash;so soon as Number Vun
makes a move as he's bound to do before long."</p>

<p>"The sooner the better, and when he does&mdash;how then?"</p>

<p>"Pal, ekker alone replies! But&mdash;so soon as Number Vun finds
out as you ain't so nice and dead as he now hopes and believes,
then&mdash;Murder'll be up and arter you again, ar&mdash;morning,
noon and night. If you should wenter abroad in lonesome places,
every bush and tree'll be a wital menace! Death'll creep in your
werry shadder! So, Sam and sir&mdash;take heed!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Jasper. But now, talking of steak and kidney
pudding&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Mr. Shrig, halting in surprise. "Did you say
steak and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kidney pudding&mdash;yes!"</p>

<p>"Ar!" quoth Mr. Shrig with quick side-glance. "Coupled, I
suppose, vith the name o' Miss A."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jasper. I'd have you tell me again exactly how she
looked."</p>

<p>"Prime!" answered Mr. Shrig, his keen eyes twinkling. "A
ree-markable handsome young fe-male. She looked prime, pal, and
werry kissable."</p>

<p>"Did she, b'George?"</p>

<p>"No, by you, sir and Sam."</p>

<p>"Jasper, if you are friend o' mine&mdash;talk sense."</p>

<p>"So be it. Then hark you and heed! In hopeful expectation as
Numbers Vun and Two must shortly make a move, I'm keeping a werry
sharp ogle on same. Consequently this morning I ob-serve Number Two
peeping and prying on Miss A and you."</p>

<p>"Then curse the fellow!"</p>

<p>"He is so, pal! For if ever I see a cove in torment&mdash;'twas
him! Every look you give her is vips and scorpions for
him&mdash;ar, but&mdash;'twas a dagger in his buzzum every time she
looked at you!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam. "Ah? Just how did she look at me, then?"</p>

<p>"Love, pal! All her throbber or as you might say, heart in them
big, soft eyes o' hers&mdash;lovely sad eyes she's got&mdash;like a
cow."</p>

<p>"Eh?" gasped Sam. "Damme&mdash;a what, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Cow, Sam and sir. Some cows can look at ye so werry plaintive,
vith ogles sad enough to make some folks veep for sympathy. So
there's this lovesome Miss offering herself to you in every look
and you all unregardful, chopping sticks vith that sharp knife o'
yourn, then looking at her as if you could eat her! Vich therefore
your friend J.S. now makes bold to ad-wise you...Are you
listening?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am!" Sam answered, rather pettishly. "So carry on,
man&mdash;what is your advice?"</p>

<p>"That you coax or veedle her into that there pony-cart and drive
off vith her as fast and far as ye can go, ar&mdash;the further the
better! Result&mdash;con-tentment for both o' you, con-flummeration
for Vun and Two, relief for me and the pot set a-biling
generally."</p>

<p>"How," demanded Sam, halting again, "are you suggesting
I&mdash;elope with her?"</p>

<p>"That i-dentical."</p>

<p>"But...good Lord&mdash;to do such thing I'd have to be
desperately in love."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;ain't you?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not."</p>

<p>"Sure o' that?"</p>

<p>"Yes...yes, of course I am."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Shrig, easing large, silver watch from his fob,
"it being now thirty-two and a half minutes past twelve, all I can
say is&mdash;Good-arternoon!"</p>

<p>"The same to you, Jasper, and I'll thank you not to make your
care of me so all-pervading, dammit&mdash;and overpowering."</p>

<p>"Werry good, sir and Sam&mdash;and so soon as you've got
yourself com-pletely flummaxed you'll allus find me, if you ain't a
cadaver, under the name of Caleb Brown at the Ring o' Bells t'other
side Wrybourne Willage. So pray, remember&mdash;Caleb Brown allus
at your service." Then with airy flourish of his stick, Mr. Shrig
trudged off.</p>

<p>This same evening after supper, Sam indited the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>Willowmead, June 26.<br>
<br>
SIR AND MY DEAR BEN,<br>
<br>
Thanks for yours of the 21st with its warm-hearted and friendly
warning. But I have to inform you that the Walking Evil you mention
now supposes me dead, thanks to a poor wretch who stole my clothes
and thus got himself shot and killed in my stead. Thus our Two
Legged Evil imagines me a corpse and Shrig, fostering this belief,
now waits the next move. Meanwhile I am the victim of Jasper
Shrig's unrelenting care, he watches over me so remorselessly that
he is continually running athwart my hawse and falling aboard of me
and always when least wanted or expected. However, I write now to
beg you as friend (and command you as my esteemed man of business)
to meet me not later than Thursday next two days hence at the
"White Hart" Lewes on matter that can best be transacted face to
face and man to man. Also I shall be right glad to see you, Ben.
Therefore, Mr. Joliffe, fail not<br>
<br>
Your obliged and sincere friend,<br>
SAM.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch129" id="ch129"></a>CHAPTER XXIX. TELLS OF THE DAY
BEFORE</h3>

<p>Willowmead was in a feminine turmoil for tomorrow was&mdash;the
Wedding Day.</p>

<p>Light feet tripped and sped to and fro, upstairs and down, gay
voices called, laughed and chattered; Kate in the parlour with
Grannyanne and Aunt Deb attendant and critical, was trying on her
wedding-gown; Captain Ned, having got himself in everybody's way,
finally wandered forth in a sort of daze, to look at his new
pig-sties, while Sam in the orchard was hard at work constructing a
rustic seat in the shade of his favourite apple-tree. Thus,
presently guided by the purposeful ring of hammer, thither wandered
the Captain to watch and pace restlessly to and fro nearby as if
upon the quarterdeck of his ship and with never a word until
Wrybourne Church clock struck the hour, whereat Captain Ned halted
to say and very wistfully:</p>

<p>"Twelve of the clock, old messmate!"</p>

<p>"Ay!" replied Sam, busied now with saw.</p>

<p>"And tomorrow, Sam, tomorrow at this hour, we shall be just
about completing it."</p>

<p>"What, Ned?"</p>

<p>"The service, messmate&mdash;the&mdash;wedding. And this is a
very solemn thought."</p>

<p>"It is so, Ned."</p>

<p>"At this hour tomorrow, old fellow, I shall be a Benedick!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" enquired Sam, glancing up. "A what, Ned?"</p>

<p>"A bride's-man, shipmate."</p>

<p>"Oh! Ah!" said Sam, driving another nail. "Well, long life and
happiness to you, old lad, ay&mdash;to both of you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Sam!" quoth the Captain and turned again to his
quarter-deck walk and Sam to his hammering. But soon, back came the
Captain to say:</p>

<p>"I shall be mighty glad when 'tis all over, messmate, the
ceremony, I mean."</p>

<p>"And so shall I!" answered Sam, fervently. "For d'ye see, Ned,
I'm nowise sure I shan't miss stays or be taken aback&mdash;botch
the whole business and stead of your 'best man,' prove the
opposite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not you, Sam! Your sole duty will be to stand by and leave it
to the parson and me. Tomorrow! B'gad I can hardly believe it even
now...that Kate and I...at last...so soon! Seems too wonderful for
belief...such marvellous happiness!"</p>

<p>"Ay, you're mighty lucky fellow, Ned, yet you deserve it
all&mdash;or damme if ye don't."</p>

<p>"Thanks again, Sam. When are you going to follow my example, old
fellow?"</p>

<p>"How, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Marry of course and settle down."</p>

<p>"Now God love ye, Ned, who'd want me for her bride's-man
or&mdash;Benedick, was it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and how about that handsome Miss Andromeda?"</p>

<p>"Well," demanded Sam, changing saw for hammer, "what of
her?"</p>

<p>"Messmate, that's what I'm asking you."</p>

<p>"Ay, Ned, and why should you mention her?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well, you've been in her company so often lately
that we were hoping, Kate and I, that perhaps you and she might
make a match of it and settle down somewhere near us, neighbours,
Sam! Could anything be better?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in this world, Ned, only I'm pretty sure it can't ever
be, d'ye see."</p>

<p>"Why the devil not?"</p>

<p>"Well, since you ask, because I'm nothing near so well educated
as yourself, Ned, I'm too rough and ready, little better than an
ordinary fo'c'sle jack...and I'm not up to my ears in love like
you. As for Miss Andromeda&mdash;the chief reason for my visits is
that little, precious niece o' mine&mdash;Jane."</p>

<p>"Gammon!" laughed the Captain. "Is little Jane the reason you
have been so moody of late?&mdash;not she! Has little Jane put you
off your feed? Not she! Did little Jane drag you unwillingly in a
certain direction so often lately? Certainly not! No, Sam, my poor,
old juggins, you're in love, and you've taken it badly as I
foretold. Andromeda haunts you. Her beautiful, sad face is in your
thoughts morning, noon and night! Isn't this true? Come, speak up,
shipmate, tell the truth and shame the Devil."</p>

<p>"Well," Sam began, then paused as his roving glance espied a hat
emerging slowly from behind a tree at no great distance, a familiar
hat followed by the wrinkled visage of old Mr. Toop who, catching
Sam's eye, winked his own and beckoned with stealthy though
portentous finger.</p>

<p>"Sam, what now?" demanded Captain Ned. "What the devil are you
staring at?"</p>

<p>"Yonder, Ned&mdash;our aged Mr. Toop."</p>

<p>"Ay, so I see. Well, Gaffer, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nowt, Cap'n!" answered the old fellow, hobbling forward. "Nowt
wi' you, maister, my business be wi' Mus' Felton an' strickly
private, strickly!"</p>

<p>"However," said Sam, "you can speak out now, Gaffer. For Ned,
d'ye see, Mr. Toop, has been good enough to choose me your wedding
present&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, that Oi 'ave!" chuckled the aged man. "Ar and 'ad the toime
o' me loife, I 'ave! To fairs and markets I 'ave druv and nigh two
wiks it's took me choosin' an' checkin'&mdash;and allus the
best&mdash;if not, then: 'Tek 'em away' say Oi, for Oi be buyin'
f'r a gen'leman as wants only the proimest o' the proime! Money's
no objec', Oi sez. Ar and b' the pyx Oi've got 'em tu&mdash;the
best as eyes ever see."</p>

<p>"Good!" nodded Sam. "Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Comin' 'long lane yonder. And theer ain't another 'erd to ekal
'em in arl the South Country nor nowheres else! Coats so silky, s'
smooth and glossy as the down on a babby's 'ead! Udders on 'em like
so many gally-oons!"</p>

<p>"How many?" Sam enquired.</p>

<p>"So many as we can 'commodate, maister&mdash;twenty and four,
and every one on 'em&mdash;in milk!"</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed the Captain, hushed of voice but eyes aglow,
"Lord love you, old shipmate, I&mdash;Damme, I've no words to thank
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't ee try, Cap'n!" piped Mr. Toop. "Norra word till you've
seed 'em. Come now and lemme show ee!" Thus jubilant of air though
rather tottery of gaitered legs, old Mr. Toop hurried them into the
spacious farm-yard that seemed full of tossing horns, sleek bodies
and swishing tails&mdash;a truly magnificent herd whose lowing had
drawn hither an amazed and admiring audience.</p>

<p>"Ours, Kate, ours!" cried the Captain. "Sam's wedding
present!"</p>

<p>"My merciful Maker!" exclaimed Aunt Deb.</p>

<p>"La, what booties they be!" cried Nancy.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;a very lordly gift!" quoth Grannyanne.</p>

<p>"Oh!" sighed Kate, viewing these splendid animals with eyes of
knowing and rapturous appraisal. "Oh, Sam...my dear...you must have
spent a fortune! Ned, how can we ever thank him?"</p>

<p>"We can't!" replied the Captain, shaking his comely head. "It
goes beyond mere words, yet we can try&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need!" quoth Sam, almost gruffly. "None at all, Kate and
Ned, because d'ye see&mdash;you've given me such home and you're
learning me to love the good land so much more than I thought
possible that 'tis I am the grateful one. And if the herd is so
good, 'tis old Mr. Toop here you have to thank&mdash;he chose 'em,
d'ye see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;'tis me!" chirruped the aged man. "'Tis me as done arl
the choosin' and chafferin', 'tis me as picked they&mdash;every
one! And, oh me, dear souls, a pretty penny they costed&mdash;ah, a
mort o' money, never see s'much in arl me days, if I wur to tell ee
'ow much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," laughed Sam, "mum for that, Gaffer, not another word
and...why, Lord love me, there's my little sweetheart!" So saying,
he sped away where Jane was singing her song of "Barbree Alling,"
in her sweet, high voice.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch130" id="ch130"></a>CHAPTER XXX. TELLS HOW LORD
JULIAN LAUGHED AND SAM FOUND HAPPINESS</h3>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Sam, I have come to tell you 'bout my dolly's-house
what my dear, old Magic Tree sent with the cradle what I asked him
for and I love it. So now please I want you to take me so I can
thank him&mdash;so will you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure I will, sweetheart. So you love your
dolly's-house, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Sam, I just 'dore it and so does my Batilda, too. So
now let's go, shall us? 'Cause when I've said my thanks, we can
call for a visit to my Auntie Meda an' I can tell her about my
lovely dolly's-house too!" So away they went along the winding lane
and seldom speaking because Jane was giving all her thought to her
wonderful dolly's-house while Sam pondered the whether or no of the
Captain's words:</p>

<p>"My poor, old juggins, you're in love with her and you've taken
it badly."</p>

<p>"By&mdash;George!" he exclaimed at last, removing his hat to run
fingers through his crisp-curling hair. "By Jove and Jingo&mdash;I
am!"</p>

<p>"What are you?" enquired Jane, turning to look up at him.</p>

<p>"In love, sweetheart! Isn't that wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, 'cause everybody's always in love with somebody, like
Tom an' Nancy this morning, 'cause I heard him say 'Oh, Nancy, I
love you more'n I can say'&mdash;so then he kissed her an' she
kissed him lots an' lots&mdash;an' another time I heard my Uncle
Ned say, 'Oh, Kate, I 'dore you,' then he kissed her. An' I like
you best without your hat 'cause your hair's so nice an'
twisty..."</p>

<p>And now it was that round a bend in the lane, his horse's hoofs
unheard upon the turf, came Lord Julian Scrope, riding for once, at
a walk; also he sat bent in the saddle, arrogant head bowed as if
in utter weariness or profound thought. Slowly he advanced until
suddenly espying Sam's burly figure and scarred brow, he jerked
swiftly upright, checking his horse so violently that the animal,
snorting to pain of fiercely-drawn bit, reared, subsided and stood
shivering while his master neither spoke nor moved. Rigid and dumb
Lord Julian stared haggardly from a face whose deathly pallor was
the more ghastly because of the awful fixity of his wide-lidded,
smouldering gaze...</p>

<p>So indescribably dreadful was his look that little Jane clasped
Sam's nearest leg; even the horse appeared to sense something
terribly amiss, for he fretted and champed, backed and sidled until
at last came his rider's hand to pat and soothe him, in which
moment Lord Julian spoke and with all his usual arrogance of look
and tone:</p>

<p>"Tell me, fellow,&mdash;have I not seen you before?"</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord, you have," answered Sam, taking firmer grip on his
heavy stick. "If you'll trouble to think hard enough, you may
remember 'twas at Willowmead. We became somewhat familiar there, in
fact quite&mdash;closely connected."</p>

<p>"Ah-h-h!" sighed his lordship. "At&mdash;Willowmead!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord. Though I was in sailor rig then, but, d'ye see,
somebody shot my seafaring clothes and in 'em the poor thief that
stole 'em, which though hard on him, was lucky for me and
confoundedly disappointing for&mdash;others. How think you, my
right noble lord? Let's hear your opinion on't, come now."</p>

<p>But instead of speaking, Lord Julian did that which Sam was
never to forget&mdash;his pallid lips quivered, parted to slow,
terrible smile that grew and widened upon sharp, white teeth,
then&mdash;back went his stately head and he began to laugh...and
laughed loud and louder...until his nervous horse whinnied shrilly
in unison, and breaking into a canter, was spurred viciously to
such furious gallop as soon took them out of sight; yet even then
the echo of that frightful, mockery of laughter rang upon the
startled air&mdash;or so it seemed to Sam.</p>

<p>"Ooh!" cried Jane, clinging to him close as ever. "Didn't he
laugh&mdash;drefful?"</p>

<p>"He did, sweetheart."</p>

<p>"And why d'you suppose?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, my dear one, because he fancied he saw a ghost."</p>

<p>"But do folkses laugh at ghostesses?"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;some do, it seems, now and then, sweetheart. However,
let's forget all about it and talk of your fairy aunt,
instead."</p>

<p>"Yes, let's. An' I think we ought to kiss and comfort her a bit,
Uncle Sam dear, 'cause sometimes her eyes look so weepy, don't
they?"</p>

<p>"They do, my Jane, and so we will."</p>

<p>But at the end of this winding lane they beheld Cecily Croft
hastening towards them, and Sam was struck anew by the beauty of
her. Swiftly she came and flushed with haste, said
breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Felton, sir...I come from&mdash;someone in trouble,
someone who wants you, please." Now saying this, she glanced
furtively at Jane and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Thankee, Cecily," answered Sam, then stooping to Jane, he
kissed her, saying:</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, we must put off our visit because I'm wanted, d'ye
see. So now go home with Cecily and you shall take me a walk soon
as I come back."</p>

<p>Then up and away strode he, heedless of lurking perils and
forgetful of all things on earth except this "someone" who wanted
him.</p>

<p>"And," said he, between shut teeth, as he lengthened his
swinging stride, "by God she shall have me!"</p>

<p>Very soon and with not even a glance towards the "Deep
Dark"&mdash;that place of brooding evil, he reached Jane's 'Chanted
Forest, then halted, suddenly breathless with great leap of his
heart, for Andromeda was coming towards him; thus it was beneath
the broad, kindly shadow of little Jane's "Magic Tree" that they
met.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam!" she sighed, and gave him both her hands.</p>

<p>"Andromeda!" he said, and took her in his arms, drawing her
near, folding her close upon his heart. "My own...beloved..." he
whispered, brokenly, and kissed her hair, her sad eyes, her ruddy
lips that, quivering beneath his, kissed him back...And in this
moment Sam knew at last the Joy Ineffable&mdash;for now he felt her
clinging arms about him, her whole lovely body yielding to his in
mute surrender. Then leaning back that she might look up into his
eyes, she questioned:</p>

<p>"Ah, Sam, is this your&mdash;mere friendship?"</p>

<p>"No!" he answered and quite fiercely. "No, this is love at last,
thank God! Ay, such as I have never known or imagined. You are mine
and I am yours forever! So, Andromeda...oh, my dear, when
shall&mdash;how soon can we get married?" Now instead of replying,
she clung to him again and, sobbing, began to kiss his rough coat
until he lifted these caressing lips to his own, murmuring:</p>

<p>"But, Andromeda, why must you weep?"</p>

<p>"For our love," she whispered, "because it is so vain...so
hopeless."</p>

<p>"No!" said he, at his grimmest. "Oh no! We belong to each other,
we always have and always shall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear love," she sighed, in tone sadder than any tears, "such
happiness is not for us...it can be only a passing dream because
reality is so vile, so hatefully cruel and wicked...and may become
so horrible that now...at last...I am terribly afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid?" he repeated, kissing her bowed head. "All the more
reason for you to marry me soon, my beloved, ay&mdash;soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"Loose me, Sam dear&mdash;let me show you a horror of the past
and a&mdash;growing terror of the present&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it your uncle again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;oh Sam, let me show you why&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instead, he swung her up in his arms and carrying her beneath
this aged tree of "magic," sat down with his back against its
mighty bole, her loveliness still close in his embrace, and for a
never-to-be-forgotten while, she nestled to him, clinging
instinctively to his strength; and thus with his lips upon her
fragrant, midnight hair, he said, rather breathlessly:</p>

<p>"I know now...that I've always...loved you, Andromeda...yes even
before I saw you...it was you I was looking for...you, the other
part of myself, d'ye see! So I shall always love you...because I
must, it...it stands to reason. So when...how soon shall we be
married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear," she sighed, "how can I answer when you
know I shall never forsake poor Uncle Arthur, you know this."</p>

<p>"Ay, I do. And so, if you must be his devoted slave, I'll be
yours and...help my sweet wife to take care of him by taking dam'
good care of her. Yes, my Andromeda, besides your husband, I'll be
your lover, your 'hewer of wood and drawer of water,' yours to
serve&mdash;" Here, with soft, inarticulate cry, she drew him to
the grateful passion of her kiss; and thus sweetly dumb they, for a
while, knew a rapture far too deep for any words. And now being
conscious only of each other, how should they be aware of the
furtive eyes that watched their happiness with such deep anguish,
the pale lips close-set to such relentless purpose? Until:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;listen!" gasped Andromeda, roused to swift anxiety by
a distant though ferocious barking, "something is wrong! I left
Esau tied up because he's been so strangely fierce and nervous
lately...but he never barks so without reason! Oh, hark to him!
Yes, something is very wrong! Oh, how glad I am to have you beside
me, for I am nervous too! Come with me, Sam dear."</p>

<p>"To the world's end!" said he, drawing her hand within his arm.
Side by side they hurried through this shady coppice until they
came where stood tent and caravan&mdash;with Esau straining at the
stout cord that held him, at sight of them he ceased his raving
clamour, wagging stumpy tail, but kept his fierce eyes glaring in
the one direction.</p>

<p>"There must be someone hidden in the wood!" said Andromeda,
glancing around apprehensively as she stooped to pet and soothe the
great dog.</p>

<p>"Lord!" muttered Sam, and invoked a silent malediction on Jasper
Shrig's all-pervading watchfulness.</p>

<p>"Whoever it was has gone now," said Andromeda as Esau, having
flicked red tongue at her caressing hand, composed himself in
stately attitude yet with shaggy ears cocked and bright eyes
alert.</p>

<p>"Dearest lass," said Sam, kissing the hand he had retained, "why
are you trembling? What is it so 'frights you?" And drawing his
long, and very ready, arm about her shapeliness, she answered:</p>

<p>"Sit with me under our big tree yonder, your tree, Sam dear,
where you made my tent-pegs, and I'll tell and show you why at last
I am so greatly afraid." So thither they went and there seated, he
drew her close and feeling how she nestled to him, kissed her,
saying very tenderly:</p>

<p>"You've a very beautiful body, Andromeda, and for this I love
you. Ah but, d'ye see, in all this loveliness you have such sweet,
ay, such strong and valiant soul that for this I...oh, I worship
you so truly, so reverently that I'm shamed by my own unworthiness.
For, d'ye see, I'm such rough sort o' fellow with none of the airs
and graces I would have for your dear sake. So now I'd like to
know...well&mdash;just how you think of me. And if you can say
'Sam, I love you' 'twould hearten me, for you haven't
yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I have&mdash;repeatedly!"</p>

<p>"Not in so many words. So if you can, pray do."</p>

<p>"Well then," said she, obediently, "Sam, my darling, I admire
you for your strength and grimly dogged manliness, but&mdash;Oh, I
love you for these dear, grey, truthful eyes that have shown me so
much of your great, clean, gentle heart. And mine is a love shall
comfort you in adversity, suffer with you in pain or grief, glory
in your triumphs and welcome hardship and, with you, death itself,
rather than life without you. This is how I love you now, but if we
are to be so blest&mdash;to share life together, the years shall
only make me more your own to serve you, cherish and comfort you
to&mdash;the end&mdash;and beyond. So now, Sam, are you content?
Why&mdash;Oh, now you are crying!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am!" he confessed, blinking. "For...oh, damme&mdash;how
can I ever be worthy such wonder of&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here, she proceeded to silence him; when at last she
permitted him speech:</p>

<p>"Andromeda," sighed he, "though you're such angel o' light,
ay&mdash;so holy I'd scarce dare touch you, yet thank God you're a
woman also&mdash;for my lips to kiss, these arms o' mine to clasp,
this rough body o' mine to&mdash;" Here she silenced him again;
which done, she resettled herself beside him and holding his
nearest hand in both her own, spoke now in tone so dreadfully
altered that Sam enquired anxiously:</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;why, dear heart, what now?"</p>

<p>And, drawing a deep, shuddering breath, Andromeda told him:</p>

<p>"Last night Esau woke me and sitting up in the dark, I heard a
strangely awful mewing sound. Sick with fear, I lit the
storm-lantern and with this in one hand and my other on Esau's
collar, I went out to see what it was. Esau led me in among the
thickets until I saw something on the ground...a dreadful shape
that moved and twisted...Then I heard that awful sound again,
but...it was not a poor animal mewing&mdash;ah no, it was Uncle
Arthur weeping more terribly than I ever heard. I ran and lifted
him, his poor face all stained with earth and wet with tears...and
then I saw that in his hand he grasped a crumpled paper. And with
his terrible weeping he was whispering these words, over and over
again like a prayer&mdash;'Oh, God of Justice, give me strength,
give me vengeance.' For a long time he lay there writhing and
twisting as if in torment and I could do nothing with him. So I
prayed too, for God to help me, and my prayer was answered, for at
last my poor Uncle suffered me to bring him into his caravan. The
fire was not quite out, so I warmed some milk and made him drink
it, then stroked his poor troubled head until he was soothed and
fell asleep. Then very gently I drew the crumpled paper from his
fingers...This letter, Sam, this cause of my dear Uncle's anguished
madness and my growing terror! Read with me this frightful,
heart-breaking message&mdash;though I know it almost by heart."
From her bosom, Andromeda drew a folded paper, smoothed it out and
together they read these words:</p>

<blockquote>Julian, your heartless abandonment of me at such time
as this, must be God's punishment on me for my sin and wicked
treachery to poor Arthur. Without you I am desolate, and since you
are so merciless I must seek through death the abiding mercy of
God&mdash;or solace of forgetfulness. Yet, oh Julian, I am so
greatly afraid of what I must do, yet even so and with my last
breath I pray God forgive you, for your wretched, dying Barbara
loves you still. So now for the last time, Good-bye and
farewell.</blockquote>

<p>"The Lady Barbara Stowe!" murmured Sam. "Poor soul...God pity
and bless her!"</p>

<p>"Lord...Julian...Scrope!" hissed Andromeda, between shut teeth.
"He drove her, through anguish of love, to her death. He drove my
Uncle Arthur, through anguish of grief, to ruin and madness! Oh!"
she cried, leaping afoot. "Such inhuman monster is too vile to
live&mdash;I, yes, I&mdash;could kill him!" And flashing that keen
knife from the sheath at her girdle, she struck such passionate
blow that Sam, rising swiftly, cried:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;for God's sake, not you! Here's no work for a woman's
hand, 'specially this dear, gentle hand o' yours!" Seizing this
hand he kissed it until she let the knife fall and turning, hid her
face against his breast, saying breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam...had he been here...I should have...killed him!
Ah...horrible! Hold me close, close...take care of me for I'm
afraid of...the future and...myself. Marry me if you will...when
you will! Take me and keep me...safe in your strength&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay," growled Sam, "this will I, by God!"</p>

<p>"Alleluia!" exclaimed a voice so near that Sam turned, scowling,
as out from the leafage tripped Mr. Verinder.</p>

<p>"Glory!" said he, baring his white head reverently. "Glory to
God, alleluia and amen! And frown not, young man, for you are
become my blessing."</p>

<p>"Uncle Arthur. Oh, my dear, what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beloved child, God has called me to his most holy work, His
inspired instrument I and in His mercy will presently free me of
this futile body and lift me, perfected by death, to His light and
perfection of achievement at last. My only grief in dying was that
I must leave thee, my beloved niece, solitary, forlorn and
unprotected. Ah, but God has now raised up this Felton, sent us
this young, strong man to espouse you and free me of all care,
banish my last grief and strengthen me to God's holy purpose and
thereafter&mdash;bless me with death&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What purpose, sir?" Sam enquired gently. "And if you are His
instrument, how will God make use o' you, pray?"</p>

<p>"Dear Felton," said the little gentleman, patting his hand
affectionately. "Ah, my dear, dear youth, here is subject too
sacred, and far, far too holy to discuss, even with you. Instead,
go you, I beg, I plead, rouse fire and fill kettle...Meda, my love,
the day wanes, I suggest tea&mdash;let it prepare. And
yes&mdash;thereafter, my loved ones both, I will play for you a
solo on my great harp, a song of Life's supremest
blessing&mdash;death. So now let tea brew for I thirst, likewise
hunger."</p>

<p>With Sam's deft aid the meal was soon prepared&mdash;and who so
witty, so glad and unaffectedly joyous as Mr. Verinder. Thereafter,
down sat he to this imposing instrument and from quivering strings
wooed, plucked and compelled such splendour of sound as held them
rapt, enthralled by the wonder of his artistry until evening
shadows began to creep.</p>

<p>The wonder of this music was still haunting him when at last,
with Andromeda's parting kiss sweet upon his lips, Sam left her in
the shadows and turned unwillingly homewards.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch131" id="ch131"></a>CHAPTER XXXI. TELLS HOW SAM
SAVED HIS LIFE AND TOLD A FORTUNE</h3>

<p>The sun had gone down in glory, but the sky was still radiant
with a soft light that blessed the quiet world about him with a
gentle, wistful loveliness much like the beauty of his own so
beloved Andromeda...He would see her again tomorrow...ay, tomorrow
he would know again the rapture of her touch, her kiss, the
softly-yielding, vital feel of her in his arms...tomorrow...Thus
homewards fared Sam, musing happily of her and all the joys to
be&mdash;until, from dreaming lover he was suddenly transformed to
grim, fierce-eyed man strung for instant deadly action&mdash;and
this merely because a partridge had whirred unexpectedly from the
woodland to his right&mdash;where now every tree seemed a threat,
each bush a menace, especially a certain dense thicket. Sam halted,
took out his pipe and setting it between his teeth, thrust hand
into pocket and fumbled as if for his tinder-box, but all the while
his keen gaze was upon this particular thicket; he heard it rustle
faintly, saw leaves stir gently and whipping out pistol, fired and
tumbled headlong as from these leaves leapt roaring red flame and
death that hissed close above him. And now rose a shrill scream
with tempestuous flutter of petticoats and Cecily Croft was
kneeling beside him, had lifted him in soft, strong arms, then,
seeing his white-toothed grin, loosed him, saying breathlessly:</p>

<p>"God ha' mercy&mdash;I thought&mdash;you was killed!"</p>

<p>"So did I, Cecily."</p>

<p>"Be you anywise&mdash;are you at all hurt, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, thank God!"</p>

<p>"It looked like you was being shot at deliberate, Mr.
Felton!"</p>

<p>"Ay, so it did. Confound these poachers! 'Twas from that
bush&mdash;yonder!" said he, and while Cecily glanced thither, Sam
stole the pistol back into pocket.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she warned. "They're still there&mdash;listen!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Sam and leapt afoot; for now indeed the wood seemed
full of stir and movement, a distant leafy tumult swelling to vague
clamour suddenly hushed to a rustle that presently died away. So
came silence sweetly broken all at once by the plaintive fluting of
a blackbird.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sam, still watching this ominous wood where shadows
gloomed darker, "they've gone now, whoever they were, and we may as
well do the same. I'll convoy you&mdash;see you safe home, if I
may."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Felton, but you don't have to. Uncle's farm do
lie down yonder, scarce five minutes if I run. But before I go,
sir, I'd like to know why you told me all that fullishness
about...Oh, about my poor Ralph wedding me when he can't and never
will, and about me being called...Lady Scrope! Such fullish
nonsense, Mr. Felton&mdash;and why?"</p>

<p>"Cecily, did you ever have your fortune told?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;once I crossed a gipsy's palm with sixpence."</p>

<p>"Well, what did she prophesy?"</p>

<p>"She said I'd...marry my love and have...oh...sixteen
children."</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam, with his transfiguring smile. "She gave
you full money's worth, Cecily. Now I'll tell your fortune, give me
your hand&mdash;either will do."</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, saying:</p>

<p>"Mine isn't a fine lady's hand all soft and white&mdash;'tis a
hand to work itself rough and hard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So much the better!" quoth Sam, fervently, "for it is such
hands are our blessing&mdash;ay, and only such hands can make and
keep a home, Cecily." So she gave him her hand warm with young life
and strongly capable; then gazing down into its open palm, Sam
uttered this prophecy:</p>

<p>"Here I see gold, much wealth. You are going to be a very rich
woman. But here I see a prison also and in this prison&mdash;your
Ralph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" she wailed, trying quite vainly to free her hand. "Ah,
no!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" quoth Sam. "But to this vile prison and in splendid
coach, drives a grand and beautiful lady named Cecily
Croft&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"At her command the prison gates open, by the power of her money
the poor prisoner is freed, and when he kneels to thank her she
cries his name and he recognizes his loving faithful Cecily. And in
that moment&mdash;I hope&mdash;he knows his own unworthiness and
growing humble, becomes a better man."</p>

<p>Now when Sam released her hand she stood a while as though
entranced&mdash;until a shrewish voice at no great distance,
cried:</p>

<p>"Cec'ly! Oh, Cec'ly, where be ee gone&mdash;and all they cows to
milk! Come your ways now!" So, waking from her dream Cecily glanced
at its inspirer through sparkle of tears, nodded dumbly and hurried
away to her never-ending labour.</p>

<p>Sam was still gazing after her when once again he heard a
rustling behind him and starting round, saw how the ever-deepening
shadows had transformed the woodland to a glooming mystery wherein
something stirred. Every bush and tree became a menace, a stealthy
threat to his life&mdash;a life now so very precious because of
Andromeda; wherefore, thrusting hand into pocket Sam drew his
second pistol, cocked it and stood waiting. The leafy rustling grew
louder, nearer, until out from the shadows stepped a figure bloody
of face, dishevelled of person and bare of head, who, beholding
Sam, let fall a battered hat and leaning heavily upon his stick,
exclaimed in shaken accents:</p>

<p>"Blow...my...dicky!"</p>

<p>"Jasper!" cried Sam, hurrying to him.</p>

<p>"Dog...bite me!" sighed Mr. Shrig distressfully. "Ar, you can
burn my de-woted neck if I didn't expect to find you a
bleeding...stiffening...ca-daver&mdash;instead o' threatening me
with that pop."</p>

<p>"Sink me!" exclaimed Sam, uncocking and repocketing his weapon.
"What happened, Jasper, old fellow? You've been grassed and your
head cut&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Scratted, sir, only scratted, but&mdash;oh, pal, I have been
diddled and ditched by&mdash;your vould-be ass-assin! I hears the
shot, I speeds thereto, I has my daddles on the
murderer&mdash;almost, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you saw him, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Ar, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"A countryman, a yo-kel, ar&mdash;werry much so, hat,
neckercher, smockfrock and gaiters&mdash;all complete."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, you mean a poacher?"</p>

<p>"No, a murderer&mdash;as proved too much for J. Shrig. So my
sperrits is low, sir, and I'm shook mind and body! J.S. is so
hu-miliated, ar&mdash;I'm that humble I can hardly bear my own
company!"</p>

<p>"No, no," laughed Sam, setting arm about the speaker's drooping
shoulders. "Cheer up, old fellow, we're not beat yet, far from it.
So let's sit down, smoke a pipe and talk it over, come."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Mr. Shrig, mournfully, "ven I named you 'pal' being
flashed for 'brother,' I named you right! For if Failure&mdash;vith
a werry big eff&mdash;chills the beating throbber and o-bases the
soul, Friendship can varm it and give a leg-up. So, now, tobacker
it is!" Down they sat forthwith, and when their pipes were alight
and drawing, Mr. Shrig sighed:</p>

<p>"Pal Sam, no man can't trooly enj'y sitting down till he's been
shook up and flattened out by the butt of a gun."</p>

<p>"That was the way of it, eh, Jasper. I fancy I heard something
of the business, but never guessed it could be you."</p>

<p>"And...I had him!" said Mr. Shrig with sigh like a groan. "But
he broke free and fetched me such clout vith his gun as must ha'
done for me and been my final and to-tal qui-eetus but for this
here noble dicer o' mine!" And taking up his hat, Mr. Shrig gazed
wistfully at a great dent in its crown.</p>

<p>"Looks ruined, Jasper."</p>

<p>"No, pal, all as it needs is a hammer."</p>

<p>"Eh, hammer?"</p>

<p>"Ar, 'tis lined wi' iron, y'see, my inwention again.
Windictiveness in the form o' brick-bats, bludgeons and a
occasional chimbley-pot, though a gun-butt is coming it a bit
strong! Consequently here upon my tibby is a lump like a negg! Ar,
but for my dicer I'd be at this i-dentical moment, laying flat as a
flounder and dead as mutton."</p>

<p>"And the fellow was dressed like a countryman, eh, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Ar&mdash;even to his boots&mdash;hobnails."</p>

<p>"Did you see his face?"</p>

<p>"No, his chivvy vas hid by his neckercher and hat, and 'twas
pretty darkish among the trees, but&mdash;I see the end of his conk
and caught a glimp' of his eyes and&mdash;I shall know 'em
again!"</p>

<p>"Then we're still in the dark, Jasper, still not sure of his
identity?"</p>

<p>"Ar! And us had better get on afore it grows any darker and
somebody tries another shot and makes surer this time."</p>

<p>So up they rose and on they went, both somewhat gloomy and
silent, until before them lay Willowmead, its latticed casements
beaming homely welcome. At the wide yard gate they halted and,
sighing gustily, Mr. Shrig held out his hand, then let it fall,
saying mournfully:</p>

<p>"Sir, I've growed that humble as I can't expect you to take the
hand of a failure, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now damme," exclaimed Sam, seizing this hand to grasp it
firmly, "don't be such a juggins, Jasper! I've never felt such
kindness for you as I do tonight, because d'ye see I'm going to be
married."</p>

<p>"To Miss A?"</p>

<p>"Ay, none other."</p>

<p>"Then sir, Sam and pal, though grievous and werry desponding, I
humbly vish ye j'y, first a gal and then a b'y." Having said which,
Mr. Shrig sighed, shook his head and trudged heavily away.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch132" id="ch132"></a>CHAPTER XXXII. HIS LORDSHIP
COMMANDS</h3>

<p>Mr. Joliffe's trim wig was somewhat askew, his lean face showed
slightly pink, his eyes sparkled as he sat opposite Sam at this
choicely-laden table; he ate with gusto, drank with the respectful
deliberation due to such noble vintage, he talked and
laughed&mdash;yet all the while was sternly repressing some
powerful emotion, or so thought Sam. Thus when at last they leaned
back in their chairs, comfortably replete, Sam enquired:</p>

<p>"Well, Ben, what's on your mind?"</p>

<p>Mr. Joliffe smiled, viewed the wine in his glass with look very
like an ogle and sighed happily:</p>

<p>"This has been a meal worthy the occasion&mdash;a
great&mdash;hem&mdash;truly memorable and very singular occasion,
for this is indeed a day of days. So now, and before I explain
more, I think since you informed me how your fire-eating Captain
Harlow is so happily tamed by matrimony and even now upon his
honeymoon, we should recharge our glasses and pledge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, with all my heart!" cried Sam, reaching for the wine.
"Thanks, Ben! Come now and no heel-taps&mdash;health, joy and long
life to them&mdash;bless 'em!"</p>

<p>Now when this toast had been properly honoured, Mr. Joliffe set
down his empty glass, took out his snuff-box, glanced at it
absently, fobbed it again and leaning forward, said in hushed
though jubilant tone:</p>

<p>"And now, Sam, now&mdash;'tis my pleasure to inform you that I
have&mdash;hem&mdash;spun webs to such effect that your
blackguardly young cousin the Honourable Ralph is&mdash;under lock
and key, safely and securely prisoned with no hope or possibility
of enlargement or escape!"</p>

<p>"Good!" nodded Sam.</p>

<p>"Ah, but&mdash;better yet, his villainous sire, my lord Julian
will be as closely jailed three days hence! Yes, Sam, positively in
three short days you will take your lofty station in Society as
your true self Japhet, Earl of Wrybourne!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, rather gloomily. "Ah! And what then?"</p>

<p>"This of course is for you to decide, though, upon my soul, the
prospect appears to distress you!"</p>

<p>"It does, Ben, it does, damme! For, d'ye see, I'm merest
sailorman and shall make such a fool of an earl! Ay, sink
me&mdash;I shall be a sheer hulk...all adrift...or forever on my
beam-ends."</p>

<p>"No, Sam, dear me, no! To provide against such awkward
contingency, I shall engage the offices of a certain gentleman of
ancient very noble lineage to be your Maecenas, your mentor, guide
and perambulating vade-mecum, who shall instruct you as to your
dress, address and general deportment."</p>

<p>"Which," groaned Sam, "sounds very perfectly damnable!"</p>

<p>"Yet&mdash;most necessary!" said Mr. Joliffe, hiding a smile,
what time Sam scowled at his wine-glass.</p>

<p>Out came Mr. Joliffe's gold snuff-box again, but this time he
extracted a pinch, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"Cheer up, my dear fellow. Things might be worse&mdash;even
though you are young, an earl and stu-pendously rich! Yes, indeed,
there are worse troubles. And now regarding the business you wrote
about, pray how can I serve you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;first, Ben, at a rough estimate&mdash;about how much
am I worth?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Mr. Joliffe, closing his snuff-box and laying it
carefully upon the table. "Such vast possessions constantly
increasing since money begets money, are difficult to compute
exactly, but I can confidently assert that your total fortune
already amounts to considerably more than a million sterling!"</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed Sam, "I was afraid it would be pretty much but
this is worse than I expected&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh?" gasped the lawyer with clutch at his toppling spectacles.
"Worse,' d'ye say?"</p>

<p>"Ay. So much worse, Ben, that I can't bear it."</p>

<p>"Can't...bear&mdash;" Mr. Joliffe's voice failed him.</p>

<p>"No, Ben, I can't and won't! So I must get rid of some of it,
let's say half a million, and soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Half a mill&mdash;" Mr. Joliffe seemed to choke.</p>

<p>"So you'll please draw up a deed of gift to this amount in the
name of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sam...my dear fellow...you are joking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben, I was never more serious."</p>

<p>"But...a gift...five hundred thousand pounds...such vast sum...a
gift&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A million would be more, of course, Ben, so on second
thoughts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sam...Sam...what are you saying?" gasped Mr. Joliffe, peering
at him anxiously through and over his spectacles. "You are not
yourself&mdash;the wine perhaps&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I'm sober as a barn owl, Ben."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;a touch of the sun&mdash;or that wound in your head!
However, my dear Sam, do nothing in a hurry, I beg&mdash;I plead!
Defer this matter for a day or so, give yourself time to think...I
protest you confound me, indeed you alarm me, Sam!"</p>

<p>"Ben," he sighed, a little wearily, "I'm neither drunk nor
sun-struck nor crazed with my wound, and being perfectly sound o'
mind and body, I now desire you to draw up the necessary legal
what-nots, deeds, indentures, conveyances and so on, for the
bestowing of half my heritage to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good, great Je-hovah!" gasped Mr. Joliffe, dabbing at moist
brow with a table napkin. "Oh, Sam, think&mdash;for God's sake
think what you would do! Be advised and give up this incredible,
this preposterous folly."</p>

<p>"Mr. Joliffe," quoth Sam, becoming quite grim, "here and now my
lordship Japhet, Earl of Wrybourne, commands you as his lawyer to
prepare the proper legal instruments whereby my Lord of Wrybourne
can give, bestow and transfer half this fortune to Mistress Cecily
Croft&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>"A million!" repeated Mr. Joliffe in ghostly whisper, writhing
as if in bodily anguish. "This...oh, this is unheard
of...unbelievable! It's utterly preposterous!"</p>

<p>"Ay, damme, preposterous it is, Ben, that one man should own so
much, and that man myself. For, d'ye see, I never wanted all this
cursed money. In fact, had these Scropes not been scoundrels they
should have had this dam' Wrybourne heritage, ay&mdash;every penny.
As it is, I'm mightly glad to rid myself of even this small part of
it."</p>

<p>"Small part!" repeated Mr. Joliffe in voice like a moan. "Small!
Good Lord deliver us! Ha, Sam, d'ye know how much, have you any
conception of the vast sum you are throwing away so lightly, so
recklessly, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not throwing away, Ben, I'm giving it to a very worthy
young&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Woman, of course!" snapped Mr. Joliffe. "A poor creature who
will be victimized, hunted, pursued, hounded and beset by rogues
and rascals of every sort, fortune hunters all."</p>

<p>"Ay, but, d'ye see, Ben, she's of such sort herself that she
desires and will accept only one of these rogues and rascals, one
only, Ben, because he is truly of all rogues&mdash;the one,
ay&mdash;her own particular, long-chosen rascal. So get the
business done soon as you can, according to my lordship's herewith
express order and command, Mr. Joliffe."</p>

<p>"Then," said the lawyer, miserably, "you positively mean it? I
am actually ordered by your lordship to proceed in this&mdash;this
matter?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Joliffe, you are. And immediately."</p>

<p>"In-credible!"</p>

<p>"Yet true, be assured, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" sighed Mr. Joliffe, relaxing and with the twinkle back
in his eyes. "Do I comprehend? Am I to infer that this so extremely
fortunate young lady is...your future countess?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Joliffe. This lady is quite determined to marry a
scoundrel."</p>

<p>"Then," groaned Mr. Joliffe, with gesture of hopeless
resignation, "I&mdash;give up!"</p>

<p>"And no wonder!" said Sam, with flashing grin. "So, Ben, let's
finish the bottle&mdash;"</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, came a hollow knocking on the door, and
Tragedy entered in the dusty person and woebegone whiskers of "the
man Dan'l."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch133" id="ch133"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII. TELLS OF "THE
HOUR OF VENGEANCE"</h3>

<p>"Well," enquired Mr. Joliffe, "well, Daniel, my good fellow,
what news this time?"</p>

<p>"Sir, all as I can say is, gen'lemen both, the word is
'Jarsper.' You're wanted immediate and very special&mdash;gig's
a-waiting."</p>

<p>"But this," said Mr. Joliffe, sitting up, "this is very sudden
and most unusual. Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Joliffe, sir, things is always so a-doing. And, sir, 'tis
nigh on three o'clock and gig's a-waiting. So's Jarsper! Therefore,
and by your leaves, I'll desire you to obleege by stepping down to
the gig and, sirs, the livelier the better."</p>

<p>"But where are you taking us?" enquired Sam.</p>

<p>"To Jarsper, sir."</p>

<p>"Damme, I know that! Where is Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Half-a-mile or so t'other side o' Wrybourne village, sir."</p>

<p>"But where, you oyster, where exactly?"</p>

<p>"That old mill, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Sam, and said no more until they were throned
aloft on this high-wheeled vehicle and driving rapidly out of the
town; then:</p>

<p>"That accursed place!" said he abruptly. "Ay, it would be
there!"</p>

<p>"What would be where?" enquired Mr. Joliffe, clutching his hat
as they took a corner at speed.</p>

<p>"D'you know that old mill, Ben, a desolate ruin by a murderous
pool?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. It pertains to the Manor estate. Lord Julian's
property."</p>

<p>"Well, it has always seemed to me there's a curse hanging over
it. If ever a place should be haunted&mdash;that's the place!"</p>

<p>"Haunted? Pooh, Sam, tut-tut! You surely don't credit such
tarradiddleish foolery? Yet to be sure I've heard superstition
still sails the seas and you are a seaman though, being also
educated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Half-educated, Ben! However, if bitter grief, blank despair and
merciless evil can haunt a place they're lying there, ay, and with
springs on their cables ready to let go&mdash;ghosts o' vengeance
waiting their hour!"</p>

<p>"Dear me, Sam, you're very fanciful!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am, for I hate the place! And you must have heard evil
has been there more than once."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I'm aware people have been drowned there&mdash;two
only, I believe. But, my dear Sam, if the act of self-destruction
can eternally curse a place with ghosts, then what multitudes of
apparitions must forever haunt London Bridge, for instance."</p>

<p>"But, d'ye see, Ben, what I mean is that there are particular
places where the evil once wrought, still lives&mdash;waiting and
forever on the look-out."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! What for?"</p>

<p>"Lord knows&mdash;vengeance, maybe."</p>

<p>"Vengeance on whom?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;let's say the first cause of all the suffering and
despair."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Sam!"</p>

<p>"May-be-so, Ben. But there are places on this old Earth where
strange things do happen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Con-found it!" exclaimed Mr. Joliffe, clutching at his flighty
hat again. "Daniel, I forbid such perturbing speed! Drive less
recklessly!"</p>

<p>"Ax pardon, but not recklessly, Mr. Joliffe, sir&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Then abate this most discommoding pace."</p>

<p>"Can't be, sir."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Jarsper's orders, sir! 'Dan'l,' says he to me, 'you should do
it under the hour,' says he."</p>

<p>"Pree-poss-terous!" cried Mr. Joliffe jerkily as they jolted in
and out of a rut. "Scandalous...Insane&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Joliffe, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh, confound you, Daniel!"</p>

<p>"Yessir!"</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed the lawyer in indignant bafflement. "Sam, I
shall be boxing his ears if we don't talk and forget the crass
fellow and his driving. So tell me&mdash;you must have seen some
queer things in your travels."</p>

<p>"Plenty, Ben, especially in the wilder parts along the Main,
Inca, Aztec and Maya Indians. I lived with 'em once and right folk
I found them. Then among the savages o' the islands, I've known a
magic whereby a man may kill by word or just pointing with a bone
or some such&mdash;'You,' he'll say, 'must die in three days,' and
damme, Ben, die he does and in the three days! How it's done, I
don't know, but done it certainly is."</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded Mr. Joliffe, "I opine by the power of suggestion,
hypnotism or the like deviltries, of course."</p>

<p>"Ay, may be. Then there are cures just as wonderful..."</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Joliffe questioned, Sam held forth and Dan'l drove
until they were speeding through Wrybourne village just as the
church clock struck four.</p>

<p>"Astounding!" quoth Mr. Joliffe, resettling his ever-restive
hat, "we are here already and&mdash;alive! How much further,
Daniel?"</p>

<p>"About six minutes, sir."</p>

<p>Turning from the high-road down a narrow lane Dan'l whistled,
reined up and out from some leafy nook shot the boy Gimlet who,
taking the lathered horse by the bit, cried:</p>

<p>"Right-ho, Dan! Shall I drive him up an' down a bit to cool 'im
off?"</p>

<p>"Ar!" replied Dan'l, socketing whip and reins. "And you've
dropped an aitch!"</p>

<p>"Oh, blow that, Dan'l! 'Op down and lemme git h-up!"</p>

<p>"Now," sighed Dan'l, descending to earth with lithe agility,
"now you've got 'em in the wrong places; This way, gents both,
foller me."</p>

<p>Off from the lane amid thickets he led them by a mazy track,
past that sullen, gloomy pool, and so at last through a yawning
doorway into a musty twilight shut in by mouldering, age-old walls,
up crumbling steps to a place bright with sunbeams flooding in at a
jagged hole that once had been a small window, a pleasant light
which showed them Mr. Shrig, pipe in mouth, seated upon a broken
box beside a long, muffled form couched upon a bed of rotting hay
and wind-drifted leaves.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, sirs!" said Mr. Shrig, rising and tapping out pipe
upon broad palm very tenderly. "I have made bold to send for you to
inform you as how this here case has turned itself upside down and
inside out! Vich sirs, J. Shrig here and now is bound to con-fess
as Fortun'&mdash;not content vith diddling and ditching same, has
now fetched your humble a leveller as has fair doubled me up, sirs,
and knocked me and this here case sky high! And if you ax me how
so, I now begs you, sirs both, to&mdash;take a look at this."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Mr. Shrig stooped, twitched away the dingy
covering&mdash;to show that at sight of which Mr. Joliffe recoiled
with a strangled cry, while Sam leaned nearer to gaze down with
expression of speechless disbelief changing to certainty and
sickening dread:</p>

<p>For there, gazing up at him with awful fixity, faint-smiling,
couched with gracious ease, white hands folded reverently upon
motionless breast, lay Lord Julian Scrope.</p>

<p>"Not...not dead, Shrig?" whispered Mr. Joliffe.</p>

<p>"Ar!...As mutton, sir."</p>

<p>"In-credible! For...oh, my God...he looks alive...and
younger...handsomer even than I ever remember him and
actually...saintly! His hands...folded in prayer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vell&mdash;no, sir. I shouldn't hardly call it prayer, Mr.
Joliffe."</p>

<p>"But why not? What d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"This, sir!" answered Mr. Shrig, and stooping, drew and held
apart those so reverently folded hands to show what they had been
clasping. And now Sam also recoiled, lifting his hands
instinctively as against some blinding horror...the haft of that
knife had once been his own, its keen blade now
deep-driven...Andromeda's knife...While he yet stared, sick with an
ever-growing dread, Mr. Shrig covered this awful thing with the
stained old horse blanket that did duty for a shroud.</p>

<p>"Sam," whispered Mr. Joliffe, taking his nerveless arm, "now I'm
remembering your words, yes and almost believing&mdash;this is the
ghostly hour of vengeance."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch134" id="ch134"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV. TELLS OF A
PARTING</h3>

<p>They were out again all three in the sunny air, Mr. Joliffe
pale, shaken though full of pertinent enquiry. Sam as livid, but
frowning and speechless; yet it was upon him that Mr. Shrig kept
his keen gaze as he answered the lawyer's questions.</p>

<p>"When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"From information received, sir, I'd put it about dinner-time,
'twixt ha-past twelve and two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Have you any clues, Shrig, any suspects?"</p>

<p>"Ar, cloos a-plenty, sir, and suspects three or four. Because,
as corpses go, his lordship's a pretty informative stiff and has
told me two or three helpful fax."</p>

<p>"You mean, I suppose, by his general appearance?"</p>

<p>"I do, Mr. Joliffe. In the first place he tells me as how he has
come to this here bee-utifully lonesome spot to meet a
friend&mdash;an ooman, p'raps, some willage beauty or, p'raps
again, a young ladylike fe-male!" Here, the keen eyes watched Sam's
motionless, silent figure, saw the powerful hands clench
suddenly.</p>

<p>"But, Shrig, why should you suspect any woman?"</p>

<p>"Sir, his lordship being a Scrope was therefore nat'rally
add-dickted to The Sex. Also this here solitood! Also the motive
ain't robbery. Then you'll ha' noticed as he died smiling werry
loverlike! Verefore and therefore my first suspect is of the
femmy-nine gender."</p>

<p>"Ye-es, the inference is reasonable, Shrig.
Well&mdash;hum&mdash;to whom do your suspicions point? Have you any
particular woman in mind?"</p>

<p>A moment of tense silence, of agonizing expectancy and Sam's
eyes closing as against some unbearable vision.</p>

<p>"Well, Shrig, I asked you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ar, Mr. Joliffe, you did. And, sir, I now answers you full and
free&mdash;ekker alone responds&mdash;as yet."</p>

<p>"Ah, then you are not certain the&mdash;hem&mdash;culprit is a
woman?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not by no manner o' means&mdash;so fur!"</p>

<p>"And indeed," mused Mr. Joliffe, "on second thoughts this would
hardly seem a woman's crime. The fatal weapon, I noticed, was
powerfully driven, completely buried, suggesting strength with
perfect accuracy, which argues coolness and determination."</p>

<p>"Werry true, sir. But some females can be cool as icicles and
most ex-tremely determinated. How say you, Mr. Felton, sir?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" exclaimed Sam, starting. "Oh, I'll sheet home, bear away
and leave you to it." And off he went at leisurely pace until
beyond their sight and hearing&mdash;then he began to run as if
Despair itself were on his heels, nor checked until he was in the
leafy shade of Jane's "'Chanted Forest." Here he paused to fetch
his breath and seeing the great old "magic tree" before him, went
and leaned dejectedly against its rugged bole while he strove
desperately to order the wild and fearful commotion of his
mind.</p>

<p>For some while he stood thus until hearing a cry he glanced up
and saw Andromeda speeding towards him.</p>

<p>"Sam...Oh, Sam!" she panted and sinking into his ready arms,
clung to him shuddering so violently that fearful doubt grew to a
great horror surging over him like a wave. Then she was looking up
at him wide-eyed:</p>

<p>"My dear," she whispered, fearfully. "What is it? What have you
come...to tell me?"</p>

<p>And whispering also, he answered:</p>

<p>"Lord Julian is dead."</p>

<p>"Yes," she sighed, hiding her face against him. "What must I do
now?"</p>

<p>"Then...Andromeda, you...knew?"</p>

<p>"Yes...I knew...hours ago."</p>

<p>"But how...how could you?"</p>

<p>"Because...Uncle Arthur told me."</p>

<p>"When, Andromeda, when?"</p>

<p>"What can it matter now...why are you so strangely, so
dreadfully altered?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," he whispered, gesturing towards the empty sheath
at her girdle, "where is the knife?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sam&mdash;ah, why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because it was that knife...mine...your knife that killed him!"
Now at this, she cried out as if he had struck her and crouching
against the tree, covered her face. Then Sam's arms were about her
protectingly.</p>

<p>"My own dear," said he, drawing her close, "nothing matters
except our love&mdash;" Swiftly she looked up at him, and seeing
all the agony in his too honest eyes, nodded her head, saying in
oddly expressionless voice:</p>

<p>"Why, of course&mdash;only yesterday you saw the knife in my
hand&mdash;you saw me strike that murderous blow&mdash;you heard me
say I could kill him! And now he lies dead! Oh, my poor
dear&mdash;and you love me still."</p>

<p>"Of course, and for ever."</p>

<p>"Even though you think, you suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, for God's sake!" he whispered harshly. "Yesterday I saw
you drop that cursed knife&mdash;tell me&mdash;did you pick it up
again?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask, Sam dear?"</p>

<p>"Because I've been hoping, yes and praying&mdash;as I am
now&mdash;that you forgot it&mdash;left it lying here by this tree,
and that someone else found it."</p>

<p>"And suppose," said she, looking deep into his eyes, "suppose I
tell you that I found it&mdash;and used it?"</p>

<p>"Then tonight, no&mdash;this very hour, I'll carry you away to
the coast...a harbour I know...there I'll buy or steal a boat o'
some kind...stand away down channel and pray God we may win to
France or be picked up by French or Spanish cruisers so we get
clear of England and English ships."</p>

<p>"And what," she whispered, "oh, what of poor Uncle Arthur? Would
you take him with us?"</p>

<p>"Ay, even that&mdash;for your sake."</p>

<p>Andromeda sighed deeply and hiding her face against him
murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, my brave, faithful, beloved man! Then so you must&mdash;for
I did lose the knife and Uncle found it."</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord!" Sam breathed. "You saw him find it?"</p>

<p>"No. But last night I kept watch. I heard Wrybourne Church clock
strike eleven and a little while after...he stole from the
caravan...the moon was up and I saw the flash of that hateful knife
and&mdash;Oh, my dear&mdash;he raised it heavenwards and kissed it
as if it had been some holy thing. Then I called to him and ran,
but he fled from me into the wood and I lost him...So I sent Esau
after him, but the dog loves him, and after all he is only a dog.
Uncle Arthur was away all night but returned today all broken with
fatigue and... Oh, from words I heard him muttering&mdash;I knew
Lord Julian was dead and...Lady Barbara avenged. So then I prayed
God to send you to me&mdash;and here I am, safe in your dear arms
and at peace for a little while."</p>

<p>"And here," said Sam, folding her closer, "here you shall be
safe while I have life and strength&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meda! My love, my joy and only consolation..." Wailing these
words, Mr. Verinder tottered into view, a woeful figure, his finery
of garments rumpled and stained, his unshaven face convulsed by
sharpest agony. "Oh Meda," he gasped, "I am lost&mdash;lost, broken
and abandoned of my God...disappointed, heartbroken, hopeless and
abject. And now since God has denied me the vengeance I hoped,
prayed and lived for, you cannot, must not, shall not desert and
render me utterly desolate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir," began Sam, but she checked him with a gesture,
saying:</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Arthur, your enemy is dead, so how has God denied
you? Lord Julian is dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know this, I saw him, child. Yes, I beheld him
lying&mdash;in his glory, beautified by death! Yes, he&mdash;this
vile wretch, this foul, black-hearted villain lay there with his
youth renewed, hands folded upon his dead breast, showing like a
sleeping saint&mdash;his face so evil in life, now in death, most
fair, its wickedness all smoothed away by deadly steel deep driven
and, oh malediction&mdash;by other hand than mine! He at peace and
glorious in death&mdash;I alive and woeful&mdash;So does God mock
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Uncle, you had the knife."</p>

<p>"The knife, yes&mdash;ah, the sweet, sharp knife, I had it
but&mdash;Oh God, Oh God&mdash;I lost it in the wood, dropped it in
the hateful, blinding dark. I sought it, upon my knees I sought it,
praying&mdash;yet vain, all vain alike my seeking and my prayers,
for I found it not. But in the dawn I came upon a stone, a
sharp-edged, jagged flint-stone, though I yearned for the sharp,
bright knife..."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle, and what did you do then?"</p>

<p>"Fell asleep, child, and dreamed gloriously until the birds
waked me with their singing. So I lay and harkened to this that is
the very music of God&mdash;until I heard a laugh that changed to
the bleating of a sheep and after this a rush and rustle of
wind...Then I found myself close to that ruined mill I have twice
essayed to paint and there I found him dead and mocking me with his
glory. So, because it seems God has turned from me I fled to thee,
my one remaining comfort and only joy, confiding in the hope, nay,
the assurance thai you will never abandon me, never&mdash;never
forsake me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither will I, sir," said Sam and rather grimly. "You shall
find me ever ready to serve you when Andromeda is my wife. Here
will we live and together we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;and no!" cried Mr. Verinder, wildly. "You are but
common clay with no music in your soul. Your presence is a blight I
cannot, must not endure. Your very shadow chills the genius within
me and for which alone I endure life! Wed him, Meda, if you will,
yield that sweet and lovely body to his brutish love,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Avast!" growled Sam. "Hold hard, Mr. Verinder! How can my love
be 'brutish' now when last time we met I was your 'dear Felton' and
'a man raised up by God!' Ay, and you gave us your blessing into
the bargain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes I did!" said Mr. Verinder, peevishly. "Of course I
did. But since then, God has changed towards me and therefore all
else is changed&mdash;quite, quite altered and&mdash;especially my
unhappy self!"</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, "you're a confoundingly changeable customer,
sir, but then, d'ye see, I'm not, and especially as regards
Andromeda. So the sooner you change back again the better. However,
instead of one slave you're going to have two, ay&mdash;just as
soon as wedlock can make me so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how?" panted Mr. Verinder, clenching plump, white
fists. "Do I understand you will force your attentions upon my
beloved niece, this sweet child of my adoption? Will you actually
defy me?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, ignore you."</p>

<p>"Oh, insolence! Had I a whip I should strike you&mdash;" Here
Andromeda took him in her arms, but even while she strove to soothe
him he flourished dimpled fists, crying: "Ah, were you a gentleman
I'd call you out and shoot you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Arthur, hush now! Oh, my dear, calm yourself&mdash;there,
there! Come and rest while I brew tea&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>"Tea? Ah, yes, yes. I'm all foredone, I languish! Tea, that
blessed panacea&mdash;yes, go prepare it, beloved child, and hurry,
hurry! Felton and I shall follow. Dear Felton, forgive me, I was
hasty. I am not myself&mdash;so pray, dear Felton, say I am
forgiven."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, heartily."</p>

<p>"So, you hear the dear, good fellow, Meda? Go you now, my ever
precious, go&mdash;go!" Slowly she turned and unwillingly obeyed.
Now scarcely was she out of sight than Mr. Verinder uttered a
pitiful, wailing cry and leapt headlong at Sam, who thus surprised
had some difficulty in fending off this attack, so that Andromeda,
speeding back to this outcry, arrived just in time to see her Uncle
fall heavily.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;trickery!" exclaimed Sam. "Damme, I scarce touched
him"; but writhing upon the grass, Mr. Verinder gasped:</p>

<p>"Meda...Oh Meda, now...you see...how he hates and misuses
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" retorted Sam, bitterly. "You aren't worth my hate, I scorn
you for the deceitful, miserable half-wit you are."</p>

<p>"No, no!" wailed Mr. Verinder, covering his face. "I am not
mad&mdash;not that&mdash;Ah God&mdash;not mad!"</p>

<p>"Better so," growled Sam, driven beyond endurance, "better mad
than selfish liar and trickster."</p>

<p>"Andromeda," gasped her uncle, crawling to her feet and writhing
there, "oh, my brave darling, comfort me, cherish me, save me! You
are my very life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent&mdash;you!" cried Sam harshly. "Now, Andromeda, be
warned...Oh, my dear, you are wasting your life and mine for a
selfish, cowardly trickster who plays upon your fears and makes
your devotion fetters to enslave you to his service, damn
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beloved child," sighed Mr. Verinder, rising feebly to his
knees, "without you I cannot and will not live. Wed this man if you
will, this cruel man so harsh, so brutal&mdash;wed him and in that
hour I die. Yes, here kneeling before the Great God of our
Salvation, I swear I will end my hated life and give back my poor
soul to my Creator! So choose between us, my dearest one,
choose."</p>

<p>"Ay," muttered Sam, bitterly, seeing her look and reading it
aright, "choose and be done."</p>

<p>Now glancing from yearning, stalwart man down to the piteous
suppliant at her feet, she hesitated, yet when at last she found
speech she answered as he had dreaded and expected, saying
firm-lipped though with lifeless voice:</p>

<p>"Sam dearest, I have chosen...as I must...because I
am...Andromeda."</p>

<p>"You mean," he demanded, brokenly, "sacrifice? That
you...I...this is the end?" And in the same dull, passionless tone,
she answered:</p>

<p>"Yes...my beloved."</p>

<p>Sam's powerful fists quivered, his grim lips parted in a snarl,
but&mdash;reading the supplication in her golden eyes, he choked
back bitterness of despair with fury of reproach and bowed his
head, saying after a moment and very humbly:</p>

<p>"As you will...but I shall always love you."</p>

<p>"And I," she murmured, and always in the same dreary monotone,
"I shall be...always...only yours." But saying this, she drew from
her bosom the gold chain and jewelled pendant, his gift, and held
it out to him on her open palm, whispering:</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, I have never worn it because I wanted your dear
hands to set it about me, so do it now, but kiss it first that it
may comfort me the more when I shall touch and kiss it&mdash;in my
loneliness. Kiss it, dear, then fasten it about my throat." Dumbly
he obeyed though his big hands were very unsteady as he locked the
chain about this round white neck. And when this was done at
last:</p>

<p>"Kiss me!" she murmured. So their lips met in a sweet agony of
farewell.</p>

<p>"Now," she sighed. "Oh now, my ever dearest, go...in mercy to us
both&mdash;ah, beloved&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>Then, uttering no word, Sam turned and with not one backward
glance, trudged away to&mdash;emptiness.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch135" id="ch135"></a>CHAPTER XXXV. TELLS HOW AND WHY
SAM WAS TOO LATE</h3>

<p>And now treading this well-remembered path, Sam checked and
stumbled more than once, for, though his scowling eyes were
tearless, grief was blinding him to all save the memory of
Andromeda's last despairing look in such pitiful contrast to the
firm-set, too-resolute lips that for duty's sake had bidden him
away; thus now, because of her indomitable will, Sam despaired
also.</p>

<p>The countryside about him, radiant with sun, was beautiful as
ever, birds near and far piped and chirruped joyfully as ever, but
Sam blundered and stumbled through a bleak desolation towards a
blank dreariness where for him was no future. Only with him went
the memory of Andromeda's beloved, stricken face that seemed to
blot out the very universe.</p>

<p>In this state of bitter despair and hopeless dejection Sam had
reached a certain familiar stile when he espied a woman crouched
beneath the hedge nearby and was about to pass on, but something in
her look and attitude arrested him and he knew her for the lady of
the lonely cottage in the by-road and he paused.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, marm," said he, hat in hand, "but is anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid so, sir," she answered, with shyly rueful
smile. "Crossing the stile very awkwardly, I have turned my ankle
so painfully that I can neither stand nor go, and my cottage is too
far to hop, though I have done my best."</p>

<p>"Then of course I'll carry you&mdash;if you'll allow."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I&mdash;I could not&mdash;you could not. I mean it is
some distance."</p>

<p>"However, we'd manage it by easy stages."</p>

<p>"You are greatly kind, sir...and this is such a lonely
place...and I cannot remain here all night."</p>

<p>"No, marm, it stands to reason you can't."</p>

<p>"But to&mdash;to so burden you, sir, a stranger."</p>

<p>"Not quite, marm, I spoke to you some days ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you did. I remember now you are the gentleman
who wished to be directed."</p>

<p>"Not gentleman, just a sailorman and my name is Felton, Sam
Felton&mdash;you may have heard mention of it&mdash;perhaps?" Now
as he propounded this question, Sam watched the almost
too-sensitive features of this lady, the luminous eyes, delicate
nostrils and mouth with its sweetly-gentle curves, and read in this
face such unaffected surprise, such artless sincerity that he knew
she spoke truly when she answered:</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Felton, how could I and why should I?"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, keen gaze still intent, "I thought maybe my
name had been mentioned by your son."</p>

<p>"My son?" she repeated, her pale face suddenly glorified by the
mother-light beaming in her long-lashed eyes. "Then you know my
Eustace? I am glad, for he needs a friend, poor boy&mdash;he like
his mother is very solitary and much too sensitive. So I should
like you for his friend&mdash;if it may be."</p>

<p>"Why, marm, d'ye see, I...we have met only once or twice and
then I...we...well, didn't seem to have much in common."</p>

<p>"I...I am not surprised, sir," sighed she and with such
mournfulness of look and tone that Sam flinched. "He is much too
high-strung and of a quite painful shyness&mdash;but then so am I,
so perhaps I'm to blame. As it is, he lives only for his
music&mdash;and me, and yes, poor hopeless boy, one other! And he
is my hope, his tender love has been my one joy and solace, for Mr.
Felton, in this one particular I am humbly like the Man of Sorrows,
because I too am 'acquainted with grief'&mdash;though thank our
kind God, I have my dear son."</p>

<p>"And he," murmured Sam, "should be thankful for such mother,
mine's dead, d'ye see."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" she whispered, touching his sleeve very gently. "I
see you loved her deeply. So now this mother would comfort you if
she could&mdash;please know me better if you will. I am Ruth
Jennings and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now God love you!" exclaimed Sam impulsively, "'Ruth' was my
mother's name and therefore the loveliest in all this
world&mdash;except one"&mdash;and speaking, he bowed his head to
kiss this slender, comforting hand.</p>

<p>"Dear boy!" she sighed. "I dare to think your so loved mother
looking down on us from God's light, is blessing me now in her
son's kiss. So more, oh, more than ever I hope that some day
perhaps you may bless my son with your friendship. And now&mdash;if
you will help me I shall be so very grateful."</p>

<p>Laying by his stick, Sam raised her in his powerful arms, saying
as he did so:</p>

<p>"Now pray rest easy. Try to think we are very old friends."</p>

<p>"That will not be difficult," said she, smiling, "though you are
quite a boy really, but then all men creatures are great big
children...And I do hope you don't find me too heavy."</p>

<p>"On the contrary you are much too light," he answered, striding
along with her easily. "But I'm wondering why you were
so&mdash;startled when first I spoke to you in the lane?"</p>

<p>"That was because my poor Eustace has been so terribly nervous
lately. He imagined he was being followed&mdash;especially in the
woods&mdash;a pale man and an impish boy who grinned and
peeped&mdash;which sounds absurdly fanciful, and yet for the moment
I thought you must be one of them."</p>

<p>"But why should anyone watch your son?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I cannot imagine. I hope and believe it is all
his fancy&mdash;though for some time now he has seemed
changed."</p>

<p>"Oh? Ah?" said Sam, keeping his gaze on the path before them.
"Since when?"</p>

<p>"More than a year. He came flying to me one evening crying out
that he was lost in the dark&mdash;as he used to do sometimes when
a little boy. But I comforted him at last by playing part of a
sonata he was composing&mdash;such lovely music! Yet there are
times even now when he seems&mdash;dreadfully troubled...and it
hurts me to know he has a secret from his mother. To be sure he is
deeply in love, but this is no secret."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam. "Who with?"</p>

<p>"A very beautiful young lady though rather odd, I think, because
she lives like a gipsy in the woods with an even odder
relative...Perhaps, after all, she may be the true reason for his
grief&mdash;you see, he has loved her so long and quite without
hope, he tells me. It is when he visits these people, they are very
musical, that he thinks he is being watched and followed. Only the
other day my darling came to me in quite frantic state&mdash;indeed
I do not know what I should have done but for that good, kind Mr.
Brown&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh, m'lady&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a Mr. Caleb Brown, such a dear, quaint, kindly person. Do
you happen to know him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Pray how did he manage&mdash;I mean how did you meet
him?"</p>

<p>"Months ago! I was trying to dig my garden, but the ground was
so hard and I am not at all clever with a spade. Mr. Brown happened
to see me and proffered his help and he was so very kindly, so
quaint and gentle that I could not refuse. Since then he has helped
me quite often."</p>

<p>"Does he know your son?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Mr. Brown loves to sit and hear him play his violin
while I accompany on the harp or pianoforte&mdash;though he often
says&mdash;I mean Mr. Brown, of course&mdash;that he has an
untutored ear, though he calls it an 'untootered year.' Now do pray
put me down and take a rest&mdash;" But at this moment was a cry
and Cecily Croft hurried to meet them, enquiring anxiously:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Felton, is she hurt? Dear Mrs. Jennings, whatever is
it?"</p>

<p>"Dear child, nothing more than a sprained ankle."</p>

<p>"'Tis bad enough, mam&mdash;so terrible swollen! Can I
help?"</p>

<p>"If you will hurry on to the cottage and put on the kettle for
tea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll run. I was on my way there with your butter and a
loaf I made special for you...And I'll have things ready to tend
that poor ankle!" And away sped Cecily, fleet and graceful as a
stag and despite the basket she carried.</p>

<p>"So beautiful!" sighed Mrs. Jennings, looking after her. "So
sweetly good! I do hope she at least will have a happy life."</p>

<p>"D'you think she won't, m'lady?"</p>

<p>"Well, her uncle and aunt are not very kind to her and I'm
afraid the dear innocent has given her love unwisely."</p>

<p>"Ay, you mean young Ralph Scrope. D'you know him, m'lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, averting his look. "I did once, but now
I&mdash;do not."</p>

<p>"Would you say he might be altered for the better?"</p>

<p>"No, never&mdash;with such a father."</p>

<p>"D'you think such a father would be much better&mdash;dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"So do I!" nodded Sam. "And others ha' thought the same. And,
m'lady, now we'll carry on, if you're ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, smiling up at him now. "Yes, my gentle
Hercules. But please why do you call me your lady?"</p>

<p>"Because, next to 'Mother' and 'home' and 'woman,' it's the best
word I know."</p>

<p>Then Sam bore her on again nor stayed until somewhat breathless
and spent, he reached the cottage gate at last and there halted and
scowled&mdash;to see Mr. Shrig in the trim garden standing very
still and apparently lost in profound contemplation of a
flower-pot.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Brown, how nice to see you!"</p>

<p>Starting violently, Mr. Shrig turned, stared&mdash;then hastened
to open the gate, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Brown, how pale you are! And there really is nothing
serious, merely a twisted ankle. Pray come indoors and when Cecily
has helped me bathe it, we will all have a nice, cosy tea."</p>

<p>Unspeaking, Sam bore her into the cottage, laid her gently upon
a couch, smiled away her thanks and stepped out into the garden,
where he beheld Mr. Shrig staring fixedly at an onion, one of a
row.</p>

<p>"Jasper," he demanded, "how the devil can you do it?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" murmured Mr. Shrig, his gaze still intent.</p>

<p>"How can you trick yourself into such home as this&mdash;worm
your way between such mother and her son? Damme, it's not
decent!"</p>

<p>"Ar!" sighed Mr. Shrig. "And, pal, talking o' vorms I'll ax you
to remember as I'm Caleb Brown yereabouts."</p>

<p>"Yours is a cursed deceitful profession!"</p>

<p>"Ar, that it are, so right you are, Sammy pal. And I'd like you
to in-form me at vich partickler p'int in the landskip you found
Mrs. J.?"</p>

<p>"The stile beyond the second spinney."</p>

<p>"Vas she a-coming or a-going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, and shouldn't tell you if I did."</p>

<p>"Ho!" exclaimed Mr. Shrig. "So? Im-pede The Law now, is it? For
J. Shrig being a Limb o' the Law is thereby, as in dooty bound,
com-pelled&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Jennings called to them through the open
lattice.</p>

<p>"Do please come in and sit down, Cecily has nearly finished with
me and so cleverly, bless her! Then we&mdash;Oh, Mr. Brown, I hear
the kettle boiling over&mdash;in the kitchen, will you please see
to it?"</p>

<p>"A pleasure, marm!"</p>

<p>Thus presently seated all four in this small parlour, a
strangely pleasant meal they had, thanks to the charm and
unaffected grace of their gentle hostess. Thereafter, assisted by
Mr. Shrig's sturdy arm, she crossed to the piano, saying very
diffidently:</p>

<p>"Now...if you do not mind, I&mdash;I should like to show you why
I am so proud of my dear son...I will play for you&mdash;music he
composed for and has dedicated to his mother, may I?"</p>

<p>"Do please!" answered Sam.</p>

<p>"Honoured, marm!" murmured Mr. Shrig.</p>

<p>"You know I always love to hear you play it, marm," said
Cecily.</p>

<p>Then reaching her slender hands to the keyboard, this mother
filled the air with a son's love wrought into splendid sound, a
sweetly plaintive melody often lost in surging counter-themes, yet
as often recurring&mdash;a melody that was to haunt Sam
hereafter.</p>

<p>"Oh...lovely!" sighed Cecily, when the last echo had died
away.</p>

<p>"That," said Sam, "that is noble music."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, smiling, "Eustace has genius...some
day...perhaps it will bless the world. I have great hopes of my
dear son."</p>

<p>And presently, with her gently spoken thanks and farewell in his
ears, Sam followed Mr. Shrig out of this small, lonely cottage and
for some while neither uttered a word. When at last Sam spoke it
was with a diffidence very strange in him.</p>

<p>"Jasper, you're a law officer and will think me a sentimental
fool when I tell you I feel as if we had been on&mdash;holy
ground...for d'ye see, that gracious, gentle lady makes her little
cottage a holy place...sacred...just because of her own
goodness."</p>

<p>"Agreed, pal&mdash;ar, werry much so!"</p>

<p>"And now, Jasper, now damme I'm wishing, for her sake, I'd
been...a little kinder, less hostile to her son. However, I'll make
up for it next time we meet, ay, I'll be more friendly."</p>

<p>"You can't, pal."</p>

<p>"Eh? And why the devil not?"</p>

<p>"Because you're too late."</p>

<p>"How can that be?"</p>

<p>"Pal," said Mr. Shrig, easing out his large, silver watch and
consulting it, "you have missed him by eggs-ackly two hours and
fifty-three minutes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grasping his arm, Sam halted him and thus face to face, demanded
in harsh whisper:</p>

<p>"Jasper, are you trying to tell me it was&mdash;her son killed
Lord Julian and is now safe away? If so, good luck to him say I!
Come, let's hear&mdash;speak man, speak will ye."</p>

<p>"Pal," sighed Mr. Shrig, "never in all my puff have I been so
near piping my eye as this here afternoon, and the cause
thereof&mdash;his mother's vords&mdash;you'll mind 'em: 'Some day,'
says she, 'he'll bless the vorld! I've great hopes o' my dear son,'
says she&mdash;and all the time this son she's so proud of&mdash;is
laying stiff and cold and werry damp&mdash;poor lady!" Sam fell
back a step and when he spoke it was in dreadful, broken
whisper:</p>

<p>"Jasper...oh, Jasper...you never mean...ha&mdash;what do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Death, pal! Her son has took the only road, the best,
ar&mdash;and the cleanest road up and out of it all. Fellerdesee!
That conwenient pool! By my con-ni'vance! For his mother's
sake!"</p>

<p>"Christ-Jesus," gasped Sam. "Christ pity her...the poor, sweet,
gentle soul...God comfort her!"</p>

<p>"Same here and amen!" muttered Mr. Shrig. "I come to break the
noos to her, but s'soon as I see her in your arms s'helpless, I
couldn't say a word, my chaffer refused its office, ar&mdash;burn
my neck if it didn't! And now&mdash;" here, fumbling in breast, he
drew thence his bulbous pocketbook wherefrom he extracted a folded
paper, saying: "Seeing as how there's mention o' your lordship
herein, your lordship had better look it over." Unfolding this
paper he passed it to Sam, who read these words hastily though
firmly written in pencil:</p>

<blockquote>I scribble these lines in gratitude to that kind friend
who for my mother's sake permits me the better way. I killed Lord
Julian because he was my father. I discovered this but lately with
the fact that he had deceived my beloved mother with a false
marriage and would have harmed her yet again. I have also to inform
you that together with the lately deceased Lord Julian I was
concerned in the death of his brother and my uncle, the late Earl,
thirteen months since. Now in my turn I go where I must, but in the
comforting hope of joyous reunion with the one solitary soul whose
faith and love never failed me, she who has made my sorry existence
bearable, this pure angel on earth&mdash;my beloved mother. May I
venture to hope the new Earl Japhet, known as S. Felton, will care
for her in this pitiful life until she in due time shall join me in
the greater and happier. In which hope I subscribe myself, for the
first and last time,<br>
<br>
EUSTACE (by natural right) LORD SCROPE.</blockquote>

<p>"And," said Mr. Shrig, taking and refolding this letter, "there
y'are!"</p>

<p>"But, oh damme!" exclaimed Sam, greatly troubled. "This
frightful news will pretty near kill her! It must be broken to her
very gently by someone she knows well...a friend...Ay&mdash;Jasper,
this must be your duty for she calls you 'friend'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, pal! That's the reason as I can't. It must be you&mdash;ar,
you've had her in your arms&mdash;so you it is!"</p>

<p>"Never in this world!"</p>

<p>"Werry good, then I must make it that there handsome young
fe-male Ces'ly, Mistress Croft. Let's turn back and meet same."</p>

<p>"No, Jasper, I've had enough for one day, ay&mdash;too much,
damme! For, d'ye see, had I only been a little kinder to the poor
fellow...been his friend...this might never have happened."</p>

<p>"And yet again, it might, Sam pal. For I can lay sich
information agin Number Vun deceased as'll make you vonder as he
didn't get hisself de-ceased long afore today, and makes his bloody
finish werry nat'ral and proper&mdash;though being Murder and hence
The Capital Act, the Law must take its course, Justice be
windicated and myself the means of&mdash;Ah, by Goles&mdash;there's
Missis Ces'ly crossing the medder yonder&mdash;now's our
chance!"</p>

<p>"Ay, so I'll leave you to it, Jasper, and bear away for
home."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch136" id="ch136"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI. IN WHICH JASPER
SHRIG BIDS "GOOD-BYE"</h3>

<p>The old farmhouse lay very hushed and silent for Captain Ned and
his bride were still away. Aunt Deborah was visiting Grannyanne,
and Sam, finding it thus deserted, went forth into the orchard and
the better to occupy his troubled mind, set himself to construct a
rustic table to match the seat that now stood invitingly beneath
his favourite tree.</p>

<p>But in a little while, as if lured by the rasp of saw and ring
of busy hammer, came Nancy, light of foot, bright of eye and
flushed of cheek, who having saluted him with shy curtsy, said
between ruddy, smiling lips:</p>

<p>"La, sir, you was all wrong about&mdash;my Tom! 'Twas me as he
intended for arl the time."</p>

<p>"Good!" sighed Sam. "And you said 'yes,' I hope?"</p>

<p>"'Deed, sir&mdash;I had to, for Tom were that sudden&mdash;so
fierce and masterful that ef I hadn't give him 'yes,' I du
b'leeve&mdash;Oh my&mdash;he'd ha' stifled me, he would!"</p>

<p>"All quite proper and ship-shape, Nancy. I hope he'll stifle you
as properly and pretty often when you are his...wife." Here Sam,
hesitating at the word, sighed again.</p>

<p>"La, sir, what things ee du say! But, oh, Mr. Felton, why du ee
sigh so heavy and show so grievous?"</p>

<p>"Do I, Nancy?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that ee du. Your eyes be that woeful sad! Shall I bring ee
a jug o' our home-brew? There be nought like strong ale for to
comfort a man's sorrows."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Nancy. You're wise as you're lovely. Lord, what a wife
you'll make! Tom's a mighty lucky fellow!"</p>

<p>"Lud&mdash;Mr. Felton!" she exclaimed, with smiling, conscious
blush, and away she sped.</p>

<p>Sam was miserably contrasting Tom's happy lot with his own
misery when Tom himself came striding to salute in smart,
quarterdeck manner, saying:</p>

<p>"Sir, by your leave I'm here to report operation com-pletely
successful and now begs to express gratitood for same, very much
so, sir."</p>

<p>"Good!" quoth Sam again, with another deep sigh and scowling
blackly at his hammer. "Though damme if I know why some fellows
have all the luck!"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, true enough. And I'm one o' the luckiest and all
b'reason o' you, sir. For, according to your orders, I stood away
to wind'ard, plying off and on, kept her in my lee until of her own
accord, sir, she bore up, run me aboard and brought me to close
action."</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, dejectedly, "and how then?"</p>

<p>"Why then, sir, she demands the who of it, so I grapples her and
lets her have the truth of it."</p>

<p>"With a&mdash;a kiss, I suppose, Tom?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;with a whole broadside of 'em&mdash;till she was
breathless and finally struck her colours with a 'yes.' So the
banns'll be read for us at once, and all thanks to you, Mr. Felton,
sir."</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;glad!" said Sam, though with sigh like a groan.</p>

<p>"Thankee, sir, though, axing pardon, you don't hardly look it,
sir."</p>

<p>"However, I am glad, Tom, and wish you and your Nancy every
happiness."</p>

<p>"Thankee again, sir, and heartily. And talking o'
happiness&mdash;why, Lord love us&mdash;here be mine coming
now&mdash;on her two pretty feet&mdash;!" And, indeed, back came
Nancy bearing the ale, but now with no eyes or thought except for
her comely Tom, as he for her. And beholding their radiant joy, Sam
could not bear to look, so commenced banging away with his hammer
until this happy pair left him to his labours, whereupon he must
needs watch them go and bitterly envious, poor fellow.</p>

<p>But there was the good ale, so he gulped at it fiercely, and
there were the tools, so he wrought with them furiously until a
voice arrested him and glancing up, he beheld Cecily looking at him
through glitter of tears.</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, 'tis so awful! That poor lady...her dear son!
However can I tell her? Mr. Brown do say 'tis I must break the
news...this dreadful accident to her only son! And 'tis I must tell
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it must be you, Cecily. You are so sweetly gentle it will
come better from you than any other."</p>

<p>"But...her only son as she so loves...and him so clever...and
now dead...and in that same dreadful pool! How ever can I bear to
tell her?"</p>

<p>"Just because your tender sympathy can make the blow less harsh
and cruel, Cecily. Your gentle arms may be her comfort, your
gracious strength may help her to bear this new sorrow."</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton," said she, dashing away her tears to view him the
better, "you're a strange man and talk so that you make me feel
better and stronger than I really am or ever thought I could
be."</p>

<p>"Only because you are naturally good and so may be able to
comfort this poor stricken lady&mdash;if you will only try."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course I'll try, though 'twill nigh break my
heart!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Cecily, you are so very much too good for any Scrope,
especially young Ralph&mdash;do you really love him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes I do&mdash;only God knows how much...and this be my
own grief he is now to London, for to woo and wed that rich
lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, oh no! Your rogue Ralph shall never marry this
lady, never! So don't grieve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;Mr. Felton, how&mdash;how can you be so
certain-sure? Oh, please, what do ee mean? For dear God's
sake&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Just what I say, Cecily, and by your dear God I swear it! Now
go comfort that sorrowing mother like the good, beautiful angel you
are."</p>

<p>Slowly she turned and went her way, taking much of the sunlight
with her, or so Sam was thinking, when back she sped to say:</p>

<p>"Oh, my gracious, I was forgetting! Miss Andromeda met me and
gave me this note for you, here 'tis. And," she added shyly as Sam
took this precious thing, "I do hope as you...and she will be
happy, very happy...together."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" muttered Sam, hoarsely, gazing down at this very small
missive. "Thank you, Cecily&mdash;dear!" When she had gone, he
unfolded this paper and read these pencilled words:</p>

<blockquote>Oh, my dear, I cannot sleep tonight without writing you
one last word. And this word, beloved, is Hope. Without this I
think my heart would die within me. If you can wait, if only you
can be patient&mdash;some day I shall come back to you. This must
be a short note because I cannot bear to write more, yet these few
words and this small piece of paper bear to you all the best of me
with the yearning, deathless love of your<br>
<br>
ANDROMEDA.</blockquote>

<p>Seated upon his rustic bench Sam read this message over and over
again and was still thus intent when he was roused by a familiar
voice and glancing up, exclaimed, peevishly:</p>

<p>"Damme, Jasper, you're dev'lish silent and sudden!"</p>

<p>"Ax your pardon, m'lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Belay all that, the very word sickens me! What d'ye want with
me, Jasper?"</p>

<p>"Sir, this here case having con-clooded itself so fur as I'm
con-carned, seeing as how Numbers Vun and Two at this i-dentical
moment is being carted to the mort-u-ary at Lewes in a vaggon
borryed for the o-ccasion, I've dropped in for a parting vord and
puff at my steamer along o' you&mdash;if agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, old fellow. If I seemed a bit short with you I
ask pardon, but you startled me as usual, and besides this
frightful business has upset me."</p>

<p>"Ditto here, pal."</p>

<p>"Isn't Mr. Joliffe with you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he's off to ketch the night mail. For, says he, 'tell
the Earl (meaning you o' course) as how this terrimendious
happening calls me (that's him) back to London for some days at
least, but that I (him again) shall visit his lordship (that's you
again) in Wrybourne soon as possible and shall write in the
meantime.'"</p>

<p>"Oh well, sit down, Jasper, light your pipe and tell me how you
found the&mdash;the killer."</p>

<p>"I didn't, pal, 'twas him found me! Ar, and I'll tell jest how,
s'soon as I've got my puffer a-going."</p>

<p>This being accomplished, Mr. Shrig puffed, sat down and talked,
nor did Sam utter a word until the narration was ended.</p>

<p>"Dan'l and me has got his lordship's carkiss into the
afore-mentioned vaggon and are having a delayed bite at the
Wrybourne Arms and in strolls Mr. Jennings carrying his fiddle in
its case. 'Mr. Brown,' says he, wery affable, 'may I beg the favour
of a vord vith you alone?' So arter Dan'l has left us, 'Sir,' says
Mr. J., ''tis only lately as I've found our supposed friend Mr.
Brown is also a Bow Street Orficer.' 'Correct, sir,' I says, 'but
that don't alter friendship o' same, 'specially for your lady
mother.' 'I'm glad o' that,' says he, 'because I'm here to inform
you as I killed Lord Scrope because he vas my father and also to
rid the vorld, but especially my mother of a cruel, black-souled
willain.' 'Vich, sir,' says I, 'don't sap-prise me, seeing as I've
suspicioned you might kill same ever since I diskevered how he come
to be your father.' 'Oh!' says he, 'then you know some part of his
vileness. I myself discovered this fact only recently or I should
certainly have destroyed him before now.' 'Sir,' says I, 'your
motive vas werry powerful thereto, but Murder is The Capital Act
and myself being a limb o' The Law must per-form according.' 'Oh,
certainly,' he says and werry agreeably. 'You must do your duty and
I must pay the penalty, that's the reason I'm here. So pray tell
me, Mr. Brown&mdash;arter they've hanged me&mdash;must my wretched
body be jibbeted, hung in chains and&mdash;hereabouts?' 'Sir,' I
says, ''tis usually so done on or near the site o' The Deed.'
'Yes,' says he, nowise troubled, 'so I understand. But, Mr. Brown,
if you are truly my mother's friend, I beg you will arrange for my
jibbet to stand as far from Wrybourne as possible&mdash;for (and
here he gives a little cough) her sake&mdash;my mother.' 'Sir,' I
replies, 'for the sake o' that same (and here I gives a cough)
dear, gentle lady, I begs to suggest a method by vich you can pay
the aforementioned penalty vithout eether hanging nor yet
jibbeting&mdash;you might con-trive a accident vith a firearm or
tumble into a pool.' 'Oh, Mr. Brown,' says he, looking remarkable
grateful, 'you are indeed a true, kind friend'&mdash;and here for
the only time his big eyes is tearful, 'sich friend,' says he,
'that vere-ever I must go, be it heaven or hell, I shall treasure
your memory for my dear mother's sake. And now p'raps I'd better
put my admission in writing, Mr. Brown?' 'Ar, it would be best,'
says I, so I lends him my pencil, gives him a page out o' my
pocketbook, and he writes cool and calm as if to his tailor. Then,
never troubling to read it over, he gives it to me, saying: 'Mr.
Brown, I have wentured to address Mr. Felton the noo earl on my
mother's behalf. I may be wrong, but he seems a somevat hard sort
o' person, if therefore you'll be good enough to second my appeal,
a humble but desperately anxious plea, you'd add to my deep
gratitood.' 'Sir,' says I, 'all as you ax I'll do for your own sake
and your lady mother's.' Then up he gets, puts on his dicer and
takes up his fiddle, saying: 'If you don't object I'll take my
wiolin along o' me because 'twas a present from my mother. And now,
Mr. Brown, good-bye and farewell and,' says he, hesitating, 'I
should esteem it greatly and find it a comfort if you'd, for one
moment, take the hand of a ass-assin'."</p>

<p>"Jasper, I hope you did?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I did so, pal. Then he looks at his vatch and says he,
'Pray give me half-an-hour.' And off he goes...Pal, I give him a
full hour, then calling Dan'l, off I goes to that there Mill pool.
And the first thing I sees is&mdash;the fiddle-case a-floating like
a little barge, and as I'm trying to fish this ashore, Dan'l says:
'Here he is, Jarsper, here among the reeds'&mdash;and pal, there he
is&mdash;floating too&mdash;and face uppards. And so&mdash;there
y'are!"</p>

<p>"Jasper, he was a man!"</p>

<p>"Werry true, and a aristocrat besides."</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;damme!" exclaimed Sam, leaping afoot. "I shall regret
him all my life!"</p>

<p>"Howsomever," said Mr. Shrig, rising also, "seeing as how his
life has been neether a bed o' roses not yet all beer and skittles,
I hope as your lordship'll do summat in regard to his dewoted and
now grieving lady mother."</p>

<p>"Good God, man, of course! She shall have every comfort, every
care. I'll do all&mdash;Oh, hell&mdash;what can I or anyone do for
such grief as hers?"</p>

<p>"Ekker," murmured Mr. Shrig, shaking his head, "ekker alone
responds!" Then having tapped out his fragmentary clay pipe very
tenderly as usual upon his palm, he rose, saying rather
mournfully:</p>

<p>"Pal, Sam, sir, this here has been a werry onsatisfactory
case&mdash;'specially for your humble&mdash;but you still draw the
wital air instead o' being meat for vorms, and that's summat arter
all&mdash;you're all a-blowing and a-blooming vith the best o' life
afore you and happiness&mdash;I hope. So now in bidding ye
Good-bye, Sam and sir, being also your pal, I now begs leave to
offer you a bit of adwice."</p>

<p>"Well," enquired Sam, as they clasped hands, "out with it,
Jasper."</p>

<p>"Talking o' steak and kidney pudden, same being wholesome and
succulent&mdash;I suggest that there pony-cart or any other
conweyance in the hope that some day mebbe I shall make my bow to
your lovely young count-ess. And so, my lord, good-bye!"</p>

<p>For some while after Jasper Shrig had departed, Sam remained
gazing thoughtfully at Andromeda's note, until slowly his grief and
yearning gave place to indignation, and this again to a coldly
purposeful anger; inspired by which, he rose, donned his coat,
rammed on his hat and went striding furiously, to achieve this
purpose.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch137" id="ch137"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII. HOW THEY PARTED
FOR THE SECOND TIME</h3>

<p>Andromeda was busied preparing supper while Mr. Verinder seated
comfortably nearby played dreamy music to her on his
flute&mdash;when up leapt Esau with joyous clamour; thus rudely
interrupted they looked up to behold Sam scowling at them.
Andromeda gazed speechless and utterly still. Mr. Verinder, on the
contrary, flourished his silenced flute as it had been weapon of
offence, demanding truculently:</p>

<p>"What, sir, will you trouble us again? Must you plague us yet?"
Then finding himself quite disregarded, he laid down his flute and
rose, saying desperately:</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, if you come to plead your selfish love, you may
begone. If you are here to assail my ewe lamb her precious
innocence, I shall defend her with my very life."</p>

<p>"Avast, Chatterbox," growled Sam. "Belay your silly prattle.
Stow your gab. I'm not come pleading, but to make an end o' this
foolery one way or t'other. Andromeda, I've read your note. I know
it by heart. You bid me wait, you ask me to be patient&mdash;why?
Must I waste months, ay, maybe years till my lord here changes his
mind again? Not I, no damme! And will you allow this sly,
drivelling lubber to trick you into ordering our two lives now and
in the future? If so, then I'll not be a party to such curst,
sickly, sentimental nonsense."</p>

<p>"Is this an ultimatum?" she enquired, gently.</p>

<p>"Ay, call it that. However, I'll not drag out my days in empty
yearning, hoping and waiting until your sly hypocrite here
graciously permits you to become my wife. I tell you he shall not
rule my destiny or victimize me as he does you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Liar!" cried Mr. Verinder.</p>

<p>"Andromeda, I tell you this thing you call 'uncle' is a clinging
misery, a vampire sucking your very life away! So it's now or
never&mdash;will you die his worn-out slave or live as my
beloved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, abom&mdash;abominable!" panted Mr. Verinder. "Ruffian and
liar depart or I shall certainly assail you! Go, I say!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;!" snarled Sam, at his worst and grimmest, "you
cursed little pest, you shall, damned tyrant. You&mdash;" Sam
choked back the fo'c'sle epithet and ended the more lamely, "Come
on and I'll trounce ye across my knee." Instantly Mr. Verinder
rose, clenched dimpled fists and leapt&mdash;to be as instantly
collared and whirled face downwards across Sam's brawny thigh and
so viciously that Andromeda interposed.</p>

<p>"Ah," she cried, grasping Sam's upraised, vengeful hand in both
her own, "you would never strike him&mdash;" And scowling down on
his writhing victim, Sam answered, fiercely:</p>

<p>"Loose me and see!"</p>

<p>"No!" she answered as fiercely, "you shall not."</p>

<p>"Watch now!" Despite all her efforts, Sam freed his hand, raised
it.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she pleaded. "For my sake! I beg you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, Sam's big hand fell with resounding
slap&mdash;then his hat went flying and stung by this blow, he
loosed his struggling prisoner and turned to see Andromeda poised
to strike again.</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Mr. Verinder. "Stop now and listen to me." Seating
himself cross-legged upon the grass like a plump though indignant
imp, he reproached them like the odd, serenely dignified, little
gentleman he was:</p>

<p>"Mr. Felton, behold how you can debase a gracious gentlewoman to
the odious level of a screeching fishwife&mdash;your detested face
bears the stigmata of her fingers and I am glad. Ah, but&mdash;my
niece comported herself like vulgar harridan and this shames and
grieves me! And you, Andromeda, now see what coarse, horrid brute
is this Felton, a common, loutish sailor who, as your husband,
would drag you down to his own sordid depths and might even beat
and outrage your tender loveliness with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Sam, "I probably should if she deserved it, as she
does now for being so easily bamboozled by the like o' you. Ay, she
ought to be slapped. However, I'll go instead, like the dam' fool I
am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a monster!" added Mr. Verinder. "A coarse tar, a savage and
barbarian!"</p>

<p>"As you will, sir," quoth Sam, mournfully, stooping to pick up
his hat and putting it on dejectedly, "yes, I am coarse, I suppose,
according to your lights, and maybe a bit brutal...I shouldn't have
slapped your poor, little tyrant, Andromeda. But I'm just a
roughish sailorman, as I told ye, with no manners, no airs or
graces and never a spot o' polish. No proper spouse for a fine
lady&mdash;though she don't wear silk stockings, poor soul, and
clumps about in heavy boots, working her pretty hands rough and
horny for a selfish do-nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not heed him, Meda love! Do not listen!"</p>

<p>"But she must, sir. She's going to hear me say that had she
followed Love and wed this brutal sailor she might ha' gentled him
and maybe learned him the trick o' prettier manners. As it is, he
remains his brutish self, but will love her truly as any fine
gentleman. So now, here's my final good-bye, Andromeda, unless you
bid me otherwise."</p>

<p>But as she neither moved nor spoke, Sam turned, sighed and
trudged away. But he had not gone far when his heart leapt to the
flutter of her petticoats and he saw her speeding after him.</p>

<p>"Andromeda&mdash;?" he questioned, striding towards her, but she
stayed him with a gesture saying, rather breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Did I hurt that...dear, scowling face?"</p>

<p>"It would be all the better for a touch of that lovely mouth,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"No, stay where you are or I shall fly." Sam frowned but obeyed.
"Once," she continued, "when you were less fierce&mdash;indeed
almost gentle, you wished for one of my worn-out shoes&mdash;here
is one!" And she tossed it towards him, adding: "And nearly always
I do wear silk stockings, as some day...perhaps...I will show
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Andromeda," he pleaded, "will you marry me and damn your
tyrant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!" she cried and fled from him, swift and graceful as a
dryad.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;never it is!" he shouted after her; then spying
her shoe within reach, kicked the poor little thing into a bramble
bush&mdash;and scratched his passionate hands getting it out again;
which done he cursed it, kissed it, crammed it into his pocket and
strode away like the furious, disappointed sailorman he was.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch138" id="ch138"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII. IN WHICH SAM IS
MY LORD PROCLAIMED</h3>

<p>"A week!" said Aunt Deb, plying busy needle as she sat upon the
rustic seat while a gloomy Sam laboured at his half-completed
table, "a whole week since this truly terribly tragic affair! The
entire County agog and all astir, Sam&mdash;and still no sign or
word of our new lord. One would have thought that as head of The
Family he would certainly have attended the funeral&mdash;and such
a funeral! But, oh dear no&mdash;there was no least sign of him!
Now mark me, my dear, in his persistent and so absolute absence, I
sense a strangeness, Sam, a mystery of moment!"</p>

<p>"What did you think of the funeral, Aunt Deb?"</p>

<p>"Intensely impressive, my dear! Such crowds&mdash;horsed and
afoot! So many carriages of The Quality&mdash;and all so truly
decorous."</p>

<p>"Ah!" snorted Sam. "And all to see the last of a Scrope, which
of course means a scoundrel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Sam! My dear&mdash;forbear! One should not speak ill of
the dead."</p>

<p>"Why not, Aunt? For, d'ye see, it's the way folk talk of us when
we're gone, the memory we leave is our true epitaph, the monument
to be honoured or spit upon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very true!" quoth Mrs. Leet, thudding across the grass towards
them with her ponderous stick. "Though I wouldn't waste my good
spittle on such Scrope as Lord Julian. As for Eustace Jennings,
poor boy, I'm glad they buried him away from Wrybourne."</p>

<p>"I suppose you knew him well, Grannyanne?"</p>

<p>"All his life or nearly, Sam," answered Mrs. Leet, seating
herself beside Aunt Deborah and loosing the strings of her vast
bonnet.</p>

<p>"His was a sad life, eh, Granny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, poor boy. And no wonder!"</p>

<p>"You mean because Lord Julian was his father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;never!" exclaimed Aunt Deb, busy needle suddenly
arrested. "Sam, whatever are you saying?"</p>

<p>"Truth, Deborah!" nodded Mrs. Leet. "I learned this years ago on
a night when Lord Julian and the Earl quarrelled; they were drunk,
of course, at least the Earl was, and taxed Julian with it&mdash;a
vile, wicked tale of how he had deceived Ruth Jennings, poor
lady&mdash;actually rigged one of his friends as a clergyman! This
the Earl was shouting as I went in to 'em crying them hush for
decency's sake. And so they did but took their swords to each
other&mdash;then I, like a fool, snatched a tablecloth and caught
their blades&mdash;ha, better I'd let 'em kill each other! But I
was young then."</p>

<p>"Yet, Granny, how came Eustace to live with such a man?"</p>

<p>"Because he never knew the shameful secret of his birth. When
his poor mother discovered Julian's vileness she fled, but he never
rested till he found her, for he loved her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Anne, he couldn't have."</p>

<p>"But he did&mdash;as much as such man could. That's why he stole
her baby away&mdash;to keep her near him. He used the boy kindly,
had him well educated as the son of a friend and thus won the boy's
gratitude&mdash;a shy, too-sensitive boy as I mind him&mdash;won
him body and soul, then used him to compel his helpless mother! Ha,
the monster should ha' been slaughtered long ago! Pah&mdash;let's
talk o' something cleaner."</p>

<p>"Yes, Anne, though&mdash;my Gracious, what a wicked family! 'Tis
dreadful to think there's yet another Scrope somewhere about who
may be just as bad."</p>

<p>"And if not, Deb, if this new Scrope should be of the better
sort, think of all the evil for him to undo, all the wrongs to be
righted&mdash;and my dratted cottage roof yet to mend!"</p>

<p>"We must hope that he will be good, Anne, though he is not
beginning at all well."</p>

<p>"Oh, why not, Deborah?"</p>

<p>"He ought to have been at the funeral, his absence was marked,
folk are scandalized and talking."</p>

<p>"Well, our Scropes are, or were, a scandal&mdash;so let folk
talk. Our new Lord Japhet will have the more to live down, that's
all."</p>

<p>"If he ever can, Anne!"</p>

<p>"I think he will, Deb."</p>

<p>"Then he will have to be a brave, strong-souled young man,
Anne."</p>

<p>"I believe he is, Deborah."</p>

<p>"Oh, why should you?"</p>

<p>"Because, as I said before, it's about time a good Scrope
happened."</p>

<p>"Well, Anne, seeing is believing."</p>

<p>"How say you, Grandson Sam?"</p>

<p>"I'm hoping your kind faith will be justified, Grannyanne. But
where's my little sweetheart, what's become of our Jane?"</p>

<p>"Away to Deepways Farm with Cecily Croft. A right grand girl
that! Yes, without her I do believe poor Mrs. Jennings would ha'
died, for she was beyond my power to comfort."</p>

<p>"So you were with her, Granny, I'm mighty glad o' that."</p>

<p>"Sam, of course I was. But as I say, 'twas Cecily she clung to
in her desolation, Cecily it was who soothed her! I never saw such
grief and hope I never shall again! Yes, a fine, a splendid girl is
Cecily."</p>

<p>"True, Anne, though far, far too dangerously, bewitchingly
beautiful! And a fool of course to waste herself on that Ralph
Scrope! Which reminds me&mdash;I didn't see him at the funeral
either&mdash;and his own father's funeral too! Terribly odd,
hatefully unfilial, dreadfully disrespectful and surpassingly
strange, eh, Anne?"</p>

<p>"Of course, but then he's a Scrope. So no more o' him! Instead
tell me when must we expect Ned and his Kate?"</p>

<p>"About six o'clock."</p>

<p>"And what have we for dinner, or is it supper?"</p>

<p>"Both or either, Anne. And we have fried soles, boiled beef, a
green goose, peas, beans, a gooseberry pie and currant tart."</p>

<p>"Then, m'dear, I hope they won't be late for I'm hungry
already."</p>

<p>"Grannyanne, how often do you visit Mrs. Jennings?"</p>

<p>"Every day, Sam."</p>

<p>"Then I should like to go with you tomorrow if I may?"</p>

<p>"Of course. She speaks very kindly of you&mdash;how you carried
her. Yes, and she seems to have taken a great fancy to that queer
person Mr. Brown, she was asking after him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Aunt Deb, laying by her sewing. "Surely I hear
wheels in the lane&mdash;" As she spoke came a seamanlike roar
mellowed by distance:</p>

<p>"House ho! Ahoy, Sam! Messmate&mdash;ahoy!"</p>

<p>And instantly, his gloom forgotten a while, Sam bellowed in
cheery response. Then with Grannyanne on one arm and Aunt Deb on
the other away they hastened to welcome Captain Ned and his lady.
And a right joyous reunion it was; the old farmhouse rang again
with laughter and happy voices which, after some while, were
somewhat muted by reason of the boiled beef, goose, etc.</p>

<p>And afterwards, seated about the wide hearth, with its cosy
ingles, where winter and summer a fire blazed or smouldered, they
talked or were comfortably silent like the real friends they
were.</p>

<p>And it was upon this scene of happy peaceful domesticity that
Nancy opened the door to announce:</p>

<p>"Mr. Joliffe, if you please."</p>

<p>Forthwith in he came bowing and smiling as they rose to greet
him.</p>

<p>"God bless you all, how snug you look! I am the more ashamed to
disturb you, but by your leaves, I must crave a few words with his
lordship here."</p>

<p>"Eh, sir?" questioned the Captain. "His lordship did you
say?"</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure I did," said Mr. Joliffe. "How then," he
chuckled, seeing Captain Ned's blank look, "are you not
aware&mdash;Sam, haven't you told them&mdash;aha&mdash;evidently
not! Then, my dear friends, in this scowling Sam of ours, I have
the honour to present my lord Japhet, Earl of Wrybourne..."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch139" id="ch139"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX. TELLS HOW SAM
MADE A DECISION</h3>

<p>These words, so merrily spoken, smote Sam like an icy blast, a
blighting wind that swept the spirit of warm, sweet intimacy from
this homely fireside where now these faces so dearly familiar
became all suddenly cold and strange; Kate, wide-eyed, shrank from
him nearer her husband, who regarded him beneath brows knit in
perplexity or anger. Aunt Deborah stared open-mouthed, only Mrs.
Leet, watching all, knitted serenely in a breathless silence, an
unnatural stillness growing ever more unbearable, a hush broken
only by the click of her knitting-pins, even this homely sound
ended at last&mdash;and then she enquired:</p>

<p>"Well, why are we all so speechless?"</p>

<p>"Because," Sam answered, bitterly, "I'm cursed with the name of
Scrope! Ay, and the curse is come on me already, shutting me away
from you all, shattering this that was my home, making me an
outcast&mdash;" With the word he started afoot and strode out and
away to the orchard where shadows were deepening.</p>

<p>And here presently Grannyanne found him crouched disconsolate on
the rustic settle.</p>

<p>"Sam," she murmured, touching his bowed head, "dear boy, make
room for your granny."</p>

<p>"Oh, Grannyanne," he sighed, setting his arms about her, "thank
God you're here and&mdash;didn't use my accursed title."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said she, seated herself beside him, "but Sam, my
dear, 'tis for you to make this title honourable again, respected
and I hope&mdash;loved...But, my word, a fine to-do you've made
yonder, there's Kate weeping, Ned swearing, under his breath,
Joliffe trying to explain and apologize for springing such
surprise, and Deb still goggling in amaze, and here's me come for
my grandson's arm."</p>

<p>"Which is always at your service, God bless you! But you're not
bearing up for your cottage yet because, d'ye see, I need the
comfort of you&mdash;so you won't leave me yet awhile?"</p>

<p>"No, my hearty, oh no," she replied, as her sailor father might
have done, "we'll beat to quarters and square away for the
parlour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Granny, I can't face 'em so soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, but you must, if only to put 'em all at their ease, for if
you're taken all aback, Sam, they're on their beam-ends! So it's
tack about and bear away, my hearty. And for goodness' sake don't
look such a hang-dog, guilty wretch, for though you are a Scrope
'tis no fault of yours."</p>

<p>"Grannyanne, when were you sure I was of this cursed
family?"</p>

<p>"The night we looked at the stars, Sam, though I suspected it
when you stood beneath the Admiral's portrait. Come now, my Admiral
Two, tack about and smartly."</p>

<p>"God love you, Granny, what a joy and comfort you are!" So back
they went...to be met and welcomed by Kate's glad cry:</p>

<p>"Oh Sam, dear, dear Sam&mdash;oh, my lord, I'm trying to thank
you as I said I would, though even now I hardly dare and don't know
how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why then," said he, rather hoarsely, "kiss me instead and make
our Captain jealous!" And kiss him she did, right heartily, and
after her Aunt Deb; then Captain Ned grasped his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Sink me, old messmate, this calls for a bottle!"</p>

<p>Thus that invisible, so English barrier of Caste melted away,
the awesome spectre named Rank fled before the genial Spirit of
Home, and my lord Japhet, Earl of Wrybourne became also Sam and one
of this joyous family circle. Though Aunt Deb murmured at fitful
intervals:</p>

<p>"Amazing! Astounding! Our Sam! My Saint George!
Astonishing!"</p>

<p>So once again they drank the toast: "Health, happiness and long
life to Japhet the Earl."</p>

<p>"Well now," said Sam, rather awkwardly, fumbling his wine glass,
"I'm going to pledge you all...God love and keep you all and may
you be the...the same dear folk when I come back, for, d'ye see,
I'm off to fight the mounseers again, but this time&mdash;in my own
ship."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;no!" gasped Kate.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;don't!" cried Aunt Deb.</p>

<p>"Pre-posterous!" exclaimed Mr. Joliffe. "Sam...my lord, you must
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Folks," said Mrs. Leet, rising majestically, "I dare to think
he won't. And now I'll get me beneath my dratted leaky roof.
Grandson, your arm!" And so, when she had been tied into her bonnet
and armed with her formidable staff, forth she went with Sam into a
fragrant night.</p>

<p>"But, Granny," said he, opening the gate, "surely it's every
man's duty to defend his home 'gainst invasion?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Sam. But thank God, there are thousands of brave men
to do that, but only one man to do what you must. So your duty is
to fit yourself for your new responsibilities and they are great.
'Tis London for you, Sam, to take your place as peer o' the realm
and help to govern our troubled old England. Any man that is a man
can fight with his hands&mdash;you must fight an everlasting battle
with your mind, your wits, the influence of your character and the
enormous power of your wealth."</p>

<p>"But, Grannyanne, I'm a sailor with little education, and
besides a hard life has made me such a rough, mannerless sort o'
fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the good Lord made your body strong, your heart clean and
true and fearless. Fortune has made you an Earl, 'tis for you to
make yourself a gentleman. Ha, Sam, you are going to be right busy
here in England with fights a-plenty, battles with yourself and
circumstance without seeking 'em at sea! Then besides, and
lastly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Granny?"</p>

<p>"There's Jane's Fairy Aunt."</p>

<p>"Yes," he sighed, "there will always be Andromeda. Do you know
her, Granny?"</p>

<p>"No, not properly, but I mean to, if you love her, do you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, beyond the telling!"</p>

<p>"However, did you tell her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered again and with another sigh.</p>

<p>"Ha! And she denied you?"</p>

<p>"Well, she has and she hasn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Under the hedge, Sam&mdash;here in the moonlight, sit down and
tell me all about it."</p>

<p>There seated beside her, Sam told of his love briefly yet with
such deep sincerity and unconscious eloquence that when he had
finished, Grannyanne instantly rapped him with her ponderous stick
though not very hard, saying:</p>

<p>"Sam, y'great silly numps, you lubberly jack, you handled the
affair quite wrongly!"</p>

<p>"Oh, did I, Granny? Pray how?"</p>

<p>"You slapped the little gentleman abaft, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I did and now regret it."</p>

<p>"And so you should, you great gowk, for making such fool
mistake."</p>

<p>"Eh? Mistake, but&mdash;how d'you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean you slapped the wrong one. You should have ignored the
uncle and slapped the niece! Such delicate, fine lady would take it
kindly&mdash;done properly and by the right man, of course.
However, this can always be amended next time you meet her...Ha,
and yonder comes Ben Joliffe seeking you. Here we are, Ben, under
the hedge!"</p>

<p>"Well," enquired Mr. Joliffe, anxiously, "have you talked our
hot-head into reason, Anne? Have you convinced him of his
duty?"</p>

<p>"I think so, I hope so&mdash;ask him!"</p>

<p>"Then, Sam, will you waste yourself at sea&mdash;or to London
and follow your high destiny?"</p>

<p>"You must give me time to decide," answered Sam, aiding
Grannyanne to her feet.</p>

<p>"Of course," sighed Mr. Joliffe wearily, "but how long will that
take you?"</p>

<p>"Until we reach Granny's cottage," answered Sam, whereat she
gave his arm a squeeze, saying as she did so:</p>

<p>"And must I remind your lordship that the cottage your lordship
permits me to inhabit at a price, has a leaky roof&mdash;drat
it!"</p>

<p>"Ay, but then, Mrs. Leet, d'ye see, marm, I'm hoping you will
take command again at my lordship's house called Wrybourne
Feveril."</p>

<p>"Sam&mdash;you never mean it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, but I do."</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm too old for such responsibility."</p>

<p>"Then I'm too young ever to live in such a confounded old
rabbit-warren without you, Granny."</p>

<p>"And here," said Mr. Joliffe, "here we are at the cottage. So
which and what is it to be, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Why, London, of course, Ben. Who can resist Grannyanne? Not I!
She's but to fire a shot athwart my forefoot and I strike my
colours. God bless her! So kiss me Good-bye, Grannyanne, and wish
your loving grandson good luck, b'Jingo he'll need it!"</p>

<p>So kiss him she did and left a tear on his cheek, saying
thereafter:</p>

<p>"Oh, drat you, Sam, you've made me cry! But with these tears I'm
praying our Almighty Father will give you strength to be a true
noble-man, the best and greatest of all the Scropes to bring love
and honour to the name at last. Good-bye, Grandson, and God bless
you!"</p>

<p>"And there," said Sam, when the cottage door had shut her from
sight, "there is a truly grand soul, Ben!"</p>

<p>"I have known it these many years, Sam! Anne Leet was always
profoundly wise and utterly fearless. She only could manage or
dared outface your&mdash;hem&mdash;lordly sire in his drunken
furies. While she ruled the Great House there was at least some
show of decency."</p>

<p>"Ay, truly 'tis privilege to know such as she!" So saying, Sam
turned and slipping hand within Mr. Joliffe's arm enquired, rather
gloomily:</p>

<p>"When d'you propose we start for London, Ben?"</p>

<p>"At your convenience, m'dear fellow, but&mdash;the sooner the
better."</p>

<p>"Then," quoth Sam, sighing deeper than ever, "let it be
tomorrow."</p>

<p>TO THE READER:</p>

<p>who having followed Sam thus far, the Author dares to regard as
his friend.</p>

<p>Here this narrative might conclude, since here end the bodily
dangers of this Heritage Perilous. Yet because in this life are
perils more insidious though no less deadly, your Author, and
friend (I hope) ventures to describe briefly as possible those
dangers that still awaited Sam amid the teeming riot of London's
then cobbled streets and in the perfumed bowers of great Vanity
Fair that has been, is, and ever will be the lure to buoyant,
exuberant youth for eventual good or ill.</p>

<h2>BOOK NUMBER TWO&mdash;THE ARISTOCRAT.</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch201" id="ch201"></a>CHAPTER I. OF SIR JOHN ORME AND
VANITY FAIR</h3>

<p>The clock of St. Clement Danes was striking the hour of three as
Mr. Joliffe turning from the roar and clatter of the busy Strand,
led Sam beneath a shadowy arch into the comparative quiet of
Clifford's Inn where, beyond cobbled walks, grass grew and trees
made pleasant shade for buildings which, though grimed and dingy,
were yet gracious and dignified by age and long tradition.</p>

<p>Entering a certain gloomy portal they ascended a gloomier stair,
up and up until they arrived at the dingiest of doors which opening
promptly to Mr. Joliffe's knock, disclosed a sombre person who,
bowing speechlessly, conducted them to a bare little room with no
carpet, one picture, two small, hard chairs, and a shock-headed man
in faded dressing-gown and slippers performing on a squeaking quill
pen.</p>

<p>"M'lord," said Mr. Joliffe ceremoniously, "I have the honour to
present Sir John Orme, Sir John, the Earl of Wrybourne."</p>

<p>"Servant!" snapped Sir John, his pen still squeaking. "You are a
little before your time, Joliffe. Pray sit down until I have slaved
my allotted span. Be seated."</p>

<p>"Thankee," answered Sam, a little grimly, "I'd liefer
stand."</p>

<p>"And rightly so," said Sir John, still writing busily, "those
four-legged discomforts are meant to discourage idle sitters and
fatuous chatterers, for this, sir, is my room of penance. Five
minutes longer and I shall give you my attention."</p>

<p>So while Mr. Joliffe perched uncomfortably on inadequate chair,
Sam glanced from this harsh-spoken, shabby man, round about this
ostentatiously barren little room until arrested by the one
picture, the portrait of a young, delicately-beautiful woman; he
was yet regarding this when Sir John's harsh voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My wife, sir! She died twelve years ago. I killed her. She came
to me like sweet flower of Spring, and I killed her. She was for me
the one dearest thing in life and I murdered her as surely as if
these hands had strangled her."</p>

<p>"Though," Mr. Joliffe interpolated, "she was always extremely
delicate."</p>

<p>"My lord," continued Sir John, more harshly, "I was one of those
human curses known euphemistically as a dashing sportsman, a
gambler on the heroic scale and comported myself so heroically that
in one night of heroic folly I lost all&mdash;yes even the bed she
lay upon! Three months later, in room small and wretchedly bare as
this, she died in the arms of the remorseful wretch who had killed
her. Then, having lost all that made life endurable, I should have
tossed that away also, but for my good friend Joliffe...later he
found me work as a law-writer, thus I eke out an existence and
better than I deserve thanks to my man Jeremiah. So I have made
life a penance, part of which is thus to trample pride underfoot
and make confession so painful to you, sir, a man so much younger
than myself. Well, my lord, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>Now looking down at the speaker, Sam beheld a face framed in
shag of long, grey hair, pale, high-nosed, square of chin and lit
by eyes so much the reverse of his abrupt, harsh manner that,
finding no words, Sam held out his hand instead, to have it grasped
with such unexpected heartiness that he said, impulsively:</p>

<p>"Sir, I hope we are going to be friends."</p>

<p>"Joliffe," said Sir John, rising, "he'll do! Now leave we this
room of penance for one where we may talk in more comfort. This
law-writing is weary business, I've been quill-driving since dawn.
Come away!" And presently seated in cosy chamber: "My lord," said
he, "our friend Joliffe has of course informed me of you and your
change of fortune and I am curious to know what you intend to do
with yourself and how I can help you?"</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Sam, "a few weeks ago I was a seaman and a rough
sort of fellow, today greatly against my will, I'm an earl and
what's worse, a Scrope! I belong to a family of blue-blooded
scoundrels who have been a curse to themselves and
others&mdash;back through the ages. And now it seems I must assume
my lordly position and responsibilities and my trouble is how to do
it worthily being only myself and cursed beforehand with such
villainous name?"</p>

<p>Sir John, sitting up in his chair, was now regarding Sam with
new and keenest interest; Mr. Joliffe watching both, was hiding a
smile in his hand as Sam continued:</p>

<p>"What's more, sir, besides my accursed name, you must know I'm
no fine gentleman, I've no graces o' manner and little education.
Yet I've a mind to lift this damned name of Scrope out o' the mud
and do something to better the condition of my tenantry and the
country at large, use the power o' my money&mdash;Joliffe says I've
lots of it&mdash;for good 'stead of evil and&mdash;well, d'ye
see&mdash;be an Earl to the best o' my ability."</p>

<p>"So," repeated Sir John, leaning forward to say it, "you would
be an earl&mdash;to the best of your ability&mdash;and how,
pray?"</p>

<p>"By service, sir. Giving as well as taking. By mixing with my
folk, giving 'em a lead in their work and pastime. For, d'ye see, I
know and ha' proved this aboard ship&mdash;that I can get the best
out of a fighting crew by leadership rather than command. 'Boarders
away&mdash;go to it, lads'! is one way&mdash;'Follow me, my
hearties'! is another and better. I know, for as I say, I've proved
it. But, sir, to be a proper Earl, it seems I must bear up for the
Fashionable World, learn the manoeuvres of Polite Society, eh,
Joliffe?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, my lord!"</p>

<p>"So, d'ye see, Sir John, my need is for someone to pilot me
among these shoals, learn me the ropes and how to box the social
compass, to learn me gentlemanly ways with the how and what of it
all. Well, Sir John, our friend Joliffe speaks of you so highly
that here am I to beg you'll so oblige me&mdash;if you will I shall
be very truly grateful. So, what's the word, sir?"</p>

<p>"My first word," answered Sir John, sinking back in his chair
again, "is astonishment! And my second&mdash;gratitude! Yes,
Joliffe old friend, I am profoundly grateful for chance of such
joyous adventure, which I accept gladly! For, 'pon my soul, Ben,
our young lord is like a fresh, clean breeze and one that may
become a gale to scatter age-old cobwebs, even shake Vanity Fair
and of course eventually prove his own social ruin."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Sam, pondering this. "Ah! Pray how, sir?"</p>

<p>"By contravening those unwritten laws, breaking every rule
whereby Vanity Fair troubles to govern itself."</p>

<p>"And what," enquired Sam, "what is Vanity Fair?"</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed Sir John, with something very like a chuckle.
"There spake our innocent man of the sea! Vanity Fair, my lord, is
a&mdash;sentient nebulosity that judges all and every thing by
externals, believes only what best pleases itself, refuses to see
or hear anything disagreeable to itself, troubles itself only for
itself, exists but to pleasure itself, and may be summed up
therefore in the one word&mdash;Itself. By such criterion you must
see how entirely wrong are your values. In Vanity Fair the name of
Scrope stands high, your family being old and of long tradition is
therefore honoured. Your Uncle, the late Lord Julian, will be
politely lamented as a mordant wit and famous sportsman.
Consequently you as a Scrope of Wrybourne will be hailed and made
free of Vanity Fair not for yourself or because of your prodigious
wealth, but for your blue blood and long ancestry, in fine because
you are an aristocrat."</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Sam, with hopeless gesture, "Lord love me! Now
I'm greatly minded to turn farmer along o' Ned or fit out a ship
against the mounseers."</p>

<p>"And in either," sighed Sir John, "you would find more true
happiness and content."</p>

<p>"But," said Mr. Joliffe warningly, "your duty points another
way!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" groaned Sam. "But now I'm fairly out o' my
reckoning."</p>

<p>"And no wonder!" chuckled Mr. Joliffe. "This is why we sought
aid of Sir John."</p>

<p>"Which I am happy to afford."</p>

<p>"Then, sir," quoth Sam, "since we are to be associated, will you
favour me by dropping my title, cutting it adrift and calling me
Sam?"</p>

<p>"Gladly, on condition that you reciprocate."</p>

<p>"Thankee. Then how do we begin, John, and how?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," suggested Mr. Joliffe, "the first and most urgent
need is&mdash;a tailor?"</p>

<p>"No, Ben, not a tailor&mdash;the tailor, my own! I believe he
still condescends to fashion creations and create fashions for the
favoured few. We will call on him today, so soon as I am
ready."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Mr. Joliffe. "For in the hope you might
prove agreeable, my dear Sir John, all is prepared for your
reception at my lord's town house."</p>

<p>"Though," added Sam, dismally, "'tis more like an
hotel&mdash;with a crew o' servants, butlers, footmen and what
not&mdash;enough to man a ship o' the line, besides a host o'
women."</p>

<p>"And one other," said Sir John, smiling, "my man Jeremiah, who
is a host in himself. Which reminds me!" And rising, he pulled the
bell-rope, whereupon the door opened and the sedate Jeremiah
entered, bearing a tray laden hospitably with bottles and glasses.
Towards these Sir John gestured, saying:</p>

<p>"Give me half-an-hour."</p>

<p>"Well, Sam," quoth Mr. Joliffe, as the door closed, "yonder goes
your guide, philosopher and, I hope, friend, than whom I could have
chosen none more able as events shall prove. For Sir John was once
a famous and brilliant denizen of Vanity Fair&mdash;today a man of
even greater parts...made wise by bitter experience. I hope you
approve my choice?"</p>

<p>"Why, so far as I can tell at present, Ben, I echo his words and
heartily&mdash;'he'll do.' No wine, thankee! And I've been
thinking, Ben."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed?" enquired Mr. Joliffe, filling his own glass.</p>

<p>"Yes, a matter of business&mdash;Joliffe!"</p>

<p>"Ah, what now, my lord?" he enquired, apprehensively. "No more
stupendous bequests, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Yes and no. I'm wondering what I can do to make life a little
easier, if possible, for that very unfortunate and gentle lady,
Mrs. Jennings."</p>

<p>Mr. Joliffe sighed heavily, set down his wine untested:</p>

<p>"Money, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" Mr. Joliffe moaned faintly as Sam continued: "The
question is&mdash;how much and how best I can get her to accept it
without hurting her pride, d'ye see? I've been trying to scheme how
we might let it appear to be a legacy from Lord Julian's
estate...and yet, considering he's proclaimed bankrupt and his son
at present in a debtor's prison&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whence he can never win free!" added Mr. Joliffe, sipping his
wine with relish. "A prisoner for life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely, Joliffe...I thought about five hundred a year and
the cottage she occupies or any other she may choose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, my lord, my dear fellow, Oh, Sam, consider&mdash;Mrs.
Jennings has but her own simple needs&mdash;she is alone, and for a
single woman five hundred per annum is quite exorbitant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Joliffe, considering her loneliness, let's make it
six hundred and a house or cottage. Is this understood?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes!" gasped the lawyer. "But, my lord, permit me to
remark&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you think we should do better, another hundred or
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! Great good Jehovah&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear Ben. Now as to the method, the how and when
of it. I think the only person who can help us is your old friend
and that wise Grannyanne o' mine. So, tomorrow, Joliffe, you will
proceed to Wrybourne and consult with her."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, my lord? But, my dear fellow, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, Mr. Joliffe, sir! For, d'ye see, I want the matter
completed at once. Then besides, regarding Mistress Cecily
Croft&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes!" moaned the lawyer. "Very soon this innocent young
creature will be harassed by this fabulous wealth which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And, Mr. Joliffe, I must impress upon you again how she must
have no idea&mdash;not the least suspicion as to the who or why of
it! Is this also understood?"</p>

<p>"It is, my lord, I do assure you."</p>

<p>"Then, Ben, my dear old fellow&mdash;" At this moment the door
opened and glancing thither, Sam was dumb, for upon the threshold
stood a tall, stately person, such truly imposing figure that Sam
rose instinctively to his feet.</p>

<p>Sir John's wild shag of grey hair had been combed back into a
queue, his patched and faded dressing-gown had given place to
garments whose sombre elegance lent him an added dignity while his
lean face lit by wide, bright eyes, showed power in its every
feature and line&mdash;gentled all at once by a smile that seemed
oddly wistful as he said, and in voice altered as was his
appearance:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I am at your service."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir John," said Mr. Joliffe, rising in his turn, "my dear
Sir John, I am happy to welcome you back to life...the world of
action&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And," sighed Sir John, "the tragical follies of Vanity
Fair."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch202" id="ch202"></a>CHAPTER II. TELLS HOW MY LORD
CAME TO VANITY FAIR</h3>

<p>A month has elapsed and my lord the Earl of Wrybourne stands
scowling at the resplendent young gentleman who scowls back at
him&mdash;a tall, shapely, young exquisite whose garments seem
moulded upon his powerful body, more especially his skin-tight
pantaloons, that reveal his nether man from hip to ankle with an
almost disquieting frankness.</p>

<p>It is at these brawny, too-evident limbs of his that my lord is
gazing with such very Sam-like scowl while his two valets hover
anxiously in the background, when the door opens to admit Sir John,
whereupon my lord turns from his reflection in the long,
cheval-glass, saying gloomily:</p>

<p>"John, I'm well enough aloft, but alow&mdash;damme, I feel and
look like a skinned rabbit!" At this, my lord's two valets exchange
glances and even venture to appear horrified, while Sir John,
lifting gold-rimmed quizzing-glass adangle on broad ribbon,
inspects my lord from curly pate to gleaming pumps, walks slowly
round about my lord, inspecting him from every angle and finally
remarks:</p>

<p>"I find nothing about you to disparage&mdash;indeed you are
quite point-devise! And knee-breeches, my dear Japhet, are becoming
d&eacute;mod&eacute;, and this new, hideous fashion of cossack
trowsers is not permissible for such occasion as this! Also at such
function to be a trifle late is modish, to be devilish late is
deuced bad form and&mdash;we are a trifle late!"</p>

<p>Thus presently side by side these two fine gentlemen descend
wide, curving stair to spacious, pillared hall, where four ornate
footmen moving as one, open ponderous door, bow them down marble
steps and into luxurious carriage that bears them away through, but
not of, these busy London streets.</p>

<p>And now as they bowl along, my lord still very conscious of
those legs of his, says unhappily:</p>

<p>"Damme, I'm shaking fore and aft! I'm nervous, John!"</p>

<p>"Well, thank heaven you don't show it! And after all you've only
to look the part, which you do&mdash;say little, bow often and
remember our many lessons in speech and deportment."</p>

<p>"Ay, you've been very patient with me, John, all these weeks,
and taught me a great deal."</p>

<p>"You are an apt pupil, my dear Japhet, and quick to learn,
though to be sure Nature made you a gentleman. I have but added a
little polish I venture to believe."</p>

<p>"And I'm grateful, John, and only hope I may do justice to your
instruction. Though, 'pon my soul, I'd rather be fighting a close
action in gale o' wind than front all these fine folk. Have you any
last orders?"</p>

<p>"Merely to reiterate&mdash;first&mdash;do not stride with your
seaman's roll and lurch. Second&mdash;bear yourself always like the
aristocrat you are. Third&mdash;when you converse modulate your
voice and use few gestures. Fourth&mdash;if you are angered or
troubled, smile. Pray remember that you must, under all
circumstances, preserve an immutable calm, an unshakable, nay a
pertinacious serenity! Rein in and govern your emotions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, but suppose some fellow affronts me?"</p>

<p>"Be gracious and return his insult with a bow. And this reminds
me, being a fighting seaman you are used to firearms?"</p>

<p>"Of course, John, though I'm happier with a boarding-axe or
cutlass..."</p>

<p>Talking thus, they arrive in due season at another great house,
vast of gates, portico and courtyard where other stately carriages
trundle in, deposit their precious cargoes and rumble away, making
room for others. For here today Her Grace the Duchess of
Camberhurst is to introduce my lord the Earl of Wrybourne to the
World of Fashion, which is eager to take him to its polite bosom
since he is "One of the Wicked Scropes, my dear"! also, "One of the
wealthiest young bachelors in England, my love"!</p>

<p>Wherefore, as these many carriages rumble and roll, beplumed and
turbaned mamas give final keen scrutiny to their daughters, with
such instructions as: "Remember to bear yourself swimmingly, child!
When you make your reverence, miss, your curtsy must be graciously
slow with becoming droop of lashes and&mdash;forget not to surge
your bosom a little pantingly, my dear, and do&mdash;not point your
elbows!"</p>

<p>Up carpeted steps, between rows of powdered flunkeys, sweep
stately dames, gallant gentlemen and visions of youthful
loveliness; dainty petticoats flutter, plumes nod, jewels sparkle,
bright eyes beam&mdash;and all to meet to greet and give welcome to
this Child of Fortune, this blue-blooded aristocrat my lord the
Earl of Wrybourne-Feveril...But he, completely overwhelmed and
giving way to sudden panic, eludes Sir John amid this crowded
magnificence, steals away like hunted wretch, finds a door that
opens upon the free air and is off and away. He is speeding along a
path between tall yew hedges when he collides with one who, reeling
from the impact, splutters a strangled curse, a tall gentleman
this, chiefly remarkable for teeth that are large and cruel-looking
and eyes that are small but exceedingly fierce.</p>

<p>"Curse you, sir!" gasps this gentleman, large teeth bared and
small eyes narrowed. "What the devil, sir&mdash;hey,
sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn your eyes!" retorts my lord, harshly as any sailorman
possibly could. "If y'must run me aboard, speak me more mannerly or
be dumb, blast ye!"</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;eh?" cries the gentleman, opening his eyes wide as
possible. "Who the&mdash;what the devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Avast!" snarls my lord, becoming Sam at his grimmest, "I'm in
no mood to parlez-vous with the likes o' you, so sheer
off&mdash;and lively!" At this, the gentleman seems to breathe with
difficulty, he chokes, gives a ferocious tug at his high cravat,
then snapping large teeth hisses:</p>

<p>"S-s-sir, you are addressing...and provoking Sir Robert
Chalmers&mdash;the Chalmers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deah me!" says Sam the mariner becoming my lord the Earl. "Then
I take joy to inform Sir Robert Chalmers that I do not like the
sound of him any better than the sight of him and beg him to oblige
me by removing himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," nods Sir Robert, "you are a stranger to
town&mdash;ignorance excuses you, also I am pressed for time!
But&mdash;should you annoy me again&mdash;if you are then no wiser,
be warned now." So saying, Sir Robert strides rapidly away. My lord
is still gazing after him when he hears a slow step nearby, glances
thither and beholds a slender, youthful though extremely languid
gentleman who bowing feebly, says, as if speech were an effort
almost beyond his strength:</p>

<p>"Sir, not th' faintest notion who y'are, but f' sake o' pure
humanity, beg t'offer word o' warning 'f I may."</p>

<p>"Oh?" enquires the Earl. "Ah? Pray do."</p>

<p>"F'ler Chalmers, dooced notorious, dead shot, killed several.
Don't do t'quarrel with&mdash;dey'vlish dangerous f'ler. Hope
m'advice don't 'ffend ya."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful, sir. Whom have I to thank?"</p>

<p>"Standish, sir. Henry&mdash;no one in particular&mdash;'d
afternoon!" And with another feeble bow, young Mr. Standish ambles
away rather like a tottery old gentleman.</p>

<p>And now, hearing a merry babblement of voices chiefly feminine,
away speeds my lord in the opposite direction and turning a corner
in full career, comes upon a lady so suddenly that before he knows
it, she is in his arms.</p>

<p>"Gracious mercy of Heaven!" she exclaims. "What a bear! My feet
yards above the earth! Put me down this moment, sir." All
stammering apology my lord obeys and sees her for a very small
person of indeterminate age, an extremely dignified, small lady,
whose curls are suspiciously black, cheeks as suspiciously pink,
though her eyes are remarkably bright and quick with perennial
youth; now looking down into these beautiful and quite wonderful
eyes, my lord (this hunted wretch) feels instinctively that here is
a friend so for a brief space they regard each other eye to eye,
then before he can speak, she demands:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, where on earth were you going in such furious
hurry?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere, marm&mdash;madam, so long as I keep well to wind'ard
of the Duchess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oho! So you're running away from the Duchess, are you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then give me your hand and let's run!"</p>

<p>"Lady," says my lord, taking the very small hand she proffers.
"God love you&mdash;those eyes o' yours spoke me true, for the
moment they looked at me I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run!" says she, imperiously! So away they flee, hand-in-hand,
until this very small lady gasps: "Wait...oh, I'm
breathless...wait&mdash;no, you must carry me if you&mdash;"
Powerful arms swung her lightly aloft and thus cradled, she directs
him until in remote corner they reach an arbour shaded by trees and
bowered in roses. Here he sets her down and she having adjusted her
somewhat ruffled frills and furbelows, seats herself upon cushioned
settle and beckons him beside her, saying:</p>

<p>"Now continue! What were you remarking about my eyes?"</p>

<p>"That they are mighty sharp, marm&mdash;madam, very wise yet
kind, like the eyes of a friend."</p>

<p>"Ho! Is this all? Don't you think they are very beautiful
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then why not say so?"</p>

<p>"Because a friend's eyes are always beautiful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fiddle-faddle and nonsense! I know friends with eyes like pigs'
eyes, and holes in blankets, and Friendship cannot alter the fact,
so don't you try."</p>

<p>"No, madam, for just at present your eyes are a bit too sharp
for friendship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In-deed! Well now, tell me why you are running away from the
Duchess."</p>

<p>"Not from her so much, madam, as the fact that she's to
introduce me to her lady friends&mdash;hundreds of 'em! I'm to bow
and scrape and be paraded before them all which you'll agree is
enough to shake any man."</p>

<p>"But I do not agree. Oh no, not for a moment! Most men would
adore such occasion and why not you?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm clean out o' my reckoning and no soundings! All
these fine folk! This isn't my world. I'm a stranger here and
what's more I don't belong and never shall."</p>

<p>"Then why are you here?"</p>

<p>"All John's fault, marm, Sir John Orme, he's a friend o' the
Duchess and well, here I am, and heartily wishing myself anywhere
else."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;you are the Earl of Wrybourne!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am," his lordship admits and with look so abject and sigh
so very like a groan that the lady's mobile lips twitch, her bright
eyes twinkle though her voice is perfectly solemn as she
enquires:</p>

<p>"Why so miserable, pray?"</p>

<p>"Oh, marm," exclaims the Earl, forgetting everything except that
he is Sam, "I loathe the very idea of it, because of the hateful
name I bear and all that goes with it! Then besides I'm a sailor
and pretty rough though Sir John, bless his heart, has been
schooling me in ways of speech and gentle manners, ay, he's done
his best with me, but I'm only the more certain my proper place is
aboard ship instead of a palace the like o' this! As a sailorman I
was well enough, but as an earl and aristocrat I'm all adrift and
like to founder. So here am I on my beam-ends, as I knew I should
be, feeling mere clumsy fool and terrified of all these fine
ladies. This is why I'm so glad, so thankful to have found one like
you!"</p>

<p>"Why?" she demands, studying his troubled face with keenly
appraising scrutiny. "Because of my so beautiful eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" he answers gravely. "And all the rest of you. So, marm,
although I'm Japhet and an earl by law and must so be to everyone
else in London, I'd like you to know me for what I truly
am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe I do!" she nods.</p>

<p>"Then if you'll bless me with your friendship will you call me
'Sam'?"</p>

<p>"I will, on condition that when you are made known to the
company as you must be, you will play your part as boldly as you
did on your ship in battle&mdash;Oh, I've heard a few facts about
you from Sir John. And now, if we are to be friends, tell me why
you so hate the rank and wealth you have inherited?"</p>

<p>"I despise my name because the Scropes have generally been such
scoundrels, and I hate all the money because it makes me grieve all
the more for my dead mother."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear of her, if I may&mdash;Sam."</p>

<p>So once again he told that tale of hardship, grinding poverty
and a woman's selfless devotion, told it simply, briefly though
with such deep and tender sincerity that when his last words had
been uttered, there ensued a silence&mdash;broken at last by sound
of hasty footsteps and a dignified, somewhat flurried personage
stands to bow profoundly and say breathlessly, though with the
utmost deference:</p>

<p>"Madame, your guests are all assembled and await your Grace's
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Very well, Smedley, you may inform them that we, Lord Wrybourne
and myself, shall join them shortly."</p>

<p>"I thank your Grace!" with which the personage bows himself
away.</p>

<p>"Marm...madam&mdash;" stammers Sam, rising in no little dismay.
"So you&mdash;you are&mdash;the Duchess."</p>

<p>"My lord," she answers, rising also and sinking before him in
graceful curtsy, "I have the honour to present myself to your
lordship! Now Sam&mdash;bow! A trifle lower&mdash;y-e-e-s. Ha! Sir
John's efforts have not been wasted, as I shall tell him. Come now.
Your arm!"</p>

<h3><a name="ch203" id="ch203"></a>CHAPTER III. TELLS HOW VANITY
FAIR RECEIVED MY LORD</h3>

<p>So, beneath the aegis of this small but very potent lady, my
lord makes his obeisance to the World of Fashion; he bows to noble
dames stately and otherwise, who smile, chatter, or merely stare;
he touches hands with gentlemen who talk of the weather, the war,
Old Bony, our Nelson, England's glory and loss, they shake grave
heads, snuff and pass on; Beauty parades itself with demure coyness
or shyly provocative glances&mdash;until a voice somewhat muted,
drawls:</p>

<p>"Takin' liberty t' warn y'again&mdash;Gorgon 'pproaches! Advise
y'dodge&mdash;this way!" Turning, my lord beholds the languid form
of Mr. Standish who, beckoning feebly, moves with unexpected
celerity, guiding my lord who follows instinctively until in remote
corner of broad terrace, he sinks upon a cushioned ottoman,
saying:</p>

<p>"She was after y', m'lud, the Juggernaut, full cry, champin' the
bit, all maternal determination!"</p>

<p>"Who was?" enquires my lord, glancing about uneasily.</p>

<p>"The Marwood mama, th' dem dowager, awf'lest of 'em all, wi' th'
loveliest daughter in Creation&mdash;can't think how she managed
it!&mdash;t'mother such daughter! One o' Nature's mysteries
and&mdash;demme, she's flushed us&mdash;I'm an off 'un!" And off
goes Mr. Standish, vanishing in the moment that a full-throated
imperious voice exclaims:</p>

<p>"Japhet&mdash;oh, Japhet! My dear, dear Wrybourne! Oh, my
heart!" Glancing round in no little apprehension, my lord beholds a
tall be-plumed dame of commanding presence, whose awful stateliness
overwhelms him, whose determined graciousness saps his will-power,
whose appalling familiarity smites him dumb. Sinking magnificently
upon the ottoman she beckons him beside her with a dreadful
coquetry.</p>

<p>"Wrybourne, my dearest boy," says she between carmined lips that
smile beneath arrogant nose and eyes that languish soulfully, "my
poor heart so beats, so leaps and flutters&mdash;as of yore! For,
ah me&mdash;you are the breathing image of your splendid gallant
father, your handsome sire, the Japhet of my adoring youth!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, marm?" his lordship mutters.</p>

<p>"And indeed!" she sighs. "Ah, what a man&mdash;so charmingly
compelling! So deliciously audacious! Years ago...he and I...Ah me,
how fleeteth cruel Time! The rose of yesterday&mdash;alas, so soon
to fade!" Here my lady pausing to sigh and gaze upon him as in fond
recollection, his lordship shifts uneasily yet contrives to
murmur:</p>

<p>"Really, marm?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she sighs, "the dear past is real again, my dear boy,
lives again in you&mdash;so does your noble father." Here my lord
seems about to protest but sighs instead and the Dowager Lady
Marwood continues: "Oh memory, memory! And you are Japhet, too,
with his chestnut, curling locks! The years roll back and I am
young again! Then there was Julian, poor, gallant Julian! Alas,
what an end for such gay Lothario! So tragical! So dramatic and yet
how like dear, wild Julian! How handsome, how witty, how splendid
was he! I mourn him as loved friend! Ah, but now you shall tell me
of yourself, Japhet, you are or were a sailor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'lady."</p>

<p>"Well, I adore all sailors from our lamented Nelson our national
hero, down to the humblest tar. Were you with our Nelson, one of
his glorious 'band of brothers'?"</p>

<p>"No, marm."</p>

<p>"A pity! He was so truly heroic though small, not so tall as
your shoulder! I danced a gavotte with him once in Italy it was.
And he so debonnaire, so graceful despite his empty sleeve pinned
across his breast ablaze with stars and orders, though it flapped
so comically each time he bowed! You were at Trafalgar, of
course."</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, though had no part in the action, we were carrying
despatches."</p>

<p>"No matter, you were there and&mdash;ha, yonder is my dove at
last, my olive branch, my one beloved pledge&mdash;my only child!
So wilful, Japhet, I spoil her but so do the gentlemen, such
homage&mdash;a reigning toast already!" Here, in rich contralto the
Dowager calls: "Oh, my love! Rowena, my precious one, be pleased to
approach."</p>

<p>My lord glances up, draws a deep breath and sits motionless,
gazing at the most radiantly beautiful vision of loveliness he has
ever seen: slowly, gracefully she advances all dainty seduction
from slender, sandalled foot to the crowning glory of her gleaming
yellow hair.</p>

<p>"My own," says her mother, tenderly, "you behold here beside me
the dear son of a dearer old friend of my girlhood&mdash;Rowena, my
love, I make known another Japhet, Earl of Wrybourne-Feveril!"</p>

<p>Dumbly my lord rises, speechlessly he bows before this shape of
splendid young womanhood...</p>

<p>Her watchful lady-mother, seeing him thus spellbound, smiles
happily while the arching nostrils of her haughty nose palpitate
slightly as she rises, saying:</p>

<p>"I must have a word with the dear Duchess. Meanwhile, Japhet, I
charge you with the care of my beloved child. Ah,
youth&mdash;youth!" sighs she, striking an attitude of rather
awesome ecstasy as she gazes upon them, "ah, youth&mdash;the rosy,
rosy hours, alas how soon they fleet, how fast they speed away!
Bring me my precious Rowena within the hour, Japhet."</p>

<p>My lord bows and still dumb, glances again at the radiant
creature beside him, smitten anew by the exquisite daintiness and
delicate grace of her, as she stands gazing down at her own slim,
sandalled foot, yet so perfectly aware of his admiring scrutiny
that, still motionless and without even glancing towards him, she
enquires:</p>

<p>"Well, my lord, what do you think of me? I'm for sale, you
know."</p>

<p>"Sale?" he repeats, and in such tone of shocked amazement that
she troubles to look up at him and with eyes shrewd as they are
beautiful.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," she replies, delicate brows lifting, "surely
you know? This is the marriage market, the highest bidder takes
me&mdash;perhaps! And this is my first season&mdash;so what offers,
my lord?"</p>

<p>"Lady Rowena," says he, trying not to scowl, "I think we'll
change the subject."</p>

<p>"Oh no, my lord," and now in her soft voice is a note of
bitterness, "business is business!"</p>

<p>"Ay, but I'm no business man, I'm only a sailor."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;of course," says she, more naturally, "this explains
why you are so different."</p>

<p>"Oh?" he murmurs, pondering this. "Pray how?"</p>

<p>"In every way."</p>

<p>"You mean I'm awkward...clumsy, ay, so I am."</p>

<p>"Wrong!" And now her voice is kind as her look. "You are just
natural. Yes, I think&mdash;no I'm sure that you are the most
unaffected person I have ever met. And now, my lord, what is your
estimation of&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well&mdash;it goes beyond my poor words."</p>

<p>"Which is mere evasion!" she nods. "Then since you won't venture
to pronounce judgment on me, what do you think
of&mdash;Her?&mdash;with a very capital aitch!" and the beautiful
head inclines itself in a certain direction. "I may tell you that
some call her the Carronade because she's so very devastating at
close quarters, some&mdash;the Buccaneer, others&mdash;the
Juggernaut and lots of other things! So what say you of her, my
lord?"</p>

<p>"Which 'her'? Who, pray?"</p>

<p>"Darling mama, of course!" And lo&mdash;the bitterness is
marring this sweet voice again.</p>

<p>"Why since you ask me," says my lord, a little stiffly, "I think
of her as your ladyship's mother."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious&mdash;a snub! You reproach me for being
unfilial! You'll dare to censure me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no! Only I respect all mothers because of my own, for, d'ye
see, I loved her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because she did not put you up for sale to the highest bidder!
Twice I have been nearly sold, once to a man old enough to be my
grandfather, and once to an awful creature who should have been
buried! But I escaped thanks to Henry and my own wit&mdash;oh, pray
let us walk! No, not that way," says she, as they descend the
terrace steps, "I cannot bear company just yet...today I hate them
all!"</p>

<p>"All?" enquires my lord.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes!" she exclaims, fiercely. "I detest all this
fulsome make-believe, our superior affectations, for we are all so
cat and doggy, really&mdash;oh, most politely inhuman&mdash;bows
and curtseys, teeth and claws!"</p>

<p>"Lord!" murmurs the Earl, glancing askance at this beautiful
Ferocity. "Lord love us!"</p>

<p>"I wonder if He can?" says she, bitterly. "Such pompous
Insincerities as we are, such charming shams. And I'm as bad as
any&mdash;a niminy-piminy claw-cat! Today I meet my three closest
friends, we embrace, we kiss, we call each other 'my love,' 'my
darling,' 'my dearest,' though our real names are Jealousy, Malice
and Envy. Yes, I'm a cat with very sharp claws, or I should have
been gobbled up before now! And being such a very catty cat, I'm
wondering what sort of dog you are&mdash;my lord?"</p>

<p>For the first time today he laughs and so joyously that
beautiful Ferocity shows less fierce as he answers:</p>

<p>"I'm a dog with no pretty tricks, that seldom barks, never
bites&mdash;except with just cause, wags his tail to friendly
whistle and his name, to his friends, is&mdash;Sam."</p>

<p>"Sam?" she repeated, as if trying the sound of it, her mouth
lovely and smiling again.</p>

<p>"A somewhat plebeian name, I suppose," he suggests, "but then,
so is Tom, Dick and&mdash;Harry!"</p>

<p>"Ah?" she murmurs, the smile vanishing. "You know him?"</p>

<p>"If he is Mr. Standish I met him about half-an-hour ago."</p>

<p>"Here?" she exclaims, in sudden anxiety. "Oh and I warned him! I
told him not to come..."</p>

<p>"May I ask you if he is&mdash;the one?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replies, after momentary hesitation, "yes, it is
Harry. It would be the poorest of them all! You see his reckless
father gambled everything away before he died leaving his son
almost destitute. Yes, it's Harry&mdash;and always will be...Though
I don't know why I am talking to you so&mdash;so very
unreservedly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps because you believe I'm the kind of dog that seldom
barks and never bites&mdash;a friend."</p>

<p>Now at this, she turns to look at him very wistfully.</p>

<p>"Oh," she murmurs, "you can never guess how friendless we are,
how utterly helpless, poor Harry and I. Some people have good
angels to watch over them&mdash;ours must have flown very far
away!"</p>

<p>"However," says my lord, rather diffidently, "a dog can be
useful now and then."</p>

<p>Lady Rowena is looking at him now through a sparkle of tears as
she enquires:</p>

<p>"Does this mean that you&mdash;you of all people would help us,
my lord?"</p>

<p>"Ay, it does. And this dog's name is Sam."</p>

<p>With her eyes still tearful she laughs, saying rather
brokenly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, you are going to be...a terrible disappointment
to...darling mama! For at this very moment she fondly imagines
you...a sighing victim of her daughter's...all-powerful charms! And
instead...here you are...offering me a chance of freedom at
last...of happiness with my Harry! You are very, very wonderful,
but nobody can possibly help us&mdash;not even you."</p>

<p>"Of course not," he answers, "until you begin helping
yourselves."</p>

<p>"How, tell me&mdash;how ever can we?"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of poverty?"</p>

<p>"Not with Harry."</p>

<p>"Then why not elope, marry, and dare the future?"</p>

<p>"So I would," sighs she, clasping her hands. "Ah, God knows I
would have done, but I...dare not!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmurs my lord, "may I know why?"</p>

<p>"Take me into the arbour yonder, and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>So in that same fragrant bower where the Duchess had listened to
his story, Beauty now tells hers, though with more fire and
passion:</p>

<p>"There is a hateful brute and loathly beast named Robert
Chalmers, we were children together and he was my boyish sweetheart
though he was a beast of a boy, selfish and masterful, said I
belonged to him, and says so today&mdash;he persecutes me, haunts
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet he must love you very greatly."</p>

<p>"Yes, though his love would frighten and shame me were I a timid
miss, but I am not easily terrified, thank heaven!"</p>

<p>"What says your mother of him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, darling mama favours him, of course, because failing a
better, he is a very good match, highly connected and plenty of
money! And besides, she is terribly afraid I shall throw my
precious self away on Harry."</p>

<p>"Then she knows of him?"</p>

<p>"Of course! Darling mama has eyes everywhere and knows
everything. She must have warned Robert for he came to me and in
his dreadful, smiling way suggested I had better discourage Harry
or he would. Of course I did not, and of course he did&mdash;with a
bullet."</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Standish wounded?"</p>

<p>"Desperately! Robert forced the meeting and then&mdash;while my
poor Harry lay between life and death, the beast told me he had
spared his life just this once but that if there had to be a 'next
time'&mdash;these were the brute's very words&mdash;'he would be
less merciful'!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmurs my lord, thoughtfully. "Ah! And is this gentleman
so deadly?"</p>

<p>"Indeed yes&mdash;yes, he is. Oh, Robert is terrible! They say
he can 'hit his man wherever he chooses' and that 'he never
misses'! He has fought very often, here and in France&mdash;Oh, and
he always wins! This is why the beast is so honoured and respected
wherever he goes!"</p>

<p>"No," murmurs my lord, "only here&mdash;in Vanity Fair..." It is
now that Lady Rowena shrinks instinctively, whispering a startled
"Hush!" For, as if conjured thither by their words, this very
redoubtable gentleman is seen approaching, an angry-seeming
gentleman in such hurry that he would have passed without espying
them had not my lord coughed loudly, whereat Sir Robert halts,
stares, and comes striding like the perfectly assured, extremely
formidable person he knows himself to be.</p>

<p>"Aha," says he, with show of large, white teeth, "a game of hide
and seek, m' sweet soul? Well, I've found you as I always do and
always shall, because I am your destiny&mdash;and you know it! I am
also your devoted slave, joyous as ever to serve you, but&mdash;a
slave who must not be denied&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, be done!" sighs she, wearily. "For mercy's sake&mdash;leave
me in peace."</p>

<p>"Rowena," he retorts, his smile widening, brows knitting above
small, glittering eyes, "sweet fool, you cannot escape your
destiny. Come, I will escort you to madam your mother."</p>

<p>"No, Robert! Darling mama placed me, her so precious
asset&mdash;in charge of Lord Wrybourne whom you see here."</p>

<p>"Egad!" he exclaims, glancing at my lord, in affected surprise,
"now you mention him, I do. Servant, m'lord. Now, Rowena, go with
me&mdash;or must I show you how there is no escaping your destiny?
Come, I say!" And he reaches out a hand so possessively that she
recoils with a fierce, gasping: "Don't!"</p>

<p>And now it is that my lord thinks proper to intervene; he rises
languidly, makes a leg, sailor-fashion, corrects this into a
ceremonious bow with elaboration of gesture and advances slowly,
saying in carefully modulated, sweetly dulcet tones:</p>

<p>"My dear, my very dear sir, three times&mdash;no less, you have
proclaimed yourself to be&mdash;Destiny! To this remarkable, not to
say astounding claim, I must beg leave to take exception, though
with all the humility possible, and for the following
reasons&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now as he speaks, my lord continues his insidious advance until
the crested gold buttons of his coat (this work of art) are in
contact with the person of Sir Robert, who instinctively steps
back&mdash;and yet back, for my lord, while talking, continues his
slow and gentle advance; in which ridiculous posture, breast to
breast, these two fine gentlemen move on together, Sir Robert
backward, my lord forward, saying as he smiles into the baronet's
narrowed eyes: "For, d'ye see, my dear sir, that any mere human,
ay, even you, should dare claim to be Destiny, makes me bold to
imagine that I may become&mdash;Nemesis."</p>

<p>By this time they are screened from the arbour by a tall yew
hedge&mdash;and here my lord suffers a dire "sea-change," for the
smilingly-gracious, gentle-spoken Aristocrat is transmuted into the
grim, harsh-voiced, fighting sailorman, whose large hand,
swift-moving, grasps the baronet's startled face, covers it, shakes
it, hurls it away&mdash;and Sir Robert, thus outrageously
surprised, falls backward and lies for the moment shocked beyond
speech or movement, staring up at his aggressor, who scowling down
on him with eyes quite as merciless as his own, says in fierce,
snarling voice:</p>

<p>"'Destiny,' d'ye call yourself? Why, y'poor, damned, lubberly
hulk, what's to stay me running ye under, treading ye into the
earth? Get up, Mister Destiny, and Nemesis shall knock ye flat
again! Stand up!"</p>

<p>Still dazed and shaken, Sir Robert struggles up to an elbow,
glances around, is relieved to see that no one has apparently
witnessed his discomfiture, and looking up at his assailant, draws
a deep breath and despite his lowly posture, contrives to speak
with a certain dignity and the utmost venom:</p>

<p>"My lord, though you speak and act like blackguardly ruffian, I
promise you shall die like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Sir Robert," my lord replies, becoming again the urbane fine
gentleman, "of this I am perfectly aware."</p>

<p>"Naturally, my lord! But what you cannot and shall not know
until I so please, is the precise hour when I shall accord you this
honourable death, which shall be sudden and preferably in the open
air&mdash;at dawn or sunset. But, pray mark this&mdash;at my
pleasure and in my own time! I shall allow your lordship a brief
span of living, a few days, weeks, or even months, as best pleases
me and suits my convenience. So while I permit you to live, let me
urge your lordship to make the most of it, enjoy it to the
full&mdash;with this certainty that soon or late, whenever the whim
takes me, I shall call you to account and shoot you like a
dog."</p>

<p>"Oddly enough, sir, Lady Rowena and I were talking of dogs a
while since, before an odd creature calling itself 'Destiny'
intruded, and I was saying something to the effect of how some dogs
are all bark and no bite and others all bite and never a
bark&mdash;now you, sir, not only bark quite damnably, but you also
yap."</p>

<p>"Bark or yap, my lord, I shall permit you to live awhile that
you may ruminate as to the exact hour of your dying and become
aware of this fact that 'in the midst of life we are in death.'
Think on this, my lord, eat and drink with it, sleep and wake with
it, expect me to summon you at any moment to die&mdash;and be
damned!"</p>

<p>"Sir," says my lord, shaking his head as in gentle though
shocked reproof, "I find you so very truly detestable, such
pernicious pest and ugly blot that when you summon me and we meet,
then, sir, instead of simply maiming you for life as I intended, I
shall be greatly minded to end you for good and all, ay, and for
the good of all. We shall see when the time comes. However, sir, do
not let us have any more of your 'destiny' nonsense. And now,
finding your air, face and person so repulsive I'll be rid of 'em.
But until I am gone, pray make no attempt to rise or I must
pleasure myself by flattening you out again, therefore pray lie
still. So, until our next happy meeting, ay, and after, the devil
keep you, sir."</p>

<p>Then with airy flourish, my lord strides lightly away.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch204" id="ch204"></a>CHAPTER IV. IN WHICH MY LORD
ENGAGES A SECRETARY AND WINS FRIENDSHIP</h3>

<p>Returning to the arbour he is met by a pale, great-eyed Rowena
who, clasping her hands, exclaims tearfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, what have you clone? Merciful heaven&mdash;how will it end?
Oh, my lord, my lord!"</p>

<p>"The name is Sam!" he reminds her.</p>

<p>"That beast means to kill you&mdash;and he will! There was death
in the way he looked at you."</p>

<p>"Ah, then you saw?"</p>

<p>"Of course! I heard your voice so I stole and peeped...And, oh
God, forgive me&mdash;this is my fault! I led you into this! Your
blood will be upon me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no! No indeed! Sir 'Destiny' and I ran into each other
before I had the joy of meeting you. Ay, we ran foul of each other
in every sense."</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord&mdash;Sam, is this true?"</p>

<p>"Abs-lootly!" drawled a familiar voice and into the arbour
stepped Mr. Standish, saying: "Hope I don't intrude. But,
m'dear...simply must tell you! Amazin' business! Wrybourne's method
is quite dooced original and arrestin'&mdash;he merely takes his
man by the face and&mdash;throws him away!"</p>

<p>"I know, Harry, I know!" gasps Rowena, "I saw&mdash;he did
actually throw Robert away! Oh, and this means
bloodshed&mdash;death! But, oh, did you see how Robert fell? Legs
in the air&mdash;feet above his head! Oh, Harry&mdash;Sam&mdash;"
Here, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, Rowena does both, to the
consternation of her hearers.</p>

<p>"Hold hard, m'dearest!" Mr. Standish implores. "Curb
now&mdash;curb! Sit tight, m'love! Oh dem, she's goin' t'swoon or
somethin'! Take her other hand, Wrybourne&mdash;now open
it&mdash;now slap it like I do&mdash;smartly, m'dear f'low,
smartly!" So, while Rowena sobs, laughs and chokes, these two
dismayed gentlemen slap her pink palms until they glow pinker and
their lovely owner gasps:</p>

<p>"Stop&mdash;stop, you great sillies...I'm only
laughing...now!"</p>

<p>"Eh? Only laughing? Sure o' that, m'dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though it's perfectly horrid of me when&mdash;it may
mean&mdash;death! Oh, my lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, b'James! I was f'gettin' too! Chalmers'll be after your
blood, Wrybourne&mdash;thirstin' for 't&mdash;tongue lollin',
m'dear f'low. And, oh demme, he'll have it too, for he's calamitous
wi' the barkers or sharps! And he'll keep y' in suspense&mdash;it's
a trick he uses t' shake his 'ponent's nerve!"</p>

<p>"However," says my lord, glancing from one anxious young face to
the other and touched by their very evident sincerity, "pray sit
down, Mr. Standish, and let us converse of something more pleasant,
ourselves, for instance, for I'm happy to say your lovely and
gracious Rowena has honoured me with her friendship."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Hal!" she breaks in, giving a hand to each. "Here
we sit joined in friendship because, Harry, instead of the sighing,
ogling wooer I dreaded and darling mama hoped he would be, I have
proved Lord Wrybourne so truly a friend that he is 'Sam'&mdash;yes,
and almost before I knew it, I was telling him&mdash;confiding to
him all about&mdash;us!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Did y' tell him how and why you eternally blight me with a
continual, dem, everlasting 'no'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replies mendaciously, "I said it was because I fear
poverty."</p>

<p>"Naturally, m'dear, so do I! Yet with you I'd dare even
that...I'm keepin' the old farmhouse&mdash;last bit o' the mater's
dowry, in hopes! Not much of a place, but with you in it,
well&mdash;you could make it&mdash;home, y'know."</p>

<p>"Could I, Hal?" she murmurs, leaning towards him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answers, leaning towards her. "That's why I haven't
sold the old place, hopin' you might&mdash;some day! I shall always
hope, y'know."</p>

<p>"Shall you, Hal?" she whispers; no bitterness now in beauteous
face or tender voice, also Mr. Standish has quite forgotten his
languor and shows for the vitally-eager, manly young fellow he
truly is&mdash;or so thinks my lord, watching them critically, and
they so completely oblivious of him and everything except each
other that they start almost guiltily as he says in his hearty
seaman's voice:</p>

<p>"Ay, hope's the word, never say die! And if we're to be
friends&mdash;I'll take a stroll, as a friend should. But before I
leave you together a while, here's an offer for your consideration,
Mr. Standish&mdash;I need a private secretary who will also be a
friend, will you accept?"</p>

<p>"Eh? A secretary? Me? But, m'dear, old lord, I hardly know how
t' write&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry!" exclaims his lady, indignantly. "Do not be so
ridiculous! He writes extremely well, Sam&mdash;indeed quite
legibly&mdash;sometimes!"</p>

<p>"No, m'angel," sighs Mr. Standish, "can't let him be deluded b'
friendship! Fact is, old f'low, as a scribe I'm a poor
fish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry, you shall not disparage yourself so outrageously! He
writes beautiful letters, Sam&mdash;to me!"</p>

<p>"And no wonder!" smiles the Earl. "Then, Mr. Standish, I've
quite a number of horses in town, but I ride like a sailor and
shall need some lessons."</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaims Mr. Standish. "That's certainly more in my
line&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry can ride anything, Sam."</p>

<p>"Then I hope he will oblige me by accepting."</p>

<p>"He will! He shall! He does&mdash;say so, Harry, at once!"</p>

<p>"And, by the way, I offer six hundred a year to begin
with&mdash;if you think this adequate!"</p>

<p>"Adequate!" sighs Rowena, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>"No, Wrybourne, no!" says Mr. Standish, forgetting to drawl,
"it's too much! I should never be worth it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will, Harry! You must be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, m'dearest gal, I never earned a penny in my confounded
life!"</p>

<p>"Then begin now, for&mdash;my sake, Hal."</p>

<p>"Eh? Your sake? It's a go! Then what about yoke o'
matrimony&mdash;nothing to stay you&mdash;double
harness&mdash;what's to stop you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" says my lord, rising. "So I'll leave you to talk it
over." Scarcely has he stepped from the arbour than he espies Sir
John Orme approaching and hurries to meet him.</p>

<p>Now though Sir John's fine face shows serene as ever, his voice
is low and troubled as he says:</p>

<p>"Ah, Sam, you have shocked me profoundly! For I was a distressed
witness of your quite ruffianly assault upon Sir Robert Chalmers!
Instead of quarrelling with dignity and finesse as gentlemen
should, you comported yourself like a
veritable&mdash;coal-heaver!"</p>

<p>"No, John&mdash;like the sailorman I am. The fellow deserved
knocking down, instead I merely pushed him over." Sir John's mobile
lips twitch, but his black brows knit themselves above hawk nose as
he continues:</p>

<p>"I warned you repeatedly how when a gentleman sees fit to
quarrel, he should do so with grace, and eschew all violence of
tone or gesture. Also I am much concerned for&mdash;Oh, my dear
boy, you are not aboard ship now where such affairs are settled by
honest fists and forgotten, but in Vanity Fair, this world of
make-believe which is yet so terribly real and nothing more so than
the abstraction called 'Honour' which, though possessing here a far
less noble meaning than that given in the dictionary, is yet so
precious that noble gentlemen must fight and die for it or be
outcast. Thus Sir Robert will certainly call you out and do his
utmost to kill you."</p>

<p>"Ay, so he assured me, John."</p>

<p>"Consequently I am gravely anxious on your account&mdash;for he
is esteemed a dangerous fellow, a much experienced duellist, or so
the Duchess informs me."</p>

<p>"Eh? The Duchess, John? But how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately Her Grace was with me and also witnessed your
very lamentable exhibition of&mdash;how not to do it."</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!" exclaims the Earl, greatly dismayed. "Lord love
me!"</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped so," sighs Sir John, "all things
considered!"</p>

<p>"Was she as shocked as yourself, John?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say. But she desires to see you alone before you
depart."</p>

<p>"Does she, b'George! Then I'll slip my moorings now&mdash;Oh,
damme, there's 'darling mama,' Lady Marwood, John, bearing down on
us! Hold her in play while I go speak word o' warning!"</p>

<p>Back to the arbour speeds my lord at sight of whom up starts Mr.
Standish, saying:</p>

<p>"So ho&mdash;the Juggernaut approaches, I see b'your look. I'll
vanish!"</p>

<p>"I shall expect you tomorrow!" says my lord, as they shake
hands.</p>

<p>"Without fail, Wrybourne, and many thanks! But th' dear soul
still says 'no'! Can't think why&mdash;no reason now!
Goo'-bye!"</p>

<p>"My lady," begins the Earl so soon as they are alone.</p>

<p>"No, Sam, please use my name."</p>

<p>"Rowena, why is it still 'no'?"</p>

<p>"Because I still dare not say 'yes'&mdash;and if I explained to
Harry he would fight again and be killed."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmurs my lord. "Ah? Then you must think I shall also be
killed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pray do not talk of it&mdash;don't! It is too frightful!
You&mdash;we&mdash;might have all been such dear friends and yet it
must end so horribly whenever Robert desires."</p>

<p>"So you are quite sure he will end me?"</p>

<p>"He is so terrible! But I shall&mdash;pray for you, Sam, yes
with all my heart, day and night&mdash;" So saying she gives him
both her hands so impulsively and with such eloquent look that my
lord, as impulsively, stoops and kisses them, then starts as a
throaty voice cries:</p>

<p>"Oh, fie upon us, Sir John, we intrude! We shall fright away shy
Eros, terrify sweet Cupid the rosy roguish archer, let us fly! Dear
Japhet, my sweet child, enjoy the brief, glad hour&mdash;we will
waft ourselves hence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, darling mama, we will waft along with you!"</p>

<p>Thus presently, back went they all four to mingle with the
throng (and more or less envious mamas) wherefore my Lady Marwood's
stately head is so proudly borne, her plumes nodding so
triumphantly that Rumour is bred and Envy indeed follows in her
train.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch205" id="ch205"></a>CHAPTER V. IN WHICH MY LORD
BECOMES MERELY SAM</h3>

<p>My lord finds the little Duchess in small, cosy chamber,
performing with a very large, silver teapot.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Ferocity," says she, nodding, "you may sit down and
take tea with me; you probably detest it, but you shall drink it as
a penance&mdash;though to be sure I'm grateful to you for affording
me a thrill by out-bruting Sir Brutality Chalmers so
outrageously."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmurs my lord. "I was afraid your Grace would be
shocked."</p>

<p>"Indeed I was&mdash;delightfully! You showed like battle, murder
and sudden death all rolled into one, though considering you are a
sailor your language fell much below expectation, neither oath nor
curse&mdash;and only one chastely demure 'damn'! However, your
actions were completely satisfactory, Sir Brutality fell beneath
your arm with a pleasing violence that must have shaken his nasty
person from top to toe, inside and out. Ah, but&mdash;though you
stood above his writhing form like Ajax defying innumerable
thunderbolts, he will probably slay you for it soon or
late&mdash;and all for that Marwood minx."</p>

<p>"Minx, madam? Can you possibly mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rowena&mdash;certainly I do! Is it any use warning you that she
is heartless as she is beautiful and mercenary as her odious
mother&mdash;is it?</p>

<p>"No, madam, not a bit, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! So she has her pretty claws in you already, has she?"</p>

<p>Now here my lord abandoning his fine airs, becomes merely Sam,
and retorts bluntly:</p>

<p>"No, marm! And you do her gross injustice."</p>

<p>"Oh, do I&mdash;indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, that you do! Your judgment of her is entirely wrong,
ay, you're completely out o' your reckoning."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed this little, great lady, setting down her cup,
the better to stare and give effect to her amazed resentment.
"Great goodness! Upon my immortal soul I never heard
such&mdash;such audacious impertinence!"</p>

<p>"No, only truth, marm. For indeed you are very cruelly wrong.
Lady Rowena has honoured me with her friendship and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fiddle-de-dee and flap-jack! Tush, boo and bah! No mere man
could be merely a friend to such beautiful witch as she!"</p>

<p>"Probably not, marm, unless a man happened to...well...love
another 'she' just as beautiful."</p>

<p>"Eh? Aha&mdash;another? Then you are already in love?"</p>

<p>"Heart and soul, marm!"</p>

<p>"Deeear me! What passion is here! How sighfully
romantic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Sam, beginning to scowl, "pray don't try to make
light mockery o' this love of mine, because it is the best part of
me. Ay, 'tis clean and sweet as the open sea, 'tis better suited to
fragrant countryside, the leafy solitude of woods at twilight sweet
wi' the song of lonely bird, rather than this mockery called Vanity
Fair. So, my lady, pray don't try to make joke of it because this,
to me, is a&mdash;very holy thing."</p>

<p>The Duchess lifts her tea-cup as if about to drink, sets it down
again, and says in voice marvellously altered:</p>

<p>"No, Sam, I will not mock your love. God forbid! For such great
passion ennobles man and woman, makes this world the
sweeter&mdash;and alas, is all too rare! Indeed there are very few
so blessed&mdash;to find such love."</p>

<p>"Ay," nodded Sam, "I've knocked around the world and I'm sure o'
that&mdash;and so it is all the more precious to me, d'ye see?"</p>

<p>"Does she return your love?"</p>

<p>"So she tells me."</p>

<p>"Then why is she not your countess?"</p>

<p>"Because she places duty first."</p>

<p>"May I know her name?"</p>

<p>And after brief hesitation, he answers:</p>

<p>"Andromeda."</p>

<p>Her Grace, in the act of taking up the teapot, pauses, blinks
those beautiful though very sharp eyes of hers, but all she says
is:</p>

<p>"Let me refill your cup, Sam."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" he answers.</p>

<p>"So you actually do like tea?"</p>

<p>"Ay, marm, though I didn't know it until she learned me."</p>

<p>"Your Andromeda, of course. A quaint name&mdash;will you tell me
about her?"</p>

<p>Quick to heed the speaker's new gentleness of look and tone, Sam
responds and with such simple eloquence that the Duchess utters no
word (a remarkable fact) until he ends with sigh and the question:
"So that's how things are, and what can I do? What d'you think of
it all?"</p>

<p>"Girl's a fool, of course! And you trounced the uncle across
your knee, did you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and grieve to confess it."</p>

<p>"So you should, for he has always been most tragically
unfortunate, poor Arthur!"</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh&mdash;you know him, madam?"</p>

<p>"All his unhappy life, he is a kinsman of mine. Ah&mdash;so
greatly gifted he would have achieved greatness but for his cruel
reverses. The woman he adored jilted him and he nearly died of
grief. Your Uncle Julian shot him in a duel, a head wound, and he
was never the same after. Then his fortune was lost in some bank
crash or other. Today he is little better than a child, his great
gifts all wasted and he now a peevish recluse, would be entirely
desolate but for his niece's perfectly self-less, untiring
devotion!"</p>

<p>"Yet, marm, you called her a fool."</p>

<p>"So I did, so I do, and so she is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And so it is I love her&mdash;though, d'ye see, I'm all too
rough and unworthy such an angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense! No man ever can love an angel, her wings
would be so incommodious and forbidding, not to mention her
halo&mdash;if angels wear the things. However, it's high time
Andromeda remembers she is merely a woman all flesh and blood with
a dash of the divine, like the rest of us, and acts accordingly,
You say she loves you&mdash;then we must see that she behaves as a
fine, healthy woman should."</p>

<p>"Ay, if she only would!" he sighs. "But what of her uncle, for,
d'ye see, he vows he'll end himself if she leaves him or marries
me.</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! And yet&mdash;he might, poor soul&mdash;unless I
take him in hand as I have before now. Yes, I'd manage
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, marm!" Sam exclaims with an almost breathless eagerness.
"If you only could and would!"</p>

<p>"Of course I could and would&mdash;and will&mdash;on a
condition!"</p>

<p>"Anything," cries Sam. "I'll agree to anything&mdash;" here,
warned by her look, he sat up, became the Earl, and added: "except
one thing, madam."</p>

<p>"Ah!" quoth she, nodding. "You've guessed aright, my condition
is that you give up your meeting with that death-dealing monster
Sir Robert Chalmers. And of course you're going to say 'no'."</p>

<p>"True, madam, 'no' it is and must be."</p>

<p>"You know he carries certain death in that right hand of
his?"</p>

<p>"I have heard so, your Grace. But the weapons I shall choose
will set us upon a pretty fair equality."</p>

<p>"Sam, if I beg and entreat you not to fight&mdash;for my sake,
how then?"</p>

<p>"No, my lady."</p>

<p>"If I implore you for Andromeda's sake?"</p>

<p>"It must still be no, madam."</p>

<p>"Even though I offer to set Andromeda in those nice, strong arms
of yours&mdash;to hold and to have till&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, madam, in mercy don't torment me!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then&mdash;if instead of the warm, sweet loveliness
of your Andromeda, with the blessed joy and hope of children, you
will choose death and a clammy grave, so be it, my poor Sam.
Good-bye, my lord, I shall send a very large and lovely wreath for
your coffin."</p>

<p>"Your Grace, madam&mdash;Oh, marm, will you allow me to call and
see you again? May I, please?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Sam. I shall always be glad to see you at any
time&mdash;so long as you are alive. When do you fight this
abominable duel?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea."</p>

<p>"Well, today is Friday&mdash;I shall expect you next Thursday,
without fail&mdash;if you happen to be alive. However, you shall
hear from me. Now good-bye, and I think I like the sailor of you,
Sam, better than the earl, Japhet&mdash;so far. However, time shall
prove this&mdash;unless Death should supervene, which God forbid,
my poor, my foolish, my dear Sam."</p>

<p>"Lord love you," says he, gratefully, "what friends we are going
to be!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she sighs, "only perhaps!"</p>

<p>"Pray marm," he enquires, gazing down at the small vital hand
that clasps his big one so heartily, "just what might you mean by
'perhaps'?"</p>

<p>"Well, instead, let us make it 'if,' Sam&mdash;if you are not
killed too dreadfully soon."</p>

<p>"Ay," he murmurs, "Old Man Death is never very far from some of
us, I guess...Now suppose, marm, I had accepted your condition and
the...joy of Andromeda instead of doing what I must and
shall&mdash;how then?"</p>

<p>"Why then, Sam, my dear, I should have commended your prudence
highly&mdash;but from a very great distance and never, never have
compelled you to drink tea with me again, of course!"</p>

<p>"Oh, marm&mdash;my lady," he exclaims, his grim features all at
once transfigured by his flashing smile, "what a blessing and
comfort you are!" Then stooping, he kisses her small, rather bony
fingers with such fervour that when he is gone, she glances down at
these same fingers very wistfully.</p>

<h3><a name="ch206" id="ch206"></a>CHAPTER VI. GIVES FURTHER BRIEF
DESCRIPTION OF VANITY FAIR AND OF MY LORD'S BEHAVIOUR THEREIN</h3>

<p>My lord is a success, Vanity Fair throws wide its portals and
all within may be his&mdash;at a price. Favoured by Fashion's small
arbiter her Grace of Camberhurst, Fashion does the like; and thus,
backed by his ancient name, his prodigious wealth and forthright
personality, he becomes a, or rather, the celebrity more especially
with The Sex. His occasional lapses into "merely Sam," his blunt
turns of speech and vigour of gesture are declared "so essentially
male" and he is pronounced "an absolute original" and "charming
oddity." So in drawing-room and assembly he becomes "the rage" and
"persona grata" in the clubs.</p>

<p>Then besides, having more money than he can ever spend, he
spends it so lavishly, wins and loses with such placid disregard,
that he becomes almost too popular among the younger element,
dashing bucks and superb dandies&mdash;gilded youth but sportsmen
all&mdash;by whom his somewhat awkward gestures are copied together
with the tie of his cravats, cut of his hair, tilt of his hat and
seaman's rolling stride which Sir John has endeavoured so vainly to
correct and eradicate. So my lord achieves Popularity, this panoply
of glittering tinsel, and wears it with careless ease, to the more
or less articulate jubilation of Mr. Standish, now his devoted and
trusty henchman, and the dignified surprise of Sir John, which
sentiment he expresses on a certain morning at the breakfast table,
thus.</p>

<p>SIR JOHN: I find your popularity, Sam, quite surprising.</p>

<p>SAM (<i>Busied with the luscious fare before him</i>): So do
I.</p>

<p>MR. STANDISH: 'S amazin'! Sam's positively the glass o' fashion
and mould o' form! Acme of elegance and so forth&mdash;put
Brummel's nose out o' joint, y'know. They're advertisin' a new line
o' waistcoats &agrave; la Wrybourne&mdash;fact 'pon honour! And
then the ladies, bless 'em&mdash;such sighful languishing,
b'Gad&mdash;</p>

<p>SIR JOHN: What astonishes me, Sam, is that all this does not
seem to embarrass you in the least.</p>

<p>SAM: Well, no, John, for, d'ye see, I don't bother about it.</p>

<p>MR. STANDISH: 'Xackly, John! Sam's cold-blooded as confounded
fish!</p>

<p>SIR JOHN: Indeed? Then pray inform me, Sam, why I am so
frequently hearing your name associated with that of Lady Rowena
Marwood?</p>

<p>SAM (<i>Puffing at the hot coffee in his cup, to Sir John's very
evident and startled disapproval</i>): For a very good purpose.
Harry&mdash;explain. (<i>He drinks.</i>)</p>

<p>MR. STANDISH: Well, S'John, it's all f' my sake and the behoof
o' The Juggernaut, Darling Mama&mdash;</p>

<p>SAM: He means Lady Marwood, John.</p>

<p>MR. STANDISH: 'Xactly, sir, t' draw the wool over her dooced
uncommonly keen peepers. Sam woos Rowena f' me, proposes romantic
midnight elopement, Darling Mama agrees with joy. At 'pointed hour,
Sam's fastest carriage 'pears, out gets Sam, gives signal, to him
steals Rowena&mdash;watched, be sure, by gloating Mama&mdash;and
away they go&mdash;pull up here&mdash;out pops Sam, in pop I and
away we dash, Rowena and I, to Matrimony and rapture while Darling
Mama sleeps blissfully content. That's it, John, in nutshell. What
d'ye think of it, sir?</p>

<p>SIR JOHN (<i>Shaking stately head in grave reproof</i>): I
forbear comment! Except to declare that&mdash;He pauses at sudden
rap on the door which opens to discover Robins, the stately butler,
portentous of mien, who bears a silver tray whereon repose two
cards, the which he presents with solemn bow, saying:</p>

<p>"My lord, the gentlemen desire instant speech with your lordship
on matter of extreme moment!"</p>

<p>"So?" says my lord, glancing at these cards. "Then you may
inform Major Topham of the Guards, and Viscount Twily that I will
see them here and now."</p>

<p>"But, my dear boy," demurs Sir John, a little anxiously, "in
your dressing-gown?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so, John."</p>

<p>"This will be Chalmers' formal challenge, Sam."</p>

<p>"Ay, so I think. Harry, d'you know these gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"So dooced well, my dear old f'low&mdash;that I&mdash;don't!
Especially Twily, bit of a blackleg, y'know. Here they are!" Again
a tap&mdash;the door opens and two exquisite beings appear, the
Viscount slim, pallid and slightly vulpine, the Major tall,
red-faced, bewhiskered and inclined to swagger and corpulence. Bows
are exchanged, my lord wafts his visitors to chairs, suggests
refreshment which is refused, takes up his coffee-cup and
enquires:</p>

<p>"Well, sirs?"</p>

<p>The Major clears his throat, Viscount Twily smiles thin-lipped,
and they speak alternately:</p>

<p>"M'lord," booms the Major, making the most of his whiskers, "we
have the honour to represent our friend Sir Robert Chalmers, who
has appointed us his seconds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To demand," smiles the Viscount, "a meeting with your lordship,
satisfaction, my lord, and I may add&mdash;to the uttermost and
last extremity!"</p>

<p>My lord, sipping his coffee, looks at the speaker, sets down his
cup and says, musingly:</p>

<p>"Sir, until now I have never had the extremity of joy to see or
hear you, yet you sound remarkably bloody, why? Or is this your
natural charm of manner? But no matter&mdash;instead pray tell me
just when does your principal propose to kill me, where and
how?"</p>

<p>"Yours, my lord," answers Major Topham, "yours is the choice of
weapons, pray be good enough to name 'em."</p>

<p>"And," says the Viscount, with muted eagerness, "our principal,
Sir Robert, will perform upon your lordship at Barn Elms, ten days
hence. The hour he sets you is eight o'clock precisely, morning, of
course. You will choose pistols, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no," answers my lord, slowly, as if pondering the
question, "no, sir&mdash;not&mdash;pistols."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaims the Major, nodding brightly. "Then small swords,
of course."</p>

<p>"N-no," murmurs my lord, still hesitant, "no, Major, nor small
swords."</p>

<p>"Oh? Eh&mdash;not? Then egad&mdash;sabres!"</p>

<p>"No," answers my lord, as if making up his mind at last,
"certainly not sabres."</p>

<p>"Why then," says the Viscount, acidly, "suppose my lord your
lordship troubles to inform us?"</p>

<p>The Earl takes up his coffee-cup, finds it empty and shakes his
head at it, saying:</p>

<p>"I am deliberating, gentlemen, whether to make it boarding-axes
or cutlasses."</p>

<p>Major Topham falls back in his chair, redder of face than ever,
he emits a strangled gasp and then:</p>

<p>"B-b-boarding-axes!" he repeats, explosively, while Viscount
Twily, pallidly vicious, rises to his feet.</p>

<p>"Cutlasses?" he hisses. "If this is a jest, I resent it! B'God,
sir, this is no matter for jest or lightsome trifling&mdash;no!
This affair is to be without respite&mdash;to the death! So I warn
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir," my lord breaks in, setting down his coffee-cup very
tenderly but speaking in the voice of Sam, "be damned t'you and
your warning! My choice is cutlasses, ordinary ship's cutlasses,
d'ye see, thirty-two-inch blades&mdash;these or nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;but," splutters the Major, groping for his
whisker rather dazedly, "these&mdash;oh, I beg, I plead&mdash;my
lord, pray consider&mdash;these are no weapons for a
gentleman!"</p>

<p>"However, they are mine," nods my lord, "you may take 'em or
leave them. If Sir Robert feels himself too much of a gentleman to
use them, let him send me an apology for thus disturbing me at my
breakfast and we'll say no more about it. But, gentlemen both, pray
understand&mdash;cutlasses it shall be&mdash;or an apology I must
have."</p>

<p>"Ap-pology!" whispers the Viscount, between lips tighter now
than ever. "Ha, my lord, I take joy to inform you that Sir Robert
Chalmers never apologizes&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"Very good!" nods my lord. "Then in ten days' time, he and I
will chop at each other with cutlasses. And now, gentlemen, since
we have settled the matter so happily, unless you will join us, be
good enough to permit that we finish breakfast."</p>

<p>Scarcely have these indignant gentlemen stalked out and away,
than Mr. Standish is convulsed with uncontrollable mirth, he gasps,
he groans and finally wheezes:</p>

<p>"Sam...oh, Sam...m'dear...old lord...oho&mdash;cutlasses! Their
dem faces! Cutlasses&mdash;what a prime move...Oh, Sam!" Even Sir
John's gravity relaxes and he smiles though with shake of stately
head, saying:</p>

<p>"With the exception of your one regrettable show of temper, Sam,
you bore yourself well. Your choice of weapons is original and
should make your chances more even&mdash;I hope!"</p>

<p>"Though, demme old f'low, they were right, y'know, a cutlass is
no weapon for a gentleman&mdash;never heard o' such thing!"</p>

<p>"However, I've used one pretty often, Harry, and am fairly handy
with one."</p>

<p>"D'y'think you'll&mdash;get him, old f'low?"</p>

<p>"Well, d'ye see, it's his pistol-hand I'm after. By the way,
John, I'm hoping you'll act for me&mdash;my seconds, you and
Harry&mdash;make all the arrangements&mdash;will you, please?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly!" answered Sir John, sighing.</p>

<p>"Honoured, my dear, old lord!"</p>

<p>Breakfast done, my lord ascends to his sumptuous bed-chamber,
where with the aid of his valets he is prepared and attired for the
street, when a bowing footman appears to inform him that "a Mr.
Joliffe desires speech with him." So my lord in his splendour
presently greets the lawyer with a very Sam-like heartiness.</p>

<p>But Mr. Joliffe is in state of such indignant perturbation that
no sooner is the door closed than he exclaims:</p>

<p>"Sam&mdash;oh, Sam, he's free! My months of planning and
contriving are proved to-tally vain! Villainy triumphs! Your cousin
the Honourable&mdash;no, confound him&mdash;Lord Ralph
Scrope&mdash;is free!"</p>

<p>"Good!" nods my lord.</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;good? Good, d'ye say? But I'm telling you he is free,
and moreover&mdash;a rich man!"</p>

<p>"So ho!" says my lord, becoming Sam. "She's married him already
has she, bless her loveliness!"</p>

<p>"Eh? Married? She?" gasps Mr. Joliffe. "Then you know? You've
heard?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Ben, I only guess. For, d'ye see, I schemed for
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you schemed&mdash;?" Here, words failing him, Mr.
Joliffe snorted instead.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Ben, old fellow, compose yourself and tell me all
about it. Come, let's hear." And very indignantly Mr. Joliffe
obeys, saying:</p>

<p>"No sooner has this young Croft person become possessed of her
immense legacy and recovered from the shock of it, than with her
friend Mrs. Jennings, she hastens to London, outfits herself like a
princess, drives in state to the Marshalsea and having before-hand
paid your cousin's liabilities to the last farthing, frees the
prisoner, marries him by special licence, and is now back at the
Manor House, which is being renovated from cellarage to
attics&mdash;and all this your own doing by the bestowal of such
vast sum to an inconsequent, irresponsible, hare-brained
miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Ben, a very lovely, strong-souled woman who has acted
precisely as I wished and hoped she might."</p>

<p>"Wished?" repeated the lawyer, staring, "do you mean me to
infer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben, this was the best way I could think of&mdash;I
mean&mdash;how to share some portion of this dam' heritage with the
family. And Cecily Croft, God love her&mdash;was the means. So
all's well, for if anyone can ever make a good man out of a Scrope,
it is she. And therefore," says my lord, rising and crossing to the
sideboard where stood promising array of bottles, decanters and
glasses, "let us drink to her, this dear, faithful soul, may her
beauty be her husband's inspiration and he prove her abiding
happiness." When they have honoured this toast, my lord
enquires:</p>

<p>"Ben, does she guess&mdash;about this money, has she any
suspicions?"</p>

<p>"My dear Sam, of course! Being an astute young person, she
suspected it was your doing, at once&mdash;and was oddly unwilling
to receive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, I guessed she would be! And how then?"</p>

<p>"I was necessitated to argue and finally&mdash;almost to compel
her acceptance. And a fine time I had of it, for then she began to
weep, which profoundly upset me, then she laughed, and then did
both together, which perfectly dismayed me, then she told some
wild, quite fantastic story of how you had told her fortune. So
that when at last the business was settled and she gone&mdash;well,
I am a more confirmed bachelor than ever! And now, Sam, I'll quit
your lordship's noble mansion for my dingy office&mdash;though, as
a friend, permit me to remark your desperate gambling is a
by-word&mdash;Sir John is greatly perturbed, and I venture
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"However, Ben, I don't always lose, d'ye see. So never
worry&mdash;instead tell me of Cecily&mdash;you said she actually
brought Mrs. Jennings here to London with her, which surprises me,
considering&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure, Sam, there was something of a miracle, or so
says Anne Leet. She vows that, but for this girl, Mrs. Jennings
would certainly be in her grave...Eh? Twelve o'clock!" he exclaims,
as a clock chimes the hour. "And I've an appointment! Good-bye, my
lord, for the present, Sam."</p>

<p>Mr. Joliffe having departed, my lord takes the air with Mr.
Standish, who opines it will be a busy day. Reaching Whites, they
lounge, wine and exchange news with other "busy" gentlemen; they
saunter as far as Wattiers to yawn over the gazette; thence they
amble to Boodle's for a glass or so of a certain famous sherry;
they dine at Brooke's where my lord elects to gamble, which he does
for preposterously high stakes and with varying success until
supper-time. Thereafter, wearying of the cards and Mr. Standish
having departed long since, my lord calls for hat and cane, when he
is accosted by Major Topham who says, engagingly:</p>

<p>"Will your lordship be so very obleeging as to follow me?" My
lord does so and comes face to face with Sir Robert Chalmers, who
bows and smiles, at least he shows his large teeth, as he enquires
and quite pleasantly:</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord, pray what is this fantastic nonsense my friends
report to me concerning your choice of weapons for our little
affair?" And my lord, bowing in turn, answers as pleasantly:</p>

<p>"If your friends befool you, sir, I suggest you chide
'em&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, they talk of&mdash;of&mdash;cutlasses!" says Sir Robert,
spitting out the word as if it were something extremely nasty.</p>

<p>"Then they speak truly, Sir Robert, cutlasses are my
choice."</p>

<p>"Damnation, sir&mdash;these are no weapons for gentlemen! They
are irregular, they are utterly preposterous, and outrageous!"</p>

<p>"However, Sir Robert, permit me to assure you that one gentleman
may hack another gentleman very well indeed with such tools. Yes,
sir, properly used cutlasses are excellent for chopping, you'll
find&mdash;though should you prefer boarding-axes or even
pikes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, the devil! Here will be a very ridiculous exhibition. The
vulgar travesty of what is and should be a very solemn, gentlemanly
business! Suppose I refuse to accept such plebeian, such cursedly
boorish weapons?"</p>

<p>"In that event, Sir Robert, I shall take joy to publish you in
all the clubs as a cowardly braggart."</p>

<p>Sir Robert's small eyes open their widest to glare, his big
teeth snap, his hands clench to quivering fists; noting all of
which, my lord smiles provokingly and nods:</p>

<p>"Pray do&mdash;but this time I shall not merely&mdash;push you
down!"</p>

<p>Sir Robert's fury being now far beyond words, he says nothing,
he merely looks all he cannot utter, then turns and strides away,
gesturing like a madman.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch207" id="ch207"></a>CHAPTER VII. WHICH, HAVING
LITTLE TO TELL, IS ADMIRABLY BRIEF</h3>

<p>The rarefied atmosphere of Vanity Fair is vibrant with rumours
of the impending duel; whereby my lord's now assured popularity is
decidedly increased. The Sex is bewitchingly horrified; bright eyes
now languish more soulfully or contrive to dim their radiance with
anticipatory tears, more or less genuine; there are even signs that
angels, extremely feminine of gender, would fain comfort his few
remaining hours.</p>

<p>In club and coffee-house he is greeted more warmly, his hand
clutched in heartier grip, voices hail him more jovially&mdash;and
thus, wherever he goes, my lord becomes aware that he is regarded
as a dying man whose hours are numbered to the precise moment, a
victim foredoomed to certain death.</p>

<p>Wagers of course are freely laid upon his chances of survival,
which are esteemed so poor that certain gallant sportsmen are bold
enough to offer heavy odds that he "will be snuffed out at the
first exchanges."</p>

<p>Yet my lord goes his way apparently serene as ever, his smile as
ready and laugh as hearty as usual&mdash;no Sam-like frown is ever
seen to furrow his well-marked, low-set brows&mdash;until a certain
afternoon...He lies drowsing in shady corner at Brooke's, remote
from the throng, when his sleepy ears are assailed by a
high-pitched voice, arrogant, assured, uttering these words:</p>

<p>"Wrybourne's a goner, of course&mdash;good as dead already!"</p>

<p>"Agreed, Denby," says a second voice, "but no need to proclaim
the fact, dem bad form, I call it!"</p>

<p>"Bad form or not, Hewitt, that's my belief and I'm backing it at
ten to one! Who'll take me? What, none o' you? Then b'God, I'll
make it fifteen, d'ye hear? Fifteen to one I'm offering against the
earl lasting five minutes! What, still no one?"</p>

<p>"Ya-as," drawls a new voice, "I take y', Denby."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, it's you, Standish. Well, what'll you lay
me&mdash;fives?"</p>

<p>"No, tens."</p>

<p>"Oho, you're dev'lish bold! Will you venture to make it
twenties?"</p>

<p>"No, 's make it hundreds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;what&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Layin' y' a hundred at twenty t'one, Denby. Are y'on?" Here
ensues an excited babblement:</p>

<p>"Well, how about it, Denby?"</p>

<p>"Aha, Denby, won't you take him?"</p>

<p>"Are you backing down now, Denby?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;not!" shrills Mr. Denby. "I'll book him at the
figure&mdash;or any other man. But as for you, Standish, come
again&mdash;make it two hundred."</p>

<p>"No, Denby, let's say five&mdash;a monkey. Though per'f'kly
willing t' make it a thousand, y'know&mdash;"</p>

<p>This bold challenge causes an uproar&mdash;and it is now that my
lord's dark brows knit in a Sam-like scowl.</p>

<p>"That's got you, Denby!"</p>

<p>"Aha, that's a leveller!"</p>

<p>"One right in the wind, eh, Denby?"</p>

<p>"What's the word, Denby?"</p>

<p>"If," says Mr. Standish, "if y' want any more shall be dooced
glad t'oblige, y'know."</p>

<p>"No, demme, I'm satisfied..."</p>

<p>My lord being now extremely wide awake, consults his watch,
rises without noise and as silently steals away, for this is the
afternoon he is to visit Her Grace of Camberhurst.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch208" id="ch208"></a>CHAPTER VIII. TELLS HOW MY LORD
MET TEMPTATION</h3>

<p>Thus the clocks are proclaiming the hour of four when my lord
entering the ducal portals, is relieved of hat, cane and gloves,
and ushered into that same small, cosy chamber where, as once
before, he is to drink tea with the Duchess; just at present he
finds it is vacant wherefore he crosses to the window and stands
there gazing out, so lost in thought that he is unaware the door
behind him has opened, so does not move until a soft voice
says:</p>

<p>"My lord!" Then, starting violently, he swings round and stands
motionless and dumb.</p>

<p>For instead of the little Duchess he beholds a lady graciously
tall, whose raven hair parted on white brow, falls in glossy
ringlets to frame the proud, high beauty of her face; her silken
robe, high-bosomed, clings her loveliness, revealing such shape as
the first Andromeda showed the happy Perseus who beholding thus
beauty's perfection, had no eyes (of course) for the grimly,
snake-locked Medusas, sea-monsters or anything else.</p>

<p>So here before my lord is beauty far more wonderful than Sam had
ever dreamed, a glowing, dainty thing of loveliness looking at him
with the golden eyes of gipsy drudge, woodland dryad and&mdash;the
one woman.</p>

<p>"An-dromeda!" he breathes at least and makes a step towards her,
then halts, awed by the sheer wonder of her.</p>

<p>"Sam!" she murmurs, reaching out both hands to him...Then he has
her in his arms and, trying to speak, is dumb now for very joy. So
he kisses her instead&mdash;lustrous, silky hair, these fragrant,
midnight tresses, long-lashed eyes and vivid mouth that with an
equal passion, meet and return his caress.</p>

<p>Now leaning back within the fervour of his embrace, she looks up
at him, saying tremulously:</p>

<p>"Oh, my beloved...you are...marvellously...wonderfully
changed!"</p>

<p>"Only outwardly," he answers, "for I'm still truly&mdash;only
Sam, a common sort o' fellow, but...all yours if you'll only take
him...and here am I crushing your dainty finery in such brutal
hug&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;crush it!" she whispers, clinging to him. "For...oh
Sam, if you are mine, I am all yours, as I always have been and
must be. Life is an empty dreariness...and I am lost without
you&mdash;ah yes," she murmurs, seeing where he looks, "your
keepsake, the cross and heart and anchor, I wear it always upon my
heart and it shall never leave me so long as you are my Sam!" and
she lays slim finger on the small gold chain that gleams about her
round white throat; so he kisses finger, chain and throat,
whispering:</p>

<p>"Oh, Andromeda...beloved, are you here to give yourself to me at
last&mdash;my wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, beloved man, I am here for your taking&mdash;soon, oh,
soon! You can marry me by special licence and take me away anywhere
you will&mdash;away from this hateful London."</p>

<p>"But, your uncle?"</p>

<p>"He is here with my godmother and will remain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Godmother?"</p>

<p>"The Duchess, yes&mdash;so if you want me as I need you, it must
be soon, my dearest, very soon." Now as she utters these words his
arms relax, wherefore she hides her face against his breast and
clings him the tighter.</p>

<p>"Andromeda," he demands, kissing her hair again, "then you have
heard, you know I am to fight?"</p>

<p>Without lifting head she nods "yes."</p>

<p>"And you have come," he demands, "to cheer and strengthen me for
it with your love?"</p>

<p>Now at this, she shakes her head, saying:</p>

<p>"No, I have come to shield you with my love&mdash;to stand
between you and death!" Here she looks up at him wide-eyed, "I am
here to command you&mdash;beg and entreat you not to throw away
your life, our happiness, and my love&mdash;wasting them all to
such foolish, wicked purpose and so needlessly! Oh, Sam, my own
dear, you shall not, must not."</p>

<p>"Now Lord love me!" he groans, "you should know me better than
to ask of me such thing as this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do ask it, I must&mdash;I must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" he gasps. "Ah&mdash;don't!" His arms fall from her and
she, as if bereft of strength, sinks to her knees before him.</p>

<p>"Oh, my beloved," she sighs, looking up at him above clasped
hands, "here at your feet I do now implore you not to peril your
life and our future&mdash;all the wonder that may be for
us...because, if you are killed I think I shall die too...it is for
you to choose. Think, dearest, think, I might...be so blessed
to...give...an heir to your name...Oh, Sam, how can there be any
choice&mdash;what, what is it you would die for?"</p>

<p>"Now God help me!" he groans, lifting clenched hands to his
temples. "Why, why in God's name must you be so sure I shall be
killed&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Because the Duchess is so dreadfully certain&mdash;and tells me
that everyone&mdash;yes everyone believes the same. So now again,
for the last time, I beg&mdash;entreat you to live for me
and&mdash;our future&mdash;instead of dying for this&mdash;this
code of honour which has nothing to do with honour that is real and
true. Be brave enough to refuse this duel and if you are branded
craven, wear the stigma like a glory, for my sake."</p>

<p>"Ay, so I would, for I care nothing for the opinion of these
grand folk&mdash;and I fight for no dam'-fool code of honour, d'ye
see, but to make it impossible for a fine gentleman to kill or maim
any other fine gentleman ever again, more especially a certain one.
So, Andromeda, don't tempt me with your beauty&mdash;to run away
and shield myself in your arms. Could you love me if I did? If so,
then such love would shame us both. Ay, by God, I would rather die
loving you as I do now with honour, than, taking all you offer,
live to despise the beauty that made me despise myself. So now,
Andromeda, 'stead o' weeping, be furious and glare those golden
eyes at me&mdash;reproach and berate me and I will be my
lordliest&mdash;like this: Madam, my hand&mdash;suffer that I aid
you to rise&mdash;" But this she does unaided and avoiding his
touch.</p>

<p>"Yes," says she, viewing him through tears that do not fall,
"yes, I have indeed shamed myself bitterly...for your sake, and
this I shall not forgive. Deeply and truly as I loved my rough
seaman, my simple, clean-hearted Sam, just so truly do I hate and
despise this selfish wretch called lord and Earl of Wrybourne...To
Sam I would have given myself utterly, sharing his poverty
joyfully&mdash;to my lord of Wrybourne I say&mdash;go, fight your
vile duels, shed your foolish blood, waste your precious life so
vainly if you will, but expect no tear from me! A man who will die
for such useless folly is not worth any woman's grief! Yes, my
lord, when you go to fight this duel, I shall abominate your
lordship because&mdash;you take my beloved Sam with you."</p>

<p>"Madam," says my lord, with elaborate bow, "through the lips of
my so detested lordship, your ever-loving Sam speaks you his
sincere gratitude and undying hope of you. And now, dearest madam,
my lordship humbly begs leave to say that though you now show in
your splendour, beauteous as Venus glorified by the golden eyes of
Andromeda of the sorry cotton hose and clumsy boots, you talk like
very peevish, excessively petulant miss! And so, madam, pray give
me leave to bid you a very fair good afternoon!" Then my lord turns
and leaves her...</p>

<p>And now indeed her tears fall at last, hot and painful, tears of
yearning for this her chosen man and he so wishful to die and be
done with her.</p>

<p>So Andromeda sinks to her knees sobbing a prayer, and then to
her face and thus outstretched abandoned to her grief, weeps more
bitterly than she has ever done in all her not-too-happy life.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch209" id="ch209"></a>CHAPTER IX. TELLS OF BARE FLESH
AND COLD STEEL</h3>

<p>It is a fine autumnal morning when in pleasant rural
surroundings remote from chance of interruption, two gentlemen
accompanied by their friends, reasoning creatures all,
meet&mdash;with the avowed and sole intention of maiming or killing
one another as expeditiously and, of course, politely as
possibly.</p>

<p>Hats flourish and backs bend in gracious salutation, grave
voices murmur, solemn eyes take heed to the angle of a new-risen
sun this giver of life, to the evenness of ground and smoothness of
turf destined to be enriched anon by something other than rain.</p>

<p>Sir John is here, placid and stately as usual, with Mr. Standish
a trifle paler than wont, yet bearing himself with a confident air
that is almost jaunty. Major Topham is here, very stiff as to back
and whiskers; Viscount Twily is here, smiling and sardonic; here
also the two surgeons standing together in muttered confab.</p>

<p>And here of course are the two protagonists&mdash;my lord
apparently lost in thoughtful contemplation of a skylark carolling
joyously above them and thus perfectly oblivious of Sir Robert
Chalmers' persistent, lowering stare, until Mr. Standish draws his
attention thereto, saying low-voiced:</p>

<p>"Remark our Sir Bob, his demd fighting-face, his fee-fi-fo-fummy
expression! That's 'nother trick of his&mdash;t'stare his man out
o' countenance t'shake his nerve."</p>

<p>Made thus aware of his antagonist's lowering scrutiny, my lord
nods airily, draws out his handkerchief and enquires:</p>

<p>"Eh, a smut, Sir Robert? On my nose&mdash;my chin? Be good
enough to tell me which or where."</p>

<p>Sir Robert mutters fierce incoherencies and turns his back,
whereat Mr. Standish nods derisively and murmurs:</p>

<p>"First blood t'you, my dear, old lord!"</p>

<p>But now the Major approaches to say:</p>

<p>"M'lord, as this is to be the cold steel, it is proper and
usual, also my principal demands you fight bare-chested. Is this
agreed?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answers my lord and begins to cast off surtout and
close-fitting coat, in which business he is assisted by Mr.
Standish.</p>

<p>Thus presently bare of arm and breast the two adversaries front
each other...Viscount Twily now advances to present their
weapons&mdash;my lord bows to Sir Robert, who takes the nearest,
swings the broad, curved blade with practised hand, cursing its
weight and clumsiness, while my lord stands with point to ground,
waiting.</p>

<p>"My lord," says the Viscount, backing away, "pray remember, Sir
Robert demands this shall be without stay or respite&mdash;to the
death!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," booms the Major, "are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" hisses Sir Robert between those big teeth of his that
seem crueler than ever&mdash;my lord merely nods.</p>

<p>"Then, engage&mdash;go!" The keen blades flicker in swift action
to meet with ringing clash, and for a moment they remain thus
crossed, then&mdash;with fierce "Ha!" and stamp of foot Sir Robert,
swiftly disengaging, thrusts straight at his antagonist's throat,
his deadly point glitters dreadfully near, is beaten
aside&mdash;and he leaps back from the counter-stroke.</p>

<p>Mr. Standish, gasping relief, takes off his hat, looks at it and
puts it on again; Sir John, keen eyes intent upon this murderous
steel, fumbles unsuccessfully for his snuff-box and frowns, while
this combat rages with ever-growing fury.</p>

<p>Sir Robert, well-used to the more delicate small-sword, relies
chiefly upon the point, but my lord, expectant of this, watches
this swift-leaping point, meets and parries its every darting
thrust, and waits for the full-armed lunge that will give him the
opening for the stroke which shall end this murderous
business...</p>

<p>And now while the spectators scarcely breathe, is close,
desperate flurry of cut and thrust, point and edge, the broad
blades clashing in fierce attack and violent parry, whirling in
glittering arcs or flashing in lightning thrust...</p>

<p>Mr. Standish has doffed his hat again and clasps it to his
bosom; Sir John has found his snuff-box but forgotten to open it.
For as this relentless combat progresses it becomes ever more
terribly apparent that Sir Robert indeed means to kill...Time and
again his vicious thrusts are turned only just in time&mdash;quick
of hand he is also swift of foot, avoiding counter-blow and thrust
as much by agility of body as skill of blade, while my lord,
keen-eyed and watchful, stands his ground&mdash;waiting.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;demme!" murmurs Mr. Standish, donning his hat only to
take it off again. "This can't last, y'know! Can't possibly!
'Tisn't human&mdash;never saw such dooced endurance...ha, look at
Chalmers, there's animus...hate and bloody murder! There&mdash;and
there again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" says Sir John, fingers clenching his forgotten
snuff-box. "The end will be...sudden and...soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh God, John...Oh God...look at Sam, he's
failing...ah&mdash;blood!"</p>

<p>"I see, Harry! Yes, Chalmers means death."</p>

<p>Ceaseless ring and clash of ever-whirling steel, stamp and
shuffle of feet...Thus, hand-to-hand, foot-to-foot, and eye-to-eye,
they strike, parry, and thrust at each other's lives, circle and
sway&mdash;Sir Robert, sweat-streaked, fiercely relentless as
ever&mdash;my lord grim and steadfast. Both now are breathing hard,
both seem tiring at last&mdash;and upon my lord's sweat-glistening
sword-arm is trickle of blood...</p>

<p>Mr. Standish stifles a groan, crushes his hat shapeless, lets it
fall, and holds his breath in horrified dismay. For my lord's blade
seems to waver, he shifts his ground awkwardly&mdash;then reels
back with Sir Robert's weapon driven through his arm&mdash;but this
arm is his left and, recovering balance, he laughs grimly, his own
blade whirls, flashes down in the stroke for which he has
watched&mdash;and Sir Robert, losing his weapon, stumbles backward
and is caught in the Major's embrace while my lord stands looking
down at the dangling steel transfixing him.</p>

<p>Then Sir John drops the crushed fragments of his snuff-box and
with Mr. Standish hastens to support him, while the surgeon
proceeds to withdraw the clumsy blade from my lord's ugly wound, at
which Mr. Standish winces as if this arm had been his own,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh dooce and the devil...my dear old f'low...how the devil are
you?"</p>

<p>"Better than I look," answers my lord rather breathlessly and
between pallid lips. "But, Harry&mdash;his pistol hand&mdash;tell
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"M'dear old lord, no need t'tell you&mdash;look yonder!"</p>

<p>Now glancing whither he is directed, my lord beholds, lying upon
smeared grass, that which will never more grasp murderous duelling
weapon.</p>

<p>"Lord!" murmurs Sam, between lips even paler now. "Ned...tells
me I always strike...harder than necessary&mdash;"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch210" id="ch210"></a>CHAPTER X. TELLS HOW MY LORD
LANGUISHED, DESPAIRED AND PLEADED IN VAIN</h3>

<p>The duel and its unexpected ending sets the crowning glory on my
lord's popularity, and he is now famous. He is also a scowling,
gloomy misery. Cards and flowers pour in upon him, visitors of both
sexes, old and young, call to do homage, but are received with
gracious urbanity by Sir John who, pleading my lord's wound, fills
his place with a charm that tempers disappointment at my lord's
non-appearance;&mdash;so they enquire the more tenderly after his
health, commiserate his hurt, glorify his success, and depart,
feeling themselves more his friends than ever...While my lord,
having shut himself away with his wound, his pipe, a few books, and
his broken hopes, becomes ever the more dejected.</p>

<p>Thus daily he languishes&mdash;for this fighting seaman whose
precept has been "no surrender and never say die," now does both.
Weakened by his bodily hurt, he despairs at last and sinks to such
deeps of woeful, hopeless despondency from which Mr. Standish
strives to rouse him and so vainly that both he and Sir John
becoming daily more anxious, summon the most eminent
doctors&mdash;surgeons and physicians (to my lord's
disgust)&mdash;even nurses are threatened (to my lord's indignant
horror) for no one, not even his devoted Harry, suspects that it is
not so much bodily wound troubling him as a bewitching affliction
called&mdash;Andromeda...until:</p>

<p>Upon a certain morning, my lord having cursed his two valets out
and away, Mr. Standish finds him doing his one-armed best to clothe
himself.</p>

<p>"Goo' Lord!" exclaims that gentleman, aghast, "m'dear old tulip,
no, no, naughty-naughty! Y' ought ta be in bed, y'know!"</p>

<p>"Not me!" snarls my lord, becoming Sam at his worst. "No, damme,
I've had enough o' this cosseting and cursed inaction&mdash;I'm
off!"</p>

<p>"Eh, off? Off where? What for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter! Bear a hand wi' this dam' shirt."</p>

<p>Mr. Standish, alarmed by something wild in my lord's looks and
tone, becomes extremely articulate and quite determined as Sam
himself, as he says:</p>

<p>"No, dear fellow! Your place at present, is bed&mdash;and it's
not the least good your cursing me, for back to bed you're
going&mdash;and at once!"</p>

<p>"Well, damn your eyes!" growls Sam, actually clenching his one
good fist. "D'ye think you or any other man could stay me or keep
me from her?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaims Mr. Standish, recoiling as if indeed from a
physical blow. "Then...yes, that's it&mdash;you're in love
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, what else! Come, bear a hand with my shirt."</p>

<p>"I ought," says Mr. Standish, swallowing with difficulty, "ought
to have guessed. Yes...of course...it was only to be expected! You
have not&mdash;" here another difficult swallow, "told her yet,
naturally?"</p>

<p>"What of?"</p>

<p>"Your...love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, that I have."</p>

<p>"Oh? A trifle hasty, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Well," says Sam, pondering, "yes, come to think of it, I
was."</p>

<p>"And does she," again Mr. Standish gulps, "does she...return
your sentiments?"</p>

<p>"If you mean my love, Harry, yes&mdash;yes, I believe she does,
and this is my one comfort."</p>

<p>"And I wish," sighs Mr. Standish, "you were cured of your wound
because then I should express to you&mdash;my sentiments."</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmurs Sam, pondering this. "Ah? Harry, what d'ye
mean?"</p>

<p>"That were you a sound man, Wrybourne, I should express myself
rather forcibly&mdash;as it is I merely suggest it would have been
fairer to me and more honourable in you to have warned me
first."</p>

<p>"Warned you? Damme&mdash;what about?"</p>

<p>"Your love for Rowena."</p>

<p>"Oho!" exclaims Sam. "My poor, old Harry-fool!" And for the
first time since his scene with Andromeda he laughs, while Mr.
Standish, pale and stern, watches him. "B'George!" he exclaims, his
merriment subsiding. "That's done me a power o' good! So now for
your good, Harry, I tell you my love instead of gold is black as
midnight, her eyes a golden glory, herself the only woman for me in
all this world. Sit down, my hearty, and let me tell you..."</p>

<p>And thus, with many other particulars, Mr. Standish, this
faithful, trusty friend, learns the wherefore of my lord's disease
that has perplexed everyone.</p>

<p>"So d'ye see, Harry," he ends mournfully, "she's braced about,
borne away and left me in the dam' doldrums, no&mdash;worse, a
dismasted hulk, helpless, waterlogged and rolling gunn'le under for
the final, everlasting plunge!"</p>

<p>"Nothin' o' the sort, m'dear, old f'low&mdash;no! All that's
needed is judgment and manage. First, did your lady toss your
engagement ring back at you&mdash;with scorn and so forth?"</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only because she never had one to toss."</p>

<p>"Ha! And she's stayin' wi' th' Duchess?"</p>

<p>"She was."</p>

<p>"And the Duchess is her godmother you tell me? Well, she thinks
no end o' you, th' Duchess, fact! Called three times t'
enquire&mdash;pity you refused t'see her."</p>

<p>"Yes, Harry, I was a curst fool! But I felt such a poor,
miserable, sick dog&mdash;I couldn't bear anyone near me."</p>

<p>"No wonder! You'd lost gallons o' gore&mdash;artery or something
'cording to the surgeon. And egad, Sam, I thought Chalmers had
skewered more than your arm&mdash;frightful minute for me, old
f'low! How the dooce did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Chalmers was so clever, Harry, I had to give him an opening to
get in the blow I wanted&mdash;ay, he certainly could fight!"</p>

<p>"But never again, m'dear, old lord, unless he's ambidextrous,
for the hand that shot me&mdash;and others, is now
rotti&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now," says Sam, rather gruffly, "I'll thank you to help me
into my clothes, Harry."</p>

<p>"Cer-tainly not, old f'low&mdash;you're not fit&mdash;lot weaker
than you think, loss o' blood and so forth, y'know."</p>

<p>"But damme, I must see the Duchess."</p>

<p>"So you shall, by proxy. I'll see her for you, give her any
message and, better still, a letter to your Andromeda, a few
heart-felt words&mdash;if you can manage to write&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course! Bring me the pen and ink, Harry."</p>

<p>Thus, with writing materials before him, Sam (and despite the
weakness that surprised and angered him) contrives to scrawl, very
shakily, these words:</p>

<blockquote>EVER BELOVED, I am not dead, but it is for you to bless
me with the very joy of life, if only you will. So if you will,
pray come to me. However I am now and always&mdash;only your
SAM.</blockquote>

<p>Folding this missive he superscribed it</p>

<blockquote>To THE ONE.</blockquote>

<p>Then Mr. Standish seals it carefully, thrusts it tenderly into
the bosom of his coat and turns to go, saying gaily:</p>

<p>"Have patience, old f'low, don't work y'self into another dooced
fever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Into her hand only, Harry!"</p>

<p>"None other, old lord&mdash;I'm an off 'un!" And off he speeds
accordingly. Scarcely has he gone than my lord, buoyed up by hope,
summons his valets and makes an elaborate toilette, tries vainly to
get himself inducted into his newest, tightest coat, is folded into
loose dressing-robe instead, and sits down to await the outcome of
his written appeal. Hoping against hope, yearning for sound and
sight of her...to see the door open and Andromeda standing with
arms reached out to him...He ponders just what his first words
shall be, how he will greet her&mdash;he even selects the chair
that shall be so blessed as to support and embrace her
loveliness...</p>

<p>Thus he frets and fumes, alternating between radiant hope and
black despair until the door indeed opens at last to
admit&mdash;only Mr. Standish, his gaiety somewhat dashed, but
saying, cheerfully as possible:</p>

<p>"No luck, old f'low!" And he gives back the letter, and Sam,
seeing the seal unbroken, crams it fiercely into his pocket,
demanding:</p>

<p>"Was she out?"</p>

<p>"Well," answers Mr. Standish as if considering this question,
"no&mdash;not exactly."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;then she saw you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Yes, certainly&mdash;she saw me."</p>

<p>"And you gave her my&mdash;my dam' letter?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;not precisely."</p>

<p>"Harry, what the devil d'you mean?"</p>

<p>"I handed it to her, old fellow, at least I&mdash;held it out to
her, but she...didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! She refused even to touch it, eh, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam."</p>

<p>"Did she&mdash;say anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, something that I didn't and don't understand&mdash;dooced
perplexing, y'know, Sam, can't make head or tail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, out with it, man&mdash;her very words."</p>

<p>"When I proffered your letter she merely smiled at it, shook her
head at it and said, 'No, sir, you have brought Lord Wrybourne's
billet-doux to the wrong person'."</p>

<p>"Eh, wrong person? Did you ask what she meant?"</p>

<p>"I did, but she merely smiled and left me."</p>

<p>"So, Harry, that ends it!"</p>

<p>"No, old fellow, this begins it! We now attack her with flowers.
Nothing like flowers, old boy, t' touch the feminine heart, blooms
and blossoms&mdash;properly applied, y'know. So I'll away and begin
our flowery campaign&mdash;violets t' begin with or lilies o' the
valley, suggestin' a sweetly tender humility! So cheer up, old
f'low. I'll set about it at once." And off he speeds again, but
very soon reappears, to say in awed tone and with looks of
consternation: "Sam, oh, Sam&mdash;the Juggernaut's below with Sir
John, demanding speech with you. So, dear, old lord&mdash;will you,
for my sake&mdash;the elopement business&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>Sam scowls but unwillingly and perforce agrees&mdash;whereupon
his faithful Harry murmurs gratefully and hastens away on his
self-imposed mission.</p>

<p>Thus presently my lord rises as Lady Marwood is ushered in by
Sir John who, after a few perfunctory remarks, bows himself out
again.</p>

<p>Lady Marwood surveys this hoped-for son-in-law, her eyes large
with yearning, and strikes an attitude:</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;he is pale!" sighs she, as to an invisible audience.
"Pale yet so romantically pallid! Ah, Japhet, thou art our hero,
our conqueror triumphant! Thou art indeed the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, madam, pray be seated," says my lord bowing, and reaches
for a chair wherefore my lady emits a tender scream:</p>

<p>"No! Ah&mdash;no! Thine arm&mdash;thy wound that badge of
glory&mdash;trouble it not. See, unaided&mdash;I sit! Come you
beside me, dear, heroical boy. Ah, what maternal bosom but would
swell with pride for such son? What gentle, sweet-shy feminine
heart could resist you? Surely not mine nor the heart of my beloved
Rowena&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My lady, you overwhelm me!"</p>

<p>"Dear Japhet, if I do, 'tis with a mother's devotion&mdash;for
doth not my sweet child adore you&mdash;her hero? Thus when I
surprised the secret of your proposed elopement I kept the secret
locked within my bosom, even from my own child&mdash;for the sweet
romance of it all&mdash;to fly together&mdash;upon speedy
wheels&mdash;at midnight's hour&mdash;Oh, very ecstasy! Ah, but, I
have to warn you, there is a&mdash;hitch! And all owing to the
Duchess! For her Grace has sent us such pressing, such very urgent
invitation, indeed she is so persistent that I cannot possibly
refuse. So that, dear boy, on the night appointed for your
elopement Rowena and I shall be domiciled with the Duchess."</p>

<p>"I see!" murmurs my lord. "We must alter our arrangements
somewhat."</p>

<p>"Precisely! Ah, dear Japhet, could you but enlist her Grace's
aid&mdash;you are already high in her esteem&mdash;with her to
assist you, all would be well."</p>

<p>"Yes," nods my lord, "it would be mere plain sailing then. I'll
try it."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you will succeed! Yes, you will bear from me my
olive branch, my one beloved child&mdash;you and she to rapture!
Ah, but my lonesome pillow will be moist with a mother's
tears&mdash;tears of woe for my loneliness, but of joy for her and
your happiness!"</p>

<p>My Lady Marwood's large, soulful eyes are indeed moist with
tears, real or so well simulated that my lord feels a twinge of
something very like remorse when at last he bows her out and
away.</p>

<p>Being alone he remembers his useless letter to Andromeda and
intending to destroy it, thrusts hand into the pocket of his
dressing-robe and finds there his handkerchief and nothing
more&mdash;begins a languid search for it, wearies and thinking of
Andromeda, forgets all about it...</p>

<p>It is about now that Mr. Standish, this indefatigable friend,
having no better fortune with flowers, yet indomitable as ever,
demands word with the Duchess herself in my lord's name, is
admitted to her dominating presence and there pleads his lordship's
woeful plight to such effect that this small, potent lady knits her
brow and gazes wide-eyed on vacancy, like a musing Sibyl, nods her
arrogant head like chiefest of the remorseless Fates, giggles
suddenly, like a schoolgirl, and beckoning Mr. Standish near,
bestows such counsel that he giggles also&mdash;and returns
jubilant to find my lord sunk in a gloom deeper than ever.</p>

<p>"Well, Harry?" his lordship demands, hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Ex-ceeding well!" nods Mr. Standish, at his jauntiest. "The
Duchess and I have arranged it all! Three nights hence you will
elope&mdash;but from&mdash;her Grace's house!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I know that!" growls Sam. "But&mdash;what o' me
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You, m'dear f'low, will drive away&mdash;not in your own but in
one of her Grace's carriages and with four relays o' horses on the
road. You should arrive at th' chiefest inn at Wrybourne in time
for breakfast...And there you will find happiness."</p>

<p>"Is there such a thing?" groans Sam. "But what the
devil&mdash;why all this confounded mystery, this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"M'dear, old lord, no mystery, no! At eleven precisely, three
nights hence, you step into her Grace's carriage and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why hers? What the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all I can tell you. Now curse me if y' feel so inclined
but&mdash;ha, thank heaven, there's the supper bell! C'on old
f'low, let's peck and sip&mdash;do us both good&mdash;"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch211" id="ch211"></a>CHAPTER XI. HOW THEY
FARED&mdash;HOMEWARDS</h3>

<p>Rain, and a wind that raves in angry gusts, the clocks chiming
eleven&mdash;and my lord, guided by Mr. Standish, reaches the
shelter of a dim seen gateway, hears a sound of hoofs and wheels,
sees in the rain-lashed darkness the loom of a carriage that stops
and is helped up into its black interior; then the door slams,
hoofs clatter, wheels grind and away rumbles this vehicle.</p>

<p>My lord has not travelled very far when he raises his voice
above rumble and clatter and hiss of wind-driven rain, to
say&mdash;far more pleasantly than he feels:</p>

<p>"Well, Rowena, we're off! But&mdash;what a night for us! How are
you feeling?" But instead of the sweet voice expected, all he hears
is rumble and clatter and rush of wind.</p>

<p>Surprised and startled, he tries again:</p>

<p>"Rowena, you're here, of course&mdash;but where are you?" Still
nothing to hear save the rumble and rush of their going. So my lord
reaches out his one serviceable hand...touches velvet, feels
beneath this a firm, round arm that snatches itself from his
contact.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he exclaims. "Surely you're not&mdash;afraid of me,
Rowena?"</p>

<p>"No!" answers a voice, richly sweet though bitterly scornful.
"Oh no, she would probably be in your arms&mdash;but I would rather
be lying out in the mud and rain!"</p>

<p>"Well...now...damme!" gasps Sam, hardly believing his ears.
"What the&mdash;how&mdash;Andromeda! What in the world are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"It seems your lordship has entered the wrong carriage!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, madam, no!" says my lord, "it is only too perfectly
evident that you are kidnapping me."</p>

<p>"Lord Wrybourne, bid your coachman turn and drive me back at
once, or you will compel me to&mdash;to scream."</p>

<p>"Madam, you would merely waste your precious breath, for my
coachmen never heed women's screams, indeed they usually drive
faster. So, instead, pray inform me what astounding and happy
chance brings you within reach of my arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never dare to touch me again!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I must&mdash;yes, my lady, you shall lie&mdash;cradled
upon my bosom, unless you explain how and why you are here."</p>

<p>"Because of your lying message."</p>

<p>"But I sent you no message, and my letter you
refused&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet I received your deceitful note&mdash;here it is."</p>

<p>"May I have it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pray take the loathsome thing!" In the darkness this paper
is given and taken by fingers that shrink from each other's
touch.</p>

<p>"And now, madam," says my lord, slipping this into his pocket,
"since it is too dark for reading, pray tell me what is
written&mdash;the words of this message."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," sighs she, wearily, "you know all its cruel
falsity."</p>

<p>"However, madam, I beg you'll tell me&mdash;or know the hideous
shame of my embrace."</p>

<p>"Anything rather than&mdash;that!" she retorts. "This deceitful
note, so far as I recall, says: 'If you would see him in life and
before the end, go at once to Mrs. Leet's cottage at
Wrybourne'."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaims my lord. "So at once you set out&mdash;and in
this storm! I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"Because I believed he was my clean, pure-hearted
Sam&mdash;instead of this&mdash;this false, hateful profligate and
brutal duellist, Lord Wrybourne."</p>

<p>"Madam, now you astonish me! For here are you even now,
kidnapping this same unfortunate, misunderstood gentleman, who
fondly imagined he was eloping with a lady beautiful as
yourself&mdash;though her silky tresses are a glorious gold instead
of&mdash;merely black."</p>

<p>"Oh, how incredibly vile to so parade her shame and your own! I
beg you will say no more&mdash;for her wretched sake."</p>

<p>"So be it, madam. Though 'pon my soul, I'm greatly wondering
where she can have got to. I should be carrying her south and
indeed thought I was. Why aren't I? Where is she? There's something
vastly wrong somewhere. The question is&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord, the question is&mdash;why! Why are you not upon
your death-bed in Mrs. Leet's cottage?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lady! Are you reproaching, blaming me for daring to be
alive to retort upon you instead of lying dead, a poor object for
your gracious pity and all-too-late endearments?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord, I blame myself for believing there ever was a
Sam."</p>

<p>"Then, madam, is my so detested, libertine lordship to
understand that you truly loved this Sam fellow?"</p>

<p>"God knows I did."</p>

<p>"Then why in God's name, did you make a football of his poor
simple heart? How could you let him go out to fight for his life
with scorn in your eyes, upon your lips, and anger in your heart?
Madam, I await your answer." Instead, she turns on him to demand,
breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Oh...how dare you...affront me with such questions? You...whose
name is the subject of such infamous gossip...duellist, gambler,
base seducer&mdash;how dare you speak to, much less question me?
Drive back, my lord, drive back, and in my place take up that poor,
frail creature you expected, this miserable girl who is so unwise
ever to trust herself to such as you! Go back and if in you is one
spark of honour&mdash;cloak her shame with marriage."</p>

<p>For some while after this wild tirade, no word is uttered; even
after cobbled streets have given place to the open road and their
going smoother and less noisy, my lord remains speechless.</p>

<p>And so, once again, out of the darkness nearby this fiercely
scornful voice lashed him:</p>

<p>"Do I then plead your wanton's cause in vain? Why do you not
return and take her to your arms? Is it because your lordship is
already wearied, sated, and seek newer prey? Well, here am
I&mdash;alone and at your mercy, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, you are certainly alone, but alas&mdash;I have only
one arm to serve me. Wherefore you may know yourself, for the time
at least, safe from my brutality. But, my lady, being now in the
dark and unable to feast my wicked eyes on your enticing beauty, I
can the better appreciate and realize the acid venom of your
tongue, the hidden cruelty of you that, perched upon your pinnacle
of chastity, can so condemn and vilify your sister woman. Ah, the
Lord protect me, ay, and especially all unfortunate she creatures,
from the merciless rage of a virtuous woman!"</p>

<p>"While your lordship takes breath, may I suggest once more that
you turn back and exchange me for your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say 'wanton' again!"</p>

<p>"Sir, I shall say precisely as I will...but now, because," here
her voice falters, "because of what I once...believed you to be...I
beg you will order the carriage to turn back or...suffer me to
alight."</p>

<p>"A light?" he repeats. "Happy thought!" And fumbling in the
darkness he finds the check-string at last, pulls it and the
carriage jolts to a halt. Then the door opens on wind-swept
blackness and a voice enquires:</p>

<p>"Yes, m'lord?"</p>

<p>"Why are we driving without lights?"</p>

<p>"Wind do blow 'em out, sir."</p>

<p>"Have we no lamp in the carriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'lord."</p>

<p>"Then light it."</p>

<p>"I be reekin' wet, m'lord."</p>

<p>"No matter&mdash;light it." In comes a rain-scattering shape
and, after some to-do, the lamp is lit and seems quite dazzling.
"How far to the first stage?"</p>

<p>"Matter o' five mile, m'lord."</p>

<p>"Then lock both doors!"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'lord!"</p>

<p>Now as they drive on again, the flickering light showing that
beloved face and form, my lord keeps his eyes averted as he
says:</p>

<p>"Madam, as I have been compelled to hear your reproaches, you
shall now hear me&mdash;are you listening?" he demands, for she has
turned, hiding her face in the deep shade of her bonnet.</p>

<p>"Yes, since I must! But why weary me and shame yourself with
more lies?"</p>

<p>"Ah, what venom!" sighs my lord. "Should you ever wed, your
spouse is to be pitied. However, you with poisonous tongue have
defamed a sweet and lovely lady, called her wanton, not that you
know this for truth but merely because of rumour that I love
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you&mdash;dare you deny it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I can&mdash;and do!"</p>

<p>"Oh, insufferable! I tell you Lady Marwood boasts how you love
her daughter, Rowena herself admits it! And tonight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tonight, madam, I should have eloped with her that she might
wed the man she loves, my friend Harry Standish. A promising scheme
which you have wrecked very completely. And why? Be pleased to
inform me."</p>

<p>Now at this, Andromeda turns to look at him with such fury of
passionate contempt as for the moment seems beyond utterance, yet
when she contrives to speak it is in quite passionless tone:</p>

<p>"Lord Wrybourne, being a Scrope, shameless evil is part of your
heritage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too true!" he sighs.</p>

<p>"So now to spare myself the shame of hearing you perjure
yourself any longer, I will show evidence of your base
deception&mdash;words written and signed by you!" And from the
bosom of her cloak she draws a letter and tosses it contemptuously
upon the seat beside him&mdash;taking this up, my lord sees it is
superscribed: To The One, and as contemptuously tosses it back,
saying:</p>

<p>"This is the letter poor Sam wrote to Andromeda&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she retorts, bitterly. "This is the letter my Lord of
Wrybourne sent to the woman for whom he fought, risked his life,
and maimed her then acknowledged lover!"</p>

<p>"Then pray how did you come by it?"</p>

<p>"Lady Marwood's French maid delivered it to me&mdash;by mistake,
of course!"</p>

<p>"And you kept it for proof of my lordship's infidelity! Yet,
madam, I tell you again&mdash;that letter was written to you by
poor, grievous, woeful, wounded Sam pleading your mercy&mdash;the
letter that merciless, hard-hearted you returned&mdash;it is the
same letter poor, desperate Sam, heart-broken by your cruelty,
rammed into his pocket and lost while listening to the Marwood Mama
who must have found or taken it under a misapprehension, believing
'The Only One' to be her daughter&mdash;no pray do not interrupt!
Finding her mistake this 'Darling Mama' gave it to the right and
Only One, either to help or hurt her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, why plague me with this absurd rigmarole, all these
audacious, wicked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say lies'!" he warned her. "Instead, tell me&mdash;did
you show this letter to the Duchess&mdash;did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then God bless her nimble wits! Ah, what a woman! For you are
her riposte, her counter-stroke to 'Darling Mama,' yes&mdash;you!
For by her contrivance here you are, despite yourself and your
silly, cruel doubts&mdash;within reach of my arms&mdash;no&mdash;my
arm!" So saying he rose and seated himself beside her and so near
that she drew away, shrinking further into her corner, saying as
she did so:</p>

<p>"My lord&mdash;no&mdash;I beg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh damme!" exclaimed Sam, scowling. "Andromeda, don't be such a
fool." Now though his voice was harsh and face grim, she sighed
deeply and her whole quivering body relaxed because instead of
cynical, smiling, gently-spoken aristocrat here beside her was
gruff sailorman.</p>

<p>"Now, woman," he growled, "you're going to hear God's truth and,
believing it, come into my arms&mdash;no, arm, and lie here on my
heart where you belong&mdash;ay, and shed a tear or so, that I may
kiss 'em away&mdash;or&mdash;call me 'liar' again, but&mdash;for
the last time on this earth. So&mdash;are you listening?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" she answered, looking into these grey eyes of his that
were always too steadfast for deceit. "Tell me&mdash;Sam!"</p>

<p>And so, beginning with his arrival in London, tell her he did,
and with such minute detail that they lost count of time, nor
heeded how often, where or when they stopped at the various stages
to change horses.</p>

<p>"Now," he demanded, when at last this very protracted narration
was ended, "are you going to pipe your lovely eye with regret for
your loss o' faith and cruel treatment of poor Sam? Are you going
to cuddle up to me close as possible and confound my arm! Are you
going to give me that lovely beloved mouth that is quivering
already, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andromeda, swift and passionate in her remorse, did all he
bade...Lips to lips and breast to breast she clung to him, though
tenderly careful of his slung arm, her coquettish bonnet
back-thrown upon loosened strings that she might see him the
better.</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed she, at length, removing her bonnet altogether,
"thank God the detestable Earl is gone and my Sam come back to
me."</p>

<p>"Madam," says my lord, "it is but right you should know and
fully apprehend that both you and your Sam are now and henceforth
my lordship's own particular property."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my lord," she answers, almost shyly, "I can well
believe it and do own it gladly&mdash;when I am safe on the breast
of my Sam."</p>

<p>Thus, stage by stage, southward they journeyed through the
rushing darkness, yet now about them was a radiance not of the
flickering lamp, but a glory all their own. And when at last he
bade her try to sleep, she pillowed her head upon his breast and
with a sigh of happy weariness, obeyed.</p>

<p>As for Sam, looking down upon this beloved head, this splendid
woman that he knew at last was all his own&mdash;and remembering
how and why&mdash;he called down fervent benedictions upon the
little Duchess and presently slumbered also...He awoke to find his
head softly pillowed (a fragrant pillow this that slowly, gently
rose and fell) and the golden eyes of Andromeda looking down upon
him in a radiant dawn.</p>

<p>"You slept," she murmured, "like a baby. And sometimes you are
very like a child. Now lie still and hear me tell my Lord of
Wrybourne it is the sailor, just Sam that I so truly
love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which, madam, is a marvel!"</p>

<p>"And because I love only Sam, my lord must woo and win me for
himself&mdash;for Sam's sake."</p>

<p>"This, my lady Witchery, shall be my lordship's persistent and
joyous endeavour. Though I am astonished that you, a lady born and
bred can stoop to bless such rough, clumsy fellow. So I desire to
know how and why&mdash;your Loveliness can possibly love this
graceless Sam?"</p>

<p>"At first, my lord, just because he was Sam, and later because
he is so very much more than I ever dreamed&mdash;so wise and
generous that he could give back half his fortune, so magnanimous
that he could even free his avowed enemy from prison and allow him
the chance of new life and happiness, and&mdash;yes&mdash;such a
man that he could outwit and outfight the merciless wretch everyone
believed quite invincible! These, my lord, are a few reasons why I
love&mdash;only Sam. I shall find many others later which I will
mention to your lordship. And now, Sam dear, where are you taking
this woman of yours?"</p>

<p>"First to Grannyanne's cottage, according to that mysterious
note&mdash;'if you would see him in life' and so on. I'm still
wondering who wrote it."</p>

<p>"I guess that godmother of mine, all things considered."</p>

<p>"Ha, the Duchess again! So I guess, and God bless her! She's a
grand person, ay, and so is Grannyanne, you've learned to know her
lately, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"So well that I understand why Sam is so fond of her."</p>

<p>"And what of your Uncle Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Godmother has commanded him to paint her portrait."</p>

<p>"Splendid! And when it's done, she won't allow him to destroy
it&mdash;not she! It may do him a power o' good, let's hope
so...Listen&mdash;there's Wrybourne church-clock striking eight!
Soon we shall be kissing Grannyanne and having breakfast with my
shipmate Ned and his Kate at Willowmead where we shall bring
to&mdash;anchor, d'ye see, till our wedding day. That day of days
when you will glorify Sam into your husband&mdash;learn him
something of your own gracious dignity and gentleness. And then,
Andromeda, with you always within hail o' me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With my 'acid tongue,' Sam dear!"</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure, your sweetly acid little tongue to rake me fore
and aft with shattering broadside when needed, or bring me up with
a round turn if I'm in shoal water with social rocks in my lee! Ah,
but&mdash;then my Andromeda, we together, you and I, will steer
such course that soon or late, this cursed name of Scrope shall
come to be honoured and some day, maybe&mdash;even loved."</p>

<p>"It will be, my dear one&mdash;oh, it shall be!"</p>

<p>"Why then, if...Oh, Andromeda, if we should be so
blest...children, d'ye see, my dearest, we should leave them
something worthy&mdash;to live and strive for."</p>

<p>"A heritage truly honourable, my Sam, a heritage noble as my own
sailorman&mdash;to endure long after us, I pray God, clean, strong
and true as Old England itself. Oh, lovely thought!"</p>

<p>"And yonder," said Sam, drawing her arm closer about him,
"yonder is Wrybourne Church where, soon as may be, a sailorman will
be spliced to his lass&mdash;so now, my lady, pray kiss your lord,
to seal the blessed compact."</p>

<p>Thus, in this new day, through a world all green and fragrant
after last night's storm&mdash;now, with rumble of wheel and thud
of hoof, they turned into that familiar, shady lane in time to
hear, sweet as any piping bird, Jane's high, clear voice upraised
in her favourite song:</p>

<blockquote>"In Scarlitt town where I was borned<br>
There was a fair maid dwellin'<br>
Made every lad cry lack a day<br>
Her name was Bar-bree Alling..."</blockquote>

<p>Then rose the deep, joyous barking of a dog.</p>

<p>"And there," said Andromeda, sitting up to adjust her cloak,
smooth frills and furbelows, and tie on her plumed bonnet, "there
is our welcome home!"</p>

<p>"Ay, 'home'!" repeated Sam. "The dearest word in any language,
and with you in it, Andromeda, the loveliest, the holiest, the
most..." But here, with murmur rather like a sob, Andromeda kissed
him.</p>
