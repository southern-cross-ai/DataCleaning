<h2><a id="pro" name="pro"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

<p class="first">A NATIVE woman working in the little cultivated
patch just outside the palisade which surrounded the mission was
the first to see them. Her scream penetrated to the living room of
the little thatched bungalow where the Reverend Sangamon Morton sat
before a table, an open tin box before him and a sheaf of preferred
stock certificates in his hands.</p>

<p>The Reverend Morton had heard such screams before. Sometimes
they meant nothing. Again they might mean the presence of an
inquisitive and savage jungle visitor of the order of carnivora.
But the one thing always uppermost in his mind&mdash;the one great,
abiding terror of their lives there in the midst of the savage
jungle&mdash;was now, as always, the first and natural explanation
of the woman's screams to leap to his mind. The Wakandas had come
at last!</p>

<p>The missionary leaped to his feet, thrust the papers into a long
manila envelope, placed them in the tin box and closed the cover as
he hastened across the room to the wide fireplace. Here he kneeled
and removed a flag stone from the hearth, slipped the box quickly
into the aperture revealed beneath, rose, snatched a rifle from its
hook over the mantle and rushed out into the compound. The whole
thing had taken but a fraction of the time required to tell it.</p>

<p>In another room of the bungalow Mary Morton, the missionary's
wife, and Ruth, his daughter, had heard the scream, and they, too,
ran out into the compound. The Reverend Sangamon Morton found them
there when he arrived, and calling to them to return to the
bungalow, sped on toward the palisade gate, through which were now
streaming the score of women and children who had been working in
the garden.</p>

<p>Some native men were also hastening toward the gate from their
various duties about the mission, converted heathen armed with
ancient Enfields. The woman who had first screamed and whose shrill
cry of terror had aroused the peaceful little community now fell to
her knees before the Reverend Morton.</p>

<p>"Oh, sabe me, massa!" she cried. "Sabe me from de Wakandas! De
Wakandas hab came!"</p>

<p>Morton brushed past her and hurried to the gate. He would have a
look at the enemy first. The Reverend Morton was not a man to be
easily stampeded. He had answered to false alarms in the past, and
though he never permitted the cry of "Wolf!" to find him unready
for the inevitable time when it should prove a true cry he was
prone to scepticism until he should have the substantiating
testimony of his own eyes.</p>

<p>Now, as he passed through the gate, his first glance at the
approaching "enemy" brought a sigh of relief to his lips. Coming
out of the jungle were strange black men, it was
true&mdash;warriors armed with spears, and even guns&mdash;but with
them marched two white men, and at the sight of the pith helmets
and the smoke from two briar pipes a broad smile touched the lips
of the Reverend Sangamon Morton.</p>

<p>The smile expanded into a good-natured laugh as he advanced to
welcome the strangers and explain to them the panic into which
their unheralded appearance had thrown his little community.</p>

<p>And so came Jefferson Scott, Jr., and his boon companion, Robert
Gordon, to the little American Methodist mission in the heart of
the African jungle. And there one of them, young Scott, found a
wife in the missionary's daughter, Ruth. Robert Gordon remained for
a month after the missionary had performed the simple ceremony that
made his daughter Mrs. Jefferson Scott, Jr. Gordon was best man at
the wedding, and with Mrs. Morton witnessed the marriage
certificate.</p>

<p>The two young Americans had come to Africa to hunt big game.
Jefferson Scott, Jr., remained to cast his lot with his wife's
people in their unselfish work among the natives. Gordon bade them
goodbye at last to return to his home in New York, and the evening
before his departure the Reverend Mr. Morton called him into the
living room, removed the flagstone from the hearth, and, reaching
in, opened the tin box and withdrew a large manila envelope.</p>

<p>"I wish, Mr. Gordon," he said, "that you would deliver this into
the keeping of Jefferson's father. It contains practically the
entire fortune which I inherited from my father and for which I
have no use here, but which, in the event of anything befalling me,
would be of inestimable value to Mrs. Morton and Ruth. It is not
safe here. The Wakandas, if rumor is to be credited, are preparing
to revolt against the Belgian authorities, and if they do we shall
have to leave here and cross nearly half the continent of Africa to
safety.</p>

<p>"Under such circumstances these valuable papers would but add to
my anxiety and worries, and so I ask you to take them to Mr. Scott
for safety until my mission here is fulfilled and we all return to
America."</p>

<p>And so Robert Gordon bade them farewell and started upon his
journey to America, the manila envelope safe in his inside
pocket.</p>

<p>A year later a little girl was born to Ruth Morton Scott&mdash;a
little girl whom they christened Virginia, after the commonwealth
of which her father was a native son.</p>

<p>When Virginia was a year old it came&mdash;the hideous thing
that was often uppermost in the minds of all that little band
isolated in the heart of the savage jungle. The Wakandas
revolted.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Lieutenant De Boes heard the challenge of a sentry at the gate.
Languidly he looked in the direction of the sounds and inwardly
anathematized whatever fool might be moving about in such
insufferable heat. Presently he saw one of his noncommissioned
officers approaching with a naked savage. The stranger was
sweat-streaked and panting, his eyes were wide in terror. The
corporal brought him before the officer, saluting. Lieutenant De
Boes noted excitement in his soldier's expression.</p>

<p>"What now?" he asked, returning the salute.</p>

<p>"The Wakandas are upon the warpath," reported the subordinate.
"This fellow says that they killed nearly all within the village
and then started for the mission where the Americans are."</p>

<p>Lieutenant De Boes sat up quickly and, leaning forward toward
the news-bringer, fired question after question at him. When he had
satisfied himself that the man did not lie he leaped to his feet.
All thoughts of heat or lassitude were gone. He gave a quiet sharp
order to the corporal, and as that soldier ran across the parade
ground to the beehive barracks De Boes ran indoors and donned his
marching togs and his side arms.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later a little company of fifty blacks in command
of a single Belgian lieutenant filed through the factory gate and
took up their march against a warlike tribe which numbered perhaps
a thousand spears.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Once again came the terrified shriek of a native to the ears of
the dwellers within the mission. Once again the men within ran
toward the gates&mdash;ready but doubting. Jefferson Scott, Jr. was
first among them, for he was younger and could run faster than his
father-in-law. And this time the wolf had come.</p>

<p>The Wakandas were at the gates by the time the two white men had
reached them. The Reverend Sangamon Morton fell, pierced through
the breast by a heavy war spear before ever he could fire a shot in
defense of his loved ones.</p>

<p>Scott, reinforced by the handful of men converts who lived
within the mission enclosure, repelled the first charge, his heavy
express rifle and deadly accuracy sending the blacks back toward
the jungle, where they leaped and shouted until they worked
themselves into a sufficient hysteria to warrant another assault.
Time and again the ebon horde swooped down upon the gates. Time and
again the handful of defenders drove them back. Yet it was without
hope that Jefferson Scott, Jr. fought. He knew what must be the
inevitable outcome. Already his own ammunition was exhausted and
there was but little more good powder available for the
Enfields.</p>

<p>They might hold out another day, but what good would that
accomplish? It would be but to defer the final frightful moment. If
they could but get word to the Belgian officer and his little
command over on the Uluki. Scott questioned his companions as to
the feasibility of getting a runner through to the factory. It was
impossible, they said, as the whole country between the mission and
the Belgians would be over-run by Wakandas by this time. Not one
would volunteer to attempt the journey. They had fought bravely at
his side, but none dared venture among the Wakandas, the very
mention of whose name filled them with unreasonable terror.</p>

<p>But it was the only hope that Scott had. He must get word to the
factory. If his blacks were afraid to bear it he must do so
himself. His only hesitancy in the matter was the thought of
leaving his young wife and baby daughter to the sole protection of
the native converts. During a lull in the fighting he returned to
the bungalow and placed the matter squarely before his wife and her
mother.</p>

<p>"You must go, Jefferson," said the older woman. "I can take your
place at the gates. The men love me, I know, and will fight for me
and Ruth as bravely as though you remained. I will remain beside
them and give them the moral support they need, and if there is a
spare musket I can use that, too."</p>

<p>And so it was that as soon as night had fallen Jefferson Scott,
Jr. slipped into the jungle upon his useless mission&mdash;useless,
because a native had already carried the warning to De Boes.</p>

<p>Scott never reached the factory, nor did he ever return to the
mission. Only the Wakandas know what his fate was.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>De Boes and his soldiers arrived at the mission early in the
morning after an all-night march. They came upon the rear of the
Wakandas just as the savages made their last and successful charge.
A score or more of the howling demons had scaled the gates and were
among the defenders as the rifles of the Belgian's black soldiers
volleyed into their rear. The Wakandas, taken wholly by surprise,
broke and fled.</p>

<p>Inside the mission defenses De Boes found a dozen dead, and
among them the body of courageous Mary Morton, lying just within
the gates. In the bungalow Ruth Scott stood with a rifle in her
hands, before the cradle of her little daughter&mdash;bereft in a
single day of father, mother, and husband. The kindly and courteous
Belgian helped her bury her dead, and sent out parties into the
jungle in search of Scott, keeping them out until fear that he had
been killed became a certainty. Then he conducted the mother and
child back to the factory and from there arranged for their
conveyance to the coast. Two months later Ruth Scott and little
Virginia arrived at the Virginia homestead of the widowed and now
childless Jefferson Scott&mdash;the father of her dead husband.</p>

<p>When, a year before, Jefferson Scott had learned of his son's
marriage, he had not been displeased, though the idea of the boy
remaining in Africa was not altogether to his liking. Then had come
Robert Gordon with enthusiastic descriptions of the new
daughter-in-law and her parents, and Jefferson Scott began to long
for the return of his son and the coming of his son's wife to
brighten the sombre life of the old mansion.</p>

<p>Gordon had delivered a long manila envelope into the elder
Scott's keeping. "Mr. Morton felt that it would be safer here than
in Africa," he explained. "It contains a considerable fortune in
stocks, if I understood him correctly."</p>

<p>Then, after a long year, had come the news of the Wakanda
uprising and the death of his son and the Mortons. Immediately
Jefferson Scott cabled funds to his daughter-in-law, together with
instructions that she come at once to him. That same night he took
the long manila envelope from his safe to examine the contents,
that he might have the necessary legal steps taken to insure the
proper transfer of the certificates to Ruth Scott's name.</p>

<p>The manila of the wrapper was of unusual thickness, giving an
appearance of bulk to the package that was deceptive, for when he
opened it Jefferson Scott discovered but a single paper within. As
he withdrew this and examined it a puzzled smile touched his lips.
For a moment he sat regarding the document in his hand, then he
shook his head and returned it to the envelope.</p>

<p>He did not place it again in the safe, but carrying it upstairs
opened an old fashioned wall cupboard, withdrew a tin box from it,
placed the envelope in the tin box, and returned it to the
cupboard.</p>

<p>Two months later he welcomed Ruth Morton to his fireside, and
from that moment until his death she was as an own daughter to him,
sharing his love with her little Virginia, whom Jefferson Scott
idolized.</p>

<p>And in the nineteen years that intervened it is doubtful if the
manila envelope or its contents ever again entered the mind of the
grandfather.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">THE closed door of the bedroom opened. A bent and
white-haired old negro walked slowly out, his face buried in a red
bandanna and his shrunken shoulders heaving to the sobs he could
not control. Down at the negroes' quarters the banjos and the old
melodeon were stilled. Even the little piccaninnies sat with hushed
voices and tearful mien. In the big front bedroom of the mansion
two women knelt beside a bed, their faces buried in the coverlet,
weeping. There were tears, too, in the eyes of the old doctor, and
even stern old Judge Sperry blew his great beak of a nose with
unnecessary vigor as he walked to the window and looked out across
the broad acres of his lifetime friend. Jefferson Scott was
dead.</p>

<p>That night Scott Taylor, the son of Jefferson Scott's dead
sister, arrived from New York. Virginia Scott had met him several
times in the past, when a child, he had visited his uncle. She knew
but little of his past life, other than that Jefferson Scott had
paid on two occasions to keep him out of jail and that of recent
years the old man had refused to have any intercourse whatever with
his nephew.</p>

<p>Taylor was a couple of years her senior, a rather good looking
man, notwithstanding the marks of dissipation that marred his
features. He was college bred, suave and distinctly at ease in any
company. Had she known less of him Virginia Scott might easily have
esteemed him highly, but, knowing what she did, she felt only
disgust for him. His coming at this time she looked upon as little
less than brazen effrontery, for he had been forbidden the house by
Jefferson Scott several years before, nor since then had he once
communicated with his uncle. That he had returned now in hope of
legacy she knew as well as though he had candidly announced the
fact, and it was with difficulty that she accorded him even the
scantest courtesy in her greeting.</p>

<p>Judge Sperry, who was searching among Jefferson Scott's papers
in the library when Taylor arrived, took one look at him over the
tops of his glasses, a look that passed slowly from his face down
to his boots, ignoring his proffered hand and returned to his
search without a further acknowledgement of the younger man's
existence.</p>

<p>Taylor flushed, shrugged his shoulders and turned back to
Virginia, but Virginia had left the room. He fidgeted about, his
ease of manner a trifle jarred, for a moment or two, and then
recovering his poise, addressed Judge Sperry.</p>

<p>"Did my uncle leave a will?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He made a will, sir," snapped the Judge, "about a year ago,
sir, in which you were not mentioned, sir. He has made no other,
that I know of. If I were you, sir, I should return to New York.
There is nothing here for you."</p>

<p>Taylor half smiled.</p>

<p>"I take it you are looking for the will," he said. "Well, I'll
just stick around until you find it. If you don't find it I inherit
half the property&mdash;whether you want me to or not."</p>

<p>Judge Sperry vouchsafed no reply, and presently Taylor left the
room, wandered out across the grounds and down the road toward the
little village, where, if there were no acquaintances, there was at
least something to drink.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, fortified by several Kentucky bourbons, he
returned, nor could Virginia's mother bring herself to refuse him
the ordinary hospitalities of that old Virginian home, and so he
remained, following the body of his uncle to the grave with the
other members of the family, the friends and the servants.</p>

<p>And after the funeral he stayed on, watching with as eager eyes
as the rest, the further search for the last will and testament of
Jefferson Scott, but with hopes diametrically at variance with
theirs. Naturally he saw much of Virginia, though not as much as he
should have liked to see.</p>

<p>He found that the little girl he had known years before had
grown into a beautiful young woman&mdash;and while it angered him
to realize the contempt in which she held him, he was not so
wanting in egotism but that he believed he might win his way
eventually into her good graces. For this reason he never reverted
to the subject of the will. He did his best to impress upon
Virginia and her mother that his one object in remaining thus away
from his business was in the hope that he might prove of some
service to them now that he upon whom they both had leaned for
advice and protection had been taken away from them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott was beginning to tolerate him and Virginia to feel
sorry for him, yet both could not but look forward with feelings of
relief to the meeting of the administrators which was to be held in
the library of the Scott house the following morning. They felt
that the action then taken would decide their status legally and
render the further presence of Scott Taylor unnecessary. That it
had been Jefferson Scott's intention that Virginia should inherit
his entire estate they both knew, and were equally positive that
the administrators would adopt every legal means to carry out the
grandfather's expressed wish. Judge Sperry had explained Taylor's
legal rights in the event that no will should be discovered, nor
was Virginia at all desirous of attempting to reduce the amount
that might be legally his.</p>

<p>It was the evening before the meeting. Taylor had gone to town
in the afternoon. Mrs. Scott had already retired and Virginia sat
reading in the library when Scott Taylor entered. As the girl
greeted him civilly her eyes took in his flushed face and unsteady
carriage and she saw that he had been drinking more than
usually.</p>

<p>Then she let her eyes fall again to her book.</p>

<p>Taylor crossed the room and stood where he could watch her
profile. For several moments he did not speak, then he came closer
and took a chair directly in front of her.</p>

<p>The effect of her beauty upon his drink-excited passions caused
him to throw diplomacy and caution to the winds.</p>

<p>"Look here, Virginia," he said, leaning forward toward her
unsteadily.</p>

<p>The girl looked up in polite questioning, but there was a
warning light in her eye that a more sober man than Scott Taylor
would have discerned and heeded.</p>

<p>"Yes?" The rising inflection was accompanied by a raising of the
arched brows.</p>

<p>"Why not be friends, Virginia?"</p>

<p>Taylor continued. "We're both of us due for a share of the old
man's property. It amounts to a big bunch of coin, but it's mostly
in farm lands. It ought not to be cut up. We ought to keep it
intact. I got a scheme." He edged his chair closer until their
knees all but touched. "We're about the same age. I'm not such a
bad sort when you know me, and you're a peach. I always knew it,
and this time I've discovered something else&mdash;I love you." He
was leaning so far forward now that his face was close to hers.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes were wide in astonishment and disgust. She rose
slowly and drew herself up to her full height.</p>

<p>"I would not, for the world," she said, "intentionally wound any
man who came to me with an avowal of honest love; but I do not
believe that you love me, and, further, the manner of your coming
to me is an insult."</p>

<p>Taylor had risen and was facing her. If possible she was even
more beautiful in anger than in repose. His self-control vanished
before the scorn in her eyes and in her voice.</p>

<p>"You can learn to love me," he muttered, and seized her in his
arms. Virginia struggled, but he crushed her closer to him until
his lips were above hers. With all effort almost superhuman the
girl succeeded in covering Taylor's face with her open palm and
pushing him from her. Unsteady from drink, the man staggered back
against the chair he had left, toppled over it and fell in a heap
upon the floor.</p>

<p>When, after an effort, he managed to crawl to his feet, Virginia
had disappeared. Taylor sank to the edge of a chair, his face
contorted with rage and humiliation. He was not so intoxicated but
that he now realized the fool he had made of himself and the
ridiculous figure he must have cut reeling drunkenly over the
chair. His rage, instead of being directed against himself as it
should have been, was all for Virginia. He would make her pay! He
would have his revenge. She should be left penniless, if there was
any way, straight or crooked, to accomplish it.</p>

<p>And in this pleasant mood Scott Taylor made his unsteady way to
bed. It was late when Taylor awoke the following morning. Already
the administrators had gathered with Mrs. Scott and Virginia in the
library.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before the man could recall to memory the
events of the previous evening. As they filtered slowly through his
befogged brain a slow flush of anger crept over his face. Then he
recalled the meeting that had been scheduled for today. He glanced
at his watch. It was already past time. Springing up, he dressed
hastily and left his room.</p>

<p>Half way down the stairs he heard voices coming from the library
below. He paused to listen. Judge Sperry was speaking.</p>

<p>"Jefferson Scott never intended that that young scalawag should
have one cent's worth of his property," he was saying. "He told me
upon several occasions that he would not have his money dissipated
in riotous living, and by gad, gentlemen, if I have anything to say
about it Jefferson Scott's wishes shall be observed," and he
pounded the black walnut table with a heavy fist.</p>

<p>"I think," spoke up another voice, "that when the simple proofs
necessary to establish legally Miss Virginia's relationship to
General Scott have been produced it will be a comparatively simple
matter to arrange the thing as he would have wished it."</p>

<p>"Simple proofs necessary to establish legally Miss Virginia's
relationship to General Scott!" The words ran through Scott
Taylor's brain almost meaninglessly at first, and then slowly a
great light broke upon him, his eyes went wide and his lip curled
in an ironical smile.</p>

<p>A moment later he entered the library. His manner was easy and
confident. He sneered just a little as Virginia deliberately turned
her shoulder toward him. A vast silence fell upon the company as he
joined them. He was the first to break it.</p>

<p>"I am glad," he said, "that we can now straighten out a few
matters that have been causing several of you not a little
annoyance." He glanced defiantly at Judge Sperry. "Jefferson Scott,
my uncle, died intestate. Under the circumstances, and the law, I
inherit&mdash;I am the sole heir."</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott and the administrators looked at the young man in
surprise&mdash;Virginia kept her back toward him. For several
seconds there was unbroken silence&mdash;the bald effrontery of
Taylor's statement had taken even Judge Sperry's breath
away&mdash;but not for long.</p>

<p>"Sole heir?" shouted the old man presently. "Sole heir? Sole
nothing! You don't deserve a penny of your uncle's estate, and you
don't get a penny of it, if I can prevent it."</p>

<p>"But you can't prevent it, my friend," Taylor assured him
coolly.</p>

<p>"You can't prevent it because, as I just said, I am the sole
heir."</p>

<p>"I presume," bellowed the Judge, "that you have more rights here
than General Scott's granddaughter?"</p>

<p>"He had no legitimate granddaughter," replied Taylor, the
sneering laugh on his lips speaking more truly the purport of his
insinuation than even the plain words he had used.</p>

<p>"What? You young scoundrel!" cried Judge Sperry, springing to
his feet and taking a step toward Taylor.</p>

<p>"Don't get excited," said Taylor. "Of course it's unfortunate
that it became necessary to touch upon this matter, but I gave Miss
Virginia an opportunity to compromise last night, which she
refused, and so there is nothing else for me to do but insist upon
my rights. It's a very simple matter to rectify if I am not
mistaken. All that Mrs. Scott need do is produce her marriage
certificate, or the records of the local authorities where her
wedding took place. And now, until she can establish the right of
her daughter to make any legal claim whatsoever upon the estate of
my uncle, I shall have to ask you all to vacate the premises and
leave me in possession of what is mine and no one else's."</p>

<p>The administrators turned toward Mrs. Scott. She shook her head
sadly.</p>

<p>"You all know, of course, as well as he does, that his charges
are as false as they are infamous," she said. "I was married in the
heart of Central Africa. Whatever records there were of the
ceremony have long since been destroyed, I fear; and I fear also
that it may be a difficult thing to legally prove my marriage.
Robert Gordon of New York was one of the witnesses. If he still
lives I presume an affidavit from him would be sufficient?" She
glanced at Judge Sperry.</p>

<p>"It would," he assured her, "and in the mean time I intend to
kick this miserable little puppy into the road." And he advanced
upon Taylor.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Scott who stepped in front of the Judge.</p>

<p>"No, my dear friend," she said, "we must not do that. He has,
possibly, legal if not moral right upon his side, for until I can
prove the legality of my marriage he is in the eyes of the law the
sole heir. And in the meantime Virginia and I shall make our
preparations and leave here as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the sort," exploded the Judge. "You will
stay right here. If you leave it will be a tacit admission of the
truth of a lie. I won't hear of your leaving, not for a moment. If
any one leaves, this rascally blackleg will be the one to go."</p>

<p>"No," spoke up Virginia. "I shall not leave. The Judge is
right."</p>

<p>"As you will," said Taylor. "I can't kick a couple women out of
my home if they insist on remaining."</p>

<p>"You'd better not," growled the Judge.</p>

<p>It was not until afternoon that Mrs. Scott found an opportunity
to pen a note to Robert Gordon. She had not seen her husband's old
friend since that day twenty-one years before that she had waved
him farewell from the veranda of the bungalow within the palisade
of her mission home. He had stopped in London on his way to
America, met and married an English girl, and thereafter for long
years had spent much time in England or in travel. It had not been
until after the death of his wife that he had returned to New York
permanently.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Scott finished the letter an automobile whirled up the
driveway and came to a stop before the mansion. Women's voices
floated in to her and to Virginia to whom she had been reading the
completed letter. The latter walked over to the open doors, where
she glanced out, and then, turning to her mother with an "Oh, it's
Mrs. Clayton and Charlotte!" ran out to greet visitors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott, as thoroughly imbued with Southern hospitality as a
native daughter, dropped her letter upon the desk and followed
Virginia to the porch, where she found her friends insisting that
she and Virginia accompany them on a drive to the village. As it
was too warm for wraps neither mother nor daughter returned to the
house, and only too glad of an interruption to the sorrows and
worries that had recently overwhelmed them, entered the machine of
the Clayton's and a moment later were whirling down the road in a
cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Scott Taylor, who had been strolling about the plantation,
returned to the house shortly after they had left and entering
through the French windows of the library, chanced to note the open
letter lying on the desk. It required no subjugation of ethical
scruples upon his part to pick the letter up and read it.</p>

<p>The letter ran:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="scmap">My Dear Mr.
Gordon</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">My husband's father, Jefferson Scott, has just
passed away, and as certain legal requirements necessitate a proof
of my marriage to Jefferson I am writing to ask that you mail an
affidavit to Judge Sperry, of this village, to the effect that you
witnessed the ceremony.</p>

<p class="letter">My marriage certificate is, I imagine, still in
the tin box beneath the hearth of the mission bungalow where father
always kept his valuables, but as even it may have been destroyed
during the second uprising of the Wakandas I imagine that we shall
have to depend entirely upon your affidavit. I understand that the
savages left no stone standing upon another, and that every stick
or timber was burned. That was eighteen years ago&mdash;a year
after the massacre in which Jefferson, father and mother were
slain, and so it is rather doubtful if anything remains of the
certificate.</p>

<p class="letter">I am particularly anxious to legally establish
the authenticity of my marriage, not so much because of the
property which my daughter Virginia will inherit thereby, as from
the fact that another heir has questioned my daughter's
legitimacy.</p>

<p class="letter">I write thus plainly to you because of the love I
know that you and Jefferson felt for one another, as well as to
impress upon you my urgent need of this affidavit, which you alone
can furnish.</p>

<p class="letter">Very sincerely,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Ruth Morton Scott</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">Scottsville, Va.</p>

<p class="letter">July 10, 19__.</p>
<br>

<p>"H'm," commented Mr. Scott Taylor, with a laugh. "Well, I can
let this letter go forward with perfect safety, as I happen to know
that Robert Gordon, Esq., died two years ago."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">MR. DICK GORDON of New York, rich, indolent and
bored, tossed his morning paper aside, yawned, rose from the
breakfast table and strolled wearily into the living room of his
bachelor apartments. His man, who was busying himself about the
room, looked up at his master questioningly.</p>

<p>"I am wondering, Murphy," announced that young man, "what the
devil we are going to do to assassinate time today."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Murphy, "you know you sort o' promised Mr.
Jones as how you'd make up a four-flush at the Country Club this
morning, sir."</p>

<p>"Foursome, Murphy, foursome!" laughed Gordon, and then, shooting
a sharp glance at his servant; "I believe you were handing me one
that time, you old fraud."</p>

<p>But the solemn-visaged Murphy shook his head in humble and
horrified denial.</p>

<p>"All right, Murphy; get my things out. I suppose I might as well
do that as anything," resignedly.</p>

<p>Languidly, Mr. Dick Gordon donned his golf togs and stood at
last correctly clothed and with the faithful Murphy at his heels
bearing his caddie bag. He crossed the living room toward the door
of the apartment, halted half way and turned upon his servant.</p>

<p>"Golf's an awful bore, Murphy," he said. "Let's not play
today."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Jones, sir!" exclaimed Murphy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jones's foursomes always start at the nineteenth hole and
never make the first. They'll not miss me." His eyes fell upon a
tennis racket, and lighted with a new interest.</p>

<p>"Say, Murphy, we haven't played tennis in a coon's age," he
exclaimed. "Go put those clubs away. I'm going to play tennis."</p>

<p>"With yourself, sir?" questioned Murphy. "I never saw no one
playing tennis at the club, sir, of a morning."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Murphy, and anyway I don't want to play
tennis. Tiresome game, tennis."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Ha! I have it! Great morning for a ride. Hustle, you old snail,
and fetch my things. Telephone Billy and tell him to bring Redcoat
around. Get a move on!"</p>

<p>By the time Murphy had attended to the various duties assigned
him and returned from the telephone he found his young master
sitting on the edge of a chair with one boot on and the other half
so, staring hard at the floor, a weary expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Can I help you, sir?" asked Murphy.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can help me take off this boot. It's too hot to ride,
and besides I don't want to ride anyway. What the devil did you
suggest riding for, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I wish that you would say no, sir, for a change, Murphy. You're
getting to be a terrific bore in your old age. Go and tell Billy to
never mind Redcoat."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Murphy, but he did not go.</p>

<p>"You'd better hurry, Murphy, and catch him before he leaves the
stables," suggested Gordon after a moment, in which he had divested
himself of his riding breeches and started to pull on the trousers
of a street suit.</p>

<p>"It won't be necessary, sir," said Murphy. "I didn't telephone
for Redcoat in the first place, sir. I knew as how you would change
your mind, sir, and thought it wouldn't be worth while calling up,
sir."</p>

<p>Gordon cocked his head on one side and surveyed his servant from
head to foot for a long moment. "Yes, sir," he said, at last.</p>

<p>Clothed again he wandered back into the living room, wishing
that there was something in the world to hold his interest for a
moment. The photograph of a handsome woman caught his eye. He
picked it up and looked at it for several seconds.</p>

<p>"She photographs well," he murmured, "and that is about all one
can say for her. I'll bet an X-ray of her brain wouldn't show three
convolutions."</p>

<p>Then he passed to another, the picture of a young debutante at
whose feet were half the eligible males of New York
Society&mdash;and all the ineligible. He tossed the photographs
aside in disgust. One by one he examined others. All wearied him.
Everything wearied him.</p>

<p>"I wish," he remarked, turning toward Murphy, "that there was
something or some one on earth that could raise my temperature over
half a degree."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Murphy. "That must be the mail man, sir," as an
electric bell rang in the rear of the apartment and Murphy turned
toward the door.</p>

<p>A moment later he re-entered with a bundle of letters in his
hand, laying them on Gordon's desk. The young man picked up the top
envelope and opened it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. R___ requests the pleasure&mdash;" he read, half aloud,
and dropped the invitation listlessly upon the desk to pick up and
open the next. "The Blank Club announces&mdash;The Blank Club is
always announcing tiresome things," he sighed, and dropped the
communication into the waste basket.</p>

<p>"Mrs. F. Benton J___ and Miss J___ will be at home ___ which is
a dang sight more than Mr. F. Benton J___ can ever say," commented
Mr. Gordon, gathering up the next, which proved to be another
invitation. One after another the young man opened the envelopes,
nor did any succeed in erasing the bored expression from his
countenance.</p>

<p>The last he glanced at with a faint tinge of curiosity before
opening. The feminine hand writing was unfamiliar, which was
nothing unusual, but it was the postmark that drew his
interest&mdash;Scottsville, Virginia.</p>

<p>"Now, who the devil do I know in Scottsville, Virginia?" he
asked himself as he drew his paper knife through the flap of the
envelope.

<p>"Oh, it's addressed to Dad!" he exclaimed, suddenly
noting his father's name upon the envelope.

<p>"Dear old Dad," sighed
the young man; "I never lacked bully good company when you were
alive, and I didn't know then what it meant to be bored. I wonder
if you know how I miss you."</p>

<p>He turned first to the signature at the close of the letter.
"Ruth Morton Scott," he read. "H'm, I've heard Dad speak of you,
and Jefferson Scott, Jr., your husband, and the tragedy at the
mission. Lord, what an awful place that must have been for a young
girl! It was bad enough three years ago when Dad and I camped among
its ruins; but twenty years ago the country must have been awful
for white women."</p>

<p>As Dick Gordon read the letter through slowly his face reflected
for the first time in days a real interest. Toward the close he
muttered something that sounded like "Damned cad," and then he
carefully re-read the letter. After the second reading he sat upon
the edge of his desk, the letter still in the hand that had dropped
to his knee, and stared fixedly and unseeingly at the barbaric
patterns of the Navajo rug at his feet.</p>

<p>For ten minutes he sat thus; then he sprang up, animation
reflected upon his face and determination in his every movement.
Weariness and lassitude had been swept away as by magic. Seating
himself at the desk he drew writing materials from a drawer and for
ten minutes more was busily engaged in framing a letter. This done
he rang for Murphy.</p>

<p>"Skip out and post this, you old tortoise," he shouted, "and
then go and book passage for the two of us on the first boat that
sails direct or makes good connections for Mombasa&mdash;do you
know where it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Africa, sir," replied the imperturbable Murphy, in as
matter of fact a tone as though White Plains was to have been their
destination.</p>

<p>Mr. Dick Gordon always had been an impulsive young man, his
saving characteristic being an innate fineness of character that
directed his impulses into good channels, if not always wisely
chosen ones. His letter to Mrs. Scott had been written upon the
impulse of the moment&mdash;an impulse to serve his father's friend
coupled with a longing for adventure and action&mdash;for a change
from the monotony of his useless existence.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The following day, as Scott Taylor, mounted upon General Scott's
favorite saddle horse, rode leisurely about "my plantation," as he
now described the Scott estate, he chanced to meet the little wagon
of the Rural Free Delivery carrier coming from town.</p>

<p>"Anything for The Oaks?" he asked, reining in.</p>

<p>The man handed him a packet of letters and papers, clucked to
his bony old horse and drove on. Taylor ran through the letters.
There was one that interested him&mdash;it bore the name and
address of Richard Gordon on the flap. This he thrust into his
inside pocket. Then he rode up the driveway, turned his horse over
to a negro, and entered the library. It was empty, and laying the
balance of the mail upon the table he made his way to his own room.
Here he quickly opened and read Gordon's letter to Mrs. Scott. His
eyes narrowed and his brows contracted with the reading of the last
paragraph:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"Father has been dead two years; but I know all
about the location of the mission, as I visited it three years ago
while lion hunting with him. As I am just about to leave for Africa
again I shall make it a point to recover the papers you wish."</p>
<br>

<p>Taylor crumpled the letter angrily in his hand. "The fool!" he
muttered, "what does he want to butt in for?"</p>

<p>Then came a knock upon the door and Taylor hastily crammed the
letter into the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he snapped, and an old negress entered with fresh
towels and bed linen. As she moved in her slow and deliberate way
about her duties Taylor sat with puckered brows and narrowed lids
gazing through the window. It was not until the woman had left the
room that he arose. Now he seemed to have reached a decision that
demanded rapid action. He snatched off his coat, throwing it across
the bed, where it dropped over the side to the floor beyond. His
trousers he flung on the floor; his shirt, collar and tie upon the
center table, and in fifteen minutes he was dressed in fresh linen
and another suit and cramming his belongings into his bag.</p>

<p>Running downstairs and out to the stables, he shouted to a
hostler to harness the team and take him to the station. Mrs. Scott
and Virginia had the car out, so he was forced to content himself
with the slower method of transportation. Forty-five minutes later
he boarded a northbound train for New York, and late that night
rang the bell of an apartment in West One Hundred and Forty-Fifth
Street.</p>

<p>A bleached blonde in a green kimono opened the door in response
to his ring.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, kid!" she cried when the dim light in the hallway
revealed his features to her. "You're just in time for a snifter.
Where you been keepin' yourself? Jim and me were talkin' about you
not five minutes ago. Come on in; the gang's all here," and she
grasped him by the lapel of his coat, drew him in from the hall and
slammed the door.</p>

<p>"I've been doing the rural," replied Taylor with a laugh; "and,
take it from me, it's mighty good to be back again where there are
some live ones."</p>

<p>He preceded the girl into the dining room of the little
apartment, where two men, seated at the dining table with a deck of
cards, a bottle of Scotch, a syphon and three glasses rose as he
entered and greeted him with a noisy welcome.</p>

<p>"Well, well! Little ol' kid back again!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jim! Hello, Bill!" cried Taylor, grasping their
outstretched hands. "You sure look good to me."</p>

<p>"Get another glass, Blanche,"</p>

<p>Jim called to the girl. "Sit in, kid, and we'll have a little
round o' roodle&mdash;dollar limit&mdash;whatd'yu say?"</p>

<p>"Piker game," sneered Taylor, with a grin. "I'm dealing in
millions, just now. Throw your cards in the goboon and listen to
me, if you want to make a hundred thou apiece." He paused to note
the effect of his remark.</p>

<p>"Quick, Blanche!" cried Jim. "Get the poor devil a drink.
Can't you see he's dying of thirst and gone bug?"</p>

<p>Taylor grinned. "I'm sure dying of thirst alright," he admitted,
"but I'm not bug. Now listen&mdash;here's how, thanks!&mdash;you
guys are broke. You always have been and always will be till you
stop piking. Once in a while you pull down a couple of simoleons
and then sweat blood for a week or so for fear you'll be pinched
and get a couple of years on the Island. I've got a real
proposition here; but it's a man's job, though there isn't any
chance of a comeback because we'll pull it off where there's no
lamp posts and no law."</p>

<p>He paused and eyed his companions.</p>

<p>"Spill!" said Bill.</p>

<p>Taylor narrated the events that had taken place during the past
week.</p>

<p>"And now," he concluded, "if this Buttinsky Gordon brings back
that marriage certificate I can kiss all my chances goodbye, for
there isn't a court in that neck of the woods that would give me a
look in with that Scott chicken if she had a ghost of a case."</p>

<p>"And you want us to?" Jim paused.</p>

<p>"You guessed it the first time," said Taylor. "I want you to
help me follow Gordon, take that paper away from him&mdash;croak
him."</p>

<p>For a moment the four sat in silence.</p>

<p>"Why do you have to croak him?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"So he can't come back and swear that he seen the certificate,"
said Bill. "That would be just as good as the certificate itself in
any court, against the kid."</p>

<p>"There isn't the least chance of our getting in wrong either,"
explained Taylor, "because we can lay it all onto the natives or to
an accident and there won't be anybody to disprove it&mdash;if we
are suspected; but the chances are that we can pull it off without
anyone being the wiser."</p>

<p>"And what did you say we got out of it?" asked Bill.</p>

<p>"A hundred thou apiece the day I get the property in my hands,"
replied Taylor. "If you could get hold of the certificate first it
would be fine and dandy, but we've got to follow Gordon to Central
Africa to find where it is, and by that time he'll have it. So the
only chance we have is to pass him the K. O. and take it away from
him. I'll sure breathe easier after I've seen that piece of paper
go up in smoke."</p>

<p>James Kelley and William Gootch were, colloquially, short
sports. They had rolled many a souse and separated more than a
single rube from his bank roll by such archaic means as wire
tapping and fixed mills, but so far they never had risen to the
heights of murder. The idea found them tremulous but receptive.
Their doubts were based more upon the material than the ethical.
Could they get away with it without danger of detection. Ah, that
was the question&mdash;the only question.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Taylor, after a long pause, during which the other
two had drained their glasses while the girl sat revolving hers
upon the table cloth between her fingers.</p>

<p>"I'm game," announced Kelley, dodging the girl's eyes and
looking sideways at Gootch.</p>

<p>"So'm I!" declared the latter.</p>

<p>And so it happened that when Mr. Dick Gordon walked up the gang
plank of the liner that was to bear him as far as Liverpool in his
journey to Africa, three men, leaning over a rail on an upper deck,
watched him with interested eyes.</p>

<p>"That's him," said Taylor, "the tall one, just in front of the
solemn looking party that resembles a Methodist minister crossed in
love&mdash;only he ain't. He's Gordon's man."</p>

<p>As neither Gordon nor Murphy were acquainted even by sight or
repute with any of the precious three, the latter made no attempt
to avoid them during the trip. It was Taylor's intention to scrape
an acquaintance with Gordon after they had changed ships at
Liverpool, when he would then know for certain Gordon's
destination, and could casually announce that he and his companions
were bound for that very point on a hunting expedition.</p>

<p>All went well with his plans until after they had sailed from
Liverpool for Mombasa, when the depravity which was inherent in
Kelley and Gootch resulted in an unpleasantness which immediately
terminated all friendly relations between Gordon and the three.
Taylor had succeeded in drawing Gordon into conversation soon after
sailing from Liverpool, when he casually remarked that he and his
friends were bound for the country about Victoria Nyanza in search
of lions.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" exclaimed Gordon. "I am going into the
neighborhood of Albert Edward Nyanza myself, and shall take the
route from Mabido around the north end of Victoria Nyanza." And a
common interest established, the two became better acquainted.</p>

<p>Then Taylor introduced his two friends and later on Kelley
suggested cards. Taylor tried to find all opportunity to warn his
accomplices against the crookedness which he knew was second nature
with them.</p>

<p>He would have preferred to let Gordon win, but the estimable
Messieurs Kelley and Gootch, considering a bird in the hand worth
two in the jungle, swooped down upon the opportunity thus afforded
them to fleece their prey. The result was that after half an hour
of play Gordon rose from the table, a rather unpleasant light in
his eyes, cashed in his remaining checks and quit the game.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, old man?" queried Taylor, inwardly
cursing Gootch and Kelley.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't force an explanation if I were you," replied Gordon
coldly. "The captain might overhear."</p>

<p>Taylor flushed and Gordon walked away, which was the end of the
acquaintance upon which Taylor had based such excellent plans.</p>

<p>"You boobs are wonders," sneered Taylor. "You must have made all
of fifty dollars apiece out of it&mdash;and ruined every chance we
had to travel right to the mission in Gordon's company," and he
turned disgustedly away and sought his cabin.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">SOPHRONIA was blithely humming Dixie as she went
about her work on the second floor of the Scott house. Occasionally
she broke the monotony by engaging in heated discussions with
herself.</p>

<p>"Yassem," she said, shaking her head, "Ah never done laik dat
Mistah Scott Taylor. He may be po' Miss Do'thy's boy; but he's po'
white trash, jes' de same. Yass'm. An' look yere," as she pushed
the bed out from the wall to ply her broom beneath.</p>

<p>"Jes' look yere! Dere he's gone and lef' his coat. Shif' less,
das what he is&mdash;a throwin' his coat around laik dat," and she
seized the garment with a vigorous shake.</p>

<p>Throwing the coat across her arm, the negress carried it down to
the library, where Mrs. Scott and Virginia were sitting.</p>

<p>"Heah dat Mistah Scott Taylor's coat," she announced, laying it
on the table. "What Ah done goin' do wif it&mdash;give it to dat
good-fer-nothin' nigger Samu-el?"</p>

<p>"No, Sophronia," said Mrs. Scott, "we'll have to send it to
him," and she picked up the garment to wrap it for mailing. As she
folded it a crumpled sheet of note paper fell from a side pocket.
Virginia picked it up to replace it in the coat, when, by chance,
she saw her mother's name upon the top of the sheet.</p>

<p>"Why," she exclaimed, "this is yours, mother," and she spread
the note out, smoothing it upon the table top. "It's a letter to
you. How in the world did it happen to be in Scott's coat?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott took the note and read it; then she handed it to her
daughter. When Virginia had completed it she looked up at her
mother, her face clouded and angry.</p>

<p>"Why, the scoundrel!" she exclaimed. "He actually has been
intercepting your mail." Then she glanced again at the date line
and her eyes opened wide. "Mother!" she ejaculated. "This letter
must have come the very day Scott left in such a hurry. It must
have been because of this letter that he did leave. What can it
mean?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott shook her head.</p>

<p>"I know," announced Virginia. "He has gone to prevent Mr. Gordon
from recovering the certificate or else to follow him and obtain
possession of it himself. There could be no other explanation of
his hurried departure, immediately after the receipt of this letter."</p>

<p>"It does look that way, Virginia; but what can we do?"</p>

<p>"We can wire Mr. Gordon at once."</p>

<p>"What can we say that will not appear silly in a telegram,
unless we actually accuse Scott of criminal designs," argued Mrs.
Scott, "and we cannot do that, for we have only conjecture to base
a charge upon."</p>

<p>"I can go to New York and talk with Mr. Gordon," said Virginia,
"and that is just what I shall do."</p>

<p>"But, my dear&mdash;" Mrs. Scott started to expostulate.</p>

<p>"But I am," said Virginia determinedly, and she did.</p>

<p>To her dismay she found Mr. Richard Gordon's apartment locked
and apparently untenanted, for there was no response to her
repeated ring of the bell. Then she inquired at another apartment
across the hall. Here a house man informed her that Mr. Gordon's
man had told him that he and Mr. Gordon were leaving for
Africa&mdash;he even recalled the name of the liner upon which they
had sailed for Liverpool.</p>

<p>What was she to do? Well, the first thing was to assure herself
as to whether Scott Taylor had also sailed for Africa, and if not
to arrange to have him watched until she could get word to Mr.
Richard Gordon. The taxi that had brought her to Gordon's apartment
was waiting at the curb.</p>

<p>Descending to it, she gave the driver instructions to take her
to the office of a certain steamship company&mdash;she would
examine the passenger list and thus discover whether Taylor had
sailed on the same boat with Gordon; but after examining the list
and finding Taylor's name not among those of the passengers it
suddenly occurred to her that the man would doubtless have assumed
a name if his intentions were ulterior. Now she was in as bad a
plight as formerly.</p>

<p>She racked her brain for a solution to her problem. It would do
no good to wire Gordon, for he would not know Taylor if he saw him,
and anyway it was possible that Taylor had not followed him and
that she would only be making herself appear silly by sending
Gordon a melodramatic wireless.</p>

<p>"I only wish," she muttered to herself, "that I knew whether or
not Scott Taylor has followed him to Africa. How can I find
out?"</p>

<p>And then came a natural solution of her problem&mdash;to search
for Scott Taylor himself in New York. Her first thought was of a
city directory, and here she found a Scott Taylor with an address
on West 145th Street, and a moment later her taxi was whirling her
uptown in that direction.</p>

<p>It was with considerable trepidation that Virginia Scott mounted
the steps and rang the bell beneath the speaking tube. She feared
Taylor and knew that she was doing a risky thing in thus placing
herself even temporarily in his power; but loyalty and gratitude
toward Richard Gordon, a stranger who had put his life, maybe, in
jeopardy to serve her and her mother, insisted that she accept the
risk, and so when the latch of the front door clicked and a voice,
ignoring the speaking tube, called down from above for her to come
up, she bravely entered the dark stairway and marched upward, to
what she had no idea. She had been glad to note that the voice from
above had been that of a woman. It made her feel more at her ease;
but when she reached the topmost step and found a slovenly young
woman with bleached hair and a green kimono awaiting her, her heart
sank.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Scott Taylor live here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he ain't at home. What do you want&mdash;anything I
can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Has he left the city?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes narrowed, and Virginia noted it, but she
thought, too, that she saw a trace of fear in them. She was
convinced that this woman could tell her all she wished to know,
but how was she to get the information from her?</p>

<p>"May I come in a moment and rest?" she asked. "It's rather a
long climb up here from the street," and she smiled&mdash;one of
those delightful smiles that even a woman admires in another
woman.</p>

<p>"Sure!" said the girl. "Come right in. Don't mind how things
look. I'm here alone now and takin' it easy. You have to keep
things straightened around here when the men folks are home, or
they're always growlin'."</p>

<p>So the men folks were away!</p>

<p>"What a cute little place you have here," said Virginia. "You
are Mrs. Taylor?"</p>

<p>The girl flushed just a trifle.</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "My man's name is Kelley. Mr. Taylor boards
with us when he's in town."</p>

<p>And afterward when she addressed her as Mrs. Kelley, Virginia
could not but note an odd expression around the corners of the
girl's mouth.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Taylor out of town now?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>The girl looked her straight in the eyes for a moment before she
replied.</p>

<p>"Say, look here," she demanded at last. "What's your game? Who
are you, anyhow, and what's your idea in doin' all this rubberin'
after Kid Taylor?"</p>

<p>For a moment Virginia did not know what answer to make, and
then, impulsively, she decided to tell this girl a part of her
conjectures at least, in the hope that either sympathy for Gordon
or fear of the consequences upon Taylor would enlist her services
in Virginia's behalf.</p>

<p>There was that in the girl's face which convinced Virginia that
beneath the soiled green kimono and evidences of dissipation in the
old-young face there lay a kind heart and a generous disposition.
And so she told her.</p>

<p>Her story was not all news to Blanche. She had heard most of it
from Taylor's lips. When Virginia had finished the girl sat
glowering sullenly at the floor for several seconds. At last she
looked up.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, "what strings Kid Taylor has on me. He
ain't never done nothing except to egg Jim on first to one job and
then to another that Taylor didn't have the nerve to pull off
himself. Jim's been to the Island once already for a job that
Taylor worked up an' then sat right here drinkin' high-balls an'
tryin' to flozzie up to me while Jim and Bill were out gettin'
pinched.</p>

<p>"An' now&mdash;" she paused, a startled look coming into her
eyes. "An' now he's framed up a murder for them, 'cause he ain't
got the nerve to do it himself."</p>

<p>"You mean," cried Virginia, "that they have really followed Mr.
Gordon to Africa to murder him?" Blanche nodded, affirmatively.
Then she leaned forward toward her caller.</p>

<p>"I've told you," she said, "because I thought you might find a
way to stop them before they did it. I don't want Jim sent to the
chair. He's always been good to me. But for Gawd's sake don't let
them know I told you. Bill 'ud kill me, an' Jim 'ud quit me, I'd
care more about that than the other. You won't tell, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Virginia, "I won't. Now, tell me, they sailed on the
same boat as Mr. Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jim and Bill and Taylor, an' they were goin' to follow
Gordon until he got the paper, then croak him an' take it away an'
say it was an accident or something."</p>

<p>Virginia Scott rose from the chair upon which she had been
sitting. Outwardly she was calm and collected, but inwardly her
thoughts were in a confused and hysterical jumble in which horror
predominated. What was she to do?</p>

<p>How helpless she was to avert the grim tragedy. She thought of
cabling Gordon, but when she suggested the plan to Blanche the girl
pointed out that it was too late&mdash;Gordon must already have
left the end of the railroad and be well upon his way into the
interior.</p>

<p>For a moment Virginia stood in silence. Then she held out her
hand to the young woman.</p>

<p>"I thank you," she said. "You have done right to tell me all
that you have. Goodbye!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Blanche.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," replied Virginia. "I want to
think&mdash;maybe a solution will come."</p>

<p>And as she was driving back to her hotel the solution did
come&mdash;in the crystallization of a determination to take the
saving of Richard Gordon into her own hands. It was for her that he
was risking his life. She would be a coward to do one whit less
than her plain duty. There was no one upon whom she could call to
do this thing for her, since she realized that whoever attempted it
must risk his life in pitting himself against Taylor and his
confederates&mdash;desperate men who already had planned upon one
murder in the furtherance of their dishonorable purpose.</p>

<p>She thought of writing her mother first; but deliberation
assured her that her parent would do everything in her power to
prevent the carrying out of a scheme which Virginia herself knew to
be little short of madness&mdash;and yet she could think of no
other way. No, she would wait until it was too late to recall her
before she let her mother know her purpose.</p>

<p>So instead of returning at once to her hotel, Virginia drove to
the offices of a transatlantic steamship company, where she made
inquiries as to sailings and connections for Mombasa, Africa. To
her delight she discovered that by sailing the following morning,
she could make direct connections at Liverpool. Once committed to
her plan she permitted no doubts to weaken her determination, but
booked her passage immediately and returned uptown to make
purchases and obtain currency and a letter of credit through a
banker friend of her grandfather.</p>

<p>The morning that she sailed she posted a long letter to her
mother in which she explained her plans fully, and frankly stated
that she had intentionally left her mother in ignorance of them
until now for fear she would find the means to prevent their
consummation.</p>

<p>"I know that, to say the least," she wrote, "the thing that I am
going to do is most unconventional and I realize also that it is
not unfraught with dangers; but I cannot see a total stranger
sacrifice his life in our service without a willingness to make an
equal sacrifice, if necessary, in his."</p>

<p>And when her mother read the letter, though her heart was heavy
with fear and sorrow, she felt that her daughter had done no more
than the honor of the Scotts demanded.</p>

<p>To Virginia the long journey seemed an eternity, but at last it
came to an end and she found herself negotiating with an agent at
Mabido for native porters and guards and the considerable outfit
necessary to African travel. From this man she learned that Gordon
had left for the interior a month before, but he had not heard of a
man by the name of Taylor, though there had been, he said, another
party of three Americans who had followed Gordon by about a week.
These had been bound for Victoria Nyanza to hunt, and the agent
smiled as he recalled their evident unfamiliarity with all things
pertaining to their avocation.</p>

<p>Virginia asked him to describe these men, and in the description
of one she recognized Taylor, and rightly guessed that the others
were Kelley and Gootch. So three men, one of them an unprincipled
scoundrel, had gone out into the savage, lawless wilds on the trail
of Richard Gordon!</p>

<p>Virginia went cold as the fear swept her that she was too late.
Further questioning of the agent revealed the fact that while
Gordon and the other three had arrived simultaneously they had had
no intercourse, and that Gordon had obtained considerable start on
the others because of his familiarity with customs of African
travel and the utter ignorance of the others of the first
essentials of their requirements.</p>

<p>This hope sustained her; that Gordon with his superior knowledge
and experience had been able to outdistance the others, and that
she, by traveling light and carefully selecting her path, might
overtake them before they overtook Gordon or met him upon his
return.</p>

<p>With this idea in mind Virginia hastened her preparations, and
once on the march urged her safari on to utmost speed. Almost from
the start she discovered that her head man, while apparently loyal
to her, had but meagre control of the men of the safari, who were
inclined to be insubordinate and quarrelsome. The result was that
to her other burdens was added constant apprehension from this
source, since it not only threatened her own welfare but the
success of her mission as well.</p>

<p>It was upon the tenth day that the first really flagrant breach
of discipline occurred&mdash;one which the headman could not handle
or the girl permit to pass unnoticed. The men had long been
grumbling at the forced marching which had fallen to their lot
since the very beginning, notwithstanding the fact that they had
been employed with the distinct understanding that such was to be
the nature of their duty. Today, after the mid-day rest, the
porters were unusually slow in shouldering their packs, and there
was much muttering and grumbling as the headman went among them
trying to enforce his commands by means of all manner of terrible
threats. Some of the men had risen sullenly and adjusted their
burdens, others still sat upon the ground eyeing the headman, but
making no move to obey him. Virginia was at a little distance
waiting for the safari to set out. She was a witness to all which
transpired. She saw a hulking black Hercules slowly raise his pack
in laggard response to the commands of the excited headman.</p>

<p>Just what words passed between them she could not know, but
suddenly the porter hurled his load to the ground, shouting to the
others who had already assumed their burdens. One by one these
followed his example, at the same time shouting taunts and insults
at the frantic, dancing, futile headman.</p>

<p>The armed members of the party&mdash;the native
escort&mdash;leaned on their rifles and grinned at the discomfiture
of the headman.</p>

<p>Virginia's heart sank as she witnessed this open break. It was
mutiny, pure and simple, and her headman was quite evidently wholly
incapable of coping with it. That it would quickly spread to the
armed guard she was sure, for their attitude proclaimed that their
sympathies were with the porters. Something must be done, and done
at once, nor was there another than herself to do it.</p>

<p>The headman and the large porter were wrangling in high pitched
voices. The other porters had closed in about the two, for it was
evident that they would soon come to blows. The attitude of all the
bearers was angry and sullen. The members of the safari still
grinned&mdash;this was the only reassuring symptom of the whole
dangerous affair. They had not yet openly espoused the cause of the
mutineers.</p>

<p>Virginia came to a decision quietly. She crossed the space
between herself and the porters at a rapid walk, shouldering her
way between the watchers until she stood between the headman and
the bellicose porter. At sight of her they stopped their wrangling
for a moment. Virginia turned to the headman.</p>

<p>"Tell this boy," she said, "that I say he must pick up his pack
at once."</p>

<p>The headman interpreted her order to the mutineer. The latter
only laughed derisively, making no move to obey. Very deliberately
Virginia drew her revolver from its holster at her hip. She
levelled it at the pit of the porter's stomach, and with a finger
of her left hand pointed at the pack on the ground. She said
nothing. She knew that size had committed herself to a policy which
might necessitate the fulfillment of the threat which the leveled
weapon implied, and she was ready to adhere to the policy to the
bitter end.</p>

<p>The fate of her expedition hung upon the outcome of this clash
between her porters and her representative, the headman; and upon
the fate of the expedition hung, possibly, the very life of a
stranger who had placed himself in jeopardy to serve her. There was
no alternative&mdash;she must, she would compel subordination.</p>

<p>The porter made no move to assume his burden, but he ceased to
laugh. Instead, his little eyes narrowed, his heavy lower jaw and
pendulous lower lip drooped sullenly.</p>

<p>He reminded the girl suddenly of a huge brute about to spring
upon its prey, and she tightened the pressure of her finger upon
the trigger of her revolver.</p>

<p>"Tell him," she instructed the headman, "that punishment for
mutiny is death. That if he does not pick up his pack at once I
shall shoot him, just as I would shoot a hyena that menaced my
safety."</p>

<p>The headman did as he was bid. The porter looked at the
encircling faces of his friends for encouragement. He thought that
he found it there and then an evil spirit whispered to him that the
white woman would not dare shoot and he took a step toward her
threateningly.</p>

<p>It was his last step, for the instant that he took it Virginia
fired, not at his stomach, but at his heart&mdash;and he crumpled
forward to tumble at her feet. Without a second glance at him she
wheeled upon the other porters.</p>

<p>"Pick up your packs and march!" she commanded, and those who
could not understand her words at least did not misinterpret the
menace of her levelled weapon. One by one, and with greater
alacrity than they had evinced since the first day out, they
shouldered their burdens, and a moment later were filing along the
trail. The safari still grinned, for which Virginia was devoutly
thankful.</p>

<p>From then on she became her own headman, using that dignitary
principally as an interpreter, nor for many days was there again
the slightest show of insubordination&mdash;that came later, with
results so disastrous that&mdash;but why anticipate disaster?</p>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">FAR to the west Richard Gordon had penetrated the
jungle to the site of the ruined mission. He had scraped around the
woods which overgrew the razed walls of the bungalow, and at last
he had come upon the flagging of the old hearth.</p>

<p>Stone after stone he pried from its place until beneath one he
at last came upon a tiny vault, and a moment later his groping
fingers touched a rusted tin box that crumpled beneath them.
Feeling carefully amid the debris, Gordon finally withdrew a long
manila envelope which had withstood the ravages of time. It was
still sealed, nor did he break it open, for it was all the box
contained other than a few loose pieces of jewelry and therefore
must contain the paper he sought.</p>

<p>Dick Gordon was elated by the success of his adventure. He had
feared that even the old hearth might have disappeared and the
paper with it, for he had no means of knowing how complete had been
the Wakandas' demolition of the mission, as upon his former visit
he had seen no sign of the old chimney and fireplace.</p>

<p>Early the following morning he set out upon the return journey
toward the coast, confident that no further obstacles other than
those ordinary to African travel lay between him and the delivery
of the packet safely into the hands of Mrs. Scott.</p>

<p>How could he guess that to the east of him three American
crooks, bent upon nothing less than his death, barred his way to
the coast. That they were making short marches and slow ones was of
little moment to the three. They soon had tired of the hardships of
African travel, and finally gave up the hope of overtaking Gordon
before he reached the mission. To waylay him upon his return would
answer their purpose quite as well, and so when they came at last
to a village through which Gordon must pass upon his return to the
coast it required little discussion of the question to decide them
to await him there.</p>

<p>In view of generous gifts the native chief welcomed them to his
hospitality. He set aside a commodious hut for the three whites.
They unstoppered numerous bottles of Irish whiskey and the blacks
brewed their native beer. The visit was a long-drawn Bacchanalian
revel which the whites found more to their tastes than long,
tiresome marches and the vicissitudes of ever changing camps.</p>

<p>But one day the peace of the community was rudely startled. A
lion seized upon an unwary woman working in a little patch of
cultivated ground outside the village. Her screams brought out the
warriors and the whites; but the lion dragged his prey into the
jungle, her screaming ceased, nor was she ever seen again.</p>

<p>The natives were terrified. They besought the whites to help
them&mdash;to go forth with their guns and slay the man-eater; but
though they hunted for two days no trace of the marauder could they
find. Then the blacks dug a pit and baited it with a live goat, and
lest the lion escape even this they set a watch upon the pit that
the whites might be called when the lion approached.</p>

<p>Nor did they have long to wait. Scarce had they secreted
themselves when a huge lion stepped majestically from the brush.
Raising his massive head he sniffed the air. His lower jaw rose and
fell. The slaver drivelled from his jowls. Deep in his throat
rumbled a low thunder, and presently at his side appeared a sleek
lioness.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood thus, their yellow eyes sometimes boring
straight ahead as though to pierce the thickets behind which the
trembling natives crouched, or again moving slowly up and down the
trail.</p>

<p>Presently the lion's head went up in a quick movement of
arrested attention. Instantly he froze to rigid immobility. His
sensitive nostrils dilated and contracted, the tip of his tail
moved. Aside from these he might have been chiselled from living
gold, so magnificent he was.</p>

<p>Up wind, in a little clearing, two antelope browsed. Now and
again the graceful male raised his horned head to sniff the air;
his great wondering eyes scanning the surrounding jungle. Then he
would lower his muzzle again and resume his feeding, yet ears and
nose were always upon the alert.</p>

<p>The Judas breeze, kissing the soft coats of the antelope as it
passed, bore down to the nostrils of the lions the evidence of the
near presence of flesh&mdash;of tender, juicy, succulent, red
flesh. The king turned his royal head once toward his consort. A
sound that was half sigh breathed from his great throat. Was it a
message&mdash;a command? Who may say? The lioness settled herself
into a comfortable position in the long grass and her lord moved
silently away, up wind toward the unconscious antelope.</p>

<p>A moment later an excited native detached himself from the
watchers and sped away toward the village to notify the whites that
the lions had come. Taylor, Kelley and Gootch caught up their
rifles and followed the guide back toward the pit. At their heels
was half the male population of the village, armed with short,
heavy spears; but the chief, who had hunted lions with white men
many times before, sent them all back with the exception of three
who carried the whites' extra guns. There had been enough before to
have frightened all the lions out of the country.</p>

<p>Even so, the white men themselves, clumsy in this unaccustomed
work, made noise enough to bring the lioness to her feet as they
crawled into the bushes besides the watchers. When finally they saw
her she was standing head on gazing nervously toward their hiding
place. It was evident that she was uneasy, and the old chief knew
that in an instant she would bolt.</p>

<p>What had held her so long in the face of the noise of the
awkward white men he could not guess.</p>

<p>"Shoot!" he whispered. "Quick!"</p>

<p>Already the lioness was wheeling to depart when the three rifles
spoke. Only one bullet struck the target, but that one was enough
to transform the timid jungle creature into a mad engine of rage
and destruction. Turning like a cat and growling horribly, the
lioness charged without an instant's warning straight down upon the
cover that hid her foes.</p>

<p>It was the first time in their lives that any one of the white
men had seen a charging lioness, and it was too much for the dope
shattered nerves of Kelley and Gootch. Flinging away their rifles,
they turned and ran like scared rabbits, their gun bearers and
watchers near them surprised into panic at the unwonted sight of
terror-struck white men emulating their example.</p>

<p>Only Taylor, his gun bearer and the chief held their ground.
Taylor was frightened&mdash;few men are not in the face of a
charging lion, especially if it be their first; but the blood of
the Scotts flowed in his veins, and whatever else he might be, he
was not a physical coward.</p>

<p>In the moment that ensued he took careful aim and fired again,
and this time the lioness stopped&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>Taylor drew a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Great beads of perspiration stood upon his forehead. He wiped
them away, and as he attempted to arise he noticed that his knees
were weak and trembling. It wouldn't do for the chief to see that,
so he sat down again and rolled a cigarette.</p>

<p>By the time the frightened ones had been recalled he was able to
control his muscles. Gootch and Kelley came with their tails
between their legs, like whipped curs.</p>

<p>"You guys missed your call," laughed Taylor. "You ought to have
been lion tamers."</p>

<p>The twain grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I'll see that hell-cat face in my dreams for the rest of my
natural life," said Kelley.</p>

<p>Gootch shrugged with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Me for Broadway and the Tammany tiger&mdash;it doesn't make
such awful faces," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, let's go back to the village and have a drink on my first
lion," suggested Taylor, and the three departed, leaving the
natives to rig a sling and carry the body of the lioness in.</p>

<p>When the lion left his mate he made his way stealthily in the
direction of his quarry. Now and again he stopped to raise his head
and sniff the air, or with up-pricked ears to listen.</p>

<p>Ahead of him, the buck, uneasy, though he had as yet located no
enemy, moved slowly off, followed by his doe. Craftily the lion
trailed them by scent. Presently he came within sight of them but
they were on the move, and the ground was not such as to favor a
charge. So he stalked them&mdash;cautiously, warily,
silently&mdash;the personification of majesty, of power, of
stealth. He stalked them for a long time, until they halted again
to browse upon the edge of a little plain, and then his majesty,
wearied and impatient, ventured a charge from too great a
distance.</p>

<p>Like a bolt he broke from the concealing jungle. With a speed
that is only a lion's when it charges he sped toward them&mdash;and
still all unconscious they fed on. It was the doe who first looked
up, and then two streaks of bay brown fled before the tawny, yellow
flash. It was soon over.</p>

<p>A dozen or more bounds convinced the great cat that he had lost,
and with an angry roar he halted to glare for a moment after his
disappearing feast, and then to turn, still rumbling, back into the
forest toward his mate.</p>

<p>He came, shortly, to the spot where he had left his mate, but
she was not there. He called to her, but she did not answer. Then
he sniffed about. The scent of man was still heavy in the air, and
the acrid odor of powder clung to the grasses and the branches,
and&mdash;what was that, blood? The smell of blood? The lion
crossed and recrossed the trail. He walked about sniffing, and at
last he came upon the spot where his mate had died. A great roar
broke from his mighty lungs. He smelled about the trampled grasses.
Blacks! And what is this, the scent spoor of whites? The blacks
were familiar denizens of the jungle. He thought little of them one
way or another. Sometimes he ate them for they were stupid
creatures easily overcome: but the whites! He had had experience of
them before&mdash;of them and their acrid smoke and their painful
bullets. His forearm had been creased by one and the scar still
plainly showed.</p>

<p>The whites! How he hated them! Down went his nose to the trail.
Which way had they gone? He would follow and avenge. Straight along
the crooked jungle pathway led the spoor. Rumbling in his throat
the lion followed, all engrossed in hate and rage, so that he did
not see the trap until it was too late. Suddenly there was a giving
of the trail beneath his feet, with a snapping of small
branches.</p>

<p>He clawed and tried to leap to safety, but in vain. The earth
sank from beneath him, and snarling and beating with his armed feet
he dropped into the blackness of the pit that had been dug for him.
Nor, for all his great strength and cunning could he escape.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>It was mid-afternoon, following a long march, that Virginia and
her safari came upon a village where the headman had told her they
would be well received and could doubtless trade for fowl and goats
and vegetables. The prospect was alluring, for during the past week
her hunters had been vouchsafed the poorest luck. Goat and chicken
would taste good. Virginia's mouth watered. The mouths of her boys
watered too; but not so much for goat and chickens as for the
native beer for which this village was justly famous.</p>

<p>The chief was away when the visitors arrived, but his wife and
son did honors in his stead. They, as well as the balance of the
villagers, evinced the greatest curiosity. But few of them had ever
seen a white woman before, and they clustered about her, feeling
her flesh and garments, laughing uproariously at each new
discovery, but according her every mark of friendship. At last,
with difficulty, Virginia succeeded in arranging through her
headman for a hut to which she might retire; but even here the
women and children followed her, squatting about watching her every
move. The interior of the hut was filthy, and the girl had been in
it but a short time when she decided to summon her headman and have
her tent and camp pitched outside the village.</p>

<p>When she went to find him, for she could not make any of the
women understand her wants, she discovered him, with others of her
safari, indulging freely in beer. Already they had consumed large
quantities, and, with an unlimited supply in view, were loath to
leave the immediate vicinity of the brew for the sake of pitching
camps for her or for anyone else.</p>

<p>As she stood arguing with them through the headman she was
suddenly aware of the approach of newcomers from the jungle. A
little party of men were entering the village gates, and her heart
gave a great leap of joy as she saw a white man among them. She had
started forward impulsively toward him, half believing that it
might be Richard Gordon, when she saw two other whites behind him,
and recognized one of them immediately as Taylor. Her heart sank as
she realized the predicament in which she had unwittingly placed
herself. Taylor, seeing her here, would not need to be told to know
what had brought her, and now, just when she most needed the
loyalty of her boys, they were on the high road to inebriation.</p>

<p>She turned toward them quickly, however, placing herself behind
them, out of sight of the advancing whites.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she whispered to the headman. "You must get the boys
together at once. We will continue the march. Those men who have
just entered the village are my enemies. Tell the boys of the
safari to get their guns&mdash;we may need them; but I must get out
of this village at once."</p>

<p>The headman transmitted her commands to the porters and the
safari, but they elicited only grumbling murmurs at first, and,
when she urged her authority upon them, they openly refused to move
from where they were. They said that they had marched far that
day&mdash;they could go no further&mdash;they would not go further,
and one who had consumed more beer than his fellows announced that
he would take no more orders from a woman. And just then Scott
Taylor came abreast the party and when his eyes fell upon Virginia
Scott they went wide in incredulity and wonder.</p>

<p>"Virginia!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from? What on earth are you doing here?" And
then as though he had guessed the answer his eyes narrowed and a
lowering scowl clouded his face. "You've been following me, have
you? Spying on me, eh? You think you can put one over on me, do
you? Well, you've got another think coming, young lady."</p>

<p>Virginia Scott looked coldly at the speaker, utter contempt in
the curve of her lip and the expression of her level eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I followed you, Scott," she replied. "I know you all too
well, you see, not to have guessed something of the ulterior motive
which prompted you to come to Africa immediately upon the heels of
Mr. Gordon. We found his letter to mother, you see, in your coat
pocket, the coat that you accidentally dropped behind your bed
before you left. If you will take my advice, Scott, you will take
yourself and your precious friends here back to the coast and out
of Africa as fast as you can go."</p>

<p>Taylor had been thinking rapidly as the girl spoke, yet he was
at a loss what step to take next. If she knew that he had followed
Gordon to Africa then her mother knew it too, and whatever harm
might befall Gordon here would be laid at his door even though he
found the means to quiet Virginia. The means to quiet Virginia! The
thought kept running through his head over and over again. The
means to quiet Virginia!</p>

<p>He gave his head a little shake as he let his eyes rest on the
girl's face again. She was very beautiful&mdash;even more beautiful
in her khaki and tan than she had been in the soft summer dresses
and clear white complexion of the Virginia days.</p>

<p>"Will you take that chance and go?" she asked presently. "I
promise that I will say no word of this that will harm you. Each of
us is half Scott&mdash;I would not willingly harm my own blood, nor
will I see you penniless when the estate comes into my hands."</p>

<p>The mention of the estate brought Taylor up with a start. It
also brought a gleam into the eyes of Kelley and Gootch, who had
been interested listeners to the conversation. Kelley leaned toward
Taylor.</p>

<p>"If you go back, Kid," he asked, "who's goin' to pay me an' Bill
the hundred thou apiece?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going back, you fool," snapped Taylor. "I've come too
damned far to go back now."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Scott?" Virginia asked the question
in an even voice. She well knew the moment was fraught with hideous
possibilities for her.</p>

<p>"The first thing I'm going to do," growled Taylor, "is to put
you where you can be watched, and where you won't get another
chance to go and blab all you know or think to Mr. Buttinski
Gordon."</p>

<p>He stepped quickly to the girl's side as he spoke, and, though
she reached for her revolver his hand was too quick for her and the
weapon was wrenched from her grasp before she could use it, as use
it, she most certainly should, had she the opportunity. Taylor
seized her wrist and he stood there holding her, scowling down into
her face. Virginia returned the scowl, and spoke a single word,
loud enough for the other whites to hear.</p>

<p>"Coward!" That single word was filled with loathing and contempt
supreme. It stung the man as would no torrent of invective. It
stung and roused all the brute within him.</p>

<p>With an oath he jerked the girl roughly after him as he turned
and crossed the village street. Straight toward the hut occupied by
himself and his two associates he dragged her, and at his heels
came Kelley and Gootch.</p>

<p>"Get a rope," snapped Taylor when they were inside. "We'll truss
this vixen until we can plan what's best for her. And anyway we
haven't had that drink yet on my first lion."</p>

<p>Gootch found a rope and together the three men bound the girl
securely. Then they went out of the hut, taking a bottle of whiskey
with them.</p>

<p>After they had left Virginia exerted every effort to free
herself of her bonds; but strain as she would she could not slip
them an inch. The afternoon wore on. She could hear loud talk and
laughter of the drinking whites and blacks, and she trembled as she
thought what the return of those three, flushed with drink, might
mean to her.</p>

<p>And night fell and still she lay a prey to grim terror and the
physical tortures of her bonds and the unclean mats upon which they
had thrown her.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">SWINGING along at the head of his safari, Dick
Gordon puffed upon his blackened briar and hummed a gay tune of the
roof gardens. The black boys at his heels laughed and chattered and
sang. They were a merry party, for Gordon had a way with him that
kept men singing at their work until they forgot that it was work.
He could get more miles out of a safari than many a hardened and
hard, old explorer, for he treated his boys like children, humoring
or punishing as seemed best, but never permitting an injustice,
never nursing an irritation, and never letting them forget that he
was master. From headman to meanest porter they loved him,
respected him, each thought that he would wade through blood for
the big, singing bwana; but they were soon to find that it was
easier to think than to wade when the chances were even that the
blood might be their own.</p>

<p>They were nearing a native village where beer flowed like water,
and Gordon, having had one previous experience of that place and
the effects that it had upon his men for two consecutive marches,
had decided to camp short of the village and pass it on the fly
next morning.</p>

<p>They had come almost to the spot he had selected for their camp,
when the roar of a lion, almost at his feet, brought Gordon to a
sudden stop at the verge of a pit cunningly hid in the trail. A
hole a few paces further on showed where the lion had disappeared
and why he was roaring thus up out of the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>Gordon approached and peered into the excavation. There below
him crouched a huge, black maned lion. At Gordon's elbow was his
gun bearer. To turn and grasp the ready rifle was the work of but a
moment, but when he had raised the weapon to his shoulder and
levelled it upon the beast below him something brought him to a
sudden stop. His men were gathered about the pit now throwing
taunts and insults at the beast.</p>

<p>"Poor devil," thought Gordon. "It's a shame to pot you like this
without a chance for your life&mdash;" He paused and
then&mdash;"I'm damned if I'll do it."</p>

<p>Young Mr. Gordon was, as you may have guessed, a creature of
impulse. He was wont to act first and think later, which is a
mighty fine way to do the right thing if one is inherently right at
heart, and doesn't chance to be laboring under the insidious toxin
of anger. Then, too, Dick Gordon loved animals, and particularly he
loved the great fierce cats of the jungle. To him there was no more
inspiring sight than that of a mighty lion, and as he looked at the
one below him, even in the dim light of the pit, he realized that
never before had his eyes rested upon so magnificent a creature as
this great, black-maned prisoner. He lowered his rifle and turned
toward his headman.</p>

<p>"Let's have a little fun," he said.</p>

<p>"It's not sport to shoot a lion in a pit. I never have, and I
never shall. We'll let this old boy out where he'll have a run for
his money and then I can take a little pride in his skin when I get
it home."</p>

<p>The headman grinned. He was something of a sport himself, but
not when it came to lions.</p>

<p>"How you get him out, bwana?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gordon examined the pit. Its roof was constructed of several
stout saplings crossed with lesser branches and brush. To drag a
couple of the larger logs until their ends dropped into the pit
would be the work of but a moment, then the lion could clamber out
if he were not injured, and there was nothing in his appearance or
manner to indicate that he was not entirely whole.</p>

<p>Gordon explained his plan to the headman and gave his orders for
the porters to lay aside their loads and drag the poles far enough
to let their ends drop into the pit. The men grinned and shrugged,
and looked for handy trees, for they knew that a maddened lion is
lightning unchained. Gingerly they laid hold of the saplings and
commenced to haul upon them, but when the ends had come to the
pit's verge and were about to drop down and liberate the lion they
paused, still grinning, though sheepishly, and begged to be
excused, as it were. The headman explained to Gordon that the lion
would be sure to get one of the men at least and he thought that it
would be a useless waste of life when they already had the lion
safely imprisoned and nothing gained by liberating him.</p>

<p>Gordon shrugged good-naturedly. "You Li'le A'thas can take to
the trees," he said, "and hurry up about it. I'm going to let loose
this man-eating son of Belial," and he grasped the end of one of
the logs and proceeded to pull.</p>

<p>The blacks, seeing his act, tarried not for even a free
translation of his words, but scampered to right and left,
clambering to the safety of the lower branches with the agility of
monkeys. Only Gordon's gun bearer remained at his post. The young
man, seeing him, directed the boy to place his rifle a few paces to
his right where he could take it up and fire should it be
necessary.</p>

<p>"Lean it against that tree over there," he directed. "After I
drop the logs down I can reach it before the lion can climb out, if
he is inclined to be nasty instead of grateful."</p>

<p>The boy, glad enough to be relieved of his duty, though he would
have remained at his post in the face of a dozen lions had Gordon
not dismissed him, did as he was bid, himself taking refuge in the
tree at the base of which he leaned the rifle, cocked and ready to
his master's hand.</p>

<p>Gordon measured the distance between the pit and the tree with
his eyes, and calculated that even though the lion charged after
climbing from his prison it would take him a moment or two to reach
level ground and with that advantage Gordon could easily reach his
rifle and bring the beast down before it was upon him.</p>

<p>The element of risk in the adventure appealed to the young New
Yorker. He would be pitting his own skill and prowess against the
skill and prowess of the lion. The animal would have an almost even
break with him, for if Gordon failed to stop him with his first
shot the victory would be to the great cat. This was sport! Gordon
felt a thrill of excitement tingling along his nerves as he drew
slowly upon the end of one of the logs.</p>

<p>Below him the lion stood motionless glaring up into his face,
and uttering occasional low growls. As he worked Gordon glanced
often at the great beast, admiring his splendid stature, his great
mane and his massive head. The lion was wondering if this creature
was one of those who had slain his mate. What was he doing? Why was
he pulling the cover from his prison? Why had the loud noise and
the acrid odor that accompanied these white skinned humans not yet
assailed his ears and nostrils? The lion was puzzled. He cocked his
head upon one side, watching intently&mdash;so intently that he
forgot to growl.</p>

<p>Gordon dragged the end of one of the logs until it just hung
upon the rim of the pit, then he drew its fellow to the same
position. A single, quick, heavy pull upon the two together should
precipitate the ends into the bottom of the trap.</p>

<p>Dick Gordon glanced behind him once more that he might finally
fix in his mind the exact location of his rifle, then he surged
back with a firm grip upon the logs, the dirt at the opposite end
of the pit crumbled from the edge and the two logs dropped their
further extremities side by side to the bottom.</p>

<p>At the same instant Gordon turned and ran for his rifle. The
lion leaped nimbly to one side to avoid the falling logs, instantly
grasped their significance to him and with an agile leap was upon
them and at the edge of the pit by the time Gordon had covered half
the distance to the tree where his gun leaned, ready to his
hand.</p>

<p>Seeing the man fleeing the lion gave a single terrific roar and
burst into the full speed of the charge. The natives in the trees
screamed loudly to Gordon, the man turned his head, thinking the
lion must be already upon him, and in the little instant that his
eyes were taken from his path, his foot caught in the protruding
root of a creeper and he was down.</p>

<p>But for this he might have reached his weapon and put in one
good shot. Even now he had to scramble to his feet and race on; but
even as he half rose a great body struck him from behind and hurled
him back to earth&mdash;a great, tawny, hairy body that towered
above him grim and terrible.</p>

<p>A thousand thoughts raced through Dick Gordon's mind in the
brief instant the lion stood over him. He thought of his revolver
and his knife in their holsters at his side&mdash;as a last resort
he would use them. He had heard of men being in positions similar
to his own and escaping unharmed&mdash;of the lions leaving them
for some unaccountable reason without inflicting even a scratch
upon them. Gordon determined to wait until the lion took the
offensive. He lay very quietly, just as he had fallen, half upon
his side.</p>

<p>One great forepaw was opposite his face, for the lion straddled
him. Gordon even noted the ugly, jagged scar upon the inside of the
forearm. The boys in the trees were shouting and hurling branches
at the huge beast. The animal paid no more attention to them than
as though they had been so many little monkeys. He lowered his
mighty head and sniffed the body of his prey.</p>

<p>Gordon could feel the muzzle touching his back lightly, and the
hot breath upon his neck and cheek. The lion puzzled. This was not
one of those whom he sought. For several minutes that seemed an
eternity to Gordon the beast stood above him.</p>

<p>What was he thinking? Could it be that he was searching through
his savage brain for an explanation of the man's act in releasing
him from captivity? Who may say? But this we do know, that with one
great paw he turned Gordon over on his back, sniffed him from head
to foot, looked straight into his face for a full minute and then
turned and stalked majestically down the trail, leaving unharmed
the puny creature whose career one closing of those mighty jaws
would have terminated forever.</p>

<p>Scarce believing that he could credit his own senses, Gordon
rose slowly to his feet and gazed after the lion. Behind him his
boy slid from the tree, and, seizing Gordon's rifle, ran forward
and thrust it into the man's hand. Thus awakened from the stupor of
the shock he had received, Gordon mechanically threw the weapon to
the hollow of his shoulder. Quickly the sights covered a spot in
the middle of the beast's back just behind the shoulders, the
trigger finger pressed slowly back. The blacks, all silent now,
awaited in breathless expectancy the shot that was never fired.</p>

<p>For a moment Gordon stood thus like a statue. Then, with an
impatient shake of his head he lowered the weapon.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," he muttered. "The beast could have killed me
but didn't. If I killed him now I'd be less than a beast. I wonder
why he left us? Could it have been gratitude? Shucks. Gratitude
nothing! He wasn't hungry, or else the boys frightened him away,"
and at the latter thought Gordon could not repress a grin as he
recalled the great carnivore's apparent utter contempt for the
yelling natives.</p>

<p>And as he stood watching the leisurely departure of the king
until he was hidden by a turn in the trail the belief that it might
have been gratitude insisted upon intruding itself upon his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Anyway," he said half aloud, "it'll make a pretty story, even
if it's not the true explanation."</p>

<p>His boys had all descended from their trees by this time and
were grouped about him, chattering to one another, and loudly
expatiating upon the wondrous feats of bravery they would have
performed&mdash;"if&mdash;" Gordon broke in upon their
afterclap.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "Take up your packs. We ought to be near the
stream that passes beside the beer village&mdash;we'll make camp as
soon as we strike it."</p>

<p>A half hour later they found a suitable spot for their camp, and
Gordon, protected by a mosquito net, stretched himself in his
hammock to enjoy the luxuries of a pipe and a book before the
evening meal should be prepared.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Exhausted from her struggles to free herself from her bonds,
Virginia lay in dumb misery listening to the sounds of revel
without. The blacks were dancing now. Their hideous yells
reverberated through the forest. The dancing light from the great
fire they had built to illuminate the scene of their orgy rose and
fell fitfully across the open entrance of the hut in which the girl
lay.</p>

<p>Her own men would be joining in the mad revel, she well knew. No
use to appeal to them. Already they had shown the calibre of their
loyalty. Only the headman had remained at all staunch in his fealty
to her and he was a weak vessel even when sober.</p>

<p>Now that he was drunk, as he doubtless was, she could not appeal
to him with any hope of a response.</p>

<p>Now and again she heard the voices of the white men, maudlin
from drink. She shuddered as she contemplated their return to the
hut. Again she struggled vainly with her bonds. Hope was well nigh
extinguished, for what hope could there be for her among these wild
savages, and cruel, relentless whites?</p>

<p>As the blacks danced and the whites drank with them, another
creature than Virginia Scott heard the Bacchanalian noises of their
drunken revel. A great, black-maned lion, grim and silent, prowled
about the palisade, sniffing and listening.</p>

<p>Now and again he would halt, with his head cocked upon one side
and his ears up-pricked. Then he would resume his tireless pacing.
Round and round the outside of the enclosure he paced his stealthy
beat.</p>

<p>Occasionally a low, a very low moan, escaped his lips&mdash;a
weird, blood-freezing moan that, happily for the peace of mind of
the revelers, was drowned by their own hideous noises. What were
his intentions? That he seemed searching for something or someone
was evident. Once or twice he paused and lifting his head measured
the distance to the top of the palisade. To the very gates had he
followed the spoor of the white men who had slain his mate. For
them he had come. Were they within? He could not catch their scent;
but though he had circled the palisaded village several times his
sensitive nostrils had discovered no spoor fresher than that which
ended at the village gates. His brute sense told him that they must
be within. Why did he hesitate? He was no coward; but neither was
he any fool. He knew the powers and the purpose of guns and spears,
and he knew too that once within the palisade with the man-people,
while all were awake, he might be killed before he had accomplished
the revenge upon which he was bent, and so he bided his
time&mdash;a fierce and terrible thing, padding noiselessly through
the black night just beyond the palisade.</p>

<p>The night wore slowly on. Less and less became the sounds of
revelry as one by one the blacks succumbed to the influence of
their native beer and the white man's whiskey. Presently Taylor
rose unsteadily and made his way toward his hut, staggering little,
for it was his boast that he could carry his load like a
gentleman.</p>

<p>Virginia, wide eyed and sleepless, saw him approaching. In the
extremity of her fear she rolled to the far side of the hut to lie
there silent and motionless in the hope that he had forgotten her
presence and would not notice her. Taylor sober might be appealed
to in the morning.</p>

<p>There must be a fibre of chivalry somewhere in the soul of any
man in whose veins flowed the honored blood of the Scotts; but
Taylor drunk would be adamant to any influence of his passions.</p>

<p>From the darkness of her corner Virginia saw how slightly he
staggered and her hope renewed. He might not be so badly
intoxicated as she had feared; but as he lurched through the low
doorway her heart sank, for he called her name aloud in a thick
voice that belied the steadiness of his carriage.</p>

<p>She did not reply, and he crossed the hut, stooping and feeling
for her with his hands. Presently he touched her, and an "ah!" of
satisfaction broke from his lips.</p>

<p>"'Lo, sweetie," he mumbled. Virginia did not answer, feigning
sleep instead. He grasped her by the shoulder and shook her.</p>

<p>"Wake up, kid!" he shouted. "I'll show you I'm not shush a bad
sort. 'S crooks out there wanted me to croak you; but I'm a gelmun;
I won't croak you; if you treat me right."</p>

<p>He dragged her to a sitting posture and put his arms about
her.</p>

<p>She could not push him away or fight him off, for her arms were
pinioned behind her.</p>

<p>"Scott!" she cried. "Think what you are doing! I'm your own
cousin."</p>

<p>"Firsh cousin once removed," he corrected.</p>

<p>"Please, Scott!" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Please leave me alone." For reply he kissed her.</p>

<p>"You beast!" she cried.</p>

<p>"No beast," he assured her. "To show what a good fellow I am I'm
goin' to take these ropes off you," and he commenced to fumble with
the knots.</p>

<p>Virginia saw a ray of hope now in his drunkenness. Sober, his
reason would have warned him against releasing her; but drunk he
had all the foolish assurance of drunkenness. The knots baffling
him, he drew his hunting knife and cut the cords.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you can show me how mush you love me," and
again he seized her and strained her to him. At his hip swung a
revolver.</p>

<p>Virginia had coveted it from the first. Now it was the work of
but a moment to snatch it from its holster and press it against the
man's stomach.</p>

<p>"Take your hands off me," she said, "or I'll pull the trigger,"
and she poked the muzzle against his ribs.</p>

<p>Taylor knew in an instant what she had accomplished and it
sobered him. Slowly his hand crept down to seize hers where it held
the weapon close against him.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands," she warned him, "and put them up quickly. I
shall take no chances, Scott, and I give you my word that I'd
breathe freer if you were dead."</p>

<p>The man raised his hands above his head and Virginia sprang to
her feet.</p>

<p>"Now stay where you are," she commanded. "Don't come out of this
hut before morning. If you do, or make any attempt to stay or
recapture me, I shall certainly make it my sole point in life to
kill you before I am retaken."</p>

<p>Slowly she backed across the floor toward the doorway. She would
arouse her men and at the point of Scott's revolver force them to
accompany her from the village. She was desperate, for she knew
that worse than death was the best that she could hope for from
Scott Taylor.</p>

<p>It was with a sigh of relief that she passed the low portal and
found herself in the pure air of the moon-bathed tropical night. A
prayer of thanksgiving was on her lips; but it was never breathed,
for scarce had she emerged from the interior of the hut than she
was roughly seized from behind and the revolver wrenched from her
grasp.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">AS Virginia turned to struggle with her captors
she saw that they were Taylor's two accomplices, and now Taylor,
released from the menace of the revolver, rushed from the hut to
the assistance of his fellows. It required the combined strength of
the three to subdue the girl, who was fighting with the strength of
desperation for life, and more than life.</p>

<p>But at last they overcame her and dragged her back into the hut.
Here they shoved her to the far side, and, panting from their
exertions, stood glowering at her. Taylor was wiping blood from his
hand. Virginia Scott, in the extremity of her need, had been
transformed in the moment of battle to a primordial she-thing, and
as her first human ancestor might have done, had fought with tooth
and nails against her assailants. Kelley, too, had felt her strong,
white teeth sink into his flesh and Gootch bore a long scratch from
temple to chin.</p>

<p>"The &mdash; &mdash;," exclaimed the latter. "We'd orter of
croaked her in the first place."</p>

<p>Taylor was eyeing the girl through narrowed lids. All the beast
that was in him shone from his evil eyes. He turned and whispered
quickly to Kelley and Gootch.</p>

<p>"Are we in on it?" asked the former.</p>

<p>Taylor nodded. "I don't care," he said.</p>

<p>"And then we give her the k. o. and put her away behin' the
hut," supplemented Gootch. "The groun' 's soft an' the diggin'll be
easy."</p>

<p>"I told you that's wot you'd orter of done in the first place,"
grumbled Kelley. "It'll leave you the only heir an' there won't be
nobody to squeal about Gordon w'en he don't show up no more."</p>

<p>"Go to it," growled Taylor; "there can't be any cat bite me up
without paying for it."</p>

<p>The two crooks advanced toward the girl and seized her. Taylor
waited to one side. Slowly they forced her to the floor of the hut
and held her there, though she fought with all the strength
remaining to her.</p>

<p>And outside the palisade the black maned prowler sniffed and
listened. Now a little, vagrant breeze eddied through the stagnant
night. It swirled across the village compound, and it bore upon its
wings to the nostrils of the carnivore the fresh scent of the white
men. With a low growl the great beast crouched and sprang. Lightly
as a feather he topped the palisade and dropped noiselessly
within.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood motionless, peering about. There was no
one in sight. With long, easy strides, his supple muscles rolling
in the moonlight beneath his smooth hide, the destroyer crossed to
the nearest hut and sniffed at the chinks in the thatched wall.
Then he moved to another and another, searching for the prey he
wanted. And all unconscious of this grisly presence the blacks
within slept on in blissful ignorance of the hideous menace roaming
at will through their village.</p>

<p>In the white man's hut the three brutes struggled with the
battling girl. Their victory was not to be the easy thing they had
bargained on, and as they fought to subdue her their positions
changed from time to time. Once she caught Gootch's thumb between
her teeth, nor released her hold until she had almost severed it
from his hand.</p>

<p>Cursing and moaning, the crook withdrew from the battle for a
moment to sit with his back toward the door nursing his hurt.
Kelley and Taylor were still endeavoring to overpower their quarry
without killing her. Their faces were toward the door. Suddenly
Virginia felt their grasps relax and saw their eyes, wide in
horror, directed across her shoulder.</p>

<p>She turned to discover what had so quickly diverted their
attention from her, and she gasped at the sight that met her eyes.
Framed in the doorway was the massive head of a huge lion. Gootch
had not seen the beast. He was rolling to and fro drunkenly,
holding on to his injured thumb.</p>

<p>Without a word Taylor and Kelley turned and commenced clawing
frantically at the frail thatching of the hut's rear wall. In a
moment they had torn an opening large enough to permit their bodies
to pass through, and were gone into the night beyond. At the same
instant the lion gave voice to a terrific roar, and Virginia dodged
through the rent that Taylor and Kelley had made and sprawled to
the ground outside. She saw the two scoundrels fleeing toward the
right, and instinctively she turned toward the left. She had taken
but a few steps when there fell upon her ears the most
bloodcurdling scream of mortal agony and terror that ever had smote
upon them in her life. She had not imagined that the human voice
could compass such freezing fear as that which shrieked out its
high pitched wail upon the silent jungle night.</p>

<p>The cry compelled her to turn her head back in the direction of
the hut she had quitted, and there, in the full light of the
equatorial moon, she witnessed that which will be seared upon her
memory to her dying day.</p>

<p>She saw Gootch, half through the opening that had given escape
to Kelley, Taylor and herself, clutching frantically at the turf at
the sides of the torn hut wall. His features were distorted by
agony and horror supreme.</p>

<p>He shrieked aloud to the friends who had deserted him and to the
God that he long since had deserted, and ever, slowly and horribly,
he was being drawn back into the interior of the hut by an unseen
power. All too well Virginia guessed the giant force, the hideous
bestial force, that was dragging the terrified man backward to his
doom within the dark interior of the hut; yet, fascinated, she
could but stand and watch the grim and terrible tragedy.</p>

<p>Slowly the body disappeared, and then the shoulders. Only the
head was left and the hands, the latter still clutching futilely
for a hold upon the frail wall. The face white and distorted by
fear and suffering.</p>

<p>And then the head was drawn back out of sight, the hands gave up
the last hold; there was a frightful wail from within the gloomy
interior, a wail which mingled with a savage, thunderous
roar&mdash;and then silence.</p>

<p>The cries of Gootch aroused the natives. Warriors were pouring
from every hut&mdash;the whole village was aroused. Virginia turned
and resumed her flight. Straight toward the gates she ran. To unbar
them was the work of but a moment. Beyond was the terrible jungle;
the grim, cruel, mysterious jungle; but behind was a fate more
terrible than any the jungle could offer. Without another backward
glance the girl pushed the portals wide and scurried into the
darkness of the forbidding forest.</p>

<p>The blacks, attracted to the hut occupied by the white men by
Gootch's screams, waited a few paces from the entrance and shouted
to their guests to ascertain the cause of the commotion. The lion
within, warned by their voices, turned from his prey and stuck his
great head out through the doorway. At sight of him the blacks
howled in mingled terror and defiance. They waved their spears and
shouted, hoping to frighten the beast from his hiding place.</p>

<p>Annoyed and rendered nervous by their din, the carnivore roared
back his challenge, and amid a shower of hurtling spears dashed
from the hut. For a moment he stood bewildered while the blacks
retreated, and then he turned and trotted toward the palisade.
Seeing him retreat the natives gathered courage and pursued. He
skirted close in the shadow of the wall for a short distance,
coming presently upon the gates which Virginia had left open.</p>

<p>There he paused for an instant to turn a snarling face toward
his pursuers, a face which brought them to a sudden halt, and then,
wheeling, darted through the gateway and was gone.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Stumbling through the jungle night, Virginia Scott was occupied
by but a single thought&mdash;to place as much distance between
herself and Scott Taylor as she could. In what direction she was
going, to what nameless fate she did not consider. For the first
half hour hers was the flight of panic&mdash;unreasoning, mad,
hysterical. And surely she had been through enough that day to
shake steadier nerves and more experienced heads than hers.</p>

<p>Thorns and underbrush clutched at her short skirt and khaki
jacket, tearing them; scratched her hands, her arms and face;
tangled themselves between her feet and tripped her. Again and
again she fell, only to scramble to her feet once more and plunge
on deeper and deeper into the unknown. The myriad jungle noises
fell for a time on deaf ears&mdash;the movement of padded feet, the
brush of bodies against vine and bush, the fluttering of weird
wings registered not at all upon her fear-numbed brain.</p>

<p>And then, above all other sounds, broke one that blasted its way
to her perceptive faculties. Thunderous, ominous, earth-shaking,
terrible, it shattered her preoccupation and awoke her to a sense
of the nearness of other dangers than that from which she was
fleeing.</p>

<p>It was the roar of a lion. To her tense nerves it sounded close
behind her. The girl paused, stark and rigid, listening. She stood
with her clenched hands tight against her bosom. Her breath came in
little gasps. She could feel her heart beating against her
ribs&mdash;she could hear it; above all the noises of the jungle it
sounded like a traitorous tattoo, beating out a call to the
prowlers of the night, guiding them to their prey.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood thus, until out of the blackness from
which she had come she thought she heard the stealthy pad of great
feet. With a shudder and a little gasp she turned to flee from this
new menace. On she stumbled, bruised, bleeding, hopeless. For how
long she could not know. Time had ceased to exist in the meanwhile,
and man made units of seconds, minutes, or hours&mdash;each heart
beat measured an eternity. She had been fleeing thus through the
blackness of tortured terror since time began&mdash;she would
continue thus to flee, hopeless, until the last trump, and then the
thing behind her would spring, frightful talons would fasten
themselves in her soft flesh, giant fangs would sink deep in neck
or shoulder. It would be the end. The end! The thought brought her
to a sudden stop. The end! It was inevitable. Why flee the
inevitable?</p>

<p>She leaned against the bole of a tree, panting like a winded doe
that, after a brave battle for liberty, finds itself spent and
awaits resignedly the coming of the hounds.</p>

<p>She waited, listening for sounds of the coming of the beast of
prey she felt sure was upon her trail. She listened, but she heard
no sound to indicate that the beast was close at hand. However, she
did not attempt to delude herself into a feeling of false security.
She well knew the uncanny soundlessness of the passing of the giant
cats when they chose silence.</p>

<p>But what was that? A body, black against the blackness of the
jungle, had moved among the trees to her right. She strained her
eyes in the direction of the shadowy form. Yes!</p>

<p>There it was, and another and another. Suddenly two spots of
fire glowed dimly from the point upon which her gaze was
concentrated. Close beside them appeared two other spots.</p>

<p>Virginia shrank back against the tree, horrified. A little
prayer rose from her silent lips. God! They were coming closer.
Stealthily, noiselessly, they were creeping upon her. The rough
bark of the tree behind her gave to the frenzied force of her
clutching fingers. A piece broke off, coming away in her hand. Such
a little thing may sometimes prove the most momentous of a
lifetime. To Virginia it brought a lightning train of thoughts that
opened an avenue of hope in her hopeless breast. The tree!</p>

<p>Why had she not thought of it before? They were coming closer
now&mdash;would there be time? She turned and measured the girth of
the bole with her arms. It was not a large tree&mdash;in that lay
still greater hope. A sudden snarling broke from the things
creeping upon her, and at the same instant she leaped as high as
she could, embraced the stem of the tree and scrambled rapidly
aloft.</p>

<p>There was a rush below her, a chorus of angry growls, and
something brushed her foot. She heard the click of jaws snapping
together below her, and then she drew herself to the comparative
safety of a lower limb.</p>

<p>With reaction came a faintness and a giddy dizziness that
threatened to plunge her from her sanctuary, but she clung
desperately, and after a moment gained control of herself. Then,
painfully and wearily, she crawled a little higher among the
branches until she found a spot where she could recline in greater
safety and comfort.</p>

<p>Here she lay sleepless through the balance of the night&mdash;a
few hours which seemed endless to her&mdash;while the jungle surged
back and forth below, around, and above her, and the jungle noises,
fearsome and uncanny, rose and fell, a devil's discord jangling on
raw nerves.</p>

<p>Through those long hours Virginia sought, by planning, some ray
of hope for the future, but each essay in this direction brought
her to a dead stop against the black wall of fact. She was alone,
unarmed, and lost in the jungle. She was surrounded by savage
beasts and savage men by any one of which she would be considered
natural prey.</p>

<p>To retrace the long journey from the coast, even though she knew
the trail, would be impossible, and equally impossible would be the
task of going ahead in search of Richard Gordon, whom she knew to
be somewhere to the west of her. The more she weighed her chances
for existence against the forces of destruction pitted against her,
the more hopeless appeared her situation. Even the coming dawn,
ordinarily a time of renewing hope, brought no added buoyancy to
her jaded spirits&mdash;only a dogged determination to fight on to
the inevitable end, and then to die bravely with a consciousness of
having fought a good fight, as became a granddaughter of Jefferson
Scott.</p>

<p>As daylight dispelled the darkness about her and objects that
had assumed grotesque and menacing proportions by night receded and
shrank to the common places of day Virginia's eyes sought the
ground below for a glimpse of the creatures whose menace had driven
her to the safety of branches before; but, search as she would, she
could discover no sign of dangerous beast, and at last, realizing
that she could not remain in the tree forever, she dropped to the
ground and resumed her flight. Noting the direction of the sun she
turned her face toward the west, deciding at least that her only
hope of salvation lay in Richard Gordon and influenced equally,
too, by the obligation she felt strong upon her to find and warn
him of the menace which lay in wait upon his homeward trail.</p>

<p>That she would find him she had little hope; but at least she
would have the poor satisfaction of clinging to duty to the last,
however futile her attempt to fulfill that duty.</p>

<p>She had not gone a great distance when she became aware of the
uncanny sensation that she was being followed. Turning, she looked
back into the jungle behind her; but saw nothing. Yet again, the
moment she had resumed her way, she could have sworn that she heard
something moving through the vegetation at her heels. How long this
continued she could not have told; but at length it so preyed upon
her nerves that she was once more reduced to a state of panicky
terror equal to that which had claimed her the preceding night.</p>

<p>If she could have seen the thing that dogged her footsteps, even
to know that it was some fierce and terrible creature of
destruction, her nervous suffering would have been less; but to
feel its eyes upon her and yet not to see it, to hear its padded
footsteps and to see twigs disturbed was horrible.</p>

<p>A dozen times she was on the point of clambering into a tree;
but hunger and thirst which had already assailed her told her in no
uncertain terms that there must be no tarrying except in the last
extreme of danger.</p>

<p>While she had strength she must go on and on, for if she did not
find food and drink she soon would have no strength to go.</p>

<p>Twenty times she must have turned to search out the prowler that
stalked her, yet she had had no slightest glimpse of him, when she
broke, quite unexpectedly, into a small clearing. Straight across
this she made her way, and toward the center turned again to cast a
nervous glance rearward, and then she saw the thing upon her
track&mdash;a mangy, hideous hyena.</p>

<p>Virginia knew that men looked down upon this repulsive beast,
calling him a harmless coward; but she knew too many a man had
fallen prey to the enormous strength and ferocity of these same
creatures. She knew their cunning and their cruelty, and that, like
all other hunted beasts they were as perfectly aware when man was
unarmed as was man himself.</p>

<p>She had heard tales of their courage too; of their attacking
lions and dragging his kill from beneath the very nose of the king
of beasts. And so she did not deceive herself, as have others to
their sorrow, as to the cowardice or the harmlessness of this,
nature's most loathsome creature. Fifty yards ahead was a low tree
growing solitary in the clearing. She quickened her pace, and
turning her head, saw, to her horror, that the hyena had broken
into a trot and was coming straight for her. Even so, she could
reach the tree; she was quite near it now. The hyena was not
charging, just trotting slowly toward her. Evidently he was too
sure of his prey to feel any necessity for exerting himself.</p>

<p>Virginia reached the tree in ample time to climb to safety, and
it was with a little prayer of relief that she looked up for a hand
hold upon a lower branch&mdash;a prayer that froze upon her lips
and turned to a scream of horror, startled from overwrought nerves,
as she saw a great snake coiled in the branches above her head.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN daylight broke upon the village from which
Virginia had escaped it found Taylor and Kelley, shaken but
sobered, preparing to set out in search of Virginia. In the jungle
outside the palisade they had buried the torn remnants of what had
once been Gootch, and then they gathered their men together and set
forth upon the trail of the girl.</p>

<p>Spreading out in a great circle, two or three together, they
beat the jungle in all directions. Chance led the two whites with a
handful of men toward the west, and a shred of torn khaki clinging
to a thorn bush put one of the natives upon her trail. After that
it was easy and the party made rapid progress in the wake of the
fleeing girl.</p>

<p>And to the west another camp was astir. Breakfast was served and
disposed of, and Dick Gordon, humming "It's nice to get up in the
morning," shouldered a light sporting rifle, and with his gun
bearer at his heels with his express set out along the coastal
trail of his safari.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful; Gordon was happy. Broadway held more
pitfalls than the jungle. His was but a happy, care-free jaunt to
the coast. He was already commencing to feel sorry that his quest
was over and his outing past its zenith. Back to the humdrum of
civilization! He shrugged disgustedly. Not an untoward occurrence
upon the entire trip. The monotony of New York had followed him
into the wilds of Africa. He had been born, evidently, to the
commonplace. Adventure shunned him.</p>

<p>And then, directly ahead and so close that it sounded shrill
upon his ears, rose the scream of a terrified woman. Gordon leaped
forward at a rapid run. In a dozen paces he broke from the jungle
into a small clearing to a sight which surprised him no less than
would the presence of a Numidian lion loose upon Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>He saw first a dishevelled white girl clothed in torn khaki, her
hair loosened and fallen about her shoulders. In her hand was a
broken branch and snarling about her was a huge hyena, closing in
ready to charge.</p>

<p>Before either the girl or the beast realized that a new factor
had been precipitated into their encounter, Gordon had thrown his
rifle to his shoulder and fired just as the hyena charged. With a
yelp of agony the hideous creature tumbled over and over almost to
the girl's feet, and as it came to rest two more bullets pinged
into its carcass, finishing it forever.</p>

<p>Gordon had run forward, stopping only momentarily to fire, and
an instant after his last shot he stood before the girl looking
down at her with astonishment and incredulity written large upon
his countenance. She looked up at him in equal astonishment. He saw
her reel, and dropping his rifle, steadied her with his arm.</p>

<p>"In the name of all that is holy," he said, "who are you, and
what are you doing here alone in the jungle?"</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Gordon?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes, my name is Gordon; but how the&mdash;how in the
world did you know that and who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Virginia Scott," she replied. She was still trembling and
unstrung. It was with difficulty that she composed herself
sufficiently to answer him coherently.</p>

<p>Gordon's eyes went wide at the disclosure of her identity.</p>

<p>"Miss Scott!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What brought you here? Didn't your mother get my letter telling
her that I would bring her the papers from the old mission?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she explained, "but another saw your letter
first&mdash;Scott Taylor, my mother's cousin, and he set out after
you to&mdash;to&mdash;oh, it is terrible, Mr. Gordon&mdash;he has
followed you to kill you."</p>

<p>"He was the other heir?" Virginia nodded.</p>

<p>"And you have taken these frightful chances to warn me?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"There was no other way," she replied.</p>

<p>He questioned her further, and bit by bit wrung from her the
whole terrible story of the ordeals through which she had
passed.</p>

<p>"And she has done all this for the sake of a stranger," he
thought. "What a girl!"</p>

<p>He had been watching her closely as she talked, and he found it
difficult to take his eyes from her face. It was a very beautiful
face.</p>

<p>Even the grime and the dirt and the scratches could not conceal
that fact.</p>

<p>"You have done a very wonderful thing, Miss Scott," he said. "A
very brave, and wonderful, and foolish thing. I thank God that I
found you in time. I shudder to think what your fate would have
been had chance not led us together at the right moment."</p>

<p>As they talked another party came to the edge of the clearing
upon its eastern verge&mdash;came and halted at the sight disclosed
before their eyes. It was Taylor, Kelley and their blacks. They had
heard the shot and hurried forward, but cautiously; as they were
sure that Virginia was not armed.</p>

<p>When Taylor saw the girl and Gordon together he saw the end of
all his plans&mdash;unless&mdash;. His eyes narrowed as the
suggestion forced itself upon him. Here were these two who stood
alone between him and fortune. Two shots would put them from his
path forever. Should either ever reach civilization again Scott
Taylor would become an outcast. The story of his villainy would
make him a marked man in the haunts he best loved. Never again
could he return to Broadway.</p>

<p>Gordon's back was toward him. The girl's eyes were hidden from
him by the man's broad shoulders. Taylor stepped from behind the
tree that had concealed him. He took careful aim at his first
victim&mdash;the man.</p>

<p>And at that moment Gordon shifted his position, and Virginia's
horrified eyes took in the menace at his back.</p>

<p>It was too late to warn him.</p>

<p>There was but a single chance to save him. There was no sign in
her expression that she had discovered Taylor. He was readjusting
his aim to the changed position of his target, and he was taking
his time about it, too, for he could not afford to bungle or
miss.</p>

<p>At Gordon's belt swung his revolver. Virginia was so close she
could touch him by crooking an elbow. She did not have to take a
step closer, and it was the work of but a second to whip the
revolver from its holster, swing it up on Scott Taylor and pull the
trigger. At the report Gordon wheeled in surprise toward the
direction the girl had fired. He saw a white man drop a rifle and
stagger out of sight behind a tree, and then the girl grasped him
by the arm and drew him behind the tree beneath the branches of
which they had met.</p>

<p>"It was Taylor," she whispered.</p>

<p>"He had levelled his rifle at you. He would have shot you in the
back, the cur."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Dick Gordon in a wondering voice, "that I owed
you about all that a man could owe to a fellow-being; but now you
have still further added to my debt."</p>

<p>"You owe me nothing; the obligation is still all upon the side
of my mother and myself," replied Virginia. "But if you want to add
a thousand-fold to that obligation I can tell you how you can do
it."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Gordon eagerly.</p>

<p>"By getting me and yourself out of this hideous country and back
to America as quickly as it can be done."</p>

<p>"Good," cried Gordon. "We'll start in just a minute, but first
I'm going after that human mephitis and put him where he won't
shoot any more at a man's back or bother women," and calling to his
men, who were now coming up, he started across the clearing in
pursuit of Taylor.</p>

<p>That worthy, however, eluded them. Wounded in the forearm, he
had scurried into the jungle, half supported, half dragged by
Kelley, who, while feeling no loyalty toward his leader, shrank
with terror from the thought of being left alone to the mercies of
the blacks in the center of Africa. The reward he had about given
up with the sight of Gordon and the girl together, for with Gootch
dead and Taylor wounded, it seemed practically hopeless to expect
to prevent Gordon and Virginia returning to America. Kelley knew
that he couldn't do it alone, nor would he try. He could knife a
man in the back with ease, but a look at Gordon had assured him
that it would not be profitable employment to attempt to get near
enough to that athletic and competent looking young man to reach
him with a knife. No, Kelley was through, in so far as further
attempts at crime in his present surroundings were concerned.</p>

<p>"Get 'em back in the good ol' U.S.," he urged Taylor, "an' I'll
agree to help you; but Africa&mdash;never again!" and he raised his
right hand solemnly above his head.</p>

<p>Taylor smiled ironically. "Yes! Get 'em back in the good old
U.S.," he mimicked. "They'll go back of themselves fast enough, you
boob, without any help from us, and they'll make little old U.S. so
damned hot that it won't hold us. If that cat hadn't pinked me I'd
stop 'em before ever they reached the coast, but," and he winced
with pain, "I'm all in for a while; but by God, I'll follow them to
the States and get them there; there can't anybody put anything
over on me like this. They can't rob me of what's mine by right
even if it isn't mine by law, and I'll show 'em."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Virginia was for giving the native village of her adventures a
wide berth, but Gordon assured her that they must pass it on the
trail to the coast, and that he was rather anxious to do so and
interview the chief. The tone of voice in which he stated his
determination filled Virginia with alarm and also made him promise
that he would do nothing to arouse the wrath of the village.</p>

<p>But pass the village they did, and much to their surprise the
first people they saw emerging from the gates to meet them were
several white men. They proved to be a party of wild animal
collectors coming down from an excursion toward the north.</p>

<p>In sturdy cages they bore several young lions, a few leopards,
hyenas and other specimens of the fauna of the district through
which they had passed. Now they were on their way to the coast, but
the stories they had heard of the wonderful black maned lion that
had terrorized the village and killed a white man there the night
before had determined them to stop long enough to attempt to
capture the splendid beast.</p>

<p>Gordon and Virginia tarried with them but a few minutes, then
continued their way to the coast, which they reached without
incident after what was, to Gordon at least, the pleasantest
journey of his life.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the anxiety which he knew the girl's mother
must be suffering on account of her mad escapade he would have
found means to prolong the journey many days.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">AT the coast they found that they would have to
wait a week for a steamer, and having cabled Mrs. Scott that
Virginia was safe under his care, Gordon felt at liberty to rejoice
that they had made reasonably good connections. It might have been
worse&mdash;chance might have brought them to the coast only a day
ahead of a steamer.</p>

<p>Gordon, unspoiled by wealth and attentions and scheming manias,
lacked sufficient egotism to think that Virginia Scott might be
attracted to him as he was to her. There had been other girls whom
he had known desired him, but these he had not cared for. Very soon
after he had met Virginia he had realized that here at last, in the
wilds of Africa, he had found the one girl, the only girl, and
straight-away he had set her upon a pedestal and worshipped
silently from afar.</p>

<p>To think that this deity might stoop to love a mortal did not
occur to him, and, strange to say, he was content to love her
without declaring his love&mdash;but that was while he had her
alone and all to himself. How it would be when she returned to the
haunts of eligible men did not occur to him.</p>

<p>Very adroitly&mdash;at least he thought it was adroitly
accomplished&mdash;he discovered from her own lips that she was not
engaged, and thereafter his bliss knew no bounds. It had been
difficult for Virginia to repress a smile during the ponderous
strategy with which he maneuvered the information from her, and
also it had been her first intimation that Richard Gordon might
care for her. It troubled her, too, not a little, for Virginia
Scott was not a young lady to throw her heart lightly into the
keeping of the first good looking man who coveted it. That she
liked Gordon immensely she would have readily admitted; but she had
given no thought to a deeper interest nor but for the suggestion
the young man blunderingly put into her head might such a thought
have occurred to her&mdash;at least not so soon.</p>

<p>But the idea, implanted, became food for considerable
speculation, with the result that she now often discovered herself
appraising Gordon in a most critical manner. "As though," she
mused, "he were a six cylinder limousine, and I wanted to be sure
that I like the upholstery&mdash;which I do but there's something
wrong with his sparking device," and Virginia laughed softly to
herself.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" asked Gordon, sitting beside her on the hotel
veranda.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;just thinking," replied Virginia, evasively;
but she turned her face away to hide a guilty flush, and as she did
so her eyes alighted upon the head of a long column marching into
town.</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" she exclaimed, glad of any pretext to change the
line of thought. "Who do you suppose it can be?"</p>

<p>Gordon looked in the direction she indicated, rose and walked to
the end of the veranda, and then called back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"They're the collectors. I wonder if they got their
man-eater?"</p>

<p>Virginia was at his side now, and at her suggestion the two
walked down the street to meet the incoming caravan. The collectors
were delighted to see them again, and in response to Gordon's
inquiry pointed to a stout cage in the middle of the long line.</p>

<p>"There he is," said one of them, "and he's a devil."</p>

<p>Gordon and the girl dropped back to have a look at the latest
capture, finding a huge, black-maned lion crouching in the narrow
confines of his prison. His yellow eyes glared balefully out upon
them, his tail moved restlessly in angry jerks, and his bristling
muzzle was wrinkled into a perpetual snarl that bared long, ugly
looking fangs.</p>

<p>"He does look like a devil, doesn't he?" remarked Gordon.</p>

<p>A crowd was gathering about the cage now, and as one approached
more closely than his majesty thought proper he leaped to his feet
and dashed madly against the bars. Roaring loudly and clawing
viciously in an attempt to reach the presumptuous mortal&mdash;who
shrank back in terror, much to the amusement of the other
onlookers.</p>

<p>"What a beauty!" exclaimed Virginia.</p>

<p>Gordon was looking very closely at the lion, and instead of
replying moved forward nearer the cage. The lion growled savagely,
hurling himself against the bars, and then Gordon stepped quite
close to him. The beast stopped suddenly and eyed the man in
silence. A look, almost of human recognition, changed the
expression of his face.</p>

<p>He growled, but no longer angrily&mdash;a growl of friendly
greeting Gordon could have sworn.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," said the man, turning toward Virginia and
one of the collectors at his back. "See that jagged scar on the
inside of the forearm there?" he asked.</p>

<p>The collector nodded.</p>

<p>"This is the fellow I liberated from the pit," continued Gordon,
"and he remembers me."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't bank too strongly on his gratitude if I were
you," warned the collector.</p>

<p>"No, I don't intend to," laughed Gordon.</p>

<p>Two days later Virginia Scott and Richard Gordon took passage
upon a northbound steamer, and among the other passengers and cargo
were the collectors and their wild beasts.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>For several days after receiving his wound Taylor was down with
fever; but the moment he could travel he and Kelley set off on
their return to the coast, the former bent now upon carrying his
felonious designs to a successful conclusion even if he had to rob
and murder Gordon in the heart of New York. The man was desperate.
His expedition had cost him all the money that he could beg, borrow
or steal. He owed Kelley not alone the promised reward but several
hundred dollars in cash that the latter had advanced toward the
financing of the work. He must have money&mdash;he must have a lot
of it&mdash;and he was determined to get it.</p>

<p>Never in his life had Scott Taylor been so dangerous an enemy;
and in this state of mind he and Kelley caught the steamer
following that upon which Virginia and Gordon had sailed.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Gordon whiled away the hours of the voyage, when he could not be
in Virginia's company, before the cage of the great lion. No one
else could approach the beast, with the possible exception of
Virginia Scott, whom the animal seemed to tolerate so long as
Gordon was near. Toward all others the tawny man-eater evinced the
most frightful rage; but when Gordon approached he became docile as
a kitten, permitting the American to reach inside the bars and
scratch his massive, wrinkled face.</p>

<p>At Liverpool Gordon bade farewell to his savage, jungle friend,
for he and Virginia were to take a fast liner for New York, the
collector following upon a slower vessel.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, old man," said Gordon in parting, stroking the mighty
muzzle. "The chances are we'll never see each other again; but I'll
never forget you&mdash;especially as I most vividly recall you as
you stood over me there in the jungle debating the question of your
savage jungle ethics, while gratitude and appetite battled within
your breast&mdash;and see that you don't forget me; though you
will, of course, within a month."</p>

<p>The lion rumbled in his throat and rubbed his head luxuriously
against the bars as close to the man as he could get, and thus
Gordon left him.</p>

<p>Within a few days the huge beast was sold to a traveling
American circus, where he was presently exhibited to wondering
crowds, "Ben, King of Beasts, the Man-Eating Lion from the Wilds of
Central Africa." He roared and ramped and struggled for liberty for
days, but at last he seemed to realize the futility of his efforts,
and subsided into a sullen quiet which rendered his keepers even
more apprehensive than had his open rebellion.</p>

<p>"He's a ugly one," commented the big Irishman, whose special
charge Ben was; "an' deep, too. He'll get some 'un yet. Yeh can't
never trust these forest critters; they're all alike, only Ben he's
worse."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. SCOTT had met Virginia and Gordon at the
dock, where, in the excitement and rejoicing of the reunion of the
mother and daughter, the manila envelope and its contents were
forgotten until long after Gordon had seen the two safely aboard
their train for home.</p>

<p>Before parting with him both had urged that he visit them at an
early date, and gladly indeed had Gordon promised to do so. It was
not until their train had pulled out of the station that Virginia
recalled the paper for which Gordon had made the long journey and
risked his life.</p>

<p>"He must have forgotten it, too," she said; "but he'll probably
discover it and mail it to you today."</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Gordon did not, however, discover the manila
envelope for many days thereafter. It had crossed the Atlantic in
one of his bags in the special care of the loyal Murphy, and that
gentleman had removed it, with other papers, as was his custom, to
a certain drawer in Gordon's desk where "unfinished business"
reposed, awaiting the leisurely pleasure of Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>But that young gentleman found upon his arrival in New York a
matter of far greater interest than unanswered letters and unpaid
bills.</p>

<p>It was an urgent demand from an old school friend that he
accompany the former a-motoring into Canada on a fishing
expedition.</p>

<p>He had met this friend in the grill of one of his clubs the day
he landed in New York, and fifteen minutes later had promised to
leave with him early the following morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott and Virginia waited a reasonable time, and then,
hearing nothing from Gordon, the girl wrote him, and as fate would
have it her letter reached New York the very day that witnessed the
return of Taylor and Kelley, and the latter, sent to ascertain the
whereabouts of Gordon, preceded the postman into the apartment
building where Gordon's bachelor home was located by a few
paces.</p>

<p>Turning to see who was behind him, Kelley had an inspiration
born of former practice and long years of taking anything that he
could get his hands on, provided it belonged to another.</p>

<p>"If there's anything for my friend Gordon," he said to the mail
carrier, "I'll save you a trip up as I'm going up to see him
now."</p>

<p>Unsuspicious, the carrier shuffled off a half dozen pieces of
mail matter and handed them to Kelley, who resumed his way to the
elevator, stuffed the letters in his pocket and a moment later rang
the bell of Gordon's door. Murphy answered the summons and, thanks
to a slight disguise, failed to recognize the card sharp of the
trip out.</p>

<p>"No, sir, Mr. Gordon is not in," he replied to Kelley's inquiry.
"He has gone out of town for a couple of weeks. What name,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he doesn't know me," replied Kelley. "I'll call again after
he comes home. It's just a little business matter," and he turned
and departed.</p>

<p>Back in the flat on West One Hundred and Forty-fifth Street,
Kelley handed the mail to Taylor. One by one the envelopes were
steamed open and the contents read. Only the letter from Virginia
was of interest or value to the conspirators.</p>

<p>"He's still for the paper," announced Taylor when he had
finished reading Virginia's note, "and he'll go down there with it.
That's the place to get him and the paper at the same time. I know
the lay of the land there. We'll duck for Scottsville and lay for
Mr. Buttinski Gordon. Seal up those letters, Kelley, and put 'em
into Gordon's mail box."</p>

<p>Two weeks later Dick Gordon sat once more before his desk in his
apartment and attacked the accumulated correspondence in the
"unfinished business" drawer at his right hand.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be&mdash;what do you know about that?" he exclaimed,
as he read Virginia's letter, and then he rummaged through the mass
of envelopes before him, drawing a great sigh of relief as his
search finally uncovered the long manila envelope.</p>

<p>"Hey, Murphy!" he called. "Ring up and find out when the first
train through Scottsville, Virginia, leaves."</p>

<p>The following day he alighted at the station of the sleepy
little town, engaged a negro to drive him to The Oaks, and was
presently making his dusty way in the direction of the stately
Scott household.</p>

<p>Two minutes after he had driven off Kelley rushed breathlessly
into the ballroom of the tavern where Taylor was engaged in a game
of cards with a marooned traveling man.</p>

<p>Leaning close to Taylor's ear Kelley whispered; "He's come!"</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Taylor.</p>

<p>"Driven off toward The Oaks," replied Kelley.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;he'll keep 'til tonight," and Taylor resumed
the pleasurable task of separating the traveling man from his
expense money.</p>

<p>At The Oaks Gordon discovered that Mrs. Scott and Virginia were
visiting friends at a nearby town.</p>

<p>"Dey'll be back to-morrer, Mistah Gordon," said the old colored
butler, "an' Ah knows dey'll be mighty prolashus to see you-all.
Dey's been expectin' you for a right smaht. Yo come right along of
me, an' I'll show you yore room&mdash;you mos' suttiny gotter stay
till Miss Ruth an' Miss 'Ginia returns."</p>

<p>"It's mighty good of you," said Gordon, "and I'll do it. Let me
see, you are Washington, are you not? I've heard Miss Virginia
speak of you."</p>

<p>"Yassah, I'm Washington Scott, sah," replied the old fellow,
beaming with pride and pleasure to learn that he had been the
subject of 'Quality's conversation.' "Yassha, Marssa Jefferson
Scott's great gran' daddy bought my great gran' daddy 'bout fouah
hundred yeahs ago and we been in de fambly eber since. Ah been de
Gen'l's body servant evah since Ah ben a li'le shaver."</p>

<p>"Your people have sure been with the Scotts for some time,
Washington," commented Gordon, with a smile, as he followed the old
man up the grand staircase to the second floor.</p>

<p>Gordon's room lay at the far end of a long hall, overlooking the
roof of the veranda, and a pleasant, wooded lawn at the side of the
house.</p>

<p>The young man passed the balance of the day wandering about the
grounds, chatting with the negroes, and longing for the coming of
the morrow that would bring Virginia Scott. In the evening he sat
upon a settee beneath a tree on the front lawn, smoking and
listening to the banjos and the singing of the negroes in their
quarters down the road.</p>

<p>Bordering the fence grew thick shrubbery which hid the road, as
it also hid from his eyes the two silent figures that crept
stealthily in its shadow.</p>

<p>As they watched him Gordon arose, tossed his cigar aside and
turned toward the house. From across the bottom lands two miles
away came faintly the rumble of a train. Suddenly a shrill whistle
from an engine screamed through the quiet night, almost immediately
afterward followed by a dull, booming sound that seemed to shake
the earth.</p>

<p>Gordon paused and listened. "If that wasn't a wreck," he mused,
"it at least sounded mightily like it, but it probably wasn't at
that. Noises always seem exaggerated at night."</p>

<p>For a moment Gordon stood listening, then he turned toward the
house again, entered it and ascended to his room. The two figures
in the shrubbery circled the grounds until they reached a point
where they could see his windows. There they waited until a light
appearing proclaimed that Gordon had gone to his room.</p>

<p>"We'll loaf around until he's asleep," whispered one of the
prowlers.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the light in Gordon's chamber was
extinguished.</p>

<p>"He's turned in," whispered the other prowler.</p>

<p>"We'll stick for a quarter of an hour longer," said the first,
"an' give him a chance to get to sleep."</p>

<p>For a while both were silent.</p>

<p>The quiet of the soft summer night was broken only by the
cicadas, the subdued croaking of frogs in the bottoms, and strains
of Southern melody from the negro quarters.</p>

<p>"Don't them coons never go to bed," growled Kelley
querulously.</p>

<p>Taylor made no response. He was fidgeting uneasily. He wished
the job were over. Time and again he fingered the automatic in the
side pocket of his coat. Once he drew the weapon out and for the
dozenth time that day removed the cartridge clip and counted the
shells. "Nine of 'em and one in the chamber," he commented. "That's
ten&mdash;oh!&mdash;" The clip had slipped from his nervous fingers
and fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>Hastily he snatched it up and slipped it back in the grip of the
weapon.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he whispered to Kelley. "We'll sneak in up to his
door and listen there&mdash;this waitin' gets my goat."</p>

<p>"Mine, too," said Kelley, and the two slunk from tree to tree
until they were well in the shadows of the house. Then they circled
to the veranda steps, mounted and paused beside the French doors
opening into the library. Taylor was in advance. He was about to
enter when a telephone bell broke the silence of the interior with
a brazen clanging, bursting upon their startled ears with all the
terrific volume of a pounding fire gong. The two men drew back
hurriedly, slinking into the deeper shadows at the end of the porch
and crouching behind a swinging porch seat.</p>

<p>Presently a light shone in the library&mdash;waveringly at
first, and then brighter and steadier as the old butler entered
with a lamp and set it upon the table. The telephone bell was still
ringing intermittently. Taylor and Kelley strained their ears to
catch his words, but could not.</p>

<p>He was talking to Virginia Scott. "We decided to come tonight
instead of tomorrow," she said. "There was a wreck about half a
mile from the station which delayed us&mdash;we had to walk in from
where the accident occurred. Send Jackson to town with the machine
for us at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss 'Ginia, Ah send him punctiliously," replied the old
man.</p>

<p>A moment later he was routing Jackson out of bed and posting him
off to the village. Taylor and Kelley remained in hiding, for the
old butler waited out upon the veranda until he had seen the car
turn into the pike and disappear in the direction of Scottsville.
Then he turned slowly and entered the house, plodding upward to his
room that he might dress to properly receive his returning
mistress. He took the lamp with him, leaving the library lighted
only by the moon which now streamed a silver shaft through the
doors and windows.</p>

<p>When they were sure that he had gone Taylor and Kelley crept
from their hiding place and entered the library, leaving the French
doors wide open. At the foot of the stairs they paused, listening.
Some one was moving about on the floor above. It was the butler.
Fearing that he was returning to the first floor the conspirators
dodged into the music room, the doorway of which was close to the
bottom of the stairs.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Ben, King of Beasts, objected strenuously to being loaded upon a
flat car. Although the process consisted merely of rolling his
wheeled cage up an incline onto the car, he objected to every
change of location which necessitated the closer proximity of hated
man, and the disturbing of his royal reveries.</p>

<p>But loaded he was, and then came the hateful jolting and
pounding of the rumbling train, the screech of whistles, the
grinding of brakes, and all the other noises of a switching circus
train in a railroad yard. It seemed an eternity before the long
train pulled out of the village and the nerve racking discords gave
place to the rhythmic rumble of the open right of way, which
finally lulled the irritable beast to slumber&mdash;a slumber that
was rudely awakened by a piercing shriek of the engine's whistle,
followed almost immediately by a terrific crash, and the pounding
of the derailed flat over the ties for a hundred yards until at
last it toppled into the ditch, hurling its cargo of terrified
beasts through a barbed wire fence into a field beyond.</p>

<p>Ben's cage rolled over and over, one end of the top snapping a
telegraph pole off short a few feet above the ground. After it had
come to rest beyond the tangled wire of the demolished fence the
lion lay half dazed for several minutes. Then he rose gingerly, as
though expecting to discover that all his bones had been broken. He
shook his giant head and rumbled out a low roar. His cage was lying
on its side. What was that? Ben cocked his head upon one side and
gazed incredulously at a gaping rent in front of him. The roof had
been torn away by impact with the telegraph pole&mdash;there was a
great hole, barless, through which two lions might have walked
abreast.</p>

<p>Ben approached the opening and looked out. Before him stretched
an open meadowland. He raised his nose and sniffed. A little tremor
of joy ran through his great frame.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood there, listening. He heard the shouts of
approaching men mingled with the screams and roars of terrified
beasts about him. Lightly he sprang through the opening in the
broken cage. He was free! Men were running toward him from the rear
of the train. They had not seen him yet. For an instant he
hesitated as though minded to remain and wreak vengeance on the
human race; then a glimpse of distant woods and the lure of the
open was too much for him. In long, easy bounds he loped away
across the meadowland. A shallow swale running upland from the
railroad appealed to his primeval instinct for cover. It hid him
effectually from the sight of the men now crowding about the
derailed flat.</p>

<p>Dropping into a swinging stride, he moved straight upwind. All
about him was the scent of cattle. He licked his chops and whined.
A barbed wire fence presently barred his way. This was something
new! He sniffed inquiringly at it; then he curled his lips
disdainfully at the puny strands that the foolish man-creatures had
thought to imprison him with, for he believed that this was a new
sort of cage constructed especially to hold him.</p>

<p>He raised a mighty forepaw and smote it. The sharp barbs pierced
his flesh, eliciting an angry growl. He raised his eyes to measure
the height of the barrier. It was low, pitifully low.</p>

<p>Still growling, Ben bounded over it. The wind now brought down
to his nostrils the strong scent of sheep and cows and swine,
filling him with lust for the hot blood, the dripping flesh of the
warm, new kill.</p>

<p>Further on a Virginia rail fence loomed before him. He took it
without a pause and an instant later stood in the dust of a white
turnpike. Across the road was a hedge and from beyond the hedge
came the mingled odors of man and herbivora. The lion lowered his
head and walked through the hedge. He found himself upon a well
kept lawn, dotted here and there with shrubs and trees. At the far
side of the lawn rose a large white structure, gleaming in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>Majestically the imperial beast moved across the close cropped
sward&mdash;a golden lion on a velvet rug of green. A settee lay in
his path. It was something new, and all new things were to be
investigated. He sniffed at it, and on the instant his whole manner
changed. A nervous tremor of excitement ran through his supple
body. His tail twitched and trembled. His eyes glowed brighter. A
low whine broke from his savage lips.</p>

<p>Down went his nose to the grass. The spoor was fresh and
plain&mdash;it was the spoor of his one man-friend.</p>

<p>Ben followed it across the lawn to the foot of the veranda
steps. Here he paused, looking dubiously up at the man-made
structure. It might be another trap built for his capture; but no,
the man-friend was there, and it must be safe.</p>

<p>The lion mounted the steps, still sniffing with lowered nose.
Upon the veranda a new spoor lay fresher over that of the
other&mdash;a spoor that set his tail to lashing angrily and put a
hideous light into his yellow eyes&mdash;wicked and implacable now.
The scent led through open doors into the interior. The beast
thrust his head within and surveyed the room. He saw no one, but
plainly he caught the scent of those whose scent he first had
learned where it mingled with the blood of his slain mate.</p>

<p>Treading softly, he entered the room, the thick rug beneath
padded feet giving forth no sound. In the center of the library he
halted. A flood of moonlight pouring through the open doorway fell
full upon him, revealing him in all his majesty of savage strength
and alertness.</p>

<p>For all he moved now he might have been a mounted specimen
standing there upon the Oriental rug beneath his feet, for he was
listening.</p>

<p>A slight sound had come to those sensitive ears from out of the
darkness of the music room. His yellow eyes bored straight ahead
through the open doorway before him.</p>

<p>Taylor, hearing no further sounds from above, whispered to
Kelley to follow him. Cautiously he moved toward the doorway
leading into the library at the foot of the stairs. As he peered
out his eyes suddenly went wide, his lower jaw fell, his knees
trembled, for, standing motionless in the center of the library, he
saw a huge lion.</p>

<p>For an instant the man was paralyzed with terror; and then the
lion, giving voice to a single quick, short growl, charged. Taylor
dodged back into the music room, too terrified to scream. Directly
behind him was Kelley. In his mad panic of fear Taylor hurled his
accomplice backward to the floor. Then he scrambled beneath a grand
piano just as the lion leaped into the room.</p>

<p>The first object that the beast's eyes encountered was the
prostrate form of Kelley. For an instant the beast's attention was
occupied, and Taylor took the slender advantage that was his to
scurry from the room and race madly up the staircase to the second
floor.</p>

<p>He ran straight for the closed door at the far end of the hall,
the door leading into Richard Gordon's room. He scarce reached it
when the lion, abandoning the grisly thing upon the music room
floor, bounded from the room and up the stairway in pursuit.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">WASHINGTON SCOTT, in the act of dressing for the
return of his mistress, heard strange sounds that filtered upward
from the first floor to his room upon the third. Seizing his lamp
he made his way slowly downward upon his old and shaky legs. He was
in the act of turning the knob of the door at the foot of the
stairway that opened into the second floor balcony when he heard
footsteps rushing frantically past.</p>

<p>Cautiously he opened the door and peered out in time to see a
man dodge into Gordon's room and close the door. So quickly had the
figure disappeared that the old butler had not recognized the
intruder, but he was sure that it was not Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>He would investigate. Stumping laboriously into the hall, he
turned in the direction of Gordon's room. He was just opposite the
old fashioned wardrobe built into the wall near Gordon's door when
the rush of strange footfalls ascending the stairway caused him to
turn his eyes in that direction.</p>

<p>"Gord a-mighty," shrieked the old man, as his eyes fell upon the
hideous visage of the wide-jawed carnivore.</p>

<p>It was too late to retreat to the stairway down which he had
just come. He had heard the lock turn in Gordon's door. There was
only the old-fashioned cupboard in the wall beside him. Not in
fifty years had Washington Scott moved with such celerity as he
evinced in the next quarter second. With a wrench he tore the door
open&mdash;like a youthful hurdler he vaulted into the dark closet,
slamming the door to after him. Within was a crash of broken
flooring and then silence.</p>

<p>The lion rushed past the old man's hiding place without even
pausing to investigate. He was after bigger game than a decrepit
old darky.</p>

<p>As Taylor dashed into his room, Gordon, awakened by the noise,
sprang from his bed. Taylor, knowing that the time for stealth was
past and that the whole house would be aroused in an instant, drew
his revolver from the side pocket of his coat and fired point blank
at Gordon as the latter rose in his bed. The bullet passed through
Gordon's pajama coat and pinged into the wall behind him.</p>

<p>Then Taylor, with a mental "nine more," pulled the trigger
again.</p>

<p>There was no responding report and Gordon was upon him.
Frantically Taylor pressed the weapon to his victim's body and
pulled the trigger&mdash;futilely. In returning the clip to the
automatic when it had fallen to the ground from his nervous fingers
earlier in the evening he had reversed it, so that the cartridges
were pointed to the rear, jamming the mechanism after the first
shot had exploded the cartridge already in the chamber.</p>

<p>Once in Gordon's grasp, Taylor realized how hopelessly he was
outclassed. The clean life of his antagonist found Taylor helpless
in the other's power. Yet the man fought on desperately, for he
knew that a long prison term awaited him should he be made captive
now.</p>

<p>Around and around the room the two men struggled. Taylor beat
madly at Gordon's face, but the latter sought the other's throat,
striking only occasionally, and then only when a blow could be well
delivered and effective.</p>

<p>In the hall beyond the lion had halted before the door to sniff
and listen. From within came the sounds of combat and the scent of
friend and foe. The great beast opened his wide jaws and roared out
a thunderous challenge&mdash;a challenge that sent Washington Scott
cowering in terror to the furthermost recesses of the little closet
and brought Gordon to a momentary pause of wonder in the battle he
was waging for his life in the guest chamber of the Scott
mansion.</p>

<p>But Richard Gordon had no time to give then to an investigation
of the terrifying roar just without his room. He wondered, but he
fought on, slowly but surely overcoming the weakening Taylor.</p>

<p>The lion pushed against the door with his forepaw. It did not
open. He clawed at the panels, madly, thunderously. No frail wood
could long withstand that mighty force. Splinters were torn away.
The two men within the room heard, and one was terrified and the
other wondering.</p>

<p>Gordon was pushing Taylor back against a table, further and
further, when the latter, in a sudden and momentary burst of
energy, struggled up and fought his conqueror back a step or
two.</p>

<p>Beneath their feet lay a rug, rumpled and twisted as they had
passed back and forth across it. Gordon's feet caught in it as
Taylor surged against him, and he fell heavily backward, striking
his head against the edge of a chair.</p>

<p>Taylor could scarce credit the good fortune that had saved him
at the eleventh hour. Gordon lay unconscious beneath him. The lion
was battering the door to pieces just beyond. Behind him was an
open window leading onto the roof of the veranda. Taylor half
started to make a break for escape from the lion when the object of
his mission rushed to his mind.</p>

<p>He had risked too much to abandon all now when success, such as
it was, lay in his grasp. Hastily he sprang to his feet and ran to
the chair where Gordon's clothes lay. As he snatched up a garment
and began to run hastily through it a panel crashed in beneath the
lion's powerful blows and Taylor saw the gleaming, yellow eyes
glaring at him through the aperture.</p>

<p>With a gasp of terror the man ran his hand inside the coat, his
fingers came in contact with a long manila envelope, and he knew
that he had won. Stuffing the prize into his own pocket, he turned
and scrambled through the window to the roof of the veranda, ran to
the edge and lying upon his stomach lowered himself quickly until
he hung by his hands. Then he let go and dropped to a soft landing
in a clump of bushes beneath.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously the last of the door fell in beneath Ben's
battering, and the lion sprang into the room. For just an instant
he lowered his muzzle to the face of the prostrate Gordon, sniffed,
whined, and then caught Taylor's spoor and followed it through the
window onto the roof.</p>

<p>Gordon, but momentarily stunned, sat up just in time to see the
hindquarters of the lion disappearing through the window. Leaping
to his feet he followed and looked out. He saw the great beast
approach the spot where Taylor had dropped to the ground. For a
moment the lion stood there measuring the distance&mdash;it was too
great a leap for so heavy a beast except as a last resort.</p>

<p>Turning quickly away, the animal trotted to the far end of the
roof. Below this there was a low shed and a moment later the
carnivore was slinking through the shrubbery of the Scott grounds
hot upon the trail of the fleeing Taylor.</p>

<p>Gordon, convinced that the lion had followed Taylor, though
filled with wonder not only that a savage, jungle beast should be
roaming at large in peaceful Virginia, but as well that the brute
should have passed him by without harming him, ran from his room,
calling the servants.</p>

<p>The old butler, hearing his voice, answered him in trembling
tones from his hiding place.</p>

<p>"Mistah Go'don!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Where is he? Am he went?"</p>

<p>Gordon paused. The voice came apparently from the closet beside
him.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah's heah&mdash;in dese heah clos'es hamper. Ah's stuck fast.
If he am went please come an' hep me outen heah."</p>

<p>"He's 'went' all right," replied Gordon, opening the door of the
closet, to find that Washington had broken through the bottom and
was so tightly wedged that it required the combined efforts of them
both to liberate him. Other house servants were timorously creeping
down the stairs by this time, but when they found that a wild beast
was prowling somewhere about, most of them promptly retreated to
their rooms, where they fell to praying. A few remained to follow
Gordon back to his room. A sudden fear had crept over the young
man.</p>

<p>Taylor could have followed him for but one purpose. Had he been
successful, after all, in his quest?</p>

<p>Gordon found his coat lying on the floor, and a hasty
examination revealed the fact that the precious document had been
removed from it. Snatching an old fashioned muzzle loader from one
of the servants, Gordon hastened down the stairs and out onto the
lawn. A sullen roar down in the direction of the negroes' quarters
guided him in the direction the lion had taken, and which was,
Gordon felt sure, the same as that in which Taylor had fled.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The moment that Taylor had extricated himself from the bushes he
ran around to the front of the house and down past the negroes'
shacks, passing out onto the turnpike below them and following that
in the direction of Scottsville. He did not know that the lion had
followed him, imagining that the beast had remained to maul and
possibly to devour Gordon. The thought, while it induced a shudder,
was far from unwelcome, since it compassed the elimination of
Gordon, and so, as far as Taylor knew, the only witness to his
presence in the Scott home.</p>

<p>Behind him a silent shadow moved along his trail. In long,
undulating strides the great cat stalked its prey. Taylor had
passed behind the cabins of the negroes, for several of the blacks
were still sitting before their doorsteps strumming on their
instruments or gossiping among themselves; but the lion had caught
a glimpse of the quarry, and so no longer must follow a scent. He
had seen Taylor vault the fence into the turnpike, and without
increasing his gait he moved straight toward him. His way led past
the darkies. They had been discussing the strange sounds that had
come from the big house.</p>

<p>Broken and muffled from having issued from the interior of the
house, Ben's single roar had come down to them, half drowned by the
nearer noise of their banjos. One had thought that it might have
been the wail of a sick cow, another had attributed it to "Marse
Jefferson Scott's ghos'."</p>

<p>"It soun' to me like one a dem lines Ah done seen at de cucus
las' fall," ventured a tall, lanky black.</p>

<p>"Wow!" exclaimed a woman.</p>

<p>"Don' you talk no lines aroun' heah or Ah cain't sleep a wink
tonight for thinkin' 'bout 'em."</p>

<p>"Sho, honey," exclaimed the first speaker. "Yo don' need worry
none 'bout no lines whiles Ah'm 'roun'. Ah eats 'em alive, Ah does.
Dey ain' nuffing to be afeared of. Why, Ah seen a white man go
right in a cage wif ten of 'em, an' he takes a big whip an' he
lashes dem lines jes same 's if dey was mules. Jes laik dis," and
the darkey seized his banjo by the neck and struck out ferociously
at imaginary lions.</p>

<p>Swinging around to chastise one directly behind him, his eyes
fell upon the huge head and glittering eyes of Ben, just protruding
from about the corner of the cabin a few paces away. For one brief,
horrified, instant the black man stood petrified with terror. His
mouth flew agape, his eyes started from his head, and then, with a
blood curdling shriek, he dove head foremost for the doorway of the
cabin.</p>

<p>The sudden cessation of his valiant lion taming had attracted
the attention of the others to the direction his eyes had taken.
They, too, saw Ben but an instant after their fellow had discovered
him.</p>

<p>Their screams mingled with his, as did their arms and legs and
bodies, as the half dozen negroes launched themselves
simultaneously for the same small doorway.</p>

<p>Scrambling, clawing, screaming, fighting, they battled for the
safety of the interior until they became so tightly wedged in the
narrow aperture that they could make no further progress.</p>

<p>Ben, surprised into a sudden stop at the first sight of them,
now approached majestically, for his way led by their threshhold.
He paused a moment to sniff at the wildly kicking legs of the
tangled mass. The discord of their fear-laden voices must have
grated upon his nerves, for, with his mouth close to them, he gave
vent to a single, mighty roar, and then passed on.</p>

<p>The blacks, paralysed by terror, became rigid and silent as
death; nor did they move again until long after the great beast had
passed out of sight.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Along the road from Scottsville purred the big Scott car,
bearing Mrs. Scott and Virginia from the station to The Oaks. A
quarter of a mile below the negroes' quarters the car came to a
stop.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jackson?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>"Ah dunno, Miss," replied the chauffeur, getting down from his
seat and raising one side of the bonnet.</p>

<p>For a moment he fussed about between the engine and the control
board, trying first the starter and then the horn.</p>

<p>"Ah guess we-all blowed a fuse," he announced presently.</p>

<p>"Have you others, or must we walk the rest of the way?" inquired
Mrs. Scott.</p>

<p>"Oh, yasam, Ah got some right yere," and he raised the cushion
from the driver's seat and thrust his hand into the box beneath.
For a moment he fumbled about in search of an extra fuse plug.</p>

<p>"Who's that coming down the road?" asked Virginia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott and the chauffeur both looked up. They saw a man,
running now, directly in the middle of the road and coming in the
direction of the machine. An instant later, another figure bounded
into sight behind the man. Mechanically the chauffeur, while he
watched the approaching man, had clipped the new fuse into
place&mdash;the car was ready to run again, but at sight of the
lion the black lost his head completely, uttered a wild yell of
dismay, and bolted for the opposite side of the road, vaulted the
fence and disappeared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott and her daughter sat as though turned to stone as
they watched the frantic efforts of the man to outdistance the grim
beast now rapidly closing up to him.</p>

<p>Directly in the full glare of the headlights, not a dozen paces
from the car, the lion overtook his prey. With a savage roar and a
mighty leap he sprang full upon Taylor's back, hurling him to the
ground.</p>

<p>Virginia Scott gasped in dismay. In the man's hand was a
revolver, and as he fell he rolled upon his back and, placing the
muzzle against the lion's breast, pulled the trigger; but again the
jammed weapon failed to work, which was as well, for it would have
but inflamed the rage of the maddened beast without incapacitating
him.</p>

<p>For an instant the lion stood over his fallen enemy. He raised
his head, glaring straight into the brilliant lights of the
automobile. Fascinated with the horror of it, the two women
watched. They saw Taylor struggling futilely now beneath the huge
paw that rested upon his breast. The man's nerve was gone, he
whimpered and screamed like a terrified puppy.</p>

<p>"God!" whispered Virginia. "It's Scott!"</p>

<p>Her mother but shuddered and drew closer to her.</p>

<p>Aggravated by the struggles and the noise of his prey, Ben
lowered his head. His distended jaws were close to Taylor's face,
his yellow eyes glared into the fear-mad orbs of the man, from his
deep chest there rumbled a thunderous roar, then his jaws closed
like a huge steel trap, and Scott Taylor ceased to be.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott gave a short, involuntary scream and buried her face
in her hands. Attracted by the sound, the lion raised his dripping
jaws and again eyed the glaring light. Beyond them he could see
nothing; but from beyond them had come the sound of a human
cry.</p>

<p>Virginia watched the beast intently. Should she and her mother
leave the machine and attempt to escape, or were they safer where
they were? The lion could easily track them should he care to do so
after they had left the car. On the other hand, the strange and
unusual vehicle might be sufficient safeguard in itself to keep off
a nervous jungle beast.</p>

<p>While she was pondering these questions Ben continued to gaze
steadily toward them. Finally he lowered his head to his prey once
more, sniffed at it a moment, then seized the body by the shoulder
and dragged it a few paces to one side of the road. Here the lion
was out of the direct glare of the headlights. Again he looked
toward the car. Now he could see it. He cocked his head upon one
side and rumbled in his throat. He did not like the looks of this
strange thing. What was it? He would investigate.</p>

<p>Abandoning Taylor's body, he paced slowly forward toward the
car. Mrs. Scott shrank closer to Virginia, too terrified by this
time to scream. The girl kept her wits, but still was at a loss as
to what move to make or as to whether she could make any that would
be better than remaining rigidly quiet under the lion's
investigation.</p>

<p>The beast was beside the car now. Leisurely, he placed a forepaw
on the running board and raised himself until his giant head topped
the side of the tonneau. Slowly he intruded his wrinkled muzzle
until his nose brushed Virginia's skirt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott could bear the strain no longer. With a low moan she
fainted. Now there was no escape for Virginia. The girl steeled
herself to meet the end bravely.</p>

<p>The great cat was sniffing at her skirt and growling
hideously.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">WITH the old musket in his hands Richard Gordon
ran rapidly toward the negroes' quarters, from whence he had heard
the lion's roar. Here he found the terrified blacks still fast in
the doorway, making no move to extricate themselves. He shouted to
them, asking which way the lion had gone. Hearing a white man's
voice, the pile disentangled itself and presently one was
sufficiently recovered from his terror to inform Gordon that they
did not know which way the lion had gone, for the simple reason
that, all having their eyes shut, they had not known that he had
departed at all until they had heard Gordon's voice.</p>

<p>But from the window of an adjoining cabin, a frightened,
nightcapped head was thrust timorously, and a trembling voice
issuing from shaking lips vouchsafed the information that their
owner had seen the lion leap the fence into the turnpike and
disappear in the direction of town.</p>

<p>Without waiting to listen to the harrowing details which now
broke from a half dozen pairs of lips, Gordon ran to the fence,
vaulted it and started down the road at a rapid trot. He had gone
but a short distance when the lion's roar again sounded, this time
straight ahead and at no great distance.</p>

<p>The man, bent solely on overtaking Taylor and wresting the
manila envelope from him, went warily now that he might avoid the
lion, for he was too experienced a big game hunter to place any
reliance on the archaic weapon he carried. It would do to bring
Taylor to a stand, but for the lion it was scarce adequate, though
in the day of its prime men had hunted the king of beasts with its
counterpart&mdash;and some of them had returned to narrate their
exploits.</p>

<p>A turn in the road revealed the headlights of an automobile and
set Gordon to wondering. A little closer and he saw a crumpled
something lying at the side of the road. Gordon crept to the shadow
of the bushes that lined the fence. The moon was bright, the
shadows dense. He moved cautiously forward. The thing by the
roadside was the body of a man. It must be Taylor's. But where was
the lion?</p>

<p>Then he saw him, standing with his forefeet upon the running
board of the machine and his head thrust inside the car. A sudden
whimpering from the other side of the bushes where he crouched
attracted Gordon's attention. It sounded like a man crying.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" whispered the young New Yorker.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lawd!" exclaimed a voice from beyond the foliage. "Is dat
you, Mistah Go'don? Has de line aten 'em all up?"</p>

<p>"Eaten whom?" cried Gordon, half recognizing the voice of the
Scott chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Mis' Scott and Miss Virginia&mdash;deyse in de car, an' he's
eaten one of 'em up."</p>

<p>With a cry that was half curse and half moan Dick Gordon sprang
to his feet and without further attempt at stealth, bounded toward
the automobile. As he ran he shouted aloud to attract the lion's
attention. The beast withdrew his head from the tonneau and eyed
the intruder.</p>

<p>Gordon halted a dozen paces from him, still calling aloud in the
hope of inducing the beast to leave the machine and come toward
him.</p>

<p>With dignity the king of beasts lowered his forepaws to the
ground and turned about to face the man.</p>

<p>"Are you there, Virginia," cried Gordon. "Are you unhurt?"</p>

<p>"I'm here," she replied. "He has not touched us yet; but you!
Oh, Dick, be careful or he'll get you as he did Scott."</p>

<p>"Dick!" She had never used his first name before, and even now
in the midst of danger&mdash;in the face of death&mdash;his heart
leaped in glad response to the love and solicitude in her dear
voice.</p>

<p>"Can you drive?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can drive," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then climb over and drive," he commanded. "Drive anywhere, as
fast as you can, but, for the love of heaven, get out of here."</p>

<p>"But you?"</p>

<p>"Never mind me, I'm armed," and he raised the futile old relic
of Revolutionary days to his shoulder.</p>

<p>The girl, realizing that her mother's safety lay in her hands
and that neither could help Gordon, clambered over into the
driver's seat and started the engine. With the whir of the starter
Ben wheeled about with a low snarl, but in the instant the girl
drew the speed lever back into low, pressed down on the
accelerator, let in the clutch, and the car shot forward.</p>

<p>Still the lion seemed in doubt. He took a few steps toward the
car, which he could easily reach in a single bound. He paid no
attention now to Gordon, and the latter, fearing that the beast
might spring upon the passing car, burned his bridges behind him
and did the one thing that occurred to him to divert the brute's
attention.</p>

<p>In the few moments that he had watched the animal he had become
half convinced that the lion was his former friend of the jungle
and the steamer. He could not be sure, but the magnificent
proportions and the massive head were the same.</p>

<p>Even so he could scarce hope that the savage beast, maddened by
the taste of human blood and rendered nervous by all through which
it had passed during the brief interval since it had entered the
Scott home, would recall him or its former friendliness toward
him.</p>

<p>But this was all apart from the main issue&mdash;the saving of
Virginia and her mother from those rending fangs. The man had held
his musket leveled for a moment on the lion's shoulder, and then,
with an exclamation of disgust, had tossed it aside. He would pit
all against the chance that the lion was Ben, and so, shouting
loudly, he ran straight for the grim beast.</p>

<p>Glancing behind him the lion saw the man approaching rapidly. He
paused, and the car, shooting into second and high, sped beyond his
reach. Then the lion turned to face Gordon, and Gordon, seeing that
the occupants of the car were beyond harm, halted in his
tracks.</p>

<p>For seconds that seemed hours to the man the two stood facing
each other. It was the lion who moved first. He advanced slowly and
deliberately.</p>

<p>The moonlight flooded him. Gordon's eyes dropped to the great
forearm, searching for the jagged scar that might at least give him
some faint hope. Nor did he look in vain, for there, plain in the
moonlight was the serrated mark that told him that the beast was
Ben.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with his discovery came a loud hail from
the field below the road. The lion halted at the sound and both he
and Gordon turned their eyes in the direction of the voice. They
saw three men, armed with rifles. They were the circus owner and
the two keepers. "Stand where you are," shouted the owner. "That
beast is a devil. Don't move and we can get him before he
charges."</p>

<p>At the same instant the three raised their guns and took aim at
the splendid statue standing rigid in the moonlight.</p>

<p>It has been said that Mr. Richard Gordon was a creature of
impulse, nor did his next act belie his reputation. Twice, Ben,
King of Beasts, had spared his life. Tonight he had captured and
punished the scoundrel, who would have killed Gordon but for the
timely appearance of the lion. The man's debt to the beast was one
that Richard Gordon could not, in honor, ignore.</p>

<p>With a cry of "Don't shoot!" he leaped toward the lion, placing
himself between the animal and the rifles. He was so close that he
could touch the tawny shoulder. Ben lowered his head and sniffed
Gordon's clothing. A little whine escaped the savage lips. Gordon
put forth his hand and laid it on the shaggy mane and the lion
pressed close against the side, rubbing his head along the man's
leg.</p>

<p>The astonished owner and keepers lowered their rifles and
approached a trifle nearer, though still keeping a safe
distance.</p>

<p>"For the love o' Mike," exclaimed one of them. "Whadya know
about that!"</p>

<p>"Who in the name of Phineas T. Barnum are you, anyway?" asked
the owner.</p>

<p>"I'm a friend of Ben's," Gordon laughed back, and then, briefly,
he told them of his past acquaintance with the animal.</p>

<p>"Want to sell him?" he asked finally.</p>

<p>"He's a very valuable animal," commented the owner, shrewdly,
sensing a profitable deal, but Gordon interrupted him.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I'll just let him go and you can come and
get your valuable animal."</p>

<p>The owner laughed. "You got me, I guess," he said. "What'll you
give me for him?"</p>

<p>"Just what you paid for him, plus transportation charges to the
New York Zoo&mdash;I'm going to present him to the city."</p>

<p>"It's a go," said the owner. "We couldn't never take him alive
without your help."</p>

<p>"Throw me your ropes," commanded Gordon. "I'll put them on him
and then we'll lead him up the road to the house of a friend of
mine until you can get his cage over here."</p>

<p>Without difficulty he adjusted two ropes about Ben's neck,
tossed an end of each to a keeper, patted the lion on the head, and
turned his attention to the body of Taylor beside the road. His
first thought was of the manila envelope and this he quickly found
and transferred to his own pocket. Then he sought for signs of
life, but a careful examination revealed the fact that Taylor was
dead.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said, and taking his place at Ben's shoulder he
led the way up the road to the Scott lawn.</p>

<p>At sight of the lion entering the grounds the servants who were
gathered about the veranda steps fled to the interior of the house,
leaving Mrs. Scott and Virginia alone. The girl saw with relief
that Gordon was unharmed and that the lion had been secured, and
running down the steps she hastened forward to meet the young
man.</p>

<p>Taking both hands in hers as he stepped forward from the lion,
she tried to thank him, but her voice choked and the words would
not come. He pressed her hands tightly in his and led her onto the
veranda, where Mrs. Scott awaited them.</p>

<p>"At last," he said, and handed her the manila envelope. She took
it in nervous fingers as she thanked him for all that he had risked
and done for her and here she mechanically tore the wrapper open.
In the brilliant moonlight even fine print might easily have been
read, and as she withdrew the contents of the envelope she gave a
little exclamation of surprise as her eyes fell upon the sheaf of
papers within.</p>

<p>"Why, what are these?" she exclaimed, running quickly through
them.</p>

<p>Gordon and Virginia stepped to her side.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the library," said Mrs. Scott. "I do not find
the marriage certificate here."</p>

<p>Together the three stepped into the house. Outside the keepers,
each having taken a turn about a tree with his rope, waited for the
return of the owner, who had gone back to the wreck for a team of
horses and a wheeled cage for Ben. The lion, nervous now that
Gordon had left him, growled continuously.</p>

<p>Inside, Virginia, Mrs. Scott and Gordon leaned over the long
library table, upon which were spread the contents of the manila
envelope, under the strong light of a reading lamp. Carefully
Gordon examined each paper.</p>

<p>"Why these are stock certificates of considerable value," he
said. "There is no marriage certificate here. But our quest was not
entirely in vain. These certificates, probably of no great value
when they were purchased years ago, now represent a fortune. There
are several industrials alone that are worth today more than a
hundred times what they must have sold for when these were issued.
They are in your father's name, Mrs. Scott."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the marriage certificate," responded the older woman.
"What can have become of it? I so wanted it, after the unjust
accusation of Scott Taylor."</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is a mystery," he said. "I brought every article that
remained in the strong box beneath the hearth. There was no
evidence that another had been there before us&mdash;had there
been, he would have removed these also, and the few pieces of
jewelry that were hidden there."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Scott, with a sigh, "of course now it is just
a sentiment, I suppose, for whether Virginia is allowed the
property of her grandfather or not she will be independently
wealthy in possession of these stocks alone."</p>

<p>Just then a startled cry resounded through the house. It came
from the music room behind them, and as they turned in that
direction they beheld Washington Scott, ashy blue from fright, rush
trembling into the library from the music room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lordy, Miss Ruth!" he cried. "Dere's a daid man in de music
room&mdash;wif his face all chawed off'n him. Oh, Lordy!"</p>

<p>Gordon stepped quickly to the door of the music room, and there
on the floor revealed by the light from the library lamp that
filtered into the room, lay a sight that caused him to turn and
warn back Virginia, who was following close upon his heels.</p>

<p>"Ben has been here ahead of us," he explained. "This must be one
of Taylor's companions&mdash;Kelley probably, though his face is
not recognizable now. Washington," he continued, turning to the
shaking black, "bring me a sheet&mdash;I'll cover this&mdash;and
then you might telephone to town for the Coroner and an
undertaker."</p>

<p>When Washington had fulfilled his missions he clung closely
about the family, evidently terrified at the thought of going to
other parts of the house for fear he might stumble upon others of
Ben's victims.</p>

<p>"Let's go upstairs and see where he broke down the door of your
room, Dick," suggested Virginia, and together, Washington bringing
up the rear, they all filed up the stairway.</p>

<p>The splintered door filled the two women with amazement, so
complete had been its destruction, and then Washington, wishing to
share some of the glory of the adventure, called their attention to
his hiding place.</p>

<p>"Ah done broke through de bottom," he giggled nervously.
Virginia, taking a lamp from the old servant's hand, peered into
the cupboard.</p>

<p>"Why, there's quite an opening beneath this," she remarked, and
reflecting the lamp's rays downward with her palm she looked into
the black hole beneath the splintered flooring. A moment later she
had thrust her hand and arm deep into the aperture, and when she
withdrew them she held a shiny, black box.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose this is doing here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It must have been a secret hiding place of your grandfather's
for valuables," suggested her mother.</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at the contents then," cried the girl, but
the box would not open to her efforts.</p>

<p>She handed it to Gordon.</p>

<p>"See if you can open it," she said.</p>

<p>Gordon examined it for a moment.</p>

<p>"It's locked&mdash;we'll have to pry it open," he said. "Get a
screw driver, please, Washington, and we'll go down to the library
again and investigate Miss Virginia's find."</p>

<p>By the time Washington had located a screw driver the others had
gathered once more about the library table, the little black box
the center of attraction. With the tool Gordon quickly pried the
lid open, disclosing a number of papers within. These he handed
immediately to Mrs. Scott, who ran through them quickly. "Why,
here's your grandfather's missing will, Virginia," she cried,
handing a legal appearing document to the girl.</p>

<p>"Sure enough," exclaimed the latter, glancing through it. "And
it is just as Judge Sperry said, he has left everything to me, with
the exception of the income from certain property which is to be
yours, mother, during the balance of your life."</p>

<p>"What is in that manila envelope?" asked Gordon. "It bears a
startling resemblance to one that I carried from Central Africa to
Central Virginia."</p>

<p>Virginia picked up the envelope in question and opened it. Her
voice rounded into a little "Oh!" of delighted surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, mother!" she cried. "Here it is right here. Here it has
been all the time, right under our noses, and we never knew it and
sent Dick almost to his death looking for it in Africa," and she
handed the much sought for and elusive marriage certificate to her
mother.</p>

<p>A hand long dead had placed it in that envelope, and in the
hurry of Robert Gordon's departure from the mission had mistaken
the manila envelope containing it for another identically like it
which held the valuable stock certificates that Reverend Sangamon
Morton had wished to send to his son-in-law's father for
safe-keeping.</p>

<p>"My mission was not entirely fruitless, however," remarked
Gordon, gazing smilingly into Virginia's eyes.</p>

<p>"Indeed it was not," cried Mrs. Scott, not catching the double
meaning of his words. "Had it not been for you Ben would have died
in the pit the natives dug for him. Washington would not have had
to clamber into the cupboard to escape him, and the secret of the
false bottom and the little box might have gone undiscovered for
generations. In reality it is to you we owe the finding of the
stock certificates&mdash;and, candidly I am most interested in the
marriage certificate; but then I am a sentimental old woman," and
she laughed gently.</p>

<p>"I too am interested in a marriage certificate," remarked
Gordon, and again he looked into Virginia's eyes, and again she
looked away.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the young people strolled out onto the lawn
together to have a look at Ben. The great lion whined a delighted
welcome as he caught sight of Gordon. The girl he permitted to
approach him, too. On either side of the massive head the two
stood, their fingers twined in the black mane. Across the savage
head their eyes met, and held.</p>

<p>"I love you," said Mr. Richard Gordon, for the keepers were
drowsing at their posts.</p>

<p>Virginia cast a quick glance in their direction. Neither was
looking. She leaned forward toward the man, and their lips met
above the fierce and loyal head of Ben, King of Beasts.</p>

<p>And if you do not believe their story, just go to the Zoo the
next time you are in New York, and look for a great, black maned
lion with a scar upon one of his mighty forearms.</p>
