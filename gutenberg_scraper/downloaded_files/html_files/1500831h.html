  <p class="first">"SO it is all over, monsieur. To-morrow morning you leave
  for England. Five o'clock, is it not so? I will come to the train for the
  last shake of the hand."</p>

  <p>Alphonse Revailloud smiled at the young suburnt face of his companion as
  they sat opposite to one another at a little table on the balcony above the
  roaring glacier stream. The two had touched glasses and drunk. With nightfall
  there had come, as always, a freshness upon Chamounix. The air of that little
  town at the bottom of a cup had grown brisk. It was the first week of August.
  One might have believed it to be the last of spring, even though no wind blew
  and the day had been close. Both men were silent for a little while. They had
  been six weeks together, passing from the Bernese Oberland to the Pennine
  Alps about Zermatt, and from Zermatt to the Aiguilles of Mont Blanc&mdash;six
  weeks of a very true comradeship. Rivers sat and lived through them again.
  The long, wearisome walks from the valleys to the huts, and from the huts in
  the dark of the morning, over stones and moraines, to the foot of the climb,
  were forgotten. He remembered only the cheery evenings in the mountain inns,
  the sunlit hour upon this or that summit, where there was just room for
  Revailloud and himself to sit, and the climbs themselves. The traverse of the
  Matterhorn from Breuil, the rocks of the Shreckhorn, the ice-slope of the Col
  Dolent, the desperate scramble up the Grépon and the last climb, to-day's
  traverse of the Aiguilles de Charmoz, crowded upon his memories. He looked
  upwards from the balcony towards the dark, clear sky. A planet shone in the
  gaps between Mont Blanc and the Aiguille du Midi, an extra depth of darkness
  showed where the rock cliffs towered, a paleness where the snowfields
  glimmered down towards the Glacier des Bossons.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "for me it is all over. But not for you, Alphonse. This is
  the first week of August. You have five weeks still."</p>

  <p>Alphonse Revailloud shook his head, and Rivers suddenly became conscious
  of something very forlorn in his aspect. Revailloud took off his hat and laid
  it on a chair beside him.</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur; I have made my last big expedition to-day."</p>

  <p>He was only fifty-four, but he was quite bald, the thin beard upon his
  chin was very grey, his eyes were bloodshot, his face deeply lined and worn.
  He had certainly the look this evening of a quite old, sad man.</p>

  <p>"You!" exclaimed Rivers. "You go as well as ever. The little chimney on
  the top of the Charmoz, for instance, to-day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," replied Alphonse. "But my eyes are no longer good. My feet
  too, burn too much. <i>Les petites courses</i>! They remain for me. I shall
  lead mules up to the Montanvers, and take parties of ladies to the
  'Jardin.'"</p>

  <p>He spoke sadly, looking up to the mountains, but without any
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>"It was bound to come, of course, but I admit, monsieur, I do not look
  forward to leading mules up to the Montanvers. There will be no more
  travelling, no more visiting old friends at Grindelwald, and Arolla, and
  Zermatt. It is good, isn't it, to see old friends? All that is over. I shall
  lead mules up to the Montanvers. I think, monsieur, that life is very
  sad."</p>

  <p>Rivers knew not what to say. He himself was touched. The name of Alphonse
  Revailloud was historic in the records of the chain of Mont Blanc. Alphonse
  had been the best of the Chamounix, guides thirty years ago, when the
  Aiguilles were for the greater part virgin peaks; and of the first ascents
  the most difficult were associated with his name. Yet now he sat, an old man
  before his time, with nothing left in life, it seemed, but to conduct parties
  on the <i>mer de glace</i> and lead mules up to the Montanvers&mdash;a sad,
  dull life for a great climber.</p>

  <p>"You never married, Alphonse?" said Rivers out of his sympathy. The guide
  was to be penned in the valley of Chamounix; a wife and children would have
  made the pen more comfortable.</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever wish to?"</p>

  <p>"Once, monsieur. But I think that I am very fortunate not to have had my
  wish," he said, with a smile. "She was fond of comforts and luxuries. And
  those tastes will not match with poverty."</p>

  <p>"Poverty?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We have two months in the year, that's all. If we make two thousand
  francs, monsieur, we are fortunate."</p>

  <p>Eighty pounds a year! Rivers compared the sum with the earnings of a
  professional cricketer in England. It seemed very small. And these men risked
  their lives into the bargain. Rivers remembered a sentence which Alphonse had
  uttered to one of those who decry the risks and increase the accidents in the
  Alps. <i>"Il y a toujours du danger,"</i> he had said. It was as though
  Alphonse had been following Rivers's thoughts. For he suddenly leaned
  forward.</p>

  <p>"There was an accident upon the mountain we ascended to-day. It happened a
  little while ago. It was an Englishman. He preferred to climb with only one
  guide. He had climbed the Charmoz, and was descending. He was clever and sure
  upon the rocks, but not safe at all upon ice. I was sitting here with his
  guide the afternoon before, a man from the Val Tournanche, and he was saying
  that this would be the last climb he would undertake with Mr. Briggs alone.
  Mr. Briggs, that was the name, but you see he made that last climb, and,
  coming down, one of them slipped upon the glacier. I showed you the crevasse
  where we found them. The glacier is steep above it, and there was very little
  snow that year. It was ice, ice, ice everywhere, where, as a rule, there is
  snow. I have never known glaciers so uncovered."</p>

  <p>"Even this year?" said the Englishman.</p>

  <p>"This year it is about the same," replied Alphonse. "Perhaps that is why I
  remember that incident so vividly. Yet I do not think that is the reason. You
  will understand perhaps." He was silent for a moment or two, and then
  resumed.</p>

  <p>"I had come over Mont Blanc from Courmayeur that day, and in the evening I
  heard that Mr. Briggs had not returned. We went up to the Plan de l'Aiguille
  in the night, the hut where you slept yesterday, monsieur. There were half a
  dozen of us, but I was the oldest. At all events, they looked to me for
  direction. We reached the Glacier de Nantillon at daybreak, and ascended it
  to the rocks, between that glacier and the Glacier du Midi. At the top of the
  rocks we took to the glacier again, following in the steps which they had
  cut. Finally we came to the great crevasse. Beyond its upper edge the glacier
  rose steeply towards the great seracs.* We looked down into its depths. It
  was deeper then than it is now, yet not so deep but that we could see the
  bottom. The two men were lying there quite still. We called to them. They did
  not move, nor answer.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* A serac (originally from Swiss French <i>sérac</i>) is
  a block or column of glacial ice, often formed by intersecting crevasses on a
  glacier. Commonly house-sized or larger, they are dangerous to mountaineers
  since they may topple with little warning. Even when stabilized by persistent
  cold weather, they can be an impediment to glacier travel.
  <i>Wikipedia</i>]</p>

  <p>"It was evident how the accident had happened. Both men were hurrying over
  the glacier in the afternoon. They were right to hurry. For there were some
  of the seracs on the top of the glacier which looked ready to fall, and it
  would not have been wise to have loitered underneath them in the afternoon.
  But the guide was no doubt leading too fast for Mr. Briggs, who was not safe
  on ice. At the point where they slipped you will remember that it is
  necessary to traverse the glacier horizontally; and if one man slipped there
  he would swing down the whole length of the rope before the jerk came upon
  the other. No doubt that is what happened. Mr. Briggs slipped, and dragged
  his guide out of his steps. Jean Prévôt, a young porter, and I were lowered
  together into the crevasse. We found both men quite dead. The crevasse was
  not so deep but that the guide might have climbed out of it if he had lived.
  But his neck was broken, and he must have died at once. Mr. Briggs had lived
  for a little while. That was clear, for the snow, just about where he lay,
  was all kicked by his feet. He had lain there for a little while and
  suffered. We tied a rope about his middle, and then, holding him as well as I
  could, I climbed up, while those above hauled upon the rope. His face was
  covered with blood, and he was frozen. It was difficult to support him."</p>

  <p>Alphonse described the recovery of the bodies with a matter-of-fact
  minuteness of detail.</p>

  <p>"His head continually knocked against mine. At last we reached the mouth
  of the crevasse, and were drawn up into the sunlight. But we very nearly were
  dropped to the bottom again. For, as our heads rose above the lip of the
  crevasse, I saw the face of the guide who was hauling upon the rope in front
  of me suddenly go green. He let go the rope, and was very sick. Luckily,
  there were others behind him, older men, to whom this expedition was no new
  thing, and they held firm. Well, we were brought out of the crevasse, and I
  was lowered into it again. At the bottom I found Jean Prévôt standing by the
  side of the dead guide. He was shivering, partly with cold, perhaps, but not
  altogether. He pointed to the dead man, and said 'Look!' I looked, and I saw
  that his head was completely frozen into a block of ice. We had to cut the
  ice away with our axes, and while I did the work Jean Prévôt stood at my
  side, saying, with a kind of horror in his voice: 'See what any of us poor
  guides may come to!' I think that it is because of those words that I
  remember the accident so vividly to-night."</p>

  <p>"You felt the horror, too," said Rivers.</p>

  <p>"Then, yes. But to-night not so much. To-night I feel, monsieur, that life
  is very sad."</p>

  <p>He drank up his glass of beer and rose from his chair.</p>

  <p>"You have to pack, monsieur." He held out his hand. "When you come back
  next year, with another guide, you will perhaps come and see me."</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>They shook hands, and Alphonse put on his hat and walked away. Certainly,
  although his walk was sure, he had the look of a very old man. To Rivers,
  whose heart had been touched by the guide's unexpected words, there was more
  than age visible in his aspect. There, was a most pitiful look of loneliness
  as well.</p>

  <p><br>
  Alphonse walked through the lighted streets. One or two of his friends called
  to him from the group which crowds at night the space where the four streets
  meet, but he took no notice. His thoughts were back in the early days of the
  Mont Blanc chain, when the Dru and the Géant and the Grépon and the Pic Sans
  Nom were all unscaled. He recalled the many attempts and defeats; the moments
  when you thought you might go forward, but were very sure that if you did you
  could not come back; the moments when it was decided to venture all upon that
  chance; the exhilaration of effort, the final triumph. But most of all he
  thought of that crevasse upon the Glacier du Nantillon, and of the guide
  lying there with his head frozen in the ice, killed suddenly in the fullness
  of his strength. To Alphonse the death seemed enviable. He came to the end of
  the town and walked for a little way between fields. It was true that his
  name was associated with many of the aiguilles which towered, an extra depth
  of darkness, in the dark sky above him. But to-morrow he would begin upon
  "<i>les petites courses</i>." To-morrow he would be leading mules up to the
  Montanvers. He pushed open the door of his dark and empty cottage. "See what
  any of us poor guides may come to," he said to himself, repeating the words
  which Jean Prévôt had spoken in the crevasse, but in a very different
  connection.</p>
