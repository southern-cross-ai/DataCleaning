  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; WYCOMBE RANCH</h2>

  <p class="first">When Jim Silver came over the last divide, he could see the
  ranch house among the low foothills, and beyond the foothills was the desert.
  It looked like a green smudge, an olive-green drab; but he knew that at close
  hand the green would thin out to a sparse scattering of shrubs, all of which
  were arrayed in foliage which was no more than a mist, the leaves turning
  their edges up so as to split the full heat of the sun that would have
  withered them. He knew that only the toughest grass would be found yonder,
  and that in occasional tufts which keep a cow steadily walking as it grazes
  all day long.</p>

  <p>Yet in the distance the effect of the rolling desert was green, though it
  was not the luminous sheen of well-watered country, but rather as grasslands
  appear under cloud or seen through a fog of dust. To look at that desert made
  the day seem overcast, though a brilliant sun was shining. The burning weight
  of it on the shoulders of Jim Silver told him with what force it was shining,
  and so did the little white streaks of salt that appeared all over the hide
  of his chestnut stallion where the sweat had sprung out and dried as it began
  to run.</p>

  <p>The band of his sombrero was hot and soggy. He took off the hat, pulled
  out a bandanna, and mopped the leather band, then dried his forehead and the
  back of his neck. Now that his hat was off for a moment, one could see the
  two marks of gray hair above his temples, like small horns breaking through.
  He had gained his name of Silver or "Silvertip" from those spots of white
  hair. He was called "Arizona Jim" and other names as well, but his real name
  was as much a secret as the wellspring of that quiet smile which was found
  more often in his eyes than about his lips.</p>

  <p>He had the look of a man who is sufficient unto himself and who relies
  upon greater strength than even that which appeared in his long arms and in
  his heavy shoulders. Or perhaps it was the stallion&mdash;a great, glimmering
  sheen of gold&mdash;that made him seem as much at home on the verge of the
  mountains and the desert as any hawk afloat in the sky.</p>

  <p>The smile which was habitually his disappeared as he marked the gray-white
  of the ranch house among the hills. For he had no need to pull the letter out
  of his pocket; he could remember every word that Steve Wycombe had
  written:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Silver</span>: You've always hated
  my heart.<br>
  <br>
  That's all right, because I've always hated yours, too. But now there's a
  chance that we can use one another. I'm asking you to come over to see me
  because I've got as big a job as you ever tackled in your life&mdash;and I
  know that you've had some big ones. Hard cash is what I'm talking about. I
  pay, and you take, and your job is the sort of hell fire that you prefer to
  breathe.<br>
  <br>
  Just by accident I've heard that you're drifting north, and that's why I'm
  leaving this letter in Rusty Gulch in the hope that you may call for mail
  there.<br>
  <br>
  I want you to try to forget the old days and believe that I'm talking the
  sort of business that you always like to hear.<br>
  <br>
  Adios,<br>
  <br>
  <span class="scmap">steve wycombe</span></p><br>

  <p>Silver recalled the words of the letter, now, as he settled the hat again
  on his head. And, as the shadow fell over his face, the hazel of his eyes
  lightened to a flicker of yellow fire, as certain types of hazel eyes can do.
  For he could remember very well a few of those old days when he had known
  Steve Wycombe before the inheriting of a ranch had removed Steve from the
  ranks of the professional gamblers and gunmen.</p>

  <p>Wycombe had been half fox and half wolf. He had both teeth and cunning,
  plus what Jim Silver hated more than anything else in the world&mdash;the
  smooth and ingratiating manner of the born hypocrite.</p>

  <p>However, the letter had called Silver across the mountains. He knew that
  Wycombe might be setting a trap for him, but a great part of Silver's time
  was spent in avoiding the traps which his enemies laid for him. Besides,
  there was a ring of sincerity in the words of Wycombe that led Silver to
  believe that the man might have fallen into a need greater than his hatred;
  it might be just possible that Steve was willing to forget that day when
  Silver had shamed him before many men in Gold Gulch.</p>

  <p>So, for the moment, Jim Silver balanced the question nicely in his mind.
  At last, he rubbed the tips of his gloved fingers down the arch of the
  stallion's neck and murmured:</p>

  <p>"Parade, it looks like trouble, it feels like trouble, and it probably is
  trouble. But all oats and no trouble would make us too fat to work."</p>

  <p>He spoke again, and the stallion started down the easy slope at a trot.
  His rider kept no rein; but, having selected a direction, gave his mind to
  other things while the horse picked out the way that suited him best. He was
  not compelled to go over hard beds of rock if he saw going more to his taste
  to the right or the left; he was not forced straight on through stifling dust
  if he wished to take a higher route; in all things he was allowed to do
  pretty much as he pleased, so long as he sailed by the right star, so to
  speak.</p>

  <p>If the man and the saddle had been removed and the horse considered by
  itself, one might have said that Parade was running wild, such was the height
  of his head and the free fire in his eye. There was not even a bit between
  his teeth, but only a light hackamore of braided horsehair. But, though he
  picked his own way, he remained true to the direction which had been given to
  him, as though from the first he had seen the low, sprawling line of the
  ranch house with the spider-webbing of corral fences near it.</p>

  <p>As he went over a winding trail out of the clean brown of the sun-burned
  mountain slopes and into the dry mauve of the desert, Jim Silver took heed of
  the grazing cattle, true desert types rather roached of back and down of
  head; lean, active creatures which could forage actively and use their legs
  to go from pasture to water, even at a gallop. Off to the left, four or five
  miles from the house, he saw the sheen of a body of water where the spring
  rains had been dammed up in a "tank," and trailing out of the distance were
  dust clouds that rapidly approached the lake. Those were cattle on the run
  for moisture, and the sight of them at once told Silver the dimensions of the
  Wycombe ranch.</p>

  <p>As far as the eye could reach, all of this land belonged to Steve Wycombe,
  and, no matter how many acres were needed to support a cow, there was enough
  mileage to give pasturage to a big herd. Therefore, one important fact was
  assured&mdash;that Wycombe had enough money to be in big trouble. For, if
  money is the root of all trouble, the size of the root is apt to gauge the
  size of the trouble.</p>

  <p>The hands of big Jim Silver slid up inside his coat and touched the
  handles of the two oversize Colts which hung in spring holsters under the
  pits of his arms. He glanced down, also, at the Winchester which fitted into
  the saddle holster that sloped down under his right knee.</p>

  <p>The ranch house was split into two wings, one section to give bunks for
  the hired hands, and the other for the occupancy of the owner; the kitchen
  was in the small link that joined the two. A windmill, whirring, moaning,
  clanking, arose on great skeleton legs of iron.</p>

  <p>The possibility of digging down to water was enough to explain the
  presence of the house on this site. As he came closer, Silver could hear the
  plumping sound of the stream as it fell with a regular pulsation into the
  galvanized-iron tank near the mill. He thought instinctively of the days of
  calm when that wheel would not turn and when the long-handled pump would have
  to be used instead. Just inside the first corral there was a long line of
  troughs. If the tanks that held spring rain went dry, the cattle could be
  watered&mdash;in part, at least&mdash;from these troughs.</p>

  <p>Silver went into that corral and slipped the hackamore off the head of the
  stallion. Parade was instantly eye-deep in the sparkle of the water. Silver
  watched the boluses of water glide rapidly down the throat of the horse.
  Again and again the dripping head of the horse was tossed up so that he could
  look around him, certain proof that he had known what it meant to run wild
  and fend for himself.</p>

  <p>Silver put his hand on the neck of the horse, smiling, and after that
  Parade drank steadily, with eyes at peace, switching his tail and shrinking
  his hide to get off the flies that came swarming. As he finished drinking,
  the door of the house jerked open. A man with a pearl-gray sombrero on the
  back of his head, wearing a bright-yellow shirt and an unbuttoned vest, stood
  on the threshold for an instant; then he shouted, "Silver! Hi!" and came
  hurrying.</p>

  <p>That was Steve Wycombe. Silver, watching him, knew that he could have
  remembered the man by the swagger of his walk and the cant of his head. A
  woman appeared in the dimness of the interior of the kitchen, from the door
  of which Wycombe had gone out. She stood close enough to the sunshine for
  Silver to see that her hair was bright and that her face was young. Then she
  closed the door.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she was Mrs. Steve Wycombe, poor girl!</p>

  <p>Wycombe came up with his head to one side, nodding, smiling. He had
  projecting upper teeth so that he could only grin broadly with a great flash
  of the teeth or else hang his upper lip in a crooked sneer. The grin was very
  broad, just now.</p>

  <p>There is something about buckteeth that makes a man look young and
  innocent. That was the appearance of Wycombe, in the main, except that his
  eyes could be pocketed up in wrinkles that were not always lines of mirth. He
  was not bad-looking, but he wore his hat like a tough, and he had his blond
  hair combed down over his forehead so that he had to keep tossing his head to
  throw back the lock out of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Old boy Jim Silver!" he said with emphasis.</p>

  <p>He came up and took Silver's hand and held it through a long moment. He
  was one of those fellows who stand close when they speak to a man, and use
  their eyes up and down. That was the way he scanned Silver.</p>

  <p>"You haven't shrunk any!" he said. "Come on in and put yourself outside a
  drink. I've got some seventeen-year-old rye. When I say seventeen, I don't
  mean seven. I'm glad to see you, you big steer!"</p>

  <p>"I'm putting up the horse first," said Silver. "That the shed? Or do you
  keep all your saddle stock out?"</p>

  <p>"That's the shed. Come along," answered Wycombe. "This is Parade, eh? He
  looks as though he could move. That's a shoulder! That's as fine a shoulder
  as I ever saw on a thoroughbred!"</p>

  <p>"Watch yourself," said Jim Silver. "He'll take your arm out by the roots,
  if you don't."</p>

  <p>"Savage, eh?" asked Wycombe. His step back was as swift as that of a
  dancer. The whole man became suddenly quick and light, and that reminded
  Silver of sundry unlucky fellows who had discovered the deftness of Wycombe's
  gun hand too late. Doctors were of very little use after Wycombe had made his
  play.</p>

  <p>They put up the horse in the shed. Silver unsaddled Parade, rubbed him
  down with some big twists of straw, and selected the best hay he could find
  in the mow of the shed. There were no oats; he poured crushed barley into the
  feed box.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," commented Wycombe. "Take a slick horse like that, and it's
  like a slick woman. Needs a lot of caring for. I don't know that it's
  worthwhile. Take a mustang, you throw a rope and climb on and ride as far as
  you want. If the bronc is used up, throw it away; it doesn't cost
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Parade will stand the rough use, too," answered Silver. "But a horse is
  like a gun. It's better clean."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. But when you need a gun, you need it," observed Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"Times when I've needed Parade," said Silver, smiling.</p>

  <p>Wycombe looked at him with a sudden seriousness, his upper lip crookedly
  suspended on his buckteeth.</p>

  <p>"You've been through it, all right," he said. "You've seen everything that
  a man can see."</p>

  <p>He added, rather sharply: "You used to hate my heart. What about it,
  Jim?"</p>

  <p>"We can all be wrong, Wycombe," said Silver coldly.</p>

  <p>They went back to the house in a silence, with a shadow between them; but
  when they reached the place, Wycombe winked and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Want you to see something," he said, and opened the door to the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>The girl with the bright hair sat in a corner by the window, peeling
  potatoes. She had one pan in her lap, another on the floor beside her. She
  stood up, holding the pan between her elbows, smiling at the stranger the way
  Western girls are supposed to do. She had a good, straight smile, and her
  eyes were a stain of blue in her face. To Silver she seemed almost beautiful,
  which was as much as he seemed able to say about any woman.</p>

  <p>"This is Esther Maxwell," said Wycombe. "Shake hands with her, Jim. She
  don't need an introduction to you. She knows about Jim Silver. Everybody
  knows about you. How big does he look to you, Esther?"</p>

  <p>She kept right on smiling at Silver, as he stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"My fingers are all sloppy from the potatoes. I can't shake hands," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"How big does he look to you?" insisted Wycombe.</p>

  <p>Silver glanced sidelong at his host.</p>

  <p>"He looks so big," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Wycombe, laughing, led the way into the next room, put his back against
  the door as he closed it, and winked and nodded at Silver.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't wear the Wycombe brand, yet," he murmured, "but it's going
  to, boy! Pretty slick, eh? You see her dolled up for a dance and you see
  something. Works like a Chinaman, too."</p>

  <p>He walked on, tapping himself on the chest, his teeth flashing.</p>

  <p>"All for me, brother," he said.</p>

  <p>He led the way into the next room.</p>

  <p>"Office," he said. "All the papers and everything. Here's where little
  Steve works the brains; the cowboys have to work the hands."</p>

  <p>He kept on laughing as Silver ran his glance over the square box of a
  room. There was one overstuffed chair in it that looked out of place, like a
  fur coat on a summer day.</p>

  <p>"Sit down there while I crack open the hooch," said Wycombe. "It's going
  to open your eye for you, brother. But tell me first what you think of
  that."</p>

  <p>He hooked his thumb over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"She's a pretty girl," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"She's pretty and she's handsome. She's a performer, is what she is. All
  mine, brother. All for me!"</p>

  <p>He continued to chuckle as he took a bottle out of a cupboard and filled
  two whisky glasses. "Just take a sock at this," he said.</p>

  <p>Silver tasted it with his eyes studiously aslant. He smiled in honor of
  that noble liquor, not of his host; then they drank together.</p>

  <p>"Now what?" asked Silver. "This is good stuff. But now what?"</p>

  <p>Wycombe slowly thrust out his lower jaw as he answered: "Two hombres want
  to lift my hair. Two real bad boys. They've already started on the way. They
  might arrive here any old time. But when they come, they're going to find
  your guns working for me!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash; THE FOREMAN</h2>

  <p class="first">Wycombe held the glass in his right hand with his forefinger
  pointing out from it at Silver, fixing him in place, preventing speech.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk," he said. "Wait till I get finished. Don't say 'No' till you
  understand why you ought to say 'Yes'! You remember me out of the old days.
  But I'm different now. I'm no tinhorn gambler, these days. I can play for
  stakes. And what do you think that life is worth to a rich man?"</p>

  <p>"You're handy with a gun," said Silver. "Take care of yourself."</p>

  <p>"I'm handy. You bet, I'm handy. But I'm bright, too. I'm so bright that I
  know when the other fellow has the high hand. And two high hands are going to
  be sitting in against me, before long."</p>

  <p>"How high?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Straight flushes!" said Wycombe.</p>

  <p>Silver sat up in his chair a little.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right in a fight, but I'm not that right," said Wycombe. "I know
  it, and they know it. That makes it bad. I know they can beat me, and they
  know it, too. None of us are in the dark. That's what makes it bad."</p>

  <p>"That makes it bad," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"They're coming for me with all the cards in the world," went on Wycombe,
  "and they think that they've got the pot already; but I'm switching things on
  'em. They're going to find me sitting against their two straight flushes with
  a royal flush. And that's you!"</p>

  <p>He kept on jabbing his forefinger in the direction of Silver.</p>

  <p>"If you see white water ahead, take a trip," said Silver. "For my part,
  I'm busy."</p>

  <p>"Busy doing what?"</p>

  <p>"I'm traveling."</p>

  <p>"You are always traveling. Where?"</p>

  <p>"Up the line," said Silver, with a vague gesture.</p>

  <p>"No, you're not. I've got it in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Your price."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have," said Silver coldly.</p>

  <p>"First, I've got you because you love a fight," said Wycombe. "I'm talking
  right out at you, you see? You love a fight for the fight's sake. A lot of
  people say that you're never in trouble till fools put you in it. But nobody
  ever killed your list without liking the feel of that last part of a second
  before the guns are going to be pulled. Answer me straight in the eyes. Do
  you like it? I mean, when the other fellow's eyes turn red, and he begins to
  show his teeth at you, and bunch his shoulders over, and his hands start
  working. Do you like that?"</p>

  <p>Silver sighed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Go on with it," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to hook you with the names of the hombres that are coming
  to lift my hair. Because, when you hear those names, your mouth is going to
  water. It's the sort of meat you like. It's high! The two of 'em are crooks
  from away back. They've both done their killings and plenty of 'em. They're
  stake runners. They start from scratch when it comes to guns, and one of 'em
  is Morris Delgas. You know Delgas?"</p>

  <p>"I know him," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"He killed Rex Walters and Lefty Markham; those are about the best two he
  killed. But there's others."</p>

  <p>"I know what Morrie Delgas has done," answered Silver.</p>

  <p>"A nice fly for a trout to rise at, eh? But the other's a shade better,
  even. The other's that devil of a Harry Rutherford! I don't need to ask if
  you know that little drink of poison! It wouldn't be healthy for you not to
  know! A little left-handed streak of misery, is what he is. Some people say
  he's the slickest hand with a gun that ever fanned a Colt. That's what a lot
  of people say. I don't know. I'd back you against him. That's all I know. And
  the money I put down goes into your pocket. Listen to me, Silver. When I say
  money, I mean it. Big money."</p>

  <p>Silver shook his head and stood up slowly.</p>

  <p>"Hey!" cried Wycombe. "Don't act that way. Wait a minute. Listen."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to listen," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Wait! I'm talking something like this&mdash;five thousand apiece. I know
  you, Jim. You're not small time. For each one of those hombres, five thousand
  bucks paid on the spot."</p>

  <p>"I don't want it," said Silver.</p>

  <p>A moment of silence struck between them. Silver heard the ticking of a
  clock that was not in the room. He heard the buzzing of a big bluebottle that
  circled around and around the room. He smelled the aromatic sharpness of hot
  varnish, and knew that his body was covered with sweat, also. Wycombe was
  staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Have I banked on a lame horse? Have you lost your nerve?" whispered
  Wycombe.</p>

  <p>Then his voice came out with a bang. "I said five thousand. I mean it.
  I'll give you five thousand on account, Jim! Those hombres mean to murder me,
  I tell you. I'll pay you five thousand advance just to be the bodyguard!"</p>

  <p>"I don't want the money," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"You mean," shouted Wycombe, "that you don't want any part of my game. You
  don't want me!"</p>

  <p>Silver was silent. He knew that anything could happen now, and he was
  ready for it, looking fixedly into the eyes of Wycombe and watching the
  trembling of the upper lip that hung crookedly over the buckteeth.</p>

  <p>"I've missed!" whispered Wycombe. He cried out suddenly: "Listen to me. I
  can't slip up. Listen to me, Jim. I've got ten thousand dollars right here in
  this room. It's yours!"</p>

  <p>Silver shook his head. A whole storm of rage and darkness poured over the
  eyes of Wycombe. His body trembled. His mouth kept working vainly around the
  prominence of those big front teeth.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said at last, and, turning on his heel, he walked out of
  the room.</p>

  <p>Silver followed him, looking left and right as he stepped cautiously
  through each doorway. As he went toward the back of the house, he heard the
  voice of Wycombe ring out ahead of him:</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean by coming up here and hanging around the
  kitchen? Get out on the range, where you belong. Foreman? You're no foreman.
  You're no good. I've got a mind to fire you on the spot. I'm sick of the
  pretty face of you."</p>

  <p>Silver, stepping into the kitchen, saw Wycombe in the middle of the floor,
  shaking his fist at a tall, brown-faced youth who stood with his sombrero in
  the tips of his fingers, his back to the door. On the floor he had just laid
  the quarters of a deer. Anger had marked the cheeks of this fellow with
  white, and pure rage was about to burst out of his lips when the girl
  intervened. She was behind the back of Wycombe, so that only Silver saw her
  frightened gesture of entreaty. Both hands remained for an instant pressed
  against her throat while her eyes talked to the foreman.</p>

  <p>He took a great breath.</p>

  <p>"I thought you folks might want some fresh venison, was all," said he.</p>

  <p>He began to turn toward the door. It was very hard for him, Silver could
  see that, to swallow the string of insults that had just been poured at him.
  In a sense, Silver felt guilty, because it was plain that Wycombe felt
  himself enough of a gun fighter to handle this honest cow-puncher, and the
  wrath which he had accumulated during his interview with Silver was to be
  poured out now.</p>

  <p>It was the girl who had stopped the retort that might have meant gunfire.
  And, if she had stopped it, most assuredly it had not been because her great
  concern was for Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to teach you," shouted Wycombe, beside himself with rage as he
  saw the other giving way, "I'm going to teach you that your place is out
  where&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Wycombe," said Silver.</p>

  <p>Wycombe spun about with his shoulders suddenly against the wall, the very
  attitude of a man who fears that he may be attacked from two sides at
  once.</p>

  <p>"Hey&mdash;well, what you want?" he barked.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking things over," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He felt the eyes of the girl suddenly on his face; he felt the wonder in
  them.</p>

  <p>Wycombe was instantly changed. He seemed to forget his foreman in a
  flash.</p>

  <p>"You mean that, Jim?" he cried. "You're going to stand by me and take a
  chance to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll stand by you, I suppose," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Come on back in that room," urged Wycombe. "I'm going to pay you now
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly toward the young foreman, who was closing the door. The
  latter paused, opened the door again.</p>

  <p>"Wycombe's temper is not worth much," said Silver, "and sometimes he talks
  a lot."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand with a smile.</p>

  <p>"My name is Jim Silver," he said.</p>

  <p>The white face of the foreman turned crimson. He knew, it was clear, that
  this gesture on the part of Silver was purely in token that the stranger had
  overheard but had not lost respect for the foreman because he had taken water
  in the row. Never was a stronger grasp laid on the hand of Silver.</p>

  <p>"I'm Dan Farrel," said he. "And&mdash;thanks. It's great to meet you,
  Silver. It's great!"</p>

  <p>He went out, closing the door hastily behind him, as though he wished to
  conceal something that was coming into his face.</p>

  <p>Silver, turning, saw Wycombe beckoning impatiently at the other door of
  the kitchen. He saw, also, one flash of gratitude and astonishment in the
  eyes of the girl. Then he went on through the door with Wycombe and back into
  the study.</p>

  <p>"You gave me a turn, Silver." Steve Wycombe laughed. "You can throw a
  bluff with anybody I ever saw. I thought for a minute that you meant what you
  said. Wait a minute. Ten thousand, I said, and ten thousand it's going to
  be."</p>

  <p>He started to unlock the door of a big square-faced safe that filled a
  corner of the room.</p>

  <p>"No," said Silver. "I don't want the cash."</p>

  <p>"You don't want what?" shouted Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"I don't take blood money," said Silver.</p>

  <p>Wycombe straightened his body with jerks and finally faced his guest with
  a frown.</p>

  <p>"I never was able to figure you out," he said. "You beat me&mdash;but
  that's all right. As long as you're with me, anything's all right!
  Only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, and then shrugged his lean shoulders twice.</p>

  <p>"About that fellow Farrel," he said. "Why did you make that funny play
  about him? Going up and shaking hands with the bum when he'd just backed down
  and taken water like a cur?"</p>

  <p>"He's not a cur. He's a man," said Silver. "And I'd rather murder a man
  than shame him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; SILVER LISTENS</h2>

  <p class="first">They sat for a time in the office. Wycombe drank more of the
  old rye whisky. Silver smoked cigarettes and did the listening, as a
  rule.</p>

  <p>He had merely said: "Let's find out why the pair are after you. It's quite
  a time since you were in the games where you rubbed elbows with the pair of
  'em. Two or three years, I should say."</p>

  <p>"All that matters," said Wycombe, "is that they're after me, and that you
  know what they look like."</p>

  <p>"No," said Silver. "I need to know more."</p>

  <p>Wycombe curled his upper lip to speak, and once more the lip stayed curled
  on the projecting teeth while Wycombe changed his mind about the words he was
  to have spoken.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at last, "you won't be a hired man. You're going to have
  your full share in the show."</p>

  <p>He struck out his jaw after the way he had, and tossed back the blond
  hair.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I got sore in front of the girl," he said suddenly. "You think
  she noticed?"</p>

  <p>"She noticed," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"What did she look like?" asked Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"Frightened," said Silver.</p>

  <p>Wycombe lolled back in his chair, suddenly at ease.</p>

  <p>"It don't do any harm to throw a scare into a jane," he declared. "Let 'em
  know that there's a real man around, and they like it all the better. You
  know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," said Silver, probing the dark and mean soul of the
  man with a steady eye.</p>

  <p>But Wycombe failed to understand the glance. He went on: "You know how it
  is. A girl likes to see a man that's up to something. She doesn't want to
  have a yellow pup around. She's always liked that foreman of mine pretty
  well. She'll hate his heart from now on. Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"They know my record, around here," went on Wycombe. "They know that I'm
  no soft-handed baby. Eh?"</p>

  <p>"They ought to know that."</p>

  <p>"But, going back a little&mdash;I'm kind of beat by you, Silver. You throw
  ten thousand dollars out the window?"</p>

  <p>Silver shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I want to be my own man," said he. "I want to do as I please. And I don't
  want blood money. I never took any, and I don't want it."</p>

  <p>"But you'll hire out&mdash;you'll stay here, I mean&mdash;and keep an eye
  out for me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll stay here&mdash;for a while. If Morrie Delgas and Harry Rutherford
  show up, I'll try my hand fighting for you. I'll work for you as though you'd
  paid me the money, Wycombe&mdash;unless you start kicking things around."</p>

  <p>"Kicking you around?" said Wycombe, laughing. "I'm not a half-wit, old
  son."</p>

  <p>"Let's hear the story of why the pair are on your trail."</p>

  <p>"Why pick on that? Why does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Silver, "the cause that puts a man on a trail is the
  grindstone that sharpens the edge of him. I want to know what sort of a
  temper and edge these fellows are wearing."</p>

  <p>Wycombe considered gloomily. He made himself a cigarette and then
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"You know Gold Gulch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Know Fourth Street?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Know the pawnshop on the corner?"</p>

  <p>"Pudge Wayland used to run it."</p>

  <p>"That's right. Know anything more about Pudge?"</p>

  <p>"He was a crook and a fence."</p>

  <p>"He was a crook and a fence, all right," said Wycombe. "Know what happened
  to him?"</p>

  <p>"He was shot."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" asked Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"I never heard."</p>

  <p>"Nobody else did, except a few. I'm the fellow that killed him."</p>

  <p>Silver actually sighed with relief.</p>

  <p>"Is that what's behind this trail that Morrie Delgas and Rutherford are
  on?"</p>

  <p>"That's it!" said Steve Wycombe, brightening. "I ought to have a medal and
  a vote of thanks for getting that fat Gila monster out of the world, instead
  of inheriting trouble about it, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It seems that way. How did the thing happen?"</p>

  <p>"I'd had words with him. It was a couple of years back. I'd had words with
  him. About nothing much. Just about a loan he'd made me on a gold watch. I
  was sore. The next time I saw him, I was coming out of the mouth of an alley.
  It was night. I saw the fat back of Pudge Wayland come across the street. I
  sang out and swore at him. He whirled around. I was drunk. I was on a mean
  drunk. You know, the kind when you don't know what you're doing. I thought I
  saw a gun in his hand. I shot him dead. That's all."</p>

  <p>He stuck out his lower jaw and stared at the floor.</p>

  <p>"That's all&mdash;except that he wasn't even wearing a gun?" suggested
  Silver.</p>

  <p>"The fool," said Steve Wycombe, "should 'a' had one on, anyway. There was
  a witness, y'understand? A sap of a no-good sneak thief. He saw everything.
  He spotted me. I had to give him a regular pension to keep his mouth shut.
  And he went off into Mexico, where he'd be safe in case I decided to pay him
  the rest of his pension with a chunk of lead. He stayed down there and
  collected my checks. Just like that. And then the blockhead goes and gets
  into a row, a while ago, and gets himself knifed up, and the doctors say that
  he's going to die, and he lies there on the floor of a saloon and tells what
  he knows to the fellow that knifed him. Makes a confession, d'you see? And
  the fellow that knifed him is Harry Rutherford, and with Harry is that Morrie
  Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is how the thing all hitches together. That Pudge Wayland was
  a fence, and you know it. And he'd done a lot of work for Delgas and for
  Rutherford, both of 'em, because they were working hand in glove. And when
  Wayland died, he had a whole slew of stolen goods on his hands, and a big
  pile of it belonged to those two thugs.</p>

  <p>"You see what had happened? I bump off Pudge Wayland. His heirs get
  everything in his shop&mdash;and it's a ton! They clean out his safe. They
  get themselves rich, and gyp Morrie and Harry out of a whole little fortune
  in honest stolen goods they'd given to Pudge. That must have been the way of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, my man lies there on the floor of the cantina and talks his fool
  head off, and he sees that pair shake hands over him and swear that they'll
  go and bump off Wycombe, just to even the account. They'd always hated me,
  anyway, since a little poker game we once played together. And then the fool
  fellow, he doesn't die, after all; but he gets better, and he's honest enough
  to write me a letter and tell me how he happened to put those two bloodhounds
  on my trail. But you see the funny part?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what part would be funny to you," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Why," said Wycombe, "ain't it a scream that'd curdle your blood to think
  of me bumping off a fat fool like Pudge Wayland and then getting a pair of
  wildcats like those two dropped right down my back?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; SILVER GIVES WARNING</h2>

  <p class="first">The evening came on, and Jim Silver was glad of a chance to
  get out of the tobacco reek and whisky smell of the closed house into the
  open. Besides, there was something unusual&mdash;rain promised over the
  desert, and thunder bumping and rumbling in the sky just like carts going
  over iron bridges.</p>

  <p>Steve Wycombe went off by himself for a few moments, and Silver was
  gladdest of all to be alone. He wanted to do some thinking. He had come to
  the hardest moment of all, which is when a man tries to untangle his own
  actions and discover the motives of them. He kept telling himself that he was
  a fool to have bound himself to fight for this fellow Wycombe and, above all,
  to have bound himself against such formidable men as Morris Delgas and that
  ravenous ghost of a man, Harry Rutherford.</p>

  <p>Certainly it was not compassion for Wycombe that kept him on the place. He
  could hardly put his finger on the cause until he saw young Dan Farrel walk
  from the first corral toward the bunk house. Then he could remember and be
  sure that it was something about Farrel and the girl that had turned the
  scales and induced him to stay. Why?</p>

  <p>Well, he could not say exactly. He was simply a prospector in the land of
  trouble, and there seemed to be a rich strike of danger and complications
  straight ahead of him.</p>

  <p>A pair of cow-punchers came away from the horse shed and ran sneaking up
  on their foreman. They were almost on him when he sidestepped. There was a
  swift flurry of action, an uproar of laughing voices, and the foreman went
  on, leaving his two men to pick themselves up from the ground. Jim Silver was
  pleased enough to smile. He waved Farrel over to him.</p>

  <p>"What do you say about rain, Farrel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Farrel shook his head. "It's the wrong season," he declared. "You don't
  know how rain comes here&mdash;just a few drops at a time&mdash;just enough
  to keep the lips wet and the patient from dying. Just enough water to keep
  the grass from dying clear down to the bottom of its roots. This is a dry
  ranch, Silver!"</p>

  <p>He nodded and smiled as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"You like it." said Jim Silver. "There's something about it you like, or
  that you expect to like later on."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because you'll put up with a good deal in order to stay on it. Why,
  Farrel? There are plenty of jobs everywhere for good cowmen."</p>

  <p>Farrel stared at him. Then turning toward the foothills, he waved his hand
  west and north and east.</p>

  <p>"You see how those mountains are heaped up in three bunches? Over there to
  the east are the Rendais&mdash;that's old Mount Kendal back there in blue and
  white, just on the right. Over here, straight north, that second bunch make
  up the Humphreys Mountains. I don't have to tell you which is Mount Humphreys
  itself. Look at the way it goes jump into the sky! Now, yonder on the left,
  right over there bang against the west, you see the biggest of the three
  bunches? Those are the Farrel Mountains."</p>

  <p>Silver looked not so much at the silhouette of ragged blackness in the
  west, not so much at the three vast masses of cumulus clouds which were
  blossoming over the three groups of mountains, as he did into the lean, brown
  face of Dan Farrel. For it seemed to Silver that some of the fire and
  grandeur of the sunset mountains was reflected in the face of the
  cow-puncher.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Silver. "They were named after one of your tribe?"</p>

  <p>"Great-grandfather. Ever since his day there's always been a Farrel on
  this ground."</p>

  <p>He hooked his thumb over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It isn't the house that matters. I don't give a hang about that. It's the
  ground that counts. I've gone away and worked on other places&mdash;places on
  the ledge of the desert, like this, with mountains close by that were a lot
  bigger and finer than those three outfits&mdash;but I never found a place
  that fitted into my head the way this one does. Every time I lay an eye on
  those mountains, it's as though I'd daubed a rope on a maverick and added it
  to my herd. I tell you what, Silver&mdash;it may seem a funny thing to you,
  but it's true&mdash;it seems to me that I know every wave of the ground off
  there to the south from the ranch house. I know just where the waves of the
  land are running, every one of 'em."</p>

  <p>"How did the Farrels lose the place?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"My old man gambled it away to Wycombe's old man, that's the whole
  story."</p>

  <p>"You hate to leave it?"</p>

  <p>"The way you'd hate to stop breathing."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Silver, "it looks as though you'd have to go."</p>

  <p>"Does it?"</p>

  <p>"On account of the girl."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I've been talking to Wycombe, and he wants her. If he thinks you're in
  his way, with her, he'll cut your throat. He'll fire you off the ranch, at
  least."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that there's anything between the girl and me?"
  asked Dan Farrel.</p>

  <p>"I saw her turning white and pink, to-day in the kitchen. Farrel, you'll
  have to move."</p>

  <p>Farrel took off his hat, mopped his forehead, and then stood with the hat
  crushed in his two hands. Slowly his glance went across the mountains from
  the east to the west, until he was facing the last fire of the sunset. He
  said nothing but, after a moment, he walked away and left Silvertip in
  profoundly gloomy thought. Tragedy was not ten steps away from the Wycombe
  ranch, he felt, and it was probably even nearer than those expert gunmen,
  Morrie Delgas and Harry Rutherford; in fact, it probably was stepping in the
  boots of Dan Farrel.</p>

  <p>Nothing like this had ever come into the ken of Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>Through the open kitchen window, he saw the girl moving back and forth
  rapidly, with the haste of a cook who is making the last preparations for the
  service of a meal. He went to the window and leaned an elbow on the sill. The
  girl was pouring the water off a pot of boiled potatoes; a cloud of steam
  rushed up from the sink about her shoulders and head. Then she spilled the
  potatoes into a great dish.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," said Silver, without an introductory word, "that a fellow had a
  good pair of hands, plenty of work anywhere he wanted to find it, and a girl
  willing to travel anywhere in the world with him; couldn't he be happy off
  the home ground?"</p>

  <p>She had turned half toward him, though without looking into his face. It
  was as if his words had arrested her whole mind so that a greater and a
  greater tension was put on her. He saw it in the stiffening of her body, in
  the way her head lifted. Afterward, she came to the window to confront him
  closely.</p>

  <p>"How much has Danny told you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not as much as I told him," answered Jim Silver. "Do you know how close
  you are to trouble?"</p>

  <p>"From Steve Wycombe?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He's going to ask you to marry him. How long can you put him off? He's
  used to having his own way."</p>

  <p>She took a deep, quick breath. The shake of her head was a shudder through
  her entire body.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered. "I can't get Danny to leave the place."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to," responded Silver. "You'll have to persuade him fast,
  too. Wycombe wants you. He wants you as much as he can want anything. If you
  put him off, he'll be suspicious. If he grows suspicious, he can't help
  finding out that there's something between you and Farrel. And if he guesses
  that&mdash;" He paused.</p>

  <p>"I know," said the girl. "He'd murder Dan in a moment, I suppose. I'm
  going to leave! I'll leave tonight. I'll leave now!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better," said Silver. He pitied her, suddenly, more than he had
  ever pitied any other human being. The trouble which faced her seemed so
  totally unfair. "There's only one other thing to do&mdash;and that's to
  persuade Danny to live in another place."</p>

  <p>"It's no good. He has desert fever, and the only desert he can live in is
  this one. He's tried to go away before this. But he came back looking like a
  ghost. It's the sort of homesickness that doesn't fade out."</p>

  <p>"Have you got a horse of your own?" Silver asked her.</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"Have you money?"</p>

  <p>"No. Only a little."</p>

  <p>"I can help you out with some cash."</p>

  <p>"If I have to step out of his life&mdash;out of Danny's
  life&mdash;forever&mdash;" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Then she straightened herself and smiled wanly at Silver.</p>

  <p>"I can't even say good-by to him, I suppose," she said.</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He reached for his wallet and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Take this," said he, and offered a sheaf of bills. But she only shook her
  head.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it," she told him. "I can manage with what I have."</p>

  <p>Silver put the money back into the wallet, stared at her, and then walked
  away into the dusk. His thoughts were so baffled, so gloomy, that he kicked
  aimlessly at the ground over which he walked. He had been in tangles before,
  but none so thoroughly complicated as this one. The chief anger he felt was
  directed toward Farrel. The fellow looked as hard as nails, but his weakness
  was what is the strength of other men&mdash;an overmastering love for one
  place.</p>

  <p>Into the darkening north Silver looked, toward the mountains. They were
  new enough to him, and yet already they began to stand in his mind like old,
  familiar faces. He remembered how Farrel had pointed to them; he remembered
  the reverence and affection with which the voice of Farrel had uttered the
  names. After all, a man cannot be blamed for passions which are bigger than
  himself.</p>

  <p>He went to the pump and sloshed a tin pan full of cold water. There was
  soap, yellow and strong, to wash with, and a big, coarse scrubbing brush. He
  worked on his finger tips until he had got the leather grease out from under
  the nails. The rest of his washing took very little time. He managed to find
  a clean spot on one of the big roller towels and dried himself.</p>

  <p>The cow-punchers were all around him, sputtering in the water, swearing as
  the soap got into recent cuts. One of them was red-headed, the clown of the
  lot. He squared off in front of Silver, swaying thick shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He ain't so big," said "Red."</p>

  <p>"I'll take you on for a couple of rounds, big boy."</p>

  <p>He began to dance on the tips of his toes, easing his hands back and forth
  in readiness to strike or to parry. Silver finished drying his own hands and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" said Red, as the others began to crow and whoop. "Come on!"
  said Red. "Nobody gets by on reputation in this man's ranch. Let's see what
  you've got, Jim Silver!"</p>

  <p>He was dancing, still swaying himself from side to side a little, when
  Silver made a flashing gesture with both arms and caught the two hands of
  Red. He kept on smiling as he crushed those hands until he could feel the
  supple bones springing and giving.</p>

  <p>"In my part of the world, we shake before we fight," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He released the hands and stepped back. Red began to open and close his
  fingers, laughing.</p>

  <p>"In my part of the world, when a gent shakes hands like that, we don't
  fight him," said Red.</p>

  <p>The other punchers were laughing, too. The supper gong rang. Silver went
  in with the rest, and by the brightness of their eyes he knew that he would
  have no more signs of trouble from them. They had accepted him as something
  more than a large bubble of reputation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>V. GUNS IN THE DARK</h2>

  <p class="first">As the punchers entered, their employer was revealed walking
  up and down at the head of the dining room. He had dressed for dinner by
  buttoning his vest, sleeking the blond forelock with water, and slipping a
  pair of brilliant elastic garters over his sleeves to leave his wrists supple
  and free. As the spurs jingled and the heels thundered on the wooden floor,
  Mr. Wycombe made a movement of his hand that stopped every one. Then he
  said:</p>

  <p>"You waddies have gotta know that there are two thugs steering for this
  ranch, right now, and aiming to collect my scalp when they arrive. If they
  look in through the window and start blazing away while we're having supper,
  they might smash up a lot of crockery. So one of you stand guard outside.
  Red, you take a turn. Ten or fifteen minutes and you can come back inside and
  somebody else will take the beat. The hombres I talk about are Morrie Delgas
  and that skinny little streak of murder, Harry Rutherford. If they start
  raising the devil, maybe my friend, Jim Silver, will help my song and dance.
  That's all, boys. Set down and feed your faces."</p>

  <p>Red took a handful of biscuits, wedged some butter into them, and left the
  room to stand guard. The other punchers sat down. The chairs rumbled like
  thunder. Dishes and cutlery began to clatter. Some one asked Wycombe what
  Delgas and Rutherford had against him.</p>

  <p>"Just old chums gone wrong," said Wycombe.</p>

  <p>There were heaps of food&mdash;venison steaks, two great bowls of baked
  beans with a rich scum browned over the tops of them, heaps of biscuits with
  snowy flanks and crusty tops, mountains of potatoes, huge dishes of gravy.
  Forks and spoons dug into these treasures. Presently heads were seriously
  bent; the girl came in and filled the ponderous drinking cups from a pail of
  coffee. She wore a faint, fixed smile. She reminded Silver of a prize fighter
  sick with punishment but smiling to show that everything is all right.</p>

  <p>When she came by Wycombe, he lifted his head and smiled like a calf at
  her. Then he resumed his former position, his brow reclining in the palm of
  his left hand while with the right he casually and in the most disinterested
  fashion scooped food toward his face. A profound loathing began to work at
  the very roots of the soul of Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>The better the food, the swifter the eating on a Western ranch. Those
  punchers walked through the provisions on the table and then rolled
  cigarettes and sipped a second beaker of coffee. They said things to Esther
  as she went the round, pouring it out. "Regular good stuff," said one, and
  another: "Where you cook, this cowboy camps." Some of them said: "How's
  things?" Every one muttered something; up to that time no one had seemed
  aware of her existence, except Wycombe.</p>

  <p>The second round of coffee was finished. Whirls, clouds, long streaks of
  cigarette smoke hung in the air as the punchers rose, one after another, and
  went out. Their footfalls boomed through the room, then grew dim and muffled
  in the dust outside. The smoke seemed to be collecting around the two lamps
  that stood on the table. There remained at the table only the foreman,
  Silver, and Wycombe, as the girl came in to clear the dishes away. When she
  went past Wycombe, he put out his arm and gathered her suddenly into the
  hollow of it.</p>

  <p>"How's things?" asked Wycombe, smiling up at her.</p>

  <p>She only smiled down at him vaguely. Danny Farrel grew rigid in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I've got to finish my work," said Esther Maxwell. "Please, Steve."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're going to stop working, pretty soon," said Wycombe. "Maybe
  there's going to be a Chinaman or something for you to boss.
  Maybe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Esther!" barked Farrel.</p>

  <p>Wycombe released her suddenly. She stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Eight o'clock and all's well," drawled the puncher who walked on guard
  outside the windows.</p>

  <p>Farrel and Wycombe were staring at one another, Farrel still rigid, and
  Wycombe leaning loosely forward. In the middle of a smile, his upper lip had
  caught again over his projecting teeth and stayed there in a snarl. The girl
  hurried out of the room with a pile of empty dishes. Silver folded his arms,
  because in that position his hands were close to his guns. It seemed strange
  to him that the girl should have left the room, unaware that there was murder
  in the air. He himself could hear the bumping of blood against his temples as
  his heart beat faster and stronger.</p>

  <p>"You've got the say with her, have you?" said Wycombe.</p>

  <p>Farrel was as straight as a stick and pale as a stone; he had his two
  hands on the edge of the table. The hands of Wycombe were out of sight.</p>

  <p>"I hate to see a girl mauled around," said Farrel.</p>

  <p>"You hate to see it, do you?" answered Wycombe.</p>

  <p>He worked his lips until they closed; he moistened them with the swift red
  tip of his tongue.</p>

  <p>Farrel pushed back his chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll be going on," he murmured slowly.</p>

  <p>He stood up.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," commanded Wycombe. "I'm going to find out something."</p>

  <p>Farrel halted, halfway to the door.</p>

  <p>Wycombe had pushed back his chair and sat forward on the edge of it with
  his hands still out of sight.</p>

  <p>"I wanta know," said Steve Wycombe, "what that girl is to you,
  Farrel."</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Nothing!" said Farrel.</p>

  <p>"I'm not to never mind, eh?" said Wycombe. He laughed suddenly, turning
  all white around the mouth and with a devil in his eyes. "Why, Farrel, who
  are you?"</p>

  <p>Farrel said nothing.</p>

  <p>Wycombe gasped: "You're going to tell me what to do and how to act in my
  own house, are you? You're going to tell me how to treat a girl, are you? You
  dirty rat, what's the girl to you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to marry her, that's all," said Farrel.</p>

  <p>The door opened. The girl came back, not in time to hear anything, but in
  time to see the attitudes of the two men. She cried out in fear.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me&mdash;you, Esther," said Wycombe. "Have you been fooling me?
  Have you been making a fool of me? This bum of a secondhand foreman says that
  he's going to marry you. Is that straight?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Danny!" mourned the girl.</p>

  <p>The way she put out her hands toward Farrel told Steve Wycombe enough.</p>

  <p>"You sneaking thief!" he yelled, and came out of his chair with a gun in
  each hand. "I'm going to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Back up!" called Silver, and shot the left-hand gun out of the grasp of
  Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"You? You, too?" screamed Wycombe." I'll get you both.
  I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He dived under the table and heaved up the side of it with a lift of his
  shoulders. The whole mass of crockery went to the floor. The lamps were
  dashed out. Darkness blotted the room, and the scream of the girl made a red
  zigzag like lightning across the brain of Silver.</p>

  <p>It was not complete darkness. The flame of one lamp had ignited the oil
  that spread out from it in a thin layer on the floor. A blue welter of fire
  began to play, keeping the room awash with uncertain ebbing and flowing of
  shadows. Outside, the guard was shouting; the girl had not stopped
  screaming.</p>

  <p>Silver, flat on his stomach in a corner of the room, extended two guns
  before him and waited. A gun spat fire twice from close to the opposite wall.
  The voice of Farrel, near the windows, cursed briefly.</p>

  <p>"I've got one of you!" screamed Wycombe.</p>

  <p>There was the loose impact of a falling body against the floor. The guard
  was shouting, near the door:</p>

  <p>"What the devil's up? What's happening?"</p>

  <p>He was afraid to come in, of course.</p>

  <p>The gun of Wycombe flashed again, and Silver shot at the glint of the face
  that he saw behind the little red tongue of fire. He almost felt the impact
  of his bullet tearing through flesh and bone.</p>

  <p>A voice said, "Ah!"</p>

  <p>That was Wycombe. There was no vocal strength to the sound; he simply
  breathed the word out. "Light!" said Wycombe. And now his voice had a great
  weakness of shuddering in it. "Light! I'm dying! I'm sick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The screaming of the girl was ended. That was one good thing. Farrel said
  nothing. Perhaps he was dead.</p>

  <p>Silver went across the room to where Wycombe lay. The burning oil gave
  only the dimmest sort of a light, but it was enough for him to see that
  Farrel had been kneeling against the wall between the two windows; the body
  of the girl lay flat near the kitchen door; and Wycombe had slipped down with
  his head pressing at a breaking angle against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Get a lantern, Farrel," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Esther's dead!" shouted Farrel. "Help! He's murdered her."</p>

  <p>Other voices, many footfalls were heard outside the door. Someone carried
  a lantern, its light swinging wildly across the windows and intercrossing
  swift shuttles of brightness over the ceiling.</p>

  <p>The lantern was brought into the room, and showed Farrel holding the limp
  body of the girl in his arms. Her head hung down; her arms and legs trailed
  toward the floor. The wave of cow-punchers advanced in a solid mass.</p>

  <p>"Wycombe, did you shoot at the girl?" murmured Silver.</p>

  <p>"No!" said Wycombe. "I wish I had. I'm dying. You got me, you sneak, you
  traitor! I wish I'd killed you all!"</p>

  <p>The lantern light came close and flooded over him. His whole breast was
  flowing with blood, it seemed. The blood ran down to the floor and gathered
  in two pools. The body of Wycombe was still. His arms lay limply at his
  sides, with the hands turned palm up. But his face was working violently, the
  lips covering and uncovering the gleam of the teeth.</p>

  <p>"Take Silver!" he said. "Red, Joe, Lefty, Mack, take Silver. He murdered
  me. He killed me right here. The skunk&mdash;he killed me! Shoot him to
  pieces!"</p>

  <p>They looked at one another; they looked at Silver; they looked vaguely
  back at their employer.</p>

  <p>One of the lot helped Farrel with the girl. She had only fainted, it
  appeared, and now she began to moan. They carried her out of the
  shambles.</p>

  <p>Silver said: "Wycombe found out that Farrel is going to marry Esther. He
  went crazy and pulled his guns on Farrel. I knocked one gun out of his grip.
  He threw the table over and tried to shoot up the lot of us. That was why I
  plugged him. A dirty business, but it had to be done."</p>

  <p>He kneeled beside Wycombe in an effort to feel his pulse.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch me. Keep your murdering hands away from me," said Wycombe, in
  a horrible, bubbling voice. "Boys, don't believe him. He's lying. Tear him
  apart. Let me see you split him open. I've got a thousand dollars for the man
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Steve," said a voice from the doorway. "He only stole a march on
  us."</p>

  <p>Silver saw two men at the entrance of the room, one a great, hairy brute,
  and the other small and dapper, with a pale face. He knew that Delgas and
  Rutherford had arrived too late.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; WYCOMBE'S WILL</h2>

  <p class="first">Some of the men threw sand on the burning oil and put it
  out. At the directions of Silver, two more dragged in a mattress, with the
  blankets folded to lift his head and shoulders, for when he lay flat his own
  blood choked him.</p>

  <p>Silver cut away the clothes, tried to stop the bleeding in chest and back
  with handfuls of dust, and bound a thick bandage made of a torn sheet around
  and around the scrawny body. Hollow-chested, lean of shoulders and arms,
  Wycombe looked no more than a boy. It had only been his spirit that made him
  dangerous, and the same spirit was still green in his eyes. He kept rolling
  his glance from Delgas to Silver to Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Give me a shot of hooch," he said. "I've got some thinking to do."</p>

  <p>Silver tilted his head and applied a bottle of whisky to the lips. Wycombe
  drank it like water. Afterward he closed his eyes for a long moment, but he
  was not dead. Silver could see the pulse beat in the scrawny hollow of the
  throat.</p>

  <p>"I wanta have a pen and paper," said Wycombe. "Silver, you write down what
  I say. I'm going to make my will."</p>

  <p>One of the men ran off to get what was needed.</p>

  <p>Rutherford sat down on the floor beside Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to see you this way, Steve," said he. "I hoped that you'd be up
  and about when we arrived. You're not much use to us this way, Steve. We've
  been killing you every day for a long time. Now that you're passing out on
  your own hook, there doesn't seem to be anything left for us to do. The
  world's a hollow place for us, with you out of it!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" murmured Wycombe. "He shot me in the dark. He sided with that rat
  of a Farrel of mine. And I'd hired Silver to keep the two of you away from
  me."</p>

  <p>"Had you?" said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>He turned his thin, handsome face toward Jim Silver and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Old Jim Silver," he said softly. "Always up to something."</p>

  <p>Delgas came and put his hands on his knees. The hair grew like fur down to
  the second knuckles.</p>

  <p>"How d'you feel, kid?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There's hands inside of me tearing me apart," said Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"Too bad," said Delgas, and began to grin widely, nodding at Wycombe. "We
  had lots of hell, but it's better than nothing to get a flash of you when
  you're like that."</p>

  <p>"You swine!" breathed Steve Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"Let him alone, Delgas," said Silver. "Get up and stand back from him,
  Rutherford. He's a dying man."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Rutherford. "You don't like my manners, Silver?"</p>

  <p>He rose slowly, still smiling.</p>

  <p>"I don't like your manners," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He looked at them calmly.</p>

  <p>"Now!" whispered Wycombe, his eyes burning. "Are you going to take water
  from him, the pair of you? Jump him&mdash;blow him to pieces, boys! I'll
  thank you, and I'll pay you for doing it! It'll make a red-letter day in your
  lives, the cash I'll give you!"</p>

  <p>"And be mobbed by this gang when we open up? We're not such fools," said
  Rutherford.</p>

  <p>He stepped back. Wycombe glowered at Silver.</p>

  <p>"I've got no luck," he said.</p>

  <p>"You'll be hearing from us, Silver," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Silver. "Come and take tea with me, one day. Any old time
  would suit me."</p>

  <p>The paper and ink and pen arrived. Silver sat down cross-legged and dipped
  the pen and poised it above the writing pad.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, Wycombe," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I want this to sound like law," said Wycombe. "Write like this. Put the
  date down and the place, first. Then say: 'I, Stephen Wycombe, being in my
  right mind and the full possession of my faculties, make this my last will
  and testament.' How does that sound to you, boys? Legal?"</p>

  <p>The cow-punchers formed an outer semicircle. Some of them were standing.
  Some were sitting on their heels, watching.</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a book," said one of them.</p>

  <p>"That's the way you gotta sound, or else the lawyers will take you all
  apart," said Wycombe. "Somebody wipe my mouth. I don't seem to have any
  hands."</p>

  <p>Red came close and wiped the bloody lips with a bandanna. He gave Wycombe
  another taste of the whisky.</p>

  <p>"It's hard," said Wycombe, "to think of losing out on all of that
  seventeen-year-old rye! Go on writing, Silver. 'Last will and testament. It
  takes the place of, and makes null, all other wills and testaments that I may
  have made.' You see, I haven't made any other wills; but you've got to talk
  like that in a will."</p>

  <p>He went on: "I give, devise, and bequeath to my dear friend, Morris
  Delgas, one third of all the bulls, steers, cows, and calves in my
  possession."</p>

  <p>"Hey," said Delgas. "What's this?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" whispered Wycombe. "I gotta keep enough breath to finish. Go on
  writing, Silver. 'One half of all my land, except as shall hereinafter be
  excepted.' How's that for fancy talk? I was educated all right. A lot of good
  my education has done me! Go on: 'And to my dear friend, Henry Rutherford, I
  give, devise, and bequeath one third of all the live stock in my possession,
  together with one half of my land, except as shall be hereinafter excepted.'
  Have you got that?"</p>

  <p>"I have it," said Silver, working with a rapid pen.</p>

  <p>"Well," murmured Harry Rutherford softly, "this is the richest thing that
  I ever heard of. Where does the poison come in, Wycombe?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. He's having his joke," said Delgas. "The catch is going to
  come now."</p>

  <p>"Go on writing," urged Wycombe. "And to my dear friend called variously
  Arizona Jim, Silvertip, Silver, Jim Silver, and other aliases&mdash;I mean
  the man who caught the famous wild horse, Parade&mdash;I give, devise, and
  bequeath all the cash in my possession, together with the debts which I owe
  and one third of all the live stock on my place. In addition I give, devise,
  and bequeath to Jim Silver, alias Arizona Jim, alias Silvertip, all the water
  rights to the big tank called Johnson's Lake, and I give him outright the
  house and the corrals and all the ground in every direction for one half mile
  from the ranch house.' There, boys, that looks like a pretty even split, to
  me. Silver don't get any land to speak of, but he gets cash and water. Give
  me that to sign, Jim, will you?"</p>

  <p>Silver held the pad before him. Wycombe, with a twitching mouth, scratched
  on his signature.</p>

  <p>"That look all right and legal, Silver?" asked Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"It looks right enough to me," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Sign it, then. Everybody in the room sign it. Silver, write down:
  'Witnessed this day by me,' and then the rest of you sign under that place.
  Understand?"</p>

  <p>The paper was accordingly passed around. Wycombe lay back, nodding a
  little as he heard the scratching of the pen. Once Silver found the eyes of
  the dying man fixed upon him with a deathless malice and hatred.</p>

  <p>"The gent that should have guarded me, he shoots me down!" said Wycombe.
  Then, suddenly, he asked: "Where's the girl and where's Farrel? Go call 'em
  in, will you? I wanta say good-by to them. I gotta remember my manners and
  say good-by to all of my old friends."</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes. His mouth opened. Silver could no longer see the beat
  of the pulse in the hollow of the throat. When he touched the face of
  Wycombe, he found the skin clammy with cold sweat.</p>

  <p>One of the punchers came back, bringing the girl and tall Dan Farrel. She
  held back. Farrel had an arm about her, supporting her forward. Her eyes were
  doubly large in the pallor of her face.</p>

  <p>So the two of them came before the dying man.</p>

  <p>"They're here," said Silver.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Wycombe fluttered and then opened. He frowned to bring his
  attention on the pair.</p>

  <p>"Farrel and Esther. Fine-looking pair, eh?" he muttered. "The two of
  you&mdash;I want to say something to you. You're the ones that knifed me.
  Except because of your pretty mug, Esther, I'd be all right now. I'd be
  drinking rye and taking it easy, instead of going where I'm bound. I&mdash;"
  He gasped.</p>

  <p>"Whisky!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>Silver poured a large dram down his throat. He coughed and strangled
  feebly over it. The bubbling of his voice became greater, as though some of
  the liquid were in his lungs.</p>

  <p>He said: "I never wasted time on girls before I saw you, Esther."</p>

  <p>"Steve," cried the girl, "I never wanted to lead you on. I never said a
  word to you. The only reason that I didn't tell you right away that I loved
  Danny was because I was afraid that he'd be fired, and he can't live away
  from this place."</p>

  <p>"Yeah? Can't he?" murmured Wycombe. "He'll damned well live away from it,
  now that these three hombres have the place. And this is what I wanta say to
  the pair of you: I hope you have nothing but rotten bad luck. I hope the pair
  of you get sickness and meanness. I hope you start in hating each other. If
  you have kids, I hope that they're halfwits and that they're sick every day
  of their lives. I hope you're broke and stay broke. I hope you have to beg,
  and folks kick you out of their way. If there's anything in the curse of a
  dying man, I put it on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His head dropped back. The girl, with her hands pressed before her eyes,
  shut out the grisly picture of the dying man.</p>

  <p>"Take me away, Danny!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I put&mdash;a curse," muttered Wycombe, "on&mdash;on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He bit at the air, writhed his legs together, and sat bolt upright.</p>

  <p>"I can't breathe!" he gasped. "Give me air&mdash;whisky. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Blood bubbles broke on his lips. He twisted suddenly, fell on his side,
  and lay still.</p>

  <p>Silver leaned close above him for an instant, then turned him on his back
  and closed the eyes. Wycombe was smiling in death as in life, with his upper
  lip caught crookedly across his projecting teeth. Silver, with a fold of the
  blanket, covered that repulsive face.</p>

  <p>He stood up and faced the silence of the group.</p>

  <p>"Friends," he said, "the law is going to put an eye on all of this. You
  fellows jot down everything that you can remember of exactly what's happened.
  You'll have to answer questions. One thing is straight&mdash;I killed
  Wycombe. I shot him to keep him from murdering Farrel&mdash;and myself.
  Farrel, were you hurt?"</p>

  <p>"A graze along the ribs," said Dan Farrel. "It's nothing."</p>

  <p>"Lemme tell you all something," boomed the great bass voice of Morris
  Delgas. "I dunno just how it's going to work out, but this here Wycombe was
  always a poison rat. It looks like he's done something for us, but before we
  get through we'll find out that he's put a knife through us, every one. I'm
  going to go out and get some fresh air."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE NEW MANAGER</h2>

  <p class="first">A coroner came out from Pepper Gulch the next morning and
  made an examination. He was an old-timer with a dull-blue eye and
  tobacco-stained blond mustache. His examination lasted not more than half an
  hour, after which he pronounced over a glass of rye whisky, aged seventeen
  years:</p>

  <p>"The way it looks to me, it would be pretty hard to kill a gent like Steve
  Wycombe without doin' it in self-defense. I dunno that you could pick up any
  jury around this part of the world that would accuse a man of nothin' more
  than self-defense even if there was eye-witnesses that seen somebody bash
  Steve over the head when his back was turned."</p>

  <p>The reputation of Wycombe was in this manner its own reward. The body was
  carted to the town to be buried in the plot where other and hardly more
  honorable ancestors had lain before him, and the will which he had signed was
  promptly recorded and filed.</p>

  <p>The result was that the three to whom the inheritance had so strangely
  come could enter upon the possession at once. It was not many days later that
  they held a conference in the very room that had formerly been the office of
  the dead man.</p>

  <p>Morris Delgas, because he was the oldest and the largest of the trio,
  presided. He sat not in a chair but on the desk, with his shirt open and his
  sleeves rolled up. The man was everywhere furred over with black hair. His
  forehead was wide and very low, with a knob at either corner of it to match
  the cheek bones beneath. He looked like a perfect specimen for the prize
  ring, now grown a little overweight.</p>

  <p>He wore new boots, graced with golden, spoon-handled spurs; but otherwise
  he showed no token of the sudden good fortune that had come to him, for his
  clothes were those which any cow-puncher might have donned as a working
  outfit. His shirt was blue flannel, in spite of the heat of the weather; his
  hat was a very battered old felt, and the only evidence of wealth lay in the
  golden spurs and in the great fat cigar into which he had sunk his teeth.</p>

  <p>He liked the feel of it so well that he could not relax the grip of his
  teeth for an instant. The oily stain ran across his mouth. The tongue with
  which he licked those lips became stained, also. But he never touched the
  cigar with his hand. He smoked it rarely in puffs, but let it burn slowly
  with the movements of his breath, and when he changed its position, it was
  done by manipulations of the teeth and the tongue. In fact, he was a
  formidable brute of a man. His body looked too gross for activity, but his
  eye was as bright as the eye of a wild cat.</p>

  <p>Sitting there on the desk, with his huge back turned to the windows, he
  literally cast a shadow over the other two men.</p>

  <p>"Gents," he said, "we gotta get together. We gotta find out what was in
  the crazy bean of Steve Wycombe when he passed us this ground, and then we
  gotta see how we can pull together. Because look at the lay of the land. Me
  and Harry have got half the acres. And, believe me, there's some acres! I
  been out and rode all around the place, and it's a long day's ride. And we
  each got a third of the live stock, along with you, Silver. But there's
  another way of lookin' at the thing. We got the land and our shares of the
  stock. But you got the most part of the water, if not all. Except for some
  shallow kind of pools that stand a while around in the spring rains, there
  ain't no water on the rest of the place. The cows have gotta come in to the
  big tank or else they've gotta come right in here to the home place. It's a
  funny business, and I guess that the brains must have run with the blood
  right out of poor old Steve! Now's the time for us to talk a spell and keep
  shut up afterward."</p>

  <p>"Wycombe wasn't crazy," said Harry Rutherford. "Not a bit."</p>

  <p>"What was he, then?" asked big Delgas.</p>

  <p>"He was out for blood, that's all," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Go on, handsome, and tell me what you mean," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Aw, you tell him, Silver," said Rutherford. "He can't see it. Poor old
  Delgas is so gentle and trusting that he doesn't know how to look around the
  corner and see the devil in what people do."</p>

  <p>Silver smiled, his faint, faint smile. "As Wycombe lay dying," he said,
  "there were three men in the world that he wanted to kill. Name 'em,
  Delgas."</p>

  <p>"You first, because you'd sunk a shot in him between wind and water," said
  Delgas presently. "And I suppose that me and Rutherford would come on the
  list, too."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Silver, "and to whom did he leave his land?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the same three. But how's he goin' to kill us by givin' us the
  land?"</p>

  <p>"Because he hoped that we'd not be friends. He hoped that you and
  Rutherford would hang together and that you'd be against me, and that we'd
  start a war and fight to a finish."</p>

  <p>"Hey!" exclaimed Delgas. "You mean that, Silver? You think that's the
  straight of it, Harry?"</p>

  <p>Harry Rutherford waved a slender hand.</p>

  <p>"Of course that's it," he said. "Don't be so dumb, Brother Morris. Wycombe
  set us up for a battle royal. What else could he have had in his mind? Think
  that he wanted to reward us for being after his scalp?"</p>

  <p>Delgas champed noisily on the butt of his cigar, the smoke squeezing out
  of the burning end of it in little rapid puffs.</p>

  <p>"I begin to see," said he. "We can starve out Silver because we've got the
  land, and he can starve out us because he's got the water. The minute one
  shuts down on the other, there's bound to be trouble. It's a fight to the
  finish, and a mighty quick fight."</p>

  <p>"There's only one way out," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Name it," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Not to fight," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Sure! And that's easy," said Delgas. He turned to Silver. "You got a kind
  of an upstage way about you," he declared. "And maybe you ain't been very
  friendly toward the pair of us, now and then. But that don't matter to me so
  much. I can get on with anybody. My skin is thick enough. And I got a place
  in my system where I could use the dough we're goin' to pull down out of this
  business."</p>

  <p>"So have I," said Rutherford. "All we need to do is to lay down a scheme
  to run the ranch. One of us has to run it, and the others stand by, and make
  a few suggestions."</p>

  <p>"It won't work," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Rutherford sharply.</p>

  <p>Silver turned up the palm of his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Do the same thing," he said to the others.</p>

  <p>They obeyed him, frowning with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"We've got soft hands," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Now, what the devil does that mean?" asked Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Why, it means that we don't know enough about the business to run a
  ranch, any of us," answered Rutherford shortly.</p>

  <p>He left his chair and walked rapidly back and forth through the room. He
  seemed to be angry. Now and then he swore softly under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Well," he exclaimed suddenly, stopping right in front of Silver, "what's
  the solution?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't any," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"What have you got, then?"</p>

  <p>"Only an idea."</p>

  <p>"Let's have it, Silver. Nobody accuses you of being a fathead. Fire away
  with the idea," urged Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"My idea is that we all step out and let a fourth man run the place,"
  suggested Silver.</p>

  <p>"What man?" snapped Rutherford and Delgas in one voice.</p>

  <p>"Any man we can all agree on," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Name one," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"I haven't any names on the tip of my tongue," said Silver. "How about
  you?"</p>

  <p>"It's all a funny business," said Delgas. "I dunno. I got no ideas. I only
  got a hunch that maybe Wycombe was right and a lot of trouble is likely to
  grow out of this here deal. Dead men don't enjoy the money they spend."</p>

  <p>There was such truth in this remark that a short silence followed.</p>

  <p>"How's the place running now?" demanded Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well, I suppose," said Silver. "The foreman knows his business. If
  he could suit a hound like Wycombe, he ought to suit us."</p>

  <p>"There is something in that," agreed Delgas instantly.</p>

  <p>"Make him the manager?" asked Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"You fellows think that I'm sure to be against you, and that I'm sure to
  try to put one over on you," said Silver. "Get that idea out of your head. If
  you don't want Farrel, take anybody you like&mdash;if I like him, too."</p>

  <p>Delgas and Rutherford looked fixedly at one another.</p>

  <p>"Well, that sounds all right to me," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>Rutherford shrugged his narrow shoulders. He sat down, made a cigarette
  with the fingers of a conjurer, and lighted it. He spoke, breathing out the
  smoke through nose and mouth.</p>

  <p>"Make it Farrel till we vote him out," suggested Rutherford. "A majority
  vote puts one ranch manager out and a new one in. This is a democratic
  country, and the majority ought to rule."</p>

  <p>"You've got your voters all in a lump," answered Silver. "No. One vote has
  to be enough to put out the manager. And a new one can't go in until every
  one of the three of us is satisfied."</p>

  <p>There was another silence.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Rutherford, "that might mean never. We might never hit on the
  kind of a fellow who would please all of us. I'm for putting this whole ranch
  on sale and getting rid of it."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't get a quarter of what it's worth," complained Delgas. "I
  asked a couple of bankers what this here place is worth. The money they
  talked made me sick, I can tell you! They don't want to pay nothing. Nothing
  at all! There ain't any market for desert land, like this. People are afraid
  of a big drought when even the well might go dry, and then the cows would
  starve before they could be drove to the nearest water hole. And all we could
  do would be to sell the cattle and call it quits. And I ain't ready to be
  robbed like that!"</p>

  <p>"Nor I!" said Rutherford. He turned to Silver, saying: "We'll start out
  with Farrel, then. Your man Farrel will make a start. If any of us don't like
  him, he's fired on the spot. That suit you?"</p>

  <p>"That has to suit," answered Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>He stood up.</p>

  <p>"You boys," he said, "have been talking about building a shack up in the
  foothills. You don't have to. You can stay right here and live in the house.
  It belongs to me, but you're mighty welcome to room in it."</p>

  <p>He walked out of the room and into the kitchen, where he saw the girl. She
  had had sleepless nights since the death of Wycombe, and now there were black
  shadows inlaid around her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said Silver. "Farrel stays on. He's not the foreman, but
  the manager."</p>

  <p>He went out to the place where Farrel was nailing some new shakes on the
  roof of the big shed. At the signal he gave, Farrel came quickly down to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"You're to stay on as manager," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Farrel. "I know you did that for me, Jim. It's not the
  first good thing you've done for me, though. Are things going to be all
  right?"</p>

  <p>"All right?" echoed Silver, laughing a little. "Why, man, one of these
  days there's going to be an explosion big enough to blow up everything."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you stay?" asked Farrel, agape. "Two of 'em to one of you.
  I'd be on your side, but I'm no gunman. Why do you stay, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Silver, "I don't know when the explosion will come, and I
  like to hear the fuse burn."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; TROUBLE'S SIGN</h2>

  <p class="first">Since Jim Silver looked for a storm, he was by no means
  deceived by the perfect peace and quiet of the first few days that followed,
  when big Morris Delgas and Harry Rutherford were both the perfection of
  consideration, as far as they knew how to be.</p>

  <p>For one thing, they seemed to be taking very seriously their new-found
  duties as ranchers, for they were hardly ever at the ranch house, except for
  meals. The lunch hour they often missed completely when they went off on a
  whole day of exploration&mdash;"a day's hunt," as Morrie Delgas used to say,
  "to find mountain lions, mountain sheep, or mountain suckers."</p>

  <p>Morrie Delgas was very gay. His loud voice boomed through the house. His
  heavy step thundered on the floor. Rutherford, beside him, was like a cat
  beside a horse, speaking little, keeping himself neat always, with a pale
  smile on his pale face. But, by the shifting lights in his eyes, it was plain
  that his mind was never still.</p>

  <p>There was only one sign of trouble, a few days after Delgas and Rutherford
  came to live at the house. At the breakfast table, after Delgas had had his
  "eye opener" of rye, he boomed out to Silver:</p>

  <p>"You've got the ready cash, Silver. You've got heaps of it, and we're just
  about broke. How about a couple of thousand on account?"</p>

  <p>Silver looked across the table and permitted his smile to broaden a
  trifle.</p>

  <p>"You mean a couple of hundred, Morrie, don't you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Delgas stared back, not at Silver but at Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"He says that I mean a couple of hundred, not grands," quoted Delgas.</p>

  <p>Rutherford nodded. Nothing further was said, no gesture made to accept the
  money. Delgas seemed to be hearing what he expected, and Silver knew by a
  thrill in his bones that trouble had been brought still closer to him.</p>

  <p>Two days later, Farrel reported quietly to Silver that he was beginning to
  have trouble with the men.</p>

  <p>"They look me in the eye and swallow their grins," said Farrel. "I feel
  their eyes following me, too, and their grins when my back is turned."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"You know," said Farrel, "one bad apple will spoil a barrel. And this gang
  was always a tough lot to handle. Wycombe wanted them that way. He never
  employed a man that hadn't done time."</p>

  <p>"You mean all the lads on the place have a prison record of some sort?"
  asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean," answered Farrel. "Wycombe always felt that he might
  get into a pinch where he'd want tough fellows around him, to back him up. So
  he collected this crew. Only, when he heard that both Delgas and Rutherford
  were on the trail after him, he lost his nerve and sent for you. He needed a
  bigger gun than any he'd ever hired, so he got hold of you. But there's not a
  man on the place that isn't pretty good with guns, in one way or another.
  Wycombe knew I hadn't been in jail, and that suited him because he wanted an
  honest foreman to handle accounts."</p>

  <p>"How have you managed to handle this gang?" asked Silver curiously.</p>

  <p>"I'm a little better with my hands than they are," said Farrel. "Besides,
  I know one end of a gun from another. They don't want trouble with me unless
  it's worth their while; but, if it is worth their while, any one of the lot
  would be glad enough to rip into me, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"What bad apples were dropped into the barrel?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"You guess," answered the foreman.</p>

  <p>"You mean Delgas and Rutherford?"</p>

  <p>"They're not too busy riding the range for the sake of hunting," said
  Farrel. "They never bring any game in. And they don't need all of this time
  to look over the lay of the land on the ranch. But I've spotted one of them
  time and again, off on the sky line, talking to one of the punchers and then
  fading out of the picture. They got up into the foothills, too. I don't know
  for what."</p>

  <p>"Any guesses?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But nothing I can back on."</p>

  <p>"Fire away."</p>

  <p>"I think that they're in touch with crooks who'll buy a lot of cattle if
  they can get 'em at the right price. The other day I bumped into Sam Waring
  riding across our range. You know Sam?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair and let the sun flow over his body while his
  eyes were closed.</p>

  <p>Farrel regarded the placid calm of his "one-third" boss with a troubled
  eye. He stepped closer as he added:</p>

  <p>"Sam Waring is a tough hombre. He's as tough as they come. He's done
  plenty of time, and he's been up for counterfeiting. You know that they're
  tough when they handle the green goods."</p>

  <p>"That's Federal business. Yes, they're tough or crazy when they handle the
  green goods," agreed Silver, opening his eyes drowsily.</p>

  <p>"Waring," said Farrel, "isn't up here for his health. He's in on some deal
  or he wouldn't be around. He told me that he was just passing through on a
  line for the other side of the Farrel Mountains. But I think he was lying.
  He'd make a good running mate for Delgas and that ghoul of a Rutherford. If
  he's that close to them, it'll be strange if they don't get together."</p>

  <p>"You don't like Rutherford?" said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Do you?" asked Farrel.</p>

  <p>"He's a handsome fellow," said Silver. "Go on and think out loud, Danny."
  Farrel hesitated.</p>

  <p>Then he exploded: "In two days the punchers on this place could sweep
  every sound head of cattle right off up the valleys in the foothills and turn
  'em over to anybody with the cash to pay half value on the nail! And Waring
  always represents plenty of money. My hunch is that he's been sent for to
  take the cows&mdash;at a price."</p>

  <p>"Why does this burn you all up?" asked Silver lazily.</p>

  <p>"Why?" cried Farrel. "Because I've put in my years building the herd. When
  I came here, there was a scratch lot of worthless beef too weak to cover
  ground for fodder and get back to water again. I've traded and bred and
  fought and prayed to make this herd what it is. I came onto the job when I
  was a kid. I'm not very old now, but, believe me, I've done a lifetime's work
  already, I think.</p>

  <p>"This herd is what it ought to be&mdash;long and rangy, with enough bone
  to carry flesh when the cattle go north to fatten on good grasslands. It's my
  work. It's the sort of a herd that used to run on the place when my father
  had the ground. You can't build the right sort of a herd in a minute. It
  takes years. Once it's wiped out, you have to go clear back to the start, and
  that's hard. Maybe you'll never hit just the right combination again. And now
  a pair of crooks are likely to wipe out all the work that I've done. That's
  why I'm burning up! That's why I want to know what you intend to do about
  it."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Nothing?" cried Farrel.</p>

  <p>"Not a thing&mdash;yet," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Then you're not worth the powder it would take to blow you up!" shouted
  Farrel.</p>

  <p>Silver closed his half-opened eyes again.</p>

  <p>Farrel's footsteps strode to the door and halted there.</p>

  <p>"I've said too much," he growled. "You saved my hide, the other night. I
  forgot that for a minute. I remember it now. Silver, does it make any
  difference if I say I'm sorry?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. It's all right," said Silver. "Don't worry about me. Just tell me
  why Delgas and Rutherford should want to sell all the stock off at about half
  price, will you?"</p>

  <p>He kept his eyes closed, but he could feel young Farrel coming back toward
  him. The voice of the foreman grew louder, more vibrant again.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Farrel, "if your share is thrown in with theirs and sold,
  they won't be losing so very much. Because fellows like that always prefer
  hard cash to anything else in the world. Finally, because, once the cattle
  are gone, they'll soon have you off the ranch&mdash;and they hate your heart.
  I've seen them looking at you when your back was turned. They hate your
  heart."</p>

  <p>Silver, without opening his eyes, took a sack of tobacco out of a breast
  pocket, together with a little battered pack of wheat-straw papers. Deftly
  and blindly he made his cigarette, a trick very worthwhile to one who often
  must ride at night. He crimped one end of his smoke, put the other between
  his lips, took out a cube of sulphur matches, and scratched one of them under
  the arm of his chair.</p>

  <p>He allowed that match to burn for an instant so that the sulphur fumes
  would clear away. Then he lighted his cigarette and threw the match into the
  air. The flame fluttered out. The match left in the air a little
  irregular-curving streak of blue smoke. And still the eyes of Silver were not
  open as he smoked.</p>

  <p>Farrel, biting his lips, took heed of all of these details.</p>

  <p>"They want me out of the way?" said Silver. "How does having the cattle
  wangle that for them?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see?" argued the other. "That's your hold on them in this
  bargain about the leaving of the ranch?"</p>

  <p>"I've got the house and the water rights."</p>

  <p>"The house doesn't matter. And the water rights don't matter if there
  aren't any cattle to need the water. You'll be stuck here with nothing on
  your hands except the hard cash that you pulled down in the deal. You'll have
  ho land; you'll have no cows; you'll have to clear out; and then they will
  manage to sell off the land. They'll pull the wool over the eyes of some fool
  of a tenderfoot buyer and make him think that he gets the water rights with
  the land. Isn't that clear?"</p>

  <p>Silver whistled.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't thought of all that," said he.</p>

  <p>"And now," urged Farrel, "tell me what you're to do about it, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to think," said Silver, and continued to smoke with closed
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Farrel endured the picture of indifference as long as he could. Then he
  turned without a word and strode out of the room.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Silver continued to lead the life of an idler, rarely leaving the house.
  He was in bed early. He was up very late. As he sat alone at his breakfast,
  he could sometimes feel the eye of the girl fixed upon him with a melancholy
  appeal, but neither she nor Farrel spoke a word to him about the subject of
  Farrel's anxiety.</p>

  <p>It was two days after this that the next step was made toward tragedy.
  Farrel came into the house in the middle of the day.</p>

  <p>Through the window of his room, where he lounged in the easy-chair, Silver
  saw the foreman come from the corral with bowed head. In the kitchen, Farrel
  paused for a moment, and Silver heard the girl cry out sharply with pain.</p>

  <p>By that, Silver knew what had happened. He knew still better when Farrel
  stood before him in the room, looking years older, wrinkled about the eyes,
  drawn, battered of face like one who has faced a great storm for many
  hours.</p>

  <p>"Delgas and Rutherford have fired me," said Farrel. "They sent me to you
  for my pay."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash; NINE AGAINST TWO</h2>

  <p class="first">From the expression in the face of Silver, it seemed that he
  was hearing of a thing with which he had been long familiar.</p>

  <p>He took out a wallet.</p>

  <p>"What's owing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I've had fifty from them. You owe me twenty-five."</p>

  <p>Silver passed out the amount and replaced his wallet in his pocket. Farrel
  went back to the door and made a farewell speech.</p>

  <p>"I thought it might be that we could make a fight to save the herd," he
  declared. "I thought you might be the one man in the world to beat those
  crooks. But I guess you're too tired. I'm thanking you for the life that I
  still walk around with&mdash;and&mdash;so long, Silver."</p>

  <p>He was half through the doorway when Silver, his hands folded beneath his
  head, his eyes lazy, turned a little in the chair and asked:</p>

  <p>"Where you going, Danny?"</p>

  <p>"Going?" answered Danny. "I don't know. I don't care. Just somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Why not stay here?"</p>

  <p>"Here? I'm fired, I tell you. I've been paid off."</p>

  <p>"You've been paid off by the ranch. Now I hire you again at the same rate
  of pay," said Silver.</p>

  <p>At this, Farrel gripped the edge of the door so that the knob of it
  jangled suddenly. Then he made a quick step back inside the room. He pulled
  the door shut as carefully as though death were in the making of a sound, and
  there he stood before Silver, staring with incredulous eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and rest your feet," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what's in the air?" asked Farrel.</p>

  <p>"I'm retaining a good man because I might need him. You've got a room in
  the house. Go upstairs and use it."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Go up and lie down and rest."</p>

  <p>"Rest? I don't need to rest."</p>

  <p>"Do what I tell you," said Silver quietly. "There may be a time ahead when
  you won't rest for quite a spell. So long, Danny. Go take it easy while you
  can."</p>

  <p>Farrel looked at him with blazing eyes. "I might have known," he said,
  with a trembling voice. "I might have known that you wouldn't lie down and
  take it&mdash;like a dog! I don't care what pops. I'm with you to the
  finish." He went out of the room. The keen ear of Silver, afterward, heard
  the excited babbling of voices in the kitchen, and he smiled.</p>

  <p>Delgas and Rutherford came in before supper time, and Delgas said
  carelessly: "That bum of a Dan Farrel, I gave him the rush to-day. He's no
  good."</p>

  <p>"He's a tramp," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>Silver, reclined in his chair, looked over the two of them casually. The
  face of Rutherford, which generally was the color of a cellar-grown plant,
  was now patched with sunburn, and his lips were gray from the chapping wind
  raised by a galloping horse. Dust had reddened the eyes of both men. Delgas
  had fortified his greasy skin by letting a week's beard darken his face. They
  sat down uninvited in the room of Silver and lighted cigars.</p>

  <p>"Not much cow sense&mdash;Farrel?" asked Silver gently.</p>

  <p>"Cow sense? No sense at all," said Delgas. "I been watching him. I been
  out and around, since I came onto this place. You been layin' low and takin'
  things easy. That's all right if it's your way, but I mean to make a real
  ranch out of this dump. Know that, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"I even got Harry Rutherford interested," said Delgas. "He thinks that
  some of my ideas are pretty good, eh, Harry?"</p>

  <p>Rutherford shrugged his shoulders. He sat on the base of his spine and
  inhaled the strong smoke of the cigar and then blew it in a swift stream high
  toward the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"What we gotta do is use some brains," said Delgas. "That's what we gotta
  do. And I'll tell you the trouble with Farrel. Know what it is?"</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Silver.</p>

  <p>"No brains," said Delgas. "Eh, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"No brains," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry about that," said Silver. "He looks to me like a decent
  sort."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Clean hands," said Delgas. "Yeah, clean hands and a washout for a
  brain, eh, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"Washout," said Harry Rutherford, coldly, to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Just a dumb kind of an hombre," said Delgas. "It's lucky that we been out
  and watched him workin' the men. That's the main trouble. The men don't care
  a thing about him. Eh, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"He looks like something," went on Delgas, clearing his throat, "and he
  stands like something, and he sticks out his chest like something. But he
  ain't nothing at all. He's a blank. So we gave him the bum's rush. Just
  thought we'd tell you, though."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Silver. He made a cigarette in his unconcerned way.</p>

  <p>"You're having a rest, Silver, eh?" said Rutherford, suddenly curious.
  "From what I knew about you, I thought you were the sort of an hombre that
  never ran dry, never got out of patience, never knew what it was to quit.
  That all wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I only do what I have to do," said Silver, smiling.</p>

  <p>Rutherford was sitting straight up, his eyes lighted with keen
  concentration, a focused brilliance.</p>

  <p>"You're different from what I thought," admitted Harry Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Silver, still smiling.</p>

  <p>Rutherford's eyes were darkened by a frown.</p>

  <p>"Unless you're putting on a front for me," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Aw, quit tryin' to get behind everything," protested Delgas, pulling out
  a flask and putting it to his lips for a long swig. "You take a bird like
  Harry, that's got brains, and the trouble with him is that he's always trying
  to use 'em. Know that? Never contented. Always got to keep hammerin' away at
  people. Give a gent a chance to rest, will you, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, will you?" answered Rutherford softly. And still he peered at
  Silver and at the steady, dull-eyed smile with which Silver looked back at
  him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Rutherford rose, went to the door, paused there, and finally left
  the room.</p>

  <p>Delgas looked after him, his grin gradually widening on both sides of his
  cigar, his brown-stained lips shining with the juice from the tobacco.</p>

  <p>"Funny, ain't he?" he said to Silver. "He's got something in his head, has
  that bird Rutherford. He is like a bird&mdash;just like a bird, always
  cocking his head around and looking at something. He don't give you no peace,
  not when you're his partner. Now I tell you what&mdash;I gotta go and corral
  him and find out what's made him so shifty on his pins, all at once. See you
  later, brother."</p>

  <p>He in turn paused at the door.</p>

  <p>"You paid off your third to Farrel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I paid him," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Good riddance," said Delgas. "Cheap at twice the price, I say." He was
  smiling more broadly than ever as he turned and left the room.</p>

  <p>Before supper time, as Silver lay quietly in his chair and watched the
  evening rise like blue water among the canyons of the mountains, Farrel
  tapped at the door and came in again. He said uneasily:</p>

  <p>"There's going to be an explosion if I walk into that dining room after
  the pair of them have fired me off the place."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Silver, couching his big head in his hands again, "there's
  got to be an explosion some time, and you've had a long rest, this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>Farrel went to the window and looked out as though something had suddenly
  taken his eyes, but Silver knew that he was looking at nothing but the
  sweetness of life. It might well be that both of them were hardly an hour
  from the end of everything.</p>

  <p>"There has to be a show-down," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"You told 'em that you'd keep me on?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Silver, and watched his man wince. Farrel stepped back from the
  window and turned a gray face to Silver.</p>

  <p>"What's the good?" he asked. "Seven and two make nine. There's nine of
  'em. Nine against two. That's not funny."</p>

  <p>"No, that's not funny," said Silver lazily, yawning out the words.</p>

  <p>Farrel suddenly pointed a hand at him and said: "I think you like this
  sort of a business! It's fun, for you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Silver. "It just has to be done. That's all."</p>

  <p>Farrel cleared his throat, made a turn through the room, confronted that
  placid face again.</p>

  <p>"Two men can't kill nine. Not nine like them. Not in a closed room.
  There's no chance."</p>

  <p>"There's no chance," said Silver, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Then what the devil?" demanded Farrel.</p>

  <p>"We've got to keep the devil out, I'd say. Keep the devil out of their
  heads and the guns out of their hands."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"You come in after everybody else has sat down. Will you do that?"</p>

  <p>Farrel drew a long breath. His right hand doubled into a fist and then
  slowly relaxed again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said slowly. "I'll come in&mdash;after everybody else is at the
  table."</p>

  <p>"Good boy," said Silver. "You'll be heeled, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a gun. So have all the rest of those tramps."</p>

  <p>"Carry two guns, and then you'll be one up on some of them."</p>

  <p>"I thought you said the thing was for us to keep this from coming to a
  fight?"</p>

  <p>"I did," answered Silver. "But if the fighting starts, we want to scratch
  them up a little, eh? We want to make a few dents."</p>

  <p>"Silver," murmured the other, "we may both be dead men, in half an
  hour!"</p>

  <p>"We certainly may," said Silver. "But there has to be a show-down, or else
  they're apt simply to pick us up and throw us off the ranch. If they once
  have us on the run, they'll keep us there."</p>

  <p>Farrel looked out the darkening window and muttered: "Well, it's better
  than chucking in our hand. I'll walk in&mdash;with two guns on me. And
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Silver, "after that we'll have to watch the play of the
  cards. That's all. Just see how they fall."</p>

  <p>Farrel smiled a twisted smile, saying: "And follow the lead?"</p>

  <p>Silver sat up and suddenly caught the hand of the cow-puncher.</p>

  <p>"That's it, Danny," he said. "Play all your cards&mdash;and follow the
  lead!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE SHOW-DOWN</h2>

  <p class="first">Trouble was so thick in the air of the dining room, that
  night, that the girl seemed to sense it long before the men came in. Perhaps
  she had been watching their faces through the window, and listening to their
  voices. At any rate, she had a sick, pale face when Silver walked through the
  kitchen as the gong sounded. She stood back with a great platter of corn
  bread to let him pass, and her frightened eyes turned up silently to his
  face.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Esther?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Say it," persuaded Silver. "It's better to talk a thing out."</p>

  <p>"What will happen?" she breathed, with a tremor of hysteria in her voice.
  "What will they do to Danny&mdash;and you?"</p>

  <p>"What does Danny think?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't said anything. But I know he was fired, and that you took him
  on again. You don't think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Everything is going to be all right," said Silver. "Enough has happened
  in that dining room already. It ought to be peaceful the rest of its
  life."</p>

  <p>He walked on into the dining room, where there was a great scuffling of
  feet and groaning of chair legs as the punchers took their places. One thing
  was instantly noticeable: Delgas sat at the top of the table, which hitherto
  had been Silver's place, not because he had any essential right to that chair
  but because the weight of his name was greater than the repute of either of
  the other owners of the ranch. Now Delgas was there, squaring his great
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>Silver went down toward the foot of the table and took a vacant chair.
  Delgas looked at him flat in the eye, saying:</p>

  <p>"Turn and turn about, eh, Jim? I thought I'd try the fit of this
  place."</p>

  <p>All eyes flashed toward Silver. When they saw him merely smile, one of the
  men burst out with loud laughter. He choked it off suddenly.</p>

  <p>It was Red, who was in the act of hanging his sombrero on a peg of the
  wall; now he changed his mind and put the hat on the back of his head before
  he sat down. He sat a little sidewise, as though he were ready to talk rather
  than to eat. And his mischievous, bright eyes went back and forth across the
  other faces around him.</p>

  <p>The clatter of the crockery and the clashing of the knives and forks had
  begun in another moment when tall Dan Farrel walked quietly through the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Hey! There's the big stiff now!" shouted a puncher.</p>

  <p>Farrel got to the vacant chair which had not been noticed before. He was
  pale. He wore a wooden, brittle smile that made Silver bite his lip. For,
  without help, he knew that he could never win through the scene that was to
  come.</p>

  <p>All the banter had disappeared from the eyes of the men about the table,
  as they saw Farrel sitting down. Rutherford looked straight at Silver, and
  seemed to wait. It was Delgas who heaved himself to his feet and
  bellowed:</p>

  <p>"You bum, you ain't wanted. Get out of that chair! You're fired. Get off
  the ranch, you namby-pamby blockhead! You ain't wanted. Get out before I
  throw you out!"</p>

  <p>"I'm hired again," said Farrel, with a barely audible voice. He cleared
  his throat.</p>

  <p>"Hired? You lie!" yelled Delgas, throwing his head from side to side. "You
  lie and you lie loud! Who hired you again?"</p>

  <p>"Jim Silver," said Farrel, sitting stiffly erect on the edge of his
  chair.</p>

  <p>The words struck a silence through the room. Every man at the table
  stirred a little, and all eyes centered on Silver, as though Farrel no longer
  existed.</p>

  <p>"You?" called Delgas in a mighty voice. "You hired that fool again?"</p>

  <p>"You know, Morrie," said Silver, "that what's a fool to you might be a
  wise man to me. We don't all want the same things."</p>

  <p>Delgas looked aside at Rutherford, but Rutherford stared only at Silver,
  like a hungry cat. He was not paler. He was simply set and ready. Silver
  folded his arms. He smiled straight back at Delgas.</p>

  <p>"We don't want the same things, eh?" said Delgas. "I wanta know what there
  is around here that you'd like to change?"</p>

  <p>The arms of Silver unfolded, and two oversized Colts winged in his hands.
  One of them pointed at Rutherford. With the left-hand gun he shot the hat off
  the head of Red.</p>

  <p>From the corner of his eye he saw that two guns were now in the hands of
  Farrel, and he breathed more easily. With that backing, he might win.</p>

  <p>Out of the kitchen came a scream, and Silver surmised that the girl was
  watching through the dining-room doorway. Rutherford sat with his right hand
  deep beneath his coat, motionless. He had been fully prepared, and yet he was
  a thousandth part of a second too late, and knew it. Delgas, too, had flung a
  hand back to his hip and kept it there. Not a man at the table that had
  failed to make a move toward a gun, only to have the firing of the shot make
  each one realize that he was too late and that he, perhaps, would be the next
  target.</p>

  <p>As for Red, he had ducked his head forward and looked at Silver as if at a
  hangman who was about to drop the trap.</p>

  <p>All of this Silver saw by the time the hat of Red had flown into the air,
  struck the wall, and flopped loudly against the floor. All noises were loud
  now. With a little care, one could distinguish the breathing of every man at
  the table.</p>

  <p>"One thing I'll change at the start," said Silver, "is the wearing of hats
  at the table. The second thing I'll change is cursing out any man that works
  for me. Delgas, watch yourself!"</p>

  <p>For the shoulder of Delgas had twitched a little.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Morris Delgas in a barely audible voice.</p>

  <p>Silver stood up slowly. If he made a swift move, he knew that every man at
  the table would grab at a gun. So he rose slowly. He seemed to be watching
  everybody, but in reality he had his eye on Delgas and Rutherford only.
  Rutherford, he knew, was his chief care. However formidable Delgas might be
  as a great brute of a man, he was nothing compared to the catlike speed and
  surety of Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Stand up, Farrel," commanded Silver. "Start at the end of the table with
  Delgas and go around the line. See how much hardware you can collect and pile
  it on the floor."</p>

  <p>"If you do that&mdash;" began Rutherford, and then stopped himself. He was
  pale enough now. All the heat and color of his body had gone into his eyes as
  he stared at Silvertip, and Jim Silver knew that before the end of the game
  one of the two of them would have to die. This moment in the dining room was
  only the first trick. Others would inevitably follow.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to do that," said Silver. "Start in, Danny. I'll try to
  entertain the rest of you boys while you wait. Go slow and be sure, Danny. We
  ought to collect quite a lot of valuable stuff, this way. Anybody would be
  glad to see it&mdash;a sheriff particularly. Now, the rest of you fellows, I
  know that you're only a lot of cheap rats. You've followed Rutherford and
  Delgas, and you've burned your fingers with the first trick. Other tricks are
  going to come. Perhaps I'll have a chance to see the lot of you dead or
  jailed as a pack of dirty cattle rustlers and horse thieves. I don't know;
  I'm just hoping. Keep your hands on the table; make no quick moves; and you
  can start eating as soon as you've let Danny take a weight off your
  mind."</p>

  <p>Farrel had reached a long-drawn, lean-faced cow-puncher who said
  gently:</p>

  <p>"I'm goin' to cut your heart out for this, Farrel."</p>

  <p>Farrel said nothing. He went on with his collection. There was not a man
  at the table who carried less than one revolver. A good many had knives,
  also. The collection went on gradually.</p>

  <p>"Come down here and take my place," said Silver. "Down here, Delgas. I
  thought you might fit at the head of the table, but I see you're not man
  enough."</p>

  <p>Delgas, breathing like a steam engine, walked silently down the room.</p>

  <p>"I ain't hungry," he said. "I'm goin' to go outside."</p>

  <p>"To get a rifle and start shooting through the door?" asked Silver,
  smiling. "No; wait a while, and maybe your appetite will come back."</p>

  <p>Delgas took the vacated place where Silver had been sitting. The man
  seemed to be suffering from a fit that contracted the muscles of his body and
  twisted his face into a horror. He was insane with a rage which he dared not
  express in action, but his hands gripped the edge of the table so hard that
  his arms shuddered with the might of that grasp.</p>

  <p>When the crew had been disarmed thoroughly, from first to last, Silver
  said:</p>

  <p>"Some of you boys may have a decent streak in you. If you have, stay in
  the room after the rest go out. That's all. I can use a right man who thinks
  that he can use me. Now those of you who want to finish supper, stay right in
  your places. The rest of you can file out. Danny, pull down the blinds of
  those windows and watch the door."</p>

  <p>He paused. Every man arose. Only Red seemed to find it hard to get out of
  his chair, as he kept his fascinated eyes upon the face of Silver. But
  Delgas, in passing, spoke one word to him, and Red nodded and followed.</p>

  <p>They went out the door with Rutherford, as might have been expected, the
  last one through&mdash;a rear guard to see that the rest did the right thing
  for him.</p>

  <p>For his own part, he turned and bowed to Silver, a little, short jerk of
  head and body, as though he were acknowledging an introduction.</p>

  <p>"Silver, you're quite a fellow," he said. "When the time comes for the
  finish of you, it ought to be a party I'll want to remember. So long!"</p>

  <p>And he stepped out into the dark of the night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; BESIEGED</h2>

  <p class="first">Routed troops need a time for rallying, even if they have
  fallen back without loss. After the sinister face of Rutherford had
  disappeared from the doorway, the two men and the girl inside the house could
  hear the scattering of voices drawing gradually together, increasing in
  loudness. It left one moment for consultation to the three.</p>

  <p>Silver, as he turned toward the frightened girl, saw that she was carrying
  a double-barreled shotgun that dragged down her arm with its weight. But, no
  matter how white her face or how big her eyes, it was clear that she was not
  near fainting. She had meant business with that powerful weapon so long as
  her lover was in danger.</p>

  <p>Tall Dan Farrel locked the door swiftly. As he turned, he was saying:</p>

  <p>"Silver, if we get into the kitchen side of the house, we could stand a
  siege, maybe. They're not through with us. There are other guns they'll get
  their hands on. This heap isn't all that they have. They'll come back at
  us."</p>

  <p>Silver was gathering the weighty heap of revolvers; he let the big knives
  lie.</p>

  <p>"You're right," he told Farrel. "They may try to rush us, but I doubt it.
  There's no use in trying to watch all sides of the house. We can't do it.
  Better get into the kitchen and wait there. It has windows looking on two
  sides."</p>

  <p>What he said was law. They got into the kitchen, locked and braced chairs
  against the doors from it leading into the dining room and the main body of
  the house, and hastily threw open the windows to either side and the kitchen
  door which faced the big shed.</p>

  <p>For, as Silver said, it was necessary for them to look out on the ground
  nearby. The lamp in the kitchen was out. The girl sat in a chair against the
  wall, facing the stove. Silver had for his province the window and door
  toward the big corral. Farrel had the surveillance of the opposite
  window.</p>

  <p>Farrel sat in a chair near the window with a rifle across his knees.
  Silver lay flat on the floor with another rifle beside him. The girl still
  kept her double-barreled shotgun. If it came to a sudden rush, that weapon
  might do more execution than a dozen rifles. Silver expected no mass attack
  simply because there was little practical value behind such a move. It would
  gratify the spite of the offended men, but it would put no hard cash into the
  pockets of their leaders.</p>

  <p>Inside, a big-lidded kettle was muttering and hissing on the stove, from
  which red pencils of light flowed through the darkness. But the outer night
  was more fully illumined. Silver could see the upward flow of the mountains
  against the northern stars, and the gaunt legs of the windmill, and the
  great, rounded mass of the iron tank which seemed suspended in the air
  without support. He could make out portions of the fence, also, and guess at
  the position of the two haystacks. The shed itself was, of course, clearly
  discernible as to the roof, but the rest of it merged toward the shadows of
  the ground. It seemed easier to look into the distance and make out the
  objects near the horizon than to study things close at hand.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be a motion of the ground toward the house. The surface
  seemed to be pouring slowly toward his watchful eyes.</p>

  <p>He tried his rifle sights at big objects and small. He drew a bead on the
  wavering streak of a fence post, even; but the star sheen along the barrel
  troubled him a little. He went to the stove, got some of the blacking on his
  fingers, and smeared that along the top of the rifle barrel. He went back and
  lay down.</p>

  <p>"If they put fire to the house&mdash;" said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" commanded Silver.</p>

  <p>She was quiet. Farrel cleared his throat softly, very softly.</p>

  <p>Out of the distance, now, they heard outbreaks of loud, arguing voices.
  These noises were interspersed with moments of silence; there followed a
  considerable time when not a sound was heard except from the windmill. A
  breeze was turning the wheel slowly; at intervals the stream from the pump
  dropped. The water in the tank was so low that the water fell like a hand on
  a brazen drum, with splashings and reverberations. This noise seemed to grow
  louder and louder. Sometimes it was as if the windmill and tank were moving
  toward the house. Silver kept on taking sights at everything he could see,
  making his vision small enough to grasp the least possible targets.</p>

  <p>Then a tumult broke out in the dining room. The door went down with a
  crash&mdash;that door, it seemed, which communicated with the outside.
  Footfalls boomed on the floor. A ray of light worked fitfully around the
  edges of the door that closed the kitchen away from the dining room. A hand
  shook that door. Silver promptly put a bullet high up through the
  woodwork.</p>

  <p>He had fired high on purpose. To shoot even at hostile men with nothing
  but blind chance to guide the bullet was against his nature, and the force of
  necessity had little control over his instincts. But, though he purposely had
  fired the warning shot high, a yell of derision came from the men in the next
  room. There seemed to be three or four of them, at least. Their footfalls
  rapidly retreated; they made no further effort, for the moment, to get into
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>After that, a portion of them, at least, were heard leaving the dining
  room. Perhaps one man was left there as a guard and spy to hem in the
  maneuvers of the three.</p>

  <p>Silver saw a dim silhouette of a man move out toward the big corral and
  the shed. Another and another stealthy figure followed. Parade was out there
  in the shed, either munching hay or lying down at ease. Parade was there, but
  Silver would not fire at the unknown men on account of any hope of preserving
  the stallion. He had, in fact, a strong hope that the horse would be able to
  preserve himself.</p>

  <p>Then Farrel fired a shot. The boom of the gun was thunderous in the small
  kitchen. It seemed to bring a jingling echo out of the iron-work of the
  stove. Outside, there was silence. Then voices stirred far away at the horse
  shed, followed by an outcry of curses at the farther end of the house.</p>

  <p>"I missed that one, all right," Farrel said. "I won't miss the next, I
  hope."</p>

  <p>They heard doors flung open, and heavy feet trampling across floors. At
  last there were men in the next room, where Silver had lounged all those
  recent days.</p>

  <p>Someone bawled out: "We got you! We know you're in the kitchen. We're
  goin' to blow you to pieces, Silver! We're goin' to smear you all over the
  place."</p>

  <p>Silver said nothing.</p>

  <p>He could make out the rumbling voice of Delgas saying: "This is where the
  hound has been takin' it easy. This is where he's been sleepin' away his
  days. Oh, ain't he goin' to eat his heart&mdash;ain't he eatin' it now, to
  think what a fool we've made of him?"</p>

  <p>One of the others laughed. Someone burst out in a tirade. Silver got up
  and went quietly to the door that opened on this room. He began to move away,
  silently, the chairs that were braced against it.</p>

  <p>Then the girl reached for him and found him in the darkness. "Don't do it!
  Don't do it!" she said.</p>

  <p>"What?" whispered Silver.</p>

  <p>"You want to throw that door open and sweep them out of the house. Don't
  do it, Jim. Please don't go mad!"</p>

  <p>He realized that he was mad, that an overmastering hunger to destroy them
  like reptiles had made a blackness of his brain. He put the chair soundlessly
  back in place and went back to lie on the floor at the door.</p>

  <p>Some day, he knew, he would be led to throw his life away by the headlong
  sweeping of one of those fighting impulses of his that throttled his good
  sense and judgment. He grew afraid, as he lay there, not of all the danger
  that lay in the outer night but of himself. He began to forget the whole
  situation and wonder about himself; but all the while he was as alert as a
  wild cat hunting over strange ground.</p>

  <p>From the horse shed came a crashing and snorting.</p>

  <p>It raised him to his feet. The girl was beside him again, with her hand on
  his arm. He struck it away and strode for the door. She gripped him
  again.</p>

  <p>"They're waiting for you to go out, when you hear Parade!" she warned him.
  "They're watching this door and the window, hoping that you'll come out.
  They're watching from each side, I know. They want to murder you, Jim!"</p>

  <p>He thought of the soft gold of Parade and of the flexible steel that
  underlay the surface; he thought of the great wise brain of the stallion and
  the heart without fear. He began to tremble. The girl's hands kept pulsing
  against him, not strongly, but with a steady rhythm.</p>

  <p>"No," he whispered at last. "I won't go. I'm ashamed. I'm only a fool and
  a baby. And you see through me. But I won't go."</p>

  <p>He made himself get down on one knee, and then she went back to her place
  against the wall.</p>

  <p>"She's the captain, the leader, the brain, and I'm only a pair of blind
  hands working by direction," he told himself.</p>

  <p>He began to see her with clearness. He saw her more clearly in the
  darkness than ever he had seen her before in the light of the day, for he
  could place his memory on every bit of her.</p>

  <p>She wore rubber gloves to keep her hands from puffing and reddening in the
  dishwater, but nevertheless, potatoes and onions and the handling of meat had
  stained her skin. Her hands were small and well-made but they were not
  pretty. Hands of a woman ought to be smooth and brown; they don't need to be
  very little, but the skin should be perfectly kept, thought Silver. And her
  hands would never be right because all her life she would be working away at
  sewing or cooking or scrubbing floors. She got right down on her knees and
  went after a floor with might and main. He had seen her making the suds fly.
  She scrubbed a floor white, like the deck of a ship. And if she were not
  doing work like that for a husband, she would surely be doing it for
  hire.</p>

  <p>Silver decided, suddenly, that it was the matter of her hands that kept
  her from being beautiful, in his eyes. Her face was well enough. And her eyes
  were a blue stain in it. When she looked at Silver, her eyes and her mouth
  were still with awe; when she looked at Farrel, a smile kept dawning and
  dying on her lips and eyes. She kept taking gentle possession of him with her
  glances.</p>

  <p>It might be a woman something like that who would one day, for the first
  time, fling open the door to Silver's heart and walk in and take command. Men
  said that when the moment came, they were helpless. They resisted, they
  fought against the thing, they fled from it. But they always fled in a circle
  and came back to the starting point. He would be like all the rest&mdash;one
  day!</p>

  <p>Out of the shed figures moved again. A door opened with a crash.</p>

  <p>"Ride him, cowboy! Ride him!" yelled a chorus of voices.</p>

  <p>He heard the brazen neigh of Parade. It made him think of days of long ago
  when he had followed the great horse across the endless desert. That neigh
  had been the challenge that rung in his ears in those times until by chance
  and fortune and kindness, more than strength, at last he made the great horse
  his own. But it was not possession. He belonged to Parade as much as Parade
  belonged to him.</p>

  <p>Now he was fighting against the mastery of another man, out there in the
  darkness. Silver heard the thumping of the hoofs on the ground, then a form
  exploded upward, vaguely spread-eagled against the horizon stars.</p>

  <p>"Get the rope! Hold him! That's it!" shouted voices. "Now, Rutherford, if
  you can ride anything that wears hair, you take your turn!"</p>

  <p>They might wear down Parade among them, taking him turn after turn. A
  whistle trilled suddenly out of the mouth of Silver. It brought as an echo a
  wild tumult, an outcrying. A gun barked, and another weapon spat fire. Then a
  mighty form winged over the corral fence.</p>

  <p>Silver stood up, and called. Right to the kitchen door raced Parade,
  skidded to a halt, then entered, crouched low, feeling his way over the
  sagging, creaking boards, with bended legs. Like a monstrous cat shuddering
  on unknown ground, surrounded by the fear of traps, the big horse entered to
  the voice of Silver. At another word he lay down. His great breathing filled
  the room. The shouting outside was a dim and vague and distant thing to
  Silver, as he ran his hand over the body of the stallion, feeling for
  blood.</p>

  <p>He found nothing. Blood was not running onto the floor, either. The hand
  which gripped the heart of Silver gradually relaxed. He drew his hand slowly
  over the face of the horse, reading the features of it with well-remembering
  finger tips. Then he went back to lie down at guard in the doorway again.</p>

  <p>Out by the shed, men were cursing, blaming one another. And Silver began
  to laugh, a mere soundless vibration in the darkness.</p>

  <p>For toward the east he saw the gleam of an increasing pyramid of light on
  the horizon and he knew that before long the moon would be riding above the
  desert. The instant its bright rim was up, all of those men would be in peril
  around the ranch house, and they must know it by this time. A very little
  longer and they probably would withdraw.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; FARREL'S DECISION</h2>

  <p class="first">The most alarming outburst of all came afterward. Perhaps it
  was the loss of the great horse that maddened the gang, but suddenly in the
  house broke out a great crashing and smashing as if men with axes were
  breaking all they could put their hands on. Voices came into the next room
  and bawled out curses. Other voices shouted in triumph as various bits of
  loot were found.</p>

  <p>And then Rutherford was saying in his calm way: "You've won the second
  round, too, Silver. But the end of the fight hasn't come yet. Something tells
  me that I'm going to have the killing of you, Jim, and ride your horse
  afterward."</p>

  <p>Although he did not lift his voice, he seemed to be speaking right there
  in the kitchen beside Silver. It was an uncanny thing. It sent strange
  shudders of apprehension through the body of Silver.</p>

  <p>After that, the gang withdrew. In the distance behind the corral there
  were noises of the snorting horses as they were saddled and bridled. A few
  loud whoops were raised by the chorus, and after that they heard the beat of
  the departing hoofs.</p>

  <p>Silver went out first, made a tour around the house, and then through the
  darkness of all the rooms inside it. For it was not impossible that a man or
  two might have been left behind to take him by surprise after he had counted
  on the retreat of the entire body. However, he found nothing except the
  smashed furniture and the ruined rooms where the thugs of Rutherford and
  Delgas had wreaked their angry disappointment.</p>

  <p>It was only after he had completed his tour that Silver came back into the
  kitchen, called Parade into the open with a word, and gave permission for the
  kindling of a light. He asked for bacon and corn bread and coffee. He gave
  one glance at the girl and her sweetheart, their faces still pale and set
  from the ordeal that had been passed. Then he said:</p>

  <p>"I'm going outside to have another look around and try to think out the
  next step. Whatever it is, you'll probably have to ride with me and leave
  Esther behind. Say good-by before I get back. That is, if you still want to
  see this business through, Farrel."</p>

  <p>He went outside and watched the rising of the moon as it puffed out its
  swollen yellow cheeks and then, climbing higher in the sky, drew into a
  smaller, brighter sphere of silver. It was one of those nights when a man
  thinks that he can see not the flatness of the disk but the roundness of the
  orb. As Silver watched the progress of the moon, he saw it strike a cloud
  into transparent spray and emerge on the farther side, sweeping along as
  though a stronger wind were in that billowing, bright sail.</p>

  <p>He could not help wondering what that moon would see of him before the sun
  came up to turn its brilliance into no more than a pale-azure cloud in the
  Western sky. Delgas, and the crowd of punchers who had all done time, and
  above all, the pale, thoughtful face of Rutherford&mdash;they would have to
  be encountered, perhaps, before this single night had ended.</p>

  <p>He went back, finally, into the kitchen, and as he entered, he heard young
  Dan Farrel laughing with the girl. The smoke and steam of cookery made a
  bright mist in the room. He felt a tang of appetite greater than he had known
  for a week. The anxiety since the supper gong sounded had been like a day's
  labor to build hunger.</p>

  <p>They sat together, the three of them, while the stallion wandered back and
  forth outside, now and then putting his head through the doorway to watch his
  master, recoiling again because of the offensive smell of cooked meat and
  steaming coffee.</p>

  <p>"He'd rather have oats," said the girl. "I'll get him an apple. Will he
  eat apples?"</p>

  <p>Silver said vaguely: "I remember a time when he ate raw meat. Raw meat,
  wrapped up in fat, and stuffed down his throat. He ate a lot of it. He ate
  nothing else for four days&mdash;and he kept on going!"</p>

  <p>"On a diet of meat?" cried Farrel, agape. "How did that happen? In a
  desert somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty much in a desert. Away down south in Mexico, where the mountains
  are all scalped and where the sun burns the grass down to the roots Sometimes
  I found a cactus and pared the thorns off of it and shredded the fibers and
  gave some of that to Parade, too. It was filthy stuff. It was like offering
  him dry rope. But he'll eat anything in a pinch. He ran wild, you know, and
  wild horses know the point of eating or dying. Parade will always eat!"</p>

  <p>"What was happening?" asked the girl. "Had you just got lost in the
  desert? How terrible!"</p>

  <p>"Lost?" said Silver, more vaguely than before. "Well, that's one way of
  putting it. I had to be lost to the eyes of a lot of hombres who were riding
  after me."</p>

  <p>"After you? But they never caught up with you?"</p>

  <p>Silver looked at her with a very faint and very grim smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "Some of them caught up with me, too. But after a time
  that gang stopped following and turned back."</p>

  <p>"All that were left of 'em?" suggested Farrel eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Silver, as he finished eating and confined his attention to
  coffee, "there's still a job ahead. Farrel, you don't own a hair of a cow or
  an acre of land in the deal. Do you still want to ride with me?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Farrel.</p>

  <p>Silver looked at the girl.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that he ought to?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>She kept looking at Silver with great eyes of fear while she reached out
  for Farrel and blindly found him. Then as her hand tightened on him, she
  said:</p>

  <p>"Yes. I think he ought to go."</p>

  <p>"You've made up your mind?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather," said she, and paused, but went on again: "I'd rather
  remember him dead in a way like that&mdash;than dodging."</p>

  <p>Silver said nothing. He began to frown into his coffee. It was almost
  unprecedented in his life. He had been with plenty of men who were willing to
  fight most desperately, but always because they had as great a goal as he, or
  a greater one. It was a novelty to him to find a fellow who was willing to
  throw himself away out of friendship, or gratitude for a past service.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he should not permit that sacrifice. And yet he had in mind a
  reward that would repay Farrel for every effort, in the end. There was a
  battle to fight, first, and in that battle the odds were exactly nine to
  two&mdash;unless Sam Waring and perhaps sundry others were enlisted in the
  fight before the end.</p>

  <p>He made a cigarette, lighted it, and tried to see the right course more
  clearly through the smoke.</p>

  <p>"You talk, Farrel," he commanded suddenly. "You tell me what we ought to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Go to town," said Farrel. "That's the best way, and get a whole mob of
  gunmen to come out here and mop up the thugs."</p>

  <p>"How far to town?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Ten hours, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"And then two or three hours, anyway, to get together enough of the right
  sort of men and mount them. Another ten hours to get back. That's one
  day."</p>

  <p>Farrel nodded, frowning.</p>

  <p>"It won't do," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Farrel. "It's the best thing that we can do."</p>

  <p>"What will Rutherford do now?" asked Silver of the girl.</p>

  <p>She made a sweeping gesture.</p>

  <p>"He'll have the men clear off the whole place. He'll have them clear off
  every cow on the place and all the horses. Every head of live stock will be
  up there in the foothills, somewhere, within four or five hours. Because
  Danny says that the men have been drifting everything north for days. They
  have them ready, now, for a quick push."</p>

  <p>Silver nodded. "That's what Rutherford will do," he agreed.</p>

  <p>Farrel looked painfully down at the table, before he began to shake his
  head.</p>

  <p>"You're right," he said. "There's not time enough to let us get to town
  and back. There never was time enough for that. There's only the pair of us
  against the nine of them&mdash;plus a lot of others that we don't know
  anything about!"</p>

  <p>He took a good swallow of coffee. The girl was watching him with a
  peculiar anxiety. Silver watched him, too. Farrel was no lover of danger.
  That was clear. But he had two senses. One was of honor and one was of duty.
  They pinched and whitened his face, but at last he was able to lift his
  head.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said quietly to Silver. "I didn't see, at first, just what
  I was heading for. Now I see and I'll go through with it if I can."</p>

  <p>"You know the lay of the land," said Silver. "What ought we to do,
  Danny?"</p>

  <p>Farrel brushed his knuckles across his forehead and left three parallel
  streaks of white from the greatness of the pressure.</p>

  <p>He flung out a hand behind him, pointing north.</p>

  <p>"They'll scoop 'em all up and throw 'em into one of the two valleys," he
  declared. "They'll sweep 'em into the gap between the foothills of the Farrel
  Mountains and the hills below Mount Humphreys. Or else they'll drive through
  between the Humphreys Mountains and the Kendal Hills. That's the easiest
  way."</p>

  <p>Silver nodded. "After that?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Farrel slowly, as though he were willing to let his mind
  dwell on the details, "after that they'll have no trouble. They'll split the
  big herd into little sections and wind 'em through the mountains. You can
  depend upon it, if I'm right and they're ready to make their sale, somewhere
  up there in the mountains there are a lot of punchers ready to grab the herd
  for Sam Waring and push it away to markets that we don't know anything about.
  You could sprinkle ten million cows through those mountains and make it hard
  for anything but hawks to find 'em!"</p>

  <p>"That's what they'll do then," said Silver calmly. "I believe every word
  that you say. But what about the pair of us? What can we do to stop 'em?"</p>

  <p>Farrel stirred uneasily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at last, "I don't know. First, we'll have to spot the way
  they're taking. That means that we'll have to separate. You go to the head of
  the valley between Humphreys and Kendal. I'll go to the head of the valley
  between Humphreys and Farrel Mountain. The one who sees the drift of cattle
  coming can climb the high hill at the foot of Humphreys. Know that hill?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You'll spot it easily enough. It stands up like a spur, all by itself. A
  fire lighted on that hill can be seen in both valleys. It will be the call
  which tells the other fellow that he's wanted. And when the herd
  comes&mdash;and you and I are both together&mdash;well, then Heaven alone can
  tell what we'll be able to do!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE SIGNAL FIRE</h2>

  <p class="first">It was not so much the courage of Farrel that moved Silver,
  though it was a stirring thing to see the way the man drove his unwilling
  mind, as it was the strength of the girl. Not once did she falter.</p>

  <p>The horses had been cleared out of the big corral, as a matter of course,
  by the retiring men of Rutherford and Delgas. But there were others in more
  distant fields. Silver went out on Parade and daubed a rope on a
  strong-looking mustang that led its herd in the effort to escape but could
  not lead fast enough to run away from the devouring stride of Parade. He
  brought that horse back and saddled it while Farrel said good-by to the
  girl.</p>

  <p>She was as steady as a rock, saying good-by. Silver, when he took her
  hand, said:</p>

  <p>"You have to stay alone, here, and I know that's hard to do. You have to
  let Dan go with me. And that's harder still. You're a brick, and I'm not
  forgetting it."</p>

  <p>That was all. He made her no promises of reward because he felt that such
  talk would be an insult to a spirit like hers. Then he rode off at the side
  of Farrel. They were well-armed, well-mounted, and they had their wits about
  them. But as they got under way and as the outlines of the foothills drew
  nearer to them under the brightness of the moonlight, the thing looked more
  and more hopeless to Silver.</p>

  <p>Farrel drew up his horse presently and pointed off to the right.</p>

  <p>"That's your way, Jim," said he. "Ride up the valley there between the
  foothills. When you get to the head of it, you can wait. If my idea's right,
  those punchers are sweeping in the cows right now, out of the desert behind
  us. Once they get the herd together and start it rolling, it will move fast
  because these cows can run and keep on running like horses. They can be
  pushed like a big gang of mustangs. You'll hear 'em coming before you see
  'em, maybe. And when you hear 'em pointing up your valley, climb the hill
  that will be off to the side&mdash;you won't miss it&mdash;and light the
  fire. If I don't see the red of the fire in this moonlight, I'll spot the
  rising of the smoke. Is that all straight?"</p>

  <p>"That's all straight," said Silver. Then he added:</p>

  <p>"I'd very much like to know the top thing in your mind, right now."</p>

  <p>"Why," said Farrel, "I'm thinking about Steve Wycombe. Wherever he is, if
  he knows what's happening on earth, he must be laughing. See the way it's all
  working out for him! He split up his land among three men, and now he's got a
  first-rate chance that they'll cut each other's throats for the sake of his
  land. He's got a ten-to-one chance that you'll go down, anyway. And you're
  the one that bumped him off. Oh, Steve's laughing good and hard now, all
  right."</p>

  <p>Silver nodded. "Let him laugh," he murmured. "One chance in ten isn't bad,
  when the stakes run high. Every man bets on a long shot, now and then. That's
  the spice of life."</p>

  <p>Farrel stared back at him. Silver could feel the eyes under the black mask
  of shadow that fell across the forehead of his companion.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know one thing, Jim," said Farrel. "What's the top layer in
  your mind, just now?"</p>

  <p>"The white of Rutherford's face," said Silver instantly. "And the blue of
  the eyes of your girl. I hope that you get back to her. But&mdash;so long,
  Danny!"</p>

  <p>He shook hands with Farrel, and saw the puncher jog his mustang off to the
  left until it was out of sight beyond the first of the low-rolling hills that
  descended from the mighty knees of Mount Humphreys.</p>

  <p>It was a bitter business, and he wondered how he could be justified by any
  sense of higher right in allowing this man to ride into the danger. Yet
  something sure and strong in the nature of Silver told him that he was right.
  If all worked out as he faintly hoped it might, there would be a reward for
  his friend, and such a reward was worth working for.</p>

  <p>He kept telling himself that.</p>

  <p>A wolf howled from the hillside, unseen. The doleful sound roused Jim
  Silver to action. He spoke, and Parade stepped out into a trot, then into a
  long and sweeping gallop that started him up the wide mouth of the valley,
  with the hills walking slowly back behind him to either side.</p>

  <p>Nothing lived around him, and yet everything seemed at wait, the cactus
  with its black spot of shadow beside it, the crouching shapes of the hills
  themselves, and the narrow mouths of the ravines that opened ominously toward
  him as he went by. It was a moment not easy on the nerves; he wondered how
  big Dan Farrel was handling the thing.</p>

  <p>He thought of Steve Wycombe, too, who had planned his revenge on his
  enemies so cunningly, as he lay dying. Poison was usually put in food; this
  was poison placed in rich possessions. Truly Farrel was right, and the soul
  of Wycombe must be laughing at thought of the evil he had left behind him on
  earth.</p>

  <p>When Silver got up to the head of the valley, where the hills pinched
  together, he dismounted, let Parade graze on the dusty tufts of grass, here
  and there, and smoked a cigarette while he walked up and down.</p>

  <p>The night was perfectly still now. It seemed as though the slightest sound
  must necessarily trouble and dim the pure outline of the hills against the
  moonlight in the sky.</p>

  <p>He fell into a mood of absolute quiet. This sort of a time of stillness
  was, after all, nearer and dearer to him than anything else in life. Neither
  man nor woman could enter his heart so deeply. So he sat like a stone, only
  his eyes moving, as he heard Parade crop the grass with slight ripping noises
  like the tearing of bits of cloth.</p>

  <p>He had been there for a long time when, looking up the slope toward the
  isolated hill of which Farrel had spoken, he saw a red flower bloom in the
  steep shadow of a rock high above. He knew that it was the signal fire by
  which Dan Farrel was calling to him for help.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; A RECEPTION COMMITTEE</h2>

  <p class="first">Dan Farrel, when he trotted his horse away from Silver and
  up the shallow mouth of the valley that lay between the sprawling hills of
  the Farrel Mountains and those that descended from Mount Humphreys, felt with
  every beat of the mustang's right forefoot that he must rein the little horse
  around and return to tell Silver frankly: "I'm not in this game. I haven't
  the nerve. I can't do it. The cattle don't belong to me. The land doesn't
  belong to me. I'm out of the picture."</p>

  <p>That would have been talking the way he felt. And finally he swung the
  mustang sharply around only to find that the lower foothills from the
  Humphreys range had crawled between him and Silver. He was alone. With the
  moonlight gleaming in the desert dust, he seemed to be sitting in a thin,
  ground mist. The hammering of his heart made it hard for him to breathe; it
  was as though he were submerged in water.</p>

  <p>The air was warm enough. He knew that. And yet there was cold inside him.
  It seemed to come out of the moonlight and run into the marrow of his
  bones.</p>

  <p>"You're a yellow dog," he told himself.</p>

  <p>His throat worked on the words. He remembered how he had sat at the table,
  that night, and how Jim Silver had drawn guns to protect him.</p>

  <p>"You're a yellow dog!" he said, out loud.</p>

  <p>The bigness of his own voice amazed him. He turned his horse around and
  made it walk up the flat of the valley. As for fellows like Silver, why
  should they be praised for courage when, as a matter of fact, the God that
  made them had given them different nerves, different capacities? Does one
  praise a cat for its skill in catching a bird? No, one simply admires the
  delicate craftsmanship of nature which can bring foot and eye to such
  perfection. Does one eulogize the hawk that blows on an easy wing across the
  heavens?</p>

  <p>Then why should Silver be worshiped like a glorious thing when he was
  simply one of nature's special products, one of her fine elaborations? His
  eye was surer, his hand was swifter. He could take a fellow like that husky
  lad, Red, and paralyze him with a grip. At a single gesture he showed himself
  to be beyond the ken of ordinary people. And as a type of his superiority
  there was the horse he rode which, to other mustangs, was as an eagle to a
  crow. From the pursuit of Silver no man in open country could escape. From
  the pursuit of others, he could easily drift away.</p>

  <p>So Farrel kept telling himself over and over again that he was a fool,
  that he had no business trying to follow the seven-league strides of Jim
  Silver. And yet, all the while something inside him made him know that he
  would not give up this fight until bullets or blows had forced him out of
  it.</p>

  <p>He got up to the head of the valley, dismounted, threw the reins off the
  mustang, and started walking up and down. He was caught, he felt. He was
  enslaved by an idea, a sense of pride and duty. Was there not a story of the
  Roman sentinel who kept at his post as the city burned, simply because no
  orders had come relieving him? And he, Danny Farrel, was like that. He was
  being a blind and automatic machine. He would get no glory for it, only a
  hard-nosed bullet out of a Winchester to nudge the life out of him and turn
  him into food for buzzards.</p>

  <p>He looked up the slope of the signal hill, again and again, each time half
  expecting to see the fire. He was not sure that he would be able to spot the
  flame. It was perhaps only the dim shimmer of the smoke as it rose through
  the moonlight that he would be able to distinguish. Or would Silver light the
  fire in the shadow of a certain tall rock, so that the flames would look out
  with a redder eye?</p>

  <p>He walked up to the top of a low hummock from which he had a better view
  of the lower valley. He could look out onto the desert itself, which appeared
  as a thicker streak of mist in the distance.</p>

  <p>He came down again to the horse. There was a sudden bond between him and
  that roach-backed, ewe-necked gelding. He could remember it as a yearling, as
  a two-year-old. A good set of legs and a body that was like a question mark.
  Just an ordinary dull-witted, stubborn, headstrong, savage little animal, but
  now the pressure of fear brought Farrel close to the horse.</p>

  <p>The stock of the Winchester that protruded out of the saddle holster was
  another comfort like the face of a friend. He pulled the gun out, and after
  handling it a moment, he put it back inside the cover.</p>

  <p>If he had had any sense, he would have spent time every day practicing. He
  would have known that, sooner or later, his life might depend upon his
  marksmanship. He would have known that it was better to waste a few
  cartridges for half an hour a day than it was to come to a moment like this.
  He told himself that therein lay the difference, in part, between himself and
  men who got on in the world. Fellows like Delgas and Rutherford, for
  instance, were willing to practice their card tricks and their gun work for
  hours every free day. That meant that they were prepared when the pinches
  came, the golden opportunities which so often went hand in hand with terrible
  dangers.</p>

  <p>But as for himself, what was he, and what had he done? He was merely a
  growth from the soil and attached to it by a blind affection and yearning. He
  was a thing all root and no tree, like the twisted mesquite. And his labors
  had been given to riding herd, building fences, doctoring sick cows, tailing
  them out of mud-holes, keeping the night watch, singing to the dogies,
  breaking mean, down-headed horses, patching sheds. Why, when he died and went
  over the rim of things into the other world, the ghosts of real men would
  laugh at him when he tried to describe the still, strange beauty of the
  desert and the way the three mountains climbed up the northern sky.</p>

  <p>He sighed, and then went up to the top of the hummock from which he could
  look out to the desert. It was just the same with some difference that he
  could not spot, some small difference.</p>

  <p>Then, his mind clearing, he knew what the change was. The sheen of desert
  dust under the moon was no longer a low, thin streak. It rose much higher, as
  though a wind were blowing straight up the valley. But something more than
  the wind might cause the dust to rise.</p>

  <p>He looked up at the sky and studied the thin patches of clouds for a
  moment. No, there was no wind.</p>

  <p>So he hurried to his horse, with his heart beating very fast. Still, he
  must not merely guess, in this fashion. He must not call to Silver with an
  entirely false alarm.</p>

  <p>He threw himself down on the ground and pressed his ear to it. At first he
  thought that he could hear a distant sound, but finally he knew that it was
  only the rushing of the blood through the arteries of his head. That noise
  grew dim, disappeared. Then he could really listen and make out a subdued
  murmuring. No, it was a rhythm, a pulse, and nothing more. He lay there
  still, holding his breath, and strained every nerve.</p>

  <p>Then he distinguished it clearly&mdash;the noise of many, many hoofs
  trampling.</p>

  <p>He was on the back of the mustang in a moment, staring under the shadow of
  both hands. Now, clearly, he could see the rising of the dust. He thought
  that he could even make out the twistings of the upper layers of it as the
  herd entered the mouth of the valley. Perhaps, if the men riding point had
  sent out a scout well ahead, the puncher in the lead might not be far from
  him at that moment.</p>

  <p>But he gave only a casual glance to the floor of the valley about him.
  Anger such as he could hardly believe in himself was surging and rising in
  him. He cast a glance toward the mountains, and marked the jet-black, zigzag
  traceries of the innumerable canyons against the brightness of the smoother
  slopes. Once the herd reached that hole-in-the-wall country, pursuit would
  simply be ridiculous. And therefore, all the early work of his life would be
  wiped out. It would more than be wiped out. It would be cast into the hands
  of the two scoundrels, Delgas and Harry Rutherford.</p>

  <p>The heat of his anger dissolved all fear. He put the mustang at the slope,
  and the little horse went up the rough and graveled surface with perfect
  certainty, straining, throwing itself into its labor as though it perfectly
  understood.</p>

  <p>Right up toward the top they went until they reached that high rock which
  the glance of Farrel had picked out before this. There was plenty of brush
  for the kindling of a fire. However, he did not want a great deal. Even the
  smallest eye of red was likely to meet not only the eye of Silver, in the
  valley beneath, but also the attention of the men handling the herd, and on a
  night like this they would be on edge with nervous suspicions.</p>

  <p>The brush was tough sage. He tore up some small bushes. The wood resisted
  his hands when he stripped off the branches. However, he rapidly made a small
  pile. The leaves which he had shaken off he swept together in a heap, and put
  a match to them. The flame caught in them. There was a crinkling sound. The
  red of the fire disappeared. A thickening white smoke went up. The breath of
  it was pungent and sweet to him. It reminded him of a thousand open camp
  fires that he had kindled before this, but never had he struck a match that
  might lead to what would follow now!</p>

  <p>The flame burst up through the center of the leaves in a small volcanic
  eruption of red. He put on little branches of the sage. It burned with a
  greasy crackling. He put on the larger brush. He stood back and watched the
  red flower bloom in the shadow of the rock.</p>

  <p>He had built it right on the farther edge of this little shoulder, yet it
  seemed to him that the feeble glow of the flame could not possibly walk so
  far through the moonlight as to come to the eyes of Jim Silver, in the valley
  beneath.</p>

  <p>He could see that valley. Yes, and now he thought that he could see
  Silver, far away. A moment later, he was certain. He could not spot man and
  horse so well, but he was sure of the shadows which they cast on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Now, as he watched, the man mounted, and began to move straight up the
  slope toward him. Relief in a warm wave swept through the body and the brain
  of Dan Farrel. To be alone on such a night was terrible, but to be with such
  a man as Jim Silver would be exciting, almost glorious, perhaps.</p>

  <p>He knew, as he stared down at the climbing form, that he had made no
  mistake&mdash;that he would never regret having ridden out on this night to
  fight for the herd. Then he thought of Esther and how she had let him go,
  willingly enough. People like Esther, he felt, always are right. They know
  how to pick between the easy way and the way of honor and duty and just
  pride.</p>

  <p>After that, he muttered aloud: "Good old Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>Something jammed into the small of his back as he stood shaking his head
  with a new-found affection.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said the voice of Delgas. "He'll be good and old, before very
  long. Come here, Red. Fan this bird and get his guns. We're goin' to be a
  reception committee, son. Because that's Jim Silver that's climbin' his horse
  up the way!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE AMBUSH</h2>

  <p class="first">Farrel was backed up from the edge of the little plateau. If
  they could see Silver, it was just possible that Silver might be able to spot
  them. Red stood in front of Farrel and laughed.</p>

  <p>"What a simp you are, Danny!" said he. "Why didn't you turn around and
  look behind you, a couple of times?"</p>

  <p>It was strange to Farrel that he felt neither fear nor shame. There had
  been only a blinding moment of terror when the voice first spoke behind him,
  but now he could look steadily into the eyes of Red. He had always known the
  fellow was little good.</p>

  <p>"I'm not clever at this sort of work," said Farrel. "I've never spent much
  time with crooks."</p>

  <p>Red had just taken Farrel's Colt. Now he laid the barrel suddenly along
  the head of Farrel and knocked him staggering.</p>

  <p>"Quit that, you fool!" exclaimed Delgas. "We don't want any noise up here.
  The first thing you know, Silver will hear something. He's got ears like a
  cat. That's what he is&mdash;a cat!"</p>

  <p>Delgas was tying the hands of Farrel behind his back. Red, tying a double
  knot in a big silk bandanna that he folded across, suddenly thrust it between
  the teeth of Farrel. It made an efficient gag.</p>

  <p>"He won't do any yelling to warn Silver. Not just now," said Red.</p>

  <p>"Good work," answered Delgas. "You've got a brain, kid. We can use you,
  maybe&mdash;Rutherford and me."</p>

  <p>"Jake with me," answered Red. "You know how it is. There ain't any use in
  punching cows. Ever seen an old cow-puncher? What becomes of 'em, then? They
  fade away, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"They do," agreed Delgas. "The way of it is like this: Those that have got
  the coin keep it. The poor stiffs that try to work up, they're just playin'
  into the hands of the millionaire. There's something in the Bible, even,
  about that. About them that have the goods are going to get the extras,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and I've seen it, and I've read it," said Red.</p>

  <p>He stepped cautiously across the face of the rock to peer down at the
  progress of Silver.</p>

  <p>"It'll take him a minute," muttered Red. "It's a steep path, and even
  Parade can't fly that slope. They gotta zigzag up the face of it."</p>

  <p>"Sit down," ordered Delgas. "Sit down and rest yourself, kid."</p>

  <p>Farrel sat down with his back to the rock.</p>

  <p>"What about putting the fire out?" asked Red.</p>

  <p>"Sure," agreed Delgas. "That'll make Silver think that Farrel sees him
  comin'."</p>

  <p>Red kicked the fire over the ground. The flames stopped dancing; a broader
  smudge arose.</p>

  <p>The two sat on their heels and waited.</p>

  <p>Delgas began to utter his philosophy. "A gent with a bean," he said, "is a
  gent that knows how to make the easy money. Anybody knows that. And where
  does the easy money lie? Why, it lies in the other fellow's pocket. And how
  are you goin' to get it out? By talkin', by turnin' a key, or by usin' a gun.
  Those are the three ways. There ain't any others. A kid like you, Red, could
  learn a lot. You could learn to crack a safe, do some confidence steerin',
  and pack a gun for the pinches."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said Red. "A fellow just has to learn his line. That's all. I
  guess Rutherford has a line, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Thing to listen to," said Delgas, "is that smooth little devil talkin'
  his way into the confidence of a female. That's where he shines. With a
  flower in his buttonhole and a hard hat on his head, and with a walkin' stick
  in his hand and a shine of his shoes, doggone me if it don't do your heart
  good to see the way he walks right into the heart of a girl. He's slick, is
  what he is. Understand? He's as slick as they make 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, yeah," muttered Red eagerly. "Wouldn't I like to hear him work,
  though? Maybe I could do something with the ladies myself. I ain't such a bad
  hand."</p>

  <p>"It's the way he's got of saying the simple things. That's what counts
  with the females," said Delgas. "You take a woman, they ain't never got
  more'n the half of a brain in their head. Kind of nutty and foolish. You
  can't argue with 'em none. You gotta let 'em have their own way or else just
  sock 'em and let 'em drop. Or else you gotta make love to 'em. That's where
  Harry shines. He's gotta brain, is what he's got."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, he's got a brain," agreed Red, grinning and gaping with
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"Lemme tell you another thing," said Delgas. "A great dodge of Harry's is
  bein' a recovered consumptive. A lunger that's gone and got well, and he's a
  millionaire, you see, and he wants to contribute a lot of money to make a big
  resort where other lungers can go and get well. That's the line he uses in
  some small town in the Southwest. Anywhere in the Southwest. He gets the
  whole town all boiled up. He's goin' to build a great big hotel. He's goin'
  to bring business and lungers on the jump into the place.</p>

  <p>"The storekeepers and the ranchers and everybody chips in and raises a
  nice lot of money. All they gotta do is to deposit as much as the check that
  Harry puts into the hands of the treasurer of the company, and while Harry's
  just put in a check, the rest of 'em put in cash. Y'understand? They put in
  cash and when they've got in the fifteen or twenty thousand dollars which is
  to show that the town is behind the big idea and willing to help on the
  street improvements and all of that, then one night the treasurer and Harry
  disappear, and the town has to sit on its heels and cuss."</p>

  <p>Red chuckled softly. "You been the treasurer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I been the treasurer," said Delgas. "Doggone me if I don't laugh
  till I cry, when I think about some of Harry's stunts. He's gotta brain, is
  what he's got."</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Red. "Whatcha mean by talkin' all these things over in
  front of Danny?"</p>

  <p>"Why," said Delgas, "I got an idea that maybe Danny ain't goin' to live to
  talk. I got an idea that maybe he'll be lyin' out here mum as a stone, before
  very long. I just want Harry's O.K. on the job."</p>

  <p>Even Red winced a little at this suggestion.</p>

  <p>"You're going to&mdash;knock him right over the head?" he asked
  huskily.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and what difference would that make to you? Is he your long-lost
  brother, or something like that?" asked Delgas, sneering.</p>

  <p>"No, no," muttered Red. "Only&mdash;well, what Rutherford decides is all
  right with me."</p>

  <p>"He don't go in for the red-handed stuff," agreed Delgas. "Harry is
  gentle&mdash;except when he makes up his mind to be the other thing. What
  Harry says is that it's a dumb play to go and collect scalps when what you
  want is wallets. If somebody's gotta be sunk, he'll lay 'em colder'n a stone,
  all right. But he dodges the trouble. He's that way. He dodges the blood. And
  I don't blame him. It gets people stirred up when they find blood on the
  trail. They don't like it. They begin to raise posses. Posses ain't so hard
  to handle but sometimes they make a little trouble."</p>

  <p>"It was a posse that grabbed me and threw me in the can," observed Red
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You were only a kid and didn't know how to handle yourself," suggested
  Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I was only a kid. I hadn't gone to college, at that time. But now
  that I'm a graduate from the pen, you can bet that I'm wiser. Only, I took a
  whirl at trying to go straight, till you and Harry come along and showed me
  that I was making a fool of myself."</p>

  <p>"Gents like Rutherford and me, that uses the bean, we don't sit down and
  take a kick in the face," declared Delgas. "We stand up and kick somebody
  else."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, you do, and you get away with it," said Red, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>He began to look with open eyes at Delgas, a sign that his mind was as
  open as a summer's day, also.</p>

  <p>"It's better to kick than to be kicked," said Red.</p>

  <p>"Ain't it, though?" agreed Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said Red.</p>

  <p>Over the edge of the hill, Farrel heard the clank of an iron-shod hoof
  against a stone.</p>

  <p>"He's comin' closer," said Delgas. "Listen, kid. This is the greatest
  chance that you ever had in your life."</p>

  <p>"You mean you ain't goin' to take a try at him?" asked Red quickly.</p>

  <p>"Sure I'm goin' to take a try at him. We're both goin' to take a try,"
  said Delgas. "But there's enough glory in bumping off Silver to spread thick
  on two slices, lemme tell you. We're goin' to be known, from now on, as the
  birds that killed Silvertip. People are goin' to say: 'There goes the birds
  that bumped off Jim Silver. Those are the ones that killed Arizona Jim.'
  We're goin' to be pointed out. Understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Sure," said Red. "But he ain't dead yet."</p>

  <p>"He's goin' to be dead. Now listen to me. When we sneak up to the edge of
  the hill, yonder, poke your head over dead easy. Understand? And have your
  rifle out in front of you. And what you shoot at is the hoss."</p>

  <p>"Parade?" said Red. "Morrie, you wouldn't take and kill the finest hoss in
  the world, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up and don't argue," said Delgas, drawing out a pair of Colts from
  which the sights and triggers had been filed away. "I know best. The job that
  we got is to bring him down and kill him. And the first stir of anything,
  that stallion is goin' to jump twenty feet sideways. He's that way. The
  reason that Silver has got through so many tight holes is mostly that Parade
  is eyes and ears for him, and a jumpin' fool of a jack-in-the-box, besides.
  He can smell trouble a mile off down wind, too.</p>

  <p>"No, kill that stallion, and Silver is half dead right then. You use your
  rifle. Make sure. Shoot straight. I'm goin' to use a Colt because I'm sort of
  more used to it, and if I miss at a cinch of a target like that, call me an
  old woman and slap my face for me!"</p>

  <p>He put down his left-hand gun not far from the feet of Dan Farrel and
  began to do something to his other Colt.</p>

  <p>"It's time!" said Red.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," commanded Delgas. "Don't rush it. We wanta get there to
  the ledge just at the right second. I'll tell you when to start. My ears are
  measurin' the sound and the distance like a tape. I'll tell you when."</p>

  <p>He went on: "You gotta learn to fan a gun, kid, and I'm goin' to teach
  you. It turns loose the bullets like drops of water out of a hose. Now shut
  up and don't talk. He's too near. And the stallion can hear like a telephone
  receiver."</p>

  <p>So they crouched there, hushed.</p>

  <p>Dan Farrel, tied, gagged so that he could hardly breathe, listened to the
  frantic bumping of his heart. He was wet with sweat. It trickled from his
  forehead and ran into his helpless eyes. But he saw neither of the men before
  him clearly; rather he was seeing the big head and shoulders of Silver,
  swaying a little against the moonlight as Parade carried him lightly up the
  slope&mdash;a perfect target black against the moonlight! One uproar of guns
  and one thudding of bullets, and that would be the end of him.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Farrel like the fall of mountains. He thought of Parade and
  the death of the great horse was even more impossible than the death of the
  man. But life can be let out by the prick of a pin. Somewhere he had found
  that&mdash;in a church or in a book.</p>

  <p>He wondered if, by a great effort, he could make around the gag some sort
  of a strangling noise that might be a sufficient warning for Silver. But he
  knew that he could not manage it. His will was right. He felt that he was
  willing to die if he could send the message to the man who rode so helplessly
  into ambush. But he could do nothing.</p>

  <p>He twisted in agony, and one foot touched the Colt which had been laid on
  the ground by Delgas. The electric spark of an idea leaped instantly through
  his brain. For the hair-trigger weapon was set so that the merest flick of
  the thumb on the hammer would discharge it, and if he could get his toe on
  the hammer for an instant&mdash;</p>

  <p>Vaguely he saw Red begin to crawl forward, easing the rifle along the
  ground, moving like a great hunting beast. And over the edge of the hill he
  distinctly heard the clattering fall of a stone which Parade had
  dislodged.</p>

  <p>The rider was close now. Soon he would be looming above the ledge.</p>

  <p>"Now!" whispered Delgas to Red, and reached a hand for the Colt he had put
  down.</p>

  <p>Farrel could not be sure that he would accomplish his purpose. He could
  only reach out rather blindly and flick back his toe. He felt no resistance
  more than a mere scratch against the sole of his boot, but a deep explosion
  boomed instantly in his ear. He had touched the hammer by the grace of
  chance!</p>

  <p>He saw Delgas turn on him like a tiger; he heard the startled snort and
  plunge of the horse that could not be seen. Then Red had risen to his feet
  and run forward. On the verge of the ledge, big against the moonlight sky,
  Red leveled his rifle from the shoulder and fired.</p>

  <p>Delgas was instantly beside him, turning loose a stream of bullets.</p>

  <p>Both stopped shooting. To look at the dead bodies tumbling down the
  slope?&mdash;wondered Farrel. No, for Delgas was exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"Wait&mdash;when he comes out from behind the rock&mdash;steady&mdash;get
  your bead to the right. I'll watch the left&mdash;now&mdash;now!"</p>

  <p>And again the guns boomed.</p>

  <p>Delgas began to spring up and down, cursing. He threw his empty gun on the
  ground. His yells of rage were like the howling of a beast. But Red, rifle at
  the ready, was still peering at the distance, trying to get in a final
  shot.</p>

  <p>Farrel took a great breath. Death would be easy to face, he felt, for he
  had done enough to make his life worthwhile.</p>

  <p>Then Delgas turned and rushed snarling back at him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE HERD</h2>

  <p class="first">Delgas meant murder. The moon was behind his head, but
  enough of his features showed to let Farrel see the twist and stretch of
  them, and the catfish gape of his grin. The big fellow took Farrel by the
  throat. He could not even curse. He could only gasp with the completeness of
  his rage. With the butt of a revolver he offered to beat Farrel over the
  head, then to bash in his face.</p>

  <p>He could not make a choice when the rifle of Red cracked again and Delgas
  dropped Farrel flat and ran back to see what had happened.</p>

  <p>"I've got him!" yelled Red. "I've got him! Oh, no, he's gone! He's gone.
  He's made of moonshine, Delgas. Bullets just slide right through him and
  don't do no harm."</p>

  <p>"He'll moonshine you when he lays his hands on you!" said Morris Delgas.
  "He'll show you what moonshine can do, you flathead! What you got a rifle
  for? What you good for, you four-flusher, you fake of a wooden Injun?"</p>

  <p>Red gradually straightened under the pouring of the abuse. At last he
  said: "That's about enough out of your trap, Delgas."</p>

  <p>"It's enough, is it?" shouted Delgas. "I'll show you what's enough! I'm
  goin' to see what's inside you! I'm goin' to take a look at your lining!"</p>

  <p>He put his great grasp on Red, who slid one hand behind him as if to get
  at a knife. For a moment, they faced each other. Then Delgas cursed and took
  his hands away from Red.</p>

  <p>"I oughta eat your heart," he vowed, "but it'd be that much the better for
  the skunk that's lyin' yonder laughin' at us! It'd be fine for him if we
  choked each other and rolled down the slope here and bashed our heads in.
  Wouldn't that be slick for him?"</p>

  <p>"I done the best shootin' I could," said Red. "But that hoss was
  maneuverin' all the time like a snipe flyin' down wind. There wasn't no
  regularity about nothin' he did. He didn't keep to no straight lines, the
  fool. You seen that for yourself, Delgas. You had a pretty close shot at him,
  but you couldn't hit him."</p>

  <p>"It was Farrel that give him a couple of winks of head start," argued
  Delgas. "The shootin' off of the gun was what started that hawk flyin', and
  two flaps takes a bird like that a long ways. Red, I'm sorry I started in to
  manhandle you. It wasn't your fault. But for a second, all I could think of
  was that Jim Silver had been inside our hands&mdash;and that we let him
  slip!"</p>

  <p>"I know," said Red. "I know how you feel. Don't I feel the same way,
  though? It's hell, is all that it is!"</p>

  <p>They went back to Farrel and stood over him. The hands of Morris Delgas
  worked at his sides. They looked to Farrel like the jaws of two fish biting
  at the air. He kicked Farrel in the ribs.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>The pain of the bruised flesh sickened Farrel. The weight of the blow made
  it difficult for him to breathe, but he got slowly to his feet. He realized
  that the least hesitation might hasten his time of dying.</p>

  <p>So he stood and confronted the pair of them. And suddenly, Delgas reached
  out and removed the bandanna that gagged Farrel.</p>

  <p>"You done the noble thing, didn't you?" asked Delgas. "Hey? It was noble,
  wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Farrel said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Answer me!" shouted Delgas. "You was being noble, wasn't you?"</p>

  <p>Farrel said nothing. He saw Delgas swing back a fist and how the punch
  traveled right at his head. He had an idea that he might be able to duck the
  blow, but if he avoided it, he was reasonably sure that he would be murdered.
  It was what Delgas wanted&mdash;the least additional excuse so that he would
  not be killing a helpless man in cold blood. So Farrel stood still and let
  the fist strike him in the face.</p>

  <p>Once he had been struck down when the massive shoulder of a hay wagon
  nudged him. The fist of Delgas was like that. It seemed to be faced with
  brass and to have a ton of driving weight behind it. It took him right off
  his feet and slammed him down on the back of his head. He could hear the
  whack of the fist against his flesh as though two hands had been clapped
  together. Afterward, he heard his head pound solidly against the rock.</p>

  <p>When his wits cleared, a second later, the left side of his face was numb,
  with liquid trickling over the skin, tickling it. Then he realized that his
  cheek bone had been laid open and the blood was running down from that.</p>

  <p>Big Morris Delgas got him by the hair of his head and jerked him to a
  sitting posture. He swung back his other fist.</p>

  <p>"I asked you, was you being noble?" shouted Delgas. "I asked you was you a
  dirty hound that was being noble, shooting a gun by a kick of your foot,
  giving Jim Silver warning. I asked you was you a dirty rat, a dirty noble
  rat? Was you?"</p>

  <p>He kept jerking the head of Farrel back and forth, and his right hand
  oscillated with terrible eagerness to beat again into the face of the
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>Red broke in suddenly: "Aw, back up, Delgas. Let him be."</p>

  <p>Delgas dropped Dan Farrel and whirled about.</p>

  <p>"You want something?" he yelled.</p>

  <p>Red had backed up a little. He had his hand behind him again, and Farrel
  could see how the fingers were looped over the handle of a knife. He seemed
  to mean business, though he kept on backing up, slowly, before the truculent
  advance of Delgas.</p>

  <p>"I won't take water from you, Delgas," he said.</p>

  <p>"You're butting in, you fool!" shouted Delgas, wavering with the wind of
  his fury. "You're butting in and you're tryin' to tell me what's what. I'm
  goin' to smash you!"</p>

  <p>Red kept on backing up, more and more slowly.</p>

  <p>"I won't take water from nobody," he said.</p>

  <p>He stood still, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I won't take water from you, Delgas," he said.</p>

  <p>His hand came around from the small of his back. The moonlight winked
  along the blade of the sharpened steel.</p>

  <p>Delgas strode close and measured himself against Red. He was so big that
  he had only to throw out his arms in order to embrace the smaller man. The
  whole body of Delgas worked in his passion, just as the entire body of a vast
  cat might work, as it sharpens its claws.</p>

  <p>"You poor fool," said Delgas, "d'you think your toad sticker can stop
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think nothing," said Red. "I just think that I won't take water
  from nobody."</p>

  <p>"I got a mind to bash your head in," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"All right. I guess you're big enough to bash me," said Red, "but you
  gotta prove it. I ain't taking water from nobody."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you, kid?" demanded Delgas. "Are you nutty or
  something? What you butting in for?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care about him," said Red. "You can take and drill him through
  the head, for all I care, or open him up with a knife, and it's Jake with me.
  But I hate you to be beating up a bird that can't lift his hands."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you? You ain't takin' the socks, are you?" asked
  Delgas.</p>

  <p>"I dunno. It sort of makes me sick," said Red.</p>

  <p>Delgas laughed. "You are funny," he said. "That is what you are. You're
  just a funny hombre. I bang him in the mug and you take and get sick. You're
  just a funny hombre, is what you are, Red."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Red. "I can't help it."</p>

  <p>"Sure you can't help it, if you're built that way," said Delgas. "Besides,
  I dunno that it's a good idea to smear up this gent too much. Maybe it's
  better to wait till Harry Rutherford has a look at him. Harry might have some
  ideas about the way to handle him, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Sure he might," agreed Red. "Now you're talking, old son. We'll get him
  back to Rutherford, down yonder, and see what Harry has to say about
  him."</p>

  <p>Delgas nodded. He concluded the argument on which the life of Farrel had
  depended by saying: "He thought he was being noble, was what made me sore.
  Reaching out and shooting the gun to warn his friend&mdash;you know, kind of
  being noble and giving himself away to the Injuns for the sake of his
  partner&mdash;you know, regular story stuff. That was what made me sick, him
  playing noble, like that. That's why I asked him was he trying to be noble.
  If he'd said yes, I would 'a' bashed him to a pulp!"</p>

  <p>They mounted Farrel on his horse, tying its lead rope to the pommel of
  Delgas's saddle, after the other two climbed on their own horses, which had
  been left a little down the slope. And Farrel found himself looking down to a
  great wave of turmoil that swept up through the valley gradually.</p>

  <p>Over it, a great billowing mist came up in waves. There seemed to be no
  wind, and yet the dust kept on rising. The acrid taint of it began to stain
  the air around Farrel. He could look down into the thin fog and see through
  it the swaying, pouring multitudes of the herd. Right across the valley they
  spread.</p>

  <p>They moved as a front of water moves. Sometimes a pressure of some sort
  caused one section to roll swiftly out ahead of the rest of the front, and
  then that section was delayed, as though the dry sands were drinking up the
  current, and another portion of the front lurched into the lead. Waves like
  those of water passed through the herd, also; vague perturbations and
  disturbances of the living mass. And the clatter and rattle of the clashing
  hoofs and the striking horns beat up to Farrel like a vast cymbal chorus,
  while the calves bawled high and the bulls roared low.</p>

  <p>And he was the maker of that great herd. He could remember the day when he
  talked to old Wycombe, that cunning fox who had been the father of the dead
  man. He had said: "Mr. Wycombe, I'm fifteen. That's why I'm willing to start
  small and work big. You wait and see. I know the right sort of a steer to run
  on this sort of land. I can breed 'em, and I can buy 'em, too. I know beef as
  I know the flat of my own hand."</p>

  <p>Old Wycombe had listened, and smiled, and listened. That was the day
  Farrel began to be a slave to an idea, and to the Wycombe family, and finally
  he had built up his herd, in actual fact. The size of it seemed to be
  magnified by the moonlight. It was flooding through his heart and soul. The
  mountains seemed to be trembling with the thunder of the multitude. He kept
  on saying to himself soundlessly: "I did all of that. I raised that herd. And
  now it's going to be wasted. Now it's going to be wasted."</p>

  <p>Big Delgas, reining close to him, said: "Your face is all swelling up,
  kid. I'm sorry that I socked you like that. But you made me sore. It makes me
  sore to see a gent trying to be noble. It makes me mad, is all it does."</p>

  <p>Farrel shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He's thinking about the beef. He's not thinking about himself," remarked
  Red, with a touch of both curiosity and of sympathy in his voice.</p>

  <p>"What you mean, he's thinking about the beef?" said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Down there," said Red, gesturing. "He's not so sorry for the beating he
  got, but he's sorry to see his herd break up."</p>

  <p>"He never owned no part of it," answered Degas.</p>

  <p>"He built it, brother, is what I mean," said Red. "You gotta understand
  how you'd feel if you'd built something and seen it go smash."</p>

  <p>"Like a toy house. I know," said Delgas. "My big brother built a kind of a
  toy house, one day. I come along and took and give it a shove, and it goes in
  a pile. Was he sore? He was sore, lemme tell you. He up and after me. And I
  went high-tailin' through the house and outside, and he took and made a high
  dive off the back porch and caught me, and then did he pretty near kill me?
  I'll tell a man he done just that. He was kind of sore because I'd spilled
  his house. But this guy is funny, that wants to cry when he sees his herd
  break up&mdash;his herd that he don't own no hair of."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Farrel found himself, quite outside of his own expectations,
  making an explanation.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you had a big stretch of land," he said. "Suppose you have a big
  stock of water behind a dam. Feed it out slow, and you've got water for the
  whole year through. Bust the dam, and it's all gone in a day, and the ranch
  is thrown away. That's the way I feel. Those cows are going to spill away
  through the hills and split up into a hundred different sections. Who's
  buying them? Sam Waring?"</p>

  <p>The heads of both Red and Delgas jerked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Never mind who's buying them," said Delgas. "Worry about the coin that's
  comin' into your own pocket, not what's comin' into mine!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; SAM WARING</h2>

  <p class="first">They talked for a moment as to which end of the herd they
  should aim at&mdash;the rear of it or the point. Because the cattle were not
  being pushed ahead into the mountains. There was no very great hurry, for
  that matter, and, since the herding by daylight would be more assured work
  than herding them by night, perhaps the herd would be kept here until close
  to daylight, which was not very far off in any event.</p>

  <p>Finally it was decided to go down the slope to the point of the herd,
  where it was held by several riders at the head of the valley. They descended
  rapidly, and, coming out into the open, they were assailed by angry cries
  that ordered them to get to work. The punchers were working short-handed, in
  trying to hold that confused mob of steers. But one puncher, coming near
  enough to identify faces, raised a whoop of exctied triumph at the sight of
  Farrel. He went off, waving his hat in circles and yelling like a wolf.</p>

  <p>"Your punchers don't seem to think much of you, kid," said Delgas,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>Farrel made no answer. Now that he was at close range, even through the
  rolling and thick, fog-white outpouring of the dust, he could recognize steer
  and cow and calf that he had handled himself. And he ran his eyes with a
  strange love over the long shanks of the cattle, and the straight, lean
  bellies, and the high, lean backs. No sign of roaching in those backs, and no
  sign of weakness in the quarters. They were built like deer. They could move
  to forage. They could run a whole day for water after they had lived on dry
  feed for two days.</p>

  <p>That line of cattle was not his discovery. The Spanish had bred it in a
  small version centuries before; the Texans had bred it big in more recent
  times; but he knew the particular brand and type that suited this special bit
  of desert range. He knew it like a book, and he had made it. Now it was to
  go. It was to pour away through the mountain canyons and be dissipated like
  water running through a sieve. He turned his head away. He could not face the
  wretched thought of all that wasted labor.</p>

  <p>He knew now, suddenly, that a man lives not for the sake of putting hard
  cash into his own pocket, but for the sake of some sort of creation&mdash;a
  store, a poem, a herd of cows. It was all the same. To build up something
  where there was nothing before&mdash;that was the feeling that drove decent
  men. And now, in stealing the herd, they were stealing a portion of his life
  that could never be returned to him. The dollars could go to the devil. But
  time is more priceless, and it was time which they would be wasting.</p>

  <p>Delgas aimed for a flicker of firelight that was visible at the very point
  of the valley, where the foot of a hill was splintered into a great
  shagginess of rocks. When they drew closer to the firelight, a man stood up,
  and they saw the sheen of the long barrel of a rifle.</p>

  <p>This fellow, who seemed to be a guard, sang out:</p>

  <p>"Yeah? Yeah? Which way, waddies?"</p>

  <p>"Delgas speakin'!" called Delgas.</p>

  <p>"That don't mean nothin' to me," said the other.</p>

  <p>"One of the others," said Red. He added loudly: "Is Rutherford
  around?"</p>

  <p>"Rutherford is here," said the puncher with the rifle. "If that means much
  to you, he's here and he's busy."</p>

  <p>"Take this hombre," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>He dismounted, threw the reins of his horse to Red, and walked ahead.
  After a few words with the guard, he called for the others to come, and Red
  led in Farrel to the verge of the rocks.</p>

  <p>The fire was blazing merrily behind them. A pair of unshaven fellows had
  drawn off portions of the main blaze, and on these smaller fires they were
  frying bacon and bringing coffee to a boil. The scent of the food was good in
  the nostrils of Farrel. He told himself that he would remember
  this&mdash;that even in the midst of misery he was able to feel hunger and
  desire food as though he had simply come to the end of a long, hard,
  successful day's work.</p>

  <p>Tethered close by, here and there, stood several good-looking horses, and
  a mule whose pack was being unloaded.</p>

  <p>"Go easy with that pack, you fool!" sang out a voice.</p>

  <p>"There's dynamite in that!"</p>

  <p>Everyone raised a shout at the word.</p>

  <p>Rutherford alone did not stir. He was sitting cross-legged in front of a
  flat slab of rock, counting out stacks of greenbacks and weighing them down,
  one after another, with stones. Beside him stood the big, rounded paunch and
  the fat face of Sam Waring, crook extraordinary.</p>

  <p>After the confusion caused by the word about dynamite had died down,
  Delgas came close up and leaned over Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"We've got Danny Farrel," he said. "We nearly got Silver, too."</p>

  <p>"You nearly got hell," said Rutherford, without looking up, continuing his
  count.</p>

  <p>"Farrel was signaling him," said Delgas. "We waited, and Silver came right
  up the hill, but Farrel managed to kick the hammer of my gun, and the shot
  scared Silver away like a wild duck."</p>

  <p>"You talking about Arizona Jim? You talking about Jim Silver?" demanded
  Waring, shifting the butt of his cigar rapidly across his wide mouth.</p>

  <p>"That's the hombre," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"I don't want any part of him!" said Sam Waring hastily.</p>

  <p>He threw out both hands in a great gesture to emphasize his point.</p>

  <p>"I don't want any part in him at all!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"I told you he was on deck," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"You told me you'd have him under cover," answered Waring.</p>

  <p>"The fool ought to be," said Rutherford. "We left him under cover, and he
  should have stayed there; but&mdash;well, I've felt in my bones that I'd have
  it out with him, before long."</p>

  <p>"Have it out with him by yourself," remarked Waring. "I don't want any
  part of him. He's 'Mr. Silver,' and 'your honor,' and anything he wants, so
  far as I'm concerned."</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Waring," said Rutherford. "You're not going to pull out
  because of Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>"If I'd known he was to be on the loose," said Waring, "I'd never 'a'
  worked into this here deal. I'm a peaceable man. I don't want any hell for
  pepper in my soup, thanks. I'm no fightin' man, Rutherford, and you know
  it."</p>

  <p>"You've got plenty of thugs along to do your fighting for you," said
  Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"I'm an old man," answered Waring, who looked about fifty by the gray of
  his hair and the lines in his face. "But there's still a mite of life in me,
  and I don't want to drain it out. One small bullet hole will let a million
  dollars' worth run out and go to waste in half a second, brother. And I know
  it."</p>

  <p>Something else took the attention of Waring, a moment later, and, before
  any one could comment on his last speech, he pointed silently at Farrel.</p>

  <p>"That! Who brought that man in here?" said Waring.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with him?" asked Delgas.</p>

  <p>"He's not in on the deal!" exclaimed Waring. "What are you fellows trying
  to do? Advertise me in the newspapers?"</p>

  <p>He was very excited, and began to beat a fist into the fat palm of his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Keep your hat on," advised Delgas. "He ain't goin' to do you no
  harm."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Sam?" asked Farrel.</p>

  <p>"It's Danny Farrel," said Waring, "and he knows me as well as I'd know my
  own father. You fellows are crazy loons! Why'd you bring him in here,
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>Rutherford looked up from his counting.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he knows too much, anyway, before he saw you. If he knows too much,
  maybe we'll have to make him forget it, Sam."</p>

  <p>"What you mean?" asked Waring.</p>

  <p>Rutherford slid a forefinger, slowly, across his scrawny neck.</p>

  <p>"Oh," groaned Waring, "do we have to have that kind of dirty work?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" said Delgas. "It's your laundry that we're wor-ryin' about,
  Sam."</p>

  <p>Waring snapped his fat fingers high above his head. He was very
  impatient.</p>

  <p>"It's a bad business," he said.</p>

  <p>"Worse for Farrel than for you," added Delgas.</p>

  <p>Waring turned his back and began to walk up and down, puffing rapidly at
  his cigar until a veil of white formed about his head, and he kept striding
  back and forth through it, making gestures of protest and annoyance.</p>

  <p>Rutherford continued his counting, laying small stones on the heaps that
  he put out on the rock.</p>

  <p>"That's a lot of kale you been carrying around with you, Waring," observed
  Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Cash is better than carry," said Waring shortly.</p>

  <p>He stopped in his pacing and pointed at Farrel.</p>

  <p>"Something's gotta be done," he said.</p>

  <p>"Do it yourself, then. I guess that nobody would stop you," said Delgas.
  "I don't love him none. My knuckles are what cut him up, the poor
  sucker."</p>

  <p>"Come out with it," urged Rutherford. "You want him bumped off now,
  Waring?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said Waring. "Let's think it over. Maybe something can be
  done with him."</p>

  <p>The heart of Farrel, which had turned to ice, began to beat again.</p>

  <p>"Get that canvas sack away from the fire!" suddenly shouted some one.
  "That's the dynamite, you fools!"</p>

  <p>The man who was carrying the tarpaulin almost dropped it, and when he had
  lowered it to the ground, he jumped a rod.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say so before?" he yelled. "I got a good mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You got a good mind to back up, and that's what you're goin' to do," said
  an unshaven brute, swaying to his feet from beside the fire.</p>

  <p>Waring turned and raised one hand.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he commenced. "Brick, take that dynamite back from the fire."</p>

  <p>"Brick," who had just risen ready for fight, snarled under his breath, but
  he picked up the tarpaulin and carried it to a crevice between two of the
  rocks.</p>

  <p>"The point is," said Waring, "that we've got this fellow Farrel on our
  hands, and Jim Silver ready to poison us somewhere in the open, loose and
  freehanded! Silver's enough to have on the mind. And you have to tell me if
  Farrel can be handled."</p>

  <p>"He can't be handled," said Rutherford, still counting. "He's one of the
  fools who prefer to be honest if they have to die for it."</p>

  <p>"He's the kind of a fool," broke in Delgas, "that wants to do something
  noble. That's the kind that he is."</p>

  <p>And Farrel knew that he was listening to his death sentence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A COOL BIRD</h2>

  <p class="first">One man more than those who could be counted around the fire
  had heard the last speech. That was Jim Silver, who had fled from the warning
  sound of the shot as he rode toward the signal smoke, and who had rounded
  through the upper shoulder of Mount Humphreys and come down again toward the
  face of the herd that was now in full view, sweeping into the valley.</p>

  <p>Farrel was gone, that was clear. His own single pair of hands could
  probably do nothing; but, nevertheless, he did not turn back or ride for help
  in the town. He kept on toward the perils of one more "last chance."</p>

  <p>A long, sharp-sided ravine gave him a good slant toward the head of the
  valley. When he came out of that ravine, he was low down the slope and he
  could see the fluttering of the firelight among rocks at the base of the
  hill.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he left the great stallion behind him and came on foot, worming
  his way here and there, never knowing when the upthrust of a hand of fire
  might show him to hostile eyes. And sometimes it seemed to Silver, as he came
  in closer, that the light was focused upon him out of a lantern, and that
  eyes were fixed upon him. It seemed as though voices were raised in laughing
  mockery while he drew nearer. Guns must be watching him. Fingers must be
  curling contentedly around the polished curve of triggers.</p>

  <p>But he came on up until the blackness of the shadows at close hand
  shielded him from the light of the fire, and there was only the moon to
  consider. That was comparatively simple, because the shadow of the next hill
  now sloped across half of the rock nest inside of which the fire was burning.
  That was why Silver was able to draw so very close up to the point of danger
  and of interest.</p>

  <p>He had arrived in time to see and hear all that had recently passed. He
  had had the uncomfortable experience of seeing the sack of dynamite placed
  right before the spot where he cowered. He used it, afterward, as a better
  cover which enabled him to draw nearer.</p>

  <p>So he heard the death sentence passed on Farrel, in simple words.</p>

  <p>"Look, Farrel," said Sam Waring, striding suddenly up to the prisoner.
  "Don't you go and be a fool. You come along with us. I'll take care of you.
  You come along with me. I'll give you a regular split in the job. I'll take
  care of you. I don't want the blood of any kid on my hands."</p>

  <p>"It ain't any good," argued Delgas. "There we had him tied and gagged and
  stretched all out, and the fool, he wants to be noble and kicks my gun and
  makes it go off and scare away that bird, Silver. A gent that wants to be
  noble," said Delgas, "ain't any use to birds like us. You know that,
  Sam."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Morrie," said Waring. "I know plenty. I'm asking the kid. It's
  up to you, Danny. Will you play with us?"</p>

  <p>Silver risked being seen, as he lifted his head to stare into the face of
  Farrell. That face was puffed and blood-streaked. It was set, too, in hard
  lines of endurance. The eyes glistened as Farrel stared back at Waring.</p>

  <p>"We've all gotta die once," said Farrel.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell!" said Waring, turning on his heel.</p>

  <p>He threw up his hands, as though to ask the world's attention to the
  effort that he had been willing to make on behalf of this young fool.</p>

  <p>"I told you," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, you told me," said Waring. "I wouldn't believe anybody'd be such a
  fool. Look here, Danny!"</p>

  <p>He whirled and faced Farrel again.</p>

  <p>"Everybody's laughing at you, you half-wit," said he. "Don't hold out on
  us, Danny. Come in and play the game, will you? What's the matter with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"He's nuts about a girl that cooks back there on the ranch," said Delgas.
  "Look at, kid," said Delgas, stepping suddenly close to Farrel. "She don't
  care about you. She was only givin' you a play, that's all. She'd pick up
  anybody. She give me the sweet eye, is what she done. She's just stringing
  you along."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" said Farrel.</p>

  <p>"You see?" said Delgas, stepping back and turning his hands palms up.
  "He's goin' to be noble, that's all. He's nuts about the girl, and he's goin'
  to be noble. She'll be married to some other sap about a week after the
  coyotes finish lickin' his bones, but he's goin' to die noble and believe in
  her to the finish."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Morrie," commanded Waring again. "Let me talk to him. Listen to
  me, kid, will you?"</p>

  <p>Farrel looked straight a Waring and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I'm giving you a break," said Waring. "Wake up to it, hombre. I'm giving
  you a break, and you don't know it. Will you take a hand in our game?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Farrel.</p>

  <p>"Thanks what? Yes, or no?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks&mdash;no," said Farrel.</p>

  <p>The hair prickled on the head of Jim Silver, as he heard that. He took out
  both revolvers and made his calculations. There was plenty of cover all
  around. He might get two or three of them before the rest were out of sight.
  He might even let Farrel have a chance to get to him. But after that?</p>

  <p>Well, after that, they'd be done for. Nothing could save them&mdash;not
  when fellows like Delgas and Waring and Rutherford were around. For all the
  pretended strength of his hatred for blood, Waring was the sort of a marksman
  who cannot miss, and Silver knew it very well.</p>

  <p>It was not of Rutherford's pale face that Silver thought most, now. It was
  of the bucktoothed smile of Steve Wycombe, his upper lips caught and hanging.
  That was the way he must be smiling now. For it began to look a good bet that
  all the men he wanted to get would go down&mdash;Rutherford, Delgas, and Jim
  Silver, all three.</p>

  <p>Decent men, it seemed to Silver, have fewer brains than rascals.
  Otherwise, such an inspiration could never have come into the head of Steve
  Wycombe.</p>

  <p>"You won't play with us?" repeated Waring.</p>

  <p>"He won't," said Delgas. "He's scared stiff, and he's dyin' on his feet
  with fear; but he's gotta be noble, the sucker! Give him the works and get
  rid of him, will you?"</p>

  <p>"You talk as if you'd like the job," Waring said. "Take it, Delgas. I give
  you my share in him."</p>

  <p>"Am I goin' to stick pigs for you, Sam?" demanded Delgas. "Since when, I'd
  like to know!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Waring. "It'll have to be fixed some way. One of my boys
  will turn the trick, I suppose. Too bad, though, because he's a pretty good
  kid."</p>

  <p>"Sam," said the voice of Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Keep your eye on Farrel," said Waring to the man called "Brick."</p>

  <p>"He needs plenty of watching. One fellow like that, loose in the world,
  could spoil my future for me."</p>

  <p>"Your future's like a fish a week out of water," said Brick gloomily, but
  he took up his post beside Farrel.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Harry?" Waring was asking, while Silver breathed more easily
  for the moment.</p>

  <p>He began to cudgel his brains. He had a conviction that, no matter how
  tight the pinch, no matter how hopeless a situation might be, there was
  always some way of solving it, some way of cutting the Gordian knot. Now he
  felt fairly baffled, but baffled he must not be.</p>

  <p>He began to strain his wits. Then he told himself that ideas would not
  come in that fashion. Instead, he must lie still, passively, and wait for
  whatever would come to him. So, little by little, he relaxed.</p>

  <p>There was a promise that he might gain a little time, for Rutherford and
  Waring were wrangling hotly.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Sam," Rutherford said. "Looks as though you're just fifty-seven
  hundred dollars short in the payment."</p>

  <p>"Hey!" shouted Waring, starting violently.</p>

  <p>Rutherford was not in the least moved. He lifted his pale face and studied
  Waring with a calm interest.</p>

  <p>"What you mean by fifty-seven hundred short?" demanded Waring.</p>

  <p>"I mean five thousand and seven hundred dollars and no cents," said
  Rutherford. "I mean that money's short."</p>

  <p>"It was in the pile when I handed it to you," declared Waring.</p>

  <p>Very gradually a smile spread over the features of Rutherford. He shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"It was in the satchel when I handed it to you," said Waring.</p>

  <p>Rutherford kept on smiling.</p>

  <p>"What the devil's the matter, Harry?" asked Waring "You don't think that
  I'd try to cheat you, do you?"</p>

  <p>"You know, brother," said Rutherford, "that we all look for a little
  inside profit. You wouldn't call it stealing."</p>

  <p>"Why, Harry," said Waring, "I'm kind of shocked by this here. It couldn't
  be that Ferris would 'a' hooked a handful of dough out of that satchel, could
  it? You don't really mean that the coin's missing, though? You're just
  laughin' up your sleeve at me."</p>

  <p>Rutherford continued to smile.</p>

  <p>"When you get through talking, Sam," said he, "just grab the extra cash
  and hand it over."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," said Waring. "Where would I get that much loose
  cash out of a crowd like this? Every bean that I've got is right in there.
  But I'll see you in a couple or three days."</p>

  <p>"I won't be around," said Harry Rutherford. "But don't you worry about the
  extra money, Sam."</p>

  <p>"No? Thanks," said Waring. "I knew you wouldn't try to hang up a deal like
  this on account of a measly little five or six thousand. I'll fix it with
  you, one day, as straight as a road."</p>

  <p>"Of course you will," said the quiet voice of Rutherford. "You'll fix it
  now. I'll just take that big rock you wear in your necktie, brother."</p>

  <p>"I'm not wearing that diamoned now, Harry," said Waring.</p>

  <p>"Not at your neck in the bandanna," agreed Rutherford. "You have it pinned
  under the lapel of your coat."</p>

  <p>"What?" exclaimed Sam Waring. "How did you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off his protesting argument and shouted with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Hey, but you're a cool bird, Harry," he said. "Did anybody ever put
  anything over on you?"</p>

  <p>"Not one, except Steve Wycombe, and he's wearing the scars of the good
  turn he did for me. Let's see the hard cash, brother."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Waring.</p>

  <p>And the brazen cheat instantly pulled out a wallet and counted the extra
  cash into the hand of Rutherford.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; STAMPEDE</h2>

  <p class="first">By this time, clouds of dust raised by the milling cattle
  were pouring in rapid drifts across the camp fire, turning into grit the food
  which the men were eating, scumming across the surface of the coffee. All
  complexions became gray in a moment. It was a fog, and not a thin fog, that
  surrounded the fire and that made the moon dim.</p>

  <p>Silver, with the razor edge of a knife, slit the tarpaulin that covered
  the dynamite. Inside was a quantity of sawdust; inside the sawdust lay the
  corded sticks of the explosive, each one carefully wrapped. He took out half
  a dozen of them, short lengths, and found a quantity of fuse, also. That was
  what he wanted. He hardly dared to look at Dan Farrel, in the meantime, for
  the moment of Dan's death was close at hand, plainly.</p>

  <p>He heard Red make a feeble protest.</p>

  <p>"This here is a fellow that would keep his mouth shut," said Red. "You
  could trust him, Waring. If he said he wouldn't talk about you, he'd keep his
  word."</p>

  <p>Waring went up to Red and laid a fatherly hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My dear young feller," said Waring. "You're just in the make and you
  ain't finished, yet, or else I'd be bothered about you. I'd say that maybe
  you had a lot to learn about the way folks act when they're under
  temptation.</p>

  <p>"Now, you take young Farrel here. I'd say that he's a fine lad and an
  honest lad and a lad that means well, but I wouldn't be able to tell what he
  might do after givin' us his word here. He might be tempted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Farrel broke in, his voice dry and harsh: "If I ever had a chance to
  hang the whole crew of you, I'd do it. I'd give my life to do it."</p>

  <p>The words fell like a blow on Jim Silver. He barely heard the voice of
  Waring continuing: "There! You can see for yourself what things are like. You
  can see for yourself that he ain't the sort of a fellow that would make a
  nice, reasonable bargain, is he?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said Red. "I'm kind of sick, is all I know."</p>

  <p>That was the last that Silver heard as he withdrew like a snake among the
  rocks. The sweeping of the dust from the herd covered him, and the thickness
  of the uproar of clashing hoofs and horns, the pounding, the bellowing seemed
  to conceal him under a blanket of noise. The sound of a cataract draws down
  all eyes into it, and in the same manner, perhaps, all looks would be
  centering now upon the milling of the herd.</p>

  <p>So he took chances of being seen as he hurried back toward the stallion.
  At any moment, even in a few seconds after he turned his back on the
  camp-fire scene, the thrust of a knife or the explosion of a gun might be the
  end of Farrel.</p>

  <p>If Farrel died, he swore that he would spend the rest of his days tracking
  down every man who had appeared around that fire. But all that quantity of
  revenge would not bring back life to Danny Farrel or ease the heart of the
  girl who had sent him away to do his duty on this night.</p>

  <p>So Silver worked with frantic haste, as he kneeled beside Parade, at last,
  attaching to each of the dynamite sticks a fuse of the length he had decided
  upon. He had three sticks and three fuses, each a little longer than the
  other, when he finally mounted. He proposed to save Farrel, if he could, not
  by shooting down the men who stood around him&mdash;there were too many of
  these&mdash;but by sweeping the whole gang away in the current of an action
  that promised to carry out from their hands the entire profits of the
  adventure on which they had embarked.</p>

  <p>So he rode Parade right down the gulley to the point where it shelved off
  to meet the valley floor and the sweeping dust clouds which drove up above
  the herd and circled in the light wind toward the moon. He was doubly glad of
  that screen of dust now.</p>

  <p>Closely as he harkened, he had not distinguished the sound of a gun during
  the interim. Perhaps Rutherford and Delgas and Waring were patching up the
  last details of their agreement; perhaps they intended to wait until the
  final moment before the herd was pushed up into the hills before they killed
  Dan Farrel and left him on the ground to be battered by the trampling hoofs
  beyond all recognition.</p>

  <p>Silver scratched a match.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Ferris, is that you?" yelled a voice not far away. "Cut in there and
  do your bit! Climb into it, kid!"</p>

  <p>Silver touched the flame of the match to the ends of the three fuses, one
  quite short, the others longer. He had three portions of death in his grasp
  then. Even Parade, steel-nerved under most circumstances, now began to dance
  uneasily as he saw the sparkling blue fire run sputtering up the fuses.</p>

  <p>Silver, with a yell, drove the stallion straight at the herd.</p>

  <p>Off to his right, he saw a rider phantom-gray in the dust, and heard the
  man cursing with bewildered surprise. The sweep of the outer flank of the
  milling cattle came into clearer view. He saw the dull sheen of their eyes,
  the tossing of the horns like crooked spears continually stabbing at the air,
  and full at the mass of them he threw the dynamite with the shortest fuse
  attached.</p>

  <p>It had seemed to him that he had waited until the fire was fairly kissing
  the dynamite, and yet there was no uproar of an explosion. Instead, the
  dynamite rolled under the feet of the first steers and was instantly out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>He turned the stallion, with a groan, to try again farther down the head
  of the crowding cattle. Then, behind him, he heard the explosion and felt the
  weight of it in the air about him, a soft and ponderous blow that made Parade
  leap like a hare.</p>

  <p>Glancing back, he could see several of the steers down, struggling. Those
  poor, mangled creatures would never rise again. But from about them the rest
  of the cattle were pressing back, throwing up their heads, trying to climb
  over the backs of the steers which still were surging up from the depths of
  the valley. It seemed to Silver that he had done no more than throw a bucket
  of water against the sweep of a sea, so small was the reaction.</p>

  <p>But he went on, yelling like a fiend.</p>

  <p>The second fuse had burned short. He set his teeth, counted three, and
  flung it. It burst in the very air, flattening several animals. He went on
  and cast the third stick far over against the farther side of the valley's
  head, into the thick of the steers.</p>

  <p>Again some of the poor creatures went down. But the rest were turning
  rapidly to escape these thunderbolts. With a frantic bawling the entire front
  of the herd wheeled and pressed back. It was slow work. The mass of the
  cattle remained before the terrified vanguard, a living wall against retreat
  unless the panic should spread to them.</p>

  <p>Right and left, now, Silver saw riders making toward him. He heard the
  shouting of the many voices. He thought he could make out the tremendous
  uproar of Delgas above the rest, thundering like a wounded bull.</p>

  <p>For his own part, Silver was pushing close in behind the van, close into
  the stifling fog of dust through which he was only vaguely aware of the
  twisting, swirling masses of confused backs, and of swaying horns. It made
  him dizzy, like looking into the fling and leap of water as it runs down a
  cataract.</p>

  <p>He shouted; he yelled; he fired guns in the face of any beast that chanced
  to turn back toward him. Far before him, he could hear the rear guard of
  cow-punchers shooting their Colts to keep the cattle near them from turning
  in a stampede.</p>

  <p>Close beside him, a voice drove in, screaming out curses. A bullet touched
  his hat, jerked at it with a small but deadly touch. He shot that fellow out
  of the saddle and saw the frightened cow pony go crash into the wall of the
  herd.</p>

  <p>But it was no longer quite a solid wall. It was splitting up. A shudder
  was working through the mass of the steers; the solidity of the throng opened
  into cracks that filled, closed, opened again. It was like watching a
  quicksand at work. Then all that quicksand began to flow, slowly, more
  quickly, as fast as a man could run, as fast, almost, as a horse could
  gallop.</p>

  <p>Parade followed close to the swinging tails.</p>

  <p>It was dangerous work. The dust streamed back at them in dense up-pourings
  that blinded the eyes. But eyes were needed to see the crumpled, red-washed
  bodies that lay on ground, here and there, where some unlucky steer had
  fallen and been beaten instantly to death by heavy hoofs.</p>

  <p>Through rifts in the flying dust, Silver, muffled to the eyes in a
  bandanna so that breathing could be possible, saw the walls of the ravine,
  one black with shadow, one gleaming with the moon.</p>

  <p>That gleaming wall he saw thrust out a straight-faced bluff where the
  valley narrowed a trifle. It was easy to see and easy to avoid, with the moon
  striking the front of it as if it glanced from white marble; but the steers
  could not turn, no matter what they saw through the blindness of their fear.
  There was no shifting inward, because the little valley was blocked from side
  to side, jammed with the sweep of the running cattle. There was no halting or
  turning back, because the rearward cattle picked up those in front and hurled
  them forward.</p>

  <p>So Silver saw a living wave strike the face of that bluff, pile instantly
  high on it, bank the angle full with the dead, and so shunt the remnant
  safely past the danger point.</p>

  <p>It was enough to break a man's heart to see good beef wasted in this
  fashion, but in a moment like that the salvation of the entire herd was what
  Silver had to think of.</p>

  <p>Then, before him, he saw the herd thinning. He knew by that that they were
  approaching the mouth of the valley. Presently the dust cloud thinned away.
  Breaths and puffs of sweet, fresh air came to him like a salvation. The
  myriad beating of the hoofs no more kept the ground quivering beneath him,
  but scattered far and wide.</p>

  <p>He rode off to the right, drawing up Parade to a canter. He was off to the
  side of the valley's mouth when he saw other riders fly by him, half revealed
  through the dust, sweeping on to head off the stampede, if possible.</p>

  <p>But Silver, drawing back into a corner of the hills, observed the onward
  course of the living avalanche which he had started and was content.
  Stampeding steers are not easily turned, and they do not easily lose their
  momentum. Far, far away across the desert the dust cloud blew, rolled small
  and smaller, dwindled, seemed no more than an obscure smoke that was barely
  visible beneath the moon.</p>

  <p>After it had dwindled like this, he saw, from his shadow-filled cranny,
  the thing that he had hoped to see.</p>

  <p>Out of the valley's mouth proceeded a small group of riders, among whom he
  recognized Rutherford, Waring, and Red. With them came a tall fellow who sat
  with his hands tied behind his back and had his horse's lead rope attached to
  Waring's saddle.</p>

  <p>That was poor Danny Farrel. The stampede had given him the grace of a
  little more life, but in a way it seemed to have made his death almost the
  more sure. For every one of the group would be savagely hungry for blood
  after the disappointment of that night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; WARING'S PROPOSITION</h2>

  <p class="first">Moonlight swallows things quickly, even when there is the
  clear air of the desert for it to shine through. That cavalcade disappeared
  and left an ache in the back of Silver's brain as he recalled the straight
  back and the high head of poor Dan Farrel.</p>

  <p>Why had they saved him? Perhaps&mdash;it had been Silver's hope from the
  first&mdash;because with the cattle scattered and Jim Silver abroad to make
  further mischief, Rutherford and the rest would be glad to have him alive as
  a bargaining point.</p>

  <p>It was in this hope that he calmly unsaddled Parade that night, wrapped
  himself in slicker and blanket, and, with the saddle for a pillow went to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>Twice Parade wakened him, snuffing close to his face and stamping to give
  the alarm. Once it was merely a wolf that had come out on the shoulder of the
  hill to look down on man. Once it was for some taint that had blown to Parade
  on the air; but, when Silver could see nothing, he lay down again and slept
  peacefully until the sun put a warm hand on his face.</p>

  <p>He got up, washed his eyes and mouth with water from his canteen,
  swallowed a few drops of the liquid, and then pulled up his belt two notches
  to take the place of breakfast. Parade, grazing the tough gramma grass at a
  short distance from his master, came back and stood with downward head,
  dozing, while Silver smoked a cigarette.</p>

  <p>After a time the stallion went off to graze again, while Silver waited
  through the hot hours. For once in his life he had no plan beyond that
  waiting.</p>

  <p>A glad man was Jim Silver when, late in the morning, he saw a rider jog
  toward him across the sands from the direction of the ranch house. He watched
  the little puffs of dust that squirted out from the feet of the horse as the
  rider drew nearer. Then he made out the bulky form of none other than Sam
  Waring, who stopped at a considerable distance and waved a white rag or
  handkerchief slowly back and forth.</p>

  <p>Silver grinned as he watched. He took out a bandanna and waved that in
  answer. Waring seemed still in doubt, but finally he came on slowly. Twice
  and again he paused for further thought, but at length he rode straight up to
  the place where Silver sat on a rock, inhaling the smoke of a cigarette.</p>

  <p>The hesitation that had appeared in Waring's actions was not in his
  speech. He summoned a broad smile and waved his hand at Silver.</p>

  <p>"All safe and friendly, brother, eh?" he asked cheerfully.</p>

  <p>Silver made a noncommittal gesture.</p>

  <p>"It seemed a good time for a little talk," said Waring, "so the boys sent
  me out to find you. They thought you'd be around this valley,
  somewhere&mdash;and here you are."</p>

  <p>"Get off the horse and sit down, Waring," suggested Silver. "You don't
  look happy there. You're too high in the air."</p>

  <p>Waring laughed as he got down to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I ain't what I used to be in a saddle," he confessed. "There was a day
  when I fitted onto a hoss like a clothespin onto a line. But that day's gone,
  and now I'm kind of swelled up and wabbling with fat."</p>

  <p>He sat down on a rock near Silver, took off his hat, mopped his fleshy
  brow, and went on:</p>

  <p>"I've come to talk about young Farrel, of course."</p>

  <p>Silver nodded.</p>

  <p>"Being a friend of yours," said Waring, "nacherally you want him out of
  hock."</p>

  <p>Silver nodded again.</p>

  <p>"And the fact is," said Waring, "that he's been in a good deal of
  danger."</p>

  <p>"Has he?" said Silver.</p>

  <p>"There was a time last night," said Waring, "when some of the boys wanted
  to bump him off before he had a chance to get loose and spread the news
  around about the way they'd been cutting up. If it hadn't been for me talking
  on his side, something bad would sure 'a' happened to him."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Silver. "I was behind a rock near the dynamite sack,
  Waring, when you were interceding for him. I know the kind things you
  said."</p>

  <p>He looked into the eyes of the fat man, but Waring merely laughed.</p>

  <p>"You're a fox, Silver," said he. "A regular silver fox, is what you are,
  and it would take a brighter man than poor old Sam Waring to put anything
  over on you. But, all jokes aside, young Danny Farrel is in a heap of hot
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"He is," agreed Silver.</p>

  <p>"So doggone much trouble that something had oughta be done about it, and
  that's why I'm out here to talk to you, Jim!"</p>

  <p>"Make your proposition," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"It's this way," said Waring. "Everybody knows that Silver ain't the sort
  of a fellow to turn down a friend. Everybody knows that you're the sort who
  sticks by a partner to the finish. Well, then, this is what we've got in
  mind: On the one side there's a few cows. On the other side there's a friend.
  You can make your choice, and I know what choice you'll make."</p>

  <p>"It's this way," said Silver. "If I agree to let you fellows get away with
  the cattle, you'll let me have young Danny Farrel&mdash;and his girl beside
  him."</p>

  <p>"Aw, the girl don't count. We throw her in. Sure, you can have her," said
  Waring. "You don't think that we'd make trouble for a woman, do you, Jim? Do
  you think that we're that sort of snake?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said Silver, "that you'd throttle a baby in a cradle if you
  could make a hundred dollars out of it."</p>

  <p>"Come, come, come!" protested Waring, holding up a fat, soft hand. "You
  wouldn't wanta talk rough, Jim, would you? The fact is that you and me have
  to talk business, and it don't help business along to start calling names.
  You know that, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do," said Silver. "But I've named the proposition, haven't
  I?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Waring. "We've got your young friend. A fine, manly,
  honest kid, Silver. As manly and honest as I ever seen. It would do me good
  to see a kid like that wearing my name, matter of fact. But, when all's said
  and done, business is business. How does it sound to you?"</p>

  <p>Silver rubbed his toe in the dust. "I could spoil your business for you,
  Waring," said he. "I could get to town and gather in plenty of men in a posse
  to wreck the job for you before your boys will ever be able to gather those
  cows out of the stampede."</p>

  <p>Waring scowled at him with a sudden loss of his cheerful veneer.</p>

  <p>"You've raised hell already," said he. "You've spilled more'n a thousand
  dollars of good beef out of the cup already. It's lying dead back there in
  the valley to feed the buzzards, and that's your work. What put it into your
  head to use dynamite to start the stampede?"</p>

  <p>"They laid the dynamite down in front of me," said Silver. "You can't
  expect me to refuse a gift like that, can you?"</p>

  <p>Waring stared.</p>

  <p>"And then you rode right in through the bunch and got at the cows. Ferris
  is laid up bad. He's shot inside the shoulder, and he might not pull
  through."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for that," said Silver, frowning.</p>

  <p>Sam Waring answered suddenly: "Why lie about it, Silver? You're glad that
  you nicked one of the boys. It pleases you the same's it would 'a' pleased
  them to put a slug in you. I ain't wrong about that."</p>

  <p>"You are," said Silver. "I've seen men that I'd like to drift some lead
  into. But I hate to shoot at a man I don't know."</p>

  <p>Waring grunted his disbelief as he rolled a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"How did you happen to have that dynamite along?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Ferris again!" exclaimed Waring. "The fool only got what he deserved. He
  was on a prospecting trip, him and a mule. We come across him in the hills,
  and we picked up him and our bad luck and brought 'em both along to help out.
  A lot of help he was. But come on, Silver. Make your bargain."</p>

  <p>"I give up a third of the cattle for the sake of one man?" said
  Silver.</p>

  <p>Waring winced, as though he felt the force of this argument.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "that's the proposition, and I gotta stick to it."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Silver nodded. "I'll make the exchange," he said.</p>

  <p>Waring heaved a breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "that's great. I gotta admit that you're a reasonable
  gent to do business with. Mighty reasonable. We'll just run the cows out of
  the desert and off the ranch into the hills, and then you can have your
  partner. You can have him safe and sound."</p>

  <p>Silver smiled.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what's the matter?" asked Waring.</p>

  <p>"You keep him till you've got the cattle where you want 'em, eh?" queried
  Silver.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with that? Mean that you don't trust us, old son?"</p>

  <p>Silver shook his head. "If I let you get the cattle through the hills, you
  may turn Farrel over to me, but he'll be a dead man when I find him."</p>

  <p>"I swear," said Waring, lifting one hand and rolling up his eyes with a
  solemn shake of his head. "I swear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't do it," said Silver. "Take your hand down and don't swear. It
  doesn't work with me, Waring."</p>

  <p>The fat man slowly dropped his hand. A faint stain of red crawled up his
  throat and over his face. He said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to make another sort of deal," said Silver. "I'll have to have
  security that you'll turn Farrel over to me if I let the herd go."</p>

  <p>"What sort of security?" asked Waring.</p>

  <p>"A man for a man. If Delgas or Rutherford will put themselves in my hands,
  I'll take 'em as bail for Farrel."</p>

  <p>"Delgas&mdash;Rutherford&mdash;you ain't crazy, Silver, are you?" shouted
  Waring.</p>

  <p>"It's the only way I'll talk business," said Silver.</p>

  <p>Waring stared at him, started to talk, changed his mind. Then he stood
  up.</p>

  <p>"How long before you expect an answer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sunset," said Silver. "If one of 'em rides out from the house at sunset,
  I'll know that he's come to be bail for Farrel, and the deal goes
  through."</p>

  <p>Waring, his head fallen in thought, rode off without another word.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. mdash; TRAPPED</h2>

  <p class="first">Silver waited out the hours of that long afternoon among the
  sun-baked hills. He was very hungry, and a big jack rabbit obligingly poked
  its foolish head up above a rock to make a dinner for him. He took off the
  head of the rabbit with a .45-caliber slug and broiled the flesh over a small
  fire. He ate it slowly, because he had very little water to wash it down.
  Parade was now so thirsty that he had stopped grazing altogether, so Silver
  took him across country to the verge of the big tank and let him drink from
  that muddy water.</p>

  <p>In the sunset he came back toward the ranch house and stopped five hundred
  yards from it, where he began to drift the horse forward and backward. Nearer
  he dared not come, for there were men in that outfit to whom even five
  hundred yards was not impossible with their favorite rifle. He depended on
  the flare and uncertainty of the light at this time of the day.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, he scanned the horizon and saw from south and east and
  west approaching clouds of dust which told him that some of the punchers were
  bringing up the cattle that they had collected across the face of the desert.
  All of those dust clouds moved toward the ranch house as a focus. Some time
  during the night, perhaps, the big herd would be assembled, and the drift
  toward the mountains would start.</p>

  <p>Already it was rather late. He had waited long, and, if he rode to get
  help, they might have most of the cattle deep in the ravines before he
  returned.</p>

  <p>He had thought of that all during the day, but he had not dared to ride
  for a posse. By that means he would be able to save the herd, of course, but
  he would never be able to save Danny Farrel. They would shoot him out of hand
  at the first sign of approaching danger, of course.</p>

  <p>But what a quandary Delgas and the great Rutherford must be in at this
  moment, risking, as they were, the value of both land and cattle. For, though
  they might rush the cows through, they would certainly lose their landed
  acres as men outlawed for their crime.</p>

  <p>It could only be that they hoped against hope that they would be able to
  sell the herd and deliver it, and then that they could dispose of Farrel and
  leave Silver with empty hands.</p>

  <p>If afterward Jim Silver appeared in the law courts&mdash;though that was
  not his wont&mdash;then a staunch agreement between themselves would swear
  down his testimony in nearly any court of the law.</p>

  <p>He thought of this grimly, as he saw the sun go down beneath the horizon
  without sign of anyone coming toward him from the ranch house.</p>

  <p>A number of the punchers had gathered near the house, staring out toward
  the shimmering, golden figure of the stallion. Silver could see them
  watching, pointing, gesticulating. He could hear the dim tremors of their
  voices. He could hear a man calling from the bunk house, a sound like a bird
  in the far-away sky. But increasing dimness of the twilight thickened the
  air. And at last, as only a dull band of orange burned along the horizon, he
  knew that no one would come out to him.</p>

  <p>The house disappeared in darkness, then was marked by a single ray of
  yellow light, which told him of poor Esther at work in her kitchen with ice
  in her heart.</p>

  <p>He looked around the black immensity of the earth, and it seemed to him
  that his mind was as empty of all resources as the darkening vault of the
  sky. Still he could hear voices, the slamming of doors, from the house,
  though he could no longer make out individual figures. But some of the men
  were probably still there, staring across the night at him, wondering what
  he, poor fool, could do about it.</p>

  <p>That was the thing. What could he do?</p>

  <p>He could only grit his teeth and pray for an idea. So long as they held
  poor Danny Farrel, they held Jim Silver, also, and they were clever enough to
  know this. That was what forced him to make up his mind to the impossible. He
  would go straight into the house of the enemy and there do what he could for
  Farrel.</p>

  <p>He rode back through the night slowly, trying to sketch a plan. The house
  was fairly well in his mind, but now he wished that he had drawn a print of
  every room and every window. He had to plan, and yet there was not much to
  plan about. It seemed almost better to advance blindly and leave everything
  to chance when he came in contact with the Rutherford and Waring men.</p>

  <p>What worried him most of all was Rutherford. The others might be
  surprised, taken off their feet by a sudden move; but the imagination of
  Rutherford was of the capacious sort which understands what other men are
  likely to conceive.</p>

  <p>The shallow draw which ran out of the desert toward the house gave Silver
  such good cover that he could ride the gold stallion within a very short
  distance of the place. There he dismounted, made the tall horse lie down, and
  prepared to go ahead on foot.</p>

  <p>He turned himself into a ragamuffin for the purpose. Coat, sombrero,
  boots, socks went into the discard. He rolled his riding trousers to the
  knee. He had with him the weight of his two Colts, and that was all, when he
  came over the edge of the draw and started for the house.</p>

  <p>The windmill offered some sort of cover for his advance, but it was the
  sort of skeleton protection which would be watched by the men on guard
  without actually making a shield for a spy. So he gave up the thought of the
  windmill and went straight at the house. He had on the straight line only the
  almost imperceptible undulations of the ground and one good-sized cactus. It
  was not protection. It was hardly a hint at protection. What he would have to
  rely upon was the fact that people do not look for men working like snakes in
  the dust, as he was working now.</p>

  <p>He was almost at the cactus, blessing the size of its three large leaves,
  when lantern light began to wash across the black earth around him. Not one,
  but several lanterns were brought, and, while he lay there behind the
  wretchedly imperfect shadow of that cactus, he saw a lantern nailed up at
  every corner of the house!</p>

  <p>That was Rutherford. He was the fellow who would think of bathing the
  house with light to expose all who approached, whereas most people would have
  kept their eyes open in darkness and so would have hoped to trap the invader.
  But Rutherford had a brain.</p>

  <p>Not only was there a light at each corner of the irregular building, but
  there appeared to be a man on guard there, also.</p>

  <p>Silver lay sweating in the dust, and it was by no means the heat of the
  ground that caused the water to pour.</p>

  <p>For his position seemed to him most perfectly helpless. To worm his way
  forward in the darkness had been dangerous and hard enough. To worm his way
  backward through the light until he reached the edge of the draw would be
  worse than madness, he was certain. Then what remained for him to do?</p>

  <p>In his excitement, he drew a breath that was chiefly dust, and had to lie,
  strangling, choking, stifling, for whole minutes, controlling the convulsions
  of his body with a mighty effort of the will to keep from drawing a single
  gasping breath.</p>

  <p>When at last he was able to breathe again, he could give his mind to an
  insoluble problem. He was more and more convinced that he was hopelessly
  trapped. There was not even a thing to hope for, except a rain and hailstorm
  so tremendous that it would blot out the light of the lanterns and give him a
  chance to crawl away through the mud, but to pray for rain under the starry
  sky of the desert was like praying for a miracle. Ten months might pass,
  here, before so much as a shower fell.</p>

  <p>The Rutherford men were ideally placed. They had light by which to spy him
  out if he so much as stirred, and they had their saddle horses at hand if the
  least suspicious sign appeared to their eyes. They could be in the saddle and
  away like bullets at the first signal. The mustangs, with thrown reins to
  anchor them, stood in three groups near the house, four or five in a bunch.
  There were more than were needed, for the reason, perhaps, that Rutherford
  had decided to be forehanded and equipped in every possible particular.</p>

  <p>Silver, lying flat on his face, could have groaned with despair. He heard
  one of the men at the nearer corners of the house saying:</p>

  <p>"One way of looking at it, this here is a funny business&mdash;we hang out
  a light for a gent to shoot at us by."</p>

  <p>"He won't shoot," said the other. "Silver ain't that kind. There ain't no
  Injun about him. He don't take no advantages."</p>

  <p>"Ain't he a gunman?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"Sure, he's a gunman."</p>

  <p>"Then what you mean he don't take advantages? He's faster with a gun than
  other folks are, and he's straighter with his shooting. That means that he's
  got all kind of advantages."</p>

  <p>"I mean, he don't play 'em. When they crowd him, he fights back, and
  that's all there is to it."</p>

  <p>"You sound kind of nutty to me," said the other. "Here's a gent with a
  list of dead as long as my arm, and you say he don't take advantages? How
  could he have such a record if he didn't go out for scalps?"</p>

  <p>"You dunno the kind of a fool this bird is. He goes where the water is
  likely to have fish in it, and then he waits for a fish to show. He don't
  drop a line in. He waits for the fish to bite him, and then he bites
  back."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like fool talk."</p>

  <p>"Does it? What I mean is that he waits for the other gents to crowd him.
  If they won't crowd him man by man, they'll crowd him in couples or gangs.
  There ain't many stories of Silver hunted by single men. There's plenty of
  stories of him hunted by a whole crew."</p>

  <p>"It looks to me as though Rutherford and Delgas and Waring have got him
  beat to a frazzle in this here business."</p>

  <p>"Nobody's got him beat till he's ten feet buried underground, and even
  then he's likely to claw his way out. But there's numbers and brains against
  him now. There's Waring and Rutherford, to say nothin' of Delgas, that's
  worth a little speech all by himself."</p>

  <p>"What is goin' to happen to Danny Farrel?"</p>

  <p>"The same as always happens to a gent that tries to go straight when going
  crooked is the way the others around him are walking."</p>

  <p>A shadow fell over Silver as he listened to the last words. That shadow
  struck his brain like a bullet. He hardly dared to look up, but then he saw
  that it was only one of the horses which had edged close to smell at the
  tempting green and the bristling thorns of the big cactus. If the brute
  suddenly took notice of a man lying on the ground and jumped away with a
  snort, it was apt to bring the attention of the guards to Silver.</p>

  <p>Then he saw that the thing might be a sort of act of Providence to give
  him deliverance from his danger of the moment.</p>

  <p>Some one called out at the other end of the house. One of the nearest
  sentries turned to watch; the other sang out in reply.</p>

  <p>That moment Silver used to rise slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>He could not sit in the saddle, of course, but he fitted his knee into the
  stirrup leather just above the stirrup, and, with his weight resting on that
  support, he slid the other leg far back, hooking his toes around the pony's
  quarter. With his hands he gripped the saddle flaps. He was embarked. Neither
  his feet nor his body showed, for the moment. He was something suspended in
  empty air, as it were.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; IN THE HOUSE</h2>

  <p class="first">The great advantage was that Silver was at last off the
  ground. The black shadow of the body of the horse was as a blessing to him,
  but that mustang was not bestowing more than one blessing at a time. He
  reached around, got a good grip, and took a bite at the shoulder of Jim
  Silver. The tough flesh slipped from under the teeth of the horse, but it was
  agony for Silver. He dared not move to beat the head of the horse away, at
  that moment, for his knee threatened to slip out of the stirrup leather and
  let him down with a crash in the dust.</p>

  <p>Having taken one nip, the horse seemed content. It began to drift on away
  from the cactus, moving with very short steps. And Silver discovered that the
  brute was moving not away from the house but toward it!</p>

  <p>It seemed to be trying to steal away from the other animals, by the
  shortness of its steps deceiving the eyes of the men who watched it.</p>

  <p>One of them sang out, "What's the matter with that fool of a hoss?"</p>

  <p>"That's Jerry's hoss. He's gone and cinched it up loose. Look at the way
  that saddle's turned over!"</p>

  <p>"I better fix it. If that hoss has to be used, it's gotta be used fast and
  used hard."</p>

  <p>Steps came toward Jim Silver. He loosened the grip of his right hand,
  though thereby he made his hold on the horse very precarious.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. Let Jerry do his own work. He's always sliding out from
  trouble," said the other sentry.</p>

  <p>The footfall paused.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, maybe you're right," said the second speaker, and turned back.</p>

  <p>"I never seen a freckle-nosed son that was any good, anyway," said the
  other. "And Jerry's all over freckles."</p>

  <p>"He's a lazy hobo," said the other sentry.</p>

  <p>Silver, using his right hand to pluck at the mane of the mustang, tried to
  pull it away from the house and turn the head of the horse in another
  direction. But the mustang was perceptibly braced against this weight which
  lay along its side and therefore it naturally moved in the opposite
  direction. That happened to be toward the house, and nothing that Silver
  could do would make the pony change his mind. He dared not reach for the
  reins, of course.</p>

  <p>They were now steering past the corner of the house.</p>

  <p>"That hoss is sure a drifter," said one of the watchers. "He sure aims to
  stir around."</p>

  <p>"It's Jerry own fault," said the other. "He oughta train a hoss to stand
  when the reins are once throwed on it."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, he'd oughta do that. I wonder is Delgas socking that old rye on the
  nose, right now?"</p>

  <p>By this time the mustang had gone past the corner of the house. As it
  moved in closer to the wall, a new danger came to Silver, which was that he
  might now be seen by either of the guards if they chanced to make a single
  pace out from the wall. But now they were right beside the wall.</p>

  <p>Silver softly dropped his feet to the ground, ducked under the neck of the
  mustang, and stood in front of the black, square mouth of an open window. The
  blaze of the lanterns struck full on him. He saw the guard off at the right,
  turn his head and apparently look straight at him. Yet the man in a moment
  turned his head once more and looked straight before him, whistling! He had
  seen nothing because he expected to see nothing.</p>

  <p>Silver, the next instant, was through the black of the window and kneeling
  in safety on the floor of the room inside.</p>

  <p>Safety? He could hardly call it safety to be in a house where every hand
  was against him, and where no hands were weak. He heard, very distinctly, the
  deep voice of Delgas, which was booming in another portion of the house. What
  a windfall it would be to Delgas and Rutherford if they could get their hands
  on him!</p>

  <p>He smiled a little, as he thought of that.</p>

  <p>Then, just outside the window, he heard a voice exclaim: "Look here!
  Here's a footmark in the dust. Look at it. Right where the mustang was
  standin'!"</p>

  <p>Silver moved like a snake into a corner of the room and lay still.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said the second sentry, joining his companion. "It looks like a
  footprint, all right."</p>

  <p>Then a silence followed in which the imagination of Silver conceived of
  the truth entering the brains of those fellows.</p>

  <p>But presently one of them said: "Well, there ain't any footmarks leadin'
  up to it. You can see that for yourself."</p>

  <p>"Sure I can. But I wanta know how this here mark came."</p>

  <p>"I dunno. Maybe it dropped down out of the sky."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like a fool. There ain't anybody around this house that'd be
  likely to go without boots, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Well, how would a mark like that come there? You think that Silver made
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. I ain't thinking."</p>

  <p>"I reckon you ain't, Slim."</p>

  <p>"All I know is that it's a funny thing that that mark's on the ground. I
  dunno what to make of it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe an angel made it. Jumped down out of the sky and stamped on the
  ground, and jumped up into the sky ag'in. Maybe there's an angel laughin' at
  us right now."</p>

  <p>"Aw," said Slim gruffly, "shut up, will you?" His voice entered the room,
  as he spoke, and now he scratched a match. Silver, curled up in a corner
  behind a chair, covered his man with a Colt and prayed that he would not have
  to shoot.</p>

  <p>The flame of the match revealed a long, sallow, evil face, and a gaunt
  neck with an Adam's apple that moved up and down like a fist.</p>

  <p>Slim presently tossed the match over his shoulder and straightened.</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's likely to be kind of hard on you," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Leave me be," said Slim. "I'm goin' to go and report this here."</p>

  <p>"Are you? You'll catch it if you do. There's some of the boys that think
  you ain't too bright already, Slim, and if you start in talkin' about angels
  that leave their footprints on the ground&mdash;well, there'll be
  trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Hold your trap," said Slim, "or I'll slam it shut for you. I'm goin' to
  tell Rutherford and see what he'll have to say."</p>

  <p>The footfall departed with a soft jingling of spurs.</p>

  <p>Silver looked desperately about him in the dark of the room. He could not
  stay there. Where could he stay in the place when once the word was brought
  to the great Rutherford? The active wit of that man would not fail to hitch
  importance to the mystery of that footprint in the dust.</p>

  <p>Silver found the knob of a door and opened it upon the dark of a hall.
  Through the darkness, voices came to him intimately, dwelling in his ear. He
  saw the long yellow-red slit of lamplight that showed where a door fitted
  poorly to its jamb.</p>

  <p>Then, in farther distance, he could make out the sharp, high-pitched voice
  of Slim saying words which he did not understand, but which were undoubtedly
  about the mystery of that footprint. A moment later the house would be
  searched. There would be nothing for him except to fight as well as he could
  until they decided to burn him out. It would not take them very long to
  decide that, of course.</p>

  <p>Another door, just a step down the hallway, yawned suddenly with a low
  groan of hinges. As he jerked back his head, he saw a lamp carried in the
  hand of Esther Maxwell, its light close to her tired face and the red
  blotches of her eyes.</p>

  <p>He drew back from her sight still farther, but he called softly out of the
  darkness of his room, as the light walked toward him in regular pulsations
  down the hall.</p>

  <p>"Esther! Esther! Do you hear me? It's Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>He heard the catch and the long take of her breath, like a soft moan. Then
  he ventured to step out before her. The lamp wobbled out of her hand. He
  caught it. He took her by the wrists and crushed them together.</p>

  <p>"Take hold of yourself!" said Silver savagely.</p>

  <p>She nodded, breathless.</p>

  <p>"They'll be hunting for me through the house in another minute," said he,
  returning the lamp to her hand. "Hide me somewhere. In your room is as good
  as the next place."</p>

  <p>He heard the voice of Rutherford calling: "Billy! Mike! Whisky Joe!"</p>

  <p>"Quick! Quick!" he urged her.</p>

  <p>She tried to run past him up the stairs to show the way, but he checked
  her. Whatever happened, no running footfalls must be heard by those who would
  soon be hunting through the place for him.</p>

  <p>They went up the narrow stairway. It had no railing for safety or comfort
  and it was simply bracketed out from the wall, so that squeaking was
  unavoidable even when he walked close to the supporting wall.</p>

  <p>There was no hallway, only a single landing and door at the head of the
  steps. He opened that and glided through in the lead as a trampling of many
  feet came into the hall beneath and the voice of Delgas boomed:</p>

  <p>"Who's that?"</p>

  <p>"It's I," said the girl. "What's wrong?" Delgas imitated her stammering
  voice and roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"The little fool's goin' to fall down on her bean," said Delgas. "She's
  scared pink and blue, already. Well, honey, there ain't nothing
  wrong&mdash;yet&mdash;but if there turns out to be a man in the house,
  there's goin' to be a whole lot wrong. Come on, boys!"</p>

  <p>The girl entered the room behind Silver and closed the door behind her,
  the light staggering in her frightened hand. She turned and looked with
  ghostly eyes at him.</p>

  <p>"What can we do?" said her soundless lips.</p>

  <p>He went across the floor like a cat, took the lamp, and put it on the
  center table.</p>

  <p>Then he looked around him.</p>

  <p>For a window there was only a pair of square holes punched into the roof,
  each about a foot wide. The furniture consisted of a small wardrobe, the
  little center table, the washstand, two narrow chairs, and an iron bedstead.
  There was no paint on the floor, walls, or ceiling. It was simply a bare box.
  The air was hot. The sun of the long afternoon had turned the room into an
  oven. And as the sweat trickled down the face of Silver, seeing how perfectly
  he was trapped, he thought once more of dead Steve Wycombe who was reaching
  so strongly out of the grave to draw down after him the man who had taken his
  life.</p>

  <p>Then Silver turned back to the white, staring face of the girl.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing for me to do but hide," he whispered. "There's no place
  for me to hide except under that bed. You do something. Sit down and write a
  letter. Do anything to show that you're occupied, and if they want to come in
  to search&mdash;don't oppose them!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE SEARCH</h2>

  <p class="first">He slid under the bed. It was sufficiently wide and the
  shadow the lamp threw was sufficiently steep so that he would be hidden from
  the gaze of any except a man who leaned over and peered for him. But if they
  searched in the room at all, were they not sure to look carefully under the
  bed?</p>

  <p>He could see the girl sitting at the center table. He could see her as far
  as her elbows; he could hear the rapid scratching of her pen.</p>

  <p>"Where's Danny?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"They can't hear, if you whisper. Where's Danny?"</p>

  <p>"In your room. With Mr. Rutherford."</p>

  <p>"What are they going to do with him?"</p>

  <p>"Keep him. They're going to keep him to make sure that you do nothing and
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Even her whisper was more than she could maintain, at that point.</p>

  <p>And Silver understood. They would keep Dan Farrel with them until the
  drive into the mountains had been completed and then, instead of giving him
  freedom, they would put a bullet through his head and leave him for the
  buzzards and coyotes. They would be reasonably sure that Jim Silver would not
  interfere so long as his friend was in their hands. It seemed to Silver, as
  he lay there and ran his swift eye back over the pages of his life, that all
  his troubles had sprung from his friendships, and yet all of those labors had
  not yielded him a single friend whom he cared to take with him on his
  adventures. Where he met a man, there he left him. His partners remained
  where he had found them, fixed in his memory like the mountains; only Silver
  went on.</p>

  <p>He heard the girl say: "I know what you've done, and no man ever did more
  for a friend. I've prayed for you when I prayed for Danny."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" breathed Silver, as he heard a footfall coming up the stairs.</p>

  <p>It was a heavy step, stamping down on the boards, making the flimsy wood
  groan and squeak under the pressure.</p>

  <p>Delgas beat once on the door, heavily, and then flung it open.</p>

  <p>"Hello. What's in here?" he roared.</p>

  <p>He came thumping into the room with the jingle of the spurs at his heels.
  The reek of his cigar was instantly in every corner.</p>

  <p>"Just takin' a quiet little minute by yourself, eh?" said Delgas to the
  girl. "You ain't seen nothing of a long streak of poison called Jim Silver,
  have you?"</p>

  <p>She said nothing. She must have been shaking her head.</p>

  <p>"Scared stiff, eh?" said Delgas. "So doggone scared that she dunno what to
  do about it? Can't talk? Just stand there and wag your head? Well, I guess he
  ain't in here, unless he's under the bed."</p>

  <p>The big feet of Delgas crossed the room, and he kicked at the empty space
  under the bed. That maneuver came so unexpectedly that Silver barely flinched
  his face back in time enough to escape from catching the blow.</p>

  <p>Delgas turned again.</p>

  <p>"There ain't anything for you to be so shakin' about," said Delgas. "He
  can't do you no harm, this gent Silver. Not while gents like me are around.
  You know why? Because I'd take care of you. You're an uncommon pretty girl,
  Esther, and I been noticin' you. You'd be a help to a gent. There's only one
  funny thing about you, and that's why you cotton to a doggone common gent
  like poor Danny Farrel. I'll tell you why. It's because there ain't anything
  to a feller like that. There ain't any sand to him, and there ain't any
  brains. He's in the soup, and the best way for you is to forget him and take
  a look around for something else in the way of a man. And when you're
  lookin', stop your eye a minute on Morrie Delgas. He ain't pretty, but he's
  got a silver lining!"</p>

  <p>When he finished, he broke into a great, bawling laughter that filled the
  room and half deafened Silver. Then, still braying, Delgas went out of the
  room and creaking down the stairs, slamming the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Through the flimsy partitions, Silver could hear Delgas saying: "No sign
  of him up there. No sign of nobody. It ain't likely he'd be fool enough to
  come into this house anyway, is it?"</p>

  <p>"When you know enough," answered the voice of Rutherford, "to read the
  mind of Jim Silver and say what he's likely to do and what he's not likely to
  do, I'll take my hat off to you and go to work for you, Morrie. You weren't
  long enough in that room to search it."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," answered Delgas. "I was long enough to search the room and
  kiss the girl and come back again."</p>

  <p>And the long uproar of his laughter went quivering through the house once
  more.</p>

  <p>"Steady, now!" whispered Silver. "That's Rutherford coming, and he's twice
  the danger that's in Delgas."</p>

  <p>There was a polite rap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" called the girl.</p>

  <p>The door opened.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to bother you, Esther," said Rutherford, "but I ought to glance
  over this room. Delgas is a little careless."</p>

  <p>"I've been right here," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"He was in the house before you went up to your room," answered
  Rutherford.</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"I don't see where he could be, though," said Rutherford. There was
  another pause.</p>

  <p>Then he asked: "Writing letters through all the excitement, Esther?"</p>

  <p>"I had to do something," said the girl. "I've been half hysterical. Is Jim
  Silver in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me a moment," said Rutherford. "I hate to do this, but little
  things are sometimes important."</p>

  <p>Paper rustled. He read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="scmap">Dearest Mother</span>: It's high time
  that I should write you a letter because I haven't written for a long time
  and if&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>There was another pause.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Rutherford quietly. "I should say that you have been half
  hysterical&mdash;or else that you were simply scratching words down on paper
  for the sake of seeming occupied. It isn't that, my dear, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Seeming occupied?" the girl stammered.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing but the bed that could hide anything," said he.</p>

  <p>And he walked straight toward it.</p>

  <p>Silver hesitated a tenth part of a second. He could kill Rutherford,
  easily enough, but the report of the gun would bring the others, and nothing
  in the world could save him then.</p>

  <p>He hooked his toes inside the cross rod at the head of the bed; he grasped
  the cross rod at the foot of the bed; and in that manner he was able, with a
  great effort, to heave himself up until his back touched the springs.</p>

  <p>He saw the slender, pointed toes of the boots of the great Rutherford
  approach, shining like quicksilver. The boots paused. There was the deadly
  gleam of a Colt six-gun beneath the hanging edge of the coverlet. Then he saw
  the shadow of Rutherford sweep over the floor as he bent down.</p>

  <p>He tensed himself to receive the shock of the bullet.</p>

  <p>Instead, Rutherford straightened again, and walked back across the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "I'm sorry that I've bothered you, Esther. In a time like
  this, with a fellow such as Silver in the offing, I have to take precautions.
  You understand that?"</p>

  <p>She failed to answer. And he laughed as he said:</p>

  <p>"You look as though a glance under your bed was worse than murder, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>He went out; the door closed; and Silver relaxed once more on the floor
  beneath the bed.</p>

  <p>He could not believe his escape. His brain was still spinning with the
  sensation of imminent death, as he watched the feet of the girl go stumbling
  to a chair into which she fell.</p>

  <p>He whispered. There was no answer for a long moment.</p>

  <p>Then, very dimly, from the outside of the house he heard a man exclaiming:
  "He's a regular Robinson Crusoe, old Slim is. He seen a footprint in the dust
  and he went and raised hell about it, was what he did. Good old Slim, he's
  the kind of a gent that don't let none of the small change slip."</p>

  <p>There was laughter, after this, and then the small voice of the girl close
  to Silver murmured:</p>

  <p>"We're saved, Jim Silver."</p>

  <p>Silver slid out from beneath the bed and got to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You'll be safe here," she said. Her face was shining. "And in the morning
  when they start the herd, you can get out of the house with no trouble at
  all."</p>

  <p>Out of the distance, as though fulfilling a part of her words, he heard
  the bawling of cattle.</p>

  <p>"And Danny?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>The joy was struck out of her face. But she shook her head, answering:
  "You've tried to do more than any other man in the world would try. You can't
  do more. You've got to hide and be quiet."</p>

  <p>He looked at the narrow windows.</p>

  <p>There was no way through them, of course. There was no possible exit from
  the room except down the narrow, squeaking stairway. But he was determined,
  in some manner, to get to Danny Farrel on this night.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing more you can do," whispered the girl urgently. "Don't try
  anything."</p>

  <p>"I've got to think," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He sat down in a chair, made a cigarette, remembered himself, and dropped
  the makings of it into his pocket. There was a wall of darkness before his
  brain, and it would not lift.</p>

  <p>He looked at the girl.</p>

  <p>She had grown older. She had been very pretty, before, but she was almost
  ugly, now, to the eye. What she had gained for Silver was a touch of inward
  beauty. If she were doddering in wrinkled age, she would never be less than
  beautiful to him, knowing what he knew of her.</p>

  <p>And he whispered to her suddenly: "I think that I'll have luck. I don't
  know how. But I think that I'll have luck."</p>

  <p>One of the cow-punchers on guard outside the house began to sing loudly.
  Another sentinel exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Shut up! Don'tcha know some of the boys are tryin' to get a wink of sleep
  now?"</p>

  <p>Silver stood up from the chair. He took the hand of the girl in
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a noise," he told her. "I understand what I'm about. Nobody
  can do anything without luck, anyway, and I'm just going to ask for an extra
  slice of luck now."</p>

  <p>Then he opened the door and looked down into the black well of the
  hallway.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; RUTHERFORD'S OPINION</h2>

  <p class="first">The girl came after him. She dared not so much as whisper,
  now that the door of her room was open, but she grasped his arm with both
  hands.</p>

  <p>He removed her grip and closed the door in her face. Then he lay down on
  his side, close to the wall, and began to work his way down the stairs, feet
  first. In that way, his weight was distributed over a number of the steps. He
  was close to the wall where his poundage would exercise the least leverage on
  the supporting brackets. And so, inch by inch, he wormed his way down toward
  the hall below.</p>

  <p>He was nearly to the bottom when a door swung open, a broad flash of light
  entered the hall and streamed into the eyes of Silver. On the threshold stood
  Red, the light glancing through his tousled hair. After a moment he closed
  the door softly.</p>

  <p>What had he heard to bring him there? What had he seen when he looked
  through?</p>

  <p>Silver, standing now on the floor of the hall with a gun in each hand,
  waited breathlessly, but he heard no alarm given, no lifting of voices, no
  scurrying of quick feet. Red, it seemed, had seen nothing. Once more it was
  proved that a man sees only what he expects to see, and a man prone on the
  stairs was not what a man expects to see.</p>

  <p>Silver went to the door of that room which he had used for lounging while
  he was in the house. The voices inside were those of Waring, Delgas,
  Rutherford, and young Danny Farrel.</p>

  <p>They were still talking about the print of the naked foot, with Waring
  saying:</p>

  <p>"The way I aim to live, gents, I don't get no dyspepsia about things that
  don't bother me none and ain't in my way. If there was ten thousand
  footprints in the dust and a chance to grab ten bucks off a table, I'd take
  the ten bucks and let the ten thousand footprints go."</p>

  <p>Delgas laughed at this viewpoint, heartily.</p>

  <p>"I say the same," said he.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Farrel," said Rutherford. "You're a lad with a brain. Whatever
  you think, you can't help your partner, Silver. Suppose you tell me what you
  think made that footprint."</p>

  <p>"One of your own men trying to string the rest of you along," said Farrel
  instantly.</p>

  <p>"You're all against me then," answered Rutherford. "And I'll tell you what
  I think."</p>

  <p>"Blaze away," said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Rutherford, "that Jim Silver made the mark."</p>

  <p>"Hey!" said Delgas. "Watcha mean, Harry? You mean that Jim Silver's been
  that close to the house and not come inside? What kind of reason have you got
  for it, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I know something about Silver," said Rutherford. "I have to study fellows
  like that. And it's an old saying with every man West of the Mississippi who
  has to live by his wits that it's better to have a sheriff and his posse
  after you than it is to have Jim Silver on your trail. I've thought that I'd
  always be clever enough to keep out of his way&mdash;but this time he's after
  me!"</p>

  <p>"You don't like it, Harry, do you?" asked Waring.</p>

  <p>"I hate it like the devil," answered Rutherford frankly.</p>

  <p>"Got the wind up?" asked Waring, chuckling.</p>

  <p>"I have," said Rutherford. "So would the rest of you, if you had any
  sense."</p>

  <p>"Go on, brother, and clear that up for us," suggested Delgas. "Why ain't
  we got any sense?"</p>

  <p>"Because if you knew Silver, you'd be as sure as I am that he left that
  footprint behind him."</p>

  <p>"Go on and open up," urged Waring.</p>

  <p>"Silver's like a sailor," said Rutherford. "When there's dangerous work
  ahead, he likes to go at it with bare feet. Bare feet are the best on a
  slippery deck. They're more silent than shoes, too."</p>

  <p>"They ain't so good in a fire." Waring chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Silver's are," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," broke in Delgas. "You mean, Harry, that Silver has the
  habit of going around in bare feet when he's about to raise the devil?"</p>

  <p>"If he's going to enter a house where he wants to be as quiet as a moving
  shadow&mdash;yes, he'd be in bare feet."</p>

  <p>"But he's not in the house, Harry."</p>

  <p>"That's what you say."</p>

  <p>"Why, man," said Waring, "ain't we looked the place over from head to
  heel? We ain't seen a thing!"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," echoed Delgas. "Not a thing, and I looked over every inch
  of the house myself."</p>

  <p>"Nobody has seen anything," answered Rutherford. "Nobody saw a man come up
  to the house. There were four guards out there and plenty of lantern light.
  But one minute that dust was clear, except for horse tracks, and the next
  minute, there's the print of a naked foot. Do you think it was a ghost that
  made the mark, Delgas?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said Delgas. "It beats me, is what it does."</p>

  <p>"Somebody came up to this house and made that mark before he got through
  the window&mdash;or climbed up to the roof!</p>

  <p>"Aye, the roof!" cried Delgas. "I never thought of that!"</p>

  <p>"I did, though," said Rutherford. "I thought of the roof and ran a ladder
  up and climbed up to the top, but there's nothing to see on the top of the
  house."</p>

  <p>"He's not on the roof, and he's not in the house. And if he came up and
  made his mark in the dust, then he went off again the same way he came," said
  Delgas. "That's the long and the short of it."</p>

  <p>"It's the long of it and the wrong of it," answered Rutherford. "A fellow
  like Silver went through a lot of danger to get that close to the house, and
  he wouldn't turn away again before he'd accomplished something. You fellows
  ought to see that."</p>

  <p>"I don't get what you're drivin' at. You have me beat," said Waring. "It
  kind of sounds like geometry to me, and I never was no good in funny things
  like that."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Delgas, "let Harry blaze away and tell us what's what. He'll
  be talkin' about ghosts walkin', before long. Even Harry can be wrong, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>"You think that Silver is a ghost?" asked Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"I don't say that I think that," answered Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Rutherford, "I can't tell you any more reasons, unless you
  count the feeling in my marrow bones as a reason, but I'll tell you that I'm
  sure that Jim Silver is in this house at this moment!"</p>

  <p>"Hi!" yelled Waring.</p>

  <p>Somebody started up out of a chair and crossed the room with heavy steps
  and stood at the door.</p>

  <p>"You mean that, Harry?" said Delgas. "What makes you say so?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you my reasons, and you say they're no good. I say that Jim
  Silver made that print in the dust, and that Jim Silver made that print just
  before he slipped through the open window into the house. We searched the
  place and we couldn't find him, any more than our guards outside were able to
  see him walk right up to the house through the lantern light. But in spite of
  that, he's somewhere in this house."</p>

  <p>"Where?" shouted Delgas.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Outside that door, perhaps&mdash;from the feeling that's
  inside my spine!" said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Doggone if it don't begin to scare me&mdash;it's a regular ghost story!"
  exclaimed Waring. "It makes me sweat, though I feel pretty cold. Is that
  fellow in on it? Farrel, have you got a hand in this?"</p>

  <p>"How could he have a hand in it?" asked Delgas. "Waring, you're
  nutty."</p>

  <p>"What Harry says is enough to make any man nutty," cried Waring. "We been
  over this place with a fine-toothed comb, and now we start in talkin' about
  ghosts. I ain't no hero even when it comes to fightin' men, and I lay off
  when it comes to ghosts. I don't want no part of 'em!"</p>

  <p>"If you got this idea in your head," said Delgas, "what you want us to do
  about it, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Rutherford. "We've got the house guarded. There's
  nobody asleep except in the bunk house, and they're ready to turn out and
  ride at any minute. I don't very well know what more we can do."</p>

  <p>"Except to keep our eyes open," suggested Delgas.</p>

  <p>"That's it," said Rutherford. "We've got to keep on the alert, my
  friends."</p>

  <p>"It makes me nervous, though," said Waring. "Delgas, get away from that
  door. You act like you was afraid that somebody would walk in through it. If
  Jim Silver can do what you gents say, he don't need to open the door. He'll
  slide in through the keyhole, and turn out of a mist into a man, like they do
  in the fairy tales."</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" said Delgas. "I dunno."</p>

  <p>The door jerked open so rapidly that the gesture was almost too fast for
  Jim Silver, even. He had barely time to snatch out a revolver as the door
  pulled wide and Delgas stood scowling on the threshold.</p>

  <p>Silver beat the heavy butt of a revolver into the center of that scowl. As
  Delgas fell senseless on his back, Silver stepped over the body and took the
  remaining pair under the muzzles of his guns.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; A BEATEN CREW</h2>

  <p class="first">Rutherford's first gesture was a flick of the fingers that
  nearly touched the handles of his gun beneath his coat. But his thought was
  faster still. It saw that he was well-covered, and his second thought brought
  the hand away again. He sat leaning forward a little in his chair, looking
  not at the leveled Colt but into the steady, gleaming eyes of Silver. They
  were worth seeing. A changing yellow light glowed and sank and rose again in
  them.</p>

  <p>Big Waring had got his hand as far as the gun on his hip, and there his
  grasp froze.</p>

  <p>It was strange that a face could change so suddenly. All his jowls and the
  hanging flap of the flesh beneath his chin were struck stone-white, and all
  about his mouth was white, too. His upper lip began to work. And his great
  red nose stood out like a thing painted with blood, and his eyes were as
  bright as the eyes of a hawk. One could tell by the look of them that the
  spirit in the man was greater than any professions he made of courage.
  Whatever his faults were, he was a fighting machine.</p>

  <p>"Here we are again," said Silver.</p>

  <p>He kicked the door shut behind him.</p>

  <p>"Stand up and come over here, Danny," he commanded.</p>

  <p>Farrel rose. He was shaking from head to foot. He was the only man in the
  room who seemed close to a break-down.</p>

  <p>"Don't get between me and either of them," said Silver.</p>

  <p>Farrel edged around the wall as though a great fire were blazing in the
  center of the room. He had to take short steps because of the rope that was
  fastened about his knees. His hands were tied behind his back.</p>

  <p>"You two," said Silver, "turn and face the wall."</p>

  <p>He added: "Hoist your hands, first. And see that the hand you lift from
  that hip is empty, Waring. I'm watching you a little harder than I'm watching
  Rutherford, in case you're in doubt about it."</p>

  <p>Starting to turn, Waring and Rutherford looked at one another. They paused
  and seemed to consult with glances. Then they kept on turning until they were
  facing the wall. They lifted their hands high above their heads and stood
  rigid. The tail of Waring's coat was hitched up almost to the small of his
  back, and his big-handled revolver showed.</p>

  <p>Silver said: "I'm going to shift one gun into my pocket and keep you
  fellows covered with the right-hand gun only. If you want to try a sudden
  break, that'll be your opportunity."</p>

  <p>He slipped one gun down between his legs, as he spoke. A shudder went
  through the body of Waring. Rutherford, who seemed to read the mind of his
  companion, barked suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Waring. You'll get the pair of us killed out of hand,
  the first thing you know."</p>

  <p>So Waring stood fast, but the noise of his heavy breathing was loud
  through the room.</p>

  <p>Silver took out a knife, pressed the spring that made the blade fly out,
  and, without taking his eyes from his double target, found the ropes that
  tied the hands of Dan Farrel.</p>

  <p>When Farrel was free, he snatched the knife from Silver, cut the tie rope
  that bound his knees together, and leaned over Delgas.</p>

  <p>"This fellow first, Jim?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Take him first," agreed Silver.</p>

  <p>He gave one glance downward to the bleeding face of Delgas. It sagged as
  though the blow on the forehead had smashed all the other bones of the
  countenance so that the features were as soft as putty.</p>

  <p>Farrel threw the man's coat open and took away the guns from the holsters
  beneath the pits of the arms. He took a bit of the rope which had been used
  on him and trussed Delgas hand and foot. The fallen man was coming to. He
  breathed like one out of breath after being in water, making a heavy puffing
  sound.</p>

  <p>Still his eyes were not open when Farrel left him and went across the room
  to the other pair. They had not stirred. Only, as the shadow of Farrel swept
  across the wall, Waring said half aloud:</p>

  <p>"Somebody gets it, for this."</p>

  <p>His big, fat body was still quivering. His pretended humility left him. He
  was the fighting beast pure and simple, overlaid with certain layers of
  blubber.</p>

  <p>Farrel got the guns, and from Waring a long, straight-bladed knife that
  could apparently be used for throwing as well as for handwork.</p>

  <p>After that, he procured more rope and made the two fast. He had finished
  that task and armed himself with a pair of guns when the voice of Red came
  down the hallway, softly singing. His hand fell with a respectful knock at
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Come!" called Silver.</p>

  <p>The door opened, with the voice of Red coming cheerfully through the gap
  before the way was clear to his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The herds are coming up," he said, "and we're ready to start running 'em
  at the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had the door open by this time. He could see his three leaders
  helplessly tied, and the guns of Silver were hardly a yard from his breast.
  He put out his head in a queer way, like a rooster stretching his neck before
  crowing. Then he began to hoist his hands. They were level with his shoulders
  before Silver said:</p>

  <p>"You see the lay of the land, brother?"</p>

  <p>Red nodded convulsively.</p>

  <p>And he whispered immediately afterward, under his breath: "I had the hunch
  right from the start. I had the hunch that I wouldn't be able to push the
  thing through. I knew from the start that the crooks would go down&mdash;fool
  that I am!"</p>

  <p>"Jim, don't do him any harm," said Danny Farrel.</p>

  <p>He moved up a hand toward his own bruised face.</p>

  <p>"Except for Red, I'd have every bone in my body broken," said Farrel. "I'd
  be dead by this time, I guess, or worse than dead, if Delgas had had his way
  with me, but Red stood in between."</p>

  <p>"Did he?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>His cold eye ran slowly over the body and then over the face, over the
  frightened, staring soul of the cow-puncher.</p>

  <p>"Talk up for yourself, Red," said Silver. "Any reason why you shouldn't go
  where the other three are going?"</p>

  <p>Red started to speak, thought better of it, locked his jaws. He thrust out
  his head still farther and looked Silver suddenly in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"You go to the devil," said Red.</p>

  <p>At that, Silver laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not going to make any excuses, Red?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The thick shoulders of the cow-puncher shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Silver, "I'll tell you what. You just ease yourself outside
  the door and go tell the other boys that the game's up. We've got the three
  of 'em. We've got them, but if the rest of the boys want to take their horses
  and high-tail out of these diggings, nobody will stop 'em. Understand?"</p>

  <p>Red nodded.</p>

  <p>"Get out!" commanded Silver.</p>

  <p>Red hesitated one longer moment. Then he backed through the door with his
  hands still held high. He kept on backing till the dark of the hall was about
  to swallow him, and Silver slammed and locked the door in his face.</p>

  <p>He turned and sat down.</p>

  <p>Delgas woke up with a start and began to babble: "Come on, boys! Come on!
  Down with 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up," said Rutherford. "Don't you know you're licked with the
  rest of us?"</p>

  <p>Delgas sat up, and started at Silver.</p>

  <p>"It's no good," he said. "You done some mind reading, Harry&mdash;and
  Silver was in the house all the time."</p>

  <p>"Sure he was in the house," snarled Rutherford.</p>

  <p>Waring sank his big chin on his chest and stared down at the table. His
  rage had not grown less. When his eyes stirred, they showed smoking fire.</p>

  <p>"Beaten," he said, "like three curs."</p>

  <p>"It looks to me as though we can send you fellows up for close to life,"
  Silver said. "Cattle rustling doesn't go down very well in this state."</p>

  <p>Rutherford was staring at Silver in silence. His eyes could not move from
  the face of the big man.</p>

  <p>But Delgas said: "We'll find our way out of that."</p>

  <p>"It looks to me," said Silver, "that we can make some sort of an agreement
  out of this thing."</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by a sudden outburst of yelling from the men beyond the
  house. Some one fired three shots through the outer wall of the rooms and
  roared:</p>

  <p>"Rutherford! Rutherford! Speak up and let's know the truth about it!"</p>

  <p>"Hello!" called Rutherford calmly. "That you, Lefty?"</p>

  <p>"It's me, and what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Rutherford. Lefty was still.</p>

  <p>"I'm tied hand and foot," said Rutherford. He took out the words one by
  one, like a showman exhibiting his wares. The deliberation with which he
  spoke was apparently a sign of the exquisite agony of shame which he was
  enduring. He could not grow paler, because his face was normally as pale as a
  bone, but his mouth kept working slightly at the corners.</p>

  <p>"You're tied hand and foot?" howled Lefty. "Where's Delgas then? Is what
  Red tells us the straight of it?"</p>

  <p>"Red tells you the straight," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>A torrent of cursing came from Lefty, who finished: "What's happened?"</p>

  <p>"I've been a fool," said Rutherford. "I've been handled like a baby.
  There's nothing I can do. You boys take care of yourselves, because Jim
  Silver has won once more!"</p>

  <p>Lefty departed. He bade no farewell, but his going was announced by the
  diminishing volume of his voice as he went off, cursing at every step. A
  moment later, with a wild whooping, the whole body of the cow-punchers
  started to circle the house, and the louder they yelled, the faster they
  fired their revolvers into the building.</p>

  <p>Nearly every one of the bullets ranged through the house from side to
  side. One struck the table and split it clear across. Another peeled a great
  splinter off the floor, slapping it up against the wall. Another smashed the
  knob of the door, striking out a chime as if from a bell. Still another slug
  took the hat off Waring's head.</p>

  <p>Danny Farrel shrank into a corner. It was notable that not one of the
  other four so much as stirred in his place. Silver occupied himself, during
  the uproar, with making a cigarette for Delgas. He put it between the lips of
  Delgas and lighted it. Delgas nodded his thanks as the horde of cow-punchers
  and ex-convicts ran yelling off across the desert.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Silver, "we can talk business now. The boys have gone.
  Waring, I suppose you're the most poisonous of the gang. We'll take enough of
  your money to pay for as many steers of mine as are missing, but I don't
  think we'll take your scalp. Rutherford, you and Delgas have one easy way
  out. You've tried to do more harm, here, than you've managed to wangle,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A door slammed. The steps and the voice of the girl rapidly approached the
  room.</p>

  <p>Silver's nerves for the first time showed that they were ragged. He jerked
  a thumb over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Go and stop that noise!" he commanded Farrel.</p>

  <p>Dan Farrel left the room. As he opened the door, Silver could hear the
  girl crying out in a frenzied panic.</p>

  <p>The door shut, and Silver sighed with relief. He found that Waring was
  looking at him with a queer, twisted smile.</p>

  <p>"You don't like the females, Silver, eh?" he asked. "Maybe not," answered
  Silver.</p>

  <p>"That's a weakness," said Waring. "And I'm glad to know that you've got
  one. But, believe me, brother, the bigger you are and the longer you take,
  the harder you'll fall for 'em, one of these days. Go on and talk your
  business. I've lost a lot on this job, and I'm going to call myself lucky to
  get out without losing more blood than dollars."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE HAND FROM THE GRAVE</h2>

  <p class="first">The end of the thing was in sight. Silver was quick about
  it. He merely said: "Delgas, you and Rutherford got in on this thing for
  nothing. It was Steve Wycombe's idea to hook the three of us. Well, you
  almost snagged me, and just slipped up."</p>

  <p>"Where were you?" said Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Hanging onto the rods under the girl's bed," said Silver, and smiled on
  them.</p>

  <p>They heard in silence. Rutherford swayed his pale face from side to
  side.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said Delgas. "All the big things come easy."</p>

  <p>"Now, then," said Silver, "I've plenty of stuff on you, out of this deal.
  I can have you sent up. But I'm giving you a break."</p>

  <p>"Show me the break, and then I'll believe it," answered Delgas.</p>

  <p>"Listen and learn," said Silver calmly. "Delgas, all you need to do is to
  sign a little paper that I'll draw up for you. That paper deeds your share of
  the ranch to Danny Farrel. Understand?"</p>

  <p>"Hey," said Delgas, "why should I deed my share to that bum. He ain't the
  one that handed me the rap! Deed it to you, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"To Farrel," said Silver. "Except for him, the job would never have gone
  through."</p>

  <p>He himself sat down at the table and took pen and paper. Rapidly he wrote,
  in a hand strangely small and swiftly flowing. When he had ended, he passed
  the paper to Delgas.</p>

  <p>"How does that sound to you?" Silver asked.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I'll sign," said Delgas. "Same for Harry?"</p>

  <p>"Ask him," said Silver.</p>

  <p>"Same for you, Harry?" asked Delgas.</p>

  <p>Rutherford merely smiled. "The big hombre knows me better than I thought,"
  he declared.</p>

  <p>"What's that mean?" asked Delgas. "Have I gone and missed anything? I
  won't sign, then. I ain't signed it yet, anyway."</p>

  <p>"You'll sign, you flat-faced fool!" said Rutherford. "I mean, the big boy
  knows what's in my mind. I don't take anything but lead from him."</p>

  <p>Silver opened the door and called. Danny Farrel answered at once with a
  joyous voice, and the girl's cry of triumph joined with the sound.</p>

  <p>"Danny," Silver said, "get a pair of horses. Put Esther on one of 'em, and
  clear out. Don't come back to this place before morning. Stay five mile away
  from it, unless you want to take a chance on your hide. Get out fast."</p>

  <p>The girl's voice began to protest, but Farrel could be heard to say:</p>

  <p>"Whatever he says is good enough for me. Come on. We'll ride when Silver
  tells us to."</p>

  <p>"I dunno what the gag is," said Delgas, agape.</p>

  <p>Waring had closed his eyes. The motion of his lower jaw against his chest
  made his head sway up and down.</p>

  <p>"They're going to have it out, first," he said. "They're going to shoot it
  out, brother. Those two hombres ain't made to live and circulate. Not on one
  little earth like this. The continents is too frequent, and the oceans is
  just wet places to step across, for birds like them."</p>

  <p>"I guess we can agree, Harry," Silver said.</p>

  <p>"I guess we can," said Rutherford. "I'll sign if you'll fight for it
  afterward, Silver."</p>

  <p>"I'll fight for it," said Jim Silver.</p>

  <p>He sat down to write, once more, and completed the second paper, by which
  Mr. Harry Rutherford legally transferred his rights to the Wycombe ranch to
  Daniel Farrel. When he had ended, he took two revolvers, laid one at each end
  of the table, and set Rutherford free from the ropes. He kept a gun in his
  hand until Rutherford had signed his name.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing," said Waring, as he looked on. "Now you've done the job for
  him, he could let the daylight into you, Harry."</p>

  <p>"He's an honorable man, though," answered Rutherford. His malice twisted
  his smile as he flung the pen down on the floor.</p>

  <p>"What happens?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Go back to that opposite wall," said Silver.</p>

  <p>Rutherford went back to the opposite wall. Silver faced him. The table was
  exactly between them, and in front of each, a stride away, was a loaded
  gun.</p>

  <p>"Stand a few inches away from the wall," said Silver.</p>

  <p>Rutherford obeyed.</p>

  <p>"That's to even things up," said Silver. "I'm taller than you are and I
  could reach farther. Now, Harry, I'll just toss this gun aside, and when I do
  that, we'll both go for the guns. Is that right?"</p>

  <p>"Right!" said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>He looked aside at Waring, and then he said: "Silver, killing you is going
  to be the sweetest thing in my life!" He had put so much passion into the
  words that his breath was exhausted. He drew it in again with a drinking
  sound. And his eyes devoured Silver. His head was back. The eyelids were half
  lowered. He had almost the look of a man staring at a thing of surpassing
  beauty. There was the same sort of a smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" asked Silver.</p>

  <p>"Ready," said Rutherford.</p>

  <p>"Are you on edge?"</p>

  <p>"On edge!"</p>

  <p>"Then go!" said Silver, and threw his gun aside.</p>

  <p>He leaped for the other weapon at the same instant, and saw the flash of
  Rutherford's hand, bright with speed like a bit of metal.</p>

  <p>Then, before Silver's eyes, he saw the table heel over and the Colt spill
  off to the side. It was Waring, who with his long leg had managed to reach
  the foot of the table and hook it suddenly toward him, spilling both weapons
  at Rutherford and away from Silver.</p>

  <p>He saw Rutherford bending, picking a falling gun out of the air. But
  Silver did not dodge. He went straight on, and with the lift of his shoulder
  caught the edge of the table, hurling it before him right at Harry
  Rutherford.</p>

  <p>Catching the gun from the air with unfailing hand, Rutherford had tried a
  snap shot even before he straightened his body. The bullet slit open the
  shirt along Silver's left side. Then, with his bulk behind it, the table
  crashed against Rutherford.</p>

  <p>The gun spoke again, but there was no whir of a bullet in the air. Waring
  was up, kicking at Silver with his spurs, using them as a game-cock fights.
  But Silver, bare-footed and swift as a cat, was on the other side of the
  table in an instant and had caught up a fallen Colt&mdash;his own. One
  gesture with that gun sent Waring crowding back into a corner.</p>

  <p>Most of the body of Rutherford was hidden under the table, but his head
  and shoulders, jammed up against the wall, were visible. He had both arms
  pinned down, and he was not struggling to get free. Something about the eyes
  of the man told Silver just what had happened.</p>

  <p>He jerked the table away and saw on the breast of Rutherford the spreading
  red stain of the blood. As the table struck him, a bullet from his own gun
  had penetrated his body. No doctor on earth would be able to heal that wound.
  Still, with a nerveless hand, he was trying to pick up the fallen revolver
  from the floor, but the weight of it slid through his fingers.</p>

  <p>Rutherford began to smile.</p>

  <p>"Poor Steve Wycombe thought he could make it three for one," said he
  huskily. "But the poor devil was out of luck. He only got an even break. He
  only got&mdash;me!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to nod a confirmation of his last words, but Silver knew that
  the head would never lift again. He picked up the body. It was hardly more
  heavy than the body of a child. Silver laid it straight on the floor and
  closed the eyes. He stood up and turned to Waring. Delgas, all this while,
  had sat entranced. Events had moved a little too fast for his
  comprehension.</p>

  <p>"I ought to put you there beside him on the floor," said Silver to Waring.
  "But you've a little too old. Besides, I need you for a witness, on both
  those little documents. But the law will do the rest of the talking to you,
  partner. You're old enough to need a rest, and the state will take care of
  you free of charge."</p>

  <p>That was how Steve Wycombe finished off his deal. He had, most surely, put
  a hand from the grave and taken one living man from the face of the earth.
  Delgas, a discredited man among his own kind, was turned loose; and Waring
  went up for a long term.</p>

  <p>As for Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Farrel, they wanted Jim Silver to stay on with
  them indefinitely because, as Farrel said, he would never consider that two
  thirds of the ranch really belonged to him. He was really holding it merely
  in trust for Silver. They followed Silver as far as the corner of the corral
  and watched him saddle Parade and mount, and still they poured out
  arguments.</p>

  <p>Silver looked down at them and smiled. He had said good-by before.</p>

  <p>"I can't stay," he said. "I'm awash with cash that needs spending.
  Besides, it's not the sort of a place for me."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Farrel. "You stay here for a while, Jim, and you'll love
  it the way I do. Those three mountains will be like three friendly faces to
  you, every day of your life. What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"It's the air," said Jim Silver. "There's too much honesty in it, now, and
  not enough action." He smiled, and added: "You see, when I came here, it was
  simply as a prospector in a land of trouble, with the chance of a rich strike
