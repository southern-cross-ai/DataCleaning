<p><b>THE SCENE.</b><br>
<br>
A Broadcasting Station. Part, it not all, back of stage is draped.
Standing at centre back is a large property radio. Behind it and
the drapes, and so unseen by the audience, are the actors and the
gramophone to provide effects when the radio is supposedly turned
on. Right and left, towards rear, green baize swing doors. Across
one corner, but standing well out from it, is a luxurious settee.
Down front, a bit to one side, is the microphone. Above it is the
signal light.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>As the curtain rises Mr Blatant, a flashily-dressed stout man,
comes in from right and is crossing smartly to the door at left
when he suddenly halts, as though remembering something, retraces
his steps to door at right, opens it and shouts off:</p>

<p>BLATANT. Hi, Miss Typer, let me know the minute Nooera shows
up.</p>

<p><i>[He is hurrying left again and has almost reached the door
when Miss Typer comes in from right. She is smart, pretty and
diffident.</i>
</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. Excuse me, Mr Blatant&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT <i>(halting impatiently)</i>. Well?</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. I'm sorry, but I didn't catch the name you said.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>turning</i>). Nooera. N-E-W, Noo. E-R-A, era.
Nooera. I'm expecting him any minute.</p>

<p>MISS TYPER (<i>gasping</i>). Not&mdash;not David Newera.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>smiling</i>). Yep. David Nooera, the masculine
Venus, the wonder boy, the specimen that's got 'em all talking.</p>

<p>MISS TYPER (<i>overwhelmed</i>). Do you mean he is coming here
to broadcast? Here?</p>

<p>BLATANT. Yep.</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. But I thought&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. We've changed all that. He broadcasts from this
stoodio&mdash;right here.</p>

<p>MISS TYPER (<i>closing her eyes</i>). Then I'll see him.
(<i>Opens eyes</i>) Oh, but he can't possibly be all they say...no
one could. (<i>Going to the door</i>) I suppose he'll be just
another advertisement. (<i>Goes out</i>)</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>bellowing after her</i>). Here, can that talk...it
ain't loyal.</p>

<p>[<i>Once more he makes for the door at left, but is again
halted, this time by the entrance of a gangling youth of seventeen
who dashes in from right, brandishing a manuscript.</i></p>

<p>MISS TYPER (<i>calling</i>). Mr Blatant&mdash;Mr Blatant!</p>

<p>[<i>The manager turns impatiently.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT. Well!</p>

<p>JIMMY (<i>in a rush</i>). I've been looking for you everywhere
to ask you&mdash;(<i>Pauses self-consciously</i>)</p>

<p>BLATANT. Spill it.</p>

<p>JIMMY. I&mdash;I was hoping to get your opinion on this advertising
copy I've been writing for you.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Why didn't you leave it on my desk?</p>

<p>JIMMY. I did Mr Blatant, for two days&mdash;but you didn't read
it.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Where is it now?</p>

<p>JIMMY. Here, sir.</p>

<p>[<i>The copy-writer hands the script to the manager, who sits,
scans it hurriedly, a dark frown gathering on his face.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT. Jimmy, Jimmy, this copy of yours won't do at all.</p>

<p>JIMMY. Which one is that, Mr Blatant, the one for the hair,
teeth, or breath?</p>

<p>BLATANT. All of 'em.</p>

<p>JIMMY (<i>disappointed</i>). Oh! (<i>Quickly</i>) But I said the
hair lotion contained the brighter brilliantine, had hygienic and
restorative properties, and that the powder&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>slapping his knee</i>). Yep! Yep! Yep! But they can
read all that on the bottle, the tube and the carton when, and
<i>if</i>, they buy 'em. What your copy has to do is to force them
to buy</p>

<p>JIMMY. Force? You mean <i>persuade</i>, don't you, Mr
Blatant?</p>

<p>BLATANT. I said force, and I mean force.</p>

<p>JIMMY. Er&mdash;not physical force?</p>

<p>BLATANT. Nerts&mdash;you could deal with only half-a-dozen or so
prospective customers <i>thata</i> way. But with mental force you
contact thousands, millions, thousands of millions. Now, what's the
greatest force in the world today?</p>

<p>JIMMY. Er&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. Snap into it.</p>

<p>JIMMY. Er&mdash;wait jiff.</p>

<p>BLATANT. K.Y.J.&mdash;Know your Job. The greatest force in the world
today is <i>fear</i>, of course. You've gotta appeal to the fears
of the listeners. Rub off their starch&mdash;get beneath their
skin&mdash;touch 'em on the raw! Appeal to their inferiority
complex&mdash;they've all got one. Appeal to their frustrated and
repressed emotions-they're all volcanic with them. (<i>Looking at
papers</i>) Now looka here at this ballyhoo of yours for powder.
Whata you expect that to do when it's read over the air?</p>

<p>JIMMY (<i>near tears</i>). But I said they could see it's
got&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>roaring</i>). Forget it. It's not what they
<i>see</i> but what they <i>feel</i> makes the sales. Anyway if
they could see at all they'd see there ain't a cockroach's whisker
between one powder and the next. But feeling's
<i>different</i>&mdash;that's where fear takes the big punch. And you
gotta learn how to deliver it. You gotta make them million little
shop-girls and stenographers fear that unless they use Honeymoon
Powder, <i>their</i> chances of a honeymoon, orange-blossom and
happiness are N-I-X, nix. Make each girl feel a lemon; tell her
she'll never be the apple of a man's eye, or one of a pair,
<i>unless</i>!!! Show her lonely in a penthouse, and finally in a
pauper's grave, because she lacked P. and I. Perspicacity and
initiative to use the one-and-only,
cure-for-the-lonely&mdash;<i>Hon-ee-moon Pow-der!</i></p>

<p>JIMMY. Oh!</p>

<p>BLATANT. Are you catching the idea?</p>

<p>JIMMY (<i>admiringly</i>). Well, Mr Blatant, you make it sound
so marvellous; I mean so swell, so grand.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>pained</i>). Grandiose, Jimmy, grandiose. Never use
grand where you can use grandiose, and never use grandiose when you
can use stoopendous or colossal. In America we useda use "grand"
way back in the dim agags&mdash;it's not noo, Jimmy; it's not modern.
The word's strictly dated, outmoded. It's debunked, liquidated,
it's&mdash;</p>

<p>JIMMY (<i>in haste to stem the flow</i>). Oh, Mr Blatant, I
meant to tell you, we've received a letter from a chemist saying he
has analysed the products we advertise and that none of them can do
what we say they do; he says that the hair restorer couldn't grow
hair on a Fijian, and that the face-cream&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. It ain't the product&mdash;it's the way it's presented gets
results. Gee, here I've been telling you&mdash;</p>

<p>JIMMY. But, Mr Blatant, what I mean is, if that sort of thing
gets around, sales will fall off and then we&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>booming</i>). It won't get around. Nobody listens to
analysts. What is an analyst anyway? Just a guy green with envy coz
he ain't got a racket. Now you've made me go and forget what I was
telling you.</p>

<p>JIMMY (<i>quickly</i>). You were telling me how to appeal to the
public's fear&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. Oh yeah. Well, fear's the touchstone, the electric
button, the fuse that ignites the bomb that blows folks into
action. See? Play on folks' fears and you'll get 'em emoting, get
'em responding, so's they'll give &mdash;<i>give</i> their coin, I mean.
Remember it was our fear-advertising telling girls that a mole any
place is worse than a bunion on your face that sent every dame with
a mole scampering up to pay 7s. 6d. for its removal, even though
the salon was three flights up, and down a back street&mdash;so's they
had practically no rent to pay! <i>There's</i> advertising for you!
Okay?</p>

<p>JIMMY. Okay.</p>

<p>BLATANT. You've gotta thunder the secret that unless&mdash; [<i>He
breaks off as the door at left opens and the typist's head
appears.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT. Well, is the world's wonder here?</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. Not yet, Mr Blatant&mdash;I am just looking for
someone.</p>

<p>BLATANT. You stay put at the desk till he comes. And the split
second he comes, give me the whistle.</p>

<p>MISS TYPER (<i>dutifully</i>). Yes, Mr Blatant.</p>

<p>[<i>She disappears for a moment. The next she is in the room,
shy but excited.</i></p>

<p>MISS TYPER. Excuse me, but oh, Mr Blatant, is Mr Newera really
all his build-up says he is?</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>pompously</i>). He's Australia's, I mean the
world's, most perfect specimen of young manhood.</p>

<p>[<i>Her face lights up. Forgetting her shyness, and herself, she
skips out, singing under her breath.</i></p>

<p>MISS TYPER. The world's most perfect young man&mdash;the world's most
perfect young man&mdash;the world's most perfect&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>The closing door shuts out the rest.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT. Now what was I saying when that swooner crooner
interrupted?</p>

<p>JIMMY. You were saying&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. I was saying you gotta thunder the secret that unless
our listeners use Casteroll's Death-to-Breath Sweet-Pops, their
breath will scatter even their closest pals world wide. Even their
hardiest friends won't stand for it. Make 'em realize that unless&mdash;
(<i>Miss Typer has reappeared, smiling inanely</i>) Well, what
<i>now</i>? Yep, he's got two eyes and wears his nose above his
mouth, in the usual place, and&mdash; (<i>Breaks odd as he sees her rapt
expression</i>)</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. Oh, Mr Blatant, he's here&mdash;I mean Mr Newera's here.
And, oh, Mr Blatant, he's really perfect, just as his publicity
says.</p>

<p>BLATANT. So Lord Godiver's arrived, has he? Well, now I'll have
to go put this paragon over the air.</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. He's in the Green Room, Mr Blatant. We girls were
just saying he won't need any of the lines we advertise. He's oh,
Mr Blatant, Robert Taylor [<i>or the current film heart-throb</i>]
can't hold a candle to him&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. He can lose 'em all, huh?</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. He certainly can, he's&mdash;oh, we girls are just crazy
about him already.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>walking out</i>). Well, let us get a close-up of his
scenery. (<i>Turns back</i>) No, you can show him in here.</p>

<p>MISS TYPER. Yes, Mr Blatant. ( <i>Goes out. walking on
air</i>)</p>

<p>BLATANT. And now, Jimmy, carry on with that copy like I told
you. Don't forget fear's the target to shoot at. Fear takes the big
punch. Fear's the weak spot situated next their pocket. Touch 'em
on it and you have their money in the shop. Alrightee?</p>

<p>JIMMY. Alrightee.</p>

<p>[<i>The door opens and Miss Typer ushers in David and his
refined and scholarly looking tutor. She goes out backwards, her
eyes glued on the almost incredibly handsome David.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT. Howdy, folks.</p>

<p>TUTOR. Mr Blatant? BLATANT. That's me.</p>

<p>[<i>They shake hands.</i></p>

<p>TUTOR. I am Mr Newera's tutor. Allow me to present David
Newera&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. So this is the prize beauty my typist tells me has got
all the girls loco. (<i>Admiringly</i>) Well, I don't want to
flatter, but&mdash;(<i>Guffaws and grasps David's hand, pumping
strenuously</i>)</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>coughs</i>). David, this is Mr Blatant, the manager of
this radio station.</p>

<p>DAVID. How do you do.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Skip it, Jimmy!</p>

<p>[<i>Jimmy has been making a close inspection. He has already
combed his hair to comply with David's hairdo and is now bending to
see his socks. In obedience to the manager's command he jerks
upright and, still gaping, goes out backwards, tripping over his
feet at the door. Blatant looks after hint irritably, then turns to
his guests, rubbing his hands and booming heartily.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT. Well, now, we're all set. It isn't time to announce you
yet, but I'll introduce you round.</p>

<p>DAVID. If you don't mind&mdash;</p>

<p>TUTOR. Er&mdash;David is just a little nervous. You see, its his
first broadcast&mdash;he hasn't even spoken in public yet.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>not impressed</i>). Is that so?</p>

<p>TUTOR. Well, you see he became twenty-one only today. And as you
know, it was his guardian's wish that until he reached his majority
he should live protected from all worldly taint.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Worldly taint!&mdash;You mean broadcasting? Huh, that's a
goody. I must tell the boys thata one.</p>

<p>TUTOR. I was about to say that since the occasion is a somewhat
nerve-racking one for David, perhaps he could stay here until the
actual minute he is to broadcast.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Sure, sure. Make yourself cosy, Mr Newera. There a
radio there you might like to listen to whilst I play y'r theme
music in the other studio. The record to introdooce you, you
know.</p>

<p>DAViD. A radio? (<i>He crosses to it</i>)</p>

<p>BLATANT. Yep. Go ahead. Don't mind anyone&mdash;room is sound
proof.</p>

<p>TUTOR. David has never seen a radio. His education has been most
exclusive.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Exclusive! I'll say&mdash;why it hasn't <i>begun</i> yet.
Turn the dials, Mr Nooera, and be introdooced to the great new
world you live in.</p>

<p>DAVID. Dials? Do you mean these lithe knobs?</p>

<p>BLATANT. Atta boy. I'll take your tootor along with me, and you
can have it all on your lonesome. (<i>Walking out</i>) Coming,
Mr&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

<p>TUTOR. Thank you, Mr Blatant.</p>

<p>[<i>They go out. David is alone with the radio.</i></p>

<p>DAVID (<i>softly</i>). I think I'll turn this knob. Oh, I see,
it controls a silver needle which points to illuminated numerals.
(<i>Blaring jazz comes out of the radio. It quickly dims as he
turns the dial</i>) Oh! What a horrible noise&mdash;something must be
wrong with the instrument. I'll turn the knob again.</p>

<p>[<i>The jazz fades out and a man's voice fades in.</i></p>

<p>COMMERCIAL VOICE (<i>coaxingly</i>). Remember, ladies, though
only a strong woman can lift a man up, even a weak woman can throw
him away. Why be weak? Why throw him away? Why not take that extra
forty minutes over your toilet and make certain of your power to
keep him always?</p>

<p>GENTEEL VOICE. You must use Jungle Soap. No person of
refinement, of charm, chic, allure, of fastidiousness can afford
not to use Jungle Soap.</p>

<p>WOMAN'S VOICE (<i>authoritatively</i>). You <i>must</i> use
Jungle Soap.</p>

<p>MAN'S VOICE (<i>rapidly</i>). Do you wish to be radiant?</p>

<p>GENTEEL VOICE. Compelling&mdash;</p>

<p>WOMAN'S VOICE. Irresistible&mdash;</p>

<p>MAN'S VOICE (<i>high pressure</i>). Then there's only one thing
for you&mdash;</p>

<p>GENTEEL VOICE. One thing to do&mdash;</p>

<p>WOMAN'S VOICE (<i>coaxingly</i>). And you know it's true&mdash;</p>

<p>ALL. USE&mdash;UNGLE&mdash;SOAP!!!</p>

<p>DAVID. Oh! (<i>He turns the knob hurriedly. The radio is
silent</i>) What extraordinary voices&mdash;they oppress Me&mdash;they make
my blood run cold. I'll turn the knob again.</p>

<p>[<i>But all the voices sound as though they have been trained by
Mr Blatant, for they all play on fear.</i></p>

<p>EMOTIONAL VOICE. You may <i>think</i> you are well. But for the
sake of your kidneys, beware of easy illusions. You <i>can't</i> be
well unless you take Mustak. So buy our&mdash;(<i>Fade</i>)</p>

<p>DAVID. Queer! (<i>He turns the dial around slowly</i>)</p>

<p>1ST ANTISEPTIC voter. How are your teeth? Do
you&mdash;(<i>Fade</i>)</p>

<p>2ND VOICE. Do you neglect your hair? Or do you
use&mdash;(<i>Fade</i>)</p>

<p>3RD VOICE. Your hands&mdash;do they repulse people? Then use&mdash;</p>

<p>4TH VOICE. Remember undisinfected breath is social death so
don't forget to use&mdash;</p>

<p>5TH VOICE. Do you keep your pores open by using&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>The dial is turned and there is blessed silence.</i></p>

<p>DAVID (<i>softly</i>). I hadn't dreamed it would be like this.
So this is the world I live in. (<i>Turns dial</i>)</p>

<p>HUSHED INTIMATE VOICE (<i>over radio</i>). There is something
unclean about the human being, something offensive, so that but for
the discoverers of Fumigatoyd, it would be quite impossible for the
sensitive person to mix with his fellows. But for Fumigatoyd the
fate of humanity would indeed be a sorry one. (<i>Alert syncopated
tones</i>) Remember, it's because not even your father, mother,
sister, brother will tell you, that I (<i>Intimate tone</i>) take
it on myself to do so. You are quite unfit, <i>unfit</i> is the
word, to move about amongst your own kind until you are
de-odorized&mdash;shall we say, <i>dehumanized</i>?</p>

<p>VOICE (<i>high pressure</i>). Are you savoury? Are you
approachable? Have you hygienic personality? Have
you&mdash;(<i>Fade</i>)</p>

<p>DAVID (<i>turning off the radio and springing to his feet</i>).
No&mdash;<i>no</i>&mdash;NO!</p>

<p>[<i>He buries his face in his hands, then controls himself as
the door opens and Mr Blatant, followed by the tutor,
enters.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT. Nearly time for you to spruik, Mr Nooera. Your theme
music's playing in the other studio. Would you like to hear
it?&mdash;I'll switch on the radio.</p>

<p>DAVID (<i>involuntarily</i>). No! (<i>More quietly</i>)
Er&mdash;thank you, but I'd rather not.</p>

<p>TUTOR. Are you ready, David?</p>

<p>BLATANT. Stand over here, Mr Nooera. (<i>Propelling him</i>) Not
too close&mdash;don't hug the mike. There, that's it. Now we gotta let
the music finish, then I'll introduce you. (<i>Gets script from
pocket</i>)</p>

<p>TUTOR. How will you know when the music's finished?</p>

<p>BLATANT. When that little light up there pops on, I let her
rip.</p>

<p>TUTOR. You mean the light is a signal for you to speak?</p>

<p>BLATANT. Yep (<i>While the manager and the tutor watch for the
light, David slowly backs his way out of the room</i>) There's the
light now.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>to the mike, honey-sweet, reading from script</i>).
And that music, the March of Progress, listeners, was to introduce
to you David Newera, the most perfect young man of today&mdash;of any
day. David Newera represents a noo era in manhood, in health,
vitality, and idealism. No need to tell you of his history &mdash;you
all know how he seas born. You all know that he is the answer to
the Eugenists' prayer&mdash;that he was bred as carefully as any
racehorse; that he was reared and educated away from the world.
David Newera is as innocent of our way of life as a being from
another planet. For instance, he has never been inside a theatre,
never listened to a radio, never mixed with ordinary folk. There is
much criticism passed on our day and on our way of life today, but
David Newera is the answer to such pessimists, for it can truly be
said that the pinnacle of our commercial and mechanical
civilization has been reached now that we can not only breed but
broadcast a really perfect specimen of the human race. So,
listeners, I now have the honour to present through the courtesy
of&mdash;</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>sotto</i>). We have no sponsor&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. Er&mdash;we present him <i>without</i> courtesy&mdash;I mean,
this young man comes to you purely non-mercenary&mdash;er, that is
through the courtesy of his public-spirited guardians, and their
most laudatory, stupendous, colossal magnanimity and altruism
in&mdash;(<i>Turns, sees David is not there and gesticulates frantically
to the tutor</i>) altruism&mdash;er&mdash;in&mdash;quick, push him on to the mike.
(<i>Aloud</i>) Altruism&mdash;er&mdash;in wanting you to hear what a
really&mdash;(<i>Turns to gesticulate</i>) a really perfect young man
sounds like&mdash;er&mdash;speaking to you in his&mdash;er&mdash;own voice.
(<i>Sotto</i>) Where is he? Fetch him! Fetch him!</p>

<p>[<i>The tutor has been looking wildly around the room. He now
rushes to open the door on right, peers out, and closes it
again.</i></p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>worried</i>). I can't find him.</p>

<p>BLATANT. David Newera is the sensation of the moment&mdash;the
greatest spectacle ever screened&mdash;er&mdash;broadcast. He's terrific in a
positively volcanic way. (<i>Sotto</i>) Where is he?</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>at the other door</i>). I don't know.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Er&mdash;pardon this unavoidable delay. (<i>The human
touch</i>) David Newera is just doing up his&mdash;er&mdash;tying
his&mdash;er&mdash;hair&mdash;I mean&mdash;(<i>Losing his temper</i>) Oh, confound
it!</p>

<p>[<i>He rushes right to pull open the door and yell, "Slam on a
record!" The green light goes out. So does tutor. Blatant walks up
and down, raging.</i></p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>raging</i>). Now. Where's that wise guy? What's he
holding out for? If it's grain, he's getting no dough from me.</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>entering</i>). You know he's broadcasting freely.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Then why the heck don't he broadcast? He's gotta play
ball. Now get <i>that</i>, and get <i>him</i>!</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>helplessly</i>) But I told you&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. <i>Find</i> him&mdash;he cant have flown up the chimney.</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>walking out</i>). Well, I'll look again.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Son-of-a&mdash;&mdash; Thinks he can get me outa here to dictate
terms to me, does he? Well, I don't budge. He'll cone to me. Yes,
siree&mdash;He'll come to me! And whatever it is he wants he don't get
it. Not by a long chalk. (<i>The tutor comes in. He looks like a
dying man</i>) Well, did you find him?</p>

<p>TUTOR. I&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. Well&mdash;well?</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>choking</i>). He&mdash;oh, it's too awful.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Awful's not the word&mdash;but he'll pay for it. Bring him
in. (<i>Suddenly</i>) Here, what's the matter? No, no, you can't
faint in here. Where is he?</p>

<p>TUTOR. I&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p>BLATANT. He can't have vanished out the window.</p>

<p>TUTOR. That's what he did.</p>

<p>BLATANT. <i>What</i>? You mean he&mdash;?</p>

<p>TUTOR. Yes.</p>

<p>BLATANT. Don't say he took the dive&mdash;croaked. Hey, he can't do
that to me. What's his game?</p>

<p>TUTOR. He&mdash;left&mdash;this&mdash;note.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>tense</i>). Read it.</p>

<p>TUTOR (<i>reads slowly and dully</i>). "I realize now why I was
left in this room with this radio. It was in order to have the news
broken to me that I am second-grade and therefore an impostor. But
please believe me when I say that I am an innocent one. I had never
before realized my inferiority. No one had ever hinted my need for
Jungle Soap, Mustak, or Fumigatoyd. I am sorry to disappoint the
world and my kind guardians. But now when I realize I am not as
advertised there is only one thing to do. Yours in despair, David
Newera." (<i>Brokenly</i>) Dead&mdash;this will just about kill his
guardians.</p>

<p>BLATANT (<i>screaming</i>). And what about me&mdash;me! With the
whole network from here to there and back again tied up for his
broadcast&mdash;and now I'll have to announce that the blame fool's
committed&mdash;(<i>Electrically</i>) But wait! Gee! What did he say? He
felt inferior because he hadn't used&mdash;By hokey! Perfect Specimen
Leaps from Eighth Storied Window Because He Hadn't Used&mdash;Oh boy, oh
boy, this is the greatest ad. ever!!!! (<i>Rushing to door to open
it, booming</i>) Jimmy, Jimmy, slam down on that record and let me
at the microphone. I've got something to give the world!</p>

<p>[<i>The greed light flicks on. Eyes popping, mouth wide open, he
clutches the microphone as...</i></p>

<p class="cpb">NOTES ON PRODUCTION</p>

<p>This play does not present any production problems and could be
given simply with the stage draped in curtains.</p>

<p>Since the turning of the radio dial is supposed to control the
fading in and out of the radio voices David's hand should not leave
the dial while the radio is switched on.</p>

<p>David should be made up to look sun-tanned and healthy and
dressed distinctively&mdash;perhaps all in white; at any rate with good
taste and so in contrast to the ostentation of Blatant.</p>

<p class="cpb">ANGUS &amp; ROBERTSON'S AUSTRALIAN YOUTH PLAYS</p>

<p>are designed to meet the growing need for good dramatic material
in the ever-increasing numbers of Australian schools in which play
production is becoming a part of the curriculum.</p>

<p>The plays are divided into two series, Junior and Senior, to
suit pupils below and above the approximate age of twelve. Bright
young actors may like to try some of the Senior plays.</p>

<p>Plays of equal merit will, on submission, be carefully
considered by the publishers with a view to publication as titles
in the series.</p>

<p>All these plays have been performed, and lend themselves to
practical stage work. They have been selected with the help of a
Committee of the Department of Education, N.S.W., whose
recommendation they bear.</p>
