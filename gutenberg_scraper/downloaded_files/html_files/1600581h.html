account of the public disapproval called forth by its transgression,

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvii"></a>xvii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="small">In an</span> earlier book, <i>The
Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas</i>, it was my object to
study the moral consciousness as it displays itself among mankind at
large. In spite of its numerous references to customs, laws, and
institutions, my inquiry was essentially concerned not with behaviour,
but with opinions. I arrived at the conclusion
 that moral judgments are ultimately based on emotions, the moral
concepts being generalizations of emotional tendencies; although I
recognized at the same time the enormous influence that intellectual
considerations exercise upon those judgments, in the first place
through the cognitions by which the moral emotions are determined. In
a short introductory chapter I indicated that the emotional origin of
moral judgments consistently leads to a denial of the objective
validity ascribed to them both by common sense and by normative
theories of ethics. This idea will be further developed in the present
treatise.</p>
<p> I shall examine the main arguments adduced in support of the
notion of moral objectivity, and try to show that they are
incompatible with facts on which ethical subjectivism establishes its
claims, nay, that the normative theories themselves have an emotional
foundation. In my analyses of the moral emotions, the principal moral
concepts, and the subjects of moral judgments, I shall have to repeat
much that I have said in my earlier book (which I may do by kind
permission of its publishers, Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co.); but while
my views on these topics have remained substantially the same, they
have undergone various modifications in detail. For other reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexviii"></a>xviii</span>also I am glad
to have an opportunity to deal with those subjects afresh. I shall be
able to discuss objections raised to my former treatment of them by
other writers in the course of the many years&mdash;about a quarter of
a century&mdash;which have elapsed since the first publication of my
<i>Moral Ideas</i>; to give a more precise formulation of my views by
corrections and additions; and to make them stand out more clearly by
detaching them from the mass of anthropological and historical
particulars, which seem to have disabled some of my earlier readers
from seeing the wood for the trees.</p>
<p> It appears to me that the present publication of a book in defence
of ethical subjectivism and relativity is the more timely, as the
large bulk of ethical literature which has been produced in this
country since the beginning of the century has championed the opposite
cause.</p>
<p> I beg to express my best thanks to Miss Agnes Dawson for valuable
suggestions of a formal character.</p>

upon as a &ldquo;normative&rdquo; science, the object of which is to
find and formulate moral principles and rules possessing objective
validity. The supposed objectivity of moral values, as understood in
this treatise, implies that they have a real existence apart from any
reference to a human mind, that what is said to be good or bad, right
or wrong, cannot be reduced merely to what people think to be good or
bad, right or wrong. It makes morality a matter of truth and falsity,
and to say that a judgment is true obviously means something different
from the statement that it is thought to be true. The objectivity of
moral judgments does not presuppose the infallibility of the
individual who pronounces such a judgment, nor even the accuracy of a
general consensus of opinion; but if a certain course of conduct is
objectively right, it must be thought to be right by all rational
beings who judge truly of the matter and cannot, without error, be
judged to be wrong.</p>

<p>In spite of the fervour with which the objectivity of moral
judgments has been advocated by the exponents of normative ethics
there is much diversity of opinion with regard to the principles
underlying the various systems. This discord is as old as ethics
itself. But while the evolution of other sciences has shown a tendency
to increasing agreement on points of fundamental importance, the same
can hardly be said to have been the case in the history of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page4"></a>4</span>ethics, where the spirit of
controversy has been much more conspicuous than the endeavour to add
new truths to results already reached. Of course, if moral values are
objective, only one of the conflicting theories can possibly be true.
Each founder of a new theory hopes that it is he who has discovered
the unique jewel of moral truth, and is naturally anxious to show that
other theories are only false stones. But he must also by positive
reasons make good his claim to the precious find.</p>

<p>These reasons are of great importance in a discussion of the
question whether moral judgments really are objective or merely are
supposed to be so; for if any one of the theories of normative ethics
has been actually proved to be true, the objectivity of those
judgments has <i>eo ipso</i> been established as an indisputable fact.
I shall therefore proceed to an examination of the main evidence that
has been produced in favour of the most typical of these theories.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I shall begin with hedonism, according to which actions are right
in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, and wrong in
proportion as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. And by
happiness is then meant &ldquo;pleasure, and the absence of pain; by
unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_1" href="#Notech1_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
What is the evidence?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech1_1" href="#Anchornotech1_1">1</a></span> J. S. Mill,
<i>Utilitarianism</i> (London, 1895), p. 10.</p></div>

<p>It has been said that the hedonistic principle requires no proof,
because it is simply an analytic proposition, a mere definition.
Because acts that are called right generally produce pleasure and acts
that are called wrong generally produce pain, rightness and wrongness
have been actually identified with the tendencies of acts to produce
pleasure or pain. The following statement of Sir James Stephen is a
clearly expressed instance of such an identification:<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page5"></a>5</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Speaking
generally, the acts which are called right do promote, or are supposed
to promote general happiness, and the acts which are called wrong do
diminish, or are supposed to diminish it. I say, therefore, that this
is what the words &lsquo;right&rsquo; and &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; mean,
just as the words &lsquo;up&rsquo; and &lsquo;down&rsquo; mean that
which points from or towards the earth&rsquo;s centre of gravity,
though they are used by millions who have not the least notion of the
fact that such is their meaning, and though they were used for
centuries and millenniums before any one was or even could be aware of
it.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_2" href="#Notech1_2"><span
class="sp">2</span></a> A similar view is expressed by Bentham when he
says that words like &ldquo;ought,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; have no meaning unless interpreted in accordance
with the principle of utility.<a id="Anchornotech1_3"
href="#Notech1_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Now the statement that
a certain act has a tendency to promote happiness, or to cause
unhappiness, is either true or false; and if rightness and wrongness
are only other words for these tendencies, it is therefore obvious
that the moral judgments also have objective validity. But it is
impossible to doubt that anybody who sees sufficiently carefully into
the matter must admit that the identification in question is due to a
confusion between the meaning of terms and the use made of them when
applied to acts on account of their tendencies to produce certain
effects. Bentham himself seems to have felt something of the kind. For
although he asserts that the rectitude of the principle of utility has
been contested only by those who have not known what they have been
meaning, he raises the question whether it is susceptible of any
direct proof. And his answer is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;It should
seem not: for that which is used to prove everything else, cannot
itself be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"></a>6</span>proved: a
chain of proofs must have their commencement somewhere.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_4" href="#Notech1_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
The question and the answer suggest that Bentham, after all, hardly
looked upon the principle of utility or, as he also calls it, the
greatest happiness principle, as strictly speaking a mere definition
of rightness.</p>

<p>Stuart Mill, also, admits that this principle, like all questions
of ultimate ends, is not amenable to direct proof, &ldquo;in the
ordinary and popular meaning of the term.&rdquo; But he says that
there is a larger meaning of the word proof: considerations may be
presented capable of determining the intellect either to give or
withhold its assent to the doctrine, and this is equivalent to
proof.<a id="Anchornotech1_5" href="#Notech1_5"><span
class="sp">5</span></a> Questions about ends are questions as to what
things are desirable. &ldquo;The utilitarian doctrine is, that
happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all
other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to
be required of this doctrine&mdash;what conditions is it requisite
that the doctrine should fulfil&mdash;to make good its claim to be
believed? The only proof capable of being given that an object is
visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound
is audible, is that people hear it; and so of the other sources of our
experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is
possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do
actually desire it.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_6"
href="#Notech1_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> The fallacy of this
argument has often been exposed, and is indeed too obvious to be
disputed. While the visible means what can be seen and the audible
what can be heard, the desirable does not mean what can be desired;
and Mill even understands by it what ought to be desired, which gives
to the word a more specified meaning than is justified by the ordinary
use of it, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page7"></a>7</span>since
something may be held desirable on other than moral grounds. And yet
he thinks the mere fact that a thing is desired is a sufficient proof
that it is desirable, just as if people never could desire to do
anything else than what they ought to desire to do.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

<p>Now the utilitarian standard is not the agent&rsquo;s own greatest
happiness, but the greatest amount of happiness altogether. It may be
defined as the rules and precepts for human conduct by the observance
of which happiness might be, to the greatest extent possible, secured
to all mankind; &ldquo;and not to them only, but, so far as the nature
of things admits, to the whole sentient creation.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_7" href="#Notech1_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
How can this be proved? Mill argues that &ldquo;no reason can be given
why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so
far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.
This, however, being a fact, we have not only all the proof which the
case admits of, but all which it is possible to require, that
happiness is a good: that each person&rsquo;s happiness is a good to
that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the
aggregate of all persons.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_8"
href="#Notech1_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> But if a person
desires his own happiness, and if what he desires is desirable in the
sense that he ought to desire it, the standard of general happiness
can only mean that each person ought to desire his own happiness. In
other words, the premises in Mill&rsquo;s argument would lead to
egoistic hedonism, not to utilitarianism or universalistic
hedonism.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

16 <i>sq.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech1_8" href="#Anchornotech1_8">8</a></span> <i>Ibid.</i>, p.
53.</p></div>

<p>But Mill also produces another argument in favour of the
utilitarian doctrine: it has the support of the social feelings of
mankind. Men have a desire to be in unity with their fellow-creatures,
and this desire, which is already a powerful principle in human
nature, tends to become stronger from the influences of advancing
civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>8</span> The
strengthening of social ties gives to each individual a stronger
personal interest in consulting the welfare of others; and it also
leads him to identify his <i>feelings</i> more and more with their
good. In the comparatively early state of human advancement in which
we now live, a person cannot indeed feel that entireness of sympathy
with all others, which would make any real discordance in the general
direction of their conduct in life impossible; this feeling is in most
individuals much inferior in strength to their selfish feelings, and
is often wanting altogether. But the deeply rooted conception which
every individual even now has of himself as a social being, tends to
make him feel it one of his natural wants that there should be harmony
between his feeling and aims and those of his fellow-creatures. And
&ldquo;this conviction is the ultimate sanction of the
greatest-happiness morality.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_9"
href="#Notech1_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> In this argument Mill
has undoubtedly stated facts which go a long way to explain the origin
and wide acceptance of the utilitarian theory, but he has by no means
proved its objective validity. Nor has he even, by far, been able to
claim for it the support of a consensus of moral opinion.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech1_9" href="#Anchornotech1_9">9</a></span> Mill, <i>op.
cit.</i>, p. 46 <i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>Another attempt to vindicate the validity of utilitarianism was
made by Sidgwick. When examining the evidence presented by Mill,
&ldquo;the most persuasive and probably the most influential among
English expositors of utilitarianism,&rdquo; he found it
unsatisfactory. Even if it were granted that what is actually desired
may be legitimately inferred to be desirable, in the sense that it
ought to be desired, the proposition that the general happiness is
desirable would not be established by Mill&rsquo;s reasoning because,
so far as this reasoning goes, there is no actual desire for the
general happiness. There is thus a gap in the argument, and <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page9"></a>9</span>this gap, according to
Sidgwick, can only be filled by an intuition: an axiom or principle of
&ldquo;rational benevolence&rdquo; is required as a basis for the
utilitarian system.<a id="Anchornotech1_10" href="#Notech1_10"><span
class="sp">10</span></a> This principle is the maxim, &ldquo;that each
one is morally bound to regard the good of any other individual as
much as his own, except in so far as he judges it to be less, when
impartially viewed, or less certainly knowable or attainable by
him.&rdquo; The proposition, &ldquo;I ought not to prefer my own
lesser good to the greater good of another,&rdquo; presents itself to
Sidgwick as no less self-evident than the mathematical axiom that
&ldquo;if equals be added to equals the wholes are equal.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_11" href="#Notech1_11"><span
class="sp">11</span></a> He also says, &ldquo;I find that I
undoubtedly seem to perceive, as clearly and certainly as I see any
axiom in Arithmetic or Geometry, that it is &lsquo;right&rsquo; and
&lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; for me to &hellip; do what I believe to be
ultimately conducive to universal Good or Happiness.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_12" href="#Notech1_12"><span
class="sp">12</span></a> Thus the utilitarian rule of aiming at the
general happiness is seen to &ldquo;rest on a fundamental moral
intuition.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

<p>Can this claim be justified? Sidgwick observes that &ldquo;there
seem to be four conditions, the complete fulfilment of which would
establish a significant proposition, apparently self-evident, in the
highest degree of certainty attainable: and which must be
approximately realized by the premises of our reasoning in any
inquiry, if that reasoning is to lead us cogently to trustworthy
conclusions.&rdquo; These four conditions are:&mdash;1. &ldquo;The
terms of the proposition must be clear and precise.&rdquo; 2.
&ldquo;The self-evidence of the proposition must be ascertained by
careful reflection.&rdquo; 3. &ldquo;The propositions accepted as
self-evident must be mutually consistent.&rdquo; 4. There must be an
adequate consensus of opinion in their favour.<a id="Anchornotech1_13"
href="#Notech1_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a>&mdash;Let us see
whether Sidgwick&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page10"></a>10</span> principle of rational benevolence fulfils
these conditions.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech1_13" href="#Anchornotech1_13">13</a></span> <i>Ibid.</i>,
p. 338 <i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>The terms in which it is stated cannot be said to be &ldquo;clear
and precise.&rdquo; Who is that other individual whose good I am
morally bound to regard as much as my own? I presume that Sidgwick
means every human individual, whether he be a relative or friend or
not, a compatriot or a foreigner, a civilized man or a savage. He says
it may be fairly urged that practically each man ought chiefly to
concern himself with promoting the good of a limited number of human
beings, and that generally in proportion to the closeness of their
connection with him; but he maintains that this may be done
&ldquo;even with a view to universal Good.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_14" href="#Notech1_14"><span
class="sp">14</span></a> But what about animals? When examining the
utilitarian principle, Sidgwick considers who the &ldquo;all&rdquo;
are whose happiness is to be taken into account. He
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Are we to extend our concern to all the beings
capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our
conduct? Or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former
view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the
Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with
the universality that is characteristic of their principle. It is the
good <i>Universal</i>, interpreted and defined as
&lsquo;happiness&rsquo; or &lsquo;pleasure,&rsquo; at which a
Utilitarian considers it his duty to aim: and it seems arbitrary and
unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of
any sentient being.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_15"
href="#Notech1_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Yet, in spite of
this definite statement, I cannot conceive that Sidgwick would have
regarded it as a self-evident proposition that I ought not to prefer
my own lesser good to the greater good of a beast or bird or fish or
insect, however &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; it might be to exclude them
from the principle of rational benevolence. I venture <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page11"></a>11</span>to believe that when he
formulated this principle he did not bestow on the question of animal
happiness that &ldquo;careful reflection&rdquo; which is the second
condition he requires of a self-evident proposition. And, as will be
shown presently, it does not seem to be the only instance in which he
has failed to fulfil this condition.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

p. 414.</p></div>

<p>As to the third criterion, according to which the propositions
accepted as self-evident must be mutually consistent, we have to
consider the relations between the principle of rational benevolence
and the two other principles, likewise regarded as self-evident, which
are stated in connection with it. One is the axiom of prudence, or the
maxim that &ldquo;one ought to aim at one&rsquo;s own good on the
whole.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_16" href="#Notech1_16"><span
class="sp">16</span></a> Whatever else may be said of this principle,
it is obvious that it cannot be consistent with that of rational
benevolence without an important qualification, namely, that one ought
to aim at one&rsquo;s own good on the whole only where it does not
collide with the greater good of somebody else.<a
id="Anchornotech1_17" href="#Notech1_17"><span
class="sp">17</span></a> The other principle, called the principle of
justice, is the proposition that &ldquo;it cannot be right for
<i>A</i> to treat <i>B</i> in a manner in which it would be wrong for
<i>B</i> to treat <i>A</i>, merely on the ground that they are two
different individuals, and without there being any difference between
the natures or circumstances of the two which can be stated as a
reasonable ground for difference of treatment.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_18" href="#Notech1_18"><span
class="sp">18</span></a> This proposition is true, but for the simple
reason that it is tautological; and the truth expressed by it applies
not only to the rightness of acts, but to all moral concepts. When I
pronounce an act to be right or wrong, good or bad, I mean that it is
so quite independently of any reference it may have to me
personally<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12"></a>12</span> or to the
particular relationship in which I stand to him who is immediately
affected by the act and to him who performs it. This is implied in the
very meaning of those and all other moral predicates on account of the
disinterestedness and apparent impartiality that characterize the
moral emotions, from which all moral concepts are derived.<a
id="Anchornotech1_19" href="#Notech1_19"><span
class="sp">19</span></a> The principle of rational benevolence is
certainly not inconsistent with the so-called principle of justice,
but it derives absolutely no support from it. According to the latter
principle it might very well be right for each person to prefer his
own lesser good to the greater good of another, although it could not
be right for me and wrong for another similar person in similar
circumstances to do so.</p>

<p>The fourth criterion is stated in much less definite terms than the
previous ones. Sidgwick writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Since it is implied in
the very notion of Truth that it is essentially the same for all
minds, the denial by another of a proposition that I have affirmed has
a tendency to impair my confidence in its validity. And in fact
&lsquo;universal&rsquo; or &lsquo;general&rsquo; consent has often
been held to constitute by itself a sufficient evidence of the truth
of the most important beliefs; and is practically the only evidence
upon which the greater part of mankind can rely. A proposition
accepted as true upon this ground alone has, of course, neither
self-evidence nor demonstrative evidence for the mind that so accepts
it; still, the secure acceptance that we commonly give to the
generalizations of the empirical sciences rests&mdash;even in the case
of experts&mdash;largely on the belief that other experts have seen
for themselves the evidence for these generalizations, and do not
materially disagree as to its adequacy. And it will be easily seen
that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"></a>13</span>the absence of
such disagreement must remain an indispensable negative condition of
the certainty of our beliefs.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_20"
href="#Notech1_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech1_20" href="#Anchornotech1_20">20</a></span> Sidgwick,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 341 <i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>When examining the moral notions that present themselves with a
<i>prima facie</i> claim to furnish independent and self-evident rules
of morality, Sidgwick has in each case found that from such regulation
of conduct as the common sense of mankind really supports, &ldquo;no
proposition can be elicited which, when fairly contemplated, even
appears to have the characteristic of a scientific axiom.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_21" href="#Notech1_21"><span
class="sp">21</span></a> He expressly points out that the duty of
benevolence as recognized by common sense seems to fall somewhat short
of the principle of rational benevolence. Yet he thinks &ldquo;that a
&lsquo;plain man&rsquo; in a modern civilized society, if his
conscience were fairly brought to consider the hypothetical question,
whether it would be morally right for him to seek his own happiness on
any occasion if it involved a certain sacrifice of the greater
happiness of some other human being,&mdash;without any
counterbalancing gain to any one else,&mdash;would answer
unhesitatingly in the negative.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_22"
href="#Notech1_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> Well, in many cases
he undoubtedly would, but in other cases he most decidedly would not.
Suppose that I endeavour to obtain a good which another person also
tries to obtain, and that I do so in spite of my belief that it will
be a lesser good to me than it would be to him if he succeeded in
achieving it; would common sense condemn my action, even though I
could claim no counterbalancing gain to any one else as an excuse for
my behaviour? For example, would it require that I, being a merchant,
should abstain from some business if it is likely that another
competing merchant would make a larger profit than I <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page14"></a>14</span>could by engaging in the
business?<a id="Anchornotech1_23" href="#Notech1_23"><span
class="sp">23</span></a> Or, again, would common sense agree that he
who possesses some good is morally bound to share it with others if
their gain thereby outweighs his own loss? Or if I, by sacrificing my
own life, could save another person&rsquo;s life, which is a greater
good to him or to others, than my life is to me or others, would it be
my duty to make such a sacrifice? Can anybody doubt that common sense,
without hesitation, would answer these questions in the negative? It
seems fairly obvious that Sidgwick has considerably exaggerated even
that limited support his principle of rational benevolence could
receive from the &ldquo;plain man.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_24"
href="#Notech1_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Hutcheson, in whose
system benevolence is the very essence of virtue and who was

action is best which procures the greatest happiness for the greatest
numbers,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_25" href="#Notech1_25"><span
class="sp">25</span></a> goes so far as to say that &ldquo;we do not
positively condemn those as evil, who will not sacrifice their private
interest to the advancement of the positive good of others, unless the

great.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_26" href="#Notech1_26"><span

href="#Notech1_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> and he never
succeeded in solving this difficulty. Yet his principle of rational
benevolence seemed to him to be in substantial agreement with the
doctrines of &ldquo;those moralists who have been most in earnest in
seeking among commonly received rules for genuine intuitions of the
Practical Reason,&rdquo; particularly Clarke and Kant.<a
id="Anchornotech1_29" href="#Notech1_29"><span

was hardly justified in claiming the authority of Kant in support of
it.<a id="Anchornotech1_30" href="#Notech1_30"><span

Sidgwick&rsquo;s principle of rational benevolence has been accepted
by some, but rejected by others.</p>

<p>Altogether, then, it must be admitted that this supposed axiom does
not fulfil the conditions which in Sidgwick&rsquo;s own opinion have
to be approximately realized for the establishment of a self-evident
proposition. And thus the final attempt to vindicate the objective
validity of utilitarianism has proved to be a failure. By itself alone
that principle would in no case have afforded a sufficient intuitional
basis for utilitarianism, since the &ldquo;good&rdquo; mentioned in it
has been left undefined. But in Sidgwick&rsquo;s eyes it did so when
combined with the proposition that &ldquo;happiness (a term which he
used as convertible with pleasure<a id="Anchornotech1_31"
href="#Notech1_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a>) is the only
rational ultimate end of action,&rdquo; which also appeared to him as
an object of intuition.<a id="Anchornotech1_32"

<p>In its earlier days utilitarianism was frequently supported by
theological considerations. It was widely held that the moral agent
could ultimately will only his own happiness, and the question arose
how this could lead him to act for the common good. In the natural
course <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16"></a>16</span>of things
private and public happiness by no means always coincide; hence a
coincidence can be brought about only by &ldquo;the lively and active
belief in an all-seeing and all-powerful God,&rdquo; who will
hereafter make men happy or miserable, &ldquo;according as they
designedly promote or violate the happiness of their
fellow-creatures.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_33"
href="#Notech1_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> &ldquo;The will of
God is the immediate criterion of virtue, and the happiness of mankind
the criterion of the will of God.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_34"
href="#Notech1_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> &ldquo;God Almighty
wills and wishes the happiness of his creatures; and,
consequently,&hellip; those actions which promote that will and wish,
must be agreeable to him; and the contrary.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_35" href="#Notech1_35"><span
class="sp">35</span></a> And the rewards he bestows on those who obey
his will and the punishments he inflicts on the disobedient, will
naturally suffice to make it always every one&rsquo;s interest to
promote universal happiness to the best of his knowledge; indeed, the
penalties and rewards became so tremendous that selfishness was
inevitable. These opinions, which were advocated by a section of
eighteenth century utilitarians, subsequently lost their influence.
Sidgwick admits that the existence of divine sanctions to the code of
social duty as constructed on a utilitarian basis would secure the
much needed reconciliation of duty and self-interest and settle the
relation of rational self-love to rational benevolence, which he
regards as &ldquo;the profoundest problem of Ethics.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_36" href="#Notech1_36"><span

<p>It may be asked if the so-called &ldquo;theological
utilitarianism&rdquo; really is utilitarianism, or if it belongs to
the doctrine of egoistic hedonism. The answer, of course, depends on
the meanings given to these terms, and these meanings are by no means
free from ambiguities. Sidgwick uses the term egoistic hedonism to
denote &ldquo;a system which prescribes actions as means to the end of
the individual&rsquo;s happiness or pleasure,&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_38" href="#Notech1_38"><span
class="sp">38</span></a> and by utilitarianism he means &ldquo;the
ethical theory, that the conduct which, under any given circumstances,
is objectively right, is that which will produce the greatest amount
of happiness on the whole; that is, taking into account all whose
happiness is affected by the conduct.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_39"
href="#Notech1_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> Dr. Albee raises the
question whether egoistic hedonism is a method of ethics at all, even
according to Sidgwick&rsquo;s &ldquo;carefully formulated
definitions.&rdquo; There is indeed, he says, no question that many
English moralists, from the time of Hobbes down at least to the time
of J. S. Mill, held that the motive of the moral agent was necessarily
egoistic; and &ldquo;if, then, all were to be classed as Egoists who
held this theory of the moral motive, we should plainly have to
include all the English Utilitarians before Mill, with the exception
of Cumberland, Hartley, and Hume (<i>i.e.</i>, as represented by the
second form of his theory).&rdquo; But he argues that the egoistic
theory of the moral motive cannot be what Sidgwick means, when he
speaks of egoistic hedonism as constituting a separate method of
ethics, that is, as one of &ldquo;the different methods of obtaining
reasoned convictions as to what ought to be done.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_40" href="#Notech1_40"><span
class="sp">40</span></a> For &ldquo;it may confidently be maintained
that not one of the many moralists<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page18"></a>18</span> referred to above, as holding or seeming to
hold the egoistic theory of the moral motive, ever so much as
suggested that one could obtain &lsquo;reasoned convictions as to what
ought to be done&rsquo; by merely computing what would bring the most
pleasure to one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_41"

<p>The &ldquo;theological utilitarians&rdquo; looked upon self-love as
the ground for accepting the will of God as our rule. Gay
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Obligation is the necessity of doing or omitting
any action in order to be happy.&hellip; So that obligation is
evidently founded upon the prospect of happiness, and arises from the
necessary influence which any action has upon present or future
happiness or misery.&hellip; How can the good of mankind be any
obligation to <i>me</i>, when perhaps in particular cases, such as
laying down my life, or the like, it is contrary to my
happiness?&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_42" href="#Notech1_42"><span
class="sp">42</span></a> Paley defines virtue as &ldquo;the doing good
to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake of
everlasting happiness.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_43"
href="#Notech1_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> Are not these
&ldquo;reasoned convictions as to what ought to be done,&rdquo; which
fall within the scope of Sidgwick&rsquo;s definition of egoistic
hedonism? Indeed, he speaks himself of Paley&rsquo;s egoistic hedonism
as something which seems to the latter self-evident as a fundamental
principle of rational conduct.<a id="Anchornotech1_44"
href="#Notech1_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> And what may be said
of Dr. Albee&rsquo;s indictment that Sidgwick &ldquo;has unconsciously
developed, in what he terms Egoism, the conception of a form of
hedonistic theory which in reality has never existed in modern
Ethics,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_45" href="#Notech1_45"><span
class="sp">45</span></a> when we read the following reasoned argument
in Waterland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sermon on Self-Love&rdquo;?<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page19"></a>19</span> &ldquo;The wisest course
for any man to take is to secure an interest in the life to
come.&hellip; There can be no excess of fondness, or self-indulgence,
in respect of eternal happiness. This is loving himself in the best
manner, and to the best purposes. All virtue and piety are thus
resolvable into a principle of self-love.&hellip; It is with reference
to ourselves, and for our own sakes, that we love even God
himself.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_46" href="#Notech1_46"><span

<p>At the same time, while the so-called &ldquo;theological
utilitarianism&rdquo; perfectly agrees with the definition of egoistic
hedonism, it also agrees with the definition of utilitarianism, in
which no reference is made to motives or the ultimate end of acts.
Sidgwick expressly mentions Bentham&rsquo;s psychological doctrine,
that every human being always does aim at his own greatest apparent
happiness, and yet classifies him as a utilitarian.<a
id="Anchornotech1_47" href="#Notech1_47"><span
class="sp">47</span></a> He speaks of the &ldquo;obvious and
glaring&rdquo; difference between the egoistic proposition that
&ldquo;each ought to seek his own happiness,&rdquo; and the
utilitarian proposition that &ldquo;each ought to seek the happiness
of all&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech1_48" href="#Notech1_48"><span
class="sp">48</span></a> but then he does not take account of the fact
that a person may aim at his own happiness as his ultimate end and at
the same time aim at the happiness of all as a means to that end. If
utilitarianism required the happiness of all as the ultimate end, not
only Bentham, but Mill and others would have to be excluded from its
followers. Mill observes that &ldquo;utilitarian moralists have gone
beyond almost all others in affirming that the motive has nothing to
do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the
agent.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_49" href="#Notech1_49"><span
class="sp">49</span></a> A utilitarian may consequently very well seek
the general happiness as a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page20"></a>20</span>means of securing his own happiness. He may
be an egoistic hedonist, and an egoistic hedonist may be a
utilitarian. Egoistic and universalistic hedonism, as defined by the
author of these terms, are different, but not <i>eo ipso</i>
conflicting doctrines.</p>

<p>If egoistic hedonism is taken to imply that each <i>ought</i> to

understanding that by happiness is meant everlasting happiness. As to
its objective validity I have therefore nothing more to say than what
will be found in the discussion of the claim to validity made by
theological ethics in general.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly related to utilitarianism is the evolutionary theory of
Herbert Spencer. In a well-known letter to Stuart Mill he repudiated
the title anti-utilitarian, which had been applied to him, and
endeavoured to make clear their difference of opinion. He
wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;The view for which I contend is, that Morality
properly so-called&mdash;the science of right conduct&mdash;has for
its object to determine <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> certain modes of
conduct are detrimental, and certain other modes beneficial. These
good and bad results cannot be accidental, but must be necessary
consequences of the constitution of things; and I conceive it to be
the business of Moral Science to deduce, from the laws of life and the
conditions of existence, what kinds of action necessarily tend to
produce happiness, and what kinds to produce unhappiness. Having done
this, its deductions are to be recognized as laws of conduct; and are
to be conformed to irrespective of a direct estimation of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page21"></a>21</span>happiness or
misery.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_51" href="#Notech1_51"><span
class="sp">51</span></a> Hence &ldquo;the utilitarianism which
recognizes only the principles of conduct reached by induction, is but
preparatory to the utilitarianism which deduces these principles from
the processes of life as carried on under established conditions of
existence.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_52" href="#Notech1_52"><span
class="sp">52</span></a> Acts are called good or bad, according as
they are well or ill adjusted to ends, and as conduct evolves there is
a greater adjustment of acts to ends. &ldquo;Ethics has for its
subject-matter that form which universal conduct assumes during the
last stages of its evolution&rdquo;; and under its ethical aspects
conduct is considered good or right if its acts are conducive to life
in self or others, and bad or wrong if they directly or indirectly
tend towards death, special or general. But an extremely important
assumption underlies all such moral estimates, namely, the belief that
life brings more happiness than misery. Our ideas of the moral
goodness and badness of acts really originate from our consciousness
of the certainty or probability that their aggregate results will be
pleasurable or painful to self or others or both;<a
id="Anchornotech1_53" href="#Notech1_53"><span
class="sp">53</span></a> and the reason for this is that &ldquo;there
exists a primordial connection between pleasure-giving acts and
continuance or increase of life, and, by implication, between
pain-giving acts and decrease or loss of life.&rdquo; It thus lies in
the very nature of sentient existence that it is &ldquo;no more
possible to frame ethical conceptions from which the consciousness of
pleasure, of some kind, at some time, to some being, is absent, than
it is possible to frame the conception of an object from which the
consciousness of space is absent.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_54"

<p>It is obvious that Spencer, like the utilitarians, attributes to
the moral concept objective validity. When he <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page22"></a>22</span>regards that conduct as good which
&ldquo;conduces to life in each and all&rdquo; he maintains that he
has the support of &ldquo;the true moral consciousness,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;moral consciousness proper,&rdquo; which, whether in harmony or
in conflict with the &ldquo;pro-ethical&rdquo; sentiment, is vaguely
or distinctly recognized as the rightful ruler.<a
id="Anchornotech1_55" href="#Notech1_55"><span
class="sp">55</span></a> He started as a believer in a moral sense,
but subsequently changed his view. He writes, &ldquo;Though, as shown
in my first work, <i>Social Statics</i>, I once espoused the doctrine
of the intuitive moralists (at the outset in full, and in later
chapters with some implied qualifications), yet it has gradually
become clear to me that the qualifications required practically
obliterate the doctrine as enunciated by them.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_56" href="#Notech1_56"><span
class="sp">56</span></a> He still, however, speaks of moral
intuitions. Thus, when saying that pleasure is an inexpugnable element
of the conception of the ultimate moral aim, he adds, &ldquo;It is as
much a necessary form of moral intuition as space is a necessary form
of intellectual intuition.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_57"
href="#Notech1_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> While rejecting the
doctrine that &ldquo;moral perceptions are innate in the original
sense,&rdquo; he believes in the existence of &ldquo;moral
intuitions&rdquo; acquired by racial experience. He quotes the
following passage from the previously mentioned letter to
Mill:&mdash;&ldquo;Corresponding to the fundamental propositions of a
developed Moral Science, there have been, and still are, developing in
the race, certain fundamental moral intuitions; and &hellip;, though
these moral intuitions are the results of accumulated experiences of
Utility, gradually organized and inherited, they have come to be quite
independent of conscious experience. Just in the same way <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page23"></a>23</span>that I believe the
intuition of space, possessed by any living individual, to have arisen
from organized and consolidated experiences of all antecedent
individuals who bequeathed to him their slowly-developed nervous
organizations&mdash;just as I believe that this intuition, requiring
only to be made definite and complete by personal experiences, has
practically become a form of thought, apparently quite independent of
experience; so do I believe that the experiences of utility organized
and consolidated through all past generations of the human race, have
been producing corresponding nervous modifications, which, by
continued transmission and accumulation, have become in us certain
faculties of moral intuition&mdash;certain emotions responding to
right and wrong conduct, which have no apparent basis in the
individual experiences of utility. I also hold that just as the
space-intuition responds to the exact demonstrations of Geometry, and
has its rough conclusions interpreted and verified by them; so will
moral intuitions respond to the demonstrations of Moral Science, and
will have their rough conclusions interpreted and verified by
them.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_58" href="#Notech1_58"><span

<p>This theory of the development of &ldquo;moral intuitions&rdquo;
through the inheritance of the effects of the accumulated experiences
of the race is based upon a huge assumption, which Spencer regarded as
a scientifically demonstrated truth, namely, the belief that acquired
characters may be transmitted from parent to offspring. But the
heredity of &ldquo;acquired characters&rdquo; is nowadays emphatically
disputed by a large school of biologists, and can certainly not be
taken for granted. Yet even if Spencer&rsquo;s theory were correct, it
would only explain the origin of certain instincts through earlier
generations&rsquo; continued experience. What he calls &ldquo;moral
intuitions&rdquo; is, to use his own <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page24"></a>24</span>words, simply &ldquo;certain emotions
responding to right and wrong conduct,&rdquo; or &ldquo;preferences
and aversions &hellip; rendered organic by inheritance of the effects
of pleasurable and painful experiences in progenitors.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_59" href="#Notech1_59"><span
class="sp">59</span></a> And an emotion &ldquo;corresponding
to,&rdquo; or caused by, a certain course of conduct cannot possibly
make that course of conduct objectively right or wrong.
Spencer&rsquo;s theory might at most be a contribution to the history
of the growth of moral ideas, but could have no bearing whatever on
the question of their validity.</p>

<p>Another representative of what has been called evolutionary
hedonism or utilitarianism is Leslie Stephen. He criticizes the
utilitarian conception of society as a mere aggregate of individuals.
The true unit is not the individual but society, which may be regarded
as an aggregate organism; and morality is &ldquo;the sum of the
preservative instincts of a society.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_60"
href="#Notech1_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> &ldquo;The moral law
is a statement of certain essential conditions of the vitality of the
society&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech1_61" href="#Notech1_61"><span
class="sp">61</span></a> healthy development implies an efficient
moral code and social degeneration implies the reverse.<a
id="Anchornotech1_62" href="#Notech1_62"><span
class="sp">62</span></a> There is this difference between the
utilitarian and the evolutionist criterion of morality&mdash;that the
former is happiness and the latter the health of the society.<a
id="Anchornotech1_63" href="#Notech1_63"><span
class="sp">63</span></a> But at the same time the two criteria
&ldquo;are not really divergent; on the contrary, they necessarily
tend to coincide.&rdquo; There is a correlation between the pernicious
and the painful on the one hand, and on the other between the
beneficial and the agreeable; the &ldquo;useful,&rdquo; in the sense
of pleasure-giving, must approximately coincide with the
&ldquo;useful&rdquo; in the sense of life-preserving.<a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"></a>25</span>But why is the
health of the society the criterion of morality? Stephen writes,
&ldquo;Our moral judgment must condemn instincts and modes of conduct
which are pernicious to the social vitality, and must approve the
opposite; but it does not necessarily follow that it must condemn or
approve them because they are perceived to be pernicious or
beneficial.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_65" href="#Notech1_65"><span
class="sp">65</span></a> And in another place:&mdash;&ldquo;Moral
approval is the name of the sentiment developed through the social
medium which modifies a man&rsquo;s character in such a way as to fit
him to be an efficient member of the social &lsquo;tissue.&rsquo; It
is the spiritual pressure which generates and maintains
morality.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_66" href="#Notech1_66"><span

answers to the question why we have moral sentiments and pronounce
moral judgments, but tell us nothing about that objective validity
which Stephen evidently attributes to his criterion of morality. He
says that it is &ldquo;a simple &lsquo;objective&rsquo; fact that a
man acts rightly or wrongly in a given case, and a fact which may be
proved to him.&hellip; If I can prove drunkenness to be socially
mischievous, I shall certainly prove it to be wicked.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_67" href="#Notech1_67"><span

simply by proving that it is socially mischievous. Of the validity of
his fundamental proposition Stephen has given us no proof at all.</p>

<p>Many ethical writers agree with the hedonists in regarding pleasure
as a good, but disagree with the contention that pleasure alone is
good as an end. It has often been argued that Mill himself was not a
consistent exponent of utilitarianism owing to his admission that
&ldquo;some <i>kinds</i> of pleasure are more desirable and more
valuable than others,&rdquo; and his reference to the &ldquo;sense of
dignity&rdquo; as the ground of the preference that is given to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page26"></a>26</span>some pleasures over
others.<a id="Anchornotech1_68" href="#Notech1_68"><span
class="sp">68</span></a> Moreover, in Mill&rsquo;s famous formula that
&ldquo;it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig
satisfied,&rdquo; Paulsen finds the implication that the moral value
lies, not in pleasure as such, but in pleasurable functions; and he
consequently observes that there is no radical difference between
Mill&rsquo;s utilitarianism and the doctrine of
&ldquo;energism,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_69"
href="#Notech1_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> according to which
the highest good is not the feeling of pleasure, but an
&ldquo;objective content of life,&rdquo; namely, the perfect
development and exercise of life,<a id="Anchornotech1_70"
href="#Notech1_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> or, as he also calls
it, &ldquo;welfare.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_71"

<p>As hedonism is based on the proposition that each person desires
his own happiness, so energism is based on the proposition that each
person desires to live a human life and all that is implied in it, the
goal at which the will of every living creature aims being the normal
exercise of the vital functions that constitute its nature.<a
id="Anchornotech1_72" href="#Notech1_72"><span
class="sp">72</span></a> And as hedonism has been divided into
egoistic and universalistic hedonism, so energism has been divided
into egoistic and universalistic energism. According to the former
kind of energism, the highest good, or principle of morality, is the
welfare of individual life; according to the latter, it is the welfare
of the race.<a id="Anchornotech1_73" href="#Notech1_73"><span
class="sp">73</span></a> Paulsen&rsquo;s energism is universalistic.
Every man desires to live, but he also desires to help others to live;
all human beings are both egoistic and altruistic, although in very
different degrees. Indeed, in the motives of actions it is impossible
to draw any sharp limit between the interests of self and the
interests <span class="pagenum"><a id="page27"></a>27</span>of others.
It is a mistake to suppose that every act has but one motive: many
motives combine to influence the will to action.<a
id="Anchornotech1_74" href="#Notech1_74"><span
class="sp">74</span></a> And just as the motives of an act, so also
the effects of it tend to be both egoistic and altruistic.
&ldquo;There is no act that does not influence the life of the
individual as well as that of his surroundings, and therefore cannot
and must not be viewed and judged from the standpoint of both
individual and general welfare. The traditional classification, which
distinguishes between duties towards self and duties towards others,
cannot be recognized as a legitimate division. There is no duty
towards individual life that cannot be construed as a duty towards
others, and no duty towards others that cannot be proved to be a duty
towards self.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_75" href="#Notech1_75"><span
class="sp">75</span></a> But then, Paulsen asks, can there never be a
conflict between egoism and altruism? His answer is: there are, no
doubt, cases of such a conflict, but &ldquo;the opposition between
individual and general welfare, selfish and altruistic motives, forms
not the rule, but the exception. As a rule, there is harmony in the
effects as well as in the motives.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_76"

<p>So far we have only considered the prevalence of desires to promote
welfare, not the moral valuation of such desires. But there is,
according to Paulsen, a close connection between the morality of acts
and their tendency to gratify the desire for welfare. Good is that
which gratifies a desire, and morally good is an act if it tends to
promote the welfare of the individual and the society and at the same
time is performed from a sense of duty. But the goodness of the motive
depends upon its tendency to express itself outwardly in good acts.
Morality is not an end in itself but a means to an end, namely, the
realization<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28"></a>28</span> of the
highest good, that which human beings strive after, individual and
racial welfare.<a id="Anchornotech1_77" href="#Notech1_77"><span
class="sp">77</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech1_77" href="#Anchornotech1_77">77</a></span> Paulsen, <i>op.
cit.</i>, i. 227 <i>sqq.</i>, 342.</p></div>

<p>It seems, then, that Paulsen repeats the hedonistic fallacy of
regarding the prevalence of a desire as evidence of the morality of
its realization: the moral goodness of a particular motive depends
upon the effect which it tends to produce in action, and the effect
itself is good because man wills it. Now it may possibly be argued
that Paulsen has not definitely attributed objective validity to his
ethical principle, that his ways of expressing himself often are so
vague that when he speaks of moral goodness or badness, duty or
virtue, he may ultimately mean what he and others consider to be good
or bad, obligatory or virtuous. But if Paulsen had looked upon moral
values as merely subjective, he could not have represented his theory
of the goodness of the will as a development of the Kantian doctrine
of the moral law, supplying it with a teleological ground for
&ldquo;the validity of the moral norms &hellip;, the obedience to
which gives moral value to the will.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_78"
href="#Notech1_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> Paulsen admits that
the moral nihilism which denies the validity of all moral norms and
values cannot be logically disproved. But he argues that it is also
impossible to convince a delirious person or a madman of the unreality
of his hallucinations or delusions<a id="Anchornotech1_79"
href="#Notech1_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a>&mdash;an argument
which seems to imply that the existence of moral insensibility, or
&ldquo;moral insanity,&rdquo; is no more inconsistent with the
objectivity of moral values than the existence of madness is with the
objectivity of truth.</p>

<p>According to Bradley, pleasure is a good, but not the good, because
&ldquo;happiness is the end,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_80"
href="#Notech1_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> and
&ldquo;happiness, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page29"></a>29</span>for the ordinary man, neither means a
pleasure nor a number of pleasures. It means in general the finding of
himself, or the satisfaction of himself as a whole, and in particular
it means the realization of his concrete ideal of life.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_81" href="#Notech1_81"><span
class="sp">81</span></a> &ldquo;Morality is co-extensive with
self-realization, as the affirmation of the self which is one with the
ideal.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_82" href="#Notech1_82"><span
class="sp">82</span></a> The good self is the self whose end and
pleasure is the realization of the ideal self; &ldquo;which is
interested in and bound up with pursuits, activities, in a word, with
ends that realize the good will. The good will is the will to realize
the ideal self.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_83"
href="#Notech1_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> Now &ldquo;man is a
social being; he is real only because he is social, and can realize
himself only because it is as social that he realizes himself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Leaving out of sight the question of a society wider than the
state, we must say that a man&rsquo;s life with its moral duties is in
the main filled up by his station in that system of wholes which the
state is, and that this, partly by its laws and institutions, and
still more by its spirit, gives him the life which he does live and
ought to live.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_84" href="#Notech1_84"><span
class="sp">84</span></a> &ldquo;What is moral <i>in any particular
given case</i> is seldom doubtful. Society pronounces beforehand; or,
after some one course has been taken, it can say whether it was right
or not.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_85" href="#Notech1_85"><span
class="sp">85</span></a> As Hegel pointed out, &ldquo;the wisest men
of antiquity have given judgment that wisdom and virtue consist in
living agreeably to the Ethos of one&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_86" href="#Notech1_86"><span
class="sp">86</span></a> What interests us in this connection is not
the theory as such, but its foundation. Why is self-realization,
conceived in the sense indicated, a moral obligation? I can find no
other answer to this question in Bradley&rsquo;s <i>Ethical
Studies</i> than the view that it is an object of desire, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page30"></a>30</span>in other words, that we
ought because we will.<a id="Anchornotech1_87"
href="#Notech1_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> &ldquo;The good self
satisfies us because it answers to our real being.&hellip; In taking
its content into our wills and realizing that, we feel that we realize
ourselves as the true infinite, as one permanent harmonious
whole.&rdquo; On the other hand, &ldquo;the bad self not only does not
realize our true being, but is never, for its own sake and as such,
desired at all.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_88"

<p>Other moralists, whose theories are teleological without being
hedonistic, base their validity on intuitions. According to Dr.
Rashdall, the true criterion of morality is the tendency of an act to
promote a well-being or good, which besides pleasure includes many
other elements possessing different values. The right action is always
that which, so far as the agent has the means of knowing, will produce
the greatest amount of good upon the whole. The values of the elements
included in the good are intuitively discerned and compared with one
another by the moral or practical reason. A paramount position among
these intuitions is occupied by the three axioms of prudence, rational
benevolence, and equity, which we have already discussed in connection
with utilitarianism. &ldquo;It does on reflection strike us as
self-evident that I ought to promote my own good on the whole (where
no one else&rsquo;s good is affected), that I ought to regard a larger
good for society in general as of more intrinsic value than a smaller
good, and that one man&rsquo;s good is (other things being equal) of
as much intrinsic value as any other man&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Among the
many good things included in well-being virtue is the greatest. Even
those virtues which are most obviously altruistic in their tendency
are also ends <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31"></a>31</span>in
themselves&mdash;having a value independent of, and in some cases much
greater than, the mere pleasure which they cause in others; hence it
becomes rational to encourage the cultivation and exercise of these
virtues even in ways which cannot always be shown to produce a net
gain in pleasure on the whole. Again, as to the less obviously
utilitarian virtues and duties it is said that through all of them
there seems to run the general principle that a higher value should be
attributed to the exercise and cultivation of the higher&mdash;that is
to say, of the intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional&mdash;faculties
than to the indulgence of the merely animal and sensual part of our
nature.<a id="Anchornotech1_89" href="#Notech1_89"><span
class="sp">89</span></a> Rashdall says, &ldquo;The view that we have
arrived at is that the morality of our actions is to be determined
ultimately by its tendency to promote a universal end, which end
itself consists of many ends, and in particular two&mdash;Morality and
pleasure.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_90" href="#Notech1_90"><span
class="sp">90</span></a> I should have thought that no particular
intuition was needed to tell us that the morality of our actions is to
be determined by its tendency to promote&mdash;morality.</p>

<p>Another moralist whose theory is closely related to the utilitarian
principle as developed by Stuart Mill is Professor Hobhouse. He
accepts Mill&rsquo;s admission that one kind of pleasure is
intrinsically superior to another but, like many others, he regards it
as fatal to the maintenance of simple pleasurableness as the standard
of action, and asks what sort of experience it is that will yield
pleasure of the most desirable quality. He replies that &ldquo;it is
the harmonious fulfilment of human powers. The end, as thus conceived,
does not separate happiness from the kind of life in which it is
sought, but treats them as two elements in the same whole, as the
experience and the feeling-tone <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page32"></a>32</span>which qualifies the experience. The rational
object of human action is a type of life, not merely a type of
feeling.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_91" href="#Notech1_91"><span
class="sp">91</span></a> And the rational good is the mode of life
sustained by a harmony of feeling, &ldquo;a harmonious fulfilment of
vital capacity, or the fulfilment of vital capacity as a whole.
Feeling in harmony with its object is what we call Pleasure. The body
of feeling in harmony with itself and the body of its objects is what
we call happiness. Viewed as feeling, then, Rational Good is
happiness, viewed as the object of this feeling it is the fulfilment
of vital capacity as a consistent whole. Viewed in both aspects
together it is happiness found in such fulfilment.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_92" href="#Notech1_92"><span
class="sp">92</span></a> By happiness is then meant happiness of all
beings capable thereof, and by fulfilment of vital capacity is meant
fulfilment in all living beings so far as it can attain harmonious
expression. &ldquo;It is this universal harmony of feeling and vital
activity which is the good, and the end which each individual is
required to serve, not his own happiness or the fulfilment of his own
power.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_93" href="#Notech1_93"><span
class="sp">93</span></a> The principle of harmony involves, or rather
is conditioned by, the axiom that &ldquo;what is unambiguously good is
good universally&rdquo;; &ldquo;one feeling is not to be preferred to
another because it is the feeling of this man rather than that, except
in so far as the preference is required on universal principles which
are integral parts of the general system of harmony.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_94" href="#Notech1_94"><span
class="sp">94</span></a> And the fundamental principles in which the
system of feeling at the basis of our social action expresses itself,
&ldquo;e.g., that I must consider my neighbour as myself, are
justified in reason, and the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page33"></a>33</span>judgments of right and wrong founded upon
them are true.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_95" href="#Notech1_95"><span

<p>So far as I can see, this essentially coincides with
Sidgwick&rsquo;s principle that &ldquo;I ought not to prefer my own
lesser good to the greater good of another,&rdquo; which, as I have
tried to show, is not a self-evident proposition. Professor Hobhouse
supports his theory by an attempt to prove that the contrary principle
of self-preference, whether of an individual or a group, involves
inconsistencies and is by definition irrational. He maintains that if
I adopt the system of self-preference, &ldquo;the principle of
universals&rdquo; will compel me to admit that &ldquo;you will form a
similar system for yourself and that these systems may clash. If,
then, both systems are rational, rational systems may be inconsistent,
which is contrary to definition.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech1_96"
href="#Notech1_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a> But why should the
two systems clash and, therefore, be inconsistent? As I have said
before, when I pronounce an act to be good or bad, right or wrong, I
mean that it is so not only for myself but for all similar persons in
similar circumstances; hence it would be self-contradictory to say
that it is right for me to be an egoist though not for another similar
person in similar circumstances. But I can find nothing irrational or
inconsistent in the proposition that it is right for everybody to be
an egoist, myself as well as others. The common sense opinion that, in
certain circumstances, we have a right to prefer our own lesser good
to the greater good of another, cannot be refuted by any arguments of
reason.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the teleological theories imply that such acts are good or
right as tend to produce certain results or <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page34"></a>34</span>effects, or to realize a certain end, there
is another doctrine according to which certain kinds of action are
unconditionally prescribed without regard to ulterior consequences, or
at most with a very partial consideration of consequences. It is held
that duty is not usually a difficult thing for an ordinary man to
know, that we have the power of seeing clearly that certain courses of
conduct are right in themselves, that, for example, &ldquo;duty should
be performed &lsquo;advienne qui pourra,&rsquo; that truth should be
spoken without regard to consequences, that justice should be done
&lsquo;though the sky should fall.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech1_97" href="#Notech1_97"><span
class="sp">97</span></a> This has been called intuitionism, in the
narrow sense of the term, and has also been called unphilosophical
intuitionism, in distinction from philosophical intuitionism, which
intuitively judges some general rule of conduct to be true or evident
and from this rule deduces the morality or immorality of this or that
particular course of conduct, as we have seen to be the case with
various teleological theories of ethics. Intuitionism of the former
kind is practically the morality of common sense, the opinions of
ordinary men. These opinions are not only loose and shifting, but in
many points mutually contradictory, and cannot therefore possibly be
regarded as self-evident truths. In his classical review of common
sense Sidgwick observes that from such regulation of conduct as the
common sense of mankind supports no proposition can be elicited which,
when fairly contemplated, even appears to have the characteristic of a
scientific axiom.<a id="Anchornotech1_98" href="#Notech1_98"><span

THE SUPPOSED OBJECTIVITY OF<br /><br />
MORAL JUDGMENTS (<i>concluded</i>)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="noind"><span class="small">It will</span> perhaps be argued
that even though this or that moral principle, or even all moral
principles hitherto laid down, fail to be objectively valid or express
a moral truth, there may nevertheless be in the human mind some
&ldquo;faculty&rdquo; which makes the pronouncement of objectively
valid moral judgments possible. There are so many
&ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; truths which have never been discovered, and
yet we have in our intellect a &ldquo;faculty&rdquo; enabling us to
pronounce judgments that are true. So also moralists of different
normative schools of ethics maintain that we possess a faculty which
can pronounce true moral judgments. This faculty has been called by
names like &ldquo;moral sense,&rdquo; &ldquo;conscience,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;practical&rdquo; or &ldquo;moral reason,&rdquo; or been simply
included under the general terms &ldquo;reason&rdquo; or
&ldquo;understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the moral sense school, the morality or immorality of
conduct is discriminated by a special sense &ldquo;implanted&rdquo; in
us for this purpose. It perceives virtue and vice as the eye perceives
light and darkness. Shaftesbury observes that man possesses
&ldquo;natural affections, which lead to the good of the
publick&rdquo;; &ldquo;self-affections, which lead only to the good of
the private&rdquo;; and &ldquo;unnatural affections,&rdquo; which lead
neither to public nor private good. Virtue consists in a harmony or
proper balance between the two first kinds of affections; and it is by
means of the moral sense that we can tell whether these affections are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36"></a>36</span>properly balanced or
not.<a id="Anchornotech2_1" href="#Notech2_1"><span
class="sp">1</span></a> Its verdict is final: neither the applause of
custom nor the sanction of religion can ever alter &ldquo;the eternal
measures, and immutable independent nature of worth and
virtue.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_2" href="#Notech2_2"><span
class="sp">2</span></a> According to Hutcheson, again, our moral sense
proves that the essence of virtue consists in benevolence: &ldquo;that
action is best, which procures the greatest happiness for the greatest
numbers; and that worst, which, in like manner, occasions
misery.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_3" href="#Notech2_3"><span
class="sp">3</span></a> It has often been remarked that the term
&ldquo;moral sense&rdquo; is a misnomer: this supposed
&ldquo;faculty&rdquo; not only lacks a bodily organ, but its
perceptions lack the uniformity which characterizes our sensations
under similar physiological conditions.<a id="Anchornotech2_4"
href="#Notech2_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> It is essentially an
emotional faculty. Shaftesbury says that a natural affection, which is
&ldquo;an original one of earliest rise in the soul or affectionate
part,&rdquo; makes the sense of right and wrong<a id="Anchornotech2_5"
href="#Notech2_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a>&mdash;that is, the
moral sense; and that this sense &ldquo;must consist in a real
antipathy or aversion to injustice or wrong, and a real affection or
love towards equity and right, for its own sake, and on account of its
own natural beauty and worth.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_6"
href="#Notech2_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Hutcheson writes in
his work, the <i>Inquiry</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Some actions have to men an
immediate goodness; &hellip; by a superior sense, which I call a moral
one, we approve the actions of others, and perceive them to be their
perfection and dignity, and are determin&rsquo;d to love the agent; a
like perception we have in reflecting on such actions of our own,
without any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"></a>37</span>view of
natural advantage from them.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_7"
href="#Notech2_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> In his later works he
also assigns some importance to reason in the process attending moral
decisions;<a id="Anchornotech2_8" href="#Notech2_8"><span
class="sp">8</span></a> yet the understanding &ldquo;judges about the
means or the subordinate ends: but about the ultimate ends there is no
reasoning.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_9" href="#Notech2_9"><span
class="sp">9</span></a> Rationalistic moralists have justly made the
objection to this moral sense theory that it is totally unable to give
any objective validity to the moral perceptions.<a
id="Anchornotech2_10" href="#Notech2_10"><span
class="sp">10</span></a> In his criticism of it Kant observes that
&ldquo;feelings which naturally differ infinitely in degree cannot
furnish a uniform standard of good and evil, nor has any one a right
to form judgments for others by his own feelings.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_11" href="#Notech2_11"><span
class="sp">11</span></a> Hutcheson himself frankly admits that
&ldquo;every one judges the affections of others by his own sense; so
that it seems not impossible that in these senses men might differ as
they do in taste.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_12"

<p>Butler calls &ldquo;the moral faculty&rdquo; conscience, but as a
synonym for it he frequently uses the term &ldquo;principle of
reflection.&rdquo; It has two aspects, a purely cognitive and an
authoritative, and on its cognitive side it &ldquo;pronounces
determinately some actions to be in themselves just, right, good;
others to be in themselves evil, wrong, unjust.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_13" href="#Notech2_13"><span
class="sp">13</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page38"></a>38</span>Sometimes he even calls it reason. But his
dominant view seems to be that which lays stress on the instinctive
intuition rather than the reflection.<a id="Anchornotech2_14"
href="#Notech2_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> He
says:&mdash;&ldquo;In all common ordinary cases we see intuitively at
first view what is our duty.&hellip; This is the ground of the
observation, that the first thought is often the best. In these cases
doubt and deliberation is itself dishonesty.&hellip; That which is
called considering what is our duty in a particular case, is very
often nothing but endeavouring to explain it away.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_15" href="#Notech2_15"><span
class="sp">15</span></a> But how, then, is it that different
consciences so often issue conflicting orders? This question is never
raised by Butler. He gives us no criterion of rightness and wrongness
apart from the voice of conscience.<a id="Anchornotech2_16"
href="#Notech2_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> It has been said
that when Butler and other intuitionist writers refer to the
conscience as the supreme principle of morals, they do not mean by it
a &ldquo;private conscience&rdquo; but rather what may be called
&ldquo;the universal conscience&rdquo;&mdash;that ultimate recognition
of the rightness and wrongness of actions which is latent in all men,
but which in some men is more fully developed than in others.<a
id="Anchornotech2_17" href="#Notech2_17"><span
class="sp">17</span></a> Whewell wrote:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page39"></a>39</span>&ldquo;As each man has his reason, in virtue
of his participation in the common reason of mankind, so each man has
his conscience, in virtue of his participation in the common
conscience of mankind.&hellip; As the object of reason is to determine
what is true, so the object of conscience is to determine what is
right. As each man&rsquo;s reason may err, and thus lead him to a
false opinion, so each man&rsquo;s conscience may err, and lead him to
a false moral standard. As false opinion does not disprove the reality
of truth, so the false moral standards of men do not disprove the
reality of a supreme rule of human action.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_18" href="#Notech2_18"><span
class="sp">18</span></a> This appeal to a mysterious universal
conscience as an infallible judge of right and wrong merely assumes
the existence of an objectively valid standard in morals instead of
proving it. For Butler conscience really represented the will of
God.</p>

object of the preacher was to impress on his audience the necessity of
conducting their lives virtuously, and they would be agreed, in all
essentials, on the question what sort of conduct is right and wrong.

<p>Cudworth, Clarke, Price, and Reid are names that recall to our mind
a theory according to which the morality of actions is perceived by
the intellect, just as are number, diversity, causation, proportion.
&ldquo;Morality is eternal and immutable,&rdquo; says Richard Price.
&ldquo;Right and wrong, it appears, denote what actions are. Now
whatever anything is, that it is, not by will, or decree, or power,
but by nature and necessity. Whatever a triangle or circle is, that it
is unchangeably and eternally.&hellip; The same is to be said of right
and wrong, of moral good and evil, as far as they express real
characters of actions. They must immutably and necessarily belong to
those actions of which they are truly affirmed.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_19" href="#Notech2_19"><span
class="sp">19</span></a> And as having a real existence <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page40"></a>40</span>outside the mind, they can
only be discerned by the understanding. It is true that this
discernment is accompanied with an emotion:&mdash;&ldquo;Some
impressions of pleasure or pain, satisfaction or disgust, generally
attend our perceptions of virtue and vice. But these are merely their
effects and concomitants, and not the perceptions themselves.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_20" href="#Notech2_20"><span
class="sp">20</span></a> Samuel Clarke is of opinion that if a man
endowed with reason denies the eternal and necessary moral differences
of things, it is the very same &ldquo;as if a man that has the use of
his sight, should at the same time that he beholds the sun, deny that
there is any such thing as light in the world; or as if a man that
understands Geometry or Arithmetick, should deny the most obvious and

<p>Since the days of Kant moral judgments have been referred to a
special faculty or a part of the general faculty of reason, called
&ldquo;practical&rdquo; or &ldquo;moral&rdquo; reason, as the source
of the objective validity assigned to them; according to Kant the
speculative and the practical reason &ldquo;can ultimately be only one
and the same reason which has to be distinguished merely in its
application.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_22" href="#Notech2_22"><span
class="sp">22</span></a> The very existence of this mysterious faculty
presupposes that there really are self-evident or axiomatic moral
propositions; hence if no such proposition can be shown to exist we
have no right whatever to postulate that there is a faculty which ever
could give us any. It is perfectly clear that Kant <i>assumed</i> the
objectivity of duty, and that this assumption led him to the idea of a
pure practical reason, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page41"></a>41</span>not <i>vice versa</i>.<a
id="Anchornotech2_23" href="#Notech2_23"><span
class="sp">23</span></a> He needed a faculty to explain the moral law,
which he regarded as a fact of pure reason, &ldquo;of which we are
<i>a priori</i> conscious, and which is apodictically certain,&rdquo;
and the objective reality of which &ldquo;cannot be proved by any
deduction by any efforts of theoretical reason.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_24" href="#Notech2_24"><span
class="sp">24</span></a> The same is the case with Sidgwick. In
referring moral judgments to reason he simply means to imply their
objectivity, <i>i.e.</i>, that &ldquo;what I judge ought to be must,
unless I am in error, be similarly judged by all rational beings who
judge truly of the matter&rdquo;; he does not mean &ldquo;to prejudice
the question whether valid moral judgments are normally attained by a
process of reasoning from universal principles or axioms, or by direct
intuition of the particular duties of individuals.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_25" href="#Notech2_25"><span
class="sp">25</span></a> Dr. Rashdall writes:&mdash;&ldquo;We may if
we like call Practical Reason a separate faculty from speculative
Reason&mdash;that is only a question of words. We really mean simply
that they are distinguishable aspects of one and the same rational
self. The important thing is that we should recognize that moral
judgments possess an absolute truth or falsity, which is equally valid
for all rational beings; and, if that is recognized, it seems most
natural to ascribe them to Reason.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_26"

<p>The question to be answered, then, is whether any of the moral
principles that have been regarded as self-evident really is so. If
ethics is to be taken as the term for a normative science, I agree
with Professor Moore&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;the fundamental
principles of Ethics must be self-evident.&rdquo; I also agree with
him when he says:&mdash;&ldquo;The expression
&lsquo;self-evident&rsquo; means properly that the proposition <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page42"></a>42</span>so called is evident or
true, <i>by itself</i> alone; that it is not an inference from some
proposition other than <i>itself</i>. The expression does <i>not</i>
mean that the proposition is true, because it is evident to you or me
or all mankind, because in other words it appears to us to be true.
That a proposition appears to be true can never be a valid argument
that true it really is.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_27"
href="#Notech2_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> Just as the
statement &ldquo;this proposition is true&rdquo; does not mean the
same as to say, &ldquo;I consider this proposition to be true,&rdquo;
so also the statement &ldquo;this moral principle is
self-evident&rdquo; does not mean the same as to say, &ldquo;this
moral principle appears self-evident to me.&rdquo; But how, then, can
I know if a proposition is really self-evident or only supposed to be
so? In the case of theoretical truths no truth is considered to have a
claim to self-evidence which is not generally accepted as self-evident
or axiomatic by all those whose intellect is sufficiently developed to
have an opinion on the matter worthy of any consideration at all. It
is true, as Kant said, that universal assent does not prove the
objective validity of a judgment<a id="Anchornotech2_28"
href="#Notech2_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a>&mdash;indeed, there
are mathematical axioms that have been called in question although
they have passed current for centuries; but, to speak with Sidgwick,
the absence of disagreement between experts must be an indispensable
negative condition of the certainty of our beliefs.<a
id="Anchornotech2_29" href="#Notech2_29"><span
class="sp">29</span></a> In the case of moral principles enunciated as
self-evident truths disagreement is rampant.</p>

<p>The great variability of moral judgments does not of course <i>eo
ipso</i> disprove the possibility of self-evident moral intuitions. It
is incompatible with that cruder kind <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page43"></a>43</span>of intuitionism which maintains that some
moral faculty directly passes true moral judgments on particular
courses of conduct at the moment of action. But what about the
differences of opinion as regards the great moral principles that are
supposed to be self-evident? Dr. Rashdall writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Neither
the slow development of the moral faculty nor its unequal development
in different individuals at the same level of social culture forms any
objection to the <i>a priori</i> character of moral judgments. We do
not doubt either the axioms of Mathematics or the rules of reasoning,
because some savages cannot count more than five, or because some
highly educated classical scholars are incapable of understanding the
fifth proposition of Euclid&rsquo;s first book.&hellip; Self-evident
truths are not truths which are evident to everybody. There are
degrees of moral illumination just as there are degrees of musical
sensibility or of mathematical acuteness.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_30" href="#Notech2_30"><span
class="sp">30</span></a> But is it really possible to assume that
defective &ldquo;moral illumination&rdquo; could sufficiently explain
the existence of so many different ethical theories, each of which is
based on one or more principles regarded as self-evident intuitions,
and as to some of which there is the same disagreement now as there
was two thousand years ago? How can there be such a great diversity of
opinion among &ldquo;moral specialists&rdquo; with regard to
propositions that are assumed to be axioms? Some of these specialists
say it is an axiom that I ought not to prefer my own lesser good to
the greater good of another; whilst others not only deny the
self-evidence, but thoroughly disagree with the contents, of this
proposition. According to Sidgwick the proposition that pleasure is
the only rational ultimate end of action is an object of intuition;<a
id="Anchornotech2_31" href="#Notech2_31"><span
class="sp">31</span></a> according to Dr. Moore, also a professor of
moral philosophy, the untruth of this proposition<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page44"></a>44</span> is self-evident.<a
id="Anchornotech2_32" href="#Notech2_32"><span
class="sp">32</span></a> The latter finds it self-evident that good
cannot be defined;<a id="Anchornotech2_33" href="#Notech2_33"><span
class="sp">33</span></a> but others, who have no smaller claim to the
epithet &ldquo;moral specialists,&rdquo; are of the very contrary
opinion. What should we say if two professors of mathematics
quarrelled about the axiom that &ldquo;if equals be added to equals
the wholes are equal,&rdquo; to which Sidgwick compares one of his
moral axioms?<a id="Anchornotech2_34" href="#Notech2_34"><span

<p>There are no doubt moral propositions which really are certain and
self-evident, for the simple reason that they are tautological, that
the predicate is but a repetition of the subject; and moral philosophy
contains a great number of such tautologies, from the days of Plato
and Aristotle to the present times. But apart from such cases, which
of course tell us nothing, I am not aware of any moral principle that
could be said to be truly self-evident. The presumed self-evidence is
only a matter of opinion; and in some cases one might even be inclined
to quote Mr. Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;if
self-evidence is alleged as a ground of belief, that implies that
doubt has crept in, and that our self-evident proposition has not
wholly resisted the assaults of scepticism.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_35" href="#Notech2_35"><span
class="sp">35</span></a> None of the various theories of normative
science can be said to have proved its case; none of them has proved
that moral judgments possess objective validity, that there is
anything truly good or bad, right or wrong, that moral principles
express anything more than the opinions of those who believe in
them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

<i>The Analysis of Mind</i> (London, 1922), p. 263. See also H. H.
Joachim, <i>The Nature of Truth</i> (Oxford, 1906), p. 55.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But what, then, has made moralists believe that moral judgments
possess an objective validity which none of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page45"></a>45</span>them has been able to prove? What has induced
them to construct their theories of normative ethics? What has allured
them to invent a science the subject-matter of which&mdash;the
objectively good or right&mdash;is not even known to exist? The answer
is not difficult to find. It has often been remarked that there is
much greater agreement among moralists on the question of moral
practice than on the question of theory. When they are trying to
define the ultimate end of right conduct or to find the essence of
right and wrong, they give us the most contradictory definitions or
explanations&mdash;as Leslie Stephen said, we find ourselves in a
&ldquo;region of perpetual antinomies, where controversy is
everlasting, and opposite theories seem to be equally self-evident to
different minds.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_36"
href="#Notech2_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> But when they pass
to a discussion of what is right and wrong in concrete cases, in the
various circumstances of life, the disagreement is reduced to a
surprising extent. They all tell us that we should be kind to our
neighbour, that we should respect his life and property, that we
should speak the truth, that we should live in monogamy and be
faithful husbands or wives, that we should be sober and temperate, and
so forth. This is what makes books on ethics, when they come to the
particular rules of life, so exceedingly monotonous and dull; for even
the most controversial and pugnacious theorist becomes then quite tame
and commonplace. And the reason for this is that all ethical theories
are as a matter of fact based on the morality of common sense.
Professor Carveth Read rightly observes:&mdash;&ldquo;We cannot be so
deceived as to imagine that the moral rules that may seem to be
conclusions in any system, are really inferences from its
characteristic <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page46"></a>46</span>conceptions. With some slight qualifications,
the rules are rules of Common Sense, and are the premises, the true
<i>principia</i>, from which the theory is inferred. To agree with
them on the whole is a test that no theory can ever evade.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_37" href="#Notech2_37"><span
class="sp">37</span></a> So also normative ethics has adopted the
common sense idea that there <i>is</i> something right and wrong
independently of what is thought to be right or wrong. People are not
willing to admit that their moral convictions are a mere matter of
opinion, and look upon convictions differing from their own as errors.
If asked why there is so much diversity of opinion on moral questions,
and consequently so many errors, they would probably argue that there
<i>would</i> be unanimity as regards the rightness or wrongness of a
given course of conduct <i>if</i> everybody possessed a sufficient
knowledge of the case and all the attendant circumstances and
<i>if</i>, at the same time, everybody had a sufficiently developed
moral consciousness&mdash;which practically would mean a moral
consciousness as enlightened and developed as their own. This
characteristic of the moral judgments of common sense is shared by the
judgments of philosophers, and is at the bottom of their reasoned
arguments in favour of the objectivity of moral values.</p>

<p>The common sense idea that moral judgments possess objective
validity is itself regarded as a proof of their really possessing such
validity. It is argued that the moral judgment &ldquo;claims
objectivity,&rdquo; that it asserts a value which is found in that on
which it is pronounced. &ldquo;This is the meaning of the
judgment,&rdquo; says Professor Sorley. &ldquo;It is not about a
feeling or attitude of, or any relation to, the subject who makes the
judgment.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_38" href="#Notech2_38"><span
class="sp">38</span></a> Dr. Rashdall <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page47"></a>47</span>writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Is not this idea of
objectivity just the most fundamental of our moral
convictions?&hellip; If there is in the human mind this consciousness
of an objective &lsquo;ought,&rsquo; it must be derived from the
intellectual part of our nature &hellip; If the notion of duty is as
inexpugnable a notion of the human mind as the notion of quantity or
cause or substance or the like, we have every reason that we can
possibly have for believing in its objective validity.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_39" href="#Notech2_39"><span
class="sp">39</span></a> Yet in another place he implicitly admits
that, after all, there is in point of universality some difference
between these notions. He admits that most, and possibly the whole, of
the savage&rsquo;s actual morality and of his intellectual beliefs
about morality can be satisfactorily explained upon the emotional
view; and he says that it would not matter, for the purpose of his
argument, if we had to ascend to a comparatively advanced stage in the
development of morality before we reached any ideas about human
conduct that could be described as a sense of duty.<a
id="Anchornotech2_40" href="#Notech2_40"><span
class="sp">40</span></a> The whole argument is really reduced to the
assumption that an idea&mdash;in this case the idea of the validity of
moral judgments&mdash;which is generally held, or held by more or less
advanced minds, must be true: people claim objective validity for the
moral judgment, therefore it must possess such validity. The only
thing that may be said in favour of such an argument is, that if the
definition of a moral proposition implies the claim to objectivity, a
judgment that does not express this quality cannot be a moral
judgment; but this by no means proves that moral propositions so
defined are true&mdash;the predicated objectivity may be a sheer
illusion.</p>

<p>Well then, it might be argued, if you do not admit that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page48"></a>48</span>there is anything
objectively right or wrong, you must not use these or any other moral
predicates, because if you do, you assign to them a meaning that they
do not possess. But what about other predicates which are also
formally objective and yet, when we more carefully consider the matter
are admitted to be merely subjective estimates? The aesthetic judgment
makes claim to objectivity: when people say that something is
beautiful, they generally mean something more than that it gives, or
has a tendency to give, them aesthetic enjoyment; and there are also
many philosophers who uphold the objectivity of beauty and maintain
that the beauties of nature exist apart from a beholding eye or a
hearing ear. But even those who agree with Hume that beauty is no
quality in things themselves, but exists merely in the mind which
contemplates them,<a id="Anchornotech2_41" href="#Notech2_41"><span
class="sp">41</span></a> do not hesitate to speak of
&ldquo;beauty,&rdquo; and would consider it absurd to be taken to task
for doing so. Sidgwick admits that if I say &ldquo;the air is
sweet&rdquo; or &ldquo;the food is disagreeable,&rdquo; it would not
be exactly true that I mean no more than that I like the one or
dislike the other, although, if my statement is challenged, I shall
probably content myself with affirming the existence of such feelings
in my own mind.<a id="Anchornotech2_42" href="#Notech2_42"><span
class="sp">42</span></a> So also, if anybody calls a certain wine or
cigar good, there is some objectivity implied in the judgment, and
however willing he is to recognize that the so-called goodness is a
mere matter of taste, he will certainly, even if he is a philosopher,
continue to call the wine or cigar good, just as before. Or, to take
an instance from the sphere of knowledge: Hume, in expounding his own
view, still speaks with the man in the street of objects and processes
in nature, although his very aim is to convince <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page49"></a>49</span>us that what we know is
really limited to impressions and ideas. And every one of us makes use
of the words sunrise and sunset, which are expressions from a time
when people thought that the sun rose and set, though nobody now holds
this view. Why, then, should not the ethical subjectivist be allowed
to use the old terms for moral qualities, although he maintains that
the objective validity generally implied in them is a mere illusion?
Dr. Rashdall himself, as we just saw, speaks of an emotional
&ldquo;morality&rdquo; among savages, that is, a morality without
validity.</p>

<p>There is thus a very general tendency to assign objectivity to our
subjective experience, and this tendency is particularly strong and
persistent with regard to our moral experience. Why we attribute
validity to it is of course a matter that does not trouble the moral
intuitionist any more than the mathematician looks for a ground for
his axioms. He is not concerned with the question of origins.
Professor Moore says that the questions as to the origin of
people&rsquo;s moral feelings and ideas are of course &ldquo;not
without interest, and are subjects of legitimate curiosity,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;only form one special branch of Psychology or
Anthropology.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_43" href="#Notech2_43"><span
class="sp">43</span></a> And Professor Sorley remarks that when we
ask, &ldquo;Why do we assign validity to our moral approval and to
moral ideas generally?&rdquo; the history of their genesis gives us no
answer.<a id="Anchornotech2_44" href="#Notech2_44"><span
class="sp">44</span></a> For my own part I maintain, on the contrary,
that an examination into the history of the moral consciousness of
mankind gives us a clue to its supposed objectivity, as well as to its
other characteristics.</p>

<p>People are generally inclined to assume that what makes a certain
impression upon their minds also makes a similar impression upon the
minds of others. This assumption<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page50"></a>50</span> is very largely confirmed by facts; and,
generally speaking, people&rsquo;s inclination to generalize their
judgments is greater in proportion as the impressions are found to be
similar in each particular case. If &ldquo;there is no disputing of
tastes,&rdquo; that is because taste is so very variable; and yet even
in this instance we recognize a certain standard by speaking of a
&ldquo;good&rdquo; and a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; taste. On the other hand,
if the appearance of objectivity in the moral judgments is so illusive
as to make it seem necessary to refer them to reason, that is partly
on account of the comparatively uniform nature of the moral
consciousness. Society is the school in which we learn to distinguish
between right and wrong. The headmaster is Custom, and the lessons are
the same for all the members of the community. The first moral
judgments were pronounced by public opinion; public indignation and
public approval are the prototypes of the moral emotions. As regards
questions of morality there was in early society no difference of
opinion; hence a character of universality was from the very beginning
attached to the moral judgments. And when, with advancing
civilization, this unanimity was to some extent disturbed by
individuals who ventured to dissent from the opinions of the majority,
the disagreement largely arose from circumstances which did not affect
the moral principle itself, but had reference only to its application,
that is, from circumstances of a purely intellectual character, from
the knowledge of, or attention paid to, positive facts.</p>

<p>But besides the relative uniformity of moral opinions and the
possibility of considerably harmonizing conflicting opinions by a
demonstration of facts, there are other circumstances which have in a
large measure contributed to the strong belief in moral truths. From
our earliest childhood we are taught that certain acts <i>are</i>
right and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51"></a>51</span>that
others <i>are</i> wrong. The leading-string in the child&rsquo;s
ethical growth is, all the time, the presence of other persons, whose
&ldquo;word of command&rdquo; is authoritative and not to be trifled
with.<a id="Anchornotech2_45" href="#Notech2_45"><span
class="sp">45</span></a> There is further the authority of public
opinion, custom, and law, with disagreeable consequences for those who
act contrary to their decrees. There is the influence of some great
teacher whose mind was ruled by the ideal of moral perfection, and
whose words became sacred on account of his supreme wisdom, like
Confucius or Buddha, or on religious grounds, like Jesus. There is the
belief in an all-wise and all-powerful God, whose will is the supreme
law and who inflicts punishment on the transgressor. And besides the
external authority of the rules of conduct there is the internal
authority assigned to the moral law, the sense of obligatoriness,
which has much impressed moralists of different schools. It filled
Kant with the same awe as the star-spangled firmament. According to
Butler, conscience is &ldquo;a faculty in kind and in nature supreme
over all others, and which bears its own authority of being
so.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_46" href="#Notech2_46"><span
class="sp">46</span></a> Its supremacy is said to be &ldquo;felt and
tacitly acknowledged by the worst no less than by the best of
men.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_47" href="#Notech2_47"><span
class="sp">47</span></a> Adam Smith calls the moral faculties the
&ldquo;vicegerents of God within us,&rdquo; who &ldquo;never fail to
punish the violation of them by the torments of inward shame and
self-condemnation; and, on the contrary, always reward obedience with
tranquillity of mind, with contentment, and
self-satisfaction.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_48"
href="#Notech2_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> Even Hutcheson, who
raises the question why the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page52"></a>52</span>moral sense should not vary in different men
as the palate does, considers it from its very nature &ldquo;to be
designed for regulating and controlling all our powers.&rdquo;<a

<p>The authority of the moral law has been taken as a clear
manifestation of the objectivity of duty and as a testimony of the
subjectivistic fallacy. &ldquo;If moral approbation is a mere
feeling,&rdquo; says Dr. Rashdall, &ldquo;how can it claim any
superiority over other feelings?&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_50"
href="#Notech2_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> But if all external
motives of a social and religious character be put aside, it may be
fairly asked if the influence of the moral law upon the conduct of men
is really so great as well-meaning moralists try to make us believe.
It does not seem to command obedience in any exceptional degree, the
regard for it can hardly be called the mainspring of action. It is
only one spring out of many, and variable like all others. In some
instances it may be a dominant power in a man&rsquo;s life, in others
it is a voice calling in the wilderness; and the majority of people
seem to be more afraid of the blame or ridicule of their fellowmen, or
of the penalties with which the law of the country threatens them,
than of &ldquo;the vicegerents of God&rdquo; in their own hearts. Kant
speaks of &ldquo;the peace of conscience of so many (in their own
opinion conscientious) men, when &hellip; they have merely had the
good fortune to escape bad consequences.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_51" href="#Notech2_51"><span
class="sp">51</span></a> It has been said that mankind prefer the
possession of virtue to all other enjoyments, and look upon vice as
worse than any other misery;<a id="Anchornotech2_52"
href="#Notech2_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> that the pleasures
and pains of conscience are in the normally constituted mind far more
intense <span class="pagenum"><a id="page53"></a>53</span>and durable
than any other pleasures or pains.<a id="Anchornotech2_53"
href="#Notech2_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a> But as a matter of
fact, the obedience to the moral law, as to any ordinary law, is
seldom accompanied with any distinct feeling of pleasure at all: the
&ldquo;good&rdquo; conscience chiefly means the absence of a bad
one.<a id="Anchornotech2_54" href="#Notech2_54"><span
class="sp">54</span></a> And as for the bad conscience, I think we may
agree with Leslie Stephen that &ldquo;most men find nothing easier
than to suppress its stings, when some immediately bad consequence, or
the contempt and abhorrence of their neighbours, does not constantly
instil the venom.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_55"
href="#Notech2_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> It is said that
virtue bears in itself its own reward, and vice its own punishment.
But what an unjust retributor conscience is. The more a person
habituates himself to virtue the more he sharpens its sting, the
deeper he sinks in vice the more he blunts it. While the best men have
the most sensitive consciences, the worst have hardly any conscience
at all. We are reminded that men are rewarded for good and punished
for bad acts by the moral approval or disapproval of their neighbours.
But public opinion and law judge of detected acts only; their judgment
is seldom based upon an exhaustive examination of the case; all that
they require is formal compliance with the more elementary rules of
duty. Moreover, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page54"></a>54</span>a
person is respected or praised, blamed or despised, on other grounds
than his moral qualities; indeed, the admiration which men feel for
intellectual superiority, artistic genius, courage, strength, or even
accidental success, is often more intense than the admiration they
feel for virtue. Thus the supposed supremacy of the moral law receives
but scanty recognition in the practice and actual feelings of men. And
to say that, whether its dictates are obeyed or not, they ought to be
obeyed&mdash;or, as Butler put it, that conscience, &ldquo;had it
strength, as it has right; had it power, as it has manifest
authority,&hellip; would absolutely govern the world&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech2_56" href="#Notech2_56"><span
class="sp">56</span></a>&mdash;is simply to say that what ought to be
ought to be. There are even philosophers who have actually denied that
the moral values are the highest of all values.<a

<p>The authority assigned to conscience is really only an echo of the
social or religious sanctions of conduct: it belongs to the
&ldquo;public&rdquo; or the religious conscience, <i>vox populi</i> or
<i>vox dei</i>. In theory it may be admitted that every man ought to
act in accordance with his conscience. But this phrase is easily
forgotten when, in any matter of importance, the individual&rsquo;s
conscience comes into conflict with the common sense of his community;
or doubt may be thrown upon the sincerity of his professed
convictions, or he may be blamed for having such a conscience as he
has. There are philosophers, like Hobbes and Hegel, who <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page55"></a>55</span>have denied the citizen
the right of having a private conscience. The other external source
from which authority has been instilled into the moral law is the
alliance between morality and religion. In spite of all his efforts to
base his own moral theory on a non-theological basis, Dr. Rashdall
feels compelled to admit that, in his opinion, the belief in God is
the logical presupposition of an &ldquo;objective&rdquo; or absolute
morality. &ldquo;A moral ideal,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;can exist
nowhere and nohow but in a mind; an absolute moral ideal can exist
only in a Mind from which all Reality is derived. Our moral ideal can
only claim objective validity in so far as it can rationally be
regarded as the revelation of a moral ideal <span class="correction"
title="amended from 'externally'">eternally</span> existing in the
mind of God.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_58" href="#Notech2_58"><span
class="sp">58</span></a> So also Professor Bohlin, after a penetrating
review of the claim to objective validity made by normative moralists,
arrives at the conclusion that only a divine revelation can give
morality such a validity.<a id="Anchornotech2_59"
href="#Notech2_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> But the belief in
the authoritativeness of moral obligation may survive the religious
source from which it sprang and last after the alliance between
morality and religion has been broken. It has been pointed out by
Schopenhauer and others<a id="Anchornotech2_60"
href="#Notech2_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> that Kant&rsquo;s
categorical imperative, with its mysteriousness and awfulness, is
really an echo of the old religious formula &ldquo;Thou shalt,&rdquo;
though it is heard, not as the command of an external legislator, but
as a voice coming from within. Schiller wrote to Goethe, &ldquo;There
still remains something <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page56"></a>56</span>in Kant, as in Luther, that makes one think
of a monk who has left his monastery, but been unable to efface all
traces of it.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_61" href="#Notech2_61"><span

<p>The theological argument in favour of the objective validity of
moral judgments, which is based on belief in an all-good God who has
revealed his will to mankind, contains, of course, an assumption that
cannot be scientifically proved. But even if it could be proved, would
that justify the conclusion drawn from it? Those who maintain that
they in such a revelation possess an absolute moral standard and that,
consequently, any mode of conduct which is in accordance with it must
be objectively right, may be asked what they mean by an all-good God.
If God were not supposed to be all-good, we might certainly be induced
by prudence to obey his decrees, but they could not lay claim to moral
validity; suppose the devil were to take over the government of the
world, what influence would that have on the moral values&mdash;would
it make the right wrong and the wrong right? It is only the
all-goodness of God that can give his commandments absolute moral
validity. But to say that something is good because it is in
accordance with the will of an all-good God is to reason in a circle;
if goodness means anything, it must have a meaning which is
independent of his will. God is called good or righteous because he is
supposed to possess certain qualities that we are used to call so: he
is benevolent, he rewards virtue and punishes vice, and so forth. For
such reasons we add the attributes goodness and righteousness to his
other attributes, which express qualities of an objective character,
and by calling him all-good we attribute to him perfect goodness.<a
id="Anchornotech2_62" href="#Notech2_62"><span
class="sp">62</span></a> As a matter of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page57"></a>57</span>fact, there are also many theologians who
consider moral distinctions to be antecedent to the divine commands.
Thomas Aquinas and his school maintain that the right is not right
because God wills it, but that God wills it because it is right.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech2_62" href="#Anchornotech2_62">62</a></span> <i>Cf.</i>
Shaftesbury, <i>op. cit.</i>, ii. 49 <i>sq.</i>: &ldquo;Whoever thinks
there is a God, and pretends formally to believe that he is just and
good, must suppose that there is independently such a thing as justice
and injustice, truth and falsehood, right and wrong; according to
which he pronounces that God is just, righteous, and true.&rdquo; A
similar remark has been made by C. Stumpf (<i>Vom ethischen
Skeptizismus</i> [Leipzig, 1909], p. 22) and G. Heymans (<i>EinfÃ¼hrung
in die Ethik auf Grundlage der Erfahrung</i> [Leipzig, 1914], p.
8).</p></div>

<p>Before leaving this subject I must still mention a fact that has
made moralists so anxious to prove the objectivity of our moral
judgments, namely, the belief that ethical subjectivism is an
extremely dangerous doctrine. In a little book called <i>Is Conscience
an Emotion?</i>, largely written to oppose views held either by
Professor McDougall or myself, Dr. Rashdall remarks that &ldquo;the
scientific spirit does not require us to blind ourselves to the
practical consequences which hang upon the solution of not a few
scientific problems,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;assuredly there is no
scientific problem upon which so much depends as upon the answer we
give to the question whether the distinction which we are accustomed
to draw between right and wrong belongs to the region of objective
truth like the laws of mathematics and of physical science, or whether
it is based upon an actual emotional constitution of individual human
beings.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_63" href="#Notech2_63"><span
class="sp">63</span></a> He maintains that the emotionalist theory of
ethics, which leads to a denial of the objective validity of moral
judgments, &ldquo;is fatal to the deepest spiritual convictions and to
the highest spiritual aspirations of the human race,&rdquo; and that
it therefore is &ldquo;a matter of great practical as well as
intellectual importance&rdquo; that it should be rejected. &ldquo;To
deny the validity of the idea <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page58"></a>58</span>of duty,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has a strong
tendency to impair its practical influence on the individual&rsquo;s
life&rdquo;; and &ldquo;the belief in the objectivity of our moral
judgments is a necessary premiss for any valid argument for the belief
either in God, if by that be understood a morally good or perfect
Being, or in Immortality.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech2_64"
href="#Notech2_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> The last statement
is astounding. In another place Dean Rashdall argues that objective
morality presupposes the belief in God,<a id="Anchornotech2_65"
href="#Notech2_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> and now we are told
that any valid argument for the belief in God presupposes objective
morality. These two statements combined lead to the logical conclusion
that there is no valid evidence <i>either</i> for the existence of God
<i>or</i> for the objectivity of moral judgments.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that a scientific theory is not invalidated
by the mere fact that it is likely to cause mischief. The unfortunate
circumstance that there do exist dangerous things in the world, proves
that something may be dangerous and yet true. Another question is
whether the ethical subjectivism I am here advocating really is a
danger to morality. It cannot be depreciated by the same inference as
was drawn from the teaching of the ancient Sophists, namely, that if
that which appears to each man as right or good stands for that which
is right or good, then everybody has the natural right to follow his
caprice and inclinations and to hinder him doing so is an infringement
on his rights. My moral judgments spring from my own moral
consciousness; they judge of the conduct of other men not from their
point of view but from mine, not in accordance with their feelings and
opinions about right and wrong but according to my own. And these are
not arbitrary. We approve and disapprove because we cannot do
otherwise; our moral consciousness belongs to our mental constitution,
which we cannot <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page59"></a>59</span>change as we please. Can we help feeling pain
when the fire burns us? Can we help sympathizing with our friends? Are
these facts less necessary or less powerful in their consequences,
because they fall within the subjective sphere of our experience? So
also, why should the moral law command less obedience because it forms
a part of ourselves?</p>

<p>I think that ethical writers are often inclined to overrate the
influence of moral theory upon moral practice, but if there is any
such influence at all, it seems to me that ethical subjectivism,
instead of being a danger, is more likely to be an advantage to
morality. Could it be brought home to people that there is no absolute
standard in morality, they would perhaps be on the one hand more
tolerant and on the other hand more critical in their judgments.
Emotions depend on cognitions and are apt to vary according as the
cognitions vary; hence a theory which leads to an examination of the
psychological and historical origin of people&rsquo;s moral opinions
should be more useful than a theory which postulates moral truths
enunciated by self-evident intuitions that are unchangeable. In every
society the traditional notions as to what is good or bad, obligatory
or indifferent, are commonly accepted by the majority of people
without further reflection. By tracing them to their source it will be
found that not a few of these notions have their origin in ignorance
and superstition or in sentimental likes or dislikes, to which a
scrutinizing judge can attach little importance;<a
id="Anchornotech2_66" href="#Notech2_66"><span
class="sp">66</span></a> and, on the other hand, he must condemn many
an act or omission which public opinion, out of thoughtlessness,
treats with indifference. It will, moreover, appear that moral
estimates often survive the causes from which they sprang. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page60"></a>60</span>And what unprejudiced
person can help changing his views if he be persuaded that they have
no foundation in existing facts?</p>

href="#page108">108</a>, <a href="#page258">258</a>.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have thus arrived at the conclusion that neither the attempts of
moral philosophers or theologians to prove the objective validity of
moral judgments, nor the common sense assumption to the same effect,
give us any right at all to accept such a validity as a fact. So far,
however, I have only tried to show that it has not been proved; now I
am prepared to take a step further and assert that it cannot exist.
The reason for this is that in my opinion the predicates of all moral
judgments, all moral concepts, are ultimately based on emotions, and
that, as is very commonly admitted,<a id="Anchornotech2_67"
href="#Notech2_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> no objectivity can
come from an emotion. It is of course true or not that we in a given
moment have a certain emotion; but in no other sense can the
antithesis of true and false be applied to it. The belief that gives
rise to an emotion, the cognitive basis of it, is either true or
false; in the latter case the emotion may be said to be felt &ldquo;by
mistake&rdquo;&mdash;as when a person is frightened by some object in
the dark which he takes for a ghost, or is indignant with a person to
whom he imputes a wrong that has been committed by somebody else; but
this does not alter the nature of the emotion itself. We may call the
emotion of another individual <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page61"></a>61</span>&ldquo;unjustified,&rdquo; if we feel that we
ourselves should not have experienced the same emotion had we been in
his place, or, as in the case of moral approval or disapproval, if we
cannot share his emotion. But to speak, as Brentano does,<a
id="Anchornotech2_68" href="#Notech2_68"><span
class="sp">68</span></a> of &ldquo;right&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; emotions, springing from self-evident intuitions
and having the same validity as truth and error, is only another
futile attempt to objectivize our moral judgments. Heymans regards it
as self-evident that a good man deserves to be happy and a bad man
unhappy;<a id="Anchornotech2_69" href="#Notech2_69"><span
class="sp">69</span></a> but what is this &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; if not a
mere expression of the retributive character of the moral emotions? So
also other instances of the so-called <i>GefÃ¼hlsevidenz</i> are
nothing but psychological facts put into propositions.<a

<p>If there are no moral truths it cannot be the object of a science
of ethics to lay down rules for human conduct, since the aim of all
science is the discovery of some truth. Professor HÃ¶ffding argues that
the subjectivity of our moral valuations does not prevent ethics from
being a science any more than the subjectivity of our sensations
renders a science of physics impossible, because both are concerned
with finding the external facts that correspond to the subjective
processes.<a id="Anchornotech2_71" href="#Notech2_71"><span
class="sp">71</span></a> It may, of course, be a subject for
scientific inquiry to investigate the means which are conducive to
human happiness or welfare, and the results of such a study may also
be usefully applied by moralists, but it forms no more a part of
ethics than physics is a part of psychology. If the word
&ldquo;ethics&rdquo; is to be used as the name for a science, the
object of that science can only be to study the moral consciousness as
a fact.</p>

THE MORAL EMOTIONS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="noind"><span class="small">The</span> contention that all
moral concepts, which are used as predicates in moral judgments, are
ultimately based on emotions, is of course a claim that has to be
substantiated. First, what is the nature of those emotions?</p>

<p>Professor McDougall, though agreeing with me that original moral
judgments proceed directly from emotions, denies that there are any
specific emotions from which they spring. &ldquo;Judgment of
approval,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;may be prompted by admiration,
gratitude, positive self-feeling, or by any one of the emotions when
induced by way of the primitive sympathetic reaction; judgment of
disapproval springs most frequently from anger, either in its primary
uncomplicated form, or as an element in one of its secondary
combinations, such as shame, reproach, scorn, but also from fear and
disgust.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_1" href="#Notech3_1"><span
class="sp">1</span></a> But the question to be answered is not what
emotions may prompt people to pronounce moral judgments&mdash;there
are certainly many different emotions that may do that&mdash;but
whether there are any specific emotions that have led to the formation
of the concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, and all other moral
concepts, and therefore may be appropriately named moral emotions. I
maintain that there are two such emotions, both complex by nature, for
which I have used the traditional terms moral approval and moral <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page63"></a>63</span>disapproval or
indignation. They have, of course, in common certain characteristics
that make them moral emotions in distinction from other emotions of a
non-moral character, but at the same time both of them belong to a
wider class of emotions, which I have called retributive emotions.
Again, they differ from each other in points that make each of them
allied to certain non-moral retributive emotions, disapproval to anger
and revenge, and approval to what I have called non-moral retributive
kindly emotion, which in its most developed form is gratitude. They
may thus, on the one hand, be regarded as two distinct divisions of
the moral emotions, whilst, on the other hand, moral disapproval, like
anger and revenge, forms a subspecies of resentment, and approval,
like gratitude, forms a subspecies of retributive kindly emotion.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech3_1" href="#Anchornotech3_1">1</a></span> W. McDougall,
<i>An Introduction to Social Psychology</i> (London, 1926), p. 187
<i>sq.</i> <i>Cf.</i> J. Laird, <i>The Idea of Value</i> (Cambridge,
1929), p. 238.</p></div>

<p>Professor McDougall has criticized this scheme both in point of
terminology and classification. He has raised the objection that
approval and disapproval are not emotions but judgments, and that to
describe them as emotions is to perpetuate the chaos of psychological
terminology.<a id="Anchornotech3_2" href="#Notech3_2"><span
class="sp">2</span></a> My reply to this objection is that moral
approval or approbation and moral disapproval or disapprobation have
been used as terms for emotions by moralists and psychologists at
least from the eighteenth century and continue to be so used, even
after and in spite of Professor McDougall&rsquo;s criticism;<a
id="Anchornotech3_3" href="#Notech3_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
that their application both to judgments and emotions is parallel to
the varied meanings given to many other terms&mdash;he speaks himself
of revenge as an emotion, although it also means an act; and that he
has escaped the necessity of finding another name for moral approval
only by ignoring the emotion itself. He further <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page64"></a>64</span>reproaches me for
co-ordinating anger&mdash;including, of course, disinterested anger,
which he seems to identify with moral indignation&mdash;and revenge as
subspecies of resentment, which he describes as &ldquo;the fusion of
anger and positive self-feeling immediately evoked by an act of
aggression.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_4" href="#Notech3_4"><span
class="sp">4</span></a> But here again, in my use of the term
resentment, I may appeal to the traditional meaning of the term, for
which I may refer, <i>e.g.</i>, to Shaftesbury,<a id="Anchornotech3_5"
href="#Notech3_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Butler,<a
id="Anchornotech3_6" href="#Notech3_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
Bain,<a id="Anchornotech3_7" href="#Notech3_7"><span
class="sp">7</span></a> and the Oxford Dictionary; and I doubt whether
it helps to bring order into the chaos of psychological terminology to
invent a new meaning for it.</p>

<p>Professor McDougall also says that I have failed to see the
difference between anger and revenge. I have
written:&mdash;&ldquo;Resentment may be described as an aggressive
attitude of mind towards a cause of pain. Anger is sudden resentment,
in which the hostile reaction against the cause of pain is
unrestrained by deliberation. Revenge, on the other hand, is a more
deliberate form of non-moral resentment, in which the hostile reaction
is more or less restrained by reason and calculation.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_8" href="#Notech3_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
My view that the emotion of revenge is, generally speaking, more
deliberate than ordinary anger is, I believe, in agreement with the
common use of the terms;<a id="Anchornotech3_9"
href="#Notech3_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> but I have added that
it is impossible to draw any distinct limit between these two types of
resentment. Professor McDougall&rsquo;s criticism is provoked by the
fact that, in his view, anger is a &ldquo;primary&rdquo;<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page65"></a>65</span> emotion, whereas revenge
is a &ldquo;binary compound of anger and positive
self-feeling.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_10" href="#Notech3_10"><span
class="sp">10</span></a> He says I maintain &ldquo;against Steinmetz
that self-feeling is not an essential element in vengeful
emotion&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech3_11" href="#Notech3_11"><span

<p>According to Steinmetz, revenge is essentially rooted in the
feeling of power and superiority. It arises consequent on the
experience of injury, and its aim is to enhance the self-feeling,
which has been lowered or degraded by the injury suffered. It answers
this purpose best if it is directed against the aggressor himself, but
it is not essential to it that it should take any determinate
direction: <i>per se</i> and originally it is
&ldquo;undirected.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_12"
href="#Notech3_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> In examining in
detail all the facts adduced by Dr. Steinmetz as evidence for his
hypothesis of an original stage of undirected revenge I found that
they were no evidence at all. They only show that in certain
circumstances, either in a fit of passion or when the actual offender
is unknown or out of reach, some innocent person, who is in no way
connected with the inflictor of the injury, may become an object of
retaliation. There is such an intimate connection between the
suffering of an injury and the hostile reaction by which the injured
individual gives vent to his passion, that the reaction does not fail
to appear even when it misses its aim. In the institution of the
blood-feud some sort of collective responsibility is usually involved,
but here the guilt extends itself, as it were, in the eyes of the
offended party to the kinsmen of the manslayer; and besides, the
strong tendency to discrimination that characterizes resentment is not
wholly lost even behind the veil of common responsibility. We are
often <span class="pagenum"><a id="page66"></a>66</span>told that the
blood-feud is in the first place directed against the malefactor, and
against some relative of his only if he cannot be found; this is
stated even of so low savages as Australian natives.<a
id="Anchornotech3_13" href="#Notech3_13"><span
class="sp">13</span></a> After this criticism I made some remarks,
unnoticed by Professor McDougall, which bring my view of revenge much
nearer to his than his readers are made to believe. I wrote:
<a id="Anchornotech3_14" href="#Notech3_14"><span
class="sp">14</span></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do not mean to deny that violation of the
&lsquo;self-feeling&rsquo; is an extremely common and powerful
incentive to resentment. It is so among savage and civilized men
alike; even dogs and monkeys get angry when laughed at. Nothing more
easily arouses in us anger and a desire for retaliation, nothing is
more difficult to forgive, than an act which indicates contempt, or
disregard of our feelings. Long after the bodily pain of a blow has
ceased, the mental suffering caused by the insult remains and calls
for vengeance. This is an old truth often told. According to Seneca,
&lsquo;the greater part of the things which enrage us are insults, not
injuries.&rsquo; Plutarch observes that, though different persons fall
into anger for different reasons, yet in nearly all of them is to be
found the idea of their being despised or neglected.
&lsquo;Contempt,&rsquo; says Bacon, &lsquo;is that which putteth an
edge upon anger, as much, or more, than the hurt itself.&rsquo; But
&hellip; in all cases revenge implies, primordially and essentially, a
desire to cause pain or destruction in return for hurt suffered,
whether the hurt be bodily or mental; and if to this impulse is added
a desire to enhance the wounded &lsquo;self-feeling,&rsquo; that does
not interfere with the true nature of the primary feeling of revenge.
There are genuine specimens of resentment without the co-operation of
self-regarding pride; and, on the other hand, the reaction of the
wounded &lsquo;self-feeling&rsquo; is not necessarily, in the first
place, concerned with the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page67"></a>67</span>infliction of pain. If a person has written a
bad book which is severely criticized, he may desire to repair his
reputation by writing a better book, not by humiliating his critics;
and if he attempts the latter rather than the former, he does so not
merely in order to enhance his &lsquo;self-feeling,&rsquo; but because
he is driven on by revenge.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_15"

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech3_15" href="#Anchornotech3_15">15</a></span> It must be due
to careless reading of this sentence that Prof. McDougall (<i>op.
cit.</i>, p. 122 <i>sq.</i>) makes the following confused
remark:&mdash;&ldquo;Westermarck seeks to support his view (I suppose
the view that &lsquo;self-feeling is not an essential element in
vengeful emotion&rsquo;) by saying that, if one has written a book and
it has been adversely criticized, though our self-feeling receives a
painful check we do not seek vengeance on the critic but rather set
out to write a better book. Now, it is dangerous to trust to the
consideration of the emotions of the most cultivated and intellectual
class of men in seeking light on the origin of the emotions, but I
think that most authors would avenge themselves on the unjust and
damaging critic, if they could find an easy opportunity; and our
literary disputes frequently are but the most refined expression of
this emotion.&rdquo; Surely Prof. McDougall could no more than myself
consider the writing of a better book to be an act of revenge if no
anger be connected with it, since he regards anger as an essential
element in revenge.</p></div>

<p>If I, instead of saying that violation of the self-feeling is an
extremely common incentive to resentment (by which I did not mean
merely revenge), had said that it is a regular incentive to revenge,
which I have not denied and which is most probably true, there would,
so far as I can see, be no real disagreement between Professor
McDougall and myself as to the nature of revenge. He says himself that
his account of revenge is nearer to that of Steinmetz than to mine;
but I doubt the accuracy of this statement, as he recognizes anger as
one element in revenge and regards anger not as undirected, but as
essentially directed against the object or person provoking it.<a
id="Anchornotech3_16" href="#Notech3_16"><span
class="sp">16</span></a> Both of us agree that a violent assertion of
one&rsquo;s power is not an adequate characteristic of the act in
which revenge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68"></a>68</span>seeks
its satisfaction. And I find no reason to dispute Professor
McDougall&rsquo;s view that revenge is a &ldquo;fusion of anger and
positive self-feeling &hellip; developed within the system of the
self-regarding sentiment&mdash;to which circumstance it owes its
persistent character&mdash;with the addition of painful feeling
arising from the continued thwarting of the two impulses.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_17" href="#Notech3_17"><span
class="sp">17</span></a> But I maintain that thwarting of the
self-feeling is also a very frequent, though of course not a
necessary, incentive to anger, and cannot, therefore, be regarded as a
characteristic by which revenge is distinguished from anger. As Dr.
Shand observes, anger &ldquo;may be aroused by the sharp and sudden
pain of a blow, or by being insulted, scorned, mocked at, or even
neglected.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_18" href="#Notech3_18"><span
class="sp">18</span></a> Indeed, Professor McDougall seems himself to
have been unable to uphold his distinction between anger and revenge.
He says, &ldquo;If a man strikes me a sudden and unprovoked
blow,&hellip; the impulse, the thwarting of which in this case
provokes my anger, is the impulse of self-assertion.&rdquo;<a

<p>In classifying certain emotions under the common heading
&ldquo;resentment&rdquo; I have done so because they may all be
described as a hostile attitude of mind towards a living being, or
something taken for a living being, as a cause of pain, whatever the
circumstances may be that have aroused it in each particular case.
This common characteristic seems to me a most legitimate ground of
classification on account of the uniformity of its function and its
extreme importance in the life of the species. Resentment, like
protective reflex action, from which it has gradually developed, is a
means of protection for the animal owing to its tendency to remove a
cause of danger. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69"></a>69</span>The
disposition to experience it may consequently be regarded as an
element in the animal&rsquo;s mental constitution which has been
acquired through the influence of natural selection in the struggle
for existence. In comparison with these facts it is a matter of minor
importance whether the hostile reaction is connected with a thwarting
of the self-feeling or not. Indeed, as this may be the case not only
in revenge but also in anger, it is, for this reason also, impossible
to draw any distinct limit between these two types of resentment. Nor
is it possible to discern where an actual desire to inflict pain comes
in. We may assume that in its primitive form anger, even when directed
against a living being, could not have been connected with a
representation of the enemy as suffering. But as a successful attack
is necessarily accompanied with such suffering, the desire to produce
it naturally became, with the increase of intelligence, an important
factor in resentment. And when pain was distinguished as a normal
effect of resentment, the infliction of it could also be aimed at as
an end in itself. Resentment is particularly apt to assume this
character under the influence of the self-feeling of the injured
party, as a means of humiliating the offender.<a id="Anchornotech3_20"

<p>That moral disapproval is closely connected with non-moral
resentment is indicated by language: we may feel indignant on other
than moral grounds, and we may feel &ldquo;righteous anger.&rdquo; The
relationship between these emotions is also conspicuous in their
outward expressions, which, when the emotion is strong enough, present
similar characteristics. When possessed with deep moral indignation, a
person looks as if he were angry, and so he really is, in the wider
sense of the term. This relationship has been ignored by those who
have described moral approval and disapproval merely as feelings of
pleasure or pain. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page70"></a>70</span>Yet it was recognized already some two
thousand years ago in a remarkable passage of the Greek historian
Polybius, who wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;If a man has been rescued or helped
in an hour of danger, and, instead of showing gratitude to his
preserver, seeks to do him harm, it is clearly probable that the rest
will be displeased and offended with him when they know it,
sympathizing with their neighbour and imagining themselves in his
case. Hence arises a notion in every breast of the meaning and theory
of duty, which is in fact the beginning and end of justice.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_21" href="#Notech3_21"><span
class="sp">21</span></a> Hartley regarded resentment and gratitude as
&ldquo;intimately connected with the moral sense&rdquo;;<a
id="Anchornotech3_22" href="#Notech3_22"><span
class="sp">22</span></a> and Adam Smith made the resentment and
gratitude of the &ldquo;impartial spectator&rdquo; a corner stone of
his theory of the moral sentiments. The elaborate and acute arguments
with which he supported his moral theory could not fail to exercise
some influence on subsequent moral philosophy, but though his book on
the subject rapidly won popularity when it first appeared, it was
afterwards largely forgotten, save by historians of philosophy, whose
remarks on it, in England, were generally frigid and sometimes almost
contemptuous.<a id="Anchornotech3_23" href="#Notech3_23"><span
class="sp">23</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page71"></a>71</span>For my own part I maintain that Adam
Smith&rsquo;s <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> is the most important
contribution to moral psychology made by any British thinker, and that
it is so in the first place on account of the emphasis it lays on the
retributive character of the moral emotions.</p>

writes (<i>History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</i>,
ii. [London, 1927], p. 77):&mdash;&ldquo;It is impossible to resist
the impression &hellip; that we are not listening to a thinker really
grappling with a difficult problem, so much as to an ambitious
professor who has found an excellent opportunity for displaying his
command of language, and making brilliant lectures.&hellip;
Smith&rsquo;s main proposition was hardly original.&rdquo; In the
historical survey of moral theories in J. M. Wilson&rsquo;s and T.
Fowler&rsquo;s <i>Principles of Morals</i> (Oxford, 1886), it is said
to be unnecessary to speak of his ethical philosophy at any length
(<i>Introductory Chapters</i>, p. 61). Dr. J. Bonar (<i>Moral
Sense</i> [London, 1930], p. 168) asserts that it has needed all the
fame of Adam Smith&rsquo;s second book, <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>,
&ldquo;to keep alive the memory of his first, which founded no school,
and is usually passed over with the faint praise due to the
author&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo; In striking contrast with this is
the regard which German historians of philosophy have shown for Adam
Smith&rsquo;s book on the <i>Moral Sentiments</i>. A new German
edition of it appeared only a few years ago.</p></div>

<p>As there are varieties of non-moral resentment so there are also
varieties of moral disapproval. Under the influence of the altruistic
sentiment its aggressiveness has been subject to modifications. At its
earlier stages the desire to cause suffering or destruction to the
offender is a very marked characteristic of it. To take revenge on an
enemy is regarded as a duty, or, in other words, the omission to do so
calls forth moral disapproval. This is the case not only in the savage
world. In the Old Testament the spirit of vindictiveness pervades both
the men and their God; it is the duty of a man to avenge the murder of
his relative,<a id="Anchornotech3_24" href="#Notech3_24"><span
class="sp">24</span></a> and the enemies of Yahveh can expect no mercy
from him, but utter destruction is their lot. To do good to a friend
and to do harm to an enemy was a maxim of the ancient Scandinavians.<a
id="Anchornotech3_25" href="#Notech3_25"><span
class="sp">25</span></a> It was taken as a matter of course by popular
opinion in Greece<a id="Anchornotech3_26" href="#Notech3_26"><span
class="sp">26</span></a> and Rome. According to Aristotle, &ldquo;it
belongs to the courageous man never to be worsted&rdquo;; to take
revenge on a foe rather than to be reconciled is just, and therefore
honourable.<a id="Anchornotech3_27" href="#Notech3_27"><span
class="sp">27</span></a> Cicero defines a good man as a person
&ldquo;who serves whom he can, and injures none save when provoked by
injury.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_28" href="#Notech3_28"><span

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page72"></a>72</span>That revenge is
considered a duty implies, of course, that the person on whom it is
incumbent is an object of moral blame if he does not perform that
duty; but behind this censure there is obviously a desire to see the
injurer suffer. Yet the moral disapproval may in these cases differ
from the revenge of the offended party as to the intensity of
suffering required by it. Sometimes his feeling of revenge may seem to
outsiders to be too weak or too much checked by other impulses, but in
other cases it appears unduly great. In early society we often find
that the practice of revenge is regulated by a rule that requires
equivalence between the injury and the suffering inflicted in return
for it. Sometimes this rule demands that only one life shall be taken
for one, sometimes that a manslayer shall die in the same manner as
his victim, sometimes that other injuries also shall be retaliated by
the infliction of similar injuries on the offenders.<a
id="Anchornotech3_29" href="#Notech3_29"><span
class="sp">29</span></a> This strict equivalence is not characteristic
of resentment as such. There is undoubtedly a certain proportion
between the injury inflicted and the resentful reaction; other things
being equal, the resentment increases in intensity along with the pain
arousing it. The more a person feels offended, the greater is his
desire to retaliate by inflicting counter-pain, and the greater is the
pain he desires to inflict. Moreover, the desire to pull down the
humiliating arrogance of the aggressor is naturally influenced by the
idea of paying him back in his own coin; and it is probable that the
disposition to imitate, especially in cases of sudden anger, acts in
the same direction. But resentment involves no accurate balancing of
suffering against suffering, hence there may be a crying disproportion
between the act of revenge and the injury that provoked it.<a
id="Anchornotech3_30" href="#Notech3_30"><span
class="sp">30</span></a> As Sir Thomas Browne observes, a revengeful
mind &ldquo;holds no <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page73"></a>73</span>rule in retaliation, requiring too often a
head for a tooth, and the supreme revenge for trespasses, which a
night&rsquo;s rest should obliterate.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_31"
href="#Notech3_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> The <i>lex
talionis</i>, which requires equivalence between suffering and
suffering, has undoubtedly a social origin. If the offender is a
person with whose feelings men are ready to sympathize, their sympathy
will keep the desire to see him suffer within certain limits; and if,
in ordinary circumstances, they tend to sympathize equally with both
parties, the injurer and the person injured, and in consequence confer
upon these equal rights, they will demand a retaliation that is only
equal in degree to the offence. If this explanation is correct, the
rule of equivalence must originally have been restricted to offences
within the social group; for according to early custom and law only
members of the same society have equal rights. In speaking of the
tit-for-tat system prevalent among the Guiana Indians, Sir E. F. Im
Thurn expressly says, &ldquo;Of course all this refers chiefly to the
mutual relations of members of the same tribe.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_32" href="#Notech3_32"><span
class="sp">32</span></a> And when we find savages acting according to
the same principle in their relations to other tribes, the reason for
this may be sought partly in the strong hold which that principle has
taken of their minds, and partly in the dangers accompanying
intertribal revenge, which make it desirable to restrict it within
reasonable limits. The desire that the offender shall suffer and the
desire that his suffering shall correspond to his guilt have also
contributed to the substitution of punishment for revenge and to the
rise of a judicial organization. For as long as retaliation is in the
hands of private individuals, there is no guarantee, on the one hand,
that the offender will have to suffer, on the other <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page74"></a>74</span>hand, that the act of
retaliation will be sufficiently discriminating.<a

<p>The more the moral consciousness is influenced by the altruistic
sentiment, the more severely it condemns any retributive infliction of
pain that it regards as undeserved; and it seems to be in the first
place with a view to preventing such injustice that teachers of
morality have enjoined upon men to forgive their enemies. Side by side
with the doctrine of resentment we find among peoples of culture the
doctrine of forgiveness. In Leviticus there is the rule, &ldquo;Thou
shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy
people.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_34" href="#Notech3_34"><span
class="sp">34</span></a> Sirach, who counts among the nine causes of a
man&rsquo;s happiness to see the fall of his enemy, says in another
passage, &ldquo;Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he has done unto
thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_35" href="#Notech3_35"><span
class="sp">35</span></a> According to the Talmud he who does not
persecute those who persecute him, and he who takes an offence in
silence, are the friends of God.<a id="Anchornotech3_36"
href="#Notech3_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> The Koran, while
repeating the old rule, &ldquo;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth,&rdquo; at the same time teaches that paradise is &ldquo;for
those who repress their rage, and those who pardon men&rdquo;;<a
id="Anchornotech3_37" href="#Notech3_37"><span
class="sp">37</span></a> and according to Mohammedan tradition the
Prophet laid down the rule, &ldquo;Resolve that if people do good to
you, you will do good to them, and if they oppress you, oppress them
not again.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_38" href="#Notech3_38"><span
class="sp">38</span></a> The principle of forgiveness had also <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page75"></a>75</span>advocates in Greece and
Rome. In one of the Platonic dialogues Socrates says, &ldquo;We ought
not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any one, whatever evil we
may have suffered from him&rdquo;; though he adds that &ldquo;this
opinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any
considerable number of persons.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_39"
href="#Notech3_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> The Stoics condemned
anger as unnatural and unreasonable. According to Seneca, &ldquo;it is
the part of a great mind to despise wrongs done to it&rdquo;; but he
also shrewdly remarks that &ldquo;the most contemptuous form of
revenge is not to deem one&rsquo;s adversary worth taking vengeance
upon.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_40" href="#Notech3_40"><span
class="sp">40</span></a> The Chinese philosopher Lao-Tsze said,
&ldquo;Recompense injury with kindness.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_41"
href="#Notech3_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> In the Laws of Manu,
the mythical Hindu legislator, the rule is laid down that a twice-born
man should not show anger against one who is angry, but bless any one
who curses him.<a id="Anchornotech3_42" href="#Notech3_42"><span
class="sp">42</span></a> In the Buddhist Dhammapada it is said,
&ldquo;Let a man overcome anger by love; let him overcome evil by
good; let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by
truth.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_43" href="#Notech3_43"><span

<p>The rule of retaliation and the rule of forgiveness are not so
radically opposed to each other as they may appear to be. What the
latter condemns is really not every kind of resentment, but non-moral
resentment, not impartial indignation but personal hatred. It
prohibits revenge but not punishment. According to the Laws of Manu
crime was so indispensably to be followed by punishment, that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page76"></a>76</span>if the king pardoned a
thief or a perpetrator of violence, instead of slaying or striking
him, the guilt fell on the king.<a id="Anchornotech3_44"
href="#Notech3_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> Jesus was certainly
not free from righteous indignation. It does not appear that he ever
forgave the legalists who sinned against the kingdom of God, and he
told his disciples that if a brother who had trespassed against his
brother neglected to hear the church, he should be looked upon as a
heathen and a publican.<a id="Anchornotech3_45"
href="#Notech3_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> Christian writers
have laid much stress upon the circumstance that Jesus enjoined men to
forgive their own enemies, but not to abstain from resenting injuries
done to others. According to Thomas Aquinas, &ldquo;the good bear with
the wicked to this extent, that, so far as it is proper to do so, they
patiently endure at their hands the injuries done to themselves; but
they do not bear with them to the extent of enduring the injuries done
to God and their neighbours.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_46"
href="#Notech3_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> Yet it would be
absurd to blame a person for expressing moral indignation at an act
simply because he himself happens to be the offended party;
practically we allow him to be even more indignant than the impartial
spectator would be, whereas excessive placability often meets with
censure. We agree with Aristotle that anger admits not only of an
excess but of a defect,<a id="Anchornotech3_47"
href="#Notech3_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> and that &ldquo;to
submit to insult, or to overlook an insult offered to our friends,
shows a slavish spirit.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_48"

<p>The aggressive character of moral disapproval has become modified
not only by a more scrutinizing attitude towards resentment and
retaliation, but also by a condemnation of causing suffering merely
for the sake of retribution. For ages it was looked upon as a matter
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page77"></a>77</span>course that if a
person had committed a crime he should have to suffer for it. This is
still the notion of the multitude, as also of a host of theorizers,
who by calling punishment an expiation, or a reparation, or a
restoration of the disturbed equilibrium of justice, or some similar
term, only endeavour to give a philosophical sanction to a social
institution rooted in an emotion. The infliction of pain, however, is
not an act which the moral consciousness regards with indifference
even in the case of a criminal; and to many enlightened minds with
keen sympathy for human suffering it has appeared both unreasonable
and cruel that the State should wilfully torment him to no purpose.
Retributive punishment is condemned; but punishment itself is
defended. It is only looked upon in a different light, not as an end
in itself, but as a means of attaining an end. It is to be inflicted
not because wrong has been done, but in order that wrong be not done.
Its object is held to be either to deter from crime, or to reform the
criminal, or by means of elimination or seclusion to make it
physically impossible for him to commit fresh crimes. These views were
expressed already in Greek and Roman antiquity. In a later age the
view taken by Hobbes, that &ldquo;the aym of Punishment is not a
revenge, but terrour,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_49"
href="#Notech3_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> remained for a long
time the leading doctrine on the subject among philosophers as well as
legislators. During the nineteenth century the principle of determent
was largely superseded by the principle of reformation; and a new
school of criminologists advocated the opinion that punishment should
aim at repressing crime by an &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; or
&ldquo;relative&rdquo; elimination of the criminal, that is, in
extreme cases by killing him, but generally by incarcerating him in a
criminal lunatic asylum, or by banishing him for ever or for a certain
period, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78"></a>78</span>or by
interdicting him from a particular neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech3_49" href="#Anchornotech3_49">49</a></span> Hobbes,
<i>Leviathan</i>, ii. 28 (Oxford, 1881), p. 243.</p></div>

<p>For my own part I maintain that those theorists who think it
possible to make punishment independent of moral resentment are
victims of an illusion.<a id="Anchornotech3_50"
href="#Notech3_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> Let us consider some
consequences to which the principles of determent and reformation
might lead if each of them were carried out consistently. The
principle of elimination may at once be put aside, because it has no
reference to the punishment of criminals, although it contains a
suggestion&mdash;and a most excellent one&mdash;as to the proper mode
of treating them. Their exclusion from the company of their
fellow-men&mdash;not to speak of their elimination by
death&mdash;certainly entails suffering, but according to the
principle in question this suffering is not directly <i>intended</i>.
On the other hand, punishment, in the ordinary sense of the word,
always involves an express intention to inflict pain, whatever be the
object in inflicting it. We do not punish an ill-natured dog when we
tie him up in order to prevent him from doing harm, nor do we punish a
lunatic by confining him in a madhouse.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech3_50" href="#Anchornotech3_50">50</a></span> The arguments
adduced by Dr. Ewing in his recent book, <i>The Morality of
Punishment</i> (London, 1929), coincide in many respects with mine,
which I have previously stated in my <i>Moral Ideas</i>, vol. ii. p.
82 <i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>According to the principle of determent the infliction of suffering
in consequence of an offence is justified only as a means of
increasing public safety: the offender is sacrificed for the common
weal. But why should the punishment necessarily be restricted to the
offender? It might be a more effective way of deterring from crime to
punish his children as well or, if he cannot be caught, to punish them
only; and if the notions of desert and justice derived all their
import from the socially useful result achieved by the punishment,
there would be nothing unjust in doing <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page79"></a>79</span>so. The only objection which from this point
of view could ever be raised against the practice of visiting the
wrongdoings of the fathers upon the children, is that it is needlessly
severe; the innocence of the children could count for nothing.
Professor Carveth Read has argued against me that we are then
&ldquo;supposed to entirely disregard the feelings, or the rights, of
the innocent.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_51" href="#Notech3_51"><span
class="sp">51</span></a> But why should we have to regard their
feelings more than those of the offender, if the infliction of
suffering in both cases serves the same useful end, the deterring from
crime? Moreover, if the object of punishment is merely preventive, the
heaviest punishment should be threatened where the strongest motive is
needed to restrain, and an injury committed under great temptation, or
in a passion, should consequently be punished with particular
severity. To this Professor Read remarks that &ldquo;great temptation
and passion exclude the consideration of other motives; so that
threats are useless.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_52"
href="#Notech3_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> But if they are
useless, why should there in such cases be any punishment at all?</p>

<p>Again, if punishment were to be regulated by the principle of
reforming the criminal, the result would in some cases be very
astonishing. There is no set of offenders more difficult to reform
than habitual vagrants and drunkards, whereas experience has shown
that the most easily reformed of all offenders is often some person
who has committed a serious crime. If reformation is the only end of
punishment, the latter should soon be set free, while the petty
offender might have to be shut up for all his life. Nay more, if the
criminal proves absolutely incorrigible and not the slightest hope of
his reformation is left, there would no longer be any reason for
punishing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80"></a>80</span>him at
all.<a id="Anchornotech3_53" href="#Notech3_53"><span
class="sp">53</span></a> Professor Read makes the remark, &ldquo;As if
determent and repression should count for nothing&rdquo;;<a
id="Anchornotech3_54" href="#Notech3_54"><span
class="sp">54</span></a> but I am here speaking of the principle of
reformation alone, not of a combination of different principles. The
reformationist may also be asked why he does not try some more humane
method of improving people&rsquo;s characters than the infliction of
suffering.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that theories which are open to such objections
should have been able to attract so many intelligent partisans. These
theories must at least possess a certain plausibility. If punishment
on the one hand springs from moral indignation and on the other hand
is frequently interpreted as a means either of deterring from crime or
of reforming the criminal, there must obviously be some connection
between these ends and the retributive aim of moral resentment. There
must be certain facts that to some extent lessen the gap between the
theory of retribution and the other theories of punishment.</p>

<p>The doctrine of determent regards punishment as a means of
preventing crime. A crime implies that a person&rsquo;s behaviour is a
cause of pain. The one thing which men try to prevent for its own sake
is pain, and the one thing which causes resentment is likewise pain.
There must consequently be a general coincidence between the courses
of behaviour that people resent and those which the law would punish
if it were framed on the principle of determent. But the resemblance
between the desire to deter and resentment is greater still.
Resentment is not only aroused by pain, but is a hostile attitude
towards its cause, and its tendency is to remove this cause, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81"></a>81</span>is, to prevent pain.
An act of moral resentment is therefore apt to resemble a punishment
inflicted with a view to deterring from crime, provided that the
punishment is directed against the cause of crime&mdash;the criminal
himself&mdash;and its severity is proportioned to his guilt.</p>

<p>The doctrine of reformation aims at the removal of a criminal
disposition of mind by improving the offender. Moral resentment
likewise aims at the removal of a volitional cause of pain, by
bringing about repentance in the offender. That repentance ought to be
followed by forgiveness, partial or total, is a widely recognized
moral claim. But it does not only blunt the edge of moral indignation
and recommend the offender to the mercy of men and gods: it is the
sole ground on which pardon can be given by a scrupulous judge. When
sufficiently guided by deliberation and left to itself, without being
unduly checked by other feelings, moral resentment is apt to be felt
as long as its cause remains unaltered, that is, until the will of the
offender has ceased to be offensive; and it ceases to be offensive
only when he acknowledges his guilt and repents. He who commanded his
followers to forgive a brother for his trespass at the same time
pronounced the qualification: &ldquo;If he repent.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_55" href="#Notech3_55"><span
class="sp">55</span></a> It is worth noticing that when moral
indignation is appeased by repentance, and repentance alone, it is so,
not on account of its specifically moral character, but because it is
a form of resentment. The angry or revengeful man is also apt to be in
a similar way influenced by the sincere apologies of the offender. As
Aristotle said, men are placable in regard to those who acknowledge
and repent their guilt: &ldquo;there is proof of this in the case of
chastising servants; for we chastize more violently those who
contradict us, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82"></a>82</span>and
deny their guilt; but towards such as acknowledge themselves to be
justly punished we cease from our wrath.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_56" href="#Notech3_56"><span
class="sp">56</span></a> No doubt, in the case of revenge external
satisfaction or material compensation is often allowed to take the
place of genuine repentance, and the humiliation of the adversary may
be sufficient to quiet the angry passion. But the revenge felt by a
reflecting mind is not so readily satisfied: it wants effectively to
remove the cause that aroused it. The object which resentment is
chiefly intent upon, Adam Smith observes, &ldquo;is not so much to
make our enemy feel pain in his turn, as to make him conscious that he
feels it upon account of his past conduct, to make him repent of that
conduct, and to make him sensible, that the person whom he injured did
not deserve to be treated in that manner.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_57" href="#Notech3_57"><span
class="sp">57</span></a> The delight of revenge, says Bacon,
&ldquo;seemeth to be not so much in doing the hurt, as in making the
party repent.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech3_58" href="#Notech3_58"><span
class="sp">58</span></a></p>

<p>We can now see the origin of the notion that the end of punishment
should be the reformation of the criminal. This principle emphasizes
the most humane element in resentment, the demand that the
offender&rsquo;s will shall cease to be offensive; hence the doctrine
of reformation has itself a retributive origin. This explains the
fact, otherwise inexplicable, that the amendment which it has in view
is to be effected by the infliction of pain. It also accounts for the
inconsistent attitude of the reformationist towards incorrigible
offenders. Resentment gives way to forgiveness only in the case of
repentance, not in the case of incorrigibility. Hence if the
reformationist does not regard incorrigibility as a legitimate ground
for exempting a person from punishment, he has to admit that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page83"></a>83</span>punishment is justified
also on some other ground than the reformation of the criminal.</p>

<p>Thus the theories both of determent and of reformation are
ultimately offspring of the same emotion that first induced men to
inflict punishment on their fellow-creatures. It escaped the advocates
of these theories that they themselves were under the influence of the
very principle they fought against, because they failed to grasp its
true import. Rightly understood, resentment is preventive in its
nature, and when sufficiently deliberate, regards the infliction of
suffering as a means rather than as an end. It not only gives rise to
punishment, but readily suggests as its proper end either determent or
amendment or both. But first of all, moral resentment raises a protest
against wrong. And whatever theorists may say on the matter, its
immediate aim has always been to give expression to the righteous
indignation of the society which inflicts it.</p>

<p>Now it may be thought that men have no right to give vent to their
moral resentment in a way which hurts their neighbours unless some
benefit may be expected from it. In the case of many other emotions we
hold that the conative element in the emotion ought not to be allowed
to develop into a distinct volition or act; and it would seem that a
similar view might be taken with reference to the aggressiveness of
moral disapproval. It is a notion of this kind that is at the bottom
of the utilitarian theories of punishment. They are protests against
purposeless infliction of suffering, against crude ideas of
retributive justice, against theories hardly in advance of the
feelings of the popular mind. If they are open to objections which
seem incontestable, that is certainly due to other circumstances than
their demand that punishment shall serve a useful end. Punishment must
be kept within the limits <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page84"></a>84</span>recognized as legitimate by the moral
consciousness, and, as I have tried to show, the consequences to which
the purely utilitarian theories might lead transgress these limits. On
the other hand, it may be said that while those theories seem to
exaggerate the deterring or reforming influence which punishment
exercises upon criminals, they in other respects take too narrow a
view of its social usefulness. Whether its voice inspire fear or not,
whether it awaken a sleeping conscience or not, punishment at all
events tells people in plain terms what, in the opinion of the
society, they must not do. It gives the multitude a severe lesson in
public morality; and it is difficult to see how quite the same effect
could be attained by any other method. Retaliation is such a
spontaneous expression of indignation that people would hardly realize
the offensiveness of an act that evoked no signs of resentment. Of
course, punishment in the legal sense of the term is only one
form&mdash;the most concrete form&mdash;of public retaliation; it is,
indeed, probable that public opinion exercises a greater influence
than punishment would do without its aid.<a id="Anchornotech3_59"
href="#Notech3_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> But punishment in
combination with public opinion has no doubt in some measure an
educating, and not merely a deterring, influence on the members of a
society. As Sir James Stephen observes, &ldquo;the sentence of the law
is to the moral sentiment of the public in relation to any offence
what a seal is to hot wax. It converts into a permanent final judgment
what might otherwise be a transient sentiment.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech3_60" href="#Notech3_60"><span
class="sp">60</span></a> Moreover, it must not be overlooked that the
infliction of punishment upon the perpetrator of a grave offence
gratifies a strong general desire, and even if the dissatisfaction
that accompanies <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85"></a>85</span>an
ungratified desire does not by itself afford a sufficient
justification for subjecting the offender to suffering, other more
serious consequences would undoubtedly in many cases result from
leaving him unpunished. Public indignation might find a vent in some
less regular and less discriminating mode of retaliation, like
lynching; or private retaliation would take the place of
punishment.</p>

<p>A modification of the aggressive element in moral disapproval is,
finally, apparent in the attempt to narrow the channel of its activity
by the rule that we should hate not the sinner but only the sin. This
may be a beautiful maxim, but can it be realized? To hate a certain
act implies hatred of its volitional element, the intention of him who
performs the act; but to separate a volition from the will that wills
it is of course impossible. Hence the hostile reaction against the sin
must turn against the sinner. We have seen that while deliberate and
discriminating resentment aims at influencing the offender&rsquo;s
will, its immediate desire is nevertheless to inflict suffering; and
it may be questioned whether the hatred of the sin without any such
desire would be anything more than a strong dislike similar to that
which we feel for a nasty animal or a heap of dirt. It is the
instinctive desire to inflict counter-pain&mdash;not necessarily
physical&mdash;that gives to moral indignation its most important
characteristic. Without it, moral condemnation and the ideas of right
and wrong would never have come into existence. Without it, we should
no more condemn a bad man than a poisonous plant. The reason why moral
judgments are passed on volitional beings, or their behaviour, is not
merely that they are volitional, but that they are sensitive as well;
and however much we try to concentrate our indignation on the act, it
derives its distinctive character from being directed against a
sensitive agent. I have heard persons <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page86"></a>86</span>assert that a wrong act awakens in them only
sorrow or compassion; but then I strongly suspect that they do not
understand their own minds. I do not think there is any man who does
not in some measure resent a gross injury of which he himself is the
victim; and I refuse to believe that there is any one who is so
utterly incapable of feeling sympathetic resentment on behalf of an
injured fellow-creature, that he, even in a case of the greatest
atrocity, could be merely sorry for the offender. And in any case,
could even the most ardent anti-retributionist imagine that he, quite
apart from any utilitarian considerations, would feel the same
sympathy with a person who suffers on account of some wrong he has
committed, as with one who suffers innocently? It is one of the most
interesting facts relating to the moral consciousness of the most
humane type, that it in vain condemns the gratification of the very
desire from which it sprang. It reminds one of a man of low extraction
who, in spite of all acquired refinement, still bears his origin
stamped on his face.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While resentment is a hostile attitude of mind towards a living
being (or something taken for a living being) as a cause of pain,
retributive kindly emotion is a friendly attitude of mind towards such
a being as a cause of pleasure. Just as in the lower forms of anger
there can be no definite desire to produce suffering, so in the lower
forms of retributive kindliness there can be no definite desire to
produce pleasure. When an emotion of a non-moral kind contains such a
desire to give pleasure in return for pleasure received, it is called
gratitude. Intermingled with gratitude there is often a feeling of
indebtedness: he upon whom a benefit has been conferred feels himself
a debtor and regards the benefactor in a way as <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page87"></a>87</span>his creditor. This feeling
has even been represented as essential to, or as a condition of,
gratitude;<a id="Anchornotech3_61" href="#Notech3_61"><span
class="sp">61</span></a> but it is one thing to be grateful and
another thing to feel that it is one&rsquo;s duty to requite a
benefit. A depression of the self-feeling, a feeling of humiliation,
also frequently accompanies gratitude as a motive for such a requital;
but I cannot consider it a necessary element in gratitude itself.<a
id="Anchornotech3_62" href="#Notech3_62"><span
class="sp">62</span></a> We may be grateful without experiencing such
a feeling,<a id="Anchornotech3_63" href="#Notech3_63"><span
class="sp">63</span></a> and we may be anxious to repay a benefit
without feeling gratitude.</p>

McDougall (<i>An Introduction to Social Psychology</i>, p. 114)
maintains that &ldquo;the act that is to inspire gratitude must make
us aware, not only of the kindly feeling, the tender emotion, of the
other towards us; it must also make us aware of his power, we must see
that he is able to do for us something that we cannot do for
ourselves.&rdquo; But surely we may feel grateful for a token of
goodwill without experiencing at all &ldquo;that negative self-feeling
which is evoked by the sense of the superior power of
another.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Retributive kindly emotion is of much less frequent occurrence in
the animal kingdom than the emotion of resentment. In a large number
of species not even the germ of it is found, and where it occurs it is
generally restricted within narrow limits. Anybody may provoke an
animal&rsquo;s anger, but only towards certain individuals is it apt
to feel retributive kindliness. The limits for this emotion are marked
off by the conditions under which altruistic sentiments tend to arise.
In its primitive form it is found among animals living in groups,
including the small group consisting of mother, or parents, and
offspring. The associated animals take pleasure in each other&rsquo;s
company, and with this pleasure is intimately connected kindliness
towards its cause, the companion himself, who is conceived of as a
friend. The altruistic sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page88"></a>88</span> would never have come into existence without
such a reciprocity of feeling.</p>

<p>Retributive kindly emotion has the tendency to retain a cause of
pleasure, just as resentment has the tendency to remove a cause of
pain. And as natural selection accounts for the origin of the
disposition to feel resentment, so also it accounts for the origin of
the disposition to feel retributive kindly emotion. Both of these
emotions are useful to the species: by resentment evils are averted,
by retributive kindliness benefits are secured. That there is such an
enormous difference in their prevalence is easily explained by the
simple facts that the living in groups is an advantage only to certain
species, and that even gregarious animals have many enemies but few
friends.</p>

<p>That moral approval&mdash;by which I understand that emotion of
which moral praise or reward is the outward manifestation&mdash;is a
kind of retributive kindly emotion, and as such allied to gratitude,
will probably be admitted without much hesitation. Its friendly
character is not, like the hostile character of moral disapproval,
disguised by any apparently contradictory facts. While the infliction
of suffering is generally <i>prima facie</i> revolting to our moral
consciousness, the very reverse is the case with the bestowal of a
benefit.</p>

<br />THE MORAL EMOTIONS<br />
<br />(<i>concluded</i>)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="noind"><span class="small">We have</span> seen that moral
disapproval is a form of resentment, and that moral approval is a form
of retributive kindly emotion. It still remains for us to examine in
what respects these emotions differ from kindred non-moral emotions,
disapproval from anger and revenge and approval from
gratitude&mdash;in other words, what characterizes them as
specifically <i>moral</i> emotions.<a id="Anchornotech4_1"
href="#Notech4_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech4_1" href="#Anchornotech4_1">1</a></span> Professor
McDougall (<i>An Introduction to Social Psychology</i> [London, 1926],
p. 124) makes the truly amazing statement that I have no criterion by
which to distinguish moral from non-moral resentment. I have expressly
devoted two whole chapters of my <i>Moral Ideas</i> (chs. iv. and v.)
to this very subject; and if he had taken any notice of them, he would
have found how closely his own views on the nature and origin of moral
indignation resemble mine.</p></div>

<p>It is a common opinion, held by moralists who regard the intellect
as the source of moral concepts, that moral emotions only arise after
and in consequence of an intellectual process through which the moral
quality of a certain course of conduct has been discerned. When I hear
of a murder, for instance, I must realize the wrongness of the act
before I can feel moral indignation at all; and if I delight in
contemplating a virtuous action, it is because I think the action to
be good, and not <i>vice versa</i>.<a id="Anchornotech4_2"
href="#Notech4_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> According to this
theory, then, the moral judgment <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page90"></a>90</span>is antecedent to, and determines the moral
emotion; and if it were correct, moral emotions could be simply
described as resentment or retributive kindly emotion called forth by
moral judgments. But in my opinion such a definition would be
absolutely meaningless. Whatever emotions may follow moral judgments,
such judgments could never have been pronounced unless there had been
moral emotions in somebody antecedent to them. The moral concepts,
which form their predicates, are ultimately generalizations of
tendencies to feel either moral approval or disapproval with reference
to that of which those concepts are predicated; and if a judgment
containing such a predicate evokes a moral emotion, it can only do so
because its predicate is based on a similar emotion. The criterion of
a moral emotion can therefore in no case depend upon its proceeding
from a moral judgment. But at the same time moral judgments, being
definite expressions of moral emotions, can help us to discover the
true nature of these emotions.</p>

<p>A moral judgment always has the character of disinterestedness.
When pronouncing an act good or bad, I mean that it is so quite
independently of any reference it might have to me personally. If a
person condemns an act which does him harm, how can he vindicate the
moral nature of his judgment? Only by pointing out that his
condemnation is not due to the particular circumstance that it is he
himself who is the sufferer, that his judgment would be the same if
anybody else in similar circumstances had been the victim, in other
words, that it is disinterested. Even the egoistic hedonist, who
regards acts as good or bad according as they give pleasure or pain to
the agent, recognizes disinterestedness as essential to a moral
judgment, in so far as he holds the judgment applicable to all similar
cases, whether he himself or some <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page91"></a>91</span>one else happens to be the agent. Now, if the
moral concepts are generalizations of tendencies to feel moral
emotions and at the same time contain the notion of disinterestedness,
we must conclude that the emotions from which they spring are felt
disinterestedly. And it does not affect the real character either of
the moral judgments or the moral emotions that he who pronounces such
a judgment is often in practice influenced by the intrusion of a
non-moral element into the emotion expressed in it. As Hume observed,
&ldquo;it seldom happens, that we do not think an enemy vicious, and
can distinguish betwixt his opposition to our interest and real
villainy or baseness.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_3"
href="#Notech4_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

Treatise of Human Nature</i>, iii. 1. 2 (Oxford, 1896, p.
472).</p></div>

<p>Of the disinterestedness of the moral emotions we find an
echo&mdash;more or less faithful&mdash;in the maxims of ethical
theorists as well as practical moralists. I have previously spoken of
Sidgwick&rsquo;s &ldquo;principle of justice,&rdquo; which merely
states the disinterestedness involved in the very concept of
&ldquo;right.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_4" href="#Notech4_4"><span
class="sp">4</span></a> The same notion is contained in Samuel
Clarke&rsquo;s &ldquo;rule of equity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whatever I judge
reasonable or unreasonable for another to do for me; that, by the same
judgment, I declare reasonable or unreasonable, that I in the like
case should do for him&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech4_5"
href="#Notech4_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> in Kant&rsquo;s
formula, &ldquo;Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same
time will that it should become a universal law&rdquo;;<a
id="Anchornotech4_6" href="#Notech4_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
in the biblical saying, &ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that men should do
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page92"></a>92</span>to you, do ye even
so to them&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech4_7" href="#Notech4_7"><span
class="sp">7</span></a> in Hobbes&rsquo; &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo;
expressed in &ldquo;this one sentence, approved by all the world, Do
not that to another, which thou thinkest unreasonable to be done by
another to thy selfe.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_8"
href="#Notech4_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> In the Indian
Mahabharata it is said:&mdash;&ldquo;Let no man do to another that
which would be repugnant to himself; this is the sum of righteousness;
the rest is according to inclination. In refusing, in bestowing, in
regard to pleasure and to pain, to what is agreeable and disagreeable,
a man obtains the proper rule by regarding the case as like his
own.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_9" href="#Notech4_9"><span
class="sp">9</span></a> When Confucius was asked if there is any rule
that may serve as a rule of practice for all one&rsquo;s life, he
answered, &ldquo;Is not reciprocity such a word? What you do not want
done to yourself, do not do to others&rdquo;; and in another utterance
he showed that the rule had for him not only a negative, but a
positive form as well.<a id="Anchornotech4_10"
href="#Notech4_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> The
disinterestedness of the moral emotions partly underlies the
utilitarian demand that, in regard to his own happiness and that of
others, an agent should be &ldquo;as strictly impartial as a
disinterested and benevolent spectator&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech4_11"
href="#Notech4_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and the biblical
rule, &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech4_12" href="#Notech4_12"><span
class="sp">12</span></a> But these maxims, as we shall see,<a
id="Anchornotech4_13" href="#Notech4_13"><span
class="sp">13</span></a> contain much more than the disinterestedness
of the concept of duty.</p>

<p>The disinterestedness by which moral approval and disapproval are
distinguished from other, non-moral, kinds <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page93"></a>93</span>of resentment or retributive kindly emotion
is really a form of a more comprehensive quality of the moral
emotions, namely, impartiality, real or apparent. If I pronounce an
act done to a friend or to an enemy good or bad, that implies that I
assume the act to be so independently of the fact that the person to
whom it is done is my friend or my enemy. Conversely, if I pronounce
an act done by a friend or by an enemy good or bad, that implies that
I assume it to be so independently of my friendly or hostile feelings
towards the agent. All this means that resentment and retributive
kindly emotion are moral emotions if they are assumed by those who
feel them to be uninfluenced by the particular relationship in which
they stand both to those who are immediately affected by the acts in
question and to those who perform the acts. A moral emotion, then, is
tested by an imaginary change of the relationship between him who
approves or disapproves of the mode of conduct by which the emotion
was evoked and the parties immediately concerned, while the
relationship between the parties themselves is left unaltered. At the
same time it is not necessary that the moral emotion should be really
impartial; it is sufficient that it is tacitly assumed to be so, or
even that it is not knowingly partial. In attributing different rights
to different individuals or classes of individuals, we are often in
reality influenced by the relationship in which we stand to them; and
yet those &ldquo;rights&rdquo; may be real, moral rights, not merely
preferences, namely, if we assume that any impartial judge would share
our views, or even if we are unaware of their partiality. Similarly,
when the savage censures a homicide committed upon a member of his own
tribe, but praises one committed upon a member of another tribe, his
censure and praise are certainly influenced by his relations<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page94"></a>94</span> to the parties in
question. He does not reason thus: it is blamable to kill a member of
one&rsquo;s own tribe and praiseworthy to kill a member of another
tribe, whether the tribe be my own tribe or not. Nevertheless his
blame and praise can hardly be denied to be expressions of moral
emotions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The analysis of the moral emotions that I have now attempted
applies not only to such emotions as we feel on account of the conduct
of others, but to such as we feel on account of our own conduct as
well, however much the latter may be blended with other emotions, as
being caused by our own behaviour. Remorse is a state of mind that
contains a hostile attitude towards oneself. It involves vaguely or
distinctly some desire to suffer. The remorseful man wants to think of
the wrong he has committed, he wants clearly to realize its
wickedness; and he wants to do this not merely because he desires to
become a better man, but because it gives him some relief to feel the
sting in his heart. We may feel actual hatred against ourselves, we
may desire to inflict bodily suffering on ourselves as a punishment
for what we have done; there are even instances of criminals guilty of
capital offences who have given themselves up to the authorities in
order to appease their consciences by suffering the penalty of the
law.<a id="Anchornotech4_14" href="#Notech4_14"><span
class="sp">14</span></a> Yet the desire to punish ourselves has a
natural antagonist in our aversion to pain, and this often blunts the
sting of the conscience. Self-approval, again, is not merely joy at
one&rsquo;s own conduct, but is a kindly emotion, a friendly attitude
towards oneself, which makes one feel that one&rsquo;s behaviour
merits praise or reward. We more often, however, hear of a &ldquo;good
conscience,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page95"></a>95</span>
which, as has been said above, generally means little more than the
absence of a bad one.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech4_14" href="#Anchornotech4_14">14</a></span> P. J. A. von
Feuerbach, <i>AktenmÃ¤ssige Darstellung merkwÃ¼rdiger Verbrechen</i>
(Giessen, 1828-29), i. 249; ii. 473, 479 <i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>As moral emotions, remorse and self-approval, must present the same
characteristics as make resentment and retributive kindliness moral
emotions when felt with reference to the conduct of other people:
disinterestedness and apparent impartiality. We may be angry with
ourselves from purely selfish motives: he who has lost at play may be
vexed with himself as well as he who has cheated at play, and the
egoist may reproach himself for having yielded to a momentary impulse
of benevolence. So also we may be pleased with ourselves on other than
moral grounds. Almost inseparable from the moral judgment that we pass
on our own conduct seems to be the image of an impartial outsider who
acts as our judge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now we once more are faced by the question of origin. We have seen
that the dispositions to feel resentment and retributive kindly
emotion are easily explained by their usefulness. This explanation
naturally also holds true of the moral emotions in so far as they are
retributive emotions: it accounts for the hostile attitude of moral
disapproval towards the cause of pain and for the friendly attitude of
moral approval towards the cause of pleasure. But it still remains for
us to discover the origin of those elements in the moral emotions by
which they are distinguished from other, non-moral, retributive
emotions. First, how shall we explain their disinterestedness?</p>

<p>We have to distinguish between different classes of conditions
under which disinterested retributive emotions arise. In the first
place, we may feel disinterested resentment, or disinterested
retributive kindly emotion, on account of an injury inflicted, or a
benefit conferred, upon another individual with whose pain, or
pleasure, we sympathize<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page96"></a>96</span> and in whose welfare we take a kindly
interest. Our retributive emotions are, of course, always reactions
against pain or pleasure felt by ourselves; this holds good of the
moral emotions as well as of anger, revenge, and gratitude. The
question to be answered, then, is, Why should we, quite
disinterestedly, feel pain calling forth disapproval because our
neighbour is hurt, and pleasure calling forth approval because he is
benefited?</p>

<p>That a certain act causes pleasure or pain to the bystander may be
due to the close association that exists between these feelings and
their outward expressions. The sight of a happy face tends to produce
some degree of pleasure in him who sees it; the sight of the bodily
signs of suffering tends to produce a feeling of pain. In either case
the feeling of the spectator is due to the fact that the perception of
the physical manifestations of the feeling produces the feeling itself
on account of the established association between them. Moreover,
sympathetic pain or pleasure may be the result of an association
between cause and effect, between the cognition of a certain act or
situation and the feeling generally evoked by this act or situation: a
blow may cause pain to the spectator before he has witnessed its
effect on the victim.</p>

<p>But the sympathetic feeling that results from association alone is
not what is popularly called sympathy: it lacks kindliness.<a
id="Anchornotech4_15" href="#Notech4_15"><span
class="sp">15</span></a> Arising merely from the habitual connection
of certain cognitions with certain feelings in the experience of the
spectator, it is, strictly speaking, not at all concerned with what
the other individual <i>feels</i>. On the other hand sympathy, in the
popular sense of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page97"></a>97</span>word, requires the co-operation of the
altruistic sentiment or affection, a disposition of mind that is
particularly apt to display itself as kindly emotion towards other
beings. This sentiment, only, induces us to take a kindly interest in
the feelings of our neighbours. It involves a tendency, or
willingness, and, when strongly developed, gives rise to an eager
desire, to sympathize with their pains and pleasures. Under its
influence our sympathetic feeling is no longer a mere matter of
association; we take an active part in its production, we direct our
attention to any circumstance which we believe may affect the feelings
of the person whom we love, and to any external manifestation of his
emotions. We are anxious to find out his joys and sorrows, to be able
to rejoice with him and to suffer with him, and, especially, when he
stands in need of it, to console or to help him. For the altruistic
sentiment is not merely willingness to sympathize, it is above all a
conative disposition to promote the welfare of its object. It is true
that sympathetic pain, unaided by kindliness, may induce a person to
relieve the suffering of his neighbour, instead of shutting his eyes
to it; but then he does so, not out of regard to the feelings of the
sufferer, but simply to get rid of a painful cognition. Nor must it be
supposed that the altruistic sentiment prompts to assistance only by
strengthening the sympathetic feeling. The sight of the wounded
traveller may perhaps have caused no less pain to the Pharisee than to
the good Samaritan; yet it would have been impossible for the latter
to dismiss his pain by going away, since he felt a desire to assist
the wounded man, and this desire would have been left ungratified if
he had not stopped by the wayside. To the egoist the relief offered a
sufferer is a means of suppressing the sympathetic pain, to the
altruist the sympathetic pain is, so to say, a means of giving relief.
The altruist <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98"></a>98</span>wants
to know, to feel the pain of his neighbour, because he desires to help
him. Why are the most kind-hearted people often the most cheerful, if
not because they think of alleviating the misery of their
fellow-creatures, instead of indulging in the sympathetic pain which
it evokes?</p>

<p>The co-operation of the altruistic sentiment with sympathy also
produces in us disinterested retributive emotions, when the individual
towards whom we are kindly disposed is hurt or benefited. In the
tendency to feel such emotions, however, there is a great difference
between resentment and retributive kindliness. Resentment towards an
enemy is itself, as a rule, a much stronger emotion than retributive
kindly emotion towards a benefactor. And as for the sympathetic forms
of these emotions, it is not surprising that the altruistic sentiment
is more readily moved by the sight of pain than by the sight of
pleasure, considering that it serves as a means of protection for the
species. Moreover, sympathetic retributive kindliness has powerful
rivals in the feelings of jealousy and envy, which tend to excite
anger also towards him who bestows the benefit on the other
individual. As an ancient writer observes, &ldquo;many suffer with
their friends when the friends are in distress, but are envious of
them when they prosper.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_16"
href="#Notech4_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> Among the lower
animals there seems to be no trace of retributive kindly emotion felt
as a result of pleasure taken in kindness shown to another individual.
On the other hand, there is sympathetic resentment in consequence of
an inflicted injury. A mammalian mother is as hostile to the enemy of
her young as to her own enemy. Social animals defend members of their
own group, which evidently involves some degree of sympathetic anger.
When a young monkey which had been <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page99"></a>99</span>seized by an eagle cried for assistance,
&ldquo;the other members of the troop, with much uproar, rushed to the
rescue, surrounded the eagle, and pulled out so many feathers, that he
no longer thought of his prey, but only how to escape.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech4_17" href="#Notech4_17"><span
class="sp">17</span></a> Speaking of a group of chimpanzees, Professor
KÃ¶hler says that if one of them is attacked before the eyes of the
others, great excitement goes through the whole group. Even the
lightest form of punishment, pulling the ear of the offender, or a
playful pretence at punishment, often stirred single members of the
group to much more decisive action. A little weak chimpanzee would run
up excitedly, stretch out his arm to the punisher, if the ape was
still being punished, try to hold the big man&rsquo;s arm tight, and
finally, with exasperated gestures, start hitting out at him.<a
id="Anchornotech4_18" href="#Notech4_18"><span
class="sp">18</span></a> Among domesticated animals and animals in
confinement sympathetic resentment may be felt even when the
individual who is hurt belongs to another species. The Rev. Charles
Williams mentions a dog at Liverpool who saved a cat from the hands of
some young ruffians: he rushed in among the boys, barked furiously at
them, terrified them into flight, and carried the cat off in his mouth
to his kennel, where he nursed it.<a id="Anchornotech4_19"
href="#Notech4_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> Darwin speaks of a
little American monkey in the Zoological Gardens of London which, when
seeing a great baboon attack his friend, the keeper, rushed to the
rescue and by screams and bites so distracted the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page100"></a>100</span>baboon, that the man was
able to escape.<a id="Anchornotech4_20" href="#Notech4_20"><span
class="sp">20</span></a> The dog who flies at any one who strikes, or
even touches, his master is a very familiar instance of sympathetic
resentment.</p>

<p>The scope of disinterested resentment naturally varies with the
scope of the altruistic sentiment. For reasons which I have stated
elsewhere, I think it likely that in mankind not only maternal but
also paternal and conjugal affection, in some degree, existed from the
very beginning, together with the family consisting of parents and
offspring, which is also found among anthropoid apes.<a
id="Anchornotech4_21" href="#Notech4_21"><span
class="sp">21</span></a> In its intrinsic nature, however, parental
love is not exactly what the term parental indicates. Herbert Spencer
pointed out that it is not adequately defined as the instinct which
attaches a creature to its young, as it is not exclusively displayed
in that relation: he identified it with the love of the helpless,
stimulated by the perception of &ldquo;smallness joined, usually, with
relative inactivity, being the chief indications of
incapacity.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_22" href="#Notech4_22"><span
class="sp">22</span></a> That maternal love is in some degree love of
the helpless is obvious from the fact that it originally only lasts as
long as the young are unable to shift for themselves. But
Spencer&rsquo;s theory fails to explain how it is that, even in a
gregarious species, mothers make a distinction between their own
offspring and other young. During my stay among the mountaineers of
Morocco I was often struck by the eagerness with which in the evening,
when the flock of ewes and the flock of lambs were reunited, each
mother sought for her own lamb and each lamb for its own mother; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101"></a>101</span>the same can be
testified by every shepherd. A similar discrimination has been noticed
even in cases of conscious adoption. Brehm tells us of a female baboon
which had so capacious a heart that she not only adopted young monkeys
of other species, but stole young dogs and cats which she continually
carried about; yet her kindness did not go so far as to share food
with her adopted offspring, although she divided everything quite
fairly with her own young ones.<a id="Anchornotech4_23"
href="#Notech4_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> To account for
maternal love we must therefore assume the existence of some other
stimulus besides the perception of the signs of helplessness, which
produces, or at least strengthens, the instinctive response in the
mother. This stimulus must be rooted in the external relationship in
which the offspring stand to the mother from the very beginning. She
is in close proximity to her helpless young from their tenderest age;
and she loves them because they are to her a cause of pleasure.<a

&ldquo;we shall approach closer to the facts if we substitute for this
abstract term &lsquo;pleasure&rsquo; the more concrete term
&lsquo;joy.&rsquo;&rdquo; But I maintain that though the mother, as he
says, feels joy and joy contains other elements besides pleasure, it
is the pleasure felt at her perception of the small and weak creature
in close proximity to herself that is the stimulus of her love, and
the emotion she feels towards them is tender.</p></div>

<p>The stimuli to which paternal love responds are apparently derived
from the same circumstances as those which call into activity maternal
love, the helplessness and proximity of the offspring; wherever it
exists the father is near his young from the beginning. And here
again, as in the case of maternal love, the instinctive response may
be assumed to be the result of a process of natural selection, which
has preserved a mental disposition necessary for the existence of the
species in which it is found. Professor<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page102"></a>102</span> McDougall asks how we can account for the
fact that men are at all capable of this emotion and of this
disinterested protective impulse; and his answer is that in its racial
origin the instinct was undoubtedly primarily maternal, but, like many
other characters, was transmitted to the other sex.<a
id="Anchornotech4_25" href="#Notech4_25"><span
class="sp">25</span></a> To me it seems that the origin of the
paternal instinct offers no more difficult problem to solve than that
of the maternal instinct. How could Professor McDougall&rsquo;s theory
account for the parental instinct of those species in which it is
found exclusively in the male, as is the rule among fishes that take
any care at all of their offspring, and among certain frogs?<a
id="Anchornotech4_26" href="#Notech4_26"><span
class="sp">26</span></a> The male of certain species of <i>Arius</i>
carries the ova about with him in his capacious pharynx. The male
<i>Amia calva</i> guards and leads its family of young for a
considerable time. The male stickleback builds a nest, in which he
induces a number of females to lay their eggs, defends the nest most
courageously against rival males, and guards not only the eggs but
also the young for some time after they are hatched; whereas the
female has no concern with her eggs after she has laid them. The male
nurse-frog (<i>Alytes obstetricans</i>) carries the eggs about with
him in a long string wound round his hind legs until the larvae
emerge, and defends this string against marauders; and in the Chilian
species of narrow-mouthed frogs (<i>Rhinoderma darwinii</i>) the male
not only carries the eggs in his gular sac but the young as well,
until their metamorphosis is complete. Among the birds there are a few
species in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103"></a>103</span>which
both the brooding and the care of the newly-hatched young devolve
exclusively on the male.<a id="Anchornotech4_27"

<p>We have no reason to believe that the family consisting of parents
and offspring was the only social unit among primitive men, though it
probably was, as among many existing savages of the lowest type,<a
id="Anchornotech4_28" href="#Notech4_28"><span
class="sp">28</span></a> the group of people who most permanently
lived together. It is more probable that they at least at times, when
the supply of food allowed it, lived in somewhat larger groups, or, in
other words, that they were in some degree gregarious; this is the
case with the gorilla and the chimpanzee, who have been found
sometimes in families and sometimes in small bands.<a
id="Anchornotech4_29" href="#Notech4_29"><span
class="sp">29</span></a> Subsequently, when man gradually found out
many new means of earning his living and thereby more and more
emancipated himself from direct dependence on surrounding nature, the
group grew in coherence and size. And thus mankind developed into the
most gregarious of all animal species.</p>

<p>Among a gregarious species of animals the members of a herd are at
ease in each other&rsquo;s company, suffer when they are separated,
rejoice when they are reunited. And, as has been pointed out before,
with the pleasure they take in each other&rsquo;s company is
intimately connected kindliness towards its cause, the companion
himself. Associated animals very frequently display affection for each
other&mdash;defend each other, help each other in distress and danger,
perform various other services for each other.<a id="Anchornotech4_30"
href="#Notech4_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> Among men the
members of the same social unit are tied <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page104"></a>104</span>to each other with various bonds of a
distinctly human character&mdash;the same customs, laws, institutions,
magic or religious ceremonies and beliefs, notions of a common
descent, and so forth. As men generally are fond of that to which they
are used or which is their own, they are also naturally apt to have
likings for other individuals whose habits, ideas, and feelings are
similar to theirs.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus all the various forms of the altruistic sentiment are
characterized by the same tendency to feel kindliness towards an
individual who is a cause of pleasure. There is no reason to regard
one form of it as derived from another. The difference between its
varieties lies in the difference between the individuals by the
perception of whom it is stimulated, but its impulse is in all cases
kindliness towards a cause of pleasure. In mankind there seems to be
an innate disposition to take some pleasure in the company of a
fellow-man, unless he for some special reason is a cause of fear or
dislike. It may be increased by certain particular stimuli, as is the
case in the parental, conjugal, and filial sentiments, and on the
other hand it is checked by circumstances that restrict the size of
the group.</p>

<p>Uncivilized peoples are as a rule described as kind towards members
of their own community or tribe. Within these limits they are
charitable and generous, and their customs relating to mutual aid are
often much more stringent than our own; and this applies even to the
very lowest among them.<a id="Anchornotech4_31"
href="#Notech4_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> The mutual
good-will, harmony, and sense of solidarity that under normal
conditions prevail in their societies lead to disinterested
resentment, which is generally felt when a member of the group is
hurt. Speaking of some Australian savages, Mr. Fison
remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;To the savage, the whole gens is the individual,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105"></a>105</span>and he is full of
regard for it. Strike the gens anywhere, and every member of it
considers himself struck, and the whole body corporate rises up in
arms against the striker.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_32"
href="#Notech4_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> Among certain
Queensland aborigines, says Dr. Roth, a man has to reckon not only
with the injured one or his relatives, but also, in some cases, with
the whole camp collectively, who will take upon itself to inflict
punishment upon the offender; while a woman who makes herself
obnoxious in the camp, especially to the female portion of it, is
liable to be set upon and &ldquo;hammered&rdquo; by her fellow-sisters
collectively.<a id="Anchornotech4_33" href="#Notech4_33"><span
class="sp">33</span></a> Much more frequently savage justice is
administered not by the whole of the community, but by some person or
persons invested with judicial authority, a council of elders or a
chief.<a id="Anchornotech4_34" href="#Notech4_34"><span
class="sp">34</span></a> But the resentment of the community also
displays itself in the widespread custom which enjoins private revenge
as a duty. The desire to see the offender suffer may induce the
community to assist the avenger in some way or other in attaining his
object,<a id="Anchornotech4_35" href="#Notech4_35"><span
class="sp">35</span></a> or actually to compel the injured party to
take revenge. Of an Australian tribe, where an offender was to receive
one or more spears from the injured man when he had recovered strength
or from his relatives if he was dead, we are told, &ldquo;Obedience to
such laws was never withheld, but would have been enforced, without
doubt, if necessary, by the assembled tribe.&rdquo;<a

<p>While disinterested resentment may thus be felt in consequence of
an injury inflicted upon another individual as <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page106"></a>106</span>a reaction against
sympathetic pain, it may also be directly produced by the cognition of
the signs of resentment. In the former case it is really independent
of the emotion of the injured individual; we may feel resentment on
his behalf though he himself feels none. In the latter case it is an
emotion reflected through the medium of its outward expression and
felt independently of the cause of the original emotion of which it is
a reflection, which may in fact be out of sight. Professor Holmes
tells us that &ldquo;among bees, ants, and termites signs of anger by
one individual may awaken the whole community to a high pitch of
excitement.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_37" href="#Notech4_37"><span
class="sp">37</span></a> So also a group of chimpanzees may be thrown
into a state of blind fury by the angry cries of one of its members,
&ldquo;even when the majority of its members have seen nothing of what
caused the first cry, and have no notion of what it is all
about.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_38" href="#Notech4_38"><span
class="sp">38</span></a> When the yells and shrieks of a street
dog-fight are heard, dogs from all sides rush to the spot, each dog
apparently ready to bite any of the others. So, too, in an infuriated
crowd of men one gets angry because the other is angry, and often the
question, Why? is hardly asked. This form of disinterested resentment
is of considerable importance both as an originator and a communicator
of moral ideas. Men are inclined to sympathize with the resentment of
persons for whom they feel regard; hence an act which, though harmless
by itself, is forbidden by God and man may be not only professed but
actually felt to be wrong. For a similar reason the punishment
inflicted by the society, which as a rule is an expression of its
moral indignation, may also, by arousing sympathetic resentment, lead
to the idea that the victim of it deserves to be punished. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page107"></a>107</span>Children, as everybody
knows, grow up with their ideas of right and wrong graduated, to a
great extent, according to the temper of the father or mother; and men
are not seldom, as Hobbes said, &ldquo;like little children, that have
no other rule of good and evill manners, but the correction they
receive from their Parents, and Masters.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech4_39" href="#Notech4_39"><span
class="sp">39</span></a> Any means of expressing resentment may serve
as a communicator of the emotion. Besides punishment, language
deserves special mention. Moral disapproval may be evoked by the very
sounds of words like &ldquo;murder,&rdquo; &ldquo;theft,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cowardice,&rdquo; and others, which not merely indicate a
certain mode of behaviour but also express the opprobrium attached to
it. By the use of some strong word the orator raises the indignation
of a sympathetic audience to its pitch.</p>

<p>There is yet a third way in which disinterested resentment may
arise. In many cases people feel hostile to a person who inflicts no
injury on anybody. There are in the human mind what Bain called
&ldquo;disinterested antipathies,&rdquo; or sentimental aversions
&ldquo;of which our fellow-beings are the subjects, and on account of
which we overlook our own interest quite as much as in displaying our
sympathies and affections.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_40"
href="#Notech4_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> Differences of
taste, habit, and opinion easily create similar dislikes; and these,
too, have played a prominent part in the moulding of the moral
consciousness. The antipathy which is so commonly felt against
anything unusual, new, or foreign, may lead to the idea that it is
wrong; and when a certain act, which does no harm&mdash;apart from the
painful impression it makes on the spectator&mdash;fills people with
disgust or horror, they may feel no less inclined to inflict harm upon
the agent than if he had committed an offence against person,
property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108"></a>108</span> or good
name. Such resentment may also arise from the observation of the
feelings of others. As Abraham Tucker said, &ldquo;we grow to love
things we perceive them fond of, and contract aversions from their
dislikes.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_41" href="#Notech4_41"><span
class="sp">41</span></a></p>

<p>We have already noticed that sympathy, in the popular sense of the
word, may produce not only disinterested resentment but disinterested
retributive kindliness: when taking a pleasure in the benefit bestowed
upon our neighbour, we are disposed to look with kindness upon the
benefactor. Moreover, as resentment may be produced by the cognition
of outward signs of resentment in others, so kindly emotion may be
produced by the signs of kindliness. Even a dog may be well-disposed
towards a stranger when he sees a friend&mdash;whether a man or
another dog&mdash;be friendly to him. Language communicates emotions
by terms of praise as well as by terms of condemnation; and a reward,
like a punishment, has some tendency to reproduce the emotion from
which it sprang. Finally, men have disinterested likings as they have
disinterested dislikes. As an instance of these may be mentioned the
common admiration of courage when felt irrespectively of the object
for which it is displayed&mdash;a feeling which has even elevated it
to an independent virtue, and in any case tends to influence the moral
verdict.</p>

<p>Having thus found the origin of disinterested retributive emotions,
we have also partly explained the origin of the moral emotions. But,
as we have seen, these emotions are not only disinterested, but
impartial in a wider sense, or at least, are not knowingly partial.
The possibility of such impartiality, however, is explained by the
answer to the more general question, how disinterestedness and
apparent impartiality have become characteristics of that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page109"></a>109</span>particular kind of
retributive emotions that we call moral emotions. The solution of this
problem is not difficult to find. It lies in the fact that society is
the birth-place of the moral consciousness; that the first moral
judgments expressed, not the private emotions of isolated individuals,
but emotions felt by the society at large; that tribal custom was the
earliest rule of duty.</p>

<p>Customs are not merely public habits&mdash;the habits of a certain
circle of men, a racial or national community, a rank or class of
society&mdash;but they are at the same time rules of conduct. As
Cicero observes, the customs of a people &ldquo;are precepts in
themselves.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_42" href="#Notech4_42"><span
class="sp">42</span></a> We say that &ldquo;custom commands,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;custom demands,&rdquo; and even when custom simply allows the
commission of a certain class of actions, it implicitly lays down the
rule that such actions are not to be interfered with. And the rule of
custom is conceived of as a moral rule, which decides what is right
and wrong.<a id="Anchornotech4_43" href="#Notech4_43"><span
class="sp">43</span></a> &ldquo;Les loix de la conscience,&rdquo; says
Montaigne, &ldquo;que nous disons naistre de nature, naissent de la
coustume.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_44" href="#Notech4_44"><span
class="sp">44</span></a> The Greek idea of the customary,
&#x3C4;&#x1F78; &#x3BD;&#x03CC;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;,
shows the close connection between morality and custom; and so do the
words &#x1F14;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;, &#x1F24;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,
and &#x1F20;&#x3B8;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x03AC;, the Latin <i>mos</i> and
<i>moralis</i>, the German <i>Sitte</i> and <i>Sittlichkeit</i>.<a
id="Anchornotech4_45" href="#Notech4_45"><span
class="sp">45</span></a> Moreover, in early society, customs are not
only moral rules, but the only moral rules ever thought of. The savage
strictly complies with the Hegelian command that no man must have a
private conscience.</p>

<p>What does it mean that custom is a rule of conduct? It implies that
every deviation from custom is apt to call forth public disapproval.
In the lower stages of civilization,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page110"></a>110</span> especially, custom is a tyrant who binds
man in iron fetters, and who threatens the transgressor not only with
general disgrace, but often with bodily suffering or even death. Now
if custom is a moral rule, the public disapproval aroused by its
transgression may be properly called a moral emotion. Moreover, where
all the duties of a man are expressed in the customs of the society to
which he belongs, it is obvious that the characteristics of moral
disapproval are to be sought for in its connection with custom. Custom
is fixed once for all, and admits of no purely personal preferences.
It is equally binding for me and for you and for all the other members
of the society. A breach of it is equally wrong whether I myself am
immediately concerned in the act or not; this involves
disinterestedness. So also the condemnation of it is independent of
the relationship in which the parties concerned in it stand to me
personally; this implies impartiality in a larger sense. And all this
holds true whatever be the origin of any particular custom. It may
have originated in selfishness or partiality: the leading men of the
society may at first have prohibited certain acts because they found
them disadvantageous to themselves, or to those with whom they
particularly sympathized. Where custom is an oppressor of women, this
oppression may, in some measure at least, be traced back to the
selfishness of the men. Where custom sanctions slavery, it is
certainly not impartial to the slaves. Yet in the one case as in the
other custom is assumed to be in the right, irrespectively of
one&rsquo;s own station, and the women and the slaves themselves are
expected to be of the same opinion. Such an expectation is by no means
a chimera. Under normal social conditions, largely owing to
men&rsquo;s tendency to share the resentment of their superiors, the
customs of a society are willingly submitted to and recognized as
right by the great majority <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page111"></a>111</span>of its members, whatever be their station.
Among the Rejangs of Sumatra, says Marsden, &ldquo;a man without
property, family, or connections, never, in the partiality of
self-love, considers his own life as being of equal value with that of
a man of substance.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech4_46"
href="#Notech4_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> Mr. Torday observes
that in Congo the position of woman, mere chattel and drudge as she
seems to be according to our notions, is nevertheless completely
consonant with her own conception of her rights&mdash;so much so that
it is precisely from the woman&rsquo;s side that the European reformer
is likely to meet with the most determined opposition. However
selfish, however partial a certain rule may be, it becomes a true
custom, a moral rule, as soon as the selfishness or partiality of its
makers is lost sight of.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that, by deriving the characteristics of
moral disapproval from its connection with custom, I implicitly
contradict my initial proposition that moral emotions are at the
bottom of all moral judgments. Custom is a moral rule only on account
of the disapproval called forth by its transgression. In its ethical
aspect it is nothing but a generalization of emotional tendencies,
applied to certain modes of conduct and transmitted from generation to
generation. In its capacity of a rule of duty custom, <i>mos</i>, is
derived from the emotion to which it gave its name.</p>

<p>And as public disapproval is the prototype of moral disapproval, so
public approval, expressed in public praise, is the prototype of moral
approval: it is characterized by the same disinterestedness and
apparent impartiality. But of these two emotions public disapproval,
being at the root of custom and leading to the infliction of
punishment, is by far the more impressive. Hence it is not surprising
that the term &ldquo;moral&rdquo; is etymologically connected with
<i>mos</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112"></a>112</span>which
always implies the existence of a social rule the transgression of
which evokes public disapproval. Only by analogy it has come to be
applied to the emotion of approval as well.</p>

<p>Though moral disapproval and approval have taken their place in the
system of human emotions as public emotions felt by the society at
large, they have not always remained inseparably connected with the
feelings of any special society. The unanimity of opinion that
originally characterized the members of the same social unit was
disturbed by its advancement in civilization. Individuals arose who
found fault with the moral ideas prevalent in the community to which
they belonged, criticizing them on the basis of their own individual
feelings. To deny such individuals the right of speaking in the name
of morality true and proper would be to attach to this term a meaning
which, in its narrowness, would be utterly different from the
established usage of it. All that is required is that their
retributive emotions should possess that disinterestedness and
apparent impartiality which have become moral characteristics in
connection with custom, but may differ from public disapproval and
approval either in strength or with regard to the facts by which they
are evoked. Indeed, the dissent from the orthodox views of morality
often arises from the conviction that the apparent impartiality of
public feelings is an illusion. In the course of progressive
civilization the moral consciousness has tended towards a greater
equalization of rights, towards an expansion of the circle within
which the same moral rules are held applicable. And this process has
been largely due to the example of influential individuals and their
efforts to raise public opinion to their own standard of right.</p>

<p>The fact that the earliest moral emotions were public <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page113"></a>113</span>emotions implies that
the original form of the moral consciousness cannot, as is often
asserted, have been the individual conscience. Martineau&rsquo;s
observation that the inner springs of other men&rsquo;s actions may be
read off only by inference from our own experience, by no means
warrants his conclusion that the moral consciousness is at its origin
engaged in self-estimation, instead of circuitously reaching this end
through a prior critique upon our fellow-men.<a id="Anchornotech4_47"
href="#Notech4_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> The moral elements
in the feelings we experience with reference to our own conduct are
generally mixed up with other elements to such an extent that they can
be disentangled only by a careful process of abstraction, and could
never have been distinguished as specific moral emotions unless the
notion of morality had been previously derived from another
source.</p>

<br />THE MORAL CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="noind"><span class="small">The</span> theory of the
emotional origin of moral judgments I am here advocating does not
imply that such a judgment affirms the existence of a moral emotion in
the mind of the person who utters it: he may do so without feeling any
emotion at all. No doubt, to say that a certain act is good or bad may
be the mere expression of an emotion felt with regard to it, just as
to say that the sun is hot or the weather cold may be a mere
expression of a sensation of heat or cold produced by the sun or the
weather. But such judgments express subjective facts in terms which
strictly speaking have a different meaning. To attribute a quality to
something is not the same as to state the existence of a particular
emotion or sensation in the mind that perceives it. This, however,
does not imply that the term used to denote the quality may not have a
subjective origin. I maintain, on the contrary, that the qualities
assigned to the subjects of moral judgments really are generalizations
derived from approval or disapproval felt with regard to certain modes
of conduct, that they are tendencies to feel one or the other of these
emotions interpreted as qualities, as dynamic tendencies, in the
phenomena which gave rise to the emotion. A similar translation of
emotional states into terms of qualities assigned to external
phenomena is found in many other cases: something is
&ldquo;fearful&rdquo; because people fear it, &ldquo;admirable&rdquo;
because people admire it. When we call an act good or bad, we do not
<i>state</i> the existence of any emotional tendencies, any <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page115"></a>115</span>more than, when we call
a landscape beautiful, we state any characteristics of beauty: we
refer the subject of the judgment to a class of phenomena which we are
used to call good or bad. But we are used to call them so because they
have evoked moral approval or disapproval in ourselves or in other
persons from whom we have learned the use of those words.</p>

<p>Most people follow a very simple method in judging of an act.
Particular modes of conduct have their traditional labels, many of
which are learned with language itself; and the moral judgment
commonly consists simply in labelling the act according to certain
obvious characteristics which it presents in common with others
belonging to the same group.<a id="Anchornotech5_1"
href="#Notech5_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> We hear that some one
has appropriated another&rsquo;s property, this is theft, it is wrong;
some one tells an untruth, this is lying, it is wrong; some one gives
money to a needy person, this is charitable, it is good; and so forth.
But when we examine the nature of these acts we find that they are apt
to give rise to or, as we may also put it, to become the objects of,
certain emotions, either of disapproval or approval, and it is the
tendency to feel one or the other of these emotions that has led
people to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116"></a>116</span>call
them bad or good. Those who first established the use of these and all
other moral concepts felt disapproval or approval and expressed in the
concepts their tendency to feel such an emotion in the given
circumstances. This is what may be called the intrinsic meaning of the
terms. I do not say that those who use them are aware of this meaning.
We are often unable to tell what is really implied in a concept that
we predicate to a certain phenomenon. When any one is asked what he
means by saying that something is or exists, or that something is the
cause of something else, I suppose that everybody who is not a
philosopher, and many a philosopher also, feels somewhat bewildered.
As Mr. Bertrand Russell observes, &ldquo;to say that a word has a
meaning is not to say that those who use the word correctly have ever
thought out what the meaning is: the use of the word comes first, and
the meaning is to be distilled out of it by observation and
analysis.&hellip; A word is used &lsquo;correctly&rsquo; when the
average hearer will be affected by it in the way intended.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_2" href="#Notech5_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
When we want to find out the intrinsic meaning of a term we have to
examine the circumstances in which it is used. And in analyzing the
predicates of moral judgments, we are guided by the fact that if we
ourselves emphatically and truly mean what we say when we pronounce
such a judgment, we recognize that we are apt, or at least think we
are apt, to feel a moral emotion of either approval or disapproval
with regard to that on which the judgment is pronounced.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech5_1" href="#Anchornotech5_1">1</a></span> I have copied
these two sentences from my <i>Moral Ideas</i> (i. 9). They show that
I was fully aware of the fact, subsequently stated by Professor
McDougall (<i>An Introduction to Social Psychology</i> [London, 1926],
p. 185 <i>sq.</i>), that &ldquo;the emotions on which a man&rsquo;s
moral judgments are based may be not his own emotions at the time of
passing judgment, and not even his own earlier emotions, but the
emotions, especially that disinterested emotion we call moral
indignation, of those who in bygone ages have played their parts in
the shaping of the moral tradition.&rdquo; His reference to my theory
of the emotional origin of moral judgments suggests that I had
overlooked the distinction between what he calls &ldquo;original moral
judgment and imitative moral judgments.&rdquo; As regards the latter,
he says, the intellectualist doctrine, according to which the act of
classing precedes and determines the moral emotion, is true; while
&ldquo;as regards original moral judgments, Westermarck is in the
right&mdash;they proceed directly from emotions.&rdquo;</p></div>

<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>Professor Sorley, who admits that &ldquo;feeling and
striving&rdquo; are anterior to moral ideas and moral judgment, argues
that once the transition to the moral judgment is made, &ldquo;we are
no longer concerned with subjective emotions<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page117"></a>117</span> but with the validity of the assertion
that this or that is good. Morality begins with judgments about good
and evil, right and wrong, and not simply with
emotions&mdash;retributive, parental, sympathetic, or what
not.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_3" href="#Notech5_3"><span
class="sp">3</span></a> How this transition from emotions to moral
judgments has taken place we are not told. In my opinion, as already
said, the tendency to feel moral approval or disapproval was
interpreted as a quality in the phenomenon that gave rise to it, and,
for reasons stated before, the concept expressing this quality was
supposed to give objective validity to the judgment in which it was
the predicate. If it were based on an emotion it could not do so;
hence the violent opposition to the theory of the emotional origin of
moral judgments. But I feel tempted to quote Hobbes&rsquo; sagacious
remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;In reasoning, a man must take heed of words;
which besides the signification of what we imagine of their nature,
have a signification also of the nature, disposition, and interest of
the speaker; such as are the names of vertues, and vices; for one man
calleth wisdome, what another calleth feare; and one cruelty, what
another justice; one prodigality, what another magnanimity; and one
gravity, what another stupidicy, &amp;c. And therefore such names can
never be true grounds of any ratiocination. No more can metaphors, and
tropes of speech: but these are less dangerous, because they profess
their inconstancy; which the other do not.&rdquo;<a

<p>In order to show that the concepts which are used as predicates in
moral judgments are ultimately based upon emotions it is necessary to
examine the relations between the concepts and the emotions. This is a
task which has been much neglected by the moralists of the emotional
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118"></a>118</span>school, although
it is evidently a matter of paramount importance. I shall restrict my
analysis to the principal terms used in English, all of which have
equivalents in other European languages. To what extent they have
equivalents in non-European tongues I do not take upon myself to
decide. That all existing peoples, even the lowest, have moral
emotions is as certain as that they have customs, and there can be no
doubt that they give expression to those emotions in their speech. But
it is another question how far their emotions have led to such
generalizations as are implied in moral concepts. Many savages have
terms more or less corresponding to our &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
&ldquo;bad,&rdquo; which, like our own terms, are used to express
moral, as well as other, qualities.<a id="Anchornotech5_5"
href="#Notech5_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> It seems very probable
that originally moral concepts were not clearly differentiated from
other more comprehensive generalizations, and that they assumed a more
definite shape only by slow degrees. At the same time we must not
expect to find the beginning of this process reflected in the
vocabularies of languages. There is every reason to believe that a
savage distinguishes between the &ldquo;badness&rdquo; of a man and
the &ldquo;badness&rdquo; of a piece of food, although he may have no
clear idea of the distinction. Language is a rough generalizer: even
more or less superficial resemblance between different phenomena often
suffices to establish linguistic identity between them. Compare the
rightness of a line with <span class="correction" title="amended from
'the the'">the</span> rightness of conduct, the wrongness of an
opinion with the wrongness of an act. And notice the different
significations given to the verb &ldquo;ought&rdquo; in the following
sentences:&mdash;&ldquo;They ought to be in town by this time, as the
train left Paris last night&rdquo;; &ldquo;If you wish to be healthy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119"></a>119</span>you ought to rise
early&rdquo;; &ldquo;You ought always to tell the truth.&rdquo; But
even the meaning of a term that is used in a moral sense may vary
considerably. In this respect it resembles the meaning of other words,
which, as Mr. Bertrand Russell puts it, &ldquo;is an area, like a
target: it may have a bull&rsquo;s eye, but the outlying parts of the
target are still more or less within the meaning, in a gradually
diminishing degree as we travel further from the bull&rsquo;s
eye.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_6" href="#Notech5_6"><span

<p>In ethical treatises there are two moral concepts that compete with
each other for supremacy: that of <i>ought</i> or <i>duty</i>, and
that of <i>goodness</i>. According to Kant, in fact, all morality
consists in the doing of duty for duty&rsquo;s sake, and what is good
is what ought to be done. Several later writers have accepted the
former of these propositions, but maintain that there are good actions
which surpass acts of duty in value, though they fall outside the
moral field because they are done for an end that is good and not for
the sake of their intrinsic rightness. Professor de Burgh, for
instance, who admits that acts done from spontaneous affection may be
of higher value than acts of duty for duty&rsquo;s sake, argues that
&ldquo;it is paradoxical to confuse the two types of action and
valuation by merging them, under the common rubric
&lsquo;moral,&rsquo; into one.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_7"
href="#Notech5_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> I think that to most
people who are not swayed by the Kantian terminology it would rather
seem paradoxical to deny the epithet &ldquo;moral&rdquo; to the
conduct of a man who from pity relieves a sufferer or a mother who
sacrifices health and pleasure for her child, on the ground that they
act <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120"></a>120</span>thus from love
without thought of moral obligation. Other writers reserve the field
of morality for duty alone because they look upon social regulation as
the origin of all morality. Bain says that &ldquo;positive good deeds
and self-sacrifice are the preserving salt of human life; but they
transcend the region of morality proper, and occupy a sphere of their
own.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_8" href="#Notech5_8"><span
class="sp">8</span></a> Durkheim argues that it would be
&ldquo;contraire Ã  toute mÃ©thode&rdquo; to include under the same
heading acts which are obligatory and acts which are objects of
admiration, and at the same time exempt from all regulation; &ldquo;si
donc, pour rester fidÃ¨le Ã  l&rsquo;usage, on rÃ©serve aux premiers la
qualification de moraux, on ne saurait la donner Ã©galement aux
seconds.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_9" href="#Notech5_9"><span
class="sp">9</span></a> But does not ordinary usage sanction goodness
as a moral quality as well as rightness or conformity to the rule of
duty, and what would the history of ethics be if all theories of
goodness were excluded from it?</p>

morale,&rdquo; in <i>Revue internationale de Sociologie</i>, xi.
[Paris, 1903], p. 466).</p></div>

<p>At the same time it seems to me obvious that the idea of duty,
being derived from custom, is prior to that of moral goodness. To say,
as Green does, that the idea of an absolute and a common good
&ldquo;must have been at work in the minds of men before they could be
capable of recognizing any kind of action as one that <i>ought</i> to
be done,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_10" href="#Notech5_10"><span
class="sp">10</span></a> is a philosophical construction for which
there is not a whit of evidence. Professor Moore even asserts that our
&ldquo;duty&rdquo; can only be defined &ldquo;as that action, which
will cause more good to exist in the Universe than any possible
alternative&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech5_11" href="#Notech5_11"><span
class="sp">11</span></a> but then he is guilty of a confusion
between<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121"></a>121</span> the
concept of duty and what he thinks that people ought to do. And when
he further maintains that, as we can never be sure that any action
will produce the greatest value possible, &ldquo;we never have any
reason to suppose that an action is our duty,&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_12" href="#Notech5_12"><span
class="sp">12</span></a> and that if a man has adopted a given course
of conduct after taking all possible care to assure himself that it is
the best, and it, owing to some subsequent event, which he could not
possibly have foreseen, turns out not to be the best, his action was
wrong<a id="Anchornotech5_13" href="#Notech5_13"><span
class="sp">13</span></a>&mdash;I think the aberrations of speculative
ethics from the ordinary use of terms may be said to have reached
their pitch; these statements make one think of the sin of unbelief
attributed to the poor pagans who could never have heard of the
Gospel. That any one ought to do the best he is able to do, is a
proposition often heard;<a id="Anchornotech5_14"
href="#Notech5_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> but even if it were
self-evident, as Professor Laird believes,<a id="Anchornotech5_15"
href="#Notech5_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> it could not affect
the concept of ought, because it would only tell us what we ought to
do, not what it means that we ought to do it. I venture, however, to
think that those who state or accept this proposition themselves have
actually two standards of duty, one by which they measure man and his
doings in the abstract, with reference to an ideal which they identify
with duty, and another by which they are guided in their practical
moral judgments upon their own and their neighbours&rsquo; conduct. It
seems to me that Professor Laird himself makes an admission in this
direction when he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;We are reluctant to admit that
<i>anyone</i> should be sacrificed deliberately in <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page122"></a>122</span>order that others may
gain, and when we are compelled to act in this fashion we do not care
to think of it. On the other hand we praise, with very occasional
reserve, anyone who sacrifices himself for such an end.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_16" href="#Notech5_16"><span
class="sp">16</span></a> The conscientious man is apt to judge himself
more severely than he judges others, and may be unwilling to admit
that he ever can do more than his duty, seeing how difficult it is
even to do all that he ought to do, and impressed, as he would be,
with the feeling of his own shortcomings; yet I do not see how he
could conscientiously deny that he has omitted to do many praiseworthy
or heroic deeds without holding himself blamable for such omissions.
My general conclusion, then, is that the concept of duty can no more
be derived from that of goodness than the concept of goodness from
that of duty. And the reason for their fundamental difference is that
the concept of duty springs from the emotion of moral disapproval and
that of goodness from the emotion of moral approval. Considering that
disapproval has in all ages played a far more important part in the
moral consciousness of mankind than approval, I am unable to subscribe
to the opinion that &ldquo;the conception of the Good is the central
point of ethics.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_17"

<p>The notion embodied in &ldquo;ought&rdquo; is frequently looked
upon as ultimate and unanalyzable. If this were the case we might, in
our study of the moral consciousness, be able to draw up lists of
duties, but we should be unable to understand or explain a single one
of them, nay, the fact that there is a moral law at all would be a
sheer mystery. Fortunately, however, we are not reduced to such
incompetence. Far from being a simple notion, &ldquo;ought&rdquo; is
clearly decomposable, even though it have a flavour of its <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page123"></a>123</span>own which is easier to
feel than to describe. First of all, it expresses a conation. When I
feel that I ought to do a thing, I experience an impulse to do it,
though some opposite impulse may finally determine my action; and when
I say to another man, &ldquo;You ought to do this or that,&rdquo;
there is certainly implied a professed wish to influence his action in
a given direction. In the notion of &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; the ethical
import of which is identical with that of &ldquo;ought,&rdquo; the
conative element is not so obvious. Closely connected with the
conative nature of &ldquo;ought&rdquo; is the imperative character it
is apt to assume; and both its conativeness and its imperativeness are
determined by the cognition that the mode of conduct which ought to be
performed or refrained from is not, or will possibly not be, performed
or refrained from. It is also this notion of its not being so that
determines the emotion which gives to &ldquo;ought&rdquo; the quality
of a moral predicate. The doing of what ought not to be done, or the
refraining from what ought not to be refrained from, is apt to call
forth moral disapproval; this is the most essential fact involved in
the notion of &ldquo;ought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every &ldquo;ought&rdquo;-judgment contains implicitly a
prohibition of that which ought not to be done. Nobody would ever have
dreamt of laying down a moral rule if the idea of its transgression
had not presented itself to his mind. We may reverse the words of the
Apostle<a id="Anchornotech5_18" href="#Notech5_18"><span
class="sp">18</span></a> and say that where no transgression is, there
is no law; the law-breaker is, in a way, the law-maker.<a
id="Anchornotech5_19" href="#Notech5_19"><span
class="sp">19</span></a> When Solon was asked why he had specified no
punishment for one who had murdered a father, he replied that he
supposed it could not occur to any man to commit such a crime.<a
id="Anchornotech5_20" href="#Notech5_20"><span
class="sp">20</span></a> Similarly,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page124"></a>124</span> the modern Shintoist concludes that the
primaeval Japanese were pure and holy from the fact that they are
represented as a people who had no moral commandments.<a
id="Anchornotech5_21" href="#Notech5_21"><span
class="sp">21</span></a> It is this prohibitive character of
&ldquo;ought&rdquo; that has imparted to duty that idea of antagonism
to inclination which has found its most famous expression in the
Kantian ethics, and which made Bentham look upon the word itself as
having in it &ldquo;something disagreeable and repulsive.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_22" href="#Notech5_22"><span
class="sp">22</span></a> It is this intrinsic connection between
&ldquo;ought&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; that has given to duty the
most prominent place in ethical speculation when moral pessimism has
been predominant. While the ancient Greeks, with whom happiness was
the state of nature, hardly spoke of duty,<a id="Anchornotech5_23"
href="#Notech5_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> but held virtue to
be the supreme good, Christianity, on the other hand, which looked
upon man as a being born and bred in sin, regarded morals
pre-eminently as a matter of duty. Then, again, in modern times,
Kant&rsquo;s categorical imperative came as a reaction against that
moral optimism which once more had given the preference to virtue,
considering everything in the world or in humanity as beautiful and
good from the very beginning.<a id="Anchornotech5_24"

<p>It is not, then, in the emotion of approval that we must seek for
the origin of the concepts of &ldquo;ought&rdquo; and
&ldquo;duty.&rdquo; At the same time we often applaud him who is
faithful to his duty in circumstances where the average man would have
felt a strong temptation to yield to a contrary impulse.<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page125"></a>125</span> It is to such cases
that we may trace that adoration of duty, or rather of its fulfilment,
which has been so common among moralists since the days of Kant, who
attributed moral worth only to dutiful acts that result from a
successful struggle against opposite inclinations.<a
id="Anchornotech5_25" href="#Notech5_25"><span
class="sp">25</span></a> They have a tendency to confine the words

of an act being disapproved of and the performance of it being

necessarily in every instance, disapproved of.<a id="Anchornotech5_27"
href="#Notech5_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> Strictly speaking,
however, &ldquo;ought&rdquo; and &ldquo;duty&rdquo; only express the

and say nothing about the consequences of its performance. &ldquo;When

word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; has made it possible to speak of
&ldquo;conflicting duties.&rdquo; Such an expression can only mean
that rules of conduct which generally ought to be followed may in
exceptional cases come into conflict with each other. This does not
justify Bradley&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;I neglect duty because of
duty&rdquo; (<i>Ethical Studies</i> [Oxford, 1927], p. 227); for it
can never be my duty at the same time to do a thing and not to do it

<p>The tendency in a phenomenon to arouse moral disapproval is
directly expressed by the term <i>bad</i>, and closely allied to it is
the term <i>wrong</i>. But there is some difference in the use of
these words. While &ldquo;bad&rdquo; may be applied both to a
person&rsquo;s character and to his conduct, only his conduct may be
said to be wrong. The reason for this is that the concept of moral
wrongness is modelled on the notion of a moral law, the breach of
which is regarded as &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;; and by laying down a moral
law we only enjoin a certain course of conduct, we do not command a
person to have a certain character. To say that an act or forbearance
is a duty is thus, so far as its morality is concerned, exactly the
same thing as to say that the opposite mode of conduct is wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrong&rdquo; is popularly regarded as the opposite of
<i>right</i>, and they really are contradictories, but only within the
sphere of positive moral valuation. We do not call the actions of
irresponsible beings, like animals and infants, &ldquo;right,&rdquo;
although they are not wrong. Nor do we pronounce morally indifferent
actions of responsible beings &ldquo;right,&rdquo; unless we wish
thereby especially to point out that they are not wrong; but it would
be more strictly accurate to say that people have &ldquo;<i>a</i>
right&rdquo; to do them. A right action, in the strict sense of the
word, is on a given occasion <i>the</i> right action, unless a choice
of alternatives is permitted by the rule of duty; right is what is in
conformity to duty. Those who recognize the existence of something
super-obligatory would not say that it is not right; they would say
that it is more than right, but not that it is more right.
&ldquo;Right&rdquo; has no comparative; a certain<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page127"></a>127</span> mode of conduct is
either in conformity to the rule of duty or not. There are degrees of
badness and of goodness, as the moral disapproval and the moral
approval may be stronger or weaker, but there are no degrees of
rightness.</p>

<p>The fact that the right mode of conduct is that which is in
conformity to duty and not infrequently requires self-restraint,
accounts for the erroneous opinion held by many ethical writers that
&ldquo;right&rdquo; is intrinsically connected with moral approval.
The choice of the right alternative, as I said in connection with the
concept of duty, may give us satisfaction and call forth in us an
emotion of approval, and the judgment in which we point out the
rightness of the act may actually contain applause. The manner in
which the judgment, &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; is pronounced often
shows that it is meant to be an expression of praise. But this does
not imply that the concept &ldquo;right&rdquo; by itself has reference
to moral approval and involves praise. It only means that in one word
is expressed a certain concept&mdash;that of conformity to
duty&mdash;<i>plus</i> an emotion of approval. That
&ldquo;right&rdquo; <i>per se</i> involves no praise is obvious from
the fact that we regard it as perfectly right to pay a debt and to
keep a promise, or to refrain from killing, robbing, or lying, though
these acts or forbearances have no tendency whatever to evoke in us an
emotion of moral approval.</p>

<p>The concept of &ldquo;right,&rdquo; then, as implying that the
opposite mode of conduct would have been wrong, ultimately derives its
moral significance from moral disapproval. This may seem strange
considering that &ldquo;right&rdquo; is commonly looked upon as
positive and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; as its negation. But we must remember
that language and popular conceptions in these matters start from the
notion of a moral rule or command. It is held to be of paramount
importance that such modes of conduct as are apt to arouse <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page128"></a>128</span>general moral
disapproval should be avoided. People try to prevent them by
prohibitions and injunctions, often emphasized by threats of penalties
for the transgressors. The whole moral and social discipline is based
upon commands; customs are rules of conduct, and so are laws. It is
natural, then, that the notion of a command should figure uppermost in
popular conceptions of morality. Obedience to the command is right,
the breach of it is wrong. But the fact that gave birth to the command
itself was the disapproval called forth by the act which the command
forbids or by the omission of that which it enjoins.</p>

<p>I have now spoken of &ldquo;right&rdquo; as an adjective. Used as a
substantive, to denote a <i>right</i>, it also, in whatever sense it
be applied, expresses a concept that is rooted in the emotion of moral
disapproval. To have a right to do a thing is to be allowed to do it,
either by positive law, in the case of a legal right, or by the moral
law, in the case of a moral right; in other words, to have a moral
right to do a thing implies that it is not wrong to do it. But
generally the concept of &ldquo;a right&rdquo; means something more
than this. From the fact that an act is allowable, that it is not
wrong, it follows, as a rule, that it ought not to be prevented; and
this character of inviolability is largely included in the very
concepts of rights. That a man has a right to live does not merely
mean that he commits no wrong by supporting his life, but it chiefly
means that it would be wrong of other people to prevent him from
living, that it is their duty to refrain from killing him, or even, as
the case may be, that it is their duty to help him to live. And in
order to constitute a right in him, the duty in question must be a
duty <i>to him</i>, that is, a duty to be performed for his own sake.
To kill another person&rsquo;s slave may be condemned as an injury
done to the slave himself, in which case it is a duty to the slave not
to kill him; but it <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page129"></a>129</span>may also be condemned on account of the
loss it inflicts upon the master, and in this case it is deemed a duty
to the master not to kill his slave. In the latter case we can hardly
say that the duty of refraining from killing the slave constitutes a
right to life in the slave: it only constitutes a right in the master
to retain his slave alive and not to be deprived of him by an act
causing his death.</p>

<p>So commonly does the conception of a right belonging to a person
contain the idea of a duty which other persons owe him, that it seems
necessary to point out the existence of rights in which no such idea
is involved. A man&rsquo;s right to defend his country, for instance,
does not intrinsically imply that it is wrong of the enemy to disable
him from doing so. But on the other hand there are rights which are
nothing else than duties towards those who have the rights. A right is
not always a person&rsquo;s right to do, or to refrain from doing,
something; it may have exclusive reference to other people&rsquo;s
conduct. That a father has a right to be obeyed by his children only
means that it is a duty incumbent on them to obey him. That a person
has the right to bodily integrity only means that it is wrong to
inflict on him a bodily injury. These rights may, no doubt, if
violated, give rise to certain rights of activity: the father may have
a right to exact from his children the obedience they owe him, the
person who is attacked may have a right to defend himself. But in such
cases the right of exacting obedience or of resisting wrong is
certainly not identical with the right of being obeyed or of not being
wronged.</p>

<p>It is commonly said that rights have their corresponding duties.
But if this expression is to be used, it must be remembered that the
duty which &ldquo;corresponds&rdquo; to a right is, as a matter of
fact, either included in that right or simply identical with it. The
identity between the right <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page130"></a>130</span>and the duty, then, consists in this, that
the notion of a right belonging to a person is identical with the
notion of a duty towards him. Rights and duties are not identical in
the sense that it is always a duty to insist on a right, though this
has been urged. If anybody prevents me from making use of my right, it
may no doubt be deemed a duty on my part not to tolerate the wrong
committed against me, but nothing of the kind is involved in the
concept of a right. And the same may be said with reference to the
assertion that a right to do a thing is always, at the same time, a
duty to do it&mdash;an assertion which is a consequence of the
doctrine that there is nothing morally indifferent and nothing that
goes beyond duty; in other words, that all conduct of responsible
beings is either wrong or obligatory. Even if this doctrine were
accepted by our common moral experience&mdash;which it certainly is
not&mdash;even if there were a constant coincidence between the acts
which a person has a right to perform and such as it is his duty to
perform, that would not constitute identity between the concepts of
&ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;duty.&rdquo; According to the meaning
of a right, A&rsquo;s right may be B&rsquo;s duty towards A; but
A&rsquo;s right cannot mean A&rsquo;s duty towards B or anybody
else.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the notions of wrongness and rightness are
the notions of <i>injustice</i> and <i>justice</i>. Injustice is a
kind of wrongness. To be unjust is always to be unjust to somebody, a
violation of some one&rsquo;s right. Justice is a kind of rightness.
It involves the notion that a duty to somebody, a duty corresponding
to a right in him, is fulfilled;<a id="Anchornotech5_29"
href="#Notech5_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> we may say that
justice &ldquo;demands&rdquo; that it should be fulfilled. As an act
is &ldquo;right&rdquo; if its omission is wrong, so an act is
&ldquo;just&rdquo; in the strict sense of the word, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page131"></a>131</span>if its omission is
unjust. But like the adjective &ldquo;right,&rdquo; the adjective
&ldquo;just&rdquo; is also sometimes used in a wider sense, to denote
that something is &ldquo;not unjust.&rdquo; As non-obligatory acts
that are not wrong can hardly be denied to be right, so non-obligatory
acts that are not unjust can hardly be denied to be just, although
they are not demanded by justice.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech5_29" href="#Anchornotech5_29">29</a></span> According to
the <span class="correction" title="amended from
'Instutiones'"><i>Institutiones</i></span> of Justinian (i. 1. 1),
&ldquo;justice is the constant and perpetual will to render to each
one his right.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>At the same time &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; and &ldquo;justice&rdquo;
are not simply other names for violating or respecting rights.
Whenever we style an act unjust, we emphasize that it involves
partiality. We do not generally call murder and robbery unjust but
wrong or criminal, because the partiality involved in their commission
is quite obscured by their glaring wrongness or criminality; but we at
once admit their gross injustice when we consider that the murderer
and robber indulged their own inclinations with utter disregard of
their neighbours&rsquo; rights. On the other hand, we look upon
&ldquo;unjust&rdquo; as an exceedingly appropriate term for a judge
who condemns an innocent man with the intention to save the culprit;
and we say it is just or, more emphatically, that justice demands that
the innocent should not suffer in the place of the guilty. When we
style an act &ldquo;just,&rdquo; in the strict sense of the term, we
point out that an undue preference would have been shown some one by
its omission. It is true, as Adam Smith observes, that &ldquo;we may
often fulfil all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing
nothing,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_30" href="#Notech5_30"><span
class="sp">30</span></a> and that the man who barely refrains from
violating the person or estate or reputation of his neighbours so far
does justice to them; but in such cases we hardly apply the epithet
&ldquo;just,&rdquo; simply because there is no reason to emphasize the
partiality of those who act in the contrary manner.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech5_30" href="#Anchornotech5_30">30</a></span> Adam Smith,
<i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> (London, 1887), p.
117.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page132"></a>132</span>It is the
emphasis laid on the duty of impartiality that gives justice a special
prominence in connection with punishments and rewards. A man&rsquo;s
rights depend to a great extent upon his actions. Other things being
equal, the criminal has not the same rights to inviolability as
regards reputation, freedom, property, or life as the innocent man;
the miser and egoist have not the same rights as the benefactor and
the philanthropist. On these differences in rights due to differences
in conduct the terms &ldquo;just&rdquo; and &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; lay
stress; for in such cases an injustice would have been committed if
the rights had been equal. When we say of a criminal that he has been
&ldquo;justly&rdquo; imprisoned, we point out that he was no victim to
undue partiality, as he had forfeited the general right to freedom on
account of his crime. When we say of a benefactor that he has been
&ldquo;justly&rdquo; rewarded, we point out that no favour was
partially bestowed upon him in preference to others, as he had
acquired the special right of being rewarded. But the
&ldquo;justice&rdquo; of a punishment or a reward, strictly speaking,
involves something more than this; as we have seen, what is strictly
just is always the discharge of a duty corresponding to a right that
would have been in a partial manner disregarded by a transgression of
the duty. If it is just that a person should be rewarded he ought to
be rewarded, and to fulfil this duty is to do him justice. Again, if
it is just that a person should be punished he ought to be punished,
and his not being punished is an injustice to other persons. It is an
injustice towards all those whose condemnation of the wrong act finds
its recognized expression in the punishment, inasmuch as their
rightful claim that the criminal should be punished, their right of
resisting wrong, is thereby violated in favour of the wrong-doer.
Moreover, his not being punished is an injustice towards other
criminals, who <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page133"></a>133</span>have been, or who will be, punished for
similar acts, in so far as they have a right to demand that no undue
preference should be shown to anybody whose guilt is equal to theirs.
Retributive punishment may admit of a certain latitude as to the
retribution. It may be a matter of small concern from the
community&rsquo;s point of view whether men are fined or imprisoned
for the commission of a certain crime. But justice demands that in
equal circumstances all of them should be punished with the same
severity, since the crime has equally affected their rights.</p>

<p>The emphasis which &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; lays on the partiality
of a certain mode of conduct always involves a condemnation of that
partiality. Like every other kind of wrongness,
&ldquo;injustice&rdquo; is thus a concept that is obviously based on
the emotion of moral disapproval. And so is the concept of
&ldquo;justice,&rdquo; whether it involves the notion that an
injustice would be committed if a certain duty is not fulfilled, or is
simply used to denote that a certain course of conduct is &ldquo;not
unjust.&rdquo; But there is yet another sense in which the word
&ldquo;just&rdquo; is applied. It may emphasize the impartiality of an
act in a tone of praise. Considering how difficult it may be to be
perfectly impartial and give every man his due, especially when
one&rsquo;s own interests are concerned, it is only natural that men
may be applauded for being just, and, consequently, that to call a
person &ldquo;just&rdquo; may be to praise him. So, also,
&ldquo;justice&rdquo; is used as the name for a virtue, &ldquo;the
mistress and queen of all virtues.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_31"
href="#Notech5_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> But all this does
not imply that an emotion of moral approval enters into the
<i>concept</i> of &ldquo;justice.&rdquo; It only means that one word
is used to express a certain concept&mdash;a concept which, as we have
seen, ultimately derives its import from moral disapproval&mdash;and
in addition an emotion of approval. That the concept of
&ldquo;justice&rdquo; by <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page134"></a>134</span>itself has no reference to the emotion of
approval appears from the fact that it is no praise to say of an act
that it is &ldquo;only just.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech5_31" href="#Anchornotech5_31">31</a></span> Cicero, <i>De
officiis</i>, iii. 6.</p></div>

<p>From the concepts springing from moral disapproval we shall pass to
those springing from moral approval. Foremost among these ranks the
concept <i>good</i>.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;good&rdquo; is applied to a great variety of
objects.<a id="Anchornotech5_32" href="#Notech5_32"><span
class="sp">32</span></a> The use made of it is in fact so extensive
that it has been supposed to be essentially a collection of homonyms,
such that the set of things to which it is applied&mdash;roughly,
those in connection with which we heard it pronounced in early years,
like a good bed, a good kick, a good baby, a good God&mdash;have no
common characteristic at all.<a id="Anchornotech5_33"
href="#Notech5_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> Most frequently the
concept of goodness has been considered closely related to desire,
pleasure, or satisfaction. According to Hobbes, a man calls
&ldquo;good&rdquo; whatever is the object of his appetite or desire,
and &ldquo;evil&rdquo; the object of his hate or aversion.<a
id="Anchornotech5_34" href="#Notech5_34"><span
class="sp">34</span></a> Spinoza said that &ldquo;we deem a thing to
be good because we strive for it, wish for it, long for it, or desire
it&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech5_35" href="#Notech5_35"><span
class="sp">35</span></a> but also, that we call a thing
&ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil&rdquo; in so far as we perceive that
it affects us with pleasure or pain.<a id="Anchornotech5_36"
href="#Notech5_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> Locke<a
id="Anchornotech5_37" href="#Notech5_37"><span
class="sp">37</span></a> and Hume<a id="Anchornotech5_38"
href="#Notech5_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> looked upon aptness
to produce pleasure as the criterion of goodness. According to
Bradley, &ldquo;we may speak of the good, generally, as that which
satisfies desire. It is that which we approve of, and in which we can
rest with a feeling of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page135"></a>135</span>contentment. Or we may describe it again,
if we please, as being the same as worth.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_39" href="#Notech5_39"><span
class="sp">39</span></a> But whatever all other good things may have
in common, &ldquo;goodness,&rdquo; in the emphatically moral sense of
the word&mdash;and with this alone I am here concerned&mdash;has a
characteristic of its own, which makes it widely different from any
other &ldquo;good&rdquo;:<a id="Anchornotech5_40"
href="#Notech5_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> it is a concept
rooted in the tendency to feel the emotion of moral approval, which
implies a kindly feeling towards another individual as a cause of
pleasure. This was clearly perceived by Hutcheson when he wrote that
moral goodness &ldquo;denotes our idea of some quality apprehended in
actions, which procures approbation, attended with desire of the
agent&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_41"
href="#Notech5_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> It is a serious
defect of modern theories of value that they so frequently fail to
distinguish properly between moral and other values.</p>

attribute everything which we should call &ldquo;good&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; to the activity of volitional or supposed volitional
beings, and, generally speaking, I can see no reason whatever for
believing that the terms which are used both in a moral and in a
non-moral sense were originally expressions for moral qualities only.

<p>&ldquo;Good&rdquo; conduct has often been identified with
&ldquo;right&rdquo; conduct, but this identification is not borne out
by the actual use of these terms, which should be our only criterion
in fixing their meaning.<a id="Anchornotech5_42"
href="#Notech5_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> A father does right
in supporting his children, inasmuch as he, by doing so,
discharges<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136"></a>136</span> a duty
incumbent on him, but we do not say that he does a good deed by
supporting them, or that it is good of him to do so. Nor do we call it
good of a man to refrain from killing or robbing his neighbour,
although his conduct is so far right. In these cases
&ldquo;good&rdquo; has an emphatically moral meaning. If the question
were put whether it is not always good that a person does his duty,
nobody would of course deny that it is good. But then this predicate
is used in a wider sense, not as a term of praise derived from the
emotion of moral approval: we do not express any tendency to
experience a kindly feeling towards a man because he refrains from
killing another. The antithesis between &ldquo;right&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; is, in a certain sense at least, contradictory,
the antithesis between &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is
only contrary. Every act&mdash;provided that it falls within the
sphere of positive moral valuation&mdash;that is not wrong is right,
but every act that is not bad is not necessarily good. Just as we may
say of a thing that it is &ldquo;not bad&rdquo; and yet refuse to call
it &ldquo;good,&rdquo; so we may object to praising the discharge of a
duty as &ldquo;good,&rdquo; although the opposite course of conduct
would be bad. But at the same time we may also very well praise a man
for an act the omission of which would have incurred blame. To say of
one and the same act that it is &ldquo;right&rdquo; and that it is
&ldquo;good,&rdquo; in the strict moral sense, really means that we
judge of it from different points of view. Since moral praise
expresses a kindly attitude of mind, it is commendable for a man not
to be too niggard in his acknowledgment of other people&rsquo;s right
conduct; whereas, self-praise being objectionable, only the other
point of view is deemed proper when he passes a judgment on himself.
He may say, without incurring censure, &ldquo;I have done my duty, I
have done what is right,&rdquo; but it would sound too self-complacent
to say, &ldquo;I have done a good deed,&rdquo; and <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page137"></a>137</span>be actually obnoxious to
say, &ldquo;I am a good man.&rdquo; The best man even refuses to be
called good by others:&mdash;&ldquo;Why callest thou me good? there is

&ldquo;good&rdquo; conduct and &ldquo;right&rdquo; conduct do not mean
the same thing, which I pointed out in my <i>Moral Ideas</i>, has been
recently emphasized by Dr. Ross (<i>op. cit.</i>, <i>passim</i>),
although he could not of course, from his objectivistic point of view,

<p>While &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; is the general expression for moral
praise, the word virtue is generally used to denote a disposition of
mind that is characterized by some special kind of goodness. He who is
habitually temperate possesses the virtue of temperance, he who is
habitually brave the virtue of courage, he who is habitually generous
the virtue of generosity. Even when a man is simply said to be
&ldquo;virtuous,&rdquo; this epithet is given him, more or less
distinctly, with reference to some kind or kinds of goodness
attributed to him: it may mean that he has many virtues, or that he
has much of one. A Supreme Being who is regarded as all-good is not
called virtuous.</p>

<p>Virtue has been said essentially to express effort, resistance, and
conquest. According to Kant it is &ldquo;the moral disposition in
struggle&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech5_44" href="#Notech5_44"><span
class="sp">44</span></a> according to others it is the harmony won,
while merit is the winning of it.<a id="Anchornotech5_45"
href="#Notech5_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> But I do not see
that the general concept of virtue presupposes struggle. A virtue,
consisting in the disposition to will or not to will a certain kind of
conduct, is not even reduced by the fact that no rival impulses make
themselves felt. It is true that by struggle and conquest a man may
display more virtue, namely, the virtue of self-restraint in addition
to the virtue gained by it. The vigorous and successful contest
against temptation constitutes a virtue by itself. For instance, the
quality of mind that is exhibited in a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page138"></a>138</span>habitual and victorious effort to subdue
strong sexual passions is a virtue distinguishable from that of
chastity, and the latter is not made greater thereby; he who exercises
more self-restraint in resisting seductive impulses may have more
merit, but merit is not necessarily proportionate to virtue. The
virtues are broad generalizations of mental dispositions that on the
whole are regarded as laudable. Owing to their stereotyped character
it easily happens in individual cases that the possession of a virtue
confers no merit upon the possessor. A man&rsquo;s virtues are no
exact gauge of his general moral worth. In order to form a just
opinion of the value of a person&rsquo;s character we must take into
account the strength of his instinctive desires and the motives of his
conduct; and there are virtues that pay no regard to either. A sober
man who has no taste for intoxicants possesses the virtue of sobriety
in no less degree than a man whose sobriety is the result of
overcoming a strong desire. He who is brave with a view to being
applauded is not inferior in courage to him who faces danger merely
from a feeling of duty. The only thing that the possession of a virtue
presupposes is that it should have been tried and tested. We cannot
say that people unacquainted with intoxicants have the virtue of
sobriety, and that a man who never had anything to spend distinguishes
himself for frugality. To attribute a virtue to somebody is always to
bestow upon him some degree of praise, and it is not praise, only
irony, to say of a man that he &ldquo;makes a virtue of
necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There has been much discussion about the relation between virtue
and duty, and it has been regarded as very complicated. We do not call
it a virtue if a man habitually refrains from killing or robbing, or
pays his debts, or performs a great number of other duties. We do call
temperance and justice virtues, although we regard it as <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page139"></a>139</span>obligatory on a man to
be temperate and just. We also call hospitality and charity virtues in
cases where their exercise goes beyond the strict limits of duty. It
is no wonder that those who consider the notion of duty incapable of
being analyzed, or who fail to recognize its true import, are
embarrassed by facts like these. But if my analysis of duty and virtue
is correct, the relation between them is simple enough. That something
is a duty implies that the opposite mode of conduct tends to evoke
moral disapproval, that it is a virtue implies that the disposition to
practise it tends to evoke moral approval. If the virtues actually
cover a comparatively large field of the province of duty, that is due
to their being dispositions of mind. We may praise the habits of
justice and gratitude, even though we find nothing praiseworthy in an
isolated just or grateful act.</p>

<p>There has been no less confusion with regard to the relation
between duty and <i>merit</i>. Like the notions of goodness and
virtue, the &ldquo;meritorious&rdquo; derives its origin from the
emotion of moral approval; but while the former merely express a
tendency to give rise to such an emotion, the
&ldquo;meritorious&rdquo; implies that the object to which it refers
merits praise, that it has a just claim to praise, in other words,
that it ought to be recognized as good. This makes the term
&ldquo;meritorious&rdquo; more emphatic than the term
&ldquo;good,&rdquo; but at the same time it narrows its province in a
peculiar way. Just as the expression that something ought to be done
implies the idea that it possibly may not be done, so the statement
that something is meritorious, in pointing out its goodness, implies
the idea that this goodness may fail to receive due recognition. It
would be blasphemous to call the acts of a God who is conceived to be
infinitely good &ldquo;meritorious,&rdquo; since it would suggest a
thinkable limitation of his goodness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page140"></a>140</span>The emphatic
claim to praiseworthiness made by the &ldquo;meritorious&rdquo; has
led to its identification with the <i>superobligatory</i>. But from
what has been said above it is manifest that they are not identical.
As the discharge of a duty may be praised as a good deed, so it may
also be regarded as an act that ought to be recognized as good.
Practically, no doubt, there is a certain antagonism between duty and
merit. We praise, and especially we regard as deserving praise, only
what is above the average,<a id="Anchornotech5_46"
href="#Notech5_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> and we censure what
is below it. But although thus most acts that are deemed meritorious
fall outside the ordinary limits of duty as roughly drawn by the
popular mind, we are on the other hand often disposed to attribute
merit to a man on account of an act which from a strict point of view
is his duty, but a duty that most people in the same circumstances
would have left undischarged. This shows that the antagonism between
duty and merit is not absolute. And in the concept of merit <i>per
se</i> no such antagonism is involved.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech5_46" href="#Anchornotech5_46">46</a></span> Merit, as
Professor S. Alexander (<i>Moral Order and Progress</i> [London,
1896], p. 196) says, &ldquo;expresses the interval which separates the
meritorious from the average.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>But while &ldquo;meritorious&rdquo; is not identical with
&ldquo;superobligatory,&rdquo; it is obvious that if a course of
conduct which is not regarded as a duty is held to be meritorious, it
is <i>eo ipso</i> admitted that a man can do more than his duty. This
is denied both by those who derive goodness from duty and consider
that what is good is what ought to be done, and by those who derive
duty from goodness and consider that everybody ought to do the best he
is able to do. Duty, which is the minimum of morality in so far as it
implies that the opposite mode of conduct is wrong, is identified with
the supreme moral ideal, which requires the best possible conduct for
its realization. As I have <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page141"></a>141</span>said above, this rigorism is not supported
by our practical moral judgments. It is a mere theory, which may be
traced either to the direct or indirect influence of Protestant
theology with its denial of all works of supererogation, or to the
endeavours of normative moralists to preach the most elevated kind of
morality they can conceive. For my own part I do not see how such a
doctrine could serve any useful purpose at all. The recognition of a
&ldquo;superobligatory&rdquo; does not lower the moral ideal, on the
contrary it tends to raise it; and at the same time it makes it more
possible to vindicate the moral law and administer it more strictly.
It is nowadays a recognized principle in legislation that a law loses
much of its weight if it cannot be enforced. If the realization of the
highest moral ideal is commanded by a moral law, such a law will
always remain a dead letter, and morality will gain nothing. It seems
to me that far above the anxious effort to fulfil the commandments of
duty stands the free and lofty aspiration to live up to an ideal,
which, unattainable as it may be, threatens neither with blame nor
remorse him who fails to reach its summits. Does not experience show
that those whose minds are constantly prepossessed with thoughts of
duty are apt to become inhuman, intolerant, indeed intolerable?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the earlier part of the book I have tried to show that there are
no moral truths in the ordinary sense of the word, which attributes
objective validity to moral judgments. But if I am right in my
assertion that the moral concepts intrinsically express a tendency to
feel a moral emotion of either approval or disapproval, it is obvious
that a judgment which contains such a concept may be said to be true
if the person who pronounces it actually has a tendency to feel the
emotion in question with reference<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page142"></a>142</span> to the subject of the judgment. Professor
Sorley argues against me that if a value-judgment lacked that validity
it assumes, the proposition &ldquo;this is good&rdquo; could never be
either true or false; &ldquo;it would only express some peculiar state
of mind of the person making the assertion and would have no possible
validity in itself&mdash;would be, indeed, simply an emotion put by
mistake into the form of a proposition.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_47"
href="#Notech5_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> I thought it was
generally recognized that every proposition is either true or false,
and that this must consequently be the case also with the proposition
&ldquo;this is good,&rdquo; whatever be the meaning of its predicate.
But whether it is true <i>or</i> false just depends on the meaning
given to it. If, as I maintain, the objective validity of all moral
valuation is an illusion, and the proposition &ldquo;this is
good&rdquo; is meant to imply such validity, it must always be false.
On the other hand, if &ldquo;good&rdquo; expresses a tendency to feel
moral approval, the proposition in question is, as already said, true
if there really is such a tendency with regard to that of which
goodness is predicated, and false if there is no such
tendency&mdash;people are often hypocrites in their moral judgments.
The same predicate is thus used in a sense that makes the proposition
always false, and in another sense that makes it either true or
false&mdash;just as the proposition &ldquo;the sun sets&rdquo; was
always false in those days when everybody believed that it was the sun
and not the earth that moved, but may be either true or false when its
predicate is used in the present sense of the word. As to the alleged
mistake of putting an emotion into the form of a proposition, it
should be noticed that all of us, even normative moralists, are guilty
of similar &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; when we say that something is
fearful, wonderful, hateful, admirable, lovable, or what not.</p>

cit.</i>, p. 68.</p></div>

<p>Professor Moore has raised other objections to my <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page143"></a>143</span>theory of the emotional
origin of the moral concepts. He argues that if one person says
&ldquo;this action is wrong,&rdquo; and another says of the very same
action that it is not wrong, and each of them merely makes a judgment
about his own feelings towards it, they are not differing in opinion
about it at all, and, generally speaking, there is absolutely no such
thing as a difference of opinion upon moral questions. &ldquo;If two
persons think they differ in opinion on a moral question (and it
certainly seems as if they sometimes <i>think</i> so), they are
always, on this view, making a mistake, and a mistake so gross that it
seems hardly possible that they should make it: a mistake as gross as
that which would be involved in thinking that when you say, &lsquo;I
did not come from Cambridge to-day&rsquo; you are denying what I say
when I say &lsquo;I did.&rsquo;&rdquo; This seems to Professor Moore
to be a very serious objection to my view.<a id="Anchornotech5_48"
href="#Notech5_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> But let me choose
another, analogous case, to illustrate the nature of his argument. One
person says, &ldquo;This food is disagreeable,&rdquo; and another says
of the very same food that it is not disagreeable. We should
undoubtedly assert that they have different opinions about it. On
Professor Moore&rsquo;s view this shows that the two persons do not
merely judge about their feelings but state that the food really is,
or is not, disagreeable, and if they admitted that they only expressed
their own feelings&mdash;as they most probably would if their
statements were challenged<a id="Anchornotech5_49"
href="#Notech5_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a>&mdash;and yet
thought that they differed in opinion, they would make a mistake
almost too great to be possible. For my own part I venture to believe
that most people would find it absurd if they <i>denied</i> that they
had different opinions about the food. This follows from the fact that
the subjective experience has been objectivized in <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page144"></a>144</span>the speech as a quality
attributed to the object, and seems the more natural on account of the
ambiguous meaning which the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; has in common
parlance, where it is used both for a judgment and for the expression
of a feeling.<a id="Anchornotech5_50" href="#Notech5_50"><span
class="sp">50</span></a> Indeed, in another place Professor Moore
himself admits that &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s <i>feelings</i> with regard
to an action are not always clearly distinguished from his
<i>opinion</i> as to whether it is right or wrong,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;one and the same word is often used, sometimes to express the
fact that a man has a <i>feeling</i> towards an action, and sometimes
to express the fact that he has an <i>opinion</i> about it.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_51" href="#Notech5_51"><span
class="sp">51</span></a> It seems to me that this admission itself is
sufficient to deprive his argument of all evidential value.</p>

<p>Dr. Ross repeats Professor Moore&rsquo;s argument, which he finds
unanswerable, and adds the following one of his own against the view
that identifies goodness with the presence of some feeling: &ldquo;If
something, without changing its nature, at some moment aroused for the
first time the feeling in some mind, we should clearly judge not that
the object had then first become good, but that its goodness had then
first been apprehended.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech5_52"
href="#Notech5_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> This is simply
implied in the common sense belief in the objectivity of moral values,
which I have examined before. But it is certainly in perfect agreement
with my theory of moral values that we may judge an act to have been
good before it evoked moral approval in us, since our tendency to feel
this emotion, which constitutes its goodness, is something quite
different from our actual feeling of it. I agree with Dr. Ross that
if, for instance, some one were to become aware of an act of
self-denial and admire it, he might &ldquo;pronounce that it had been
good even when no one had <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page145"></a>145</span>been admiring it,&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_53" href="#Notech5_53"><span
class="sp">53</span></a> inasmuch as he might attribute to himself a
tendency to admire or, as I should say, approve of it, and
consequently to the object a tendency to arouse in him the emotion of
approval. Such a tendency is exactly on a par with that power of
producing aesthetic enjoyment which, according to Dr. Ross, is the
characteristic of a beautiful object.<a id="Anchornotech5_54"
href="#Notech5_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> And I think that if
Professor Moore&rsquo;s objection to my theory of the subjectivity of
moral values were sound, it would also apply to Dr. Ross&rsquo; view
of beauty. He says that if the same object produces genuine aesthetic
enjoyment in one individual and genuine aesthetic repulsion in
another, the same object is both beautiful and ugly, and that
consequently our ordinary ideas about beauty and ugliness require
revision, since we generally mean by &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ugly&rdquo; attributes which cannot belong to the same thing.<a
id="Anchornotech5_55" href="#Notech5_55"><span
class="sp">55</span></a> This is quite analogous to my view that the
same act can be both good and bad, according as it is approved of by
one individual and disapproved of by another. And in either case we
may certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146"></a>146</span> say
that the two individuals differ in opinion about that on which they
pronounce their judgments. How, then, can Dr. Ross regard Professor
Moore&rsquo;s argument against me as &ldquo;unanswerable&rdquo;?</p>

(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 128) says that &ldquo;we cannot judge an object

it,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the judgment, while it is not a judgment
about the judger&rsquo;s state of mind, is one in which, on the
strength of his knowledge of (or opinion about) his state of mind, he
ascribes an attribute to an object. And if we ask ourselves what is
the common attribute belonging to all beautiful objects, we can, I
believe, find none other than the power of producing the kind of
enjoyment known as aesthetic.&rdquo; He admits that &ldquo;we do not
<i>mean</i> by &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; an attribute having even this
sort of reference to a mind, but something entirely resident in the
object, apart from relation to a mind&rdquo;; but suggests that
&ldquo;we are deceived in thinking that beautiful things have any such
common attribute over and above the power of producing aesthetic
enjoyment.&rdquo; This view of beauty is precisely similar to my view
of moral values, namely, that the moral attributes are ultimately
tendencies to feel either moral approval or disapproval interpreted as
dynamic tendencies in the phenomena that gave rise to the emotion, and
that we are deceived if we think they are anything else.</p></div>

<p>The other critical remark that Professor Moore has made on my
theory has also reference to the meaning of words. He says it is
commonly believed that some moral rules exhibit a <i>higher</i>
morality than others, and asks what I could mean by saying that
A&rsquo;s morality is higher than B&rsquo;s. He gives himself the
answer: I could only mean that &ldquo;A&rsquo;s morality is <i>my</i>
morality, and B&rsquo;s is not.&rdquo; There is no inconsistency in
this: my denial of objective moral standards does not prevent my
pronouncing moral judgments which are expressions of my own moral
feelings, and whatever terms I use they have to be interpreted
accordingly. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;it seems to me quite
clear that when we say one morality is higher than another, we do not
merely mean that it is our own. We are not merely asserting that it
has a certain relation to our own feelings.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech5_56" href="#Notech5_56"><span

most people&rsquo;s judgments, but this does not disprove my view that
their assumed objectivity is an illusion. Leslie Stephen says each man
thinks that his own morality is the <i>right</i> morality, and that
any other standard is mistaken.<a id="Anchornotech5_57"

maintain that it is so, because it is thought to be so?</p>

emotion be &ldquo;true&rdquo;? But I have said that the moral
consciousness has developed from unreflective to reflective, which
implies that the moral emotions have come to be more and more
influenced by thought and reasoning.</p>

<p>Though all moral judgments are ultimately based on emotions, the
influence that intellectual factors exercise on such judgments is very
great indeed.<a id="Anchornotech5_60" href="#Notech5_60"><span
class="sp">60</span></a> Emotions are determined by cognitions and
differ in nature or strength according as the cognitions differ. This
has been a very important cause of the variations of moral judgments:
the same course of conduct is differently judged of because different
ideas are held as to its nature or implications. If a person tells an
untruth we are apt to feel indignant; but if, on due consideration of
facts, we find that his motive was benevolent, for instance, to save
the life of the person to whom the untruth was told, our indignation
ceases and may be followed by approval. A moral judgment may be said
to be more enlightened in proportion as it is influenced by reflection
or knowledge, and the so-called moral evolution largely consists in a
gradual progress in enlightenment. On this subject I shall have much
more to say in the two following chapters.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

mine (<i>op. cit.</i>, i. 20) to the effect that if it could be

they would perhaps be more apt to listen to the voice of reason, has

to the exclamation, &ldquo;&lsquo;The voice of reason,&rsquo;
forsooth, when the whole chapter is a diatribe against the notion that
Reason has anything to say about conduct.&rdquo; This inaccuracy is
astounding. In that very same chapter I have said (<i>op. cit.</i>, i.
10), &ldquo;The influence of intellectual considerations upon moral
judgments is certainly immense.&rdquo;</p></div>

<br />THE SUBJECTS OF MORAL JUDGMENTS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="noind"><span class="small">The</span> moral emotions are not
only at the bottom of the predicates of moral judgments, but also
account for the general nature of their subjects.</p>

<p>Moral judgments are commonly said to be passed upon conduct and
character. This is a convenient mode of expression, but needs
explanation. The term &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes various elements
into which the subjects of moral judgments may be resolved. In the
first place it may be an act, by which I understand an event together
with the intention to produce it. I then maintain that there can be
only one intention in one act, and reject as confusing such
distinctions as that between the immediate and the remote intentions
or the direct and the indirect intentions of an act, which have been
made by some moralists. It has been said, for instance, that if a
nihilist seeks to blow up a train containing an emperor and others,
his direct intention may be simply the destruction of the emperor, but
that he indirectly also intends the destruction of the others who are
in the train, since he is aware that their destruction will be
included along with that of the emperor.<a id="Anchornotech6_1"
href="#Notech6_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In this case we have
two intentions and, if the nihilist succeeds in realizing them, two
acts, namely, the blowing up of the train and the killing of the
emperor; the former of these acts does not even necessarily involve
the latter. But I fail to see that there is any intention at all to
kill other persons. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page149"></a>149</span>The nihilist&rsquo;s non-intention in this
respect may not serve as an extenuation of his guilt, but we must not
confound a moral estimate with the psychical fact to which it refers.
His intention to blow up the train involved an extreme disregard of
the fate of those persons, he knowingly exposed them to extreme
danger; and this may have been held as blamable as if he had intended
to kill them.</p>

Sidgwick, <i>The Methods of Ethics</i> (London, 1913), p. 202
n.</p></div>

<p>More strictly speaking, however, the moral judgments we pronounce
on acts do not really relate to the event but to the intention; and a
moral judgment may refer to a mere intention, independently of its
being realized or not. The event is of moral importance only in so far
as it indicates a decision that is final; &ldquo;the road to hell is
paved with good intentions.&rdquo; External events are generally the
direct causes of our moral emotions; indeed, without the <i>doing</i>
of harm and the <i>doing</i> of good the moral consciousness would
never have come into existence. Hence the ineradicable tendency to
pass moral judgments upon acts, though they really refer to the final
intentions involved in acts. It would be both inconvenient and
purposeless to deviate, in this respect, from the established usage.
And no misunderstanding can arise if it is borne in mind that by an
&ldquo;act,&rdquo; as the subject of a moral judgment, is invariably
understood the event <i>plus</i> the intention which produced it, and
that the very same moral judgment as is pronounced on acts would also,
on due reflection, be recognized as valid with reference to final
decisions in cases where purely accidental circumstances prevented the
accomplishment of the act.</p>

<p>It is in their capacity of volitions that intentions are subjects
of moral judgments. But there are certain other conations that also
may be the objects of moral blame or praise, namely, deliberate
wishes, which have been too little noticed both by psychologists and
moralists. In the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page150"></a>150</span>realm of conations decisions and deliberate
wishes form a province by themselves by being, in contrast to mere
impulses, expressions of a man&rsquo;s character or
&ldquo;will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If moral judgments are passed on intentions and deliberate wishes,
it follows that they may, in many cases, be passed on motives. The
term &ldquo;motive&rdquo; has been defined in different ways. It has
been taken to mean an element in deliberation, the selected impulse in
the conflict between various impulses, which normally results in a
volitional action.<a id="Anchornotech6_2" href="#Notech6_2"><span
class="sp">2</span></a> More frequently, I believe, it is used in a
wider sense. I understand by it the conative cause or reason of an
intention or a deliberate wish, a conation that &ldquo;moves&rdquo;
the will.<a id="Anchornotech6_3" href="#Notech6_3"><span
class="sp">3</span></a> As such it may itself be, or not be, an
intention or a deliberate wish; and if it is, it obviously falls
within the sphere of moral valuation. But it should be noticed that if
the motive of an act is an intention, it must be an intention
belonging to another act. When Brutus helped to kill Caesar in order
to save his country, his intention to save it was the reason, and
therefore the motive, of his intention to kill Caesar. Some writers
have said that the motive of an act is a part of the intention. But if
the intention of an act is a part of the act itself, and a motive is
the cause of an intention, the motive of an act cannot be a part of
its intention, since a part cannot be the cause of the whole of which
it forms a part.</p>

&ldquo;Motive.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>But even motives which, being neither intentions nor deliberate
wishes, are no proper subjects of moral valuation, may nevertheless
indirectly exercise much influence on moral judgments. One such motive
is fear; hence compulsion is also in the eye of the law a frequent
ground of extenuation.<a id="Anchornotech6_4" href="#Notech6_4"><span
class="sp">4</span></a> Strictly speaking, a volition can never be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151"></a>151</span>compelled into
existence;<a id="Anchornotech6_5" href="#Notech6_5"><span
class="sp">5</span></a> to act under compulsion really means to act
under the influence of a non-voluntary motive which is so powerful
that every ordinary human will would yield to it. As Aristotle puts
it, pardon is given when &ldquo;a man has done what he ought not to
have done through fear of things beyond the power of human nature to
endure and such that no man could undergo them. And yet,
perhaps,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;there are some things which a man must
never allow himself to be compelled to do, but must rather choose
death by the most exquisite torments.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_6"
href="#Notech6_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> There is also what is
called &ldquo;compulsion by necessity.&rdquo; If a person without
permission gratifies his hunger with food that is not his own, the
impulse which is the motive of his act has by itself no moral value.
Nevertheless it must be taken into account by him who judges of the
act: other things being equal, the person is less guilty in proportion
as his hunger is more intense, and in extreme cases he may incur no
blame at all; and this is likewise recognized by many laws.<a
id="Anchornotech6_7" href="#Notech6_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
So also, if any one commits a crime in a rage he is less blamable, and
punished less severely,<a id="Anchornotech6_8" href="#Notech6_8"><span
class="sp">8</span></a> than if he commits the same crime in cold
blood; in this case, too, the moral judgment is modified by the
pressure that a mere impulse exercises upon the agent&rsquo;s will. No
man is responsible for such a pressure, unless it be due to choice or
it might have been avoided with due foresight, and a thoughtful judge
can only blame the agent for not having resisted the impulse, but
allowed it to determine his will. In certain cases of mental disease a
morbid impulse may take such a despotic possession of the patient as
to drive him to the infliction of an injury. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page152"></a>152</span>He may be dominated by an impulse to kill
somebody which he cannot resist; or he may yield to an impulse to
steal or to set fire to houses or other property, without having any
purpose to serve by what he does or any ill-feeling against the owner
of the property. The deed to which the patient is driven may be one
that he abhors, as when a mother kills the child whom she loves most.
In such cases the agent is acquitted by an enlightened and scrupulous
moral judge, and if he is condemned by the law of his country and its
guardians, the reason for this can be nothing but ignorance.</p>

<p>If we more carefully analyze our moral judgments, however, we have
to admit that they are not really passed on intentions or deliberate
wishes in the abstract, but on the persons who have them: <i>they</i>
are held blamable or worthy of praise. And the reason for this is that
the moral emotions are reactionary attitudes towards living beings.
When moral judgments formally refer to intentions or deliberate wishes
they intrinsically refer to persons on account of them. Such judgments
may then include both the intention of an act and its motive, but they
may also have reference to either of them separately. Many judgments
take notice only of the intention of an act and say nothing about its
motive. This is particularly the case with judgments the predicates of
which express no tendency to feel either approval or disapproval if
the act is performed, such as &ldquo;right,&rdquo; both as an
adjective and a substantive, and &ldquo;just.&rdquo; An act is
&ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;just&rdquo; independently of its motive;
so also what a person has &ldquo;a right&rdquo; to do he may do from
any motive whatever, and when his right is a duty that other persons
owe him their motives for fulfilling this duty are not thought of at
all. At the same time we may very well blame or praise a man on
account of his motive when he does an act that is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page153"></a>153</span>&ldquo;right&rdquo; or
&ldquo;just.&rdquo; If a man saves a fellow creature from drowning in
the hope of being paid for the trouble, it would be absurd to deny
that his act is right, but his motive may nevertheless be called bad.
On the other hand, even if he had done it in circumstances which
exposed him to so great a danger that it could not be required of him
as a duty, we should hardly call his action good or meritorious, that
is, bestow moral praise on a person for an act the motive of which we
disapprove.</p>

<p>If the motive is not considered when an act is called right, it may
seem natural that it should not be considered either when an act is
called wrong. But these cases are not quite analogous. As long as
people do what they ought to do, we have generally no reason for
inquiring into their motives; and when we call their actions right we
neither blame nor praise them. But when we say that a person has acted
wrongly we blame him for his act, and a conscientious judge would
consider it necessary to examine his motive before condemning him. It
has been said that a man is not necessarily blamable because he has
acted wrongly.<a id="Anchornotech6_9" href="#Notech6_9"><span
class="sp">9</span></a> But this is, in my opinion, to dissociate the
act from the agent in a way which our moral consciousness cannot
easily accept. As already said, there are cases in which even so
stereotyped expressions of moral feelings as laws pay regard to the
motives of acts, and the tendency of modern criminal law is to do so
more and more, just under the influence of men&rsquo;s moral
judgments. It would sound strange to hear that a person is a criminal
if he has been acquitted by the judge, and it seems scarcely more
appropriate to say that he has acted wrongly if he is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page154"></a>154</span>free from blame. But
this is a purely formal question of no deeper ethical
significance.</p>

<p>A volition may have reference not only to the doing of a thing, but
to the refraining from doing a thing. It may form part not only of an
act but of a forbearance, and may as such be the subject of moral
judgment no less than the intention involved in an act. But willing
not to do a thing must be distinguished from not willing to do a
thing: forbearances must be distinguished from omissions. An omission,
in the restricted sense of the word, is characterized by the absence
of volition; it is, as Austin put it, &ldquo;the not doing a given
act, without adverting (at the time) to the act which is not
done.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_10" href="#Notech6_10"><span
class="sp">10</span></a> Now moral judgments refer not only to willing
but to not-willing as well, not only to acts and forbearances but to
omissions. It is curious that this important point has been so little
noticed by writers on ethics, although it constitutes a distinct and
frequent fact in our moral judgments. It has been argued that what is
condemned is really a volition, not the absence of a volition; that an
omission is bad, not because the person did not do something, but
because he did something else, &ldquo;or was in such a condition that
he could not will, and is condemned for the acts which brought him
into that condition&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech6_11"
href="#Notech6_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> or that moral blame
attaches to him only &ldquo;in so far as his carelessness is the
result of some wilful neglect of duty.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_12"
href="#Notech6_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> All this seems to me
to be defective analysis. If a person forgets to discharge a certain
duty incumbent upon him, say, to pay a debt, he is censured<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page155"></a>155</span> not for anything he
did, but for not doing a thing he ought to have done, because he did
not think of it; he is blamed for his forgetfulness. In other words,
his guilt lies in his negligence.</p>

<p>Closely related to negligence is heedlessness; the difference
between them is seemingly greater than it really is. While the
negligent man omits an act that he ought to have done, because he does
not think of it, the heedless man does an act from which he ought to
have forborne, because he does not consider its probable or possible
consequences.<a id="Anchornotech6_13" href="#Notech6_13"><span
class="sp">13</span></a> In the latter case there is acting, in the
former case there is absence of acting; but in both cases the moral
judgment refers to want of attention, that is, to not-willing. In
rashness, again, the person adverts to the mischief that his act may
cause, but from insufficient advertence assumes that it will not
ensue; his fault is partial want of attention. Negligence,
heedlessness, and rashness, are all included under the common term
&ldquo;carelessness.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech6_13" href="#Anchornotech6_13">13</a></span> In the common
use of language the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; often stands for
heedlessness as well, or for carelessness. I use it here in the sense
in which it was applied by Austin (<i>op. cit.</i>, i. 439
<i>sq.</i>).</p></div>

<p>Our moral blame, however, is concerned with not-willing only in so
far as it attributed to a defect of the will, not to the influence of
intellectual or other circumstances for which no man can be held
responsible. That power in a person which is called his
&ldquo;will&rdquo; is regarded as a cause, not only of such events as
are intended, but of such events as we think that the person
&ldquo;could&rdquo; have prevented by his will. And just as, in the
case of volitions, the guilt of the party is affected by the pressure
of non-voluntary motives, so in the case of carelessness mental facts
falling outside the sphere of the will must be closely considered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156"></a>156</span>by the
conscientious judge. But nothing is harder than to apply this rule in
practice.</p>

<p>Equally difficult it is, in many cases, to decide whether a
person&rsquo;s behaviour is due to want of advertence or is combined
with a knowledge of what his behaviour implies, or of the consequences
that may result from it&mdash;to decide whether it is due to
carelessness, or to something worse than carelessness. For him who
refrains from performing an obligatory act, though adverting to it,
&ldquo;negligent&rdquo; is certainly too mild an epithet, and he who
knows that mischief will probably result from his deed is certainly
worse than heedless. Yet even in such cases the immediate object of
blame may be the absence of a volition&mdash;not a want of attention,
but a not-willing to do, or a not-willing to refrain from doing, an
act in spite of advertence to what the act implies or to its
consequences. I may abstain from performing an obligatory act though I
think of it, and yet at the same time make no resolution not to
perform it. So too, if a man is ruining his family by his drunkenness
he may be aware that he is doing so, and yet he may do it without any
volition to that effect. In these cases the moral blame refers neither
to negligence or heedlessness, nor to any definite volition, but to
disregard of one&rsquo;s duty or of the interests of one&rsquo;s
family. At the same time the transition from conscious omissions to
forbearances, and the transition from not-willing to refrain from
doing to willing to do, are easy and natural; hence the distinction
between willing and not-willing may be of little or no significance
from an ethical point of view. For this reason such consequences of an
act as are foreseen as certain or probable have commonly been included
under the term &ldquo;intention,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_14"
href="#Notech6_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> often as a special
branch of intention&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page157"></a>157</span>&ldquo;oblique,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;indirect,&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; intention;<a
id="Anchornotech6_15" href="#Notech6_15"><span
class="sp">15</span></a> but, as was already noticed, this terminology
is hardly appropriate. I shall call such consequences of an act as are
foreseen by the agent, and such incidents as are known by him to be
involved in his act, &ldquo;the known concomitants&rdquo; of the act.
When the nihilist blows up the train containing an emperor and others,
with a view to killing the emperor, the extreme danger to which he
exposes the others is a known concomitant of his act. So, also, in
most crimes, the breach of law, as distinct from the act intended, is
a known concomitant of the act, inasmuch as the criminal, though aware
that his act is illegal, does not perform it for the purpose of
violating the law. As Bacon said, &ldquo;no man doth a wrong for the
wrong&rsquo;s sake, but thereby to purchase himself profit, or
pleasure, or honour, or the like.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_16"
href="#Notech6_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> On the other hand,
nobody is responsible for such concomitants of his acts as he could
not know. Hence certain classes of agents&mdash;animals, children,
idiots, madmen&mdash;who are more or less unable to know or foresee
the implications or consequences of their acts are totally or
partially exempted from moral blame as well as legal punishment.</p>

<p>Absence of volitions, like volitions themselves, gives rise not
only to moral blame, but to moral praise. We may, for instance,
applaud a person for refraining from doing a thing beneficial to
himself but harmful to others, which in similar circumstances would
have proved too great a temptation to any ordinary man; and it does
not necessarily lessen his merit if the opposite alternative did not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158"></a>158</span>even occur to his
mind, and his abstinence, therefore, could not possibly be ascribed to
a volition. Very frequently moral praise refers to known concomitants
of acts rather than to the acts themselves. The merit of saving
another person&rsquo;s life at the risk of one&rsquo;s own really lies
in the fact that the knowledge of the danger did not prevent the saver
from performing his act; and the merit of the charitable man depends
on the loss that he inflicts upon himself by giving his property to
the needy. In these and analogous cases of self-sacrifice for a good
end, the merit, strictly speaking, consists in not-willing to avoid a
known concomitant of a beneficial act. But there are also instances in
which moral praise is bestowed on a person for not-willing to avoid a
known concomitant which is itself beneficial. Thus it may on certain
conditions be magnanimous of a person not to refrain from doing a
thing, although he knows that his deed will benefit somebody who has
injured him, and towards whom the average man in similar circumstances
would display resentment.</p>

<p>All these various elements into which the subjects of moral
judgments may be resolved, viewed with reference to all such
circumstances as may influence their moral character, are included in
the term &ldquo;conduct.&rdquo; In order to form an accurate idea of
these circumstances, it is necessary to consider not only the case
itself but the man&rsquo;s character, if by character is understood a
person&rsquo;s will regarded as a continuous entity.<a
id="Anchornotech6_17" href="#Notech6_17"><span
class="sp">17</span></a> The subject of a moral judgment is, strictly
speaking, a person&rsquo;s will conceived <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page159"></a>159</span>as the cause of his conduct; and since a
man&rsquo;s will or character is a continuity, it is necessary that
any judgment passed upon him in a particular case should take notice
of his will as a whole, his character. We impute a person&rsquo;s
conduct to him only in so far as we regard it as a result or
manifestation of his character, as directly or indirectly due to his
will. Hume observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Actions are, by their very nature,
temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some
<i>cause</i> in the character and disposition of the person who
performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor
infamy, if evil.&hellip; The person is not answerable for
them.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_18" href="#Notech6_18"><span
class="sp">18</span></a> There is thus an intimate connection between
character and conduct as subjects of moral valuation. When judging of
a man&rsquo;s conduct in a special instance, we judge of his
character, and when judging of his character we judge of his conduct
in general.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that moral judgments are also passed on
emotions; but I think this implies a misunderstanding of what is
actually judged of. A person who feels resentment may be a proper
object of moral disapproval, not on account of the resentful impulse
as such, but because it has been allowed to develop either into an
intention or into a deliberate wish to make the other person suffer
or, at any rate, into a wish that he shall have to suffer; and the
word resentment may be vaguely used in all these cases. Envy may be
condemned in so far as it contains, not merely a wish to be as
fortunate as the man towards whom it is felt&mdash;the word is often
rather playfully used in this sense&mdash;but a wish that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160"></a>160</span>not be so
fortunate. The commandment, &ldquo;Love your enemies,&rdquo; may imply
something more than the next commandment, &ldquo;Do good to them that
hate you,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_19" href="#Notech6_19"><span
class="sp">19</span></a> it may enjoin you to try to check your anger;
but it cannot reasonably make it an obligation for you to have a
tender feeling towards your enemy. As Kant said, &ldquo;love, as an
affection, cannot be commanded,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_20"
href="#Notech6_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> and the reason for
this is that it cannot be produced by any effort of will. Professor
Moore, who maintains that there is a large class of moral rules that
are concerned with our &ldquo;feelings, thoughts and desires,&rdquo;
mentions as an instance of this kind of rule the tenth commandment,
&ldquo;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; etc.;
yet he admits himself that although I cannot by any single act of will
directly prevent from arising in my mind a desire for something that
belongs to some one else, I might by my will prevent its continuance
&ldquo;by forcing myself to attend to other considerations which may
extinguish the desire.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_21"
href="#Notech6_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> But what about the
censure we pass on a person who rejoices at the misfortune of another?
Dr. Broad calls this joy a wrong emotion, the feeling of which is an
&ldquo;emotional moral defect&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech6_22"
href="#Notech6_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> but I do not think
that even this case gives support to his general view that emotions
are right and wrong in exactly the same sense as actions are.<a
id="Anchornotech6_23" href="#Notech6_23"><span
class="sp">23</span></a> It is true that the joy which is the direct
cause of our censure contains neither an intention nor a deliberate
wish; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161"></a>161</span>but it is an
indication of a malicious disposition of will, and it is for this
reason we blame the person who feels it. If he joyfully contemplates
the misfortune which befalls another it may be assumed that he in
other circumstances would wish him to suffer; Kant called this emotion
&ldquo;ein geheimer Menschenhass.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_24"
href="#Notech6_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> So also the absence
of an emotion may, when viewed as a symptom, give rise to, and be the
apparent object of, a moral judgment. We are apt to blame a man whose
feelings are not affected by the news of some evil that has befallen
his friend, because we regard this as a sign of an uncharitable
character.</p>

<p>Few things are more liable to arouse people&rsquo;s indignation
than opinions that differ from their own, and when the disagreement is
about morals or religion, the indignation may certainly have a claim
to the epithet righteous. Even philosophical theories, like egoistic
hedonism and ethical subjectivism, do not escape the charge of
immorality. But when an opinion as such is morally condemned it can
hardly mean anything else than a condemnation of its realization in
practice, or of the consequences to which it is supposed to lead; and
it may therefore be considered wrong to pronounce or propagate it. At
the same time a person who holds a certain opinion, say an atheist,
may be supposed to lack the indispensable requirement for a good life;
and the very holding of it may be an object of moral disapproval as an
assumed effect of the will&mdash;there is a will to believe. That a
certain belief, or &ldquo;unbelief,&rdquo; is never by itself a
sufficient ground for condemning the person who has it is recognized
both by Catholic and Protestant theology. Thomas Aquinas points out
that the <i>sin</i> of unbelief consists in &ldquo;contrary opposition
to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162"></a>162</span>faith,
whereby one stands out against the hearing of the faith, or even
despises faith,&rdquo; and that, though such unbelief itself is in the
intellect, the cause of it is in the will. And he adds that in those
who have heard nothing of the faith, unbelief has not the character of
a sin, &ldquo;but rather of a penalty, inasmuch as such ignorance of
divine things is a consequence of the sin of our first
parent.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_25" href="#Notech6_25"><span
class="sp">25</span></a> Dr. Wardlaw likewise
observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Ignorance is criminal only when it arises from
wilful inattention, or from aversion of heart to truth. Unbelief
involves guilt, when it is the effect and manifestation of the same
aversion&mdash;of a want of will to that which is right and
good.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_26" href="#Notech6_26"><span
class="sp">26</span></a>&mdash;To shut one&rsquo;s eyes to truth may
be a great wrong, but nobody is blamable for seeing nothing with his
eyes shut.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However obvious it may be that the moral consciousness, when
sufficiently influenced by reflection, intrinsically bestows its blame
and praise upon the will alone, we must not, of course, assume that
moral judgments always and necessarily relate to the will. Let us
briefly consider what light early custom, law, and belief may throw on
this subject.<a id="Anchornotech6_27" href="#Notech6_27"><span
class="sp">27</span></a> That custom is a moral rule, and originally
the only moral rule, has been pointed out above, and ancient customs
are at the foundation of early law-books, in which they were expressly
formulated and enforced by a more definite sanction. It is true that
while such laws express moral ideas prevalent at the time they are
established, they are not, though still in existence, necessarily
faithful representatives of the ideas of a later age; for the legal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163"></a>163</span>form gives the
ancient custom such fixity that it may be able to survive, as a law,
the change of public opinion and the introduction of a new custom. It
may also be said that a law, being a general and at the same time
strictly defined rule of conduct, cannot make special provision for
every case and therefore may fail to satisfy public feelings in
particular instances. But these facts do not affect the general
conclusions we may arrive at.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech6_27" href="#Anchornotech6_27">27</a></span> I have
discussed this subject much more fully in my <i>Moral Ideas</i>, vol.
i. chs. ix.-xii., which also give the authorities for the facts quoted
in the present chapter.</p></div>

<p>We notice that at the lower stages of civilization there is a
considerable lack of discrimination between intentional injuries and
accidental ones, in other words, that moral judgments are largely
influenced by external events involved in, or resulting from, the
conduct of men. The customs of some savage peoples are said to make no
distinction at all between those two kinds of harm, and other savages
impute at least a certain degree of guilt to persons who in our
opinion are perfectly innocent. Nay, even among peoples who have
reached a higher level of culture innocent persons are often punished
by law for bringing about events without any fault of theirs.
Instances of this are found in the laws of the Chinese and the ancient
Babylonians, Hebrews, Hindus, and Teutons. In historic times Teutonic
peoples treated intentional homicide as worse than unintentional, but
even the involuntary manslayer had to pay <i><i>wer</i></i> to the
family of the dead man, and the <i>wer</i> to be paid was not merely
compensation for the loss sustained but it was punishment as well. And
the character of criminality attached to accidental homicide survived
the system of <i>wer</i>. When homicide became a capital offence,
homicide by misadventure was included in the law. It is true that the
involuntary manslayer was not executed but recommended to the mercy of
the prince, and subsequently, when he no longer was in need of mercy,
he nevertheless continued to be treated as a criminal<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page164"></a>164</span> by the law of England.
He was punished with forfeiture of his goods; and according to the
rigour of the law such forfeiture might have been exacted as late as
the year 1828, when the law was finally abolished after having fallen
into desuetude in the course of the previous century.</p>

<p>If men at the earlier stages of civilization generally attach undue
importance to the outward aspect of conduct, the same is still more
the case with their gods. According to the Vedic hymns, whoever with
or without intention offends against the eternal ordinances of Varuna,
the All-knowing and Sinless, arouses his anger and is bound with the
bonds of the god&mdash;with calamity, sickness, or death. In the Greek
literature there are several cases of guilt incurred by the accidental
transgression of some sacred law, the transgressor being perfectly
unaware of the nature of his deed. The Hebrew psalmist cries out,
&ldquo;Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret
faults.&rdquo; Unintentional error, Mr. Montefiore observes, would be
as liable to incur divine punishment as the most voluntary crime, if
it infringed the tolerably wide province in which the right or
sanctity of Yahveh was involved. The rabbis maintained that a false
oath, even if made unconsciously, involves man in sin and is punished
as such; and we meet with a similar opinion in mediaeval Christianity,
where various penitentials condemned to penance a person who, in
giving evidence, swore to the best of his belief, in case his
statement afterwards proved untrue. In other instances, also, penances
were prescribed for mere misfortune; thus, if a person killed another
by pure accident he had to do penance for one or several
years&mdash;if he accidentally killed his father or mother he might
have to do so even for fifteen years. The Scotists expressly declared
that the external deed has <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page165"></a>165</span>a moral value of its own, which increases
the goodness or badness of the agent&rsquo;s intention; and though
this doctrine was opposed by Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, and other
leading theologians, it was nevertheless admitted by them that,
according to the will of God, certain external deeds entail a certain
accidental reward, the so-called <i>aureola</i>.</p>

<p>How shall we explain all these facts? Do they faithfully represent
ideas of moral responsibility? Do they indicate that, at the earlier
stages of civilization, the outward event as such, irrespectively of
the will of the agent, is an object of blame?</p>

<p>Most of the statements that imply a perfect absence of
discrimination between accident and intention refer to the system of
private redress. While this system is more or less regulated by custom
and does not allow the injured party or his kin to treat the offender
just as they please, it nevertheless makes considerable allowance for
their personal feelings, and these feelings are apt to be neither
impartial nor sufficiently discriminate.</p>

<p>In the case of accidental homicide, deference may also have to be
shown for the supposed feelings of the dead man&rsquo;s ghost, who
angry and bloodless is craving for revenge and thirsting for blood,
and ready to persecute his own family if they leave his desires
ungratified. At the same time he also attacks the manslayer and
cleaves to him like a miasma. The manslayer is consequently regarded
as unclean, and has both for his own sake and for the sake of the
community in which he lives to undergo some ceremony of purification
in order to rid himself of the dangerous and infectious pollution; and
this is the case whether the shedding of blood was intentional or
accidental. Now, though this state of uncleanness does not
intrinsically involve guilt, there can be no doubt that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page166"></a>166</span>in various cases the
polluting effect attributed to manslaughter has influenced the moral
judgment of the act; the inconvenient restrictions laid on the tabooed
manslayer easily come to be looked upon in the light of a punishment
and the rites of purification as a means of removing guilt. Moreover,
the notion of a persecuting ghost may be replaced by the notion of an
avenging god; it is a fact of common occurrence that the doings or
functions of one mysterious being are transferred to another. And what
particularly helps to explain the attitude of religion towards
unintentional and unforeseen shedding of human blood is the widespread
idea that the infection of uncleanness is shunned by gods even more
than it is by men.</p>

<p>There are other, more general reasons for the want of
discrimination often displayed by religion in regard to the accidental
transgression of a religious law. When a thing is taboo it is supposed
to be charged with mysterious energy that will injure or destroy the
person who comes into contact with the forbidden thing, whether he
does so wilfully or by mistake. So also, according to primitive
notions, the effect of a curse or an oath is purely mechanical; hence
a person who swears falsely in ignorance exposes himself to no less
danger than a person who perjures himself knowingly. Again, as regards
religious offences in the strictest sense of the term&mdash;that is,
offences against some god that are supposed to arouse his
resentment&mdash;it should be remembered that, just as a man who is
hurt is unable to judge the matter as coolly as does the community at
large, so a god whose ordinances are transgressed is thought to be
less discriminating in his anger than a disinterested human judge, and
consequently more apt to be influenced by the external event. There
are thus various reasons why, in the point that we are discussing,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167"></a>167</span>the religious
beliefs of a people do not faithfully represent their general notions
of moral responsibility.</p>

<p>But though the grossest want of discrimination may be explained
from revengeful feelings and superstitious beliefs, there still remain
a multitude of cases that must be regarded as genuine expressions of
moral disapproval. As to these it should, first, be remembered that
the reflecting moral consciousness also may hold a person blamable for
the unintentional and unforeseen infliction of an injury, namely, in
cases where it assumes want of proper foresight. Now, as we know, it
is often difficult enough to discern whether, or to what extent, an
unintended injury is due to carelessness on the part of the agent;
sometimes it is no easy thing to tell whether an injury was intended
or not. It is not to be expected, then, that distinctions of so subtle
a nature should be properly made by the uncultured mind, and least of
all is it to be expected that such distinctions should be embodied in
early custom and law, which are based on average cases and allow of no
minute individualization. It has been observed that the roughness of
Teutonic justice may be partly explained from the difficulty of
getting any proof of intention or of its absence, from the lack of any
proper distinctions between misadventure and carelessness, and from
the fact that the so-called misadventures of early times covered many
a blameworthy act. But, most important of all, the unreflecting mind
is shocked by the harm done, and cares little for the rest. It does
not press the question whether the harm was caused by the
agent&rsquo;s will or not. It does not make any serious attempt to
separate the external event from the will, and is inclined to assume
that there is a coincidence between the two. This is the main reason
for the indiscriminate attitude of early custom and law towards
accidental injuries. It does not imply any difference<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page168"></a>168</span> in principle between
the enlightened and unenlightened moral consciousness as regards the
subject of moral valuation.</p>

<p>This becomes quite obvious when we consider what a great influence
the outward event exercises upon moral estimates even among ourselves.
&ldquo;The world judges by the event, and not by the design,&rdquo;
says Adam Smith. &ldquo;Every body agrees to the general maxim, that
as the event does not depend on the agent, it ought to have no
influence upon our sentiments, with regard to the merit or propriety
of his conduct. But when we come to particulars, we find that our
sentiments are scarce in any one instance exactly conformable to what
this equitable maxim would direct.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_28"
href="#Notech6_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> If, however, it is
clearly realized that a certain event is the result of merely external
circumstances, that it was neither intended by the agent nor could
have been foreseen by him, in other words, that it is absolutely
unconnected with any defect of will, then there could be no moral
disapproval at all. Such an event could not even call forth a feeling
of revenge. Sudden anger itself cools down when it appears that the
cause of the inflicted pain was a mere accident. Even a dog
distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech6_28" href="#Anchornotech6_28">28</a></span> Adam Smith,
<i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> (London, 1887), p.
152.</p></div>

<p>Morally equivalent to accidental injuries is harm caused by agents
who on account of their intellectual inferiority are unable to know
the implications or consequences of their acts, such as animals,
little children, idiots, and madmen. Yet however irresponsible they
appear to us, they are not always recognized to be so. At lower stages
of civilization animals may be treated as responsible agents. The
custom of avenging the violent death of a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page169"></a>169</span>relative is often extended to cases in
which the slayer was an animal, and animals are even exposed to
regular punishment. In various European countries they have been
judicially sentenced to death and publicly executed in retribution for
injuries inflicted by them. Advocates were assigned to defend the
accused animals, and the whole proceedings, trial, sentence, and
execution, were conducted with all the strictest formalities of
justice. These proceedings seem to have been particularly common from
the end of the thirteenth till the seventeenth century; the last case
in France occurred as late as 1845. It seems to me probable that this
practice of punishing animals after human fashion had developed from
the earlier European custom of giving up a beast who had done some
serious damage, especially if it had caused the death of a man, to the
injured party or his family that it might be retaliated upon. And the
reason for punishing the animal seems simple enough: the animal was
regarded as responsible for its deed. In early records the punishment
is frequently spoken of as an act of &ldquo;justice,&rdquo; and from
various details we can also see how closely the responsibility
ascribed to animals resembled the responsibility of men. A distinction
was made between a mischievous dog that entered a room through an open
door and one that committed a burglary. The repetition of a crime
aggravated the punishment. The animal &ldquo;principal&rdquo; was
punished more severely than the &ldquo;accessories&rdquo;; and, as in
the case of men so in the case of animals, youth was a ground for
acquittal. Once when a sow and her six young ones were tried on a
charge of their having murdered and partly eaten a child, the sow was
condemned to death, whereas the young pigs were acquitted on account
of their youth and the bad example of their mother. The practice of
punishing animals seems less surprising when we consider<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page170"></a>170</span> that even among
ourselves the dog who steals or the horse who kicks arouses a feeling
of resentment that almost claims to be righteous. And in earlier times
beasts were frequently looked upon as more or less rational beings. In
the sixteenth century Benoit wrote that animals often speak. In the
middle of the following century Hieronymus Rorarius published a book
to prove that animals make better use of their reason than men.</p>

<p>The total or partial irresponsibility of childhood has only been
recognized more fully along with a deeper insight into the true nature
of the child. According to early custom children who have committed an
injury are sometimes retaliated upon; and in English records from the
eighteenth century we read of a girl of thirteen who was burned for
killing her mistress, and of a boy of eight who was hanged for arson.
The irresponsibility of the insane has been slowly recognized in
European legislation. Many of them were burned as witches or heretics,
others were treated as ordinary criminals. A lunatic was a hateful
individual because he was supposed to have the devil in him, or
because his affliction was regarded as the visitation of God upon
heresy or sin. But to explain the forensic attitude towards insanity
it should also be noticed that its mental characteristics have been so
little understood that many demented persons have been treated as if
they were sane because they were thought to be sane, and that others,
though recognized as labouring under insane delusions, have been
treated as responsible because they were thought to be sane in other
respects.</p>

<p>Considering how little regard is paid to motives in our own laws,
we must not expect much notice to be taken of them by early law and
custom. Yet we find there cases in which theft committed under stress
of great hunger is left unpunished; and the difference between an
injury which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171"></a>171</span>a
person inflicts deliberately, in cold blood, and one which he inflicts
in the heat of the moment, under the disturbance of great excitement
caused by a wrong done to himself, is widely recognized. Even savages
of so low a type as the Australian natives are said to distinguish
between murder and manslaughter.</p>

<p>It has often been noticed that in early moral codes the so-called
negative commandments, which tell people what they ought not to do,
are much more prominent than the positive commandments, which tell
them what they ought to do. The main reason for this is that negative
commandments spring from the disapproval of acts, whereas positive
commandments spring from the disapproval of forbearances or omissions,
and that the indignation of men is much more easily aroused by action
than by the absence of it. A person who commits a harmful deed is a
more obvious cause of pain than a person who causes harm by doing
nothing, and this naturally affects the guilt in the eyes of the
multitude. The more scrutinizing the moral consciousness, the greater
the importance which it attaches to positive commandments. This is
well illustrated by a comparison between Old and New Testament
morality: the old legal formula began &ldquo;thou shalt not,&rdquo;
the new begins, &ldquo;thou shalt.&rdquo; Yet to say that the new
morality involved the discovery of &ldquo;a new continent in the moral
globe,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_29" href="#Notech6_29"><span
class="sp">29</span></a> is an obvious exaggeration. The customs of
all nations contain not only prohibitions, but positive injunctions as
well. To be generous to friends, charitable to the needy, hospitable
to strangers, are rules that may be traced back to the lowest stages
of savagery known to us. The difference in question is only one of

<p>That moral indignation and moral approval are from the very
beginning felt, not with reference to certain <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page172"></a>172</span>modes of conduct in the abstract, but with
reference to persons on account of their conduct, is obvious from the
intrinsic nature of those emotions. The more a moral judgment is
influenced by reflection, the more it scrutinizes the character that
manifests itself in that individual piece of conduct by which the
judgment is occasioned; but however superficial it be, it
intrinsically refers to a will conceived of as a continuous entity, to
a person regarded as a cause of pleasure or pain. This holds true of
savage and civilized men alike. Even tame animals, in response to a
hurt or a benefit, behave differently towards different persons
according to their previous experience of the agent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After what has been said above the answer to the all-important
question, so frequently ignored by writers on ethics, why moral
judgments are passed on conduct and character is not far to seek.
These judgments spring from moral emotions. The moral emotions are
retributive emotions. A retributive emotion is a reactive attitude of
mind, either hostile or kindly, towards a living being (or something
taken for a living being), regarded as a cause of pain or pleasure.
And a living being is, on due reflection, regarded as a true cause of
pain or pleasure only in so far as this feeling is assumed to be
caused by its will. The correctness of this explanation I consider to
be proved by the fact that not only moral emotions, but also non-moral
retributive emotions when sufficiently deliberate, are felt towards
objects that are exactly similar in nature to those on which moral
judgments are passed. This coincidence cannot possibly be accidental:
it must have its ground in the retributive character of the emotions
which are at the bottom of all moral valuation.</p>

<p>Like moral indignation, deliberate non-moral resentment<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page173"></a>173</span> can be felt only
towards a living being, or towards something which is taken for a
living being. We may be angry with inanimate things for a moment, but
our anger disappears as soon as we reflect that the thing which gave
rise to it is neither volitional nor sensitive. Even a dog who, in
playing with another dog, hurts himself by running into a tree,
changes his angry attitude immediately he notices what gave him
pain.<a id="Anchornotech6_30" href="#Notech6_30"><span

<p>Very similar to injuries resulting from inanimate things are
injuries resulting accidentally from animate beings. If my arm or my
foot gives a push to my neighbour, and he is convinced that the push
was neither intended nor foreseen nor due to any carelessness whatever
on my part, surely he cannot feel angry with me. My neighbour makes a
distinction between a part of my body and myself as a volitional
being, and finds that <i>I</i> am no proper object of resentment when
the cause of the hurt was merely my arm or my foot. An event is
attributed to me as its cause only if it is considered to be connected
in some way or other with my will; and <i>I</i>, regarded as a
volitional and sentient entity, can be a proper object of resentment
only as a cause of pain. As said before, even a dog distinguishes
between being stumbled over and being kicked, and the reason for this
is that the dog scents an enemy in the person who kicks him, but not
in the one who stumbles. We are told of some Kafirs that they expect a
similar discrimination from the elephant; for if an elephant is killed
&ldquo;they seek to exculpate themselves towards the dead animal, by
declaring to him solemnly, that the thing happened entirely by
accident, not by design.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_31"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page174"></a>174</span>We can hardly
feel disposed to resent injuries inflicted upon us by animals, little
children, or madmen when we clearly recognize their inability to judge
of the nature of their acts. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says the Stoic,
&ldquo;do you bear with the delirium of a sick man, or the ravings of
a madman, or the impudent blows of a child? Because, of course, they
evidently do not know what they are doing.&hellip; Would any one think
himself to be in his perfect mind if he were to return kicks to a mule

<p>Non-moral resentment, when sufficiently deliberate, considers
motives of acts. If a man tells us an untruth, our feelings towards
him are not the same if he did it in order to save our life as if he
did it for his own benefit. Moreover, our anger abates, or ceases
altogether, if we find that he who injured us acted under
compulsion,<a id="Anchornotech6_34" href="#Notech6_34"><span
class="sp">34</span></a> or under the influence of a sudden impulse,
too strong for any ordinary man to resist. Then, the main cause of the
injury was not his will, conceived as a continuous entity. It yielded
to the will of somebody else, reluctantly, as it were, or to a
powerful conation which formed no part of his real self. He was merely
an instrument in another&rsquo;s hand, or he was &ldquo;beside
himself,&rdquo; &ldquo;beyond himself,&rdquo; &ldquo;out of his
mind.&rdquo; When we are angry, says Montaigne, &ldquo;it is passion
that speaks, and not we.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_35"

<p>We resent not only acts and volitions, but also omissions, though
generally less severely; and when a hurt is attributed to want of
foresight, our resentment is, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, proportionate to
the degree of carelessness which we lay to the offender&rsquo;s
charge. The less foresight could have been expected in a given case,
the smaller share has the will in the production of the event. Like
moral disapproval, non-moral resentment is not indifferent to the
character of the injurer. It reaches its height when he is found to
nourish habitual ill-will towards the injured party; while the latter
is not deaf to the prayer for forgiveness that springs from genuine
repentance.</p>

<p>Passing to the emotion of gratitude, we find a similar resemblance
between the facts that give rise to this emotion and those which are
objects of moral praise. We may feel some kind of retributive
affection for inanimate objects that have given us pleasure: &ldquo;a
man grows fond of a snuff-box, of a pen-knife, of a staff which he has
long made use of, and conceives something like a real love and
affection for them.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_37"
href="#Notech6_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> But gratitude,
involving a desire to please the benefactor, can reasonably be felt
towards such objects only as are themselves capable of feeling
pleasure. On due deliberation we do not feel grateful to a person who
does good to us by pure accident: since gratitude is directed towards
the assumed cause of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page176"></a>176</span>pleasure and a person is regarded as a
cause only in his capacity as a volitional being, gratitude
presupposes that the pleasure shall be due to his will. For the same
reason motives are taken into consideration by the benefited party. As
Hutcheson observes, &ldquo;bounty from a donor apprehended as morally
evil, or extorted by force, or conferr&rsquo;d with some view of
self-interest, will not procure real good-will; nay, it may raise
indignation.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_38" href="#Notech6_38"><span

<p>The objects towards which non-moral resentment and gratitude are
felt are thus in their general nature precisely similar to those which
are the subjects of moral judgments. This seems to me definitely to
solve a problem which necessarily baffles solution in the hands of
those who fail to recognize that moral judgments are based on emotions
of a retributive character. It has been argued, for instance, that
moral praise and blame are not applied to inanimate things and those
who commit involuntary deeds, because they are administered only
&ldquo;where they are capable of producing some effect&rdquo;;<a
id="Anchornotech6_39" href="#Notech6_39"><span
class="sp">39</span></a> that moral judgment is concerned with the
question of compulsion, because &ldquo;only when a man acts morally of
his own free will is society sure of him&rdquo;;<a
id="Anchornotech6_40" href="#Notech6_40"><span
class="sp">40</span></a> that we do not regard a lunatic as
responsible, because we know that &ldquo;his mind is so diseased that
it is impossible by moral reprobation alone to change his character so
that it may be subsequently relied upon.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech6_41" href="#Notech6_41"><span
class="sp">41</span></a> The bestowal of moral praise or blame on a
person is thus attributed to utilitarian calculation.<a
id="Anchornotech6_42" href="#Notech6_42"><span
class="sp">42</span></a> So consistently did James Mill apply his
theory, that their purpose is the encouragement of right conduct <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page177"></a>177</span>and the discouragement
of wrong,<a id="Anchornotech6_43" href="#Notech6_43"><span
class="sp">43</span></a> that, as his son tells us, he refused to let
his praise or blame be influenced by the motive of the agent:
&ldquo;he blamed as severely what he thought a bad action, when the
motive was a feeling of duty, as if the agents had been consciously
evil doers.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_44" href="#Notech6_44"><span
class="sp">44</span></a> But, as Stuart Mill observes (though he never
seems to have realized the full import of his objection), while we may
administer praise and blame with the express design of influencing
conduct, &ldquo;no anticipation of salutary effects from our feeling
will ever avail to give us the feeling itself.&rdquo;<a

<p>But it is not only with reference to their general nature that
there is a coincidence between the subjects of moral judgments and the
facts which are apt to give rise to retributive emotions: a detailed
inquiry into the moral valuation of the particular modes of conduct
shows its obvious connection with the retributive character of the
moral emotions. The largest portion of my book on <i>The Origin and
Development of the Moral Ideas</i> has been devoted to such an
inquiry, and its result is to my mind the most conclusive proof
possible of my theory of the emotional origin of moral judgments. I do
not know that any other theory on their origin, whatever arguments
have been adduced in support of it, has been subjected to an equally
comprehensive test.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we more closely scrutinize the fact that the subject of a
moral judgment is, strictly speaking, a person&rsquo;s will or
character as the cause of his conduct, we notice that the question how
his character has become what it <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page178"></a>178</span>is, though generally not raised at all, has
something to do with the thoroughness of the judgment. I think most
people would admit that a licentious man who has grown up in corrupt
surroundings is less blamable than an equally licentious man who has
always lived under conditions favourable to virtue, and that a
pickpocket who was kidnapped as a child by a band of pickpockets and
trained to the profession should be looked upon with some indulgence.
It may of course be said that though the person&rsquo;s conduct is
largely due to the influence of external circumstances upon his
character, this influence was not irresistible, that he might have
overcome it by an effort of will, and that consequently he is not free
from blame; but in any case the influences of environment and the
circumstances of upbringing are not irrelevant to the degree of his
guilt. We do make a distinction between the original and the acquired
character, however impossible it is in practice to draw a hard and
fast line between the two. As Leslie Stephen observes, there is in the
whole of our lives a constant action and reaction between the external
and internal conditions, and &ldquo;we cannot disentangle them into
two separate series of events, any more than we can say whether
breathing depends more upon the air or the lungs.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech6_46" href="#Notech6_46"><span
class="sp">46</span></a> But I cannot agree with Professor Field when
he calls it a mere prejudice to say that it would be unfair to condemn
a man for things which are the result of external circumstances over
which he had no control.<a id="Anchornotech6_47"
href="#Notech6_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> We do exempt a man
from blame if we know that he acts under compulsion and hold the
compulsion <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page179"></a>179</span>irresistible for any ordinary man. No
doubt, we should consider it overscrupulous to refrain from
pronouncing a moral judgment on a person because we do not know or
cannot know, how far his character is due to education or environment
and how far it is not, but we have nevertheless to admit that our
judgment might be different if we had such knowledge. In the very
strictest sense of the term, the proper subject of moral judgment is
the innate character,<a id="Anchornotech6_48" href="#Notech6_48"><span
class="sp">48</span></a> and any succeeding change a person&rsquo;s
character undergoes is imputable to <i>him</i> only in so far as it is
caused by the character with which he was born.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

emphasized by Schopenhauer, who even maintained that a person&rsquo;s
character remains unchanged throughout his life (<i>Die Freiheit des
Willens</i>, iii. [<i>SÃ¤mmtliche Werke</i>, iv.<span
class="sp">2</span> [Leipzig, 1916], p. 50 <i>sqq.</i>]; <i>Die

class="sp">2</span> 249 <i>sqq.</i>]).</p></div>

<p>But what about the innate character itself? <i>We</i> have not made
it, it is also the product of something outside ourselves. Is all
responsibility, then, a mere delusion? The answer to this question is
considered by many to depend on whether the will is free or not: if it
is free the origin of the character is a matter of no consequence, if
it is not free human beings are said to be no more proper subjects of
moral judgment than are inanimate things. The application of moral
praise and blame would be &ldquo;in itself as absurd as to applaud the
sunrise or be angry at the rain&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech6_49"
href="#Notech6_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> the only kind of
admiration a virtuous man might deserve would be that &ldquo;which we
justly accord to a well-made machine.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_50"
href="#Notech6_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> Nor are these
inferences from determinism only weapons forged by its opponents: they
are shared by some of its own adherents. Richard Owen and his
followers maintained that, since a man&rsquo;s character <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page180"></a>180</span>is made <i>for</i> him,
not <i>by</i> him, there is no justice in punishing him for what he
cannot help.<a id="Anchornotech6_51" href="#Notech6_51"><span
class="sp">51</span></a> To Stuart Mill responsibility simply means
liability to punishment, inflicted for a utilitarian purpose.<a
id="Anchornotech6_52" href="#Notech6_52"><span
class="sp">52</span></a> So also Sidgwick&mdash;whose attitude towards
the free-will theory is that of a sceptic&mdash;argues that the common
retributive view of punishment and the ordinary notions of
&ldquo;merit,&rdquo; &ldquo;demerit,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;responsibility,&rdquo; involve the assumption that the will is
free, and that these terms, if used at all, have to be used in new
significations. &ldquo;In this view,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if I
affirm that A is responsible for a harmful act, I mean that it is
right to punish him for it; primarily, in order that the fear of
punishment may prevent him and others from committing similar acts in
future.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech6_53" href="#Notech6_53"><span

<p>If these conclusions are correct it is obvious that, whether the
infliction of punishment be justifiable or not, the <i>feeling</i> of
moral indignation or moral approval is, from the deterministic point
of view, absurd. And yet we find that these emotions are felt by
determinists and indeterminists alike. Apparently the former are not
in the least affected by their notion that the human will is subject
to the general law of cause and effect. Emotions are determined by
specific cognitions, and last only as long as the influence of those
cognitions last. It makes me sorry to hear that some evil has befallen
my friend, but my sorrow disappears directly I find that the rumour
was false. I get angry with a person who hurts me, but my anger
subsides as soon as I recognize that the hurt was purely accidental.
My indignation is aroused by an atrocious crime; but it ceases
completely when I hear that <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page181"></a>181</span>the agent was mad. On the other hand,
however convinced I am that a person&rsquo;s conduct and character are
in every detail a product of causes, that does not prevent me from
feeling towards him retributive emotions&mdash;either anger or
gratitude, moral resentment or approval. This suggests that a
retributive emotion is not essentially determined by the cognition of
free-will. At the same time it seems easy to explain the fallacy which
is at the bottom of the notion that moral valuation is inconsistent
with determinism.</p>

<p>Full responsibility, as we have seen, presupposes freedom from
compulsion. Hence the inference that it also presupposes freedom from
causation, and that complete determination involves complete
irresponsibility. Compulsion is confounded with causation; and this
confusion is due to the fact that the cause which determines the will
is actually looked upon in the light of a constraining power outside
the will. Determinism is confounded with fatalism. When a man&rsquo;s
whole conduct is determined by an external power ruling over human
affairs, a god or an all-powerful fate, he can obviously not be held
responsible for what he does under the influence of such constraint:
the logical outcome of radical fatalism is a denial of all moral
imputability and a rejection of all moral judgment.</p>

<p>Not so with determinism. While fatalism presupposes the existence
of a person who is constrained by an outward power, determinism
regards the person himself as in every respect a product of causes. It
does not assume any part of his will to have existed previous to his
formation by these causes; his will cannot possibly be constrained by
them because there is nothing to constrain, it is made by them. When
we say of a person that he is influenced by external circumstances or
subdued by fate, we regard <i>him</i> as existing independently of
that which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page182"></a>182</span>influences or subdues him, we attribute to
him an innate character which is acted upon from the outside. He would
have been different if he had lived under different conditions of
life, or if fate had left him alone. But could we say that he would
have been different if the causes to which he owes his existence had
been different, if he had been the offspring of different parents?
<i>He</i> would not have existed at all. This is the pivot of the
whole question. A moral emotion and a moral judgment presuppose the
existence of a certain individual with an innate character, it is
towards him that the emotion is felt, on him that the judgment is
passed; beyond that they cannot go. They can consider the influences
to which his innate character has been subjected from the outside
world, they cannot consider the causes from which it has sprung. To do
so would be foreign to their very nature. The moral emotions are no
more concerned with the origin of the innate character than the
aesthetic emotions are concerned with the origin of the beautiful
object. In their capacity of retributive emotions, they are
essentially directed towards sensitive and volitional entities
conceived, not as uncaused themselves, but only as causes of pleasure
or pain.</p>

<br />THE VARIABILITY OF MORAL JUDGMENTS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="noind"><span class="small">Ethical</span> relativity implies
that there is no objective standard of morality, and objectivity
presupposes universality. As truth is one it has to be the same for
any one who knows it, and if morality is a matter of truth and
falsity, in the normative sense of the terms, the same must be the
case with moral truth. If a certain course of conduct <i>is</i> good
or bad, right or wrong, it is so universally, and cannot be both good
and bad, right and wrong. The universality of truth does not mean, of
course, that everybody knows what is true and false. It has constantly
been argued against ethical subjectivism that the variety of moral
judgments no more justifies the denial of moral objectivity than the
diversity in judgments about the course of things disproves the
objectivity of truth. The validity or fallacy of this argument depends
in the first place upon the causes to which the variability of moral
judgments is due.</p>

<p>In the last chapter I pointed out that the subjects of moral
judgments present no difference in principle so far as their general
nature is concerned. Such judgments are passed on conduct and
character, and if they were guided by sufficient knowledge of facts
and reflection there would be no essential difference between them as
regards the general subjective conditions of the modes of conduct to
which they refer. This uniformity as regards the nature of their
subjects is due to the facts that they <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page184"></a>184</span>are all based on moral emotions, and that
the moral emotions are retributive emotions felt towards persons
conceived as causes of pleasure or pain.</p>

<p>But the variability of moral valuation depends in a very large
measure upon intellectual factors of another kind, namely, different
ideas relating to the objective nature of similar modes of conduct and
their consequences. Such differences of ideas may arise from different
situations and external conditions of life, which consequently
influence moral opinion. We find, for instance, among many peoples the
custom of killing or abandoning parents worn out with age or
disease.<a id="Anchornotech7_1" href="#Notech7_1"><span
class="sp">1</span></a> It prevails among a large number of savage
tribes and occurred formerly among many Asiatic and European nations,
including the Vedic people and peoples of Teutonic extraction; there
is an old English tradition of &ldquo;the Holy Mawle, which they fancy
hung behind the church door, which when the father was seaventie, the
sonne might fetch to knock his father in the head, as effete and of no
more use.&rdquo; This custom is particularly common among nomadic
hunting tribes, owing to the hardships of life and the inability of
decrepit persons to keep up in the march. In times when the
food-supply is insufficient to support all the members of a community
it also seems more reasonable that the old and useless should have to
perish than the young and vigorous. And among peoples who have reached
a certain degree of wealth and comfort, the practice of killing the
old folks, though no longer justified by necessity, may still go on,
partly through survival of a custom inherited from harder times, and
partly from the humane intent of putting an end to lingering misery.
What appears to most of us as an atrocious practice may really be an
act of kindness, and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page185"></a>185</span>is commonly approved of, or even insisted
upon, by the old people themselves.</p>

<p>Or take the widespread custom of infanticide.<a
id="Anchornotech7_2" href="#Notech7_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
Among the lower races custom often decides how many children are to be
reared in each family, and not infrequently the majority of infants
are destroyed. This wholesale infanticide is also mainly due to the
hardships of savage life. The helpless infant may be a great burden to
the parents both in times of peace and in times of war. It may prevent
the mother from following her husband about on his wanderings or
otherwise encumber her in her work. Moreover, a little forethought
tells the parents that their child before long will become a consumer
of provisions perhaps already too scanty for the family. Savages, who
often suffer greatly from want of food, may have to choose between
destroying their offspring or famishing themselves. Urgent want is
frequently represented by our authorities as the main cause of
infanticide; and their statements are corroborated by the conspicuous
prevalence of this custom among poor tribes and in islands whose
inhabitants are confined to a narrow territory with limited resources.
For a similar reason infanticide is or has been a custom among many
peoples who have reached a higher degree of civilization. In ancient
times the Semites, or at least some of them, not only practised it
but, in certain circumstances, approved of it or regarded it as a
duty; according to an old Arab proverb, it was a generous deed to bury
a female child. The murder of female infants, either by the direct
employment of homicidal means or by exposure to privation and neglect,
has for ages been a common practice, or even a genuine custom, among
various Hindu castes. Exposure of new-born children was practised by
the people of the Vedic age, as <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page186"></a>186</span>also by other so-called Aryan peoples in
ancient times. The exposure of deformed or sickly infants was a custom
in Greece; at Sparta, at least, it was enjoined by law. Aristotle lays
down the rule with respect to the exposing or bringing up of children,
that &ldquo;nothing imperfect or maimed shall be brought up.&rdquo; He
proposes that the number of children allowed to each marriage shall be
regulated by the State, and that, if any woman be pregnant after she
has produced the prescribed number, an abortion shall be procured
before the foetus has life. It is necessary, he says, to take care
that the increase of the people should not exceed a certain number, in
order to avoid poverty and its concomitants, sedition and other evils.
Yet the exposure of healthy infants, which was of frequent occurrence
in Greece, was hardly approved of by public opinion, although
generally tolerated. In Rome, also, custom or law enjoined the
destruction of deformed infants; but there was no tendency to
encourage infanticide beyond these limits. It has been observed that
while the Greek policy was rather to restrain, the Roman policy was
always to encourage, population. Being engaged in incessant wars of
conquest, Rome was never afraid of being over-populated, but, on the
contrary, tried to increase the number of its citizens by according
special privileges to the fathers of many children and exempting poor
parents from most of the burden of taxation. On the other hand, though
the exposure of healthy infants was disapproved of in pagan Rome, it
was not generally regarded as an offence of very great magnitude, and
during the Empire, when it was practised on an extensive scale, it was
spoken of in the literature with frigid indifference. But Christianity
brought about a complete change of ideas. The early Fathers of the
Church taught that if the abandoned infant died, the unnatural parent
was guilty <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187"></a>187</span>of
nothing less than murder; and the enormity of the crime of causing an
infant&rsquo;s death was enhanced by the notion that children who had
died unbaptized were doomed to eternal perdition. This reminds us of
the fact that the moral ideas about infanticide are also determined by
factors very different from considerations resulting from economic
conditions.</p>

<p>The variability of moral judgments largely originates in different
measures of knowledge, based on experience of the consequences of
conduct, and in different beliefs. In almost every branch of conduct
we notice the influence which the belief in supernatural forces or
beings or in a future state has exercised upon the moral ideas of
mankind, and the great diversity of this influence. Religion or
superstition has on the one hand stigmatized murder and suicide, on
the other hand it has commended human sacrifice and certain cases of
voluntary self-destruction. It has inculcated humanity and charity,
but has also led to cruel persecutions of persons embracing another
creed. It has emphasized the duty of truth-speaking, and has itself
been a cause of pious fraud. It has promoted cleanly habits and
filthiness. It has enjoined labour and abstinence from labour,
sobriety and drunkenness, marriage and celibacy, chastity and temple
prostitution. It has introduced a great variety of new duties and
virtues, quite different from those which are recognized by the moral
consciousness when left to itself, but nevertheless in many cases
considered more important than any other duties or virtues. From this
motley crowd of influences I shall single out a few representative
cases, in which it may be worth while to point out the facts that have
led to the extraordinary diversity of moral opinion.</p>

<p>Hardly any pagan practice has been more revolting to the moral
feelings of Christians than that of human sacrifice,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page188"></a>188</span> which is found not only
among many savages, but occurred in early times among all
Indo-European peoples, the Semites, and the Japanese, and in the New
World among the Mayas and the Aztecs, who practised it on an enormous
scale.<a id="Anchornotech7_3" href="#Notech7_3"><span
class="sp">3</span></a> The gods were supposed to be gratified by such
offerings&mdash;because they had an appetite for human flesh or blood,
or because they required attendants, or because they were angry and
could only be appeased by the death of him or those who aroused their
anger or some representative of the offending community, or who could
exactly tell why? The chief thing is that people know or believe that
on some certain occasion they are in danger of losing their lives;
they attribute this to the designs of a supernatural being; and, by
sacrificing a man, they hope to gratify that being&rsquo;s craving for
human life and thereby avert the danger from themselves. That this
principle mainly underlies the practice of human sacrifice appears
from the circumstances in which it generally occurs. Human victims are
often offered in war, before a battle, or during a siege; for the
purpose of stopping or preventing epidemics; as a method of putting an
end to a devastating famine or drought; or with a view to averting
perils arising from the sea or from rivers. In these cases the
offering of human sacrifices is mostly a matter of public concern, a
method of ensuring the lives of many by the death of one or a few. But
human life is also sacrificed, by way of substitution, for the purpose
of preventing the death of some particular person, especially a chief
or a king, from sickness, old age, or other circumstances. I do not
say that the practice of human sacrifice is in every case based on the
idea of substitution, but I think there is sufficient evidence to
prove that it is as a rule a method of life-insurance&mdash;absurd, no
doubt, according<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189"></a>189</span>
to our ideas, but not an act of wanton cruelty. When practised for the
benefit of the community or in a case of national distress, it is
hardly more cruel than to compel thousands of men to suffer death on
the battlefield on behalf of their country or to advocate the
infliction of capital punishment on the ground of social expediency.
The sacrifice of offenders has in fact survived in the Christian
world, since every execution performed for the purpose of appeasing an
offended and angry god may be justly called a sacrifice. It was a
principle adopted by the Christian Church and the Christian
governments that it belongs to the king &ldquo;to avenge God&rsquo;s
anger very deeply, according as the deed may be,&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech7_4" href="#Notech7_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
and this principle was acted upon till quite modern times and largely
contributed to the excessive severity of the penal codes.</p>

[London, 1840]).</p></div>

<p>Whilst human sacrifice has shocked the feelings of Christians,
there are other cases in which Christian morals and legislation have
treated as most horrible crimes acts which most peoples have looked
upon with considerable moral indifference, if not as altogether
blameless. One such case is suicide.<a id="Anchornotech7_5"
href="#Notech7_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> It is not often that
savages are reported to attach any stigma to it; if they deny
self-murderers the ordinary funeral rites or bury them in a separate
place, they do so for fear of having anything to do with them or in
order to prevent them from mixing with the other dead, because their
ghosts are looked upon as dangerous. In China and Japan suicide is in
many circumstances regarded as an honourable act. Among the Hindus it
has always been considered one of the most acceptable rites that can
be offered to their deities. In none of the few cases of suicide
mentioned in the Old <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page190"></a>190</span>Testament is any censure passed on the
perpetrator of the deed, nor is there any text that forbids a man to
die by his own hand. The Greek tragedians frequently give expression
to the notion that suicide is in certain circumstances becoming to a
noble mind. But according to the Platonic Socrates, &ldquo;there may
be reason in saying that a man should wait, and not take his own life
until God summons him&rdquo;; and Aristotle maintains that he who from
rage kills himself commits a wrong against the State. The opinions of
the philosophers, however, were anything but unanimous, and the
Stoics, especially, advocated suicide as a relief from all kinds of
misery. Throughout the whole history of pagan Rome there was no
statute declaring it to be a crime for an ordinary citizen to take his
own life; the self-murderer&rsquo;s rights were in no way affected by
his deed, his memory was no less honoured than if he had died a
natural death, his will was recognized by law, and the regular order
of succession was not interfered with.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech7_5" href="#Anchornotech7_5">5</a></span> <i>Moral
Ideas</i>, ii. 229 <i>sqq.</i></p></div>

<p>In no question of morality was there a greater difference between
classical and Christian doctrines than in regard to suicide. The
earlier Fathers of the Church still allowed, or even approved of,
suicide in certain cases, namely, when committed in order to procure
martyrdom, or to avoid apostasy, or to retain the crown of virginity;
but since the days of St. Augustine no such exceptions have been
admitted by the Church. Suicide was assimilated with murder, nay, was
declared to be the worst form of murder, &ldquo;the most grievous
thing of all.&rdquo; The self-murderer was deprived of the rights that
were granted to all other criminals. In the sixth century a Council
enjoined that &ldquo;the oblations of those who were killed in the
commission of any crime may be received, except of such as laid
violent hands on themselves&rdquo;; and a subsequent Council denied
the latter the usual rites of Christian burial. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page191"></a>191</span>It was even said that
Judas committed a greater sin in killing himself than in betraying his
master Christ to a certain death. How shall we explain these
views?</p>

<p>According to the Christian doctrine, as formulated by Thomas
Aquinas, suicide is unlawful for three reasons. It is against a
natural inclination and contrary to the charity which a man ought to
bear towards himself; by killing himself a person does an injury to
the community of which he is a part; and he usurps the office of judge
on a point not referred to him, because the judgment of life and death
belongs to God alone. The second of these arguments is borrowed from
Aristotle, and is entirely foreign to the spirit of early Christianity
with its enthusiastic commendation of the hermit life. But the other
two are deeply rooted in some of the fundamental doctrines of
Christianity&mdash;in the sacredness of human life, in the duty of
absolute submission to the will of God, and in the extreme importance
attached to the moment of death. The earthly life is a preparation for
eternity, sufferings which are sent by God are not to be evaded but to
be endured. The man who takes away the life given him by the Creator
displays the utmost disregard for the will and authority of his
Master; and, worst of all, he does so in the very last minute of his
life, when his doom is sealed for ever. His deed, as Thomas Aquinas
says, is &ldquo;the most dangerous thing of all, because no time is
left to expiate it by repentance.&rdquo; This is the crucial point of
the whole question. Considering that this religious view of suicide
has been the cause of the extreme severity with which it has been
treated in Christian countries, it is strange to be told by a
sociologist like Durkheim, that the more lenient judgment passed on it
by the public conscience of the present time is merely accidental and
transient, because moral evolution is not likely to be retrogressive
in this particular <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page192"></a>192</span>point after it has followed a certain
course for centuries.<a id="Anchornotech7_6" href="#Notech7_6"><span
class="sp">6</span></a> This is to ignore the real causes of the
extraordinary condemnation of suicide in Christian countries.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech7_6" href="#Anchornotech7_6">6</a></span> E. Durkheim, <i>Le
suicide</i> (Paris, 1897), p. 377.</p></div>

<p>Another case in which the difference of moral opinion between
Christians and pagans has been equally radical is the attitude towards
homosexual practices.<a id="Anchornotech7_7" href="#Notech7_7"><span
class="sp">7</span></a> In Greece pederasty in its baser forms was
censured, though generally, it seems, with no great severity, but the
universal rule was apparently that when decorum was observed in the
friendship between a man and a youth, no inquiries were made into the
details of the relationship. And this attachment was not only regarded
as permissible, but was praised as the highest form of love, as the
offspring of the heavenly Aphrodite, as a path leading to virtue, as a
weapon against tyranny, as a safeguard of civic liberty, as a source
of national greatness and glory. In Rome there was an old law of
unknown date which imposed a mulct on him who committed pederasty with
a free person; but this law, of which very little is known, had lain
dormant for ages, and the subject of ordinary homosexual intercourse
had never afterwards attracted the attention of the pagan legislators.
But when Christianity became the religion of the Roman Empire, a
veritable crusade was opened against sodomy. Several emperors made it
a capital crime: those who were found guilty of it should be punished
with the sword or be burned alive in the presence of all the people.
&ldquo;A sentence of death and infamy,&rdquo; says Gibbon, &ldquo;was
often founded on the slight and suspicious evidence of a child or a
servant,&hellip; and pederasty became the crime of those to whom no
crime could be imputed.&rdquo; This attitude towards homosexuality had
a profound and lasting influence on European legislation. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page193"></a>193</span>Throughout the Middle
Ages and later, Christian lawmakers thought that nothing but a painful
death in the flames could atone for the sinful act. In France persons
were actually burned for sodomy in the middle and latter part of the
eighteenth century. In England it was punishable by death till 1861,
although in practice the extreme punishment was not inflicted. The
latter fact shows that there was a discrepancy between moral
sentiments and the law.</p>

Ideas</i>, ii. ch. xliii.</p></div>

<p>The enormity of guilt attached to this crime has puzzled moral
philosophers. Kant looks upon sexual perversion as a pollution of
human dignity, but finds the utter reprobation of it very hard to
justify upon grounds of reason.<a id="Anchornotech7_8"
href="#Notech7_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Schopenhauer gives
highly metaphysical explanations, connected with his general theory of
the will, both of the homosexual desire and the condemnation of
pederasty;<a id="Anchornotech7_9" href="#Notech7_9"><span
class="sp">9</span></a> but in one of his works he simply says that
the wrongness of the latter lies in the seduction of the younger and
inexperienced party, who is thereby ruined both physically and
morally.<a id="Anchornotech7_10" href="#Notech7_10"><span
class="sp">10</span></a> He does not raise the question whether the
seduction of a youth is fraught with so much more terrible
consequences than that of a girl as to justify the enormous difference
in the treatment of the seducer. Others maintain that the attitude
towards perversity is only intelligible on the hypothesis that moral
purity is directly judged to have an intrinsic worth quite <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page194"></a>194</span>independent of hedonic
results.<a id="Anchornotech7_11" href="#Notech7_11"><span
class="sp">11</span></a> To me it seems obvious that the censure to
which homosexual intercourse as such is frequently subject is in the
first place due to that feeling of aversion or disgust which it tends
to call forth in normally constituted adult individuals, whose sexual
instincts have developed under normal conditions. This feeling tends
to abate or disappear where special circumstances, such as absence of
the other sex, the seclusion of women, or other facts, have given rise
to widely spread homosexual practices; and in no case does it seem to
have been sufficiently strong by itself to lead to very drastic public
measures. Among uncivilized peoples such practices are generally taken
little notice of; they may be a subject for derision or contemptuous
remarks wounding the vanity of the delinquent by the implication that
he must be unable to procure the full natural enjoyment of his impulse
if he has to resort to such substitutes.<a id="Anchornotech7_12"
href="#Notech7_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> The laws of the
ancient Scandinavians ignored homosexuality, though passive pederasts
were much despised by them, being identified with cowards and regarded
as sorcerers. Chinese law makes little distinction between unnatural
and other sexual offences; but as a matter of fact the former are
regarded by the Chinese as less hurtful to the community than ordinary
immorality, and pederasty is not looked down upon. In Japan there was
no law against homosexual intercourse till the revolution of 1868, and
we are told that in the period of Japanese chivalry it was considered
more heroic if a man loved a person <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page195"></a>195</span>of his own sex than if he loved a woman.
Mohammed forbade sodomy, and the general theory of his followers is
that it should be punished like fornication; but in the Mohammedan
world it is practically regarded, at most, as a mere peccadillo.</p>

<p>In a very different light was it looked upon by the Hebrews.
Unnatural sins are not allowed to defile the land of the Lord:
whosoever shall commit such abominations shall be put to death. The
enormous abhorrence of them expressed in this law had a very specific
reason, namely, the Hebrews&rsquo; hatred of a foreign cult. Unnatural
vice was the sin of a people who was not the Lord&rsquo;s people, the
Canaanites, who thereby polluted their land, so that he visited their
guilt and the land spued out its inhabitants. We know that sodomy
entered as an element into their religion: besides female prostitutes
there were male prostitutes, or <i>qed&#275;sh&#299;m</i>, attached to
their temples. The sodomitic acts committed with the latter seem, like
the connections with the female temple prostitutes, to have had in
view to transfer blessings to the worshippers; in Morocco supernatural
benefits are to this day expected not only from heterosexual, but also
from homosexual intercourse with a holy person. The
<i>qed&#275;sh&#299;m</i> are frequently alluded to in the Old
Testament, especially in the period of the monarchy, when rites of a
foreign origin made their way into both Israel and Judah. And it is
natural that the Yahveh worshippers should regard their practice with
the utmost horror as forming part of an idolatrous cult.</p>

<p>The Hebrew conception of homosexuality passed into Christianity.
The notion that sodomy is a form of sacrilege was here strengthened by
the habits of the gentiles, among whom St. Paul found the abominations
of Sodom rampant. During the Middle Ages heretics were accused <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page196"></a>196</span>of unnatural vice as a
matter of course. Indeed, so closely was sodomy associated with heresy
that the same name was applied to both. Thus the French <i>bougre</i>
(from the Latin <i>Bulgarus</i>, Bulgarian), as also its English
synonym, was originally a name given to a sect of heretics who came
from Bulgaria in the eleventh century and was afterwards applied to
other heretics, but at the same time it became the regular expression
for a person guilty of unnatural intercourse. In mediaeval laws sodomy
was also repeatedly mentioned together with heresy, and the punishment
was the same for both. It thus remained a religious offence of the
first order. And in this fact and its connection with Hebrew ideas we
find the answer to the problem we set out to solve. Like suicide, the
kind of sexual perversion of which I have now spoken has been
stigmatized as a crime of the greatest magnitude on account of its
relation to specific religious beliefs. It is interesting to notice
that in one other religion, besides Hebrewism and Christianity, it has
been looked upon with the same abhorrence, namely, Zoroastrianism, and
there also as a practice of infidels, of Turanian shamanists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In so far as differences of moral opinion depend on knowledge or
ignorance of facts, on specific religious or superstitious beliefs, on
different degrees of reflection,<a id="Anchornotech7_13"
href="#Notech7_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> or on different
conditions of life or other external circumstances, they do not clash
with that universality which is implied in the notion of the objective
validity of moral judgments. We shall now examine whether the same is
the case with other differences that, at least apparently, are not due
to purely cognitive causes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech7_13" href="#Anchornotech7_13">13</a></span> I shall in
another connection (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#page258">p. 258</a>
<i>sq.</i>) discuss the influence of reason in harmonizing differences
of moral opinion springing from sentimental likes and
dislikes.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page197"></a>197</span>When we study
the moral rules laid down by the customs of savage peoples we find
that they in a very large measure resemble the rules of civilized
nations. In every savage community homicide is prohibited by custom,
and so is theft. Savages also regard charity as a duty and praise
generosity as a virtue, indeed their customs relating to mutual aid
are often much more exacting than our own; and many of them are
conspicuous for their avoidance of telling lies. But in spite of the
great similarity of moral commandments, there is at the same time a
difference between the regard for life, property, truth, and the
general well-being of a neighbour which displays itself in savage
rules of morality and that which is found among ourselves: it has,
broadly speaking, only reference to members of the same community or
tribe. Primitive peoples carefully distinguish between an act of
homicide committed within their own community and one where the victim
is a stranger: while the former is in ordinary circumstances
disapproved of, the latter is in most cases allowed and often
considered worthy of praise. And the same holds true of theft and
lying and the infliction of other injuries. Apart from the privileges
granted to guests, which are always of very short duration, a stranger
is in early society devoid of all rights. And the same is the case not
only among savages but among nations of archaic culture as well.</p>

<p>When we pass from the lower races to peoples more advanced in
civilization we find that the social unit has grown larger, that the
nation has taken the place of the tribe, and that the circle within
which the infliction of injuries is prohibited has been extended
accordingly. But the old distinction between injuries committed
against compatriots and harm done to foreigners remains. In Greece in
early times the &ldquo;contemptible stranger&rdquo; had no <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page198"></a>198</span>legal rights, and was
protected only if he was the guest of a citizen; and even later on, at
Athens, while the intentional killing of a citizen was punished with
death and confiscation of the murderer&rsquo;s property, the
intentional killing of a non-citizen was punished only with exile. The
Latin word <i>hostis</i> was originally used to denote a foreigner,
and Mommsen suggests that in ancient days the Romans did not punish
the killing of a foreigner unless he belonged to an allied nation. The
German word <i>elender</i> has acquired its present meaning from the
connotation of the older word which meant an &ldquo;outlandish&rdquo;
man. In Teutonic countries the stranger as such, unless he belonged to
a friendly neighbouring tribe, had originally no legal rights at all;
for his protection he was dependent on individual hospitality, and
hospitality was restricted by custom to three days only.<a
id="Anchornotech7_14" href="#Notech7_14"><span
class="sp">14</span></a> Later on, when commerce increased and the
stranger was more often seen in Teutonic lands, royal protection was
extended to him; but throughout the Middle Ages the position of the
stranger was anything but enviable. All Europe seems to have tacitly
agreed that foreigners had been created for the purpose of being
robbed. In the thirteenth century there were still several places in
France in which a stranger who remained there for a year and a day
became the serf of the lord of the manor. In England, till upwards of
two centuries after the Conquest, foreign merchants were considered
only as sojourners who had come to a fair or market, and were obliged
to employ their landlords as brokers to buy and sell their
commodities; and one stranger was often arrested for the debt or
punished for the misdemeanour of another. The custom of seizing the
goods of persons who had been shipwrecked seems to have been
universal, and in some European countries the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page199"></a>199</span>law even permitted the inhabitants of
maritime provinces to reduce to servitude people who were shipwrecked
on their coast. Along the Baltic coast prayers were offered in the
churches that God would bless the shores with many shipwrecks; and it
was even argued that as shipwrecks were punishments sent by God, it
was impious to be merciful to the victims.<a id="Anchornotech7_15"

<p>It would be in vain to deny that the old distinction between a
tribesman or fellow-countryman and a foreigner is dead among
ourselves. The prevailing attitude towards war, the readiness with
which wars are waged, and the notions as to what is allowed in warfare
indicate the survival in modern civilization of the ancient feeling
that the life, property and general well-being of a foreigner are not
on a par with those of a compatriot. In times of peace this feeling
may disclose itself in the form of national aggressiveness, under the
flag of patriotism, or perhaps in the behaviour towards the aborigines
of some distant country. But both law and public opinion certainly
show a very great advance in humanity with regard to the treatment of
foreigners. And if we pass to the rules laid down by moralists and
professedly accepted by a large portion of civilized humanity, the
change from the savage attitude has been enormous. The doctrine of
universal love is not peculiar to Christianity. The Chinese moralists
inculcated benevolence to all men, without making any reference to
national distinctions. Mih-tsze, who lived in the interval between
Confucius and Mencius, even taught that we ought to love all men
equally; but this precept called forth protests as abnegating the
peculiar devotion due to relatives. Buddhism enjoins the duty of
universal love: &ldquo;As a mother, even at the risk of her own life,
protects her son, her only son, so let a man <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page200"></a>200</span>cultivate goodwill without measure toward
all beings.&rdquo; According to the Hindu work <i>Panchatantra</i> it
is the thought of little-minded persons to consider whether a man is
one of ourselves or an alien, the whole earth being of kin to him who
is generously disposed. In Greece and Rome philosophers arose who
opposed national narrowness and prejudice. Thus the Cynics attached
slight value to the citizenship of any special state, declaring
themselves to be citizens of the world. But it was the Stoic
philosophy that first gave to the idea of a world-citizenship a
definite positive meaning and raised it to historical importance.<a

<p>It is obvious that the expansion of the moral rules has been a
consequence of the expansion of the social unit and of increased
intercourse between different societies, and if, as I maintain, the
range of the moral emotions varies with the range of the altruistic
sentiment, there is every reason to assume that an immediate cause of
the greater comprehensiveness of the moral rules has been a
corresponding widening of that sentiment. Among gregarious animals it
is apt to be felt towards any member of their species that is not an
object of their fear or anger. In mankind it has been narrowed by
social isolation, by differences in race, language, habits, and
customs, by enmity and suspicion. But peaceful intercourse leads to
conditions favourable to its expansion, as well as to friendly
behaviour for prudential reasons in the relations between those who
come into contact with each other. People of different nationalities
feel that in spite of all dissimilarities there is much that they have
in common; and frequent intercourse makes the differences less marked
or obliterates many of them altogether.</p>

<p>Professor McDougall, on the other hand, remarks that the rise of
the spirit of nationality in the modern world <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page201"></a>201</span>has coincided with the great improvements
in means of communication which have multiplied a thousand-fold the
contacts between men of different races and nations, and he believes
that &ldquo;this multiplication of contact, instead of destroying or
weakening the barriers of nationality, the &lsquo;prejudices&rsquo; of
race, the partiality of men for their own kind, has but accentuated
these things, fostered their growth, intensified their influences
throughout the world.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_17"
href="#Notech7_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> That improved means
of communication have made some nations more afraid of some other
nations is obvious; but though you do not love those you fear, you may
respect them and find it to be your interest to treat them with
consideration. In other cases Buckle may be right in saying that
ignorance is a powerful cause of national hatred, and that &ldquo;when
you increase the contact, you remove the ignorance, and thus you
diminish the hatred.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_18"
href="#Notech7_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> Experience derived
from intercourse may certainly strengthen national
&ldquo;prejudices,&rdquo; or bias based on preconceived opinion, but
we know that it also may have the very opposite effect. Professor
McDougall says &ldquo;it remains true in general that the more we know
of other people the more we prefer our own.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech7_19" href="#Notech7_19"><span
class="sp">19</span></a> The idea that one&rsquo;s own people is the
best is very deep-rooted in human nature.<a id="Anchornotech7_20"
href="#Notech7_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> In their intercourse
with white men savages have often noticed with astonishment the
arrogant air of superiority adopted by the latter, because in their
own opinion they are vastly superior to the whites. According to
Eskimo beliefs, the first man, though made by the Great Being, was a
failure and was consequently cast <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page202"></a>202</span>aside and called &ldquo;white man,&rdquo;
but a second attempt resulted in the formation of a perfect man and he
was called <i>in-nu</i>, the name which the Eskimo give to themselves.
If a South Sea Islander sees a very awkward person he says, &ldquo;How
stupid you are, perhaps you are an English man.&rdquo; I once heard a
young European affirm that everything made in his own country was
better than anything similar made in any other country. Of course,
travelling or residence abroad may strengthen our preference to live
among our own people&mdash;&ldquo;East or west, home is
best&rdquo;&mdash;but it should also be apt to open our eyes to the
good qualities of other nations. And, to return to our starting-point,
how could even the modern spirit of nationality be compared to the
attitude towards foreigners in those times when there was little
intercourse between the different nations of Europe?</p>

<p>It has been said that &ldquo;religious ideas have been largely
responsible for the transition from a moral code which includes only
duties towards the members of a small and exclusive circle to a moral
code which embraces, as persons entitled to the performance of certain
services, all mankind&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech7_21"
href="#Notech7_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> that when the deity
came to be considered the Lord of the world, every human being,
independently of nationality and race, was recognized as an object of
his care;<a id="Anchornotech7_22" href="#Notech7_22"><span
class="sp">22</span></a> and that without their belief in God as a
Father, the Christians could never have formed the idea of a common
human brotherhood.<a id="Anchornotech7_23" href="#Notech7_23"><span
class="sp">23</span></a> It is true, of course, that when religion
ceased to be national and became universal, it helped to widen the
boundaries of the moral <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page203"></a>203</span>community; but it should be remembered that
its &ldquo;universality&rdquo; did not imply universal acceptance, and
that those who did not accept it, even when recognized in theory as
&ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; were treated as enemies to God and man. While
extending the moral community to those who had the same faith,
religion thus became a new cause of the differentiation of moral rules
affecting those who had another faith. The moral value of a religion
is to be judged not by its abstract tenets but by its influence on
conduct, and in this respect, as everybody knows, Christianity has
been very far from realizing the idea of a human brotherhood. The
principle of the Church was, &ldquo;Omnem hominem <i>fidelem</i>
judica tuum esse fratrem.&rdquo; The orthodox view that unbelief is a
legitimate reason for going to war has been acted upon to an extent
which made the history of Christianity for many centuries a perpetual
crusade, which turned against infidels and heretics alike, nay, even a
slight shade of difference from the liturgy of Rome became a
legitimate cause of war. When, in the latter part of the Middle Ages,
attempts were made by sovereigns and Councils of the Church to abolish
the ancient right of seizing the goods of persons who had been
shipwrecked, the robbing of shipwrecked infidels was not included in
the prohibitions.<a id="Anchornotech7_24" href="#Notech7_24"><span
class="sp">24</span></a> In the seventeenth century the Scotch clergy
taught that food or shelter must on no occasion be given to a starving
man unless his opinions were orthodox.<a id="Anchornotech7_25"

<p>The expansion of the moral rules has been attributed to reason.
&ldquo;With the rise of reflection,&rdquo; says Professor Sorley,
&ldquo;there comes also a change of the objects valued&mdash;chiefly
by a modification of the tribal or social limits by which they were at
first restricted. The circle of duties is widened until it gradually
takes in, or is fitted to take <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page204"></a>204</span>in, all mankind.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech7_26" href="#Notech7_26"><span
class="sp">26</span></a> The Stoics actually referred to reason in
support of their cosmopolitan ideal. Human society has for its basis
the identity of reason in individuals; hence we have no ground for
limiting this society to a single nation. &ldquo;If our reason is in
common,&rdquo; says Marcus Aurelius, &ldquo;there is a common law, as
reason commands us what to do and what not to do; and if there is a
common law we are fellow-citizens; if this is so, we are members of
some political community&mdash;the world is in a manner a
state.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_27" href="#Notech7_27"><span
class="sp">27</span></a> Seneca argues:&mdash;&ldquo;It is a crime to
injure one&rsquo;s country; so it is, therefore, to injure any of our
countrymen, for he is a part of our country.&hellip; Therefore it is
also a crime to injure any man: for he is your fellow-citizen in a
larger state.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_28" href="#Notech7_28"><span
class="sp">28</span></a> To this great state, which includes all
rational beings, the individual states are related as the houses of a
city are to the city collectively;<a id="Anchornotech7_29"
href="#Notech7_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> and the wise man
will esteem it far above any particular community in which the
accident of birth has placed him.<a id="Anchornotech7_30"
href="#Notech7_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> But there was
presumably also an emotional ground for this abolition of national
boundaries in the moral ideal. The citizen of Alexander&rsquo;s huge
empire had in a way become a citizen of the world; and national
dislikes were so much more readily overcome as the various
nationalities comprised in it were united not only under a common
government, but also in a common culture;<a id="Anchornotech7_31"
href="#Notech7_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> indeed the founder
of Stoicism was himself only half a Greek. And the later Stoics were
citizens of another world-empire. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page205"></a>205</span>But may we really suppose that the
universality of the Christian doctrine was the result of a process of
reasoning? May we suppose that the conception of God as a Father has
led to the conclusion that all men are brothers? If by his fatherhood
is meant that he is <i>our</i> father but not every man&rsquo;s
father, the argument is of course a fallacy; and if it means that he
is every man&rsquo;s father, this proposition implies that all men are
brothers. The latter proposition may have served to point out the
import of the former, but can hardly be said to have been deduced from
it. It seems that the Christian doctrine of the fatherhood of God and
the brotherhood of man was the outcome of the altruistic sentiment of
its author, which was comprehensive enough to embrace all mankind. It
should be noticed that the Eastern tenets of universal love were not
connected with any notion of a divine fatherhood.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be argued that the impartiality which is a
characteristic of all moral judgments required a universalization of
the moral rules, and that this could only be accomplished by a process
of reasoning, which gradually extended them to wider and wider circles
of men and finally to the whole human race.<a id="Anchornotech7_32"
href="#Notech7_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> But let us remember
what the impartiality of moral judgments really implies. I have
derived it<a id="Anchornotech7_33" href="#Notech7_33"><span
class="sp">33</span></a> from the fact that the retributive emotions
which are expressed in the moral concepts are both disinterested, in
the strict sense of the term, and are assumed by those who feel them
to be uninfluenced by the particular relationship in which they stand
to those who are immediately affected by the acts in question and also
to those who perform the acts, or at the very least, that they are not
knowingly partial. When a person pronounces an act right or wrong, it
implies that <i>ceteris <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page206"></a>206</span>paribus</i> it is so whether he, or some
friend or enemy of his, does it to another; <i>or</i> another does it
to him, or to some friend or enemy of his. This impartiality has
nothing to do with the question whether the agent and he to whom the
act is done belong to the same or different families, tribes, nations,
or other social groups. If it is considered wrong of a person to cheat
another belonging to his own group but not wrong to cheat a foreigner,
the impartiality of the moral emotion of disapproval, which underlies
the concept of wrongness, merely leads to a general rule that applies
to all similar cases independently of the nationality of him who holds
the view. If I maintain that a foreigner, or a member of another class
in my own society, has a duty towards me but that I have not the same
duty towards him, my opinion can be justified only on condition that
there is some difference in the circumstances affecting the morality
of the case. People are certainly only too prone to assume that there
are such differences. When they attribute different rights to
different individuals, or classes of individuals, they are often in
reality influenced by the relationship in which they stand to them;
and reflection may be needed to decide whether the assumed
impartiality of their moral judgment is real or illusory. Indeed, some
degree of reasoning, however small, may always be needed in order to
know whether a retributive emotion is felt impartially. I can quite
subscribe to Dr. Rashdall&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;it is only so
far as he is a rational being that any one is capable of impartially
judging between the claims of one man and those of
another&mdash;whether that other be himself or a third
person.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_34" href="#Notech7_34"><span
class="sp">34</span></a> But it seems to me to be a sheer illusion to
maintain that reason requires of us an impartiality in our conduct
which makes no difference between one <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page207"></a>207</span>man and another or one sentient being and
another&mdash;Sidgwick, as we have seen, found no rational ground for
restricting our impartiality to mankind alone.<a id="Anchornotech7_35"
href="#Notech7_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> I cannot find it
unreasonable to endeavour to promote the welfare of my own family or
country in preference to that of other families or countries. But my
moral emotions tell me that I must allow anybody else to show a
similar preference for <i>his</i> family or country.</p>

<p>I think that the question, why moral rules should differ because
the persons to whom they refer are members of different social groups,
would hardly arise unless there were a correspondingly broad
altruistic sentiment behind it. Whatever part reflection may have
played in the expansion of the moral rules&mdash;prudence has also, no
doubt, had something to do with the matter&mdash;it seems to me
obvious that the dominant cause has been the widening of the
altruistic sentiment. Beyond its limits the equalization of duties in
our moral consciousness cannot go, whatever theorists may have to say
on the subject; and the varying strength of this sentiment with regard
to its objects will always prevent the rules from being anything like
uniform and always make their equalization extremely incomplete. It is
after all a very limited number of duties that have been included in
the process of expansion. The duties that men owe to some smaller
groups have never been, and will never be, absorbed by the duties they
owe to mankind at large; and it is a mere theoretical postulate that
our concentration of altruistic behaviour upon a smaller circle of men
is only justified as the most efficient means of promoting the good of
all. Somebody has said that the right kind of patriotism is to do good
to one&rsquo;s own country without doing harm to anybody else&rsquo;s
country; and it is certainly a fact that the universal duties <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page208"></a>208</span>reached by the extension
of moral rules are nearly all such as are expressed by so-called
negative commandments.</p>

<p>The variations of the altruistic sentiment in range and strength
are also responsible for other differences of moral opinion. Even
among ourselves there is no unanimity as to the dictates of duty in
cases where a person&rsquo;s own interests collide with those of his
fellow-men. I have previously discussed the utilitarian view,
formulated in Sidgwick&rsquo;s axiom of &ldquo;rational
benevolence,&rdquo; that, other things being equal, no one must prefer
his own lesser good to the greater good of another.<a
id="Anchornotech7_36" href="#Notech7_36"><span
class="sp">36</span></a> He admits himself that this principle is more
rigid than the view of common sense; but, as I pointed out, the
diversity of opinion on this point is considerably greater than he
appears to have realized. I fail to see that any process of reasoning
or any &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; could ever harmonize the different
views. As HÃ¶ffding said, no reasoning can change an egoist into a
utilitarian; his position is so far unassailable.<a
id="Anchornotech7_37" href="#Notech7_37"><span
class="sp">37</span></a> Kant tried to demonstrate the inconsistency
of egoism by arguing that the very selfishness of men must make them
wish to act altruistically: a will which resolved that each should be
left to take care of himself without the assistance of others would
contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might occur in which one
would have need of the sympathy of others, and in which, by such a law
sprung from his own will he would deprive himself of all hope of the
aid he desires.<a id="Anchornotech7_38" href="#Notech7_38"><span
class="sp">38</span></a> But whatever else may be said of this much
<span class="correction" title="amended from
'critized'">criticized</span> argument, it could not possibly be used
to prove that we are morally bound to regard the happiness of other
individuals as much as we regard our own; nor is there anything else
to show that this high priest of ethical rationalism would have
assented to the utilitarian <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page209"></a>209</span>demand that I am not allowed to prefer my
own lesser happiness to the greater happiness of another man.<a
id="Anchornotech7_39" href="#Notech7_39"><span
class="sp">39</span></a> In some men the altruistic sentiment is
stronger than in others and, consequently, more apt to influence their
consciences with regard to their own conduct and their judgments on
other people&rsquo;s conduct. And while everybody will no doubt agree
that some amount of self-sacrifice is a duty in certain circumstances,
the amount and the circumstances can hardly be fixed in general rules,
and on the whole, in cases of conflicting interests the judgment must
to a large extent remain a matter of private opinion.</p>

<p>There is further the variety of moral opinion relating to
men&rsquo;s conduct towards the lower animals. Among savage peoples,
the Eastern nations, and the ancient Greeks and Romans, we find rules
inculcating regardful or kind behaviour towards them, which are due
partly to cognitive causes, especially religious or superstitious
ideas, and partly to kindly feelings;<a id="Anchornotech7_40"
href="#Notech7_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> the altruistic
sentiment has not necessarily reference to members of the same species
only&mdash;of this we have instances even among animals in confinement
and domesticated animals, which frequently become attached to
individuals of a different species with whom they live together.<a
id="Anchornotech7_41" href="#Notech7_41"><span
class="sp">41</span></a> In the Old Testament, on the other hand, we
meet with an attitude which fundamentally differs from that of other
Eastern religions: man is the centre of creation, for whose sake all
other sentient creatures were brought into existence, and they are
given over to his supreme and irresponsible control without the
slightest injunction of kindness or the faintest suggestion of any
duties towards them. Among the Hebrews the harshness of this
anthropocentric doctrine was somewhat mitigated by the sympathy which
a simple pastoral and agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page210"></a>210</span> people naturally feels for its domestic
animals; whereas in Christianity it was further strengthened by the
exclusive importance that was attached to the spiritual salvation of
man. He was now more than ever separated from the rest of sentient
beings; even his own animal nature was regarded with contempt. St.
Paul asks with scorn, &ldquo;Doth God take care for oxen?&rdquo; No
creed in Christendom teaches kindness to animals as a dogma of
religion, nor is there any such allusion in most treatises on ethics
which base their teachings upon distinctly Christian tenets. The
kindest words, I think, which from a Christian point of view have been
said about animals have generally come from Protestant sectarians,
Quakers and Methodists, whereas Roman Catholic writers&mdash;with a
few exceptions,&mdash;when they deal with the subject at all, chiefly
take pains to show that abstinence from wanton cruelty is a duty not
to the animal but to man. This view was shared by Kant<a
id="Anchornotech7_42" href="#Notech7_42"><span
class="sp">42</span></a> and many later philosophers.<a
id="Anchornotech7_43" href="#Notech7_43"><span
class="sp">43</span></a> So also the legal protection of animals has
often been vindicated on the ground that cruelty to animals might
breed cruelty to men or shows a cruel disposition of mind, or that it
wounds the sensibilities of other people.</p>

<p>Indifference to animal suffering has been a characteristic of
public opinion in European countries up to quite modern times. In 1798
Thomas Young declared in his <i>Essay on Humanity to Animals</i> that
he was sensible of laying himself open to no small portion of ridicule
in offering to the public a book on such a subject.<a
id="Anchornotech7_44" href="#Notech7_44"><span
class="sp">44</span></a> Till the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page211"></a>211</span> end of the eighteenth century and even
later cock-fighting was a very general amusement among the English and
Scotch, entering into the occupations of both the old and young. Other
pastimes indulged in were dog-fighting, bull-baiting, and
badger-baiting; and in the middle of the eighteenth century Lord Kames
described the bear-garden as one of the chief entertainments of the
English, though it was held in abhorrence by the French and
&ldquo;other polite nations,&rdquo; being too savage an amusement to
be relished by those of a refined taste.<a id="Anchornotech7_45"
href="#Notech7_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> As late as 1824 Sir
Robert (then Mr.) Peel argued strongly against the legal prohibition
of bull-baiting.<a id="Anchornotech7_46" href="#Notech7_46"><span

<p>About two years previously, however, humanity to animals had, for
the first time, become a subject of English legislation by the Act
which prevented cruel and improper treatment of cattle. It was
afterwards followed by others prohibiting cruelty to domestic animals
and wild animals in captivity; and subsequently similar laws were made
in most continental countries. In the course of the nineteenth century
humanity to animals, from being conspicuous in a few individuals only,
became the keynote of a movement gradually increasing in strength. It
found philosophical expression in Utilitarianism: Bentham, Mill, and,
I believe, the utilitarian school generally, applied their doctrine to
all beings capable of feeling pleasure and pain.<a

<p>This rapidly increasing sympathy with animal suffering was no doubt
to a considerable extent due to the declining faith in the
anthropocentric doctrine and to the influence of another theory, which
regards man not as separated <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page212"></a>212</span>from the lower animals by a special act of
creation, but as a being generally akin to them and only representing
a higher stage in the scale of mental evolution; the orthodox contempt
for the dumb brutes was superseded by feelings of affinity and kindly
interest. But apart from any theory, growing reflection has also
taught men to be more considerate in their treatment of animals by
producing a more vivid idea of their sufferings. Human thoughtlessness
has been responsible for much needless pain inflicted on them, and in
spite of some improvement it is so still. On the other hand, the
movement advocating greater humanity to animals is itself by no means
free from inconsistencies and lack of discrimination. Take for
instance the present crusade against vivisection, as compared with the
general indifference to the sufferings caused to wild animals in
sport. The vivisector, who in cold blood torments his helpless victim
in the interest of science and for the benefit of mankind is called a
coward, whereas the sportsman who inflicts agonies on the creature he
pursues for sheer amusement escapes all censure and is rather looked
up to. The pursued animal, it is argued, has &ldquo;free chances of
escape.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_48" href="#Notech7_48"><span
class="sp">48</span></a> This is an excellent argument&mdash;provided
we share the North American Indian&rsquo;s conviction that an animal
can never be killed without its own permission.</p>

id="Notech7_48" href="#Anchornotech7_48">48</a></span> F. P. Cobbe,
<i>The Modern Rack. Papers on Vivisection</i> (London, 1889), p.
10.</p></div>

<p>The extreme views about our duties to animals may still be
modified, on one side by a clearer representation of animal suffering
and on the other side by the recognition of certain facts, often
overlooked, which make it unreasonable to regard conduct towards dumb
creatures in exactly the same light as conduct towards men. Apart from
the difference in grades of sentience, it should be <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page213"></a>213</span>remembered that animals
have none of those long-protracted anticipations of future misery or
death which we have.<a id="Anchornotech7_49" href="#Notech7_49"><span
class="sp">49</span></a> If they are destined to serve as meat they
are not aware of it; and many domestic animals would never have come
into existence and been able to enjoy what appears a very happy life,
but for the purpose of being used as food. Yet though greater
intellectual discrimination may lessen the divergencies of moral
opinion on the subject, nothing like unanimity may be expected, for
the simple reason that humanity to animals is ultimately based on the
altruistic sentiment, and sympathy with the animal world is a feeling
which varies greatly in different individuals. The utilitarian
proposition that it is our duty to aim at the good <i>universal</i>,
interpreted and defined as &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; or
&ldquo;pleasure,&rdquo; certainly makes it &ldquo;arbitrary and
unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of
any sentient being&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech7_50"
href="#Notech7_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> but that proposition
could never have been made if there had been no tendency to sympathize
with the feelings of animals. And even if it be universally admitted
that we ought to pay <i>some</i> regard to their feelings, it is
impossible to suppose that the same could ever be the case with the
claim that they should be regarded equally with the feelings of
men.</p>

<p>To ethical writers who believe in the objective validity of moral
judgments moral evolution implies a progressive discovery of values as
a matter of reflection or thought, which follows in the wake of
experience. They are fond of arguing that the changes of moral opinion
are on a par with the discoveries made in mathematics, physics, and
other sciences, which have been disputed quite as <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page214"></a>214</span>fiercely as any
differences of moral valuation.<a id="Anchornotech7_51"
href="#Notech7_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> &ldquo;Moral
principles,&rdquo; says Locke, &ldquo;require reasoning and discourse,
and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their
truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraven on the mind;
which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and
by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no
derogation to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the
truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to
two right ones, because it is not so evident as, &lsquo;the whole is
bigger than a part,&rsquo; nor so apt to be assented to at first
hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of
demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a
certain knowledge of them.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_52"
href="#Notech7_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> We are reminded of
the fact that &ldquo;in the physical region the existence of divergent
ideas does not throw doubt upon the existence of a reality independent
of our ideas,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_53" href="#Notech7_53"><span
class="sp">53</span></a> and that in speculative philosophy, history,
social science, politics, where opinions differ still more widely,
&ldquo;nobody seriously doubts that there is a truth to be found, and
that it is discoverable by a proper use of the intellectual faculties
which we possess.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_54"
href="#Notech7_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> Professor Sorley
remarks that the progress of moral ideas shows <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page215"></a>215</span> no greater
transformation than the theories of science, which at one time seemed
firmly established but &ldquo;have given place to other theories which
include a wider sweep, and a better understanding of each portion, of
experience.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_55" href="#Notech7_55"><span
class="sp">55</span></a> Some earlier writers have gone much farther.
Buckle wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;There is, unquestionably, nothing to be
found in the world which has undergone so little change as those great
dogmas of which moral systems are composed.&hellip; If we contrast
this stationary aspect of moral truths with the progressive aspect of
intellectual truths, the difference is indeed startling.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech7_56" href="#Notech7_56"><span
class="sp">56</span></a> According to Mackintosh, &ldquo;morality
admits no discoveries.&hellip; The facts which lead to the formation
of moral rules are as accessible, and must be as obvious, to the
simplest barbarian, as to the most enlightened philosopher.&hellip;
The case of the physical and speculative sciences is directly
opposite.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_57" href="#Notech7_57"><span
class="sp">57</span></a> In spite of their obvious exaggerations, I
think there is this much truth in these statements that the changes of
moral ideas appear small when compared with the enormous progress in
knowledge our race has made on its path from savagery to modern
civilization. And the reason for this is that while intellectual
evolution has been a perpetual succession of new discoveries, the
changes of moral ideas have been no discoveries at all, but only been
due to more or less varying reactions of the moral emotions.</p>

<p>But while the objectivists cannot be accused of exaggerating the
changes in our theoretical knowledge as compared with those in moral
opinion, they have failed to see that the causes of these changes are
in a large measure fundamentally different. The theoretical
differences can be removed by sufficient observation and reflection,
owing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216"></a>216</span>to the
general uniformity of our sense-perceptions and intellect. It has been
said that &ldquo;the moral convictions of thoughtful and well-educated
people are the data of ethics just as sense-perceptions are the data
of a natural science. Just as some of the latter have to be rejected
as illusory, so have some of the former; but as the latter are
rejected only when they are in conflict with other more accurate
sense-perceptions, the former are rejected only when they are in
conflict with other convictions which stand better the test of
reflection.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_58" href="#Notech7_58"><span
class="sp">58</span></a> But, surely, there is an enormous difference
between the possibility of harmonizing conflicting sense-perceptions
and that of harmonizing conflicting moral convictions. When the
sense-perceptions vary in the presence of the same object, as when the
object looks different under different objective conditions or if the
beholding eye is normal or colour-blind, the variations can be
accounted for by reference to the external conditions or the structure
of the organ, and they in no way affect our conceptions of things as
they really are. So also a hallucination is easily distinguished from
a perception when we learn by experience that its object does not
exist, whereas the perception has an existing object. On the other
hand we all know that there often is a conflict between the moral
convictions of &ldquo;thoughtful and well-educated people,&rdquo; nay,
even between the moral &ldquo;intuitions&rdquo; of philosophers, which
proves irreconcilable. This is just what may be expected if moral
opinions are based on emotions. The moral emotions depend upon
cognitions, but the same cognitions may give rise to emotions that
differ, in quality or intensity, in different persons or in the same
person on different occasions, and then there is nothing that could
make the emotions uniform. Certain cognitions inspire fear into nearly
every breast, but there <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page217"></a>217</span>are brave men and cowards in the world,
independently of the accuracy with which they realize impending
danger. Some cases of suffering can hardly fail to call forth
compassion in the most pitiless heart; but men&rsquo;s disposition to
feel pity varies greatly, both in regard to the beings for whom it is
felt and as to the intensity of the emotion. The same holds true of
the moral emotions. To a large extent, as we have seen, their
differences depend upon the presence of different cognitions, but very
frequently the emotions also differ though the cognitions are the
same. The variations of the former kind do not interfere with the
belief in the universality of moral judgments, but when the variations
of the moral emotions may be traced to different persons&rsquo;
tendencies to feel differently in similar circumstances on account of
the particular nature of their altruistic sentiments, the supposed
universality of moral judgments is a delusion.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be argued that, with sufficient insight into facts,
there would be no diversity of moral opinion if only the moral
consciousness of all men were &ldquo;sufficiently developed&rdquo;;
this in fact was the explanation given by Sidgwick in a conversation
which I had with him on his moral axioms. But what is meant by a
sufficiently developed moral consciousness? Practically, I suppose,
nothing else than agreement with the speaker&rsquo;s own moral
convictions. The expression is faulty and deceptive, because, if
intended to mean anything more, it presupposes a universality of moral
judgments which they do not possess, and at the same time may appear
to prove what it presupposes. We may speak of an intellect
sufficiently developed to grasp a certain truth, because truth is one;
but it is not proved to be one by the fact that it is recognized as
such by a &ldquo;sufficiently&rdquo; developed intellect. The
universality of truth lies in the recognition of judgments <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page218"></a>218</span>as true by all who have
a <i>full</i> knowledge of the facts concerned, and the appeal to a
<i>sufficient</i> knowledge rightly <i>assumes</i> that truth is
universal.</p>

<p>That moral judgments could not possibly possess that universality
which is characteristic of truth becomes particularly obvious when we
consider that their predicates vary not only in quality but in
quantity. There are no degrees of truth and falsehood;<a
id="Anchornotech7_59" href="#Notech7_59"><span
class="sp">59</span></a> but there are degrees of goodness and
badness, virtues and merits may be greater or smaller, a duty may be
more or less stringent, and if there are no degrees of rightness, the
reason for it is that right simply means conformity to the rule of
duty. This difference between truth and moral values has been
expressly recognized even by writers who uphold the objectivity of the
latter, such as Brentano<a id="Anchornotech7_60"
href="#Notech7_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> and Martineau. The
latter writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Good and Evil, in will and character,
cannot be reduced to the True and False; because the latter are
unsusceptible of degrees, which attach to the very essence of the
former.&hellip; Truth has no comparative or superlative: it can never
be less than true, and never more: its existence is its
perfection.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech7_61" href="#Notech7_61"><span

<p>The quantitative differences of moral estimates are plainly due to
the emotional origin of all moral concepts. Emotions vary in intensity
almost indefinitely, and the moral emotions form no exception to this
rule. Indeed, it may be fairly doubted whether the same mode of
conduct ever arouses exactly the same degree of approval or
disapproval in any two individuals. Many of these differences are of
course too slight to manifest themselves in the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page219"></a>219</span>moral judgment; but very
frequently the intensity of the emotion is indicated by some special
word, or by the tone in which the judgment is pronounced. It should be
noticed, however, that the quantity of the estimate expressed in a
moral predicate is not identical with the intensity of the moral
emotion which a certain course of conduct arouses on a particular
occasion. We are liable to feel more indignant if an injury is
committed before our eyes than if we read of it in a newspaper, and
yet we admit that the degree of badness is in both cases the same. The
comparative quantity of moral estimates is determined by the intensity
of the emotions which their objects tend to evoke in exactly similar
circumstances.</p>

<br />THE EMOTIONAL BACKGROUND OF NORMATIVE THEORIES</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="noind"><span class="small">All</span> ethical theories are
based on facts of the moral consciousness. Without such an empirical
foundation none of them could have come into existence and, least of
all, gained any supporters. The normative theories have uniformly
adopted the common sense idea of the objectivity of moral judgments,
which I have tried to prove to be a mistaken interpretation of certain
data of our moral experience. But apart from this idea there must be
in the moral consciousness facts that account for the origin of all
the various theories; and if my view of the emotional basis of moral
judgments is correct, these facts must of course be in agreement with
it. I shall now proceed to a discussion of the psychological
background of normative theories in other points than their claim to
objective validity.</p>

<p>Most ethical theories have recognized that there is some connection
between moral valuation and the production of pleasure or pain; indeed
I think there is none that has completely failed to do so, if not
expressly at least by implication. This is just what must be expected
if all moral valuation ultimately springs from moral emotions and the
moral emotions are by nature retributive, either a kindly attitude of
mind towards a person as a cause of pleasure or a hostile attitude of
mind towards a person as a cause of pain; and I know no other
satisfactory explanation of the connection between moral judgments and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221"></a>221</span>the feelings of
pleasure and pain. This connection is most directly expressed in the
theories of egoistic and universalistic hedonism. The former has been
generally repudiated, the latter very widely accepted. This seems to
indicate that the support which egoistic hedonism derives from the
moral consciousness must be very scanty, and the support which
universalistic hedonism derives from it must be very considerable.</p>

<p>I have previously pointed out that if by egoistic hedonism is meant
the doctrine that it is everybody&rsquo;s <i>duty</i> to seek his own
happiness as the ultimate end of his actions and to treat all other
objects as subservient to this end, it is doubtful whether it may be
found anywhere outside the scope of theological hedonism, and there
only on the understanding that happiness means everlasting happiness
in the world to come. This doctrine, however, may, if its theological
assumptions are accepted, be defended even from the universalistic
point of view, since the total amount of happiness which a man can
produce in this world would be utterly insignificant in comparison
with the infinite reward in store for him hereafter, if he obeys the
law of God, and the tremendous penalty of disobeying it. Moreover, the
doctrine in question may also be styled universalistic hedonism owing
to the assumption that God wishes the happiness of his creatures and
consequently will make men happy or miserable according as they
designedly increase or decrease the happiness of their fellow-men.
Apart from all theological considerations it has been argued, for
example, by Bentham in his <i>Deontology</i>, that a man best promotes
his own happiness by promoting the general happiness. But in this
untenable argument the supposed general effect seems rather to serve
as a justification of egoism than egoism as the moral basis of
universalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page222"></a>222</span>Most moralists
who are commonly looked upon as egoistic hedonists do not say that it
is a man&rsquo;s <i>duty</i> always to aim at his own happiness.
According to Aristippus, the Cyrenaic, every one desires pleasure and
seeks to avoid pain; this is the case even with infants, nay, with all
living beings.<a id="Anchornotech8_1" href="#Notech8_1"><span
class="sp">1</span></a> All pleasure is of the same kind as a feeling,
independently of the source from which it comes;<a
id="Anchornotech8_2" href="#Notech8_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
and the wise man seeks the pleasure which lies directly in his way,
the pleasure of the moment, without troubling himself about the
future.<a id="Anchornotech8_3" href="#Notech8_3"><span

<p>According to a later doctrine of egoism, the one set <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page223"></a>223</span>forth by Mandeville,
that which we call virtue is merely selfishness masquerading. All
untaught animals are only solicitous of pleasing themselves. The chief
thing, therefore, that legislators and politicians were intent upon
was to try to make the people they were to govern believe that it was
most beneficial for everybody to conquer his appetites, to forgo his
own interests, and to pursue those which they themselves had in view.
They discovered that flattery was the most powerful instrument for
inducing the people to do so. Virtue was the name given to every
performance by which man, contrary to the impulse of nature,
endeavours to benefit others or to subdue his own passions. &ldquo;The
moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon
pride.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_10" href="#Notech8_10"><span

<p>While the doctrine that it is a man&rsquo;s duty to seek his own
happiness as the ultimate end of his actions is not a characteristic
of all theories that might be comprised under the heading
&ldquo;egoistic hedonism,&rdquo; it is very widely <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page224"></a>224</span>held outside the limits
of any theory that may be called by this name, that it is a
man&rsquo;s duty in many cases and many ways to look after his own
interests. According to current ideas men owe to themselves a variety
of duties resembling those they owe to their fellow-men. They are
forbidden to take their own lives, they are in some measure considered
to be under an obligation to support their existence, to take care of
their bodies, to preserve their personal freedom, not to waste their
property, to exhibit self-respect, and in general to promote their own
happiness or welfare. And closely related to these self-regarding
duties there are self-regarding virtues, such as diligence, thrift,
temperance. But the duties which we are considered to owe to ourselves
are generally much less emphasized than those we are considered to owe
to others, and a prudential virtue does not receive the same praise as
one springing from a desire to promote the welfare of a fellow-man.
Many moralists even maintain that, properly speaking, there are no
self-regarding duties and virtues at all; that useful action which is
useful to ourselves alone is no matter for moral notice; that in every
case duties towards oneself may be reduced to duties towards others;
that intemperance and extravagant luxury, for instance, are blamable
only because they tend to the public detriment, and that prudence is a
virtue only in so far as it is employed in promoting public
interest.<a id="Anchornotech8_13" href="#Notech8_13"><span

<p>It is true that any kind of conduct which in a considerable degree
immediately affects a person&rsquo;s own welfare is at the same time
apt to affect, to some extent, the well-being of other individuals,
and that the moral ideas concerning such conduct as is called
self-regarding are more or less influenced by considerations as to its
bearing upon others. But this is certainly not the only factor that
determines the judgment passed on it. There are circumstances which
give rise to moral judgments with direct reference to the effect a
person&rsquo;s behaviour has on his own well-being. In the education
of children various courses of self-regarding conduct are strenuously
insisted upon by parents and teachers. What they censure or punish is
regarded as wrong, what they praise or reward is regarded as good;
for, as we have noticed before, men have a tendency to sympathize with
the retributive emotions of persons for whom they feel regard.<a
id="Anchornotech8_16" href="#Notech8_16"><span
class="sp">16</span></a> Moreover, in cases of self-inflicted harm the
injury committed may excite sympathetic resentment towards the agent,
although the victim is his own self. Plato asks in his <i>Laws</i>,
&ldquo;What ought he to suffer who murders his nearest and so-called
dearest friend? I mean, he who kills himself.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech8_17" href="#Notech8_17"><span
class="sp">17</span></a> And the same point of view is conspicuous in
St. Augustine&rsquo;s argument, that the more innocent the
self-murderer was before he committed his deed the greater is his
guilt in taking his life<a id="Anchornotech8_18"
href="#Notech8_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a>&mdash;an argument of
particular force in connection <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page226"></a>226</span>with a theology which condemns suicides to
everlasting torments, and regards it as a man&rsquo;s first duty to
save his soul. It should also be noticed that disinterested likes or
dislikes lead to moral approval or disapproval of conduct which is
essentially self-regarding. But at the same time it is not difficult
to see why self-regarding duties and virtues only occupy a subordinate
place in our moral consciousness. The influence which self-regarding
conduct exercises upon other persons&rsquo; welfare is mostly too
remote to attract attention. In education there is no need to
emphasize any other self-regarding duties and virtues but those which,
for the sake of the individual&rsquo;s general welfare, require some
sacrifice of his immediate pleasure or comfort. The compassion we are
apt to feel for the victim of an injury is naturally much lessened by
the fact that it is self-inflicted&mdash;it is his own fault. And, on
the other hand, indignation against the offender is disarmed by the
fact that he has got his punishment.</p>

<p>I have now spoken of self-regarding conduct that does not
perceptibly interfere with the interests of other individuals.
Sometimes it is looked upon as a duty, sometimes as praiseworthy, but
in the large majority of cases it is treated with moral indifference,
whatever theorists may have to say about it.<a id="Anchornotech8_19"
href="#Notech8_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> It becomes a matter
of acute moral concern mainly when it affects other individuals&rsquo;
well-being, and then a problem may arise which the agent finds very
difficult to solve. The conflict is not generally between what he may
consider to be a duty to himself and what he may consider to be a duty
to others, but between his right to promote his own well-being and his
duty to respect the right of somebody else. Universalistic hedonism or
utilitarianism has laid down the rule that it is a duty for each
person to aim at the greatest amount <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page227"></a>227</span>of happiness on the whole, taking into
account all whose happiness is affected by the conduct and at his own
happiness as an element of the whole. It has, from the point of view
of common sense, greatly exaggerated the <i>duty</i> of promoting
one&rsquo;s own happiness by putting it on a par with the duty of
promoting the happiness of others. Who would really consider it a duty
for a person to seek his own happiness in every case where it implies
a sacrifice of the lesser happiness of another? Who would consider it
to be in the same degree my duty to refrain from doing harm to myself
as to refrain from doing the same amount of harm to another, for
instance, to avoid causing an economic loss to myself as to avoid
causing a similar loss to another? At the same time, I may, according
to current moral ideas, have a <i>right</i> to seek my own happiness
in many cases where it involves a lessening of some other
person&rsquo;s happiness, even though I could claim no
counterbalancing gain to anybody else as an excuse for my action.<a
id="Anchornotech8_20" href="#Notech8_20"><span
class="sp">20</span></a> Utilitarianism, on the other hand, requires
the sacrifice of the agent&rsquo;s private interests where they are
incompatible with the greatest happiness of the greatest number. And
it also requires that the happiness of every other individual should
be considered as much as that of any one else, unless there are
special grounds for believing that a greater amount of happiness is
likely to be realized in the one case than in the other.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the origin of utilitarianism may be traced to
the nature of the moral emotions. In the first place, as we have seen,
they are retributive emotions, moral approval being a kindly attitude
of mind towards a cause of pleasure and moral disapproval a hostile
attitude of mind towards a cause of pain: we approve a person who
causes pleasure and condemn one who causes <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page228"></a>228</span>pain. Thus our moral emotions are produced
by exactly the same facts, the giving of pleasure and the infliction
of pain, as utilitarianism considers the criteria of moral and immoral
conduct. In the second place, moral approval and disapproval, in
distinction from other retributive emotions, such as gratitude and
anger, are disinterested, in the strict sense of the term, and
apparently impartial; in other words, they are felt independently of
any reference that the conduct causing them may have to the interests
of those who feel them, and are also assumed by these persons to be
uninfluenced by the particular relationship in which they stand both
to those who are immediately affected by the acts in question and to
those who perform them. But these essential characteristics of the
moral emotions do not lead, for reasons already indicated, to the
exaggerated ideas expressed in the utilitarian formula as to the duty
of promoting one&rsquo;s own happiness; nor are they, on the other
hand, sufficient to explain either its reduction of a person&rsquo;s
rights when his interests conflict with those of others, or its
requirement that the happiness of every other individual shall be
considered as much as that of any one else. The disinterestedness of
the moral emotions cannot admit that one person has a right to promote
his own happiness in circumstances where another similar person has no
such right; but it is not opposed to the rule that every similar
person may in similar circumstances seek his own happiness on an
occasion when it involves a decrease of happiness on the whole. So
also the impartiality of the moral emotions does not allow a person to
treat another differently from any one else on account of the
particular relationship in which he stands to him personally, unless
every similar person is admitted to have a similar right in similar
circumstances. It does not prevent us from paying greater attention to
the interests<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229"></a>229</span> of
our own family or nation than to the interests of other families or
nations, quite apart from its effect on happiness as a whole. The
utilitarian formula is not a mere expression of the disinterestedness
and impartiality of the moral emotions, and cannot therefore be
regarded as anything like a moral axiom: its universalism, as I have
said before, is undoubtedly closely connected with a corresponding
expansion of the altruistic sentiment. This sentiment is an important
cause of the moral emotions, but its scope may vary indefinitely
without affecting their essential nature, and may consequently give
rise to very different moral judgments; and if extended to the whole
sentient creation, universalistic hedonism may be the result. These
facts, in addition to the specific nature of the moral emotions, help
us to understand the great popularity of utilitarianism in a world
imbued with the ethics of the New Testament. As Stuart Mill pointed
out, &ldquo;to do as one would be done by, and to love one&rsquo;s
neighbour as oneself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian
morality.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_21" href="#Notech8_21"><span

<i>Utilitarianism</i> (London, 1895), p. 24 <i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>Though widely accepted, especially by earlier generations,
utilitarianism has been subjected to much criticism. It has been
argued that it is impossible to foresee all the hedonic consequences
of one&rsquo;s own or any other person&rsquo;s conduct in a certain
case; that different people often feel differently in the same
circumstances, that one man&rsquo;s feelings cannot, therefore, be
estimated and dealt with as if they were identical with another
man&rsquo;s feelings, and that it is impossible to know the
differences between them; that neither pleasure nor pain admit of a
rigid application of the rules of arithmetic and algebra; and so
forth. Much of this criticism has no bearing upon the question I am
now discussing, but a few remarks, besides those <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page230"></a>230</span>already made, are
appropriate in the present connection.</p>

<p>The first and most fundamental assumption involved in the very
conception of &ldquo;greatest happiness&rdquo; as an end of action is
the commensurability of pleasures and pains. The pleasures sought and
the pains shunned are assumed to have determinate quantitative
relations to each other, since otherwise they cannot be conceived as
possible elements of a total of which we are to seek the maximum, and
in the comparison and balancing between them pain is reckoned as the
negative quality of pleasure. It is strange, however, that the
expounders of utilitarianism, who have taken so much trouble to
vindicate the psychological commensurability of pleasures and pains
should have failed to notice that they are far from commensurable in
the moral valuation of conduct. There the production of a certain
amount of pain is not <i>eo ipso</i> counterbalanced by what may be
psychologically regarded as an equal, nay, a greater amount of
pleasure; not even a cock-fight is nowadays considered justified by
the amusement it gives to any number of people. The large majority of
duties enjoin abstinence from the infliction of pain, or alleviation
or prevention of pain, and these are practically the only duties to
fellow-creatures that the customs and laws of all peoples insist upon.
To promote the positive happiness of others is mostly looked upon as
laudable, not as a duty. This is not in agreement with the utilitarian
view that &ldquo;it is always wrong for a man knowingly to do anything
other than what he believes to be most conducive to universal
happiness&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech8_22" href="#Notech8_22"><span
class="sp">22</span></a> but it is in perfect agreement with my theory
of the emotional origin of moral judgments. The hostile attitude of
mind towards a cause of pain is a much more frequent and a much
stronger emotion than the kindly attitude of mind towards a cause of
pleasure, and the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page231"></a>231</span>altruistic sentiment, which plays such an
important part in the formation of moral resentment and moral
retributive kindly emotion, is much more readily moved by the sight of
pain than by the sight of pleasure. Indeed, the latter emotion has
powerful rivals in the feelings of jealousy and envy, which may even
excite anger against him who bestows the benefit upon the other
individual.<a id="Anchornotech8_23" href="#Notech8_23"><span
class="sp">23</span></a> The author of the utilitarian formula
&ldquo;the greatest happiness of the greatest number&rdquo; laid all
stress on positive happiness, which he looked upon as &ldquo;far
superior to misery, even in this world.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_24"
href="#Notech8_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> But we may rather
second Dr. Goldscheid&rsquo;s proposition that the chief moral
criterion is &ldquo;the smallest pain of the smallest number.&rdquo;<a

<p>Utilitarianism would, of course, be utterly incompatible with the
morality of common sense if it taught that we are to determine the
morality of a particular mode of conduct by computing its probable
effects in each individual case. Such a doctrine would be as absurd as
to maintain, on the principle I am advocating, that the moral
judgments depend upon the emotions felt by persons at the moment they
pronounce them. Those judgments are largely expressions of tendencies
in certain classes of conduct to arouse moral emotions; to say of a
theft that it is wrong implies that an act of this kind has a tendency
to call forth moral disapproval. So also a utilitarian does not hold
that it is wrong because it in this particular case produces more pain
than pleasure; it is not at all certain that it really does so. But he
insists on the necessity of acting according to general rules instead
of attempting to show that we may calculate the consequences in each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232"></a>232</span>special case. Dr.
Albee believes that no utilitarian but Bentham in his
<i>Deontology</i>, where the object is to guide the individual agent
in his moral life, has failed to recognize the need of depending upon
such rules; at least there is no passage in that book which points out
their importance, as opposed to particular computations.<a
id="Anchornotech8_26" href="#Notech8_26"><span
class="sp">26</span></a> But at the same time the utilitarian admits
that there are emergencies in which a general rule may be
transgressed; as in a case of special need&mdash;&ldquo;necessity
knows no law,&rdquo;&mdash;or when the general utility of
truth-speaking is outweighed by particular, bad consequences, or when
the keeping of a promise ceases to be a duty if it has been procured
by fraud or unlawful violence, or if the performance of it would be
injurious to the promisee.<a id="Anchornotech8_27"
href="#Notech8_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> This, too, is in
full agreement with the emotional theory of moral judgments and has
the support of common sense. But I want to emphasize that the
relaxation of general rules in individual cases serves the object, not
of increasing pleasure, but of diminishing pain&mdash;unless we
consider as such a case like the telling of harmless stories to
children in order to amuse them.</p>

<p>It has been contended that utilitarianism cannot adequately account
for certain duties, such as justice, veracity, and chastity. So far as
criminal justice is concerned I agree: I have previously tried to show
that those theorists who think it possible to base punishment on
utilitarian considerations alone, independently of the emotion of
moral resentment, are victims of an illusion.<a id="Anchornotech8_28"
href="#Notech8_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> As for veracity,
there is also some truth in the imputation.</p>

<p>In a large measure this duty undoubtedly has a utilitarian
foundation: he who tells a lie generally commits an <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page233"></a>233</span> injury against another
person; his act consequently calls forth sympathetic resentment, and
becomes an object of moral censure. Men have a natural disposition to
believe what they are told, but they also like to know the truth;
curiosity is displayed even by many of the higher animals. In our
endeavour to learn the truth we are frustrated by him who deceives us,
and he becomes an object of our resentment. Nor are we injured by a
deception merely because we like to know the truth, but, chiefly,
because it is of much importance for us that we should know it. Our
conduct is influenced by ideas; hence the erroneous notion as regards
some fact in the past, present, or future, which is produced by a lie,
may lead to unforeseen events detrimental to our interests. Moreover,
on discovering that we have been deceived, we have the humiliating
feeling that another person has impertinently made our conduct subject
to his will. This is a wound on our pride, a blot on our honour.
&ldquo;The lie,&rdquo; says Sainte-Palaye, &ldquo;has always been
considered the most fatal and irreparable affront that a man of honour
could receive.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_29" href="#Notech8_29"><span
class="sp">29</span></a> How largely the condemnation of falsehood is
due to the harm suffered by the victim appears from the fact that a
lie is held more condemnable in proportion to the magnitude of the
harm caused by it. But even in apparently trifling cases the
reflective mind insists upon the necessity of truthfulness. Every lie
may have a tendency to lessen mutual confidence, to predispose the
perpetrator to commit a similar offence in the future, and to serve as
a bad example for others.<a id="Anchornotech8_30"
href="#Notech8_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> Contrariwise, as
Aristotle observes, he who is truthful in unimportant matters will be
all the more so in important ones.<a id="Anchornotech8_31"
href="#Notech8_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> Similar
considerations, however,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page234"></a>234</span> require a certain amount of reflection and
far-sightedness; hence intellectual development tends to increase the
emphasis laid on the duty of veracity. At the earlier stages of
civilization it is frequently considered good form to tell an untruth
to a person in order to please him, and ill-mannered to contradict
him, however much he be mistaken, for the reason that farther
consequences are left out of account. The utilitarian basis of the
duty of truthfulness also accounts for those extreme cases in which
deception is held permissible or even a duty, either in self-defence
or when promoting the true interests of the person deceived.</p>

<p>But untruthfulness is not merely condemned on utilitarian grounds,
on account of the harm it is apt to cause: it is an object of
disinterested, moral resentment also because it is intrinsically
antipathetic. Lying is a cheap and cowardly method of gaining an undue
advantage, and is consequently despised where courage is respected. It
is the weapon of the weak, the woman, and the slave. Fraud, says
Cicero, is the property of a fox, force that of a lion; &ldquo;both

detestable.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_32" href="#Notech8_32"><span

<p>The duty of chastity is a more complicated matter. I shall first
discuss moral ideas concerning sexual relations between men and women
falling outside the recognized marriage institution. Among many
uncivilized peoples both sexes enjoy perfect freedom previous to
marriage; but it seems that those who look upon unchastity in a girl
as a disgrace or punish it as a crime are, roughly speaking, as
numerous as those who condone it, and among the former the man who
seduced her is also censured or punished. Among the simpler peoples
the standard of pre-nuptial chastity in a tribe is not proportionate
to its degree of culture, but it appears, on the contrary, that in the
lowest tribes chastity is more respected than in the higher ones.
Where free intercourse prevails between unmarried people, sexual
connections between a boy and a girl are a frequent preliminary to
their marriage, and may be a regular method of courtship or a trial
before establishing more permanent relations; and if they lead to
pregnancy or the birth of a child they often make marriage
compulsory.<a id="Anchornotech8_37" href="#Notech8_37"><span
class="sp">37</span></a> Passing to more advanced races, we find that
chastity is regarded as a duty for unmarried women, whilst a
different<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236"></a>236</span> standard
of morality is generally applied to men.<a id="Anchornotech8_38"
href="#Notech8_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a>
&ldquo;Confucianism,&rdquo; says Mr. Griffis, &ldquo;virtually admits
two standards of morality, one for man, another for woman.&hellip;
Chastity is a female virtue, it is a part of womanly duty, it has
little or no relation to man personally.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech8_39" href="#Notech8_39"><span
class="sp">39</span></a> Yet it is said that in youth, when the
physical powers are not yet settled, the superior man guards against
lust.<a id="Anchornotech8_40" href="#Notech8_40"><span
class="sp">40</span></a> Among the ancient Hebrews fornication was
forbidden to women<a id="Anchornotech8_41" href="#Notech8_41"><span
class="sp">41</span></a> but not to men. The action of Judah towards
the supposed harlot on the way to Timnath is mentioned as the most
natural thing in the world,<a id="Anchornotech8_42"
href="#Notech8_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> even though the
perpetrator was a man whom his brethren &ldquo;shall praise&rdquo; and
before whom his &ldquo;father&rsquo;s children shall bow
down.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_43" href="#Notech8_43"><span
class="sp">43</span></a> Throughout the Mohammedan world chastity is
regarded as a stringent duty in the case of a woman, for the breach of
which she has often to pay with her life, whereas in the case of a man
it is at most held as an ideal, almost out of reach. Among the Hindus
sexual impurity is scarcely considered a sin in the men, but in women
nothing is held more execrable or abominable. In one of the Pahlavi
texts continence is recommended from the point of view of prudence:
&ldquo;Commit no lustfulness, so that harm and regret may not reach
thee from thine own actions.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_44"
href="#Notech8_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> But in
Zoroastrianism, also, chastity is chiefly a female duty. Among the
ancient Teutons an unmarried woman who belonged to an honourable
family was severely punished for incontinence, and the seducer was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237"></a>237</span>exposed to the
revenge of her family, or had to pay compensation for his deed. In
Greece the chastity of an unmarried girl was anxiously guarded, and
according to Athenian law the relatives of a maiden who had lost her
virtue could with impunity kill the seducer on the spot. It is true
that a certain class of courtesans occupied a remarkably high position
in the social life of Greece, being admired and sought after even by
the principal men; but they did so on account of their extraordinary
beauty or their intellectual superiority. The Romans, on the other
hand, regarded the courtesan class with much contempt. But both in
Greece and Rome pre-nuptial unchastity in men, when it was not
excessive<a id="Anchornotech8_45" href="#Notech8_45"><span
class="sp">45</span></a> or did not take some especially offensive
form, was hardly censured by public opinion. The elder Cato expressly
justified it;<a id="Anchornotech8_46" href="#Notech8_46"><span
class="sp">46</span></a> and Cicero says that &ldquo;if there be any
one who thinks that youth is to be wholly interdicted from amours with
courtesans, he certainly is very strict indeed.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech8_47" href="#Notech8_47"><span
class="sp">47</span></a> A few other writers, however, were more
exacting.<a id="Anchornotech8_48" href="#Notech8_48"><span
class="sp">48</span></a> Such opinions grew up especially in
connection with the Neo-Platonic and Neo-Pythagorean philosophies, and
may be traced back to the ancient masters themselves. We are told that
Pythagoras inculcated the virtue of chastity so successfully that when
ten of his disciples, being attacked, might have escaped by crossing a
bean-field, they died to a man rather than tread down the beans, which
were supposed to have a mystic affinity with the seat of impure
desires.<a id="Anchornotech8_49" href="#Notech8_49"><span
class="sp">49</span></a> Plato, again, is in favour of a law to the
effect that &ldquo;no one <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page238"></a>238</span>shall venture to touch any person of the
freeborn or noble class except his wedded wife, or in barren and
unnatural lusts.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_50"

<p>Much stronger was the censure which Christianity passed on
pre-nuptial connections. While looking with suspicion even on the
life-long union of one man with one woman, the Church pronounced all
other forms of sexual intercourse to be mortal sins. In the
Penitentials sins of unchastity were the favourite topic; and the
horror of them finds an echo in the secular legislation of the first
Christian emperors. Even the innocent offspring of illicit intercourse
were punished for their parents&rsquo; sins with ignominy and loss of
certain rights which belonged to other, more respectable, members of
the Church and the State. Persons of different sex who were not united
in wedlock were forbidden by the Church to kiss each other; nay, the
sexual desire itself, though unaccompanied by any external act, was
regarded as sinful in the unmarried.<a id="Anchornotech8_51"
href="#Notech8_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> In this standard of
purity no difference of sex was recognized, the same obligation being
imposed upon man and woman.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

<i>sq.</i> For the subject of kissing see also Thomas Aquinas,
<i>Summa theologica</i>, ii.-ii. 154. 4.</p></div>

<p>In this, as in many other points of morals, there has always been a
considerable discrepancy between Christian doctrine and public opinion
in Christian countries. The influence of the ascetic doctrine of the
Church was in one respect quite contrary to its aspirations: the
institution of clerical celibacy created a large class of people to
whom illicit love was the only means of gratifying a natural desire,
and this could hardly be favourable to the ideal of chastity. During
the Middle Ages incontinence was largely an object of ridicule rather
than censure, and in the comic <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page239"></a>239</span>literature of that period the clergy are
represented as the great corrupters of domestic virtue. Whether the
tenet of chastity laid down by the code of Chivalry was taken more
seriously may be fairly doubted. For a mediaeval knight the chief
object of life was love, he who did not understand how to win a lady
was but half a man; and the difference between a lover and a seducer
was apparently slight. The Reformation brought about some change, if
in no other respect at least by making marriage lawful for the clergy.
In fits of religious enthusiasm even the secular legislators busied
themselves with acts of incontinence in which two unmarried adults of
different sex were consenting parties. In the days of the
Commonwealth, in cases of less serious breach of chastity than
adultery and incest, each man or woman was for each offence to be
committed to the common gaol for three months; and in Scotland, after
the Reformation, fornication was punished with a severity nearly equal
to that which attended the infraction of the marriage vow. But the
fate of these and similar laws has been either to be repealed or to
become invalid. For ordinary acts of incontinence public opinion is,
practically at least, the only judge. In the case of female unchastity
its sentence is severe enough among the upper ranks of society, while,
so far as the lower classes are concerned, it varies considerably even
in different parts of the same country, and is in many cases regarded
as venial. As to similar acts committed by unmarried men, the words
which Cicero uttered on behalf of Coelius might be repeated by any
modern advocate who, in defending his client, ventured frankly to
express the popular opinion on the subject. It seems to me that with
regard to sexual relations between unmarried men and women
Christianity has done little more than establish a standard which,
though accepted perhaps in theory, is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page240"></a>240</span>hardly recognized by the feelings of the
large majority of people&mdash;or at least of men&mdash;in Christian
communities, and has introduced the vice of hypocrisy, which
apparently was little known in sexual matters by pagan antiquity.</p>

<p>After this survey of facts, which are of importance for our
discussion, we now come to the main points of it. Why has sexual
intercourse between unmarried people, if both parties consent, come to
be regarded as wrong? Why are the moral opinions relating to it so
variable? Why is the standard commonly so different for man and
woman?</p>

<p>If marriage, as I consider most probable, is based on an instinct,
tending to preserve the next generation and thereby the species, which
has been derived from some apelike progenitor,<a id="Anchornotech8_52"
href="#Notech8_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> it would from the
beginning be regarded as the natural form of sexual intercourse in the
human race, whilst other, more transitory connections would appear
abnormal and consequently be disapproved of. Some feeling of this
sort, however vague, may still be very general in the race. But it has
been more or less or almost totally suppressed by social conditions
which make it impossible for men to marry at the first outbreak of the
sexual passion.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech8_52" href="#Anchornotech8_52">52</a></span> <i>The History
of Human Marriage</i>, i. ch. i.</p></div>

<p>I believe that the censure passed on pre-nuptial connections may be
principally traced to the preference which a man gives to a virgin
bride. This preference, which is probably very ancient, seems to
spring partly from a feeling akin to jealousy towards women who have
had previous connections with other men, and partly from an
instinctive appreciation of female coyness. Each sex is attracted by
the particular characteristics of the other sex, and coyness is a
female quality. In mankind, as among <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page241"></a>241</span>other mammals, the female requires to be
courted, often endeavouring for a long time to escape from the male;
not only in civilized countries may courtship mean a prolonged making
of love to the woman. And it is certainly not the woman who most
readily yields to the desires of a man that is most attractive to him;
as an ancient writer puts it, all men love seasoned dishes, not plain
meats, or plainly dressed fish, and it is modesty that gives the bloom
to beauty.<a id="Anchornotech8_53" href="#Notech8_53"><span
class="sp">53</span></a> Conspicuous eagerness in a woman appears to a
man unwomanly, repulsive, contemptible. His ideal is the virgin; the
lustful woman he despises.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech8_53" href="#Anchornotech8_53">53</a></span> Athenaeus,
<i>Deipnosophistae</i>, xiii. 16.</p></div>

<p>Where marriage is the customary form of sexual intercourse
pre-nuptial incontinence in a woman, as suggesting lack of modesty, is
therefore apt to disgrace her. At the same time it is a disgrace to,
and consequently an offence against, her family, especially where the
ties of kinship are strong. Moreover, where wives are purchased the
unchaste girl, by lowering her market value, deprives her father or
parents of part of their property. This commercial point of view is
found not only among savage peoples, but is expressed in the Mosaic
rule:&mdash;&ldquo;If a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and
lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. If her father
utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to
the dowry of virgins.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_54"
href="#Notech8_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> The girl, however,
is not the only offender: the offence against her family is divided
between her and the seducer, who is regarded in the light of a robber
spoiling their merchandise. Marriage by purchase has thus raised the
standard of female chastity, and also, to some extent, checked the
incontinence of the men. But in numerous instances where a seduction
is followed by more or less serious consequences for the seducer, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242"></a>242</span>penalty he has to
pay is evidently something else than the mere market value of the
girl.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech8_54" href="#Anchornotech8_54">54</a></span> <i>Exodus</i>,
xxii. 16 <i>sq.</i></p></div>


<p>Thus the men, by demanding that the women whom they marry shall be
virgins, indirectly give rise to the demand that they themselves shall
refrain from intercourse with unmarried girls, which is considered
offensive to the families of the latter. To him who duly reflects upon
the matter it is clear that the seducer does a wrong to the woman
also; but I find no indication that this idea occurs to the savage
mind. Where the seducer is censured the girl also is censured, being
regarded not as the injured party but as an accomplice in the crime.
Even in the case of rape the harm done to the girl herself is often
little thought of; and if the girl&rsquo;s feelings are thus
disregarded when she is an unwilling victim of violence, it can hardly
be expected that she should be an object of pity when she is a
consenting partner. Does not public opinion in the midst of
civilization turn against the dishonoured one rather than the
dishonourer?</p>

<p>There is yet another party to be considered, namely, the offspring.
One would imagine that to a thinking mind, not altogether destitute of
sympathetic feelings, the question what is likely to happen to the
child if the woman becomes pregnant should present itself as one of
the greatest gravity. But in judging of matters relating to sexual
morality men have generally made little use of their reason, and been
guilty of much thoughtless cruelty. Although marriage has come into
existence for the sake of the offspring, it rarely happens that in
sexual relations much unselfish thought is bestowed upon unborn
individuals. Legal provisions in favour of illegitimate children have
made men somewhat more careful, for their own sake, but they have also
nourished the idea that the responsibility of fatherhood may be bought
off by the small sum the man <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page243"></a>243</span>has to pay for the support of his natural
child. The law may exempt him even from this duty. &ldquo;La recherche
de la paternitÃ© est interdite.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_55"
href="#Notech8_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a></p>

<p>The great authority on the ethics of Roman Catholicism, Thomas
Aquinas, tries to prove that simple fornication is a mortal sin
chiefly because it &ldquo;tends to the hurt of the life of the child
who is to be born of such intercourse,&rdquo; or more generally,
because &ldquo;it is contrary to the good of the offspring.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech8_56" href="#Notech8_56"><span
class="sp">56</span></a> But this tender care for the welfare of
illegitimate children seems strange when we consider the manner in
which such children have been treated by the Catholic Church herself.
It is obvious that the horror of fornication which is expressed in the
Christian doctrine is in the main a result of the same ascetic
principle that declared celibacy superior to marriage and tolerated
marriage only because it could not be suppressed.</p>

<i>op. cit.</i>, ii.-ii. 154. 2.</p></div>

<p>Moral ideas regarding unchastity have also been influenced by the
close association which exists in a refined mind between the sexual
impulse and a sentiment of affection which lasts long after the
gratification of the bodily desire. We find an outcome of this feeling
in the distinction drawn between the prostitute and the woman who
yields to temptation because she loves. To indulge in mere sexual
pleasure, unaccompanied by higher feelings, appears brutal in a man
and still more so in the case of a woman. After all, love is generally
only an episode in a man&rsquo;s life, whereas for a woman it is often
the whole of her life. The Greek orator said that at the moment when a
woman loses her chastity her mind is changed.<a id="Anchornotech8_57"
href="#Notech8_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> On the other hand,
when a man and a woman, tied to each other <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page244"></a>244</span>by deep and genuine affection, decide to
live together as husband and wife, though not joined in legal wedlock,
the censure which public opinion passes upon their conduct seems to an
unprejudiced mind justifiable at most only in so far as it may be
considered to have been their duty to comply with the laws of their
country and to submit to a rule of some social importance.</p>

<p>Among ourselves an act of incontinence assumes a different aspect
if one of the parties, either the man or the woman, is married.
Involving a breach of faith, adultery is an offence against him or her
to whom faith is due, and at the same time the seducer commits an
offence against the husband of the adulteress. But here again our own
views are not universally shared. Among savage and barbarous tribes it
is obviously the rule that conjugal fidelity, while considered a
stringent duty in the wife, is not generally considered so in the
husband, although there are interesting exceptions to the rule; and
among the peoples of ancient civilization the law requires
faithfulness of the wife alone. Among the Hebrews adultery was a
capital offence, but it presupposed that the guilty woman was another
man&rsquo;s wife.<a id="Anchornotech8_58" href="#Notech8_58"><span
class="sp">58</span></a> The Aryan nations in early times generally
saw nothing objectionable in the unfaithfulness of a married man,
whereas an adulterous wife was punished with the greatest severity.<a
id="Anchornotech8_59" href="#Notech8_59"><span
class="sp">59</span></a> Until some time after the introduction of
Christianity among the Teutons their law-books made no mention of the
infidelity of husbands, because it was permitted by ancient custom.<a
id="Anchornotech8_60" href="#Notech8_60"><span
class="sp">60</span></a> The Romans defined adultery as sexual
intercourse with another man&rsquo;s wife; the intercourse of a
married man with an unmarried<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page245"></a>245</span> woman was not regarded as adultery.<a
id="Anchornotech8_61" href="#Notech8_61"><span
class="sp">61</span></a> The ordinary Greek feeling on the subject is
expressed in the oration against Neaera, ascribed to Demosthenes,
where the license accorded to husbands is spoken of as a matter of
course:&mdash;&ldquo;We keep mistresses for our pleasures, concubines
for constant attendance, and wives to bear us legitimate children and
to be our faithful housekeepers.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_62"
href="#Notech8_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> In classical
literature, however, the idea that fidelity in marriage ought to be
reciprocal is not altogether unknown.<a id="Anchornotech8_63"

<p>In its condemnation of adultery Christianity made no distinction
between husband and wife.<a id="Anchornotech8_64"
href="#Notech8_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> If continence is a
strict duty for unmarried persons independently of their sex, the
observance of the sacred marriage vow must be so in a still higher
degree. But here again there is a considerable discrepancy between the
actual feelings of Christian peoples and the standard of their
religion. Even in their laws relating to divorce and judicial
separation we often find an echo of the popular notion that adultery
is a smaller offence in a husband than in a wife.<a
id="Anchornotech8_65" href="#Notech8_65"><span
class="sp">65</span></a> That a married man enjoys more liberty than a
married woman is largely due to the same causes as make him the more
privileged partner in other respects; but there are also special
reasons for this inequality between the sexes. It was a doctrine of
the Roman jurists that adultery is a crime in the wife, and the wife
only, on account of the danger of introducing strange children to the
husband. Moreover, the temptation of infidelity and the facility in
indulging <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246"></a>246</span>in it
are commonly greater in the case of the husband than in that of the
wife; and actual practice is always apt to influence moral opinion.
And a still more important reason for the inequality is undoubtedly
the general notion that unchastity of any kind is more discreditable
for a woman than for a man.</p>

<i>sq.</i></p></div>

<p>There is one form of unchastity that is universally condemned in
man and woman alike, namely, incest; but in this case the prohibition
is not restricted to non-matrimonial intercourse, it refers in the
first place to marriage itself. Among all peoples there are exogamous
rules, which forbid the members of a particular group to marry any
other member of it. In most cases this group is composed of persons
who are, or consider themselves to be, related by blood or of the same
kin; and the nearer the relationship, the more frequently is it a bar
to intermarriage, at least within the same line of descent. The most
frequent of all exogamous rules are those which prohibit a son from
marrying his mother and a father from marrying his daughter; these
rules seem, in fact, to be universally prevalent in mankind. Hardly
less universal is the rule which forbids marriages between brothers
and sisters who are children of the same father and mother; the best
authenticated exceptions to this rule are generally found in the
families of kings or ruling chiefs, and there can be little doubt that
they are due to the aim of maintaining the purity of the royal blood.
Among peoples unaffected by modern civilization the exogamic rules are
probably in the large majority of cases more extensive than among
ourselves; very often they refer to all the members of the clan, and
the rule that a man may not marry a woman of his own clan is usually
supplemented by a further prohibition of marrying other women who are
nearly related to him.<a id="Anchornotech8_66"
href="#Notech8_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

of Human Marriage</i>, ii. ch. xix.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page247"></a>247</span>Many attempts
have been made to account for the exogamous rules;<a
id="Anchornotech8_67" href="#Notech8_67"><span
class="sp">67</span></a> I doubt whether any other question in the
history of social institutions has given rise to more controversy.
They have been ascribed to a pristine habit of female infanticide; to
the vain desire of savage men to have trophies in their wives; to
experience of the injurious influence of in-breeding (which must have
been made at an earlier stage of human development than that
represented by any living savages, but afterwards forgotten); to
marriage by capture originating in the hypothetical period of
primitive promiscuity; to marriage by purchase; to a superstitious
belief that incest blights the crops, prevents the multiplication of
edible animals, and renders the women of the community sterile; to
totemism; or to the furious jealousy of a gorilla-like ancestor. I
have elsewhere tried to show that the gravest objections may be raised
to each of these theories, and that in addition there are other
objections that may be raised to all of them. They all regard the
exogamous rules as social survivals from very remote ages. They all
suppose that these rules have originated in social conditions which no
longer exist, or in ideas which have been found among a few savages or
which have never been found anywhere. Now, is it really reasonable to
believe that a law like that against incest among ourselves could be
traced to similar sources? The exogamous rules have not remained
unaltered; on the contrary, they differ even among peoples of the same
stock, and we know that in Europe, in the course of a few centuries,
they have been greatly changed in spite of the religious sanction
given them by the Church. This proves that those rules are not dead
fossils, but living parts of the social organism, subject to
modifications according to the circumstances.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech8_67" href="#Anchornotech8_67">67</a></span> <i>Ibid.</i>,
ii. ch. xx.</p></div>

<p>Moreover, the theories in question imply that the home <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page248"></a>248</span>is kept free from
incestuous intercourse by law, custom, or education. But even if
social prohibitions might prevent unions between the nearest
relatives, they could not prevent the desire for such unions. The
sexual instinct can hardly be changed by prescriptions; I doubt
whether all laws against homosexual intercourse, even the most
draconic, have ever been able to extinguish the peculiar desire of
anybody born with homosexual tendencies. Nevertheless, our laws
against incest are scarcely felt as a restraint upon individual
feelings. And the simple reason for this is that in normal cases there
is no desire for the acts which they forbid. Generally speaking, there
is a remarkable absence of erotic feelings between persons living
closely together from childhood; among the lower animals, also, there
are indications that the pairing instinct fails to be stimulated by
companions and seeks strangers for its gratification. Hume committed a
curious psychological error in his utilitarian explanation of the
prohibition of incest when he wrote, &ldquo;Those who live in the same
family have so many opportunities of licenses of this kind, that
nothing could preserve purity of manners, were marriage allow&rsquo;d
amongst the nearest relations, or any intercourse of love betwixt them
ratify&rsquo;d by law and custom.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_68"
href="#Notech8_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> Plato showed a
sharper eye for the problem of incest in his observation that an
unwritten law defends as sufficiently as possible parents from
incestuous intercourse with their children and brothers from
intercourse with their sisters, and that the thought of such a thing
does not enter at all into the minds of most of them.<a

<p>Sexual indifference, however, is not by itself sufficient to
account for exogamous prohibitions. But such indifference<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page249"></a>249</span> is very generally
combined with sexual aversion when the act is thought of; indeed, I
believe that this is normally the case whenever the idea of sexual
intercourse occupies the mind with sufficient intensity and a desire
fails to appear. An old and ugly woman, for instance, would in such
circumstances become sexually repulsive to most men, and to many male
inverts any woman, as an object of sexual desire, is not merely
indifferent but disgusting. And, as I have pointed out above,
aversions which are generally felt readily lead to moral disapproval
and prohibitory customs or laws. This I take to be the fundamental
cause of the exogamous prohibitions. Persons who have been living
closely together from childhood are as a rule near relatives. Hence
their aversion to sexual relations with one another displays itself in
custom and law as a prohibition of intercourse between near kin. This
interpretation of their aversion in terms of kinship is exactly
analogous to another case of equally world-wide occurrence, namely,
the process which has led to the association of all sorts of social
rights and duties with kinship, though ultimately depending upon close
living together. Parental, filial, and fraternal duties and rights,
and those referring to relatives more remotely allied, are not in the
first instance rooted in considerations of kinship. If men, instead of
remaining in the circle where they were born and keeping with their
kindred, had isolated themselves or united with strangers, there would
certainly be no blood-bond at all.</p>

<p>Innumerable facts show that the extent to which relatives are
forbidden to intermarry is nearly connected with their close living
together; and among various peoples marriage is prohibited even
between all persons belonging to the same village or other local
group, whether they are related by blood or not. At the same time the
members<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250"></a>250</span> of an
exogamous clan very frequently do not live in the same locality. The
exogamous rules, though in the first place associated with kinship
because near relatives normally live together, have come to include
relatives who do not do so&mdash;just as social rights and duties
connected with kinship, although ultimately depending upon local
proximity, have a strong tendency to last after the local tie is
broken. Clan exogamy has its counterpart, for instance, in the
blood-feud as a duty incumbent on the whole clan, whether the members
of the clan live together or not. In this process the influence of a
common name has undoubtedly been of great importance. As kinship is
traced by means of a system of names, the name comes to stand for
blood-relationship. This system is naturally one-sided, keeping up the
record of descent either on the father&rsquo;s or the mother&rsquo;s
side, but not on both sides at once; hence the prohibited degrees,
like the social rights and duties generally connected with clanship,
extend much farther on the one side than on the other.</p>

<p>It has been said by Professor Heymans, seconded by Professor
Taylor,<a id="Anchornotech8_70" href="#Notech8_70"><span
class="sp">70</span></a> that the attitude of mankind towards sexual
perversion is absolutely critical for the utilitarian theory. It is
argued that, so far as utilitarian consequences are concerned,
voluntary celibacy and sexual perversion, both being detrimental to
the propagation of the species, stand on much the same footing,
whereas it is clear that the unsophisticated moral verdict of the
<i>orbis terrarum</i> makes a distinction between them which the
utilitarian cannot explain and has no right to explain away.
Perversion is generally and strongly condemned, celibacy has been
praised as the height of moral perfection. This argument,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page251"></a>251</span> which shows no great
knowledge of actual moral ideas and their causes, takes us to a
discussion of celibacy and compels me to add a few words about
homosexuality to what was said of it in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>Among an enormous number of peoples celibacy <i>is</i> condemned,
to some extent for sentimental reasons but very largely on utilitarian
grounds.<a id="Anchornotech8_71" href="#Notech8_71"><span
class="sp">71</span></a> In the savage world nearly every man
endeavours to marry when he has reached the age of puberty&mdash;if he
has not been betrothed before&mdash;and practically every woman gets
married; and very frequently we are told that a person who does not
marry is looked upon as an unnatural being or is an object of contempt
or ridicule. So also among peoples of archaic culture celibacy is a
great exception and marriage is regarded as a duty. In China it is
considered one of the greatest misfortunes that could befall a man to
die without leaving a son to perpetuate the family cult, and at the
same time an offence against the whole line of ancestors. For it would
doom father, mother, and all the ancestry in the Nether-world to a
pitiable existence without descendants enough to serve them properly,
to worship at the ancestral tombs, to take care of the ancestral
tablets, and duly to perform all rites connected with the dead. Among
the Semites we meet with the idea that a dead man who has no children
will miss something in Sh&#277;ol through not receiving that kind of
worship which ancestors in early times appear to have received. The
Hebrews looked upon marriage as a religious duty. According to the
Sh&#363;l&#7717;&#257;n &#703;&#256;r&#363;kh, the recognized Jewish
code, he who abstains from marrying is guilty of bloodshed, diminishes
the image of God, and causes the divine presence to withdraw from
Israel; hence a single man past twenty may be compelled <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page252"></a>252</span>by the court to take a
wife.<a id="Anchornotech8_72" href="#Notech8_72"><span
class="sp">72</span></a> Although Islam considers marriage a civil
contract, it enjoins it as a religious duty &ldquo;incumbent on all
who possess the ability.&rdquo; The Aryan nations in ancient times, as
Fustel de Coulanges and others have pointed out, regarded celibacy as
an impiety and a misfortune: &ldquo;an impiety, because one who did
not marry put the happiness of the manes of the family in peril; a
misfortune, because he himself would receive no worship after his
death.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_73" href="#Notech8_73"><span
class="sp">73</span></a> The old idea still survives in India, and we
meet with it in Zoroastrianism and in ancient Greece.<a
id="Anchornotech8_74" href="#Notech8_74"><span
class="sp">74</span></a> But the Greeks regarded marriage as a matter
not only of private but also of public importance: in various places
criminal proceedings might be taken against celibates.<a
id="Anchornotech8_75" href="#Notech8_75"><span
class="sp">75</span></a> So also the conviction that the founding of a
house and the begetting of children constituted a moral necessity and
a public duty had a deep hold on the Roman mind in early times.<a

<p>Modern civilization looks upon celibacy in a different light. The
religious motive for marriage has ceased to exist: the lot of the dead
is no longer supposed to depend upon the devotion of the living. It is
said, in a general way, that marriage is a duty to the nation or the
race, but this argument is hardly applied to individual cases.
According to modern ideas the union between man and woman is too much
a matter of sentiment to be properly classified among civic duties.
Nor does the unmarried state strike us as particularly unnatural; such
a feeling is in compatible with the large proportion of people who
never marry. Nay, far from enjoining marriage as a duty incumbent<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page253"></a>253</span> on all, enlightened
opinion seems to agree that it is, on humanitarian&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
utilitarian&mdash;grounds, a duty for many persons to remain
unmarried. In some European countries the marriages of persons in
receipt of poor-law relief have been legally prohibited, and in
certain cases the legislators have gone further still and prohibited
all marriages until the contracting parties can prove that they
possess the means of supporting a family.<a id="Anchornotech8_77"
href="#Notech8_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> There is a growing
opinion that persons suffering from certain kinds of disease, which
are likely to be transmitted to the offspring, ought not to marry.
People are beginning to feel that it entails a heavy responsibility to
bring a new being into existence, and that many persons are wholly
unfit for such a task. Future generations will probably with a kind of
horror look back at a period when the most important, and in its
consequences the most far-reaching, function which has fallen to the
lot of man was entirely left to individual caprice and lust.</p>

<i>Democracy and Liberty</i>, ii. (London, 1809), p. 181.</p></div>

<p>Side by side with the notion that marriage is a duty for all
ordinary men and women, however, we find among many peoples the rule
that persons whose function it is to perform religious or magical
rites must be celibates.<a id="Anchornotech8_78"
href="#Notech8_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> To these belong both
savage and barbarous tribes and peoples of a higher civilization. In
ancient Peru there were virgins dedicated to the sun, who lived in
perpetual seclusion to the end of their lives. Among the Hindus, in
spite of the great honour in which marriage is held, celibacy has
always commanded respect in instances of extraordinary sanctity; and a
feeling of this kind led in Buddhism and Jainism to the obligatory
celibacy of monks and priests. In ancient Persia there were sun
priestesses who were <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page254"></a>254</span>obliged to refrain from intercourse with
men. The Romans had their vestal virgins. In Greece priestesses were
not infrequently required to be virgins, if not for their whole life,
at any rate for the duration of their priesthood. A small class of
Hebrews, the Essenes, held the idea that marriage is impure and
neglected wedlock. This doctrine exercised no influence, on Judaism,
but perhaps much upon Christianity. &ldquo;He that gives her (his
virgin) in marriage doeth well; but he that gives her not in marriage
doeth better.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_79" href="#Notech8_79"><span
class="sp">79</span></a> &ldquo;It is good for a man not to touch a
woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let each man have his own
wife, and let each woman have her own husband.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech8_80" href="#Notech8_80"><span
class="sp">80</span></a> This and other passages in the New Testament
inspired a general enthusiasm for virginity. It works miracles; it is
like a spring flower, always softly exhaling immortality from its
white petals. The Lord himself opens the kingdoms of the heavens to
eunuchs. If Adam had preserved his obedience to the Creator he would
have lived for ever in a state of virgin purity, and some harmless
mode of vegetation would have peopled paradise with a race of innocent
and immortal beings. But this opinion, expressed by Gregory of Nyssa
and John of Damascus, was opposed by Thomas Aquinas, who maintained
that the human race was from the beginning propagated by means of
sexual intercourse, although such intercourse was originally free from
all carnal desire, which is the real root of all sexual sinfulness.<a
id="Anchornotech8_81" href="#Notech8_81"><span
class="sp">81</span></a> Ideas of this sort led by degrees to the
obligatory celibacy of the Christian clergy.</p>

<p>Religious celibacy springs from various sources. In many cases the
priestess is regarded as married to the god <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page255"></a>255</span>whom she is serving. A trace of this idea
is even found in early Christianity. St. Cyprian speaks of women who
have dedicated themselves to Christ and live with him in a spiritual
matrimony; and if any of these women is guilty of impure connections
she is &ldquo;an adulteress, not against a husband, but
Christ.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_82" href="#Notech8_82"><span
class="sp">82</span></a> According to the gospel of Pseudo-Matthew,
the Virgin Mary had in a similar manner dedicated herself as a virgin
to God.<a id="Anchornotech8_83" href="#Notech8_83"><span
class="sp">83</span></a> Religious celibacy is further enjoined or
commended as a means of self-mortification supposed to appease an
angry god, or with a view to raising the spiritual nature of man by
suppressing one of the strongest of all sensual appetites. It has also
been argued that marriage prevents a person from serving God
perfectly, because it induces him to occupy himself too much with
worldly things; and this was one, but certainly not the only, cause of
the obligatory celibacy which the Christian Church imposed upon her
clergy. A further, and extremely important, cause of religious
celibacy is the idea that sexual intercourse is defiling and in
certain circumstances a mysterious cause of evil. This idea is
particularly conspicuous in connection with religious observances. It
is a common rule that he who performs a sacred act or enters a holy
place must be ceremonially clean, and no kind of uncleanness is to be
avoided more carefully than sexual pollution. Holiness is a delicate
quality which is easily destroyed if anything polluting comes into
contact with the holy object or person, and it may also injure them in
a more positive manner. In self-defence, therefore, gods and holy
persons try to prevent polluted individuals from approaching them,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256"></a>256</span>and their
worshippers are naturally anxious to do the same. And apart from the
resentment that the sacred being naturally feels against the defiler,
it appears that holiness is supposed to act quite mechanically against
pollution, to the destruction or discomfort of the polluted person. It
should also be noticed that, owing to the injurious effect of
pollution upon holiness, an act generally regarded as sacred would, if
performed by an unclean individual, lack that magic efficacy which
would otherwise be attached to it. Mohammed described the ablution,
which is a necessary preparation for prayer, as &ldquo;the half of
faith and the key of prayer.&rdquo; The Syrian philosopher Jamblichus
speaks of the belief that &ldquo;the gods do not hear him who invokes
them, if he is impure from venereal connections&rdquo;;<a
id="Anchornotech8_84" href="#Notech8_84"><span

early Christians.</p>

<p>If freedom from sexual pollution is required even of the ordinary
worshipper, it is of course all the more indispensable in those whose
special office is to attend to the sacred cult. The Hebrew priest had
to avoid all unchastity; he was not allowed to marry a harlot or a
divorced wife, and the high-priest was also forbidden to marry a
widow.<a id="Anchornotech8_85" href="#Notech8_85"><span
class="sp">85</span></a> But for a nation like the Jews, whose
ambition was to live and to multiply, celibacy could never become an
ideal. The Christians, on the other hand, who professed the most
perfect indifference to all earthly matters, found no difficulty in
glorifying a state which, however opposed it was to the interests of
the race and the nation, made men pre-eminently fit to approach their
god. It was even argued that sexual intercourse, far from being a
benefit to the kingdom of God by propagating the species, was on the
contrary detrimental to it by being the great transmitter of the sin
of our first parents. Thus the view that celibacy is the height of
moral perfection is simply the outcome of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page257"></a>257</span>some specific religious and magical beliefs
of a rather primitive character; and utilitarianism can therefore
hardly be blamed for being at variance with it.</p>

id="Notech8_85" href="#Anchornotech8_85">85</a></span>
<i>Leviticus</i>, xxi. 7, 14.</p></div>

<p>Nor can it be blamed if it does not condemn sexual
perversion&mdash;which has been said to stand on much the same footing
as celibacy&mdash;on the ground that it is unfavourable to
propagation. Utilitarianism does not consider reproduction as a duty
for a man; nor does it condemn sexual acts that are unproductive of
offspring, unless there are other reasons for condemning them. If it
did, it would, to be consistent, have to accept the Christian
doctrine, laid down by Athenagoras, that the procreation of children
is the measure of a man&rsquo;s indulgence in appetite, just as the
husbandman throwing the seed into the ground awaits the harvest, not
sowing more upon it.<a id="Anchornotech8_86" href="#Notech8_86"><span
class="sp">86</span></a> Utilitarians have found reasons for
condemning perversion as harmful, at least in certain cases, and
refused to recognize any other reasons.<a id="Anchornotech8_87"
href="#Notech8_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> But utilitarian
considerations can certainly not account for the great variety of
moral attitudes towards homosexuality. It seems quite obvious, as I
have pointed out in another connection, that where homosexual
intercourse is an object of censure it is so in the first place on
account of the aversion it is apt to call forth; while the view that
it is a crime of the utmost gravity is due to its association with
unbelief or heresy.<a id="Anchornotech8_88" href="#Notech8_88"><span

<p>From this discussion&mdash;which has been somewhat lengthy on
account of the extremely complicated nature of the subject and its
great theoretical importance from the ethical point of view&mdash;it
should be obvious that the moral ideas relating to chastity partly
rest on a utilitarian basis, partly are influenced by specific
religious ideas, and to a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page258"></a>258</span>large extent spring from sentimental likes
and dislikes, which in no branch of morality have been allowed a
greater scope than here. Generally speaking, sentimental preferences
and aversions are largely responsible for that divergence which exists
between actual moral ideas and a consistently utilitarian code of
morality. But instead of recognizing this divergence moralists have
only too often disguised it by advancing utilitarian pretexts for
sentimental requirements, and have thereby missed an opportunity to
act as moral educators. It is a strong point in consistent
utilitarianism that it cannot accept such requirements on their own
merits. Although the origin of instinctive likings and aversions,
which are still more or less generally felt, may be sought for in
their specific usefulness, civilization has brought about changed
conditions so far removed from the state of nature that such feelings
can by no means serve as utilitarian criteria of morality. If we
clearly realize that a certain act is productive of no other harm but
the aversion or disgust it causes, we can hardly look upon it as a
proper object of moral censure, provided that the agent has not in an
indelicate manner shocked anybody&rsquo;s feelings. When sufficiently
discriminating, resentment, whether moral or non-moral, is too much
concerned with the will of the agent to be felt towards a person who
obviously neither intends to offend any one nor is guilty of culpable
oversight. Even when the person knows that his behaviour is repulsive
to others, he may, on utilitarian grounds, be considered to be
justified in acting as he does; some degree of reflection should lead
to the thought that antipathies are no sufficient ground for
interfering with other individuals&rsquo; liberty of action either by
punishing them or subjecting them to moral censure. Nobody has more
vehemently denounced such interference than Stuart Mill. He insisted
on &ldquo;liberty of tastes and pursuits;<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page259"></a>259</span> of framing the plan of our life to suit
our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such consequences
as may follow: without impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long
as what we do does not harm them, even though they should think our
conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_89"
href="#Notech8_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> Bain wrote,
&ldquo;When one man endeavours to impose his likings or dislikes upon
another, or when a mere sentimental preference entertained by the
majority is made the law for every one, there is a very serious
infringement of individual freedom on the one hand, with nothing
legitimate to be set against it in the way of advantage.&rdquo;<a

<p>An often adduced argument against utilitarianism, and hedonism
generally, is that it considers the motive of all action to be a
desire to feel pleasure or avoid pain, although every desire aims
directly at an objective end and not, at least in the first instance,
at the attainment of the subjective feeling of pleasure or relief from
pain. Hunger is directed to food, ambition to honour, benevolence to
the good of others, and similarly with other desires. Butler wrote
long ago that &ldquo;all particular appetites and passions are towards
external things themselves, and distinct from the pleasure arising
from them.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_91" href="#Notech8_91"><span
class="sp">91</span></a> An act may be desired though it is not known
by the agent to be attended with pleasure. As Professor McDougall
remarks, &ldquo;we may observe numberless instances of action, of
persistent striving towards ends, on the part of lowly animals which
can not be credited with the power of anticipating or desiring the
pleasure that may accrue from success.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_92"
href="#Notech8_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> Nor is
anticipation<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260"></a>260</span> of
pleasure always connected with an act which is known to be
pleasurable. But the doctrine of psychological hedonism, according to
which volition is always determined by pleasure or pain actual or
prospective, is not inseparably joined with utilitarianism, and has
even been expressly rejected by some of its expounders. As an ethical
theory utilitarianism is essentially concerned, not with the
psychology of desire, but with the moral valuation of acts. In our
moral consciousness pleasure and pain certainly play a dominant role,
in so far as moral approval is a kindly attitude of mind towards a
person as a cause of pleasure, and moral disapproval a hostile
attitude of mind towards a person as a cause of pain. But this has
nothing whatever to do with the psychological question of pleasure and
pain as motives of action.</p>

<p>The distinction between the desire for pleasure and the desire for
something pleasant is emphasized by those theories which have been
included under names like energism, welfare theory, or eudemonism. The
moral value lies not in pleasure as such but in pleasurable functions.
The preservation and promotion of individual and social life is the
highest good, because the individual being strives to preserve and
advance both himself and other persons with whom he sympathizes, and
though pleasure is not the direct object of desire it is a necessary
concomitant of the realization of the desire to promote individual and
racial welfare. The theories belonging to this class do not present
the same definiteness as utilitarianism, which regards pleasure as the
common standard of all that is desirable, and they often differ in
details. What is &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;? HÃ¶ffding defines it as a
durable state of pleasure, or &ldquo;true&rdquo; happiness, which is
not a state of passivity but one consisting in activity, work,
development.<a id="Anchornotech8_93" href="#Notech8_93"><span
class="sp">93</span></a> According<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page261"></a>261</span> to other eudemonists, pleasure is an
indication of the successful attainment of the general end, welfare.<a
id="Anchornotech8_94" href="#Notech8_94"><span
class="sp">94</span></a> But however welfare is defined, it is always
something which we desire, and all psychologists agree that the
fulfilment of a desire brings pleasure while the frustration of it
brings pain.<a id="Anchornotech8_95" href="#Notech8_95"><span
class="sp">95</span></a> This is the case whatever the object of the
desire may be&mdash;pleasure, welfare, self-realization, or any other
&ldquo;good.&rdquo; And thus every ethical theory that regards any
course of conduct which promotes the attainment of a certain desired
end as good and any course of conduct which obstructs it as bad, is so
far in agreement with my view that moral judgments are ultimately
based on emotional reactions against causes of pleasure or pain. I
have no reason, then, to examine the attempts of the rival theories to
fix the nature of the desire concerned.</p>

<p>Among teleological moralists, both hedonists and non-hedonists,
there are, as we have seen, some who derive their criterion of
morality directly from the general prevalence of a certain kind of
desire, and others who found their theories on intuitions. These
intuitions are nowadays generally referred to reason, or practical or
moral reason, as a special faculty or a part of the general faculty of
reason, by which we apprehend moral truths immediately without the
drawing of inferences. Now it is very significant that the conduct
which the supposed moral intuitions pronounce good or bad at the same
time has a tendency to arouse emotions of moral approval or
disapproval. The intuitionist maintains that it does so, and has
always done so, <i>because</i> it is good or bad; whereas in my
opinion it is, or was originally, held to be good or <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page262"></a>262</span>bad on account of its
tendency to arouse the emotion. Intuitionists are fond of comparing
moral judgments to mathematical propositions; but they have ignored
the fact that while the former are correlated with certain definite
emotions, there is in the case of the latter no similar correlation at
all. Richard Price, it is true, argued that our perceptions of virtue
and vice ought no more to be confounded with the feelings which are
their effects and concomitants &ldquo;than a particular truth (like
that for which Pythagoras offered a hecatomb) ought to be confounded
with the pleasure that may attend the discovery of it.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech8_96" href="#Notech8_96"><span
class="sp">96</span></a> This is, of course, an altogether different
matter: the pleasure caused by the <i>discovery</i> of a truth is not
comparable to the emotions felt in connection with the attribution of
moral qualities to conduct or character. As a &ldquo;plausible&rdquo;
explanation of this connection it has been suggested that the emotions
of approval and disapproval may &ldquo;furnish the necessary occasions
on which Reason recognizes ethical characteristics, such as
<i>goodness</i> and <i>rightness</i>.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech8_97"
href="#Notech8_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> If this were the
case, we should have to admit that the emotions, owing to their
variability, would frequently beguile Reason into transgression of its
own &ldquo;law of non-contradiction,&rdquo; by declaring the very same
course <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263"></a>263</span>of conduct
sometimes right or good and at other times wrong or bad. This would no
doubt explain the irreconcilable conflict between intuitions of
different moralists, but at a cost too terrible to be conceived. The
only reasonable explanation of the intimate connection between
so-called intuitions and the presence of emotional tendencies is, so
far as I can see, that the intuitions actually <i>are</i> these
tendencies formulated as judgments that are calculated to give moral
values an objectivity they do not in reality possess.<a
id="Anchornotech8_98" href="#Notech8_98"><span
class="sp">98</span></a> If this be admitted, an enormous advance is
made towards our understanding of the moral consciousness. For while a
moral intuition can be no more explained than a mathematical axiom, a
moral emotion <i>can</i> be explained, as a particular emotional
attitude arising under definite conditions. We can say <i>why</i> it
arises, our mental constitution being such as it is, and the moral
judgment may thereby be traced to its ultimate source.</p>

the presence of certain emotions. He finds it difficult to distinguish
mere feelings or aversions from real judgments of value, although he
is clear that the two things must be distinguished. The only approach
to a test he can suggest is to put the question, whether &ldquo;an
intuition&mdash;an apparently unaccountable repugnance to some kind of
conduct&mdash;&ldquo; persists after a due consideration of all the

<p class="noind"><span class="small">In his</span> ethical theory Kant
differs both from those who maintain that the general prevalence of a
desire leads directly to the duty of satisfying it, and, apparently at
least, from those who base moral laws on intuitions which they
discover in their own consciousness. He founds his ethics on
conceptions of pure reason without any appeal to experience of any
kind: &ldquo;reason of itself, independent of all experience, ordains
what ought to take place.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_1"
href="#Notech9_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In his <i>Grundlegung
zur Metaphysik der Sitten</i> he says that we cannot make out
empirically whether there is an imperative of morality, a categorical
imperative, at all; and not having the advantage of its reality being
given in experience, we have to investigate its possibility <i>a
priori</i>.<a id="Anchornotech9_2" href="#Notech9_2"><span
class="sp">2</span></a> The basis of obligation must be sought <i>a
priori</i> in the conceptions of pure reason and not in the nature of
man, or in the circumstances in the world in which he is placed,
because all moral laws must be valid with absolute necessity. They
must be so for all rational creatures generally, and for this reason
only also for men. In other words, &ldquo;we must derive them from the
general concept of a rational being.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_3"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page265"></a>265</span>In order that
Kant&rsquo;s conception of obligation shall hold good for a rational
being it is not enough that this being is endowed with reason. In the
first place, the moral law applies to all rational beings &ldquo;in so
far as they have a will, that is, a power to determine their causality
by the conception of rules.&rdquo; For the Infinite Being, however,
there is no obligation or duty, because its will is a holy will, which
would be incapable of any maxim conflicting with the moral law, and
obligation implies a constraint to an action by the law, while duty is
the name given to this action. On the other hand, for all created
rational beings, affected as they are with wants and physical motives,
the moral law is a law of duty, of moral constraint, and of the
determination of their actions by respect for this law and reverence
for its duty.<a id="Anchornotech9_4" href="#Notech9_4"><span
class="sp">4</span></a> This implies that these beings have not only
reason and a will, but also desires which tempt them to transgress the
moral law. Kant has thus attributed human feelings and inclinations,
which he knows by experience, to rational beings of whom he can have
no experience.<a id="Anchornotech9_5" href="#Notech9_5"><span
class="sp">5</span></a> But apart from this, what is the use of the
proposition that the conception of duty holds good for all finite
rational beings, if these beings are presumed to have just those
characteristics of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page266"></a>266</span>humanity which Kant was so anxious to
eliminate in his deduction of duty from reason?</p>

Abbott, p. 175).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a
id="Notech9_5" href="#Anchornotech9_5">5</a></span> In his
<i>Einleitung zur Tugendlehre</i>, 1 (<i>Gesammelte Schriften</i>, vi.
[Berlin, 1914], p. 379; Abbott, p. 290), Kant seems to have discovered
his mistake, when he writes that the constraint announced by the moral
imperative &ldquo;does not apply to all rational beings (for there may
also be holy beings), but applies to men as rational physical beings
who are unholy enough to be seduced by pleasure to the transgression
of the moral law, although they themselves recognize its
authority.&rdquo; In his <i>Kritik der praktischen Vernunft</i> (i. 1.
1. 7 [v. 32; Abbott, p. 121]) he had said that the holiness of will is
&ldquo;a practical idea which must serve as a type to which finite
rational beings can only approximate indefinitely.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The proposition in question, which Kant never gets tired of
repeating, was intended to give emphasis and support to his contention
that the moral law has its foundation in pure reason; he does not even
shrink from an argument like this: &ldquo;Since moral laws ought to
hold good for every rational creature, we must derive them from the
general concept of a rational being.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_6"
href="#Notech9_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> His main thesis is
that no experience can explain a law which must carry with it absolute
necessity, and that it consequently must be based on reason. The moral
law, he says, &ldquo;is conceived as objectively necessary, only
because it holds for everybody that has reason and will.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech9_7" href="#Notech9_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
That it possesses objective validity was an idea that Kant, like all
other normative moralists, shared with common sense. He found this
idea in his moral experience in the form of a categorical imperative
preserving the mysterious awfulness of the old &ldquo;Thou
shalt,&rdquo; as an echo from another world.<a id="Anchornotech9_8"
href="#Notech9_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> When he says that we
cannot make out empirically whether there is such an imperative at
all, he refers in proof of this to our inability to show with
certainty in any example that the will was determined merely by the
law, without any other spring of action.<a id="Anchornotech9_9"
href="#Notech9_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> But surely, our
inability to do so does not involve that we have no notion of the law
itself. In his <i>Kritik der praktischen Vernunft</i> he has evidently
himself come to the same conclusion; for he says there, &ldquo;The
moral law is given as a fact of pure <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page267"></a>267</span>reason of which we are <i>a priori</i>
conscious, and which is apodictically certain, though it be granted
that in experience no example of its exact fulfilment can be
found.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_10" href="#Notech9_10"><span
class="sp">10</span></a> And when he speaks of the two things which
fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the
starry heavens above and the moral law within, he adds:&mdash;&ldquo;I
have not to search for them and conjecture them as though they were
veiled in darkness or were in the transcendent region beyond my
horizon; I see them before me and connect them directly with the
consciousness of my existence.&hellip; The second begins from my
invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has
true infinity, but which is traceable only by the
understanding.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_11" href="#Notech9_11"><span

<p>While deriving the moral law from reason, Kant was overwhelmed by
the awe and reverence it aroused in him.<a id="Anchornotech9_12"
href="#Notech9_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> He writes,
&ldquo;The majesty of the law (like that on Sinai) inspires (not
dread, which repels, nor yet a charm, which invites to familiarity,
but) <i>awe</i>, which awakes <i>respect</i> of the subject for his
law-giver, and in the present case the latter being within ourselves,
a feeling of the sublimity of our own destiny.<span class="correction"
title="omitted in text">&rdquo;</span><a id="Anchornotech9_13"
href="#Notech9_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> It is in this
powerful emotional response to the notion of duty that we have to look
for the ultimate ground of his theory of the moral motive. The notion
of duty &ldquo;requires in the action, objectively, agreement with the
law, and, subjectively in its maxim, that respect for the law shall be
the sole mode in which the will <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page268"></a>268</span>is determined thereby.&hellip; Moral worth
can be placed only in this, that the action is done from duty, that
is, simply for the sake of the law.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_14"
href="#Notech9_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> No act done from
inclination has any moral worth, and this is true whatever be the
nature of the inclination. All human inclinations are desire for
pleasure: &ldquo;to be happy is necessarily the wish of every finite
rational being, and this, therefore, is inevitably a determining
principle of its faculty of desire.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_15"
href="#Notech9_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> And the feeling of
pleasure is always of one and the same kind and can only differ in
degree: it is of no consequence what the pleasing object is, but only
how much it pleases.<a id="Anchornotech9_16" href="#Notech9_16"><span
class="sp">16</span></a> Kant illustrates his doctrine by the
following example. A man is beneficent simply because his mind is so
sympathetically constituted that he, without any other motive, finds a
pleasure in spreading joy around him and takes delight in the
satisfaction of others so far as it is his own work. However proper,
however amiable an action of this kind may be, it has nevertheless no
true moral worth, but is on a level with any other that is done from
inclination and not from duty. On the other hand, if nature has put
little sympathy in the heart of this or that man, if he is by
temperament cold and indifferent to the sufferings of his fellowmen,
&ldquo;would he not still find in himself a source from whence to give
himself a far higher worth than that of a good-natured temperament
could be? Unquestionably. It is just in this that the moral worth of
the character is brought out which is incomparably the highest of all,
namely, that he is beneficent, not from inclination, but from
duty.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_17" href="#Notech9_17"><span
class="sp">17</span></a> So also actions which are done with great
sacrifice may be praised as <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page269"></a>269</span>noble and sublime, &ldquo;only so far as
there are traces which suggest that they were done wholly out of
respect for duty and not from excited feelings.&rdquo;<a

<p>Thus, then, while Kant agreed with the psychological hedonists that
all human inclinations are desire for pleasure, the ethical conclusion
he drew from this assumption was the exact opposite of hedonism.
Instead of deriving moral worth from desire for pleasure, he regarded
this desire as the great obstacle to morality. But then the question
arose: How shall we explain that respect for the moral law which is
the condition for its fulfilment? How can it be a spring to action?
This is a problem with which Kant grapples without being able to solve
it. Respect for the law is a feeling which is produced by an
intellectual cause, a rational concept, and therefore specifically
distinct from all feelings that may be referred either to inclination
or fear.<a id="Anchornotech9_19" href="#Notech9_19"><span
class="sp">19</span></a> In order that &ldquo;a rational being who is
also affected through the senses should will what reason alone directs
such beings that they ought to will, it is no doubt requisite that
reason should have a power to infuse a feeling of pleasure or
satisfaction in the fulfilment of duty, that is to say, that it should
have a causality by which it determines the sensibility according to
its own principles.&rdquo; But at the same time it seems to him quite
impossible to discern how a mere thought, which itself contains
nothing sensible, can itself produce a sensation of pleasure or
pain&mdash;quite impossible to explain how man can take an interest in
the moral law. In other words, &ldquo;how pure reason can be
practical&mdash;to explain this is beyond the power of human reason,
and all the labour and pains of seeking an explanation of it are
lost.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_20" href="#Notech9_20"><span

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page270"></a>270</span>It has often
been pointed out that the radical distinction which Kant makes between
&ldquo;the respect for the moral law&rdquo; and
&ldquo;inclination&rdquo; is a psychological error, and that
conscientious action springs from a desire or inclination just as any
other action. The incompatibility of his proposition, that there is no
moral worth in any act that is not done simply for duty&rsquo;s sake,
with current moral ideas is equally evident. The point which is of
particular interest in this connection is the question how he came to
form such a view. Besides the extraordinarily strong hold the feeling
of duty had on his mind, his defective psychology, and his aversion to
the ethical hedonism and eudemonism which flourished in his days,
there are some other facts to be considered. Kant had the perfectly
correct idea of the conception of duty that it implicitly contains a
prohibition of that which ought <i>not</i> to be done, that there
would be no moral law if there were no possibility of its
transgression.<a id="Anchornotech9_21" href="#Notech9_21"><span
class="sp">21</span></a> But this does not imply that whenever a
person behaves in conformity to it, the idea of transgression presents
itself to his mind. In the enormous majority of cases there is no
thought of it at all. Most of us are throughout our lives obedient to
the rules which forbid murder, theft, adultery, and what not, and who
would say that we are so from that respect for the law which,
according to Kant, &ldquo;implies fear, or at least apprehension of
transgression&rdquo;?<a id="Anchornotech9_22" href="#Notech9_22"><span
class="sp">22</span></a> The same applies to most of the numberless
duties which we perform in our daily life as a matter of course; it is
only in rare cases that we think of the contrary course of conduct at
all. There is chiefly an apprehension of it when a desire conflicting
with the law tempts the person to be disobedient to it; and it is on
such cases of conflict that Kant has concentrated his attention<span
class="pagenum"><a id="page271"></a>271</span> in his doctrine of
duty. If the respect for the moral law implies apprehension of its
transgression and at the same time is a necessary condition for doing
one&rsquo;s duty, it is certainly quite consistent to assert that the
doing of a dutiful action necessarily involves a conscious resistance
to inclination; but it is to restrict the meaning of duty within much
narrower limits than is justified by the ordinary usage of the
word.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a

<p>The notion of duty, as commonly conceived, implies that the
contrary mode of conduct is wrong. The man who refrains from doing his
duty is disapproved of, he who does his duty is not disapproved of.
This is the essential fact contained in the notion of duty.<a
id="Anchornotech9_23" href="#Notech9_23"><span
class="sp">23</span></a> But what moral worth could there be, under
all circumstances, in refraining from doing wrong? Yet, though the
notion of duty involves no applause, there are cases in which we
applaud a man for doing his duty. The performance of an act may of
course be praised, although the omission of it is disapproved of; and,
besides, &ldquo;duty&rdquo; is often used as the name for a course of
conduct the omission of which is generally, though not necessarily in
every instance, an object of disapproval.<a id="Anchornotech9_24"
href="#Notech9_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Now we are
particularly apt to bestow moral praise on a person who has done his
duty in unusually difficult circumstances, when he had a strong
interest in acting differently and his conduct involves a high degree
of self-restraint. This explains why Kant attributes moral worth only
to dutiful acts that result from a successful struggle against
contrary inclinations. For him &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sublime
and mighty name,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_25"
href="#Notech9_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> is an expression of
admiration and reverence, of the emotion of moral approval aroused by
obedience to duty, and not <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page272"></a>272</span>merely of the emotion of disapproval
aroused by transgression. He takes no notice of any other duty, or, as
he would say, action objectively conformable to the law, but that
which &ldquo;gains reluctant reverence,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_26"
href="#Notech9_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> except that he
pronounces it devoid of all moral worth. He does not say that it is
wrong because it is performed from some other motive than respect for
the law. He even finds it a very beautiful thing to do good to men
from love of them and from sympathetic goodwill, or to be just from
love of order.<a id="Anchornotech9_27" href="#Notech9_27"><span
class="sp">27</span></a> And he applies the term &ldquo;fantastically
virtuous&rdquo; to the man who will admit nothing to be indifferent in
respect of morality, and &ldquo;who strews all his steps with duties,
as with traps.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_28" href="#Notech9_28"><span
class="sp">28</span></a> At the same time, his notion of the sublimity
of duty implies that he can assign no superiority to other concepts
based on the emotion of moral approval. What is good is what ought to
be done; however virtuous any one may be, all the good he can ever do
is only duty;<a id="Anchornotech9_29" href="#Notech9_29"><span
class="sp">29</span></a> and &ldquo;when we can bring any flattering
thought of merit into our action, then the motive is already somewhat
alloyed with self-love.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_30"
href="#Notech9_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> He speaks, however,
of &ldquo;imperfect duties&rdquo; that are &ldquo;duties of
virtue&rdquo; and the fulfilment of which is &ldquo;merit,&rdquo;
though their transgression is not necessarily demerit but only moral
unworth.<a id="Anchornotech9_31" href="#Notech9_31"><span

<p>In the case of all finite beings that possess reason and will, says
Kant, the moral law has the form of an imperative which commands
categorically.<a id="Anchornotech9_32" href="#Notech9_32"><span
class="sp">32</span></a> The categorical imperative lays down the rule
that you ought to obey the law whatever be the consequences of your
action; and &ldquo;the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page273"></a>273</span>moral worth of an action does not lie in
the effect expected from it, nor in any principle of action which
requires to borrow its motive from this expected effect.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech9_33" href="#Notech9_33"><span
class="sp">33</span></a> Hence the moral worthlessness of all
hypothetical imperatives, which say that you ought to do so or so if
you desire such or such an end.<a id="Anchornotech9_34"
href="#Notech9_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> Kant&rsquo;s
doctrine of moral imperatives is in agreement with the fact,
recognized both by moralists and common sense, that duties are
expressed in rules which command general obedience, but it is singular
in its insistence that there must be no modification of these rules to
meet exceptional cases. Even Schleiermacher, who tried to organize
ethically the whole of life, had to refrain from formulating precepts
applicable in all situations.<a id="Anchornotech9_35"
href="#Notech9_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> That Kant refused to
allow any exceptions to moral rules was due to his peculiar idea that
they could have no other ground but the individual&rsquo;s desire to
modify the rule in his own favour. He says that the specific criterion
of categorical as distinguished from hypothetical imperatives is that
all interest is renounced.<a id="Anchornotech9_36"

<p>As the content of the categorical imperative Kant gives the
formula, &ldquo;Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same
time will that it should become a universal law.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech9_37" href="#Notech9_37"><span
class="sp">37</span></a> What is meant here by the word
&ldquo;will&rdquo;? If Kant <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page274"></a>274</span>has used it in its ordinary psychological
sense the consequences are appallingly inconsistent with the most
fundamental principle of his ethical theory. One person may will that
one maxim should become a universal law and another person may will
that the opposite maxim should become so, and if anybody&rsquo;s will
in that respect is recognized as a criterion of duty, both the
conflicting maxims are right. In other words, whatever any one thinks
is right is right, and there is no objectively valid moral law at
all.<a id="Anchornotech9_38" href="#Notech9_38"><span
class="sp">38</span></a> In the argument by which Kant tries to show
that it is impossible to adopt the egoistic maxim as a universal law,
he evidently speaks of will as a psychological fact. He maintains that
the very selfishness of men, for whom happiness is by nature the first
and unconditional object of their desire,<a id="Anchornotech9_39"
href="#Notech9_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> must make them wish
to act altruistically. Although it is possible that a universal law of
nature might exist in accordance with the maxim that each should be
left to take care of himself without the assistance of others,
&ldquo;it is impossible to <i>will</i> that such a principle should
have the universal validity of a law of nature. For a will which
resolved this would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might
occur in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others,
and in which, by such a law of nature, sprung from his own will, he
would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech9_40" href="#Notech9_40"><span
class="sp">40</span></a> What else could Kant in this instance mean by
will but the &ldquo;elective will,&rdquo; as he calls it, which
&ldquo;implies a wish that arises from subjective causes, and
therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275"></a>275</span> may
often be opposed to the pure objective determining principle&rdquo;?<a
id="Anchornotech9_41" href="#Notech9_41"><span
class="sp">41</span></a> A will whose maxim that one should help
others springs from the selfish wish to be helped by them cannot be
said to be a will the universal legislation of which &ldquo;is not
based on any interest,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_42"
href="#Notech9_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> or &ldquo;an
absolutely good will,&rdquo; the principle of which must be a
categorical imperative, and the maxims of which are capable of making
themselves a universal law, &ldquo;which the will of every rational
being imposes on itself, without needing to assume any spring or
interest as a foundation.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_43"
href="#Notech9_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> Nevertheless, it may
very well be that Kant, when framing his formula, thought of a
rational will, of the capability to act in accordance with practical
reason as the guide of one&rsquo;s action, and in this case there
could be nothing illogical or self-contradictory in one&rsquo;s
maxim.<a id="Anchornotech9_44" href="#Notech9_44"><span
class="sp">44</span></a> This interpretation is suggested by the
formula in <i>Kritik der praktischen Vernunft</i>, &ldquo;Act so that
the maxim of thy will can always at the same time hold good as a
principle of universal legislation.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_45"

<p>A host of critics have pointed out the impossibility of deriving
moral obligation from the principle of mere formal self-consistency.<a
id="Anchornotech9_46" href="#Notech9_46"><span
class="sp">46</span></a> &ldquo;A principle that is suitable for
universal legislation,&rdquo; said Hegel, &ldquo;already presupposes a
content.&hellip; The criterion that there should be no
contradiction<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276"></a>276</span>
produces nothing.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_47"
href="#Notech9_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> Even in the cases
which Kant has carefully selected to demonstrate his principle he
cannot help considering human nature, social conditions, and the
consequences of acts, however much he deprecates a morality that
depends on experience. Lotze<a id="Anchornotech9_48"
href="#Notech9_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> and others have
remarked that without a consideration of consequences almost any maxim
might be suitable to be presented as a universal rule; it is its
consequences that decide whether it is suitable or not. Kant says that
even common sense considers the maxim of an action morally impossible
if it does not stand the test of &ldquo;the form of a universal law of
nature&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech9_49" href="#Notech9_49"><span
class="sp">49</span></a> and in a certain sense he is right. It has
been said that the weakness of his imperative of duty is that it
&ldquo;lacks all organic filling,&rdquo; that it is an empty form
without contents, an unconditional command which commands nothing;
but, as it seems to me, his fault was just that he attempted to fill
it by deriving from it particular rules of duty. If he had left it
alone it would have amounted to this: there is a moral law, which like
every law has the character of universality, in so far that what is
right or wrong for me to do is also right or wrong to do for all
similar persons in similar circumstances. This is no discovery of
Kant,<a id="Anchornotech9_50" href="#Notech9_50"><span
class="sp">50</span></a> it is as old as morality itself. It is an
expression of the disinterestedness or impartiality of the moral
emotions, which distinguishes them from other retributive emotions;
and this characteristic, as we have seen, has its root in primitive
custom as a rule of conduct, in the public indignation aroused by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277"></a>277</span>its transgression.
Kant&rsquo;s categorical imperative has thus a deep foundation in the
nature of the moral emotions, and could therefore serve as a moral law
claiming universality. He had himself the notion that this claim
implied a tautology. He wrote, &ldquo;A practical law which I
recognize as such must be qualified for universal legislation; this is
an identical proposition, and therefore self-evident.&rdquo;<a

<p>Very different from what Kant calls &ldquo;the general formula of
the categorical imperative&rdquo; is another which he thinks he can
deduce from it, namely, &ldquo;So act as to treat humanity, whether in
thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end
withal, never as means only.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_52"
href="#Notech9_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> The former is a
purely formal law of logical consistency, the latter is a special rule
of duty, which enjoins a certain course of conduct and requires
experience for its observance. If interpreted as an injunction
referring to one&rsquo;s action in a given situation only, it is a
rule which is neither followed nor regarded as a duty by anybody. As
Professor Laird says, &ldquo;when I send letters by the post,
letter-sorters and engine-drivers <i>are</i> mere instruments so far
as I am concerned, and similarly I may make a mere instrument of
myself.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_53" href="#Notech9_53"><span
class="sp">53</span></a> Against this it has been argued that &ldquo;I
am not treating postmen and sorters as <i>mere</i> tools when I post a
letter, as is sufficiently proved by the consideration that we should
all refuse to staff the Post Office with public slaves to be used up,
regardless of humanity, for our own convenience.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech9_54" href="#Notech9_54"><span
class="sp">54</span></a> This implies <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page278"></a>278</span>that they are recognized by me as persons
having certain claims to consideration or rights, and, although this
recognition can hardly be said to form part of my treatment of them
when I post my letter, Kant would no doubt have accepted such an
interpretation of his formula. It was the expression of a broad
humanitarian feeling, which was in agreement with the spirit of an age
profoundly influenced by the teaching of Rousseau and the new ideas of
human worth and dignity and rights as something belonging to every man
independently of his station.<a id="Anchornotech9_55"
href="#Notech9_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> Kant&rsquo;s
endeavour to found it upon a purely rational principle<a
id="Anchornotech9_56" href="#Notech9_56"><span
class="sp">56</span></a> cannot conceal its eudemonistic origin. In
one place he himself recognizes a connection between his conception of
humanity as an end in itself and the duty of promoting the happiness
of others, though he deduces the latter from the former: the natural
end which all men have is their own happiness, and &ldquo;the ends of
any subject which is an end in himself, ought as far as possible to be
<i>my</i> ends also.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_57"

<p>In spite of his aversion to eudemonism, Kant cannot keep out the
notion of happiness as an end. He describes it as &ldquo;the general
well-being and contentment with one&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page279"></a>279</span> condition,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_58"
href="#Notech9_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> or as &ldquo;a
rational being&rsquo;s consciousness of the pleasantness of life
uninterruptedly accompanying his whole existence,&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech9_59" href="#Notech9_59"><span
class="sp">59</span></a> or as a man&rsquo;s &ldquo;satisfaction with
his condition, with certainty of the continuance of this
satisfaction.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_60" href="#Notech9_60"><span
class="sp">60</span></a> To be happy is necessarily the wish of every
man,<a id="Anchornotech9_61" href="#Notech9_61"><span
class="sp">61</span></a> and pure practical reason does not require
that we should renounce all claim to happiness, but only that the
moment duty is in question we should take no account of happiness.<a
id="Anchornotech9_62" href="#Notech9_62"><span
class="sp">62</span></a> On the other hand, to seek one&rsquo;s own
happiness is not an end that is also a duty. A command that every one
should try to make himself happy would be foolish, for one never
commands any one to do what he of himself infallibly wishes to do.<a
id="Anchornotech9_63" href="#Notech9_63"><span
class="sp">63</span></a> Such a thing does not come under the notion
of duty at all, because this is a constraint to an end reluctantly
adopted, and it is therefore a contradiction to say that a man is in
duty bound to advance his own happiness.<a id="Anchornotech9_64"
href="#Notech9_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> At the same time he
may be indirectly bound to do so: discontent with one&rsquo;s
condition, under a pressure of many anxieties and amidst unsatisfied
wants, might easily become a great temptation to transgression of
duty, and in order to remove such hindrances to morality it may be our
duty to promote our own happiness. In that case the end is not
happiness but the morality of the agent, and his conduct acquires true
moral worth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280"></a>280</span>only
if he secures his happiness not from inclination but from duty.<a

<p>If happiness, then, is in question, which it is to be my duty to
promote as my end, it must be the happiness of other men, whose
permitted end I hereby make also mine. It still remains left to
themselves to decide what they shall reckon as belonging to their
happiness; &ldquo;only that it is in my power to decline many things
which <i>they</i> so reckon, but which I do not so regard, supposing
that they have no right to demand it from me as their own.&rdquo;<a
id="Anchornotech9_66" href="#Notech9_66"><span
class="sp">66</span></a> Kant&rsquo;s doctrine of duties is thus to a
large extent utilitarian. But at the same time it differs in various
points from the theory which generally goes under the name of
utilitarianism, according to which it is a duty for each person to aim
at the greatest amount of happiness on the whole, taking into account
all whose happiness is affected by the conduct and his own happiness
also, though only as an element of the whole. As we just saw, Kant
does not regard it as a duty at all to promote one&rsquo;s own
happiness as an end in itself. In his argument that one does not
command anybody to do what he of himself inevitably wishes to do, he
fails to notice that people do not always will to do what is most
conducive to their greatest happiness; that for the sake of the latter
they may have to sacrifice their immediate happiness; and that this
even may require such reluctance and self-restraint as is implied in
his own notion of duty. In his denial of any obligation to promote
one&rsquo;s own happiness as an end in itself Kant differs from the
morality of common sense; but the difference between the latter and
the orthodox utilitarian view which puts the hedonistic duty which a
man owes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281"></a>281</span>to
himself on a par with that which he owes to others, is more striking.
It is, on the other hand, doubtful whether Kant would have assented to
the utilitarian demand that I am not <i>allowed</i> to prefer my own
lesser happiness to the greater happiness of another man. In the
examples he gives to demonstrate the inconsistency of the egoistic
maxim he only speaks of assistance in distress or help in case of
necessity, and his argument could not possibly be used to prove that
we are morally bound to regard the happiness of other individuals as
much as we regard our own. Indeed, he says expressly that &ldquo;many
a one would gladly consent that others should not benefit him,
provided only that he might be excused from showing benevolence to
them.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_67" href="#Notech9_67"><span
class="sp">67</span></a> In his <i>Tugendlehre</i> he writes that it
is impossible to assign definite limits how far I am bound to
sacrifice to others a part of my own welfare without hope of
recompense. &ldquo;Much depends on what would be the true want of each
according to his own feelings, and it must be left to each to
determine this for himself. For that one should sacrifice his own
happiness, his true wants, in order to promote that of others, would
be a self-contradictory maxim if made a universal law. This duty,
therefore, is only indeterminate; it has a certain latitude within
which one may do more or less without our being able to assign its
limits definitely.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_68"
href="#Notech9_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> As another instance
of an indeterminate duty&mdash;by which he means the permission to
limit one maxim of duty by another&mdash;he mentions the permission to
limit the general love of our neighbour by the love of parents,<a
id="Anchornotech9_69" href="#Notech9_69"><span
class="sp">69</span></a> without any attempt to justify it by its
effect upon the general happiness. In his doctrine of the duty to
contribute to the happiness of others there is no <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page282"></a>282</span>reference to the
greatest happiness on the whole. Sidgwick imputes to Kant the view
that &ldquo;it can only be stated as a <i>duty</i> for me to seek my
own happiness so far as I consider it as a part of the happiness of
mankind in general&rdquo;;<a id="Anchornotech9_70"
href="#Notech9_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> but there is nothing
whatever to show that he ever held such a view. He says that we may be
indirectly bound to secure our own happiness in order to avoid
&ldquo;temptation to transgression of duty&rdquo; or to remove
&ldquo;hindrances to morality,&rdquo; not in order to increase the
happiness of mankind.</p>

<p>I have already, in another connection, stated Kant&rsquo;s attempt
to establish the duty of beneficence by alleging that the egoistic
maxim would contradict itself.<a id="Anchornotech9_71"
href="#Notech9_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> Every man in need
wishes for the aid of others, and it is therefore impossible for any
one to will that each should be left to take care of himself without
such assistance. He maintains that the duty of beneficence may
consequently be deduced from the imperative, &ldquo;Act only on that
maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a
universal law.&rdquo; In one place he has deduced the duty to promote
the happiness of others from his conception of &ldquo;humanity as an
end in itself,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_72" href="#Notech9_72"><span
class="sp">72</span></a> but this deduction is quite inconsistent with
his denial of any obligation to promote one&rsquo;s own happiness; for
humanity, according to his definition, comprises both one&rsquo;s own
person and that of any other, and &ldquo;the natural end which all men
have is their own happiness.&rdquo; But who could believe that the
duty of beneficence really was an inference from the categorical
imperative? Kant, like everybody else, found the notion of it in his
moral consciousness, and he had to explain it, to the best of his
ability, in accordance with his general principle of morality; it was
not the principle that led him to that notion. It is vaguely <span
class="pagenum"><a id="page283"></a>283</span>or distinctly found,
though greatly varying in comprehensiveness, in the moral
consciousness of all men, because it springs from emotions common to
them all.</p>

<p>Another notion in Kant&rsquo;s ethics, of which the idea of
happiness is a component part, has obviously a similar origin.
Although he declares, in the opening sentence of his
<i>Grundlegung</i>, that &ldquo;nothing can possibly be conceived in
the world, or even out of it, which can be called good without
qualification, except a good will,&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_73"
href="#Notech9_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a> he found that there
is something still better, namely, the <i>summum bonum</i>, which is a
combination of two elements, morality and happiness, the latter as
conditioned by and proportioned to the former.<a id="Anchornotech9_74"
href="#Notech9_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> This combination is
recognized as <i>a priori</i>, and therefore as practically necessary:
it is indispensably required by practical reason, which cannot assume
the one of these elements without the other also being attached to it.
Now an accurate correspondence between happiness and moral worth is
not to be expected, but must on the contrary be regarded as
impossible, in a mere course of nature in the world; the possibility
of the <i>summum bonum</i> can therefore only be admitted on the
supposition of a moral and all-powerful Supreme Being who establishes
such correspondence. But &ldquo;although the conception of the
<i>summum bonum</i> as a whole, in which the greatest happiness is
conceived as combined in the most exact proportion with the highest
degree of moral perfection (possible in creatures), includes my own
happiness, yet it is not this that is the determining principle of the
will which is enjoined to promote the <i>summum bonum</i>, but the
moral law, which on the contrary limits by strict conditions my
unbounded desire of happiness. Hence also <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page284"></a>284</span>morality is not properly the doctrine how
we should <i>make</i> ourselves happy, but how we should become
<i>worthy</i> of happiness &hellip;; for it has to do simply with the
rational condition (<i>conditio sine qua non</i>) of happiness, not
with the means of attaining it.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_75"
href="#Notech9_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> The virtuous man is
thus in a very precarious position. Even though he know that he is
worthy of happiness, and even may hope to participate in it,<a
id="Anchornotech9_76" href="#Notech9_76"><span
class="sp">76</span></a> he must not allow any such hope to slip in as
a motive for his conduct; for if he does so he ceases to be virtuous

<p>We have previously heard from Kant that the desire for happiness,
which springs from our sensuous nature, is the great obstacle to
morality, and now happiness has been raised to the rank of an element
of the <i>summum bonum</i>, side by side with morality itself. Nay
more, their combination is said to be recognized <i>a priori</i>, as
indispensably required by practical reason. Paulsen remarks that this
is an inconsistency to which it would be difficult to find a parallel
in the whole history of philosophical thought.<a id="Anchornotech9_77"
href="#Notech9_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> Yet there must be
some explanation of it. The following passages are
significant:&mdash;&ldquo;Virtue (as worthiness to be happy) is the
supreme condition of all that can appear to us desirable, and
consequently of all our pursuit of happiness, and is therefore the
supreme good. But it does not follow that it is the whole and perfect
good as the object of the desires of rational finite beings; for this
requires happiness also, and that not merely in the partial eyes of
the person who makes himself an end, but even in the judgment of an
impartial reason, which regards persons in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page285"></a>285</span>general as ends in themselves. For to need
happiness, to deserve it, and yet at the same time not to participate
in it, cannot be consistent with the perfect volition of a rational
being possessed at the same time of all power, if, for the sake of
experiment, we conceive such a being.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_78"
href="#Notech9_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> Why can it not be
consistent with it? The answer is not far to seek: such a being would
naturally feel the moral emotion of retributive kindliness towards a
virtuous person worthy of happiness and, being not only perfectly good
but also all-powerful, would distribute to him happiness in proportion
to his virtue. The emotional background is visible in the following
statement:&mdash;&ldquo;The sight of a being who is not adorned with a
single feature of a pure and good will, enjoying unbroken prosperity,
can never give pleasure to an impartial rational spectator. Thus a
good will appears to constitute the indispensable condition even of
being worthy of happiness.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_79"
href="#Notech9_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> Kant takes care to
point out that the happiness attached to virtue in the <i>summum
bonum</i> is not a reward based on the justice of God, but a favour
due to his goodness and love. Even the best man only does his duty and
has therefore no claim to divine benevolence: &ldquo;a remunerative
justice (<i>iustitia brabeutica</i>) is in God&rsquo;s relation to men
a contradiction.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_80"
href="#Notech9_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> Nevertheless, in one
place he says exactly the reverse, namely, that a disproportion
between virtue and happiness is contrary to the divine justice.<a
id="Anchornotech9_81" href="#Notech9_81"><span
class="sp">81</span></a> His feelings seem to have got the upper hand
of his theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page286"></a>286</span>In any case the
justice of God requires that the wicked shall be punished.<a
id="Anchornotech9_82" href="#Notech9_82"><span
class="sp">82</span></a> Punishment &ldquo;is a physical evil, which,
though it be not connected with moral evil as a natural consequence,
ought to be connected with it as a consequence by the principles of a
moral legislation.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_83"
href="#Notech9_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a> The sole object of
punishment is retribution. Juridical punishment &ldquo;can never be
administered merely as a means for promoting another good, either with
regard to the criminal himself or to the civil society, but must
always be inflicted only because he has committed a crime.&hellip; The
penal law is a categorical imperative; and woe to him who creeps
through the serpent-windings of the happiness theory in order to
discover something which, in virtue of the advantage it promises, may
release him from the duty of punishment or even from a fraction of
it.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_84" href="#Notech9_84"><span
class="sp">84</span></a> Kant asks what principle should be followed
in fixing the kind and degree of punishment, and his answer is: no
other principle but that of requital (<i>jus talionis</i>), which
requires equivalence both in quality and quantity. Thus the only
rightful punishment for murder is death. Even if a civil society
decides to dissolve itself with the consent of all its members, the
last murderer lying in the prison ought to be executed before the
resolution is carried out. If several persons are implicated in a
murder, including any one who has been an accessory to it, they shall
all die; this is decreed by justice as represented by the judicial
power, &ldquo;in accordance with universal laws which have <i>a
priori</i> origin.&rdquo;<a id="Anchornotech9_85"
href="#Notech9_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a> Yet we are told that
in one case this categorical imperative may be suspended out of
utilitarian considerations: if the number<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page287"></a>287</span> of offenders is so large that the
infliction of the death-penalty might be very dangerous to the State,
the sovereign must be entitled, in agreement with his right of pardon,
to substitute some other penalty.<a id="Anchornotech9_86"
href="#Notech9_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> In two other cases,
where a person&rsquo;s honour is concerned, Kant doubts whether the
law is justified in applying capital punishment: the one is the duel,
the other is infanticide committed by the mother of an illegitimate
child. In the latter case one might suppose that the motive for
relinquishing the law of talion was pity felt for the unfortunate
mother, but the categorical imperative could, of course, never allow
such a feeling to interfere with its command; so Kant had to devise
another explanation, which better agreed with its rationality. He
argues that the infant has been born outside the law, and consequently
is not protected by the law. It has, as it were, crept into the
community as contraband (<i>verbotene Waare</i>), and as it should not
be there at all, the community may ignore both its existence and its
destruction.<a id="Anchornotech9_87" href="#Notech9_87"><span
class="sp">87</span></a> Kant has to admit that there are cases in
which the punishment cannot be exactly equivalent to the crime, as in
bestiality, for instance. It should then be equivalent according to
the spirit of law: the man whose offence has reduced him to the level
of an animal should be expelled from civil society and deprived of
human rights, as he is unworthy to be treated as a human being. Rape
and pederasty, again, should be punished with castration.<a
id="Anchornotech9_88" href="#Notech9_88"><span
class="sp">88</span></a> Here we have a revival of the savage custom
of punishing the offending member; for the principle that the sole
object of punishment is retribution excludes the idea of using it as a
means for preventing the possibility of a repetition of the crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page288"></a>288</span>When Kant says
that punishment can never be administered merely as a means for
promoting another good, either with regard to the criminal himself or
to the civil society, he evidently bases his doctrine of retribution
on one of his formulas of the categorical imperative, although it is
difficult to see that the retributive theory itself treats the
criminal as an &ldquo;end in himself&rdquo;; on the contrary, even
though his punishment is not used as a means either of reforming him
or of deterring anybody else, it is nevertheless actually a means of
gratifying the resentful feelings of the community. But Kant has not
made any attempt to show why practical reason requires punitive
justice at all, and least of all why it requires the rule of tit for
tat. His theory of punishment is simply an expression of the emotion
of moral resentment of a more primitive type than that which is
embodied in the criminal legislation of our own time. Amongst other
things, he has in view only the external resemblance between the
injury done by the offender and the nature of the punishment inflicted
on him, without trying to correlate the pain with the real inward
guilt.<a id="Anchornotech9_89" href="#Notech9_89"><span

<p>Kant&rsquo;s ethics is the most gigantic attempt ever made to found
a theory of morals on reason alone. He has not resorted to the
convenient method adopted by many other moralists of simply appealing
to intuitions in order to establish the objective validity of their
propositions. He has endeavoured to derive the rules of duty by a mere
logical process from a supreme moral law the essence of which is
formal self-consistency. He says himself that he has not thought of
introducing &ldquo;a new principle of morality,&rdquo; just as if all
the world before him were ignorant what duty <span class="pagenum"><a
id="page289"></a>289</span> was or had been in thorough-going error;<a
id="Anchornotech9_90" href="#Notech9_90"><span
class="sp">90</span></a> the knowledge of what every man is bound to
do, and therefore also to know, is within the reach of every man, even
the commonest.<a id="Anchornotech9_91" href="#Notech9_91"><span
class="sp">91</span></a> He has only wanted to set forth a &ldquo;new
formula.&rdquo; But with the deepest regard for the tremendous
earnestness of his purpose, I cannot but think that his struggle to
harmonize the moral experience of mankind with his own rational
deductions has been a colossal failure. I have tried to show that in
his alleged dictates of reason the emotional background is transparent
throughout. And if I have succeeded in such an attempt in the case of
the greatest of all moral rationalists, I flatter myself with the
belief that I have, in no small measure, given additional strength to
the main contentions in this book: that the moral consciousness is
ultimately based on emotions, that the moral judgment lacks objective
validity, that the moral values are not absolute but relative to the
emotions they express.</p>
